1
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:11,989
Hello, hello, 9 AM crowd. What is up? I'm impressed that all of you made it. My voice

2
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:16,271
you can probably hear is a little ragged, just like all of yours, I'm sure. But I'm

3
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:21,333
going to do my best to do my radio announcer voice and kind of lull you into a nice presence

4
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:25,835
as I give you this talk. So, this talk is 30 minutes long, so unfortunately I can't

5
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:29,316
go into literally everything about freelancing. That would be nice, though.

6
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:32,459
So what I'm gonna do is have a follow-up video call

7
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:33,620
with those of you who want it.

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,441
So we're gonna do a group call.

9
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:35,862
So if you wanna give me your business card

10
00:00:35,862 --> 00:00:36,983
at the end of this,

11
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:38,505
I'll send out an email to all of you afterwards

12
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:39,586
and we'll do like a group chat

13
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:41,828
where you can ask me follow-up questions

14
00:00:41,828 --> 00:00:44,330
because I am certain that after we're done here,

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,251
you'll be like, okay, yeah, okay,

16
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:46,191
I don't have any questions.

17
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:48,433
Then one day later, you'll be like, goddammit.

18
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:52,091
which happens with every single talk that we ever go to.

19
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:53,653
So I wanna give you a little bit more so you can,

20
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,196
this isn't the last interaction we'll ever have.

21
00:00:56,196 --> 00:00:58,519
Also, make sure you turn off your cell phones,

22
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:00,061
noise makers, that sort of thing,

23
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,843
and also make sure that you fill out the surveys

24
00:01:01,843 --> 00:01:04,607
for whatever talks that you go to, including this guy's.

25
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:05,267
And lastly.

26
00:01:07,357 --> 00:01:08,337
Whoa.

27
00:01:08,337 --> 00:01:11,480
Make sure that you give me your business card at the very end.

28
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,182
That's really important so that I can get you on my list

29
00:01:14,182 --> 00:01:15,463
to get that all done.

30
00:01:15,463 --> 00:01:18,486
So as we begin, one thing I want to mention to you

31
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:21,268
is that you are running.

32
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:28,867
a business. Most people in the music sound design sense don't actually think about it

33
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:33,230
this way. They think about themselves as artists, which is actually great. I do as well. But

34
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,612
we make the mistake of thinking, oh, I'm not running a business. I'm an artist. That means

35
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:39,173
I don't need to think about money. What?

36
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:45,525
That's ridiculous. No. So what we're going to do is help you think in some ways of how

37
00:01:45,525 --> 00:01:49,887
businesses kind of think and how you can start thinking about that. That doesn't mean necessarily

38
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:54,569
that you have a Rolodex and that you're chomping a cigar every single day. No, no, no. But

39
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:58,491
it does mean that you are thinking about things in a more systematic way.

40
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:01,093
So a little bit about me before we dive into it.

41
00:02:01,093 --> 00:02:02,174
My name's Akash Thakar.

42
00:02:02,174 --> 00:02:04,957
I've worked on the sound design for Hyper Light Drifter,

43
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:07,439
some MIDI mock-up work for Destiny Rise of Iron,

44
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,861
just released Brass Tactics, which is a VR RTS,

45
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:12,143
just released in the Oculus Store.

46
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:14,365
Heat Signature, which is in the IGF, whoop whoop.

47
00:02:14,365 --> 00:02:16,227
And I've given two TEDx Talks,

48
00:02:16,227 --> 00:02:18,029
one on the power of video game music,

49
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:18,790
and another.

50
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,171
on the idea of following your passion

51
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:22,811
being not a good idea, we can talk about that later.

52
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:25,693
And lastly, I just released a book on Monday

53
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:27,393
called Maximizing Game Feel Through Sound,

54
00:02:27,393 --> 00:02:29,774
which is now a number one bestseller on Kindle, woo!

55
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,975
So that is for developers on how they can

56
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:34,356
work with audio people better, yay, woo!

57
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:37,498
Like three people, just like, yeah, sweet.

58
00:02:38,902 --> 00:02:41,424
So what we're going to cover in today's talk

59
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:42,825
is how business owners think.

60
00:02:42,825 --> 00:02:44,346
Obviously, I'm not going to go super in-depth,

61
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:46,667
but how you can start thinking about things

62
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,829
to make it so that your work comes more fluidly

63
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:52,171
and that you're not doing the freelance hustle that so

64
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,512
many people talk about, where you're wondering where

65
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:56,133
the next gig is coming from.

66
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:58,615
How to find great work and what processes

67
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:01,397
you can use to actually get better and better clients.

68
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:03,898
Whether or not you should have a side job and the stigma

69
00:03:03,898 --> 00:03:05,019
associated with that.

70
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:09,980
some contracts and other boring stuff that, you know, we have to cover.

71
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,901
And obviously I want to just remind you that we're gonna do a video call follow up.

72
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:18,762
And lastly, I do want to remind you that the things I say here, my way isn't the only way.

73
00:03:18,762 --> 00:03:21,622
I'm gonna give you some advice that you should actually take and use as your own.

74
00:03:21,622 --> 00:03:24,963
This isn't the only way to actually go about this.

75
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:27,924
And for those of you taking pictures of the slides constantly, I am actually putting these

76
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:29,644
up on my website immediately after.

77
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:30,964
So don't worry about that.

78
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:31,864
So you'll be, you'll be set.

79
00:03:31,864 --> 00:03:33,025
You don't need those grainy photos.

80
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:38,485
So let's go into how businesses think in the kind of intro of this.

81
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,906
So they think in systems.

82
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:46,147
What they do is think about their business or their products or whatever it is that they're

83
00:03:46,147 --> 00:03:50,088
selling or whatever it is that they're doing in reproducible steps.

84
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:52,689
And systems are actually just a fancy word for habits.

85
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:54,509
It's just a business word for habits.

86
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:59,193
So, basically, they think, OK, how can I sell this thing, or do this thing, or give this

87
00:03:59,193 --> 00:04:02,095
service in a way that is reproducible?

88
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:06,118
How can I keep getting clients, for example, or how can I keep selling iPhones, or whatever

89
00:04:06,118 --> 00:04:06,858
it may be?

90
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:09,000
That's the general gist of how businesses think.

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,742
They don't think, oh, maybe we'll sell something today.

92
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:16,226
No, they have a procedure and steps that they can go through to reproduce great results

93
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:17,427
every single time.

94
00:04:17,427 --> 00:04:21,370
Apple is a great example, and Google, who are just kings of systems.

95
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,871
They are amazing at making things happen.

96
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:25,332
fall into place perfectly every single time.

97
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,673
So like I mentioned, you have to make sure

98
00:04:27,673 --> 00:04:29,133
you have reproducible steps.

99
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:31,754
So some examples that I want to give you are,

100
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:33,935
OK, let's say you want to find clients.

101
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:36,456
Maybe you want to make a system based off of that goal.

102
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:39,317
I want to find clients who pay me x amount per gig.

103
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:40,057
Whatever it may be.

104
00:04:40,677 --> 00:04:42,219
What you want to do is start writing down

105
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:44,881
and thinking of this in ways like, OK, what are

106
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:47,043
the steps I can take every month, every week,

107
00:04:47,043 --> 00:04:50,045
every year, whatever it may be in differing time frames

108
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:51,726
that I can use to reproduce this.

109
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:53,848
For example, it could be, OK, every year I'll

110
00:04:53,848 --> 00:04:54,929
come to GDC.

111
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:55,049
OK.

112
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:56,811
That's one part of your system.

113
00:04:56,811 --> 00:04:59,173
Every week or month I'll go to a local

114
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,193
networking meetup.

115
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:00,454
OK.

116
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:00,834
Great.

117
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:01,675
That's a system.

118
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:03,756
What is my system for following up with people

119
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:05,057
after I meet them?

120
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:07,840
Mine, I use an app called Close, C-L-O-Z-E.

121
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,400
It's really good.

122
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,622
to help remind me who to follow up with

123
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:12,684
and who to keep talking to and what we've talked about.

124
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:13,865
It's a really good app for that.

125
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,688
But I have a system for following up with people

126
00:05:16,688 --> 00:05:17,629
and talking to people,

127
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:19,110
and I follow it every single time.

128
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,892
And I use reminders on my phone

129
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:23,434
to actually remind me what things I need to do.

130
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:26,117
And I even spend Sundays scheduling out that week,

131
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,179
OK, what are my systems for this week?

132
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:30,120
What meetups am I going to go to?

133
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,482
That makes it so that these steps

134
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:33,884
actually start to be reproducible.

135
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:39,406
So when you have goals, which are great, I'm a big fan of goals, like, okay, I want to get six clients,

136
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:44,308
I want to get paid for my work, whatever it may be, write down systems that are associated with it.

137
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:49,391
So write down habits that you can start implementing week to week, day to day, month to month, year to year,

138
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,812
on how you can actually start implementing those in your day to day life.

139
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,433
So if you are trying to get clients, what are the systems?

140
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:56,953
What are the habits that you can do?

141
00:05:56,953 --> 00:06:00,234
Showing up to events, talking to people, giving talks, or

142
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,175
talking to mentors and finding work that way, meeting other

143
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:06,436
people in the audio community, asking if there's any overflow

144
00:06:06,436 --> 00:06:09,337
or anything like that, having follow-ups, all that sort of

145
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:12,098
stuff, those are systems that you can implement underneath

146
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:14,238
the goal, because when you have a big goal.

147
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:17,642
That's great, but it can be hard to follow step by step

148
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:20,645
when you don't really know the habits you need

149
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:21,386
to actually get there.

150
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:22,608
If you want to get better at music,

151
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:23,749
what's your practice system?

152
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:25,291
If you want to get better at sound design,

153
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,873
what sort of Foley work are you going to do

154
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:28,014
week to week, month to month?

155
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:29,195
Whatever it may be,

156
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:31,057
you need to think about things in that way.

157
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:37,145
So one thing I want to show you on in the kind of client getting side of things

158
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:40,647
is a little funnel that I made and basically what I want you to start

159
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:44,629
thinking about is how you can actually start getting clients and kind of moving

160
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:49,212
people through this funnel in such a way that you get more clients more easily in

161
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:51,933
an authentic kind of sleaze free way. I'm all about that.

162
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:54,975
So first up, you have something called prospects.

163
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,798
Now, a prospect is someone who may have worked for you

164
00:06:58,798 --> 00:06:59,939
at some point in general,

165
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:01,900
but they don't really know who you are.

166
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,861
It could be a big company

167
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:05,543
that you know needs music or sound,

168
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:07,484
but you're not sure if they're really interested in you.

169
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:09,025
They don't have a job posting open.

170
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:09,886
There's no opening.

171
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:11,186
You don't know anyone at the company.

172
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:13,488
You don't really have any information on it,

173
00:07:13,488 --> 00:07:14,249
but they're a prospect.

174
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:15,630
They're a potential client

175
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,871
that you don't really have much information on.

176
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:20,533
Next up is something called a lead.

177
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:23,394
Now, a lead is a client or a potential client

178
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:26,236
that you have a little bit of knowledge on.

179
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:29,458
You know that they're looking for music or sound

180
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,498
or whatever it is you do.

181
00:07:30,498 --> 00:07:32,019
You have an idea that, okay,

182
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,000
they have a job opening on their website

183
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,681
or you heard through the grapevine

184
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:38,083
that they're interested in hiring you.

185
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,104
That's kind of a lead and you know that they're interested

186
00:07:41,104 --> 00:07:42,705
so you kind of have a little bit of an opening.

187
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,843
Now, opportunities are when clients come to you,

188
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:48,423
or potential clients come to you and say, send us a demo.

189
00:07:48,423 --> 00:07:50,104
Or we're interested in working with you.

190
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:50,924
What's your rate?

191
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:51,504
That sort of thing.

192
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,845
And we're going to talk about answering that dreaded question,

193
00:07:53,845 --> 00:07:55,285
what's your rate, later.

194
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:57,105
But when you have an opportunity,

195
00:07:57,105 --> 00:08:00,126
basically people are asking you to pitch to them

196
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:01,226
in some way, shape, or form.

197
00:08:01,226 --> 00:08:03,427
So you're being asked to show your stuff,

198
00:08:03,427 --> 00:08:05,827
or they're just generally asking, what's your rate?

199
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:07,468
Or how would it be like working with you?

200
00:08:07,468 --> 00:08:09,228
Anything like that, that's an opportunity.

201
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:11,309
And then lastly, you have a client, someone

202
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:13,249
that you are actively working for.

203
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,834
So, what your goal though, throughout all this process through GDC, and we're on Friday

204
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:22,477
so I'm giving you advice that you can't really use for the rest of GDC, but hopefully for

205
00:08:22,477 --> 00:08:26,620
future conferences, is to actually nurture these prospects.

206
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,945
So what you want to do is take leads and opportunities and move them to clients.

207
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:35,868
And the way you actually go about doing that is follow up.

208
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:38,009
This is actually one of the most important things.

209
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:39,890
I'm going to talk about this a little more.

210
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,352
But following up with people you meet,

211
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:44,173
whether it be online or in person.

212
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:45,914
In person is ideal, which is why you're here.

213
00:08:45,914 --> 00:08:47,215
That's great.

214
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:49,016
Following up with them, sending them an email

215
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:51,097
saying it was great to meet them,

216
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,258
within 24 hours of meeting them,

217
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:54,759
or giving them some sort of advice,

218
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,200
or maybe they ask you about middleware

219
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,061
or something like that.

220
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:59,282
Following up with your potential clients

221
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:02,004
within 24 hours is the most powerful way

222
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:03,625
that you'll actually move people

223
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,666
from prospect to lead to opportunity to client.

224
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,228
That's the most powerful way.

225
00:09:07,228 --> 00:09:08,690
And most people mess this up.

226
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,191
They get a pile of business cards.

227
00:09:10,191 --> 00:09:12,935
They look at them and say, they're not interested.

228
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:13,976
And then throw them away.

229
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:16,960
Or they're just kind of languishing on their desk for

230
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,642
months and months and months.

231
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:21,165
And how many of you have done that and just let all your

232
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:23,207
business cards kind of, OK, like one person raises their

233
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:24,048
hand and is honest.

234
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:27,370
I know all of you have done this, so don't lie to me.

235
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,290
I can tell.

236
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,972
So when we're talking about finding clients

237
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:33,073
and finding great work, your goal is to move

238
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,653
like potential prospects through this funnel

239
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:36,454
through talking to them and following up.

240
00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:38,795
This isn't done in a friendly, sleaze-free way.

241
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:40,816
You're not constantly elbowing them in the ribs

242
00:09:40,816 --> 00:09:43,918
saying, please hire me, because that's, ooh,

243
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:46,179
we do that too much, and I hear too many horror stories

244
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:47,560
of other composers and sound designers

245
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,600
who are just begging for work.

246
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,321
That's not the way to do this.

247
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:52,722
Your goal is to actually form some sort of business,

248
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:55,624
or friendly relationship, with these people.

249
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:56,584
You want to talk to them.

250
00:09:56,584 --> 00:09:58,145
You actually want to get to know them.

251
00:09:58,145 --> 00:10:00,626
You want to know their game's needs.

252
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:01,727
That's really important.

253
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,988
And you want to know how you can actually solve their problem.

254
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:04,728
This isn't just a gig.

255
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:07,769
You are solving their problem, because they don't have music.

256
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:08,290
They don't have sound.

257
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,171
They don't have voiceover or implementation for their game.

258
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:13,452
And it's really important for them to actually have that off

259
00:10:13,452 --> 00:10:15,873
of their plate, so they don't need to worry about it.

260
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:18,474
That's what we're doing here. We're actually helping devs

261
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:21,295
not worry about that side of their develop, development

262
00:10:21,295 --> 00:10:22,435
so much.

263
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:24,276
So like I've mentioned, it's good to talk to

264
00:10:24,276 --> 00:10:27,897
humans. I'm an extreme, extreme, extreme introvert. So I

265
00:10:27,897 --> 00:10:30,797
have to actually train really, really, really, really hard

266
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,738
for the course of a decade to be able

267
00:10:32,738 --> 00:10:34,798
so much as look someone in the eye.

268
00:10:34,798 --> 00:10:37,519
So talking to humans is really, really important. That

269
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,700
is actually one of the most important things you

270
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,800
can do. In person is ideal. I get asked

271
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,060
a lot.

272
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,402
How do I find tons of clients online?

273
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:46,225
You can, but generally in person,

274
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:47,607
you'll find higher quality clients

275
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:50,110
and you'll get more prospects and leads

276
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,472
and opportunities and clients

277
00:10:51,472 --> 00:10:53,955
by talking to people in person, face to face.

278
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:56,118
People will be able to trust you much, much quicker that way.

279
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,420
asked a lot, oh, I don't have a reel, or I

280
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,602
don't have a website, or anything like that.

281
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:03,143
I can't go to those networking events.

282
00:11:03,143 --> 00:11:06,044
Now, this isn't necessarily for you, because you're all

283
00:11:06,044 --> 00:11:08,246
here at one of the biggest networking events for the game

284
00:11:08,246 --> 00:11:09,206
industry.

285
00:11:09,206 --> 00:11:10,507
But a lot of people ask me if they

286
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:14,069
don't have a reel or website, is it OK to talk to developers?

287
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:15,870
And absolutely yes.

288
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,312
I didn't have one for like three years when I first started,

289
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:19,753
but I still got clients.

290
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:22,694
Because people just kind of said like, oh, you're cool.

291
00:11:23,388 --> 00:11:24,849
Come on board.

292
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:26,650
And that is actually how it works in some cases,

293
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,851
especially kind of at a starting level.

294
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:31,593
People want to hire people that they like or that they know

295
00:11:31,593 --> 00:11:33,474
or that they trust or that they met in person,

296
00:11:33,474 --> 00:11:35,596
someone that they've interfaced with that they know

297
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:38,498
will probably do a great job and won't just disappear

298
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,799
off the face of the planet,

299
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,801
which may happen more likely with someone they've never met

300
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:45,022
and is completely online and they know nothing about.

301
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:47,664
So even if you don't have a reel and you don't have a website,

302
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:49,746
yes, talk to developers as much as you can.

303
00:11:49,746 --> 00:11:52,408
Because once you have that website, once you have that reel,

304
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:56,512
once you have all your stuff ready, they'll know who you are already.

305
00:11:56,512 --> 00:11:58,874
And you'll have someone to actually talk to about it.

306
00:11:58,874 --> 00:12:02,957
And people will be more receptive, because they already know who you are.

307
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:03,918
Does that make sense?

308
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:04,539
Does everyone follow?

309
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:04,619
Yes?

310
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:04,699
Cool.

311
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,362
So one thing I'll mention to people who are just starting out,

312
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,603
people say like, oh, should I say no to things?

313
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:14,505
Like, should I say yes to everything that comes my way?

314
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:16,606
Generally, unless the client is super shady

315
00:12:16,606 --> 00:12:18,527
and you're getting a really bad vibe from them,

316
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:20,048
and you're just starting out, and you

317
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:21,109
don't know what your strengths are,

318
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:22,289
and you're still figuring things out,

319
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:24,291
and maybe you don't have paid clients yet,

320
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,592
it is a good idea to start saying yes to a lot of things

321
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:28,553
so that you can get a lot of experience.

322
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:30,354
Now again, this doesn't mean necessarily

323
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:32,235
working with bad clients or working

324
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:35,317
with people who give you really bad vibes or are disrespectful.

325
00:12:35,677 --> 00:12:37,318
because there's a lot of that in this industry,

326
00:12:37,318 --> 00:12:40,039
unfortunately, but I'm not saying you have to do that.

327
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:43,181
But it's a good idea to start saying yes to a lot of things

328
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:44,882
and taking on a lot of work,

329
00:12:44,882 --> 00:12:47,723
within reason, obviously, don't sacrifice your health.

330
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:49,904
But taking in a lot of work is really important

331
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:51,645
to getting your strengths and knowing

332
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,065
what you like working on,

333
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,606
and having an idea of what sorts of clients

334
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:55,967
you wanna work with,

335
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,628
and knowing what sorts of things you'll need to say

336
00:12:58,628 --> 00:13:02,070
to future clients in the future as you start negotiating,

337
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,530
getting contracts, that sort of thing.

338
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:07,454
And lastly, you all know this, but just so you know,

339
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,076
one thing that you, some things that you can do

340
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:10,197
is of course volunteer at events.

341
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:11,358
That's how I actually started.

342
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:13,000
I was a CA when I first started here.

343
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,443
So, woo, CAs, I love them so much.

344
00:13:15,443 --> 00:13:16,584
But that's how I started.

345
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:18,566
I volunteered at things like PAX or GDC

346
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:21,029
or any local events in Seattle where I'm based.

347
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:24,552
to meet people, to meet developers, to say hi to other people,

348
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:26,614
and meet all the other volunteers as well.

349
00:13:26,614 --> 00:13:28,576
And that was networking that was kind of done for me.

350
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:31,619
So don't eschew volunteering from your mind. It's really useful.

351
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:34,021
Going to game jams, of course, great idea for experience.

352
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,482
Most of you have done this already.

353
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,224
And attending local events, wherever you're at.

354
00:13:37,224 --> 00:13:40,027
And it may not be so local for you. You may need to travel a bit.

355
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,989
Some people live further away from hubs than others.

356
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,911
You may need to drive a bit, or even fly,

357
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:46,412
like I'm sure many of you did to get here.

358
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:51,195
that's worth it. It's worth it to actually attend events and actually talk to humans

359
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:55,897
and get in people's faces, not in a weird way, but talk to people and be actual friends

360
00:13:55,897 --> 00:14:02,200
with them. So let's talk about networking on that note a little bit more. So like I

361
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,042
mentioned before, you're actually here to make friends and actual relationships. You're

362
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:10,224
not here just to go up to people, hand your business card out and run away, which is what

363
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,905
I certainly did when I started. Woo!

364
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:13,286
So that doesn't work.

365
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:14,166
That doesn't work at all.

366
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,188
People actually want to form some sort of connection with you.

367
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:20,029
And if they do, they're much more likely to hire you based

368
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:21,310
on that principle.

369
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,871
They'll realize, oh, OK, you're easy to work with.

370
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:24,852
You have a good vibe.

371
00:14:24,852 --> 00:14:27,973
This will probably go a lot better than someone who just

372
00:14:27,973 --> 00:14:30,134
handed me their business card I know nothing about and just

373
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:30,355
ran away.

374
00:14:30,355 --> 00:14:32,856
It is worth it to form these relationships.

375
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:35,657
And I'm always about quality over quantity.

376
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:36,718
So if you can talk to people.

377
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:41,319
for a little bit longer instead of talking to everybody for one, two seconds at a time,

378
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:45,660
that's more important. Having quality over quantity is really, really important.

379
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,662
So one thing I'll mention is as you get more advanced and as you become more,

380
00:14:49,662 --> 00:14:52,782
you know, well-known in the industry or you start talking to more people,

381
00:14:52,782 --> 00:14:55,963
just showing up doesn't really work after a certain point.

382
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,524
Yes, if you're starting out, just showing up is great,

383
00:14:57,524 --> 00:14:59,626
because you don't really know what's going on.

384
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:00,466
Fantastic.

385
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,427
Just do that.

386
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:03,188
But if you are a little more intermediate, a little more

387
00:15:03,188 --> 00:15:05,990
advanced, your pay rate is increasing, et cetera, et

388
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,812
cetera, making a plan for networking events is really,

389
00:15:08,812 --> 00:15:10,293
really, really crucial.

390
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:11,473
I don't just show up anymore.

391
00:15:11,473 --> 00:15:13,254
I research speakers.

392
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:14,515
I see who's going to be there.

393
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:15,116
I host lunches.

394
00:15:15,116 --> 00:15:16,457
I host events, that sort of thing.

395
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,238
You don't necessarily need to go that far.

396
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:20,239
But looking at who's going to be at that event,

397
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:22,460
whether it be speakers or just attendees,

398
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,081
especially if it's a local event,

399
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:27,142
you can usually see who's going to be there, is very helpful.

400
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:29,163
You can look at what those people are up to

401
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:30,824
and see what they're working on.

402
00:15:30,824 --> 00:15:32,425
If you can walk up to someone and say,

403
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:33,966
oh, I've actually been looking at your game.

404
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:34,726
That's really cool.

405
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:35,947
I'm excited about x, y, z.

406
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:39,549
that's much better than tell me about your game,

407
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:42,431
because you've actually put the time in to actually research

408
00:15:42,431 --> 00:15:45,273
and learn and actually make an effort

409
00:15:45,273 --> 00:15:47,154
to learn about other people instead of hoping

410
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,196
other people will just trust you instantly.

411
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:50,396
That doesn't work.

412
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:51,197
That doesn't happen.

413
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:53,238
So don't just show up at a certain point.

414
00:15:53,238 --> 00:15:55,380
It's worth researching the event,

415
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,842
who's gonna be there, who you should talk to.

416
00:15:57,842 --> 00:15:59,243
It makes things much easier

417
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:00,824
and it kills a lot of the small talk

418
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:03,565
and you can get way easier into better conversations.

419
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:06,847
And like I mentioned, sending emails, researching speakers.

420
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:09,127
Sending emails to people who might be there

421
00:16:09,127 --> 00:16:10,827
is very important before you go to that event.

422
00:16:10,827 --> 00:16:13,468
Like, oh, it'll be great meeting you, I'll be at your talk,

423
00:16:13,468 --> 00:16:16,349
or I can't wait to see you at this event, whatever it may be.

424
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:18,449
When I first started in Seattle,

425
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:21,810
I messaged the person who was the head of those meetups.

426
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,670
I just said, oh, I just moved to Seattle,

427
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,331
I can't wait to meet you, I'll be at this event.

428
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,391
Great.

429
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:27,052
Nothing more than that.

430
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:30,054
I didn't mention I was a composer, sound designer, none of that stuff.

431
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:32,536
But when I showed up, I said, oh, hey, it's so nice to meet you.

432
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:33,597
Like, oh, you sent me that email.

433
00:16:33,597 --> 00:16:35,338
Yeah, let me introduce you to some people.

434
00:16:35,338 --> 00:16:39,161
Because they already had an idea of who I was just a little bit, and it got rid of the

435
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:39,782
small talk.

436
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:43,145
The stranger danger was kind of gone a little bit.

437
00:16:43,145 --> 00:16:46,847
And again, like I've mentioned, follow-up is so, so, so, so important.

438
00:16:47,594 --> 00:16:51,237
Now, following up with people within 24 hours, you get a card.

439
00:16:51,237 --> 00:16:51,537
They're cool.

440
00:16:51,537 --> 00:16:52,978
You don't have to follow up with literally everybody.

441
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,721
But if you get someone who's interesting, follow up with

442
00:16:55,721 --> 00:16:58,223
them, email them within 24 hours, talk about what you've

443
00:16:58,223 --> 00:17:00,265
talked about, if you had a good conversation.

444
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:01,246
Say it was great meeting them.

445
00:17:01,246 --> 00:17:01,546
Thanks.

446
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:02,167
See you later.

447
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:03,949
It doesn't have to be anything longer than that.

448
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:05,610
Don't do the thing where people send.

449
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,715
and it's Encyclopedia Britannica emails, which is what I

450
00:17:08,715 --> 00:17:10,938
get a hundred and fifty of every single week.

451
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:11,920
Please don't do that to me.

452
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,863
And it's just like, here's my life story.

453
00:17:13,863 --> 00:17:15,445
Here's sixteen demo reels.

454
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:16,527
Please love me.

455
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:17,368
Don't do that.

456
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:17,989
Just say hello.

457
00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:18,970
It was great to meet you.

458
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,272
And then, that's it.

459
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:20,893
Perfect email.

460
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:23,825
So, like I mentioned, you do need a, you do

461
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:25,626
need a big network, but that'll come with time.

462
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:28,288
The quality actually matters a little bit more, and

463
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:30,089
vibrancy is what actually comes about.

464
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:32,110
And I actually learned this quote was really good

465
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,313
from the work-life balance talk that Penka, Brian Schmidt,

466
00:17:36,313 --> 00:17:38,314
Jesse, and Larissa gave.

467
00:17:38,314 --> 00:17:39,015
And that was really good.

468
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:39,735
I can't remember who

469
00:17:39,735 --> 00:17:40,996
exactly, I think it was Penka that said this.

470
00:17:40,996 --> 00:17:42,257
I'm not a hundred percent sure.

471
00:17:42,257 --> 00:17:42,797
But you do need a

472
00:17:42,797 --> 00:17:43,277
big network.

473
00:17:43,277 --> 00:17:44,478
That'll come with time.

474
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:45,959
And you do need a vibrant one, which is

475
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:47,560
one that you're following up with and talking to

476
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,741
regularly, showing up to local events.

477
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:50,662
Those are the people who have your back.

478
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,980
So contracts will blaze through this really quickly.

479
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,821
You can ask me specific questions now or afterwards.

480
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:58,821
Use contracts, even for free projects.

481
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:01,322
A lot of people ask me, like, oh, it's free, whatever.

482
00:18:01,322 --> 00:18:03,622
But if you use one, it actually helps

483
00:18:03,622 --> 00:18:05,562
determine who owns your stuff.

484
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:07,503
And there is a little bit of a precedent.

485
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,543
I'm not a lawyer, by the way.

486
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:10,143
I'm not sure if you could tell.

487
00:18:10,143 --> 00:18:12,504
But there's a little bit of a precedent set now,

488
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:17,545
where if a contract isn't set, then by default, not always,

489
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:19,265
this is kind of super gray area.

490
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:23,888
the rights can sometimes go to the client instead of you if there's no contract.

491
00:18:23,888 --> 00:18:27,690
And you may not want that. You may want the ownership terms really clear.

492
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,431
If you're working on a free project and you're not getting anything out of it,

493
00:18:30,431 --> 00:18:32,052
which I'll talk about in a second,

494
00:18:32,052 --> 00:18:36,434
it is really important to actually make sure you own those rights to that music or that sound,

495
00:18:36,434 --> 00:18:39,436
or you're just doing a license, or you want to be clear that they own it

496
00:18:39,436 --> 00:18:41,016
so there's no kerfuffle in the future.

497
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:44,826
Now, the two major types of contracts are work for hire,

498
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:48,388
which means that, OK, this client owns all of the stuff

499
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:49,129
that I give them.

500
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,069
They own all the music.

501
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:51,090
They own all the sound.

502
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,411
They pay me, and we're good.

503
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:54,132
That's usually how it works.

504
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,854
So that's what I did for things like Destiny, for example.

505
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:57,634
I make something.

506
00:18:57,634 --> 00:18:58,235
They own it.

507
00:18:58,235 --> 00:18:59,256
I don't have it.

508
00:18:59,256 --> 00:19:02,017
I can't take that and sell that later, right?

509
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:02,518
Pretty simple.

510
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:04,799
That's usually the most common that you're going to run into.

511
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,942
Now, there's also non-exclusive agreement, which you can use for clients that may not

512
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:10,643
be able to pay your full rate.

513
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:15,045
What actually happens here is that you retain ownership of your stuff, your music, your

514
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:18,487
sound, whatever it may be, but you're licensing an out to that client.

515
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:22,690
So you're giving it to them for some period of time where they can use it, and then you

516
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,492
can sell it to other clients later as well.

517
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:28,934
This makes it cheaper for the client and makes it so that you can make more money off of

518
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:29,434
it in the future.

519
00:19:29,874 --> 00:19:31,956
So if you make a whole bunch of sounds, you can then say,

520
00:19:31,956 --> 00:19:33,798
OK, you can have these sounds.

521
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,402
Maybe you have it exclusively for the next six months, let's

522
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:38,904
say, you don't always have to have a timeline,

523
00:19:38,904 --> 00:19:39,665
but you usually can.

524
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:42,788
And then you can say, OK, cool, the six months is up.

525
00:19:42,788 --> 00:19:44,510
I can give this to any other client I want.

526
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,732
I can use this in any other future game I want.

527
00:19:46,732 --> 00:19:49,015
So you can make a little bit more money off the back end of

528
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:50,076
it as time goes on.

529
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:52,713
So let's talk about charging clients.

530
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:54,055
That's really important.

531
00:19:54,055 --> 00:19:55,677
Now, this is a little bit disputed,

532
00:19:55,677 --> 00:19:58,000
and I'll give you a little bit of a qualifier on this.

533
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,622
Flat fees are really important.

534
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:01,524
I see a lot of people shooting themselves in the foot

535
00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:02,806
with per asset rates.

536
00:20:02,806 --> 00:20:05,289
That's not necessarily the best way,

537
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:07,031
not to say it's always the best way,

538
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:09,774
but using flat fees makes it easier for the client.

539
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:14,758
I see so many people say, oh, I charge X amount per sound effect or X amount per minute of

540
00:20:14,758 --> 00:20:14,959
music.

541
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:19,402
And especially in the indie world, people will see that rate and be like, that's a blank

542
00:20:19,402 --> 00:20:20,063
check.

543
00:20:20,063 --> 00:20:22,665
I have no idea how much I'm going to pay this person.

544
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:28,910
Even if they say it'll be 100 assets and it will be $100 per asset, they still don't want

545
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,390
to see that.

546
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,971
They want you to just throw a number out.

547
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:35,113
and use a flat fee. And it makes things so much easier for them

548
00:20:35,113 --> 00:20:38,394
to not have to worry about it. They don't get blank check syndrome.

549
00:20:38,394 --> 00:20:41,015
It makes things so much simpler. So whenever you can,

550
00:20:41,015 --> 00:20:44,076
calculate your fee. Maybe you do per asset in your head,

551
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,777
but calculate how many assets, measure it all out,

552
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:48,798
and say, oh, this will be $3,000.

553
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:50,159
Here you go.

554
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,142
And maybe you had a per asset fee in your head, but you're

555
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:53,884
giving them the final number.

556
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:55,126
It makes things a lot easier.

557
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:56,228
Not all clients prefer this.

558
00:20:56,228 --> 00:20:57,690
This isn't for everything.

559
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,693
But it is very useful and makes things a lot

560
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,335
smoother and a lot easier.

561
00:21:01,335 --> 00:21:03,238
So that's my advice to you.

562
00:21:03,238 --> 00:21:04,440
Now I'm going to.

563
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,760
send this to you guys for those of you giving me your card and all that. I'm going to give

564
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,901
you a template for a project proposal. So when someone asks like, oh, what's your rate?

565
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:15,362
Instead of just emailing them back, you can actually have a little bit of a PDF where

566
00:21:15,362 --> 00:21:18,883
you can send them, you know, here's our timelines, here's how much I will, here's how much it's

567
00:21:18,883 --> 00:21:22,764
going to cost, here's why it's going to cost this much. Thanks so much. It's a much more

568
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:27,685
professional way to actually give your rates. I can't go into one here, but again, email

569
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:30,326
me or, you know, give me your cards or whatever and I can send that to you.

570
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:35,637
Now, there's something that happens a lot called post-quote silence where,

571
00:21:35,637 --> 00:21:38,679
oh, I charge this much, and then no response from the client.

572
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:40,740
How many of you have dealt with that?

573
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,201
Yes?

574
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:41,301
OK.

575
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,782
A whole bunch of people have dealt with that.

576
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:45,223
Now, this is a common thing.

577
00:21:45,223 --> 00:21:46,304
This is really, really common.

578
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:47,205
This happens a lot.

579
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,946
The general reason that this happens isn't necessarily

580
00:21:49,946 --> 00:21:51,347
because your price is too high.

581
00:21:51,347 --> 00:21:53,529
It does happen because of that sometimes.

582
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:57,111
But usually, it's the client sees that and goes, OK, let me think on that.

583
00:21:57,111 --> 00:21:57,871
I'm busy right now.

584
00:21:57,871 --> 00:21:58,552
I'll get back to that.

585
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:01,173
And they never get back to it because emails are the worst.

586
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:07,438
So, how to actually get around it is to actually, when they say, when you give the rate, no

587
00:22:07,438 --> 00:22:11,442
response, within about, you know, one to two days, give it a little bit of time for them

588
00:22:11,442 --> 00:22:16,206
to respond, I usually say something like, okay, great, I'm excited to get to work on

589
00:22:16,206 --> 00:22:19,909
this, I can start on the sword sounds, or whatever, some specific thing, I can start

590
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:21,210
on the sword sounds today.

591
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,131
How does that sound?

592
00:22:22,771 --> 00:22:25,552
it makes it a lot easier for them to say yes at that point.

593
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,972
And it makes it so that they're like,

594
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:29,472
oh right, I forgot to respond to this, yes.

595
00:22:29,472 --> 00:22:31,113
Don't mention the money in your follow-up either,

596
00:22:31,113 --> 00:22:34,053
because it's really easy for us as artists and freelancers

597
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,033
to kind of wring our hands, like,

598
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:37,034
oh, I'm sorry I charged $100 for this.

599
00:22:37,034 --> 00:22:41,035
Ooh, I'm so sorry, let me just lower this for you.

600
00:22:41,035 --> 00:22:41,855
Don't do that.

601
00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:43,475
Just say, I'm excited to get to work on this,

602
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:44,435
how about I start on X?

603
00:22:44,435 --> 00:22:46,516
Makes it a lot easier for them,

604
00:22:46,516 --> 00:22:49,016
and it lets them know that you're actually more motivated

605
00:22:49,016 --> 00:22:50,217
as well to actually get started.

606
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:52,833
Now, one thing for those of you who are beginners

607
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,494
and you don't know how to respond to the question,

608
00:22:54,494 --> 00:22:55,494
how much do you charge?

609
00:22:55,494 --> 00:22:57,696
Now, this is usually beginner level only,

610
00:22:57,696 --> 00:23:00,477
but not super advanced or other ways.

611
00:23:00,477 --> 00:23:02,798
But if someone says, oh, how much do you charge?

612
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,359
And you know you have a general kind of tummy number,

613
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,900
something in your gut that you know, like, okay.

614
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,683
How about like, you know, $1,000 for this or whatever.

615
00:23:09,683 --> 00:23:11,384
I'm just making random numbers.

616
00:23:11,384 --> 00:23:13,086
And that's really scary for you to say that.

617
00:23:13,086 --> 00:23:15,348
I've had so many people say, oh, I'm so scared to quote.

618
00:23:15,348 --> 00:23:17,751
Oh my god, I have to send a dollar sign,

619
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:20,293
one, one, one, one, zero, zero, zero to this person.

620
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:22,456
What I usually do in this case, when you're that scared

621
00:23:22,456 --> 00:23:25,118
and you're not 100% sure if it's too high,

622
00:23:25,358 --> 00:23:27,820
what you can do is say something like this.

623
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,141
Normally, I would charge $1,000 for this project.

624
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:32,282
Now, I know you're a small indie studio,

625
00:23:32,282 --> 00:23:33,663
or whatever qualifier you want,

626
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,804
especially if it's a beginner project or student project,

627
00:23:35,804 --> 00:23:36,704
whatever it may be.

628
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,426
How much of that number do you feel comfortable paying?

629
00:23:40,276 --> 00:23:41,516
That puts the ball in their court,

630
00:23:41,516 --> 00:23:43,177
but they know what your number is.

631
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:45,018
So you'll often find something,

632
00:23:45,018 --> 00:23:46,858
you'll often find clients say like,

633
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,179
oh, well, okay, I can't do 1,000, but 800's good.

634
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,760
Or, but there's a human psychology thing that happens

635
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,202
where you can easily say, oh, I normally charge 1,500,

636
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:57,782
let's say it's for the same project, 1,500 for this.

637
00:23:58,222 --> 00:24:00,303
How much of that number do you feel comfortable paying?

638
00:24:00,303 --> 00:24:00,844
Oh, we can't do 15.

639
00:24:00,844 --> 00:24:01,484
How about 1,200?

640
00:24:01,484 --> 00:24:04,445
So you can actually increase your rates, actually,

641
00:24:04,445 --> 00:24:06,046
really, really easily that way.

642
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:08,227
Again, if you're more advanced, I usually just say,

643
00:24:08,227 --> 00:24:09,188
here's my rate.

644
00:24:09,188 --> 00:24:11,229
I don't really negotiate on that case.

645
00:24:11,229 --> 00:24:13,289
But when you're first starting out, it's really terrifying

646
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:15,210
to actually wonder, is this too high?

647
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,291
Is this too low?

648
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,092
I want to leave a little leeway because I don't know

649
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:19,352
what the rates are.

650
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:20,573
I have no idea.

651
00:24:20,573 --> 00:24:21,654
That's the script.

652
00:24:21,654 --> 00:24:23,114
I normally charge x.

653
00:24:23,114 --> 00:24:25,275
How much of that do you feel comfortable paying?

654
00:24:25,275 --> 00:24:26,436
That's usually how you can go.

655
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,722
Now some people ask, can I work for free?

656
00:24:28,722 --> 00:24:29,102
Is that okay?

657
00:24:29,102 --> 00:24:31,686
Especially if it's a student game or something like that.

658
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:33,208
Yes, you can totally work for free.

659
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:35,251
You're not devaluing the industry, but.

660
00:24:35,582 --> 00:24:38,823
But, but, but, but, make sure you're not working for nothing.

661
00:24:38,823 --> 00:24:41,104
You can work for free, but don't work for nothing.

662
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,325
Most people work for nothing.

663
00:24:42,325 --> 00:24:44,446
They think, oh, credit, sweet.

664
00:24:44,446 --> 00:24:46,066
No, you have to get credit.

665
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:48,207
In some places, it's the law.

666
00:24:48,207 --> 00:24:48,888
That's nothing.

667
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:50,348
That's absolutely nothing.

668
00:24:50,348 --> 00:24:51,689
Get something else out of it.

669
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:53,910
It could be tickets to an event like GDC.

670
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,871
Maybe the developer can get you there.

671
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:57,091
It may be business card design.

672
00:24:57,091 --> 00:24:57,992
It could be web design.

673
00:24:57,992 --> 00:24:59,933
It could be teaching you how to code, whatever it may be.

674
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:04,296
get some sort of something out of it. Other

675
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:06,898
than credit. Make sure you get something else, whether

676
00:25:06,898 --> 00:25:09,120
it be a skill trade or something like that.

677
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,262
That's really important. When I first worked for Penny

678
00:25:11,262 --> 00:25:13,484
Arcade, way, way back, I was their audio guy,

679
00:25:13,484 --> 00:25:15,525
I remember the final job I did for them.

680
00:25:15,525 --> 00:25:17,387
I was like, how about I do this for

681
00:25:17,387 --> 00:25:19,789
free but you give me free PAX passes forever,

682
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:20,670
as many as I want.

683
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:24,373
Great. I have that. I have that now.

684
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:29,055
So I have endless passes for every PAX that I could ever want.

685
00:25:29,055 --> 00:25:30,937
It rules. And that was well worth it.

686
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,948
So people ask about side jobs.

687
00:25:33,948 --> 00:25:34,388
Should I?

688
00:25:34,388 --> 00:25:34,788
Can I?

689
00:25:34,788 --> 00:25:35,589
Is it a good idea?

690
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:36,250
Yes.

691
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,511
It's a good idea.

692
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:39,953
I used to clean toilets when I first started.

693
00:25:39,953 --> 00:25:42,215
So I was a public pool janitor.

694
00:25:42,215 --> 00:25:44,096
I don't recommend that as your side job.

695
00:25:44,096 --> 00:25:45,738
It was the worst.

696
00:25:45,738 --> 00:25:46,358
It was the smells.

697
00:25:46,358 --> 00:25:48,480
I actually had to wear a gas mask.

698
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,101
I'm not joking.

699
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:50,642
That's how bad it smelled.

700
00:25:50,642 --> 00:25:52,583
So it's OK to have a side job.

701
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,985
So many people ask, oh, but I need to go all in.

702
00:25:55,686 --> 00:25:59,930
No, it's good to have actually some sort of financial stability while you're studying

703
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,732
and while you're working on your craft.

704
00:26:01,732 --> 00:26:03,754
That is so, so, so crucial.

705
00:26:03,754 --> 00:26:05,416
And you're not a failure if you have one.

706
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:06,637
You're absolutely not.

707
00:26:06,637 --> 00:26:08,599
It's really important to know that.

708
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:12,964
If you are building financial stability and hustling or working on your thing on the side,

709
00:26:12,964 --> 00:26:16,647
I consider that a success so long as you keep going and doing your thing.

710
00:26:17,128 --> 00:26:19,449
It's only failure if you completely quit and give up

711
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:23,191
and say, no, I'm never doing this again, this is too hard.

712
00:26:23,191 --> 00:26:24,511
Or maybe you wanna pivot,

713
00:26:24,511 --> 00:26:26,452
which isn't failure in and of itself.

714
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:29,053
But if you realize that, okay, I wanna do this thing,

715
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:30,594
and you're smart enough to realize

716
00:26:30,594 --> 00:26:32,395
you also need money to do it,

717
00:26:32,395 --> 00:26:33,816
then that's actually a really smart thing.

718
00:26:33,816 --> 00:26:35,696
That's a really smart way of thinking about it.

719
00:26:35,696 --> 00:26:37,277
Now, some of you are higher risk than others

720
00:26:37,277 --> 00:26:39,818
and wanna go all in, fine, that's totally cool.

721
00:26:39,818 --> 00:26:40,579
No worries at all.

722
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:41,979
If you have a higher risk tolerance

723
00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:44,821
and can deal with those real financial lows,

724
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:49,464
Cool, but I do advocate for most people to have some sort of financial stability

725
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:53,047
because it can be a lot harder to so much as write a note when you're worried about

726
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:55,448
where the next meal is coming from, right?

727
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:56,829
So make sure you have something.

728
00:26:56,829 --> 00:27:00,132
So lastly, as a reminder, as we finish up, there's no one right way.

729
00:27:00,132 --> 00:27:04,515
This isn't just, this is just me going and me telling you from my point of view.

730
00:27:04,615 --> 00:27:05,696
And we're going to wrap up here.

731
00:27:05,696 --> 00:27:07,918
We only have a few minutes left for questions.

732
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,399
So if you also want to, you know, I'm

733
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:11,180
going to be able to hang out a little bit here

734
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,142
before I go to my next talk at 10 with Ryan Eich and Carly

735
00:27:14,142 --> 00:27:16,844
Knight on the don'ts, how not to work in game audio.

736
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,305
So you can follow me there if you want to as well.

737
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:20,967
Also, we'll be doing that follow-up video call.

738
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:24,250
So please feel free to email me as well any of your questions.

739
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,292
Let me know that you're at GDC, because I get literally

740
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:29,394
150 emails a week of people asking advice.

741
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:31,575
So make sure you're at GDC, because then I'll actually have.

742
00:27:31,895 --> 00:27:34,997
you know, a filter set up to make sure I talk to you guys first, you have high priority

743
00:27:34,997 --> 00:27:38,219
because I get to meet you in person. I also have business cards here if you want to kind

744
00:27:38,219 --> 00:27:42,402
of just grab one and go if you're off to somewhere. But that's it for today. Thank you so much

745
00:27:42,402 --> 00:27:53,289
for coming. So we have a couple of minutes for questions, so please use the mic just

746
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:54,550
so it goes into the recording.

747
00:27:56,978 --> 00:27:58,019
I've been so polite.

748
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:03,242
Hey, thank you for taking the time today to share your

749
00:28:03,242 --> 00:28:03,923
experience.

750
00:28:03,923 --> 00:28:04,923
Actually, two things.

751
00:28:04,923 --> 00:28:08,525
How do you transition clients that you've started

752
00:28:08,525 --> 00:28:10,287
on a trade basis?

753
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:13,068
You've got, I would call, a professional rate.

754
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:15,750
I do video production work, authoring DVDs.

755
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,553
And you start with clients, great clients, great people.

756
00:28:20,553 --> 00:28:23,174
You're helping them in a small business with work.

757
00:28:23,815 --> 00:28:27,118
to get a professional job done, but now you're trying to get other clients.

758
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:33,643
They still demand a lot of time, but they can't move with you to that rate.

759
00:28:33,643 --> 00:28:34,564
I mean, how have you handled that?

760
00:28:34,564 --> 00:28:36,806
Yeah, so usually there's a few ways to do it.

761
00:28:36,806 --> 00:28:41,249
You can give them kind of a bonus, like an old client rate, like you give them a cheaper rate.

762
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:45,013
But if you don't want, you may not want to work with that company anymore, let's say,

763
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:48,055
let's say like hypothetically, oh, they just can't pay me anymore at all.

764
00:28:48,675 --> 00:28:51,217
It's a good idea if there is a hard cutoff,

765
00:28:51,217 --> 00:28:53,898
recommend someone else, so that's a good karma for you.

766
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,239
But if you want to transition them into a higher tier

767
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:58,180
with you, if you want to bring them to,

768
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,100
you're saying your rates are increasing,

769
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,882
it's actually not a bad idea, in my experience,

770
00:29:02,882 --> 00:29:04,182
to say something like, okay, you know what,

771
00:29:04,182 --> 00:29:06,903
I've been doing XYZ a lot, I love you as a client.

772
00:29:07,224 --> 00:29:10,947
my rates are increasing to this number for clients now,

773
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:12,148
but I'm gonna give you this much

774
00:29:12,148 --> 00:29:13,369
because you're such a trusted client.

775
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:15,310
Let me know if that works for you.

776
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,192
If it doesn't, I'd be happy to recommend someone else

777
00:29:17,192 --> 00:29:20,114
who can do this work for you at a different rate.

778
00:29:20,114 --> 00:29:22,356
Because that can give you good karma

779
00:29:22,356 --> 00:29:23,617
and they'll love you for it.

780
00:29:23,617 --> 00:29:25,098
Even if you can't work with them anymore

781
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:27,160
and you recommend someone, they'll be like, oh, thank you.

782
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,802
And maybe help get someone else into the biz,

783
00:29:28,802 --> 00:29:31,104
like hey, here's someone who's starting out.

784
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:32,144
I met him at a networking.

785
00:29:32,685 --> 00:29:33,105
Exactly.

786
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,227
And basically, you become Google to them, where they'll

787
00:29:35,227 --> 00:29:36,628
keep coming to you for references.

788
00:29:36,628 --> 00:29:38,709
They will not cut you off if you give some sort of

789
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:39,109
reference.

790
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:41,051
You are kind of the person machine at that point.

791
00:29:41,051 --> 00:29:41,691
Like, oh, who else?

792
00:29:41,691 --> 00:29:42,031
Who else?

793
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:42,312
Who else?

794
00:29:42,312 --> 00:29:42,812
Oh my god.

795
00:29:42,812 --> 00:29:44,293
Oh, we'd love to work with you again.

796
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:45,334
It works really well.

797
00:29:45,334 --> 00:29:45,454
OK.

798
00:29:45,454 --> 00:29:50,497
And real quick, just as a comment about working a side

799
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:55,421
job, it helped me when I got started to pick the clients I

800
00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:56,682
wanted to work with.

801
00:29:56,682 --> 00:29:59,544
I didn't have to worry about taking every job.

802
00:30:00,608 --> 00:30:01,208
to pay the bills.

803
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:03,229
Yes, you didn't have to worry about terrible clients.

804
00:30:03,229 --> 00:30:05,731
Yeah, you learn more and you get better at your craft.

805
00:30:05,731 --> 00:30:06,151
Perfect.

806
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:08,573
Thank you.

807
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,514
Akash, thank you so much for your presentation.

808
00:30:10,514 --> 00:30:15,076
So you specifically mentioned 24 hours as the follow-up time.

809
00:30:15,076 --> 00:30:17,218
Have you ever bent that rule?

810
00:30:17,218 --> 00:30:18,418
Oh yeah, sometimes I have,

811
00:30:18,418 --> 00:30:22,721
but I've gotten so much better results within 24 hours.

812
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:25,082
Because they remember you much, much easier.

813
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:28,024
And a little trick, the reason I do the 24 hours thing,

814
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:29,925
I never forget their name once I do that.

815
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:32,446
If I follow up within 24 hours, I remember who they are.

816
00:30:32,446 --> 00:30:34,567
I literally never forget their name.

817
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:36,147
I remember their dog's name.

818
00:30:36,147 --> 00:30:36,888
I remember everything.

819
00:30:36,888 --> 00:30:39,169
And when I see them in three years, I'm like,

820
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:40,529
oh, you're still at Google?

821
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:41,189
How's your dog Coco?

822
00:30:41,189 --> 00:30:41,509
All this stuff.

823
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:42,170
They're like, what?

824
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,370
How do you remember this?

825
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,431
It's purely because I followed up within 24 hours.

826
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:48,372
So there's a lot working there behind the scenes too.

827
00:30:48,372 --> 00:30:49,112
It works really well.

828
00:30:49,112 --> 00:30:50,232
Okay, thank you.

829
00:30:50,232 --> 00:30:51,133
Yeah, you're welcome.

830
00:30:53,828 --> 00:30:54,549
Hey, how's it going?

831
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:55,530
Hello, hey.

832
00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:00,294
I'm actually a lawyer, so I really appreciated you bringing up that contract aspect.

833
00:31:00,294 --> 00:31:00,834
Yes, sweet.

834
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:04,757
And I've worked with a lot of people who are just starting out, they've never read a contract

835
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:08,120
before, so I was hoping that for the benefit of the audience, you could say a few words

836
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:13,004
about any kind of cautionary tale, like you didn't think you needed to do something, and

837
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:17,768
then you had some kind of kerfuffle, and now you've learned from a mistake.

838
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,652
Yeah, perfect. So thankfully I've been using contracts from the

839
00:31:20,652 --> 00:31:22,475
beginning, but I can share a general story. I won't name

840
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:24,397
names or anything like that. But I've seen a lot

841
00:31:24,397 --> 00:31:27,961
of friends who didn't have a contract. They say like,

842
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:29,342
oh, it's just a handshake deal. It'll be fine,

843
00:31:29,342 --> 00:31:31,385
it'll be fine, it'll be fine. The game tanks. It

844
00:31:31,385 --> 00:31:33,647
doesn't come out. Who owns the music? Who owns the

845
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:34,648
sound? How do you know?

846
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:37,291
If they had a contract, it would go right back to them.

847
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:38,452
It'd be no problem.

848
00:31:38,452 --> 00:31:41,996
But unfortunately, it was completely unclear, and

849
00:31:41,996 --> 00:31:44,418
someone I know actually had to go through some legal issues.

850
00:31:44,418 --> 00:31:46,540
And it turns out, no, the client owned it.

851
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,141
There's no contract.

852
00:31:47,141 --> 00:31:47,621
So use one.

853
00:31:47,621 --> 00:31:49,883
It's very useful.

00:31:49,883 --> 00:31:53,147
All right, so our time is out, unfortunately, for today.

855
00:31:53,147 --> 00:31:54,168
But I will be hanging out.

856
00:31:54,168 --> 00:31:55,449
So thank you so much for coming.

857
00:31:55,449 --> 00:31:58,272
Give me your cards and all that sort of good stuff as well.

858
00:31:58,272 --> 00:31:58,692
Thank you.
