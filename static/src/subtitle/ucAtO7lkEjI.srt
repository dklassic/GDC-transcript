1
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:07,282
Thanks for being here.

2
00:00:07,302 --> 00:00:09,413
I appreciate you all.

3
00:00:09,433 --> 00:00:10,740
I appreciate you wanting to.

4
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:15,170
Develop and improve your skills as producers.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,753
And I will do my best to pay some justice to this topic.

6
00:00:21,593 --> 00:00:23,674
Communication is a huge, huge, huge topic.

7
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:26,696
And it's important to me.

8
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:27,776
It should be important to all of us.

9
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:30,178
So I was happy to come and be able to participate.

10
00:00:30,418 --> 00:00:32,079
But I don't know if anybody could really do it full

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,621
justice, so we'll give it our best shot.

12
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,942
Just a couple points of order here.

13
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:40,483
One, please make sure that your phones are on vibrate.

14
00:00:40,524 --> 00:00:41,464
I'm sure you've already done that.

15
00:00:42,307 --> 00:00:45,789
Uh, two, uh, we, we take the reviews,

16
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:47,889
uh, all the speaker reviews very seriously.

17
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:51,250
So, um, please fill that out at, at the end of the talk.

18
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,652
Um, or you can take a guess what it'll be and do it now.

19
00:00:54,672 --> 00:00:57,193
Uh, either way, just please make sure

20
00:00:57,213 --> 00:00:58,433
that you, that you turn those in.

21
00:00:59,353 --> 00:01:01,614
Um, and, uh, and thanks very much.

22
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:05,677
to you guys for being here.

23
00:01:05,897 --> 00:01:07,698
So Producer Boot Camp.

24
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:09,640
Boy, I remember, um,

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,962
I used to come to producer talks here at GDC,

26
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:15,684
uh, actually when it was down, uh,

27
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:19,527
about, uh, what, 40 miles south of here,

28
00:01:20,528 --> 00:01:22,790
um, years ago when we would all get together

29
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,830
in the Fairmont ballroom.

30
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:25,211
And, uh...

31
00:01:25,904 --> 00:01:27,025
and be kind of naughty.

32
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,406
It was a much smaller industry then,

33
00:01:29,027 --> 00:01:30,988
and we had, uh, we had smaller teams,

34
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:34,131
and communication was a problem then,

35
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:36,273
and, uh, it's still a problem now,

36
00:01:36,353 --> 00:01:37,534
but sometimes we get it right,

37
00:01:37,594 --> 00:01:38,895
and when we do, great things happen.

38
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:42,238
I'm head of production

39
00:01:42,338 --> 00:01:44,259
and executive producer at Gearbox Software.

40
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,060
My name's Aaron Thibault.

41
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,421
I also teach from time to time.

42
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:48,723
I'm teaching this semester a capstone class at Baylor.

43
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,625
I've been in education for a while,

44
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:52,666
so I love, uh, talking about things

45
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:53,807
that I get to learn more about.

46
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:57,794
So first on communication,

47
00:01:58,796 --> 00:02:00,459
game development's hard, right.

48
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,442
We know, or we're learning, that game development

49
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:03,684
is really, really, really hard.

50
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:05,326
One of the hardest things about it

51
00:02:06,027 --> 00:02:06,729
is communication.

52
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:13,406
Now, I like to learn, I read books, I find material on communication so I can improve

53
00:02:13,906 --> 00:02:17,507
my skills in communication with the teams that I work with and the people that I interact

54
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:17,647
with.

55
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:20,848
I do that all the time, and hopefully you're doing that all the time also.

56
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:26,529
One of the books that has held up for a long time for me, and he's written more material

57
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:32,771
than this on things having to do with trust and truths, is this one, Seven Habits of Highly

58
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:33,471
Effective People.

59
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:37,273
In it, one of those habits that he points out is communication.

60
00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:39,895
Seek first to understand, then be understood.

61
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:44,939
And he makes the point that our whole lives...

62
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:49,295
We're spending time speaking and writing,

63
00:02:49,395 --> 00:02:51,037
and in our classes in school,

64
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:52,879
we learn how to communicate outward.

65
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,140
We're broadcasting.

66
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,663
We learn a lot about broadcasting messages,

67
00:02:56,703 --> 00:02:57,684
things that we care about,

68
00:02:57,724 --> 00:02:59,426
because we assume a lot of people care about

69
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:00,667
what we care about,

70
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:02,128
so we want to tell them all about it.

71
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:03,930
But we don't spend a lot of time listening.

72
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,872
And most of what we do as producers,

73
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:07,273
or what we should be doing as producers,

74
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,835
is listening and observing

75
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,296
and gaining situational awareness.

76
00:03:11,387 --> 00:03:15,129
really cluing in to what's happening with our projects and our teams and

77
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,111
if you're on the development side with the publisher and vice versa

78
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:19,753
if you're a publisher.

79
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:23,675
We don't spend nearly enough time really synthesizing the information that's

80
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:24,316
coming to us.

81
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:27,118
So we really have to develop our skills in listening.

82
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:28,899
And it's a practice.

83
00:03:32,052 --> 00:03:34,353
So since this is sort of an overview of communication,

84
00:03:34,393 --> 00:03:36,833
I'll just cover a couple of basic topics,

85
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:39,454
things that you've probably heard many times in school,

86
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:41,334
but it doesn't hurt to refresh our memory.

87
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:44,155
Here are some things that are barriers to communication,

88
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:45,875
just generally, just broadly.

89
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:47,576
These are broad principles,

90
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:52,457
things that can impede good communication between people.

91
00:03:54,637 --> 00:03:55,898
So physical barriers.

92
00:03:57,752 --> 00:04:01,174
Nowadays, it's not uncommon at all to work with

93
00:04:01,214 --> 00:04:03,115
teams who are on the other side of the world.

94
00:04:06,116 --> 00:04:08,978
Very often, we work in buildings where we may

95
00:04:09,038 --> 00:04:11,399
not see other people who are in the building

96
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,061
with us for days, weeks, months. I was talking

97
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,583
to one of our producers last night who said

98
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:19,284
he got to meet one of our animators

99
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:20,565
for the first time. He said, how long have

100
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:22,166
you been here? He assumed it was maybe a

101
00:04:22,206 --> 00:04:23,606
month or two. Two years.

102
00:04:25,187 --> 00:04:27,148
So, it's funny how long...

103
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,103
time can go by for that we don't interact with others who

104
00:04:31,423 --> 00:04:33,225
are actually working on the same project with us,

105
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:34,846
or on other projects near us.

106
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:38,269
Choice of the wrong medium.

107
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:40,010
We do this all the time.

108
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:40,971
What's one of the,

109
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:43,553
what's one of those mediums that we use all the time

110
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:45,755
where we probably should have chosen some other medium?

111
00:04:47,316 --> 00:04:47,476
Hmm?

112
00:04:48,677 --> 00:04:49,578
Email, for sure.

113
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,220
That's a, that's like low-hanging fruit, right?

114
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:55,443
All the time we use email for things that we shouldn't be using email for.

115
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,215
Semantic barriers are language.

116
00:04:58,655 --> 00:05:01,237
We use a word that somebody else takes an exception to.

117
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:05,239
That sort of stops their, the flow of communication,

118
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:05,839
they're listening.

119
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,201
Might stop you from talking.

120
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,542
Cultural barriers, some of these are pretty obvious,

121
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:11,983
I won't go too deep into these,

122
00:05:12,023 --> 00:05:13,544
just, it's good to be aware of these things.

123
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:17,566
Psychological barriers is one of the biggest ones, actually,

124
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:19,827
because you can only ever control...

125
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:23,990
yourself, the communication that you're providing and the listening that you're doing,

126
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,371
you can never control anyone else, right?

127
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:31,312
So, psychological and attitudinal barriers, while they might frustrate us,

128
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,833
they might be things that we're aware we have to pay attention to,

129
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:38,313
it's one of those things that makes communication hard,

130
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:41,394
because we can't force the other person to really hear our message.

131
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:45,455
All we can do is a better job on our end of conveying it

132
00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:48,216
and being aware if they're getting it or not.

133
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:51,450
in varying perceptions of reality,

134
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:54,933
which are caused by levels of understanding and comprehension.

135
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:56,974
So everybody has a different view, a different filter

136
00:05:57,415 --> 00:06:00,377
that they use to see the world and to see projects.

137
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:02,719
And some people might think game development's easy

138
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:04,820
or should be easy, and some people think it's hard.

139
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:07,302
And it should be hard if you want to do a good job.

140
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:09,824
There's a lot of different ideas

141
00:06:10,665 --> 00:06:13,327
of what game development is and what it's not.

142
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:15,248
Nobody shares one.

143
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:17,550
People don't share one idea of that.

144
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:19,738
It's important to know where the other person's coming from.

145
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,201
And it's really easy for us just to assume it's the other person.

146
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:27,902
We have to get through that.

147
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:30,483
And it comes up all the time.

148
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:34,205
And at Gearbox, with the people that we work with,

149
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:36,306
our partners inside the company,

150
00:06:36,326 --> 00:06:38,627
you always have to kind of just pause for a second.

151
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:42,109
And think about, is this quality issue

152
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:43,530
something that this person...

153
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:45,941
You know, did they do this on purpose?

154
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:47,623
Was it a timing issue?

155
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:50,947
Am I saying something where

156
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:53,830
they already have built up a wall to it

157
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:55,432
and I wasn't aware of that?

158
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:56,534
What's going on there?

159
00:06:56,854 --> 00:06:58,997
And you must encounter these things all the time,

160
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:00,438
I would guess, if you're making games.

161
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:04,383
So, the description of the talk...

162
00:07:05,732 --> 00:07:08,772
is about communication being the bane of all postmortems.

163
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:11,353
Well, I'm, I'm really sad that Game Developer Magazine's

164
00:07:11,373 --> 00:07:13,053
not still published in the way it used to be,

165
00:07:13,113 --> 00:07:15,634
although we still see great articles on Gamasutra.

166
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:20,595
But one of the articles that, as producers,

167
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:25,596
we always enjoyed looking for were these postmortems.

168
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:29,877
And the reason I say communication's the bane

169
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,718
of all postmortems is because you just waited for it.

170
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:37,051
You waited for that team, the person who's writing that article,

171
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:40,533
that postmortem, to say communication was one of the top problems.

172
00:07:40,913 --> 00:07:42,894
Every time. And if they didn't, you called them a liar.

173
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:48,177
Especially because you were probably having those problems.

174
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:49,138
Well,

175
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,641
in this particular issue, which was

176
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:57,202
at the beginning of 09, I think,

177
00:07:59,104 --> 00:07:59,884
Brandon Sheffield.

178
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,452
wrote up just a quick recap of some things

179
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:07,213
that he'd run into, or he'd come across in postmortems.

180
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:10,013
And it kind of sets the tone, I think,

181
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:11,554
just that over and over again,

182
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:14,595
we come across these same issues.

183
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:18,176
So Penny Arcade.

184
00:08:19,496 --> 00:08:22,037
They simply fail to employ best practices,

185
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:24,097
which are things that you agree in communication

186
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:24,837
amongst each other,

187
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:26,998
are things that you should be doing

188
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:28,298
so that you don't have to have

189
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,592
more formal rules. They're, they're guidelines for you to

190
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:35,274
follow. And you set these in agreement with the

191
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,896
team, because these are the things that are gonna

192
00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:39,537
keep your project from going off the rails.

193
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:43,719
They, they knew better. They simply failed to employ

194
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,460
best practices. How often does it happen? I know

195
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,924
it happens pretty often. Happens at Gearbox. I know

196
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,946
from developer friends I've talked to, it happens throughout

197
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:56,106
the industry. We just forget.

198
00:08:58,691 --> 00:08:59,371
At Harmonix.

199
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:01,593
On Guitar Hero.

200
00:09:02,874 --> 00:09:03,134
Well...

201
00:09:05,776 --> 00:09:07,157
they created an early schedule.

202
00:09:07,577 --> 00:09:09,639
They had a communication plan for how they would go

203
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:10,660
about making the game.

204
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:12,901
And then what happened?

205
00:09:13,642 --> 00:09:16,984
As things went along, they forgot to keep up-to-date

206
00:09:17,044 --> 00:09:18,585
with specification of what they were doing.

207
00:09:19,546 --> 00:09:23,168
So if you're aware of the PMBOK,

208
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:26,171
or the Project Management Institute's guide

209
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:27,391
on how to do project management...

210
00:09:28,796 --> 00:09:31,477
PMI tends to avoid talking about Agile development.

211
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:34,299
At least, I don't see PMI talking a lot about Agile.

212
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,181
They use other language to talk about

213
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:41,043
more traditional approaches to project management,

214
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:43,905
which still fit within an Agile structure.

215
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,626
One of those, they talk about a rolling wave.

216
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:48,765
And that's a common theme.

217
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,425
And in communication as a producer,

218
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:54,687
you have to be ready to catch the project as it moves along,

219
00:09:54,847 --> 00:09:57,668
the idea of the sort of rolling wave in development,

220
00:09:58,148 --> 00:10:00,629
to stay on top of the wave and to continue

221
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:04,670
to bring ideas and specifications back

222
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,851
into the project so that it can be tasked properly

223
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:07,971
and be broken down.

224
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:09,612
If you're running an agile project,

225
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:12,533
then you're breaking down epic stories into smaller stories.

226
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:15,153
The smaller that you get in the story, the better spec,

227
00:10:15,193 --> 00:10:16,514
the better it can be estimated.

228
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:18,998
They just sort of forgot to do that.

229
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,280
Max Hoberman, great developer, developed multiplayer for Halo.

230
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,641
Went off and made his own studio, Certain Affinity.

231
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:34,221
He was used to open pit environments, open communication.

232
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:35,682
Had a passion project.

233
00:10:35,742 --> 00:10:37,362
Age of Booty was their original IP.

234
00:10:38,582 --> 00:10:42,663
Even in that environment, they forgot that their teams

235
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:44,103
had to communicate with each other.

236
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:46,704
They didn't have a formal tasking plan.

237
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,475
for how they would ensure that dependencies worked out

238
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:51,858
between those teams.

239
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,203
It ended up costing them a lot of time and money.

240
00:10:57,206 --> 00:10:59,971
And I won't, I won't go on and on on each of these for now.

241
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:05,114
But Brandon says, a lot of these issues have to do

242
00:11:05,134 --> 00:11:06,394
with scheduling and communication,

243
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:09,136
which in turn has to do with the quality of producers.

244
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,917
And I'm really heartened to see you all here

245
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:14,258
because I know you want to be quality producers.

246
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,179
Not everyone can be here right now.

247
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:19,260
It just shows your interest, though,

248
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,480
in furthering your careers.

249
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:25,363
And these have to be things that we remind ourselves of

250
00:11:25,403 --> 00:11:27,403
all the time, to be quality producers.

251
00:11:29,945 --> 00:11:31,005
But we just run into these.

252
00:11:31,085 --> 00:11:31,585
Thanks, Brandon.

253
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:34,004
in postmortems all the time.

254
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:36,624
So what are the kinds of things that we can do

255
00:11:36,704 --> 00:11:38,605
to make sure that we're learning from these mistakes?

256
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:42,666
And how do we use communication

257
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:46,387
to reinforce with the team that we have learned something

258
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:48,847
and that we're going to get better?

259
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:51,348
And that it won't happen again.

260
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:53,709
Well, sprint retrospectives.

261
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:56,209
How many of you here are employing an agile methodology

262
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:57,770
in your studio or in your development environment?

263
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:05,419
many of you. How many of you are not? Specifically not? Okay. So for those of you who, one or

264
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,921
two, but for the most part, for those of you who didn't raise your hand, either you're

265
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:14,224
not sure or you're looking to get into development, you've heard maybe a lot about Agile and you've

266
00:12:14,244 --> 00:12:19,268
heard about other methodologies. Sprint retrospectives are a great way to make sure that you're actually

267
00:12:19,308 --> 00:12:24,291
absorbing these best practices and that you are culturally building up, up

268
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,166
a good way of talking to each other on your teams

269
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:33,930
so that you avoid wasting effort and having angry developers around you.

270
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,712
And in those sprint retrospectives, you have to talk about

271
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:40,094
things that you need to start doing, things that you need to stop doing,

272
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:44,657
and things that are going pretty good, continue, will observe, good so far.

273
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:47,158
That's a really useful team discussion.

274
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:50,140
Now there's also a thing called an AAR.

275
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,321
This comes from military training.

276
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,033
We use it, some people call it a mid-mortem.

277
00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:58,623
It's really similar to a mid-mortem.

278
00:12:58,924 --> 00:13:00,049
Okay.

279
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:04,495
Difference here, though, is where a sprint retrospective

280
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,316
tends to be, at least in my experience,

281
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:09,099
I'm sure many of you probably have different experiences,

282
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:11,260
but my experience usually is a big discussion.

283
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:13,923
And if you as the producer are there,

284
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:16,184
you may be sort of guiding people through it

285
00:13:16,224 --> 00:13:17,325
if you've collected topics,

286
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:18,867
or guiding your way through those topics.

287
00:13:20,027 --> 00:13:22,229
An AAR tends to be more of a coaching moment

288
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:23,710
for you as a producer,

289
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:26,573
or someone who's senior in your organization

290
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:28,354
to ensure that, in fact...

291
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:31,178
learning really, this is your moment to say,

292
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:33,121
have you really got it?

293
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:35,805
The person who's on your team when you're talking to them

294
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:37,788
and you can be in a group environment,

295
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:41,173
you can break up your teams into smaller groups

296
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:43,096
to really focus that conversation.

297
00:13:43,396 --> 00:13:44,678
But that after action review.

298
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:49,031
That's about performance in the team context.

299
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:52,573
How is your performance as a developer,

300
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:53,794
this is a tool for you to use,

301
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,995
how is your performance as a developer,

302
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:58,016
how is that with what we were trying

303
00:13:58,036 --> 00:13:59,037
to accomplish on the team?

304
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:02,179
It's not coaching like performance review coaching.

305
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,140
It's not the kind of thing,

306
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,941
so one of the problems is we don't always coach people

307
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:06,682
at the right moments.

308
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:09,003
We wait until they're way off the deep end,

309
00:14:10,044 --> 00:14:11,905
and they've sunk morale of everybody around them,

310
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:15,848
and we waited until that moment to coach them.

311
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,761
in good behaviors. Don't wait. Do this all the time.

312
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,342
I drop into offices around the studio all the time

313
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:25,182
to see how things are going, but also I've heard

314
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:29,203
something about the possibility of a problem, and I just

315
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,063
want to go see what's up.

316
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:34,945
Or I've heard something where someone's performance is starting

317
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:38,565
to lag, and I ask that person's lead to go

318
00:14:38,605 --> 00:14:40,126
follow up. Just spend more time with them.

319
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:43,066
If you guys are familiar with the Hawthorne effect.

320
00:14:44,824 --> 00:14:51,027
There was a social science experiment years ago where in time series studies they wanted

321
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:54,249
to see if there was a way to have more productivity in factories.

322
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:04,515
And they set up a test in a factory and they had a survey set up where the scientists would

323
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:05,575
walk around and ask questions.

324
00:15:05,595 --> 00:15:07,556
It was a survey of people who were working on the floor.

325
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:14,482
They wanted to see if lighting conditions would change productivity in that factory.

326
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:16,204
Well, productivity increased.

327
00:15:17,363 --> 00:15:21,346
And at first they believed that the correlation was directly to these new conditions in the factory.

328
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:25,810
And later they realized that it probably had a lot to do with,

329
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,552
in fact they discovered it did have a lot to do with just that interaction of people,

330
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:32,295
of those scientists walking around asking questions on the floor.

331
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:37,259
The Hawthorne effect has to do with changing the outcome of an experiment

332
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:41,702
simply by holding it and getting involved in the subjects of that experiment.

333
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,793
So we know that interaction with people who are around us

334
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:48,334
is gonna improve their performance

335
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:49,294
because they know that you care.

336
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:52,796
What you have to do is then turn that into data

337
00:15:53,137 --> 00:15:54,538
and turn that into specification,

338
00:15:54,598 --> 00:15:56,419
turn that into things that you're actually tracking

339
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:57,740
to know the health of your project.

340
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:05,104
Maintaining best practices is hard.

341
00:16:05,124 --> 00:16:06,725
This is part of why communication's hard.

342
00:16:07,086 --> 00:16:08,567
Maintenance is a hard thing.

343
00:16:08,587 --> 00:16:10,468
You gotta roll up your sleeves, you have to go do it.

344
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:14,215
It's hard, so a lot of times it just doesn't get done.

345
00:16:15,296 --> 00:16:19,237
But if you want to have a great postmortem and a great AAR,

346
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:21,017
if you want to be aware of what's happening in your project,

347
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:23,698
you have to develop situational awareness and keep it.

348
00:16:23,998 --> 00:16:24,858
You can't let it go,

349
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:27,299
because your project and your team changes all the time.

350
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:29,720
Dynamics change, your project's changing,

351
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,940
what's the status of it?

352
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,081
Don't just go asking people for status updates.

353
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:33,921
You have to know.

354
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:34,781
And if you don't know,

355
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:36,402
if you don't know, you're not doing your job.

356
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:38,422
Frequency has to be high,

357
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:39,763
and you have to be vigilant about it.

358
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,470
Eons ago, I was working on a project,

359
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:50,232
and the producer on that project realized

360
00:16:50,312 --> 00:16:53,673
that there weren't enough touch points with the team

361
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:56,093
and wanted to improve processes,

362
00:16:56,153 --> 00:16:57,254
wanted to do things differently

363
00:16:57,574 --> 00:16:59,454
from how this particular studio I was working at

364
00:16:59,814 --> 00:17:00,855
was doing things at the time.

365
00:17:01,995 --> 00:17:05,556
So that person wanted to institute mid-mortems,

366
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:06,756
very reasonable,

367
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:09,917
told the leads that...

368
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:13,875
Now we were going to have updates regularly.

369
00:17:13,895 --> 00:17:16,538
And these were going to be built around

370
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,181
essentially sprints.

371
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:21,082
We didn't call them sprints.

372
00:17:21,563 --> 00:17:23,485
We knew that it was time to crunch a little bit.

373
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:25,787
And we didn't want to use the word crunch.

374
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:30,011
And we came up with a different word.

375
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:32,574
I'm saying we generously.

376
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:34,895
But a different word was used.

377
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:37,015
And that word was surge.

378
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:38,136
So we're going to surge ahead.

379
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,577
This period of time, we're going to surge ahead.

380
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:43,217
And then at the end of this surge,

381
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:45,018
we're going to get together and talk about how it went.

382
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:47,619
And then we're going to improve.

383
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:51,900
So at the end of the surge, people have been crunching a bit.

384
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:54,358
They had some goals that they'd started with.

385
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:55,699
They got together.

386
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:58,121
The whole team, the leads had been tasked

387
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:00,722
with gathering up information from their team members

388
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:01,783
about how things went.

389
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:04,965
They got together, big room like this,

390
00:18:06,206 --> 00:18:07,566
and the leads came up one by one,

391
00:18:08,707 --> 00:18:12,349
and they wrote on a board what their top items were,

392
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,952
and they all agreed on what the number one thing

393
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:17,473
was that they could fix for the next time.

394
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:18,433
Well, guess what?

395
00:18:19,594 --> 00:18:21,755
First one, number one thing, communication.

396
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,195
Big letters on the board.

397
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:26,336
Cool, we'll fix it.

398
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:28,317
It went away.

399
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:30,178
Another surge.

400
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:33,680
Took goals from that first one, went into the next one,

401
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:36,982
had that next AAR.

402
00:18:38,763 --> 00:18:39,343
Same thing.

403
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:40,964
Communication.

404
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:41,945
Big letters.

405
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:43,085
Number one thing.

406
00:18:45,326 --> 00:18:47,227
At this point, I was starting to worry a little bit, just

407
00:18:47,267 --> 00:18:49,889
that, you know, I don't know how the team's thinking about

408
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:50,429
this, but.

409
00:18:51,574 --> 00:18:54,776
you know, let it go. See, see how that works out.

410
00:18:57,718 --> 00:18:59,519
At that point, I wasn't in the same role

411
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,541
that I'm in now. Although, I did speak with

412
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:04,302
that producer a bit about some concerns that I

413
00:19:04,322 --> 00:19:04,442
had.

414
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:11,566
Third time. What do you suppose happened? Well, here's

415
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:16,689
what. As the lead started coming up, that producer

416
00:19:16,729 --> 00:19:19,971
said, but this time you can't say communication.

417
00:19:22,492 --> 00:19:23,513
So the leads looked around and said,

418
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:24,874
we're good.

419
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:26,575
Everything's great.

420
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:28,477
Let's go back.

421
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:30,358
That project shut down two weeks later.

422
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,682
Communication's hard, and if you don't do something

423
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:38,524
about it, you're gonna fail.

424
00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:42,727
And this is how we felt.

425
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,830
So you can't ignore it.

426
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:50,953
Here's a good best practice.

427
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:54,799
By the way, I tend to like to bounce around a bit.

428
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,863
So, for those of you who were in the talk I did last year,

429
00:20:00,624 --> 00:20:02,045
thank you for coming back this year.

430
00:20:03,246 --> 00:20:05,408
And for those who weren't, I'm just letting you know ahead of time,

431
00:20:05,428 --> 00:20:07,069
I like to move around a bit.

432
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,372
So, saying I don't know is a best practice. I love that.

433
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:13,635
This is how I'm looking for, when I look for new producers to work with.

434
00:20:14,475 --> 00:20:16,717
And I listen for how much experience people have

435
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:17,938
when they say, I don't know,

436
00:20:17,978 --> 00:20:19,679
because I say, I don't know all the time.

437
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:22,661
You can't possibly, this industry's moving so fast,

438
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:24,763
and the things that we do are so complex.

439
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:26,164
You have to say, I don't know sometimes.

440
00:20:27,545 --> 00:20:29,466
I don't know why anyone would try to fool us

441
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:30,507
by saying that they do know

442
00:20:30,547 --> 00:20:32,348
or by indicating they know more than they do.

443
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:34,830
But this is also how you gather up information

444
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,733
to improve and to schedule and to work with your team.

445
00:20:38,793 --> 00:20:39,393
So look for that.

446
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:41,355
You should value those simple words.

447
00:20:45,531 --> 00:20:47,152
Especially so we can avoid a death march.

448
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:51,455
You guys recognize this graph? It's pretty well-known.

449
00:20:51,475 --> 00:20:54,237
Okay. Well,

450
00:20:56,498 --> 00:20:59,320
this is considered to be, at least Tufte,

451
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,262
who, whose opinion I, I trust,

452
00:21:03,422 --> 00:21:05,904
says this is probably the best infographic ever made

453
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:07,885
by Charles Menard.

454
00:21:10,393 --> 00:21:14,776
And this is an infographic about Napoleon's army's march

455
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:17,437
into Russia, into Moscow.

456
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:22,700
And what you see is the line that starts out

457
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,003
quite broad on top and gets progressively narrower

458
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:28,924
to the right as it approaches Moscow

459
00:21:29,484 --> 00:21:34,507
is the number of troops still in Napoleon's campaign.

460
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:37,509
And then that black line on the way back

461
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,610
is the continued death march home.

462
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:45,584
And the graphics that you see here are about distance.

463
00:21:45,744 --> 00:21:46,664
They're about temperature.

464
00:21:46,684 --> 00:21:48,485
You can see temperature charted in the bottom.

465
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:52,746
They're about latitude and longitude.

466
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:56,447
And they tell a pretty stark story.

467
00:21:58,268 --> 00:22:04,230
Well, if Napoleon knew in advance that this is what the

468
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,931
outcome would be, would he have still engaged his troops?

469
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:08,431
I don't know.

470
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:09,912
If he thought he'd won, maybe.

471
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:11,143
Hard to say.

472
00:22:12,984 --> 00:22:17,488
This cost him his future in France

473
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:19,870
to become the great emperor that he was looking to be.

474
00:22:21,752 --> 00:22:23,073
And as an infographic,

475
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:25,535
it's very interesting.

476
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,218
I want to make the point that, as producers,

477
00:22:29,678 --> 00:22:32,160
we use graphs all the time

478
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:33,762
to communicate things.

479
00:22:34,651 --> 00:22:42,200
We use Gantt charts and burndowns and build fancy things in Excel to show the relationship.

480
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,883
You know, we try to break things down to make them as simple as we can be.

481
00:22:45,944 --> 00:22:50,589
I think we probably still haven't gotten quite as elegant as what we see here,

482
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,871
but I'd encourage you to think about...

483
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:58,254
breaking away from a rigid practice

484
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:00,555
of how you display information,

485
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:02,296
especially quantitative information,

486
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,097
to the teams that you work with.

487
00:23:04,737 --> 00:23:06,698
They're looking for something that distills

488
00:23:06,738 --> 00:23:08,278
the essence of where the project is.

489
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:10,399
That's all we really care about at any time

490
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,061
is where is the project, where is it going to be,

491
00:23:13,321 --> 00:23:14,641
especially at the executive level.

492
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:17,322
Is this project going to be worth more than it costs

493
00:23:17,482 --> 00:23:19,483
by whatever number the P&L says it should be?

494
00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:23,651
you can convey that in ways that

495
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:25,992
show the attitude of your project

496
00:23:26,312 --> 00:23:27,954
and the quality of the game that you're making.

497
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,597
So just think about ways that you can visualize that data

498
00:23:34,398 --> 00:23:37,541
that will really come across to the audience you have

499
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:41,323
in a way that conveys the heart of what makes your game special.

500
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:48,629
Discipline, organization, and maturity are not things

501
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:50,271
that we always found in the game industry.

502
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:53,013
But I think we're doing a lot better job of that now,

503
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:56,736
broadly, as game developers have gotten

504
00:23:57,176 --> 00:23:58,878
really experienced and mature over the years.

505
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,880
And we should value the wisdom of those that have been around.

506
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,042
But discipline is hard.

507
00:24:05,183 --> 00:24:06,664
Organization can be hard,

508
00:24:07,124 --> 00:24:11,688
especially for it to not feel overly bureaucratic,

509
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:13,410
an environment that's looking for creativity.

510
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:14,751
And maturity.

511
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:18,227
I don't know much to say about maturity other than we value it.

512
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,790
In this postmortem,

513
00:24:26,851 --> 00:24:29,632
this was a good game that came out last year,

514
00:24:29,672 --> 00:24:30,312
Lords of the Fallen.

515
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:33,934
This team looks back and thinks,

516
00:24:34,254 --> 00:24:35,815
we're not really sure how we made that game,

517
00:24:37,115 --> 00:24:38,736
given the problems we had going into it.

518
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,771
And they make the point that something they were really looking for,

519
00:24:44,491 --> 00:24:45,731
when they realized they needed it,

520
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:47,512
was a person.

521
00:24:47,532 --> 00:24:48,912
They were looking for a person

522
00:24:50,052 --> 00:24:51,753
to come in and ask the tough questions

523
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:54,993
and make the production decisions that needed to be made

524
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:56,334
because they as a team

525
00:24:57,234 --> 00:24:58,414
had a very difficult time

526
00:24:59,194 --> 00:25:00,574
pulling things out of the game,

527
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,135
cutting things out.

528
00:25:04,515 --> 00:25:07,716
And this really caught my eye.

529
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:14,291
I don't know what happens on a project to get to the point where the publisher is now

530
00:25:14,351 --> 00:25:17,013
coming in heavily and creative.

531
00:25:17,053 --> 00:25:21,995
They talk about the publisher at this point is actually doing level design, is doing map

532
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:22,975
design and mission design.

533
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:32,280
Something's happened in that crazy, chaotic environment where those tough questions aren't

534
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,781
being asked, where the publisher now is having a creative role.

535
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:39,246
certainly beyond whatever they thought they were signing up to in the beginning,

536
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:41,928
and not enough communication has been happening.

537
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,392
So somebody needed to come in and create some structure.

538
00:25:45,953 --> 00:25:50,998
And every studio environment, you need structure to give people the trust

539
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,902
that things are going the way they should, to be making a good game.

540
00:25:55,242 --> 00:25:58,426
So I say basically they had not thought about establishing those guidelines for communication.

541
00:25:59,562 --> 00:26:01,904
And once they got the right person in the environment,

542
00:26:02,265 --> 00:26:04,247
that stopped crazy communication happening

543
00:26:04,627 --> 00:26:05,989
between the publisher and the developer

544
00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:07,851
and employing channel people.

545
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:13,877
Now, every good organization,

546
00:26:14,177 --> 00:26:16,860
it's clear who has responsibility and authority for what.

547
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:18,021
So...

548
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:25,403
you should know who in your team is talking with the person on the other side,

549
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:28,004
if you're working in that developer-publisher relationship.

550
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:29,605
If you're self-funded, cool.

551
00:26:29,905 --> 00:26:33,187
At least then, though, you should be understanding more about who the customer is,

552
00:26:34,068 --> 00:26:35,108
where are you going to market,

553
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:40,011
if you're having that sort of direct interaction with customers.

554
00:26:41,672 --> 00:26:44,173
And in that sense, I mean customers who are buying the game.

555
00:26:46,515 --> 00:26:49,456
You have to really understand the structure though, and if you don't,

556
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:51,517
go make sure that you do.

557
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:54,219
Start asking hard questions about who's responsible for

558
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:58,281
which parts of communication with finance, with publishing, with marketing.

559
00:27:01,242 --> 00:27:02,923
But information's not going to move by itself.

560
00:27:02,963 --> 00:27:03,743
You have to do things.

561
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,641
The problem that I've seen time and time again

562
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:10,562
is simply people not getting out of their chairs.

563
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:14,023
So you can lead by example to get up, walk around.

564
00:27:14,063 --> 00:27:15,324
As I said, I do that all the time.

565
00:27:15,784 --> 00:27:17,145
Just by you getting up and walking around,

566
00:27:17,205 --> 00:27:19,666
you can show you don't have to be stuck in your chair all day.

567
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:21,787
But also, some people need some prodding.

568
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:24,168
You want to do that if the information that they have

569
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:25,009
is vital to others.

570
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,491
For example, there may be a rendering programmer,

571
00:27:29,511 --> 00:27:30,431
a graphics programmer,

572
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:32,973
who's working on things that are really important.

573
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:36,876
to the technical artists and artists and, you know,

574
00:27:37,216 --> 00:27:40,218
level designers and your lighting artists on the team.

575
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:43,801
And for some reason, that communication hasn't happened

576
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:45,683
in a way where they know what to expect

577
00:27:46,023 --> 00:27:47,204
at their next big milestone.

578
00:27:48,345 --> 00:27:49,466
Something has to happen,

579
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:51,127
and you have to be the one to do it

580
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:54,270
to cause that communication to happen

581
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,031
for those specifications to be written down.

582
00:27:56,832 --> 00:27:58,313
But there are a lot of kinds of, you know,

583
00:27:58,793 --> 00:27:59,714
different people are different.

584
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:02,916
And they get into this rut of.

585
00:28:03,463 --> 00:28:04,624
not sharing information.

586
00:28:05,204 --> 00:28:08,125
So you have to get it from people into a format that's usable.

587
00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:10,726
And it's hard.

588
00:28:13,006 --> 00:28:15,307
But reminding people what they're doing is awesome really helps.

589
00:28:16,007 --> 00:28:17,908
That encourages them to get up and walk.

590
00:28:18,168 --> 00:28:20,969
It encourages the kind of specificity that you need

591
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:23,809
to move forward, because they get passionate,

592
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:24,910
they feel good about what they're doing,

593
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,670
and then you give them a structure in which to work.

594
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:30,150
And you can funnel that passion into something.

595
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,090
Those who are checked out are not actually going to provide

596
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,271
you the kind of data that you need, the kind of specificity,

597
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:41,572
for others to understand what they should be doing, or how

598
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:44,092
to use this tool that's being developed, or this tech that's

599
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:48,513
being developed, or when does level art come into what your

600
00:28:48,533 --> 00:28:49,253
mappers are doing.

601
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:52,234
Those who feel good about what they're doing are going to be

602
00:28:52,294 --> 00:28:53,614
more vocal in a positive way.

603
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:57,635
You guys play Shadows of Mordor?

604
00:28:58,910 --> 00:28:59,430
It's a good game.

605
00:29:01,011 --> 00:29:02,432
Well, in their post-mortem,

606
00:29:05,653 --> 00:29:07,434
it's funny, the thing everybody talks about with that game

607
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,315
is the nemesis system.

608
00:29:09,175 --> 00:29:11,477
And they talk about how they didn't do a very good job

609
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:12,877
of communicating the promise of it,

610
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:14,779
internally or externally,

611
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:16,620
for a long time.

612
00:29:19,261 --> 00:29:20,502
And it created them some issues

613
00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:24,404
as far as spending extra cycles on things

614
00:29:24,884 --> 00:29:26,865
that they could have cut out much sooner than they did.

615
00:29:29,915 --> 00:29:31,716
And they needed somebody in that team,

616
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,118
and you as a producer can do this,

617
00:29:35,118 --> 00:29:38,100
to evangelize a system like that,

618
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,761
the thing that's going to make your game special,

619
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,843
whatever it is, to promote that all around.

620
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:46,724
When I was at Origin, we would do that.

621
00:29:46,764 --> 00:29:48,005
We would make posters of things,

622
00:29:48,045 --> 00:29:49,886
and I saw other teams inside EA do it,

623
00:29:49,926 --> 00:29:52,988
to really promote what they were doing inside of the system,

624
00:29:53,408 --> 00:29:56,530
to really gain buzz and favor for their projects.

625
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:00,965
And that's a good thing, to let people know what is special about what you're doing.

626
00:30:01,025 --> 00:30:05,066
And then to connect the people who are working on that special thing with others.

627
00:30:06,247 --> 00:30:08,988
It fuels the passion for making it.

628
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:14,429
This is a post-mortem from 1999.

629
00:30:14,589 --> 00:30:18,731
It's one of the ones that I used a lot when I was teaching at the Guild Hall still.

630
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:25,840
Ken Birdwell here talks about the cabal process,

631
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,021
how that evolved on the first Half-Life.

632
00:30:29,821 --> 00:30:31,682
And what it evolved in response to.

633
00:30:32,602 --> 00:30:34,703
And now we call, you know, this is pretty common now.

634
00:30:34,723 --> 00:30:37,464
Strike teams, tiger teams, some people just call them cabals.

635
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:41,265
We just, we like to group people around features,

636
00:30:42,145 --> 00:30:44,286
things where you can have efficient communication.

637
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,951
But there's a couple of interesting points here

638
00:30:48,351 --> 00:30:49,311
that I still like to look to.

639
00:30:49,952 --> 00:30:51,592
So one of them is, during that process,

640
00:30:51,952 --> 00:30:54,573
they realized that even though level designers

641
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:55,873
knew about some feature that was made,

642
00:30:55,953 --> 00:30:58,474
in this case, he's talking about a Beam tech

643
00:30:58,554 --> 00:30:59,955
that, um, Code had worked on.

644
00:31:00,615 --> 00:31:02,035
Nobody was using it. They didn't know what it was for.

645
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:04,356
Hadn't been communicated to them what was special about it.

646
00:31:04,556 --> 00:31:06,057
All those points that were just made,

647
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:07,217
they weren't doing that.

648
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:10,578
And their solution was,

649
00:31:10,878 --> 00:31:11,979
well, the Beam tech's made.

650
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,719
It'd be cool if it was used.

651
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:14,980
So...

652
00:31:15,843 --> 00:31:18,704
The solution is, tell them they need to integrate it,

653
00:31:19,725 --> 00:31:20,806
train them on how to do it,

654
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:23,067
and then follow through to make sure they really do it.

655
00:31:25,308 --> 00:31:26,509
Now, smart and creative people

656
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:28,950
don't usually like to be told they have to do a thing

657
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,991
unless they think, especially if you're a level designer

658
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:31,852
in this kind of environment.

659
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,833
You want to know, I mean, you basically own that level,

660
00:31:35,054 --> 00:31:36,414
right, as that LD.

661
00:31:36,955 --> 00:31:39,556
So you want it to be cool enough where you want to use it.

662
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,297
Not, not that you're told you have to.

663
00:31:41,497 --> 00:31:43,678
But sometimes as producers we have to ride that line.

664
00:31:48,476 --> 00:31:52,418
So you have to make sure you know, and that everybody else knows,

665
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:55,841
who the customer and the provider of everything that's being done are.

666
00:31:56,861 --> 00:32:01,424
And in your tasks, if you use Jira, let's say, or Hansoft, or whatever you're using,

667
00:32:01,844 --> 00:32:04,586
make sure that it's really clear who's responsible,

668
00:32:04,946 --> 00:32:07,168
who had the vision for a thing, who...

669
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:11,275
should the implementer go to for more information.

670
00:32:12,156 --> 00:32:14,317
And then if you're in a system like ours,

671
00:32:14,337 --> 00:32:16,839
a lot of times what we do is we essentially hand off

672
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:19,921
ownership to a person who says they really get the intent.

673
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:22,082
But for questions, they know how to follow up.

674
00:32:23,363 --> 00:32:25,885
In the past, on Borderlands 1, for example, we saw this.

675
00:32:26,866 --> 00:32:28,186
Some feature request would go in.

676
00:32:29,187 --> 00:32:31,729
It would sit in our task management system for a while.

677
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:33,210
Wouldn't get a lot of love.

678
00:32:34,129 --> 00:32:36,630
Eventually it'd get picked up, and then it'd be implemented

679
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,511
in essentially a vacuum.

680
00:32:39,812 --> 00:32:41,893
Until we realized in a playable build,

681
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:44,254
maybe a month later, what had gone wrong

682
00:32:44,314 --> 00:32:46,215
and seeing if we could catch up to fix it.

683
00:32:46,755 --> 00:32:48,016
Well, that's not a best practice,

684
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:49,996
so I hope that you're doing something better than that.

685
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:52,878
And one of the things that we do now

686
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:54,358
is we always make sure we know

687
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:56,519
who the customer is for a feature.

688
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:58,660
Now, in this case, I mean customer on the team.

689
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:01,622
Who's the person on the team that needs a thing?

690
00:33:02,576 --> 00:33:05,458
And out of that, also we developed, we, we built our,

691
00:33:06,238 --> 00:33:07,399
our tools programming team,

692
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,281
who always know who their customers are

693
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,962
around, around the studio.

694
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:23,367
We see, we don't see this as often anymore,

695
00:33:24,227 --> 00:33:26,188
but, man, it's always frustrating.

696
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:27,949
You, you must have been in a meeting at some point

697
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,631
where you realized the thing that everybody's arguing about

698
00:33:30,671 --> 00:33:31,972
is something nobody really knows about.

699
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:35,538
And then you start making calls, hopefully.

700
00:33:35,738 --> 00:33:37,579
Or you do something, or you postpone that meeting.

701
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:39,861
But if it's a decision that has to be made right then,

702
00:33:40,642 --> 00:33:42,523
you shouldn't probably have gotten to that point.

703
00:33:43,364 --> 00:33:47,027
You should be more careful about how your meetings are structured

704
00:33:47,747 --> 00:33:51,630
so that prior discussion happens before you get to that point.

705
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,051
So think about actually a...

706
00:33:54,345 --> 00:33:57,486
a plan for your meetings that stages them in a way

707
00:33:57,927 --> 00:33:59,907
that the right information gets to the point where

708
00:33:59,927 --> 00:34:02,288
that eventual decision-making meeting happens.

709
00:34:02,928 --> 00:34:05,729
Or allow decisions to be made in those meetings

710
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:07,630
by the people who are actually doing the work.

711
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,510
You have to decide, but you don't want to get

712
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,391
to this point.

713
00:34:11,131 --> 00:34:13,992
We still see that, but not as often, like I said.

714
00:34:18,753 --> 00:34:20,634
So again, communication's hard.

715
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:25,704
Some of the harder things that we have to do in production

716
00:34:28,207 --> 00:34:28,828
are these three.

717
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:33,093
Hiring. Hiring is one of the most difficult and important things

718
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:34,354
that we can do and get it right.

719
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:36,797
And it costs us so much when we get it wrong.

720
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:38,859
And it costs us so much just to do it.

721
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,615
Right now we're going through thousands of resumes

722
00:34:44,755 --> 00:34:47,137
in the studio, where I am, at Gearbox.

723
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:49,438
And it's a huge process.

724
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:51,560
And all of you know this, too.

725
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,861
If you've hired anybody, you know how,

726
00:34:53,622 --> 00:34:55,483
unless it was your buddy, you know,

727
00:34:55,783 --> 00:34:57,485
which, then at least you have trust for your buddy.

728
00:34:58,005 --> 00:35:00,607
But it's hard when you get it wrong.

729
00:35:01,107 --> 00:35:02,889
Assessing, assessing a situation

730
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:04,910
when you have two different points of view

731
00:35:06,091 --> 00:35:07,593
is enormously difficult.

732
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:11,055
There are tactics that you can employ.

733
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:15,767
when talking to different, people with different points of view.

734
00:35:16,007 --> 00:35:18,348
And sometimes one of those people isn't wrong.

735
00:35:20,149 --> 00:35:21,070
Sometimes they're both right.

736
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,070
Or they could both be wrong.

737
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:24,771
But you have to be able to assess that for yourself.

738
00:35:24,811 --> 00:35:26,892
And if you don't have the technical or domain expertise,

739
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:29,573
and it's not a technical issue, and you're trying to solve it,

740
00:35:30,114 --> 00:35:31,254
either you're making a mistake,

741
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:34,636
or you just need to bring others into that discussion to help you,

742
00:35:36,056 --> 00:35:38,718
or you're just really comfortable kind of playing it from the hip,

743
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:40,258
and maybe you'll get it right.

744
00:35:40,728 --> 00:35:43,509
maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe you just need to make a decision so you can move on.

745
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,530
Which is sometimes the best answer.

746
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:50,111
Sometimes you just need to make a decision so that you can move forward.

747
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:52,331
But hopefully you're being diligent about that.

748
00:35:52,931 --> 00:35:56,732
Because if you make a technical decision on a topic you don't really know about,

749
00:35:57,012 --> 00:35:58,892
but maybe you think you do, and you're kind of fudging it,

750
00:36:00,353 --> 00:36:02,113
the people that you're talking to know you don't know it.

751
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:03,914
So watch out.

752
00:36:04,694 --> 00:36:05,714
And resolving disputes.

753
00:36:06,194 --> 00:36:08,735
Similar topic, but in this one, a little more aggressive.

754
00:36:11,732 --> 00:36:13,373
Now, on the topic of hiring,

755
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:19,636
have you heard of behavioral descriptive questioning before?

756
00:36:19,656 --> 00:36:21,497
A few of us, a couple.

757
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:23,598
It's something that's really good for you to understand.

758
00:36:24,298 --> 00:36:25,019
It's really simple.

759
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:26,479
It's no magic to it.

760
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:28,640
It's just asking people questions

761
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,262
that gets to the specifics of what they actually did.

762
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:35,524
New hiring managers or people who are involved in hiring

763
00:36:37,465 --> 00:36:39,666
sometimes just make assumptions.

764
00:36:40,662 --> 00:36:44,584
Maybe not so much that the person is, you know,

765
00:36:46,184 --> 00:36:48,385
always has actually done the things that they're talking about,

766
00:36:48,765 --> 00:36:52,046
but more, maybe they're, maybe the person that you're talking to,

767
00:36:52,146 --> 00:36:55,267
that, that candidate, really means well.

768
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:57,708
Maybe they did things like what they're saying,

769
00:36:58,529 --> 00:36:59,669
so we'll kind of give them a pass.

770
00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:03,430
And I don't do this, really, anymore.

771
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:09,318
especially after some training and specific methods of questioning

772
00:37:09,758 --> 00:37:12,059
that get at what that person really did.

773
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:14,740
And I highly recommend that you follow up

774
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,481
and learn more about.

775
00:37:17,517 --> 00:37:19,518
how behavioral descriptive questions are structured,

776
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:22,240
and more so how to follow up once you get an answer.

777
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,102
Um, you've probably been asked questions like these,

778
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:27,043
or the, tell me about a time, just like you see here,

779
00:37:27,183 --> 00:37:28,884
give me an example of those kinds of things.

780
00:37:28,924 --> 00:37:31,105
But you, again, if you don't have the domain expertise,

781
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,386
and it's an area where you need that domain expertise,

782
00:37:33,746 --> 00:37:35,087
you need to take another step back,

783
00:37:35,968 --> 00:37:37,408
uh, and bring in a bit of help.

784
00:37:45,757 --> 00:37:47,337
Behavioral descriptives really help with this.

785
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,261
Now, since this is a communication talk, I figured

786
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:57,762
I'd better make sure I at least cover this.

787
00:37:59,763 --> 00:38:02,444
You need to know what questions are legal and what

788
00:38:02,484 --> 00:38:03,524
questions are not legal.

789
00:38:05,085 --> 00:38:06,786
Make sure you don't ask illegal questions.

790
00:38:06,846 --> 00:38:08,246
It's going to be really bad for you and your

791
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,147
organization if you do.

792
00:38:10,848 --> 00:38:14,172
and in line with that, you should have a formal hiring process.

793
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:18,318
It's going to help the candidate to know that you have a formal hiring process.

794
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:21,283
It'll make you look more professional if you're at a smaller studio now

795
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:22,985
or if you're in a larger organization.

796
00:38:24,255 --> 00:38:26,857
you should go around and ask questions of other hiring managers

797
00:38:27,198 --> 00:38:28,379
of what their approaches have been.

798
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:30,561
If you're not sharing that kind of information already,

799
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:31,822
you should start,

800
00:38:31,983 --> 00:38:34,285
especially because you're all working on the same projects

801
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:35,426
or you might be at some point.

802
00:38:35,766 --> 00:38:38,109
You want to know that the people that they hired under them

803
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:41,152
are going to fit into the team structure

804
00:38:41,212 --> 00:38:42,974
and be as good as the people that you hire.

805
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:46,257
So hopefully you've kind of congealed all of you

806
00:38:46,297 --> 00:38:47,558
in your leadership structures.

807
00:38:48,082 --> 00:38:51,064
or you will be in terms of how you actually hire people.

808
00:38:51,524 --> 00:38:54,686
At Gearbox, I like our hiring process quite a lot.

809
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:58,368
And in fact, we've done that where our code team

810
00:38:58,768 --> 00:39:02,050
built a formal hiring process that the other teams,

811
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:05,952
once they saw it, loved it so much they began bringing in.

812
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,354
And I can't get into the specifics of what that is too much

813
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:13,817
other than to say it's kind of industry standard now.

814
00:39:14,577 --> 00:39:17,239
And it goes back to behavioral descriptive.

815
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:19,180
questioning.

816
00:39:21,381 --> 00:39:22,321
We really want to know

817
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:25,802
both what you did in the past experience,

818
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,703
and we're going to throw things at you

819
00:39:27,963 --> 00:39:29,104
that give us some clue

820
00:39:29,864 --> 00:39:31,825
of how you will perform in the future

821
00:39:34,026 --> 00:39:36,107
based on what you say about what you did in the past,

822
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,768
not based on guesses.

823
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:44,598
Do not ask about personal identifiers, affiliations, religion, disability.

824
00:39:44,618 --> 00:39:46,620
I'm just gonna say it, right?

825
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,321
And get professional HR training if you can.

826
00:39:49,341 --> 00:39:49,681
You should.

827
00:39:52,283 --> 00:39:53,624
From that notion of questioning,

828
00:39:53,884 --> 00:39:55,144
and the way that questions are structured,

829
00:39:55,565 --> 00:39:56,385
I'll say this. This is a,

830
00:39:57,966 --> 00:39:59,587
kind of my strategy, I guess, for

831
00:40:00,227 --> 00:40:02,829
how I find out things when I'm talking to people.

832
00:40:04,149 --> 00:40:06,671
And also, it's a tool that I use

833
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:11,014
to motivate developers to focus in on what's important

834
00:40:11,735 --> 00:40:14,236
and for them to convey back to me

835
00:40:14,257 --> 00:40:15,858
they are, in fact, actually focused

836
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:17,339
or they've actually done the diligence

837
00:40:17,379 --> 00:40:18,460
of the thing that they need to do.

838
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,023
It may be difficult to read, so I'll read some of these.

839
00:40:24,344 --> 00:40:26,906
Do we know how performance is impacted by these changes?

840
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:30,709
That could be about a lot of different things, right?

841
00:40:32,684 --> 00:40:35,566
But in asking the question, you find out very quickly,

842
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:39,428
is cross-team collaboration discussion happening or not?

843
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,070
And have we done the instrumentation that we need to do?

844
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,511
And are we aware of what the deadlines are,

845
00:40:44,631 --> 00:40:46,332
what the build requirements are,

846
00:40:46,893 --> 00:40:49,714
of the release that is coming up for evaluation?

847
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:51,335
Is somebody about to do something

848
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:54,477
that's gonna tank this build that's going to be evaluated

849
00:40:54,517 --> 00:40:56,638
for an important milestone without even realizing

850
00:40:56,698 --> 00:40:58,780
that that change they made is going to do that?

851
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,740
Well, you need to know.

852
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:03,694
Do we know how, you know, obviously for say animation

853
00:41:03,735 --> 00:41:05,675
or something that maybe is being built in movers,

854
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:06,256
we use Unreal.

855
00:41:07,636 --> 00:41:08,877
Do we know how it's going to be rigged?

856
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:10,357
Have we considered the impact of co-op?

857
00:41:10,377 --> 00:41:11,018
That's a big one.

858
00:41:11,058 --> 00:41:13,659
That was huge for us on Borderlands 1

859
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:16,140
as we decided co-op was gonna be an important thing.

860
00:41:18,021 --> 00:41:20,161
We were all, we continue to be surprised actually

861
00:41:20,201 --> 00:41:21,762
by some of the things that impact co-op

862
00:41:21,822 --> 00:41:23,143
in ways that we hadn't considered.

863
00:41:24,463 --> 00:41:26,424
Is there another way to accomplish the same thing?

864
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:27,905
How will we know if it's good?

865
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,225
These are all focused.

866
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,361
on the, on the actual issue in development.

867
00:41:35,102 --> 00:41:37,364
Not on the person. Right. You want to

868
00:41:37,384 --> 00:41:39,765
be really careful. Especially, especially cause you're now

869
00:41:39,785 --> 00:41:41,966
being seen as someone in a position of authority.

870
00:41:42,326 --> 00:41:43,647
You never want to be seen as a person

871
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,669
who's attacking the developers, just doing their job. Right.

872
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:54,633
Fortunately, I haven't had too many managers who've made

873
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:55,894
me feel like I was.

874
00:41:57,834 --> 00:42:01,917
the focus of broader development issues.

875
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:03,257
But this does happen.

876
00:42:03,497 --> 00:42:04,778
And I know it still happens.

877
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,521
You guys remember Team Bondi?

878
00:42:13,984 --> 00:42:15,604
So in summary on this,

879
00:42:18,186 --> 00:42:19,066
questions are powerful.

880
00:42:20,736 --> 00:42:24,080
You have to practice listening, practice getting conversations moving.

881
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,842
You have to do that, you have to practice it.

882
00:42:26,142 --> 00:42:29,025
You can use humor as a tool, you can use different things as tools.

883
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:30,927
Not sarcasm, but humor.

884
00:42:30,947 --> 00:42:35,532
Well, I use sarcasm a lot, but only with people who I'm friends with.

885
00:42:35,612 --> 00:42:37,994
You have to really know who the people are that you're talking to.

886
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:43,336
Stay on topic because you'll be seen as more professional,

887
00:42:44,177 --> 00:42:46,819
and then you can move on from whatever that topic is from there.

888
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,221
But make sure you get to the heart of what the thing was

889
00:42:49,241 --> 00:42:50,762
that you came in to talk to people about

890
00:42:50,782 --> 00:42:52,003
or that you're in the meeting about.

891
00:42:52,323 --> 00:42:53,964
And if you can end the meeting early, do it.

892
00:42:56,726 --> 00:42:57,867
Speak with intent. Know your audience.

893
00:42:57,887 --> 00:42:59,088
You have to know what their filters are.

894
00:43:03,371 --> 00:43:03,831
December 2008.

895
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:09,671
This was another kind of post-mortem recap.

896
00:43:11,332 --> 00:43:11,932
So in this one...

897
00:43:15,152 --> 00:43:16,292
on Final Fantasy XII,

898
00:43:17,433 --> 00:43:18,713
I thought this was pretty interesting.

899
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:22,233
Um, here, uh,

900
00:43:22,453 --> 00:43:25,254
Taku talks about, talks on, talks about, um,

901
00:43:26,654 --> 00:43:27,674
what, what happened with the team,

902
00:43:27,714 --> 00:43:30,095
given the freedom to make changes at various stages of development.

903
00:43:30,115 --> 00:43:31,755
So they, they, they're expressing that they had

904
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:33,955
some freedom to make changes

905
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,196
at some stages of development, um,

906
00:43:36,996 --> 00:43:37,216
but...

907
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:42,529
That freedom led to miscommunication, confusion, disorder.

908
00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:45,290
I thought this was sort of an odd thing

909
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,231
that freedom would lead to that,

910
00:43:48,412 --> 00:43:51,113
unless in the freedom that they had,

911
00:43:51,153 --> 00:43:52,853
they didn't communicate any of those changes

912
00:43:52,893 --> 00:43:53,513
that were being made.

913
00:43:53,554 --> 00:43:55,474
They didn't, they failed to set the expectation.

914
00:43:55,994 --> 00:43:56,815
That's very dangerous.

915
00:43:56,855 --> 00:43:58,815
We have to be constantly setting expectations

916
00:43:58,855 --> 00:44:00,016
with people around us, don't we?

917
00:44:02,342 --> 00:44:03,624
And then it said right here,

918
00:44:03,844 --> 00:44:07,068
how work was to be distributed was also often ambiguous,

919
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:08,951
which contributed to the problem.

920
00:44:09,351 --> 00:44:11,013
So that really speaks to the problem

921
00:44:11,654 --> 00:44:13,136
of there not being a producer.

922
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,458
And of course, I'm, you know, I'm.

923
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:17,433
basing this on what I've read in this post-mortem.

924
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,794
That's the best we can do sometimes.

925
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:20,315
At least when we're reading these,

926
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:21,456
we're making guesses, right?

927
00:44:21,856 --> 00:44:24,037
So that being ambiguous means that there wasn't

928
00:44:24,217 --> 00:44:26,739
a producer making sure that as things were being defined

929
00:44:26,799 --> 00:44:29,180
as goals for the project, those turned in specifications.

930
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,681
They didn't stay on top of that rolling wave

931
00:44:32,062 --> 00:44:33,222
as they moved through in development.

932
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:34,263
Things just happened.

933
00:44:36,764 --> 00:44:37,084
And, um...

934
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,532
I mean, it's an older article.

935
00:44:40,572 --> 00:44:41,953
Things aren't exactly the same.

936
00:44:42,053 --> 00:44:44,415
You know, cultural things happen, be aware of them.

937
00:44:44,835 --> 00:44:45,696
I think that's a good summary.

938
00:44:48,338 --> 00:44:50,660
Recently, and again, this feature actually

939
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,460
is just wrapped up.

940
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,981
I think they're done with the series now.

941
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:54,402
This is the Games Outcomes Project.

942
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:55,383
Has anybody been tracking this?

943
00:44:56,204 --> 00:44:57,125
It's a great project.

944
00:44:57,505 --> 00:44:58,285
I love this project.

945
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:02,088
Paul Tesor, who I respect a lot,

946
00:45:02,189 --> 00:45:04,510
is a great AI programmer and designer.

947
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:08,253
So he talks here about.

948
00:45:12,072 --> 00:45:16,655
as one of the few things they discovered had real correlation

949
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,096
in the questions that were used.

950
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:22,898
In the structure of this study,

951
00:45:24,859 --> 00:45:29,762
used a few approaches, theories,

952
00:45:30,582 --> 00:45:33,564
on why things fail with teams,

953
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:34,605
why things succeed.

954
00:45:36,507 --> 00:45:41,129
And here they realized that this one,

955
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:44,671
team members would often work for weeks at a time

956
00:45:44,711 --> 00:45:47,232
without receiving feedback from project leads or managers,

957
00:45:47,872 --> 00:45:50,874
led directly to those projects which were assessed

958
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:52,535
as being some of the failure projects

959
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:54,276
or lower in the success scale.

960
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:57,858
And we've seen that.

961
00:45:59,098 --> 00:46:01,279
People who go for a long time without feedback...

962
00:46:02,161 --> 00:46:04,463
First of all, just like we talked before

963
00:46:04,503 --> 00:46:05,904
with the Hawthorne effect, right?

964
00:46:06,185 --> 00:46:08,627
Like, if you're not getting interaction and feedback,

965
00:46:08,647 --> 00:46:10,208
you don't have the context for what you're doing,

966
00:46:10,228 --> 00:46:11,509
you don't know where you stand

967
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:12,730
in the work that you're doing,

968
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:15,933
you start to feel a little bad, maybe, about it,

969
00:46:15,953 --> 00:46:16,994
or you don't feel as good.

970
00:46:17,094 --> 00:46:18,195
You're just not as connected.

971
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,637
And we hear that all the time around every studio,

972
00:46:20,657 --> 00:46:22,439
that people don't always feel as connected

973
00:46:22,759 --> 00:46:24,541
as they used to with smaller teams.

974
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:28,191
And that will impact the quality of their work.

975
00:46:28,511 --> 00:46:31,312
And also, now you're starting to fail expectations.

976
00:46:31,832 --> 00:46:33,613
You can build up an expectation gap

977
00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:38,394
with those people who are the product owners, the EPs,

978
00:46:39,074 --> 00:46:41,015
whoever's going to be ultimately deciding

979
00:46:41,655 --> 00:46:44,616
if the quality of what's been built is good enough or not

980
00:46:44,716 --> 00:46:46,296
and releasable or not.

981
00:46:47,737 --> 00:46:48,597
You've built up debt.

982
00:46:53,934 --> 00:46:55,855
Also, since this is a topic of communication,

983
00:46:58,176 --> 00:46:59,937
I thought I should make sure to point out,

984
00:46:59,977 --> 00:47:02,358
because we were talking about humor and sarcasm a second ago,

985
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:05,560
you have the responsibility of making sure

986
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,761
that your workplace is a safe environment

987
00:47:07,841 --> 00:47:08,922
and that feels good for people.

988
00:47:12,084 --> 00:47:13,365
You have that responsibility.

989
00:47:14,485 --> 00:47:16,386
And you have the authority to make it so.

990
00:47:16,406 --> 00:47:18,888
I don't care who in your environment...

991
00:47:20,544 --> 00:47:23,807
is creating issues with coworkers,

992
00:47:24,287 --> 00:47:26,869
you have a responsibility to do something about it.

993
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:32,013
So first, please, no sarcasm that puts down coworkers.

994
00:47:32,353 --> 00:47:33,434
That's not acceptable.

995
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:35,616
Okay?

996
00:47:36,136 --> 00:47:37,357
No condescension.

997
00:47:37,978 --> 00:47:39,439
No backhanded task comments.

998
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,681
You really have to watch out for this one.

999
00:47:43,802 --> 00:47:45,844
Historically, in some parts of the industry,

1000
00:47:46,424 --> 00:47:47,385
there was always a divide.

1001
00:47:47,425 --> 00:47:49,747
You know, not so much now.

1002
00:47:50,781 --> 00:47:52,722
especially not in our studio, I don't think.

1003
00:47:53,282 --> 00:47:55,823
But there was a divide where, um,

1004
00:47:56,224 --> 00:47:58,205
those who were considering themselves developers,

1005
00:47:58,925 --> 00:48:00,666
uh, saw there being sort of a gulf

1006
00:48:00,766 --> 00:48:03,327
between themselves and those who were in QA.

1007
00:48:03,667 --> 00:48:06,428
Now we have a lot of great producers and executives

1008
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:08,269
and people who came up through QA,

1009
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:11,611
and we really appreciate the close collaboration,

1010
00:48:11,631 --> 00:48:13,632
uh, between all the departments.

1011
00:48:13,732 --> 00:48:15,753
And now I just see QA as another

1012
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:17,153
one of those development departments.

1013
00:48:18,194 --> 00:48:18,254
Um...

1014
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,361
But occasionally you see really shitty comments

1015
00:48:21,981 --> 00:48:25,143
from people in development to people who are reporting bugs.

1016
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:27,924
You have to watch for that.

1017
00:48:27,964 --> 00:48:28,724
Don't let that happen.

1018
00:48:29,445 --> 00:48:30,485
It will make your product worse.

1019
00:48:33,034 --> 00:48:34,055
Condescension as well.

1020
00:48:34,935 --> 00:48:37,456
Not that long ago, it was called to my attention

1021
00:48:37,996 --> 00:48:41,698
that someone who was in a, call it a technical,

1022
00:48:41,778 --> 00:48:45,620
creative discipline, was making comments in tasks

1023
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,261
about a tool that they were developing.

1024
00:48:47,581 --> 00:48:48,601
Which, by the way, it's a tool.

1025
00:48:48,661 --> 00:48:50,922
It implies that there are customers on the creative side

1026
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:52,483
who are gonna be using that tool.

1027
00:48:53,143 --> 00:48:55,004
And sort of calling out some of the comments

1028
00:48:55,064 --> 00:48:57,545
about why people thought that tool

1029
00:48:57,585 --> 00:49:01,047
or that approach that person was using wasn't the best.

1030
00:49:01,987 --> 00:49:04,528
And then I saw this kind of back and forth,

1031
00:49:04,568 --> 00:49:06,569
very thinly veiled passive-aggressive

1032
00:49:07,209 --> 00:49:10,171
back and forth happen that we had to put the kibosh on.

1033
00:49:11,131 --> 00:49:12,552
And we did.

1034
00:49:12,832 --> 00:49:15,413
And then it's funny, once we talked to the people involved,

1035
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:17,874
you know, whether or not they really knew

1036
00:49:17,934 --> 00:49:18,714
what they were doing,

1037
00:49:18,954 --> 00:49:20,195
they kind of expressed they didn't.

1038
00:49:20,635 --> 00:49:22,356
They were just kind of trying to get their point across.

1039
00:49:22,696 --> 00:49:24,396
And you as a producer have to be the adult there.

1040
00:49:25,957 --> 00:49:26,657
No name-calling.

1041
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:29,018
And at the same time, though...

1042
00:49:30,088 --> 00:49:33,190
If you're hearing those kind of things, so and so is stupid.

1043
00:49:33,891 --> 00:49:36,672
Now, that's different from this thing that we're doing is stupid, right?

1044
00:49:38,453 --> 00:49:43,496
Don't tolerate low performance, because if you let people stay around your environment

1045
00:49:43,576 --> 00:49:47,018
who are low performers, that's gonna tank the performance and the morale of everybody

1046
00:49:47,078 --> 00:49:47,599
else, right?

1047
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:49,800
So if you have a low performer, you have to get rid of them.

1048
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:55,263
Don't let them just sit there in the environment and get kicked around a lot.

1049
00:49:55,483 --> 00:49:56,023
They have to go.

1050
00:49:57,084 --> 00:49:58,205
You can't have saccharine cows there.

1051
00:49:59,169 --> 00:50:00,850
And you have to get rid of bad processes.

1052
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:02,631
So if somebody says this process is stupid,

1053
00:50:03,031 --> 00:50:04,772
well, talk it through.

1054
00:50:05,153 --> 00:50:06,693
It's possible the process is stupid.

1055
00:50:08,955 --> 00:50:12,056
But at the same time, unless you've really understood

1056
00:50:12,697 --> 00:50:13,857
where that person's coming from,

1057
00:50:14,538 --> 00:50:15,759
you can't assess.

1058
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:17,740
Just same as what we were saying before.

1059
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,081
If you don't have the technical expertise and domain,

1060
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:21,802
you can't really know if you don't get more help.

1061
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:27,385
So...

1062
00:50:29,263 --> 00:50:30,604
Going back to communications hard.

1063
00:50:33,526 --> 00:50:36,749
I was talking to a project producer a few years ago

1064
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:41,353
who had a kind of a monumental set of tasks on top of them.

1065
00:50:41,393 --> 00:50:44,595
They had a really hard job to do

1066
00:50:44,635 --> 00:50:46,317
based on the nature of what they were trying to ship.

1067
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:49,820
And then they had more and more things heaped on top of them.

1068
00:50:51,421 --> 00:50:54,063
And so that person kind of delegated a bit,

1069
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:55,084
a very small amount,

1070
00:50:55,925 --> 00:50:57,906
some production responsibility of some of those other things.

1071
00:50:59,352 --> 00:51:02,813
And that producer came to me and just completely befuddled,

1072
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:05,495
totally befuddled, said this.

1073
00:51:05,735 --> 00:51:07,195
They had the same information as me.

1074
00:51:07,535 --> 00:51:09,556
How could they possibly have come to a different conclusion?

1075
00:51:09,797 --> 00:51:10,737
Something's wrong with that person.

1076
00:51:10,757 --> 00:51:11,297
You should fire them.

1077
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:18,701
After sitting down with the person in question and this

1078
00:51:18,741 --> 00:51:22,582
producer, realized all the decisions that had been made

1079
00:51:22,783 --> 00:51:25,724
were great decisions for these things that had been

1080
00:51:25,764 --> 00:51:26,164
delegated.

1081
00:51:26,524 --> 00:51:27,505
They were actually great decisions.

1082
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:28,665
They made the product better.

1083
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:32,921
but there had been a failure to communicate and set expectations

1084
00:51:33,722 --> 00:51:34,783
as changes happened.

1085
00:51:35,643 --> 00:51:37,405
Kind of like staying on top of that rolling wave.

1086
00:51:38,086 --> 00:51:42,170
And so, because the end result of those decisions was so different

1087
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,112
from what the producer thought was going to happen in the beginning,

1088
00:51:45,733 --> 00:51:47,174
all they could see what the result was

1089
00:51:47,194 --> 00:51:49,837
and immediately see it as all bad.

1090
00:51:51,258 --> 00:51:53,140
And it took a long time, actually.

1091
00:51:54,404 --> 00:51:56,346
In this case, I mean, every hour is expensive.

1092
00:51:56,386 --> 00:51:58,547
It took a couple of days to work it out

1093
00:51:58,687 --> 00:52:00,149
and see that actually it was okay.

1094
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:03,631
But that communication goes both ways.

1095
00:52:03,671 --> 00:52:06,153
It's why it's important for you to communicate up well

1096
00:52:06,753 --> 00:52:09,075
to your leads and set those expectations

1097
00:52:09,375 --> 00:52:11,857
and do the same with the team that you're working with,

1098
00:52:12,177 --> 00:52:14,259
your peers, collaborators, and your teams.

1099
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,521
You have to be constantly setting those expectations,

1100
00:52:16,861 --> 00:52:18,602
or people will see a thing that happens later

1101
00:52:18,622 --> 00:52:21,344
and react to it very differently

1102
00:52:21,384 --> 00:52:23,266
than if they understood the expectation up front.

1103
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:31,702
Communication's hard. Some cats are going to sneak by you.

1104
00:52:31,722 --> 00:52:32,942
It's impossible to get them all.

1105
00:52:35,062 --> 00:52:38,363
You could be patient. You could learn about people more.

1106
00:52:38,803 --> 00:52:41,524
You can find out that you can do things to bring them to you.

1107
00:52:42,044 --> 00:52:46,865
Even the most belligerent people up front getting to know you.

1108
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:49,806
Understanding not just your intent, because everybody can have good intent.

1109
00:52:50,206 --> 00:52:52,567
But if they see that you're trying hard and that you're learning,

1110
00:52:53,107 --> 00:52:54,427
and you're learning about what they do.

1111
00:52:55,629 --> 00:52:57,910
and that you appreciate and respect them,

1112
00:52:59,531 --> 00:53:03,353
and you don't allow yourself to fall into bad habits.

1113
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:05,575
If you're really setting the standard,

1114
00:53:05,895 --> 00:53:06,835
people will flock to you.

1115
00:53:07,195 --> 00:53:08,976
They'll talk about you like,

1116
00:53:11,118 --> 00:53:11,298
well,

1117
00:53:12,238 --> 00:53:14,860
God, I was going to say the cat's meow,

1118
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,201
but I can't help it.

1119
00:53:17,261 --> 00:53:18,021
Free association.

1120
00:53:21,083 --> 00:53:22,604
They will always want to work with you.

1121
00:53:23,024 --> 00:53:23,184
Okay.

1122
00:53:24,837 --> 00:53:25,597
Let them come to you.

1123
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:33,262
Perfect communication, guys, is not possible. It's why,

1124
00:53:33,282 --> 00:53:36,204
in the description for the talk, I said, it's

1125
00:53:36,244 --> 00:53:38,225
hard, might as well give up now. OK.

1126
00:53:39,406 --> 00:53:42,568
And I'm giving us some hyperbole. It's, it isn't

1127
00:53:42,668 --> 00:53:44,909
possible to have perfect communication, because again, you only

1128
00:53:44,969 --> 00:53:47,731
control what you do. Right. So if you want

1129
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,533
perfect, if you're always going to be frustrated because

1130
00:53:50,573 --> 00:53:52,754
things you say are going to be mistaken, all

1131
00:53:52,794 --> 00:53:54,295
you can do is improve your side of it.

1132
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:58,730
You have to practice your communication skills.

1133
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:02,131
The way that you break down tasks, what you learn,

1134
00:54:02,891 --> 00:54:06,552
the domains of the people around you, the wave of what's happening

1135
00:54:07,012 --> 00:54:08,252
in technology around you.

1136
00:54:09,092 --> 00:54:10,613
This industry is changing so fast.

1137
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,053
You have to stay on top of it.

1138
00:54:14,493 --> 00:54:17,394
And I want to see you all, as you succeed, or not,

1139
00:54:17,434 --> 00:54:19,774
whatever's happening on your projects, keep learning.

1140
00:54:20,255 --> 00:54:22,215
Help us as a community learn.

1141
00:54:22,655 --> 00:54:23,575
Share what you've learned.

1142
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:25,298
And write new postmortems.

1143
00:54:27,779 --> 00:54:28,679
And that's it.

1144
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:30,379
Thank you.

1145
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:40,662
applause

1146
00:54:40,682 --> 00:54:41,022
Thank you.

1147
00:54:41,102 --> 00:54:43,903
So I think we got a little bit of Q&A time,

1148
00:54:43,943 --> 00:54:45,403
if anybody wants to ask any questions,

1149
00:54:45,483 --> 00:54:46,444
or else, uh,

1150
00:54:47,624 --> 00:54:49,524
I know we have a great panel coming up pretty soon.

1151
00:54:54,274 --> 00:54:55,155
Anybody have any questions?

1152
00:54:56,195 --> 00:54:56,295
Okay.

1153
00:54:56,315 --> 00:54:59,436
Q So you were mentioning before about visualizations.

1154
00:54:59,456 --> 00:55:00,717
A Yes.

1155
00:55:00,737 --> 00:55:02,918
Q And I was wondering if you could give examples

1156
00:55:03,098 --> 00:55:06,540
of some of the visualizations that you've used very effectively in the past.

1157
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,561
A Thank you.

1158
00:55:08,921 --> 00:55:11,842
So some, some visualizations I think I've used effectively.

1159
00:55:13,403 --> 00:55:15,024
Some of them have been things that...

1160
00:55:18,145 --> 00:55:21,727
were in fact kind of time series between,

1161
00:55:21,847 --> 00:55:24,028
basically showing dependencies between departments.

1162
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:26,130
I don't have them to show you here.

1163
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,991
Maybe I could follow up with a few that I'd show,

1164
00:55:28,031 --> 00:55:29,452
but I can describe a couple.

1165
00:55:30,832 --> 00:55:32,974
One is, I was working on a project

1166
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:36,676
that was new IP.

1167
00:55:37,076 --> 00:55:38,277
It was seeking to innovate.

1168
00:55:39,017 --> 00:55:40,498
And it had an uncertain budget.

1169
00:55:40,538 --> 00:55:42,620
It was a large budget, but it was uncertain.

1170
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,501
And between ourselves and the publisher,

1171
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:46,642
we wanted to understand...

1172
00:55:49,009 --> 00:55:52,792
the, uh, kind of the difference between

1173
00:55:53,552 --> 00:55:55,954
our perceived value of what we'd built

1174
00:55:56,715 --> 00:56:01,098
and, um, uh, and the true value of where it was.

1175
00:56:01,118 --> 00:56:05,801
Um, so I built a graph that showed

1176
00:56:05,841 --> 00:56:09,324
the value of other projects, um, that had just shipped,

1177
00:56:09,744 --> 00:56:11,205
that had some of those innovations,

1178
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:15,268
and, um, the entropy of, uh,

1179
00:56:15,668 --> 00:56:17,169
basically in people's minds.

1180
00:56:18,237 --> 00:56:21,779
how fresh would those ideas still be when they came together as one?

1181
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,642
And how long would it take us actually to finish,

1182
00:56:26,503 --> 00:56:28,584
depending on how many of those innovations we finished?

1183
00:56:29,545 --> 00:56:31,726
In this case, we were doing some very heavy physics stuff.

1184
00:56:32,447 --> 00:56:36,350
We were doing some brand new animation tech.

1185
00:56:37,891 --> 00:56:39,031
We were doing destruction.

1186
00:56:39,071 --> 00:56:42,654
This is all long before this generation of platforms launched.

1187
00:56:44,936 --> 00:56:47,538
and it was going to be a last-gen project.

1188
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:49,539
So basically, sketching all those things out

1189
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:51,541
and also showing what the gap was to when we thought

1190
00:56:51,561 --> 00:56:52,722
the next-gen platforms would be.

1191
00:56:52,982 --> 00:56:54,463
Basically, all the costs involved

1192
00:56:55,143 --> 00:56:57,225
and what the market expectation would be

1193
00:56:57,545 --> 00:56:59,086
and what it would cost to get us there

1194
00:56:59,367 --> 00:57:01,668
versus basically cutting those things

1195
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:04,090
and shipping what still would have been a good game

1196
00:57:05,111 --> 00:57:06,572
without all those innovations.

1197
00:57:06,972 --> 00:57:09,354
And doing it in a way that didn't take those people

1198
00:57:09,374 --> 00:57:10,274
who had been working on them...

1199
00:57:12,876 --> 00:57:16,037
and not pay respect to the effort that they put in, and their feelings about it.

1200
00:57:16,837 --> 00:57:20,119
So, in that, showing not just the work that they've done, say,

1201
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:23,880
a couple programmers and a designer, or animation tech,

1202
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,481
and a few animators and a programmer, but...

1203
00:57:27,242 --> 00:57:29,083
all the other people in that dependency chain

1204
00:57:29,303 --> 00:57:30,544
who also would have to work on it,

1205
00:57:30,865 --> 00:57:32,506
so that if we decided to cut that feature,

1206
00:57:32,946 --> 00:57:34,227
that all the people who'd been working on it

1207
00:57:34,327 --> 00:57:38,351
really understood what the larger risk was and cost was,

1208
00:57:38,631 --> 00:57:39,812
as opposed to just what they'd done.

1209
00:57:39,872 --> 00:57:41,834
And also how we could, um...

1210
00:57:42,454 --> 00:57:45,697
Well, that's basically what the graph focused on.

1211
00:57:46,237 --> 00:57:48,079
From there, though, it was used in communication

1212
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:49,780
to talk about how we could recycle those things

1213
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,641
for future projects.

1214
00:57:52,062 --> 00:57:53,223
Any time you're gonna deliver some...

1215
00:57:54,322 --> 00:58:00,247
something that could be bad news, I want to see if we can refocus that to show how something

1216
00:58:00,307 --> 00:58:01,348
will be better in the future.

1217
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:10,394
A few other things would be, I had a great AP on a project

1218
00:58:10,694 --> 00:58:13,775
who helped me with, if you guys have tried to use

1219
00:58:13,815 --> 00:58:15,975
JIRA and Project together, you know how much of a bear

1220
00:58:16,015 --> 00:58:21,196
that is, but helped me with a near real-time flow

1221
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:24,437
of data between JIRA and Project so that we could

1222
00:58:24,557 --> 00:58:27,898
visualize the impact of tasks that were being created.

1223
00:58:29,378 --> 00:58:30,278
on a regular basis.

1224
00:58:30,419 --> 00:58:33,740
Once we had to sequence those out into our project plan,

1225
00:58:35,081 --> 00:58:37,862
and we could visualize at a much more micro level

1226
00:58:37,922 --> 00:58:40,003
than we typically would in project.

1227
00:58:40,263 --> 00:58:42,244
Actually, in that Gantt view, which can be helpful

1228
00:58:42,304 --> 00:58:43,105
because it gives you...

1229
00:58:45,544 --> 00:58:48,005
It gives you the brackets within which things are going to happen.

1230
00:58:48,806 --> 00:58:50,447
It can be used as a helpful tool

1231
00:58:50,487 --> 00:58:51,968
because it's a bit of information overload.

1232
00:58:51,988 --> 00:58:53,950
It's like there's all this stuff suddenly,

1233
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:55,791
this work that's suddenly been created.

1234
00:58:56,071 --> 00:58:58,573
Could we please just finish the work that we already committed to?

1235
00:58:59,174 --> 00:59:01,756
Because we know that those bars are really going to grow

1236
00:59:01,856 --> 00:59:03,297
for the polish of every one of those things.

1237
00:59:03,797 --> 00:59:05,038
It was just a handy tool.

1238
00:59:06,439 --> 00:59:06,939
Those are a couple.

1239
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:08,721
Thank you very much.

1240
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:10,922
Sure. Any other questions?

1241
00:59:12,604 --> 00:59:13,785
No time? Okay. Thanks, guys.
