00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,602
Hello everyone, my name is Nick Yi.

2
00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:10,966
I'm the co-founder and analytics lead of Quantic Foundry.

3
00:00:11,347 --> 00:00:14,871
So three quick notes, turn off your noisemakers,

4
00:00:15,552 --> 00:00:17,995
remember to fill in your evaluations,

5
00:00:18,856 --> 00:00:20,959
and I do have a link for the download

6
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:22,140
of the PDF of these slides.

7
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:23,923
I'll give it to you at the end of the talk.

8
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:29,752
When we were working on the slides for this year,

9
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:32,114
we were reflecting back on the three talks

10
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:33,274
we've given so far before.

11
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:36,616
And one thing we noticed that was almost surprising even

12
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,958
to us was, over the span of the past three talks,

13
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,980
we've actually only spent about 10 seconds

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,601
describing each motivation.

15
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:50,736
We did this to be concise so that we could spend most of our time talking about what

16
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:52,017
we felt were more interesting things.

17
00:00:52,497 --> 00:00:58,539
How our motivations connect with age, with gender, with personality, and how whether

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,060
gamers consider themselves casual or hardcore.

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,382
But our use of these short hands and being concise has inadvertently created a negative

20
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:09,263
space where some misconceptions have been brewing.

21
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:12,984
So what I'll be talking to you about today

22
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:15,806
is the dark side of the moon, which

23
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:17,848
we realized late yesterday would have been

24
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:19,109
a great title for this talk.

25
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:23,013
So what do I mean by negative space?

26
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:27,036
In Jason Vandenberg's 2012 GDC talk,

27
00:01:27,576 --> 00:01:29,618
he asked a super insightful question.

28
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:32,200
Considering Bottles' player types,

29
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:34,883
which almost everyone in the game industry is familiar with,

30
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:39,286
he asked us, what is a non-achiever?

31
00:01:40,748 --> 00:01:45,509
I hope it's immediately clear that despite the positioning in the chart, a non-achiever

32
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,950
isn't a socializer.

33
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,652
Just because someone dislikes leveling up and grinding doesn't mean that they're a social

34
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:52,152
care bear.

35
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,953
Jason's answered this question.

36
00:01:54,973 --> 00:02:02,295
A player who isn't driven by grinding and leveling up is a contentment player, someone

37
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:05,856
who is comfortable with the status and doesn't want to be caught up in the rat race.

38
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:11,722
The most striking thing, the reason why Jason's question was so insightful, is that it's pointing

39
00:02:11,742 --> 00:02:14,584
out something that is missing entirely on this graph.

40
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:19,368
A non-achiever actually isn't even a dot you can place on this map.

41
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:24,773
So Jason's question really foregrounded a negative space that had literally become invisible

42
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:25,813
in the game industry.

43
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:33,019
It's a blind spot that's quite common across most proposed motivation taxonomies, including

44
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,281
our own, especially when we try to be concise.

45
00:02:35,982 --> 00:02:41,264
And to be clear, by negative space, I don't mean a bad thing like a closet full of zombies.

46
00:02:41,824 --> 00:02:45,206
It's like the elephant in the room that no one noticed before,

47
00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:51,028
despite how much space it occupied. But once someone points it out, you can't unsee it.

48
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,888
So even though we knew about this negative space

49
00:02:57,228 --> 00:03:00,169
in our attempts to be concise when presenting a motivation

50
00:03:00,249 --> 00:03:02,651
model, we inadvertently created and kept

51
00:03:02,731 --> 00:03:04,812
reinforcing this exact negative space.

52
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:07,593
And because of this, we started getting very similar questions

53
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:10,214
from folks that stemmed from this negative space.

54
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:13,616
So questions like, what does low completion actually mean?

55
00:03:14,136 --> 00:03:17,318
What are game examples of games of low completion?

56
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:20,718
If a gamer scores low on all the motivations,

57
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:22,438
are they just a disengaged gamer?

58
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:25,159
And when a gamer has many high scores,

59
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,220
do they just want more of everything?

60
00:03:29,521 --> 00:03:32,161
In our data, we have a way of filling in

61
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,082
that negative space empirically.

62
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:37,823
So to date, over 400,000 gamers have come and taken

63
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:39,744
our gamer motivation profile.

64
00:03:40,204 --> 00:03:42,004
Gamers take a five minute survey

65
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:43,805
and they receive a personalized report

66
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:46,926
of how their motivations rank relative to other gamers.

67
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:54,225
Alongside the gaming motivation scores, we also ask gamers their demographics and specific

68
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:56,868
game titles that they've enjoyed playing.

69
00:03:57,448 --> 00:04:00,312
So we're able to pivot between these three variable sets.

70
00:04:00,352 --> 00:04:04,837
So for each game that's mentioned in the data, we can sample the gamers who've mentioned

71
00:04:04,857 --> 00:04:08,921
that game and calculate the average motivation profile of that game's audience.

72
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:12,813
So say we're interested in the strategy motivation.

73
00:04:13,313 --> 00:04:17,114
I can tabulate the motivation score, the motivation score

74
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,395
for each game on strategy, and then rank or to the games

75
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:23,576
by their average strategy score from the lowest

76
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:24,717
all the way to the highest.

77
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,577
We can then look at the list of games

78
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:28,918
on both ends of the spectrum to understand

79
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:32,039
the negative space and articulate the spectrum itself.

80
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:39,314
So figuring out this negative space is looking into this bucket of game titles and playing

81
00:04:39,855 --> 00:04:41,516
what do these three things have in common.

82
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:45,619
So it's like someone came up to you and asked, what do Little Red Riding Hood,

83
00:04:46,548 --> 00:04:49,871
Amadador, and Africa have in common.

84
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:52,293
And the analysis that we went through

85
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,735
is slowly figuring out that the three things

86
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:57,057
these things have in common is they all have capes.

87
00:04:57,758 --> 00:05:00,661
So in this talk, we'll go through what

88
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,964
we found when we ran through all the tabulations,

89
00:05:04,464 --> 00:05:06,726
chewed on the potential commonalities of the game

90
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:08,748
titles, and how we've tried to make

91
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,330
sense of the negative space based on our data set.

92
00:05:13,143 --> 00:05:15,064
So let me start with one quick example,

93
00:05:15,204 --> 00:05:16,365
and then I'll keep chatting a bit more

94
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:17,145
about this negative space.

95
00:05:17,446 --> 00:05:18,746
So let's start with strategy.

96
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:21,108
We've typically described strategy

97
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:23,610
as part of a cluster of motivations

98
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,451
that revolves around more long-term

99
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:27,592
oriented gaming motivations.

100
00:05:28,653 --> 00:05:31,335
So things that take time and planning to accomplish.

101
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:36,718
Strategy is about the decision complexity in the gameplay,

102
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:39,580
the amount of information you have to process

103
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,301
to make the next decision,

104
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:44,564
the potential contingencies you have to anticipate

105
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:46,825
and plan for, the number of steps and moves,

106
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:49,027
the time horizon on which you have to plan

107
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:50,428
and accomplish your goals.

108
00:05:50,448 --> 00:05:52,550
Do you need to plan one step out or 15 moves out?

109
00:05:57,045 --> 00:06:00,046
So I'll be showing you a chart like this for each motivation.

110
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:03,747
We'll provide some of the more well-known game titles

111
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:06,528
in the top 20th percent and the bottom 20%

112
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:08,989
of each motivation ranking.

113
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,130
So in other words, if we took all the games in our data set

114
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,871
and rank them on their average strategy score

115
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:15,931
from lowest to highest,

116
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:17,552
what are some of the games in the bottom 20,

117
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:20,012
what are some of the games in the top 20?

118
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:21,253
It doesn't mean.

119
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:25,995
that these games are only played by players with extreme motivations,

120
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:29,336
but these are games that exemplify the preferences of gamers

121
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,197
with very high or very low scores on these motivations.

122
00:06:32,618 --> 00:06:34,198
So gamers with high strategy...

123
00:06:35,318 --> 00:06:37,538
They want a great deal of decision complexity.

124
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,999
They want meaty decisions that they can chew on

125
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:44,240
and long-term strategies they can plan out and execute.

126
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,121
So some examples of games that score high on strategy

127
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:50,562
include StarCraft, Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis.

128
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:53,582
Conversely, games with low strategy scores

129
00:06:53,742 --> 00:06:57,043
are more spontaneous and reactive gamers.

130
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:01,546
They want gameplay with lower cognitive loads, shorter time horizons,

131
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:05,890
and where decisions can be made based on processing only a small amount of information,

132
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:11,114
or planning isn't even productive at all because of the many randomized elements in the game.

133
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:17,258
So in our data, some examples of games in this space were The Sims, Disney Emoji Blitz, and Mario Kart.

134
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:20,040
I want to clarify one thing before I move on

135
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,861
about these scores and these placements.

136
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:27,244
You can absolutely play The Sims in a highly strategic way.

137
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:29,725
Say I have a master plan from the start

138
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:32,206
to create a vampire couple who abducts

139
00:07:32,246 --> 00:07:35,408
the alien baby next door and then plans carnivorous plans

140
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:36,889
all over town to murder everyone.

141
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:39,610
You can play The Sims that way.

142
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,132
And that is a long-term plan, and that is high strategy.

143
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:46,633
What we're tracking here is how the core audience

144
00:07:48,074 --> 00:07:50,376
gamers who say they enjoy these games,

145
00:07:50,856 --> 00:07:53,078
what their average motivation profile looks like.

146
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,679
We're not measuring how a game could be played,

147
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,022
but rather what an audience a game typically attracts,

148
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:03,625
and thus how that core audience most typically plays that game.

149
00:08:06,947 --> 00:08:09,749
When I say the negative space and the dark side of the moon,

150
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:12,511
part of what I mean is that when we,

151
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:15,653
the game industry, talk about gaming motivations,

152
00:08:17,138 --> 00:08:22,500
We tend to have far better developed vocabulary and terminology and nuance for certain aspects

153
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:28,623
of gaming, and our language is tended to be shaped by how core or hardcore gamers see

154
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:33,685
the world and things that they want more of in games, and because game researchers and

155
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:36,586
game designers are almost game players themselves.

156
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:41,708
This bias has permeated our way of conceptualizing

157
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:42,529
gaming motivation.

158
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:45,111
So when you scan motivation taxonomies in literature

159
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:47,513
in industry white papers, you'll often

160
00:08:47,673 --> 00:08:50,335
find motivations like competition and challenge

161
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,716
like we do in our taxonomy.

162
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:55,780
For this reason, things that a hardcore gamer wants more of.

163
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,523
So this more of x or less of x way

164
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,344
of talking about gaming motivations

165
00:09:01,464 --> 00:09:03,486
is something that Jason Vandenberg has referred

166
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:05,288
to as the thermometer model.

167
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:09,009
And I'll use that term here in my talk as well and expand on that.

168
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,911
One problem with the thermometer model is that it leads people to treat the high end

169
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:21,613
of the motivation as being more inherently important or valuable than the lower end.

170
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:26,134
So, for example, we have a tendency to lump everything in the negative space into this

171
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,935
amorphous bland bucket that we call casual.

172
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:30,757
and they typically leave it at that.

173
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:33,160
And someone who doesn't like challenging

174
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:36,004
multiplayer gameplay, oh, they're just casual.

175
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:38,507
Even when we have other labels for these folks,

176
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:40,170
they tend to be value negative labels,

177
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,514
so this gameplay is simplistic, it's slow,

178
00:09:43,594 --> 00:09:44,616
it's not a real game.

179
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:48,358
So our collective language for talking about gaming motivations

180
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:54,540
implicitly measures how far someone falls from the ideal hardcore gamer.

181
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,022
This is an artifact of the thermometer model,

182
00:09:57,462 --> 00:09:59,983
and that's one thing we're trying to surface and correct here.

183
00:10:01,564 --> 00:10:03,405
Let me show you another example of design,

184
00:10:03,505 --> 00:10:06,026
one of the two motivations under creativity.

185
00:10:07,703 --> 00:10:12,185
In the past, we've described design as the appeal of expressing your own individuality

186
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,186
in the context of a game.

187
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:17,167
Can I express my personal flair in this game?

188
00:10:17,187 --> 00:10:18,447
Can I leave a mark behind?

189
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:23,689
Does the game provide me with the levers and the color pickers to really design my avatar

190
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:24,790
in Spaceship and City?

191
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,392
So you may think that games of low design tend to look bland or generic, but that's

192
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:31,152
not what we've found.

193
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:33,087
Let's start on the high end.

194
00:10:33,587 --> 00:10:36,169
In our data, games like Guild Wars 2, The Sims,

195
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:39,111
and Animal Crossing had some of the highest design scores.

196
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:41,592
This makes sense, given the large range

197
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:44,394
of customization opportunities in these games.

198
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:48,577
But on the low end, we don't find bland or abstract games.

199
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:51,259
In our data, some of the games with the lowest design scores

200
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:53,941
included Braid, Super Meat Boys, Super Mario Galaxies,

201
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:56,943
games with very unique styles and creative visions.

202
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:58,264
So rather than simply

203
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:01,129
low or high customization.

204
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:04,570
Another potential way to think about what's going on

205
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,350
is the amount of aesthetic control

206
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,211
over the game world between the game designer and the player.

207
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:12,992
How much control is the player willing to cede and relinquish

208
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:14,352
to the designer's vision?

209
00:11:14,552 --> 00:11:18,033
How willing is a gamer to experience a curated game

210
00:11:18,073 --> 00:11:20,373
experience as opposed to wanting to have

211
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:22,794
a direct hand in shaping and designing

212
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:23,934
the world themselves?

213
00:11:28,975 --> 00:11:29,195
Thanks.

214
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:34,837
Sorry about that.

215
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:37,780
I'll show you the age and gender breakdowns

216
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,823
for some of the motivations, so the more interesting ones,

217
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:43,987
and also the ones that contrast well with each other.

218
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:47,050
Each motivation kind of has its own unique signature

219
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,152
in terms of how it varies by age and gender.

220
00:11:49,673 --> 00:11:50,654
So in these charts.

221
00:11:52,068 --> 00:11:57,614
Each dot is the average here, the design score, for all respondents at each age point.

222
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,776
So each dot is the average of thousands of players.

223
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:04,061
The orange circular dots are the women and the blue triangular dots are the men.

224
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:05,883
So here we have design.

225
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:08,955
It actually peaks very early.

226
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:11,076
Female gamers are more interested in design,

227
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:13,937
and the appeal of design drops slowly with age.

228
00:12:14,357 --> 00:12:15,817
And the delta between men and women

229
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:18,218
stays pretty constant throughout the age span

230
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,759
that we have between age 13 to 60 that we're showing you here.

231
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,860
With all these charts that I'll show you,

232
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,361
you'll notice that there's more fluctuation at the tail end,

233
00:12:26,421 --> 00:12:27,181
at the older end.

234
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:30,582
This is because we have fewer data points beyond age 50.

235
00:12:30,982 --> 00:12:32,383
So even with the larger data samples,

236
00:12:32,683 --> 00:12:33,783
there's still a bit of jitter there.

237
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,651
So at this point, you may be asking yourself, wait,

238
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:42,114
so Quantic Foundry didn't know what the low end

239
00:12:42,134 --> 00:12:43,455
of each scale meant until now?

240
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,296
The answer is yes and no.

241
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:47,558
When we put together the profile app,

242
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:50,921
we knew roughly what the low ends of each motivation

243
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,743
likely referred to, but we didn't have the clarity

244
00:12:54,184 --> 00:12:56,385
that we now have because of specific game titles

245
00:12:56,806 --> 00:12:59,568
we were able to explore based on the data itself.

246
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:02,110
Another reason that is that

247
00:13:03,274 --> 00:13:06,477
It's very difficult to ask about the absence of something

248
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:07,557
in a survey.

249
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:10,560
The question is very difficult to make sense of

250
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,260
for respondents.

251
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:14,803
We also didn't want to force false dichotomies

252
00:13:15,023 --> 00:13:17,024
into the model based on our own assumptions.

253
00:13:17,044 --> 00:13:18,666
So for example, we don't ask gamers

254
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:21,328
if they prefer lots of customization options

255
00:13:21,608 --> 00:13:22,409
or a bland game.

256
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:23,529
That's a forced dichotomy.

257
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,152
So we allowed the motivation items to aggregate naturally

258
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:28,353
when we're doing the data analysis

259
00:13:28,753 --> 00:13:30,875
and then to figure out the negative space later on

260
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:31,996
using the data.

261
00:13:34,162 --> 00:13:34,943
Excitement is next.

262
00:13:35,443 --> 00:13:38,027
We've often described excitement as an appeal

263
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,871
of fast-paced, action-oriented gameplay

264
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:43,754
with lots of surprises and thrills.

265
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:48,934
I'm going to take a slight detour into personalized psychology.

266
00:13:49,774 --> 00:13:55,676
Jerome Kagan's longitudinal study of baby temperament is one of my favorite studies

267
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:56,736
in the field of psychology.

268
00:13:57,396 --> 00:14:04,379
The study began in the 80s, and temperament is a consistent set of behavioral responses

269
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:09,820
from a baby in how they react to things, because we cannot ask four-month-olds to take surveys.

270
00:14:10,872 --> 00:14:14,373
Kagan found that infants as young as four months of age

271
00:14:14,973 --> 00:14:16,613
developed temperamental differences

272
00:14:16,993 --> 00:14:19,314
where they behave differently to new things,

273
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:22,594
whether it's new people, new toys, or novel sounds.

274
00:14:23,914 --> 00:14:26,095
So on one end of the spectrum, you

275
00:14:26,135 --> 00:14:29,295
have babies where you put them in a cradle

276
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:30,896
and you bring out a toy mobile.

277
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,356
And you start jangling it wildly in front of the baby.

278
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:37,197
And you can jangle for as long as you want.

279
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:40,317
The baby remains calm and entertained.

280
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:46,896
And on the other extreme, you have babies who become visibly distressed the moment you

281
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:47,956
bring out the toy mobile.

282
00:14:48,996 --> 00:14:53,777
And they become more distressed the more you jangle the toy in front of them until they

283
00:14:53,797 --> 00:14:55,938
start to flail and cry uncontrollably.

284
00:14:57,258 --> 00:15:03,680
These temperamental differences at four months of age don't translate one-to-one into introversion

285
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,741
and extroversion when these babies grow up.

286
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:08,902
So Kagan followed these babies until they were adults.

287
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,582
But these temperamental differences do seem to apply strong constraints.

288
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:21,204
So the babies who are calm at four months of age very rarely become introverts when

289
00:15:21,244 --> 00:15:21,724
they're adults.

290
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:28,287
And similarly, the babies who are easily distressed at four months of age rarely become extroverts

291
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:29,207
when they're adults.

292
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:32,048
And so what this study reveals is that there's an important difference.

293
00:15:33,227 --> 00:15:37,370
between introverts and extroverts in terms of their tolerance of novel stimuli,

294
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:42,333
specifically whether that stimulus is entertaining or overwhelming to them.

295
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:48,778
So introverts avoid parties and crowds because the sensory stimulation quickly becomes exhausting,

296
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:53,401
draining, and overwhelming, while extroverts love parties and crowds because the sensory

297
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:55,702
stimulation is entertaining and energizing.

298
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:02,249
We've shown you before in one of our earlier talks

299
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:05,370
the linkages between the personality trait of extroversion

300
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,791
and the gaming motivation of excitement.

301
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:10,012
So we've typically described excitement, again,

302
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,712
as a speed and pacing of the game,

303
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:15,093
but at its core, it's about the stimulus delta

304
00:16:15,553 --> 00:16:16,874
from one moment to the next.

305
00:16:17,314 --> 00:16:19,975
How much change, whether that's in the visuals,

306
00:16:20,435 --> 00:16:21,055
in the audio,

307
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:28,184
How much change happened just now is about the amount of novelty and unexpected change

308
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:30,985
from moment to moment and our desire for that novelty.

309
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:35,807
This is why surprise is one of the key words in our summary table.

310
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,410
So in the high end.

311
00:16:43,507 --> 00:16:46,168
You have action shooters and action fighters like CSGO,

312
00:16:46,748 --> 00:16:49,089
Super Smash Brothers, games that are fast-paced

313
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,290
and we're constantly bombarded with new information.

314
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,511
And in the low end, we find games that are turn-based,

315
00:16:54,091 --> 00:16:56,332
or even games that are typically played while paused,

316
00:16:56,472 --> 00:16:57,632
like Europa Universalis.

317
00:16:58,052 --> 00:17:00,593
These are games where you have perfect control of the pacing.

318
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:02,754
If you need more time, you can take as much time as you need.

319
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,775
Nothing in the game world changes

320
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:06,776
until you're ready for a change to happen.

321
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:09,697
So in this sense, the game experience is predictable.

322
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:14,369
Things tend to change in very incremental and gradual ways.

323
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,495
The game state from one moment to the next is very similar.

324
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:24,547
I feel a little dirty showing you this slide.

325
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:28,486
But I want to make an important statistical point,

326
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:31,167
and it's easy to show this via the MBTI.

327
00:17:31,547 --> 00:17:34,529
The MBTI, very briefly, makes a strong assumption

328
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:37,550
that people have clear preferences along four dimensions.

329
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,331
So for example, in this first dimension,

330
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:40,652
people tend to prefer

331
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:43,213
and either be introverts or extroverts.

332
00:17:43,573 --> 00:17:45,474
That's where the E and the I come from in the model.

333
00:17:45,494 --> 00:17:46,775
And so together, these four dimensions

334
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,096
create the 16 possible personality types.

335
00:17:51,165 --> 00:17:54,546
So here's a graphical representation of the MBTI's worldview.

336
00:17:54,946 --> 00:17:59,809
It's assuming that there are two subpopulations, one that leans towards introversion, another

337
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:04,190
that leans towards extroversion, and there are some people in between, but they're uncommon.

338
00:18:05,771 --> 00:18:10,293
So you can imagine that these people in the middle who are uncommon might feel the need

339
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:14,775
to come up with a new label to describe themselves, because they're neither introverts or extroverts.

340
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:19,357
You may have seen these posts on your Facebook wall about ambiverts.

341
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:24,378
But the reality, based on decades of research

342
00:18:24,518 --> 00:18:27,301
in personality psychology, is that personality traits

343
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:30,864
all fall along a normal distribution, a bell curve.

344
00:18:31,325 --> 00:18:33,947
So we already had a word for amberverts.

345
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,709
That word is average.

346
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:41,590
There are two important properties of the bell curve.

347
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,033
So first, most people fall very close to the average.

348
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:48,558
About 68% of the population falls within one standard deviation of the average.

349
00:18:48,598 --> 00:18:50,381
That's a little over two-thirds of the population.

350
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:53,324
And very few people fall in the extremes.

351
00:18:53,504 --> 00:18:58,170
Only about 5% of the population falls more than two standard deviations away from the norm.

352
00:19:02,232 --> 00:19:07,657
Because most people fall near the average, the core statistical and validity problem

353
00:19:07,677 --> 00:19:11,360
of the MBTI is that it's ignoring this big hump in the room.

354
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,725
And this, among other reasons, is why the MBTI is poor reliability because people, most

355
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:20,829
people who are near the center, when they retake the test, their scores, their types

356
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:24,853
will shift because they were so close to center and they're being sliced in half on one side

357
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:25,273
of the other.

358
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:30,788
Of course, introverts and extroverts do exist, but most people have weak or almost no preferences,

359
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:33,676
and far few people have strong preferences.

360
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,643
Going back to the thermometer model,

361
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,904
another problem with the thermometer model

362
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:43,506
is that it encourages people, can conceptualize gamers

363
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,388
and gaming motivations in a biased way

364
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:49,390
because it implicitly measures everyone else

365
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,251
against this ideal hardcore gamer.

366
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:54,192
It makes it easy to start talking about some gamers

367
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:55,853
as being lesser than.

368
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:59,655
So these folks with low scores are not real gamers.

369
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:02,297
But the reason why I bring up the personalized psychology,

370
00:20:03,657 --> 00:20:05,658
is because the extroversion spectrum

371
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:09,461
highlights how lower scores are not simply lesser than.

372
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:14,616
So for example, people on both ends of the extroversion

373
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:18,037
spectrum have equally strong preferences and attitudes.

374
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,798
And people at the extreme ends of both

375
00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:24,079
are equally difficult to deal with in real life.

376
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,359
So instead of the thermometer model,

377
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:29,300
the more appropriate reading isn't more of or less

378
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,101
of something, but that there are lots

379
00:20:31,141 --> 00:20:34,422
of average people in the middle and some really opinionated

380
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:36,442
people on both ends of the extreme.

381
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:38,563
So more importantly, the thing to keep in mind

382
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:40,283
is that introverts don't have.

383
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:43,409
less personality than extroverts.

384
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,372
And it's the same with gaming motivations.

385
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:48,137
Many gamers have moderate, near-average scores

386
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:50,181
on the motivations, and a smaller number

387
00:20:50,341 --> 00:20:52,685
have more extreme, stronger preferences.

388
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:59,455
So it's your delta from the average that largely defines you.

389
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:04,137
It's the way you stand out from the crowd that are the most interesting and visible

390
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:04,858
parts of you.

391
00:21:05,318 --> 00:21:09,360
The ways in which you conform to the norm are the least interesting parts of who you

392
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:09,600
are.

393
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,281
No one will remember you for having ten fingers.

394
00:21:14,711 --> 00:21:17,052
This is why in our blog posts and in our talks,

395
00:21:17,112 --> 00:21:20,272
we always visualize motivations from the norm.

396
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:23,453
This makes it much easier to identify the motivations that

397
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:25,314
are very different from the average,

398
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:27,594
whereas the bars that are close to the average

399
00:21:27,674 --> 00:21:29,775
are very small and less visually prominent.

400
00:21:30,495 --> 00:21:32,235
There's a more subtle reason here as well.

401
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:35,156
Traits like extroversion, strategy

402
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:36,476
like in our gaming motivation model,

403
00:21:37,117 --> 00:21:42,962
are entirely man-made constructs, and they only exist and are meaningful in relation to other people.

404
00:21:43,363 --> 00:21:47,566
If you're the only person left in the world, you're neither tall or short, because there's

405
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:53,592
no one else to compare you to. Similarly, you care more or less about strategy only relative to other

406
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:59,017
gamers, and thus the population norm is the only meaningful reference point for personality traits

407
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,458
and for gaming motivations.

408
00:22:05,637 --> 00:22:06,858
Community is next.

409
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:10,362
Community and competition are the two motivations

410
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:12,083
that fall under social.

411
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,686
Community is about working with other players,

412
00:22:14,786 --> 00:22:17,149
competition is about working against other players.

413
00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:21,251
Community is about shared experiences,

414
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:24,974
of being willing to not be fully in control of your game

415
00:22:25,034 --> 00:22:28,297
experience, being open to experiencing the game

416
00:22:28,357 --> 00:22:30,239
through someone else's eyes and actions.

417
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,481
There's an interplay here between dependence

418
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:35,924
versus independence, collaboration versus control.

419
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:41,058
So on the high end, we see games like Destiny,

420
00:22:41,498 --> 00:22:45,039
Final Fantasy XIV, MMOs, and online team-based shooters

421
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:47,700
that emphasize teamwork and collaboration.

422
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,281
On the low end, we see games that emphasize independence,

423
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:56,222
soloable campaigns, and content like Lego Harry Potter

424
00:22:56,322 --> 00:22:58,663
and Farm Hero Saga, games where you're always

425
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,843
in full control of the game experience.

426
00:23:04,207 --> 00:23:06,409
Here's the plot of community by gender and age.

427
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,091
I'll make two points.

428
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:11,195
We stereotype women as social care bearers,

429
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:13,497
but between ages 13 through 35,

430
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:16,461
it's the men who care more about community and teamwork.

431
00:23:17,412 --> 00:23:19,234
There's an alternative reading of this chart,

432
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:20,355
and I always try to be careful when

433
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:23,678
we look at the charts for competition and for community.

434
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,582
The apparent delta here could be an artifact of toxicity

435
00:23:28,662 --> 00:23:32,025
in online games, that it dampens the appeal of online games

436
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:36,249
for younger female gamers, and that it recovers past age 40,

437
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:41,053
because in our data, there's a shift towards non-shooter MMOs

438
00:23:41,534 --> 00:23:44,256
in that age range, where toxicity is less of an issue.

439
00:23:45,037 --> 00:23:48,057
So that's always one thing that we want to be careful about

440
00:23:48,077 --> 00:23:50,678
in terms of interpreting what these differences in community

441
00:23:50,718 --> 00:23:52,359
and competition may or may not mean.

442
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:56,680
The thermometer model tricks us into thinking

443
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,381
that higher scores always means more of something.

444
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,842
But the spectrum model better surfaces

445
00:24:02,862 --> 00:24:04,942
that there are always trade-offs going on.

446
00:24:05,002 --> 00:24:07,883
So for example, we could conceptualize high community

447
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:11,284
as the willingness to give up some of your control.

448
00:24:12,364 --> 00:24:17,567
in terms of gameplay, whereas low community is a desire to hoard as much control as possible.

449
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:22,010
Laying out both ends of the motivations highlights how there's a give and take,

450
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:26,513
always a give and take going on, rather than just more or less of a preference.

451
00:24:29,675 --> 00:24:32,756
We're moving on to competition, the other motivation under the social pair.

452
00:24:34,695 --> 00:24:37,538
One of the things that I've noticed about my own gaming preferences

453
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:41,461
is that I like the strategic gameplay of

454
00:24:42,362 --> 00:24:45,244
CCC's collectible card games like Hearthstone, but I

455
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:49,648
dislike the emotional state playing against another player puts me in.

456
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:53,071
So it took me a while to realize that that emotional state

457
00:24:53,471 --> 00:24:56,254
is an acute stress cascade, or what we typically call the

458
00:24:56,554 --> 00:25:00,658
the fight-or-flight response. So anxiety triggers this response, regardless of

459
00:25:00,678 --> 00:25:01,478
whether it's a real bear

460
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:02,559
or virtual bear.

461
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,902
If your hands ever get super cold

462
00:25:06,502 --> 00:25:07,863
after playing a competitive game,

463
00:25:08,464 --> 00:25:10,065
that's from the adrenaline rush that's

464
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:13,268
diverting your blood flow to your arm and leg

465
00:25:13,308 --> 00:25:14,949
muscles away from your extremities.

466
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:16,530
So during the fight or flight response,

467
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,192
our bodies get flooded with cortisol, adrenaline,

468
00:25:19,573 --> 00:25:21,875
which have many downstream physiological effects

469
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,776
to help us deal with or flee from danger.

470
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,958
And even though we're not actually in danger,

471
00:25:26,378 --> 00:25:29,020
it's a carryover effect of old biological circuits

472
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,961
and virtual simulations.

473
00:25:30,742 --> 00:25:35,364
But in the same way that some people like watching horror movies,

474
00:25:35,904 --> 00:25:38,825
they like getting scared, or people who go skydiving,

475
00:25:39,385 --> 00:25:42,607
that mild adrenaline rush is pleasurable for some people

476
00:25:43,047 --> 00:25:47,249
because endorphins are also being released during the cascade.

477
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:52,131
So one way to think of the appeal of competition

478
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:56,332
is that it's a way to hack your own biochemistry to get the adrenaline

479
00:25:56,492 --> 00:26:00,014
endorphin rushes without actually being in real danger. It's a kind of

480
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:01,556
biological hacking.

481
00:26:03,442 --> 00:26:08,283
I find that another useful framing to think about competition is the way we think about

482
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:10,144
conflict in board games.

483
00:26:10,824 --> 00:26:16,065
So on one end, you have high-conflict games, like Warhammer, where my miniature units are

484
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:18,086
directly attacking your units and killing them.

485
00:26:18,806 --> 00:26:23,287
There's a middle ground, like in Agricola, where we're competing against each other for

486
00:26:23,327 --> 00:26:28,408
a high score, but we're all largely in our own walled gardens, and I can only indirect

487
00:26:28,468 --> 00:26:30,508
interfere with what you're trying to do.

488
00:26:31,739 --> 00:26:33,700
And then there's the other end where there's no conflict.

489
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:36,983
There's no rankings, no duels against other human players.

490
00:26:37,023 --> 00:26:39,425
Games that aren't about comparing your skills

491
00:26:39,825 --> 00:26:41,266
or abilities against other players.

492
00:26:41,326 --> 00:26:43,168
So here in the high competition end,

493
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:46,150
we have MOBAs, online shooters like League and Call of Duty.

494
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:48,532
On the low competition end, we have games

495
00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:50,534
where there are no rankings or duels

496
00:26:50,574 --> 00:26:51,715
against other human players.

497
00:26:52,215 --> 00:26:54,777
The sorceress that turns into a dragon to attack you

498
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:57,079
isn't competition, that's drama.

499
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:01,735
We're on to completion.

500
00:27:02,476 --> 00:27:05,120
The achievement pair is about different kinds

501
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,402
of point systems.

502
00:27:08,431 --> 00:27:11,454
And completion is about quantifiable,

503
00:27:12,074 --> 00:27:13,976
persistent progress and rewards.

504
00:27:14,016 --> 00:27:17,499
It's about knowing how far exactly you are from a goal.

505
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:20,922
It's about having a clear task with clear instructions

506
00:27:21,343 --> 00:27:23,525
and having a clear way to assess how close you are

507
00:27:23,565 --> 00:27:24,866
to reaching that goal.

508
00:27:25,406 --> 00:27:27,388
So completion can almost always be converted

509
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:30,811
to a zero to 100% percentage bar, whether by itself

510
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,273
or as part of a larger hierarchy of tasks.

511
00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:36,379
Games that score high on completion

512
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,400
tend to be very task-oriented, with clear, predictable

513
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,761
conversion mechanics between time and rewards.

514
00:27:43,101 --> 00:27:46,002
So in our data, MMOs, especially Asian MMOs,

515
00:27:46,463 --> 00:27:50,324
like Dragon Nest, Aura Kingdom, scored very high on completion.

516
00:27:50,844 --> 00:27:52,925
Games that score low on completion

517
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:56,626
tend to be more sandboxy games, where there are rules,

518
00:27:57,006 --> 00:27:58,907
but the player has to decide what they want to do.

519
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:02,729
where the players have to figure out what goals they want to pursue on their own.

520
00:28:03,229 --> 00:28:05,131
Don't tell me what I have to do.

521
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:07,732
I'm going to decide for myself if I'm going to dominate the world

522
00:28:08,112 --> 00:28:09,633
and how I'm going to dominate the world.

523
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:14,376
So on the low completion end, we have games like Victoria 2, Kerbal Space Program.

524
00:28:16,752 --> 00:28:18,372
Completion, we've mentioned this before I think,

525
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:22,253
completion is the most age-stable motivation in our model.

526
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:25,354
It increases ever so slightly among women

527
00:28:25,814 --> 00:28:28,655
over the age span, and it decreases ever so slightly

528
00:28:28,755 --> 00:28:29,655
among men over the age span.

529
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:30,676
So as people get older,

530
00:28:31,016 --> 00:28:33,076
the gender difference gets a little wider.

531
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:36,197
But overall, it's the motivation in our model

532
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:38,578
that changes the least over age.

533
00:28:41,615 --> 00:28:44,938
Over the past year or so, we've been working with Nico Partners

534
00:28:45,438 --> 00:28:47,260
on a series of survey-based projects.

535
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,443
Nico Partners is a market research and consulting firm

536
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:52,325
that covers the games market in Asia.

537
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:56,509
And in one of these projects, we surveyed 2,000 Chinese gamers

538
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,092
and included the motivation assessment questions.

539
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:03,613
It wasn't the direct goal of that study to do the cross-cultural comparison,

540
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:09,595
but the data allowed us to do it. So we compared gamers in the U.S. from our dataset

541
00:29:10,195 --> 00:29:15,216
against gamers in China from Nikko's dataset, using the same motivation questions,

542
00:29:15,537 --> 00:29:17,137
translated of course as simplified Chinese.

543
00:29:19,118 --> 00:29:21,780
And we first looked at the differences,

544
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,741
and we found these striking differences

545
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,303
in gaming motivations between the two samples.

546
00:29:26,363 --> 00:29:28,844
So in this chart, China is the gray bars,

547
00:29:29,105 --> 00:29:30,846
and the US is the orange bars.

548
00:29:31,586 --> 00:29:35,649
So in particular, Chinese gamers scored much higher

549
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:37,910
on the two motivations that we just covered,

550
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:40,392
on competition and on completion.

551
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,311
And they scored lower on fantasy story discovery designs,

552
00:29:45,331 --> 00:29:48,812
so their creativity immersion motivations.

553
00:29:49,212 --> 00:29:52,353
To give you a sense of the size of the difference here in,

554
00:29:52,873 --> 00:29:53,794
let's do competition.

555
00:29:54,414 --> 00:29:56,915
The average gamer in Nico's sample,

556
00:29:57,415 --> 00:29:58,495
Nico Parner's sample,

557
00:29:58,955 --> 00:30:00,736
cares more about competition than roughly 75%

558
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:03,857
of the US gamers in our sample.

559
00:30:06,462 --> 00:30:09,684
We dug a little deeper into the data,

560
00:30:10,524 --> 00:30:12,425
and in other places where we expected

561
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:13,325
there to be differences,

562
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:15,546
the differences turned out to be very small.

563
00:30:16,486 --> 00:30:18,687
So this is a chart of the motivation differences.

564
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:21,108
We've shown you this data in a different way in previous.

565
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:26,091
talks, gender differences and motivations among our full data set.

566
00:30:26,131 --> 00:30:30,954
So we've seen before that the men, the gray bars, they care more about competition, excitement,

567
00:30:30,974 --> 00:30:31,494
destruction.

568
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:34,276
The women, they care more about fantasy design completion.

569
00:30:34,516 --> 00:30:38,198
We've shown you this data before in a different graph.

570
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:44,741
So we try to see, you know, do these differences pan out the same way in China or do different

571
00:30:45,021 --> 00:30:45,902
differences come out?

572
00:30:47,383 --> 00:30:50,404
And so here's a chart for the China gamers.

573
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:54,474
Most of the, so those are the error bars.

574
00:30:54,814 --> 00:30:58,496
Most of the bars are not even statistically different.

575
00:30:59,016 --> 00:31:00,956
Of the ones that are, the only one

576
00:31:01,417 --> 00:31:04,998
that is substantively meaningful is the one in destruction.

577
00:31:05,158 --> 00:31:08,779
So in the Chinese sample, the men cared more

578
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:10,760
about destruction than the women.

579
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,801
But across the other 11,

580
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,801
there are essentially no gender differences.

581
00:31:16,161 --> 00:31:18,422
Whereas in the US, the Western data,

582
00:31:18,842 --> 00:31:20,083
there were differences all over the map.

583
00:31:20,783 --> 00:31:24,866
So we talk a lot about gendered gaming differences in the West and the American context,

584
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:29,409
but what this data is kind of hinting and surfacing is that perhaps the gender differences

585
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:34,833
in gaming that we see in the West may be unique to the West, and that this would also imply that

586
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:40,016
they could be entirely an artifact of culture and marketing and historical idiosyncrasies

587
00:31:40,477 --> 00:31:42,498
without really needing to invoke biology.

588
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:46,299
We saw this paralleled with the age data.

589
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:49,301
So, you know, again, let me talk through the column,

590
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:50,642
the second column, the US column.

591
00:31:51,863 --> 00:31:54,845
You know, I've been talking about how motivations like competition,

592
00:31:55,445 --> 00:31:58,868
like destruction, excitement,

593
00:31:58,968 --> 00:32:01,630
these are motivations that decline with age.

594
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,031
So these are the correlation coefficients.

595
00:32:04,332 --> 00:32:08,394
In the US, there are seven of the 12 motivations

596
00:32:08,895 --> 00:32:10,496
that have a correlation coefficient above .10.

597
00:32:11,577 --> 00:32:15,762
it's a small to medium-sized correlation. In the Chinese data,

598
00:32:16,022 --> 00:32:20,807
among the Chinese sample, none of the age correlations were above

599
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:24,351
0.1. So across the age span in China,

600
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:29,671
the variation in motivations was very, very low.

601
00:32:30,391 --> 00:32:33,192
So Chinese gamers as a whole are very different

602
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:36,014
from US gamers, but within the audience of Chinese gamers,

603
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:38,735
there's much less variation than one would expect

604
00:32:38,795 --> 00:32:42,476
based on what we'd previously seen in our Western data set.

605
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:45,507
What we can say, we'd love to know why.

606
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,749
What we can't say is why these differences

607
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:49,551
or lack of differences are the way they are.

608
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:52,674
But there are two things that struck out for us

609
00:32:52,894 --> 00:32:56,357
when you go partners and we were looking through this data.

610
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:58,879
The difference, especially in competition,

611
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,642
goes against traditional assumptions between individualist versus collectivist societies.

612
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:10,906
So previous cultural findings in academia would have predicted that a more individualist society

613
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:15,788
like the U.S. should score higher on competition, but we're finding here the exact opposite.

614
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:18,390
The second point is that the Chinese gaming market

615
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,449
has been able to develop in a semi-isolated manner

616
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:24,429
due to a variety of governmental regulations,

617
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:27,270
such as the ban until recently on Western consoles,

618
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,510
the cultural review of content, the Great Firewall.

619
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,291
Net cafe culture has also encouraged greater adoption

620
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:35,991
of specific genres of games,

621
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:37,732
such as online multiplayer games.

622
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:40,792
And of course, the Chinese market makes its own games,

623
00:33:40,832 --> 00:33:41,992
a large number of them, in fact.

624
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:43,833
So part of what we're seeing may stem

625
00:33:43,853 --> 00:33:45,233
from the different sensibilities

626
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:47,213
and emphasis that their games have.

627
00:33:48,314 --> 00:33:51,395
and how their gamers have historically adopted gaming.

628
00:33:51,435 --> 00:33:53,915
So, for example, many popular Chinese games

629
00:33:54,396 --> 00:33:56,616
aren't available or known in the US market.

630
00:33:56,977 --> 00:33:58,977
So these two populations aren't really even playing

631
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:00,678
the same games to begin with.

632
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,961
We were just talking about completion.

633
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:11,061
Power is the other motivation

634
00:34:11,402 --> 00:34:12,942
in the pair of achievement motivations.

635
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:16,748
where completion is about getting to 100%,

636
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:21,511
power is about constant growth in absolute numbers.

637
00:34:21,912 --> 00:34:23,533
So power is about getting bigger,

638
00:34:23,653 --> 00:34:25,194
getting stronger over time.

639
00:34:25,254 --> 00:34:27,195
It's almost always numbers driven

640
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:29,797
because you need numbers to quantify how much you've grown.

641
00:34:31,512 --> 00:34:33,794
But power isn't really the end goal.

642
00:34:33,914 --> 00:34:36,437
It's more likely that the appeal is centered

643
00:34:36,697 --> 00:34:39,200
on the journey of growth that is satisfying,

644
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,002
the appeal of getting stronger.

645
00:34:41,582 --> 00:34:43,244
So another contrast with completion

646
00:34:43,304 --> 00:34:46,588
is that completion goals tend to stick around

647
00:34:46,808 --> 00:34:48,289
on a very persistent basis.

648
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,032
The stars you collect, the levels you completed,

649
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:52,734
they stick with your character or your game.

650
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,916
Whereas power can be more transient

651
00:34:56,996 --> 00:34:58,357
because it's the journey that matters.

652
00:34:58,457 --> 00:35:01,701
So here in high power, we have games like World of Warcraft

653
00:35:01,761 --> 00:35:03,983
and League, and your champion in League

654
00:35:04,063 --> 00:35:05,524
gets stronger over each match.

655
00:35:05,845 --> 00:35:08,467
But then it resets, and you can start it all over again.

656
00:35:08,647 --> 00:35:11,550
And that's fine, because it's the journey that's pleasurable.

657
00:35:12,331 --> 00:35:17,313
Low power is not the lack of growth as much as it is a desire to not be on a treadmill,

658
00:35:17,673 --> 00:35:19,693
to not be part of implicit rat race.

659
00:35:20,053 --> 00:35:23,154
These games here tend to be more about adventure and story.

660
00:35:23,194 --> 00:35:26,655
So example here are The Longest Journey and Her Story.

661
00:35:29,276 --> 00:35:32,957
We've talked about excitement already, and now we're touching on the other motivation

662
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:34,358
in the action pair, destruction.

663
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:43,220
We have guns and explosives under the description for destruction, but at its heart, destruction

664
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:49,165
is about being drawn to chaos and mayhem, the erosion of rules, letting entropy have

665
00:35:49,206 --> 00:35:49,626
its day.

666
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,828
When I was a grad student at Stanford,

667
00:35:52,589 --> 00:35:56,070
and I was showing my advisor Second Life so many, many moons ago.

668
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:01,213
I was showing him the basics, and we were just about to leave the Newby area.

669
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,434
And he suddenly got very excited, and he asked,

670
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,415
are you allowed to sit on that person?

671
00:36:05,936 --> 00:36:07,136
Can we go sit on people?

672
00:36:09,197 --> 00:36:10,818
That's low-grade destruction.

673
00:36:12,481 --> 00:36:15,363
So it's not surprising that destruction is highest in games

674
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:19,207
where you can destroy things the fastest, which is shooters.

675
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:21,729
It's watching order turn into disorder.

676
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:24,211
We'd have expected that construction

677
00:36:24,731 --> 00:36:27,073
would be the other end of destruction, but it's not.

678
00:36:27,734 --> 00:36:30,296
It's enduring and evergreen world.

679
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,898
So these are games that are reliably constant

680
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:35,700
that you can revisit over and over again.

681
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:38,623
Games like Professor Layton, like Myst,

682
00:36:38,683 --> 00:36:39,684
like Animal Crossing.

683
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:41,285
It's like the virtual.

684
00:36:41,685 --> 00:36:46,328
corner coffee shop that offers a sense of comforting, reliable familiarity.

685
00:36:47,188 --> 00:36:53,452
We had someone ask us recently where we think construction would fit in our model, and we

686
00:36:53,472 --> 00:36:54,012
thought about it.

687
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:59,355
And we think construction is typically a means and not an ends, and let me talk through this.

688
00:36:59,855 --> 00:37:03,497
So building an empire in civilization, that's strategy.

689
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:09,701
building a city in SimCity so I can blow it up with disasters, that's destruction,

690
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:17,206
building King's Landing in Minecraft so I can role-play being Cersei, that's fantasy and story,

691
00:37:17,847 --> 00:37:22,670
and seeing if I can build a roller coaster in Kerbal Space Program, that's more discovery.

692
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:22,730
So...

693
00:37:24,651 --> 00:37:27,852
We've tried experimenting with survey items related to construction,

694
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,414
and it doesn't quite cling anywhere, we think, for this reason.

695
00:37:31,474 --> 00:37:33,475
It depends on why you're building something,

696
00:37:33,915 --> 00:37:36,716
and construction in and of itself isn't a clear signal.

697
00:37:39,017 --> 00:37:41,959
Destruction is most appealing to the youngest gamers,

698
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:44,059
particularly the youngest men.

699
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,800
I'm sure you're all shocked.

700
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,613
It then plateaus for about two decades.

701
00:37:50,113 --> 00:37:52,456
It doesn't plummet like competition does.

702
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:54,158
And then it's only past age 40

703
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:55,860
that it really starts to drop again.

704
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,121
There's a gender difference

705
00:37:57,161 --> 00:37:59,343
and it gets slightly larger over the age span.

706
00:38:01,797 --> 00:38:08,824
fantasy. The immersion pairs about being part of the game world in different ways. So fantasy is

707
00:38:08,864 --> 00:38:14,210
the willingness to suspend disbelief and be transported to an alternate reality, the desire

708
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:19,735
to become someone else, somewhere else. It's about the psychological teleportation to another world

709
00:38:20,155 --> 00:38:25,040
and it hinges on the richness of that alternate world, its lore, its scope, and its visual design.

710
00:38:25,961 --> 00:38:30,883
So in our data, games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age scored highest on fantasy.

711
00:38:31,003 --> 00:38:33,904
Again, games with rich worlds and history and lore.

712
00:38:34,524 --> 00:38:37,665
Games that score low on fantasy usually fall into one of two camps.

713
00:38:37,745 --> 00:38:40,306
They're either abstract puzzle games like Candy Crush,

714
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:42,947
or when they have 3D worlds and detailed graphics,

715
00:38:43,427 --> 00:38:47,048
the worlds and settings tend to be generic and interchangeable.

716
00:38:47,088 --> 00:38:50,370
So like a desert encampment or a rough terrain in a shooter game.

717
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,931
Here we see Counter-Strike, for example, on that end of the spectrum.

718
00:38:56,686 --> 00:39:00,126
I have a story that's hell about fantasy and the adoption of VR.

719
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:04,871
We ran a survey alongside the Gamer Motivation profile

720
00:39:05,892 --> 00:39:07,974
on VR adoption and satisfaction.

721
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:11,077
We had about 2,400 responses to that survey

722
00:39:11,217 --> 00:39:12,618
over a period of the past 12 months,

723
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:17,883
of which 31% were adopters of current-gen, high-end VR.

724
00:39:17,963 --> 00:39:23,929
So one of either Oculus, Samsung Gear, PSVR, or HTC Vive.

725
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:28,132
So the gray bars are gamers who haven't adopted VR.

726
00:39:28,653 --> 00:39:31,134
The orange bars are the gamers who have.

727
00:39:31,754 --> 00:39:33,995
When we compared the motivations of the two cohorts,

728
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:37,657
we were expecting fantasy to be a predictor of VR adoption.

729
00:39:38,177 --> 00:39:38,917
It turns out it isn't.

730
00:39:39,518 --> 00:39:41,779
The best motivational predictors of VR adoption

731
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,780
are destruction and excitement.

732
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,801
So people who like fast-paced chaos and mayhem

733
00:39:47,161 --> 00:39:49,702
have been more likely to go out and purchase VR,

734
00:39:50,062 --> 00:39:51,103
fans of shooter games.

735
00:39:51,763 --> 00:39:53,204
This is interesting from a...

736
00:39:55,147 --> 00:39:58,409
disposable income point of view, because VR is currently expensive.

737
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,733
And these two motivations, destruction and excitement, these two motivations

738
00:40:03,053 --> 00:40:05,875
both drop quite fast with age. So older gamers

739
00:40:06,376 --> 00:40:10,359
with more disposable income and can afford VR are precisely the gamers who

740
00:40:10,379 --> 00:40:16,944
have dampened motivational interest in VR. We looked one step further into the

741
00:40:16,984 --> 00:40:21,248
data. So we looked only at the gamers who had purchased and adopted VR.

742
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:25,944
We asked them, how satisfied are you with your purchase,

743
00:40:26,244 --> 00:40:27,024
with the technology?

744
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:31,546
And we divided into three groups based on their satisfaction.

745
00:40:32,146 --> 00:40:35,127
So the gray bar are those with low satisfaction.

746
00:40:35,547 --> 00:40:37,768
They are not at all or only slightly satisfied.

747
00:40:38,288 --> 00:40:40,809
The middle orange bar is medium satisfaction.

748
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:42,470
They are somewhat satisfied.

749
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,390
And the blue bar is high satisfaction.

750
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,251
They are very satisfied or extremely satisfied.

751
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:54,175
And it's here that we see fantasy along with discovery pop up as being differentiators.

752
00:40:55,562 --> 00:40:59,103
VR adopters who also care about fantasy and discovery

753
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,504
are more likely to be the ones to be satisfied

754
00:41:01,544 --> 00:41:02,464
with their VR purchase.

755
00:41:02,864 --> 00:41:05,765
So an analogy might be what gets people through the door

756
00:41:06,365 --> 00:41:07,865
is not the same as what keeps them happy

757
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:08,765
once they're inside.

758
00:41:08,805 --> 00:41:12,046
And in this specific case, the desire to be someone else,

759
00:41:12,526 --> 00:41:15,907
somewhere else, isn't enough to get someone to purchase VR.

760
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,847
But if they do make the purchase,

761
00:41:18,328 --> 00:41:20,648
these are the gamers who are more likely to be satisfied

762
00:41:20,928 --> 00:41:21,688
with the technology.

763
00:41:24,396 --> 00:41:26,500
We're here with discovery in the creativity pair.

764
00:41:27,081 --> 00:41:30,689
I often describe discovery as playing games

765
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:32,353
in the broadest sense of the word.

766
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:37,951
So it's easy to think of discovery as just the exploration of a world,

767
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:41,813
but it's actually more about exploring and poking at the boundaries of the game itself

768
00:41:41,853 --> 00:41:44,495
and figuring out what is and isn't possible.

769
00:41:45,095 --> 00:41:48,738
So in this sense, it's about the number of unknowns when you start playing a game,

770
00:41:48,758 --> 00:41:52,000
not just in terms of the geography, the places you haven't seen,

771
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,122
but the rules of what you can and cannot do in that world.

772
00:41:56,743 --> 00:41:58,324
So games that have high discovery...

773
00:41:59,192 --> 00:42:00,393
tend to have lots of secrets.

774
00:42:00,974 --> 00:42:03,596
There are hidden caves to discover, hidden quests to find,

775
00:42:03,957 --> 00:42:06,860
but also lots of hidden or possible interactions

776
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:09,323
between objects and spells and abilities.

777
00:42:09,343 --> 00:42:10,424
So for example, in Skyrim,

778
00:42:11,285 --> 00:42:13,367
is it possible to become a vampire

779
00:42:13,808 --> 00:42:15,770
and survive without ever killing a person?

780
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,831
I just realized how many vampire examples I have in this talk.

781
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:25,073
Gamers with high discovery would ask such a question, and games with high discovery

782
00:42:25,393 --> 00:42:29,094
provide the opportunity for many of these questions to be asked.

783
00:42:29,634 --> 00:42:34,395
So games of low discovery, on the other hand, have fully exposed rule sets from the get-go.

784
00:42:34,835 --> 00:42:39,416
It's like chess with very few unknowns in terms of unknown interactions.

785
00:42:40,548 --> 00:42:44,450
No new variables or rules are introduced in the middle of the game.

786
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:49,252
These are gamers prefer well-defined, well-bounded, unchanging rule sets.

787
00:42:52,234 --> 00:42:58,297
Challenge is the other motivation in the mastery pair, both of which revolve around more long-term

788
00:42:58,377 --> 00:42:59,378
oriented gameplay.

789
00:43:02,189 --> 00:43:05,430
The appeal of challenge lies in wanting to get better at something.

790
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,211
This necessitates a skill component, because you can't get better at something that is

791
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:11,891
completely based on chance alone.

792
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:18,173
So high challenge is reflected in the appeal of skill-based gates, barriers, difficult

793
00:43:18,213 --> 00:43:23,474
missions and bosses, system complexity, and above all, the ability to practice and master

794
00:43:23,494 --> 00:43:24,395
a skill.

795
00:43:24,455 --> 00:43:26,815
So in our data, some of the games with the highest challenge.

796
00:43:27,575 --> 00:43:30,298
are Super Smash Brothers, Dota, osu!,

797
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:32,241
these are all games with complex moves

798
00:43:32,281 --> 00:43:34,903
and reward practice and mastery over time.

799
00:43:35,604 --> 00:43:36,866
On the other hand is the appeal.

800
00:43:37,995 --> 00:43:41,918
is the appeal of, and I'm totally borrowing from Nicole Lazaro's fun case here,

801
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:43,860
the appeal of easy fun.

802
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,883
And one description that Nicole has given in the past in her model is

803
00:43:48,604 --> 00:43:49,905
fun failure states

804
00:43:50,746 --> 00:43:52,908
that the game doesn't punish you for mistakes,

805
00:43:53,348 --> 00:43:56,010
like ending your game. These games tend to be easy to learn

806
00:43:56,471 --> 00:44:00,094
with few or no skill-based gates and barriers in terms of the gameplay.

807
00:44:01,677 --> 00:44:08,282
Challenge is the only motivation in our model that rebounds after age 45.

808
00:44:08,963 --> 00:44:14,607
It's also interesting that it peaks for men around age 20 before declining, whereas it

809
00:44:14,647 --> 00:44:16,208
declines right away among female gamers.

810
00:44:16,709 --> 00:44:20,872
So these two lines look very different for about 30 years up through age 35, and then

811
00:44:20,892 --> 00:44:22,794
they come together and the gender difference goes away.

812
00:44:23,414 --> 00:44:24,415
This doesn't mean that...

813
00:44:25,664 --> 00:44:28,667
Older gamers are rushing out to pick up Super Smash Brothers.

814
00:44:29,347 --> 00:44:32,330
But it does imply that older gamers may be more interested

815
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,213
in mastering skill-based games and practicing

816
00:44:35,233 --> 00:44:37,596
a game over and over again than we might assume.

817
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:41,500
Our very last motivation.

818
00:44:42,381 --> 00:44:44,503
Fantasy and story are both motivations related

819
00:44:44,543 --> 00:44:45,784
to being part of the game world.

820
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:52,515
Story is the appeal of the web of possible interactions and relationships

821
00:44:53,076 --> 00:44:58,219
among a cast of three-dimensional characters with their own histories and their own personal dramas.

822
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:01,701
It's about the richness of this web of human drama.

823
00:45:01,721 --> 00:45:06,324
So the more characters with their own quirks, with their own psychoses, with their own grudges,

824
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:10,226
the more potential interactions between characters is possible.

825
00:45:11,067 --> 00:45:14,048
So games with high story tend to have elaborate scripted dramas

826
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:18,411
with a large cast of characters, games like Dragon Age and Life is Strange.

827
00:45:19,031 --> 00:45:19,671
On the other hand...

828
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:25,590
Games with low story, gamers who score low on story,

829
00:45:26,011 --> 00:45:28,332
tend to not be interested in character-driven narratives

830
00:45:28,372 --> 00:45:28,892
and stories.

831
00:45:29,372 --> 00:45:30,553
In fact, they tend to go for games

832
00:45:30,593 --> 00:45:32,634
that don't involve people altogether.

833
00:45:33,014 --> 00:45:35,075
So games like SimCity, Transport Tycoon,

834
00:45:35,095 --> 00:45:37,197
that focus on non-people entities,

835
00:45:37,717 --> 00:45:39,618
or games where characters are just pawns

836
00:45:39,638 --> 00:45:41,959
to accomplish goals, rather than characters

837
00:45:41,979 --> 00:45:45,021
with their own motives, histories, and backstories.

838
00:45:49,597 --> 00:45:51,999
I'm gonna close with a couple of things.

839
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:54,622
I'm gonna throw in another nuance in the spectrum model.

840
00:45:55,563 --> 00:45:58,766
At one point, we were working on a project

841
00:45:58,806 --> 00:46:02,369
related to compliance to medical regimens

842
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:03,511
for a biotech company.

843
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,633
And we were looking through the literature

844
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:07,635
on how the big five personality traits

845
00:46:08,195 --> 00:46:09,897
intersect with regimen compliance.

846
00:46:09,937 --> 00:46:13,380
So taking your meds on time, following diet restrictions.

847
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:18,025
It's not surprising that conscientiousness, which is exactly what it sounds like,

848
00:46:18,406 --> 00:46:24,452
would be highly related to regimen compliance. The one that surprised us was neuroticism.

849
00:46:24,472 --> 00:46:30,478
So people with high neuroticism get anxious and nervous easily and worry a lot,

850
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:32,681
whereas people with low neuroticism

851
00:46:33,299 --> 00:46:36,281
are calm and relaxed, even in stressful situations.

852
00:46:36,941 --> 00:46:40,924
So you may imagine that low neuroticism

853
00:46:41,725 --> 00:46:43,706
is better when it comes to regimen compliance.

854
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:47,749
But the data seem to show that both high and low neuroticism

855
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,230
lead to poor outcomes.

856
00:46:50,812 --> 00:46:53,133
If you have a very low neuroticism score,

857
00:46:53,634 --> 00:46:56,115
you may be too blasé about risks and problems.

858
00:46:56,576 --> 00:46:57,777
My foot is turning blue.

859
00:46:58,317 --> 00:47:00,539
I guess I'll wait till tomorrow and see if it changes back

860
00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:00,839
color.

861
00:47:02,314 --> 00:47:03,716
And if you have very high neuroticism,

862
00:47:03,816 --> 00:47:05,659
the medical regimen may cause you to worry

863
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:06,660
and stress out all the time.

864
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,082
Oh my God, did I take the pill yet today?

865
00:47:08,382 --> 00:47:09,323
Have I forgotten to take a pill?

866
00:47:10,525 --> 00:47:12,467
Wondering if you're doing your diet regimen wrong.

867
00:47:12,808 --> 00:47:14,730
And so it seemed like a mid-level neuroticism

868
00:47:15,131 --> 00:47:17,294
had the best outcome, like Goldilocks.

869
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:19,777
Similarly, the thermometer model.

870
00:47:20,498 --> 00:47:24,259
encourages us to think that the high is good and the low end is bad,

871
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,181
and we've presented you the spectrum model where there are interesting trade-offs on both ends.

872
00:47:29,942 --> 00:47:34,964
But one thing to keep in mind is that at the extremes, you have players who are impossible

873
00:47:35,004 --> 00:47:40,486
to cater to and please. In a normal distribution, the extremes are rarely good things.

874
00:47:47,582 --> 00:47:55,006
My last slide. For all the flaws of the MBTI, it gets one thing right that the big five

875
00:47:55,046 --> 00:48:01,329
gets very wrong. If you've ever taken a personality test and the survey items feel incredibly

876
00:48:01,369 --> 00:48:07,692
judgmental, it's probably the big five. It's the test that seems like it's dying to tell

877
00:48:07,732 --> 00:48:11,413
you that you're lazy, reclusive, depressed, careless, and mean.

878
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:20,524
Academics hate the MBTI, but they often don't seem to realize just how shitty the user experience

879
00:48:20,704 --> 00:48:21,665
of the Big Five is.

880
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:29,009
They don't seem to understand that people won't share a personality profile of themselves

881
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:31,771
if it says they're lazy, depressed, careless, and mean.

882
00:48:32,571 --> 00:48:36,975
To be fair, the Big Five wasn't meant to be a self-discovery tool.

883
00:48:37,455 --> 00:48:39,037
It was designed to be an assessment tool.

884
00:48:39,657 --> 00:48:42,880
And in many cases, you're not supposed to see your own results to begin with.

885
00:48:43,241 --> 00:48:44,862
And that's why it is the way it is.

886
00:48:45,443 --> 00:48:50,287
What the MBTI gets right is the importance of value-neutral language.

887
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:54,251
And I think that's a negative space we're trying to fill here with gaming motivations because

888
00:48:54,691 --> 00:48:56,833
If the game industry doesn't have a value-neutral way

889
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:59,895
describing 50% of current, let alone potential gamers,

890
00:49:00,256 --> 00:49:02,017
then that's actually a really big problem.

891
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:06,641
Imagine if I told you that your new boss is lazy, depressed,

892
00:49:06,721 --> 00:49:08,502
careless, and mean, and then expecting

893
00:49:08,522 --> 00:49:09,523
that to have a good outcome.

894
00:49:12,626 --> 00:49:14,447
Thank you so much for coming to my talk.

895
00:49:14,507 --> 00:49:16,389
Here's the link to the PDF.

896
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:16,649
Thank you.

897
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:27,381
Thank you.

898
00:49:27,822 --> 00:49:29,685
And we have about 10 minutes for questions,

899
00:49:30,246 --> 00:49:31,869
and then I've been asked to remind you

900
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:35,075
to step up to the mics in the front to ask your questions

901
00:49:35,095 --> 00:49:36,298
so everyone else can hear your questions.

902
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,731
Hello, and thank you for the talk.

903
00:49:41,551 --> 00:49:46,033
So one thing I noticed both with the Big Five survey and

904
00:49:46,093 --> 00:49:50,315
with your own survey at the website is that over time, the

905
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:53,256
surveys are becoming shorter to allow people to take them

906
00:49:53,296 --> 00:49:54,697
more easily and more quickly.

907
00:49:55,317 --> 00:49:58,519
But when the surveys become shorter, the questions become

908
00:49:58,539 --> 00:49:59,179
more difficult.

909
00:49:59,459 --> 00:50:02,942
Very obvious and almost condescending.

910
00:50:03,102 --> 00:50:07,986
So, for example, while in an earlier version it would ask you something generic about your life

911
00:50:08,286 --> 00:50:10,868
and in a vague fashion, later on it will ask you,

912
00:50:11,328 --> 00:50:14,131
do you prefer strategic decisions?

913
00:50:15,031 --> 00:50:17,433
Yes, no. And then, oh, you're a strategy player.

914
00:50:18,134 --> 00:50:24,738
So people, a lot of us who come to those websites, already have an expectation about these surveys

915
00:50:24,778 --> 00:50:29,261
and what we should see in the end. So when we see a question like that, it's

916
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:35,246
impossible to answer it with a neutral mindset. Do you have any thoughts on that?

917
00:50:35,846 --> 00:50:44,732
Yeah, I mean, a couple of things. It's, there's, let me answer one way first.

918
00:50:47,942 --> 00:50:51,530
You may have a sense of, you know, I think I'm a more strategic player.

919
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:54,075
I think one thing that we add to that is.

920
00:50:56,529 --> 00:51:03,072
putting, giving you a sense of, on a more quantitative, numerical basis, how different

921
00:51:03,132 --> 00:51:07,695
or how far from the average you fall on some of these motivations relative to other gamers.

922
00:51:08,095 --> 00:51:12,397
So not just a higher or lower yes or no, but relative to other gamers, are you just a little

923
00:51:12,457 --> 00:51:15,179
higher or are you actually way out here on the extreme?

924
00:51:15,779 --> 00:51:20,362
The other thing is that there's just trickiness in assessment tools.

925
00:51:20,822 --> 00:51:21,683
I think there's...

926
00:51:22,263 --> 00:51:29,615
There's a weird version of psychology assessment where it's almost like divination,

927
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:34,222
where I give you these six colored squares and ask you to pick one, and I can tell you...

928
00:51:35,247 --> 00:51:36,668
You're in love with your brother-in-law.

929
00:51:37,168 --> 00:51:37,449
You know?

930
00:51:38,089 --> 00:51:40,971
There's this vision of psychology as divination.

931
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:44,273
And I think it's tough that when you

932
00:51:44,313 --> 00:51:46,094
get to the nuts and bolts of it, you

933
00:51:46,154 --> 00:51:49,517
have to ask the most precise and the most grounded questions

934
00:51:49,937 --> 00:51:52,679
to get at the most precise assessments.

935
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:54,720
And that's just one of these trade-offs in there.

936
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,761
Yeah, but that is a great question.

937
00:51:57,362 --> 00:52:00,404
And one way we try to reduce that fatigue is by reducing it.

938
00:52:00,424 --> 00:52:03,026
But you're right, there are these kind of trade-offs

939
00:52:03,066 --> 00:52:04,226
when you do the reduction.

940
00:52:05,294 --> 00:52:08,376
Please let me ask another question.

941
00:52:08,456 --> 00:52:10,037
Let me have other people, just because we're limited in time,

942
00:52:10,077 --> 00:52:12,479
but feel free to come up to me afterwards and we'll be around

943
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,340
and we'll have you take your questions after.

944
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:16,062
I just want to make sure that other people have a chance.

945
00:52:16,422 --> 00:52:16,702
Thank you.

946
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:24,458
I have a question about the national data that you had between US and China and the

947
00:52:24,498 --> 00:52:25,298
gender differences.

948
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:32,284
Have you seen real world examples of companies that have launched a game in one area of the

949
00:52:32,324 --> 00:52:37,628
world and then completely revamped it to have features in another country and seen real

950
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:38,109
success?

951
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:43,353
And conversely, have you seen something where a game that has done really well, say, in

952
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:45,255
North America with a certain feature set?

953
00:52:46,007 --> 00:52:49,610
completely go into Asia and be completely unchanged

954
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:51,691
and totally fall off the map.

955
00:52:51,791 --> 00:52:54,633
I just was wondering how what you're seeing

956
00:52:54,673 --> 00:52:58,176
is actually translating to real world success of games

957
00:52:58,196 --> 00:52:59,256
in different markets.

958
00:52:59,397 --> 00:53:00,697
Well, I'll give you a couple of examples

959
00:53:00,717 --> 00:53:01,818
that we've run across.

960
00:53:01,858 --> 00:53:05,341
So we've talked to game companies in China

961
00:53:05,741 --> 00:53:07,442
who are trying to expand in the US.

962
00:53:08,023 --> 00:53:09,243
And one of the questions that comes up is,

963
00:53:11,925 --> 00:53:13,727
what games have they tried to port over

964
00:53:13,747 --> 00:53:15,248
and what their experience has been.

965
00:53:15,668 --> 00:53:19,691
And one common thread has been a lot of the games

966
00:53:19,751 --> 00:53:23,514
in China currently are very, very grindy MMOs

967
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:28,097
that are much less palatable for people in the West.

968
00:53:28,337 --> 00:53:30,499
That they come across as being too grindy.

969
00:53:31,419 --> 00:53:34,501
Whereas they seem perfectly fine in the Chinese market.

970
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:37,804
Going the other way, we've seen instances of,

971
00:53:38,224 --> 00:53:40,746
I'm trying to think of the example.

972
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:43,191
I mean, going back to the very thing

973
00:53:43,211 --> 00:53:44,332
that we were talking about, we actually

974
00:53:44,412 --> 00:53:45,953
have seen this example of a game company

975
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:50,196
that had a game in the US that had a variety of gameplay

976
00:53:50,216 --> 00:53:53,218
modes, collaborative and competitive.

977
00:53:53,238 --> 00:53:59,063
And one thing we had kind of identified for them

978
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:05,547
was that the competitive mode was far more appealing

979
00:54:05,727 --> 00:54:06,768
among the Chinese gamers.

980
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,431
But at that point, we didn't have this data.

981
00:54:09,471 --> 00:54:10,712
We didn't have this broader data.

982
00:54:11,092 --> 00:54:11,993
So it was very difficult.

983
00:54:12,393 --> 00:54:15,296
So we'd seen this before, but they were all staring,

984
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:16,657
and they had to make this very big decision

985
00:54:16,677 --> 00:54:18,259
on we're seeing this come up

986
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:19,860
in this specific slice of the data,

987
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,783
but are you willing to take that bet?

988
00:54:23,143 --> 00:54:24,965
But now we've seen this broader survey,

989
00:54:24,985 --> 00:54:26,586
and we're like, wow, this may actually be

990
00:54:27,107 --> 00:54:30,049
a much bigger threat that if you're trying

991
00:54:30,129 --> 00:54:31,190
to port a game over in China,

992
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:32,291
one of the things to make sure of

993
00:54:32,772 --> 00:54:33,973
is that there's a PVP mode.

994
00:54:35,112 --> 00:54:39,403
So we've seen it in the survey data, but we've also seen it in some client projects as well.

995
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:39,984
Yeah.

996
00:54:40,245 --> 00:54:40,466
Thanks.

997
00:54:40,646 --> 00:54:40,927
Thank you.

998
00:54:42,495 --> 00:54:44,856
Hey, so thank you very much for the presentation.

999
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:46,816
It's really impressive segmentation.

1000
00:54:46,996 --> 00:54:50,197
My question is, I think a lot of the time

1001
00:54:50,217 --> 00:54:53,518
we're talking about motivational profile and self-assessment.

1002
00:54:54,398 --> 00:54:56,599
There is a disconnect between people

1003
00:54:56,639 --> 00:54:58,879
who can survey and build a model of,

1004
00:54:59,179 --> 00:55:01,700
and the actual players and their behaviors in game.

1005
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:05,681
And people are constantly trying to tie what, you know,

1006
00:55:05,721 --> 00:55:08,301
we have maybe a sample of certain people,

1007
00:55:08,781 --> 00:55:10,322
and we created all these different,

1008
00:55:11,382 --> 00:55:12,182
12 different profiles.

1009
00:55:13,003 --> 00:55:15,925
and we want to map that to a million players

1010
00:55:16,205 --> 00:55:18,167
in a certain game based on the way they play.

1011
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:21,089
Do you have any suggestions on tying this

1012
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:25,032
self-assessed, really language-based results

1013
00:55:25,212 --> 00:55:26,753
to behaviors in games?

1014
00:55:27,872 --> 00:55:30,873
Yeah, it's interesting and it's tough.

1015
00:55:30,933 --> 00:55:37,116
I mean, it's tough in one sense because not all games express all motivations.

1016
00:55:37,256 --> 00:55:43,098
So you cannot track someone's interest in story in a game that has no narrative.

1017
00:55:43,678 --> 00:55:45,059
So there's that missing gap.

1018
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:49,080
But the other thing is, what was I going to say?

1019
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:54,487
I forget what I was going to say.

1020
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:57,029
But the other thing is.

1021
00:56:03,315 --> 00:56:07,357
the complexity in modeling that some motivations may be easier,

1022
00:56:07,817 --> 00:56:11,238
so competition may be quite easy to infer

1023
00:56:11,479 --> 00:56:14,140
based on participation in PVPN ranks,

1024
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:17,081
whereas other motivations may be less possible.

1025
00:56:17,561 --> 00:56:20,883
I guess my biggest thought is to make sure

1026
00:56:20,903 --> 00:56:24,144
you have a broad base of behavioral telemetry in the game

1027
00:56:24,565 --> 00:56:26,786
to ensure the best potential coverage

1028
00:56:26,806 --> 00:56:28,947
and predictors of the motivations

1029
00:56:29,327 --> 00:56:32,588
before doing the machine learning to do that prediction.

1030
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:34,672
Thanks.

1031
00:56:36,432 --> 00:56:36,552
Yeah.

1032
00:56:36,572 --> 00:56:38,293
Hey, thank you for a great presentation.

1033
00:56:38,313 --> 00:56:39,733
I'm curious, when it comes to challenge,

1034
00:56:39,753 --> 00:56:41,714
you mentioned this concept of fun failure.

1035
00:56:42,174 --> 00:56:43,955
And I'm wondering if that interpretation requires

1036
00:56:43,995 --> 00:56:46,655
that the player understand there'd be a fail state, where

1037
00:56:46,675 --> 00:56:48,916
they did something incorrectly, or they made a mistake,

1038
00:56:49,016 --> 00:56:50,117
or they know they need to retry.

1039
00:56:50,597 --> 00:56:52,137
Or if it just requires that the player understand

1040
00:56:52,157 --> 00:56:54,338
there's usually a better way they could be doing it,

1041
00:56:54,658 --> 00:56:56,258
and that simply they haven't gotten to that point yet.

1042
00:56:56,753 --> 00:56:59,157
I feel it's spectrum, so I think,

1043
00:56:59,357 --> 00:57:01,401
and I can't tell which of those

1044
00:57:01,481 --> 00:57:02,843
is a little lower on the spectrum,

1045
00:57:03,124 --> 00:57:07,411
but I think they're both in that same space of that.

1046
00:57:09,489 --> 00:57:10,630
that there may be a failure.

1047
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,231
There may be a failure state,

1048
00:57:12,751 --> 00:57:16,134
but the game may decide to surface this somehow,

1049
00:57:16,234 --> 00:57:17,354
that, oh, you did something wrong,

1050
00:57:17,374 --> 00:57:18,935
but it's okay, like a character fell,

1051
00:57:18,955 --> 00:57:20,276
but they get right back up.

1052
00:57:20,897 --> 00:57:22,658
And I think they're both in that space,

1053
00:57:22,678 --> 00:57:24,419
but I don't have a concrete answer

1054
00:57:24,439 --> 00:57:26,560
for whether one of the two you mentioned

1055
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:28,161
is a little higher, a little lower than the other.

1056
00:57:28,502 --> 00:57:29,442
I think they're definitely both

1057
00:57:29,562 --> 00:57:31,464
in the right end of the spectrum.

1058
00:57:34,728 --> 00:57:37,089
Hello. Nice presentation. Thank you.

1059
00:57:37,649 --> 00:57:41,350
So for the China, the differences between China and the West,

1060
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:45,611
I'm curious if you believe that the sample size was large enough

1061
00:57:45,951 --> 00:57:50,492
or if the quality of the sample in terms of the people chosen for that sample...

1062
00:57:50,572 --> 00:57:54,734
Yeah, that's a good question. We have this as a blog post on our website

1063
00:57:54,774 --> 00:57:56,434
and there's a little bit more detail on the sampling.

1064
00:57:58,862 --> 00:58:05,786
Nico Sample, the 2000, they went through a panel provider to get that, and it was balanced

1065
00:58:05,906 --> 00:58:09,689
through the different tiers of city, it was balanced by gender.

1066
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:18,314
Our sample, larger, more self-selected, we know that our sample leans towards core gamers,

1067
00:58:18,674 --> 00:58:22,276
so 70% of our sample self-identify as core.

1068
00:58:23,037 --> 00:58:25,177
We didn't ask that question in the Niko sample,

1069
00:58:25,217 --> 00:58:27,498
but we know that more of their gamers

1070
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:29,299
only play on mobile phones.

1071
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:32,740
But in the Chinese context, that doesn't mean they're casual,

1072
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,580
because you can play on the mobile phones.

1073
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,661
So when we first looked at the data,

1074
00:58:37,401 --> 00:58:40,282
because our sample leans towards core,

1075
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:46,262
we assumed that if there were differences in competition and challenge, motivations

1076
00:58:46,342 --> 00:58:52,125
that are markers of hardcore gaming personality, that we would see it on the U.S. side, because

1077
00:58:52,145 --> 00:58:58,028
our data is biased towards core gamers. So the fascinating thing with how the data turned

1078
00:58:58,148 --> 00:59:03,291
out with Nico's data is that, in a sense, it almost sets up the lower bound.

1079
00:59:03,771 --> 00:59:05,251
of what the potential difference could be,

1080
00:59:05,731 --> 00:59:08,132
because my intuition is that Niko's data

1081
00:59:08,612 --> 00:59:11,413
is more representative of casual core hardcore gamers

1082
00:59:11,853 --> 00:59:12,473
in China.

1083
00:59:13,013 --> 00:59:15,254
So that to me is even more interesting,

1084
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:17,794
because from that point of view,

1085
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:20,315
based on our assumptions and the difference in sample sizes,

1086
00:59:20,895 --> 00:59:22,895
in a sense, the actual difference

1087
00:59:23,235 --> 00:59:25,216
may even be a little larger than that,

1088
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,936
is what my intuition is telling me,

1089
00:59:28,136 --> 00:59:31,277
because we had expected it to lean exactly the opposite way.

1090
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:33,291
Yeah.

1091
00:59:33,331 --> 00:59:33,831
OK, thank you.

1092
00:59:33,931 --> 00:59:34,331
Thank you.

1093
00:59:36,192 --> 00:59:39,453
My question has to do with how the population is distributed.

1094
00:59:39,693 --> 00:59:44,595
Since you guys have so many, essentially, surveys, answers,

1095
00:59:45,675 --> 00:59:47,676
I know with the big five that right now the challenge

1096
00:59:47,696 --> 00:59:50,897
has been like, how does the population distribute itself

1097
00:59:51,017 --> 00:59:53,318
along the five personality traits?

1098
00:59:53,378 --> 00:59:56,679
Like, what percentage is really high on neuroticism,

1099
00:59:56,739 --> 00:59:57,299
things like that?

1100
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:06,648
With you, with the surveys you guys have, do you feel you're in a place to say that 10% of the market is strategy gamers?

1101
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:13,896
Or 20% are excitement destruction, so we're leaning towards maybe PUBG or CSGO type things.

1102
01:00:14,156 --> 01:00:19,982
Just to kind of, how is the gamer population distributed amongst all these different motivations?

1103
01:00:21,904 --> 01:00:27,915
We've done segmentation studies and we've kind of chopped this before in a variety of ways.

1104
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:34,266
We try not to do like the very broadest.

1105
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:41,764
cuts because we know that, you know, our data is biased towards like a core sample. So that's,

1106
01:00:41,824 --> 01:00:45,026
you know, within that particular space, you know, we can make a cut. And I think at one

1107
01:00:45,046 --> 01:00:50,629
point we did a slide of if you go through the data and you put everyone in the bucket of their

1108
01:00:50,709 --> 01:00:55,371
highest index of motivation, what it comes out to be. I forget what the results were,

1109
01:00:55,411 --> 01:00:58,953
but we have it in one of our previous slides. So we've kind of cut it up that way.

1110
01:00:59,854 --> 01:01:05,541
And I want to say that for men, destruction and excitement buckets came out the highest.

1111
01:01:05,921 --> 01:01:07,263
I forget what the percentages were.

1112
01:01:07,763 --> 01:01:11,348
And so we have some slides of that in our previous talks that we've touched on.

1113
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:13,370
Yeah. Thank you.

1114
01:01:14,873 --> 01:01:15,813
And the very last question.

1115
01:01:16,253 --> 01:01:16,473
Hi.

1116
01:01:17,293 --> 01:01:18,053
Thank you so much.

1117
01:01:18,113 --> 01:01:19,634
This was an inspiring talk.

1118
01:01:19,654 --> 01:01:20,094
Thank you.

1119
01:01:21,354 --> 01:01:26,055
I was curious about, you're doing these surveys on games

1120
01:01:26,495 --> 01:01:29,676
and what people are engaging with, what they prefer doing.

1121
01:01:31,496 --> 01:01:35,337
Have you thought about how this expands beyond games

1122
01:01:35,537 --> 01:01:38,838
to what should people be doing in their careers, et cetera?

1123
01:01:40,653 --> 01:01:41,774
for education, for instance?

1124
01:01:42,794 --> 01:01:48,176
Um, so alongside the gamer, the video gamer profile,

1125
01:01:48,616 --> 01:01:50,917
we actually have a board game profile,

1126
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:54,118
and then we have this infrastructure in place

1127
01:01:54,158 --> 01:01:56,399
to run these surveys and generate these profiles.

1128
01:01:56,839 --> 01:01:57,640
One thing we're chewing on...

1129
01:01:58,667 --> 01:01:59,848
Nick Ducheneau is going to make fun of me.

1130
01:01:59,888 --> 01:02:01,709
I've been saying this for like the past nine months,

1131
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:06,552
is we're working on a broader motivation profile

1132
01:02:06,613 --> 01:02:10,996
that we're broadly thinking of a life aspirations profile.

1133
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,577
So it's somewhere between,

1134
01:02:12,597 --> 01:02:15,799
it's somewhere between a personality profile

1135
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:18,201
and like a values profile.

1136
01:02:18,221 --> 01:02:19,082
So something about,

1137
01:02:19,462 --> 01:02:22,384
I'm someone who desires knowledge and curiosity.

1138
01:02:22,424 --> 01:02:24,266
I'm someone who cares a lot about family.

1139
01:02:24,886 --> 01:02:31,336
and nurturance. So that's something that we're chewing on in the background that we may or may not get to because I've been talking about this for months.

1140
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:35,101
And so we'll run through the same process when we get to it.

1141
01:02:35,121 --> 01:02:40,469
So we'll run the pilot survey, see what clusters together and see if a lot of people want to take this profile.

1142
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:44,013
Because the thing that we're trying to chew on is

1143
01:02:44,413 --> 01:02:46,575
if we can get people to take both gamers,

1144
01:02:46,635 --> 01:02:47,596
who take the gamer profile,

1145
01:02:47,996 --> 01:02:50,078
also take the life aspirations profile,

1146
01:02:50,378 --> 01:02:52,400
then we get these really interesting data sets on,

1147
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:55,262
well, how do gamers want to behave in the broader context?

1148
01:02:55,282 --> 01:02:57,044
Are there interesting relationships there

1149
01:02:57,104 --> 01:02:58,024
that we can suss out?

1150
01:03:00,186 --> 01:03:00,587
Thank you.

1151
01:03:01,007 --> 01:03:02,508
And thanks again, everyone, for coming to the talk.
