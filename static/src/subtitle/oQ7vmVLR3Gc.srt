1
00:00:05,103 --> 00:00:06,403
We're going to go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:06,543 --> 00:00:10,084
Thanks everyone for joining us today for the Storytellers of Esports panel.

3
00:00:12,085 --> 00:00:14,726
I'll go ahead and talk a bit about the panel and then we'll do introductions and we'll

4
00:00:14,746 --> 00:00:15,166
get right to it.

5
00:00:15,606 --> 00:00:20,407
So, the Storytellers of Esports panel is, we're going to talk really quickly about why

6
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:25,489
storytelling is such a critical component of esports alongside having a big prize purse

7
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:26,529
or having a huge stage.

8
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:28,930
So having a lot of awesome players competing in your game.

9
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:32,373
So I'm Tim Young, I'm going to be moderating this panel.

10
00:00:32,453 --> 00:00:34,074
I work at Twitch as a partnerships analyst.

11
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,235
And we'll start with introductions here on the right.

12
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:41,558
So I'm TJ Huckaby, I'm a writer and game designer behind SC2VN, which is the StarCraft

13
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:42,279
2 visual novel.

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,923
My name is Travis Beauchamp, I produce the Smash Brothers, which is a nine-part documentary

15
00:00:48,963 --> 00:00:51,625
miniseries on professional Smash Brothers players.

16
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:53,786
And right now I'm working on a follow-up to that.

17
00:00:54,994 --> 00:00:59,777
My name is also Travis, but Travis Gafford. I am an e-sports journalist. I was with GameSpot

18
00:00:59,797 --> 00:01:05,141
and CBS Interactive recently, but just recently, about a month ago, helped launch Yahoo! e-sports.

19
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,182
So that's my whole thing.

20
00:01:08,263 --> 00:01:13,026
I'm Damian Echada. I do video production for Team Liquid, and we just built out a company

21
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:20,331
called 1UP Studios, which does video production for a range of developers, other companies, etc.

22
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:26,320
I'm Brittany Brown, I'm a community program manager at Twitch, and I've previously worked

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:34,352
with CBS Interactive, Zubu, Red Bull Esports, ESL, various different companies as a host

24
00:01:34,392 --> 00:01:35,594
and on-camera personality.

25
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:39,308
Oh, awesome. Thanks you all. Thanks everyone for joining us today.

26
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:43,373
So, to get this panel started, I'll just go ahead quickly and ask.

27
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,775
So, like, right now there's a huge spotlight on eSports right now.

28
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:50,520
2016, sports stadiums literally packed, you know, with eSports fans.

29
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:57,768
So why do you guys think that storytelling is such a critical component next to having, you know, a huge league or a really big prize pool?

30
00:01:57,788 --> 00:01:58,429
So we'll start with Brittany.

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,365
Yes, so storytelling I would say is probably the top priority that you should be focusing

32
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,787
on as a game developer or even an org owner.

33
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:15,328
within the scene. I think Thresh was a really good example. If you were here previously

34
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:19,672
in the last panel, he talked about how he really catapulted his career off of a story

35
00:02:19,712 --> 00:02:23,215
that was told about him and that's when he really knew he was a pro gamer and became

36
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:28,379
a pro gamer. In general, storytelling is really important just because it's kind of, it's

37
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:34,344
a link to our past, present, future, as well as a connection to humanity.

38
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:40,368
So as we watch stories, or tell stories, and watch stories, or listen to stories, and see

39
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:47,292
stories being published, we therefore feel connection, feel some sort of empathy, or

40
00:02:47,512 --> 00:02:49,973
whatever it is, to that person that's being published.

41
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:53,793
being shown within that story.

42
00:02:54,474 --> 00:03:00,979
Not only that, stories inform, educate, inspire, motivate a list of other things that then

43
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,541
contribute to both change and growth within any scene.

44
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:09,987
And I think for eSports specifically, with so many people coming into it and it being

45
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:13,990
under such a huge spotlight right now, it's really important that you tell those stories

46
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:19,534
effectively so that we preserve the culture that has been made previously in the past.

47
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,455
What was really interesting for me is I actually started off not being a competitive gamer

48
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:29,759
and I played games like Mass Effect and other RPGs.

49
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:36,366
I was not invested in League of Legends, Dota 2, Counter-Strike, none of that, right?

50
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:42,393
Then one of my buddies picked up the Dota 2 beta and we started playing a little bit.

51
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:43,814
I was horrible at the game.

52
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:51,081
But I got really invested because he started telling me about this narrative between Navi and Alliance and like that whole lead up to TI.

53
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:57,927
And it blew my mind because my entire life I had never understood why my family would always get like super excited over...

54
00:03:58,227 --> 00:04:04,413
I'm from California so like the Angels or the Dodgers or the Lakers and they like scream at the TV and jump up out of their chairs.

55
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:07,876
I had like zero clue what any of that meant. I just, I legit thought that they had a problem.

56
00:04:08,437 --> 00:04:12,978
And that they were overly invested in all these Kobe's and whoever's.

57
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:15,619
I was like, I don't get this. It makes zero sense to me.

58
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:22,200
So my pinnacle moment of understanding, at least storytelling in eSports,

59
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,962
was I'm sitting in this Buffalo Wild Wings during TI, I think it was 4.

60
00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:28,142
Dota fans could shoot me if I'm wrong for this.

61
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,223
But it's Na'Vi versus Alliance, and it's the final game,

62
00:04:32,263 --> 00:04:35,584
and the TPs are canceled, and everyone in the bar starts erupting.

63
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:41,828
You know, like, the event ends and, like, I'm just sitting there in this Buffalo Wild Wings

64
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:46,810
realizing, like, I finally get why, like, my grandpa screams at the TV when Kobe misses

65
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,392
a shot or when he makes a shot or when, you know, the Angels do something insane because

66
00:04:51,432 --> 00:04:55,494
it's like you're invested in those players and the organization storylines and, like,

67
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:59,196
the lineage of certain brands and it was a pretty interesting experience and that's kind

68
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:03,398
of how I got started into my eSports career, so to speak.

69
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:08,378
So I actually, sorry Travis, I actually answered the completely wrong question, which will

70
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:08,959
come later on.

71
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,962
But my start in esports was actually from my sister Sam Brown, some of you may be familiar

72
00:05:14,002 --> 00:05:14,262
with her.

73
00:05:14,706 --> 00:05:17,088
She works for Twitch as well as a community program manager.

74
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:27,498
She introduced me to eSports back in 2013, and it was from her college's eSports club.

75
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,542
And she would just be like, this is phenomenal, you should come check it out.

76
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:35,746
And so every weekend I would go and hang out with a bunch of people that were really into

77
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:36,167
eSports.

78
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:43,154
I thought that was really cool and from then on we attended Season 3 Worlds for League

79
00:05:43,174 --> 00:05:47,058
of Legends and that's when I really knew it was something that I wanted to get involved

80
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:47,258
in.

81
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:52,403
I've always been really competitive in traditional sports so when coming into this field I was

82
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:58,349
like completely, I don't know, astounded by the competitive play and how...

83
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,764
these players were, and for me it was all about telling stories like my entire life,

84
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:11,928
so I wanted to go in and really learn about these pro players that were playing at Season

85
00:06:12,128 --> 00:06:16,872
3 Worlds, and I couldn't really find as much information as I wanted, so I thought that

86
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:21,715
it would be really interesting to go and dig myself. I would then reach out to them via

87
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:24,658
Twitter or just through press releases and things like that to...

88
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:29,964
I'm here about their story and then from then on I was like everyone should be hearing about this

89
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:32,827
so I started my own podcast at my local community college, which

90
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:41,678
Actually did really well and that's when Travis came into my life and thought that us working together would be really awesome

91
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:46,190
It was okay. It was ultimately okay. No, it was great.

92
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,971
Yeah, I mean, it's funny, I think, especially with these two, a very similar story for me,

93
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:55,813
where I, you know, kind of got into, was never a traditional sports fan,

94
00:06:56,273 --> 00:07:01,015
got into watching StarCraft II competitively because I really liked the game,

95
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:08,057
but eventually found myself playing way more League of Legends than I did, you know, actually play StarCraft II.

96
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:11,118
And for me, at some point in time, there was a question that was asked of, you know,

97
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:17,820
League eSports had started to become a thing. There wasn't really much going on there, but it was way back in the beginning of this whole thing.

98
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,842
And I asked myself, you know, I'm playing way more League, but I care way more about StarCraft II as an eSport.

99
00:07:25,982 --> 00:07:31,383
Why is that? And the answer came to me that I was actually really deeply invested in the personalities and stories in StarCraft,

100
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,964
but I didn't really know anything about what was happening in League,

101
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:37,965
because at the time there was just not really very much content being made in it.

102
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:43,449
My favorite podcast at the time was one called State of the Game by J.P.

103
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:48,072
McDaniel. Really great podcast that featured different pro players talking

104
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:54,437
about the game, the story lines, the drama oftentimes. Crazy drama. And

105
00:07:55,555 --> 00:08:00,536
For me, I realized maybe there's an opportunity here to create something in League and both

106
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:05,898
educate myself and educate the fans and try to replicate what I loved so much about StarCraft 2.

107
00:08:06,578 --> 00:08:11,519
And so that led to the creation of State of the League, which was just a shameless rip-off

108
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:12,159
of his show.

109
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,401
And that was when I started to realize, you know, actually one of the big goals for me

110
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:24,842
in e-sports from that initial show and still to this day is I really want to provide a

111
00:08:26,283 --> 00:08:35,449
People who care about League or are interested in eSport, the opportunity to become a fan of a player or to hate a player even, right?

112
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:42,014
That's, I think, for me, what people are, what gets them into the eSport.

113
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:47,938
Seeing those big moments of somebody, you know, break down on stage or hearing some crazy story about a player.

114
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:51,620
And so that's what drives me forward today is telling these stories.

115
00:08:54,808 --> 00:09:01,073
I mean, I agree that having a league and having a huge prize pool kind of brings legitimacy,

116
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:07,017
but people really get excited about the stories of the players and the teams.

117
00:09:07,657 --> 00:09:09,239
It's like Brady versus Manning.

118
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,402
For me growing up in the Bay Area, it was the 49ers and the Cowboys.

119
00:09:14,543 --> 00:09:15,824
That kind of got you excited.

120
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:17,805
And I think it's true for eSports as well.

121
00:09:17,865 --> 00:09:23,169
If you take those players and team stories out of either sports or eSports, you're just

122
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:23,810
left with the game.

123
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:26,109
And the game is interesting.

124
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,510
Games can be, you know, but it's ones and zeros.

125
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,770
It's like the ball and bat.

126
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:35,993
The real interesting stuff is the people playing the game expressing themselves through the

127
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,154
game that creates story lines and that drives interest.

128
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,847
Like I said, working on a follow-up to the Smash Bros. project.

129
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:45,468
And, uh, you know, one of the protagonists is Mango.

130
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:46,668
And he's a...

131
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:50,589
He's by far probably the most popular, most well-known Smasher.

132
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:55,551
And, uh, the way he plays the game is so instinctual in the moment.

133
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:56,971
It's a very unique play style.

134
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,432
And I was interviewing a local...

135
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:06,357
And he was talking about Mango saying that it almost didn't matter that it was playing

136
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:06,758
Melee.

137
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:08,179
It could have been anything.

138
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:11,922
It's just for Mango, the way he would talk about it is like, oh, he was a buster.

139
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:14,604
Or I got in his head and I wrecked him.

140
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:17,987
And I think that kind of gets to the heart of it.

141
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:20,909
It's about player-to-player interactions.

142
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:24,552
That's the interesting part of sports and e-sports.

143
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:28,275
So if you ignore that, I think it's really to your detriment.

144
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:35,124
I think if you were to take even the top level StarCraft II tournament or whatever that you

145
00:10:35,144 --> 00:10:38,505
stream and would normally have 50,000 views, if you were to take away the casters, if you

146
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:42,927
were to take away the player name plates and just show this high level game, you probably

147
00:10:42,947 --> 00:10:44,247
wouldn't get nearly as many views.

148
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:50,510
It's really when you have these two forces, Huck and Idra, the bad boy and the pretty

149
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,611
boy that's always smiling, making hearts on the map.

150
00:10:52,971 --> 00:10:58,493
That's sort of what is driving this fan support, not necessarily the high, high top level play.

151
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:05,140
It certainly helps, it augments that story line, but it's really who these two people

152
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,385
are because you're going to be pulling way more interest because people are interested

153
00:11:09,405 --> 00:11:13,309
in these two people specifically, not just who's doing the best at any given game.

154
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:15,457
Yeah, great answers guys.

155
00:11:15,977 --> 00:11:17,878
So a common theme I kind of saw across

156
00:11:17,898 --> 00:11:20,018
what you guys were talking about is like

157
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:21,899
storytelling was a way that you were introduced

158
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:23,059
to your specific communities.

159
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,140
So maybe Travis, can you speak more about like

160
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,940
what has your experience been about

161
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,281
drawing new players into a specific community

162
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:32,741
you were putting a spotlight on?

163
00:11:33,842 --> 00:11:37,583
Sure, I mean, you know, for me I feel like

164
00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:39,723
you know, the

165
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:44,654
I myself got drawn into Melee haphazardly.

166
00:11:44,674 --> 00:11:47,255
I was living with my brother at the time.

167
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:49,777
I had played 64. That was my game.

168
00:11:49,797 --> 00:11:52,798
I went to college, played 64, and wrecked everyone.

169
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:57,481
My brother got a GameCube while I was away at college, and he played Melee.

170
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,163
So when we started living together, that was the only game we had,

171
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:02,504
and he just destroyed me at it, consistently.

172
00:12:03,595 --> 00:12:08,739
One slightly inebriated night I was very frustrated and he showed me like you know these videos

173
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,662
and stuff of these pro players and that kind of sparked me to really you know get excited

174
00:12:13,722 --> 00:12:20,066
about it and I wanted to kind of share that feeling of seeing this game and you know it's

175
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:25,490
yes it's ones and zeros and it's this very clean sort of universe it's very separate

176
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,552
from like a dirty field of like you know when you're playing football or whatever but

177
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:33,694
When you see these guys play at a top level, it doesn't feel that way.

178
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:38,797
It feels like they can bend the rules a little bit and just sort of make it their own.

179
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:41,358
It's like they're, of course, talking about Mango.

180
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:45,360
It's like a Neo going into Matrix and making it their own.

181
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,462
In that sense, it's almost more human in some way than sports.

182
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,170
But, and that's kind of what I wanted to share

183
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,452
and bring people into with the Smash Brothers.

184
00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:01,353
Kind of explain that aspect of it,

185
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:03,533
but with the stories of these people

186
00:13:03,653 --> 00:13:05,554
and kind of bring them into that.

187
00:13:05,594 --> 00:13:06,234
Yeah, awesome.

188
00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:07,715
I mean, you touched on it just a little bit,

189
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:09,455
but like the comparison to traditional sports,

190
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:11,276
and I think Damian talked about it too,

191
00:13:11,336 --> 00:13:13,177
is like there are storylines in traditional sports,

192
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:15,057
but both of you guys seem to feel like

193
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:16,918
there's something a bit different about eSports

194
00:13:17,178 --> 00:13:18,639
compared to traditional sports storytelling.

195
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,239
So, Travis, do you think you can lead us

196
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,060
into that discussion?

197
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:25,874
Yeah, I mean, it's really interesting for me. I find myself maybe confronting this more

198
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:30,359
than I ever have before because, you know, for those that don't know, Yahoo! Esports

199
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:35,745
is now under Yahoo! Sports. It's an initiative of that, right? Whereas before I was working

200
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:39,890
at GameSpot and we were coming at it from the game coverage angle.

201
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:48,198
Some of the people that I'm working with now are executive producers who have produced, you know, Olympics coverage and traditional sports coverage for a long time.

202
00:13:48,738 --> 00:13:54,383
And so the kind of conversations that we're having are questions around, like, where are the differences?

203
00:13:54,463 --> 00:13:59,207
What do we focus on? What can we learn from on the traditional sports side compared to esports?

204
00:13:59,748 --> 00:14:03,431
And one of the things that I've quickly kind of realized, you know, I've known it for a while,

205
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:06,674
but I think putting it in this context has helped me think about it more, is that...

206
00:14:08,618 --> 00:14:12,981
And hopefully I don't get slaughtered by traditional sports fans for saying this, but I feel like

207
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:18,466
eSports, maybe more than traditional sports, is so much about the personalities and about

208
00:14:18,486 --> 00:14:18,886
the stories.

209
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:22,349
I think there's a lot of different reasons for that, but one of it is just that

210
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:30,691
It kind of came out of this grass roots thing where there's no kind of like filter, you

211
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:35,493
know, these guys are not, they don't always have a ton of press training and even beyond

212
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:39,054
that, you know, this all came up after the rise of social media.

213
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:40,235
So you have

214
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:45,034
A ton of stuff that's happening where players immediately after the game are putting their

215
00:14:45,054 --> 00:14:52,262
opinions out on that on Twitter or Facebook. Even, you know, just a personal thing that

216
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:53,644
happened yesterday was a ‑‑

217
00:14:56,613 --> 00:15:00,556
I guess it was two days ago. Doublelift, who is a friend of mine and also one of the most

218
00:15:00,596 --> 00:15:06,200
prominent players in League, lost in a very, very embarrassing fashion to one of the worst

219
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,863
teams and he immediately unfollowed everyone that he followed on Twitter and only followed

220
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:16,567
his teammates and sort of made this like statement. And it's one of those things where it's not

221
00:15:16,607 --> 00:15:20,470
something that was said in an interview, but it very clearly tells the story of where he's

222
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,171
at right now with the team.

223
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:26,341
And I think there's just so many of these opportunities where

224
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:30,217
You know, we have discussions about how much should we focus

225
00:15:30,558 --> 00:15:34,241
on a match highlight versus how much should we put video

226
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:38,324
resources into doing a feature or something about a player.

227
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:43,328
And again, I think maybe in traditional sports, a

228
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:44,849
highlight goes crazy.

229
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:47,951
Whereas in e-sports, there's so much draw for that post-game

230
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:48,391
interview.

231
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:50,373
I'm obviously very biased because that's what I do.

232
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:53,255
But I think it's just one of the big differences.

233
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:59,872
I think another big difference is what we talked about at least in the last panel was

234
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:05,575
how different games can kind of come and go within eSports as we've seen with StarCraft

235
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:12,538
2, StarCraft and everything, but I think that storytelling really allows those professional

236
00:16:12,558 --> 00:16:16,260
players to create their brand and to go on social media and be able to do things like

237
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,401
Doublelift has done.

238
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:22,864
and for people to become fans of them and then therefore then go on to future careers

239
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:28,347
within the scene and not just go into whatever game that they're going to be playing as a

240
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:31,769
professional player blindsided by what's going to happen next.

241
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:37,072
Storytelling is really a foundation for them to be able to figure out at least the time

242
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:43,215
that they're being a pro player what the next step is for them and to use storytellers

243
00:16:43,315 --> 00:16:46,617
as a way to be able to build their brand and to be able to have a future within the scene.

244
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:55,266
So TJ, you actually have a really interesting contrast to everyone else on the panel, kind

245
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:56,307
of focused on video content.

246
00:16:56,327 --> 00:17:00,190
You actually shipped a game about eSports, Starcraft 2 visual novel.

247
00:17:01,531 --> 00:17:06,174
So when you're drafting a story, more or less even a fictional story, what are the compelling

248
00:17:06,214 --> 00:17:09,077
elements are you looking for to talk about this community you're covering?

249
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:13,918
Right, right, because I chose to write about eSports, you know, I'm not like having to just follow players from day to day.

250
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:17,459
So it's like, what, what, why did I come to eSports and what was it so compelling about it?

251
00:17:17,499 --> 00:17:21,040
And to me, you know, if you're going to tell any story, no matter what kind of story it is,

252
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,921
it has to have some sort of human element.

253
00:17:22,981 --> 00:17:27,502
And so a lot of the times that you see in eSports is like these teenagers or 20 somethings, you know,

254
00:17:27,962 --> 00:17:31,524
they are devoting a huge amount of time and effort and passion to this game.

255
00:17:31,544 --> 00:17:33,304
They're sacrificing a whole lot.

256
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,765
And for what?

257
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:36,985
And for a lot of the time, it's for nothing.

258
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:42,386
And that story right there of someone chasing everything and going after it and really not

259
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:46,767
ending up with anything in the end, there's a story there. And I like to tell that story. I

260
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:51,669
think that a lot of the time what we see focused in eSports storytelling is the story of the

261
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:56,410
champion's rise and how he made it. But I think something equally beautiful is the guy who is

262
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,831
just playing these online tournaments day in and day out and he finally wins one. He's been up

263
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:05,552
all night and he takes that $100 that he just won and he buys the first steak dinner he's had

264
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:07,212
in three months. I think that

265
00:18:07,973 --> 00:18:13,360
As long as there is some sort of human element there that eSports provides a rich landscape

266
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,542
to tell whatever sort of story you want.

267
00:18:14,562 --> 00:18:16,424
I think Travis especially does that really well.

268
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:18,167
Me Travis?

269
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:18,487
Yes.

270
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,370
Awesome.

271
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:20,870
Thanks a lot.

272
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,501
You touched on it just a little bit, but it's about, you know, you're working, and Travis

273
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,082
you talked about it too, you're working with people who don't have a lot of press training,

274
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:32,444
who are like teenagers or 20-somethings, and they can be hard to work with sometimes, or

275
00:18:32,464 --> 00:18:34,944
maybe they're really quiet, you know, their personalities, they play games all day, and

276
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:38,706
they won't, you know, they're not very extroverted, so I think we talked about it a bit at dinner

277
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:42,067
last night, like how do you get sometimes these guys to open up, or like, you know,

278
00:18:42,107 --> 00:18:43,987
to tell their story of how they got where they are?

279
00:18:46,722 --> 00:18:49,604
Well, you know, it's funny. I actually, I was thinking about this as we were talking.

280
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:55,368
I feel like, you know, the difference between sports and eSports, you have this tradition.

281
00:18:55,388 --> 00:18:57,969
You know, eSports is just organized video gaming, really.

282
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:02,673
And video games have historically been this, you know, pastime of...

283
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:07,515
that dispossess, you know, the geeks and the nerds and the weaklings and stuff, you know,

284
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:11,417
people who are, you know, not in the mainstream.

285
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:13,978
It's always kind of been, like, looked down upon.

286
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:18,599
So that's kind of slowly changing, but I feel like that, because of that history and because

287
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:23,221
it's still a little bit true, you have these storylines that might be more internal, more

288
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:24,201
emotionally driven.

289
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:28,923
And like you say, more, you know, more people are kind of, like, withdrawn or can be withdrawn.

290
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:38,216
I had a great interview with a guy, I think it was the best episode out of all nine episodes I did, Isaiah.

291
00:19:38,256 --> 00:19:46,743
He's this really shy guy who's just incredible, has this amazingly fast, aggressive Captain Falcon that he plays.

292
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:51,187
And he refused to get on camera because he was very camera shy.

293
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:57,253
So I kind of said, okay, what if we just sit down with an audio recorder?

294
00:19:57,777 --> 00:20:00,498
And I'll go take you to lunch and we'll just talk.

295
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:03,919
And so we sat there and talked for hours.

296
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:05,099
We found that it was at Apex 2012,

297
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,881
this big tournament, and it's very loud.

298
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:11,362
So we went up to this, found this perfect little quiet room

299
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:14,143
and we just sat there and had the recorder

300
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:15,523
and we just talked for hours.

301
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:19,425
And from that, I got, he just opened up

302
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:22,726
and was able to really kind of talk about issues

303
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:25,027
with his self-confidence and things that.

304
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:29,630
He definitely would not have said on camera if I'd forced him into this position he was

305
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,311
uncomfortable with.

306
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:38,401
So I think you have to respect these players, you have to respect their individuality, and

307
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:42,086
sometimes you don't get people to talk at all, but that's how it goes.

308
00:20:42,106 --> 00:20:44,088
I think you just have to be open to...

309
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:45,897
Telling stories differently.

310
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:46,818
However you can.

311
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:49,982
Yeah, I mean that's really interesting because you actually kind of got him into his natural

312
00:20:50,022 --> 00:20:50,323
element.

313
00:20:50,743 --> 00:20:53,907
But it's interesting, everyone on this side of the table works with players who are thrust

314
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:55,189
into the spotlight more or less.

315
00:20:55,229 --> 00:20:59,875
So maybe in your case, if you're doing a post-game interview, and someone's not really opening

316
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:03,359
up, how do you kind of get them to tell their story or do you kind of carry that weight

317
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:03,900
on for them?

318
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:06,683
I'm happy you asked that, Tim, because I was about to answer that.

319
00:21:07,904 --> 00:21:11,447
You're already a better panel host than Nick Allen, my friend, who hosted the last one.

320
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:14,669
So we're off to a great start.

321
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:22,175
It's fun for me. I benefit a lot from the fact that I get to interview these guys every weekend.

322
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:28,680
And, you know, obviously I don't interview the same guy every weekend, but with the format for League structure,

323
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,244
I predominantly cover League of Legends, I'm at the studio every single weekend doing interviews with the teams.

324
00:21:34,164 --> 00:21:38,609
And one of the benefits of that is that over time I have the

325
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:42,093
opportunity to start forging these personal relationships. So

326
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:45,016
you'll have oftentimes a new rookie that will come in. They

327
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:47,439
have never done an interview. And it's funny because you might

328
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:49,541
see them interacting with their teammates and they might seem

329
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:52,945
really energetic or whatever. And then of course whenever you

330
00:21:52,965 --> 00:21:55,567
put them in front of a camera they start to feel really

331
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:55,888
nervous.

332
00:21:57,109 --> 00:22:03,531
I'll sometimes get criticism for my interviews being too

333
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:06,992
casual or too silly and oftentimes that's because, you

334
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:11,634
know, especially when it's with a new guy, I'm fine opting for

335
00:22:11,694 --> 00:22:15,356
the kind of like let's just joke around about how your teammates

336
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:19,972
So I'm going to try to snore too loud or something like that for a little bit to get whoever it

337
00:22:19,992 --> 00:22:24,656
is I'm talking to really comfortable. Because that means that, you know, at the end of the

338
00:22:24,696 --> 00:22:29,379
season potentially if they win, they're going to be much more open and candid about sort

339
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:34,684
of their path than, you know, if I hadn't really talked to them or if they're so set

340
00:22:34,724 --> 00:22:38,627
with this idea of like I only give like the professional PR answer, like, yeah, we're

341
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:42,009
just going to try really hard. We tried really hard. Our effort was really … ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??

342
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:47,833
you know, there today. I think just sort of forging those relationships and really allowing

343
00:22:47,873 --> 00:22:51,576
the players to feel like, you know, they're able to showcase their personality, they're

344
00:22:51,616 --> 00:22:57,139
able to show who they are. That's sort of how you get sometimes that really golden moment.

345
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,000
Yeah.

346
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,682
Yeah, I think Damian and I worked a lot on both

347
00:23:02,444 --> 00:23:07,710
me doing interviews just like Travis, as well as behind the scenes documentary style pieces.

348
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:12,616
And a lot of the time we made sure to take the time that we were creating the best story

349
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:17,721
as possible, not just the story that we saw from the outside, but stories that we have

350
00:23:17,761 --> 00:23:19,724
learned from just getting to know the players themselves.

351
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:20,885
So we would spend time with them.

352
00:23:21,806 --> 00:23:26,688
If we can, or just have them become comfortable with us before we even went in and tried to touch the story,

353
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:30,030
I think making sure that you have the right message,

354
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:36,313
and knowing the person personally, or the subject that you are trying to tell a story about,

355
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:42,096
is going to be way more effective than just going in and telling a story about a pro player that you know is very good at the game.

356
00:23:42,816 --> 00:23:49,040
It's important to really get to know them prior, so that you can show the audience what you see is so special about them.

357
00:23:51,153 --> 00:23:55,574
Yeah, so when we're looking at the landscape of eSports right now, there's a ton of different

358
00:23:55,594 --> 00:23:56,014
games, right?

359
00:23:56,034 --> 00:24:03,117
So like Dota League, Starcraft, Hearthstone, Rocket League, it's going to be crazy.

360
00:24:03,157 --> 00:24:07,138
So these games span across a ton of different designs, and you're not going to know how

361
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:08,698
to play every single game.

362
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:15,380
So Damien, you've worked across a multitude of games, how do you take the story that comes

363
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,182
from a variety of backgrounds and makes it palatable for everyone to enjoy?

364
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:23,129
So for me, I do a majority of documentary work.

365
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:30,374
So I try to find a touchpoint with a player that I can relate to, and then maybe if it's

366
00:24:30,394 --> 00:24:33,877
not something that I can directly relate to, something that I have a friend that's very

367
00:24:33,937 --> 00:24:34,837
similar as.

368
00:24:35,198 --> 00:24:40,982
But finding the human element in someone is probably the most important part, and figuring

369
00:24:41,142 --> 00:24:42,143
out how to...

370
00:24:43,103 --> 00:24:48,005
Talk to the player about their gameplay as well as what makes them tick.

371
00:24:48,085 --> 00:24:56,189
So, for example, for me, when I started doing the series on Team Liquid last year, we had a player, Phoenix, who no one knew who he was, really.

372
00:24:56,289 --> 00:25:01,451
He had played top lane in Korea, but did a horrible job, got brought to America, had little play.

373
00:25:03,031 --> 00:25:05,612
And we had to replace one of our star players with him.

374
00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:08,553
So it was like fighting the community against this,

375
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:09,934
like, who is this guy, get rid of him,

376
00:25:09,974 --> 00:25:10,974
bring back your old guy.

377
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:14,376
Like, the community was already just disposed to dislike him.

378
00:25:15,316 --> 00:25:17,117
And especially adding the fact that he was Korean

379
00:25:17,157 --> 00:25:18,238
and didn't know a lot of English,

380
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:21,759
I had to figure out how to get a North American audience

381
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:23,400
to care about a kid from Korea

382
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,220
that everyone from Korea said was bad,

383
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:27,361
and no one in America wanted him to be there.

384
00:25:28,456 --> 00:25:34,280
So I spent a lot of time with him and with our manager, just

385
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,062
kind of like trying to figure out who he was. The day that we

386
00:25:37,082 --> 00:25:41,284
picked him up, I actually, his previous name was Miso and we

387
00:25:41,305 --> 00:25:43,586
were going over names and I was the one that named him Phoenix.

388
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:47,429
So that was just kind of a random interesting point where

389
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:50,150
me and him kind of built a relationship off of that. So

390
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,913
like I'd always go out to eat with him and any time that they

391
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:56,294
would do like an activity I would make sure to kind of be

392
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:56,474
there.

393
00:25:57,495 --> 00:26:00,977
And obviously from a documentary standpoint, that's something that I was able to do.

394
00:26:01,077 --> 00:26:06,061
Maybe not everyone's able to do that, but to like what Brittany and Travis said, building

395
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:10,503
the personal relationship with the player and getting them comfortable with you is probably

396
00:26:11,084 --> 00:26:13,185
one of the most important things when telling their story.

397
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:18,135
So, you know, when you guys are crafting your stories and, you know, you're coming from

398
00:26:18,155 --> 00:26:22,796
a very complex game that, like, a lot of mechanics, a lot of strategy behind it, how do you guys

399
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:24,936
decide, like, what parts to leave out?

400
00:26:25,036 --> 00:26:30,018
Like, especially in Super Smash Melee, it's just insane amount, like, textbooks and textbooks

401
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:33,198
amount of knowledge you have to know to understand, you know, what's the best game.

402
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:37,919
So how do you kind of decide what gameplay or knowledge to leave in and what story elements,

403
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,220
you know, to keep out?

404
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:45,837
When I started approaching the project, I sort of did it with the assumption that

405
00:26:46,698 --> 00:26:51,863
if a potential audience member didn't have at least a little bit of love for games,

406
00:26:53,024 --> 00:26:54,305
that I wasn't going to care about them.

407
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:56,487
If they didn't have that base level of...

408
00:26:56,988 --> 00:27:00,991
If they had any respect for games or interest in gaming, then they could essentially fuck off.

409
00:27:01,511 --> 00:27:07,435
But I've realized, in retrospect, that's probably a short-sighted kind of perspective,

410
00:27:07,515 --> 00:27:12,238
because King of Kong, one of the most successful gaming documentaries of all time,

411
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:17,302
and I think still the best, had hardly any specifics for gameplay.

412
00:27:17,342 --> 00:27:21,905
It had maybe five minutes worth of screen time devoted to the actual game mechanics,

413
00:27:22,245 --> 00:27:23,286
and the rest was just these...

414
00:27:23,987 --> 00:27:27,469
players and their emotional journeys and their interactions and stuff.

415
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:33,952
So I think for the most part, you can sort of just leave out the specifics for the gameplay

416
00:27:33,992 --> 00:27:39,436
and concentrate on what victories and defeat mean for these emotional stories.

417
00:27:40,248 --> 00:27:42,808
Like, Rudy is a football movie.

418
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:43,569
Sort of.

419
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:50,090
It's, you know, Rudy plays actual football for like one tackle at the end of the movie

420
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:50,890
and that's it.

421
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,451
And the rest is just, you know, those emotional kind of progressions.

422
00:27:54,491 --> 00:27:59,052
So I think you can, I don't want to say you should leave it out entirely, but if your

423
00:27:59,092 --> 00:28:03,493
goal is the widest audience possible, then I think gameplay always kind of has to take

424
00:28:03,513 --> 00:28:03,993
a back seat.

425
00:28:05,163 --> 00:28:07,665
I mean, you should try to always have a universal story.

426
00:28:07,705 --> 00:28:12,048
Like, someone that doesn't know anything about the game, if they watch your interview or

427
00:28:12,068 --> 00:28:15,190
you're part of your documentary, they can walk away with something that they understood.

428
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:21,354
But I would say that don't bury what you're doing in jargon, but you don't ‑‑ at the

429
00:28:21,374 --> 00:28:25,056
same token, I don't agree that you should have none, because it provides some really

430
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:28,619
nice flavor and authenticity to what you're telling about.

431
00:28:29,593 --> 00:28:33,674
Yeah, and a lot of the times, like, the players' personalities are, like, interwoven with the

432
00:28:33,694 --> 00:28:34,175
gameplay.

433
00:28:34,195 --> 00:28:35,615
And, like, that's what you did in the game, right?

434
00:28:35,935 --> 00:28:36,155
Right.

435
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:41,636
So, what you wanted, well, what I did specifically, at least, was that if you have a character

436
00:28:41,656 --> 00:28:44,657
who's pretty hot-headed or whatever, they might play, like, a hot-headed style.

437
00:28:44,677 --> 00:28:47,678
Or if you have someone that's pretty laid back, you know, they play very passive.

438
00:28:47,738 --> 00:28:52,499
And games are, you know, you can sort of sometimes see that, like, in boxing, Manny Pacquiao or

439
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:56,720
whatever, versus Floyd Mayweather, people would say that, you know, Floyd played lame.

440
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,260
But...

441
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,325
In games it lets you really, you can really get into that because there's so many, at

442
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,428
least in most games, have so many ways for players to express themselves.

443
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:08,572
And I think that the best e-sports, the ones that are most watchable, have lots of ways

444
00:29:08,592 --> 00:29:09,733
for players to express themselves.

445
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:18,261
The danger is, of course, it's a little abstract.

446
00:29:18,302 --> 00:29:20,964
Like you have, let's say there's a theoretical movie,

447
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:24,388
like an e-sports movie, and it's double lift

448
00:29:24,428 --> 00:29:26,130
at the end of the movie, like pulling off

449
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:30,534
this amazing pentakill, and CLG wins the day or whatever.

450
00:29:30,574 --> 00:29:33,837
And it's climactic, and everybody's happy and stuff.

451
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:36,400
But the act itself is sort of abstract.

452
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,601
He's sitting there at a computer.

453
00:29:38,082 --> 00:29:42,168
And then over here on a screen this character does these things and kills these other characters

454
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:42,608
and they win.

455
00:29:42,628 --> 00:29:48,236
And I think because of that, because in contrast to regular sports which is just played with

456
00:29:48,276 --> 00:29:53,083
a human body which everyone has and can understand, you know, you as a content creator have to

457
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:53,363
kind of...

458
00:29:54,613 --> 00:29:58,998
explain and synthesize all those things that are really cool about the game so that we

459
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,563
as an audience can feel like, you know, we just saw an amazing catch by Jerry Rice when

460
00:30:03,643 --> 00:30:05,165
Doublelift pulls off this pentakill.

461
00:30:05,185 --> 00:30:09,890
We have to be taught ahead of time a little bit why a pentakill is beautiful, just like

462
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:10,671
an athletic act.

463
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:16,313
Yeah. So obviously all you guys have worked across a lot of, you know, really, you know,

464
00:30:16,353 --> 00:30:21,715
professional players, really popular players. But for anyone who's like trying to get into

465
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:25,837
the space as either like a developer or even a storyteller, you know, the landscape of esports

466
00:30:25,877 --> 00:30:29,479
has changed, you know, dramatically in probably the span that all of you guys have been working.

467
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:34,061
You know, how do you guys still find access to players? I mean, you guys, you know, go to LCS

468
00:30:34,101 --> 00:30:37,543
every weekend, but do you have any advice for people who are just looking to, you know, start

469
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:40,704
this on their own or like start interviewing on their own or telling stories on their own?

470
00:30:42,113 --> 00:30:49,997
Yeah, it's really hard. As the scene evolves, it gets more difficult to get access to the pros.

471
00:30:51,618 --> 00:30:55,080
I mentioned earlier that I did a show called State of the League where I

472
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,961
had three or four different pros on every week.

473
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:02,767
That show I can't do anymore because these guys are just so busy, even more so than in

474
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:08,153
traditional sports, e-sports athletes are spending a tremendous amount of time practicing,

475
00:31:08,273 --> 00:31:15,761
competing, fulfilling sponsor obligations, you know, trying out their new coaches, strange

476
00:31:17,082 --> 00:31:17,482
athletic.

477
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:24,112
a training program, who knows, right? And so it can be very difficult. I think that,

478
00:31:24,352 --> 00:31:29,974
you know, it depends on what you're really looking to do. If you just want to start telling

479
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:36,857
eSports stories, there's some amazing games that are coming up right now, and those don't

480
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:38,257
have any stories being told yet.

481
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:44,862
And you could be a part in creating the rise of this next big title.

482
00:31:45,223 --> 00:31:47,665
And that can be as simple as just going up to a tournament.

483
00:31:47,685 --> 00:31:50,247
And what I used to do is just stand next to the stage,

484
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:52,749
and whenever the team was done, they'd win or lose,

485
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:54,550
and you'd just ask a player, do you want to do an interview?

486
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,873
Sometimes they'll say no, sometimes they'll say yes, and that's an opportunity.

487
00:31:59,761 --> 00:32:05,725
I think as you look at some of the bigger e-sports publishers and tournament organizers

488
00:32:05,765 --> 00:32:14,132
are starting to really understand what ‑‑ how important it is to have documentary crews,

489
00:32:14,312 --> 00:32:18,375
media, press cover their stuff. Because, again, as you look at the stuff as

490
00:32:18,415 --> 00:32:20,717
a sport, the analogies are there, right?

491
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,742
There's a reason why traditional sports media exists and why

492
00:32:24,782 --> 00:32:28,745
these guys have been creating stuff. So I think shout out to

493
00:32:28,845 --> 00:32:31,807
Nicola who is in the audience right now from Riot PR. She does

494
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:34,749
a really good job of not only accommodating the folks that

495
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:36,850
have been in the scene like myself for a really long time

496
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:41,173
but also, you know, we have people at the LCS every weekend

497
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:45,116
that are brand new faces that are coming in as part of like

498
00:32:45,136 --> 00:32:47,898
the teams that are trying to learn how to do this stuff and

499
00:32:47,938 --> 00:32:49,719
get better at doing interviews.

500
00:32:50,645 --> 00:32:56,431
And so I think that there are opportunities in both areas and you just kind of need to figure out what approach you're going to take.

501
00:32:57,311 --> 00:33:06,960
One of the most interesting things that I noticed over this last, I'd say, two years is last year I was a full-time content creator with Team Liquid and then TSM also had a guy.

502
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:13,225
And now, I don't know, maybe half the teams, right? Something around that, now have in-house content creators.

503
00:33:13,286 --> 00:33:15,588
Maybe they're part-times, some of them are full-time.

504
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:21,773
It seems like a lot of organizations are picking up in-house content creators and a lot of

505
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:24,495
those people are just found by, they create content.

506
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:30,460
Maybe you want to do documentary pieces but the only stuff that you have access to is

507
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,123
in-game footage and maybe some of Travis's interviews, right?

508
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:38,306
But you could still build the narrative about Doublelift with some highlight videos plus

509
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:43,851
some interwoven Travis things and climb the ranks on Reddit and then all of a sudden Team

510
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:46,133
Liquid's asking you to come and be their intern for the summer.

511
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:53,809
So I think there's a ton of opportunity in entering the scene, you just have to actually

512
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:54,510
do stuff, right?

513
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,815
Because I could sit here and talk to you all day about all this content that I want to

514
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,817
make, but if I don't have anything, there's nothing to look at.

515
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:06,920
So once you finally grab the players, I think a good job that all you guys do is keeping

516
00:34:07,081 --> 00:34:09,002
the story really authentic.

517
00:34:09,322 --> 00:34:12,485
Like when people watch, say, the Smash Bros. documentary, it's like, oh my god, I really

518
00:34:12,525 --> 00:34:14,406
understand the Smash community now.

519
00:34:14,426 --> 00:34:19,230
Or when people watch any of your pieces on League or Smash, it's like, oh my god, I really

520
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,852
kind of understand these players and this team.

521
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:23,394
And it's interesting to me because both of you guys...

522
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:27,975
So, you know, not too long ago we were non-eSports fans and now you're really capturing the essence

523
00:34:27,995 --> 00:34:29,016
of these teams and these players.

524
00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:31,697
How do you guys kind of keep that authenticity?

525
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:38,739
For me, kind of just driving back to what I said earlier, it's really identifying with

526
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:39,139
the players.

527
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,240
So I come from more of a player side or an organization side.

528
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,301
So one of the things that we did with our first season of the series Rebirth that I

529
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:49,322
made is we were just really honest about everything that was happening.

530
00:34:49,623 --> 00:34:53,684
So we'd gotten a player from Korea, Piglet, who was like, you know, some people consider

531
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:53,944
maybe...

532
00:34:54,747 --> 00:34:54,847
a

533
00:34:54,907 --> 00:34:58,729
reason why he was benched. Like, people knew that he had, you know, a difficult attitude

534
00:34:58,749 --> 00:35:01,530
to work with and that we were working with him to get him to a better place so we could

535
00:35:19,316 --> 00:35:22,239
We cooperated with the team better to where we could understand one another.

536
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,243
And I think we were pretty honest about that whole process in our show.

537
00:35:27,264 --> 00:35:31,628
And that was, I think, a bi-weekly at that time sort of series that we did.

538
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:36,392
So for me, keeping the authenticity was not trying to sweep anything under the rug as

539
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:41,898
an organization, but just being very forward with the players' best intentions at heart.

540
00:35:44,135 --> 00:35:49,517
I definitely have the same strategy as both Damian and Travis when I'm going into, let's

541
00:35:49,537 --> 00:35:53,698
say, an interview, an on-camera interview, or an on-stage hosting type interview.

542
00:35:54,758 --> 00:35:58,620
I definitely want to make sure to sprinkle in those little elements that this is maybe

543
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,842
a 16-year-old who is going through some rough patches back at home, and that could have

544
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:05,302
translated then into his gameplay.

545
00:36:05,722 --> 00:36:10,564
I think things like that are really important to notice and acknowledge within both either

546
00:36:10,584 --> 00:36:16,385
an interview or a documentary style piece because that just then again adds the human

547
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:20,927
element and allows people to be able to relate to that person rather than just kind of kicking

548
00:36:20,947 --> 00:36:25,928
them while they're down because of a loss and just a fan being upset because their favorite

549
00:36:25,948 --> 00:36:28,129
pro player couldn't play up to par that day.

550
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:32,650
So I think sprinkling in those little human elements are very important.

551
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,560
Cool.

552
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,122
So, for this next question, it's actually really interesting we grouped you two guys

553
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:42,524
together because I want to talk about how developers can empower the content creators

554
00:36:42,604 --> 00:36:44,185
to tell their stories.

555
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:47,907
And I think both of you guys have a really interesting perspective on both ends of the

556
00:36:47,927 --> 00:36:48,787
spectrum, right?

557
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:49,487
Yeah.

558
00:36:49,547 --> 00:36:53,649
So, I finished SC2VN and I was like, I want to put this on Steam.

559
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:58,334
Oh, it's Starcraft, like actual property with some of their actual music on it.

560
00:36:58,595 --> 00:36:59,556
What's it going to take to do that?

561
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:03,320
And I think that three years ago, there's no chance that Blizzard would have done this.

562
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,301
It's way too risky.

563
00:37:04,341 --> 00:37:06,984
It's crazy to let some fan project on Steam with your IP.

564
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:08,365
But you know, they heard us out.

565
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:10,527
They vetted the project, and they were like, okay, you can do this.

566
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:16,051
So I think that just goes to show how they understand how important it is to be empowering

567
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:19,973
your people who are telling stories about your players who are showing that StarCraft

568
00:37:20,093 --> 00:37:20,694
isn't just a game.

569
00:37:20,714 --> 00:37:21,954
It's actually way more than that.

570
00:37:22,014 --> 00:37:25,396
It's like a sport in South Korea and has been for 15 years.

571
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,438
It's like a force of nature.

572
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,319
It's not just some game that kids play.

573
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:34,582
And the more people that understand that, the more staying power that StarCraft has.

574
00:37:34,882 --> 00:37:37,624
Slightly different for you, I'd say.

575
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:38,844
Yeah, Nintendo.

576
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:48,407
They're a hard nut to crack. I feel like for the most part, I mean, you do have to do this

577
00:37:48,447 --> 00:37:55,828
little dance around with them. It's kind of well known how they approach content on YouTube,

578
00:37:55,908 --> 00:38:01,689
specifically speed runs and stuff like that. And that's ‑‑ it's something that was

579
00:38:01,709 --> 00:38:08,650
always in the back of my mind. For the time being, I mean, I have so far had no contact

580
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,350
from Nintendo.

581
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:11,251
And that's fine.

582
00:38:11,871 --> 00:38:15,932
I'd be happy if they just never, you know, kind of had to step in and say anything.

583
00:38:17,332 --> 00:38:20,613
I would like to see a point where they evolve a little bit as a company

584
00:38:20,693 --> 00:38:26,875
to recognize the power that empowering their fans could have.

585
00:38:27,795 --> 00:38:30,335
You know, these... Nintendo is an institution.

586
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:31,976
Like, you know, so many people grew up...

587
00:38:32,516 --> 00:38:34,076
on the consoles, myself included.

588
00:38:34,696 --> 00:38:37,697
And it's part and parcel with my childhood.

589
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:42,998
So to have this company be so standoffish about letting us

590
00:38:43,459 --> 00:38:47,700
tell their stories or letting anyone, even like getting

591
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,100
streaming rights and stuff to just show the game at a

592
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:55,741
tournament, I think it has to change eventually.

593
00:38:55,782 --> 00:38:59,082
They have to recognize that eventually they have to be

594
00:38:59,142 --> 00:38:59,542
more open.

595
00:39:02,004 --> 00:39:04,366
acknowledge the fact that it's the 21st century now.

596
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:07,968
But you know, I, we'll see.

597
00:39:08,028 --> 00:39:09,249
We'll see what that timeline is like.

598
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:15,573
And for you guys, I mean, we talked a lot about League and you guys go to LCS and like

599
00:39:15,613 --> 00:39:18,455
Riot does a really awesome job about like building up their players.

600
00:39:18,735 --> 00:39:21,477
But actually, you also cover like a bunch of other games as well.

601
00:39:21,517 --> 00:39:25,760
So have you seen, you know, everyone, you know, rightfully so, uses Riot as an example

602
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,641
of like what they do right.

603
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:30,543
But are anyone, is anyone doing anything differently that helps you guys out?

604
00:39:33,217 --> 00:39:38,587
I mean, I primarily work with organizations that have put on the tournaments, so like

605
00:39:38,647 --> 00:39:39,468
ESL and things like that.

606
00:39:39,488 --> 00:39:45,560
So I work with them in my line of work when it comes to reaching the pro players and

607
00:39:47,448 --> 00:39:52,873
Making sure that I have press access to any story that I really want to talk about.

608
00:39:53,273 --> 00:39:57,697
When it comes to working with a game developer, Riot Games has always been really good to me.

609
00:39:58,178 --> 00:40:01,340
They're the ones that I'm most familiar with, like I said, or like even Travis said.

610
00:40:02,241 --> 00:40:03,822
If you are looking to get into...

611
00:40:05,784 --> 00:40:10,229
into eSports and you want to go down the Riot Games path, which obviously right now is the

612
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:15,576
most developed game developer that has the most successful eSport right now, I would

613
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:19,400
say just even contacting Nicola, she's in the audience, or someone at Riot.

614
00:40:19,761 --> 00:40:20,582
Sorry Nicola, I know.

615
00:40:22,244 --> 00:40:25,105
That will allow you into the press room, and they're very good about it,

616
00:40:26,325 --> 00:40:30,347
on weekends when it's not so busy for you to just get a better understanding and to learn about it.

617
00:40:31,668 --> 00:40:35,209
Or even if you're a game developer that are trying to figure out different ways to allow

618
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:42,573
these press to come in, I would say following that sort of path of just allowing these people

619
00:40:42,593 --> 00:40:46,555
to come in and tell the stories, or allowing the right people to come in and tell the stories,

620
00:40:47,255 --> 00:40:50,776
that you have faith will tell the stories effectively, would be the best approach.

621
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:55,957
Yeah, I can also speak to working with Blizzard a little bit. So obviously they're spinning up

622
00:40:55,997 --> 00:41:01,859
here as a storm. They'd really like that to be considered an e-sport. And just the enthusiasm

623
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:07,801
that I've seen from the press team over there in trying to ‑‑ what I appreciate is that they

624
00:41:07,861 --> 00:41:13,623
recognize that there's a lot of value in having not just, you know, your own company telling the

625
00:41:13,643 --> 00:41:18,884
stories of your players, but also having third party media in. And they have been really good

626
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:20,245
about trying to accommodate.

627
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,122
You know, journalists coming in, documentary people coming in,

628
00:41:24,202 --> 00:41:25,843
and just, you know, how can we make this happen?

629
00:41:25,863 --> 00:41:26,844
How can you come?

630
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,645
Like, when does the schedule align for you?

631
00:41:29,725 --> 00:41:31,106
How can we get you access to players?

632
00:41:31,146 --> 00:41:32,047
Who do you want to talk to?

633
00:41:32,527 --> 00:41:34,168
That stuff is so great to hear from them.

634
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:39,452
Conversely, you know, I had a friend who went to TI recently

635
00:41:39,492 --> 00:41:44,335
and explained to me that it was much, much harder to get access

636
00:41:44,355 --> 00:41:45,475
to players for interviews.

637
00:41:46,656 --> 00:41:47,757
And I think...

638
00:41:48,697 --> 00:41:57,920
Yeah, I mean if you are holding a tournament and you have your players like behind an iron curtain and there's no way for anybody to get access to them, surprise it's going to be a lot harder for people to tell stories about your players.

639
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,280
Might be accurate.

640
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,161
No comment.

641
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:08,182
So, do you guys feel like there are any missed opportunities the developers aren't doing right now to empower you to tell stories about their players?

642
00:42:11,257 --> 00:42:15,899
I mean, again, sort of what I was hinting at varies from

643
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:18,841
developer to developer, publisher to publisher.

644
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:22,742
I think that there are some that are obviously really

645
00:42:22,782 --> 00:42:25,924
great about trying to get you art assets and resources so

646
00:42:25,964 --> 00:42:28,965
that you can showcase gameplay footage in your stuff.

647
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:32,767
There's people who are great at trying to match you up with a

648
00:42:32,867 --> 00:42:35,748
player or even just giving you a place to work at their event

649
00:42:35,808 --> 00:42:36,448
that they're holding up.

650
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:39,650
I think that stuff goes a really long way.

651
00:42:42,188 --> 00:42:49,213
To kind of spin this off, I think, again, I really hope that developers and publishers

652
00:42:49,393 --> 00:42:55,437
understand the value of people telling the stories for your stuff.

653
00:42:55,457 --> 00:42:56,478
I know that's kind of the whole point.

654
00:42:56,518 --> 00:42:57,699
We're just reiterating this a ton.

655
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:16,227
I think developers and publishers understandably when they're thinking about their game, they think about it in the context of, oh, this is the game we've spent years developing, this is the balance team we've put together to make this so when people come and watch a tournament, it's not just about the

656
00:43:16,307 --> 00:43:20,610
They're going to be watching and see that big play or talking about how balance update

657
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:24,853
changes stuff. But you know what people really going to talk about? When you strip away the

658
00:43:24,873 --> 00:43:29,275
meta and strip away those big plays and all that stuff. At its core people two years from

659
00:43:29,295 --> 00:43:33,798
now might not remember why the team won this thing but they will remember that that player

660
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:39,582
who got second in every single tournament for years leading up to this finally won and

661
00:43:39,622 --> 00:43:43,344
was able to walk away with a trophy. And in that moment that's what they'll remember.

662
00:43:43,364 --> 00:43:45,505
And so I think that's what we're going to do. And I think that's what we're going to do.

663
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:50,427
For me, those opportunities, I just hope that developers and

664
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:54,589
publishers really recognize that that is something that is

665
00:43:54,609 --> 00:43:57,110
just organic and that they can't force and that they

666
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:58,830
really need to provide opportunities for those stories

667
00:43:58,870 --> 00:43:59,671
to play themselves out.

668
00:44:00,131 --> 00:44:02,392
Because you can throw like a million dollars into a prize

669
00:44:02,412 --> 00:44:03,732
pool, but guess what?

670
00:44:03,772 --> 00:44:06,093
People aren't going to keep caring about your sport or your

671
00:44:06,153 --> 00:44:09,694
e-sport if nobody knows why they should care about the

672
00:44:09,714 --> 00:44:10,735
players that are competing in it.

673
00:44:13,043 --> 00:44:13,583
I agree.

674
00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:17,526
Oh, sorry.

675
00:44:18,227 --> 00:44:21,129
So, kind of on the day-to-day, like how often do you have to interface?

676
00:44:21,189 --> 00:44:24,151
I mean, I'm sure we're going to get a lot of diverse answers here, but on the day-to-day,

677
00:44:24,251 --> 00:44:28,174
how often do you interface with these developers to gain access to players or tell different

678
00:44:28,194 --> 00:44:28,975
stories about their game?

679
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:34,139
Well, I mean, I maintain email contact with people at Blizzard's PR department, you know,

680
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:36,000
trying to work on other projects going forward.

681
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:36,720
It's pretty simple.

682
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,541
They're very accessible.

683
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:39,342
They're like, ah, text me, call me whenever you want.

684
00:44:39,603 --> 00:44:41,964
They really try to make it as easy as possible, specifically.

685
00:44:41,984 --> 00:44:42,064
Yeah.

686
00:44:42,084 --> 00:44:42,285
Absolutely.

687
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:42,385
Yeah.

688
00:44:45,591 --> 00:44:53,798
I would say, like, just, at least when I used to do this more full time, my week-to-week

689
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:59,463
was more so just making sure to respect the game developer, the publisher, contact them

690
00:44:59,564 --> 00:45:02,987
way ahead of time to make sure that they know that I'm going to be coming in and telling

691
00:45:03,027 --> 00:45:08,171
a story, and if they have any advice or anything, or want to help me get a pro player to do

692
00:45:08,212 --> 00:45:08,792
an interview with.

693
00:45:10,454 --> 00:45:13,437
then those are the sort of things that we would plan out way ahead of time.

694
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:18,923
Or like making sure that if I do know that these are the stories that I want to cover,

695
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:21,166
these are the things that I know people are going to find appealing,

696
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:27,032
do that research way beforehand and have that ready so that when you do attend the event

697
00:45:27,453 --> 00:45:29,355
and you've already talked to the publisher or the game developer,

698
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:37,015
That they know that you have this game plan and that they know that you're ready and you want these specific pro players.

699
00:45:38,076 --> 00:45:44,282
And you go into the event hoping that you'll get those pro players, because obviously it doesn't always happen the exact way that you expect it to.

700
00:45:45,323 --> 00:45:57,834
But you go in and you have kind of this set plan and schedule and a day-to-day for those pro players to then feel comfortable and know that you're doing your job right and that you're just more professional in that sense.

701
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,473
So we have time for just one more question and we'll just toss it over to Q&A.

702
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:09,841
So really quickly, so instead of giving advice to future content creators or future storytellers

703
00:46:09,881 --> 00:46:13,865
who would be interested in doing this, what advice would you have given to your past self?

704
00:46:13,925 --> 00:46:16,287
Because a lot of you guys have been doing this for years now.

705
00:46:19,182 --> 00:46:21,924
Do your own thing. Don't follow what everyone else is doing. If

706
00:46:21,944 --> 00:46:24,866
you go on Reddit or whatever on our Starcraft and you read, I'm

707
00:46:24,886 --> 00:46:26,707
going to make a YouTube channel where everyone is casting

708
00:46:26,768 --> 00:46:29,470
something. You can automatically know that this person is going

709
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:31,351
to fail because they're bringing nothing to the table that day

710
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:35,895
nine didn't five years ago. So find your niche, find something

711
00:46:35,915 --> 00:46:39,477
you're good at and hopefully it's a niche and just go after

712
00:46:39,517 --> 00:46:41,619
with passion and hopefully if you work hard enough it will

713
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:43,100
happen. That's just how it works.

714
00:46:45,456 --> 00:46:49,979
I think my advice could apply to other content creators as well, not just myself.

715
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:54,301
But I think that you find, specifically the authentic storytelling and stuff,

716
00:46:54,421 --> 00:46:55,942
and creating something that's meaningful,

717
00:46:58,163 --> 00:47:02,365
you find that that person has an interesting story, at least on its face,

718
00:47:02,425 --> 00:47:05,207
and you can see creating a story around them.

719
00:47:05,787 --> 00:47:07,648
But I think it's a little counterintuitive,

720
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:11,870
but I think you have to become an expert at fictional storytelling

721
00:47:13,171 --> 00:47:13,711
because...

722
00:47:14,751 --> 00:47:21,155
The way we perceive reality in a very real sense is sort of a narrative process.

723
00:47:21,215 --> 00:47:26,698
We go through our day-to-day lives, we have overt goals, we have subconscious goals, we

724
00:47:26,738 --> 00:47:28,499
have antagonists in our lives.

725
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:31,560
We are the protagonists in what we do.

726
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:36,983
So that's not surprising why the classical Western narrative is the most popular form

727
00:47:37,023 --> 00:47:38,104
of story and has been for a long time.

728
00:47:40,545 --> 00:47:46,326
So if you become an expert at that storytelling structure, you are so much more empowered

729
00:47:46,746 --> 00:47:54,248
to when you see the interesting story that you want to tell with your eSports guy, you

730
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:58,710
can take those elements and see where they match up and learn how to tell that in the

731
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:03,071
way that will be most impactful and most meaningful to your potential audience.

732
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:07,692
I think I would probably tell myself to, while it's good to

733
00:48:07,732 --> 00:48:11,635
listen to community feedback and criticism, you should take

734
00:48:11,675 --> 00:48:12,496
it all with a grain of salt.

735
00:48:12,816 --> 00:48:15,999
One of the things that I have tried since I started,

736
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:19,361
basically because I started off of Reddit, is to interact

737
00:48:19,381 --> 00:48:21,023
with that community constantly.

738
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,566
Anytime I have content go up there, it's hang out in the

739
00:48:24,586 --> 00:48:26,607
comments or listen to Twitter or whatever.

740
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:29,309
And I think that's allowed me to really iterate on the

741
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:31,091
content that I'm creating and make it better.

742
00:48:32,172 --> 00:48:38,718
On the other hand, it is true that I've probably let that stuff get to me sometimes whenever people are very critical of something.

743
00:48:39,479 --> 00:48:48,007
And there's been moments in time where that sort of emotion or the feeling that comes from that will work to make me not want to do something.

744
00:48:48,227 --> 00:48:51,310
Or I'll shut down an idea early on because I'll think,

745
00:48:52,678 --> 00:48:57,923
I'll get blown up for doing this or what if it's not the quality bar at the gate that I pride

746
00:48:57,943 --> 00:49:05,750
myself in and so then, you know, people will say that I suck. And so I think just being prepared

747
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:11,616
to like do it anyway and have people tell you that you suck or whatever and then do it again and

748
00:49:11,816 --> 00:49:17,181
have less people do that, I think that that's something that you just have to kind of steal

749
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:17,661
yourself for.

750
00:49:19,012 --> 00:49:21,526
I actually agree a lot with Travis, the other one.

751
00:49:25,113 --> 00:49:29,835
I think learning proper narrative structure was really important.

752
00:49:30,575 --> 00:49:37,637
I learned that probably around this last six or seven months is trying to figure out how

753
00:49:37,657 --> 00:49:42,999
to tell a character's storyline properly to where an audience can digest it.

754
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:46,740
And that kind of breaks some of that barrier of like, I don't understand eSports, but what

755
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,360
is a story?

756
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,701
The majority of people will understand like a...

757
00:49:50,581 --> 00:49:56,985
traditional narrative structure and so it helps a lot where you can see like, oh, this is a conflict, this is a protagonist, this is an antagonist.

758
00:49:57,826 --> 00:50:02,949
And then also I would have told myself to work with Travis sooner, because we did a great doublelift three part series.

759
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:07,252
Doublelift and Nikola are the stars of this panel, if you guys haven't figured it out.

760
00:50:09,067 --> 00:50:12,710
My advice would be to, I guess, follow more with this, Travis.

761
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:16,753
Going into it, I was extremely nervous.

762
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:21,237
The community that I was mainly focusing on was the League of Legends community,

763
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:26,041
and I was warned beforehand that they can be toxic at times, just like any other community.

764
00:50:27,622 --> 00:50:35,168
But, I guess also going into it, being a female within the scene was a lot of pressure, I felt like, originally.

765
00:50:36,269 --> 00:50:36,729
So, I think...

766
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:42,707
Beforehand, I was very nervous about how I presented myself, both on camera and off

767
00:50:42,727 --> 00:50:46,091
camera, as well as the comments that I was going to be receiving.

768
00:50:46,472 --> 00:50:48,194
However, now I realize that that's not...

769
00:50:49,022 --> 00:50:52,205
The base thing that I should have been focusing on, the stories that I was telling was about

770
00:50:52,245 --> 00:50:54,286
the pro players and about the games themselves.

771
00:50:55,247 --> 00:50:59,070
That's where the focus was and it had nothing to do with me and I shouldn't have even been

772
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:05,636
nervous or I guess I can guess myself in any way because I was really just trying to tell

773
00:51:05,656 --> 00:51:08,698
the story about them and that's what the audience ultimately wanted.

774
00:51:09,158 --> 00:51:09,959
So I would say focus on...

775
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:20,585
So, I guess this goes with Damian and the other Travis, making sure that you have the

776
00:51:20,605 --> 00:51:25,428
correct elements and components to create a really compelling story for the audience

777
00:51:25,468 --> 00:51:30,451
to come in to then become passionate about not only the game, but the players themselves,

778
00:51:31,352 --> 00:51:32,012
I think is huge.

779
00:51:32,532 --> 00:51:32,732
All right.

780
00:51:32,973 --> 00:51:33,193
Awesome.

781
00:51:33,253 --> 00:51:33,753
Thanks, guys.

782
00:51:33,773 --> 00:51:37,615
So, we'll open up to Q&A, and I think there are two microphones over there.

783
00:51:39,064 --> 00:51:41,526
So we'll start to my right.

784
00:51:41,846 --> 00:51:42,107
Where am I?

785
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:47,151
How do you balance stories about,

786
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:51,434
sorry, how do you balance deciding whether to tell stories

787
00:51:51,454 --> 00:51:54,196
about individual players or about teams and franchises?

788
00:51:54,777 --> 00:51:55,417
And how to sort of...

789
00:51:55,437 --> 00:51:58,500
Yeah, so the question is how do you balance

790
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,822
telling stories about a player versus a team

791
00:52:00,922 --> 00:52:02,003
or a franchise or anything like that?

792
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:09,912
I think I always go with player over franchise. I don't know if Team Liquid would want me to say that.

793
00:52:11,313 --> 00:52:14,715
I always find it more interesting from a personal player perspective.

794
00:52:15,015 --> 00:52:21,458
And actually a lot of the pieces that I work on travel back in time to players when they were on previous teams.

795
00:52:22,278 --> 00:52:26,600
It's also very nice to talk about a franchise and its lineage and the owners and what it's based upon.

796
00:52:27,281 --> 00:52:33,185
But ultimately at the end of the day, for me at least, I connect with players a lot more than I connect with brains.

797
00:52:37,147 --> 00:52:37,288
Thanks.

798
00:52:37,308 --> 00:52:44,392
Hi, thanks a lot. You guys touched on a little bit about what developers and publishers could do to facilitate storytelling.

799
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:54,599
Looking for more from an actual feature perspective in an eSports game, are there specific features that you guys are missing in current games that facilitate storytelling?

800
00:52:55,801 --> 00:53:00,704
Observer modes or things like that that we could build to better facilitate that.

801
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:01,084
Thanks.

802
00:53:01,765 --> 00:53:05,066
So the question was what features can developers provide to enable storytelling?

803
00:53:05,962 --> 00:53:12,265
So I have a free to play was a documentary that valve did about

804
00:53:12,405 --> 00:53:17,608
their Dota 2 game. And some of the most immersing slash like

805
00:53:17,668 --> 00:53:20,449
interesting things that were done in that is they had like

806
00:53:20,509 --> 00:53:24,271
these insane like CGI kind of renders but apparently it was

807
00:53:24,311 --> 00:53:25,231
all captured in game.

808
00:53:25,872 --> 00:53:33,594
Not sure if that's true, but a lot of this like really immersive sort of like quick cuts of action that showed how intense a moment was

809
00:53:34,715 --> 00:53:37,896
For me as a League of Legends storyteller, that's not available

810
00:53:37,956 --> 00:53:41,197
so that was probably the most frustrating thing over the last couple years is that

811
00:53:41,537 --> 00:53:44,560
I couldn't go in and watch a team fight from a different perspective.

812
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:49,403
There was a couple episodes where I attempted to recreate what happened in the game.

813
00:53:49,724 --> 00:53:50,644
Didn't work out very well.

814
00:53:50,985 --> 00:53:52,506
But kind of almost worked out well.

815
00:53:52,966 --> 00:53:58,610
So having a replay system or being able to download the game files and pull full HD renders

816
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:01,252
of everything is really nice as opposed to trying to blow up 720 to 1080.

817
00:54:04,114 --> 00:54:09,096
So just having a lot of access to the game at least at a bare

818
00:54:09,276 --> 00:54:13,918
minimum level of the game files and on top of that having access

819
00:54:14,038 --> 00:54:18,219
to move your camera around in some sort of free roam state is

820
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:23,000
really good not only just for the bare bones highlight reels

821
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,182
that you see people put together with sick plays but also from a

822
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:28,102
narrative perspective to get a different view.

823
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:33,890
Great, thank you.

824
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:34,931
All right, thanks for the question.

825
00:54:35,211 --> 00:54:35,431
Over here.

826
00:54:35,992 --> 00:54:37,012
Hey guys, I'm Steven.

827
00:54:37,032 --> 00:54:38,654
I used to play professionally in the past.

828
00:54:39,294 --> 00:54:40,755
And one thing I was going to ask you

829
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,976
from an interviewer perspective

830
00:54:41,996 --> 00:54:44,038
and also from a documentary perspective,

831
00:54:44,638 --> 00:54:46,220
you have a high level of access to players

832
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,442
and that may be coming down as we professionalize more.

833
00:54:49,902 --> 00:54:52,364
But how do you deal with the emotional intelligence

834
00:54:52,384 --> 00:54:55,507
of understanding a player right after they play

835
00:54:55,687 --> 00:54:57,448
and you want to interview them to get them in the moment?

836
00:54:57,789 --> 00:55:00,050
How do you handle the emotional intelligence part of that

837
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,411
when you're speaking with a player?

838
00:55:01,956 --> 00:55:07,081
So you're speaking to after a loss or something or after a win, how do you deal with that raw emotion after?

839
00:55:07,101 --> 00:55:13,146
Yeah, I mean, obviously, that's a great time to interview anyone.

840
00:55:13,526 --> 00:55:20,372
It's fantastic to have someone get that kind of raw energy in the immediate moment.

841
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:24,116
It's funny because, of course, the immediate question you want to ask is,

842
00:55:24,616 --> 00:55:26,838
How do you feel? Or, how does it feel?

843
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:35,181
which is maybe not a very good one. But I don't know. It's an

844
00:55:35,221 --> 00:55:39,303
interesting challenge every time. It's like you have so much

845
00:55:39,383 --> 00:55:41,104
energy coming off of this person and how do you really

846
00:55:41,144 --> 00:55:45,045
encapsulate that moment for people who are at home to watch.

847
00:55:45,185 --> 00:55:48,647
I think there actually I can give a pretty good example.

848
00:55:48,687 --> 00:55:51,328
There was a moment after CLG won and knew they were going to be

849
00:55:51,368 --> 00:55:53,609
making it to Madison Square Garden last year and I

850
00:55:53,649 --> 00:55:57,550
interviewed their bot lane and they were just so happy.

851
00:55:59,191 --> 00:56:06,115
And normally you're like, okay, cool, they're going to celebrate, they're going to talk about how they're finally like where they think that they've needed to be as a team for years.

852
00:56:06,695 --> 00:56:09,697
And all they wanted to do was, excuse the language, but fuck around.

853
00:56:10,458 --> 00:56:14,680
So people can go see this interview, it was with Aftermoon Doublelift, and they just troll me the entire time.

854
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,782
And I'm like, you can see like in the first five minutes I'm

855
00:56:17,802 --> 00:56:21,005
like, well, I'm like trying to get it back on topic and

856
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:23,867
eventually I just gave up and let them have fun. I think

857
00:56:24,007 --> 00:56:27,109
ultimately realizing that, you know, it's at that point in

858
00:56:27,129 --> 00:56:32,013
time like their show to steer and to run, just letting them

859
00:56:32,073 --> 00:56:34,275
have that runway to just say whatever they want to do or

860
00:56:34,295 --> 00:56:37,377
whatever, I think that's really the path forward.

861
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:41,400
Cool. Thanks for the question.

862
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,782
We might only have time for one more but I'll try to sneak

863
00:56:43,822 --> 00:56:44,222
another one in.

864
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:50,997
So as a publisher developer kind of doing our own thing and hoping to break into the eSports world

865
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:56,763
What kind of stuff could our marketing team do internally that would

866
00:56:57,924 --> 00:57:02,709
differ from what say a player created or influencer created YouTube content?

867
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:05,596
that they would provide.

868
00:57:05,616 --> 00:57:11,020
So what could we do that would help, I guess, facilitate or foster an esports community

869
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,263
opposed to what a player could do better, essentially.

870
00:57:14,924 --> 00:57:19,848
So the question is, as a publisher or a developer, what can your internal marketing team do that's

871
00:57:19,868 --> 00:57:22,951
different than what a content creator provides or an interviewer provides?

872
00:57:24,272 --> 00:57:28,075
I think it's really important to put your players on a pedestal, so to speak.

873
00:57:28,555 --> 00:57:31,698
So like, say for example, if, I think it was...

874
00:57:33,202 --> 00:57:39,988
SMITE, they put a lot of their content creators and like players up to the forefront and that

875
00:57:40,008 --> 00:57:44,412
was really interesting when I was learning about that. But just like any new game developer

876
00:57:44,432 --> 00:57:48,676
I think if you have a player let's say streaming your brand new game right and this is like

877
00:57:48,696 --> 00:57:52,860
a pro player from a team or a player that you think might go pro, like sort of blast

878
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,204
some of that stuff out on social media and like give them the platform to show off your

879
00:57:57,244 --> 00:57:59,426
game more than they might have normally.

880
00:58:00,838 --> 00:58:04,503
And you can do that in game too by offering a one button click.

881
00:58:04,823 --> 00:58:08,669
You can now spectate your top players just from the main launch screen.

882
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:10,531
That's a pretty decent example, I think.

883
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:14,198
If we go super quickly, we actually have time for two.

884
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:15,299
So we'll start over here.

885
00:58:15,499 --> 00:58:18,082
So most of you guys work in well-established gaming

886
00:58:18,122 --> 00:58:19,703
communities, but what about communities

887
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:21,706
where the viewership and the money is not quite there?

888
00:58:22,026 --> 00:58:25,289
And so the common response I get to certain communities

889
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:26,991
where I say, where's the content, where's the narratives,

890
00:58:27,051 --> 00:58:29,754
is that there is no narratives to be told, which is,

891
00:58:30,094 --> 00:58:31,756
what would you say to people like that

892
00:58:31,856 --> 00:58:33,598
that are discouraged from writing

893
00:58:33,638 --> 00:58:35,019
in those type of communities?

894
00:58:36,427 --> 00:58:38,028
First off, sup, Tafo, how you doing?

895
00:58:38,188 --> 00:58:38,528
What's up?

896
00:58:39,569 --> 00:58:43,830
And second, I think there's so many stories everywhere.

897
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:48,132
Like, I was actually, I've been, when I wait for renders and stuff,

898
00:58:48,172 --> 00:58:52,154
and I'm editing and things, I only have time to play a really quick game.

899
00:58:52,194 --> 00:58:53,755
And I'll play TagPro often.

900
00:58:54,235 --> 00:58:55,696
And it's this really simple game.

901
00:58:55,816 --> 00:58:57,837
It's kind of a small community.

902
00:58:58,347 --> 00:59:02,808
And you wouldn't necessarily think that there's a lot of stories there, but my imagination

903
00:59:02,868 --> 00:59:07,350
runs wild with like who are these characters or these people behind these like dots that

904
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:08,571
are running around on the screen.

905
00:59:08,591 --> 00:59:12,752
Agario is another similar kind of game where it's just like dots moving around.

906
00:59:12,772 --> 00:59:18,394
And I think because it is so ambiguous, you know, sort of the graphics and stuff and not

907
00:59:18,414 --> 00:59:20,875
knowing anybody behind there, you know, you just

908
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:25,543
You just have to dig. There are stories everywhere.

909
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:28,164
There is no one telling him. It's fertile ground. No competition.

910
00:59:28,705 --> 00:59:29,925
Go for it.

911
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:30,426
Last question.

912
00:59:30,446 --> 00:59:33,488
This is actually a question about the Smash Brothers.

913
00:59:34,248 --> 00:59:38,110
You had a bunch of the top players in but you didn't have Armada.

914
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:40,252
I'm curious why you chose not to include that story.

915
00:59:40,392 --> 00:59:43,213
He is briefly in as a doubles partner for Mew2King.

916
00:59:43,634 --> 00:59:45,635
I'm curious how you made that decision.

917
00:59:46,555 --> 00:59:51,879
It was a tough call. I actually, part of me was like hoping that I would get the chance to do

918
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,241
something else with Armada and that ended up happening so I'm very happy about that.

919
00:59:56,702 --> 01:00:01,104
But I had to sort of truncate it, you know, I was like these are the guys that I want to tell

920
01:00:01,124 --> 01:00:05,367
the story about and, you know, there's only a certain amount of resources that I had. Like,

921
01:00:05,407 --> 01:00:08,789
I was, I had quit my job at the time and like I was eating ramen and

922
01:00:09,409 --> 01:00:15,373
Eventually I was like, okay, Evo is coming up. We just got into that. That would be a great

923
01:00:15,433 --> 01:00:21,296
capper to seal the whole thing. We're back in the spotlight kind of thing. So I kind of saw

924
01:00:21,316 --> 01:00:27,439
that as a proper way to end it. It was a little bit like Armada is in it at the very end of the

925
01:00:27,479 --> 01:00:32,022
last few episodes. But it's almost like I set him up as a pin for Mango to knock down and that

926
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:32,462
was the end.

927
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:37,506
He definitely gets different treatment in this movie that I'm producing right now, but

928
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:40,429
that's, that was kind of, sort of arbitrary I guess.

929
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:45,033
It's like, same reason I couldn't really give an episode to Chewdat, who I think probably

930
01:00:45,073 --> 01:00:45,613
deserved one.

931
01:00:45,753 --> 01:00:49,777
It was just that, you know, I had to be ruthless in my decision making.

932
01:00:49,797 --> 01:00:51,338
All right, thanks.

933
01:00:51,478 --> 01:00:53,920
Thanks everyone for coming and thanks to all the panels for showing up.

934
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:54,201
Thank you.

935
01:00:54,221 --> 01:00:54,401
Thank you.

936
01:00:54,421 --> 01:00:54,601
Thank you.

937
01:00:54,621 --> 01:00:55,682
Thank you.

938
01:00:55,702 --> 01:00:55,902
Thank you.

939
01:00:55,922 --> 01:00:56,382
Thank you.

940
01:00:56,422 --> 01:00:56,603
Thank you.

941
01:00:56,623 --> 01:00:57,383
Thank you.

942
01:00:59,068 --> 01:00:59,851
Be sure to fill out the survey.

943
01:00:59,871 --> 01:01:02,238
And also, I think some of us will be hanging out outside, right, to answer more questions?

944
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:02,338
Yeah.

945
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:02,559
Right, cool.

946
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:02,920
Thanks, guys.

947
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:03,020
Cool.

948
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:03,181
Thanks.

949
01:01:03,221 --> 01:01:03,341
Thanks.

950
01:01:03,361 --> 01:01:03,502
