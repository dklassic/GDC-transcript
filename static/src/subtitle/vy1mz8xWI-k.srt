1
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:08,089
called the Distributed Art Direction of Edith Finch.

2
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:13,874
And so how best to kick off the Art Direction Bootcamp

3
00:00:13,874 --> 00:00:17,758
to have me, not an art director, talk to you about it.

4
00:00:18,563 --> 00:00:20,684
So basically, my name is Chelsea Hash.

5
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:25,326
I was the technical art lead on this project

6
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:27,106
with Giant Sparrow.

7
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:30,067
And one of the reasons I'm here talking to you today

8
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:32,448
is because we didn't really have an art director,

9
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:33,548
no single art director.

10
00:00:33,548 --> 00:00:35,969
But we did have a group of people

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,850
that really loved a project, had their own perspectives,

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,531
and worked together to make it happen.

13
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:45,412
I was also there for very early and stayed for very late.

14
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:45,512
So,

15
00:00:47,612 --> 00:00:50,695
If I make any mistakes in characterizing people's efforts,

16
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:54,380
I apologize, but I think this was like the inspiration

17
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,082
for how we ended up going together.

18
00:00:56,082 --> 00:01:00,527
So, this is more of the same.

19
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,829
Oh man, that audio.

20
00:01:03,204 --> 00:01:03,784
Don't worry about it.

21
00:01:03,784 --> 00:01:07,826
So again, this is how an indie game put together an art plan

22
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:10,347
without a single director.

23
00:01:10,347 --> 00:01:13,768
Part of it was how we built our plan at our own pace

24
00:01:13,768 --> 00:01:15,589
and tried to stay true to a single goal

25
00:01:15,589 --> 00:01:18,109
while still not having it all planned from the beginning.

26
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:21,631
And then a big part of this takeaway

27
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:24,572
will be remembering the bits that worked,

28
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:26,172
even though there were a lot of painful parts

29
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:27,993
that were hard to deal with at the time.

30
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:35,861
This is an example of, whoopsies.

31
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:39,548
I do not know how to operate this thing.

32
00:01:39,548 --> 00:01:41,111
Nope.

33
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:49,781
So when we got started, we had just three

34
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:54,404
of the original people from The Unfinished Swan stayed on.

35
00:01:54,404 --> 00:01:57,406
So that was a creative director, technical director,

36
00:01:57,406 --> 00:01:59,327
and one environment artist.

37
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:03,930
And so some of the early shots of the green light trailer

38
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,014
were evocative and sparse and not quite landing

39
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:09,835
on this thing.

40
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:20,867
This is an example of how we went from something like this to something like this.

41
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:27,273
So to get started, it all started with Ian, creative director.

42
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:32,698
And we had a little bit of Google image search art direction.

43
00:02:33,702 --> 00:02:35,082
But it wasn't just Google image search.

44
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:39,724
These were all collections of snapshots from movies,

45
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:43,866
personal photos from actual houses that we lived in.

46
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:48,189
All of these pilled with explanations

47
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:50,970
of exactly what they meant and how they fit in.

48
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,271
We had synopses of, let's see what I got.

49
00:02:54,952 --> 00:02:58,935
These are some scratch from an art direction presentation.

50
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:03,298
We had some art math where we'd combine looks from one area

51
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:05,520
with some art inspirations from another

52
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,941
to land on a final experience.

53
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:09,923
We had no's, we had no's,

54
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,344
definite no's and definite yes's.

55
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:14,486
And so no one could approach the project

56
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,868
and say we didn't have a goal in mind.

57
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:21,874
but it was a very big body of inspiration.

58
00:03:21,874 --> 00:03:28,095
We had collages for plans for many, many bits of our work.

59
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:31,315
And in the end, it was sort of a curation.

60
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:33,016
These were specific photos,

61
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:35,416
and yet we were not targeting a photo-real look.

62
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,296
These were evocative,

63
00:03:37,296 --> 00:03:39,597
and they had certain places and spaces,

64
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:42,357
but they weren't exactly what we were trying to build.

65
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:45,258
So it was that curation process

66
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,118
that ended up falling to the job on.

67
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:49,574
the concept artist.

68
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:52,777
Well, actually, this is another one of my favorites.

69
00:03:52,777 --> 00:03:56,221
All of the hit lists, notes, and plans,

70
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:59,764
the bulleted lists of things that we were going to work on,

71
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:04,448
and my favorite, summary images of what was

72
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:05,329
going on at a given moment.

73
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:05,549
And so.

74
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:11,304
We started with some efforts.

75
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:12,886
We had some specific inspirations.

76
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,168
We were kind of aiming for stylized.

77
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:18,732
It was very difficult to go from a game

78
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:21,795
like The Unfinished Swan with its dark,

79
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:25,218
black and white art style, and then suddenly say,

80
00:04:25,218 --> 00:04:27,100
now we're jumping into a new engine

81
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,962
with expectations much higher.

82
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:31,064
Like, what are we actually trying to build?

83
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:39,229
So we have one on the right, which is a color graded forest, and then one which is a custom

84
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:42,951
concept, kind of combining pictorialism and some art deco.

85
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:52,118
And so our concept artist, Theo Aredos, was the first person to really say, this isn't

86
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:53,799
a collage, this is something specific.

87
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:57,882
You're trying to build together the house.

88
00:04:57,882 --> 00:04:58,843
What did it look like?

89
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:07,420
We had, you know, this is again, we still could have been making a game that was very flat.

90
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:14,165
So we had, you know, a bunch of examples of making paintings from some of these collages

91
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:22,570
and turning them into mock-ups. We had many, many versions of the house, the lighting condition,

92
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:28,013
and they were all like, you know, for mood and tone. We, you know, we felt good about these things.

93
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:32,016
we started building.

94
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:37,778
So this is an example of we had some pretty strong reference.

95
00:05:37,778 --> 00:05:39,799
And in the beginning, a lot of these references

96
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:44,421
sort of translate very literally into the spaces.

97
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:48,202
And therefore, Corey, environment artist,

98
00:05:48,202 --> 00:05:54,245
and one of the beginning holdover,

99
00:05:54,245 --> 00:05:58,246
still with us from Unfinished Swan, built our first space.

100
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:01,236
And so this was like a pretty faithful reproduction.

101
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:04,557
We were getting areas that went from concepts

102
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:08,979
into their spaces very specifically,

103
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:13,061
and not yet knowing exactly the level of detail.

104
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:15,282
Come on, buddy.

105
00:06:15,282 --> 00:06:15,722
There we go.

106
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:19,964
So we were able to put together a vertical slice

107
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:21,445
with this team.

108
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:24,146
No art direction, we had a lot of inspirations.

109
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:24,946
We were hitting mood.

110
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:31,665
But a big part of it was that, you know, as part of the gameplay, we had this experiment,

111
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:34,186
we had a whole house in addition to stories.

112
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:38,268
There were so many things to build, it was difficult for one person to do it.

113
00:06:38,268 --> 00:06:44,350
And there are parts of it, you know, the essence is there, you know, but there are parts that

114
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:44,850
were empty.

115
00:06:45,777 --> 00:06:50,361
We move forward like you saw in this room was empty.

116
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:52,703
We had areas that we started.

117
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,506
You're interacting with objects as one of our main mechanics.

118
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:59,630
And you're jumping from inside a house in one person's body

119
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,212
to inside a story in another person's body.

120
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:05,995
And so this is sort of where I came in

121
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:08,237
with a team of character artists.

122
00:07:08,237 --> 00:07:09,939
And we sort of asked ourselves a question.

123
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:10,119
Is this?

124
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,602
I have some duplicates.

125
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:18,302
Is this a game?

126
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:20,723
Are we going to be the indie studio that

127
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:23,324
makes another game with a person without a body?

128
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:23,844
You look down.

129
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:26,385
I mean, there's a lot of challenges.

130
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:28,125
If we're going to have all these interactions,

131
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,426
suddenly we're committing to have to build out

132
00:07:30,426 --> 00:07:31,727
characters for each one.

133
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:33,987
And yet, for me, I felt very strongly

134
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:37,369
that having this moment and the repeated essence of seeing

135
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:40,130
hands and seeing not your hands was very important.

136
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,860
So we started with an outsource,

137
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,780
and these were the first two hands in the game.

138
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,501
We had Edith and Molly, and it was also,

139
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:52,522
as I was assuring everyone, don't worry,

140
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:58,003
every kid can use the same small kid hands.

141
00:07:58,003 --> 00:07:59,863
But it translated what was previously

142
00:07:59,863 --> 00:08:03,824
empty, oh, I can't see what it's playing,

143
00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:05,085
into moments like this.

144
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:15,356
And so, you know, despite the concern that this was not going to be enough time,

145
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:21,181
or this was not going to be enough bang for the buck, so to speak,

146
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:22,903
we sort of soldiered on.

147
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,804
You know, we went from moments that had read like this

148
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,887
in the vertical slice, you know, to moments more like this.

149
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,632
And then we have these moments of transition

150
00:08:43,632 --> 00:08:47,255
where it was starting to change the design.

151
00:08:47,255 --> 00:08:50,877
Trying to build something that communicated effectively

152
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:53,319
went from a purely design problem

153
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:55,040
or a purely static mesh problem

154
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,642
to like the combination of these elements.

155
00:08:57,642 --> 00:09:00,584
In early versions of the game,

156
00:09:00,584 --> 00:09:02,366
there was no hands in this scene,

157
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:05,608
which kind of gave us, didn't give us the opportunity,

158
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:05,808
oops,

159
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:05,968
to...

160
00:09:09,123 --> 00:09:10,244
silently communicate.

161
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:11,625
Most people when they play the game

162
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,848
wouldn't necessarily think about who is this person.

163
00:09:14,848 --> 00:09:17,290
But then being able to see them again at the end,

164
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,011
you have these like silent mechanics,

165
00:09:19,011 --> 00:09:20,692
things that we didn't have to call out.

166
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:23,174
And so suddenly writing is being helped by art,

167
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:24,235
which is helping design.

168
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:28,399
And we didn't, this wasn't a preconceived notion.

169
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,261
It was just dealing with what was happening at the moment

170
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:33,163
with the assets that we had

171
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:34,884
and the moments that were working.

172
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:36,906
So sometimes environment art would rise

173
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:37,907
to meet the challenge.

174
00:09:38,772 --> 00:09:44,620
Sometimes, whoops, sometimes character art would.

175
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,765
And so this is skipping a little bit ahead

176
00:09:48,765 --> 00:09:51,949
in my narrative of how detailed it was,

177
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:54,852
but being able to start to build the game around this

178
00:09:54,852 --> 00:09:57,796
as having access to it was meaningful.

179
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:03,349
In addition, those previously empty spaces

180
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:06,811
started to be filled with people that had impressions

181
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:10,113
and motivations and styles.

182
00:10:10,113 --> 00:10:12,855
We were still trying to establish

183
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:15,597
what would be in these scenes, because in early versions,

184
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:18,679
we just had white sheets over all of the areas.

185
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:21,301
We knew that we wanted to have a story object in a space,

186
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:23,142
but we didn't know, are we hiding it?

187
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:25,596
Are we making it available?

188
00:10:25,596 --> 00:10:26,696
Like, who are these people?

189
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:28,277
Do they know each other?

190
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:30,237
And part of that investigation came

191
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:32,618
through building the characters themselves.

192
00:10:32,618 --> 00:10:36,099
Just show a few of these.

193
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:44,242
And there are stories actually, sorry,

194
00:10:44,242 --> 00:10:48,523
there are stories like this one where the spindle

195
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,064
at one version just had no hands

196
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:51,444
and it didn't need an explanation.

197
00:10:52,757 --> 00:10:55,978
But then later, when we iterated on stories like this one,

198
00:10:55,978 --> 00:11:00,521
it would have been much harder

199
00:11:00,521 --> 00:11:01,761
and much less of an experience

200
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,962
had we not committed to that early.

201
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:07,344
So there were stories that we never would have executed

202
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:08,565
the way that we did

203
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:11,006
had we not made these choices in the beginning.

204
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:11,206
And then.

205
00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:20,098
I think I might have been overboard on our examples of characters.

206
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:25,240
But there were moments too where we promised there will only ever be hands, and then we

207
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,180
started to include more.

208
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,081
But never more than we could handle.

209
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:38,064
And so, with that information, level designer Chris Bell could go on and take rough outs

210
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:42,485
that looked like this, and start to build more bones.

211
00:11:43,932 --> 00:11:46,174
Our previously empty spaces were partially empty

212
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:48,295
because we didn't have, we weren't sure

213
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:49,556
what needed to be included.

214
00:11:49,556 --> 00:11:51,757
We knew we didn't want it to be overstuffed

215
00:11:51,757 --> 00:11:53,459
with the wrong kinds of things.

216
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,040
We knew we wanted sort of mundane props.

217
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,223
We knew we wanted to have a sense of having been lived in

218
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:02,865
and sealed off, but who are these people?

219
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:08,068
So our level designer went through

220
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:10,850
and revised each room over and over again

221
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,192
as we built a better understanding of these characters.

222
00:12:14,202 --> 00:12:18,567
and then generated very detailed gray boxes in Maya.

223
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:20,610
He did lots of temp prop modeling,

224
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,593
just as quick as he could to put something together

225
00:12:22,593 --> 00:12:24,315
that communicated.

226
00:12:24,315 --> 00:12:27,159
And then after searching through his image post history

227
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:29,842
on Slack, this is like not even 10%.

228
00:12:30,871 --> 00:12:34,054
of the level of specificity that design,

229
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:37,116
based on the narrative, was providing

230
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:39,018
to this environment artists.

231
00:12:39,018 --> 00:12:42,440
And then over time, like these gray boxes,

232
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,243
as we had more in the engine, got more sophisticated.

233
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:48,225
So we had things that looked more and more evocative

234
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,627
of the final product being delivered.

235
00:12:50,627 --> 00:12:53,049
And so now with that level of information,

236
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:54,870
or this is my fun transition,

237
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,213
we could go and make,

238
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:04,150
not have to make trailers that look so much like this,

239
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:10,936
and instead transition to a team that could fill it out.

240
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:15,400
So we were joined by some AAA talent, Brandon Martynowicz,

241
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,722
and he put together an environment art team

242
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:20,124
that was ready to take all of these experiments

243
00:13:20,124 --> 00:13:23,067
and all of this definition, and then start to get specific.

244
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:27,673
rather than just like color and mood studies where, you know,

245
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:31,016
our environment artists was sort of struggling to say, well, yes,

246
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:33,737
it's, you know, it's orange or yes, it's blue, but like, you

247
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:37,600
know, what are those blobs? So, you know, we got more specific

248
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,964
direction from concept art. We had strong tie-ins from

249
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:47,628
We hadn't lost the spirit of the original photos.

250
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:49,409
We had photos, we had color studies,

251
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:51,249
but we also had specifics.

252
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:53,390
Like these line drawings are very, very close

253
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,610
to what we ended up building.

254
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,251
And that'll let us just to finalize the look of the house.

255
00:13:58,251 --> 00:14:04,613
We have these specific props telling specific stories

256
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:07,473
about people's lives and not sort of consuming

257
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:08,814
with a house with generic fill.

258
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:09,934
You're like, this was a house

259
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,975
that was specifically for the Finches.

260
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:15,453
Having that kind of specificity as well

261
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:18,235
provided context for the design team.

262
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:19,876
Suddenly we had a big machine

263
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:21,117
that was ready to churn out art.

264
00:14:21,117 --> 00:14:23,179
And so some of these investigations

265
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:25,161
where we thought maybe it could be one way

266
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:26,822
or maybe it could be another,

267
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:28,844
like eventually if the game was gonna get shipped

268
00:14:28,844 --> 00:14:31,306
we had this pressure that you had a team of people

269
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:33,567
that could make things look amazing

270
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:36,290
and much higher bar than we had expected before.

271
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,532
But it meant that we had to make some decisions.

272
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,624
So in addition to just increasing the overall quality

273
00:14:43,624 --> 00:14:48,509
and polish, we started to get distinctive features.

274
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:53,473
We had the ability to really dive deep

275
00:14:53,473 --> 00:14:55,275
on individual characters and locations

276
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:57,957
and round them out.

277
00:14:57,957 --> 00:14:58,478
We also had

278
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:04,700
this is not the best representation, but we had time of days within stories,

279
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,484
and we also had a narrative shift with sort of like a behemoth technical effort

280
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:14,469
prior to bake sets and Unreal to allow the house to actually change

281
00:15:14,469 --> 00:15:16,831
times of day as we move through.

282
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:18,573
And then also expanded our color palette.

283
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:23,972
We were building a range of experiences

284
00:15:23,972 --> 00:15:26,272
that weren't just in our dark moody phase,

285
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:30,354
but turning into what becomes moody

286
00:15:30,354 --> 00:15:33,314
after different snapshots of lives.

287
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:35,315
So these lives expanded.

288
00:15:35,315 --> 00:15:42,977
And so in addition, another industry veteran, Keith Garrett,

289
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:48,779
came on with the experience coming from.

290
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,080
Naughty dog.

291
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,981
I don't know if he's here.

292
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:56,826
As a visual effects specialist, suddenly we

293
00:15:56,826 --> 00:15:58,908
had these gorgeous looking scenes that were

294
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:00,490
more static than we wanted.

295
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,472
And there were problems, things that

296
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:06,054
were not even obvious problems that were solved.

297
00:16:06,054 --> 00:16:08,957
But this moment, without the wake behind it,

298
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:11,419
sort of like a bobbing scene.

299
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:13,861
Suddenly, with more effect attention,

300
00:16:13,861 --> 00:16:16,163
we get something that was a complete thought.

301
00:16:16,697 --> 00:16:20,600
And so it was invaluable to be able to complete this thought

302
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,502
and also do honor to some of the original inspirations,

303
00:16:23,502 --> 00:16:26,904
which is sort of like the sublime force of nature.

304
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:29,586
So we had moments in the scene where like,

305
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:34,129
very like you're finding out intense things in the story.

306
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,350
We also don't want to fill it with words.

307
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,592
So the ability to actually fill it with things

308
00:16:38,592 --> 00:16:41,814
that looked beautiful and were evocative of the theme.

309
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:44,159
You know, it made a huge difference.

310
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,860
There are things that, you know,

311
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,562
could have been just rushed past through

312
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:51,604
that suddenly invites the players to stop and look.

313
00:16:51,604 --> 00:16:54,665
We even had small one-off moments

314
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:57,587
after being able to time,

315
00:16:57,587 --> 00:16:59,148
oh no, video, why?

316
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:01,950
The confetti comes, come on.

317
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,792
Let's see if I can't get it to work.

318
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:20,807
where visual effects have specific punctuation.

319
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,570
I have a moment.

320
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:32,696
So these were all things where we were kind of building this

321
00:17:32,696 --> 00:17:38,060
as a boulder, it was a snowball rolling downhill

322
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,423
where we were grabbing things as they became available to us

323
00:17:41,423 --> 00:17:43,044
and as they became necessary.

324
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:46,562
Without that, we had lots of hopes.

325
00:17:46,562 --> 00:17:49,805
We had lists, lists and lists and lists of hit lists

326
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:52,226
on things that we hoped to be able to build in.

327
00:17:52,226 --> 00:17:55,688
But it sort of created a meritocracy of,

328
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:57,930
or a hierarchy where the things would happen

329
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,111
as quickly as they could happen.

330
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:02,773
And if you had people that, they really cared about it.

331
00:18:02,773 --> 00:18:05,134
You know, one of the other,

332
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:10,518
one of the things that came in sort of late to the project

333
00:18:10,518 --> 00:18:11,939
is that we had hands early.

334
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:13,560
We had characters and we had locations.

335
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:18,467
But we worked with, towards the end of the project,

336
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:21,708
we worked with a character, or a illustrator, Holly Rothrock,

337
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:25,129
on giving the family faces.

338
00:18:25,129 --> 00:18:29,270
We had an original inspiration for the project for the book

339
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,370
100 Years of Solitude.

340
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,091
And part of this thing was that these family members

341
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:37,772
were such a diverse and similarly named and stretched

342
00:18:37,772 --> 00:18:39,172
out group that we had a family tree.

343
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:45,312
And some of our original desires were to keep a version of a family tree that looked like

344
00:18:45,312 --> 00:18:48,055
someone had actually drawn and maintained it.

345
00:18:48,055 --> 00:18:54,901
And this was a serious point of contention versus how plain looking could something be

346
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:57,323
and have us accept it as a final product.

347
00:18:57,323 --> 00:19:04,030
So we went back and forth on how well can Edith really draw, how much energy would she

348
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,511
have put into this moment.

349
00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:11,424
but ended up with a family tree at the end that ended up becoming a big part of the actual

350
00:19:11,424 --> 00:19:12,865
gameplay experience.

351
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:13,866
We cycled.

352
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:15,927
We made sure we visited every time.

353
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:19,049
It reinforced these connections between these people.

354
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:23,612
And then eventually, at the end of stories, we ended up being able to see these faces

355
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:24,232
in the shrines.

356
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:32,677
And so really, there's nothing more evocative of the group effort that it took to put together

357
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:33,258
this game.

358
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:36,262
come with the final product in the shrines.

359
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:38,462
It was the effort of environment artists

360
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:41,384
to make these specific, carefully crafted props

361
00:19:41,384 --> 00:19:44,665
for characters that grew over time,

362
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:49,046
originally, you know, bodiless, maybe photographs,

363
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:50,567
then they developed limbs,

364
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:54,448
then eventually bodies and painted faces,

365
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:56,569
into these moments that, you know,

366
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:59,330
it took an entire five years of development to make.

367
00:20:00,452 --> 00:20:05,258
And so basically, in summary, I've sort of,

368
00:20:05,258 --> 00:20:07,701
oh my gosh, we can't do this.

369
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:09,403
Can we?

370
00:20:09,403 --> 00:20:14,089
Ooh, sweet.

371
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,872
It stopped.

372
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:22,665
So in summary, I've sort of like walked us through all of these moments as they,

373
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:25,347
oh, as they perfectly handed off to each other.

374
00:20:25,347 --> 00:20:28,269
But honestly, there were parts of these that were tense.

375
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,189
It was difficult.

376
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:33,893
We believed in different things, and we weren't sure things were going to work out.

377
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:38,055
But in retrospect, I look at all of these choices like exactly the right choice was

378
00:20:38,055 --> 00:20:42,378
made, a very few regrets and these final decisions, and

379
00:20:42,378 --> 00:20:44,360
it comes together as a complete experience.

380
00:20:45,949 --> 00:20:54,213
So my recommendation to art directors is build in some process of not knowing and leaving

381
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:56,395
space to figure things out just in time.

382
00:20:57,004 --> 00:21:00,304
If we had pre-planned every aspect of these things,

383
00:21:00,304 --> 00:21:01,605
there are whole portions of the game

384
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:03,685
that just wouldn't exist at all.

385
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:06,366
And having that space and being comfortable with it,

386
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:09,707
and then rebuilding over and over again,

387
00:21:09,707 --> 00:21:11,727
I think we come up with some estimates.

388
00:21:11,727 --> 00:21:14,908
We probably made 2 3rds as much material.

389
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:16,928
It's like we built three times as much

390
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,009
than actually made it into the final version

391
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:22,590
because we were willing to edit and build the right thing.

392
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:22,790
And so.

393
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:30,892
And this is also maybe just my bias, but thinking about hiring people that you trust with the

394
00:21:30,892 --> 00:21:37,693
design of the final product and not necessarily just on the portfolio.

395
00:21:37,693 --> 00:21:45,215
Obviously people have to be able to make the work, but I think it's harder to teach taste

396
00:21:45,215 --> 00:21:47,415
than technique.

397
00:21:47,415 --> 00:21:49,516
So that's my talk.

398
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,676
I think I burned through it.

399
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:50,876
Thank you.

400
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:51,916
I think I burned through it.

401
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:52,196
Thank you.

402
00:21:55,778 --> 00:22:06,307
It looks like I do have plenty of time for questions, so if anybody has a question, they

403
00:22:06,307 --> 00:22:07,107
can come to the...

404
00:22:07,107 --> 00:22:07,568
Hi.

405
00:22:07,568 --> 00:22:07,648
Hi.

406
00:22:07,648 --> 00:22:09,469
Thank you for the talk.

407
00:22:09,469 --> 00:22:10,050
Thank you.

408
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:10,930
You're welcome.

409
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:15,750
First of all, by the way, guys, in order to motivate you to ask some questions, there's

410
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,131
like a dozen T-shirts there.

411
00:22:17,131 --> 00:22:20,213
So if anybody wants some swag, first 12 people get T-shirts.

412
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:24,816
But my question for Chelsea was actually, you mentioned that you did have some differences

413
00:22:24,816 --> 00:22:26,297
as you were working through this.

414
00:22:26,297 --> 00:22:30,840
And could you speak a little bit more to the process through which you resolved some of

415
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,540
these differences?

416
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,123
Because obviously a lot of passionate people there, passionate about maybe different things,

417
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:38,684
but only one can sort of survive through that process.

418
00:22:38,684 --> 00:22:39,325
So how did that go?

419
00:22:40,288 --> 00:22:44,177
I think on some, so the question was how,

420
00:22:44,177 --> 00:22:48,005
speaking more in detail about the differences of opinion.

421
00:22:48,005 --> 00:22:50,971
And I think my summary would be.

422
00:22:51,316 --> 00:22:55,337
On some levels it was a war of attrition.

423
00:22:55,337 --> 00:22:59,299
And on other levels it was just letting the ideas speak for themselves.

424
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:04,381
There was a lot of prototyping that was made with very

425
00:23:04,381 --> 00:23:07,942
disparate quality levels to try to prove out a concept.

426
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:11,903
I think I myself put together a series of technical demos.

427
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:16,445
I think one thing was on the, our original version of the tentacle

428
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:20,326
was like segmented pieces and we were debating how we were going to procedurally

429
00:23:20,326 --> 00:23:20,847
generate.

430
00:23:21,757 --> 00:23:24,138
And I was like, the artists need to have control

431
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:25,118
over the tentacle.

432
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:27,059
This has to work.

433
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:30,280
So I made this kind of horrific little demo with a capsule

434
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,641
and attaching a physics rope to it

435
00:23:31,641 --> 00:23:34,262
and just pathetically dragging it around

436
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:35,263
with the character controller.

437
00:23:35,263 --> 00:23:37,304
And I'm like, like this, but good.

438
00:23:37,304 --> 00:23:40,465
And so I went through three or four versions

439
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:43,346
and kind of built an increasingly horrifyingly

440
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:46,368
complicated contraption, but then finally convinced

441
00:23:46,368 --> 00:23:49,489
the tech director that it was a reasonable way to go.

442
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:54,868
I think at the end of the day it was reality was coming down on us.

443
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:58,809
Things either worked or they didn't, and we really listened to whether or not it was true

444
00:23:58,809 --> 00:23:59,329
to the story.

445
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:05,771
And so there were some things that we had avoided for a while that ended up being more

446
00:24:05,771 --> 00:24:06,571
necessary.

447
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:09,632
There was even a moment where the game was going to be...

448
00:24:09,632 --> 00:24:14,493
There were some moments where we weren't going to have a house at all because there wasn't

449
00:24:14,493 --> 00:24:18,354
enough time, and now you're like, oh my God, I can't believe that almost happened.

450
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:18,534
So yeah.

451
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,491
Hi, great talk.

452
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:26,455
I was just wondering, when you have mostly creative individuals

453
00:24:26,455 --> 00:24:29,517
who are more worried about creating assets and communicating

454
00:24:29,517 --> 00:24:33,461
their ideas, how did you decide producer roles?

455
00:24:33,461 --> 00:24:36,164
Who made tasks and made sure people were following through

456
00:24:36,164 --> 00:24:36,744
on those tasks?

457
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:37,185
That's good.

458
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,546
Well, that's easy.

459
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:42,430
Oh, so the question was, how did we make sure

460
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,151
that work was followed through?

461
00:24:44,812 --> 00:24:47,856
And that was pretty easy.

462
00:24:47,856 --> 00:24:53,004
The creative director, Ian, was very on the current marching orders.

463
00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:56,088
We didn't necessarily have a good sense of if everything was doable.

464
00:24:56,925 --> 00:24:58,746
But then we had area leads of the technical lead

465
00:24:58,746 --> 00:25:01,187
and the art lead that made sure

466
00:25:01,187 --> 00:25:03,688
that those subtasks were organized.

467
00:25:03,688 --> 00:25:07,349
So some indie teams have a completely flat hierarchy

468
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:09,270
that has no lead roles,

469
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,771
and that's something that I find to be difficult.

470
00:25:12,771 --> 00:25:14,952
You almost have sort of like groups of people

471
00:25:14,952 --> 00:25:19,713
that are pushing together on an effort sometimes,

472
00:25:19,713 --> 00:25:22,754
even if it is a separate prototype.

473
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,855
But yeah, we definitely were organized

474
00:25:24,855 --> 00:25:25,695
via creative direction.

475
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:31,526
I was just wondering if mechanics influenced art at all.

476
00:25:31,526 --> 00:25:34,129
There are a lot of objects of significance in the stories

477
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:35,831
and things that you interacted with.

478
00:25:35,831 --> 00:25:38,214
I'm wondering if the thing that you interacted with

479
00:25:38,214 --> 00:25:40,117
specifically was influenced by the mechanic

480
00:25:40,117 --> 00:25:41,398
that you were executing.

481
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:44,798
Oh man, that's a fantastic question.

482
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:48,639
So the question was, did mechanics affect the art

483
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:49,660
direction at all?

484
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,480
Correct?

485
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:50,760
OK.

486
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,361
They were so one in the same.

487
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:57,462
I mean, and I think one of the greatest

488
00:25:57,462 --> 00:25:59,442
strengths of our open-ended design

489
00:25:59,442 --> 00:26:02,363
is that we wanted an evocative experience,

490
00:26:02,363 --> 00:26:03,543
and each thing had a hook.

491
00:26:03,543 --> 00:26:07,504
So there was a specific request.

492
00:26:07,504 --> 00:26:09,525
There's some things I could have said but called out,

493
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:10,645
but like one of.

494
00:26:11,585 --> 00:26:17,690
creative directions ideas was the house was built in a certain timeline and then all further

495
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:24,415
updates were from items you could have purchased at Home Depot. So to not indulge in the like in

496
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:31,420
some kind of overly ornate Victorian aesthetic which also sort of extended to our story objects

497
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:36,884
where it's sort of like this should be a regular looking object. We didn't have crazy ornate keys,

498
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:37,945
we had uh it's like the

499
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:43,614
the master lock padlocks that were very simple.

500
00:26:43,614 --> 00:26:47,256
We had, I mean, each of the story objects,

501
00:26:47,256 --> 00:26:49,938
they were very difficult to build,

502
00:26:49,938 --> 00:26:53,880
and we probably built like three times as many,

503
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,821
because the idea was that experience goal,

504
00:26:55,821 --> 00:26:57,982
and we specifically, because like,

505
00:26:57,982 --> 00:27:00,564
there are games that have interaction mechanics

506
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:04,226
that are, you know, which I respect this commitment,

507
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:07,408
where you say, you can open drawers, you can open doors,

508
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:08,849
you can pick things up and spin them around.

509
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:13,918
I think the only animation that we reused in that game was the walk cycle.

510
00:27:14,928 --> 00:27:18,911
everything was bespoke, and it was that commitment to bespoke

511
00:27:18,911 --> 00:27:22,975
that was, like, to me, a part of the art direction.

512
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:27,579
I don't, like, since Blur's the lines between design and art and everything else,

513
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,541
but, you know, I think, again, if we had said at the beginning,

514
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:34,424
no art, like, no animation would be reused, I think we actually could have saved

515
00:27:34,424 --> 00:27:40,189
some time trying to, like, systematize, be like, no, just do a great job once.

516
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:45,786
because there was definitely a lot of time hoping we'd systematize things.

517
00:27:45,786 --> 00:27:49,188
It was just like commit to bespoke.

518
00:27:49,188 --> 00:27:49,388
Yeah.

519
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:58,132
One of your conclusions was building in time for not knowing and for free time.

520
00:27:58,132 --> 00:28:00,894
Did you have trouble arguing for

521
00:28:00,894 --> 00:28:05,276
doing that in terms of like finances and a timeline or was it pretty easy or

522
00:28:05,276 --> 00:28:09,679
just how did you go about arguing that that time will be worth it?

523
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,179
I think

524
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:15,468
Okay.

525
00:28:15,468 --> 00:28:21,092
Okay, I will answer the question in the wrap-up room.

526
00:28:21,092 --> 00:28:26,335
Yes.

527
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:27,235
