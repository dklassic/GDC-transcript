1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,670
It's an honor to have everyone here to listen to us.

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:12,572
And you guys are here for the nine takeaways from Duelist, from tabletop to digital game.

3
00:00:12,572 --> 00:00:18,914
And we want to share a lot of our experiences from prototyping it all the way to all the

4
00:00:18,914 --> 00:00:22,455
obstacles and challenges that we personally faced, Eric and I.

5
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:29,317
on developing this game from a tabletop prototype all the way to a digital game on Steam.

6
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:34,499
So just to kick things off, have any of you guys played Duelist?

7
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:35,339
Okay, wow.

8
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:43,682
And how many people here have a tabletop prototype that they're planning to convert or to start

9
00:00:43,682 --> 00:00:45,142
to port over to digital?

10
00:00:45,142 --> 00:00:45,342
Okay, great.

11
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:52,864
So I'm going to just start off with a little bit of background

12
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:53,225
about ourselves.

13
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:54,066
Eric can start off.

14
00:00:55,067 --> 00:01:01,669
I'm Eric, I'm the lead game designer of Duelist and I'm primarily from the tabletop space.

15
00:01:01,669 --> 00:01:06,890
I've designed board games and card games for the last 15 to 17 years.

16
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:12,092
I'm mostly known for living card games, for Fantasy Flight, I did a little work for Wizards

17
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:14,952
of the Coast on Magic and Duel Masters.

18
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:20,594
Most people know me for big box board games by this point, games like Blood Rage and XCOM.

19
00:01:21,574 --> 00:01:29,420
Chaos in the Old World. I'm a huge fan of both magic and games like Fire Emblem

20
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:35,104
and Final Fantasy Tactics which makes our meeting very serendipitous because

21
00:01:35,104 --> 00:01:36,305
it was really exciting to work on the game.

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,667
And I'm Keith Lee, I'm the CEO and Creative Director of Counterplay Games.

23
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:48,555
I was the former lead producer of Diablo 3 at Blizzard Entertainment,

24
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:53,382
and also the former lead game programmer for the Ratchet & Clank series at Insomniac Games.

25
00:01:55,288 --> 00:01:56,749
But more importantly, what's Duelists?

26
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,370
So you guys already know a little bit about Duelists,

27
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,092
but for those who haven't heard about it or played it,

28
00:02:03,092 --> 00:02:05,793
it's essentially a collectible tactics game.

29
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:09,855
And it's a way for you to assemble a small army

30
00:02:09,855 --> 00:02:14,798
or deck of cards that are actually playable on a nine by five.

31
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:22,369
grid and it's online. You play 1v1 head-to-head and it has turn-based battles on there.

32
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:29,680
Currently we're only on the PC, Mac and it's playable also on the web and we have about 250,000 matches that are played per day.

33
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:36,083
The inspiration for this game is the fact that we love Final Fantasy Tactics, we're

34
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:41,344
huge fans of Fire Emblem, but those are primarily single player experiences where they gate

35
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:45,085
you at a boss or a certain level cap before you can progress.

36
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:49,067
And our curiosity and the question that we wanted to ask was...

37
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:56,711
can we build a competitive tactics style game but still be able to make it in a very short,

38
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:59,732
to play a match in a very short reasonable time.

39
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:05,996
So our goal was to build a game that lasted 10 minutes per session or less and to still

40
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:12,739
keep the breadth of being able to still make it relatively competitive, to have a lot of

41
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:17,962
archetypes and options from aggressive to control or mid-range.

42
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:18,563
And we...

43
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:24,945
felt that using a CCG sort of model for us worked really well because it's very

44
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:29,087
hard to build a competitive game if every character that you have have sort

45
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:33,308
of different power levels or things like that so those are really great way for

46
00:03:33,308 --> 00:03:38,651
us to combine CCG elements that people are familiar with but to also have

47
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:42,712
positioning and to introduce like a lot of new concepts around that.

48
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:46,674
And so this game itself is a 9x5 grid.

49
00:03:46,674 --> 00:03:49,536
There's a bunch of minions that you can play on the board.

50
00:03:49,536 --> 00:03:52,117
There's also artifacts and spells

51
00:03:52,117 --> 00:03:54,979
that create effects on your units,

52
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:57,540
and the object of the game is for you to defeat

53
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,421
the enemy general.

54
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:00,842
And we kept the winning objective

55
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:03,243
and the condition really simple.

56
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,264
Doesn't require a lot of math or calculations

57
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:06,585
and things like that.

58
00:04:06,585 --> 00:04:08,286
And essentially, you have a hand at the bottom,

59
00:04:08,286 --> 00:04:09,826
which we call an action bar,

60
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:12,288
and you can also replace a unit every single turn.

61
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:15,976
And these are some of the cards that you can collect.

62
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:18,400
And we have 400 plus different minions

63
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,783
that you can play on the battlefield,

64
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:23,186
each with their own animations and things like that.

65
00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:25,035
The game's actually been out also.

66
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:28,697
The game's been out for a year in past open beta.

67
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:31,218
And we're working on our third expansion right now,

68
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:33,019
which will release soon.

69
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:35,380
So how did we get started, more importantly?

70
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,401
This was basically what Duelists looked

71
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:39,202
like when we first started.

72
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:45,145
And we would be testing and prototyping our units.

73
00:04:45,145 --> 00:04:48,067
And we wanted to be able to iterate

74
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:50,408
on visualization of the board state,

75
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:53,290
as well as how we can prototype as quickly as possible.

76
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,011
And we had a lot of iterations.

77
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:58,513
And one of the important things is that we tested not only

78
00:04:58,513 --> 00:05:00,355
with people who love tabletop games,

79
00:05:00,355 --> 00:05:02,636
but people who only play digital games.

80
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,738
And we also played with folks that are in the industry

81
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,940
and also people that are outside of it.

82
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,822
So in the bottom left, these are some folks from Riot Games,

83
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:12,763
Paul Sadasanti and Steven Lim.

84
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:14,565
And these guys are guys from Riot

85
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,626
that play a lot of tabletop.

86
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:19,908
And then there's other folks that have never played tabletop

87
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:21,870
and only played games on Steam.

88
00:05:23,107 --> 00:05:27,110
Now, we wanted to also have a very cheap DIY way

89
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,171
to be able to prototype.

90
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:31,073
So for the game that we wanted to build,

91
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:33,635
it was relatively simple.

92
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:36,137
We just bought a Chess X vinyl mat

93
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:39,420
that you just get off of Amazon for probably less than $30.

94
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,403
And the nice thing about those is they have a hex side

95
00:05:43,403 --> 00:05:43,984
as well as a...

96
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:50,027
square tiles. So depending on the type of game you want to make, it's really easy to prototype.

97
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:56,571
We just get a bunch of polyhedral dice and typically if you already know what type of attack

98
00:05:56,571 --> 00:06:01,814
ranges that you're going to have or hit points or HP that you're going to have for your units,

99
00:06:01,814 --> 00:06:06,597
we did like a 20 D20 dice for the hit points as a tracker and a counter

100
00:06:06,597 --> 00:06:11,220
and then we did like a D8 for like attack or anything that you want to do for defense and things like that.

101
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:18,386
We then also started to print out all the effects and spells and cards that we're going to have in the game.

102
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:24,972
And then we cut them up every day when we iterated and put them into card sleeve protectors

103
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:31,818
so that we can always put it on top of the square for the type of effects and buffs that are occurring for your units.

104
00:06:32,298 --> 00:06:37,541
And then we love to get like Pathfinder miniatures because they have a lot of unique heroes.

105
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:44,086
There's a, you can actually add a little bit of flavor into the prototype if it's a flying unit or a knight

106
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:49,289
and to kind of create a little bit of a sense or if you have a unique hero, then at least they would sort of stand out.

107
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:52,131
But then of course just to keep things relatively cheap.

108
00:06:52,603 --> 00:06:57,227
We also got like a bag of like generic fantasy miniatures that are like a bunch

109
00:06:57,227 --> 00:06:58,888
of knights and things like that.

110
00:06:58,888 --> 00:07:01,310
So they're viewed as like the pawns of like chess

111
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,232
and you can just get them really cheaply.

112
00:07:03,232 --> 00:07:05,694
So there's a lot of repetition here.

113
00:07:05,694 --> 00:07:09,697
So there's a really important design point also why I want to prototype

114
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:13,420
like this as simply and stripped down like this is that there's a bit

115
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,783
of a misconception in tabletop and digital that just

116
00:07:16,783 --> 00:07:17,103
because.

117
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:22,066
You're designing a digital game because in the digital space you can make the game really,

118
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,527
really complicated and have a lot of hidden information.

119
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,507
We found that isn't true.

120
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:29,809
We wanted the game, we wanted to make sure that the game is comprehensive even on tabletops,

121
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:35,051
that people can really, really quickly grok what the board state is without having to

122
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:40,353
rely on figuring out what is going on in the back end of the game because a lot of players

123
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:41,494
assume that that's cheating.

124
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:50,576
Yeah, and a little side tip too, we like to do a 2x6 on the square tiles because they actually fit the cards that you want to place easily.

125
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:58,724
So if you're moving your characters and units, it's easy for people to remember what tile they're on for your cards and it's really simple.

126
00:07:58,724 --> 00:08:00,285
The other important point too is that...

127
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:04,972
Although we have a lot of different types of players, you can actually have a pretty

128
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:08,695
small sample size to be able to test your prototype.

129
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:14,519
And the key thing is just making sure you can observe what they're doing and not trying

130
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,442
to bias the opinions for how they're playing.

131
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:24,098
just getting a sense of what areas that they might be confused around,

132
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:28,421
or they might be doing a certain strategy that you've never considered.

133
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:31,403
And we usually just have a logbook, so every single time we play,

134
00:08:31,403 --> 00:08:35,726
we just track what units they've been using and how they've won.

135
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:39,028
And we don't really spend too much time on asking them if they have fun or not,

136
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:43,450
because if for them, if they start to look a little distracted

137
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,791
and they're starting to lose interest,

138
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,953
we know that it's not capturing them anyway.

139
00:08:48,953 --> 00:08:53,516
And that's usually like our first sort of gut test for how things are going.

140
00:08:54,537 --> 00:09:00,401
Absolutely and also the because one of the keys to a digital game is how

141
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:04,924
smoothly it plays. One of the reasons we gave ourselves limitations of this

142
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:10,488
medium is of course we knew that we could we could fake a lot of the we

143
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:14,331
figure a lot of the user input in on the digital side. We want to make sure that

144
00:09:14,331 --> 00:09:19,555
even if we get this prototype playing fairly smoothly and fairly easily that

145
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:23,038
putting the extra polish on the digital side would be absolutely top-notch.

146
00:09:24,102 --> 00:09:25,563
Mm-hmm.

147
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:29,006
Now, before just even starting with tabletop and moving

148
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:31,508
to digital, we took a step back and started

149
00:09:31,508 --> 00:09:33,950
to think about what the strengths are of digital.

150
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,432
And I would say 20% of the time before we even

151
00:09:36,432 --> 00:09:39,314
started implementation, because it's really easy to roll up

152
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:42,357
your sleeves, get excited to start to code a couple things,

153
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:45,139
and try a couple ideas on digital,

154
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:47,001
because it's still a really fast prototype.

155
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:53,745
But we took a step back and we said, hey, what are the strengths on the tabletop side and the weaknesses?

156
00:09:53,745 --> 00:10:01,190
And what are the areas on digital that we know that we need to bolster and to continue to support that's very different from tabletop?

157
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:08,875
So the biggest salient thing on the tabletop side, of course, is that you have a very, very custom, highly social experience with friends.

158
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:20,379
And it's very easy to have games where you have secondary expressions and ways that you can bluff and to read signals because people are interacting you face to face.

159
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:29,562
And of course the challenge and the weaknesses of tabletop is the fact that it does take time to schedule. You usually need to have a champion or a leader to kind of organize things.

160
00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:34,325
generally is a larger time commitment to make sure that things work out for that week.

161
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:37,346
Now you don't have any of those problems on the strengths of digital.

162
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:41,268
You can play randos anytime, anywhere, players across the world.

163
00:10:41,268 --> 00:10:43,809
So that's a huge strength from our perspective.

164
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,950
But it's also a subtle weakness as well because

165
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:54,334
you lack that level of personal interaction with the players that you're the people that you're

166
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:59,677
playing with and of course it hides a lot of massive number crunching on the digital side so

167
00:10:59,677 --> 00:11:04,719
there's for the type of game that we built on tabletop we knew that it's going to work even

168
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:10,543
better on digital because we have lots of interactions and secondary effects that all

169
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:13,945
interact with all of the keywords that we have that

170
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:20,833
Actually, if we had now ported it back to tabletop, it would actually be very hard to have this exact duos game

171
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:28,183
Because there's so much number crunching that actually occurs on the board state, especially introducing movement and things like that

172
00:11:28,183 --> 00:11:32,768
now on the digital side the area that we wanted to focus on and to bolster is

173
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:36,932
we knew that there was going to be a lack of deeper person-to-person interaction

174
00:11:36,932 --> 00:11:40,956
and there's this sort of mindset that you're looking at a screen

175
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:47,842
you have the web that you can get onto, there's movies, there's like more distractions for you

176
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:49,823
as you are on digital. So as a result

177
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:53,106
anything that you can do where the player is

178
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:56,489
ultra engaged, never has this feeling that

179
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:57,310
they have to wait.

180
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,853
is utmost critical important versus being on a tabletop,

181
00:12:03,853 --> 00:12:05,174
you know, night situation.

182
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:09,056
Right, and also a key corollary to that is that

183
00:12:09,056 --> 00:12:11,717
in digital you lose the social contract of the table, right?

184
00:12:11,717 --> 00:12:14,078
So, I mean, we've all played digital games.

185
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:16,520
We know what the difference in politeness

186
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,261
between a tabletop game and in digital.

187
00:12:19,261 --> 00:12:21,282
So we had to make sure when we were designing the game

188
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:21,582
to make...

189
00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:25,705
In a tabletop game, you're not going to rope out every turn.

190
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:28,948
You're not going to make people, you're not going to grieve people for no reason.

191
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:33,732
You're going to play efficiently and there's a lot of unsaid communication between players,

192
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:34,773
you know, when to end the turn, etc.

193
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:38,435
In this, we had to design the game around that to make sure,

194
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:40,657
around the worst possible type of griefing player

195
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:44,600
and every possible way to make the experience bad for their opponent,

196
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,942
we had to assume that the player would.

197
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:52,090
So I would say that this is a very common graph for anyone that's going to move anything

198
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:57,592
from tabletop to digital and something just for you to consider.

199
00:12:57,592 --> 00:12:59,793
But then it opens up another question.

200
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:05,536
Is a tabletop player similar and what's the overlap to a digital persona?

201
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:11,158
Does a player that loved tabletop, will they even play Duelist if it's on digital?

202
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,059
So that's a hypothesis, that was a big question.

203
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:16,360
We didn't know that.

204
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,221
So we had to just make a couple assumptions

205
00:13:19,221 --> 00:13:22,261
and to kind of test out our hypotheses.

206
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:24,742
So our initial first most important assumption

207
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:27,503
is people don't want to play 40 minute games

208
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:30,063
and then lose and feel bad on digital.

209
00:13:30,063 --> 00:13:32,504
So we wanted to ensure that our play sessions

210
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:34,465
were less than 10 minutes.

211
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:51,375
And then the other difference is that the velocity and the frequency and the volume of games that you're going to play on digital is astronomically exponentially higher than playing a tabletop game where you might just have one game that night.

212
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:59,981
And most of the variety may not even come from the board or the game itself, but from the interactions that you have that night with the players that are playing with you.

213
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:06,004
So, from that perspective, we had to make sure that we increased the priority around

214
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:08,645
creating match variety in every single game.

215
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:14,148
So, the goal is that for every new match, you might encounter a different general, or

216
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:17,810
you might have a, you might encounter a different deck, or a different set of minions when you

217
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,951
play against other players, so that things don't feel as samey.

218
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:25,593
And this is, of course, the number one challenge for building a game like ours, is to avoid,

219
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:29,255
how to make the people who grind through 50 games a day.

220
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:35,303
to still have them enjoy themselves and for the folks who might only play a few games in a day.

221
00:14:35,303 --> 00:14:41,451
And again, the hypothesis for us is that we had to make sure that you're playing with anonymous players

222
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:44,455
and how we can alleviate any of the negatives around that.

223
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:49,802
So on the data side, we also track.

224
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:52,263
Peter Drucker has always said that what's

225
00:14:52,263 --> 00:14:54,543
measured is improved.

226
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:58,925
And so we took that hypothesis, and then we started to test it

227
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:00,485
out on the web first.

228
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:04,486
So we actually didn't push out our game on the PC at first.

229
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:08,027
We wrote our entire engine in JavaScript, and then kind of

230
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:09,848
put it out on the web.

231
00:15:09,848 --> 00:15:13,209
And the main reason why, and why people always ask us this

232
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:15,330
question, is like, why did you guys do that?

233
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,274
It's because it's very easy for us to deploy a new build,

234
00:15:19,274 --> 00:15:22,017
to change the balance of things, to push it out.

235
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:25,542
And it's very easy for a user, a new player,

236
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:29,006
to get into the game without going through a lot of hoops

237
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:31,068
and to log in and do all these type of things.

238
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:32,910
And we started a track.

239
00:15:33,897 --> 00:15:37,761
very early on what the average playtime was for the players,

240
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:39,963
what the actual match times were.

241
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:42,285
And so when we started to tune our cards,

242
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:45,028
when we started to tune all of our systems,

243
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,290
our number one goal was to make sure

244
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,153
that the match time didn't increase over 10 minutes.

245
00:15:50,153 --> 00:15:53,196
And so originally it started at around 15.

246
00:15:53,196 --> 00:15:53,977
That's right, yeah.

247
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:58,679
So once again, we haven't even started talking about the

248
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:01,140
takeaways yet, but just really wanted to set the design

249
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,422
pillars that we had started with at the prototype stage.

250
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,904
Again, to enforce a match time, upper

251
00:16:06,904 --> 00:16:08,205
bound to 10 minutes.

252
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:13,288
And that's already, we feel, at the highest for the type of

253
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:15,689
game that we have, especially if you want to potentially

254
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,770
move your game onto mobile as well.

255
00:16:18,454 --> 00:16:21,817
And then number two, we wanted to offer a wide variety of deck archetypes.

256
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:28,323
And then third, we wanted to find ways that we can build player confidence in the game

257
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:32,067
and also to allow them to see that they're improving in terms of their skill level.

258
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:40,328
And then lastly, we also started to predict and started to think about how we also wanted

259
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:42,109
to build our ranked player distribution.

260
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:47,513
So early on, we knew that it wasn't going to be a Gaussian normal distribution bell

261
00:16:47,513 --> 00:16:48,454
curve.

262
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:54,178
We instead knew that we wanted to skew the curve towards time served and the amount of

263
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:58,021
time that you were playing and skew it slightly towards like a lower level.

264
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:03,685
So this is actually the results of where our ladder stands in the last few months.

265
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:09,647
And you'll notice that the distribution of these five different divisions,

266
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:13,168
and just to give you guys a little background if you guys haven't played Ranked,

267
00:17:13,168 --> 00:17:16,629
is that every month it resets, and as you continue to play,

268
00:17:16,629 --> 00:17:20,010
you will progress up the ladder if you win,

269
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,171
but at the lower levels you just have to play to be able to go up.

270
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:27,572
And then we actually have a floor on every single division.

271
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:31,953
So what this does is alleviate sort of laddering stress.

272
00:17:32,454 --> 00:17:35,876
because once you hit a certain division you can start to experiment a bit

273
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:38,278
and play around with different decks that you do

274
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:43,902
try out without losing rank. So this is the distribution we share this with our

275
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:47,825
community because a lot of times people think,

276
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:52,048
hey I'm not doing well in this game because I'm not

277
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:53,950
silver or or gold or

278
00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:02,058
or even Diamond or S-Rank, but being able to show this to the community also helps people

279
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:08,984
realize that it's not just about being in bronze because a lot of people spend literally hundreds

280
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:12,688
of hours playing our game and playing like 100 matches a day to get to S-Rank.

281
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:17,369
All right, so we're going to start with the first takeaway

282
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:18,451
that we learned with Dualist.

283
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:22,515
And the first one that is different from tabletop is we

284
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:25,599
focused a lot on real-time interactivity.

285
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,441
So what we mean by that is.

286
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,082
Everything that we did in the game, when it's your opponent's turn,

287
00:18:31,082 --> 00:18:35,845
everything from mouse movements to what they hover over, to what they're looking at,

288
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:41,208
to them dragging a card to display what they're doing, is all done in real time.

289
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:46,151
So we have a real-time system to track everything and you can actually see what your opponent is

290
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:51,375
doing. So that way you still have this feeling that you're playing against a real human opponent,

291
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:55,757
that they're looking at things and doing stuff, rather than, you know, waiting for like...

292
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,051
a minute or 90 seconds and there's like nothing happening on the screen and

293
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:03,073
you're just off to get a coffee or something. So we want people to still feel like

294
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:04,233
they're engaged

295
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:07,835
on the opposite end's turn. And on a deeper level actually,

296
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:10,416
this is one of the, I'm a hardcore CCG player and

297
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,437
one of the things I wanted to make sure that we did here was that...

298
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:17,238
In tabletop games, you can read cues,

299
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:19,218
especially when you're bluffing any game

300
00:19:19,218 --> 00:19:20,419
with hidden information like we have.

301
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:23,579
You can read cues from players from body language,

302
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,780
watching what they're looking at,

303
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,860
and you can also double bluff people

304
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,661
by giving off false tells.

305
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:31,701
In this game, if you're high level

306
00:19:31,701 --> 00:19:33,862
and you're familiar with the cards,

307
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:35,782
you can actually watch what people,

308
00:19:35,782 --> 00:19:37,102
you can watch what people are looking at,

309
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:38,643
you can watch how long it takes somebody

310
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:39,983
to play a card at a particular time,

311
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:41,203
you can watch what they're,

312
00:19:41,784 --> 00:19:45,926
what they're pointing out, what they're not, to see and start to formulate some

313
00:19:45,926 --> 00:19:49,428
hypothesis. And it gives you, it's inches, gives you a tiny little incremental

314
00:19:49,428 --> 00:19:53,450
advantage, but that's important in games like this where you're improving tiny

315
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,571
tiny percentages at a time.

316
00:19:56,057 --> 00:20:23,458
So the high level idea for anything outside of even the real time inactivity to some reason just to think about ways that you can gauge your player when they're not actively doing something in the game and they're just like waiting or pausing so here's actually a video just to show you of the enemy's turn here so on the left side would be me let's say and your opponent now is actually hovering looking over some units hot looking at

317
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:26,880
at these two units that you have and they're going to deploy things.

318
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,142
So this is all done in real time, a real time system in the back end

319
00:20:29,142 --> 00:20:33,946
to better track this and to track all your mouse movements and everything like that.

320
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:36,468
And he's animated right now, which means he's in the middle of,

321
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:40,551
he was clicking on a card in his hand and looking at and thinking about playing it.

322
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:44,860
Yeah, and of course, this is an example also of,

323
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,222
besides just doing mouse interactions,

324
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:50,144
you can also do emotes and other like soft ways

325
00:20:50,144 --> 00:20:52,545
to communicate with each other,

326
00:20:52,545 --> 00:20:54,627
so that you feel that there is another person

327
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:56,208
that you're playing with,

328
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,030
but still in a kind of controlled way.

329
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:06,653
So just to kind of dig a little deeper, we also offer a restricted level of player-to-player interaction.

330
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:08,414
So as you've seen, emotes.

331
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:14,477
And the cool thing is that once you start playing a lot of Duelist, it becomes like an expressive language.

332
00:21:14,477 --> 00:21:19,199
There's like a language in itself for how people start to communicate with each other in the game

333
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:23,561
based on the dozens and dozens of emotes that we sort of have.

334
00:21:24,142 --> 00:21:27,466
and that's like kind of a cool language that people start to learn.

335
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:31,270
We have a buddy list where if you add and mutually agree to add with each other

336
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,712
you can now start to chat

337
00:21:32,712 --> 00:21:35,815
and we also have replay sharing within the buddy list.

338
00:21:35,815 --> 00:21:40,661
So I can actually share a replay that I've just done to show off

339
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:42,983
like a really cool lethal that I did.

340
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:51,329
And we also, outside of the game itself, we have on our main menu a watch section.

341
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:57,814
So the idea here is that if you're not playing a game, you can actually go into any division ladder

342
00:21:57,814 --> 00:22:00,896
and start to see some of the more interesting, popular games.

343
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:04,799
And we have an algorithm for pushing out kind of unique sort of a...

344
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,741
games that are happening, you can watch on any side and then you can sort of see what people

345
00:22:09,741 --> 00:22:14,384
are doing. So this is a fun way for players to just relax, kind of watch what people are doing,

346
00:22:14,384 --> 00:22:20,647
learn some new strategies, or kind of see like what other people are doing in a very safe kind

347
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:26,209
of environment, especially if people are just starting to learn to ladder and jump into the

348
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:32,292
game. And of course we also have a spectate mode, so you can hop into any sort of a Twitch featured

349
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:33,153
person that we have.

350
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:39,276
And one of the things that we did, we actually integrated Twitch into our PC game.

351
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:44,718
So we highlight Twitch streamers that are playing Duelist and it's a benefit for them

352
00:22:44,718 --> 00:22:49,320
because they get players that are just hopping in and we also let them to jump right into

353
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,701
Twitch and watch it.

354
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:54,943
And of course you can actually spectate your friends and this is actually really important

355
00:22:54,943 --> 00:22:55,423
anyway.

356
00:22:55,724 --> 00:23:00,045
because it's a requirement if you plan to do competitive tournaments

357
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,507
and to be able to have a spectating sort of system

358
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:07,529
so that tournament organizers can start to display

359
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:09,390
different sides and things like that.

360
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,621
So this is a real-time interactivity.

361
00:23:12,621 --> 00:23:13,802
These are some of the emotes.

362
00:23:13,802 --> 00:23:15,523
We spent a long time on these, by the way.

363
00:23:15,523 --> 00:23:18,985
I think we must have spent at least a week in just design

364
00:23:18,985 --> 00:23:21,847
to figure out, because we didn't have infinite emotes.

365
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:24,368
And I remember the key discussion we had.

366
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:26,849
We wanted to make sure that the language was 100% emergent.

367
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:30,011
So we wanted to pick some of the most common expressions

368
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:33,053
that people would use that didn't necessarily

369
00:23:33,053 --> 00:23:35,994
point to an exact word or an exact adjective.

370
00:23:36,635 --> 00:23:42,837
and allow people to use them individually or in strings in succession to communicate with each other.

371
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:45,237
And the meaning behind it, like, as you...

372
00:23:45,237 --> 00:23:49,878
It created a really cool secondary talking point across the Internet,

373
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:52,539
across our forums and Reddit and stuff. It was pretty cool.

374
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:55,800
I am still on takeaway number one.

375
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,401
So, the other thing, too, is...

376
00:23:59,158 --> 00:24:02,160
It's really important is, again, people are impatient,

377
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,301
people don't want to wait.

378
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:06,904
So anything you can do to shorten the matchmaking queue

379
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:10,186
times, ultimately if you can do it in less than 20 seconds,

380
00:24:10,186 --> 00:24:12,928
especially on the lower ranks, is pretty critical.

381
00:24:12,928 --> 00:24:15,990
So I played a lot of Warcraft III.

382
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,351
Shows kind of like my age on this,

383
00:24:17,351 --> 00:24:19,733
but tons of Warcraft III and you have the Roving Eye.

384
00:24:20,673 --> 00:24:25,215
and you have like a sort of a timer that displays like how long you've been waiting,

385
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:30,277
those all help because anything where it looks like the screen just froze

386
00:24:30,277 --> 00:24:33,538
and you don't have anything to show will concern people.

387
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:37,899
So we always have like a timer that displays and there's some level of interaction.

388
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:41,180
People really, like you know that you're in a matchmaking queue

389
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,081
and we really try to make sure that we can get below 20 seconds.

390
00:24:44,081 --> 00:24:47,503
And sometimes that means that early on.

391
00:24:48,143 --> 00:24:51,524
when you're first like pushing out your game on digital you may not have a lot

392
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:56,425
of players jumping in right away and so it's it's very like all your fans

393
00:24:56,425 --> 00:25:01,267
again I always ask to add like all these different modes that they want and we

394
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:04,428
all want to do that that's like the things that we love doing we want to

395
00:25:04,428 --> 00:25:08,909
have rainbow mode we want to have casual and all these other things but to have

396
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:10,190
that you need to have.

397
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:16,732
literally 200,000, 300,000 matches happening a day before you can even get close to hitting

398
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:23,175
like a less than 20 second interval time. So for us we started very simply with a ranked ladder

399
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:29,217
and then also we had a draft mode which we called the gauntlet. So we didn't release casual mode at

400
00:25:29,217 --> 00:25:30,178
the start.

401
00:25:30,318 --> 00:25:35,120
And I can talk a little bit more about casual later and only now for the next

402
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,203
expansion that's coming in a few weeks are we adding this rainbow mode system

403
00:25:40,203 --> 00:25:43,805
where you can actually mix and match every single card from every faction for

404
00:25:43,805 --> 00:25:47,107
the first time so that's going to be a lot of fun for people we hope those you

405
00:25:47,107 --> 00:25:52,890
guys who play it's going to it's even more fun than you think it is.

406
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:55,621
So, starting with take away number two.

407
00:25:55,621 --> 00:26:03,069
So, one thing we learned is that you're really only as good as your matchmaking systems.

408
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:09,816
So, on a high level, how we kind of built our algorithm was we thought of a bunch of different metrics that we wanted to track.

409
00:26:10,324 --> 00:26:12,085
and then we put a weighted parameter

410
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:13,506
on each of these metrics.

411
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:15,546
And then later on, once we did that,

412
00:26:15,546 --> 00:26:18,208
we reduced it into a normalized range

413
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,708
and created a rating score.

414
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:22,229
And then that way, it was very easy for us to compare

415
00:26:22,229 --> 00:26:24,630
in real time how to match make different people.

416
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,132
So some of the metrics that we used

417
00:26:27,132 --> 00:26:29,533
or the most salient ones is rank radius.

418
00:26:29,533 --> 00:26:32,434
So what we mean by that is we would start out

419
00:26:32,434 --> 00:26:35,035
matching people that are both rank 24, let's say.

420
00:26:35,035 --> 00:26:37,756
And if that didn't coincide,

421
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:40,857
then we would actually expand the radius on that.

422
00:26:40,857 --> 00:26:43,578
So you would start to match someone that's 23 and 24,

423
00:26:43,578 --> 00:26:46,359
and we would start to expand that out.

424
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:48,780
And that would actually have its own metric

425
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,881
that would get normalized into a weighted system.

426
00:26:51,881 --> 00:26:52,982
We also have a time serve.

427
00:26:52,982 --> 00:26:54,782
So what we mean by that is that we look at

428
00:26:54,782 --> 00:26:58,003
every player's profile, and we look at how much time

429
00:26:58,003 --> 00:27:01,064
they've actually invested into Duelist.

430
00:27:01,064 --> 00:27:05,446
And we also track as a proxy, it's a high correlation.

431
00:27:05,446 --> 00:27:06,906
We also look at their win counts.

432
00:27:07,427 --> 00:27:09,829
and how well they've sort of performed internally.

433
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:13,873
And then we give priority to people who've been waiting

434
00:27:13,873 --> 00:27:15,855
for longer amount of time.

435
00:27:15,855 --> 00:27:18,838
So then we start to actually expand that,

436
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:21,821
put a higher weight on this, and that's the Q wait time.

437
00:27:21,821 --> 00:27:23,543
So we feel like people have been waiting

438
00:27:23,543 --> 00:27:24,724
for more than 20 seconds.

439
00:27:24,724 --> 00:27:27,546
We'll actually give in and.

440
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:32,195
make sure that they can jump onto a game, even if it's not the ideal match.

441
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:35,716
And the number one thing that we wanted to avoid at all costs,

442
00:27:35,716 --> 00:27:40,937
and people have different opinions on this, so other people are totally fine not putting this into the system,

443
00:27:40,937 --> 00:27:46,318
but for us, we felt that it never felt good to be able to fight another,

444
00:27:46,318 --> 00:27:51,839
to play the same player again on the next matchmaking, when you're matched,

445
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:52,620
because...

446
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,743
the loser is going to feel super frustrated, because

447
00:27:55,743 --> 00:27:57,685
they're going to ask, why am I getting matched up with the

448
00:27:57,685 --> 00:27:59,386
same guy that just beat me?

449
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:03,530
So I think that we view as a bad thing.

450
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:08,155
And then more recently, we started to think about, once

451
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:10,317
you get to over 200,000 to 300,000 matches a day, you can

452
00:28:10,317 --> 00:28:14,722
start to do this thing called cohort-based matchmaking.

453
00:28:14,722 --> 00:28:16,543
So what we can now do is take.

454
00:28:17,264 --> 00:28:23,206
a tranche of players that came in in a certain season as a cohort and then match them all

455
00:28:23,206 --> 00:28:23,926
together.

456
00:28:23,926 --> 00:28:30,307
So what this helps us do is it actually is a way to alleviate, it actually solves all

457
00:28:30,307 --> 00:28:33,348
of these sort of problems because it's almost like everyone's in the same generation or

458
00:28:33,348 --> 00:28:38,149
wave or class and they're all starting to learn and kind of grow their decks and it

459
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,870
solves a lot of the kind of issues for us.

460
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:45,591
So a core base thing is something new that we started to implement that has worked nicely

461
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:45,851
for us.

462
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:49,393
It's also a really good problem also with the we're talking about with the

463
00:28:49,393 --> 00:28:52,536
deck size and collection right one of the invisible issues with a lot of

464
00:28:52,536 --> 00:28:55,958
matchmaking games is especially with people with asymmetric

465
00:28:55,958 --> 00:29:02,463
power levels is the new player power doesn't necessarily equal

466
00:29:02,463 --> 00:29:05,505
rarity in this game but it can feel like that to some players somebody doesn't

467
00:29:05,505 --> 00:29:09,548
want to come up against somebody at the same rank that has like 50

468
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:13,671
legendary cards in their deck so this helps

469
00:29:13,671 --> 00:29:15,252
almost by itself alleviate that

470
00:29:18,197 --> 00:29:21,498
Now, again, Peter Drucker said, what gets measured

471
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:22,299
gets improved.

472
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:25,000
So specifically around matchmaking, we also built a

473
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,222
system where we actually graded ourselves at any moment

474
00:29:29,222 --> 00:29:32,243
in time as a snapshot throughout the day.

475
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:37,126
And we had a rating system based on those parameters.

476
00:29:37,126 --> 00:29:40,167
A 1.0 perfect, 0.75, 0.5, and 0 would be, for example, the

477
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:42,568
same player played twice in a row.

478
00:29:42,568 --> 00:29:47,451
And the important thing with this metric is that we did

479
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:52,954
a system for every single division. So you need to have a granular enough matchmaking system

480
00:29:52,954 --> 00:29:57,336
to be able to track your performance across every division because in some cases

481
00:29:57,336 --> 00:30:04,899
your bronze matchmaking might be at close to 1.0 but then something's happening on silver and gold

482
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:10,082
and those matches aren't really working. So here's an example. So we actually have a real-time

483
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:12,703
graph that all of us have on the screen.

484
00:30:13,284 --> 00:30:16,471
at our office to be able to track matchmaking quality.

485
00:30:16,471 --> 00:30:19,758
So at any moment in time during the day, we can see.

486
00:30:20,341 --> 00:30:22,823
how things are performing, if things are above,

487
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:27,526
at what division these numbers are hitting a good number.

488
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:30,609
So if it's over 0.5, I think we're relatively happy.

489
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:32,150
And the nice thing with this too is that

490
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:35,012
if we put in a balance change or we tune something,

491
00:30:35,012 --> 00:30:38,274
we can already, or we change like how our algorithm does

492
00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:40,656
stuff for the matchmaking, this helps a lot.

493
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:43,758
This doesn't ever explain why.

494
00:30:43,938 --> 00:30:47,020
your matchmaking is going down, but at least it's a good early indicator

495
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,502
that something is wrong and that you can actually think about how to solve it.

496
00:30:50,502 --> 00:30:52,584
So we don't have this.

497
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:56,146
You're just guessing at that point if matchmaking is good,

498
00:30:56,146 --> 00:31:00,748
because hearing stuff from the community is always helpful.

499
00:31:00,748 --> 00:31:03,030
But at the same time, you're going to get so much noise

500
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,990
coming in from the community.

501
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,512
People always complain that your matchmaking sucks.

502
00:31:06,512 --> 00:31:10,014
So you need to have your own system to be able to at least have a way to measure.

503
00:31:10,214 --> 00:31:14,895
that yourself and internally understand how you can improve that.

504
00:31:14,895 --> 00:31:20,157
Sometimes people actually wonder when we're doing balance changes and tweaks,

505
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:26,078
why we'll address a particular issue that wasn't necessarily called out by the community.

506
00:31:26,078 --> 00:31:29,119
It's usually because we have, this is one of our starting points,

507
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,920
and if it does hurt matchmaking at some level,

508
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,661
we've considered that as important as any other balance metric.

509
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:45,404
So the third takeaway that we thought about was realizing how

510
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:48,828
can we extract fun and progression for people that

511
00:31:48,828 --> 00:31:50,550
are still losing matches.

512
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:53,633
So no matter what, it's a zero-sum game.

513
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:54,975
Someone's going to lose.

514
00:31:54,975 --> 00:31:57,958
And we offer the most fun for people that

515
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:00,240
continue to lose matches.

516
00:32:01,145 --> 00:32:05,326
One of the differences with tabletop is you can walk away

517
00:32:05,326 --> 00:32:07,127
finishing that night, ending a session.

518
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:10,328
And even if you lose, you still had some fun in some way

519
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,069
because you're interacting with your friends.

520
00:32:12,069 --> 00:32:14,309
You had some sort of social capital.

521
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:18,691
So what we did on the quest side is to think about how we

522
00:32:18,691 --> 00:32:21,892
can offer play quests that you can complete and get.

523
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:25,594
rewards for that, and also win-based quests.

524
00:32:25,594 --> 00:32:27,836
So there's a delicate balance, because again,

525
00:32:27,836 --> 00:32:31,438
if you only do play-style quests

526
00:32:31,438 --> 00:32:33,439
to accomplish your quest in the game,

527
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:36,281
you're gonna have a lot of people starting to concede

528
00:32:36,281 --> 00:32:37,522
in your matches for PvP,

529
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:42,485
and so you'll have to always develop a system for penalties

530
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:47,028
and an algorithm for detecting when a player is conceding.

531
00:32:47,028 --> 00:32:49,310
And that's one of the things that you have to...

532
00:32:50,882 --> 00:32:53,526
twist a lot and change a lot because you can't ever let anyone know

533
00:32:53,526 --> 00:32:58,793
how you're detecting that people are conceding.

534
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:03,560
One week we might track how many turns that they're playing before they start to exit.

535
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,103
So we always change how we detect the conceding algorithm.

536
00:33:06,664 --> 00:33:11,265
And it's a lot of work, but if you do want to avoid

537
00:33:11,265 --> 00:33:14,465
the exploit of players constantly conceding,

538
00:33:14,465 --> 00:33:15,986
that's something that has to get built,

539
00:33:15,986 --> 00:33:18,086
and a lot of people don't think about that.

540
00:33:18,086 --> 00:33:21,027
And it's just one factor to think about

541
00:33:21,027 --> 00:33:23,207
as you develop your game for digital

542
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:26,268
that isn't something that's common on tabletop.

543
00:33:26,268 --> 00:33:27,868
And then faction progression.

544
00:33:27,868 --> 00:33:30,869
So the idea for us is for every faction,

545
00:33:30,869 --> 00:33:33,890
we don't just give you a big starter bundle

546
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:34,930
with like 30 to 50 cards,

547
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,210
and you get overwhelmed with like.

548
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:41,736
how to even start. So we always have a couple marquee cards so that you continue to play

549
00:33:41,736 --> 00:33:46,360
your faction, you start to get introduced to new cards and we make them really clear

550
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:54,048
with a single ability, very few words on the card text and typically it's very obvious

551
00:33:54,048 --> 00:33:59,474
to the player that this card has a win condition, that this is something I can use to start

552
00:33:59,474 --> 00:34:00,314
playing and to win.

553
00:34:00,855 --> 00:34:04,697
So that's, from our perspective, what we kind of built.

554
00:34:04,697 --> 00:34:08,359
And this progression allows people to feel that they're learning the game,

555
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:13,122
that they can sort of win in the lower ranks, that they can play well on practice,

556
00:34:13,122 --> 00:34:16,064
and also have this feeling of getting more cool new cards

557
00:34:16,064 --> 00:34:19,646
and getting excited about how they can change different cards

558
00:34:19,646 --> 00:34:22,848
and start to develop and master their deck or their faction.

559
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:26,070
And what we also do, too, is that if you start to lose a lot of games,

560
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:29,493
we actually have achievements and things like that where...

561
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:33,760
at certain specific points of play behavior,

562
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,602
we'll give you orbs because we want to make sure that

563
00:34:36,602 --> 00:34:41,686
the people who aren't succeeding in the game can still have ways for them to

564
00:34:41,686 --> 00:34:45,868
find, get new cards and still feel like they can progress

565
00:34:45,868 --> 00:34:49,411
even if they're losing a certain number of games. So that's a really

566
00:34:49,411 --> 00:34:51,132
good way to kind of bolster

567
00:34:51,732 --> 00:34:57,077
that format. Just to be clear for those who don't play, orbs are the

568
00:34:57,077 --> 00:34:59,279
packs that contain new cards.

569
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:03,983
I remember we tuned that a couple times, and how many games it would take

570
00:35:03,983 --> 00:35:08,907
to lose to get to pick one up. Yeah, because again, people will concede and try to get those orbs

571
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:12,090
and that's a natural thing, but that's okay. That's a natural thing, so

572
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,931
it's a balance on what you're going to do.

573
00:35:14,232 --> 00:35:22,897
So here are just some examples where we front load a lot of the rewards for players that may not be winning or they're not grinding 50 games a day.

574
00:35:22,897 --> 00:35:27,640
So we'll have win a practice game which is relatively easy because you're playing against an AI.

575
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,821
So that's a win condition game.

576
00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:34,784
But then we have a welcome back quest where people feel like they can still play a few games and get some gold.

577
00:35:35,204 --> 00:35:39,631
early on and kind of warm up if they haven't played Duelist in a while.

578
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:42,936
We also have a first win of the day to motivate people to just keep playing

579
00:35:42,936 --> 00:35:46,180
until they can win their first game and to build that sort of confidence and

580
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:50,246
still front load some gold. And then we also still have like you

581
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:51,909
know typical play quests.

582
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:53,950
I was just going to talk about that for a real quick sec.

583
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:58,591
There was a real delicate balance between how we chose

584
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:02,473
what quests were win quests and what quests were play quests.

585
00:36:02,473 --> 00:36:03,713
For the most part, we wanted people,

586
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:05,534
when you log into the game, especially if you're

587
00:36:05,534 --> 00:36:06,854
a new player, you log in.

588
00:36:06,854 --> 00:36:08,115
And this is inviting.

589
00:36:08,115 --> 00:36:10,596
This tells you, oh, you just need to play x number of games.

590
00:36:10,596 --> 00:36:12,396
The first one of the day was actually hidden.

591
00:36:12,396 --> 00:36:13,297
We didn't show that.

592
00:36:14,823 --> 00:36:18,065
We showed in anywhere on the hud but of course the first time you win a game

593
00:36:18,065 --> 00:36:21,547
you're like oh I win first one of the day which does motivate you to win. We

594
00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:24,768
didn't only want players to just fit to make it feel like a Facebook game you

595
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:29,591
just log in and play we want them to feel driven to win so you can you will

596
00:36:29,591 --> 00:36:34,133
get something even if you lose over and over again but the first time

597
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:38,275
you win you'll feel you will get that you'll get that adrenaline rush and get

598
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:39,396
your cool packs.

599
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:52,516
Yeah and you can talk a little bit more about in match stuff to write so that we're talking about before the extracting fun from losses was in the other was in the the the metagame right in the game itself.

600
00:36:52,516 --> 00:36:59,538
We want to make sure it does is this very it's a high skill game that ties the higher skill than some of our competitors are but.

601
00:36:59,979 --> 00:37:01,361
which is daunting, right?

602
00:37:01,361 --> 00:37:04,865
Sometimes people are going to lose by not know why.

603
00:37:04,865 --> 00:37:08,590
So we put a lot of subtle elements to the design,

604
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,734
which is taken from my trading card game background.

605
00:37:11,734 --> 00:37:14,418
So in a match, we put, we built the game around milestones.

606
00:37:14,418 --> 00:37:16,721
So even though there's one clear winner, one clear loser,

607
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:18,003
we wanted to make sure that there were.

608
00:37:18,123 --> 00:37:22,467
There were things that people could accomplish inside a match, whether or not they won or lost.

609
00:37:22,467 --> 00:37:27,852
So most of the game, for those of you who play, of course, many of the cards are very combo-oriented.

610
00:37:27,852 --> 00:37:35,038
They're simple, but there's some clear synergies in cards, and there's some subtle synergies in other cards.

611
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:40,903
The game is highly consistent, so if you're playing the Vitruvian faction,

612
00:37:40,903 --> 00:37:48,529
you want to build the deck that lets you build lots of obelisks and generate tons of little guys,

613
00:37:48,529 --> 00:37:52,733
you might lose, but at least you've got the cool feeling of having built that board state.

614
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:58,397
the and learning moments of course the game is relatively high skill and highly

615
00:37:58,397 --> 00:38:01,739
interactive there a lot of the positioning on the board means the

616
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:05,522
cards have different value based on where they are in relation to your

617
00:38:05,522 --> 00:38:10,966
opponents pieces so even if you you the take away you'll get from a game very

618
00:38:10,966 --> 00:38:16,630
often is the very clear like off I only a plates only play by minion behind my

619
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,752
general instead of in front of the general I actually would have won

620
00:38:19,752 --> 00:38:21,693
because you would have been able to talk by X.

621
00:38:22,713 --> 00:38:27,397
So that was, none of these are explicitly out there,

622
00:38:27,397 --> 00:38:29,539
but people do get, they will get the feeling,

623
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:31,601
they will learn quickly from game to game.

624
00:38:31,913 --> 00:38:37,294
We also push really hard for being able to have replays very early on in our game cycle.

625
00:38:37,294 --> 00:38:46,036
So as a player, you can just hop into your profile and look at an entire history of the last set of games that you've played.

626
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:55,759
And you can start to watch and kind of see like what you potentially did and observe how you've performed and see if there's potentially like a few mistakes that you had made and how.

627
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,744
For example, you might have lost lethal or things like that.

628
00:38:59,744 --> 00:39:03,788
So I feel that it's a evergreen learning platform

629
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:06,431
to have replays in the game.

630
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:08,814
And although it took a lot of time for us to build,

631
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:10,616
because you want to fast forward and scrub

632
00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:12,418
and do a lot of different things like that,

633
00:39:12,418 --> 00:39:16,622
it's worthwhile because people will go back into the game

634
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:18,724
and be able to learn from their mistakes, which.

635
00:39:19,165 --> 00:39:23,586
For a game like ours, it's challenging because sometimes you just don't know why you lost.

636
00:39:23,586 --> 00:39:27,628
And that's the hardest part of trying to explain things in our game is

637
00:39:27,628 --> 00:39:32,669
you may not know because something you could have done might have been even like two turns before.

638
00:39:32,669 --> 00:39:35,210
So this is like a thing to kind of alleviate that too.

639
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,754
So, takeaway number four is to...

640
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:42,716
We focus on a lot of systems, too,

641
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:44,437
that can encourage positive behavior.

642
00:39:44,437 --> 00:39:47,781
So we had this idea of player gifting.

643
00:39:47,781 --> 00:39:49,483
So, of course, that's more standard

644
00:39:49,483 --> 00:39:51,284
with a lot of other games.

645
00:39:51,284 --> 00:39:52,506
But we really wanted to make sure

646
00:39:52,506 --> 00:39:55,589
that the rewards that you're giving to your friend...

647
00:39:56,069 --> 00:39:58,992
was pretty significant and very high.

648
00:39:58,992 --> 00:40:01,514
And you can still rate limit that.

649
00:40:01,514 --> 00:40:05,297
So if that's an issue, you can always rate limit it in some way,

650
00:40:05,297 --> 00:40:09,721
but you really feel like the recipient is getting a really good reward from that.

651
00:40:09,721 --> 00:40:11,443
And I think that's really important.

652
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:16,467
And also we had a kind of an interesting system that we haven't seen in other games really,

653
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:18,609
where the winners can also tip.

654
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:22,974
their opponent after the game.

655
00:40:22,974 --> 00:40:28,682
And the idea for us of doing that was we felt that let's try to distribute

656
00:40:28,682 --> 00:40:32,527
gold and currency as far across the ecosystem

657
00:40:32,527 --> 00:40:34,490
and people actually really like tipping.

658
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:40,814
and kind of as a way to kind of help another person that may not have some of the cards or things like that.

659
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:48,399
We also had a top 50 tipping leaderboard so that people had an alternative vector to progress in the game

660
00:40:48,399 --> 00:40:55,283
just by tipping some of their other opponents rather than trying to gruel through necessary like S rank and things like that.

661
00:40:55,283 --> 00:41:00,246
And then we would display that on Twitter or like our Facebook and things like that.

662
00:41:00,246 --> 00:41:03,828
And we also send them custom physical rewards that are unique.

663
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:06,655
from in-game rewards, so we actually mail them.

664
00:41:07,213 --> 00:41:11,456
to some of the winners and things like that as a cool little prize.

665
00:41:11,456 --> 00:41:15,798
It was actually, besides the tipping leaderboard being super cool,

666
00:41:15,798 --> 00:41:20,740
it was also important that we made sure that we never made any explicit reason for tipping.

667
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,362
It was entirely up to the players why you would tip,

668
00:41:23,362 --> 00:41:28,184
so that they would make their decisions based on social norms rather than anything else,

669
00:41:28,184 --> 00:41:30,385
rather than something they would try to exploit.

670
00:41:30,385 --> 00:41:33,807
That's very important. It actually dates back, that's a tabletop style mechanic.

671
00:41:33,807 --> 00:41:34,667
If any of you guys...

672
00:41:35,388 --> 00:41:37,772
played old games, workshop games back in the day,

673
00:41:37,772 --> 00:41:40,076
Warhammer and stuff, they had a sportsmanship award

674
00:41:40,076 --> 00:41:43,602
that was awarded by the group,

675
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:45,204
by the players of the tournament,

676
00:41:45,204 --> 00:41:47,608
to the player who made the game most fun for their opponent.

677
00:41:52,054 --> 00:41:55,496
So from a design and systems perspective,

678
00:41:55,496 --> 00:41:58,539
when we're building Duelist, it's

679
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:02,102
really easy to start to look at achievement systems, and then

680
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,925
faction progression systems, and the first time user experience,

681
00:42:05,925 --> 00:42:07,526
and think about, OK, we're starting

682
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:11,209
to see an issue with how our players' behavior is operating.

683
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:14,572
So let's try to add this quest in here to fix things,

684
00:42:14,572 --> 00:42:15,273
and stuff like that.

685
00:42:15,273 --> 00:42:16,273
And that's going to be.

686
00:42:17,553 --> 00:42:21,794
a problem because you're going to start to have these kitchen sink sort of systems that

687
00:42:21,794 --> 00:42:25,835
don't really solve anything at all and they're trying to plug like little holes that are

688
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:26,495
starting to appear.

689
00:42:26,495 --> 00:42:30,636
And then the problem later too is that some of your later designers or people that started

690
00:42:30,636 --> 00:42:34,918
to join your team have no understanding like why you built this particular system and what

691
00:42:34,918 --> 00:42:37,618
problem it was even trying to solve in the first place.

692
00:42:37,618 --> 00:42:39,939
So for all of the system that we develop.

693
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:46,745
we very clearly delineate what the goal of that particular system is trying to achieve on the game design side.

694
00:42:46,745 --> 00:42:50,749
And if it does not fit that goal for anything we want to plug in,

695
00:42:50,749 --> 00:42:57,395
we decide whether to remove a system or to develop another system that accomplishes that goal,

696
00:42:57,395 --> 00:43:00,358
rather than trying to mix too much stuff into a single system.

697
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:03,701
So for example, achievements were very different from...

698
00:43:04,697 --> 00:43:11,642
other systems like quests because the purpose of achievements was to give you a ding and like an

699
00:43:11,642 --> 00:43:17,966
achievement at a very specific point that we're tracking to reinforce a particular play pattern.

700
00:43:17,966 --> 00:43:21,648
So for example if you're losing a lot in a row we actually give you

701
00:43:21,648 --> 00:43:25,450
a particular reward the first time you ever disenchant a card.

702
00:43:26,817 --> 00:43:32,808
You get an achievement and also it gives you enough spirit to be able to then craft a new card.

703
00:43:32,808 --> 00:43:37,816
So we're reinforcing that you can now actually build something from something you disenchanted

704
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:40,721
rather than just getting all the spirit and not knowing what to do with it.

705
00:43:41,434 --> 00:43:57,875
The first time user experience, the FTUE, we made sure that we didn't really focus too much on the meta systems and how those work, but the goal of the first time user experience was just to focus on the in-match gameplay and the sort of dynamics of how you're playing day to day, like in practice.

706
00:43:58,415 --> 00:44:04,018
And then faction progression, again, is to solve the issue that we want to do around starter bundles and packs

707
00:44:04,018 --> 00:44:14,664
and how we can slowly teach the player new concepts in a way that we felt like was the best possible path for them to learn a faction as quickly as possible.

708
00:44:14,664 --> 00:44:16,165
Because, again...

709
00:44:17,263 --> 00:44:21,247
Like an LCG model, other things that do work on tabletop,

710
00:44:21,247 --> 00:44:25,030
it's not a necessity for doing something on digital.

711
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,432
And I think a lot of our community folks say,

712
00:44:27,432 --> 00:44:29,434
hey, why don't you do a LCG thing?

713
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:31,116
Well, we don't really have to do that.

714
00:44:31,116 --> 00:44:31,876
I think that's actually a...

715
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:38,384
almost a result of like the practicality of having to print stuff on tabletop.

716
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:43,211
From our perspective, giving someone a starter bundle is challenging because we don't know how

717
00:44:43,211 --> 00:44:47,756
to value that, the players don't know how to value a starter bundle yet, they're super overwhelmed.

718
00:44:48,117 --> 00:44:54,802
So being able to actually show new cards in a nice sort of progressive way has worked better for us,

719
00:44:54,802 --> 00:44:57,885
even though I think most people do want to do starter bundles.

720
00:44:57,885 --> 00:45:00,907
I think that's a very common decision.

721
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,488
So it's just something to consider.

722
00:45:02,488 --> 00:45:08,093
I think every game is different, but that's the sort of philosophy and the thinking that we took.

723
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:24,658
Absolutely. When we were doing design and tech work very closely together, when we were working on systems design, one of the litmus tests we would always give ourselves is we would run a simulation of first-time user experience, like virtually write it down on paper or figure it out on the graph.

724
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:31,282
plug that system in and make sure that it is as seamless as possible for the first-time user.

725
00:45:31,282 --> 00:45:38,206
It's one of the biggest traps of feature-based design like this is it is really easy to lose sight of what the first-time user experience is.

726
00:45:38,206 --> 00:45:44,870
Once all of us have our own accounts, it is time-consuming to keep starting new accounts and run through that experience again.

727
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:49,333
But we have to keep cognizant of it because these games live or die by acquisition.

728
00:45:50,508 --> 00:45:52,229
OK, I'm going to zoom through a little bit faster.

729
00:45:52,229 --> 00:45:56,293
So even besides doing some of the stuff around systems, like

730
00:45:56,293 --> 00:45:59,616
our progression vector, even around our goals for how we

731
00:45:59,616 --> 00:46:01,238
design cards, I had the same idea.

732
00:46:01,238 --> 00:46:02,559
It had to fit one goal.

733
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:07,003
So everything from our goal for text was avoid hyper

734
00:46:07,003 --> 00:46:07,703
literal text.

735
00:46:07,703 --> 00:46:09,405
So we started out as the premise.

736
00:46:09,405 --> 00:46:13,388
And we said, hey, we just got to lower our word card count

737
00:46:13,388 --> 00:46:15,150
because our stuff's getting way too wordy.

738
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:21,415
and we try to aim for like a budget of 30 characters per line, a hard max of like four lines,

739
00:46:21,415 --> 00:46:27,040
single card abilities, especially early on, and just kind of move discoverables into a different area

740
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,622
so people can kind of start to discover cards.

741
00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:30,683
So here's like an example of...

742
00:46:31,403 --> 00:46:35,566
a very typical day-to-day card for the original idea for the Kera,

743
00:46:35,566 --> 00:46:36,967
which is a general Bloodborne spell.

744
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:41,069
And we started with whenever you summon a minion from anywhere this turn,

745
00:46:41,069 --> 00:46:42,450
give it plus one, plus one.

746
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:46,613
It's very technical, it's very accurate,

747
00:46:46,613 --> 00:46:49,915
it also represents how tokens work in the game.

748
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:52,456
But now you have to spend all this time to read it,

749
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:55,438
and most people won't really know the difference.

750
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:58,340
And the bottom version is cut almost in half,

751
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,721
and it's just generally more clear.

752
00:46:59,821 --> 00:47:03,703
and accomplishes 80% of the objective of what we wanted to say.

753
00:47:03,703 --> 00:47:08,046
I know, some players do complain that our text isn't as precise enough,

754
00:47:08,046 --> 00:47:11,068
but aggregate complexity is a real thing.

755
00:47:11,068 --> 00:47:12,549
You can never judge a card in a vacuum,

756
00:47:12,549 --> 00:47:14,950
you have to judge it as part of a six-card hand.

757
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,672
So every time you add a word onto a card,

758
00:47:16,672 --> 00:47:19,573
you have to multiply that by six, theoretically,

759
00:47:19,573 --> 00:47:24,256
and that aggregate complexity can turn off new players so fast that...

760
00:47:24,597 --> 00:47:25,777
Like again, kills are actually-

761
00:47:25,777 --> 00:47:27,558
We still challenge with this all the time.

762
00:47:27,558 --> 00:47:27,918
Oh yeah.

763
00:47:27,918 --> 00:47:32,699
It's a very tough one.

764
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:35,820
So for takeaway number six, again, not everyone

765
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,201
can catch up to hardcore players.

766
00:47:37,201 --> 00:47:38,821
They may spend more time playing the game.

767
00:47:38,821 --> 00:47:41,042
Some people just are better with positioning.

768
00:47:41,042 --> 00:47:43,743
They might have a better collection through time.

769
00:47:43,743 --> 00:47:46,343
And originally, we offered a discrete number of wins.

770
00:47:46,343 --> 00:47:48,064
And you get certain like, why gold?

771
00:47:48,524 --> 00:47:52,306
But again, this makes people stronger, richer, and it makes,

772
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:54,506
you can create, like, essentially a death spiral,

773
00:47:54,506 --> 00:47:57,308
where the bottom 10% of your community just quits

774
00:47:57,308 --> 00:48:00,649
just because they don't think they're good at the game,

775
00:48:00,649 --> 00:48:04,210
or they're losing a lot, and then now the next 10th,

776
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,691
10th percentile will leave, and then all you get

777
00:48:06,691 --> 00:48:10,433
are these super hardcore, high-skill, super elite players

778
00:48:10,433 --> 00:48:11,813
that can play, like, 50 games a day.

779
00:48:12,354 --> 00:48:17,118
So what we did was think a lot about how to do catch-up mechanics on digital.

780
00:48:17,118 --> 00:48:20,201
So we had welcome back quests, which we talked about.

781
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:22,504
And this one is a very interesting example.

782
00:48:22,504 --> 00:48:26,588
So the first original idea for doing a catch-up mechanic was,

783
00:48:26,588 --> 00:48:30,031
hey, we're going to offer you 10 gold for every four ranked plays.

784
00:48:30,031 --> 00:48:32,594
So, and we have a cap of 50 gold.

785
00:48:33,074 --> 00:48:38,417
But we started to see people progressively starting to concede 20 games on ladder.

786
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:41,638
This is like what they did. They log in, just lose 20 games.

787
00:48:41,638 --> 00:48:48,182
And they figured out how long they had to play and just estimate and optimize their gold time.

788
00:48:48,182 --> 00:48:52,684
So what we ended up doing is then switching it to five gold per two wins.

789
00:48:52,684 --> 00:48:53,584
And

790
00:48:54,402 --> 00:48:59,549
What that means is that per completion, you get plus 10 extra gold for completion.

791
00:48:59,549 --> 00:49:04,735
So that means that in the first 14 wins per day, you're essentially getting 15 gold per

792
00:49:04,735 --> 00:49:07,478
two wins, and it tapers off at 14.

793
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:10,522
So the nice thing is that

794
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:17,784
It allows players to start to mentally think that I'm kind of losing extra gold if I don't play more,

795
00:49:17,784 --> 00:49:21,206
but in a way that reinforces them to play and to win.

796
00:49:21,206 --> 00:49:26,809
And it's a positive. It's almost like the original like WoW rest XP system,

797
00:49:26,809 --> 00:49:29,591
where it started punishing you. It just said, hey, you got some extra XP

798
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:32,272
that you can get just by like playing a bit more.

799
00:49:32,592 --> 00:49:34,313
or killing a few more mobs that day.

800
00:49:34,313 --> 00:49:37,114
So that's actually a very similar psychological system

801
00:49:37,114 --> 00:49:37,494
than we did.

802
00:49:37,494 --> 00:49:39,294
It's all positive reinforcement.

803
00:49:39,294 --> 00:49:41,115
But then what this also solved too

804
00:49:41,115 --> 00:49:43,176
is that for people who wanted to grind

805
00:49:43,176 --> 00:49:45,516
and continue to play and play 100 games a day,

806
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:46,897
they can still continue to earn gold

807
00:49:46,897 --> 00:49:48,837
because in the previous version,

808
00:49:48,837 --> 00:49:51,178
we capped it at like a max of 50.

809
00:49:51,178 --> 00:49:55,800
So this pleases both sides of the player base.

810
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,180
Absolutely.

811
00:49:58,931 --> 00:50:19,391
So in the catch a mechanic that's what for out of game systems inside the game we use again a lot of standard ccg designs here so the man around some of the returns of the amount of stuff you can do it. The power level of your place increase every turn so people get an early advantage are could be defeated by somebody with who has.

812
00:50:19,792 --> 00:50:22,073
waits on more powerful stuff that's pretty standard.

813
00:50:22,073 --> 00:50:26,136
The stakes elevate from turn to turn so we have in the game we have

814
00:50:26,136 --> 00:50:29,738
mana springs that allow people to get temporary mana for running into the

815
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:32,020
middle of the board and interacting with their opponent.

816
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:36,343
They could, even somebody who gets it that first will burn through more cards

817
00:50:36,343 --> 00:50:39,325
which the other player may decide to hold on and get card advantage by

818
00:50:39,325 --> 00:50:40,146
killing more of their stuff.

819
00:50:40,726 --> 00:50:43,207
And we have something called strong board clears.

820
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:46,448
Players who, games like this often ramp,

821
00:50:46,448 --> 00:50:48,489
boil down to how much tempo can I get,

822
00:50:48,489 --> 00:50:50,009
how many threats can I put on the board

823
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:52,990
as quickly as possible that my opponent cannot react to.

824
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:56,291
We decided to increase the strength of the cards

825
00:50:56,291 --> 00:51:00,213
that can wipe out multiple, multiple threats at once.

826
00:51:00,213 --> 00:51:01,913
So again, to give an advantage to somebody

827
00:51:01,913 --> 00:51:04,574
who is laying behind or allow people to play defensively

828
00:51:04,574 --> 00:51:05,595
in a control style.

829
00:51:06,095 --> 00:51:12,059
wait for your opponent to over commit and just stabilize, don't die, and then finish them off.

830
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,667
play a board clear and then win the game

831
00:51:13,667 --> 00:51:14,528
with your more powerful stuff.

832
00:51:14,528 --> 00:51:16,409
And be aware, of course, every design decision

833
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:18,611
has trade-offs, so philosophically,

834
00:51:18,611 --> 00:51:21,534
we decided to do that, and we stuck with that decision.

835
00:51:21,534 --> 00:51:24,817
There's obvious negatives for having strong board clears

836
00:51:24,817 --> 00:51:27,419
and having a lot of options for removal,

837
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:31,243
and that's an issue that community will talk about as well,

838
00:51:31,243 --> 00:51:35,226
but it's something that we stuck to on a top-down level

839
00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:37,768
to kind of maintain fidelity of the game and the board.

840
00:51:38,249 --> 00:51:43,614
Now, number seven, what's different from tabletop compared to digital is also consistency in

841
00:51:43,614 --> 00:51:48,419
being able to release patches and having sort of like this military unit basically on your

842
00:51:48,419 --> 00:51:50,862
team that can continue to push out content.

843
00:51:50,862 --> 00:51:54,505
So as mentioned before, we originally launched on the web.

844
00:51:54,505 --> 00:51:58,309
And one of the huge benefits for doing stuff on the web is that we can deploy things very

845
00:51:58,309 --> 00:52:00,371
quickly without people having to get updates.

846
00:52:01,032 --> 00:52:04,674
and very quickly just started to tune things

847
00:52:04,674 --> 00:52:06,816
behind the scenes, especially like early on.

848
00:52:06,816 --> 00:52:09,377
Then once we knew that we had a pretty consistent game,

849
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:11,779
we had like the amount of time that we wanted,

850
00:52:11,779 --> 00:52:13,140
then we can like push out onto PC.

851
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:18,103
But our cadence is pretty much close to

852
00:52:18,103 --> 00:52:21,686
two patches a month, and we did 55 patches in one year.

853
00:52:21,686 --> 00:52:24,788
So we're very focused on having a plan

854
00:52:24,788 --> 00:52:27,590
for what we want to push out, and we think about...

855
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:36,594
The type of content that we want to do in terms of live events is split into three areas daily, as well as weekly, and then also for monthly.

856
00:52:36,594 --> 00:52:40,676
So the monthly stuff would be like ranked ladder, and we have an inverse reward system.

857
00:52:40,676 --> 00:52:48,140
So for example, we front load the best rewards actually at a lower rank, and as you continue to go up, the rewards are actually a little bit less.

858
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:54,326
awesome than the ones at the bottom. So the bulk of people will get the coolest cards like that month and

859
00:52:54,326 --> 00:52:58,310
rather than the richer getting stronger by being more skilled and getting better stuff.

860
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:04,816
We have boss battles that we introduced that you can play against the AI every week with completely different types of decks.

861
00:53:04,816 --> 00:53:09,641
We have daily challenges and you know, our game is like primarily PvP

862
00:53:09,641 --> 00:53:12,904
but we spend a lot of time also thinking about training challenges and

863
00:53:13,165 --> 00:53:21,045
single-player challenges that people can start to experiment with so that they can build confidence before you you jump into into ladder

864
00:53:22,697 --> 00:53:29,559
And so these are some of the cards that we release every month that are different and kind of change things up in terms of meta.

865
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:38,102
Now, takeaway number eight is creating a social community atmosphere, which on tabletop everyone does too.

866
00:53:38,102 --> 00:53:41,823
But especially on digital, there's a lot of different cool ways that we did things.

867
00:53:41,823 --> 00:53:44,284
We split it into like three distinct areas.

868
00:53:44,284 --> 00:53:49,766
We use Discord for like real time interaction that is like short lived, ephemeral.

869
00:53:49,766 --> 00:53:52,306
And then Reddit was something that people might check daily.

870
00:53:52,827 --> 00:53:56,950
and the content there are the folks that would check once a day and things like that.

871
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:00,353
There's like some good content that you can kind of see there that was happening.

872
00:54:00,353 --> 00:54:04,556
And then we also have, we run our own forums and those are designed

873
00:54:04,556 --> 00:54:08,579
for long form where people are going to spend time to write long articles and essays

874
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:12,682
and like deck types and you know all that sort of thing. We have a custom support

875
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:16,585
system where we actually have a 24 hour grading system so we look

876
00:54:16,585 --> 00:54:20,528
at how fast and how quickly and what the quality is for all the

877
00:54:20,528 --> 00:54:20,848
different.

878
00:54:22,069 --> 00:54:23,910
requests that we get and

879
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:29,234
tickets that we get and we our goal is to always get like zero tickets like every day and that's one of the key

880
00:54:29,234 --> 00:54:31,916
things that we strive to do and

881
00:54:31,916 --> 00:54:36,799
So just to give you kind of a benchmark our Twitter number of Twitter follows about 18 K

882
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,420
Facebook is like 35,000 likes and

883
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:45,604
Our our view right now at this point in time is that Twitter is still a very is a very powerful

884
00:54:45,604 --> 00:54:47,226
mechanism to communicate like

885
00:54:47,906 --> 00:54:54,433
patches and ideas and new cards and things like that because the challenge right now on Facebook is that

886
00:54:54,433 --> 00:54:58,818
1% of your Facebook posts reach your audience even less than that

887
00:54:58,818 --> 00:55:04,544
Even if they like your product or like your page anything you post up there just doesn't get to anyone anymore

888
00:55:04,544 --> 00:55:04,684
Okay

889
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:11,904
And again, we integrated featured streamers directly in-game so that people can also start to,

890
00:55:11,904 --> 00:55:18,170
if they're not sure how to play the game, they can click, immediately jump onto, watch a game that's on Twitch,

891
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:23,576
and also to find someone that's there, and also perhaps even interact with the player and kind of learn some things.

892
00:55:23,876 --> 00:55:27,337
And we also run a lot of dev talks where different parts of

893
00:55:27,337 --> 00:55:30,499
our community can talk about an upcoming boss or how we

894
00:55:30,499 --> 00:55:34,221
sort of designed it or things that you can think about.

895
00:55:34,221 --> 00:55:38,042
Number nine is, unfortunately, you just can't make everyone

896
00:55:38,042 --> 00:55:39,963
happy in digital.

897
00:55:39,963 --> 00:55:42,204
And it's really tough.

898
00:55:42,204 --> 00:55:46,846
And a lot of the decisions that we make isn't a majority

899
00:55:46,846 --> 00:55:49,967
sort of thing where all the players, like 80%, will make a

900
00:55:49,967 --> 00:55:50,328
decision.

901
00:55:50,328 --> 00:55:53,449
Generally, it will polarize very evenly.

902
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:59,915
on a certain decision. So if you query a large group of players, it would always polarize

903
00:55:59,915 --> 00:56:03,138
into like two different areas for like what they believe is a good design. And they're

904
00:56:03,138 --> 00:56:09,724
both all valid. I think that a lot of these decisions are feedback that we get. So we

905
00:56:09,724 --> 00:56:14,669
just stick true to our original philosophy. We try to have some pillars that we do in

906
00:56:14,669 --> 00:56:17,031
terms of our planning for the next expansions.

907
00:56:17,452 --> 00:56:21,453
And our goal is just to bolster the strengths that we have.

908
00:56:21,453 --> 00:56:23,613
Rather than trying to plug all the weaknesses

909
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:26,354
necessarily in our game, we just move forward,

910
00:56:26,354 --> 00:56:29,294
try to build the things that we know that we're strong at,

911
00:56:29,294 --> 00:56:32,535
like having a game that lasts for less than 10 minutes,

912
00:56:32,535 --> 00:56:35,616
building, like, a really cool set of archetypes

913
00:56:35,616 --> 00:56:38,436
and exciting win conditions and things like that to do it.

914
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:41,237
And there's just no way you can build,

915
00:56:41,237 --> 00:56:43,498
quote, unquote, like, a perfect game.

916
00:56:43,498 --> 00:56:45,398
And I'll give you a couple examples.

917
00:56:45,398 --> 00:56:46,658
Is that...

918
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:55,929
We had originally like two card draw where you can draw like two cards and we change it to a single draw that that really polarized and in some ways pissed off the community.

919
00:56:56,845 --> 00:57:00,326
But there were a lot of reasons why we needed to do that.

920
00:57:00,326 --> 00:57:03,668
A lot of times we might have the keyword random in our card,

921
00:57:03,668 --> 00:57:06,809
and a lot of that stuff is to fix variety,

922
00:57:06,809 --> 00:57:09,990
and also to smooth out parts of the skill curve.

923
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:12,971
But again, the folks that are playing a lot and they love

924
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:17,293
deterministic highly skilled games are going to get frustrated.

925
00:57:17,293 --> 00:57:20,054
So there's a balance and we just decided,

926
00:57:20,054 --> 00:57:20,914
hey, we're not going to be.

927
00:57:22,536 --> 00:57:26,341
We're going to have a little bit more RNG than chess or Go,

928
00:57:26,341 --> 00:57:30,647
but we're going to have less RNG than another typical CCG

929
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:32,330
that's out there or any of our competitors.

930
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:36,456
And we just kind of stuck with that position.

931
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:55,975
We might do questions. Yeah, so this again the summary. He said that the bottom right quadrant is the area to start thinking about in terms of how to improve those areas. I think this will always benefit for high frequency for the game and that's that's pretty much it from so thanks so much and.

932
00:57:55,975 --> 00:58:05,058
I think we have a couple of minutes for questions if.

933
00:58:07,177 --> 00:58:09,307
Yeah, we'd love to answer any questions you guys have.

934
00:58:09,307 --> 00:58:09,709
Here they come.

935
00:58:10,342 --> 00:58:12,222
Hi, thanks for a great talk.

936
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:17,024
I've been wondering recently, with board games being so huge,

937
00:58:17,024 --> 00:58:21,525
we've seen some successful ports of board games into digital.

938
00:58:21,525 --> 00:58:24,226
But it seems like, aside from CCGs,

939
00:58:24,226 --> 00:58:27,367
there haven't been a lot of natively digital games

940
00:58:27,367 --> 00:58:31,828
that borrow board game mechanics or feel like board games.

941
00:58:31,828 --> 00:58:34,709
We haven't seen a lot of digital deck builders or worker

942
00:58:34,709 --> 00:58:36,449
placement games, for instance.

943
00:58:36,449 --> 00:58:38,630
Is that something you guys think there is potential for,

944
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:39,410
or is it just like...

945
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:41,972
nature of the medium that it doesn't work.

946
00:58:41,972 --> 00:58:45,535
Well, if you mean why we think there aren't any more

947
00:58:45,535 --> 00:58:48,578
natively digital board game-esque type games

948
00:58:48,578 --> 00:58:50,620
is because of the strengths of the medium.

949
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,682
Once you build a digital game natively digital,

950
00:58:53,682 --> 00:58:55,584
then you are clearly going to be playing

951
00:58:55,584 --> 00:58:57,365
to the strengths of the medium.

952
00:58:57,365 --> 00:59:00,188
And the more, there's always going to be a point,

953
00:59:00,188 --> 00:59:02,430
there's always where you have to choose.

954
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:07,233
We have to choose is this a digital game with all the with the strengths that

955
00:59:07,233 --> 00:59:10,896
Keith was talking about or are we going to try to make it a little bit more

956
00:59:10,896 --> 00:59:13,598
real-time kitchen table style game. So I mean

957
00:59:13,598 --> 00:59:18,082
there will at best will probably be more hybrid style games

958
00:59:18,082 --> 00:59:21,945
or games that are adapted from board games in order to teach

959
00:59:21,945 --> 00:59:24,307
board games a little bit easier.

960
00:59:24,307 --> 00:59:24,967
Thank you.

961
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:33,106
Given the process that you guys, or given the amount of time you spent invested in going from

962
00:59:33,106 --> 00:59:38,071
the prototype to digital, and now you guys I know are thinking about mobile, or at least tablet,

963
00:59:38,071 --> 00:59:42,475
or phone, I don't know, how is that, how are you kind of looking at those challenges?

964
00:59:42,475 --> 00:59:44,557
So going from like desktop to mobile?

965
00:59:45,078 --> 00:59:47,941
What are the biggest challenges from desktop to mobile?

966
00:59:47,941 --> 00:59:54,248
The biggest challenge from desktop to mobile is screen space, screen size, and text size.

967
00:59:54,248 --> 01:00:00,275
So text size is the hardest thing for us to adjust for.

968
01:00:00,615 --> 01:00:03,797
That's really actually the biggest one was text size.

969
01:00:03,797 --> 01:00:06,698
And also the UI and how to frame some things.

970
01:00:06,698 --> 01:00:09,719
So if you guys have already tried out our like beta

971
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:12,260
for the mobile, it's going to be,

972
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,921
there's a certain things that we had to remove

973
01:00:14,921 --> 01:00:17,122
out of the game on mobile

974
01:00:17,122 --> 01:00:19,243
so that we can accommodate that sort of space.

975
01:00:23,442 --> 01:00:26,943
Hi, I wanted to actually ask two questions if I could.

976
01:00:26,943 --> 01:00:31,545
So the first one is just for your matchmaking.

977
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:35,366
As a player progresses and starts playing and they get better,

978
01:00:35,366 --> 01:00:38,207
they also start playing better players.

979
01:00:38,207 --> 01:00:41,808
Do you feel that they're still getting a rewarding experience

980
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:45,829
even though their win rate might not be increasing, but they're getting better?

981
01:00:47,742 --> 01:00:54,726
Well, I mean, every player is going to cap out at one particular division based on their ranking.

982
01:00:54,726 --> 01:01:00,569
That's one of the main reasons why we have floors in our ranking system.

983
01:01:00,569 --> 01:01:06,932
What we generally find the behavior is, once a player hits their skill cap and starts going down to the floor of their rank,

984
01:01:07,452 --> 01:01:10,634
That's where, because you can't go down, generally speaking,

985
01:01:10,634 --> 01:01:12,474
more players tend to experiment more with decks.

986
01:01:12,474 --> 01:01:15,456
And they play more fun decks or more experimental stuff.

987
01:01:15,456 --> 01:01:17,817
And the chances of that player winning against those decks

988
01:01:17,817 --> 01:01:19,818
goes up quite substantially.

989
01:01:19,818 --> 01:01:22,279
So they will end up with a bit of a roller coaster.

990
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:27,401
But our seasons being one month and resetting

991
01:01:27,401 --> 01:01:29,722
tends to solve a lot of that.

992
01:01:29,722 --> 01:01:31,803
Can I actually ask one more quick question

993
01:01:31,803 --> 01:01:33,544
related to that same issue?

994
01:01:35,113 --> 01:01:46,046
How much do you value skill, sorry not skill, quality of decks in matchmaking or does that just over time become a component of their skill if they keep playing the same deck long enough?

995
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:49,072
If you mean, do you mean quality of decks by how good?

996
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:51,514
How well it's put together, how consistent it is.

997
01:01:51,514 --> 01:01:55,038
We don't track, for example, what number of legendaries

998
01:01:55,038 --> 01:01:59,042
or the rarity of the cards when you hop into a match.

999
01:01:59,042 --> 01:02:02,105
Where we, I think what the cohort-based matchmaking does

1000
01:02:02,105 --> 01:02:04,908
is it helps us solve a lot of those sort of issues.

1001
01:02:04,908 --> 01:02:05,508
Okay, thank you.

1002
01:02:05,508 --> 01:02:05,769
Thank you.

1003
01:02:08,539 --> 01:02:11,924
Hi, so you went through lessons learned.

1004
01:02:11,924 --> 01:02:15,229
I'm wondering if you actually had any of these design pillars

1005
01:02:15,229 --> 01:02:18,193
in the beginning, or are there lessons learned?

1006
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:21,618
And how late in the process did you learn them?

1007
01:02:21,618 --> 01:02:21,979
I'm sorry, I didn't.

1008
01:02:23,648 --> 01:02:26,209
So the design pillars were pretty early on.

1009
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:29,070
So when we were already developing the prototype

1010
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,811
and thinking about transitioning to digital,

1011
01:02:30,811 --> 01:02:32,931
those were the first thoughts,

1012
01:02:32,931 --> 01:02:34,632
making the game less than 10 minutes.

1013
01:02:34,632 --> 01:02:36,873
That was definitely at the start,

1014
01:02:36,873 --> 01:02:41,335
how we built the first set of 60 cards to test out.

1015
01:02:41,335 --> 01:02:43,496
So the first 60 cards helped to accomplish

1016
01:02:43,496 --> 01:02:46,597
that the matches would last less than 10 minutes.

1017
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:47,897
Although at that time, of course,

1018
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:50,158
you had very clear hard counters and things like that

1019
01:02:50,158 --> 01:02:52,079
because of the limited card size.

1020
01:02:52,779 --> 01:02:57,744
and then the other goal is how we can accommodate players that we're losing.

1021
01:02:57,744 --> 01:03:00,886
I think those were all things that we planned pretty early on in the game.

1022
01:03:00,886 --> 01:03:06,091
One other thing that's like a little bit more on the technical side is that

1023
01:03:06,091 --> 01:03:10,535
we knew that we might move to the mobile or to have the opportunity to expand there

1024
01:03:10,535 --> 01:03:15,419
and that's why we did pixel art, why we did like 2D style art, because we knew that...

1025
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:20,021
Potentially we would have limited bandwidth, texture space, things like that.

1026
01:03:20,021 --> 01:03:24,423
We wanted to have an app that you could download, have a small binary, and things like that.

1027
01:03:24,423 --> 01:03:27,724
So those were more technical things that we planned out very early on.

1028
01:03:27,724 --> 01:03:30,945
Because a lot of people ask, why isn't your game all in 3D?

1029
01:03:30,945 --> 01:03:37,848
But the reality is having 400 units all 3D animated on a board is pretty challenging

1030
01:03:37,848 --> 01:03:43,051
and it could actually be pretty high effort for doing that.

1031
01:03:43,051 --> 01:03:45,232
And they look so cool on your iPhone.

1032
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:47,715
It does look pretty good, the pixel art now.

1033
01:03:47,715 --> 01:03:47,955
Thank you.

1034
01:03:47,955 --> 01:03:48,336
Thank you.

1035
01:03:48,336 --> 01:03:52,037
You talked a little bit about the challenge of making sure

1036
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:55,518
that people have a really good experience with

1037
01:03:55,518 --> 01:03:57,079
matchmaking online.

1038
01:03:57,079 --> 01:04:00,160
And I'm curious about doing that when you have a premium

1039
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,961
game and you're trying to build out the community, how

1040
01:04:02,961 --> 01:04:04,622
you might approach something like that.

1041
01:04:04,622 --> 01:04:06,503
Making sure you have enough players there when you first

1042
01:04:06,503 --> 01:04:09,064
launch so that all your new players aren't coming on and

1043
01:04:09,064 --> 01:04:11,825
then finding they can't play online because no one's there.

1044
01:04:12,435 --> 01:04:14,361
A premium game is a paid game?

1045
01:04:14,361 --> 01:04:16,308
Yeah, like a paid online multiplayer game.

1046
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:19,560
That's a tough one.

1047
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,122
A lot of the digital board games are paid online multiplayer.

1048
01:04:22,122 --> 01:04:22,963
It's true.

1049
01:04:22,963 --> 01:04:28,207
I mean, with a premium game, you've got a hard gate already of how many players you're

1050
01:04:28,207 --> 01:04:29,308
going to get.

1051
01:04:29,308 --> 01:04:34,072
Our game was, because it's a free-to-play, we knew we were going to have a huge cohort

1052
01:04:34,072 --> 01:04:38,136
of players to start with, I mean, compared to a tabletop game.

1053
01:04:38,136 --> 01:04:41,038
So we made our rank ladder very granular.

1054
01:04:41,038 --> 01:04:45,742
The best way I could think of to start with, you would have to make a very non-granular

1055
01:04:45,742 --> 01:04:46,463
ranking ladder.

1056
01:04:46,463 --> 01:04:46,923
And just...

1057
01:04:47,224 --> 01:04:51,567
allow for a little bit more,

1058
01:04:51,567 --> 01:04:52,948
a little more give in actual,

1059
01:04:52,948 --> 01:04:56,190
like in the fidelity of matchmaking for sake of time.

1060
01:04:56,190 --> 01:05:01,714
Because I think time, the time between matchmaking

1061
01:05:01,714 --> 01:05:03,755
is your number one consideration

1062
01:05:03,755 --> 01:05:06,257
because that's what makes your game feel active and alive.

1063
01:05:06,257 --> 01:05:09,879
And also one thing is that casual queue

1064
01:05:09,879 --> 01:05:12,241
seems like just another thing to do,

1065
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,743
but it's, in our opinion,

1066
01:05:15,884 --> 01:05:23,106
really hard to build a casual matchmaking system because the mindset is oh, it's casual, but

1067
01:05:23,106 --> 01:05:26,028
everyone still wants to win in that queue.

1068
01:05:26,028 --> 01:05:31,830
So as a result even if you lose it feels bad and then also you have people with insane skill level that can jump in

1069
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:35,371
there, and then you also have players that want to experiment with decks.

1070
01:05:35,371 --> 01:05:40,533
It's really hard to find a quality match for everyone because everyone's goals are so different on

1071
01:05:41,034 --> 01:05:45,595
casual. So, although people say, hey I want to practice on that and not have like

1072
01:05:45,595 --> 01:05:50,797
ladder stress, actually they don't feel that great going on a casual unless you

1073
01:05:50,797 --> 01:05:54,939
spend a lot of time building that system. So, if you're thinking of maybe building

1074
01:05:54,939 --> 01:05:59,401
a lot of modes, I still think that having a very simple ranked progression system

1075
01:05:59,401 --> 01:06:03,962
that can reset, that's PvP, have a single queue, is probably better because casual

1076
01:06:03,962 --> 01:06:05,963
is like very hard to build.

1077
01:06:09,274 --> 01:06:11,657
Hey, my question is primarily for Eric.

1078
01:06:11,657 --> 01:06:18,206
How do you go about balancing your responsibilities on Duelist with whatever responsibilities

1079
01:06:18,206 --> 01:06:21,551
you may have on your more traditional tabletop games you're working on simultaneously?

1080
01:06:22,369 --> 01:06:44,303
Oh, I mean I've I've got an amazing team so it's I'm not like the only designer we have a team we have a full team of 5 designers that work as a group so my role at to do this is the I mean it was the design of the core game and the and the full alphabet is that but during that time we've been training our team of really really talented people to

1081
01:06:45,244 --> 01:06:48,704
like to, in the dualist design style, and they all have the,

1082
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:51,925
they've all got separate talents and perspective as well.

1083
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:55,386
So, my job is more of a, at this point, is as a vision keeper.

1084
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:57,587
So, I'm the one who will lay out the foundation for the set,

1085
01:06:57,587 --> 01:07:01,147
why this set is fun, what cool mechanics are we going

1086
01:07:01,147 --> 01:07:05,448
to explore, but this is a point where it's so collaborative

1087
01:07:05,448 --> 01:07:08,369
that there's four of us in one given set.

1088
01:07:08,369 --> 01:07:09,990
So, even as my.

1089
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:13,731
exact participation rise and falls in the exact card design,

1090
01:07:13,731 --> 01:07:15,792
you probably won't even notice a difference, I don't think.

1091
01:07:15,792 --> 01:07:18,253
And there'd be some cards in our previous expansion

1092
01:07:18,253 --> 01:07:22,034
where designers can learn best from the mistakes.

1093
01:07:22,034 --> 01:07:25,536
So there's some cards that some of our other designers

1094
01:07:25,536 --> 01:07:28,217
had pushed out that didn't work out very well.

1095
01:07:28,217 --> 01:07:31,238
And then also, we have a very specific top level,

1096
01:07:31,238 --> 01:07:35,139
S-rank competitive balancer that's really top ranked

1097
01:07:35,139 --> 01:07:38,701
and is always like rank zero every month,

1098
01:07:38,701 --> 01:07:40,281
really understands what's happening.

1099
01:07:40,662 --> 01:07:45,085
in the game. Yeah, exactly. I'm like the worst player on our team.

1100
01:07:45,085 --> 01:07:48,627
Hey, thanks guys. Really appreciate it. Thank you so much for your time.
