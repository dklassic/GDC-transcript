1
00:00:04,885 --> 00:00:10,328
Welcome everyone. We're going to start probably on time. We have a lot to cover. It's kind

2
00:00:10,348 --> 00:00:15,110
of sad when you go against like Valve and others out there. Some great talks going on,

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,773
but we hope that you get a lot out of this one. We ask that you please make sure your

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:26,336
cell phones are on vibrate and don't forget to fill out the forms at the end. We'll remind

5
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:27,256
you again before you leave.

6
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,621
So the topic here, as you can see, because it's on a big projector, is

7
00:00:33,682 --> 00:00:36,183
we're talking about Star Wars The Old Republic, titled There Is Another.

8
00:00:36,863 --> 00:00:37,944
And we're going to talk a little bit about

9
00:00:38,444 --> 00:00:42,006
some of the challenges that we went up against, some of the things

10
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:46,509
that we did in our production cycle to make this game

11
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:50,591
actually happen, to come out, and actually make there be some legitimate

12
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:54,453
alternatives to the other three-letter game that need not be mentioned.

13
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:57,014
In any case, my name is Dallas Dickinson.

14
00:00:57,414 --> 00:00:58,154
This is Rich Vogel.

15
00:00:58,614 --> 00:01:00,375
I have a clicker here that can make this thing go forward,

16
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:00,915
and so I will.

17
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:02,876
We're going to talk a little bit about ourselves here,

18
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,636
because that's what one does at a conference like this.

19
00:01:05,877 --> 00:01:09,018
So I started in the business as a programmer,

20
00:01:09,038 --> 00:01:12,039
and kind of grew up from that as a programmer to a designer,

21
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:15,160
then a producer, and worked on console games

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,181
for the first five years of my game career.

23
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:20,322
And I've always been an avid online player.

24
00:01:20,342 --> 00:01:23,923
I play Deku Muds a lot, even once a GM of a Deku Mud.

25
00:01:24,623 --> 00:01:24,703
And...

26
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:27,704
One of the things I realized, I really love that space.

27
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:29,945
Connected communities are very cool.

28
00:01:30,405 --> 00:01:34,686
And dealt into the opportunity to work at 3DO with Meridian

29
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:38,968
59, and then the opportunity to help before UO launched to

30
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:41,569
actually be the launch producer of UO and get that

31
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:43,549
out, and then of course, Star Wars Galaxies.

32
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:47,110
And then I looked at the next generation of the Star Wars

33
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,071
game, which is Knights of the Rogue Republic, which is

34
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:54,654
which is what I'm working on right now, SWOTOR and Stars of the Old Republic.

35
00:01:54,674 --> 00:01:58,977
And it was a great opportunity for me to kind of like learn the lessons I did on other games

36
00:01:59,017 --> 00:01:59,897
and apply it to here.

37
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:03,119
And it was a pretty long path to get to where I did.

38
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,762
And now I'm kind of stuck on this genre because I think it's very cool to deal

39
00:02:07,802 --> 00:02:10,964
with connected communities and I think it's really the future of online gaming,

40
00:02:11,385 --> 00:02:13,846
not just MMOs but connected communities in general.

41
00:02:14,964 --> 00:02:15,644
proud to be here.

42
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:18,706
So I'm Dallas Dickinson, I'm the director of production on the project.

43
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:23,168
I'm old, but I'm not quite as old as Rich, so I've only been in the online space for

44
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:23,989
about 13 years.

45
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:28,351
I actually started in the casual online games, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy Online, and then

46
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:33,093
I moved my way along into the massively multiplayer game, and then as Rich has said, we've worked

47
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:35,615
on a massive, massively multiplayer game most recently.

48
00:02:37,387 --> 00:02:40,168
So the big question here is, how do you actually become a genre leader?

49
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:44,311
How do you get to this place within the massively multiplayer space?

50
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:47,874
And the answer is, it is not simple.

51
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:50,135
But these are the principles that we try to apply.

52
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:52,357
The first is that you have to be able to broaden the market.

53
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:55,298
It's something that the World of Warcraft actually did very effectively.

54
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:58,481
It took the massively multiplayer space and made it something that millions and

55
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:01,202
millions of people were interested in playing, as opposed to hundreds of

56
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:05,205
thousands, which is honestly where Rich and I came from in our previous games.

57
00:03:06,827 --> 00:03:08,472
After that, you do need to differentiate yourself.

58
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:13,829
There have been a lot of games that don't, and they're the ones that have failed, especially in this space.

59
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,451
You need to build enough content.

60
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:19,974
It kind of goes without saying, but in games like this, these games that are connected,

61
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:24,398
these games that are always on, where people play with their friends, they get through

62
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:25,459
content really fast.

63
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:27,541
And we took this as one of the challenges.

64
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:32,145
We needed to make sure that we had not just enough content at release, but that we had

65
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:36,769
a plan to be updating that content consistently and keeping people really understanding why

66
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:39,770
their subscription is actually worth something.

67
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,950
We're not going to get totally into business model talk here, but really the

68
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,111
differentiation we're trying to point out here is we are still a game that has

69
00:03:47,131 --> 00:03:50,332
this subscription base, and we believe very strongly that there is space in the

70
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:53,932
market for a handful of these AAA titles that are worth a

71
00:03:54,753 --> 00:03:57,673
subscription to your players, but you really need to have content and you

72
00:03:57,693 --> 00:04:01,174
really need to have it going very quickly and continue updating at all

73
00:04:01,214 --> 00:04:01,494
times.

74
00:04:01,634 --> 00:04:03,957
And it's really important to know that since this is a

75
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:07,240
subscription game in a free-to-play MTX world, that

76
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,983
they have to value it as a premium service so that people

77
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:12,346
who pay the subscription feel like they're getting their

78
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:13,848
money's worth every single month.

79
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:16,430
And that's why it's critical for the update phase to make

80
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,633
sure people, when they play this game, wow, I'm getting

81
00:04:18,753 --> 00:04:19,934
great value for our money.

82
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:22,196
So again, it's very easy to say these four things.

83
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:23,557
Here are the big four principles.

84
00:04:23,617 --> 00:04:25,718
But the question is, how do you actually do that?

85
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,620
The first step, and I want to assure everybody that this is

86
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,861
the easiest step.

87
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:33,442
There is nothing difficult about this, is to start with

88
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:34,603
the world's most popular IP.

89
00:04:35,564 --> 00:04:36,124
Just do that.

90
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:41,047
Once you do that, and I like to joke with, in fact, I

91
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,668
wouldn't have said this if our marketing director hadn't

92
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,328
actually entered the room.

93
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:47,552
I like to joke with the marketing department that their job was to actually walk out in

94
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:50,935
front of a microphone and say, Star Wars, BioWare, MMO, and then walk away.

95
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:54,258
Because that actually gives a huge leg up.

96
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,843
And so that helps when you're trying to get into this premium level.

97
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:00,484
You need to have something that strong.

98
00:05:01,686 --> 00:05:07,092
You do need to innovate. I mentioned you can't just release the exact same thing, but you need to be very careful about innovating.

99
00:05:07,112 --> 00:05:11,556
And we're going to talk about the way that we chose to innovate and why we chose to innovate in that way.

100
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:15,860
You need to scale. And this is scale not just in terms of the content that we're talking about.

101
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,426
It's scaling in terms of your team. And scaling a team, we're going to show you the numbers in a bit, it's pretty daunting.

102
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:25,469
and it changes everything about your processes,

103
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:28,291
about the way that you've actually structured your management,

104
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:31,393
the way you even structure the teams themselves that are working on the game.

105
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:33,334
And we didn't do it right the first time.

106
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:35,296
In fact, we went through many, many iterations

107
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,897
in order to get to the structure that we currently have.

108
00:05:38,658 --> 00:05:39,639
And then finally, triaging.

109
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,743
And triage is a word that is overused.

110
00:05:43,463 --> 00:05:45,546
I think people think of it in a very narrow way.

111
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:48,689
What I really mean is you need to be looking at all times

112
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,493
about whether the work that you're doing actually serves

113
00:05:51,913 --> 00:05:54,977
really your innovations and serves the core market.

114
00:05:55,897 --> 00:06:00,739
We made a lot of cuts as in fact we have some of our partners from Lucas here in the room

115
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,360
And there were some cuts that it was painful for us to sort of decide to make

116
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,962
But we made it because we wanted to focus the game. We wanted to make sure that the game that came out delivered

117
00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:12,823
Very much on our differentiating factors

118
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:16,222
So yeah, it's Star Wars, we get that.

119
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:17,923
That helps a whole lot.

120
00:06:18,303 --> 00:06:20,945
But that doesn't guarantee you success.

121
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:23,567
Again, our friends at Lucas know that they've made many

122
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:25,609
Star Wars games, some of which are very successful, some of

123
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:26,529
which are not so successful.

124
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:29,932
There's a lot more that has to go into a game, especially

125
00:06:29,952 --> 00:06:32,653
when you're really trying to become a leader within your

126
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:33,474
genre and space.

127
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:35,756
So we're going to talk a little bit about innovation

128
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:38,858
and kind of our process, our thought process, as we chose

129
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,599
how to innovate in The Old Republic.

130
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:46,894
In innovation, one of the things that we want to do is we want to make sure that you differentiate

131
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:50,956
yourself. Now, we don't want to act like every other

132
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:55,539
clone after World of Warcraft came out, because we realized if we did that, we would not be

133
00:06:55,579 --> 00:07:00,422
able to reach or keep the players we wanted to keep when we initially launched this game.

134
00:07:00,943 --> 00:07:05,425
So it was extremely important to say, okay, what are we doing and what makes our game

135
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:09,048
unique out there that's different than any other experience that people are going to

136
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:09,728
play our game?

137
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:16,238
We didn't want to recreate everything because we are an MMORPG,

138
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:20,400
which means we have to have a core foundation of an MMORPG.

139
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,321
So we wanted to make sure that when people who played these games get into our game,

140
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:27,922
they would feel familiar with the game mechanics right away.

141
00:07:28,263 --> 00:07:31,304
There's a reason that people don't take a first-person shooter and remove the shooting.

142
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:33,124
It's because it's a first-person shooter.

143
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:36,285
And so we took that as a tenet. We are making an MMORPG.

144
00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:37,586
We need to keep a lot of that core.

145
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:42,910
So one of the things we first do, and this is something that Blizzard talks about too,

146
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,412
and it's also something that was our core philosophy going into our game way before

147
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:52,435
Blizzard talked about it, is to make sure that we go for our core audience first.

148
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:54,155
They are our influencers.

149
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,297
They're the people that are our early adopters in our game.

150
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,699
They're the people that are viral, because this is an online game, they're our viral

151
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,680
connection to the community.

152
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:15,508
And it's very important that we make sure that we treat and aim our target audience carefully in this game so we can get them into the game early, establish the economy, establish the base, establish the life, I call it, the heartbeat of our game.

153
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:17,510
And that's going to come from your core audience.

154
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,710
We went after that first.

155
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:29,538
Then, as time goes on with our updates and everything else, you'll see us drift more toward a more casual play style in our game, very similar to what Blizzard did.

156
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:30,918
Yeah, but you need to be careful.

157
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,720
You can't do it too fast, and you can't do it in ways that

158
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,840
are going to alienate that core.

159
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,921
The core is your market.

160
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:38,182
I mean, they really are your business, and so you need to

161
00:08:38,222 --> 00:08:40,683
hold them close while you slowly grow

162
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:41,863
to the outer edge.

163
00:08:41,883 --> 00:08:44,784
Yeah, it's extremely important to make sure that when we talk

164
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,766
about things like, anybody's done a subscription-like game,

165
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:49,446
there is what we call the funnel.

166
00:08:50,027 --> 00:08:52,888
And the people coming into the game needs to be constant.

167
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:56,349
And the levers that you use for that is acquisition.

168
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,752
retention and reacquisition.

169
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,715
And you have to make sure that retention,

170
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:02,638
which by the way is cheaper to keep people

171
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:04,641
than to acquire people, is very important.

172
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:06,504
That's why you never want to piss off your core

173
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:09,849
as you're moving towards that more casual audience.

174
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:11,651
So you have to be very careful how you prioritize.

175
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:17,830
One of the things we did is we looked at what the core is in MMOs traditionally.

176
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,312
And we wanted to know what could we add to that core baseline.

177
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:25,475
So we all know that there's a kind of a story arc that goes through MMOs,

178
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:28,358
not a real true story in the game, but a story arc.

179
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:31,460
And then there's character progression, there's combat exploration.

180
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,643
So this is the core feature set that we knew that we had to hit on all three of these,

181
00:09:37,463 --> 00:09:43,166
and we wanted to take something more, and we wanted to look at, so what is the audience,

182
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:45,448
and this is the Bartles IV for anybody who doesn't understand,

183
00:09:45,748 --> 00:09:48,549
what is the core look for in type of these types?

184
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,271
Again, so we don't alienate them right away and make them feel familiar.

185
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:55,833
The socializers, we want to make sure we have a really good mechanics in the game, the support

186
00:09:55,873 --> 00:09:59,774
crafting and healing and other things that are kind of sort of non-combat related.

187
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:04,236
We want to make sure that the killers in our game have good PvP to play.

188
00:10:04,596 --> 00:10:08,638
We wanted to make sure that the achievers have a really good level-based system where

189
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:10,579
you have cool loot and it's all about that.

190
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:15,141
And we want to make sure that the explorers in a big world have points of interest and

191
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:15,821
side quests.

192
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:20,003
So these things are very important to make sure our holistic core was solid.

193
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:23,773
And everything, including all our game design, always look back and say,

194
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:27,062
are we hitting this core MMORPG feature set?

195
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:34,138
Now, we decided, what do we need to do, layer on top of that, to make our product innovative,

196
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:38,760
but not do everything in the kitchen sink, go so broad that we just fail at making, we

197
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,660
make a lot of poor systems in the game.

198
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,602
So what we did, is we decided to say, what is BioWare do very well, better than anybody

199
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:46,822
else?

200
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:47,823
It's about story.

201
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:49,563
So what we said was.

202
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:54,248
We're going to innovate and put the fourth pillar in our game and put story in our game.

203
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:58,473
We're actually going to do it with total voiceover, not only the NPC, but the character voiceover.

204
00:10:58,954 --> 00:11:04,680
Kind of like what I tell people is, it's kind of like what talkies did to silent film.

205
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:08,425
It's going to make the genre different in the way you play our game.

206
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:10,768
In fact, we found a lot of people who play our game

207
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:15,369
can't go back into Blizzard and play WoW because they have such a different experience with

208
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:19,811
our game. It's more emotional. This is something we wanted to do. We wanted to make sure we

209
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:24,932
revolutionized storytelling. We also wanted to say, what is another important thing about

210
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:28,834
Bioware games is our companion system. We wanted to make people have the ability to

211
00:11:28,874 --> 00:11:29,254
go out

212
00:11:30,194 --> 00:11:32,255
in the game and feel like they're not alone all the time.

213
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:33,836
Now it's important to meet other people.

214
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:35,757
We had to make sure that mechanic was there too.

215
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:39,860
But we wanted to make sure that companions added flavor,

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,441
added color, also added to the storyline,

217
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:45,022
and really made the game feel kind of unique in that way.

218
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:47,403
The other way we want to do is combat.

219
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:52,430
Now combat we want to make sure was different than any other MMO before because most of

220
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,777
the MMOs had Flintstone type combat and we wanted to make sure our combat was very cinematic,

221
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:01,542
very much lightsabers touching lightsabers and things like that.

222
00:12:02,142 --> 00:12:05,484
also wanted to do something that no other game has done before, was actually put in

223
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:10,667
a true range combat system in our game. Most games are melee with a little bit of fake

224
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:15,710
range, but really it's like 40 meters. We did 70 plus meters with our game with real

225
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:20,693
true cover system as a part of our range combat system.

226
00:12:20,934 --> 00:12:24,575
And again, really the key to all three of these innovations as we sort of chose them,

227
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:28,397
and again, we had a whole list of stuff that we might want to do early on in the project.

228
00:12:28,598 --> 00:12:32,940
We chose these three not just because we felt that they were places that Bioware had some skills

229
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,462
and could bring sort of that Bioware feel to the massive multiplayer space.

230
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,763
You'll note that all three of these things you associate with Star Wars.

231
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:42,747
You associate it with Star Wars before you know that our game exists.

232
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:48,014
Tremendous storytelling, the sidekicks within the game, and this cinematic, fast-paced combat.

233
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:52,419
And so, not only were we choosing differentiating factors kind of from the blue of like,

234
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,545
these would be cool things that Bioware does, it's also actually what hits the core of that IP.

235
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:02,087
And the other thing that's not on this list was, after we launched, we put in the legacy system,

236
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:05,029
which is an everyone knows the legacy of Star Wars.

237
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:09,551
Again, everything we do, the innovative wise, we try to make sure it fits the Star Wars theme.

238
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:15,915
And our big goal was to make sure that you felt like you could live your dreams in the Star Wars universe.

239
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:19,317
That was the key goal that drove every design decision that we had.

240
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:24,841
And these were the pillars that we communicated to our team constantly and made sure our design always focused on.

241
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:29,475
Now, we're going to talk a little about, this is the area

242
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:32,342
that we want to talk about, is how could we scale to the size

243
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:34,007
we needed to do and the amount of content?

244
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:35,993
and the clicker comes back.

245
00:13:36,673 --> 00:13:38,874
So first I just want to give you guys an idea of this.

246
00:13:38,914 --> 00:13:40,334
You may have seen some of these numbers before.

247
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:43,155
This is a ridiculously big project.

248
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:45,776
This is the amount of dialogue in this game.

249
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:49,237
As you can see, it's six times Dragon Age, nine times Mass Effect,

250
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:52,738
more than all Bioware games previously made combined.

251
00:13:53,558 --> 00:13:55,619
It is in fact, we're now in the Guinness Book of World Records

252
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,360
for the largest voiceover project ever completed.

253
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:05,322
It takes a lot of work to build this stuff, and you need to make sure that you actually have really, really good systems to do so.

254
00:14:06,442 --> 00:14:10,943
Twenty full planets, some of the iconic ones you see there, Tatooine and Hoth, ninety unique areas.

255
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:17,504
These are all the adventure areas that you go to, derelict spacecraft, other places that your story will take you.

256
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:21,245
And it's a tremendous amount of just locations to build in the game.

257
00:14:21,465 --> 00:14:23,166
And they're all fairly unique in their look.

258
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:25,920
This was the end goal.

259
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,681
And this is actually what we're hitting.

260
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,902
We have now the telemetry that tells us that people play

261
00:14:30,182 --> 00:14:33,844
somewhere between 150 and 200 hours in the level up to get

262
00:14:33,864 --> 00:14:35,605
sort of to the max level of their class.

263
00:14:36,205 --> 00:14:38,126
This is a ridiculous amount of content.

264
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:41,748
Those of you who've worked on RPGs before know that RPGs are

265
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:44,810
frequently 20 to 30 hours, or maybe 50 hours if you're

266
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,610
really, really pushing it.

267
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:46,871
That's one.

268
00:14:47,611 --> 00:14:53,314
story, 50 hours. We're doing it eight times at 200 hours. So the only way you can do this

269
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:58,777
is make sure that your pipelines are solid. We had, again, a leg up here. The hardest

270
00:14:58,837 --> 00:15:03,539
part, the longest pipelines, were the ones that BioWare already knows how to do. We have

271
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:07,501
a tremendous writing pipeline, a tremendous VO pipeline, in fact, a great localization

272
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:07,942
pipeline.

273
00:15:08,222 --> 00:15:14,705
So all of the stuff that actually kind of bites other groups in the ass when they're trying to build a game that has this type of content,

274
00:15:15,065 --> 00:15:19,028
we knew this stuff and we knew how to get it done, we knew the schedule and the timeline you needed

275
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:23,110
in order to get your writing done early enough for all of that stuff that has to happen on top of it.

276
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,453
We also had a tremendous art outsourcing pipeline.

277
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:27,854
Rich is going to talk a bit more about that.

278
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,197
That's something that we actually sort of brought in,

279
00:15:31,257 --> 00:15:31,737
I should say.

280
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:34,119
Rich had some great experience, and I had some great

281
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,182
experience at Sony, where we had done this exploration into

282
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:39,504
how to create large amounts of outsourced art.

283
00:15:39,964 --> 00:15:42,587
And then our environmental artists, they also kind of

284
00:15:42,707 --> 00:15:45,529
really got into the mindset early on of how to iterate

285
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:47,531
very quickly and to get these planets built out.

286
00:15:48,232 --> 00:15:49,353
Some places we didn't do so well.

287
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:53,254
This isn't a full post-mortem, so we're not going to go into details, but

288
00:15:53,714 --> 00:15:56,155
we had some very bad technical issues.

289
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:58,135
Our build pipeline was horrible.

290
00:15:58,955 --> 00:16:00,996
This was impactful not just to the developers,

291
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:02,416
it was impactful to QA.

292
00:16:02,736 --> 00:16:04,956
We had difficulty getting builds in front of QA

293
00:16:05,016 --> 00:16:06,557
that were in fact solid builds

294
00:16:06,817 --> 00:16:08,257
that they knew that they were testing against

295
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:09,717
the true latest greatest code.

296
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:11,358
This killed us.

297
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,118
And it honestly is one of the biggest problems.

298
00:16:14,158 --> 00:16:17,939
We're still finally figuring out all of the solutions today.

299
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,661
Same is true of some of the designer tools that we have for our data table management,

300
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:24,061
string table management, scripting.

301
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:26,022
Again, these are less impactful.

302
00:16:26,302 --> 00:16:30,164
I should say that the third ones, or the second, third, and fourth ones are less impactful.

303
00:16:30,184 --> 00:16:32,765
The build pipeline was impactful throughout the process.

304
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:35,786
As I say, we spent a lot of time trying to refine it and get it better,

305
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:39,287
but it wasn't perfect, and it actually, you know, it caused a lot of pain in the studio.

306
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:45,192
The goal here is to actually have enough content to obscure the horizon.

307
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:49,879
And what I mean by that is we've all played games, specifically Massive League multiplayer games,

308
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:53,143
where you play the first five levels, ten levels, and they're awesome.

309
00:16:53,423 --> 00:16:54,725
They're really highly polished.

310
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:58,630
You can tell that a lot of time and love and iteration went into making this experience great.

311
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,071
And then you fall off a cliff.

312
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:02,732
I mean, you literally, you can feel it as a player.

313
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:07,214
Obviously, you were in the games industry, you probably feel it more quickly because you know what's going on.

314
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:12,596
But the players, the ones who are maybe not quite so locked into how game development works,

315
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:13,697
they feel it as well.

316
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:16,238
I just stopped getting quests at level 10.

317
00:17:17,218 --> 00:17:21,442
I just stopped seeing the level of polish in the areas when I left this zone.

318
00:17:21,722 --> 00:17:23,483
It started to get a little buggy and glitchy.

319
00:17:23,984 --> 00:17:27,627
And we knew that, especially with a game that is so much about the storyline,

320
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:32,511
it's so much about having this engaging, emotional piece that pulls you through.

321
00:17:33,144 --> 00:17:36,925
we couldn't have that happen. So not only does the first five minutes need to be awesome,

322
00:17:37,185 --> 00:17:41,446
it actually needs to go all the way through. If you don't have a climactic storyline that

323
00:17:41,486 --> 00:17:46,007
actually pushes you through, we sort of have three-act structure. And if the third act

324
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:51,569
doesn't hit you with the power of great cinematics, great story, we actually have failed. And

325
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:55,409
so we had to spend a lot of time making sure that those pipelines worked so that we could

326
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,170
achieve this goal.

327
00:17:57,878 --> 00:17:59,839
And how you do that is by scaling a team.

328
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:01,421
So we're going to show you some numbers here that are

329
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:02,221
kind of terrifying.

330
00:18:03,022 --> 00:18:04,824
We haven't said them publicly before, but anybody who

331
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:06,085
actually looked at the credits could have

332
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:06,765
figured this out.

333
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:08,727
So show us the numbers, Rich.

334
00:18:08,747 --> 00:18:12,169
Yeah, our credits run 15 minutes, which is scary enough

335
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:12,690
in itself.

336
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:16,593
I had the task of putting that together.

337
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:19,495
And let me tell you, if you ever do credits, it's like

338
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:22,198
really interesting, I'll put to say in the game.

339
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:24,479
All the politics comes right out.

340
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:30,517
One of the things that we had to do is we realized as we went through, and I'm going

341
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:35,602
to talk about each one of these things, what we had to basically do to develop the content

342
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:41,707
that we talked about earlier is in order to do, to manage this, we had to have 30 production

343
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:42,067
people.

344
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:42,928
These are producers.

345
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:46,869
DDs, which were Director of Development type people, and

346
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:51,090
also PMs, Project Managers, to help support the team.

347
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,991
We had 75 designers.

348
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:55,711
We had 80 engineers working on this project.

349
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:59,072
We had 40 engineers in platform and management,

350
00:18:59,552 --> 00:19:02,013
because we had to build a platform to launch this thing.

351
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:04,013
And we had an audio.

352
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:07,114
The great thing is we had LucasArts do the audio for us,

353
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:10,295
but we had to, and they had a big team on top of that, by

354
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:11,515
the way, is not included in this.

355
00:19:12,195 --> 00:19:12,815
We also had

356
00:19:13,555 --> 00:19:16,896
a team here just to manage the audio and integrate it into the game.

357
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:19,517
That's why it's the smallest of the groups.

358
00:19:19,937 --> 00:19:25,939
And the art pipelines, we had both outsourcing and also full-time people.

359
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:31,141
We had about 140 artists together working around the world on this project.

360
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:36,743
We had 280 QA people at the peak working around the world, both outsourcing and also in-house

361
00:19:36,823 --> 00:19:37,243
outsourcing.

362
00:19:37,503 --> 00:19:38,323
In-house, sorry.

363
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:39,023
QA.

364
00:19:39,063 --> 00:19:39,343
Because.

365
00:19:39,784 --> 00:19:44,615
The one thing we had to do is be able to go through all this content and repeatedly go through this content every build.

366
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,322
You have to have a large team to do that in QA to make that happen.

367
00:19:48,612 --> 00:19:50,353
How do you manage a team like this?

368
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:52,995
We are craftsmen.

369
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:55,818
Very badly at first is actually the answer.

370
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:57,739
It took us quite a while to get to a place where we

371
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,661
actually feel like we have a handle on the structure.

372
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:02,223
Yeah, we grew kind of quickly, and we had the growing pans

373
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:04,585
to show it, and we had the scars to show it.

374
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,727
We realized as we were going through this stuff, we said,

375
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:08,869
oh, we really have to make some changes here because

376
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:09,930
we're not scaling very well.

377
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:15,555
The thing about it is, is I tell people we are craftsmen, we are not cogs on a machine.

378
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:20,319
And we all have personalities that we have to deal with, and we all have to learn how to deal with those personalities.

379
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,703
What does everyone do? They take their best programmer and put him in management, right?

380
00:20:25,003 --> 00:20:26,965
He's going to be the lead programmer, even though he's the best programmer.

381
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:30,288
It doesn't necessarily mean that he should be put in lead structure,

382
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,010
because he may not fail very well.

383
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,733
He may not do very well, because that's not what he has in his DNA to do that.

384
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:41,038
So we learned a lot about scaling a sense of what's appropriate roles for people and about hiring.

385
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:45,923
So one of the biggest things we did for hiring is we made sure that when we hire people,

386
00:20:46,364 --> 00:20:48,045
we want to make sure they have the skill to do it.

387
00:20:48,185 --> 00:20:52,309
But the biggest thing after we checked that off is can they fit in our team culture?

388
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:59,877
That was more important to us than anything else because everyone does deals with the prima donnas and the ego type people.

389
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,598
We have them too.

390
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,519
We aren't 100% good at that process.

391
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:06,140
And in fact, sometimes you want those people.

392
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:07,801
They are highly valuable.

393
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:10,203
These are the self-described geniuses,

394
00:21:10,263 --> 00:21:11,904
or sometimes actually geniuses also.

395
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,685
But if you have too many of them,

396
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:15,406
if that becomes your team culture,

397
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:17,107
as opposed to they're the exceptions,

398
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:20,048
it's really hard to manage an overall team,

399
00:21:20,088 --> 00:21:20,809
especially a team of this size.

400
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:22,010
Sometimes you gotta isolate them a little bit

401
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,830
and put them in their own room,

402
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,911
and make sure they're not dangerous.

403
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:25,652
Go do genius stuff.

404
00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:26,372
Don't talk to anybody.

405
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:30,994
But there's definitely personalities we had to deal with and we had to do a lot of shifting around

406
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:34,075
because some people didn't do well in their roles and some people did.

407
00:21:34,135 --> 00:21:37,597
And actually some people surprised us and did really well in certain roles

408
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:39,317
that we didn't even know they could go up, came up to.

409
00:21:39,357 --> 00:21:39,457
Now

410
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:46,518
What we did in this organization to make this happen is we basically, if you look over here,

411
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,364
we basically have these two pillows, which is QA and production over here.

412
00:21:51,804 --> 00:21:55,048
These are supporting the interior thing here, you see here.

413
00:21:55,368 --> 00:21:58,071
We broke it out into one section is content.

414
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:00,072
The other section is tech.

415
00:22:00,773 --> 00:22:05,155
And what we did is these two pillars right here were matrix

416
00:22:05,235 --> 00:22:05,795
organization.

417
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:10,638
They cut through the tech and design or content, which means

418
00:22:10,698 --> 00:22:14,180
content, anything audio, anything design, anything art

419
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,080
is all content.

420
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,761
And then, of course, tech goes all the way down into

421
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:18,962
features and programmers.

422
00:22:19,322 --> 00:22:22,243
We made sure these two organizations supported

423
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:27,705
throughout the organization with project managers, DDs,

424
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:30,286
and producers, and PMs.

425
00:22:30,786 --> 00:22:33,587
And QA had embeds working with, and we'll talk about

426
00:22:33,627 --> 00:22:36,848
how we broke all this out into strike teams, to make sure

427
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:37,708
they supported the

428
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:47,156
core group here. We learned that this is actually helping us scale a lot. And we'll talk about

429
00:22:47,176 --> 00:22:51,922
a little bit how the matrix management works and later on in the presentation. But then

430
00:22:51,962 --> 00:22:55,387
we learned there was something we needed more as we grew because we were such a big team

431
00:22:55,847 --> 00:22:58,270
is we actually had, this is what I call checks.

432
00:22:58,971 --> 00:23:01,652
and balances on quality and direction.

433
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:05,633
So quality was QA and direction was the PMs

434
00:23:05,673 --> 00:23:07,654
to make sure everyone is stepping in the right direction.

435
00:23:07,934 --> 00:23:10,135
And then technically, we wanted to make sure

436
00:23:10,635 --> 00:23:12,575
that we didn't go down the wrong path.

437
00:23:12,595 --> 00:23:13,296
By the way, we did.

438
00:23:14,196 --> 00:23:16,777
And this is why we formed this group

439
00:23:16,837 --> 00:23:17,737
so we didn't do it again.

440
00:23:17,757 --> 00:23:18,237
This is a structured.

441
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:22,018
today. This is not the structure we started out with. And in fact, the last one to come

442
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:28,260
into this was the tech director group. Because we had a lot of people working on really important

443
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:33,042
stuff, really cool features. They were not being brought back into sort of the reality

444
00:23:33,202 --> 00:23:37,263
of how to make this all scale within a massive multiplayer engine. And so we developed a

445
00:23:37,343 --> 00:23:42,765
full group who really were just the auditors. They do the deep dives into making sure that

446
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:46,087
features, specifically technical features, but also some of the ways that designers work,

447
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:49,650
that it could scale and could actually fit within our engine, because for a while,

448
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:54,853
we were kind of running off the rails in that direction. And the good news about this group

449
00:23:54,913 --> 00:23:58,435
is they audited our designers, because what designers will do if you allow them and give

450
00:23:58,455 --> 00:24:01,457
them the tools to do it, they will go off the rails to get it done.

451
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:07,860
And what they realized is when you get something off the rails, it doesn't scale very well in an MMO.

452
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,061
Anyone who has worked on these know that they're very highly integrated systems,

453
00:24:12,341 --> 00:24:16,423
and if you mess something up down below, it's going to affect something over here you had no idea about.

454
00:24:16,763 --> 00:24:21,405
So the auditors actually went into all the systems, the big questing system that we had in our game,

455
00:24:21,705 --> 00:24:28,408
and fixed a lot of designer zealous going on to make sure it fixed, because designers are impatient.

456
00:24:28,448 --> 00:24:29,088
They want to get it in.

457
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:30,129
want to make great stuff.

458
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:30,830
And they want to make great stuff.

459
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,472
If you don't give them the tools that they want, they'll

460
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:34,074
figure out how to make it with the tools that they have.

461
00:24:34,094 --> 00:24:35,816
And that's often exactly the wrong thing to do.

462
00:24:36,316 --> 00:24:37,878
So this was a very good addition.

463
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:40,601
I highly recommend anybody doing this in a large team.

464
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:43,525
Make sure you have your checks and balances on your

465
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,128
schedule, quality, and tech.

466
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:51,152
So when we started, that's not how we did it.

467
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:53,674
When we started, we kept our discipline.

468
00:24:53,714 --> 00:24:55,136
We started totally agile.

469
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:57,418
So we picked up agile.

470
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:59,661
We had all the managers change in agile development.

471
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:02,444
We got Mike Cohen to come down, and we went through the

472
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:04,226
workshops and all the training and everything.

473
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:08,110
And we formed scrums, and we did the stand-ups and all those

474
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,691
little things that you normally do.

475
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:10,692
We found out.

476
00:25:11,213 --> 00:25:16,397
As we're moving along and we also have the disciplines that not work as true strike teams

477
00:25:16,457 --> 00:25:21,041
or scrum teams, we actually, they worked but they didn't work together if you understand what I'm saying.

478
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,604
They were always with their programmers, always with the artist except they would go meet

479
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:28,868
in the morning and do their stand-ups and they kind of work together with the teams

480
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:30,890
in different locations but they never sat together.

481
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:36,274
We found that they started to form towers and the cultures around them.

482
00:25:36,314 --> 00:25:39,077
So we said, this is not going to scale very well.

483
00:25:39,858 --> 00:25:45,390
So, what we happened was, again, we were spread apart.

484
00:25:46,615 --> 00:25:47,335
did not scale.

485
00:25:47,956 --> 00:25:51,058
So what we did is we looked at it very carefully, and we

486
00:25:51,098 --> 00:25:52,279
said, this ain't going to work.

487
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,542
So when we looked for a new facility, because we outgrew

488
00:25:55,562 --> 00:25:57,484
the one we were at, we actually designed it from the

489
00:25:57,524 --> 00:26:00,086
ground up to be pods, or strike teams.

490
00:26:00,146 --> 00:26:02,288
We actually have areas that are totally mobile.

491
00:26:02,308 --> 00:26:04,730
We have mobile desks, mobile chairs, filing cabinets, they're

492
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,311
all on wheels, they all move around.

493
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:11,495
We've actually configured our pods probably once every six

494
00:26:11,556 --> 00:26:13,978
weeks or so, we reconfigure our pods.

495
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:15,479
And basically what we did is we put.

496
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:20,760
the everyone together and formed multidisciplinary strike teams.

497
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:26,102
This is organized around a single deliverable or like in the case of if it's a feature,

498
00:26:26,362 --> 00:26:29,102
it would be the entire team that does a feature. If it's content, it would be,

499
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:33,163
for instance, an entire planet. So that would be the pod. It is everybody working on the planet,

500
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:36,964
including audio, including environmental art, including effects. These people would all sit

501
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:41,485
together. Now, one of the things we learned as we were scaling is when you scale so large,

502
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:50,475
There is a problem with accepting responsibility and ownership over a particular item.

503
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:54,178
And you always find the finger pointing going this way with the groups.

504
00:26:54,518 --> 00:26:58,001
What we found is when we put it together as a single focus strike team,

505
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:02,285
they actually put, they felt like had ownership over it, control over it,

506
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:05,707
and it made it for the large scale team that we had like 400 people,

507
00:27:05,727 --> 00:27:08,550
it actually made a single point very solid.

508
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,751
So it worked very well for us.

509
00:27:10,991 --> 00:27:12,712
But again, we didn't do this until way too late.

510
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:15,632
We started doing this a couple years ago, but we didn't

511
00:27:15,653 --> 00:27:18,093
really get all the way moved over into this structure for

512
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:18,553
quite a while.

513
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:19,594
It took a long time.

514
00:27:19,614 --> 00:27:21,815
And there's some roadblocks that you're going to talk about.

515
00:27:21,835 --> 00:27:22,055
Yeah.

516
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:24,175
One of the things that took a long time is all the leads were

517
00:27:24,195 --> 00:27:25,356
terrified of losing control.

518
00:27:26,176 --> 00:27:29,077
All the leads that I'm talking about, the gameplay lead, the

519
00:27:29,477 --> 00:27:32,638
systems lead, all the leads felt like we're going to lose

520
00:27:32,678 --> 00:27:34,038
control, why are we doing this?

521
00:27:34,439 --> 00:27:37,300
And so one of the things we did is we said, we're going to do

522
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,540
a matrix management across.

523
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,881
So all the leads, like the gameplay leads, and the client

524
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:46,462
lead, and the server lead, would basically say, OK, you

525
00:27:46,502 --> 00:27:50,044
control the resourcing for particular strike teams.

526
00:27:50,184 --> 00:27:52,564
You will help control the review process.

527
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:53,145
But.

528
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,506
You don't control their daily tasks.

529
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:59,308
That's the strike team's responsibility, the leader of the strike team to do that.

530
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:00,489
But you control everything else.

531
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:06,073
So this matrix organization set up by discipline, number one, help transfer single knowledge

532
00:28:06,113 --> 00:28:09,535
because one of the biggest things you don't want to do is when you break up teams like this,

533
00:28:10,115 --> 00:28:10,856
you sometimes

534
00:28:11,496 --> 00:28:15,222
mentor each other. Programmers mentor other programmers. It's really important to make

535
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:21,651
sure you keep that line, art the same way, design the same way. You have designer lunches

536
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:26,158
or programmer lunches. You have different feedback loops so that you don't lose that

537
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:27,220
core knowledge.

538
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,182
and you make sure that sharing happens across your teams is very, very important

539
00:28:32,202 --> 00:28:34,743
because if you do this too much, you'll lose sight of that.

540
00:28:35,103 --> 00:28:39,846
So what we did was we wanted to make sure that that's the other responsibility that the leads had to do.

541
00:28:40,106 --> 00:28:45,208
They can meet with their teams and go over things and do white papers or postmortems,

542
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:50,771
other things like that to help provide an outlet for making sure that

543
00:28:51,111 --> 00:28:54,453
buyers feel like they're artists and they can talk to other artists and things like that.

544
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:55,673
It really worked out well.

545
00:28:55,773 --> 00:28:57,694
And it really, I mean, it basically was a 180 flip from

546
00:28:57,714 --> 00:28:58,394
what we started with.

547
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:02,835
When we started, the disciplined teams were all

548
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:05,455
co-located, and they met once a day with their

549
00:29:05,555 --> 00:29:06,716
cross-disciplinary groups.

550
00:29:06,816 --> 00:29:07,756
And we just did the opposite.

551
00:29:07,976 --> 00:29:10,416
We got the cross-disciplinary groups actually co-located,

552
00:29:10,737 --> 00:29:12,877
and then the disciplined teams could meet maybe not once a

553
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,437
day, maybe once or twice a week.

554
00:29:14,977 --> 00:29:17,398
And they would get all of that feedback and knowledge they

555
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,498
needed, all of that touch.

556
00:29:18,878 --> 00:29:20,459
But the deliverable was the thing.

557
00:29:20,939 --> 00:29:22,159
That was the thing you were working on, and that's what

558
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:24,100
the guys around you in a pit were all working on together.

559
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:30,181
So, one of the things we also had to do is scale in terms of, we call RFTs, which are

560
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:33,762
full-time employees, TFTs, the temporary employees, the term we use.

561
00:29:34,382 --> 00:29:39,343
Basically, these are people who work through an agency that we go through and they usually

562
00:29:39,383 --> 00:29:40,363
have year contracts.

563
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:45,424
Normally we hire basically students or we hire some really good people out there who

564
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:49,885
just now, who we hire part-time to come in or they're full-time employees using our system

565
00:29:49,905 --> 00:29:53,186
but we hire them for X amount of time, they're not full-time employees.

566
00:29:53,846 --> 00:29:54,867
and we use outsources.

567
00:29:54,907 --> 00:29:57,129
So one of the things when we started off in production,

568
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,053
we realized very quickly is we had to scale,

569
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:04,317
but we wanted to scale in a way that's very smart.

570
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:06,299
We wanted to scale that we could do it quickly,

571
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,761
and we wanted to be able to scale

572
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:12,465
so that when things are done, we can pull off.

573
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:18,049
As the transition of products go from production to launch, there's different aspects of what

574
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,830
people do and they change over time.

575
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:26,315
So we came up with a process where we went to schools and we look at the best cohorts

576
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:31,819
coming out of the schools for art and design and we hire the top 10 or so and we put them

577
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:32,580
on for a year.

578
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,881
They get their year experience.

579
00:30:33,921 --> 00:30:34,981
It's great for their resume.

580
00:30:35,662 --> 00:30:41,344
They work hard with us, it's new blood, and before the cohort ends, which is usually right up in here,

581
00:30:41,665 --> 00:30:46,707
we do a three-month training overlapping period where we train up another set of cohorts coming in.

582
00:30:47,027 --> 00:30:51,029
And then the cool thing about it is we pick in these areas the best of the best.

583
00:30:51,469 --> 00:30:54,971
We say, at this cohort, we're going to pick three designers and they're going to become full-time.

584
00:30:55,191 --> 00:30:59,052
So it gives people an opportunity to show their stuff and get selected as full-time.

585
00:30:59,473 --> 00:31:00,893
So it's a try before you buy.

586
00:31:01,454 --> 00:31:06,737
But it's also clear to them, and I think in terms of HR management, it's very clear when

587
00:31:06,777 --> 00:31:09,059
you hire these folks that it's a contract position.

588
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,281
I've worked as a contractor, I think many of us have worked as contractors.

589
00:31:12,562 --> 00:31:17,045
It's a very clear deal, and it makes it a whole lot simpler for everyone, as well as

590
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:19,847
emotionally better, when the end of the term is up.

591
00:31:20,287 --> 00:31:25,731
Some people got pulled in, not everybody did, but it allows us as an organization to grow

592
00:31:25,891 --> 00:31:27,753
more slowly with the best of the best.

593
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:35,038
Absolutely. So on top of this, we pulled outsourcing. So we not only had outsourcing for ART, we had outsourcing for QA.

594
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:49,929
Outsourcing allows us to scale very quickly because what we did is, and we'll talk a little bit more about this later, is in outsourcing, we had the ability to say, you know, design, we design, and we're a very design-driven shop, by the way, BioWare is.

595
00:31:50,229 --> 00:31:57,295
And so when we iterate things, we've blown apart worlds over and over and over again to get the right feel to it and add things to the worlds.

596
00:31:57,695 --> 00:32:02,761
Adding big set pieces to worlds will take a long time to do if you don't have an art ready to scale like that.

597
00:32:03,061 --> 00:32:06,725
So the great thing about it is we use our art outsourcing to scale very quickly.

598
00:32:07,006 --> 00:32:10,990
I need all this armor set that has to go across eight different character type body types.

599
00:32:11,371 --> 00:32:13,634
Okay, fine. We'll get this outsourcing group.

600
00:32:13,654 --> 00:32:17,278
We'll say go to 25 immediately or go up to 30 immediately and they will.

601
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:23,283
And that's fantastic because it allows us to do fast iteration, scale very quickly without

602
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:26,705
the burn, by the way. One of the things this does is it slows your

603
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:31,929
burn rate on your project, too, your cost. Especially in a big project, you have to worry

604
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:33,910
about your burn rate, especially the size we are.

605
00:32:34,971 --> 00:32:37,633
In outsourcing, the way we manage that is very simple.

606
00:32:38,797 --> 00:32:41,759
We went around the world and looked at all the outsource

607
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,180
houses that we could find.

608
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,840
We actually flew.

609
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,340
We didn't run.

610
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:47,682
And we went to each one because it was important to

611
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:50,063
see, number one, what the work environment was like.

612
00:32:50,544 --> 00:32:51,584
Were the people happy?

613
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,985
What's the churn rate in that group?

614
00:32:54,025 --> 00:32:56,487
Because to be honest with you, a lot of them do have a large

615
00:32:56,547 --> 00:32:58,768
churn rate, and you don't want to train people over and over

616
00:32:58,788 --> 00:32:58,908
again.

617
00:32:58,948 --> 00:33:00,949
Especially among the leads, especially among the

618
00:33:00,989 --> 00:33:01,730
management structure.

619
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,671
If there's a bad, big churn, you don't want to work with

620
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:04,071
that studio.

621
00:33:04,471 --> 00:33:06,334
And basically, what's the feel of that environment?

622
00:33:06,374 --> 00:33:07,836
Can they scale, number two?

623
00:33:08,356 --> 00:33:11,280
And three is, do they have the network infrastructure to

624
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,783
support a build every day that we have to send to them or

625
00:33:13,844 --> 00:33:16,567
come back to so we can get stuff quickly from our

626
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:17,508
outsourcing houses?

627
00:33:17,889 --> 00:33:20,893
So one of the things is, once we've picked out our

628
00:33:20,973 --> 00:33:21,473
outsourcing,

629
00:33:22,074 --> 00:33:26,719
which we had one in China and one in the United States and one in Russia.

630
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:27,740
And one in Mexico.

631
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,041
And one in Mexico.

632
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:30,383
We also had another one in Romania.

633
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,946
And one of the things we did is we looked at the core team

634
00:33:34,107 --> 00:33:38,651
and we formed a group of sub-leads that we made them hire and train for us,

635
00:33:38,932 --> 00:33:40,253
that we trained with them.

636
00:33:40,473 --> 00:33:41,414
We brought them to our place.

637
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:42,155
We trained them up.

638
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:45,218
and they would be the ones that train others.

639
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:47,260
So we can scale very quickly that way

640
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,782
because they know what we had to do

641
00:33:49,042 --> 00:33:52,285
and they can train other artists very quickly to scale up.

642
00:33:52,585 --> 00:33:53,446
This is very important.

643
00:33:54,393 --> 00:33:58,654
including having an art director there that's trained by, that you pay for, that's trained

644
00:33:58,674 --> 00:34:02,935
by them as well, that all assets go through for QA and process.

645
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:09,197
Now the other thing we say is every two months we send a crew up to touch base with them.

646
00:34:09,457 --> 00:34:13,659
So we go out there, talk to them, see what their problems are because face to face is

647
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:16,339
much better than VidCon or communications through email.

648
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,620
A lot of times they don't tell you the problems.

649
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,942
Actually going up there and watching them work is really when you find out all the issues.

650
00:34:22,962 --> 00:34:26,304
Because culturally, some people don't talk about things like that.

651
00:34:26,544 --> 00:34:28,666
And you have to see that for yourselves.

652
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:32,428
Integrate them as part of your team is extremely important.

653
00:34:32,628 --> 00:34:34,029
Don't throw things over the fence.

654
00:34:34,229 --> 00:34:34,889
It won't work.

655
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:36,350
You got to give them T-shirts.

656
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:41,413
We used to go with another luggage of just T-shirts and swag for them and posters

657
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:43,414
so they make them feel like they're part of the team.

658
00:34:43,654 --> 00:34:46,556
The other thing we did is we had pictures on the wall of every outsourcer.

659
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:48,997
And they didn't know this, but we rated them.

660
00:34:49,457 --> 00:34:51,698
We actually had little gold stars, silver stars, bronze

661
00:34:51,738 --> 00:34:52,498
stars, and fire.

662
00:34:54,118 --> 00:34:56,339
And we rated them of how good they were.

663
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:01,681
And every group of artists that when we built our art team,

664
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:04,842
we said, we're building this art team for 60% of

665
00:35:04,962 --> 00:35:05,783
outsourcing of art.

666
00:35:05,843 --> 00:35:06,623
So get used to it.

667
00:35:06,943 --> 00:35:08,504
You have to manage other artists.

668
00:35:08,964 --> 00:35:11,225
And we started hiring for that in the first place.

669
00:35:11,725 --> 00:35:14,806
And these artists had a set of people on the wall they were

670
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,686
responsible for, for feedback.

671
00:35:17,087 --> 00:35:18,307
And it really worked well.

672
00:35:18,907 --> 00:35:21,448
And basically, we also had Vidcons.

673
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:25,970
We made sure that we always provided a timely feedback

674
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,991
mechanism, pipelines for feedback was very important to

675
00:35:29,031 --> 00:35:32,152
make sure that if they continue doing bad work, we

676
00:35:32,232 --> 00:35:33,272
get them corrected.

677
00:35:33,813 --> 00:35:36,754
I hate it when people come to me when we first started out

678
00:35:36,774 --> 00:35:38,254
and say, well, they're not doing what we wanted to.

679
00:35:38,354 --> 00:35:39,335
I said, did you train them?

680
00:35:39,975 --> 00:35:41,856
No, we told them about it, then we didn't

681
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:42,736
really follow up on it.

682
00:35:42,756 --> 00:35:44,216
It was, well, how are you supposed to get better?

683
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:47,139
It takes effort to make this happen.

684
00:35:47,299 --> 00:35:50,342
It's not easy and it takes a lot of communication,

685
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:52,844
especially when you have time zone issues.

686
00:35:52,864 --> 00:35:55,446
I actually had to work art and shifts to make this happen.

687
00:35:56,327 --> 00:35:56,447
Now.

688
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,512
The other thing we found out is different studios have different skill sets.

689
00:36:01,153 --> 00:36:04,915
Some studios are very good on the organic stuff like the characters and things like

690
00:36:05,035 --> 00:36:05,636
and creatures.

691
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:11,179
Other studios are very good at inorganic like lampposts, chairs, buildings.

692
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,142
And we found out it's very good to do that because go to their strengths.

693
00:36:15,902 --> 00:36:17,243
and scale with their strengths.

694
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,984
It's one of the reasons we had so many studios that we worked with.

695
00:36:20,084 --> 00:36:23,346
Right. And the other thing is don't put your eggs in your all-in-one basket.

696
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:26,968
One of the things I've learned is make sure you have multiple outforcing houses.

697
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:30,590
If you're going to scale like 60 percent like we did, it's very important

698
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,450
because you don't know what the political situation.

699
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,672
In fact, we had an issue with Romania where they had to be shut

700
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,773
down a couple of months because of political issues that were going on there.

701
00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:39,954
These are things you have to be prepared for.

702
00:36:41,195 --> 00:36:47,362
Also, it's leverage to you for your outsourcers saying, if they're not doing your job, you say, well, I'm going to shift it over here.

703
00:36:48,404 --> 00:36:52,128
And it makes them more motivated to do your work for you.

704
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:56,460
Now, QA outsourcing was a little different for us.

705
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,561
When we first started out, it was very hard.

706
00:36:59,821 --> 00:37:02,162
For us, I would say it's the hardest thing we had to do

707
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:02,762
to get right.

708
00:37:03,403 --> 00:37:04,443
It took a lot of effort.

709
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:07,244
We started very heavily on outsourcing external

710
00:37:07,304 --> 00:37:08,885
with leads just in internal.

711
00:37:09,465 --> 00:37:11,826
We found that that didn't work very well at all

712
00:37:12,306 --> 00:37:14,887
because what we found is most of the outsourcing houses

713
00:37:14,907 --> 00:37:16,567
that we're using just couldn't get

714
00:37:16,707 --> 00:37:19,328
what the quality level of gameplay experience

715
00:37:19,348 --> 00:37:21,249
that we wanted to get out of QA.

716
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:21,369
So.

717
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,351
We had also a lot of technical hurdles.

718
00:37:25,391 --> 00:37:30,254
When we send out builds of like 20 or 30 gigs, you know, out to the outsourcers,

719
00:37:30,474 --> 00:37:32,636
it takes them almost a day to load it.

720
00:37:32,696 --> 00:37:36,998
So we wanted to make sure that they had a technical infrastructure there, but still,

721
00:37:37,278 --> 00:37:41,361
it took up to six to seven hours and sometimes a day to go out and get the builds.

722
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:42,502
We lose that time.

723
00:37:43,342 --> 00:37:49,405
So what we found out very quickly is we use QA for regression testing because you see

724
00:37:49,445 --> 00:37:53,707
how big our game was. We had 1,600 hours of content we had to test plus all the features

725
00:37:53,727 --> 00:37:58,529
that wrap around that. They're very good at regression testing, so we actually used them

726
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:01,710
for that. So every time we make a change, especially in MMO where everything is connected,

727
00:38:01,971 --> 00:38:02,831
we use them to do that.

728
00:38:04,652 --> 00:38:06,474
They weren't very good at playtesting the game.

729
00:38:06,554 --> 00:38:09,177
So we had to work very hard to get them up to the level,

730
00:38:09,197 --> 00:38:10,818
but they still never got up to the level

731
00:38:10,918 --> 00:38:12,019
of our internal testers.

732
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,823
So we grew our internal testers into embeds.

733
00:38:15,843 --> 00:38:18,506
So we had QA embeds that wrote all the test plans

734
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,468
for the particular pods, and they were responsible

735
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:21,910
for the outsourcers to test them,

736
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:22,830
as well as our...

737
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:28,993
people inside the company, we had a core group of team that was just there as a strike team

738
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:31,913
to use whatever we wanted to do with whatever publish we had.

739
00:38:32,373 --> 00:38:41,256
So, we found out a good balance for us is more like not 10% inside and 90% outsource.

740
00:38:41,276 --> 00:38:46,317
We found a good balance was probably about 70% or in this case probably 65% inside and

741
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:48,098
then 45 or 35% outside was a good mix for us.

742
00:38:53,088 --> 00:38:53,876
The other thing we did.

743
00:38:55,237 --> 00:38:58,299
is talk about how we scale our production side of things.

744
00:38:58,339 --> 00:38:59,500
I'll let Dallas talk about that.

745
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,441
So this is really, it's a rule of thumb

746
00:39:01,622 --> 00:39:02,502
more than it is anything else.

747
00:39:03,203 --> 00:39:06,785
You will have variations within your studio and such.

748
00:39:06,825 --> 00:39:08,866
But this is what we kind of landed on in terms of,

749
00:39:09,287 --> 00:39:11,468
if you have more than 15 developers,

750
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:13,850
and this includes designers, programmers, in fact,

751
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,392
sometimes UI artists, all working

752
00:39:17,552 --> 00:39:18,953
on particularly one of those scrums,

753
00:39:19,013 --> 00:39:22,375
one of those little pods, you need at least one production

754
00:39:22,396 --> 00:39:23,036
resource for them.

755
00:39:24,137 --> 00:39:26,398
This number is what we work with today.

756
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:27,678
This is where we started.

757
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:29,019
It was ridiculous.

758
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,301
It was just, we grew really fast

759
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:35,102
and we didn't grow the infrastructure

760
00:39:35,322 --> 00:39:36,863
to handle it fast enough.

761
00:39:37,223 --> 00:39:39,404
And so we very quickly found out

762
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:40,705
that things were dropping through the cracks.

763
00:39:41,825 --> 00:39:43,306
I think we bought into a little bit

764
00:39:43,386 --> 00:39:45,547
that if you hire senior enough people,

765
00:39:45,587 --> 00:39:46,508
they don't need producers.

766
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:48,148
Yeah, that doesn't work.

767
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,010
And so this is where we were.

768
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,211
The 15 to 1, it is a rule of thumb.

769
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:57,193
The reality is we have senior people who can run 25

770
00:39:58,193 --> 00:40:01,775
developers, and that probably means two or three big

771
00:40:01,815 --> 00:40:04,976
initiatives that are being worked on by these sub-teams.

772
00:40:05,777 --> 00:40:10,323
Junior people, our sort of associate producers that we bring in, our associate PMs,

773
00:40:10,763 --> 00:40:12,525
we start them at 10 and see how much they scale.

774
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:15,869
It's not the only thing that I grade my people on,

775
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:17,411
but it's one of the most important ones.

776
00:40:17,612 --> 00:40:20,395
Literally is, how much do you scale as a producer?

777
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:23,399
How many balls can you juggle at one time in the air?

778
00:40:25,263 --> 00:40:29,806
We've actually taken on a mix of, these words are probably different in the studios you work in.

779
00:40:29,966 --> 00:40:32,728
DDs within the EA culture are development directors.

780
00:40:33,569 --> 00:40:37,712
PMs, project managers, they're actually kind of in the same chain, but usually a little bit lower level.

781
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:40,994
And then producers. And we use them for very specific things.

782
00:40:41,374 --> 00:40:43,435
So again, this is something we grew into.

783
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:47,438
When we started, I was the producer and we had three DDs.

784
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:51,641
And it was, as I said, not good in terms of numbers scale.

785
00:40:53,982 --> 00:40:56,524
The producers tend to be the ones who actually own high-level deliverables.

786
00:40:56,944 --> 00:41:00,846
They might own an entire milestone, or as we are in kind of the cycle now

787
00:41:01,006 --> 00:41:04,088
where we're producing content on a fairly regular basis,

788
00:41:04,108 --> 00:41:05,889
they might own one of those big game updates.

789
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:10,652
So they are a combination of a scheduled person making sure that things are on track,

790
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:12,673
but they also hold a little bit of the quality vision.

791
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:15,615
And they are the ones who are wrangling things at a very high level,

792
00:41:15,655 --> 00:41:19,137
making sure that QA is embedded, has a good test plan, etc.

793
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,420
Our DDs tend to own our pure tech initiatives.

794
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,081
Again, the DD within EA,

795
00:41:26,341 --> 00:41:29,323
frequently they are people who even have programmers reporting to them.

796
00:41:29,343 --> 00:41:30,864
So they have a very technical background.

797
00:41:31,184 --> 00:41:34,046
They're the ones who would actually run like some of our server initiatives.

798
00:41:34,086 --> 00:41:35,627
The things that the players don't actually see,

799
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:37,048
but it's how your game scales.

800
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:39,550
And if your game doesn't finish this sub-feature

801
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,171
that is entirely opaque to a paying customer...

802
00:41:42,572 --> 00:41:43,312
the game will crash.

803
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:46,593
And so we would give that type of initiative to our DDs.

804
00:41:46,973 --> 00:41:49,534
And then finally, we used our PMs as really the follow-up

805
00:41:49,554 --> 00:41:50,774
people, the detail trackers.

806
00:41:51,514 --> 00:41:53,595
And so we have more of the PMs than we

807
00:41:53,635 --> 00:41:54,595
have of the other two.

808
00:41:55,376 --> 00:41:57,876
And that's kind of how we cover all of the stuff that

809
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:59,657
we're doing, both on the content side and on the

810
00:41:59,697 --> 00:42:00,257
feature side.

811
00:42:01,558 --> 00:42:04,360
What we found, and this is obviously a cliche, everybody knows this,

812
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,141
communications is really, really hard.

813
00:42:06,542 --> 00:42:08,964
It's even harder when you're at the scale that we're talking about.

814
00:42:09,224 --> 00:42:11,526
It's still something that we don't do perfectly today,

815
00:42:11,586 --> 00:42:14,148
and so we have to be really, really careful.

816
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:15,889
We have to pay attention at all times

817
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,831
to the way in which our different communication methods

818
00:42:19,192 --> 00:42:20,453
are either succeeding or failing.

819
00:42:20,473 --> 00:42:22,394
We actually have a communications strike team,

820
00:42:22,634 --> 00:42:25,036
and part of what they do is they actually watch email lists.

821
00:42:26,037 --> 00:42:29,461
If you just sort of do a query on all the email lists that have ever been created because someone says,

822
00:42:29,521 --> 00:42:31,022
oh, we have a meeting that happens once a week.

823
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:33,265
We should have an email list for everybody who attends that meeting.

824
00:42:33,285 --> 00:42:34,466
We can talk about all that stuff.

825
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:39,511
And these people actually track whether or not those email lists are being used anymore,

826
00:42:39,972 --> 00:42:41,413
whether they're being actively managed.

827
00:42:41,914 --> 00:42:45,876
Whether people have started sort of concatenating Frankenstein email lists.

828
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:47,858
This is a list of this list, list, list, list, list.

829
00:42:48,758 --> 00:42:51,040
Because what we're trying to do is we're trying to eliminate spam.

830
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:56,764
You can't eliminate it entirely, but as a producer, I get so much email I can't even talk about it.

831
00:42:57,084 --> 00:43:00,166
I would like that not to be true for the people who are actually individual contributors,

832
00:43:00,186 --> 00:43:01,768
who have a real skill set, because I don't have one.

833
00:43:02,768 --> 00:43:03,749
So we do that a lot.

834
00:43:04,469 --> 00:43:04,810
Meetings.

835
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:10,193
This is pure Agile methodology, but it's something that we really try to push on all meetings that are going on.

836
00:43:10,253 --> 00:43:13,056
If you have a meeting that does not have an agenda, does not have a timekeeper, and does

837
00:43:13,096 --> 00:43:16,098
not have action items that comes out of it, it's a failed meeting.

838
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:18,721
And we really push that hard.

839
00:43:19,201 --> 00:43:24,125
I try to, any time I'm in a meeting, if nobody is fulfilling those rules, I jump into it

840
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:27,488
to say, hey, I just want us to clarify, what is the purpose of this meeting?

841
00:43:27,668 --> 00:43:31,391
Does anybody actually know, or are we just kind of sitting here and, you know, wool gathering?

842
00:43:32,212 --> 00:43:35,116
And then finally, the wikis, this is just a funny thing.

843
00:43:35,156 --> 00:43:38,380
When you have a team this size, all of us are vaguely

844
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,221
technically apt.

845
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:41,464
People start building wikis, because it's a really cool way

846
00:43:41,504 --> 00:43:42,805
to have information that can be shared.

847
00:43:43,186 --> 00:43:46,550
We had, at one point in time, three different software

848
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,533
packages running different wikis.

849
00:43:49,374 --> 00:43:52,916
uh... so like you know that someone's like oh we're gonna use that we use this

850
00:43:52,996 --> 00:43:56,879
one word it it was ridiculous and and and they would not link and one would

851
00:43:56,899 --> 00:43:59,921
just it's a new it's like a the sad blogs were personally i was a blog and

852
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:02,383
they would like right one blog post in six years later you look back at it

853
00:44:02,663 --> 00:44:04,024
but we have those wikis and so

854
00:44:04,324 --> 00:44:07,566
that the same communication team does that as well that and that's brutal by

855
00:44:07,586 --> 00:44:08,247
i i i hate that

856
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:13,651
But, and this is, these are people in my production structure who also have day jobs.

857
00:44:13,891 --> 00:44:16,853
This is the thing they do for fun, because they're that kind of mentality.

858
00:44:16,994 --> 00:44:17,854
That's what producers do.

859
00:44:18,074 --> 00:44:19,315
They're like, I'm gonna go clean up all the wikis.

860
00:44:19,335 --> 00:44:20,817
And I'm like, please, that's awesome.

861
00:44:21,417 --> 00:44:23,839
Yeah, please tell your therapist I'm sorry.

862
00:44:25,779 --> 00:44:30,585
We also have changed our tools several times, and we've done so explicitly because we found

863
00:44:30,605 --> 00:44:34,469
that at this scale, certain tools were great for one purpose, they were not great for another.

864
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:39,736
In the last six months, or a little bit more than that, of the project, we stopped using

865
00:44:39,776 --> 00:44:40,297
HandSoft.

866
00:44:40,497 --> 00:44:44,642
Again, we were an agile company before that, but we found that

867
00:44:45,403 --> 00:44:48,565
We were so much into the triaging of bugs,

868
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:50,827
that that was a significant portion of our work,

869
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,569
that even though we still had some new work, new feature work,

870
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:58,873
working in those two different places was sort of schizophrenic for our developers.

871
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:01,775
So we just stopped using it. I mean, we didn't stop using it entirely.

872
00:45:01,815 --> 00:45:06,159
Some people who had longer-soaked projects still going were still living in HandSoft.

873
00:45:06,779 --> 00:45:11,523
But everybody else, significant, probably 75% of the studio, just started living in DevTrack.

874
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:18,985
and we kind of Frankenstein dev track to support new dev as well as bug tracking.

875
00:45:19,286 --> 00:45:23,827
It wasn't a perfect solution, but it was something that we had to do at the stage of the project we were in.

876
00:45:23,867 --> 00:45:28,329
We couldn't rely on the integration of HandSoft with our bug tracking software.

877
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:30,750
It wasn't ideal, and I've been told that it's gotten better,

878
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:34,051
and so we're kind of reassessing now because we've changed what we're working on.

879
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:37,552
But as we finaled the game, we had to do this, and it was a big change for people.

880
00:45:39,193 --> 00:45:47,175
Changing processes. This is the thing that probably, you know, there are probably little dolls of me in the studio that have just needles right through the eye.

881
00:45:47,615 --> 00:45:55,217
Because I do this all the time. I take my team and we look at what our processes are and we say, where are we failing?

882
00:45:55,597 --> 00:46:01,519
Where are we running into sort of repeated fails? We have bugs that keep creeping back in, even though we know we fixed them.

883
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:05,580
We're going to fix that process. We're going to change that process. The processes change a lot.

884
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:14,565
At some point in time, I'm sort of hoping that the studio will understand that iterative development of a game also means iterative development of processes.

885
00:46:14,966 --> 00:46:17,848
And that's actually healthy. You need to embrace the change.

886
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:24,812
It's not there yet. There are a lot of people who are very, very resistant and upset whenever we change a process.

887
00:46:24,872 --> 00:46:27,814
And they write giant screeds against, like,

888
00:46:27,874 --> 00:46:29,515
Every time we change a process it ruins...

889
00:46:30,275 --> 00:46:31,476
Jesus killed a baby or whatever.

890
00:46:31,616 --> 00:46:33,416
They just blow it out of there.

891
00:46:33,817 --> 00:46:36,357
It's crazy talk, but it is a cultural thing

892
00:46:36,417 --> 00:46:38,858
that I'm trying to make sure our studio understands.

893
00:46:39,058 --> 00:46:40,279
You have to change your processes,

894
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:42,780
especially when you're at this scale.

895
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:43,900
So we're just gonna talk a little bit

896
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,980
about production methodologies,

897
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,701
because we didn't do the standard thing here.

898
00:46:47,315 --> 00:46:51,940
No, so one of the things we realized too is again, we started out agile, but one of the

899
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,626
things as we started getting into production, we realized that not all things fit one package

900
00:46:56,666 --> 00:47:02,652
or style of development, production development. So, project management basically. So what

901
00:47:02,672 --> 00:47:05,095
we did is we said, okay, we knew things like

902
00:47:05,715 --> 00:47:08,317
writing and VO worked very well with Waterfall, because

903
00:47:08,337 --> 00:47:11,658
they're very predictable, very much a lockstep process.

904
00:47:11,898 --> 00:47:16,081
We also knew that we wanted to make sure that we developed a

905
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:19,722
process for art and our world design that time boxed,

906
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:22,844
resource managed, and also looked for.

907
00:47:23,144 --> 00:47:26,587
efficiencies to make sure that we can get things done in a timely manner so that we

908
00:47:26,607 --> 00:47:30,971
can get our game done and iterate it on because iteration, to be honest with you, was our

909
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:36,475
most important driver. We had to find ways and systems that we can go in and check our

910
00:47:36,515 --> 00:47:41,159
work to make sure it was viable in an area. So we wanted to make sure we had enough time

911
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:44,922
to iterate on everything we built. So we used lean process for that.

912
00:47:46,878 --> 00:47:48,399
We used for software development.

913
00:47:48,919 --> 00:47:51,541
It worked very well for Agile, so we kept Agile for

914
00:47:51,561 --> 00:47:52,181
software development.

915
00:47:52,201 --> 00:47:54,943
So our core tech and features were all Agile driven.

916
00:47:56,484 --> 00:47:59,085
And so what we learned is there's not one size that fit

917
00:47:59,205 --> 00:48:00,366
all at the scale we're working at.

918
00:48:00,386 --> 00:48:02,487
We use multiple different processes.

919
00:48:02,927 --> 00:48:05,609
I said whatever teams work, whatever you use work and you

920
00:48:05,629 --> 00:48:07,250
can track it right, it's fine.

921
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,471
We did say that we used Hands-Off.

922
00:48:09,491 --> 00:48:11,713
We actually used Hands-Off all the way through a lot of the

923
00:48:11,753 --> 00:48:12,313
processes.

924
00:48:13,354 --> 00:48:18,440
We did go to BugTrack, DevTrack for triaging bugs down, but the

925
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,303
burndowns were our most valuable unit in our Hands-Off

926
00:48:21,343 --> 00:48:23,505
to tell us how we're doing above the line or below the

927
00:48:23,545 --> 00:48:24,887
line when we're talking about tasks.

928
00:48:25,247 --> 00:48:27,610
That's where Hands-Off came in very good as a tool.

929
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:30,754
Your burndowns tell you a lot, whether you have to crunch or

930
00:48:30,854 --> 00:48:32,816
things are not working very well, you're not hitting your

931
00:48:32,836 --> 00:48:33,137
deadline.

932
00:48:33,197 --> 00:48:36,499
But again, the point here is, and I don't think this is even necessarily about this scale.

933
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:41,003
It's probably something that I'm going to take with me no matter what scale of project I work on in the future.

934
00:48:41,643 --> 00:48:45,226
I used to be very strict about, like, we're choosing one production methodology

935
00:48:45,286 --> 00:48:48,049
and everyone is going to follow that methodology because it's the methodology.

936
00:48:48,089 --> 00:48:49,290
It's how we're going to make our game work.

937
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:53,733
And that didn't work for us here, and we started to, we started to sort of pick and choose

938
00:48:53,773 --> 00:48:55,735
the proper tool for the proper type of pipeline.

939
00:48:56,015 --> 00:48:58,737
And I'm probably going to do that in the future, regardless of whether I'm working on

940
00:48:59,077 --> 00:49:02,520
another gigantic game like this, or I'm working on something smaller.

941
00:49:03,379 --> 00:49:06,521
So one of the things we learned, and this is what Dallas is going to talk about, is

942
00:49:07,062 --> 00:49:09,684
the triage process and how important it is.

943
00:49:10,425 --> 00:49:11,666
Sometimes it's hard to fix a lightsaber.

944
00:49:12,927 --> 00:49:14,729
So this is where we get into metaphor and stuff.

945
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:16,151
Anybody know who Colonel John Boyd is?

946
00:49:16,291 --> 00:49:16,731
Raise your hand.

947
00:49:16,851 --> 00:49:17,312
That's awesome.

948
00:49:17,592 --> 00:49:18,032
You probably don't.

949
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:22,076
So he actually wrote the book on fighter pilot strategy.

950
00:49:22,316 --> 00:49:23,938
There literally was not a book, and then he wrote it.

951
00:49:24,498 --> 00:49:26,720
It's what they actually use in Air Force training.

952
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:30,223
And he has a lot of cool shit in there, things about ailerons that I don't understand.

953
00:49:30,543 --> 00:49:33,525
But the core principle, or at least the core principle I took away from the book,

954
00:49:33,945 --> 00:49:38,648
is that he believes that the person who wins is the person who makes the most decisions fastest.

955
00:49:40,048 --> 00:49:43,511
The quality of your decision is obviously important, but that's sort of based on your experience.

956
00:49:43,551 --> 00:49:45,992
If you are an experienced person, you're going to make slightly better decisions.

957
00:49:46,492 --> 00:49:46,913
The real...

958
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:51,755
differentiator is whether or not you made enough decisions. If I made two really good decisions

959
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:57,337
and you made 18 decisions in that time frame, I'm probably dead. So true in dogfighting. I think

960
00:49:57,357 --> 00:50:02,580
it's also true in production, especially production at scale. The way that this is illustrated,

961
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,222
sort of the methodology that we try to sort of put throughout our studio, is this loop.

962
00:50:08,514 --> 00:50:13,096
You observe, you find a problem, you orient yourself and try and take in as much data as you possibly can,

963
00:50:13,396 --> 00:50:16,416
you decide what to do, and then you act immediately.

964
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:20,558
It kind of goes to that, what I was talking about with our production methodology is changing.

965
00:50:20,878 --> 00:50:22,378
We iterate all the time.

966
00:50:22,638 --> 00:50:24,299
And if you're not iterating all the time,

967
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,600
if you are either letting a decision that you made go for a long time,

968
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,520
because it must have been the right decision, we thought about it a lot,

969
00:50:30,481 --> 00:50:33,963
or you choose not to make a decision because you need to gather more data,

970
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:35,264
you're actually failing.

971
00:50:35,504 --> 00:50:37,746
You are allowing your project to go off the rails.

972
00:50:37,766 --> 00:50:38,987
And when a project is this big,

973
00:50:39,527 --> 00:50:43,350
we often talk about how hard it is to course correct in the Titanic,

974
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:45,011
or in a battleship.

975
00:50:45,892 --> 00:50:46,773
It's really, really hard.

976
00:50:47,153 --> 00:50:48,874
You need to be course correcting all the time.

977
00:50:50,115 --> 00:50:51,015
But this is what happens.

978
00:50:51,455 --> 00:50:55,096
These are some of the pitfalls and why people don't want to iterate quickly.

979
00:50:55,837 --> 00:50:58,437
This is very much on the tech side, people do this.

980
00:50:58,617 --> 00:51:01,358
What about the things that we don't know? We should R&D this for a while.

981
00:51:02,378 --> 00:51:06,240
And that's really sort of that observe, orient, decide, and act.

982
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,060
This is the orient stage, where people say,

983
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:11,481
we don't have enough data yet. We need to look more at this.

984
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:15,142
We need to decide, find out more, let's do some tests, let's do some R&D,

985
00:51:15,182 --> 00:51:16,763
let's do a little bit of prototyping over here.

986
00:51:18,063 --> 00:51:22,547
If you do that, if you allow your project to get stuck in that cycle,

987
00:51:22,967 --> 00:51:25,349
which is not the cycle of actual action,

988
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:29,453
you're going to A, sultify, and B, you're actually probably going to go off course,

989
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:30,794
because you're not deciding.

990
00:51:31,414 --> 00:51:34,176
We try very hard to get to action.

991
00:51:34,537 --> 00:51:36,458
Even if it's not necessarily the perfect solution,

992
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:39,141
start going, because we can always correct again.

993
00:51:40,362 --> 00:51:43,344
And it leads to this, which is a thing that you've probably seen in slideshows before,

994
00:51:43,384 --> 00:51:44,105
and so I threw it in there.

995
00:51:44,145 --> 00:51:45,106
It's the worst phrase ever.

996
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:45,866
I'm a terrible person.

997
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:51,853
The other piece, and this is kind of the flip side of that, that we found, is that history is very useful.

998
00:51:51,913 --> 00:51:57,756
Again, those of you who are project managers, you know that this is how you figure out a person or a team's actual velocity.

999
00:51:57,796 --> 00:52:01,178
How much work they can get done in time is based on their historical velocity.

1000
00:52:01,478 --> 00:52:02,279
Really, really important.

1001
00:52:02,899 --> 00:52:05,140
Where history starts to become a problem...

1002
00:52:06,026 --> 00:52:07,387
is in the postmortem process.

1003
00:52:08,207 --> 00:52:10,868
I have been in postmortems, and it's certainly even on this project,

1004
00:52:11,149 --> 00:52:12,629
postmortems that last a day.

1005
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:18,032
And you come out of it with a list of 45 action items.

1006
00:52:18,612 --> 00:52:20,593
And guess what? Nobody ever does them.

1007
00:52:21,153 --> 00:52:23,535
You spend a full day of a lot of people's time

1008
00:52:23,635 --> 00:52:24,875
kind of analyzing and saying,

1009
00:52:24,915 --> 00:52:27,096
what would have been the perfect way to have done that?

1010
00:52:27,116 --> 00:52:28,777
And you know what we should do? We should look at this.

1011
00:52:29,337 --> 00:52:31,218
And that is not useful.

1012
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:35,941
As a rule of thumb, again, I like postmortems to be an hour long.

1013
00:52:36,181 --> 00:52:38,002
If it's more than that, it's actually two postmortems.

1014
00:52:38,162 --> 00:52:39,802
You need to figure out how to break it apart into

1015
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:42,604
these people should talk about this system that needs postmorteming,

1016
00:52:42,624 --> 00:52:45,745
these people need to talk about this system or methodology that needs postmorteming.

1017
00:52:45,905 --> 00:52:48,267
If you come out of it with more than three or four action items,

1018
00:52:48,507 --> 00:52:49,287
you're not going to do them.

1019
00:52:49,387 --> 00:52:52,048
It's just the list is too long, and you won't get them scheduled,

1020
00:52:52,088 --> 00:52:53,569
and other stuff will come up.

1021
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:58,352
And again, this is really the other end of rule gathering.

1022
00:52:58,612 --> 00:53:01,074
if you're doing this for too long, you're not

1023
00:53:01,234 --> 00:53:04,037
actually observing the new problem yet. You're sitting there

1024
00:53:04,417 --> 00:53:07,080
between having acted and then finding what the new

1025
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,702
problem is and to, to, to make, to make

1026
00:53:09,842 --> 00:53:10,383
changes for.

1027
00:53:10,943 --> 00:53:12,425
So the big deal here, and this is true

1028
00:53:12,505 --> 00:53:15,067
of all, of all projects, not just projects of

1029
00:53:15,107 --> 00:53:16,709
this size and scale, is that it's hard to

1030
00:53:16,749 --> 00:53:17,229
ship a game.

1031
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:20,572
There are all sorts of things that get in your way, things that can derail you.

1032
00:53:21,552 --> 00:53:25,395
At this scale, it's a longer road, so there are many, many more of them.

1033
00:53:26,135 --> 00:53:29,917
And so what we try to, again, keep our mentality about that iterative process,

1034
00:53:30,578 --> 00:53:32,619
because you want to solve your problems as quickly as you can,

1035
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:34,740
and you always have to keep your eye on the goal,

1036
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,682
which in this case is roadside assistance for the dude who went off the road.

1037
00:53:38,863 --> 00:53:45,608
The goal is to make a great game. It is to make the best game you possibly can with your resources, your time, and your budget.

1038
00:53:45,748 --> 00:53:52,053
We are aiming for the AAA title, the AAA sized MMO, but it's the same methodology here wherever you are.

1039
00:53:52,253 --> 00:53:56,596
You need to identify those problems and iterate as quickly as you possibly can. Don't let them sit.

1040
00:53:58,612 --> 00:54:02,675
These are different tiers of our triage process that we're going to just kind of talk through a little bit of.

1041
00:54:03,175 --> 00:54:08,258
So one of the things we did is when we first did Agile development, no one ever talked about the roadmap.

1042
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:12,241
They always talked about what's in front of them or the backlog.

1043
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:13,582
No one really put it all together.

1044
00:54:13,922 --> 00:54:18,365
And so one of the things I had to do is I kind of thought about it, you know, when you do Agile,

1045
00:54:18,385 --> 00:54:22,588
you're so close to the weeds that you don't see where you're going sometimes before it's too late.

1046
00:54:23,008 --> 00:54:24,489
So what we did is we developed a...

1047
00:54:26,271 --> 00:54:31,699
a release schedule, I call it, which where every six months we look at our current backlog

1048
00:54:31,779 --> 00:54:34,803
and put it together in a release schedule for what we want to do.

1049
00:54:34,884 --> 00:54:38,589
This is number one to get rid of the risk that we talk about in this project, do them

1050
00:54:38,669 --> 00:54:40,512
up front and early, prototype.

1051
00:54:40,892 --> 00:54:44,915
develop things that we can get the unknowns known fast as we

1052
00:54:44,975 --> 00:54:45,255
can.

1053
00:54:45,596 --> 00:54:47,957
So what we did is, in the first release, we did our first

1054
00:54:48,017 --> 00:54:49,398
playable as our first release.

1055
00:54:49,418 --> 00:54:50,499
It was six months of work.

1056
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,980
We broke it all down.

1057
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,602
We figured out that after the end of six months, we had a

1058
00:54:54,662 --> 00:54:57,544
playable deliverable called the first playable of our game.

1059
00:54:57,964 --> 00:55:00,286
And what we did is we took vertical slices of different

1060
00:55:00,326 --> 00:55:03,048
things that are risky, and we put them into a six-month

1061
00:55:03,108 --> 00:55:03,568
cadence.

1062
00:55:04,409 --> 00:55:06,890
And in that cadence, we basically had

1063
00:55:07,231 --> 00:55:08,371
seven-week milestones.

1064
00:55:09,152 --> 00:55:12,655
The 17 milestones were made up of two sprints of three weeks in duration.

1065
00:55:13,155 --> 00:55:15,938
So, it then led to a six-month- And a bug fix week.

1066
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:17,799
And a bug fix week. That's how you get to seven.

1067
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,722
And the bug fix week is when you pull everything and you do the integration.

1068
00:55:21,783 --> 00:55:23,584
We know integration, by the way, takes longer.

1069
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:27,407
So, that's why we do two sprints, because we integrate at the end of sprint one

1070
00:55:27,427 --> 00:55:28,848
and we integrate at the end of sprint two.

1071
00:55:29,469 --> 00:55:34,073
And we also, when we put it all together for release, we actually bug fix it.

1072
00:55:34,653 --> 00:55:34,753
And

1073
00:55:35,986 --> 00:55:38,509
We also did something at the near the end of the project.

1074
00:55:38,689 --> 00:55:39,870
We formed a DevStar.

1075
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:42,633
The DevStar is where the director of Gantt,

1076
00:55:42,653 --> 00:55:44,756
where all the top tiers you saw

1077
00:55:44,796 --> 00:55:46,217
in that first organizational chart

1078
00:55:46,257 --> 00:55:47,559
were sitting in the room together.

1079
00:55:47,979 --> 00:55:50,061
And what we did is we brought everyone to us

1080
00:55:50,302 --> 00:55:51,543
to explain where they are.

1081
00:55:51,903 --> 00:55:53,845
In the background of our room,

1082
00:55:53,865 --> 00:55:56,328
we had a board that was like 20 feet across.

1083
00:55:56,849 --> 00:56:01,253
and had magnetic strips of different things that were outlining what we needed to do to

1084
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:02,133
final our game.

1085
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:03,735
And they were tracked daily.

1086
00:56:03,775 --> 00:56:08,139
We were moved across the board daily by the PMs and the producers that were responsible

1087
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:10,021
for the different strike teams we had going on.

1088
00:56:10,321 --> 00:56:14,385
Remember, if you have 15 people on a strike team, we have up to 40 strike teams running

1089
00:56:14,425 --> 00:56:15,085
at the same time.

1090
00:56:15,446 --> 00:56:19,489
So we had to make sure all that was gathering together, and we had this huge punch list

1091
00:56:19,529 --> 00:56:20,971
that were on the walls at different

1092
00:56:21,251 --> 00:56:26,096
groups that would come into the Death Star and present where they are and we did this

1093
00:56:26,456 --> 00:56:30,360
every single day before we launched. Like four or five months out we went into this

1094
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,824
plan which really helped us. Everyone was together, they came to us and they went to

1095
00:56:34,884 --> 00:56:39,388
us and explained where we are and we triaged in that room. That's including bug fixing

1096
00:56:39,448 --> 00:56:39,568
too.

1097
00:56:40,289 --> 00:56:46,372
Now, the six-week or seven-week plan gave us the resolution that we needed to do the

1098
00:56:46,432 --> 00:56:49,574
three weeks, that we needed to do the daily triages that we had.

1099
00:56:49,954 --> 00:56:52,695
All this was running concurrently until we finished the game.

1100
00:56:53,315 --> 00:56:55,797
And really the whole point is that each scale here you have to be cutting.

1101
00:56:56,317 --> 00:56:59,261
You have to be triaging. You say, hey, this is our six-month plan.

1102
00:57:00,423 --> 00:57:02,065
Looks like we're going to miss something.

1103
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:05,570
We need to actually talk about a major feature or a major piece of content

1104
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:08,494
that is not going to make it. And if you're disciplined, you actually cut it.

1105
00:57:08,895 --> 00:57:11,759
Or if you're undisciplined and are working on an MMO where you can do shit later,

1106
00:57:11,779 --> 00:57:12,880
which is what we did a lot of, you're like...

1107
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,404
it in the backlog, that's post launch content. But you need to at least do that, you need

1108
00:57:17,424 --> 00:57:21,908
to take it off the table. And we do that at each of these steps when we're doing our seven

1109
00:57:21,948 --> 00:57:25,972
week plan, our milestone plan. What do we want to do? Oh wait, it's twice as much as

1110
00:57:26,012 --> 00:57:30,656
we actually have time for. Now can we actually cut this stuff? Can we really cut it? Let's

1111
00:57:30,736 --> 00:57:34,419
really cut it if we can. We were pretty brutal about this, certainly during the finaling.

1112
00:57:34,439 --> 00:57:37,801
Yeah, it's very important to cut your babies in half early and often.

1113
00:57:38,141 --> 00:57:41,703
And it's very important to also make sure that you don't do nice to haves, right?

1114
00:57:41,983 --> 00:57:43,484
That's what everyone wants to have.

1115
00:57:43,524 --> 00:57:46,306
We made people cry in Death Storm many times because of that.

1116
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:47,386
And the reason we do this...

1117
00:57:47,406 --> 00:57:48,247
You're saying that like he enjoyed it.

1118
00:57:48,347 --> 00:57:48,707
Yeah, I did.

1119
00:57:48,727 --> 00:57:49,568
Because he enjoyed it.

1120
00:57:49,848 --> 00:57:52,789
Because I just love them because you see how upset they get.

1121
00:57:52,809 --> 00:57:53,170
They're so...

1122
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:53,590
They...

1123
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:55,551
I gotta have this feature in or we're gonna die.

1124
00:57:55,911 --> 00:57:56,291
No, you're not.

1125
00:57:57,092 --> 00:57:59,374
Just give me that particular feature and we'll see where we are.

1126
00:57:59,655 --> 00:58:02,878
But the issue is, is everyone's passionate about their systems, we understand that.

1127
00:58:03,078 --> 00:58:07,022
But at a high level, you have to triage, you have to triage often to make your goals.

1128
00:58:07,303 --> 00:58:09,665
The problem with agile development, a lot of times I've seen,

1129
00:58:09,925 --> 00:58:12,748
is you put everything in the backlog that you can't make in the milestones,

1130
00:58:12,968 --> 00:58:16,712
you don't realize how big your backlog is because you're not looking at it all the time, and it's huge.

1131
00:58:16,772 --> 00:58:17,773
You're epics, by the way.

1132
00:58:18,214 --> 00:58:22,296
can be very huge. So we realized, especially in the scale and the time frame that we're working in,

1133
00:58:22,616 --> 00:58:26,699
we really had to manage that closely. To the end, we actually did daily triage because it

1134
00:58:26,739 --> 00:58:31,101
really was about bug fixing at that point. So we basically said, what's our A's and B's,

1135
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:36,604
what's our C's and D's, what are we going to put in this particular build for beta testing

1136
00:58:36,864 --> 00:58:40,146
that we would want to do? And we actually did that on a daily basis.

1137
00:58:40,387 --> 00:58:41,567
We actually do something that's interesting.

1138
00:58:41,587 --> 00:58:44,629
We do a tiered triage, again, with a team this big.

1139
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:47,791
We have actually had to give ownership of not just the work

1140
00:58:47,811 --> 00:58:49,892
that's being done in a particular sprint, but actually

1141
00:58:50,112 --> 00:58:53,194
the bug backlog on those strike teams we mentioned before.

1142
00:58:53,314 --> 00:58:56,676
So the QA lead in that strike team, the product owner of

1143
00:58:56,716 --> 00:58:59,698
whatever that feature or piece of content is, and the

1144
00:58:59,938 --> 00:59:02,880
producer or project manager who's assigned, it's their job

1145
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,441
to keep that prioritized and actually keep people burning

1146
00:59:05,521 --> 00:59:05,822
through it.

1147
00:59:06,262 --> 00:59:09,024
We had some teams that were very good at that, some teams that were less good at that.

1148
00:59:09,064 --> 00:59:16,969
And it really kind of had to do with how strong the producer was and whether or not their actual product owner or lead had that sort of triage mentality.

1149
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:24,494
And so their job was to keep that stuff going as much as possible and then raise up to us in the Death Star any place where they needed sort of a higher level call.

1150
00:59:24,514 --> 00:59:28,976
Where they're like, well, we can't get this done in this sprint right now, but I think you guys really want it. Do you?

1151
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:32,386
and they bring that to us and so that would be the next year of the triage and

1152
00:59:32,426 --> 00:59:33,570
we would do that also

1153
00:59:33,911 --> 00:59:36,760
on a daily basis is sort of the second year of the stuff that bubble popped.

1154
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:40,522
It's really important, we didn't have enough time to talk about this, what done means.

1155
00:59:40,682 --> 00:59:44,485
Done in a lot of different areas means acceptance by a product owner in QA.

1156
00:59:44,985 --> 00:59:47,988
It's really important because a lot of people think done means something else.

1157
00:59:48,508 --> 00:59:49,709
And it's really done in phases.

1158
00:59:49,849 --> 00:59:52,031
A lot of times things don't fit in a perfect milestone.

1159
00:59:52,632 --> 00:59:54,013
I wish we had time to talk about that.

1160
00:59:54,053 --> 00:59:57,976
But the key thing here is about cutting and scoping all the time.

1161
00:59:58,496 --> 01:00:01,259
It's important to think about everything is on the table.

1162
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:07,401
except for your core. You got to look at your core, always evaluate what you're cutting to how it affects your core.

1163
01:00:07,582 --> 01:00:11,443
There are certain core features you have to launch with or you're not competitive.

1164
01:00:11,463 --> 01:00:14,705
You always have to look about how it affects your core all the time.

1165
01:00:15,105 --> 01:00:20,807
And what your core, all the requirements that are affecting your core have to make your decisions in triage.

1166
01:00:21,127 --> 01:00:25,810
And then again, cutting the nice to haves early and often are key to doing good triage.

1167
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,290
And triage is really what breaks.

1168
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:32,174
In my opinion, the low quality games, it separates them from the low quality games to the high

1169
01:00:32,234 --> 01:00:32,794
quality games.

1170
01:00:33,415 --> 01:00:37,698
And again, what is this all about, to be very honest with you, what we've all been talking

1171
01:00:37,738 --> 01:00:42,282
about for the past 30 minutes, it's about scope, quality, resources, time and how you

1172
01:00:42,302 --> 01:00:46,925
balance that out through especially a project that took five years to build, how you balance

1173
01:00:46,945 --> 01:00:50,108
that out to get done and not dabble all the time.

1174
01:00:50,548 --> 01:00:51,689
It's all about tradeoffs.

1175
01:00:51,969 --> 01:00:53,710
It really, really is.

1176
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:56,891
You always have to constantly do tradeoffs all the way through

1177
01:00:56,911 --> 01:00:59,391
your development process, from the beginning to the end, to

1178
01:00:59,571 --> 01:01:01,892
make sure that you balance against what your core feature

1179
01:01:01,932 --> 01:01:04,953
set is, making sure that your vision of the game is always

1180
01:01:05,013 --> 01:01:07,394
stayed through, and make sure you're competitive and

1181
01:01:07,434 --> 01:01:09,394
differentiated at launch, and have a

1182
01:01:09,534 --> 01:01:11,295
quality launch experience.

1183
01:01:11,315 --> 01:01:14,016
And we didn't touch about, that's a whole topic all

1184
01:01:14,056 --> 01:01:15,996
together, is how to make a smooth MMO launch.

1185
01:01:16,716 --> 01:01:20,317
The things we did were all based on this thing about

1186
01:01:20,337 --> 01:01:21,538
scope, quality, and consistency.

1187
01:01:21,758 --> 01:01:25,963
Trade-offs we had to do, resources and time we had to do, and all the balancing act that we did.

1188
01:01:26,303 --> 01:01:27,525
And that's what brought us together.

1189
01:01:28,406 --> 01:01:30,949
So we are running over a little bit, but this is the last session.

1190
01:01:31,209 --> 01:01:33,071
We actually have a little bit more time.

1191
01:01:33,572 --> 01:01:36,796
So if people want to ask us questions, please feel free to come up and answer.

1192
01:01:37,377 --> 01:01:37,637
Thanks.

1193
01:01:37,937 --> 01:01:38,178
Thank you.
