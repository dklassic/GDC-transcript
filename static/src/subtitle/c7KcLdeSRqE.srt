1
00:00:05,982 --> 00:00:08,203
All right, so while the final few file in,

2
00:00:08,804 --> 00:00:10,885
thank you all for coming at this ungodly hour.

3
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,786
I've been at this thing for five days, and I'm tired.

4
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:15,287
I guess most of you are too.

5
00:00:16,247 --> 00:00:17,948
Before I get started, just a quick show of hands.

6
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:20,729
Who here is working on their own game or on an indie game?

7
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,250
All right, excellent.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,251
That's most of you, and that's sort of the audience

9
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:25,351
for this thing, as am I.

10
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:26,192
I am an indie.

11
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,213
I'll get back to that in a second.

12
00:00:28,313 --> 00:00:30,514
All right, let's get started.

13
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:33,435
If you're an indie, you may have seen this,

14
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:34,596
but you don't want to end up with it.

15
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:41,538
It's still so good.

16
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:45,441
Like just the timing and the pacing of it is perfect,

17
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:48,243
and it's so sad, and you want to avoid that.

18
00:00:48,323 --> 00:00:49,304
We all want to avoid that.

19
00:00:49,804 --> 00:00:53,167
And I mean, if you want to avoid that, what you have to do

20
00:00:53,227 --> 00:00:54,268
is you have to sell your game.

21
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:56,330
That's basically the heart of it.

22
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,491
If you want to make money, you have to sell your game.

23
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,654
But if you're an indie or a small team,

24
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:03,795
it's not really about selling your game.

25
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,817
It's much more about selling yourself.

26
00:01:06,623 --> 00:01:08,725
You are usually your own marketing team,

27
00:01:09,105 --> 00:01:11,247
and you're a key part of the game and its story

28
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:12,308
and its development story.

29
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:15,711
So you need to figure out how to sell yourself.

30
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:18,253
But it's not only just selling yourself.

31
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,295
It's actually selling yourself to strangers,

32
00:01:21,755 --> 00:01:24,057
people that don't know you and don't know your game

33
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:24,838
and probably don't care.

34
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:26,679
So that's pretty scary.

35
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,942
So hi, I'm Martin.

36
00:01:30,502 --> 00:01:32,924
I'm going to spend the next couple minutes diving

37
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:33,424
into all of that.

38
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:35,326
Before I do that, though, a little bit of context.

39
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,701
I'm a German indie.

40
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:40,502
I've been making games since the early days of Quake 1,

41
00:01:40,662 --> 00:01:41,323
doing some modding.

42
00:01:41,983 --> 00:01:43,984
I've been in the industry since 2008.

43
00:01:44,184 --> 00:01:46,145
I've been working on indie since 2012.

44
00:01:46,245 --> 00:01:48,285
And I've been working on my current project,

45
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:51,607
Noir Prophet, which I'll use for a bunch of examples.

46
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:53,087
I've been working on it since 2012.

47
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,089
Back then it looked like, since 2014, back then it

48
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:59,150
looked like this, then like this, and now like this.

49
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,891
So 2014 to now, that's almost four years.

50
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:04,952
So that's a lot of time for conferences.

51
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:07,823
and a lot of exhibitions.

52
00:02:07,923 --> 00:02:10,245
What I want to do is, in the next couple of minutes,

53
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:13,547
I want to help you find your strangers and talk to them.

54
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,529
So that said, you have a game.

55
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,451
That's a big pile of work.

56
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:21,412
That's hard to do.

57
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:22,833
But what do you do next?

58
00:02:22,953 --> 00:02:24,114
You want to get it out to people.

59
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:26,415
You can do social media marketing,

60
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:27,056
all this kind of thing.

61
00:02:27,136 --> 00:02:28,537
But if you want to really meet them,

62
00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:31,418
the first thing that comes to mind is, yeah, let's get a booth.

63
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,065
And booths are awesome.

64
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:35,587
There's a lot of opportunities for indies to get on a booth.

65
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:38,069
There's a lot of joint booths, like the Indie Mega

66
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:39,290
booth or the Indie Arena booth.

67
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,352
There's joint showcases like the Day of the Death, which

68
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:44,313
is here at GDC, or like Dutch Courage.

69
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:46,115
And these are all really great.

70
00:02:46,395 --> 00:02:48,296
They have huge advantages in the sense

71
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:51,298
that because you're constantly physically present on site,

72
00:02:51,478 --> 00:02:52,679
you have a lot of exposure.

73
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,641
Also, because they usually use joint affairs,

74
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:57,342
it gives it a sense of credibility,

75
00:02:57,543 --> 00:02:58,783
like you're part of this larger thing.

76
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:03,179
And also, another really important advantage

77
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,901
from going to these things is you

78
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:06,922
get to do networking with all the devs around you.

79
00:03:07,662 --> 00:03:10,384
You're in the trenches together, spending a lot of time

80
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,805
just crunching and standing there next to each other.

81
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,466
And that's a really valuable thing.

82
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:16,828
But you're here.

83
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:18,669
You've read the session description.

84
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:19,690
Sorry, German.

85
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,271
So all of the things are going to be jumbled.

86
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:24,593
You know I'm not going to talk about booths.

87
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:27,515
But I want to talk about the downsides of having a booth.

88
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:28,655
And I mean.

89
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:32,057
The obvious one is, it's going to be expensive.

90
00:03:32,757 --> 00:03:34,278
These things cost upwards of 1,000K

91
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,679
for a small kind of thing in sort of a joint booth,

92
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,800
and runs you to 3 to 5K for a bigger area.

93
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,961
Obviously, longer events usually cost more,

94
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,442
and shorter events may cost a little bit less,

95
00:03:46,902 --> 00:03:47,962
but it's gonna be expensive.

96
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:49,423
It's gonna take some money.

97
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:51,864
That's the obvious one.

98
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:54,584
But also, if you're a small team in India,

99
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:56,505
God forbid, like me, you're doing this solo,

100
00:03:57,225 --> 00:03:59,026
going to a conference or to an exhibition.

101
00:03:59,703 --> 00:04:01,644
Manning a booth for three days, five days,

102
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:04,325
it's really, really exhausting.

103
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:05,145
It's hard work.

104
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,825
You stand there for eight hours, 10 hours,

105
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:08,606
on your feet, talking all day,

106
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:10,827
shouting over the speakers that are next door.

107
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:13,388
By the end of this, you're gonna feel like an old man.

108
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:14,328
I feel like an old man.

109
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:15,849
You will feel like an old person.

110
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,670
Your knees hurt, your legs hurt, your feet hurt,

111
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,390
your hips hurt, your throat sore.

112
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:21,931
It's really hard.

113
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:25,642
And also, booths aren't really for every game.

114
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:28,104
Some games benefit more from booths than others,

115
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:30,765
especially multiplayer games that sort of have visuals

116
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:31,965
that attract people more easily.

117
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:33,246
If you have a very slow game,

118
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:34,887
it'll be hard to pull in people.

119
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,528
I have a card game, Noir Prophet is a card game.

120
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:40,510
So what I have to do is I have to pull people to the booth

121
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,790
and go like, oh, do you like card games?

122
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,751
Come on, take a look,

123
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:44,892
because the game isn't as flashy and visual

124
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:45,993
that it's just being played,

125
00:04:46,313 --> 00:04:47,153
attracts people that much.

126
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:52,176
So, expensive, exhausting, and not for everybody.

127
00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:58,067
Then I found myself draining the budget

128
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:00,429
and draining my energy levels,

129
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:03,050
but I still wanted to get my game into the hands of people.

130
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,992
I had made some serious changes.

131
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:09,155
I just wanted to have people play, so what can you do?

132
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:13,137
I mean, you can just have no booth.

133
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:16,620
It may look a little bit lonely, but it's a lot of work.

134
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,202
All right, so what's the benefits of doing that?

135
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:21,863
I mean, the obvious one is it's cheaper.

136
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,684
You don't have to pay for the booth.

137
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:26,225
You don't have to pay for like roll-up banners,

138
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,506
or like, I don't know, custom t-shirts,

139
00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:29,847
though that you may still want to do.

140
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,949
But the important part is it's flexible.

141
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:35,610
You don't have to do 10 hours a day.

142
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,011
You don't have to do eight hours a day.

143
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:39,432
You don't have to stand in one place all the time.

144
00:05:40,713 --> 00:05:43,034
And that's really the key to this thing.

145
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:44,815
You can do as much as you want,

146
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:46,516
and you can do it where you want.

147
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:48,136
And doing it where you want means

148
00:05:49,157 --> 00:05:50,458
you can go to where your players are.

149
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:53,153
Wait, oh no, I'm looking at the wrong thing.

150
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,214
And if you look at this one.

151
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:56,956
So you can go to where your players are.

152
00:05:56,996 --> 00:05:58,858
This is one of my terrible selfies at Gamescom.

153
00:05:59,438 --> 00:06:01,060
I don't know why, but most of the selfies

154
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,341
have this very serious face.

155
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,203
I think, I guess I have resting bitch face.

156
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:07,926
I'm trying to get better.

157
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:10,368
I've started Instagramming and sort of upping my selfie game.

158
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:13,771
So, no more profit is a digital card game.

159
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:14,551
I'm at Gamescom.

160
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:16,293
Where the hell are my players?

161
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:19,257
The good thing about these really big events are

162
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:22,679
the players sort themselves just for your convenience.

163
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,260
So I mentioned it's a card game.

164
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:28,323
So my players are probably people that play other card games.

165
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:29,744
So what do you do?

166
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:32,886
You go to big booth of similar games

167
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:34,046
and you talk to the people there.

168
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:36,748
So what I did is another bitch face selfie.

169
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:39,510
It's hard to tell because the lighting is all terrible,

170
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,530
but that's Hearthstone.

171
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:44,783
And you meet people there that are standing in line,

172
00:06:45,063 --> 00:06:47,064
and they'll probably stand there for 30 minutes, an hour,

173
00:06:47,144 --> 00:06:48,165
depending on how long the line is.

174
00:06:48,205 --> 00:06:50,285
And they don't really have anything to do.

175
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:51,406
Like, they're bored.

176
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,786
They would like to be entertained.

177
00:06:52,806 --> 00:06:53,807
They would like to see something,

178
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:55,467
like to shorten their waiting time.

179
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:57,868
And that's, they welcome you.

180
00:06:58,068 --> 00:06:59,689
Like, they're really looking forward to somebody

181
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:00,709
to entertain them.

182
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:01,550
So that's what I did.

183
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,130
I went to Gamescom.

184
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:06,011
I talked to people in the queues for card games

185
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:07,752
and talked to them about my game.

186
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:09,193
And that's, that worked.

187
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:11,293
And that's what I'm gonna talk about.

188
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:15,005
So you can show off your game without a booth.

189
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:17,006
You do not need to spend thousands of dollars

190
00:07:17,206 --> 00:07:18,647
in getting this huge setup.

191
00:07:18,987 --> 00:07:21,088
It has its advantages, but sometimes it's

192
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:21,869
not what you want to do.

193
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,270
So let's get into the details.

194
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:29,713
OK, so I've sort of split this apart into three things.

195
00:07:30,174 --> 00:07:32,095
First one is the goals, the sort of things

196
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:33,816
you should think about before you get started,

197
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:35,817
the preparation, the sort of things

198
00:07:35,837 --> 00:07:37,518
you should do before you hit the show floor,

199
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:39,999
and the approach, what you do once you're there.

200
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:42,717
break for a drink.

201
00:07:46,338 --> 00:07:48,159
So, the goals.

202
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,441
It basically boils down to, why do you want to do this?

203
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:55,381
So you don't have a booth,

204
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:57,142
but you still want to show your game.

205
00:07:57,402 --> 00:07:58,423
And it's still going to cost you.

206
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:00,143
Like, this isn't going to be for free.

207
00:08:00,403 --> 00:08:01,144
You still have to travel,

208
00:08:01,244 --> 00:08:02,364
you have to get the ticket for the event,

209
00:08:02,404 --> 00:08:03,565
you have to pay for accommodation.

210
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:06,185
It's gonna cost you time, energy, and money.

211
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:08,106
This is all stuff you could invest in your game.

212
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:10,087
So figuring out why you want to do this

213
00:08:10,187 --> 00:08:10,747
helps you sort of,

214
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:13,267
understand why you do this investment.

215
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,067
It'll also help you be more prepared.

216
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:18,448
Once you're on-site, there's a limited amount of time

217
00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:20,208
you have on-site, and you want to make as much of that

218
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:20,788
as possible.

219
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:24,929
And if you have sort of multiple goals,

220
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:26,549
it helps you to prioritize, so you know

221
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:28,690
which ones you can go first while you're still energized.

222
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,670
This is going to be a sort of strenuous, draining experience.

223
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,251
You're going to talk to people all the time.

224
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:35,511
For some, that's easier to do than for others,

225
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:37,131
but it still requires energy.

226
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:39,772
I'm going to come back to energy a couple times, I think.

227
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:42,705
So I'm going to go over a bunch of example goals.

228
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:45,945
I've seen myself and heard from others.

229
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,946
That's not an exhaustive list.

230
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,366
If you have any you want to talk about,

231
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,907
please do come up to the mic afterwards.

232
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:53,868
The first one is sort of obvious.

233
00:08:53,888 --> 00:08:54,428
We want all.

234
00:08:54,588 --> 00:08:55,448
We want exposure.

235
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,108
We want people and players to see our game.

236
00:08:57,148 --> 00:08:58,449
So press is a good multiplier.

237
00:08:58,969 --> 00:08:59,869
And that's a good idea.

238
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:02,070
There's a bunch of things you should

239
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,911
consider when you want to target press when you're at the event.

240
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:08,412
First off, it's probably a good idea to reach out beforehand.

241
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:11,079
If you've been to the talk prior to this,

242
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,561
reaching out to people beforehand will make them remember you

243
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:17,002
and sort of feel like they're more familiar to you.

244
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,844
However, if you're just a small studio,

245
00:09:20,024 --> 00:09:22,185
you're very unlikely to get a lot of feedback

246
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:24,507
from, like, big-name sort of news outlets.

247
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:26,088
Still, you should try.

248
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:30,130
Also, for press, really large events are really good

249
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,471
because there's going to be more press,

250
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,591
more different people to meet.

251
00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:36,033
And also, these large events usually have sort of...

252
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,272
press days or specific press areas

253
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:39,412
that you can hang out at.

254
00:09:41,432 --> 00:09:43,253
When you meet press, it's also really important

255
00:09:43,393 --> 00:09:44,793
that you have something they can remember you by.

256
00:09:45,214 --> 00:09:47,794
They go to these shows to see a lot of games,

257
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:49,635
and yours is just one of a lot of them.

258
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:52,456
So try and give them something that they can remember you.

259
00:09:53,396 --> 00:09:55,757
Also, you should definitely have a press kit in place.

260
00:09:56,717 --> 00:09:58,098
There's a lot of solutions for press kits,

261
00:09:58,118 --> 00:09:59,798
sort of like do press kit or differently.

262
00:10:00,178 --> 00:10:02,419
And making a press kit is sort of its own talk.

263
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:05,140
Just know that it's.

264
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,921
easier than it looks, but you may want to consider

265
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:10,141
investing more energy in making a sort of custom thing,

266
00:10:12,202 --> 00:10:14,242
because it may make your game stand out a little bit more.

267
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,562
But again, it's more work.

268
00:10:16,543 --> 00:10:18,623
But in the end, when you want to go and meet press,

269
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:22,244
keep in mind press are there for stories.

270
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:24,964
You want stories about games and game development.

271
00:10:25,264 --> 00:10:26,545
So you have something interesting to tell

272
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:27,885
about how your game was being built,

273
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:29,445
how you relate to your game.

274
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:30,486
Why are you making this?

275
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:33,826
That is interesting to the people in the press audience.

276
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:35,147
All right.

277
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,630
Another kind of people you might want to meet are influencers, streamers, YouTubers, all

278
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,831
this kind of new, the new way to sell games.

279
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:46,572
And again, sort of like press, you want to reach out beforehand.

280
00:10:47,252 --> 00:10:52,173
Again, like press, if you're small and they're big, you're probably not going to get a reply.

281
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:56,774
But it's good to know sort of which kind of influencers play similar games similar to

282
00:10:56,814 --> 00:10:58,455
yours and which ones will be at the event.

283
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:01,576
So you can then at the time of the event sort of see if you can reach out.

284
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,557
For influencers, it's really important that you bring something playable.

285
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:08,413
They want to play games.

286
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:09,174
They want to see games.

287
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,456
They want to see a pitch deck or anything.

288
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:14,658
And also, if you can, if you're far enough along,

289
00:11:14,898 --> 00:11:16,119
bring keys to share.

290
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,283
A, it'll make them maybe play the game for you and stream it

291
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:21,584
or take a video of it.

292
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:23,886
But it also gives them something they can

293
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:24,707
give to their followers.

294
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:27,028
They have something to share with other people.

295
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:28,970
Because in the end, influencers want

296
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,231
content for their viewers.

297
00:11:31,872 --> 00:11:32,113
All right.

298
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:34,995
Another goal to go, which was sort of my chief goal when I

299
00:11:35,035 --> 00:11:36,256
went to Gamescom, is playtesting.

300
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,011
Conferences are really good to get a lot of people that

301
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:41,952
are in your target audience to play your game in quick

302
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:43,932
succession and see them play it.

303
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,753
A booth is really good for this because you'll get a

304
00:11:47,793 --> 00:11:48,853
consistent stream of players.

305
00:11:50,014 --> 00:11:52,755
But on the other hand, in my experience, after about two

306
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,435
days of this, you've gotten so much feedback that you just

307
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:58,576
want to step back, work on the game, and then get in another

308
00:11:58,616 --> 00:12:01,877
couple days instead of being there for a long time and keep

309
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:03,238
hearing the same things over and over again.

310
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,518
And if you don't have a booth, it allows you to be more

311
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:06,498
flexible in that regard.

312
00:12:08,498 --> 00:12:12,921
If you want to do place testing, it makes sense to be aware of what you want to test.

313
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:18,084
Do you want to specifically look at the UI or are there some things in your combat system you want to look at?

314
00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:20,265
Having that in mind is useful.

315
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:27,429
Also, in that regard, if you have something you're not sure about, bring multiple builds.

316
00:12:27,849 --> 00:12:32,992
I had an earlier showing, I had different versions of an armor system.

317
00:12:33,012 --> 00:12:37,595
I wasn't really sure which one was easy to understand, which one was sort of fun to play with.

318
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,302
So I just brought multiple builds and switched them out over time.

319
00:12:41,382 --> 00:12:42,883
Just watched people interact with them.

320
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,925
Also, you should have a conference-specific build.

321
00:12:47,545 --> 00:12:49,266
I'll go into the details on that later,

322
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,189
but it makes sense to have special words and set aside.

323
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:56,751
And in the end, remember, players want to be entertained.

324
00:12:57,131 --> 00:12:59,793
The game should look and play well and look decent,

325
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:00,553
even if it's short.

326
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:02,654
It doesn't have to be like a 30-minute experience.

327
00:13:02,954 --> 00:13:04,355
You probably won't even have time for that.

328
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:07,177
But whatever you're going to show them should feel like a game.

329
00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:09,374
shouldn't be like gray boxes.

330
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:14,675
All right, another goal, making money, yeah.

331
00:13:15,555 --> 00:13:18,476
And no, that just doesn't work.

332
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,456
If you think about how much a conference is gonna cost you,

333
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:24,137
and depending how much your game is gonna cost,

334
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:26,718
you're gonna have to sell upwards of 10 copies a day,

335
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:27,778
and that's a lot.

336
00:13:28,638 --> 00:13:31,139
You know, if the conference is sort of 10 hours,

337
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,979
that means selling one copy an hour.

338
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:35,600
And I don't think that's doable.

339
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:39,316
You have to consider conferences being an investment.

340
00:13:39,716 --> 00:13:40,816
They're not about making money,

341
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:41,956
they're more about making friends.

342
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:43,997
It's not business context,

343
00:13:44,097 --> 00:13:45,897
this is people that want to be invested in you

344
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:47,098
and the things you do.

345
00:13:47,698 --> 00:13:48,838
So what you have to do instead,

346
00:13:48,918 --> 00:13:50,659
instead of trying to sell people on your game,

347
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:52,839
you have to get them interested in what you do.

348
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,080
Try to get them to stay in touch.

349
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:55,980
If you find somebody who,

350
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,120
oh, that's interesting, that's cool,

351
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,580
I like these kinds of games,

352
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:01,881
try and in some way have them follow you,

353
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:03,602
have them sort of subscribe to your newsletter.

354
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:04,882
Newsletters are great.

355
00:14:06,505 --> 00:14:07,605
by trying to hold on to them.

356
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:09,226
And if they stick around long enough,

357
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:10,386
they may convert into fans,

358
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:12,627
because the people you meet at that point,

359
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:13,848
they're just casual acquaintances.

360
00:14:14,328 --> 00:14:15,869
And getting sort of, you know,

361
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:17,349
getting your hook in them in some way

362
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,230
that they're not lost to you is really important.

363
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:19,830
All right.

364
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:21,671
So that's a bunch of goals.

365
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,752
Another time for a drink.

366
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:27,474
Next step, preparation.

367
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:30,435
What to do before you actually hit the show.

368
00:14:33,136 --> 00:14:34,697
What you should do before you hit the show

369
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:35,957
is you should know your game.

370
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:40,561
You need to know what's unique about your game

371
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:41,361
and your game story.

372
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:44,244
I've seen the talk from Tom Francis,

373
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:46,546
creator of Gunpoint and Heat Signature, earlier this week.

374
00:14:46,826 --> 00:14:47,807
He had this great quote,

375
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:51,570
ask yourself about different parts of your game.

376
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,112
Can this be a bit bland, or will the game suck?

377
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:56,354
If you find the part that can't be bland,

378
00:14:56,934 --> 00:14:58,596
that's probably a really important part of the game.

379
00:14:58,976 --> 00:15:00,097
Maybe something that makes it unique.

380
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:01,979
I mean, these two games,

381
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:03,980
that's Slime Rancher and Death Trash.

382
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:06,010
they're very different, and they'll have,

383
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,691
as a result of that, will have very different messaging,

384
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:10,551
different sort of handouts, different way you play it,

385
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:12,592
talk to people, pitch it to people,

386
00:15:13,592 --> 00:15:17,154
and for nowhere profit, I tried to figure out what that is,

387
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:20,435
and what it is, it's a single-player card game,

388
00:15:21,115 --> 00:15:23,316
it's not free-to-play, it's not multiplayer,

389
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:25,917
it's not collectible, and that sort of makes it unique,

390
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,537
but at the same time, it's also a challenge.

391
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:31,298
When people see card game, they think CCG,

392
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,159
they think trading cards, they think multiplayer.

393
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,220
So that's always something I need to communicate clearly.

394
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,461
This unique thing is also a challenge for me to overcome.

395
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:42,142
It's also a roguelike deck-building game.

396
00:15:42,402 --> 00:15:44,182
These aren't as unique as they used to be anymore.

397
00:15:44,222 --> 00:15:46,183
We have Slay the Spire, Monster Slayer,

398
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:47,783
and the Hearthstone Dungeon Run,

399
00:15:47,803 --> 00:15:49,623
which sort of all go into the same niche.

400
00:15:50,063 --> 00:15:52,744
And it's sort of a mixture of Indian culture,

401
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:54,064
science fiction, and post-apocalypse,

402
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:56,125
which we always try to really communicate

403
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,445
in very simple images, like this character here.

404
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,506
He's got this sort of science fiction arm and gun.

405
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,086
The beard and the clothing clearly communicate.

406
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:04,734
sort of Indian culture.

407
00:16:04,915 --> 00:16:06,416
And hopefully, some of the post-apocalypse

408
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:08,819
also shines through in the kid bashing

409
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,140
of sort of the gear he has.

410
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:14,364
All right, so if you know what your game sort of is,

411
00:16:14,384 --> 00:16:15,826
at its heart, what makes it special,

412
00:16:15,846 --> 00:16:19,249
next thing is making handouts.

413
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:19,610
I said.

414
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:22,904
You want people to have something that they can

415
00:16:22,944 --> 00:16:23,624
remember you by.

416
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:26,525
Giving them something physical is very good for this.

417
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:29,066
This is the key idea of merch.

418
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:32,047
People play so many games, they see so many things at a

419
00:16:32,087 --> 00:16:33,767
show, you want them to remember yours.

420
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:37,029
And one really important thing is, never do flyers.

421
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:39,109
They don't work.

422
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:42,210
The issue with flyers is they're sort of this big size

423
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,731
and they tempt you to add too much text.

424
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:45,711
And text is boring.

425
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:48,531
If you ever had a text-heavy game,

426
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:51,213
I have a text-heavy game, and you see players play a game,

427
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:52,514
they just click through the text.

428
00:16:52,874 --> 00:16:53,934
The same happens with a flyer.

429
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:55,495
You look at it, you trash it.

430
00:16:57,596 --> 00:17:00,218
Also, flyers are often sort of very light and cheap

431
00:17:00,258 --> 00:17:01,258
and sort of crumble.

432
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:03,680
And if somebody hands you a flyer, what do you do?

433
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,481
You fold it neatly and put it in your pocket?

434
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:08,863
No, you probably just sort of go squish it in there.

435
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:10,944
Or if you have like a bag, you just throw it in there,

436
00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:12,064
and at the end of the show,

437
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:13,465
it's gonna be crumpled mess at the bottom.

438
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:15,146
You pull out everything, you see this thing,

439
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:15,666
and you go like, ugh.

440
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,270
So don't do that.

441
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:17,871
Don't do flyers.

442
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,191
Instead, make something more high quality.

443
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:23,152
Make postcards, stickers, buttons, anything.

444
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:25,973
Also, focus on artwork over text.

445
00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:27,493
If you have something that looks pretty,

446
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:28,653
people will want to grab it.

447
00:17:28,993 --> 00:17:34,095
Don't forget to put your URL or the game's name on it.

448
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:34,795
That'll help.

449
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:37,415
So that's really important.

450
00:17:37,675 --> 00:17:39,396
Have something cool you can give to people.

451
00:17:39,496 --> 00:17:40,836
Like, oh, that's my game.

452
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:43,097
There you go.

453
00:17:44,177 --> 00:17:44,397
Also.

454
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,692
if you do a lot of, you'll do a lot of pitching,

455
00:17:46,872 --> 00:17:48,273
going to people, telling them about your game.

456
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:50,275
It's good if you prepared visual material.

457
00:17:50,355 --> 00:17:52,577
This can be actually physical things you then can give them.

458
00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:54,338
If you have like, if you make like postcards

459
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:56,500
and have different type things of your game on them,

460
00:17:56,981 --> 00:17:59,363
or you could like have a tablet and have like images on it.

461
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:01,605
But it'll help people, you know,

462
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:03,526
follow the words you're using

463
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:05,868
and it'll make them remember your game more easily

464
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:07,410
because when they see your screenshot later,

465
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,412
they go, oh, I've seen that somewhere and that'll help.

466
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:15,723
Also, if you have time, money, and or a team, do something fun.

467
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:17,224
I've seen people do a reward wheel,

468
00:18:17,904 --> 00:18:20,305
go do high score competitions, do costumes.

469
00:18:20,486 --> 00:18:21,466
All these sort of things can help.

470
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:24,447
But again, it sort of ties back to messaging.

471
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:26,208
You need to know what your game is to figure out

472
00:18:26,268 --> 00:18:27,369
what makes sense for you.

473
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:30,530
For No Web Profit, what I did, it's a card game.

474
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,270
So I made cards.

475
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,251
These are sort of business card-sized cards.

476
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:35,292
And they focus very much on the artwork

477
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:37,893
and had some little bits of the story and the world on it,

478
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:39,694
because that's one of the things that makes it unique.

479
00:18:41,652 --> 00:18:43,473
what really worked well is that they're different.

480
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:45,213
There's different artwork on there.

481
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:46,853
And it always allowed me to play with people

482
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:48,593
and go like, oh, which one do you want?

483
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:49,834
And you have this interaction suddenly.

484
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:50,934
It's not just you have this thing,

485
00:18:50,974 --> 00:18:53,614
but it becomes this, okay, which one do you wanna select?

486
00:18:53,994 --> 00:18:56,175
Or maybe people play for a long time,

487
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:57,815
and I'm like, all right, you can have two.

488
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,415
And it sort of becomes more interesting.

489
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:02,936
And that works for me because I'm making a collectible,

490
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,316
or non-collectible card game, but a card game,

491
00:19:05,336 --> 00:19:06,477
where there's lots of different cards.

492
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:07,977
So it sort of ties back together.

493
00:19:09,597 --> 00:19:09,817
All right.

494
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,785
messaging, handouts, and then preparing your game build.

495
00:19:14,205 --> 00:19:14,925
That's really important.

496
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:16,286
That's probably the most important thing.

497
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:20,427
And right away, make sure it runs on a mobile device.

498
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:24,268
Even if it is not a mobile game, if you can,

499
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:25,568
get it on a tablet.

500
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:28,709
If you can't get it on a tablet, use a sort of

501
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:29,569
convertible laptop.

502
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,750
But you'll be running around.

503
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,910
You'll need to show this to people.

504
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,171
You don't want to lug a lot of gear around and sort of

505
00:19:35,211 --> 00:19:36,051
carry lots of things.

506
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:40,166
No More Profit is a desktop-focused game,

507
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,227
but I have a tablet build because it's really good

508
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,387
for conferences.

509
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:45,368
The second thing about your build is

510
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:47,169
you will have a very short play time.

511
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:49,450
If you go up to people in the queue and ask them to play,

512
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,051
you'll have five to 10 minutes.

513
00:19:51,471 --> 00:19:54,032
If you can, target your game to be this short,

514
00:19:54,332 --> 00:19:55,433
even if it's normally longer.

515
00:19:57,013 --> 00:19:58,734
Because then there's this awkward moment

516
00:19:58,754 --> 00:19:59,975
if the game is very long and people play

517
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:01,295
for like five, 10 minutes and they sort of,

518
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:03,376
like the queue starts moving again and they wanna leave,

519
00:20:03,696 --> 00:20:05,137
but they sort of have to abandon the game

520
00:20:05,177 --> 00:20:06,238
and give it back to you.

521
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:08,488
an uncomfortable experience for them.

522
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:10,329
So if you can give them an easy answer,

523
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:12,130
they've played a bunch, they're done,

524
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,851
you reward them visually, or maybe with,

525
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:15,752
like, oh, you finished, you get a sticker.

526
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:19,013
That's a lot better ending experience than just,

527
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:20,794
all right, I just, here, please.

528
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:24,375
Also, you cannot rely on audio.

529
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:27,037
It's gonna be loud, and there's gonna be lots of people around,

530
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:29,157
and people don't want to put on headphones.

531
00:20:29,758 --> 00:20:30,878
You know, here, hold this tablet,

532
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,259
I'm just gonna put my headphones on you.

533
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:34,160
That just doesn't work.

534
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,001
And also, I mean, that's true for all games,

535
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:40,003
but doubly here, as self-explanatory as possible.

536
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:44,066
If you have a booth, you can print out your controller

537
00:20:44,086 --> 00:20:46,468
scheme and put it on the booth so people can look at it

538
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:46,868
or whatever.

539
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:49,430
If you're doing this on the go, people

540
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,391
are not going to look at anything.

541
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:52,732
I mean, I thought about doing something like printing it

542
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:54,313
on a shirt, because that'd be funny.

543
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:57,636
But you want to give this thing to people

544
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,657
and have them play immediately.

545
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,119
And I've mentioned earlier, having a specific conference

546
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:03,180
build is a plus.

547
00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:06,848
It is useful for making a short experience, rewarding people,

548
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:08,049
making it easier.

549
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,751
Because people don't know the game,

550
00:21:09,771 --> 00:21:11,272
they want to have a good experience.

551
00:21:11,332 --> 00:21:12,893
Maybe you're just going to tone down

552
00:21:12,913 --> 00:21:13,854
the difficulty a little bit.

553
00:21:15,295 --> 00:21:17,817
Always triggers the tutorial, resets automatically

554
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:18,477
after a while.

555
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,200
Maybe you want to put your pitch material in the game

556
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,461
so you don't have to leave the game and go back to the game

557
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:24,903
if you have images in there.

558
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,324
So there are a bunch of things you can do.

559
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:29,626
It makes sense early on to put this in your build.

560
00:21:29,887 --> 00:21:32,168
And maybe just have some pool, some simple flag

561
00:21:32,188 --> 00:21:33,049
you can turn on and turn off.

562
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,153
to get your conference build always up to date

563
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,454
and always sort of carry that forward.

564
00:21:36,474 --> 00:21:38,215
Because it's going to come in handy a bunch of times.

565
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:41,076
And the last one is, you're going

566
00:21:41,096 --> 00:21:42,676
to talk to a lot of people, and a lot of people

567
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:43,516
are going to watch you because you're

568
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:44,577
sort of operating in this queue.

569
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:47,578
If you can make people laugh, that's a real good plus.

570
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:49,058
It'll make approaching more people

571
00:21:49,098 --> 00:21:50,459
easy because, oh, they're having fun.

572
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:51,879
And then you come to them, and they're

573
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:52,800
interested in what you're doing.

574
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,061
This may be sort of hard if you have a serious game,

575
00:21:56,101 --> 00:22:00,202
like Nowhere Prophet, which is this post-apocalyptic

576
00:22:00,983 --> 00:22:01,643
experience thing.

577
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:05,019
But what you can do is you have, if you're sort of early,

578
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:07,901
you can have temp graphics and have them be funny.

579
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:11,022
So what I did is I had these mustache-carrying dudes.

580
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,163
They're obviously temp.

581
00:22:12,303 --> 00:22:13,484
Like, I don't need to explain to people

582
00:22:13,524 --> 00:22:15,985
that these are not the final graphics, but they're fun.

583
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:17,907
Like, whenever they appeared, people had a good time.

584
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:20,428
So it's possible to add some levity,

585
00:22:20,488 --> 00:22:21,709
even if it's sort of a serious game.

586
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:23,870
You have to decide if that's something you wanna do.

587
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:27,232
All right, so that's a quick overview of the preparation.

588
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,413
Let's get to the approach.

589
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:30,574
But before we do that,

590
00:22:31,503 --> 00:22:32,183
Take a deep breath.

591
00:22:35,846 --> 00:22:38,688
Because once you're going to hit the show floor,

592
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,432
you need all the energy you can have.

593
00:22:43,592 --> 00:22:45,013
You need to be excited.

594
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:46,775
But first, you need to find your people.

595
00:22:47,996 --> 00:22:50,077
What you can do is you can look for people,

596
00:22:50,257 --> 00:22:52,839
for games that have a similar genre, similar mechanics,

597
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,180
or a similar setting.

598
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,362
So if you make a shooter, just look for people

599
00:22:56,382 --> 00:22:57,303
that play other shooters.

600
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,102
If you have a card game, look for similar card games.

601
00:23:01,202 --> 00:23:03,643
If you have a post-apocalyptic game,

602
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:05,624
I can never say this right.

603
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:07,185
Post-apocalyptic.

604
00:23:07,305 --> 00:23:08,766
If you make a post-apocalyptic game,

605
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:10,066
look for similar games.

606
00:23:11,287 --> 00:23:13,328
And then you approach.

607
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:17,910
And approaching these people is not as hard as it sounds.

608
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,391
Again, you sort of have to be in the right mood, I think.

609
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:23,533
I'm slightly extroverted, but still,

610
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:25,353
it always costs some energy, which why.

611
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:27,810
You need to be really refreshed when you get there.

612
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,791
And then be friendly.

613
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,091
That's what it comes down to.

614
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:33,012
Hi, I have a game.

615
00:23:33,032 --> 00:23:33,933
Do you want to see the game?

616
00:23:34,273 --> 00:23:35,213
Be excited about your game.

617
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:38,535
If you're not excited, you will not be able to get anybody

618
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:39,015
involved.

619
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:40,256
They don't care then.

620
00:23:41,196 --> 00:23:43,917
But also, be excited about the game you're at, because

621
00:23:43,937 --> 00:23:44,998
you're at somebody else's booth.

622
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:46,398
And people are there for that game.

623
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:48,879
So if I'm at the Hearthstone booth.

624
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,780
I've played Hearthstone for way too long.

625
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:52,201
Research.

626
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,350
But then I was excited and I could talk to people

627
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,691
about Hearthstone and sort of lead from that to my game.

628
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,792
So, hey, you like Hearthstone?

629
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:02,193
I'm working on a card game.

630
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:03,893
And something about Hearthstone that really bugged me

631
00:24:04,314 --> 00:24:05,955
is that you sort of have to grind for cards

632
00:24:06,115 --> 00:24:08,216
and sort of makes the deck building very restrictive.

633
00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:10,957
So I made a single-player card game that fixes that.

634
00:24:11,077 --> 00:24:11,597
Are you interested?

635
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:13,338
And that sort of worked really well for me

636
00:24:13,378 --> 00:24:15,860
to tie in sort of my game to the game I'm at.

637
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:19,842
As mentioned, be friendly.

638
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:22,283
Be doubly friendly because you're at somebody else's booth.

639
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:22,963
You're not trying to,

640
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,551
got into any trouble, you know.

641
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:26,892
You're just a guest, as everybody else.

642
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,053
If somebody asks you to leave, stop it then.

643
00:24:29,393 --> 00:24:30,133
You probably just do,

644
00:24:30,514 --> 00:24:32,114
there's gonna be enough players around.

645
00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:34,496
So, that's the approach.

646
00:24:35,616 --> 00:24:37,697
To get people to play, just ask them if they wanna play.

647
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,338
Hand them the thing, let them play, five to 10 minutes.

648
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:42,999
And after you're done, keep it simple.

649
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,541
Ask them for one thing only.

650
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:48,262
Hey, thank you for playing, please.

651
00:24:50,068 --> 00:24:51,730
follow me on Twitter or check out the game,

652
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,491
Wishlist on Steam, whatever it is,

653
00:24:54,172 --> 00:24:56,033
give them one thing to do and give them something

654
00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:58,295
to sort of remind them where to do it.

655
00:25:00,116 --> 00:25:02,158
What I tried to do in the beginning

656
00:25:02,218 --> 00:25:03,599
is to ask for newsletter subscriptions,

657
00:25:03,639 --> 00:25:04,700
because I like newsletters,

658
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,481
and I had this clipboard with me,

659
00:25:07,242 --> 00:25:09,184
and I wanted to write all the emails on there,

660
00:25:09,224 --> 00:25:10,705
and that did not work at all,

661
00:25:10,765 --> 00:25:12,767
because it made me look like the pollster,

662
00:25:12,907 --> 00:25:14,388
like one of the guys you see in the mall

663
00:25:14,428 --> 00:25:15,889
who asks you political questions,

664
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:17,590
and nobody likes those guys.

665
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:20,686
went in the bag real quickly.

666
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,828
But try to give them something to do.

667
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:25,069
All right.

668
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:28,091
And those, again, as I said earlier in making friends,

669
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:29,532
if any of them are really interested,

670
00:25:29,892 --> 00:25:30,953
try and hold onto them.

671
00:25:31,293 --> 00:25:32,954
Maybe ask them if they wanna be better testers.

672
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:34,815
Maybe they can get a key if they test for a while.

673
00:25:35,195 --> 00:25:35,956
Whatever you're gonna do,

674
00:25:36,016 --> 00:25:37,237
try and grab them and hold onto them.

675
00:25:38,438 --> 00:25:39,018
So that's the queue.

676
00:25:39,218 --> 00:25:40,019
You can approach the queue.

677
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:41,039
You can make the queue play.

678
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,201
You'll have five to 10 minutes of play time.

679
00:25:43,563 --> 00:25:46,225
But if that's not long enough, you

680
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:47,586
may want to look at the stragglers.

681
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,467
These are the people that are around the booth you're at,

682
00:25:50,707 --> 00:25:53,249
say around Hearthstone, but they're not standing in line.

683
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:55,070
They're just waiting or watching the screens.

684
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,571
And these people have time for longer play sessions.

685
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:01,553
They're not moving and going to get somewhere specific.

686
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:05,775
So you can approach them, hey, Hearthstone, my game.

687
00:26:06,736 --> 00:26:07,856
Let them play if they're interested.

688
00:26:07,896 --> 00:26:09,717
You have a longer session, and you have more time

689
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:10,698
for questions afterwards.

690
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:15,171
And usually, because it's sort of a more relaxed environment,

691
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:19,394
it also works a lot better to sort of get them to subscribe

692
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:20,916
or get them to do something on the spot,

693
00:26:21,376 --> 00:26:23,938
instead of giving them something to do afterwards.

694
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:26,721
Also, it sort of seems to be easier to give people

695
00:26:26,741 --> 00:26:28,322
the headphones here, because they're not moving.

696
00:26:28,822 --> 00:26:30,404
They're usually sort of standing somewhere specific.

697
00:26:31,084 --> 00:26:33,386
But that sort of depends on how you run it, I guess.

698
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:35,388
All right, press.

699
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:36,509
So we're on the go.

700
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:37,370
We have everything mobile.

701
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:38,923
We can talk to press.

702
00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:42,724
On the big events, you can look for the press badges.

703
00:26:43,365 --> 00:26:45,125
Here at GDC, there's this little media stripe.

704
00:26:45,665 --> 00:26:47,806
For Gamescom, they have a sort of, like, slightly pink badge.

705
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:50,187
If you know what it looks like, you can spot it.

706
00:26:50,947 --> 00:26:52,407
So if you see somebody in front of a press,

707
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:55,588
you can just go, hi, I'm making a card game.

708
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:57,229
Are you interested in card games?

709
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,669
And then sort of give them the pitch.

710
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,451
Here, again, stay friendly, stay professional.

711
00:27:04,131 --> 00:27:06,051
You don't have to, if they're like, no, I'm in a hurry,

712
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:06,912
or no, I don't care, just...

713
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:11,409
All right, I'll be, we're sort of on the time.

714
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,891
All right, so be friendly, be respectful,

715
00:27:15,412 --> 00:27:17,193
and try and get their contact details.

716
00:27:17,253 --> 00:27:18,133
Try to give them something,

717
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:20,394
but they may have gotten so many cards,

718
00:27:20,434 --> 00:27:21,555
so many, seen so many games,

719
00:27:21,935 --> 00:27:23,376
they may not be doing the follow-up.

720
00:27:23,556 --> 00:27:24,857
So if you get their contact details,

721
00:27:24,997 --> 00:27:26,558
you're in charge of the follow-up,

722
00:27:26,598 --> 00:27:28,459
and that's more valuable.

723
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,901
Influences are sort of hard to spot

724
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:33,342
because they don't have special badges,

725
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:35,143
but if you know who's there and,

726
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:38,612
what they look like, you can reach out on social media

727
00:27:38,632 --> 00:27:39,633
and go like, hey, I'm around.

728
00:27:39,953 --> 00:27:42,234
I can come to where you are and show you my game.

729
00:27:42,254 --> 00:27:43,835
That's really useful.

730
00:27:44,275 --> 00:27:45,796
Again, they want to play something,

731
00:27:45,836 --> 00:27:46,976
so give them something to play.

732
00:27:48,157 --> 00:27:50,198
And if you can, give them something, maybe some merch.

733
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:51,859
You've got a few t-shirts, you can hand to them,

734
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:53,840
they can raffle off whatever you want to do.

735
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,342
But that's all the goals I've got so far.

736
00:27:58,482 --> 00:28:00,983
So once you've done this, you've talked to players,

737
00:28:01,023 --> 00:28:02,404
you let them play, you talk to press,

738
00:28:02,424 --> 00:28:04,185
you talk to influencers, you're done.

739
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:05,738
Not quite.

740
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:06,798
You still have the wrap-up to do.

741
00:28:07,578 --> 00:28:09,880
As mentioned, you need to follow up with your contacts.

742
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,820
Say, hi, it was great meeting you.

743
00:28:12,701 --> 00:28:13,401
Let's stay in touch.

744
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,322
Here's a build of the game.

745
00:28:14,362 --> 00:28:16,823
Maybe press people a key, whatever it's going to be.

746
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,804
If you have people subscribe to a newsletter,

747
00:28:20,285 --> 00:28:22,065
send out a newsletter and say, hey, welcome new fans.

748
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:24,687
Maybe you've taken some good pictures of the event

749
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:25,827
and the fans you played.

750
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:26,888
You can put that in there.

751
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:28,669
That'll make people more likely to share.

752
00:28:28,689 --> 00:28:33,611
Or you do something like this and make a talk about it.

753
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:37,900
All right, so to wrap it up, because I sort of have to race through this,

754
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:42,842
find out where you're going and prepare accordingly.

755
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,543
Make sure your game and all your materials are good to go on the fly.

756
00:28:48,064 --> 00:28:50,665
Have your cards in a pocket and know which pocket they're in.

757
00:28:50,965 --> 00:28:53,305
Have the cards you get in another pocket so you don't go like,

758
00:28:53,406 --> 00:28:54,846
ugh, wait, where's everything?

759
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:59,208
And approach, know where your audience goes, and be excited.

760
00:28:59,408 --> 00:28:59,828
That helps.

761
00:29:00,248 --> 00:29:03,389
Just loving your game and being excited sort of infects people.

762
00:29:04,238 --> 00:29:06,261
So, and that's it, I'm at the end,

763
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:08,204
and I'm gonna finish with one clear call to action.

764
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,346
