1
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:07,386
My name's Evan.

2
00:00:07,606 --> 00:00:11,449
I'm a lead game designer at Scopely, a mobile game

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:12,629
developer and publisher.

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,012
And I'm here today to talk about data.

5
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:21,075
So analytics can get kind of a bad rap among game designers

6
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:22,156
in the mobile industry.

7
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:25,157
It's the realm of product managers and analysts

8
00:00:25,218 --> 00:00:26,959
to a lot of people, not designers

9
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,520
trying to make the game fun.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,881
But I have a confession to make.

11
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:32,742
I love data.

12
00:00:33,564 --> 00:00:40,128
I secretly have an engineering background as well as a product one, so I kind of come at this from a different angle than a lot of people.

13
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:48,533
And I've been talking about system design and mobile for a while now, and what I want to see is more game designers embracing what we can learn from this kind of analytics.

14
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:54,996
I think that data can be extraordinarily useful in not only making games, but in making games better.

15
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,558
So that's what I'm here to talk about today.

16
00:00:59,536 --> 00:01:00,658
and I turned off the clicker.

17
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:03,622
So everyone knows the value of playtesting, right?

18
00:01:03,883 --> 00:01:05,746
You've got a game, and you're sure players

19
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:07,368
are going to act in a particular way.

20
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:09,291
And then you throw real people at it,

21
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:11,054
and no one can find the right buttons.

22
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:13,117
People use everything backwards, and it's madness.

23
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:17,439
Usability testing is now an important and kind of accepted

24
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,900
part of development process.

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,740
And what analytics does is allows designers

26
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,401
to do that on a mass level.

27
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:26,961
So every game designer has intuition

28
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:28,502
about what players will do.

29
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:31,042
But there's nothing like actual behavior

30
00:01:31,062 --> 00:01:32,923
to tell you what's really going on.

31
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:35,363
What levels do players get stuck on?

32
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:37,164
What are their favorite characters to use?

33
00:01:37,224 --> 00:01:37,844
Things like that.

34
00:01:38,504 --> 00:01:40,605
And the best way to get answers to those questions

35
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,225
is to see what players are actually doing.

36
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:48,367
There's a lot to learn from these methods that you just can't get from any other source,

37
00:01:48,888 --> 00:01:53,770
whether that's a direct answer to something like what weapon is more popular or more effective,

38
00:01:54,230 --> 00:02:00,553
or importantly, just using data trends to find red flags that indicate where you should

39
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:02,193
spend more of your time investigating.

40
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:07,255
Either way, it's vital information that you're just ignoring if you don't take advantage

41
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:08,096
of it as a designer.

42
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:13,158
So now that everyone is thoroughly convinced, in order to demonstrate these principles,

43
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:16,420
I'm going to be using some examples from what I've actually done before.

44
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:22,664
And for that, I'll be using my and Scopely's latest game, the Looney Tunes World of Mayhem.

45
00:02:23,364 --> 00:02:27,166
So this is an RPG battler where you collect characters,

46
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:31,729
level them up, and battle other players and PvE enemies alike.

47
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:37,052
there's a ton of different materials that you need to tune up your characters and unlock better

48
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:43,036
skills. That's actually about all you need to know to follow along today, but the game is a

49
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:49,040
whole lot of fun, so you should really all go try it. As a bit of bookkeeping, some of the specific

50
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,482
numbers have been changed and the slides have been posted online, so you don't have to draw this in

51
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:58,425
your notes. You can get it after the talk. I'd also like to thank all the actual analysts who

52
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:00,026
pulled this out of the database for me.

53
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,151
Thank you.

54
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:03,693
And with that out of the way, let's dig in.

55
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:09,057
So the first step to actually using data is acquiring it.

56
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:11,619
And the best way to do that in your own games

57
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,160
is to track everything.

58
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:15,462
Yes, everything.

59
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,645
We're focusing on the design applications here,

60
00:03:18,685 --> 00:03:20,827
so I'm not going to go into the nitty gritty of actually

61
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:22,088
programming all the logging.

62
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,890
But basically, you want to track every time a player does

63
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,332
anything in your game and record it in your database.

64
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:30,774
then most of what you'll use is going to be aggregated data.

65
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,315
What do most players do?

66
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:34,097
What's the average of some measurement?

67
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:34,857
Things like that.

68
00:03:35,638 --> 00:03:38,480
And we're going to talk about the three most important things

69
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,401
to keep track of as we go forward.

70
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:44,024
And the simplest way to summarize everything is taps.

71
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,486
We're going to be tracking where people actually tap in your game.

72
00:03:47,986 --> 00:03:50,268
Or clicks, if you're not actually a mobile designer

73
00:03:50,288 --> 00:03:52,129
and sort of snuck in here anyway, that's okay.

74
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,071
At a base level, anytime the player taps anything in your game, you want to track it.

75
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:02,813
You may not end up needing all of that, like every motion of the character in an adventure

76
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:07,675
game or every slide in a match 3, but you want to make sure you're tracking what players

77
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:08,775
are interacting with.

78
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:14,077
Going one level deeper, we have our impressions, which are the screens the players open,

79
00:04:14,577 --> 00:04:20,379
the activities, what players are actively choosing to do, and the resources, every time a player

80
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:26,161
earns or spends anything. It's actually a common mistake to just track premium currencies this way,

81
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:31,503
but you want to keep tabs on your entire economy. You want to know where players are getting their

82
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,424
stuff and where they spend it.

83
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,921
So if you're used to talking about analytics,

84
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:39,322
you're going to be familiar with all of these terms.

85
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:40,742
But for those of you that aren't,

86
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:42,283
here's a very quick overview.

87
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:46,564
Key metrics are the end results of player behavior,

88
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:48,085
not their specific actions.

89
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:50,385
So we're not only tracking player behavior

90
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:53,446
for its own sake, but we want to relate everything back

91
00:04:53,486 --> 00:04:55,627
to one of the game's key metrics at the end of day.

92
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:58,148
It's kind of the business reason we do the things

93
00:04:58,188 --> 00:04:59,488
we do to make the game better.

94
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:04,594
The two most basic things we're tracking are retention and monetization,

95
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:09,960
where retention is how many players are still playing your game on day one, day seven, 30 etc.

96
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,125
And conversion is sort of your percentage of players that are spending. And from there you

97
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:18,730
can track a field of acronyms of revenue per user, per daily active user, so on.

98
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:23,096
everything's actually summing up to LTV, your lifetime value,

99
00:05:23,436 --> 00:05:27,982
sort of the what you get from each player. And this is definitely focused on the free-to-play

100
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:31,526
aspect, but if you're a premium game, we're still tracking the player engagement and behavior

101
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:37,353
metrics the same way. No matter what, this is the starting point. So let's sort of go on to

102
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:38,635
the really interesting bits.

103
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:43,402
The first thing to look at in regards to player behavior is engagement.

104
00:05:44,163 --> 00:05:47,347
If retained players are the ones actually opening your game,

105
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:49,791
engaged players are the ones doing something in it.

106
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:55,358
As designers, we succeed when people, you know, play our game.

107
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:59,581
In this case, we're going to look at how players interact with the game,

108
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:02,984
starting at the highest level and working our way down.

109
00:06:03,224 --> 00:06:06,866
This is when we start building questions to ask when we're looking at the data later.

110
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,549
First, examine every screen the player opens.

111
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:12,210
Where are they going in your game?

112
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,831
How are they navigating through it?

113
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:17,473
A level select, a store, a help menu, whatever it actually is.

114
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:21,776
After that, how do players engage with the features in your game?

115
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:25,818
We want to track when they start a battle, craft an item, whatever it is.

116
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:31,001
For us in our game, that's every time they do any kind of battle and whenever they upgrade

117
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:36,544
or interact with their characters. We actually want to get super granular with these actions.

118
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:40,687
Which battles are they starting? What's the team they're using? Who are they fighting?

119
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,568
What are they upgrading? From what level to what level?

120
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:46,291
How often do they change their teams around?

121
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,074
You want to track all of those little details

122
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:51,436
because when players make a decision,

123
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:53,298
you want to know what they're doing.

124
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:58,248
that all rolls up to tell you what players are actually doing in your game.

125
00:06:58,788 --> 00:07:04,153
So we often want to see how players are using the things we've built and how that impacts behavior.

126
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:09,157
And from there, we can learn a lot, especially when you start combining these things together.

127
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:15,483
If 80% of your players open the weapon forge and only 20% of them are upgrading weapons,

128
00:07:15,523 --> 00:07:18,125
you've got sort of a big gulf between these two things to look at.

129
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:22,630
So here's a pretty clear example from early on in our game's beta testing.

130
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,394
It's also probably the simplest chart you're going to see in any GDC this week.

131
00:07:27,315 --> 00:07:30,999
We're looking at the percentage of players that are actually spending money in our game,

132
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:34,302
which is something that always comes up as something to be improved in mobile.

133
00:07:35,203 --> 00:07:40,107
We noticed a trend when we compared it to a particular action, in this case, viewing our store.

134
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:45,132
Players who are shown the store more frequently are more likely to spend in the game.

135
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:51,398
That may sound obvious, but it was the exact details of it that were interesting and how much it increased.

136
00:07:51,858 --> 00:07:53,720
And so as a designer, the question was...

137
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,302
how can I get people to view the store more frequently that is actually beneficial to them?

138
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:04,185
I don't just want to try to sell people more things constantly. So in our case, we added a

139
00:08:04,345 --> 00:08:09,987
free prize to the game that could be claimed every three hours from the store. It drove people to

140
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:15,329
view it, they could see what was available, make their own decisions, and it led to higher

141
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:21,032
conversion by giving them free stuff constantly. It was a pretty meaningful impact for the product

142
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:23,093
that came directly from our analytics.

143
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:29,111
Beyond looking at what players do, you want to look at what they accomplish.

144
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:32,473
Are players completing the things you set out for them to do?

145
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:37,035
Goals are just the milestones in your game that you set for players.

146
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:42,438
These are usually visible in the game, like beating a boss level or completing a literal

147
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:46,179
achievement, but they can be behind the scenes and be anything you need to track.

148
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,782
If you have any kind of level structure in your game at all, that's definitely something you want to look at.

149
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:56,765
Look for when they're completing a particular chapter, beating a puzzle, a fight, whatever it is.

150
00:08:57,505 --> 00:09:00,827
And importantly, don't just look at first-time completions.

151
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,189
You want to keep an eye on healthy player behavior every day.

152
00:09:04,729 --> 00:09:11,233
These might be literal daily goals again, or they could just be benchmarks that you want to see from players every day.

153
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:14,034
You know, going through every part of your core loop, for example.

154
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:20,545
Importantly, you're often looking for what players aren't doing even more than what they are.

155
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:24,191
So here's an example from the daily quests in our game.

156
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:31,143
Early on, we implemented quests for players to do every day that take them through every

157
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:31,864
part of our game.

158
00:09:32,284 --> 00:09:36,629
Battling other players, upgrading their characters, engaging with the city builders, and so on.

159
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:39,312
And there was a large bonus for beating all of them.

160
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:42,396
That's purely a retention feature, right?

161
00:09:42,476 --> 00:09:44,057
We want players to be rewarded.

162
00:09:44,138 --> 00:09:46,160
I want them to earn that every day and come back.

163
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:52,206
Now, this graph shows the completion rates of each of those over a period of about three

164
00:09:52,246 --> 00:09:52,547
weeks.

165
00:09:53,307 --> 00:09:58,873
We saw that we had under 10% of players actually claiming that big bonus reward, and that was

166
00:09:58,933 --> 00:09:59,474
a problem.

167
00:10:00,155 --> 00:10:04,960
Looking at the chart, it was obvious that two quests in particular were lower than everything

168
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,180
else.

169
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:11,768
We had one for opening crates, the sort of treasure chests of our game that you get after battles,

170
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:15,571
and one for playing the PvE battles that we call Invasion.

171
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:18,072
The crates were simply the effort.

172
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:20,534
You couldn't actually complete it in the first session.

173
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:24,036
You would go do a battle, put them in your bank, and you'd have to come back later,

174
00:10:24,436 --> 00:10:25,497
and it was a lot of effort.

175
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:30,600
And we already had a daily goal that tracked the battles that gave you them in the first place,

176
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,020
so we simply cut it out.

177
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,722
It was redundant, and the other battle goal was doing fine.

178
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:40,623
The PvE one was the interesting part, where it led me to basically pitch a feature that let you

179
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:46,024
autoplay old battles you'd mastered before. And here's what it looked like after we did that.

180
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:51,685
There was drastic improvement in players claiming all of the daily quests, which is

181
00:10:52,126 --> 00:10:57,427
exactly the behavior that I wanted. We were able to determine the need for that autoplay feature

182
00:10:57,547 --> 00:11:01,367
by looking at this, that it was so much more of a burden than the other tasks,

183
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,368
but players wanted to complete goals.

184
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:10,534
So you can often learn which parts of your game need the most improvement from these seemingly unrelated investigations.

185
00:11:11,614 --> 00:11:18,560
There's usually something to learn whenever player behavior is lacking in one area compared to everything else in your game.

186
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:27,008
If something is getting less attention or people aren't completing it, there's something wrong with the experience or the difficulty or the messaging or some aspect of it.

187
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:31,955
When you're looking at player behavior and tracking what you need to, you've got these

188
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:37,277
questions to start asking. One of the biggest ones is what kinds of behavior lead to better

189
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:43,179
players? And that's where we tie into those key metrics from earlier. A better player is one that

190
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:47,320
is doing well on any of those things. They're sticking around, they have longer sessions,

191
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,722
more play time, they're converting, whatever it is. We ask, what is this player doing differently?

192
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:57,143
And is there something we can do to get every player to act like that?

193
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:02,129
And when you dig deeper, is there anything that players are doing that you didn't expect?

194
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:07,275
And what happens when they do? So let's look at a couple more cases

195
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:10,098
that show these sort of trends again from when we were launching.

196
00:12:11,258 --> 00:12:17,241
This is how many players came back to the game on the second day compared to how many battles they

197
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:22,564
did on the first. It increases with activity as you might expect, but the super interesting thing

198
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:28,047
was that you hit this relative plateau in the data. As a designer, this gives me the minimum

199
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:33,150
number to hit. If we can get players to that threshold, they are twice as likely to come

200
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,992
back the next day as players that did practically no battles at all.

201
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:41,153
So we changed the early game to really reward hitting that number.

202
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:43,956
The quests you get early, the amount of energy you get,

203
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:47,159
where the rewards are for beating parts of the campaign.

204
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,424
Those were the tools to try to just change player behavior to get them up to that threshold.

205
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:56,368
You know, give them time to realize what they like about your game and keep playing it.

206
00:12:58,603 --> 00:13:01,405
On the other hand, sometimes the behaviors actually peak.

207
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:04,066
This was an unexpected result we got early on.

208
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:07,388
Energy in our game is used for those PVE battles,

209
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:09,990
and we compared that to the amount of characters

210
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,831
that a player was earning in that first day

211
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:14,313
from all the various game modes and rewards.

212
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:17,255
As players start to earn more characters,

213
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:19,036
they start spending more energy.

214
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,158
Maybe they're having fun, they wanna try out the new toys,

215
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:23,259
whatever their motivations.

216
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,419
But there was a point.

217
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,502
when engagement with the campaign actually decreased.

218
00:13:28,282 --> 00:13:30,724
They were probably overwhelmed by the amount of choice

219
00:13:30,804 --> 00:13:32,745
or they felt like they didn't need to earn anything new.

220
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:35,908
And it was critical that we paced our early game

221
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:38,449
to try to hit that peak as often as possible.

222
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,611
Normalizing the early drop rates,

223
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:42,693
giving things from first time completions,

224
00:13:42,773 --> 00:13:44,394
not repeats and things like that.

225
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:46,695
My goal was to get as many players

226
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:48,377
into that sweet spot as we could

227
00:13:48,897 --> 00:13:51,439
and it worked really, really well.

228
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:55,130
Now that we're sort of moving past engagement,

229
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,632
the next thing, and my personal favorite,

230
00:13:57,752 --> 00:13:58,993
is tracking resources.

231
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:03,555
The base setup for this is a log of every transaction

232
00:14:03,655 --> 00:14:04,456
for each player.

233
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:07,298
From here, you observe all kinds of things.

234
00:14:07,418 --> 00:14:10,540
For each material, the average earned and spent per day,

235
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,802
whether it's over the whole population or just a segment,

236
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:15,883
such as new players or anyone over level 30.

237
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:18,524
You can get the average carrying balance

238
00:14:18,544 --> 00:14:20,005
from a resource from day to day.

239
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:21,366
And the real trick.

240
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:28,028
is when you compare these resources to how much players need. Need you can derive from content

241
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:33,429
demands and your desired pace of content. If players have a level 7 unit and you want to get

242
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:38,070
them to 8, the resources needed to get to that level is exactly what you want to track here.

243
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:44,171
This could be materials, currencies, experience, whatever it is. And make sure you compare this to

244
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:49,773
relevant player behavior such as the characters they actually use instead of everything they own

245
00:14:49,793 --> 00:14:49,973
at all.

246
00:14:50,753 --> 00:14:57,214
Trying to keep this in mind at once is important but complicated, so we've got a special complicated

247
00:14:57,274 --> 00:15:02,636
view for it. That's the Christmas tree board. There's a bit to explain here. This is a list

248
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:07,537
of all the materials in our game that are earned and how much are used, broken down by player level.

249
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:13,038
Here, the green, from the good point of the product, means they're not earning as much as

250
00:15:13,058 --> 00:15:18,259
they would like to, and red means they're likely to, you know, they're earning as much as they're

251
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:18,880
actually using.

252
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,373
So if you had a bunch of rank 5 characters and they're missing anvils to get to rank 6,

253
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:26,660
then anvils would be green here.

254
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:31,609
So certain materials in this are never really in short supply.

255
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:34,551
You might have to work to get them, like dynamite,

256
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:36,613
but you always have enough if you actually want it.

257
00:15:37,273 --> 00:15:39,475
Other ones, like our fine materials,

258
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:41,616
are always in high demand, giving players

259
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:42,597
something to work for.

260
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,039
And others go through these really neat transitions,

261
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,821
where they're hard to acquire early

262
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:49,682
and they're essentially free later,

263
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,824
when other materials have taken their place

264
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:52,664
and you can catch up.

265
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:56,848
This view tells you what players have compared to what they need,

266
00:15:57,228 --> 00:16:00,532
and it's almost exactly how I intended it as a designer,

267
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:04,996
where there's always something important and players can still catch up on materials later.

268
00:16:05,156 --> 00:16:08,399
And I had a lot of versions that didn't look how we wanted,

269
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:11,342
that we used while building it until it started to look like this.

270
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:14,986
But importantly, every resource in your game should have a purpose,

271
00:16:15,026 --> 00:16:18,049
and views like this are good ways to make sure it's actually happening.

272
00:16:19,422 --> 00:16:22,523
Building dashboards like that is actually very helpful.

273
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:25,944
Running ad hoc queries and throwing them into Excel

274
00:16:26,004 --> 00:16:28,385
to make a chart is good for a one-time question,

275
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:31,406
but what all the best mobile companies are doing

276
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:34,548
is logging into those tables and views every single day.

277
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,209
You get that high-level view at a glance

278
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,009
that you can check to see how it's changing.

279
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,470
Checking them just becomes part of your routine,

280
00:16:42,091 --> 00:16:45,232
and you can look for a sudden and unexpected changes.

281
00:16:46,368 --> 00:16:50,795
A drop or spike in someone's material balance that they're carrying is a bad sign.

282
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:54,741
It could mean there's a bug that's live or there's an unexpected change in behavior.

283
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:59,108
And it's one of those red flags that leads you to looking at the parts of your game in

284
00:16:59,128 --> 00:17:00,970
more detail trying to figure out what's happened.

285
00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:09,908
Slower changes, on the other hand, can be natural patterns of players learning the optimal paths in your game or the meta changing and players shifting.

286
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:15,811
But the use of these dashboards is to discover problems before players even realize they exist.

287
00:17:16,391 --> 00:17:23,594
In our case, we had a particular unique material that was just always lower in drops compared to everything else.

288
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:26,495
And it turned out that it was entirely my fault.

289
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:28,896
And there was a misconfiguration in a drop rate.

290
00:17:29,237 --> 00:17:33,080
but we were able to find it and fix it before our community realized,

291
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,544
and getting ahead of that is always very good.

292
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:42,371
So that other view is great for tracking shortages and surpluses as players mature,

293
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:46,833
but sometimes you want to look at one particular inflow and outflow over time, as I was saying.

294
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:51,496
So this is a view of a single material where each color is a different source or sink.

295
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:55,798
Players for this one were earning a little bit every day from normal gameplay,

296
00:17:56,298 --> 00:18:00,641
and then they had a periodic inflow from a daily challenge, a sort of rotating game feature.

297
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:06,803
But players didn't spend the material on the same patterns, so they were just always acquiring it

298
00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:12,525
and always had it on hand before they actually needed it. After looking at this, we reduced the

299
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:17,526
inflow, especially the size of the spikes, and all of a sudden we had the desired behavior.

300
00:18:17,906 --> 00:18:22,628
Players were making sure to log in on the right days to get the material when it was available.

301
00:18:23,148 --> 00:18:25,049
They still had everything they needed.

302
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:27,771
It didn't actually change the economy or try to sell it to them,

303
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:29,712
but all of a sudden it was valuable.

304
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,313
It was something they cared about instead of forgettable.

305
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:35,175
You want to have those critical path resources,

306
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:37,156
and you can create one if there isn't one already.

307
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:41,225
In terms of the actual content in your game,

308
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:44,527
you're basically tracking how players actually use

309
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:46,388
all the stuff in your game, right?

310
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,650
In our game and many mobile titles,

311
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,912
characters or cards or units are what we're tracking here.

312
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:54,894
And there's usually three things that we are looking at,

313
00:18:55,394 --> 00:18:57,155
ownership, usage, and win rates.

314
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,598
of the entire player base or just our segment again,

315
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:03,600
what percentage of players actually own the content?

316
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,802
Out of them, how many people are actively using it?

317
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:10,464
How many people win or succeed due to a task

318
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:11,385
when they're using them?

319
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:14,006
Tracking this kind of data can be

320
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:16,908
one of the most important tasks that a systems designer is

321
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:18,089
doing on a mobile game.

322
00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:20,951
So let's look at how I'm using this in practice.

323
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:29,004
This is a bubble chart example with all three. Usage and win rates on the axes and ownership is

324
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:34,108
the size of the circle. It's kind of the dashboard of the character meta that's going on in the game

325
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:38,772
and I start every day by looking at it. This example is characters, but as we said,

326
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:43,316
it would work just as well with cards or whatever else. And what you're often looking for are the

327
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:47,800
groupings and the extremes and how they can go into categories, of which I've got sort of four

328
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,061
of them.

329
00:19:49,245 --> 00:19:50,566
First, you have your stars.

330
00:19:51,027 --> 00:19:53,229
These are your high performers of your game.

331
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:55,711
They're characters that are used frequently

332
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:57,632
and win frequently, and they'll make up

333
00:19:57,672 --> 00:19:59,133
sort of the meta of your game.

334
00:19:59,614 --> 00:20:01,716
For the most part, having these is great.

335
00:20:02,096 --> 00:20:04,358
You just want to make sure they aren't so good

336
00:20:04,398 --> 00:20:06,219
they're obsoleting the rest of your content.

337
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:08,801
For us, Bugs Bunny is an epic character

338
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:10,102
that you start the game with,

339
00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:11,684
so he's always kind of an outlier.

340
00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:16,155
Anything that's up here, just keep an eye out for them being too good.

341
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:19,737
And if they are, consider introducing a counter to them late.

342
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:23,600
You sort of know what players are going to be using a lot and you want to counter it.

343
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,821
Or, God forbid, nerf it if we ever have to.

344
00:20:28,105 --> 00:20:35,767
The next group are sleepers. These are your characters that win a lot but aren't used as much, and context is super important here.

345
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:41,749
Some of these are niche options that are only used sometimes in certain strategies but excel when they are.

346
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:46,390
Sometimes, if you see a super low ownership rate, they're just hard to acquire.

347
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:51,451
Both of those kind of characters are probably great at doing exactly what they need to do in your game.

348
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:57,059
But if those aren't the cases, then players may not understand how good the character is,

349
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,224
where to use it, how to use it properly, things like that,

350
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:03,129
which you want to try to fix with sort of events and messaging.

351
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,822
Your third category are underperformers.

352
00:21:07,323 --> 00:21:09,284
These are characters that aren't very good,

353
00:21:09,564 --> 00:21:10,885
and your players know that.

354
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:13,847
Some of these characters might be decent

355
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:15,729
and just waiting for their time to shine,

356
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:18,711
such as a specific event or the right team to be released,

357
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,073
but often they're just not good enough,

358
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:22,234
and this is where you're looking

359
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:23,735
to buff the characters in your game.

360
00:21:24,295 --> 00:21:26,797
Not every character in a game needs to be amazing,

361
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,658
but none of them should be this bad.

362
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:30,159
I'm sorry, Elmer.

363
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:33,613
The final category are fan favorites,

364
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:36,193
characters that are getting a fair amount of use

365
00:21:36,313 --> 00:21:38,314
but are still performing below average.

366
00:21:38,534 --> 00:21:40,174
In this case, we have Ralph the wolf,

367
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:41,875
who is not Wile E. Coyote.

368
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:42,855
There's a difference.

369
00:21:44,175 --> 00:21:45,396
They're super interesting

370
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,356
because people are still using them

371
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:50,017
despite them not actually being all that great.

372
00:21:50,597 --> 00:21:52,117
It might be aesthetic preference

373
00:21:52,197 --> 00:21:54,798
or the character or the weapon could be really fun to use.

374
00:21:55,318 --> 00:21:57,759
Either way, this is your chance to learn

375
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:00,640
what players actually like and make more of it.

376
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,821
And while you're at it, it doesn't

377
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:05,603
hurt to make these options that are popular a little more

378
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:06,243
competitive.

379
00:22:06,703 --> 00:22:08,144
You don't have to make them all-stars.

380
00:22:08,184 --> 00:22:09,866
People already like them, but it's

381
00:22:09,946 --> 00:22:11,767
nice to give the people what they want once

382
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:13,068
in a while as a game designer.

383
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:17,451
Just like with your economy, having those dashboards

384
00:22:17,491 --> 00:22:19,792
that you can check regularly and see how they're changing

385
00:22:20,253 --> 00:22:21,633
can give you enormous insights.

386
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,535
You are looking for sudden changes, again.

387
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:28,158
And is a character suddenly winning much more or less

388
00:22:28,198 --> 00:22:28,798
than it was?

389
00:22:28,918 --> 00:22:30,219
Is there a spike in usage?

390
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,345
Are there characters that are too strong or too weak for your costing of them in the game

391
00:22:35,425 --> 00:22:36,427
or their availability?

392
00:22:37,508 --> 00:22:42,715
The best character in the game being an easy to earn common or if a super hard chase prize

393
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:46,920
that takes months of commitment is kind of bad, those are both bad situations for your

394
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,922
game that you want to be able to spot in the data.

395
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,834
A subtle point, but one not to miss, is to look for how trends will impact the other

396
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:55,654
parts of your game.

397
00:22:56,154 --> 00:23:01,278
If a rare fire monster is suddenly on the rise as players discover a new team, that

398
00:23:01,318 --> 00:23:04,420
means players are going to be needing rare fire materials later on.

399
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,621
They're going to want the counter to that monster.

400
00:23:07,122 --> 00:23:11,565
If you can get ahead of those needs by looking at data trends, you're going to look like

401
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:12,585
a genius in your game.

402
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:15,543
So now that you're tracking data,

403
00:23:15,744 --> 00:23:17,084
what does good actually look like?

404
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:19,706
And here are some more best practices

405
00:23:19,786 --> 00:23:21,748
from what it does when you're doing it right.

406
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:25,070
First, you want to see that players are actually

407
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,991
playing the game.

408
00:23:26,331 --> 00:23:28,953
That's both steady retention as well as people actually

409
00:23:29,113 --> 00:23:30,674
using every feature in your game.

410
00:23:31,154 --> 00:23:33,456
You want to see healthy session times per day.

411
00:23:33,476 --> 00:23:37,179
And everything should kind of get better as players age.

412
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:40,421
That's usually a consequence of less invested players

413
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:41,081
churning out.

414
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:41,522
But if

415
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:45,605
that's not true and you're seeing a downward slope, then that's kind of a bad sign.

416
00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:50,468
You also want to make sure that no one part of your game is neglected by players.

417
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:55,151
There's always going to be things that people interact with more or less than others, but

418
00:23:55,692 --> 00:23:58,974
a healthy game is driving players through every piece it has to offer.

419
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:03,658
Check that there isn't something that players ignore because it's not really worth their

420
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:05,279
time, especially elder players.

421
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:10,437
You also want to make sure that everything in the game is actually purchased or used.

422
00:24:10,778 --> 00:24:16,285
That means core game economic items as well as things that consume currencies, premium or otherwise.

423
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:20,070
Like before, it's fine for some things to be niche,

424
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,915
but if no one is buying a particular item, that's a sign that something is off.

425
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:27,953
Specifically, be on the lookout for repeat purchases.

426
00:24:28,273 --> 00:24:31,295
If someone buys something like a gotcha item or store skew

427
00:24:31,435 --> 00:24:32,635
and then they buy it again,

428
00:24:33,035 --> 00:24:35,636
that's a sign that they're really liking

429
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:37,597
what they're getting and it's matching

430
00:24:37,637 --> 00:24:39,238
what you're selling it and you're merchandising

431
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:41,278
and it's a good way of checking to see the real value.

432
00:24:42,794 --> 00:24:48,039
When you're looking at the economy, the last thing you want is for everyone to feel like they have everything they need.

433
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:51,983
It's the fight for limited resources that makes a game economy work.

434
00:24:52,303 --> 00:24:57,868
And don't forget that as a designer, you control both the economy outflow as well as what players' needs are.

435
00:24:58,229 --> 00:25:01,612
That's recipes as well as creating the obstacles that they have to beat.

436
00:25:01,812 --> 00:25:03,154
Make sure you're using both parts.

437
00:25:04,188 --> 00:25:08,815
but the baseline here is to source most resources just above what players need

438
00:25:09,156 --> 00:25:10,257
as your starting place.

439
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:14,123
Players, as we said, need to always lack something, so you can create pinches or

440
00:25:14,163 --> 00:25:17,588
bottlenecks in your economy, those resources that players just don't get

441
00:25:17,628 --> 00:25:18,730
enough of, you know.

442
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:20,932
Fewer is better than many here.

443
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:23,934
If you have no pieces of a recipe to craft an item,

444
00:25:24,194 --> 00:25:26,195
it makes it feel like you're not getting anywhere at all.

445
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:29,057
But if you're just missing one or two key items,

446
00:25:29,177 --> 00:25:30,778
now you've got something to go after.

447
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:34,321
Those economic dashboards are key to making sure that

448
00:25:34,381 --> 00:25:37,563
they're lacking what you want and have enough of everything else.

449
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:40,485
If they're lacking something you're not trying to constrain,

450
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:43,146
you can drop it more freely and increase the availability.

451
00:25:43,901 --> 00:25:47,002
But when they are lacking the materials you intend, that's good.

452
00:25:47,342 --> 00:25:49,403
Limited and rare things create excitement.

453
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,144
That gives you a resource that you can give out

454
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:56,005
as a reward for difficult things, as something to grind over time,

455
00:25:56,286 --> 00:25:57,866
or as something to sell in your store.

456
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:02,348
Ideally, all three, since the best monetization methods sell time.

457
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,345
Finally, when it comes to balance, you want to check that players' actual experiences

458
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,007
match what you expect them to be.

459
00:26:10,628 --> 00:26:15,154
No one anything in your game should be much more effective than other things at the same

460
00:26:15,234 --> 00:26:15,594
cost.

461
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:20,941
If one common is twice as good as another that's earned at the same time, one of the

462
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:22,142
two of them might have a problem.

463
00:26:23,045 --> 00:26:26,706
We'll always make some characters that are intended for our specific strategies, but

464
00:26:27,506 --> 00:26:32,947
you know, it's a good rule of thumb. And please don't just make anything powerful or expensive.

465
00:26:33,387 --> 00:26:38,408
Players are so alert now to things that feel pay to win, whether they actually are or not.

466
00:26:38,908 --> 00:26:43,149
It's okay to have the occasional strong common, as long as it's not dominating everything.

467
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:48,891
A powerful epic that can be found through luck or sufficient time can be just as strong as one

468
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:52,952
that comes out of a gotcha or an event, since you have to set the baseline for what's strong somehow.

469
00:26:54,173 --> 00:26:56,255
In short, Tator is our friend.

470
00:26:57,216 --> 00:27:00,640
Monitor how each feature and piece of content in your game is used.

471
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:03,383
If only 20% of players engage with a feature,

472
00:27:03,443 --> 00:27:06,046
it's a good sign you have some work to do before it's perfect.

473
00:27:06,827 --> 00:27:09,070
Track your resource inflow and outflow,

474
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,114
creating dashboards to show you those unexpected changes, shortages, and surpluses.

475
00:27:14,196 --> 00:27:16,237
create the demand for materials in your game,

476
00:27:16,617 --> 00:27:18,237
and provide the supply accordingly.

477
00:27:18,877 --> 00:27:21,338
And once you know what players need and don't have,

478
00:27:21,618 --> 00:27:23,019
you can reward it or sell it.

479
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,640
That's actually the grand secret of monetization strategy

480
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,920
in RPGs in a sentence.

481
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,321
So I hope that helps.

482
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:33,053
I hope this talk helped some people out there.

483
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:36,416
We're a little low on time, so I won't do questions here.

484
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:39,098
But I'll be out in the breakout area just outside.

485
00:27:39,979 --> 00:27:41,380
And if there's anything that you don't have time for,

486
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,322
please feel free to contact me anywhere.

487
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:45,964
I will literally always talk about game design.

488
00:27:46,284 --> 00:27:48,106
And the slides from this talk can be found online as well.

489
00:27:48,606 --> 00:27:52,993
As a reminder, please fill out the Cessna evaluations that you should have just received.

490
00:27:53,314 --> 00:27:57,460
They're important to everyone running the conference and they are sort of ironically

491
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,346
the data analytics of this conference, so I would feel really bad if you don't.
