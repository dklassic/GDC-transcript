Hi, my name is Jason Grimblatt, and I work on a game called Caves of Qud that's currently

2
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:05,540
in Early Access.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,745
Caves of Qud is an open-world, science-fantasy, roguelike, RPG hybrid where you chisel through

4
00:00:11,785 --> 00:00:14,227
a layer cake of thousand-year-old civilizations.

5
00:00:14,827 --> 00:00:18,770
We've been doing a lot of experimentation with procedural generation, particularly around

6
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:21,212
narrative elements like backstory and world history.

7
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:26,037
In my talk this year, I'll be showing off the results of one experiment where we procedurally

8
00:00:26,117 --> 00:00:28,479
generate in-game books using Markov chains.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,384
You may have seen Markov chains on the internet used to generate funny or surprisingly poetic

10
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:35,346
text from a corpus of source text.

11
00:00:35,907 --> 00:00:41,092
In case of CUD, our corpus is every bit of text in the game, about 40,000 words, plus

12
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:43,034
some 19th century textbooks that we mix in.

13
00:00:43,947 --> 00:00:48,088
Beyond just generating text, we also insert bits of world state into the Markov chain,

14
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:52,530
so that the generated text contains secrets about the world, and you could research lore

15
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,631
at an in-game library.

16
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:57,392
So if you're interested in procedurally generated text, come on by.
