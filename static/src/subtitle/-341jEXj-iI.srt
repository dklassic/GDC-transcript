1
00:00:12,628 --> 00:00:17,250
I'm really honored to be speaking to this audience, a room full of the most talented,

2
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,592
most creative, most hardworking game developers.

3
00:00:20,472 --> 00:00:24,975
And I'm not also only honored to be speaking to you, I'm also a bit terrified of reading

4
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:28,017
the title of my talk, which is...

5
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:34,576
Oh, no one cares about your game.

6
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:37,197
There should have been a big explosion gun sound,

7
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:40,339
but it didn't quite go off, but you get the gist.

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,261
This is not only ...

9
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:46,743
I mean, the good news is that, of course,

10
00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:48,984
people care about your games, and the even better news

11
00:00:49,064 --> 00:00:51,646
is that I think this no one cares about your game mindset

12
00:00:51,846 --> 00:00:54,627
is one of the most helpful sentences

13
00:00:54,947 --> 00:00:57,229
and mantras I've learned in my marketing career,

14
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:58,590
and I hope in the next half an hour

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,711
I can explain to you how it's hopefully also helpful to you.

16
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:06,135
So how this talk came about is that I think in the recent years,

17
00:01:07,036 --> 00:01:09,599
generally marketing, games marketing has gotten a lot better.

18
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:12,182
People just got more professional, took it more seriously.

19
00:01:12,223 --> 00:01:14,145
There's more talks online, more resources.

20
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:18,310
And there's just great stuff where you can figure out how to set up your Steam page,

21
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,374
there's guides how to plan a marketing campaign, how to do TikToks.

22
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:23,500
All of that is getting great.

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,742
I think what's sometimes a bit missing is the qualitative aspect,

24
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:28,804
so you don't only do things right.

25
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:30,045
You make them good.

26
00:01:30,145 --> 00:01:31,706
How do you make them connect with people?

27
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:34,588
So there was a bit the idea and the basis for this talk,

28
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:37,830
like some guidelines, how you just get the right quality

29
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,112
of whatever communication you put out.

30
00:01:41,052 --> 00:01:42,714
So it's kind of an attempt of a system

31
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:44,915
that is a quality check for communication and assets.

32
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:48,157
My name is Thomas Reisenegger.

33
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:50,159
I'm the co-founder of Future Friends Games.

34
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,501
We are indie games PR agency,

35
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:53,922
but we're also indie games publisher.

36
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:56,564
In my career, I've worked over 100 games.

37
00:01:56,804 --> 00:01:58,366
Stop counting, it's probably a lot more.

38
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:01,966
Some of our clients are games like Vampire Survivors,

39
00:02:01,986 --> 00:02:04,048
The Forgotten City, Exo One, What the Golf,

40
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:06,209
the best game ever made, Frog Detective.

41
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,351
So, a lot of different indie titles.

42
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:12,033
And what we do for these games is quite different.

43
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:15,616
I really believe that every PR campaign that is really good

44
00:02:15,696 --> 00:02:18,258
is quite tailored for the game and for the needs and for the times.

45
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,940
So, sometimes we do press outreach, sometimes influencer stuff,

46
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,962
we make store pages, we make TikToks, try to go trending a lot.

47
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,325
Do Reddit posts, loads of different things.

48
00:02:28,485 --> 00:02:30,986
I hope that knowledge across loads of different games,

49
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,248
across a lot of different disciplines

50
00:02:33,288 --> 00:02:34,549
is gonna be helpful for the talk for you.

51
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,352
So let's talk about the main topics for today.

52
00:02:39,432 --> 00:02:41,354
First is the Avengers problem, of course.

53
00:02:41,554 --> 00:02:42,795
And then secondly, we talk about

54
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:45,156
how this no one cares mindset is gonna be helpful

55
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:48,538
at a micro level, but also on a macro campaign level.

56
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,621
So let's dive right in, and not to be dramatic, but.

57
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:57,613
We need to talk about the Avengers problem.

58
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:05,839
I think it's one of the cause why a lot of communication is held back a little bit from game developers and agencies

59
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,501
And it could be better and resonate with people easier

60
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:13,165
And I think understanding the core of the problem is going to be really helpful. So we just imagine a

61
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:16,848
game developer a marketing PR person just someone who needs

62
00:03:17,308 --> 00:03:20,571
Starts promoting the game and what you do naturally if you start doing that

63
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,151
You will copy what you already know.

64
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,732
Very human thing, makes sense.

65
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:26,893
That's a good starting point.

66
00:03:27,713 --> 00:03:29,254
The problem with marketing and PIs,

67
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:32,035
the most stuff that you see that is marketed at you

68
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,476
is the big stuff.

69
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:35,617
It's the Avengers, it's the Last of Us,

70
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:38,139
it's the God of Wars, it's the AAA games,

71
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:39,139
it's the 1% that you see.

72
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:42,168
that are really, really big.

73
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:44,349
But if you think about how those campaigns work,

74
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,551
they put, you put out like a little teaser tweet

75
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,571
and people go crazy.

76
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:49,112
And then you put on the first teaser trailer

77
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:50,072
and everybody goes wild.

78
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:51,713
And then you have another trailer

79
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:54,074
and everybody knows every scene and analyzes it.

80
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:56,436
And then the next one and you build up hype

81
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:58,237
and more hype, hype, and then you launch

82
00:03:58,277 --> 00:03:59,537
and it's like a big explosion.

83
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:01,018
And that's really great.

84
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,199
And that's just not how it works for like 99% of all games.

85
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:07,088
So I think understanding that you,

86
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,270
unless you work on those games or those big things,

87
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,532
you're just gonna have a very different experience

88
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:12,533
promoting your stuff.

89
00:04:13,894 --> 00:04:15,356
And to put it a bit more into context,

90
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:16,717
and I think to make it easy to understand,

91
00:04:17,638 --> 00:04:19,480
if we imagine we're at a music festival

92
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,861
and we're trying to reach this person,

93
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:25,285
that's our customer, and in the festival context,

94
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:26,626
it's someone we wanna make friends with

95
00:04:26,686 --> 00:04:27,347
because they look cool.

96
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:31,693
We have a quite different position than the band.

97
00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:33,414
The band is like the AAA games,

98
00:04:33,554 --> 00:04:34,755
because the people in the audience,

99
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:36,276
they show up for them.

100
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:37,757
They already know a little bit

101
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:39,398
about what this band does probably.

102
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:41,920
They're gonna watch them do a five minute drum solo

103
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,741
because what else are they gonna do they are here anyway

104
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:45,663
to get bombarded with that information

105
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:46,503
no matter if they want.

106
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:48,184
They're gonna pay attention.

107
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:50,766
If the band wants to charge them or make them jump,

108
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:51,787
they're gonna go along with it

109
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:54,829
because they just have this real power

110
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:56,290
of being in the spotlight.

111
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,948
Whereas you, again, 99% of all,

112
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:01,229
definitely all indie games,

113
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:03,130
but probably a lot of AA games as well,

114
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:04,271
or smaller AAA games,

115
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:08,275
they really have to work from a quite different point of view

116
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:10,737
because you're just like a random person in the audience

117
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:12,138
and you try to reach that other person.

118
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,340
So if you want to get their attention,

119
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,062
you probably have to stand out immediately.

120
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:18,644
You probably have like, when they look over,

121
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:20,305
you've got like one second to do something

122
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:22,447
that's noteworthy or funny or catches their eye.

123
00:05:23,027 --> 00:05:25,109
They might turn around and forget you again immediately.

124
00:05:27,364 --> 00:05:31,126
So you really have to just start from a different point of view

125
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:34,789
and work different to get their attention on you.

126
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,631
And the other problem is once you've convinced them

127
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,772
and once you got their attention,

128
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:41,134
they maybe tell their friend that's next to them

129
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,775
or two friends, but then there's still the whole other crowd

130
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:45,076
that has like never heard of you

131
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:46,057
and you still got to convince.

132
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:48,499
So I think that's kind of the mindset

133
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,280
how I approach PR marketing for indie games.

134
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,731
And now we look how we can make that work on a micro level.

135
00:05:55,551 --> 00:05:57,712
And what I mean by micro level is basically

136
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,152
everything you put out.

137
00:05:59,452 --> 00:06:01,613
It could be a Reddit post, it could be an email,

138
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:04,574
it could be your trailer, all form of communication.

139
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:08,616
And I hope those four rules that we're gonna go through,

140
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,076
the no one cares about your game rules,

141
00:06:10,096 --> 00:06:12,137
they're gonna help you whenever you do those things,

142
00:06:12,397 --> 00:06:15,298
kind of like as a checklist, to keep those things in mind

143
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:18,199
and make sure your communication is

144
00:06:19,563 --> 00:06:25,221
Avengers proof so you make sure you treat it like a person in the crowd and you don't treat it from a triple A perspective

145
00:06:29,685 --> 00:06:32,367
The very first rule is, get to the point quick.

146
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:33,728
And that's probably not a big surprise.

147
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,410
You've probably heard this in other marketing talks,

148
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,011
but I think it's really, really important.

149
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:39,713
And as running an agency, a big part of my job

150
00:06:39,753 --> 00:06:41,915
is just telling people this, get to the point quick.

151
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:42,836
It happens all the time.

152
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:43,616
You've probably heard it.

153
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:45,658
Indie game makes a trailer.

154
00:06:45,798 --> 00:06:47,860
It starts like, you know, with a logo,

155
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,322
and then another logo, and then it's environment shots,

156
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:51,743
and then 90% of the people are gone.

157
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:55,477
So front loading most of your assets in communication

158
00:06:55,517 --> 00:06:56,258
makes a lot of sense.

159
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:57,658
You show immediately what you have

160
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:58,739
within the first few seconds,

161
00:06:58,779 --> 00:06:59,820
you wanna get your point across.

162
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,621
What I've also like observed and learned over the years

163
00:07:03,662 --> 00:07:05,022
that for some games it's really easy.

164
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:07,624
Some games have a really obvious gameplay hook

165
00:07:07,984 --> 00:07:10,985
and you just show them the beginning and that makes sense.

166
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,687
But there's other games that have interesting concept,

167
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,868
interesting hooks that are maybe not gameplay driven,

168
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:19,530
but you still wanna get a point across in a few seconds.

169
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,510
So here's an example of

170
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:28,376
The launch trailer for Frog Detective 3, it's a GIF that we made out of the trailer, but it gets its own point across and it's gonna start now.

171
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:31,166
That's it.

172
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:36,288
You just zoom on the frog, it zooms out, it goes on the scooter, frog detective jumps

173
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:38,049
away, it looks a bit weird.

174
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:41,290
It really gets the point of this game across immediately.

175
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,212
If you like, like, quirky humor, if you like that art style, you probably don't need to

176
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,053
know straight away that it's a narrative game or, like, an adventure game.

177
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:53,615
That's also interesting, but, like, the big selling point of this game is just the humor of it.

178
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:57,989
So we tried to get that across in the starting scene.

179
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,631
And of course, like you know, no opening, nothing,

180
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:01,731
it just like zooms right in.

181
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:05,713
Sometimes you want to get a point across

182
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:10,475
that is maybe a bit less obvious.

183
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:13,096
And then you need to not get to the point straight away,

184
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:14,197
but you need to have something

185
00:08:14,237 --> 00:08:15,598
that keeps people hooked long enough.

186
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:18,485
So this is a game called Clone Drone VR.

187
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,390
It's like a robot sword fighting VR game.

188
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:22,958
And we made a post about the new loading screen,

189
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:23,980
and the loading screen got 300,000 views.

190
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,455
and how we did that was we said we added the most useless and best feature to our game yet.

191
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:34,839
So that gets people hooked immediately and we showed a nice gameplay in the background.

192
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:39,143
So we tricked people into like staying on there, obviously the TikToks it also goes

193
00:08:39,163 --> 00:08:42,926
with the sound which is not on here, and then we showed a loading screen.

194
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:44,087
Big success.

195
00:08:45,188 --> 00:08:48,151
You also see a lot of the examples I'm going to bring today are TikToks.

196
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:49,472
The reason for that is...

197
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:54,198
TikTok is really, really good in telling you if people are interested in your stuff

198
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,561
because their main metric is watch time.

199
00:08:57,282 --> 00:09:00,546
So as soon as people swipe away and don't watch your post, you're out.

200
00:09:01,086 --> 00:09:04,471
But those posts that have a good watch time, they go trending.

201
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:09,537
So it's a very good indicator to test out footage or gameplay hooks and see if they're interesting.

202
00:09:10,398 --> 00:09:13,321
If you want to see more how TikToks are made and learn more about that,

203
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:16,945
there's two really good talks. One is from Grace Curtis from Future Friends as well,

204
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:21,630
and the other one from Jared Tan, also from this GDC, about how he did the Cult of the Lamb TikTok.

205
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,495
So I can highly recommend if you want to know more about just TikTok specifically.

206
00:09:27,877 --> 00:09:30,660
Getting to the point quick is also essential on store pages.

207
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:38,723
I always say Steam store page, eShop page, your store page is your most single important marketing asset.

208
00:09:38,783 --> 00:09:41,765
90% of all people that are ever going to see your game, it doesn't matter how much marketing

209
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:43,667
you do, they come for your store page.

210
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,228
They just randomly stumble upon it.

211
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:46,629
It's a really big user base.

212
00:09:47,109 --> 00:09:48,490
This is how most people find your game.

213
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,333
So getting a lot of things across really, really quickly is extremely important.

214
00:09:53,374 --> 00:09:54,855
Here we see Townscaper, for example.

215
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:57,577
It says instant town building toy.

216
00:09:57,937 --> 00:09:59,778
You immediately know it's not a complicated game.

217
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,720
You know it's a toy. It's a very short sentence.

218
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,262
It indicates it's a small game, a small price.

219
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:05,963
So you get a lot of information across quick.

220
00:10:06,743 --> 00:10:08,965
But sometimes also getting the point across quick,

221
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:11,327
meaning getting the point across slow.

222
00:10:11,907 --> 00:10:14,569
So if you look at a strategy game or like a crafting game

223
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:16,351
that is really mechanics heavy and deep,

224
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,672
You often see on the successful one on the Steam page,

225
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:20,613
they have a wall of text.

226
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:22,894
That's obviously not getting to the point quick,

227
00:10:22,994 --> 00:10:24,936
but that just immediately makes clear

228
00:10:24,976 --> 00:10:26,457
that this is gonna be a really deep game.

229
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:28,298
So I think just keeping in mind

230
00:10:28,318 --> 00:10:30,139
what point you wanna get across

231
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,141
and what format you wanna use is really important.

232
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:37,073
The second rule, make things work for newcomers.

233
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:40,215
That's probably the most underrated,

234
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:41,897
the most often forgotten rule.

235
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:44,178
Again, I think that comes from the whole Avengers thing.

236
00:10:44,198 --> 00:10:47,781
I think indie games, or general game developers,

237
00:10:47,801 --> 00:10:49,703
are really good at talking to an audience

238
00:10:49,743 --> 00:10:50,843
that's already on board with them,

239
00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:51,764
because you're used to that.

240
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:52,725
You know how to...

241
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:55,246
update people and keep them in the loop.

242
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:58,768
But making things that work for newcomers constantly is quite hard

243
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,229
and also can just be a bit boring if you're a game developer,

244
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:02,690
you've already made this for seven years.

245
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,332
But keep in mind there's still so, so, so many people

246
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:06,452
that have never seen your game.

247
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:10,794
So one example I want to talk about here is Vampire Survivors,

248
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:12,295
where we helped making the launch trailer.

249
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,236
And this, of course,

250
00:11:15,372 --> 00:11:16,713
was a quite specific problem

251
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:20,056
because Vampire Survivors was in early access

252
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,558
and then went into 1.0,

253
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:24,621
but it's already sold millions of copies into early access.

254
00:11:25,281 --> 00:11:27,723
So I think a quite natural thing a lot of people would do

255
00:11:27,803 --> 00:11:29,565
is to really focus on making clear

256
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,166
what's new in the 1.0 update.

257
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:34,229
But for Vampire Survivors, we knew that on launch day,

258
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:35,791
there's gonna be hundreds of thousands,

259
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:38,113
if not millions of people that have never heard of the game

260
00:11:38,293 --> 00:11:40,135
and they're gonna find it on Steam that very day.

261
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:42,156
So it was really important to make

262
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:46,803
this two-folded message that works for existing and new players.

263
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:49,725
So what we did here is we start off by saying

264
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:52,828
120,000 positive reviews, zero vampires, be the bullet hell.

265
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:54,849
If you're an existing player,

266
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,651
you see the number of reviews, you're like, yeah, I'm one of them.

267
00:11:58,412 --> 00:12:00,593
You see the zero vampires, which is an in-joke,

268
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:02,154
there's no vampires in Vampire Survivors.

269
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,836
You probably get that and you think it's funny, hopefully.

270
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:09,119
And then also in the background, you see new characters from the 1.0 update.

271
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:11,961
So that's great if you already played the game.

272
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:14,943
If you've never played the game, you don't care about the new characters.

273
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,465
Well, you probably see the number of reviews and you go like,

274
00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:18,606
okay, that must be a good game.

275
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:20,528
You see the zero vampires.

276
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:22,429
You probably have no idea what that means.

277
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:25,071
Well, you probably get that it's quite a bit quirky.

278
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:25,771
It's probably funny.

279
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,473
And you know that's going to be indicating some kind of humor in this game.

280
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:31,275
And then be the bullet hell explains the gameplay.

281
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:35,358
Another example of making things work for newcomers,

282
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:36,820
again, really important on TikTok,

283
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,662
because 90% of your traffic on TikTok always come from new people.

284
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,773
is Clone Drone VR again.

285
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:44,913
There's a post with 900,000 views

286
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:46,194
where we cut the robot's hair,

287
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:47,794
so we just take it apart a little bit.

288
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:50,535
And this is like a fake post now with the text,

289
00:12:51,175 --> 00:12:52,636
where it says, hair cuttings with robot.

290
00:12:52,676 --> 00:12:54,496
And this is how I see a lot of developers,

291
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:55,657
how they would post it.

292
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:57,257
And that is perfectly fine

293
00:12:57,537 --> 00:12:58,858
if you talk to existing players.

294
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:02,415
However, if you talk to people who have never seen your game,

295
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:03,995
you need to do a lot more framing.

296
00:13:04,155 --> 00:13:05,616
So what we did here is we say,

297
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:09,697
guess our VR sword fighting game is now a robot hair cutting sim.

298
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:11,517
So with this short sentence,

299
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,378
we make clear for someone who has never seen this,

300
00:13:13,398 --> 00:13:14,798
that this is not a let's play,

301
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:16,679
this is not a mod of another game.

302
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:19,800
We say it's a VR game, we say it's usually a sword fighting game,

303
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,921
and we say it's our game, so they know it's the developer account,

304
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:24,921
and then we show the developer playing it on top.

305
00:13:25,502 --> 00:13:27,583
So you immediately also visually see it's a VR game.

306
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:30,684
So just with a simple sentence and a bit of extra visuals,

307
00:13:30,784 --> 00:13:32,365
you have set so much more context

308
00:13:33,085 --> 00:13:34,966
and really get people in that don't know your games.

309
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:39,828
You lose people immediately if they don't feel included

310
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:41,549
and they feel like this message isn't for them,

311
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:42,710
then they will just move on.

312
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:47,352
The same principle also works in emails.

313
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:53,150
This is the announcement email for a game called Europa that we work on.

314
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,852
And again, because it's completely new, we just try to establish context and get people on board.

315
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:00,693
So we say it's from Exo One publisher, similar game.

316
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,514
We say it's Ghibli inspired in the headline.

317
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:06,816
Also really important, on all the links we say this is new.

318
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:12,179
I can highly recommend that if you email press influencers, also players that may be on a newsletter.

319
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:14,074
They often miss stuff.

320
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,975
They often didn't read your last email

321
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:17,616
because you were on holiday, or they just missed it,

322
00:14:17,696 --> 00:14:18,717
or they just skimmed over it.

323
00:14:19,157 --> 00:14:21,199
So just making like really clear what's new,

324
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,061
it makes a lot of sense to feel people more included.

325
00:14:26,722 --> 00:14:28,964
Of course, there's nuances to this, like to most things,

326
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:30,645
like how much do you need to really explain

327
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:31,686
everything to newcomers?

328
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:34,407
If it's on your Steam page, if it's on TikTok,

329
00:14:34,488 --> 00:14:35,808
it's like super important.

330
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:38,230
If it's for your Discord or your newsletter,

331
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,251
people have signed up to that,

332
00:14:39,271 --> 00:14:41,012
so they probably know a little bit what your game is.

333
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:47,793
So there's nuance, but again today I really focus on the other side of it, because a lot

334
00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:51,036
of game developers are quite good at talking to existing players, but I think are less

335
00:14:51,076 --> 00:14:52,137
good at talking to new people.

336
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:56,230
The third rule is think of the environment.

337
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:58,912
That doesn't mean the planet, which you should also do,

338
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:00,833
but in this context, it means more that

339
00:15:01,394 --> 00:15:02,875
whenever we make any kind of asset,

340
00:15:02,995 --> 00:15:04,076
any kind of communication,

341
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:07,098
I really try to imagine who is gonna watch this and how.

342
00:15:07,738 --> 00:15:09,279
I think it's really easy to fall into trap.

343
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:10,680
Like, you know, you make a trailer,

344
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:13,062
you put it in your big 4K screen,

345
00:15:13,402 --> 00:15:15,764
you press play, and you watch every second perfectly.

346
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:17,825
Nobody watches trailers like that.

347
00:15:18,465 --> 00:15:21,526
How most people watch anything is like sitting on their sofa,

348
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:23,627
they probably watch Emily in Paris.

349
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:26,269
At the same time, they're like on their phone,

350
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:28,490
they switch between Twitter and TikTok,

351
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,531
they maybe talk to their partner on the side

352
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:32,011
and they think about what dinner to order.

353
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,914
So if you make any asset emulate communication,

354
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:39,177
I think making it visually and text-wise easy to read

355
00:15:39,237 --> 00:15:39,918
is essential.

356
00:15:40,538 --> 00:15:41,839
Here is the example for Gourdlets,

357
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,581
which I think is great, like a really short,

358
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:45,262
small looping video.

359
00:15:45,423 --> 00:15:46,864
It's really straight to the point.

360
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:51,128
What I also really try to do for really important assets

361
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:53,770
is that I put them in my video editor on my iPad.

362
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,811
and I skim through them.

363
00:15:57,252 --> 00:15:59,614
I try to look, if I look at them really quickly

364
00:15:59,774 --> 00:16:02,497
and in a small screen, does it still read nice visually?

365
00:16:03,037 --> 00:16:04,939
Because this is how most people are gonna see this,

366
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:06,681
before they actually pay attention to it.

367
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:11,405
Also thinking of the environment makes a lot of sense

368
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:13,567
in terms of what platforms people use.

369
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:14,608
This is a game called Figment 2.

370
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:19,370
I think they were like, okay, successful on most social media, did a great job.

371
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,231
But one thing that really, really took off for them was TikTok.

372
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:26,473
And the reason for that is because it's a game with musical boss fights where the bosses

373
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:28,473
are singing, which you're going to hear in a second.

374
00:16:29,474 --> 00:16:30,354
And that's of course great.

375
00:16:30,474 --> 00:16:32,935
This is the one social media platform where people watch with sound.

376
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:36,777
So if you know something like that, and then honing in on TikTok makes a huge difference

377
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:39,258
to keep the environment in mind when people watch it.

378
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:41,295
Figment2 has multiple musical boss fight.

379
00:16:41,695 --> 00:16:44,276
Everything here is nearly dead!

380
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:48,217
Wake up while you still have the chance!

381
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,037
Yeah, there's a party waiting!

382
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:50,917
So get out of your head!

383
00:16:53,898 --> 00:16:55,599
Rule number four is know your next step.

384
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:56,999
This is a sales funnel.

385
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:57,879
This looks boring.

386
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:58,719
This is boring.

387
00:16:58,919 --> 00:16:59,980
But it is helpful.

388
00:17:01,382 --> 00:17:04,623
You maybe seen it, it basically means first you try to get awareness,

389
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:08,005
and then you get the interest of people, and you try to like funnel that down,

390
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:11,727
and in the end they're going to buy your stuff or wish list or whatever you want to make them do.

391
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:17,289
And I think it's really, really important that you always know when you put something out,

392
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,130
what is the next thing a person should do.

393
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:22,171
You know, should they wish list, should they find more info,

394
00:17:22,212 --> 00:17:24,833
should they share it with your friends, and where they can do that stuff.

395
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:29,881
So I've seen it like too many times that you see a trending post,

396
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:32,545
but there's just no link to it or no more information to find.

397
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:38,012
However, this is a really good tweet from Ooblets' launch and you see no call to action.

398
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:40,608
because it's in the next tweet.

399
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:43,770
Because I think call to actions can be really cringe,

400
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,532
especially a lot of marketing people push for that.

401
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:47,572
Guilty, happens.

402
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:50,995
But I think it's really important on socials

403
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:53,937
that you are aware what's an acceptable moment

404
00:17:53,977 --> 00:17:55,177
to push information.

405
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:57,779
Also on TikTok, if you ask people to,

406
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,880
hey, there's the link, and you put it on screen,

407
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,761
they're not gonna do it.

408
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:01,942
Just have the link in your bio.

409
00:18:01,962 --> 00:18:03,703
Just make sure there's some more information to find,

410
00:18:04,303 --> 00:18:05,504
but be a bit more subtle about it

411
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:07,445
and just see how it works on this specific platform.

412
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:15,745
So the micro-level checklist, does your communication get to the point in the first few seconds?

413
00:18:15,966 --> 00:18:17,046
Does it work for newcomers?

414
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:21,428
Keep the platform and environment in mind, and also, does it point to the next step?

415
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:24,070
And now we go to the macro-level.

416
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:30,093
Now we go to the whole campaign planning and think about how the no-one-cares mindset can be helpful.

417
00:18:31,547 --> 00:18:35,230
Again, just showing your game is incredibly helpful

418
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,031
and I think something people don't do often enough.

419
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:40,134
Vampire Survivors, millions of copies,

420
00:18:41,215 --> 00:18:43,016
every day there's new people finding this game.

421
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:45,138
Every day you see new people in the Steam forums.

422
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,880
If you go through GDC and ask people,

423
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,061
there's going to be loads of people

424
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:50,402
that have never heard of this game.

425
00:18:50,582 --> 00:18:51,743
It's one of the biggest indie games

426
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,385
and we're at the Games Developers Conference.

427
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:56,007
Like I can't overstate how big the pool of people

428
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:56,987
is that don't know your game,

429
00:18:57,588 --> 00:18:59,009
even though if it feels repetitive to you

430
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:01,031
to just basically introduce it into them again.

431
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:08,258
Another example is Exo One, where we had loads of trending TikTok posts, 5-6 posts back to

432
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:11,363
back, all millions of views, half the comments, what's the game called.

433
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:13,126
It always reached new people.

434
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,877
This is another example of games we worked on.

435
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,119
One is called The Last Clockwinder.

436
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:20,640
The other one, Ziggy's Cosmic Adventure.

437
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:23,643
They both had trending posts before on multiple platforms.

438
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,285
When we started working on them,

439
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:27,187
the first thing we did was just like,

440
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:29,749
let's just make two posts that just introduce the game.

441
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,231
And they've been trending again.

442
00:19:32,012 --> 00:19:33,173
The reason for that is, again,

443
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:38,482
The people on Reddit that saw it this time maybe weren't on Reddit a month ago.

444
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,702
Maybe they were on honeymoon.

445
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:40,783
Maybe they didn't check Reddit.

446
00:19:41,284 --> 00:19:45,767
There is so many examples where people just come to a platform, or you have just missed it.

447
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:50,130
Whereas a game developer, I think it can just feel like, you know, you've done Reddit.

448
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,752
You had five trending posts, and you think everybody knows it.

449
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:53,633
Absolutely not.

450
00:19:53,713 --> 00:19:55,074
There's loads of people who will not know it.

451
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:58,276
There's also another good example of a game called Shotgun Farmers, which I think is one

452
00:19:58,296 --> 00:19:59,077
of the best TikToks accounts out there.

453
00:19:59,097 --> 00:19:59,537
I can highly recommend.

454
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,020
And they've got loads of different posts that really go into the community, talk to them,

455
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:10,461
introduce new features, really cool.

456
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:14,443
But you will also see loads of posts that just introduce the game, or just like the

457
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,584
history of the developer, how he quit his job to start making this game.

458
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:22,687
And again, every time this post goes out, they can go big and they can reach new people

459
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:24,007
that have just not been following you.

460
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:27,978
a bonus rule, know your money shot.

461
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:32,440
I think knowing what is the one shot that is really, really good for your game can change

462
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,140
a whole campaign.

463
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:39,102
Obviously, you then should use that one shot for your store page, for your launch email,

464
00:20:39,222 --> 00:20:41,823
for everything you put out that's important.

465
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:46,805
And I think what we've done recently is use TikTok kind of a way to beta test and

466
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,086
find out what this good shot is.

467
00:20:48,926 --> 00:20:52,249
For Clones Drone in the Dangerous Zone and Exo One, we made like 50 TikTok posts.

468
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:56,032
And you suddenly notice, like, whenever we use this certain scene or a very similar one,

469
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:57,073
we always go trending.

470
00:20:58,775 --> 00:21:03,659
Because the TikTok algorithm is so good at keeping track of who keeps watching or who swipes away.

471
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:09,004
So we kind of with that figured out what is our money shot, what is the shot that people really want.

472
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:14,228
And we purposely put them in launch trailers, we purposely start our launch TikToks with that.

473
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:17,952
And as you see by the numbers, it did pay off. 2 million views, 9 million views.

474
00:21:18,832 --> 00:21:23,316
So it can really help to use TikTok as a beta test for your best shots.

475
00:21:25,758 --> 00:21:28,199
Now we go into a PR campaign evolution,

476
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,160
what I think a PR campaign can look like

477
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,981
with this no one knows your game mindset.

478
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:33,902
Firstly, you've got to make a game.

479
00:21:34,082 --> 00:21:35,943
That's pretty hard, but once we're over that,

480
00:21:36,383 --> 00:21:37,764
we look at a regular PR campaign.

481
00:21:37,784 --> 00:21:40,185
That's actually a slide from one of my older GDC talks.

482
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:42,346
And it's quite, that's basic.

483
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:43,367
Like you reveal your game,

484
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:44,487
you do some PR stuff in the middle,

485
00:21:44,507 --> 00:21:45,288
and then you launch it.

486
00:21:45,968 --> 00:21:49,310
And I think the next step in the direction is rinse, repeat.

487
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,411
Make sure you keep repeating what your game is.

488
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,412
Recycle trailers, you know, change a little bit.

489
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:56,632
Put them out again.

490
00:21:57,112 --> 00:21:58,312
Try a different platform.

491
00:21:59,473 --> 00:22:01,993
We also had examples where people launched a game

492
00:22:02,013 --> 00:22:04,794
on Xbox and Switch, and then they go to PlayStation,

493
00:22:05,274 --> 00:22:07,415
and all their marketing just talks about the new features

494
00:22:07,435 --> 00:22:08,475
of the PlayStation version.

495
00:22:08,955 --> 00:22:11,116
But that doesn't make sense, because the PlayStation people

496
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:12,276
have never, ever seen your game.

497
00:22:12,676 --> 00:22:14,237
For them, it's a completely new game,

498
00:22:14,257 --> 00:22:15,277
so you've got to treat it like that.

499
00:22:15,397 --> 00:22:17,078
Again, just explain to them what your game is.

500
00:22:18,518 --> 00:22:19,258
And the fourth step.

501
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:20,855
Is adapt.

502
00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:25,698
And I think that's the whole matter of a really, really good, masterful PR marketing campaign.

503
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:30,361
I can't overstate, like, I think doing like step one, two, and three is incredibly hard.

504
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:34,544
Like just doing the stuff repeatedly is like 90% of the work and it's hard to pull off.

505
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:35,384
And well done if you do.

506
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:41,208
I think if you want to go to 100% and make it perfect, just keeping an eye open what works.

507
00:22:41,508 --> 00:22:43,970
And honing into that can make a huge difference.

508
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,971
We had campaigns where we tried lots of different things and suddenly,

509
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:49,612
Imgur really takes, so we did lots of Imgur posts.

510
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:52,273
We put out a demo, kind of not thinking much about it,

511
00:22:52,453 --> 00:22:55,734
demo takes off. It's like, cool, let's do a nail demo and a preview version

512
00:22:55,794 --> 00:22:57,015
and push the demo on TikTok.

513
00:22:57,455 --> 00:22:59,436
So just like, planning your campaign, great.

514
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:02,036
Being flexible, really, really big plus.

515
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,662
And the last kind of macro level learning for today,

516
00:23:07,702 --> 00:23:10,103
or recommendation, is understanding

517
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:11,103
the reach of multipliers.

518
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,984
Because no one knows about our game,

519
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,145
we want to make sure more people know about it.

520
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:17,265
So we need to reach as many people as we can.

521
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:19,866
And those are all multipliers.

522
00:23:20,947 --> 00:23:21,807
Probably know most of them.

523
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:23,748
And they all have a ceiling.

524
00:23:24,088 --> 00:23:26,089
If you post on TikTok, you can post quite a lot.

525
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:27,189
You can get millions of views.

526
00:23:29,926 --> 00:23:34,671
to your account and probably like high thousands of people to your store page.

527
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:38,394
If you do press outreach, it's great for profile building, but maybe it's going to be less

528
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:40,697
thousands of people that actually then go to your store page.

529
00:23:41,137 --> 00:23:42,658
So all those things have different ceilings.

530
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:45,301
Don't sue me, that's not scientifically proven.

531
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:48,224
That's just like gut feeling from working loads of different games.

532
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:50,846
And they all have a different importance.

533
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,689
But the main point I want to make on this slide, there's one thing that...

534
00:23:54,585 --> 00:23:56,226
has a lot more reach than anything else.

535
00:23:56,507 --> 00:23:57,468
And that's your store page.

536
00:23:57,968 --> 00:24:00,290
Can be a Steam page, can be a PlayStation console page,

537
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,812
it can be a VR page, whatever it is,

538
00:24:02,312 --> 00:24:03,554
the store page is the one thing

539
00:24:03,594 --> 00:24:05,155
where you have incredible reach.

540
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:08,338
Like, way better than the others.

541
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,931
So that doesn't mean you shouldn't do the other stuff,

542
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:15,432
because the other stuff is super important to get featuring on store pages.

543
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,453
If you have loads of social media followers,

544
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:19,714
if you do great press outreach,

545
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:21,655
you maybe get better featuring from Nintendo,

546
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:23,196
you maybe get into a Nintendo Direct.

547
00:24:23,656 --> 00:24:26,017
If you have loads of wish lists, you trigger the Steam algorithm.

548
00:24:26,577 --> 00:24:28,458
So you've got to do all those things anyway,

549
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:30,098
but I think just being aware

550
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:33,800
that the store page is the one thing that can make the biggest difference.

551
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:36,356
It's important if you have to prioritize,

552
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:39,237
if you have only a day left and you can decide

553
00:24:39,257 --> 00:24:41,058
if you send another press release

554
00:24:41,138 --> 00:24:42,459
or you could improve your Steam page,

555
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,040
please improve your Steam page.

556
00:24:44,821 --> 00:24:47,002
So I think that's the point I want to get across here,

557
00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:48,483
know what the main multipliers are.

558
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,825
So the micro-level checklist, show your game, show it a lot.

559
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,827
On the campaign planning, keep reminding people forever.

560
00:24:57,007 --> 00:24:58,629
There is no such thing as hype.

561
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:01,051
It's really almost impossible to build hype for an indie game

562
00:25:01,071 --> 00:25:03,153
because most people keep forgetting about it.

563
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:04,795
That's why wishlist is important,

564
00:25:04,815 --> 00:25:05,936
so they get an email on day one.

565
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:11,538
Reuse, recycle, rinse, repeat, reuse your assets, recut them.

566
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:13,880
Again, show your game as many times as you can,

567
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,201
show as many features as you can.

568
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:17,243
Don't feel like you can spam people.

569
00:25:17,343 --> 00:25:18,884
It's almost impossible for an indie game.

570
00:25:19,905 --> 00:25:23,307
It's possible with multi-million dollar marketing budgets.

571
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,249
It's not possible if you're just like a person

572
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:26,170
that puts out stuff.

573
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:28,872
Embrace the chaos and adapt

574
00:25:29,252 --> 00:25:30,833
and figure out your multipliers

575
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:32,375
and then prioritize accordingly.

576
00:25:34,462 --> 00:25:35,562
Thank you very much for listening.

577
00:25:35,582 --> 00:25:38,925
I should remind you to fill out the evaluation forms.

578
00:25:39,425 --> 00:25:41,347
I'm also going to be taking questions.

579
00:25:42,247 --> 00:25:44,649
I also want to wish you a really nice rest of your GDC.

580
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:45,130
Thank you.

581
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:58,940
If anyone had good questions, you can walk up to the microphone.

582
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,822
Otherwise, I'm also going to be outside later.

583
00:26:08,245 --> 00:26:09,427
Hi, thank you for the talk.

584
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:11,809
It was actually amazing, and I learned a lot here.

585
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:13,371
But one thing that I wanted to ask

586
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:16,074
was, do you think there are some type of advices

587
00:26:16,114 --> 00:26:17,875
you can do to integrate the design

588
00:26:17,915 --> 00:26:20,238
process of your game to better market,

589
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:24,322
or I guess try to optimize the marketing process as a whole?

590
00:26:26,015 --> 00:26:29,159
I think it definitely helps if your game markets itself.

591
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,921
It's not for all game types.

592
00:26:30,981 --> 00:26:32,343
It's going to be hard for narrative games.

593
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:36,248
But I think you're going to give yourself just a way better

594
00:26:36,288 --> 00:26:38,170
chance if you have something that's easily marketable.

595
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,895
So I think building a game with marketing and PR in mind is

596
00:26:41,955 --> 00:26:42,716
extremely helpful.

597
00:26:43,717 --> 00:26:43,957
Thank you.

598
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,555
I have two questions. I mean, thank you. Thanks again. Really, really nice talk.

599
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:55,440
To the pre-reveal, I mean, once you have not revealed the game yet,

600
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,563
could you have one, two insights there?

601
00:26:58,803 --> 00:27:01,886
Is it just finding out, you know, like, what are the right visuals?

602
00:27:01,946 --> 00:27:03,468
What will people pick up?

603
00:27:04,229 --> 00:27:06,811
And the second is, is there a way...

604
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:11,264
that you say, show your game, show your game.

605
00:27:11,684 --> 00:27:17,127
But is there a time where you put up your Steam page too early?

606
00:27:17,307 --> 00:27:21,989
I mean, all of a sudden it takes one, like, you know what I mean?

607
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:24,370
It's like, is it one year? Is two years too much?

608
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,232
Is it one and a half years? Like, what's your experience there?

609
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:28,713
It's a really good question.

610
00:27:28,753 --> 00:27:30,734
And I think it's also something that, like, changed over time.

611
00:27:30,754 --> 00:27:32,274
I think what we see at the moment is...

612
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:36,942
Game announcements that go big in the beginning and you get a lot of traffic straight away.

613
00:27:36,962 --> 00:27:39,564
You get something that we call wishlist velocity.

614
00:27:39,644 --> 00:27:41,585
So your daily wishlist are then really, really high.

615
00:27:43,226 --> 00:27:45,308
So with that in mind, I think it can be too early.

616
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:49,691
But if you have a really small game that probably you won't have that big reveal anyway.

617
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,433
In that case, I think I would just go early and start building from there.

618
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,297
Especially with store pages it's more tricky.

619
00:27:56,397 --> 00:27:59,159
I think on socials it's like pretty hard to be too early

620
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:00,960
because you can always say I'm just working on that.

621
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,080
It's just a prototype.

622
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,581
So I think as soon as it's interesting

623
00:28:04,061 --> 00:28:06,743
and you communicate that this is not all finished

624
00:28:06,843 --> 00:28:08,344
or you might be trying out things

625
00:28:08,444 --> 00:28:10,545
but you just start building an audience

626
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,026
I think you almost can't be too early for that.

627
00:28:15,253 --> 00:28:21,078
I'm great. I'm Grant by the way. Lovely to meet you all. Thank you for the lovely talk. It was really useful and really practical.

628
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:28,365
I really like that message about the fact that people don't really care about your game. And I think that really resonates.

629
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:32,476
Do you have any good examples of things that you've done

630
00:28:33,196 --> 00:28:35,597
where you've kind of got people really hooked in

631
00:28:35,957 --> 00:28:38,217
that maybe they started to kind of, you know,

632
00:28:38,257 --> 00:28:39,618
care a bit more about those games

633
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:41,958
and really kind of brought them in closer?

634
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,419
Maybe could you go into a bit more detail

635
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:43,959
with some of those?

636
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:44,999
Yeah, of course.

637
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:49,081
Like I said before, there's loads of examples

638
00:28:49,121 --> 00:28:50,241
where once you get people hooked in,

639
00:28:50,281 --> 00:28:51,041
they want to know more

640
00:28:51,321 --> 00:28:52,682
and they're really super interested.

641
00:28:54,503 --> 00:28:58,007
Just like again on Vampire Survivors, it's a massive fan base.

642
00:28:58,067 --> 00:28:59,890
You have a lot of really, really hardcore fans.

643
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:05,657
And they look for really inside jokes in the games, in the code.

644
00:29:05,737 --> 00:29:07,339
They just find everything.

645
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,045
So there's obviously a certain point where people get interested and they do care.

646
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:16,584
But I think often that's not the problem for the game developers,

647
00:29:16,604 --> 00:29:18,625
because again, that's your experience,

648
00:29:18,665 --> 00:29:21,227
how you as a consumer usually interact with those things.

649
00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:24,128
Once you're interested, you know how to keep up to date,

650
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:28,471
but the big majority of people just getting them on board is the challenge.

651
00:29:28,491 --> 00:29:39,895
Thank you.

652
00:29:34,915 --> 00:29:35,255
Hello there.

653
00:29:36,293 --> 00:29:37,194
I have a question for you.

654
00:29:38,095 --> 00:29:42,259
First of all, I enjoyed your presentation, but I'm thinking about how we as a team can

655
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:43,279
develop our game.

656
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,604
Our game is free, and it has educational resources as well.

657
00:29:49,565 --> 00:29:57,273
But how, as a team, here in America, how can we really target market this as a free game

658
00:29:57,393 --> 00:29:58,754
for educational purposes?

659
00:29:59,821 --> 00:30:04,282
Yeah, I think there's like a specific niche where a lot of those more classic gaming channels

660
00:30:04,322 --> 00:30:07,243
are maybe harder to reach or interact with.

661
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,703
I would think there's definitely avenues.

662
00:30:09,883 --> 00:30:12,184
If you find the right subreddit, I'm sure you could have success.

663
00:30:12,284 --> 00:30:17,885
And again, TikTok, I think, is a great platform because it's so specific how it targets people.

664
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:21,706
And if you're a bit personal, I'm sure you could find people that are interested specifically

665
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:25,787
in that kind of game more than in traditional YouTubers or gaming sites.

666
00:30:25,827 --> 00:30:29,668
So I would probably look into social media that's good at targeting, for your case.

667
00:30:33,638 --> 00:30:34,299
Thank you very much.

668
00:30:44,202 --> 00:30:49,103
Cool. I think there were all the questions and yeah, I'm going to be outside if anybody else wants to have a chat. Thank you very much.
