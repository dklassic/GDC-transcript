1
00:00:05,642 --> 00:00:11,765
Okay. Hello, everybody. Nice to see you all. Welcome back to GDC. Or if you haven't been

2
00:00:11,785 --> 00:00:21,430
to GDC, welcome to GDC. My name is Jason Vandenberg. I am the design director at ArenaNet. And

3
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,312
so we're just going to launch right in. Let's get going, shall we? We've got a lot to cover.

4
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:31,995
For the last eight years or so, I have been embarked on an attempt to merge together all

5
00:00:32,035 --> 00:00:34,776
the stuff that we know about player motivation into one.

6
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:36,847
Grand model.

7
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:41,850
Um, uh, it's settled on, around the big five.

8
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,912
Um, and I'm gonna take you through a real quick primer on what this was,

9
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:47,413
uh, just in case you haven't attended.

10
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:51,275
First, uh, has, who has attended a previous talk of mine on the engines at play?

11
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:54,697
Okay, good, so, uh, primer is worthwhile.

12
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:56,238
Okay, so it began with the big five.

13
00:00:56,918 --> 00:00:59,961
Um, uh, the Big Five is a personality model.

14
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:03,384
Uh, sort of like the, the, the, which Lord of the Rings characters are you tests

15
00:01:03,424 --> 00:01:04,886
that you get on, you know, BuzzFeeds, right?

16
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:06,627
Um, except it's accurate.

17
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,029
It, it has science behind it.

18
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:11,292
Uh, although, you know, those tests are surprisingly accurate, I think,

19
00:01:11,332 --> 00:01:12,153
from time to time, right?

20
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:12,553
They're pretty good.

21
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,835
It has in it these five different motivations,

22
00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:19,217
of different domains of motivation,

23
00:01:19,237 --> 00:01:22,878
and inside each of those is six facets,

24
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:26,380
individual facets that are spectrums of human motivation,

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,601
and at this point.

26
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:30,362
There is way too much data on that slide.

27
00:01:30,682 --> 00:01:33,544
We are not going to be able to digest anything like this.

28
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:38,486
So along the way in doing research, for a variety of reasons, we simplified the Big

29
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:41,288
Five model and turned it into neuroticism goes away.

30
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,469
If you're curious as to why, you can come and

31
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:49,834
talk after the lecture. And then what we did is we looked for the motives that were the

32
00:01:49,874 --> 00:01:55,700
most useful when talking about gamers. That did a very nice reduction. We were able to

33
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,983
reduce it down to eight motivations, which we then...

34
00:01:59,824 --> 00:02:03,246
mapped into gameplay preferences.

35
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:05,989
So the idea is, if I'm interested in adventurousness,

36
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:09,511
I'm going to like games that have that kind of experience in it, right?

37
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:12,854
And we took these aid and we turned it into these.

38
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:15,596
These are what it maps to, the four domains of play.

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,723
and we turned it into a chart because we're designers

40
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:24,167
and we like charts, especially if they're a two by two.

41
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,750
Two by twos reveal the universe's truths, man.

42
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,671
Two by twos are the best.

43
00:02:30,113 --> 00:02:32,475
And like many people, when we were doing this work,

44
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:36,219
we came to the conclusion that this kind of personality test

45
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,182
is an excellent predictor of what I like to call taste.

46
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:45,921
Which is, when I sit down to play a video game, what kind of game would I tend to play?

47
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:49,545
It's not necessarily what I will play, people will play a great deal of games,

48
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:54,372
but when I ask you what your favorite games are and you take this personality test,

49
00:02:54,392 --> 00:02:56,815
we find a nice correlation between those two things.

50
00:02:57,597 --> 00:02:58,077
So that's nice.

51
00:02:58,357 --> 00:02:59,698
And that gives us archetypes.

52
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:02,961
We can sort of assign characters to this

53
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:08,265
to give us an idea of each of these types of personalities

54
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:08,725
and who they are.

55
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:11,787
We reduced all of that down to this nifty symbol.

56
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:14,289
So for the purposes of this talk,

57
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:18,612
this symbol stands for personality theory, just in general.

58
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,033
So we're gonna talk about personality theory in general.

59
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:22,515
So that's the first model in the engines of play.

60
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:24,917
And there's a GDC talk on that, if you're interested.

61
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:30,179
The second part is this timeline, which is the player's journey.

62
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:33,059
Over time, players encounter your game,

63
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,320
oh, I've heard about it, and then they try it out,

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,041
and then when they like it, they continue to play it, right?

65
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:42,261
And then over time, they'll adapt it into their identity,

66
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:44,822
and they will become players of this game, right?

67
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:47,303
I go from, I've played this game, to I play it.

68
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:48,643
And what we've learned is, oops,

69
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:51,784
what we've learned is this personality theory,

70
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:54,104
personality theory does a great job.

71
00:03:54,705 --> 00:04:00,191
of predicting the early experience of your gameplay behavior,

72
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:03,855
but it does a very poor job of predicting what will cause you to stick around.

73
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:07,239
It doesn't predict whether or not you will buy the sequel.

74
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:09,281
So, we need another model.

75
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:10,923
Fortunately, we have one.

76
00:04:12,304 --> 00:04:14,006
Self-determination theory.

77
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:15,547
Very, very good stuff.

78
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:17,407
This is predicted by a thing called SDT.

79
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,588
Who's heard of SDT?

80
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:20,048
Who is aware of the, yes, good?

81
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:21,189
Okay, good.

82
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:22,829
If you get interested in this topic,

83
00:04:22,869 --> 00:04:24,229
if you're interested in player psychology,

84
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,270
this is the model to study.

85
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,451
Like this one is that the root foundation,

86
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:31,932
this predicts what people really want out of your game,

87
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:34,592
what makes a game meaningful in your life.

88
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:36,613
This model is where we get the idea

89
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:39,234
of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation.

90
00:04:39,454 --> 00:04:40,754
Okay, so what are they, real quickly?

91
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:41,775
Autonomy.

92
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,751
Is the universal urge to be causal agents of-

93
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:47,092
Sorry, I'm getting an animation problem there.

94
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:49,673
Universal urge to be causal agents of one's own life,

95
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,073
which means I like to make choices.

96
00:04:51,253 --> 00:04:54,375
I like to make choices and see those choices reflected in the world.

97
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:58,096
Mastery is the universal seek to control outcomes and experience.

98
00:04:58,516 --> 00:05:00,517
Relatedness is just getting better at things.

99
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:02,458
Whoa, why am I- I need to turn off animations.

100
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:03,218
This is what I need to do.

101
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:08,278
Um, well, alright, I'll try to control the unruly slide monsters, okay.

102
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:12,059
Relatedness is this universal want to interact and be connected to people.

103
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:14,540
So, we like to have choice, we like to get better at things,

104
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,061
we like to relate to other people.

105
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:20,483
Fortunately, this guy, Scott Rigby, and Immersive as a group,

106
00:05:20,623 --> 00:05:24,864
translated this into game terms, which is pens.

107
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:25,324
So.

108
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,908
This does a great job of predicting the other side of the thing.

109
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:33,350
It does a great job of predicting what games you will stick around for

110
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,212
and whether or not you will buy the sequel.

111
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:39,335
Does your game satisfy autonomy, mastery, and relatedness?

112
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:39,975
Cool.

113
00:05:41,116 --> 00:05:41,316
All right.

114
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:48,033
So, we have these two models, we have personality theory, we have our timeline, we have SDT,

115
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:52,136
so it was time, of course, to form player psychology Voltron.

116
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:02,436
We just put them all in one model, that's all we did.

117
00:06:03,117 --> 00:06:04,537
So this is where we were.

118
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:05,638
This is the engines of play.

119
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,880
So I gave a talk in 2016 about how players move

120
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,182
from taste to satisfaction.

121
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:15,504
And understanding the player's journey

122
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:17,164
is what the engines of play is all about,

123
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:19,446
to give designers and developers a model

124
00:06:19,506 --> 00:06:20,947
that will help you understand what's going on

125
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:21,727
in your player's mind.

126
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:24,549
Okay, so we are far from done.

127
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:34,410
So far, also, I want to throw out, I have had the luxury of using existing data and existing models.

128
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,753
Now we're going to look for a... we're going to fill this hole in the middle of the model.

129
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:42,197
There's a hole in the center, but there isn't a great deal of data to go around on this.

130
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:44,479
So we're going to venture out into some scary territory here.

131
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:46,940
The question that we're gonna answer in this talk is,

132
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,521
how do people get from one side to the other?

133
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:53,081
Something magical happens when we go from,

134
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:56,622
I want to play this game, to I'm becoming quite satisfied with playing this game.

135
00:06:56,662 --> 00:06:58,283
And I'm gonna call this thing drives.

136
00:06:59,303 --> 00:07:04,344
Drives is the name that I have given to our more chemical motives.

137
00:07:04,784 --> 00:07:05,145
Okay?

138
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:07,185
So, what are we talking about here?

139
00:07:07,305 --> 00:07:07,845
What is the thing?

140
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:11,186
So, I have a coin in my hand here.

141
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:11,846
I'm gonna flip it.

142
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:14,467
Is it heads or tails?

143
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:17,657
Okay, so you feel that?

144
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,159
Feel that sense?

145
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,360
It's curiosity.

146
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:23,142
Did you decide to feel curious?

147
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,304
Just happened, right?

148
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:27,845
It's curiosity.

149
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:28,946
It was heads, by the way, it was heads.

150
00:07:29,106 --> 00:07:30,027
So, good job.

151
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,188
If you guessed heads, you were right.

152
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,571
So, I'm stimulating your curiosity drive there.

153
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:38,354
Everyone has one, some more than others, right?

154
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,075
Some of you may be like, oh, I don't feel it very much,

155
00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:43,337
but it's there, and it's not something we decide to have.

156
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:47,999
When we go around a corner, curiosity is with us every day.

157
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:50,820
When we come around a corner, curiosity is what is

158
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:53,701
getting us to predict what we're gonna see around the corner

159
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:55,422
or get us curious about what we're gonna see

160
00:07:55,702 --> 00:07:57,523
when we go around that corner, even if we know,

161
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,043
even if we've been there many times before.

162
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:01,344
So curiosity is a drive.

163
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:02,485
There are others.

164
00:08:04,305 --> 00:08:06,406
Saving, as an example, collecting things.

165
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:09,127
If I was to hand out a $1 bill,

166
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:10,507
who among you would say no?

167
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:13,893
We will all take the $1 bill, because what the heck?

168
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:14,553
You know, right?

169
00:08:15,053 --> 00:08:15,894
That would be fine, right?

170
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:18,475
Saving is also, you wouldn't make a decision

171
00:08:18,555 --> 00:08:19,576
as to whether or not you want that

172
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:21,277
if there's no strings attached,

173
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:22,558
then why would you not, right?

174
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:23,098
It's reasonable.

175
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:25,899
Saving is another one.

176
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,620
There are others.

177
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:28,921
Vengeance, right?

178
00:08:29,662 --> 00:08:31,663
I punch you, you punch me right back.

179
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:35,579
social contact, right, the drive towards social contact,

180
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:38,943
learning, we like to learn, we're going to drive forward on things.

181
00:08:39,725 --> 00:08:42,869
Now, at this point, you may be thinking that I have gone mad.

182
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:47,898
I mean, surely this is the most obvious topic in the world, right?

183
00:08:48,018 --> 00:08:53,401
I mean, how can there be an entire GDC talk about, you know, what's in the box, right?

184
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:54,441
I mean, we know about this stuff.

185
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:56,002
I'm gonna roll the dice. It's randomness.

186
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:58,263
This is not stunning material, right?

187
00:08:58,283 --> 00:08:59,644
What the hell are you doing, Vandenberg?

188
00:09:00,204 --> 00:09:01,645
And what does this have to do with the model?

189
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:03,105
All right, well, let's go back.

190
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:03,986
Here's the thing.

191
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:08,187
I had long intended to add a section to the engines of play,

192
00:09:08,587 --> 00:09:10,248
to add this section to the engines of play,

193
00:09:10,888 --> 00:09:12,108
as like an appendix, right?

194
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:14,509
Just like, oh, and then I'm just gonna add this part about drives, right?

195
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:20,050
Surely, I thought, right, there has been a ton of research into this, right?

196
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,231
That we're gonna just add drives to it,

197
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,352
I'm just gonna go and pull all the research off of the shelf,

198
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:25,052
and then we're gonna be done.

199
00:09:25,312 --> 00:09:26,993
So I went to the research, right?

200
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,393
Went out and went looking for the research.

201
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:29,653
Now...

202
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:33,078
I did not find what I expected to find.

203
00:09:33,098 --> 00:09:35,221
I was sorely disappointed.

204
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:41,527
If you are a research scientist interested in human behavior, please, for the love of

205
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:43,329
all that matters, just fill this library.

206
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,252
It turns out, but why?

207
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:48,174
Why is there so little?

208
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:48,795
There's some.

209
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:49,756
We'll talk about that in a minute.

210
00:09:49,776 --> 00:09:50,216
But why?

211
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:50,977
Right?

212
00:09:51,418 --> 00:09:51,598
Well...

213
00:09:52,313 --> 00:09:53,655
give it some thought and some consideration,

214
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:56,077
and it turns out the whole concept of drives

215
00:09:56,237 --> 00:09:58,719
has some problems in it that makes it

216
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,762
not a great target for grant money

217
00:10:02,543 --> 00:10:05,165
and research time and academic attention.

218
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,208
There's some risky stuff in here,

219
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:10,870
and not always in the ways that one might expect.

220
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:11,911
Here's one.

221
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:14,753
So addiction is related to drives.

222
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:21,167
You could be the research scientist who makes the claim and proves that games are addictive,

223
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,830
or tries to make that claim to prove that, or proves that they're not,

224
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,791
but do you want to be that person?

225
00:10:26,811 --> 00:10:29,554
Do you want to be embroiled in that controversy?

226
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:31,756
Would you want to be the center of that? I know you would.

227
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:33,277
Obviously you would, you troll.

228
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:34,298
Here's another one.

229
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:35,879
Sex.

230
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,641
Sex is another one. Sex is a drive.

231
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:39,802
Very, very powerful one.

232
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:43,786
What kind of reward is waiting for a researcher on the other side of attempting to study the sex drive?

233
00:10:44,862 --> 00:10:47,224
Kinsey did this in the 50s and it ruined him, right?

234
00:10:47,284 --> 00:10:48,325
And his whole entourage.

235
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:50,226
So this is a dangerous topic.

236
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:51,407
I mean, we would love to know.

237
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:52,687
We're all very interested, of course.

238
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:54,489
But there's not a great deal of research

239
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:57,891
that is conclusive around exactly what each of us

240
00:10:58,011 --> 00:10:58,591
are interested in.

241
00:10:58,611 --> 00:10:59,572
Bloodlust is another one.

242
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:02,304
I'm gonna do some research on blood lust.

243
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:04,386
Turns out there are not many white papers on this topic.

244
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:06,728
Who here has seen Forbidden Planet?

245
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:07,949
Who knows about this story?

246
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:09,731
Okay, sci-fi classic, by the way,

247
00:11:09,771 --> 00:11:11,132
if you're interested in old people movies.

248
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:15,596
In this film, a mad scientist has his brain boosted

249
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:18,039
to the point where his deeper mind generates a monster,

250
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,881
which is spoilers all over, so now you've seen the film.

251
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:24,203
What we're talking about here is the id.

252
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:27,505
It's an amazing piece of science fiction technology.

253
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:29,827
This was special effects, and it's so good.

254
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:31,728
It scared the shit out of me when I was seven.

255
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:34,289
Monsters from the id.

256
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,110
What is the id?

257
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,693
So Freud was wrong about a great many things.

258
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,512
It turns out he was not so wrong about this idea

259
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:45,974
of there being a superego, an ego, and an id.

260
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:48,995
Deep inside our mind, there's a large part of our brain

261
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:53,217
that is occupied with dealing with how to chemically respond

262
00:11:53,257 --> 00:11:56,138
to our environment, just keeping us alive and surviving.

263
00:11:56,898 --> 00:11:58,599
And it's creepy, this part.

264
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:01,260
We are not necessarily in direct control of our id,

265
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,201
and even bringing it up in casual conversation

266
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:04,982
is often a little bit unnerving.

267
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:07,983
So these are drives.

268
00:12:09,092 --> 00:12:13,497
I don't think that I'm saying anything controversial when I say that they're probably chemical

269
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:15,098
as much as they are motivational, right?

270
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,440
So I went looking.

271
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,781
So what did I find?

272
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,123
I found a lot of material on violence in video games.

273
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:24,584
Something like 95% of the white papers that you'll find

274
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,045
are about violence in video games.

275
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,207
Like anyone who's been through the last 20 years,

276
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:29,388
not surprised by that.

277
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,610
There's some contradictory stuff on addiction,

278
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,131
and then there's not much else.

279
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:38,114
There's exactly one reasonable model, and it's this thing.

280
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:40,115
Stephen Reese, who's a researcher,

281
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:42,537
came up with this thing called the 16 basic desires theory,

282
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:43,678
which,

283
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:48,294
is in the area of what I am talking about.

284
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:49,535
I don't want to go through all of these.

285
00:12:49,575 --> 00:12:53,518
I want to let you know that this exists.

286
00:12:53,818 --> 00:12:56,841
It's an interesting model, but it is incomplete

287
00:12:56,881 --> 00:12:58,262
as far as taxonomies go.

288
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:00,544
Scratch the surface a little bit

289
00:13:00,684 --> 00:13:02,446
and we end up with some missing,

290
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:04,107
so we already used some of these in the talk,

291
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:06,889
but scratch the surface here and we're missing a few.

292
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:08,411
I'll throw a couple of examples out there.

293
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:10,693
Awe is an example of one that got overlooked.

294
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:12,314
Awe is the experience of.

295
00:13:13,038 --> 00:13:15,161
you know, wanting to witness beauty, right?

296
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:16,903
You stand in front of the, you know,

297
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:18,264
stand in front of the great valley

298
00:13:18,324 --> 00:13:19,486
and go, wow, that's amazing, right?

299
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:20,807
That experience of far cry.

300
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:22,169
Pat and Tay is here.

301
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,571
Prediction, here's another one.

302
00:13:26,503 --> 00:13:31,624
Prediction is, our brain is constantly preoccupied with predicting what is about to happen.

303
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,645
I think this is what happens when we watch a waterfall.

304
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:36,526
Why are waterfalls and trees swaying in the breeze beautiful?

305
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:40,707
I think it's because our brain is constantly predicting what is about to happen and we're

306
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:45,049
fascinated by the slight deviations between what we think will happen and what actually

307
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:45,649
happens, right?

308
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:48,770
So prediction is something that we are constantly engaged in.

309
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:53,328
So there's more, there's lots, we can go through these, right?

310
00:13:53,508 --> 00:13:56,230
But let's compare now, I hope I've anchored in you

311
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,292
kind of what we're talking about, this sort of root feeling.

312
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:02,314
Let's compare these experiences to the stuff we talked about

313
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:05,616
at the beginning of the talk, the personality story stuff.

314
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,358
Let's talk about our preference for fantasy or realism.

315
00:14:08,398 --> 00:14:12,220
There's this facet in the big five called imagination, right?

316
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:12,981
I mentioned it before.

317
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:15,161
And if you score high on imagination,

318
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:17,342
and if you score high, you have a high level of imagination,

319
00:14:17,862 --> 00:14:20,243
and if you score low, it's called factor orientation.

320
00:14:20,923 --> 00:14:22,823
High scorers are more interested in their inner world

321
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:24,024
than they are in the outer world,

322
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:25,524
and factor orientation people are interested

323
00:14:25,544 --> 00:14:28,125
in the outer world more so than their inner world.

324
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:31,265
This maps to a preference for fantasy and realism, right?

325
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:33,686
So, you know, it predicts a play preference for,

326
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,546
if you score high in imagination,

327
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:36,507
you're gonna tend to be interested

328
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:37,647
in more fantastic settings.

329
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:40,808
We get our Alice and Sam, right?

330
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:43,392
You feel how different this is?

331
00:14:44,574 --> 00:14:47,036
Now we're talking about sort of higher brain stuff.

332
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:49,138
Now we're talking about stuff that you have a choice over.

333
00:14:49,258 --> 00:14:50,359
Now we're talking about something

334
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,362
that is a lot more comfortable for us to discuss

335
00:14:53,422 --> 00:14:54,864
and more comfortable to compare.

336
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:59,168
Okay, so to take some extreme examples,

337
00:14:59,188 --> 00:15:00,710
just to further illustrate the issue,

338
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,311
I think, and the reason why there isn't much research.

339
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:04,614
You know, if these are drives,

340
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:10,623
How would you feel if I were to talk about our preferences in sexuality as a spectrum?

341
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:15,805
I don't mean your orientation, I mean what you're into, your kinks.

342
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:19,745
How many retweets do you think that slide would get?

343
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:29,588
This is what I mean by drives are not comfortable for us to study.

344
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:31,885
Academics feel the same way.

345
00:15:31,905 --> 00:15:34,487
Like, I don't want to do a study about a king.

346
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:35,707
That is not a thing, right?

347
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,489
There's another question.

348
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,430
How many of these are considered virtues?

349
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:44,333
Family, sure.

350
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:45,954
Order, maybe.

351
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:49,896
Who among us would be proud to say I'm high in bloodlust?

352
00:15:51,477 --> 00:15:52,158
High in vengeance.

353
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:53,919
Yeah, I'm really a very vengeful person.

354
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:55,540
Right?

355
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,141
Yeah, again, I see.

356
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:02,211
my design manager to re-in that, ladies and gentlemen.

357
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:08,753
So, how many of us would be comfortable admitting

358
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:10,953
and having a very strong drive towards power

359
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:13,514
or vengeance in doing these studies, right?

360
00:16:14,614 --> 00:16:17,355
Okay, so drives live in this strange zone

361
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,875
between what we would call physical reflex, dodging, right?

362
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:24,936
And what we think of as ourself, as us, right?

363
00:16:25,296 --> 00:16:27,497
Our drives are things that happen to us.

364
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:29,677
They are not us.

365
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:31,774
Generally.

366
00:16:32,194 --> 00:16:34,734
Contrast this to things like for our desire for mastery,

367
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,775
for cooperation, for fantasy.

368
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,335
These are things we would consider us

369
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:40,976
instead of things separate from, right?

370
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:45,237
So this is our topic for today.

371
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:51,179
The understudied, undermodeled subject of drives.

372
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:56,652
So, how does this apply to game design, right?

373
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:58,995
What should we do with this information?

374
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:00,536
Well, I have a theory.

375
00:17:00,877 --> 00:17:02,198
So I mentioned at the beginning,

376
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:03,559
I will lay it out in some details now.

377
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:05,061
Players use their personal taste

378
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,842
to guide themselves into our game.

379
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:08,764
They pick experiences they want

380
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,366
based on what they have learned they like.

381
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:13,409
And those tastes are widely variable.

382
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,231
We are very, very different in our tastes, right?

383
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:20,053
But they draw those kinds of experiences,

384
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:21,134
these wear off quickly.

385
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:23,816
They wear off very, very rapidly, in a number of minutes.

386
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,637
If I like explosions, right?

387
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:27,678
Like, yeah, one explosion, two, three, four,

388
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,841
okay, fine, I got it, fine, explosions, fine, explosions, boy.

389
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:33,342
It doesn't take long for that to wear off, right?

390
00:17:33,362 --> 00:17:37,605
And why do I keep playing when I get tired of that?

391
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:39,527
Because I do keep playing.

392
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:42,358
I play for 90 minutes or more, right?

393
00:17:42,378 --> 00:17:42,918
I'm not alone.

394
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,958
And after this initial experience is satisfied,

395
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:45,878
what keeps me going?

396
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:47,879
Here's a question.

397
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:50,740
So Scott Rigby showed that with his pens model,

398
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,660
that as time goes on, as play goes on,

399
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,301
all players want the same thing.

400
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:57,141
They want autonomy, mastery, and relatedness.

401
00:17:57,401 --> 00:17:59,341
And without those things at the long game,

402
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:00,322
players will walk away.

403
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:02,262
They'll leave, right?

404
00:18:03,862 --> 00:18:04,503
But here's the thing.

405
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,903
Getting there requires a higher investment of time.

406
00:18:09,313 --> 00:18:12,654
Before mastery can begin to be felt by a player,

407
00:18:12,894 --> 00:18:14,234
they have to understand the rules

408
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:15,634
and they have to have time to work them out.

409
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,035
Before autonomy can begin to be felt,

410
00:18:18,115 --> 00:18:21,136
I must see the outcome of my choices in some way.

411
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:23,377
Before relatedness can begin to be felt,

412
00:18:23,897 --> 00:18:25,477
I have to have established some sense

413
00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:26,717
of my place in the community.

414
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:28,298
It takes time for that to occur.

415
00:18:28,578 --> 00:18:29,778
It doesn't happen in 30 minutes.

416
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:32,559
It takes a number of hours for this to occur.

417
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:33,879
So why do I stick around?

418
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:35,360
Okay.

419
00:18:37,238 --> 00:18:37,798
Here's my theory.

420
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:39,499
Between these two experiences,

421
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,760
between taste and satisfaction,

422
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:44,283
is a place where boredom can take the player out, right?

423
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:46,525
A game that does not reach out

424
00:18:46,565 --> 00:18:48,546
to help the player through the tough times

425
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:51,648
will have a hard time convincing players to stick around

426
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,889
long enough to get to the good stuff.

427
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,112
So, drives are best used,

428
00:18:57,172 --> 00:18:58,613
and this is how we use them today,

429
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:01,956
as in game design to help the player cross the gap.

430
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:05,887
from initial taste to long-term satisfaction,

431
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:08,270
which is what I put in the title of the talk,

432
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:13,596
so I'm trying to get this point across.

433
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:16,479
Using these drive satisfactions of all different types.

434
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:19,746
Designers create breadcrumb trails

435
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:25,349
of short-term, high-value successes for the player

436
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:26,430
that carry them along.

437
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,431
Now, of course, there's lots of ways to misuse this,

438
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:29,552
and I'm not gonna go into those

439
00:19:29,592 --> 00:19:30,933
because I'm not interested in those.

440
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:33,394
I'm interested in the positive values, right?

441
00:19:34,895 --> 00:19:35,475
But here's the thing.

442
00:19:35,695 --> 00:19:37,376
Every game you've ever loved

443
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,998
and every game ever made does this.

444
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:44,240
This breadcrumb trail exists throughout, right?

445
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,100
OK.

446
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,901
Let's look at some examples.

447
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:53,084
So strangely enough, of course, oops, let me back up.

448
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:55,745
Strangely enough, most of you, I'm guessing,

449
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:56,986
how many designers in the room?

450
00:19:57,006 --> 00:19:58,606
Oh, wow, a lot.

451
00:19:58,686 --> 00:19:58,826
Good.

452
00:19:59,347 --> 00:19:59,767
Producers?

453
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:01,708
Programmers?

454
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:03,389
Yay.

455
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:04,649
Audio people?

456
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:05,870
Artists?

457
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:07,111
Cool.

458
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:07,631
All right.

459
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:07,951
Cool.

460
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,105
So, most of you probably already know how this stuff works.

461
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,466
I mean, we've gotten into the topic, right?

462
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:19,130
We're all personally very familiar with how these drives sort of function.

463
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:25,358
But we will become better at understanding how to use these things in a day-to-day basis

464
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:27,921
by going a little bit deeper and breaking apart.

465
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:32,085
these experiences in more detail so that we can get our hands around it.

466
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,147
So I'm going to take you on a tour through Curiosity,

467
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:40,492
just to give you an example that I hope you can use as a way to

468
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:43,894
then go and do this exercise, this kind of thinking on your own,

469
00:20:44,835 --> 00:20:46,997
with other drives that you're interested in your game design later on.

470
00:20:47,177 --> 00:20:48,278
Okay, so Curiosity is cool.

471
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:50,979
Let's take an example.

472
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,780
We are exploring this place.

473
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,161
It's a regular city.

474
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:56,121
A grid of streets, basically.

475
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:57,262
Just a simple grid.

476
00:20:57,302 --> 00:20:58,222
I can predict that.

477
00:20:58,682 --> 00:21:00,623
So what's happening in the curious part of my mind?

478
00:21:01,623 --> 00:21:06,545
At every corner, I make a guess about what I'm going to see, but until I actually look

479
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:10,787
around the corner and verify that the grid pattern has continued, it's just an assumption.

480
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:13,829
If the designer wants to provide the player

481
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:16,510
a regular breadcrumb trail of curiosity satisfaction,

482
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,972
what they need is surprises every so often, right?

483
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,153
Now it's not incredibly novel to think

484
00:21:23,173 --> 00:21:25,415
that I have to put unique and interesting variations

485
00:21:25,475 --> 00:21:26,535
inside a level design, right?

486
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,616
You see what I mean by you already know this?

487
00:21:29,137 --> 00:21:30,737
Right, if it was just an empty grid

488
00:21:30,937 --> 00:21:32,178
that was 100% predictable,

489
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,059
boredom would set in almost immediately.

490
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,540
Okay, so that's not terribly revealing,

491
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,581
but let's keep going and see what this can reveal for us.

492
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:39,982
What about a place like this?

493
00:21:41,826 --> 00:21:43,729
Every direction here is filled with uncertainty.

494
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:46,634
Now me, I love places like this.

495
00:21:46,754 --> 00:21:48,116
I love exploring places like this.

496
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:50,139
Whenever I think about exploration,

497
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,341
this is exactly what I think about.

498
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:52,924
And boy, did I spend a lot of time

499
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,146
in this particular forest.

500
00:21:55,737 --> 00:21:59,659
So, it is easy here for sameness to slip in, of course,

501
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:01,701
if the terrain isn't varied, and if I get lost,

502
00:22:01,761 --> 00:22:05,063
we can be in trouble here, but what works here

503
00:22:05,503 --> 00:22:09,325
is keeping sightlines short, varying the terrain,

504
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:11,887
and to give the player a way to every now and then

505
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:14,889
pull out and sort of get a view of the lay of the land.

506
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:17,570
The moment I see something like this,

507
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:22,734
my curiosity is satisfied until I reach a place

508
00:22:22,754 --> 00:22:24,435
where I really can't see what's ahead of me.

509
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,813
Now maybe that's what the designer wants.

510
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:29,133
Maybe the point is to focus on the light at the end there.

511
00:22:29,153 --> 00:22:31,013
Maybe there's an interesting object or a chest

512
00:22:31,114 --> 00:22:34,314
that they want to be sure that the player catches, right?

513
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:37,015
Or maybe this space is boring

514
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,795
and you should do something more interesting with it, right?

515
00:22:39,635 --> 00:22:40,096
Up to you.

516
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:43,616
In an environment like this,

517
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:47,637
curiosity now is gone, it's totally sidelined, right?

518
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,118
There is in fact going to be a desperate dearth

519
00:22:50,318 --> 00:22:51,558
of curiosity satisfaction.

520
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,699
You're not relying on that at all.

521
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:53,739
This is an endurance test.

522
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:01,611
Anyone who's played Journey knows how important the heights of the sand dunes were to convincing

523
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:04,732
yourself that maybe, maybe over this next one there'll be something, oh no, there's

524
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:04,972
nothing.

525
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:08,072
Okay, maybe over the next one, maybe else, oh, there's still nothing there.

526
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:08,693
Right?

527
00:23:09,113 --> 00:23:10,973
Fifteen times later, one thing, a rock!

528
00:23:11,193 --> 00:23:11,353
Right?

529
00:23:14,233 --> 00:23:16,154
Curiosity is about the unseen, right?

530
00:23:16,254 --> 00:23:19,254
Again, not novel, but we're breaking it down, right?

531
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:24,255
Trying to become conscious of something that is normally largely unconscious.

532
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:29,251
So we've established in some simple form how the drive satisfaction of curiosity

533
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:31,993
functions on a second-to-second, minute-to-minute basis.

534
00:23:33,054 --> 00:23:37,959
The player's brain is a side process, has a side process in it that is always generating

535
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,682
these little bursts of curiosity about anything unseeable.

536
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:46,190
in the world around them. Which is why horror games work, by the way.

537
00:23:46,571 --> 00:23:51,941
Right? This is, you know, in a situation like this, I've had all of my curiosity

538
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:55,448
sidelined except for that one corner around the end at the end of the hallway.

539
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:57,683
And then all I have to do is put in a sound

540
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:59,603
that is a little bit suggestive,

541
00:23:59,643 --> 00:24:01,264
and now suddenly I'm fixating

542
00:24:01,364 --> 00:24:03,365
on exactly what's gonna be around the corner, right?

543
00:24:03,385 --> 00:24:05,385
Making predictions about what I'm going to see.

544
00:24:05,405 --> 00:24:08,146
So there's many uses of this internal drive.

545
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:11,087
And again, I'm just sensitizing you to the process.

546
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:13,868
The notion here is not that this is particularly revelatory,

547
00:24:13,908 --> 00:24:16,509
but that this is how we should learn

548
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:17,869
to analyze these experiences.

549
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,670
But let's go back to our exploration.

550
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,211
We can say it this way.

551
00:24:24,123 --> 00:24:27,405
By chaining these little moments of curiosity satisfaction,

552
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:31,227
by creating breadcrumb trails of drive stimulation,

553
00:24:31,347 --> 00:24:34,389
our players will be able to journey through our locations,

554
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:35,970
often multiple times,

555
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,872
without accumulating enough boredom to be driven away.

556
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,753
I want you to think about boredom

557
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:44,074
as something that accumulates in players as they go.

558
00:24:44,814 --> 00:24:45,015
Right?

559
00:24:45,295 --> 00:24:46,455
And drive stimulation,

560
00:24:46,515 --> 00:24:48,797
the role of drive stimulation is to stave off boredom.

561
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:54,818
So why? How does that work? Let's take it one step further.

562
00:24:54,978 --> 00:24:58,741
Freed from boredom, the player can now stay a while.

563
00:24:58,861 --> 00:25:01,183
Stay a while. Listen. Hey, there it was.

564
00:25:01,824 --> 00:25:03,526
Um, little call out there.

565
00:25:03,926 --> 00:25:07,249
Um, they can come to understand the layout of a space.

566
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:09,851
Their curiosity pulls them into nooks and crannies

567
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:12,574
and encourages them to look at the place from multiple vantage points

568
00:25:13,134 --> 00:25:14,956
to reward them for making guesses and stuff.

569
00:25:14,976 --> 00:25:18,399
And then along the way, they're filling in their internal model of the world.

570
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:22,288
so that when a challenge appears suddenly,

571
00:25:22,928 --> 00:25:25,209
they are able to fall back on this database

572
00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:27,170
that they weren't aware they were accumulating

573
00:25:28,891 --> 00:25:31,392
and experience the satisfaction of mastery.

574
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:36,015
They mastered it painlessly

575
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:39,597
by being drawn around the space, okay?

576
00:25:40,097 --> 00:25:42,638
It made, we, by placing all these small satisfactions,

577
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:43,819
it made this experience a pleasure,

578
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:45,040
and in fact, if it was designed well.

579
00:25:46,696 --> 00:25:48,417
And depending on how well the designers did their job,

580
00:25:48,617 --> 00:25:50,138
that experience was effortless for them.

581
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:56,622
Okay, so, drives are the bridge between initial taste

582
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:58,604
and long-term satisfaction, cool.

583
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:03,867
All right, so how do I turn it into something

584
00:26:03,907 --> 00:26:04,788
more useful for that?

585
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:06,109
What am I trying to do here?

586
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:07,409
What is the goal?

587
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,731
I hope by now I've over-made my point

588
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:10,411
so it's nice and clear.

589
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:18,346
First thing I want to do is, you're familiar with Jesse Schell's lenses, the book of lenses, yes?

590
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:19,908
If you haven't, you should read that thing.

591
00:26:20,848 --> 00:26:22,670
Jesse Schell.

592
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,532
I want to give you a new lens, right?

593
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:27,194
I want to give you a new lens, the lens of moment-to-moment drive satisfaction.

594
00:26:27,475 --> 00:26:29,136
I want you to think about these questions.

595
00:26:29,377 --> 00:26:31,739
I want you to ask yourself, as you're designing the game,

596
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:35,903
what are you, are you providing your player enough variation and enough drive,

597
00:26:35,943 --> 00:26:37,184
second-to-second drive satisfaction?

598
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:41,057
to carry the player from initial taste to satisfaction.

599
00:26:41,137 --> 00:26:43,960
That's the, this is one takeaway that I want you to have.

600
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:46,522
Is there, but is there something else?

601
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:49,677
Could we have a taxonomy?

602
00:26:49,737 --> 00:26:50,738
Could we have a list, please?

603
00:26:50,758 --> 00:26:51,978
It would be great if we could just have a list

604
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:53,679
of all the drives, that would be amazing, right?

605
00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:56,521
Well, we've got this one, and I'm borrowing it,

606
00:26:56,561 --> 00:26:58,242
like I'm using some of these in here.

607
00:26:58,942 --> 00:27:01,944
But the problem is, the TLDR version of that

608
00:27:02,044 --> 00:27:04,025
is that if there is a list of all of these,

609
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:04,765
I haven't found it.

610
00:27:04,805 --> 00:27:06,626
If anybody knows of a list like this,

611
00:27:06,706 --> 00:27:08,607
please send me an email or reach out to me.

612
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:11,289
I would love to see it, but as far as I can tell,

613
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:12,309
it has not been studied.

614
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,111
But that's okay, because I hope that a lot of what I've said,

615
00:27:17,531 --> 00:27:19,412
maybe I'm rearranging the ideas in your head,

616
00:27:19,492 --> 00:27:21,152
but it should make a certain amount of sense.

617
00:27:21,192 --> 00:27:22,333
We know how these things work.

618
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:23,613
Let's try a different approach.

619
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:24,834
Let's ask ourselves this question.

620
00:27:25,274 --> 00:27:26,914
Is there anything new out there?

621
00:27:27,294 --> 00:27:28,255
Is there a drive?

622
00:27:28,735 --> 00:27:31,976
Is there a drive that you are not aware of, potentially,

623
00:27:31,996 --> 00:27:34,456
that we don't have a language for yet, right?

624
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,097
That you should know about,

625
00:27:37,237 --> 00:27:39,018
that can make a huge difference

626
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:41,618
in your design efforts moving forward?

627
00:27:41,678 --> 00:27:43,299
Is there something that we have overlooked?

628
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:44,574
Wouldn't that be cool?

629
00:27:45,615 --> 00:27:45,875
OK.

630
00:27:47,196 --> 00:27:48,678
The answer is yes, absolutely.

631
00:27:49,198 --> 00:27:49,719
Tenement friend.

632
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,704
Dan Cook asked me at lunch or dinner a couple months ago,

633
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:57,967
he was like, what game design ideas

634
00:27:58,007 --> 00:28:02,192
have you encountered in the last year that have blown your mind?

635
00:28:04,074 --> 00:28:04,674
And this is it.

636
00:28:04,895 --> 00:28:05,675
This is the one for me.

637
00:28:05,956 --> 00:28:06,036
OK.

638
00:28:07,048 --> 00:28:08,609
TendonBFriend, let's go.

639
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,791
First, I was introduced by this idea

640
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:12,592
by the inimitable Brie Code,

641
00:28:12,752 --> 00:28:14,513
who has given multiple talks on the topic.

642
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:15,574
If what I'm going to tell you,

643
00:28:15,674 --> 00:28:16,575
if you find this interesting,

644
00:28:16,635 --> 00:28:19,757
I absolutely recommend that you go and look at her videos,

645
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:21,238
read her work on the subject.

646
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:22,378
There's lots of other people

647
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:23,919
who are sharing this information.

648
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,341
Who here has heard of TendonBFriend?

649
00:28:27,502 --> 00:28:29,323
Oh, nice, a few.

650
00:28:29,463 --> 00:28:30,043
We're getting there.

651
00:28:30,363 --> 00:28:30,584
Good.

652
00:28:31,284 --> 00:28:33,866
We're gonna continue the presentation now.

653
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:34,506
Okay, so.

654
00:28:35,348 --> 00:28:36,168
What is Tendon, my friend?

655
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:41,072
In the year 2000 around, Dr. Shelley Taylor,

656
00:28:41,112 --> 00:28:46,156
doctor and colleagues, did a review of adrenaline research

657
00:28:46,176 --> 00:28:50,218
done during the heyday of fight and flight research in 70s.

658
00:28:50,379 --> 00:28:51,439
Although the fight and flight,

659
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:52,640
so all the research that was done

660
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,362
that established fight or flight as a theory

661
00:28:55,983 --> 00:28:57,864
happened in the 70s.

662
00:28:58,564 --> 00:29:01,246
And Dr. Taylor and her colleagues had reviewed it.

663
00:29:02,627 --> 00:29:05,450
They found that, so most of the research had been done on rats,

664
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,013
by exposing themselves to stress, like electric shocks, right?

665
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:10,615
And then sampling their adrenaline levels, right?

666
00:29:10,695 --> 00:29:12,517
It was, that's how it was done.

667
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,719
And this is how the fight-or-flight theory was validated.

668
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:16,801
The idea was we put these rats under stress,

669
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:19,303
and then their adrenaline levels go up,

670
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,846
they get more aggressive, oh, this is a thing, right?

671
00:29:22,226 --> 00:29:22,606
Basically.

672
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:27,180
So it turned out though that there was a bunch of data,

673
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,721
there was a bunch of rats in the study

674
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,541
who didn't match the theory.

675
00:29:30,842 --> 00:29:33,363
There was a bunch of noise in the sample

676
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,163
in all of these tests.

677
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,384
And so they did what any reasonable scientist would do,

678
00:29:37,404 --> 00:29:38,885
which is they threw out the data, right?

679
00:29:42,135 --> 00:29:46,878
It should come as no surprise that it was all the female rats that they threw the data out.

680
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:56,204
Anyone who has been following the revelations about scientific research up until today would not be stunned by this.

681
00:29:58,705 --> 00:30:01,307
Dr. Taylor found this to be striking, to say the least,

682
00:30:01,547 --> 00:30:05,229
because part of the reason they had gone on this re-examination in the first place

683
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,591
was that from an evolutionary standpoint,

684
00:30:09,693 --> 00:30:13,696
Fight and flight isn't complete enough

685
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:16,078
to explain human behavior.

686
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,220
It kind of is incomplete as a theory.

687
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,581
Let me explain to you what I mean.

688
00:30:19,982 --> 00:30:21,183
The fight or flight model is based

689
00:30:21,223 --> 00:30:22,224
on this very simple assumption

690
00:30:22,244 --> 00:30:24,326
that when we sense a threat, right?

691
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,126
We go, ah, threat!

692
00:30:25,447 --> 00:30:27,669
Our body shoots adrenaline into our bloodstream

693
00:30:27,689 --> 00:30:28,729
and our heart rate goes up

694
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:30,611
and our muscles, we get ready to run or whatever, right?

695
00:30:31,352 --> 00:30:32,273
This is good, it makes sense.

696
00:30:33,454 --> 00:30:35,655
To determine whether or not we're going to run away

697
00:30:35,716 --> 00:30:36,596
or battle the tiger.

698
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:38,215
Good theory, right?

699
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,915
Seems to make sense and it applies to a lot of things.

700
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:40,736
Here's the problem.

701
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,597
From an evolutionary standpoint,

702
00:30:42,637 --> 00:30:44,377
when you apply the same fight or flight model

703
00:30:44,418 --> 00:30:47,339
to anyone responsible for the life of another,

704
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,960
children in particular, but any other person,

705
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,921
anyone who's responsible for someone else, right?

706
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:53,782
This theory doesn't work out,

707
00:30:53,902 --> 00:30:56,123
because if you're responsible for a life of another person

708
00:30:57,164 --> 00:30:59,705
and the tiger shows up and you run,

709
00:31:01,106 --> 00:31:02,866
you both die because you're slow.

710
00:31:03,347 --> 00:31:04,367
The tiger's gonna catch you.

711
00:31:06,622 --> 00:31:09,264
If you fight and then you lose,

712
00:31:10,185 --> 00:31:13,127
the person that you were responsible for dies.

713
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:14,588
This is not a good adaptation.

714
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:16,810
So what do you do in this situation?

715
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:18,432
We are collective tribal monkeys,

716
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:21,714
so we run into this situation a lot, right?

717
00:31:22,055 --> 00:31:24,297
This happened all the time when we were evolving, right?

718
00:31:24,897 --> 00:31:26,518
So caregivers are in a predicament,

719
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:29,421
one that the simplicity of fight and flight

720
00:31:29,961 --> 00:31:30,702
doesn't really resolve.

721
00:31:30,742 --> 00:31:31,523
We need a better theory.

722
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:33,544
So, tend to befriend.

723
00:31:34,783 --> 00:31:38,764
Doctors Taylor were interested in this, not in adrenaline, but in oxytocin,

724
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,325
which is inaccurately called the love chemical.

725
00:31:42,825 --> 00:31:47,546
But oxytocin increases when we kiss or when we hug,

726
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:49,586
when we're in positive social situations.

727
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,727
The theory of tend to befriend is this.

728
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:56,028
The idea is that people, especially women, and we'll come back to that,

729
00:31:56,308 --> 00:31:58,268
evolved social means for dealing with stress

730
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:01,449
that involved caring for offspring.

731
00:32:02,009 --> 00:32:06,092
and protecting them from harm or turning to the social group for protection from offspring.

732
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:11,117
So this is the theory. If a tiger shows up and you're responsible for the life of a child,

733
00:32:11,357 --> 00:32:19,645
a better tactic is to yell for help, hide, and then do everything you can to care for and protect

734
00:32:20,046 --> 00:32:23,469
the other person that you are responsible for, hoping that the dice go in your favor

735
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:25,691
in the form of, say, a bunch of reinforcements.

736
00:32:27,436 --> 00:32:28,096
This works.

737
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,298
This is a strategically sound idea.

738
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:33,140
What this means is, evolutionarily,

739
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,524
it makes more sense for caregivers

740
00:32:38,884 --> 00:32:42,146
to experience an increase in the drive to care

741
00:32:43,507 --> 00:32:45,709
when experiencing fear than it does for them

742
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:47,950
to have an increase in the desire to fight.

743
00:32:50,222 --> 00:32:52,703
tension, stress, increase in the desire to care.

744
00:32:53,684 --> 00:32:55,625
And if you're responsible for the life of a child

745
00:32:55,665 --> 00:32:58,567
or for another, right, before the tiger shows up,

746
00:32:59,487 --> 00:33:02,849
it is to your great advantage to have already established

747
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:04,870
a bunch of care and support network

748
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,331
with as many other people as you can.

749
00:33:07,012 --> 00:33:09,113
Because while one caregiver, right,

750
00:33:09,373 --> 00:33:11,254
protecting a person is no match for a tiger,

751
00:33:12,175 --> 00:33:14,856
20 caregivers with a child, right, is dinner.

752
00:33:15,631 --> 00:33:16,912
Right? Good to go.

753
00:33:17,633 --> 00:33:20,055
So, the idea is that stress and fear trigger,

754
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:21,916
in some large part of the population,

755
00:33:22,016 --> 00:33:24,599
an increase in oxytocin, not adrenaline.

756
00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:26,200
Okay? That's the notion.

757
00:33:27,161 --> 00:33:28,682
The adrenaline response still happens,

758
00:33:29,283 --> 00:33:31,544
but in many people, the oxytocin one wins.

759
00:33:32,805 --> 00:33:33,066
Okay.

760
00:33:33,866 --> 00:33:37,409
So, people evolve a social means for dealing with stress

761
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:38,750
that involves caring for offspring,

762
00:33:39,211 --> 00:33:40,072
turning to the social group.

763
00:33:40,492 --> 00:33:40,932
Cool!

764
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:42,814
All right. Nice.

765
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:49,354
Now you might understand, given the dominance of adrenaline and fight or flight gameplay in video games,

766
00:33:49,454 --> 00:33:52,638
why this notion is, I think, I'm putting this forward to you, right?

767
00:33:52,658 --> 00:33:55,101
I think this is a very interesting theory.

768
00:33:55,121 --> 00:33:59,466
But before we go on, I want to talk a little bit about the meta.

769
00:34:00,187 --> 00:34:05,890
here, because our subject today is affectionately referred to as evolutionary psychology.

770
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:13,394
We're talking about the lens of behavior in evolutionary, and also by its much less fun

771
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:14,955
name gender determinism.

772
00:34:15,495 --> 00:34:19,838
So gender determinism is of course a belief that humans, that behavior is determined by

773
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:22,319
biological factors, specifically gender.

774
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,442
Humans are very, very good at detecting gender differences even when they're not there.

775
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:33,007
I mean, there are plenty of gender differences, but we're also really good at overextending

776
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:33,728
our analysis.

777
00:34:34,488 --> 00:34:36,410
Let me give you an example of what I mean.

778
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:39,072
This is what Dr. Taylor said, right?

779
00:34:39,652 --> 00:34:42,895
People evolve social means for dealing with stress and etc.

780
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:45,056
This is what was reported.

781
00:34:58,036 --> 00:34:59,937
Ah, okay.

782
00:34:59,957 --> 00:35:02,439
I would like to demonstrate the mistake

783
00:35:02,459 --> 00:35:04,500
that's being made here so that we understand

784
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,861
how this happens, right?

785
00:35:09,263 --> 00:35:11,105
Agreeableness, so I'm going back to the Big Five

786
00:35:11,145 --> 00:35:11,605
for a second.

787
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:14,187
One of the domains in the Big Five is called agreeableness.

788
00:35:14,207 --> 00:35:15,928
Okay, agreeableness is what it sounds like.

789
00:35:16,168 --> 00:35:17,689
Are you an agreeable person, basically?

790
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:19,650
Do you, are you friendly, in a way, right?

791
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,591
That's basically the thing.

792
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:24,093
And it has been widely reported

793
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:25,715
that women are more agreeable than men.

794
00:35:27,247 --> 00:35:29,768
Sounds good. Fits our cultural expectations, right?

795
00:35:30,608 --> 00:35:32,629
And of course, you know, that's what the data says. So, cool.

796
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:35,251
Here's what that actually means.

797
00:35:37,252 --> 00:35:37,732
The dotted...

798
00:35:41,294 --> 00:35:42,614
The dotted line here is women.

799
00:35:43,235 --> 00:35:44,375
The solid line is men.

800
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,776
The scores in the bottom are, you know, one to five.

801
00:35:48,497 --> 00:35:51,619
While it is technically true that, on average,

802
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:55,061
women are slightly more agreeable than men, right?

803
00:35:55,985 --> 00:35:58,386
This idea misses the point.

804
00:35:58,546 --> 00:36:00,847
There is a 10X greater variation

805
00:36:00,907 --> 00:36:03,228
between two individuals of the same gender

806
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:06,890
than there is between the genders, okay?

807
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:10,792
Two random people will be wildly differentiated,

808
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:12,813
much more so than the genders ever are.

809
00:36:12,913 --> 00:36:15,715
This mistake happens again and again and again.

810
00:36:16,335 --> 00:36:18,116
Very slight differences are taken

811
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,937
to reinforce cultural dialogues.

812
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:21,098
This gets us into trouble.

813
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:21,978
Okay, so.

814
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:24,940
If I haven't made it clear.

815
00:36:27,274 --> 00:36:28,716
This is not what we're talking about.

816
00:36:29,177 --> 00:36:30,198
Men have oxytocin.

817
00:36:30,499 --> 00:36:31,340
Women have adrenaline.

818
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,283
This is not how, this is not about gender.

819
00:36:33,363 --> 00:36:35,626
However, this does explain to me

820
00:36:35,686 --> 00:36:37,548
why I love this fucking game so much.

821
00:36:38,189 --> 00:36:38,790
Oh my God.

822
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:38,850
Oh.

823
00:36:40,974 --> 00:36:46,000
Wow! Okay. Because, I mean, it's got some violence in it, right?

824
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,148
But it is almost all about tending to your crops and to your pets and befriending everyone and

825
00:36:52,188 --> 00:36:56,894
filling up the little heart meters all the way to the way. Oh my god. And you get this hits, right?

826
00:36:57,075 --> 00:36:57,195
So.

827
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,949
Let's look at a different game, this game, and Diablo.

828
00:37:00,689 --> 00:37:03,590
I mean, when I land this whack on the baddie, right,

829
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:06,051
and this creature explodes into a billion gold coins, right,

830
00:37:06,071 --> 00:37:08,032
I get this weird internal release of pleasure.

831
00:37:08,532 --> 00:37:09,332
It's great stuff, right?

832
00:37:09,532 --> 00:37:12,434
Oh yeah, the threat, the imaginary threat has been relieved.

833
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:14,394
I fought my way clear of it, right?

834
00:37:15,175 --> 00:37:18,277
By the same token, when I finally trigger the

835
00:37:18,578 --> 00:37:20,880
OK, we are friends now cinematic in Stardew Valley,

836
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,102
and I learned that my favorite shopkeeper here, Pierre,

837
00:37:23,462 --> 00:37:25,524
is actually a closet pothead, and that he's

838
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:26,845
really adorable about it.

839
00:37:26,905 --> 00:37:29,607
I hope that's not spoilers, because, oh, he's so cute.

840
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,088
He's like, oh, dude, don't tell anyone.

841
00:37:32,364 --> 00:37:33,945
We are now imaginary friends.

842
00:37:34,025 --> 00:37:36,227
I get this weird release of oxytocin.

843
00:37:36,247 --> 00:37:37,688
I get this thing that happens in my head

844
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:38,929
where I'm all excited, right?

845
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:43,433
My oxytocin system rewards me for creating a situation

846
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:46,755
where I can rely on him if an imaginary tiger shows up.

847
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,638
We're buds, right?

848
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:50,959
It's cool.

849
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:55,909
OK, why does this all matter to you guys as game developers?

850
00:37:56,469 --> 00:37:57,170
How do we use this?

851
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,731
It's really hard for me to know.

852
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:02,113
But I can tell you that when I shared this concept

853
00:38:02,153 --> 00:38:03,634
with my wife, this is Lisa.

854
00:38:03,675 --> 00:38:04,175
Hi, Lisa.

855
00:38:05,696 --> 00:38:08,318
She stared at me for a very long time, right?

856
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:12,101
And when a tear finally slid down her face,

857
00:38:12,181 --> 00:38:15,403
she said to me, this theory explains my whole life.

858
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:22,593
She went on to explain that she had always felt like a chemical, motivational outsider.

859
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,255
Because we all know about fight or flight, right?

860
00:38:26,957 --> 00:38:30,780
When something bad happens to you, you're supposed to want to run or attack.

861
00:38:31,661 --> 00:38:33,463
But that had never happened to her.

862
00:38:35,805 --> 00:38:40,989
In times of fearful stress, my wife's response generally has been to think immediately about her loved ones.

863
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:41,770
Instantly.

864
00:38:42,391 --> 00:38:45,433
And for much of her life, she thought that there was something wrong with her.

865
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:50,282
Because this is what we call codependence.

866
00:38:51,742 --> 00:38:53,463
But what if this is normal?

867
00:38:54,523 --> 00:38:56,244
What if this is how we're wired?

868
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,505
What if this isn't a disorder?

869
00:38:59,245 --> 00:39:00,565
What if it is perfectly normal

870
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:02,846
for a large portion of the population, men and women,

871
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:04,527
to respond to stress and fear

872
00:39:04,547 --> 00:39:07,228
with an urge towards caregiving

873
00:39:07,568 --> 00:39:12,069
and relationship building directly, chemically,

874
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:14,630
without any training or socialization,

875
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:17,111
no role models required, built in?

876
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:23,493
I don't feel the urge to go into great detail about the game design implications.

877
00:39:23,513 --> 00:39:25,235
I'm also not going to have enough time for that.

878
00:39:26,276 --> 00:39:27,637
You are designers and developers.

879
00:39:27,677 --> 00:39:29,819
Your place in this world is to learn the truth.

880
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:34,323
I believe that your place in this world is to learn the truth and turn that truth into

881
00:39:34,383 --> 00:39:37,306
experience for your players so that they can understand the world around them.

882
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:39,538
but I would like to tell you a story.

883
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:41,000
This is Bree's story.

884
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,963
She's the one who introduced me to these ideas.

885
00:39:45,284 --> 00:39:47,166
And since I will never be able to do a better job

886
00:39:47,186 --> 00:39:48,367
of telling this story than she does,

887
00:39:48,507 --> 00:39:51,190
I will, with her permission, thank you Bree, you're amazing,

888
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,972
tell her story in her own words, largely her own words.

889
00:39:54,823 --> 00:39:57,705
Okay, so Brie's closest friend is her cousin Christina,

890
00:39:58,126 --> 00:39:59,987
and she has been perhaps very,

891
00:40:00,007 --> 00:40:01,429
she's been very hostile to video games,

892
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:02,970
to Brie's love of video games for a long time.

893
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:07,734
She's an art historian, and when Brie would message her

894
00:40:07,754 --> 00:40:09,836
about stress and work, she wouldn't offer support.

895
00:40:09,856 --> 00:40:10,396
She would just be like,

896
00:40:10,436 --> 00:40:11,938
you should get out of that stupid industry, right?

897
00:40:12,638 --> 00:40:14,580
She thought Brie was wasting her life on video games.

898
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:18,723
And then one day, she started to ask about games.

899
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:21,226
Christina asked Brie about games, and she was thrilled.

900
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:23,606
So she recommended Journey.

901
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:25,368
It seemed like a natural fit,

902
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:27,229
but to Brie's surprise, Christina didn't finish it.

903
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,512
She didn't like that there's this snake that can kill you.

904
00:40:31,113 --> 00:40:32,394
It's not that it was too hard.

905
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:35,297
It was just that Christina was deeply uninterested

906
00:40:35,357 --> 00:40:38,419
in being attacked at all in a game.

907
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:40,942
But it did intrigue her enough

908
00:40:40,962 --> 00:40:42,323
that she asked for more recommendations,

909
00:40:42,403 --> 00:40:46,126
and so Brie offered her favorite game, Skyrim.

910
00:40:48,243 --> 00:40:50,844
Christina googled it and texted her back like,

911
00:40:51,244 --> 00:40:53,986
something like, I don't know why you would think

912
00:40:54,086 --> 00:40:57,708
I would like this, I don't watch Game of Thrones,

913
00:40:57,768 --> 00:40:59,689
I don't like swords, I don't like fighting,

914
00:40:59,729 --> 00:41:00,590
I don't like dragons.

915
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,191
Bree told her that she would hate the first bit

916
00:41:03,231 --> 00:41:04,852
with a dragon, but then to just get through it

917
00:41:05,052 --> 00:41:06,393
and then give it a chance and get back to her

918
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:06,953
with their thoughts.

919
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:09,675
But Christina didn't get back to her, not for three weeks.

920
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:13,099
Three weeks later, her cell phone rang.

921
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:14,680
Now, no one ever calls Bree,

922
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,740
because she knows she doesn't answer,

923
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,001
but when she saw Christina's name on the screen,

924
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:20,103
her stomach dropped, and she knew

925
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:22,484
that there had to be some kind of family emergency.

926
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,085
She picked up the phone, and Christina was crying.

927
00:41:26,046 --> 00:41:28,107
She said, Lydia died.

928
00:41:34,771 --> 00:41:36,131
There's no Lydia in Bree's family.

929
00:41:37,984 --> 00:41:39,905
Christina was talking about the character in Skyrim.

930
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,248
For three weeks, Christina had been playing Skyrim obsessively,

931
00:41:43,308 --> 00:41:45,309
and now she'd accidentally killed Lydia,

932
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:46,730
and she didn't have a recent save game.

933
00:41:48,191 --> 00:41:50,152
She said through her tears that she didn't realize

934
00:41:50,172 --> 00:41:52,193
that you could develop an emotional attachment

935
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:53,975
to a character in a video game at all.

936
00:41:55,215 --> 00:41:56,877
She didn't realize you could create your character

937
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:58,438
and exist as a version of yourself

938
00:41:58,498 --> 00:42:00,779
in a world full of characters whom you care about.

939
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:03,341
Now, of course, Bri had never realized

940
00:42:03,361 --> 00:42:04,502
that Christina didn't know this,

941
00:42:04,542 --> 00:42:05,923
because she knew this so deeply,

942
00:42:06,303 --> 00:42:07,103
having grown up with them.

943
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,669
Christina said to Bree that for all these years,

944
00:42:09,709 --> 00:42:11,450
it wasn't that she didn't like video games,

945
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,290
it's that she didn't know what they were.

946
00:42:15,871 --> 00:42:17,971
When Bree tells this story at conferences,

947
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:20,272
people tell her they're Lydia stories.

948
00:42:21,832 --> 00:42:22,992
We all have a Lydia story.

949
00:42:24,673 --> 00:42:24,833
I do.

950
00:42:24,853 --> 00:42:28,494
And the truth is, Christina stopped playing Skyrim

951
00:42:28,874 --> 00:42:30,814
after Lydia died because she really doesn't like

952
00:42:30,854 --> 00:42:31,894
swords or fighting or dragons,

953
00:42:31,914 --> 00:42:32,935
and there hasn't been a game.

954
00:42:33,847 --> 00:42:34,987
that has satisfied her since.

955
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:36,468
And in Tim Gunn's words,

956
00:42:37,068 --> 00:42:39,530
this is a design failure, not a customer issue.

957
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:43,132
Okay, that's Brie's story.

958
00:42:43,432 --> 00:42:43,872
Thanks, Brie.

959
00:42:44,752 --> 00:42:46,894
So as designers, I believe that our place in the world

960
00:42:46,954 --> 00:42:47,694
is to learn the truth

961
00:42:48,094 --> 00:42:49,735
and to turn that truth into player experience.

962
00:42:49,975 --> 00:42:52,617
The truth is that a huge component of our player base,

963
00:42:52,997 --> 00:42:56,499
male and female, gain more chemical satisfaction

964
00:42:56,539 --> 00:42:58,860
from the experience of real relationship building

965
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,421
than they do from shooting a bad guy.

966
00:43:02,686 --> 00:43:03,107
chemically.

967
00:43:03,427 --> 00:43:05,509
The truth is that a huge component of our player base,

968
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,753
male and female, don't want to fight back or fight at all.

969
00:43:09,474 --> 00:43:10,675
They want to care for something.

970
00:43:11,116 --> 00:43:12,718
They want to see the effects of their care

971
00:43:12,738 --> 00:43:14,700
and improve the lives of their imaginary friends.

972
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:18,842
And there are many genres that are already exploring these ideas, right?

973
00:43:19,082 --> 00:43:22,624
But I felt it necessary to offer you these tools.

974
00:43:23,104 --> 00:43:25,785
The truth is that the players come to our games

975
00:43:26,286 --> 00:43:27,986
because of what they see in the store window.

976
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,988
They like their feeling, they have their taste,

977
00:43:31,148 --> 00:43:32,548
and they like what they see in the window,

978
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:33,869
they step in there, right?

979
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:37,471
The dragons, the swords, the blocks, and the jumping, and the realism,

980
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:38,311
that's what they come in for.

981
00:43:38,351 --> 00:43:40,152
But what they really want long-term

982
00:43:40,372 --> 00:43:42,993
is the satisfaction of mastery, autonomy, and relatedness.

983
00:43:44,145 --> 00:43:46,045
But they don't want these things because they're bored.

984
00:43:46,826 --> 00:43:48,727
Self-determination theory came into being

985
00:43:48,747 --> 00:43:50,967
when a group of researchers started asking people

986
00:43:51,027 --> 00:43:52,628
working in all kinds of jobs

987
00:43:53,328 --> 00:43:55,869
whether or not the time they were spending

988
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:58,891
at work was worthwhile.

989
00:43:59,571 --> 00:44:01,172
Whether or not at the end of their life

990
00:44:01,732 --> 00:44:03,673
they felt they would look back on that time

991
00:44:03,713 --> 00:44:05,733
as fondly or as lost.

992
00:44:09,703 --> 00:44:11,424
So, boredom is one of the many things

993
00:44:11,444 --> 00:44:12,644
that can prevent people from reaching

994
00:44:12,685 --> 00:44:13,705
their satisfaction goals,

995
00:44:14,005 --> 00:44:17,347
and drives are how we overcome that boredom.

996
00:44:17,387 --> 00:44:18,868
A huge part of our job as designers

997
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:21,229
is to present our audience with the second-to-second

998
00:44:21,509 --> 00:44:22,990
drive stimulations that they need

999
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,872
to get from initial taste to satisfaction.

1000
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:31,115
And if game designers misunderstand

1001
00:44:31,495 --> 00:44:34,216
or overlook key portions of our population,

1002
00:44:36,209 --> 00:44:42,898
If they overlook chemical motivations that are a huge part of life for a huge amount of people in this world,

1003
00:44:43,438 --> 00:44:48,465
we leave out vast swaths of people that could be entertaining themselves with our software,

1004
00:44:49,046 --> 00:44:50,708
and our board games, and our experiences.

1005
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:55,151
And this is not just me standing up there being hopeful and idealistic.

1006
00:44:55,591 --> 00:44:58,453
This is the most recent science that I can find,

1007
00:44:58,473 --> 00:44:59,693
and I'm trying to bring it to your attention.

1008
00:45:00,514 --> 00:45:02,235
The science tells us that people are driven

1009
00:45:02,275 --> 00:45:05,477
to make all different types of interactions in the games that they want to play.

1010
00:45:05,517 --> 00:45:08,959
Your players want their drives to be stimulated.

1011
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:11,540
They want to be curious. They want to care for things.

1012
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,082
They want to feel confronted, right?

1013
00:45:14,322 --> 00:45:18,325
The question I want you to ask yourself as you move forward into the future is this one.

1014
00:45:19,602 --> 00:45:22,723
How can we expand the potential of our art form

1015
00:45:23,063 --> 00:45:23,844
with these ideas?

1016
00:45:24,664 --> 00:45:27,925
What game design structures might we have overlooked

1017
00:45:28,185 --> 00:45:30,526
because we were not aware of the full spectrum

1018
00:45:30,546 --> 00:45:32,786
of chemical possibilities inside the human mind?

1019
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:38,188
How can we as a group increase the expressive potential

1020
00:45:38,648 --> 00:45:41,309
of games as a whole through new ideas

1021
00:45:41,389 --> 00:45:44,290
that leverage these types of experiences in a better way?

1022
00:45:45,794 --> 00:45:48,555
And, what else is missing from this behavior model?

1023
00:45:48,995 --> 00:45:51,696
What have I got wrong here? Right.

1024
00:45:51,796 --> 00:45:53,236
Where are we still getting it wrong?

1025
00:45:54,557 --> 00:45:57,017
If you know, and if you think you know the answer to these questions,

1026
00:45:57,157 --> 00:45:59,878
please contact me. I need to know where I've fucked it up.

1027
00:46:00,598 --> 00:46:02,479
And thank you very much for coming to the talk.
