1
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:16,388
Visitations is a collection of meditative virtual reality vignettes.

2
00:00:17,088 --> 00:00:21,950
They're designed to improve the setting, as in set and setting, for patients undergoing

3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,811
ketamine infusion therapy and was assembled for use in a study conducted by researchers

4
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:29,432
at Manhattan Restorative Health Sciences in New York.

5
00:00:30,737 --> 00:00:33,139
It is an artwork which employs design strategies

6
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:35,180
tailored to support therapeutic outcomes.

7
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,261
These strategies include the use of artistic techniques

8
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:40,482
which have measurable physiological effects

9
00:00:41,162 --> 00:00:43,163
and user experience design decisions

10
00:00:43,203 --> 00:00:45,064
which take into account the specific needs

11
00:00:45,124 --> 00:00:46,705
of incapacitated patients.

12
00:00:47,652 --> 00:00:50,733
So set and setting is a concept that Timothy Leary

13
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:52,573
came up with, he coined the term.

14
00:00:53,194 --> 00:00:56,055
And it basically refers to the idea that your expectations

15
00:00:56,495 --> 00:00:59,916
and your own state of mind and the place that you're in

16
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:04,838
have a huge impact on the quality of the experience

17
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:07,219
that you have when you're doing psychedelics.

18
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:11,603
So I am David Loebser.

19
00:01:12,383 --> 00:01:15,164
My background is in animation and visual effects.

20
00:01:15,364 --> 00:01:17,245
I would also say applied design.

21
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,486
I had a mid-career shift.

22
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:22,546
I went to ITP at NYU in New York

23
00:01:22,646 --> 00:01:24,947
and I learned how to be a developer.

24
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:26,908
I fell in love with procedural design

25
00:01:27,228 --> 00:01:29,589
and around the same time I was also introduced

26
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,670
to medicine ceremonies and doing work in that space.

27
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:40,300
I developed an app called Cosmic Sugar, which is sort of part of, kind of under the same

28
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,226
umbrella, and also, even though it wasn't designed as a therapeutic experience initially,

29
00:01:46,246 --> 00:01:48,368
it also has some therapeutic qualities, I think.

30
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,814
I also worked on a project called Luxury Escapism with Tyler Pridgen, who's here in the audience

31
00:01:54,854 --> 00:01:58,998
today, and we set up a digital spa in New York.

32
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:02,033
just before the pandemic, a year before the pandemic.

33
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:04,956
And it was tailored to digital experiences

34
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:08,098
designed to help you get into a more

35
00:02:08,558 --> 00:02:09,699
meditative state of mind.

36
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,001
And then Visitations, the app was released.

37
00:02:14,082 --> 00:02:15,663
Actually, I need to adjust that.

38
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:16,824
So it was released in 2020, actually.

39
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,609
So, this is an extra slide about luxury escapism.

40
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:28,491
We basically wanted to build an art experience that mirrored the experience of going to a

41
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:28,771
spa.

42
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:35,893
So, instead of steam rooms and cold dips and hot rooms and all of that stuff, you went

43
00:02:35,953 --> 00:02:38,274
into these different experiences that were inspired by

44
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,172
oddly satisfying content and ASMR.

45
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:44,053
In the lower left, that's an experience

46
00:02:44,073 --> 00:02:45,174
called Rainbow Therapy.

47
00:02:45,294 --> 00:02:48,136
It's a vibrating waterbed with a very intense strobe light

48
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:50,637
and binaural beats on the headphones that you're using

49
00:02:50,657 --> 00:02:52,118
and everything is adjustable.

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,621
This is a trailer for the experience.

51
00:02:57,641 --> 00:02:59,802
This is a trailer for the experience.

52
00:02:59,822 --> 00:03:03,564
It's a vibrating waterbed with a very intense strobe light

53
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:04,665
and binaural beats on the headphones that you're using

54
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,245
and everything is adjustable.

55
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:21,246
To learn more about how we can impact you, visit bradleysystem.com

56
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:21,986
Consider volunteering.

57
00:04:04,154 --> 00:04:10,457
The project was initially conceived of at the advent of this round of commercialized

58
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:10,817
VR.

59
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:12,058
I had a lot of

60
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,695
experiments that I was making for myself as a way of self-exploring, self-hypnosis and

61
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:23,858
exploring procedural graphics and I was seeking a way to package them together and share them

62
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:29,503
with people because on their own each experience was not going to work as a standalone experience.

63
00:04:29,543 --> 00:04:33,425
So I kind of wanted to make a festival or a gallery of these experiences for people.

64
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:39,999
influenced by the goals that filmmakers in the 70s had,

65
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,261
which had to do with exploring consciousness

66
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:45,003
and creating films that kind of mirrored

67
00:04:45,163 --> 00:04:47,864
what consciousness is like on a moment-to-moment basis

68
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:50,506
as opposed to making narrative films.

69
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:54,208
So Stan Brakhage, James Benning, Michael Snow,

70
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:55,449
I love all of them.

71
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:57,070
I had heard of Jordan Belson before,

72
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,452
but it was only when I came to San Francisco recently

73
00:04:59,492 --> 00:05:01,373
that somebody reminded me of him.

74
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:02,774
So I looked up his work a little bit

75
00:05:02,814 --> 00:05:03,814
and it's very much in line.

76
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:06,616
with this kind of work.

77
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:10,359
So he's San Francisco based and basically invented

78
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,561
planetarium laser light shows

79
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:15,784
in the 50s and 60s in San Francisco.

80
00:05:17,805 --> 00:05:21,788
So I was introduced to Melissa Selinger

81
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:23,229
who introduced me to Tim Canty

82
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,072
who runs Manhattan Restorative Health Sciences.

83
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:28,794
And we collaborated on putting the study together.

84
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:32,016
So, ketamine, if you're not familiar with it,

85
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:35,137
is a, it's similar to psychedelics,

86
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:36,298
but it's in its own class.

87
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,200
It would not be considered a classic psychedelic

88
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,440
like LSD or mushrooms.

89
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:44,882
It is a dissociative anesthetic.

90
00:05:45,142 --> 00:05:46,782
It creates a trance-like state,

91
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:48,843
providing pain relief, sedation, and amnesia.

92
00:05:50,624 --> 00:05:51,704
Experience can differ.

93
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:54,266
Some people are averse to it.

94
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:56,366
It can be strange and unusual.

95
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:04,058
but people report having visionary experiences of new perspectives and emotions including hope, optimism and a sense of meaning.

96
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:10,066
It's been around for a long time, but interest has grown recently because of its antidepressant effects

97
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:14,932
and because of a growing psychedelic renaissance led by the works that MAPS is doing with MDMA.

98
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:18,414
So the nice thing about ketamine is that it's been around

99
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:20,615
for a long time, it's been demonstrated to be safe,

100
00:06:20,695 --> 00:06:22,836
it's legal, any doctor can prescribe it.

101
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:26,158
It's schedule three, so it can be prescribed off-label.

102
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:29,579
So actually most people who get ketamine infusions

103
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:32,961
are not being prescribed it in the proper way.

104
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:38,284
The only form of ketamine that is approved for depression right now, as far as I know,

105
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:42,506
is Johnson & Johnson's S-ketamine, which is a nasal spray.

106
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:48,790
And along with the substance, you also need to have a way of doing it.

107
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,631
So there's a protocol that's built into the approval of the drug,

108
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:56,434
which involves needing to sit with a therapist for two hours.

109
00:06:56,674 --> 00:07:00,316
So it's a one-hour experience and a sort of one-hour after experience.

110
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,765
Very often, so everybody who's prescribing infusions,

111
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:08,110
like everybody's kind of making up their own protocols,

112
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:11,676
but typically it would look like five or six infusions

113
00:07:11,756 --> 00:07:12,598
over two to three weeks.

114
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:18,819
Ketamine and VR have been combined before.

115
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:25,201
In 2011, I believe it was, Hunter Hoffman did a study

116
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:27,722
with a VR app called SnowWorld.

117
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:32,244
There were, it was basically for burn patients

118
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:33,784
who were having their skin debrided,

119
00:07:33,824 --> 00:07:35,805
which is an incredibly painful experience.

120
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:40,526
And what he did was put people in VR

121
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:42,627
and showed them an experience of,

122
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,621
snow people throwing snowballs at them.

123
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:48,261
So when the snowballs would hit them,

124
00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:51,342
that's when their skin would be scrubbed

125
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:52,963
to get rid of the dead tissue.

126
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:55,923
And part of the process was

127
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,424
recontextualizing that experience of pain.

128
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:01,045
You're getting hit by a snowball,

129
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:02,425
instead of having your skin removed,

130
00:08:02,745 --> 00:08:04,045
it becomes much more enjoyable.

131
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:06,206
So people actually rated this experience

132
00:08:06,426 --> 00:08:10,647
as being significantly more enjoyable than not being in VR.

133
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:19,460
So for this study we did with Manhattan Restorative Health Sciences, there were three infusions

134
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,101
in one week.

135
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:25,284
The first infusion was done without VR, just on its own, which is the standard way of doing

136
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:25,384
it.

137
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:30,127
The second one was done with VR, and the third time around patients could choose whether

138
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,668
they wanted to be in VR or not.

139
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:35,511
and more than two thirds actually preferred

140
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:37,632
the experience with VR.

141
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:40,754
So it was well tolerated and people enjoyed it.

142
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,335
The alternative to being in VR was to either

143
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:46,357
have an eye mask, people could bring their own music,

144
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:48,398
but otherwise if they were not in VR

145
00:08:48,438 --> 00:08:50,159
they were in a fairly clinical space.

146
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,601
It's a nice clinic, but it is a clinic.

147
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:58,164
And the results are hopefully going to be published soon.

148
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:01,996
So this is some of the feedback that we got.

149
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:04,037
Not every subject had a preference for VR,

150
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,478
but those that did were effusive.

151
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,922
The feedback suggests that VR experience

152
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,603
didn't just provide a nicer place to be,

153
00:09:11,663 --> 00:09:13,305
but assisted in the therapeutic work.

154
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:16,447
So this is just a little of the feedback we got,

155
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:20,951
which my intuition was that we were gonna get

156
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:23,193
good feedback, but we got some very, very good feedback.

157
00:09:29,721 --> 00:09:35,232
So the goal of therapeutic art is not to make an artistic statement, it's to create a space

158
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:37,035
for other people to have experiences.

159
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,694
should be designed in a way to elicit the body's

160
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:44,296
natural healing responses.

161
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:48,819
You know, the placebo effect is an incredibly powerful thing.

162
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,382
When they're designing antidepressants,

163
00:09:52,422 --> 00:09:54,404
they have to demonstrate that antidepressants

164
00:09:54,624 --> 00:09:56,706
are more effective than placebo,

165
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:58,447
but it turns out that placebos are actually

166
00:09:58,507 --> 00:09:59,908
very effective antidepressants,

167
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:01,890
and effective for all kinds of other things, too.

168
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,013
So there is a quality of VR that can help lend

169
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:07,295
to the placebo effect in addition to other things.

170
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:12,453
So the patients that were involved in the study

171
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:15,977
were a population that suffered from pain and depression.

172
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:19,636
It's an orthopedic surgery clinic,

173
00:10:19,676 --> 00:10:21,817
so people were often there initially

174
00:10:21,897 --> 00:10:23,417
to have some kind of surgery done,

175
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:25,978
and these follow-up appointments were to deal with

176
00:10:26,018 --> 00:10:27,618
not just the pain, but also the depression

177
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:28,519
that came along with it.

178
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:31,259
They generally didn't have any experience with VR,

179
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:32,900
or very little experience with VR,

180
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,680
and we didn't wanna give them complicated tasks to do.

181
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,221
We didn't wanna give them controllers,

182
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:39,361
we didn't wanna make a game,

183
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:41,702
we didn't wanna do anything that was remotely complicated.

184
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:44,742
So it's a very passive experience.

185
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:47,043
All the scenes are really meant to be settings.

186
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:51,285
The patients are set up in recliners,

187
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,406
so they can recline as much as they want.

188
00:10:53,526 --> 00:11:00,609
A lot of VR experiences can reorient in the Y-axis,

189
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,671
but most VR experiences don't let you recline necessarily,

190
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:08,293
so that was an important part of the design for visitations,

191
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:09,534
is no matter which way you look,

192
00:11:09,574 --> 00:11:11,114
it will reorient in that direction.

193
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:14,096
So you can be inverted, you can be lying down, reclining.

194
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:19,735
They're all designed to reorient so you're looking at the thing that we want you to be

195
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:20,195
looking at.

196
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:27,240
So I already mentioned there's hardly any interaction.

197
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,543
People are given a controller so they can pick scenes, but there's no menu.

198
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:35,786
They click on the controller button and they can switch to the next scene until they find

199
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:36,466
one that they like.

200
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,308
There are 12 scenes total.

201
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:43,003
For the app that was released, there is a gaze-based menu,

202
00:11:43,023 --> 00:11:45,124
so you can design your own set of experiences

203
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:48,106
and choose from them, and it's made for people

204
00:11:48,146 --> 00:11:49,687
who aren't in that state.

205
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:57,351
So these are, this is a non-exhaustive list

206
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:59,993
of modalities we were thinking about

207
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:01,554
when we were designing these experiences.

208
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,545
The authors of the paper Designing Awe in Virtual Reality, an Experimental Study, describe

209
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:13,230
awe as a complex emotion encompassing the two main appraisal themes of vastness, the

210
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:18,995
perception of being in front of either perceptually or conceptually grand and vast stimuli, and

211
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:24,620
need for accommodation, the urge to adjust mental frames according to new incoming information.

212
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:29,724
So there's something called the overview effect, which you might have heard of, that astronauts experience when they

213
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:34,106
blast off into space and see Earth, like all of Earth for the first time.

214
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:38,189
You know, they have this experience of just like awe and wonder because

215
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:44,513
they have to, it's just like a completely new way of looking at the world and that creates this sense of awe.

216
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:48,335
I think that part of the joy of looking at fractals

217
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:51,257
comes from a similar place.

218
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:58,659
I would say that the feeling of awe arises because the mind's eye is drawn into nested

219
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,361
infinities effortlessly and playfully accommodating the unique role of each particular recursive

220
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:04,681
form.

221
00:13:06,142 --> 00:13:10,183
The breath is the most commonly used object of meditation, but it can be hard to focus

222
00:13:10,383 --> 00:13:12,903
on in unpleasant or confusing situations.

223
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:17,465
Scenes and visitations are designed to act as immersive and all-encompassing objects

224
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:21,326
of meditation that grab attention for people with less meditation experience.

225
00:13:22,644 --> 00:13:26,748
Catharsis is a purging of negative emotions resulting in beneficial outcomes.

226
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:30,572
Not all of the moods explored in visitations are exactly uplifting.

227
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:35,657
Some are actually fairly heavy, which I believe allows people to immerse in more difficult

228
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:39,201
emotions with the benefit of the distance of an aesthetic experience.

229
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:50,921
I'm also very inspired by a musician named Phil Niblock who creates meditative tone compositions

230
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:57,244
that are almost the same, like one tone for 30 minutes, but they're incredibly textural

231
00:13:57,544 --> 00:14:00,165
and they explore a lot of different ranges of emotions.

232
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:02,086
They're not all the kinds of uplifting.

233
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:07,528
Music that you might hear sort of with new age sound baths

234
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:08,248
or that kind of thing.

235
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:10,668
I think there's a range of emotions that can be explored

236
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,889
and focusing on less positive emotions

237
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,329
also has an important place.

238
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,090
So with distraction therapy,

239
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,971
VR draws a patient's focus away from wherever they are

240
00:14:24,351 --> 00:14:26,911
and leaves less concentration available

241
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:29,672
to process incoming pain signals.

242
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:31,692
So the idea is you have a certain amount of attention

243
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,640
And if you draw the attention away from the thing that's unpleasant, then you'll have

244
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,640
less of that experience.

245
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,401
So this is actually a really powerful thing about VR.

246
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:46,223
And VR on its own actually has analgesic effects.

247
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:50,684
If you're in a painful situation, it's been shown again and again in a variety of studies

248
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:54,926
that VR actually helps reduce the experience of pain.

249
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,797
So entrainment refers to the frequency following effect

250
00:14:58,837 --> 00:15:01,438
that comes from exposure to auditory or visual beats,

251
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:02,779
and I'll talk a little bit more about that.

252
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:06,481
So the framing and context kind of gets to this idea

253
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:08,322
of what they were doing with Snow World,

254
00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:10,843
where you're having an unpleasant experience

255
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,504
or a challenging experience,

256
00:15:13,724 --> 00:15:15,605
and the idea is to create a space

257
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:19,107
where you can look at it in a different way,

258
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:20,328
recontextualize it.

259
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:22,429
It helps immensely psychologically.

260
00:15:23,402 --> 00:15:27,265
So something I've been really curious about, and somebody just forwarded me some information

261
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:29,607
about a fairly new study that came out of Helsinki.

262
00:15:30,368 --> 00:15:33,731
It's titled Restoration in a Virtual Reality Forest Environment.

263
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:39,396
And they found that a virtual forest was perceived as more or equally restorative

264
00:15:40,177 --> 00:15:44,739
as an experience in a real forest which I think is really fascinating because it's been

265
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:49,882
shown that being out in nature makes you feel better and it's kind of obvious in a way but

266
00:15:49,922 --> 00:15:54,065
the question is what aspects of that are the thing that makes you feel better.

267
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:57,847
And it turns out just looking at a forest and being in a virtual forest.

268
00:15:58,487 --> 00:15:59,748
pretty much works just as well.

269
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:02,630
So it's not necessarily the exercise or the air

270
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,191
or something magical.

271
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:07,153
It might have something to do with associations

272
00:16:07,553 --> 00:16:12,056
or possibly the experience of seeing fractal-like shapes

273
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:13,216
like trees or fractals.

274
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:15,638
So I think that's a really interesting question.

275
00:16:15,898 --> 00:16:19,140
Like what is it about that experience

276
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,421
that is therapeutic on its own?

277
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,321
So these are some of the techniques

278
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,961
that I use in visitations.

279
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:32,062
Visual strobing is a big topic,

280
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:35,663
easily worth its own long presentation on its own.

281
00:16:35,683 --> 00:16:40,344
Our brains sort of work at different frequencies

282
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:41,784
based on our mental state.

283
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:46,225
For instance, 10 hertz is alpha waves, 10 hertz-ish,

284
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:49,366
and alpha waves are purported to bring about

285
00:16:49,386 --> 00:16:50,626
a sense of relaxed attention.

286
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:54,467
Whereas 3 hertz delta waves are more associated with deep sleep.

287
00:16:55,408 --> 00:17:00,910
The artists Brian Gison and William Burroughs created a machine called a dream machine.

288
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,370
I think that was in the 50s.

289
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:08,153
They took a cylinder with slits cut in it and put it on a turntable and as it was spinning

290
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:13,675
around the lights would flicker in their eyes creating yantra-like visual patterns.

291
00:17:14,856 --> 00:17:18,777
There's an app that you can get for your phone right now called Luminate.

292
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:26,181
And it actually uses the LED on the back of your phone to strobe lights in your eyes.

293
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:30,303
And they mix that with voiceover meditations.

294
00:17:31,123 --> 00:17:36,066
And the idea is that by strobing lights or auditory beats...

295
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:40,829
you can entrain your brainwaves in a way to elicit these desirable states of mind.

296
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:45,212
So if you think about drumming, putting you in a state, like a trance-like state,

297
00:17:46,392 --> 00:17:49,835
that's a positive outcome, potentially, of these techniques.

298
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:53,017
A negative outcome, of course, is epileptic seizures.

299
00:17:54,598 --> 00:17:59,361
So, Cyberpunk 2077, for instance, had this issue where it's like some streamers were

300
00:18:00,502 --> 00:18:02,284
having seizures on camera.

301
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:07,748
This sort of came into popular consciousness in the 90s when an episode of Pokemon had

302
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:11,691
very intense strobing and children were falling over and frothing at the mouth.

303
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:14,553
And so there are actually a lot of regulations about...

304
00:18:15,654 --> 00:18:17,797
what kind of strobing you can have in media,

305
00:18:18,257 --> 00:18:20,621
how to avoid giving people seizures, that kind of thing.

306
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:23,905
So with the visitations that is released on the store,

307
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:26,028
there is strobing, but it's pretty subtle.

308
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:29,253
I didn't wanna push that envelope too much,

309
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:30,634
but there are a couple scenes

310
00:18:30,655 --> 00:18:32,417
that have more intense strobing, but it is.

311
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,261
a powerful technique and it's also sort of questionable

312
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:39,762
if it needs to be very intense.

313
00:18:39,942 --> 00:18:41,422
So even less intense strobing

314
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:44,103
could have an interesting effect.

315
00:18:44,743 --> 00:18:46,663
So part of what you will,

316
00:18:46,683 --> 00:18:49,304
let's see, did that go to the next one?

317
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:58,206
So part of what you,

318
00:18:58,226 --> 00:19:00,467
oh, it didn't switch.

319
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:09,368
Okay, part of, so something that you'll see

320
00:19:09,588 --> 00:19:11,250
when you're looking at strobing lights

321
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,192
are these patterns on the upper left

322
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,755
that were described by a psychologist named Heinrich Kluver.

323
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:20,316
He called them form constants.

324
00:19:21,217 --> 00:19:24,099
He was experimenting with mescaline

325
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,122
sort of in a much earlier renaissance of psychedelics

326
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:29,183
in the 20s or the 30s, I believe.

327
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:35,649
So he was taking mescaline and basically describing these visual patterns that he saw.

328
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:43,155
And his suggestion was that these cobweb shapes and these spirals were constituent parts of

329
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,658
the structure of our brains basically, not just of our eyes.

330
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,323
And he surmised that because based on where he was looking, the structures were actually

331
00:19:52,423 --> 00:19:55,025
part of the space and not just overlaid.

332
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:56,807
on his vision.

333
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:00,571
So I would suggest that sort of making use of these shapes

334
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:03,914
kind of taps into some preexisting structures in our brains

335
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:09,039
and sort of part of doing that with spirals, with fractals,

336
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,643
when you kind of tap into things that are already there,

337
00:20:12,663 --> 00:20:13,964
it can be.

338
00:20:14,785 --> 00:20:16,987
It can be easy to fall into the trap of making things

339
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,548
that are a little kitschy or schmaltzy.

340
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:21,530
It's like sort of almost too easy on the eyes sometimes.

341
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:22,711
So I did try to avoid that.

342
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:26,515
I may or may not have succeeded in some places

343
00:20:26,635 --> 00:20:27,676
in avoiding the kitsch trap.

344
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:30,838
But it is a powerful technique, I believe.

345
00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:33,655
Symmetry is another one.

346
00:20:33,735 --> 00:20:36,096
So this is radial symmetry, so, you know,

347
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:37,917
kind of feels like a tunnel, but.

348
00:20:38,657 --> 00:20:41,438
Our bodies are symmetrical, natural things are symmetrical,

349
00:20:41,518 --> 00:20:42,859
healthy things are symmetrical.

350
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:45,560
We're drawn to them, they're easy.

351
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,961
Carl Jung famously used mandalas

352
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:49,682
in order to gain psychological insight

353
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:50,742
and self-understanding.

354
00:20:51,903 --> 00:20:53,684
In the same way that spirals just feel right,

355
00:20:53,704 --> 00:20:55,004
symmetrical forms do as well.

356
00:20:56,065 --> 00:20:57,025
Oops, sorry.

357
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:02,895
Visual artists usually avoid symmetry because it's too easy,

358
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:05,679
but if you're looking to create a comfortable environment,

359
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:06,780
it's pretty perfect.

360
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:17,094
A lot of 360 experiences are designed in such a way that you're invited to look all around

361
00:21:17,134 --> 00:21:19,095
in every direction, in front, behind.

362
00:21:20,836 --> 00:21:24,657
For myself, I find that to be a little bit stressful, not knowing where to look at, because

363
00:21:24,677 --> 00:21:26,058
I always feel like I'm missing something.

364
00:21:26,678 --> 00:21:32,481
So and that's true of even more narrative experiences that I create, but in particular

365
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:35,682
with this study and with patients who are incapacitated in this way.

366
00:21:36,782 --> 00:21:43,789
it would be very difficult for them to sit up and turn around behind them to see something that they're missing.

367
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:50,355
So I wanted to not just create a sense that they're seeing everything that there is to see

368
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:52,677
and not invite them to look around in any way.

369
00:21:52,697 --> 00:21:57,882
And I also just wanted to invite them to be very still and to keep their head still

370
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,064
and to keep their eyes still and to accomplish that.

371
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:03,006
all the compositions are very centrally focused,

372
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:05,988
which if you're working in visual art,

373
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:08,009
it's generally considered to be a big no-no.

374
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:11,131
It's like you wanna have more interesting compositions

375
00:22:11,211 --> 00:22:13,052
and kind of a flow of where you're looking,

376
00:22:13,152 --> 00:22:18,276
but if your effort is to create a meditative experience,

377
00:22:18,876 --> 00:22:22,678
I believe that giving people a very obvious place to look

378
00:22:22,878 --> 00:22:25,720
and keeping it fairly still is a good technique.

379
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:30,401
Scenes and visitations breathe.

380
00:22:31,242 --> 00:22:33,062
They're variations in a way that mirrors

381
00:22:33,123 --> 00:22:35,904
the shifting sensations and biorhythms of the user.

382
00:22:36,004 --> 00:22:37,684
So when you're doing a meditation

383
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,405
that involves paying attention to your breath,

384
00:22:40,366 --> 00:22:41,726
it's kind of the same.

385
00:22:41,746 --> 00:22:42,126
It's like.

386
00:22:42,771 --> 00:22:46,234
It comes in, it goes out, but the sensations are also changing constantly.

387
00:22:46,314 --> 00:22:54,319
So I made an effort to do things like change the color of the sky in rhythmic ways where

388
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:59,623
it's like changing back and forth, but also it included some randomness.

389
00:23:00,164 --> 00:23:06,989
So you kind of notice things changing and it gives a feeling of the experience deepening

390
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:08,129
or unfolding in a way.

391
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:13,072
that's different than just scenes that are strictly looping.

392
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:15,574
So if you look at a looping animation,

393
00:23:15,634 --> 00:23:17,455
at least for myself, I always notice the loop.

394
00:23:19,476 --> 00:23:22,137
And I think the fact that these experiences

395
00:23:22,157 --> 00:23:23,278
are always changing a little bit,

396
00:23:23,418 --> 00:23:25,539
creates them, makes for an experience

397
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:26,360
that's a little deeper.

398
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,561
So part of the reason that works is because all the scenes

399
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:33,884
are procedurally generated or procedurally modified

400
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:36,146
to some extent, some more than others.

401
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:40,270
Some are very procedural and some just have,

402
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,132
you know, subtle effects that are procedural.

403
00:23:43,453 --> 00:23:45,595
So, you know, typical video game thing,

404
00:23:45,615 --> 00:23:49,258
you know, it's like randomizing the cave, same idea.

405
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:51,840
It's always similar, but a little bit different.

406
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:54,363
Fractals, I talked about a bit.

407
00:24:04,465 --> 00:24:06,967
So oral techniques in addition to strobe lights

408
00:24:07,828 --> 00:24:09,029
affecting your brainwaves.

409
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:12,932
Binaural beats is this idea that you can play

410
00:24:13,032 --> 00:24:15,394
one tone in one ear and another tone in the other ear

411
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:18,677
and your brain will actually find a middle tone

412
00:24:19,518 --> 00:24:22,981
that creates a kind of wah-wah-wah like beats between them.

413
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,663
So if you have a 440 tone and a 450 tone,

414
00:24:25,683 --> 00:24:27,505
you're gonna wind up with a 10 hertz beat.

415
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,868
And that again corresponds to alpha brainwaves.

416
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:34,978
So there are, so isochronic beats are similar,

417
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:38,803
but instead of having two pure tones in each ear,

418
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,028
each ear can hear both of those tones

419
00:24:42,228 --> 00:24:44,531
and the rhythms are a little bit more obvious.

420
00:24:45,881 --> 00:24:49,002
So I worked with East Forest, who's an amazing musician.

421
00:24:49,102 --> 00:24:51,523
He's Idaho based and Utah based.

422
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,724
We just did a performance together in Las Vegas.

423
00:24:55,105 --> 00:24:58,106
And he specializes in creating musical experiences

424
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:01,107
for people who are doing mushroom ceremonies.

425
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,428
So he creates five hour long albums.

426
00:25:04,828 --> 00:25:07,649
The music that he releases as albums,

427
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,010
like tend to be very pleasing.

428
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,071
The music that he does for ceremonies.

429
00:25:12,071 --> 00:25:14,933
tend to have a little bit more complexity in their emotions.

430
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,793
And sometimes there's a little awkwardness,

431
00:25:16,914 --> 00:25:20,876
and sometimes there's sort of heavier emotions,

432
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:25,238
in part because it's more experimental,

433
00:25:25,298 --> 00:25:28,059
but he's also sort of exploring the range of emotions

434
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:32,001
that come up over the course of an experience like that.

435
00:25:32,861 --> 00:25:35,403
I also worked with Dr. Deirdre Barrett, who's a.

436
00:25:36,198 --> 00:25:40,663
researcher at Harvard and we are actually collaborating right now on a project with

437
00:25:40,803 --> 00:25:46,611
HTC about dreams and she does a dream induction in visitations and this is not part of the

438
00:25:46,631 --> 00:25:48,613
study, this is the app that we released.

439
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:53,279
And then there's also a body scan meditation.

440
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:57,842
So again, that was more for the home user.

441
00:25:57,982 --> 00:26:01,864
The body scan meditation is also procedurally modified.

442
00:26:01,944 --> 00:26:04,005
We pre-recorded prompts,

443
00:26:04,325 --> 00:26:07,627
and then we randomly play them back in different orders.

444
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:11,990
And then Radha is a partner of East Forest,

445
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,953
and she provided a progressive muscle relaxation meditation

446
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:17,814
and a body scan.

447
00:26:19,414 --> 00:26:26,997
And both of, so for that, we put that together for Healthy Mind Solutions, which is a clinic in Australia,

448
00:26:27,057 --> 00:26:31,759
and they were interested in seeing what kind of meditation works better to reduce people's anxiety,

449
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:34,640
whether it's the PMR or the body scan.

450
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:40,422
It seems like studies outside of VR suggest that body scan meditations are more effective.

451
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:47,095
And then a lot of audio is connected to things that you see in the space, so diegetic audio.

452
00:26:47,255 --> 00:26:52,441
So as lights are strobing, the audio is strobing as well.

453
00:26:52,581 --> 00:27:01,070
So it kind of enhances your sense of actually being in a place, and they amplify the effects

454
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,570
of each other.

455
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,593
So the visuals amplify the sound, sound amplifies the visuals.

456
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,741
VR is amazing on its own, just as a medium.

457
00:27:10,522 --> 00:27:12,963
Something that I have found a little challenging

458
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:15,905
as an artist with VR as a medium

459
00:27:16,045 --> 00:27:17,786
is that people are so amazed by the medium,

460
00:27:17,826 --> 00:27:20,807
it can be hard for them to provide useful feedback.

461
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:24,589
So you have to work a little harder with people to

462
00:27:28,043 --> 00:27:32,608
get the kind of feedback that you want to see if the thing that you're making is actually good and

463
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:38,275
enjoyable or if they just think VR is amazing. So that's just an ongoing issue because still

464
00:27:38,455 --> 00:27:41,879
most people have not used VR or have barely used VR.

465
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:49,212
Some people really don't tolerate VR that well,

466
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:51,314
but for the most part, if you design things properly,

467
00:27:51,374 --> 00:27:53,296
the vast majority of people won't get sick

468
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:57,300
and can at least enjoy the experience

469
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,263
for the 30 minutes to one hour that they are,

470
00:28:01,544 --> 00:28:03,646
that they're in the experience at the clinic.

471
00:28:04,928 --> 00:28:07,770
So VR completely captures your attention.

472
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:10,712
If you're watching a screen,

473
00:28:10,752 --> 00:28:12,533
there's always gonna be things in the periphery,

474
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:15,375
maybe people in front of you, other things happening,

475
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:18,737
your phone is there, et cetera, issues like that.

476
00:28:18,938 --> 00:28:20,819
So when you're in VR, everything,

477
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:22,120
you're in a completely different place.

478
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,561
As far as your brain is concerned,

479
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:25,862
you've left the room and gone somewhere else.

480
00:28:27,563 --> 00:28:30,524
And of course, VR isn't just vision.

481
00:28:30,744 --> 00:28:33,444
You can connect things to scent and vibroacoustics,

482
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:37,165
temperature, wind, all of that stuff.

483
00:28:38,746 --> 00:28:43,527
Adam Gazaley is working on a project right now

484
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:45,207
called ScentSync that actually combines

485
00:28:45,227 --> 00:28:46,348
all of these things together.

486
00:28:46,968 --> 00:28:49,368
There are a variety of efforts toward creating these.

487
00:28:50,889 --> 00:28:55,812
fully sensory encompassing pods that include all of these senses as well.

488
00:28:55,832 --> 00:29:00,055
So that was one thing that we tried to do with rainbow therapy at the spa was

489
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:04,578
basically overload all of your senses at once and by overloading all of your

490
00:29:04,598 --> 00:29:09,501
senses you have an experience that's similar to sensory deprivation.

491
00:29:11,091 --> 00:29:13,012
So there's a book called VRX that I would recommend

492
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:14,213
if you're interested in this space.

493
00:29:14,293 --> 00:29:16,755
It's a broad overview and it's very entertaining.

494
00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:20,077
It covers a lot of research into the therapeutic use of VR.

495
00:29:22,318 --> 00:29:24,920
So VR requires onboarding.

496
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,342
So this is a big blocker when it comes to

497
00:29:27,502 --> 00:29:29,984
getting VR headsets into therapeutic spaces.

498
00:29:30,304 --> 00:29:31,945
There's a lot going on at a clinic.

499
00:29:35,322 --> 00:29:38,227
The time of nurses and doctors are pretty precious.

500
00:29:38,267 --> 00:29:39,890
They don't necessarily have a lot of time

501
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,212
to be troubleshooting headsets.

502
00:29:41,793 --> 00:29:43,596
You really need to be able to create something

503
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:45,319
where they can just like grab it and.

504
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:51,007
give it to somebody and have everything be extremely obvious and easy, and that's tricky.

505
00:29:52,148 --> 00:29:57,272
I enjoyed using the Oculus Go. I'm sad that they've been discontinued because they were so easy to

506
00:29:57,293 --> 00:30:02,617
work with, and this experience was designed to be strictly a three degree of freedom experience.

507
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:09,924
It works on the Quest and it works on other headsets, but it doesn't make much use of that

508
00:30:09,964 --> 00:30:12,186
sixth degree of freedom. And that sixth off headset...

509
00:30:13,027 --> 00:30:16,793
has a lot more going on in terms of setup and tracking

510
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:17,936
and all of that stuff.

511
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:21,161
So yeah, for this kind of experience

512
00:30:21,201 --> 00:30:22,904
where it's made for people who are lying down,

513
00:30:22,924 --> 00:30:25,068
3DOF headsets have a huge advantage.

514
00:30:29,756 --> 00:30:34,598
So as doctors and clinicians are interested in getting in the space,

515
00:30:35,118 --> 00:30:36,078
they need to work with artists.

516
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:41,661
Artists are people that know how to work with narrative, color, sounds.

517
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:46,562
You know, it's like we know how to begin an experience and

518
00:30:46,662 --> 00:30:49,644
end an experience, you know, all of that kind of stuff.

519
00:30:49,684 --> 00:30:52,205
It's like we also have intuitions, like we know how to.

520
00:30:52,805 --> 00:30:55,426
use ourselves as our first research subject.

521
00:30:56,506 --> 00:30:58,546
You know, in medicine and in therapy,

522
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,167
it's like ideally you're getting feedback

523
00:31:00,207 --> 00:31:01,707
from dozens or hundreds of people.

524
00:31:02,508 --> 00:31:04,148
But as an artist, you know, the first person

525
00:31:04,168 --> 00:31:06,109
that you have to tap into is yourself.

526
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:08,269
And that's something that we've learned how to do

527
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:09,410
and trained ourself to do,

528
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,051
and it's not necessarily as easy as, you know,

529
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,671
people who don't have as much experience

530
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:16,492
creating things think that it is.

531
00:31:16,772 --> 00:31:18,993
So it's super important that the,

532
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:27,017
The doctors and the scientists that are the best in the world are also working with artists that are the best in the world in this space, ideally.

533
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:35,743
So these are my main collaborators right now. I mentioned them. This is East Forest, Dr. Barrett.

534
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:43,027
So in addition to use in ketamine-assisted therapy,

535
00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:51,597
I am working with another team right now on bringing similar experiences into a space

536
00:31:51,717 --> 00:31:54,860
with other medicines, like actually TBD Other Medicines.

537
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:02,086
It's for a big pharmaceutical company that's developing other kinds of substances, and

538
00:32:02,146 --> 00:32:05,309
we are working together right now to figure out how to pair these.

539
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:09,911
Right now, our approach is actually to create experiences

540
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:13,372
for pre and post trip experiences.

541
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:20,336
So there's a question of whether you should,

542
00:32:20,696 --> 00:32:23,717
whether it's dangerous, what issues could arise

543
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:27,139
from actually having people inside of a VR experience

544
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:31,121
while they're tripping on mushrooms, let's say.

545
00:32:31,881 --> 00:32:33,742
Different people have different feelings about that,

546
00:32:33,822 --> 00:32:34,503
but in general.

547
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:41,578
There's a sense that it's probably best to try to avoid that at least for now and sort of ease into that space by giving

548
00:32:41,618 --> 00:32:44,242
people pre and post trip experiences.

549
00:32:44,823 --> 00:32:50,391
So to get them prepared with a meditation and then to kind of like bring them bring them back down at the end with another

550
00:32:50,431 --> 00:32:50,912
experience.

551
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:56,498
In addition to that, I've brought my headset to the dentist and it makes it so much better.

552
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:03,265
Just like being in another space instead of looking at that dentist light and paying attention

553
00:33:03,385 --> 00:33:08,411
to whatever horrible sounds are happening, it reduces pain and it makes the whole thing

554
00:33:08,431 --> 00:33:09,031
more enjoyable.

555
00:33:09,091 --> 00:33:11,574
So dentistry is a huge and amazing use for VR.

556
00:33:13,456 --> 00:33:16,578
Other kinds of infusions, chemotherapy, like whatever.

557
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:19,900
So any place where you're sort of forced to be in a place

558
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,564
and you'd rather not be there, VR is super helpful for that.

559
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:26,966
And then of course, painful procedures.

560
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:30,848
Teletherapy I think could be really interesting,

561
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,970
just like improving a sense of presence

562
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,192
with the therapist that you're working with.

563
00:33:36,292 --> 00:33:38,414
Meditation training wheels, again, not everybody.

564
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,638
meditating is hard and it's boring.

565
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:47,001
And there's this, a word that I'm kind of getting into

566
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:48,122
called mindful attainment.

567
00:33:48,343 --> 00:33:51,866
So it's kind of like entertaining meditations

568
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,727
or meditative experiences.

569
00:33:54,448 --> 00:33:56,109
And sort of having an experience like that

570
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:57,931
could make it easier to get to the place

571
00:33:58,031 --> 00:34:01,734
where you are meditating and sort of orienting

572
00:34:02,135 --> 00:34:03,816
your mind the way that you would like to.

573
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,958
So I think that that is an interesting use

574
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:09,021
for this kind of experience.

575
00:34:10,543 --> 00:34:14,447
And then of course, in addition to having the

576
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:19,291
in-clinic experience, being able to take the headset home

577
00:34:19,311 --> 00:34:21,874
and revisit that and reinforce it,

578
00:34:22,454 --> 00:34:24,256
I think can also, potentially,

579
00:34:24,276 --> 00:34:25,737
has the potential, it hasn't been studied yet,

580
00:34:25,778 --> 00:34:28,480
but I think that that could extend the usefulness

581
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,641
of ketamine and other things.

582
00:34:30,322 --> 00:34:34,307
One thing about ketamine compared to other psychedelics is that the positive benefits

583
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:36,670
tend to only last a week or two or maybe a month.

584
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:41,356
With mushrooms, with acid, people have experiences that change them forever.

585
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:44,721
It's not as much the case with ketamine.

586
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:49,246
So yeah, maybe having the sense memory of being back in VR could help with that too.

587
00:34:50,814 --> 00:34:53,556
So this is very much a work in progress slide

588
00:34:53,616 --> 00:34:57,780
and kind of just like a work in progress activity of mine.

589
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,262
So it's like creating visitations for the clinic

590
00:35:01,302 --> 00:35:04,024
was a constrained process.

591
00:35:04,245 --> 00:35:05,546
There was not much interaction.

592
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,167
People were just switching scenes.

593
00:35:07,847 --> 00:35:10,990
All of the audio was ambient and diegetic.

594
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,091
People could bring their own music if they wanted to.

595
00:35:13,532 --> 00:35:15,373
But creating an app for home users

596
00:35:15,874 --> 00:35:17,355
who have lots of different goals

597
00:35:17,435 --> 00:35:18,776
and want to do lots of different things.

598
00:35:19,677 --> 00:35:20,337
is a different thing.

599
00:35:20,638 --> 00:35:22,540
So my efforts in that space

600
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,222
are a little experimental right now.

601
00:35:24,362 --> 00:35:27,005
I have a game that works in visitation,

602
00:35:27,065 --> 00:35:29,708
so it's just a very simple game

603
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:32,951
to just help you focus on

604
00:35:34,773 --> 00:35:38,616
Something very simple, so it's basically just like guiding a ball through rings,

605
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:43,220
and the rings get faster and faster, so you are forced to pay enough attention

606
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,623
to where you can keep the ball going through the rings. It's very easy, but it

607
00:35:47,663 --> 00:35:50,065
does sort of force you to focus in some ways.

608
00:35:53,388 --> 00:35:59,733
One thing about meditation or hypnosis is that a lot of this relies on your own

609
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:05,138
internal mental imagery. I tried a VR meditation the other day that was

610
00:36:05,198 --> 00:36:08,781
beautiful. Lots of interesting things were happening in it, but the voiceover

611
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:13,045
was telling me to visualize things. So it said it was a chakra meditation and it

612
00:36:13,085 --> 00:36:15,547
was asking me to visualize, you know, it's like a bright...

613
00:36:16,227 --> 00:36:19,849
warm red light in my chest and I'm like, but I'm looking at a blue light right now.

614
00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:25,473
So, you know, there was a bit of a disconnect. So if you're doing voiceover meditations and you're

615
00:36:25,493 --> 00:36:29,775
asking people to imagine things, you also have to be respectful of the fact that they are looking

616
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:35,598
at something too. So that's kind of the difference between meditative, meditation, mental imagery,

617
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:40,902
things you're actually seeing. So if you're in a situation that's difficult or challenging,

618
00:36:40,982 --> 00:36:44,544
being distracted and being forced to look at something is pretty powerful. But if you're

619
00:36:44,564 --> 00:36:45,084
trying to.

620
00:36:46,868 --> 00:36:48,669
learn how to meditate at some point,

621
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:53,290
closed eye meditation or whatever,

622
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,331
like focusing on a piece of lint in the corner,

623
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:57,032
I think is probably just as powerful

624
00:36:57,092 --> 00:36:59,373
as looking at anything that you could see in VR, really.

625
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:03,034
So some other things I'm interested in

626
00:37:03,094 --> 00:37:05,495
is this idea that you could conjure sense memories.

627
00:37:05,935 --> 00:37:09,216
So making trippy graphics that look trippy,

628
00:37:09,276 --> 00:37:11,437
is that like really what you need to meditate?

629
00:37:12,157 --> 00:37:15,339
Not necessarily, but if you use those graphics in a way

630
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:19,222
to conjure up experiences in people that they've had before,

631
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:21,883
is that desirable?

632
00:37:22,104 --> 00:37:22,704
Is that helpful?

633
00:37:23,024 --> 00:37:26,446
I'm not sure, but interesting subject.

634
00:37:27,327 --> 00:37:29,208
Something that I try to avoid is

635
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:32,390
any kind of cultural appropriation,

636
00:37:33,591 --> 00:37:36,152
and that includes new age cultural appropriation,

637
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:37,613
so I don't use any

638
00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:43,077
What's the word I'm looking for?

639
00:37:43,197 --> 00:37:44,519
Sacred geometry, let's say.

640
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,401
But that's kind of a question.

641
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,203
If somebody responds to sacred geometry

642
00:37:49,243 --> 00:37:50,625
and they love sacred geometry,

643
00:37:50,745 --> 00:37:52,847
is looking at sacred geometry gonna get them

644
00:37:53,547 --> 00:37:56,170
to a different place than if they're not looking at it?

645
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,811
So that's a question.

646
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:00,694
So flow is something I'm also,

647
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:03,056
you know, it's like if you're a game designer,

648
00:38:04,057 --> 00:38:06,519
Flow is a really important thing to consider.

649
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:09,580
So my other experience, Cosmic Sugar,

650
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,842
is much more in line with the kind of experience

651
00:38:12,902 --> 00:38:15,703
that can conjure a sense of flow.

652
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,085
Visitations is more of a kind of lean back.

653
00:38:20,266 --> 00:38:22,646
and pay attention to things and notice things

654
00:38:22,726 --> 00:38:25,627
and be open to things, flow's a little different

655
00:38:25,707 --> 00:38:27,528
in that it's asking you for engagement

656
00:38:27,648 --> 00:38:30,969
and getting into something and sort of succeeding

657
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:33,270
at something and gaining a skill and that kind of thing.

658
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,091
So which of those is gonna be more useful?

659
00:38:37,131 --> 00:38:40,592
And I would say probably flow is a little bit more helpful

660
00:38:40,672 --> 00:38:43,393
for people who are sober and don't necessarily

661
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:45,454
need to be distracted but are interested

662
00:38:45,494 --> 00:38:47,874
in having an experience to kind of get them

663
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:48,735
to a different place.

664
00:38:49,976 --> 00:38:51,358
So novelty is another issue.

665
00:38:51,638 --> 00:38:56,145
Like if you're meditating, novelty is undesirable.

666
00:38:56,265 --> 00:38:59,490
It's like if you're meditating, you have your shrine

667
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,312
or you have your closed eyes or whatever,

668
00:39:01,412 --> 00:39:03,535
you're paying attention to what is if you are.

669
00:39:04,977 --> 00:39:06,839
creating a mindful attainment experience,

670
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:12,543
then the experience of seeing something new regularly,

671
00:39:12,663 --> 00:39:15,365
like new content is probably gonna be the thing

672
00:39:15,385 --> 00:39:17,106
that you're gonna want to kind of get people

673
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,068
into that space of being open

674
00:39:20,088 --> 00:39:22,970
to getting into a meditative state of mind.

675
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:27,513
So this, more questions than answers,

676
00:39:27,914 --> 00:39:31,676
and we're figuring all of this stuff out right now.

677
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:34,538
All of this stuff is brand new.

678
00:39:35,274 --> 00:39:37,418
And that's part of why I'm really attracted to this space

679
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:39,801
is we have this opportunity to create

680
00:39:40,322 --> 00:39:41,684
a new kind of visual culture

681
00:39:41,764 --> 00:39:43,988
and a new approach to digital shamanism,

682
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,233
which I think is really interesting.

683
00:39:49,082 --> 00:39:53,607
So some other considerations, 360 video versus real time graphics.

684
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:59,733
Is looking at a 360 video of a beach that somebody shot, is that as good or is it better

685
00:39:59,793 --> 00:40:00,674
than real time graphics?

686
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:05,419
As a content creator, I would tend to say that real time graphics are definitely better.

687
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,321
hasn't been studied.

688
00:40:08,602 --> 00:40:12,365
So, you know, is a bad video better than

689
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,267
really good real-time graphics or vice versa?

690
00:40:16,808 --> 00:40:17,528
And what is good?

691
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:19,790
So there's like kind of a lot of questions there

692
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,471
about like what's really gonna work.

693
00:40:25,155 --> 00:40:27,437
I like this term, the uncanny valley of photorealism.

694
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:33,262
So if you're familiar with the uncanny valley, it's like the more realistic an industrial

695
00:40:33,302 --> 00:40:33,942
robot gets.

696
00:40:34,203 --> 00:40:40,168
As an industrial robot goes from a chunk of metal to a fully accurate human, there's a

697
00:40:40,228 --> 00:40:43,331
place where they get into this spot of being kind of corpse-like.

698
00:40:44,252 --> 00:40:46,773
and it's disturbing to us to see something

699
00:40:46,793 --> 00:40:48,173
that's almost human but not quite,

700
00:40:48,233 --> 00:40:51,114
so I think the same thing is true with graphics,

701
00:40:51,374 --> 00:40:54,396
where it's like, it's almost a beautiful nature scene

702
00:40:54,476 --> 00:40:56,697
but not quite, you know, I wonder how much,

703
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:58,537
I mean, as a creator, I see that,

704
00:40:58,637 --> 00:41:01,899
and I'm resistant to graphics that aren't quite good,

705
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:03,759
but I wonder if that's also true of people

706
00:41:03,779 --> 00:41:06,541
who don't have as much experience actually creating things.

707
00:41:08,101 --> 00:41:09,782
You know, should it be something

708
00:41:09,822 --> 00:41:11,462
that's like very easy or challenging?

709
00:41:11,563 --> 00:41:13,343
So if it's challenging, it might be more.

710
00:41:14,684 --> 00:41:16,846
prone to creating a state of flow.

711
00:41:16,866 --> 00:41:19,769
If it's easygoing, it might make it easier to meditate.

712
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:21,711
So understanding what your audience wants

713
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:23,293
is a really important part of this.

714
00:41:24,314 --> 00:41:25,515
Trying to be realistic again

715
00:41:25,575 --> 00:41:27,517
kind of goes back to the uncanny valley.

716
00:41:28,258 --> 00:41:30,980
Is it better to try to be realistic and maybe fail,

717
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,343
or is it better to lean into a more illustrative approach

718
00:41:34,584 --> 00:41:35,545
which is a little bit more.

719
00:41:35,695 --> 00:41:38,916
you know, just from the perspective of animating

720
00:41:40,476 --> 00:41:43,457
and budgets, creating something that is illustrative

721
00:41:44,657 --> 00:41:49,659
and beautiful can require less production resources

722
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:52,199
than trying to do something that's amazing in photo real.

723
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:54,520
That top image is from Supernatural.

724
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,120
It's a game from within.

725
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,361
If you haven't tried it, they have far and away the best.

726
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:01,502
photorealistic VR environments that I've seen,

727
00:42:02,222 --> 00:42:04,062
in part because they actually use real photos

728
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:06,443
and do an amazing job of photogrammetry.

729
00:42:06,643 --> 00:42:10,003
But the scenes are not very dynamic,

730
00:42:10,804 --> 00:42:14,024
and they're very much locked to being in a single position,

731
00:42:14,184 --> 00:42:16,765
so to create an experience that's as good as that,

732
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,265
that you can actually move around in,

733
00:42:18,886 --> 00:42:21,446
and that changes gets very expensive very fast.

734
00:42:22,566 --> 00:42:25,127
So budgets are always a part of considerations

735
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:25,887
with all of this stuff.

736
00:42:26,667 --> 00:42:28,088
So abstract versus figurative,

737
00:42:28,962 --> 00:42:30,305
Like, what are people going to like more?

738
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:36,238
My intuition initially was that abstract imagery was the thing.

739
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,062
Turns out that...

740
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:41,254
People like natural spaces just as much.

741
00:42:41,474 --> 00:42:44,495
It's like kind of 50-50 in my experience

742
00:42:44,555 --> 00:42:46,196
which visitations people like the most.

743
00:42:46,696 --> 00:42:50,277
Right now I have six natural landscapes and visitations

744
00:42:50,497 --> 00:42:53,178
and six abstract scenes.

745
00:42:53,758 --> 00:42:55,619
I started off making abstract scenes

746
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:57,980
and wanted to test to see if people

747
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,580
would like natural scenes more.

748
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,241
And I wound up bringing some of the lessons that I learned

749
00:43:03,301 --> 00:43:05,621
from the abstract scenes into the natural scenes.

750
00:43:05,681 --> 00:43:07,702
So that's like the tunnel-like compositions,

751
00:43:07,782 --> 00:43:09,022
the single point of focus,

752
00:43:09,822 --> 00:43:11,822
kind of similar techniques can be used

753
00:43:12,743 --> 00:43:14,003
to create natural scenes.

754
00:43:14,043 --> 00:43:15,483
And they're very illustrative.

755
00:43:15,603 --> 00:43:17,784
I did not try to do anything photorealistic.

756
00:43:18,464 --> 00:43:19,524
Again, 360 versus 180.

757
00:43:19,824 --> 00:43:21,484
Do you want people looking around or not?

758
00:43:22,884 --> 00:43:24,405
Do you wanna be exploring more

759
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,805
or do you wanna be situated in a spot?

760
00:43:28,126 --> 00:43:28,826
More questions.

761
00:43:28,986 --> 00:43:31,327
So this is some of the stuff I wanna do in the future.

762
00:43:31,367 --> 00:43:33,188
I wanna keep collaborating with people.

763
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:34,589
I wanna collaborate with therapists.

764
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:36,810
I wanna study the effectiveness,

765
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,811
or I want somebody else to study the effectiveness

766
00:43:38,851 --> 00:43:40,972
because it turns out that studying effectiveness

767
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:42,573
is actually incredibly expensive.

768
00:43:43,513 --> 00:43:46,215
At a minimum, if you wanna take a VR experience

769
00:43:46,355 --> 00:43:47,816
and see if it really works

770
00:43:48,176 --> 00:43:50,697
and if it actually improves people's mental health,

771
00:43:51,498 --> 00:43:52,518
it's like $100,000 to $500,000 to do a study like that.

772
00:43:56,471 --> 00:43:57,552
So hopefully somebody will do that.

773
00:43:57,712 --> 00:44:01,096
I know that they're in the works, and they also take a long time.

774
00:44:01,336 --> 00:44:04,380
So the study that we did is actually not about effectiveness.

775
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:08,305
The study that we did is about preference, which is much easier.

776
00:44:08,425 --> 00:44:13,571
So we just wanted to do a survey and show that people tolerated it and liked it.

777
00:44:14,432 --> 00:44:19,258
We did do a pre and post depression scale survey,

778
00:44:20,179 --> 00:44:21,742
but given the small sample size

779
00:44:22,022 --> 00:44:24,665
and the fact that ketamine is such a powerful antidepressant,

780
00:44:25,306 --> 00:44:27,589
there's no way that we could really see from that study

781
00:44:27,629 --> 00:44:30,173
if it was actually effective, just that people liked it.

782
00:44:31,374 --> 00:44:32,934
I want to work with different artists.

783
00:44:33,334 --> 00:44:37,695
I want to make a way for people to record their intentions and record their reflections

784
00:44:37,755 --> 00:44:40,176
so that they can visit those things after the fact.

785
00:44:40,976 --> 00:44:46,838
I'd like to create networked experiences so that therapists can actually create custom

786
00:44:46,878 --> 00:44:48,798
experiences for people and share those.

787
00:44:51,266 --> 00:44:57,690
That would also allow for, let's say, more junior therapists to guide sessions with material

788
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:00,552
that is made by more experienced therapists.

789
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:03,854
So that's something that East Forest is actually working on right now.

790
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:12,059
He has a startup company called Journey Space, and they're doing networked teletherapy ceremonies.

791
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,541
And the idea is to eventually have...

792
00:45:16,982 --> 00:45:19,743
a lot of music and a lot of materials and resources

793
00:45:20,824 --> 00:45:24,365
so that it's easier for people who haven't had all that time to

794
00:45:24,745 --> 00:45:28,947
create all of their own content to hop in and lead groups of people through these

795
00:45:28,987 --> 00:45:29,567
experiences.

796
00:45:31,468 --> 00:45:34,830
I'm interested in working with different kinds of inputs.

797
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:39,412
So I recently got a HP Reverb Omnicept,

798
00:45:39,452 --> 00:45:43,914
which has a heart rate monitor and also can track your eye.

799
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,936
And that includes pupil dilation.

800
00:45:47,136 --> 00:45:48,376
And from pupil dilation,

801
00:45:48,416 --> 00:45:50,397
you can kind of see how activated people are.

802
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,778
So I think it's sort of similar

803
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:53,959
to the way a galvanic skin response would work.

804
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:55,720
And that's all built right into the headset.

805
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,261
So sort of using that to feedback into people's experience.

806
00:46:00,321 --> 00:46:02,142
I will say one thing that we tried at the spa

807
00:46:02,222 --> 00:46:03,282
just before it shut down,

808
00:46:03,422 --> 00:46:04,762
one of the activations that we did

809
00:46:04,822 --> 00:46:09,063
was connecting a gong to your heartbeat.

810
00:46:09,383 --> 00:46:12,184
And so every time your heart beat, the gong would ring.

811
00:46:12,684 --> 00:46:14,765
And it was actually surprisingly stressful.

812
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:19,226
So I'm very curious to see how these different

813
00:46:20,466 --> 00:46:22,646
feedback devices can work.

814
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:23,987
Because right now I'm not sure

815
00:46:24,067 --> 00:46:25,867
that I need to do some experimenting myself.

816
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:30,273
So pressure sensing, I've been wanting to,

817
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:32,877
you know, it's like if you think about painful experiences

818
00:46:32,897 --> 00:46:35,401
you're going through, you might want to like grip

819
00:46:35,441 --> 00:46:38,766
something tightly, so having some kind of grip

820
00:46:38,946 --> 00:46:40,388
affect what you're seeing in VR,

821
00:46:40,428 --> 00:46:41,590
I think could be really interesting.

822
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:49,337
like bringing in the voice, there's a company called

823
00:46:49,857 --> 00:46:52,839
Entheo Digital, it was started by Robin Arnaud

824
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:54,080
and they're doing really interesting work.

825
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,442
They have an app called Soundself

826
00:46:56,943 --> 00:46:59,545
where you can kind of, it feeds back your own voice.

827
00:46:59,565 --> 00:47:03,448
I think that having the ability to use your voice

828
00:47:03,508 --> 00:47:05,850
as a controller could also be really interesting

829
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,332
and helpful in this space if that would lead

830
00:47:08,412 --> 00:47:11,374
to more intuitive controls, that kind of thing.

831
00:47:12,475 --> 00:47:15,217
So also really interested in other output devices.

832
00:47:15,577 --> 00:47:19,539
So working with dome spaces.

833
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,721
There's a place in New York called Frequency

834
00:47:21,781 --> 00:47:25,243
that has a dome and they do sort of live healing sessions

835
00:47:25,303 --> 00:47:26,203
in a space like that.

836
00:47:26,283 --> 00:47:29,065
So VR is just a display technology.

837
00:47:29,185 --> 00:47:32,027
You can display this content anywhere else as well.

838
00:47:33,068 --> 00:47:36,952
It's a little more than just a display technology, but it is display technology

839
00:47:37,652 --> 00:47:44,439
Custom displays as well as something I'm interested in experimenting with so you know ways to take LEDs and do interesting things with those the

840
00:47:45,574 --> 00:47:49,255
Rainbow Therapy, again, was a set of strobing LEDs

841
00:47:49,335 --> 00:47:51,095
that were designed for closed eyes,

842
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:53,596
but I'm very interested in exploring

843
00:47:53,876 --> 00:47:56,556
like low-resolution LED displays

844
00:47:56,616 --> 00:47:59,517
that can incorporate some of these strobing effects.

845
00:48:00,717 --> 00:48:02,077
Strobing effects work a lot better

846
00:48:02,137 --> 00:48:03,938
and are much more controllable with LEDs.

847
00:48:04,438 --> 00:48:07,058
With a display, you're sort of locked into

848
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:08,899
whatever the display rate of the screen is.

849
00:48:09,259 --> 00:48:09,919
So you can have...

850
00:48:11,331 --> 00:48:14,252
frequencies that are aligned with whatever your display is,

851
00:48:14,352 --> 00:48:15,632
but nothing really outside of that.

852
00:48:17,213 --> 00:48:18,293
And then I would love to,

853
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:21,274
I'd love to push a narrative in a way,

854
00:48:21,314 --> 00:48:25,895
but I think that with narratives that would unfold

855
00:48:25,955 --> 00:48:28,655
over the course of a series of medicine ceremonies,

856
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,276
really the user has to bring their own narrative to it.

857
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:33,597
So there's a question of like,

858
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:36,837
how do you create a narrative that's open enough,

859
00:48:36,938 --> 00:48:37,778
but also guided?

860
00:48:37,818 --> 00:48:40,158
And that's something else I'm interested in exploring.

861
00:48:41,893 --> 00:48:45,335
So I added this slide recently.

862
00:48:45,575 --> 00:48:47,416
Everybody wants to talk about the metaverse these days.

863
00:48:47,436 --> 00:48:50,577
I had a slightly snarkier slide before,

864
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:51,597
but toned it down a bit.

865
00:48:52,498 --> 00:48:54,759
So the good, like, you know, if you're,

866
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,560
if you spend your life in Minecraft or Roblox,

867
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,321
and that's a comfortable space for you,

868
00:48:59,401 --> 00:49:02,262
it could also be a very comfortable space to get therapy.

869
00:49:02,282 --> 00:49:04,223
If you're a kid and you meet up with your therapist

870
00:49:04,283 --> 00:49:05,824
and you're like doing Minecraft together,

871
00:49:05,844 --> 00:49:07,265
that could be a really positive thing.

872
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:12,486
It could also potentially increase access in the same way that video conferencing does,

873
00:49:12,606 --> 00:49:15,588
but it could potentially embody things a little bit better.

874
00:49:15,688 --> 00:49:21,090
So I think there are some interesting potentials with going from your life in the metaverse

875
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:23,150
to getting your therapy in the metaverse.

876
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,671
And obviously the biggest bad thing about it is...

877
00:49:26,872 --> 00:49:29,593
It's your mental health, it's very sensitive,

878
00:49:29,893 --> 00:49:32,534
and having big companies have any kind of access

879
00:49:32,614 --> 00:49:34,715
to that stuff could be very dangerous,

880
00:49:34,915 --> 00:49:37,096
so that's an important thing to consider.

881
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:41,458
Right now, Light Clinic is working with HTC

882
00:49:41,538 --> 00:49:43,059
on a project called Vive Dreaming,

883
00:49:43,459 --> 00:49:46,680
and chapter one will hopefully be getting released soon.

884
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,481
I'm also working with a company called Cyber,

885
00:49:49,521 --> 00:49:52,623
which is a healthcare gaming studio.

886
00:49:53,183 --> 00:49:57,329
and they're now part of ATAI, which is a very large company

887
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:00,233
that is developing a lot of novel psychedelic compounds.

888
00:50:01,314 --> 00:50:05,300
Rocket VR, we're working together to create experiences

889
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,643
to help people calm down when they're getting

890
00:50:07,823 --> 00:50:09,165
radiation therapy for cancer.

891
00:50:10,346 --> 00:50:18,574
and I'm working with Johns Hopkins on experiences for people who are having mushroom trips.

892
00:50:19,455 --> 00:50:21,857
So Visitations is currently in use in a few places.

893
00:50:22,537 --> 00:50:29,203
It's going to be in use at Penn, and I expect to keep working with it for a long time.

894
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:31,606
This is the studio.

895
00:50:32,787 --> 00:50:35,569
I chose the name Light Clinic in part because

896
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:39,933
the dot, like light dot, it was available as a website.

897
00:50:40,533 --> 00:50:41,494
I was like, this sounds cool.

898
00:50:42,055 --> 00:50:44,116
The problem is, I didn't think about it at the time,

899
00:50:44,156 --> 00:50:45,438
it's like I can't tell people,

900
00:50:45,998 --> 00:50:47,459
like if I just write light dot clinic,

901
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:49,181
it's not obviously a website.

902
00:50:49,621 --> 00:50:51,203
So I don't know if other people know how to deal

903
00:50:51,223 --> 00:50:54,425
with that stuff with their domains.

904
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:56,507
But light dot clinic is the website.

905
00:50:57,468 --> 00:50:59,789
I'll be adding more projects in there as they become available.

906
00:50:59,909 --> 00:51:04,210
One downside of working with startups, and in the healthcare space, the healthcare space

907
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:04,950
is very slow.

908
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,591
Startups don't want to sort of share their stuff.

909
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:11,512
So there's actually other startups that are so like stealth that they don't even want

910
00:51:11,532 --> 00:51:13,033
me mentioning that I'm working with them.

911
00:51:14,473 --> 00:51:17,394
So as soon as I can, I'll be sharing other work from those projects.

912
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:22,376
But they're all, you know, kind of informed by what I learned from doing visitations.

913
00:51:23,758 --> 00:51:26,824
So that's, yeah, I think time-wise,

914
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:28,707
there's eight minutes for questions

915
00:51:28,787 --> 00:51:29,869
if anybody has any questions.

916
00:51:37,197 --> 00:51:42,839
I'm just going to go right for it. That was great, thank you. What from your experience and

917
00:51:42,859 --> 00:51:49,622
your own understanding of how folks interpret virtual reality do you think is good for

918
00:51:49,662 --> 00:51:54,724
people just in the current marketplace? I'm talking anything from a fully blown action game

919
00:51:55,285 --> 00:51:57,245
to the weirdest just straight up 180 degree video.

920
00:51:58,486 --> 00:52:01,789
anything that's currently out there that you would look at and go based on my

921
00:52:01,809 --> 00:52:06,352
understanding of how people respond to VR in a therapeutic way that they could

922
00:52:06,372 --> 00:52:08,774
get something out of it if they for example structured it differently like

923
00:52:09,194 --> 00:52:12,877
beat saber as a therapeutic exercise if you put on a custom song or anything of

924
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:16,060
the sort. I was just curious your take on. Yeah I think that's a great question

925
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,901
because I I I tend to think that

926
00:52:19,366 --> 00:52:21,027
almost anything can be therapeutic.

927
00:52:21,107 --> 00:52:24,410
I was gonna mention Tetris and Tetris Effect, let's say.

928
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:27,393
You know, it's kind of like whatever is therapeutic

929
00:52:27,413 --> 00:52:28,955
for you is therapeutic, right?

930
00:52:28,995 --> 00:52:32,598
So if you find it relaxing to be in a first-person

931
00:52:32,638 --> 00:52:34,200
shooter environment and shooting people,

932
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,641
then that's what's therapeutic for you.

933
00:52:35,721 --> 00:52:38,624
So I think that different things are just gonna work

934
00:52:38,664 --> 00:52:39,204
in different ways.

935
00:52:39,264 --> 00:52:41,907
So it kinda depends on what are your therapeutic goals

936
00:52:42,047 --> 00:52:42,487
and needs.

937
00:52:43,488 --> 00:52:45,970
And then I think a lot of it's just a matter of framing, you know

938
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,032
It's like you slow down Beat Saber and it's a Tai Chi experience

939
00:52:49,353 --> 00:52:49,873
But you know

940
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:55,937
Maybe what you need for your therapy right then is just to distract yourself from like whatever is annoying you at the time

941
00:52:56,038 --> 00:53:01,281
So I think yeah, I mean, I guess the short answer is almost anything can be therapeutic for sure

942
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:05,400
Hello, I have two questions.

943
00:53:05,801 --> 00:53:09,122
First one, how can I help this project

944
00:53:09,442 --> 00:53:12,764
and is it open for, I mean, like,

945
00:53:12,964 --> 00:53:16,366
experiment with it by myself and with friends?

946
00:53:17,807 --> 00:53:19,647
So, can you get the app and try it yourself?

947
00:53:19,707 --> 00:53:20,288
Is that the question?

948
00:53:21,528 --> 00:53:25,811
Yeah, but also, like, tinker with it as a developer

949
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:30,173
and try it and someone and myself.

950
00:53:30,985 --> 00:53:33,466
Oh, so to like take the code and make some modifications to it?

951
00:53:33,726 --> 00:53:34,606
Yeah, yeah.

952
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:36,087
Well, yeah, come talk to me later.

953
00:53:37,367 --> 00:53:42,028
It's not open source, so the code isn't out there, but if there are sort of techniques

954
00:53:42,089 --> 00:53:47,610
or tools that you're interested in working with, there are things that I could possibly

955
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:48,170
connect you to.

956
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:49,431
Okay, that's awesome.

957
00:53:49,871 --> 00:53:56,293
And the second question, you have a lot of experience with this, so how can I learn how

958
00:53:56,373 --> 00:53:58,833
to make fractals in 3D?

959
00:54:02,006 --> 00:54:02,846
Also, a big question.

960
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:05,888
There's a lot of answers to that.

961
00:54:06,388 --> 00:54:13,092
I actually have been working on a fractal making library for a long time and it's in

962
00:54:13,172 --> 00:54:17,654
kind of a halfway state but I am hoping to continue developing that and that would be

963
00:54:17,694 --> 00:54:21,996
an open source way to, actually this image right here was developed with that tool.

964
00:54:22,697 --> 00:54:24,319
And it's actually very flexible,

965
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:26,122
and I'm hoping to continue developing that.

966
00:54:26,282 --> 00:54:27,884
So that would be one way to do it.

967
00:54:27,944 --> 00:54:29,486
But again, if you wanna chat later,

968
00:54:29,507 --> 00:54:31,309
we can talk more about that.

969
00:54:31,549 --> 00:54:31,990
Thank you.

970
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:32,391
Thank you.

971
00:54:35,452 --> 00:54:41,035
Hello. I'm wondering if you can expand a bit more on the bird victims.

972
00:54:41,355 --> 00:54:45,376
Specifically, you mentioned that the patient reported reduced pain during the procedure.

973
00:54:45,957 --> 00:54:48,878
However, do you have any information about how much pain was produced?

974
00:54:48,898 --> 00:54:54,720
Did the, you know, did the surgeons doing the surgery report that it was easier to work with the patient?

975
00:54:54,821 --> 00:54:57,142
Did the surgery take less time?

976
00:54:57,182 --> 00:55:00,923
I know you don't have all the information and this wasn't a huge clinical trial,

977
00:55:00,963 --> 00:55:03,044
but can you expand a bit more on what your findings were?

978
00:55:04,326 --> 00:55:07,829
Um, so I was not working with burn patients, just to be clear about that.

979
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:11,371
That was a study that Hunter Hoffman did, um, at the university of Washington.

980
00:55:12,132 --> 00:55:13,993
Um, and it's very well documented.

981
00:55:14,253 --> 00:55:18,376
So, um, yeah, if you just Google snow world, uh, Hunter Hoffman.

982
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,158
you can get all the information there.

983
00:55:20,198 --> 00:55:22,539
And it's like, I don't remember all the exact numbers of like,

984
00:55:22,579 --> 00:55:25,581
you know, percentage of people that responded really well to it or

985
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:26,261
anything like that.

986
00:55:26,802 --> 00:55:30,644
But it was like definitely like statistically very significant and

987
00:55:31,265 --> 00:55:34,567
people enjoyed the experience a lot more and tolerated it very well.

988
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:36,008
Thank you.

989
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:39,690
Hi.

990
00:55:40,853 --> 00:55:45,599
So VR has great ability to make an immersive environment

991
00:55:45,639 --> 00:55:46,941
for patients and players,

992
00:55:47,522 --> 00:55:49,324
but one of the biggest downsides of it

993
00:55:49,404 --> 00:55:52,248
is obviously the immersion breaking of the physical device.

994
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,892
I was wondering if you had any specific strategies

995
00:55:54,932 --> 00:55:56,634
you implemented to help combat that effect.

996
00:55:57,677 --> 00:56:01,681
So when you say immersion breaking of the physical device, you mean just having a headset on your head?

997
00:56:01,821 --> 00:56:02,602
Yeah, basically.

998
00:56:03,262 --> 00:56:11,411
Um, yeah, I mean, it's like there's definitely some people just really don't like having a thing on their face and they find it sort of upsetting.

999
00:56:11,571 --> 00:56:20,060
So, I mean, the key really is just about how you introduce people to it and just kind of making

1000
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,921
making it a personal experience,

1001
00:56:22,161 --> 00:56:24,401
like that onboarding experience of that first moment

1002
00:56:24,441 --> 00:56:26,862
of having the headset put on your head and getting adjusted.

1003
00:56:27,502 --> 00:56:29,162
If that experience is pleasant,

1004
00:56:29,182 --> 00:56:30,823
then I think people tolerate it better.

1005
00:56:30,863 --> 00:56:32,203
It's like they tolerate it less well

1006
00:56:32,303 --> 00:56:34,703
if you just hand it to them and they put it on

1007
00:56:34,763 --> 00:56:36,284
and it doesn't fit right.

1008
00:56:36,304 --> 00:56:38,284
It's like some people will just hold the headset up

1009
00:56:38,344 --> 00:56:39,644
and they think to themselves like,

1010
00:56:39,905 --> 00:56:42,605
oh, it's like VR just isn't good because it doesn't fit.

1011
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:45,526
So I think that that personal connection

1012
00:56:45,646 --> 00:56:47,286
of the person who's putting the headset on

1013
00:56:47,386 --> 00:56:48,927
is extremely important.

1014
00:56:49,487 --> 00:56:51,929
And then, you know, at some point you do just have a thing

1015
00:56:51,989 --> 00:56:55,712
on your face, so people who are on large amounts of ketamine

1016
00:56:55,752 --> 00:56:57,834
don't really notice, I think, for the most part,

1017
00:56:57,854 --> 00:57:00,436
or nobody complained about that in particular.

1018
00:57:00,536 --> 00:57:05,681
But the Flow device that HTC just came out with

1019
00:57:06,021 --> 00:57:07,662
is a little bit lighter weight,

1020
00:57:08,443 --> 00:57:09,984
and a little easier to get on,

1021
00:57:10,084 --> 00:57:13,007
so it's just gonna get better and less of a concern.

1022
00:57:13,147 --> 00:57:14,548
But yeah, there's only so much you can do

1023
00:57:14,588 --> 00:57:15,769
about the fact that people just have

1024
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:16,690
a big thing on their face.

1025
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:17,831
Cool, thank you.

1026
00:57:21,995 --> 00:57:23,516
Great talk, very interesting, love it.

1027
00:57:24,657 --> 00:57:27,158
I'm pretty interested in, there's a comment

1028
00:57:27,198 --> 00:57:29,340
like learning more about the forest bathing in VR

1029
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,781
and like how that's going to, how that's gonna be

1030
00:57:32,001 --> 00:57:33,942
equivalent to like real forests.

1031
00:57:34,522 --> 00:57:37,264
So I'll have to find that article you talked about.

1032
00:57:38,024 --> 00:57:39,385
But that question made me think of,

1033
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:40,566
the previous question made me think of,

1034
00:57:40,986 --> 00:57:43,748
like are you thinking about AR and like how to do

1035
00:57:44,288 --> 00:57:48,330
these types of experiences in AR rather than completely VR

1036
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,671
because that might be a little more comfortable.

1037
00:57:50,606 --> 00:57:54,410
In my experience, people who work in the XR space are kind of like split in two camps.

1038
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:57,613
It's like some people love AR and some people love VR.

1039
00:57:57,713 --> 00:58:01,157
I love VR because of all of these qualities of being able to block the world out.

1040
00:58:02,518 --> 00:58:05,741
And it's more about narrative and immersion and that kind of thing.

1041
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:11,107
Whereas people who are excited about AR are, I think, very interested in sort of practical

1042
00:58:11,207 --> 00:58:12,148
uses and...

1043
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:14,502
and stuff like that.

1044
00:58:14,622 --> 00:58:18,265
So I have considered the idea of working in AR,

1045
00:58:18,305 --> 00:58:19,627
but it's not a passion area,

1046
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:21,108
and I would be more interested

1047
00:58:21,328 --> 00:58:25,292
if an AR headset manufacturer funded the development

1048
00:58:25,972 --> 00:58:26,453
of something.

1049
00:58:26,513 --> 00:58:29,656
But for this application,

1050
00:58:30,877 --> 00:58:32,838
the whole idea was to block out the fact

1051
00:58:32,858 --> 00:58:33,959
that you're in this clinic.

1052
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,722
So overlaying something on the clinic,

1053
00:58:36,762 --> 00:58:38,183
I don't think would be quite as powerful

1054
00:58:38,664 --> 00:58:39,845
for this particular use case.

1055
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,622
That's fair, yeah, thank you.

1056
00:58:41,782 --> 00:58:44,445
But actually, so I guess one last point to AR,

1057
00:58:44,465 --> 00:58:45,827
it's like, I think with teletherapy,

1058
00:58:45,867 --> 00:58:47,489
that could be really interesting, potentially,

1059
00:58:47,549 --> 00:58:49,772
but I think like the tech in general

1060
00:58:49,812 --> 00:58:50,893
still has a little ways to go.

1061
00:58:50,913 --> 00:58:53,036
Cool, thank you.

1062
00:58:53,276 --> 00:58:53,496
Thanks.

1063
00:58:56,619 --> 00:58:59,121
Amazing presentation, amazing products, thank you.

1064
00:59:00,021 --> 00:59:05,785
I was just reflecting on how a lot of meditations aim to take you into the body and you know

1065
00:59:05,825 --> 00:59:11,308
more the idea of the mind being fragmented outside of the body and then the body is a

1066
00:59:11,428 --> 00:59:14,250
tool for various outcomes.

1067
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:16,431
And you talked about how

1068
00:59:17,503 --> 00:59:19,786
VR, as far as your brain is concerned,

1069
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,067
you're basically not in your body.

1070
00:59:21,388 --> 00:59:24,231
So I was wondering if you could talk about maybe that

1071
00:59:24,612 --> 00:59:26,514
tension, or do you see it as a tension?

1072
00:59:26,574 --> 00:59:29,858
Do you see VR as applying just to these other types

1073
00:59:29,998 --> 00:59:32,942
of benefits, or somehow, are these compatible?

1074
00:59:33,956 --> 00:59:40,840
I definitely think it's a tension and I think it's a really interesting dynamic to explore.

1075
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:48,464
So my approach to sort of that tension between focus on your body but you're in this space

1076
00:59:48,504 --> 00:59:53,047
that's bringing you outside of your body was to present just very lightweight prompts.

1077
00:59:53,327 --> 00:59:57,689
Like if you're doing a body scan, it's like all about completely focusing on that part

1078
00:59:57,729 --> 00:59:58,149
of your body.

1079
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:04,752
So the prompts that I have are more about trying to combine focusing on a part of your

1080
01:00:04,792 --> 01:00:07,172
body and tying that to something out in space.

1081
01:00:07,933 --> 01:00:13,995
So there's a kind of meditation called open focus meditation, which is kind of a body

1082
01:00:14,015 --> 01:00:19,356
scan, but it's a body scan that involves imagining spaces between things.

1083
01:00:20,157 --> 01:00:25,819
So it's like in those meditations you'll be asked to imagine the volume of your finger

1084
01:00:25,899 --> 01:00:28,900
or the space between your hands and your throat or that kind of thing.

1085
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:35,342
So I think there's a way to incorporate elements in the outside with elements in your body.

1086
01:00:35,362 --> 01:00:38,643
And I think it's really just a matter of fine-tuning that.

1087
01:00:38,743 --> 01:00:41,004
And I have not fine-tuned that yet.

1088
01:00:41,124 --> 01:00:42,645
It's an ongoing process.

1089
01:00:42,725 --> 01:00:44,566
But then there's also the question of is that...

1090
01:00:45,706 --> 01:00:50,272
worthwhile or interesting thing to even pursue and like that's also something

1091
01:00:50,312 --> 01:00:54,477
I'm not sure about either because like a body scan meditation is so powerful and

1092
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:58,402
you really don't need to be looking at anything for it so it might just not be

1093
01:00:58,422 --> 01:01:01,806
a useful thing to have in VR at all potentially.

1094
01:01:06,688 --> 01:01:08,509
Hi, great presentation.

1095
01:01:08,529 --> 01:01:10,170
Thank you.

1096
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:19,495
Generally speaking, I have a question around the people who suffer from post-traumatic syndrome or who went through a war zone.

1097
01:01:19,595 --> 01:01:28,520
Do you have any, what is your opinion on it and how are you seeing this technology in helping those who's in need?

1098
01:01:29,726 --> 01:01:35,388
Yeah, with PTSD specifically, there's a scientist named Skip Rizzo who's done a lot of work

1099
01:01:35,408 --> 01:01:37,408
with that over a long period of time.

1100
01:01:38,089 --> 01:01:41,530
And the idea with PTSD, and I think I'm actually two minutes over already.

1101
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:45,791
So with PTSD, there's this idea called fear extinction.

1102
01:01:46,591 --> 01:01:50,652
And something you can do is actually recreate traumatic experiences for people.

1103
01:01:51,193 --> 01:01:55,394
And by putting them in a safe place and allowing them to re-experiencing something traumatic,

1104
01:01:55,434 --> 01:01:57,275
like let's say an IED exploding.

1105
01:01:58,795 --> 01:02:00,096
by your Humvee when you're in Iraq,

1106
01:02:00,156 --> 01:02:01,857
like that can actually sort of help

1107
01:02:02,057 --> 01:02:04,959
with reducing symptoms of PTSD.

1108
01:02:05,479 --> 01:02:07,200
So VR is really powerful for that

1109
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,341
and really interesting and not something

1110
01:02:09,361 --> 01:02:11,022
that I am personally exploring at all right now.

1111
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:12,843
Thank you.

1112
01:02:14,144 --> 01:02:15,424
Cool, okay, thanks everybody.

1113
01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:17,025
Thank you.

1114
01:02:17,045 --> 01:02:18,246
Thank you.

1115
01:02:18,966 --> 01:02:19,667
Thank you.

1116
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:20,507
Thank you.

1117
01:02:20,527 --> 01:02:20,747
Thank you.

1118
01:02:20,767 --> 01:02:20,947
Thank you.

1119
01:02:20,967 --> 01:02:21,148
Thank you.

1120
01:02:21,168 --> 01:02:21,368
Thank you.

1121
01:02:21,388 --> 01:02:21,588
Thank you.

1122
01:02:21,608 --> 01:02:21,788
Thank you.

1123
01:02:21,808 --> 01:02:22,008
Thank you.

1124
01:02:22,028 --> 01:02:22,288
Thank you.

1125
01:02:22,308 --> 01:02:22,528
Thank you.

1126
01:02:22,548 --> 01:02:22,728
Thank you.
