1
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:04,586
Thank you.

2
00:00:04,606 --> 00:00:05,107
Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:12,483
On that note of the meetup thing, at that same location tonight,

4
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:17,086
we are going to be doing a little sort of casual meetup get-together

5
00:00:17,126 --> 00:00:20,628
to chat more about location-based games and location-based storytelling,

6
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:22,350
starting at around 6 o'clock.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,152
So you guys are welcome to come and join us there

8
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:26,653
and continue the conversation.

9
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:28,494
And I'll remind you again at the end.

10
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:33,477
So come find us in the wrap-up room after for where that location is, I guess.

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,181
Cool, that's not what I want to do.

12
00:00:39,482 --> 00:00:40,322
That's what I want to do.

13
00:00:40,382 --> 00:00:41,643
So my name is Lucas Johnson.

14
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:43,124
Hey, hi.

15
00:00:44,385 --> 00:00:46,187
I run a company called SilverString Media.

16
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:50,930
We do narrative design and consulting and things and have over the last couple of years

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,994
been embarking on the location-based game journey, doing specifically location-based

18
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:56,774
games at events.

19
00:00:58,616 --> 00:01:03,099
And so we wanted to talk about how to tell stories in location-based games.

20
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:10,214
Again, there is an evaluation that we ask that you please fill out because it's very

21
00:01:10,294 --> 00:01:11,154
useful to all of us.

22
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:12,935
You know the deal if you've been to GDC before.

23
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:19,980
So with the explosion of Pokemon Go in this past year, it's brought location-based gaming

24
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,141
sort of into the limelight.

25
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,741
It hasn't started with Pokemon Go.

26
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:26,744
There's been sort of location-based gaming for decades.

27
00:01:27,424 --> 00:01:29,687
Everything from alternate reality games to,

28
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:32,289
we're seeing the explosion of escape rooms now too,

29
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:33,971
interactive theater.

30
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:36,113
There's all sorts of sort of interesting ways

31
00:01:36,153 --> 00:01:38,355
that you can create stories and gameplay

32
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,597
in real physical spaces.

33
00:01:41,607 --> 00:01:45,289
And when we talk about this, and it's anywhere from, you know, Pokemon Go, which is everywhere

34
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:52,191
in the world, to an escape room, which is a specific room, we have a very broad range

35
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:56,773
of types of experiences that we might want to talk about white mana tell stories in.

36
00:01:57,253 --> 00:01:58,974
And they're all...

37
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:05,677
use similar design ideas, storytelling functions,

38
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:07,618
stuff like that that are similar

39
00:02:07,658 --> 00:02:08,859
across all of these types of games,

40
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,120
though of course there are differences.

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,521
And really when we're looking at this range,

42
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,883
the question is how specific is the location?

43
00:02:15,924 --> 00:02:17,305
And that makes a big difference

44
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:19,146
in the kinds of experiences you can create.

45
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:20,407
So to discuss these stories,

46
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:21,968
we've brought together this awesome panel.

47
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:27,774
has joined me from a very wide variety of backgrounds and experiences, which is super

48
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:28,155
exciting.

49
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:33,161
Unfortunately, if you were looking at the website ahead of time or the paper thing,

50
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:37,426
Sarah Thatcher is unable to join us on the panel after all, but she is being replaced

51
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:39,188
by Jenny here, who is awesome.

52
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:46,236
And Sarah will be hopefully hanging out at the wrap up room after and or the meet up tonight

53
00:02:46,356 --> 00:02:47,897
So you can talk to her then as well

54
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,422
But let's just quickly go down the line to introduce our panel. Just

55
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:56,066
State name who you are and the kind of thing that you work on Jeff

56
00:02:56,535 --> 00:03:00,217
I'm Jeff McPherson. I'm the creative director and co-founder of Motive.io,

57
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:05,099
and it's a platform launching at GDC that makes it easy to build location AR games.

58
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:11,622
And that platform came about from our first location AR game, Code Runner, which was in 2011.

59
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:18,480
Steve Peters, I'm founder and CCO of No Mimes Media.

60
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,082
I've formerly done some work for Niantic last year, which you may have heard of them, a

61
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:24,102
little Pokemon Go thing.

62
00:03:24,742 --> 00:03:25,723
They continue to be a client.

63
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:31,125
I've been working mostly in the alternate reality gaming space, but also more recently

64
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:36,887
getting into a lot of the geolocation games in the last five years, augmented reality,

65
00:03:36,987 --> 00:03:37,568
that kind of stuff.

66
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:38,528
Really, whatever.

67
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:38,988
Thanks.

68
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:42,590
doing cool stuff in relation to locations.

69
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,631
That's kind of what we've always been doing.

70
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:47,232
My name is Jenny Godstein.

71
00:03:47,252 --> 00:03:48,712
I work for the Go game.

72
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,753
And we've been designing interactive adventure games

73
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:51,013
since 2001.

74
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:55,395
So our games then look a little different than what

75
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,195
they look like now.

76
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:59,336
We used to use pay phones and those Nokia brick phones.

77
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:01,277
And now we use all sorts of devices.

78
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:05,018
and we can turn buildings, neighborhoods, multiple cities

79
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:08,640
at once into epic games with actors

80
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,140
and interactive content,

81
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:13,561
and we run them all around the world.

82
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:15,622
So I design those games.

83
00:04:15,662 --> 00:04:18,243
I also manage our game design team

84
00:04:18,783 --> 00:04:21,084
and come up with new game concepts

85
00:04:21,164 --> 00:04:24,745
like the zombie apocalypse disaster preparedness games

86
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:28,887
and any number of applied play game types.

87
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:35,765
I'm Rob Morgan, I'm a writer and I am a co-founder and creative director of Playlines.

88
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:42,308
And we make interactive, site-specific, augmented reality theatre in AR.

89
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:48,551
Using location-based data to make site-specific installations that users walk around, usually

90
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:55,835
using a mix of smartphone audio and real-world actors to do immersive VR theatre experiences.

91
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,148
Awesome, so you can see a wide variety of experience

92
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:02,010
from lots of different kinds of games, which is super cool.

93
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,890
And one of the reasons that I wanted to keep this panel

94
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:05,551
sort of a bit more of a discussion

95
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:08,052
than little micro talks and stuff like that,

96
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:10,374
so we can try to get some interesting stuff,

97
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:11,734
interesting conversations going on.

98
00:05:12,535 --> 00:05:14,235
So to start that conversation,

99
00:05:14,255 --> 00:05:16,296
I think the most important question we have to look at

100
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:21,104
when we're talking about storytelling for real locations, is why.

101
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:23,368
Why do we do this?

102
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:27,035
Why do we take games from the computer screen out into the real world

103
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:28,998
where there are people looking at you?

104
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:39,510
Okay, so I have been talking about and trying to push location-based, specifically audio

105
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,653
AR for a long time, and that conversation suddenly got a lot easier about nine months

106
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:46,374
ago for some reason.

107
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:51,696
And then suddenly it was easy to give an obligatory Pokemon Go meets.

108
00:05:52,617 --> 00:05:58,219
description of what we were doing and the reason I've been pushing it for years when it we had to try and make it work

109
00:05:58,239 --> 00:06:03,741
With GPS which only sort of worked was that I just really love tweaking

110
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:09,203
Context and I really love the idea especially because the other half of my job is writing for VR

111
00:06:09,523 --> 00:06:13,905
I really love how easy it is to get users immersed in something where you don't

112
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:17,866
Work with opacity and replace the whole world with a virtual one

113
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:20,469
but instead you just add digital elements

114
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:21,890
to change people's relationships

115
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,291
with their actual environment.

116
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,193
And with their walk to the shops with Pokemon Go,

117
00:06:26,373 --> 00:06:28,375
or for us with like a specific venue,

118
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:31,598
you change people's perceptions of people around them.

119
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:33,700
And I really like how you can recruit in

120
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,062
elements of set dressing or even the other people

121
00:06:36,502 --> 00:06:38,704
in the scene without them even knowing,

122
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:40,986
but turn them into something that makes the user

123
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,107
feel like they're being watched,

124
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,349
or feel like they're being more self-conscious

125
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:46,310
than they would be otherwise.

126
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,472
So it's kind of like a newer form of context hacking.

127
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:51,874
That's what I really like about using real places.

128
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:53,195
Did you say context hacking?

129
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:53,615
Yes.

130
00:06:53,775 --> 00:06:54,235
That's cool.

131
00:06:55,976 --> 00:06:59,519
Like it's an art term from like the 90s I think.

132
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:00,880
But yeah, I'm bringing it back.

133
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:04,212
Yeah, it's like reality enhancement.

134
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:07,573
Really, when you're in the middle of a game like that,

135
00:07:08,113 --> 00:07:10,714
everything is brighter, because anything can happen

136
00:07:10,794 --> 00:07:13,415
and you're not sure what's a part of it, what isn't,

137
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:16,596
and I think that rush is as compelling

138
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:17,677
for the players as it is,

139
00:07:17,857 --> 00:07:19,257
and sorry if I'm putting words in your mouths,

140
00:07:19,277 --> 00:07:21,278
but I think it's as compelling for us, too,

141
00:07:22,298 --> 00:07:25,719
as one thing that we commented on,

142
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:29,320
it's fun when the game games the game designer.

143
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,181
Yeah, that never happens.

144
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:34,223
Apparently it only happens to me.

145
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:38,645
And no, but there's this sense of kind of lawlessness

146
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:40,907
where you're going out there with a design,

147
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,908
but you have no idea what's actually gonna happen.

148
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:45,249
There are so many factors.

149
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,131
And all of a sudden, as the designer,

150
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:49,272
you are also in a game.

151
00:07:49,612 --> 00:07:52,513
And I think that is maybe why we make ourselves,

152
00:07:53,654 --> 00:07:55,155
why we're a glutton for punishment,

153
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,196
why we decide to design real world games

154
00:07:57,256 --> 00:07:59,057
and not games that are a little more controllable.

155
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,259
It's kind of like jazz.

156
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:04,580
It's kind of like a call and response.

157
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,620
It's kind of like stand-up comedy in a lot of ways.

158
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,141
For me, the reason why is

159
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:11,141
in a lot of this stuff, almost every project

160
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:12,942
I've worked on, the goal has been

161
00:08:13,002 --> 00:08:14,903
to make the player feel

162
00:08:15,383 --> 00:08:17,063
like the story is taking

163
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:18,904
place in the actual world

164
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:19,844
that they live in.

165
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:24,428
as opposed to on a screen somewhere, whether it's in your hand or whether it's on your TV

166
00:08:24,888 --> 00:08:27,711
or something like that. And recently with technology that's become,

167
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:30,734
I won't say easier, but it's become more interesting

168
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:34,938
and the possibilities have expanded there. But I mean that's a win,

169
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:39,301
right, when we can turn the world around us into a play space. I'm a big

170
00:08:39,382 --> 00:08:41,624
advocate of, you know, public play.

171
00:08:42,344 --> 00:08:45,007
And this has always just been...

172
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:53,090
when you can be walking down the street and all of a sudden the game literally reaches out and grabs you,

173
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,632
whether it's a phone call, that's what got me into it, was my phone rang on the way to lunch one day in 2001

174
00:08:58,013 --> 00:09:03,856
and it was the beast alternate reality game calling me, literally, I wasn't expecting it,

175
00:09:03,996 --> 00:09:08,079
and I forgot about lunch, I ran back into my office, got online to see what was going on,

176
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:12,522
and I thought, they're onto something here, and the rest is history.

177
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:14,383
You know, it's like...

178
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:17,704
You know, it's so personal.

179
00:09:17,864 --> 00:09:20,385
It's, it just, it feels like such a personal experience.

180
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:23,666
I know a lot of you guys use audio in your games.

181
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:27,327
It's like being a part of a magic club.

182
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:31,588
Like each player has their own little secret.

183
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:33,808
With Pokemon, that was the first time that I ever felt like,

184
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:36,329
whoa, there's other humans here who are doing it too.

185
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:37,789
That was remarkable.

186
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:40,790
But prior to that, you've got this secret that is,

187
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:46,913
In our game you were a spy and you're hearing the voice of your handler constantly

188
00:09:47,314 --> 00:09:54,518
Feeding you information knowing what's going on around you similar like to I guess turn-by-turn GPS except this was this was be careful

189
00:09:54,538 --> 00:09:57,399
Make sure no one's watching there might be someone across the street that park

190
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,361
He was last seen at the park and you're like there is a there is a park

191
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:06,584
how did he know so that's comes from like you know pulling map data and GPS data and

192
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,993
And it's so uncontrolled, you have this factor that's so uncontrollable that your writing

193
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:16,796
has to be very careful, like a psychic cold reading is a very good technique, in that

194
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:20,639
you suggest something rather than laying down a fact that could be wrong that will break

195
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:22,961
the narrative and break the person out of it.

196
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:24,282
So you might see somebody.

197
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:25,403
You might see this.

198
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:26,103
You might see that.

199
00:10:26,223 --> 00:10:30,326
But one of the things we would do is you might see somebody going for a coffee.

200
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:33,068
That guy or that girl was last, you know.

201
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:40,033
scene handing off documents to a spy, but we know that you're by Starbucks. We don't mention that so that we're like, of course

202
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:40,753
There's people with coffee

203
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:45,436
Yeah, and you're rendering it in your head. So it's a very very personal experience

204
00:10:45,736 --> 00:10:49,359
Well, and you mentioned something else that's really interesting is is that social aspect?

205
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:56,143
I mean we all probably saw when Pokemon go came out whether or not you played it suddenly seeing people in the same space together

206
00:10:56,163 --> 00:11:00,106
I remember going down to the beach and like, you know, a couple teenagers walked by and said hey

207
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:02,347
There's a you know dragonite down there. It's like

208
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,208
Thanks, like running from me, right?

209
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:07,851
You know, it becomes this very social experience, right?

210
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:12,215
I will add that the one thing about the why is for me,

211
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:15,398
I'm seeing with the proliferation of things

212
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:16,979
like escape rooms and things like that,

213
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:19,301
I feel like the pendulum is starting to swing

214
00:11:19,341 --> 00:11:21,002
a little bit away from, you know,

215
00:11:21,143 --> 00:11:22,684
digital to more experiential.

216
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:24,546
You know, people wanna do things that they can,

217
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:26,547
you know, we've had, now we got this little computer

218
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:29,230
in our pocket and we can do cool, amazing things,

219
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:29,390
but...

220
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:35,034
We wanted, now folks are really kind of wanting to go organic and take that next step and

221
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:37,776
get out into the real world and doing things that are tangible.

222
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:42,379
So I think that's why escape rooms are getting so popular, that's why GoGaming continues

223
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,860
to go strong after all these years.

224
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:45,682
And that's what's really exciting.

225
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:50,065
You know, I've got great stories about, you know, the literal walking down the street

226
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:53,808
and something happens to you out of the blue and you're like all of a sudden you're a superhero

227
00:11:53,868 --> 00:11:55,269
in a game or you're a spy.

228
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:56,670
That's awesome.

229
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,350
That's awesome.

230
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,952
There is another factor here, which is that reality is cheap and plentiful.

231
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:04,633
And it has great resolution.

232
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:05,893
It has great graphics!

233
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:07,954
And it rarely glitches out.

234
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:12,616
And that means that, like, if you can just manipulate the player's imagination...

235
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:17,519
Like Jeff was saying, the player fills in the blanks and can start telling themselves

236
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,600
a story if you just give them the right kind of cues.

237
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,023
And then they're telling themselves an incredibly vivid story that you didn't have to simulate

238
00:12:24,183 --> 00:12:26,084
or pay for or virtualize.

239
00:12:26,384 --> 00:12:30,207
And you're tapping into, there's emotional baggage or there's memories, especially when

240
00:12:30,247 --> 00:12:33,929
it's in someone's own neighborhood that you get to ride for free on.

241
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:37,091
Like, you know, instead of, you know, when they pay a million bucks for a Beatles song

242
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:37,712
in a soundtrack.

243
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:42,654
It's not because it's a million dollar song, it's because they're trying to tap into all

244
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,975
of that nostalgia that this audience has.

245
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:49,276
And you kind of get that for free.

246
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:53,898
You have someone saying, wow, at that swing set that my dad taught me at, a beast came

247
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:56,839
up and I taunted him with, yeah.

248
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:02,301
So we're talking about storytelling in these kinds of games, and we're looking at Pokemon

249
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:03,402
Go and escape rooms and stuff.

250
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,823
Does Pokemon Go have a story?

251
00:13:06,837 --> 00:13:09,859
You know, light story, like, it's about a light game mechanic, right?

252
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,402
You're a trainer and the story is you're collecting Pokémon.

253
00:13:13,522 --> 00:13:15,324
I mean, that's pretty much it, right?

254
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:15,824
Unless there's...

255
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:18,486
Can I poll the audience? I'm really curious about that.

256
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:18,867
We should wait.

257
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:21,549
Yeah, sure. Put up your hand if you think Pokémon Go has a story.

258
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:24,511
Controversial.

259
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:26,293
Not a lot. Not a lot.

260
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,317
I would say it makes you tell yourself a story.

261
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:32,059
And that's the really powerful thing that it does.

262
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,920
And that story can be as in-depth as you like,

263
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,422
and you can engage with it at the level that you want.

264
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:39,643
But also, the story that it gets you telling yourself

265
00:13:39,683 --> 00:13:41,904
is not incompatible with your immediate reality.

266
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:42,545
And so like.

267
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:45,996
It makes you, if it can make you take the long road

268
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:48,179
to the shops, even though you only want a loaf of bread,

269
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,803
then it's doing that for emotional reasons

270
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:52,846
because of competition or game design

271
00:13:52,886 --> 00:13:55,109
or something that it's making you do for an emotional reason

272
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,813
that makes your interaction with the real world

273
00:13:57,853 --> 00:13:59,095
less optimal but more fun.

274
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:01,678
At that point, I think that's a narrative of some kind.

275
00:14:01,698 --> 00:14:01,938
Totally.

276
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:05,904
When I saw Sarah in the back put her hand up to that question, I know a point that she

277
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:10,890
had made is that these kinds of stories are experiential.

278
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,916
These are the stories of you, the player, and your experience in this space.

279
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:21,721
isn't always, though often has some element of true authored narrative,

280
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:26,064
but it isn't always about that, but it still has that sort of experiential story

281
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:30,848
that I think is really key in bringing in that emotional response,

282
00:14:30,948 --> 00:14:31,968
as you guys were talking about.

283
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:34,630
And then also don't forget the story that happens between.

284
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,493
So often, you can play with friends or new friends,

285
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:40,674
and you create your own story.

286
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:44,757
And there are moments where you reflect on,

287
00:14:44,897 --> 00:14:46,718
oh, remember that one time where we did that thing?

288
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:48,820
And so you're building your story in real time

289
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,241
with the help of the game.

290
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,103
So I think there's multiple storylines

291
00:14:53,843 --> 00:14:55,845
to take into consideration and to really celebrate

292
00:14:55,865 --> 00:14:59,227
and kind of fan the flames, not knowing where it may go.

293
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:03,696
So one of the things, the big major design challenge,

294
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,977
the first sort of design challenge

295
00:15:04,997 --> 00:15:05,758
that you have to think about

296
00:15:05,798 --> 00:15:07,880
when doing a location-based game, I think,

297
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,822
is how do you motivate someone

298
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,584
to actually get up and go outside?

299
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,490
Oh, yeah.

300
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,791
So it varies on the context of the game.

301
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,012
So if it's a group activity that everyone has opted into,

302
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:25,733
you don't need to motivate.

303
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:28,914
I mean, everyone has created this social contract,

304
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:30,274
so they're self-motivated.

305
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:34,115
If you are trying to pull people out of their day-to-day

306
00:15:34,175 --> 00:15:36,356
and draw them into the game, you have

307
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:37,896
to use different mechanics to do that.

308
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:40,937
So I think the first question you ask yourself is,

309
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:45,020
is this like a ready-made experience,

310
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:46,641
or as part of the game,

311
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:50,243
am I also recruiting people to buy in?

312
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:53,885
And that requires different nuance

313
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:56,587
in how the narrative gets rolled out,

314
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:57,347
if there is a narrative.

315
00:15:57,978 --> 00:16:01,502
Well, even with something like an escape room where there's that, you know, you have already

316
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:06,748
sort of bought into this experience, I think there's still even that extra level of, now

317
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:09,250
you're in the room, but we need to actually make you care.

318
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,854
I mean, presumably you want to be there, but there's still that extra, especially if you're

319
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:14,236
trying to do any kind of storyline, right?

320
00:16:14,296 --> 00:16:14,877
I would say that...

321
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,239
Yeah, that's the key, is you're there,

322
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,681
when you're there anyway, we wanna make you care.

323
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:22,382
And I think with the question of

324
00:16:22,462 --> 00:16:25,124
how do you get people outside is a huge issue,

325
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:28,567
because, right, it's the balance of the reward.

326
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:31,229
Is it worth it for me to get up off my couch

327
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:32,470
and go outside to do this thing,

328
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,291
as opposed to I just wanna be able to do it here.

329
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,913
And lots of stories from Pokemon Go of people realizing,

330
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:39,175
wait, I gotta go do this?

331
00:16:39,395 --> 00:16:41,136
My avatar's not moving, how do I do this?

332
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:44,660
So I mean there's two ways to look at it, and to me it's a balance.

333
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,564
It's like one, there's gameplay that's casual when you're out and about anyway, right?

334
00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:52,229
Oh, I'm at the bank, or I'm at the diner, let's see if there's any Pokemon around here.

335
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:55,713
And then, as you get deeper and deeper into it, and then as you get more into the game

336
00:16:55,753 --> 00:16:59,757
and it kind of hooks you, then you will purpose yourself to go out and then you will find

337
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:00,138
yourself.

338
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:01,900
Pokemon Go is a textbook example of this.

339
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,625
lightning in a bottle, right? It's like, now it's a social phenomenon. Now I'm gonna go out and we're gonna play with friends.

340
00:17:07,045 --> 00:17:10,569
But it was that initial of, I'm gonna go out and play, and sure there were people that

341
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:17,396
immediately went outside, but the whole point is it's this kind of, you got to have both, and Pokemon had the IP advantage.

342
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:22,239
the nostalgia of that. A lot of things came into fact, you know, factory, the AR thing

343
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:25,741
and sharing it on social media. People saw Pokemon on the kitchen counter and wonder,

344
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:30,484
how do I do that? And they download, they download the app and, and they initially play

345
00:17:30,504 --> 00:17:33,826
it as they're out and about. But, and then as they got deeper into the game and enjoyed

346
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:38,708
it, then they started to want to go out and do it. So it's this, it's this checks and

347
00:17:38,728 --> 00:17:39,629
balance between those two.

348
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:42,991
And that built-in screen grab, being able to take a picture, I think was just marketing genius.

349
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:43,231
Really?

350
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:43,611
Yeah.

351
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:45,352
You saw the image and you got it right away.

352
00:17:45,372 --> 00:17:48,233
Because they didn't do a lot of traditional marketing.

353
00:17:48,874 --> 00:17:50,254
It was almost solely social media.

354
00:17:50,414 --> 00:17:55,277
It really went viral and it was those AR screenshots that caught on.

355
00:17:55,397 --> 00:17:56,477
Magic carp in the frying pan.

356
00:17:56,818 --> 00:17:56,978
Yeah.

357
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:09,402
Because we do site-specific stuff, I think we have a different experience of this, because a lot of what we do is do a fictional lair or a game lair that takes place within a conference or takes place within a festival.

358
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:19,186
And so a lot of the time we actually design our experiences to make our existing players, the people who are already on the experience, the best advert for the experience for everybody else.

359
00:18:19,586 --> 00:18:23,007
Because 5%, 10% of the attendees will be playing it at any given time.

360
00:18:23,327 --> 00:18:25,328
but our players are walking around with headphones on.

361
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:27,708
And we're also, in the course of the story we're telling them,

362
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:31,349
getting them to do slightly weird things that make them stand out a little bit,

363
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:33,550
making them feel natural about doing the weird thing,

364
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,590
and that it makes sense to them in the context of the story.

365
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:37,291
But other people walking past are like,

366
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:39,411
those guys know something that we don't,

367
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:41,072
and that's really interesting.

368
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:42,072
Then they get motivated.

369
00:18:42,092 --> 00:18:46,333
So we create like VIP areas that you can only get to if you know the password,

370
00:18:46,353 --> 00:18:49,094
and you only know the password if you get to the end of the story in the audio.

371
00:18:49,454 --> 00:18:51,616
And so people walk past at a technology festival

372
00:18:51,636 --> 00:18:53,057
and there's a bouncer and a velvet rope

373
00:18:53,117 --> 00:18:54,198
and they don't know what's going on.

374
00:18:54,338 --> 00:18:57,100
And the only way to get in on it is to run our experience.

375
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:59,623
That works really well in terms of pushing people

376
00:18:59,943 --> 00:19:01,364
back into our experiences.

377
00:19:01,464 --> 00:19:03,766
But it only works because we're site-specific.

378
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:05,828
Well, and I want to get into sort of, you know,

379
00:19:05,848 --> 00:19:09,070
a lot of the specifics, narrative best practices and stuff.

380
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,512
But one of the other sort of major concerns

381
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:13,274
that you have to think about even up front,

382
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:17,156
is this, now that we're in the physical world,

383
00:19:17,836 --> 00:19:19,677
what kinds of things do we need to think about

384
00:19:19,737 --> 00:19:21,078
that we wouldn't need to think about

385
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,779
if we're just making a mobile game

386
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:25,161
or we're just making a computer game or something?

387
00:19:25,401 --> 00:19:28,943
And I'm gonna bring up Maslow's hierarchy of needs here,

388
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,344
which was another tip from Sarah.

389
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:34,186
But so in most games,

390
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:37,649
we don't need to worry about the bottom of that pyramid,

391
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:42,314
which are like the base needs of being human.

392
00:19:42,754 --> 00:19:44,276
You know, you're sitting at your computer,

393
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:45,076
you're gonna be safe.

394
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:46,638
If you need to pause and go to the bathroom,

395
00:19:46,678 --> 00:19:47,559
you can do that.

396
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,040
But in a physical space,

397
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:51,743
suddenly you need to think about these other questions.

398
00:19:52,564 --> 00:19:54,886
Yeah, I can say, well, we really encountered that

399
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:55,567
in terms of,

400
00:19:58,678 --> 00:20:02,540
As we were developing our first location AR game, uh, the

401
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,520
assumption that this is gonna be a physical space, we'll make

402
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,241
it the lock and key, uh, mechanic of, you're gonna go

403
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:10,162
here, you're gonna go to a bank, ah, you were a hacker, much like

404
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:14,383
watchdogs, but location based and before watchdogs. And, and

405
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:15,643
you're like, I can't get into the bank, you don't have the

406
00:20:15,663 --> 00:20:18,424
code. Oh, I remember, I'm gonna go now over to this location,

407
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:21,685
the Starbucks, I'm gonna run my little hacking mini game and I'm

408
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:24,266
gonna get the key. And I'm gonna go back. And on, on the moment

409
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,966
we tested it, we were in big trouble.

410
00:20:26,783 --> 00:20:28,144
because there's nothing, you know,

411
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:29,205
when you're playing a point and click,

412
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:31,247
kinda like, oh, that's the lock,

413
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:32,528
I remember the key's over here, click.

414
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:37,206
or navigate with your controller, that's not a lot of effort.

415
00:20:37,706 --> 00:20:40,528
When you've walked two blocks with no game play,

416
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:43,550
and you stop, and you're like, go turn around and go back,

417
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,952
and you're like, you would not believe how awful that is

418
00:20:46,032 --> 00:20:46,652
as an experience.

419
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,493
Just even when you forget your keys and you're embarrassed,

420
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:50,655
and you don't want anyone to notice

421
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:52,916
that you're turning around, nobody cares what you're doing.

422
00:20:53,537 --> 00:20:54,738
But then imagine that you've kind of got

423
00:20:54,758 --> 00:20:57,199
this narrative going on, and it was a deal breaker.

424
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,461
And it was like, oh, that was our assumption.

425
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:05,029
Yeah, no, and that's something that we bake into all of our games, that travel has to

426
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:07,611
be less than a fourth of the experience.

427
00:21:08,071 --> 00:21:13,654
And if you travel to get from point A to point B, and if you have to make people travel,

428
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:17,156
you have to fill that time with something that will keep them alight.

429
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:21,179
Whether it be I-Spy missions that they're using the physical environment to find things,

430
00:21:21,219 --> 00:21:22,640
so they're looking up and out.

431
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,922
or something that they're discussing and negotiating

432
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:26,964
amongst their team, or something that they're

433
00:21:27,304 --> 00:21:29,947
doing to prepare for the mission that's ahead.

434
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:34,352
And then the other piece of just very boring, logistical,

435
00:21:34,512 --> 00:21:36,334
location-based game stuff, we always,

436
00:21:36,774 --> 00:21:39,798
when the players are opting in and we can touch them

437
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:43,121
before the game, so we're not just pulling them in

438
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:43,842
and they start playing.

439
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:47,143
we always send out something that primes them

440
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:50,005
for dressing comfortably and weather appropriately

441
00:21:50,145 --> 00:21:53,686
because if you are uncomfortable, you will have less fun.

442
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:55,307
That's directly related.

443
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:59,208
So we try to get people without spoiling the surprise

444
00:21:59,268 --> 00:22:01,129
and it takes different shapes depending on the game,

445
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:02,590
how you communicate that information.

446
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,510
We try to do it as cheeky as possible,

447
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:08,412
but you have to make sure your audience is ready

448
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,233
physically and emotionally and spiritually

449
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:13,854
for the task ahead or else they're gonna opt out.

450
00:22:14,787 --> 00:22:19,133
I'd say from my perspective, you just got to really be careful with the whole win state,

451
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:19,613
fail state.

452
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:23,919
Going off of what you were saying, I mean, yeah, if you show up and it's like, crap,

453
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:25,061
I forgot that key, now I got to walk back two blocks.

454
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:26,102
You know, that's terrible.

455
00:22:26,122 --> 00:22:26,343
You got to...

456
00:22:26,363 --> 00:22:26,603
You got to...

457
00:22:26,643 --> 00:22:26,864
You got to...

458
00:22:26,884 --> 00:22:27,324
You got to...

459
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:27,645
You got to...

460
00:22:27,685 --> 00:22:28,125
You got to...

461
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:28,386
You got to...

462
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:28,646
You got to...

463
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:29,027
You got to...

464
00:22:29,487 --> 00:22:29,687
You got to...

465
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:29,928
You got to...

466
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:30,148
You got to...

467
00:22:30,168 --> 00:22:30,368
You got to...

468
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:30,849
You got to...

469
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:33,831
there's gotta be an alternative right it's like okay well maybe I forgot that

470
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:36,313
but now there's another way I can do without having to retrace my steps

471
00:22:36,653 --> 00:22:39,315
right maybe there's another mini game that's or it makes whatever I had to do

472
00:22:39,355 --> 00:22:43,118
a little bit more difficult but I still I don't have to like go back or there's

473
00:22:43,178 --> 00:22:45,419
no there's no you can't you can't die in

474
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:47,401
these games you know that's that's that yeah

475
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:51,123
that's the whole issue too it's like well it's not like a typical I'm playing

476
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:54,166
Fallout and great now I died and I just go back to the last save point

477
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,366
there are no save points

478
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:57,428
There's no spotting.

479
00:22:57,728 --> 00:22:57,928
Yes.

480
00:22:57,968 --> 00:22:58,188
Yes.

481
00:22:58,468 --> 00:22:58,708
Yes.

482
00:22:58,948 --> 00:22:59,829
Well, yeah.

483
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:00,589
That'd be cool.

484
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,830
So, although, yeah.

485
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,912
Well, and I think, you know, looking at the hierarchy of needs, I think that might be

486
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:10,314
why most escape rooms are, you know, around an hour in length, because otherwise you need

487
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:12,175
to think about the need to go to the washroom.

488
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:17,940
Well, I was going to say, we actually often our experiences take people into the bathroom

489
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,505
of wherever the venue is because that's, it's nice to kind of go into a space and you don't

490
00:23:23,565 --> 00:23:28,169
normally get told a story in there, but we can have a virtual lair that happens in there

491
00:23:28,229 --> 00:23:29,150
and like we've done that.

492
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,952
What kind of stories are you telling in there?

493
00:23:31,092 --> 00:23:34,895
We've had them that like you get taken in for a sexual encounter or like someone goes

494
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,198
in and then they're like, this is the kind of the moment in the story where a character

495
00:23:38,238 --> 00:23:39,880
breaks down and you listen to them kind of.

496
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,321
confessing something or being very upset.

497
00:23:42,361 --> 00:23:43,322
And then they use the restroom?

498
00:23:43,582 --> 00:23:45,283
Well, this is the thing, like, originally it was kind of,

499
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:46,524
should we build in a bathroom break?

500
00:23:46,544 --> 00:23:47,965
Because the player is walking past,

501
00:23:47,985 --> 00:23:49,826
and if they go in, then they'll go off story.

502
00:23:50,206 --> 00:23:51,327
So we build it in for that reason.

503
00:23:51,387 --> 00:23:53,528
But it ended up being a really intimate

504
00:23:53,588 --> 00:23:55,610
and intense experience for people standing in the bathroom,

505
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,531
listening to the, that was when we'd do

506
00:23:57,571 --> 00:23:59,832
the most intense moments in the story.

507
00:24:00,012 --> 00:24:00,433
Or sitting.

508
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:01,373
Right, yeah.

509
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,390
But that's the ideal, is if the player is kind of there

510
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,552
in a private space or they're staring at themselves

511
00:24:07,592 --> 00:24:09,073
in the mirror, that's an enhancement.

512
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,675
And also, yeah, it's an opportunity to actually create

513
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:14,637
the possibility of the player not having to abandon

514
00:24:14,657 --> 00:24:16,178
the experience partway through to go to the bathroom.

515
00:24:16,218 --> 00:24:16,759
It's built in.

516
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:18,600
Right, well then that leads really well

517
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,202
into sort of the next point that I wanted to make is,

518
00:24:20,382 --> 00:24:23,264
okay, so we're choosing to tell stories in the real world

519
00:24:24,265 --> 00:24:25,606
using the real environment.

520
00:24:26,026 --> 00:24:27,848
So how do we do that?

521
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:30,089
How do we use the environment to enhance

522
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:31,590
the stories that we're telling?

523
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:33,652
I mean, the bathroom's a perfect example.

524
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:36,795
Yeah, sometimes I think it's an accident first,

525
00:24:36,915 --> 00:24:38,156
and then you're like, oh, you can

526
00:24:38,236 --> 00:24:39,297
use the environment that way.

527
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:42,420
So this one game that we have, it's

528
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,163
an espionage training game.

529
00:24:45,423 --> 00:24:46,925
So in the course of the game, the players

530
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:48,686
are learning how to become world class spies,

531
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:52,650
a la 007 Madhahari, Archer, et cetera.

532
00:24:55,058 --> 00:24:58,119
In the beginning of the game, we give them a couple of things that they need to keep,

533
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,380
be aware of.

534
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,781
And one, we say, all right, well, there's someone out in the field who's trailing you.

535
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:08,044
And if they capture you on film, and if we see that film, meaning the actor sends it

536
00:25:08,064 --> 00:25:11,005
to us, then we will dock your team X amount of points.

537
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:11,305
So like...

538
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:12,766
Watch your back.

539
00:25:13,026 --> 00:25:15,328
You know, like, it creates the look over the shoulder function.

540
00:25:15,869 --> 00:25:20,793
And I ran this one game in Santa Monica and I forgot to hire that actor.

541
00:25:20,813 --> 00:25:22,614
Like, I just spaced.

542
00:25:22,975 --> 00:25:24,116
There was other things going on.

543
00:25:24,496 --> 00:25:25,237
Didn't hire that actor.

544
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:28,159
So there was nobody walking around taking pictures of the teams, but they still got

545
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:28,659
that thing.

546
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,821
But it's in Santa Monica and there are tourists.

547
00:25:31,402 --> 00:25:36,807
everywhere. So every time a tourist would take a photo, the whole team would hit the deck.

548
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:40,531
And so we realized, actually, you know what, you don't have to hire an actor

549
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:44,775
if you just put it in a well-trafficked area where people are snapping away.

550
00:25:44,795 --> 00:25:45,856
I want to play that game. It's cool.

551
00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:50,380
Yeah, so like the environment will leap out at you sometimes when you least expect it.

552
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,624
Espionage is a great genre for location-based as well, I've noticed.

553
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:57,708
And one of the nice things about that is just that it doesn't conflict with reality, right?

554
00:25:57,748 --> 00:25:58,509
When you're a spy.

555
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:00,992
And the stakes are so high in espionage drama, right?

556
00:26:01,012 --> 00:26:06,358
There's one or two people that are playing out basically superpowers at war.

557
00:26:07,037 --> 00:26:09,238
And Paranoia is very easy, well I wouldn't say easy,

558
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,220
yeah, why not, it's easy to create in a location-based game

559
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,661
when you're a good writer like you guys are.

560
00:26:13,861 --> 00:26:15,902
Yeah, I tend to start all of our experiences

561
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:17,583
with something like, are they still watching?

562
00:26:17,824 --> 00:26:19,705
Or like something that kind of doesn't give you

563
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:22,727
a lot of story, but it puts the player in a heightened state

564
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:24,868
and makes them more aware, and yeah, after a while

565
00:26:24,888 --> 00:26:27,290
you don't need the actor there,

566
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,091
like that's such a cool story, it's a great example.

567
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:32,073
Learn from my mistakes.

568
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:34,234
Well, and it's easy to do...

569
00:26:35,155 --> 00:26:39,017
It's easier, perhaps, to use the environment in the specific story

570
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,159
when you know what exactly the environment is.

571
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,600
You're doing something where you know

572
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,982
that there's a bathroom literally right there on the route.

573
00:26:45,302 --> 00:26:46,803
Our tech director, Dustin, is here,

574
00:26:46,863 --> 00:26:48,384
and he had a great phrase that what we do

575
00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:50,545
is often like reverse level design

576
00:26:50,745 --> 00:26:51,806
in that we'll often...

577
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:54,068
we kind of have to go to a venue beforehand.

578
00:26:54,408 --> 00:26:56,810
and walk around or take a GoPro and walk around

579
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,431
and then kind of see what story emerges from the space,

580
00:26:59,872 --> 00:27:02,253
which sounds very kind of wishy-washy,

581
00:27:02,313 --> 00:27:03,994
but really it's the best way to go,

582
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:06,016
oh, there's a phone booth there and it's out of use,

583
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:07,137
but we can definitely use that

584
00:27:07,177 --> 00:27:08,257
and drive the player that way.

585
00:27:08,317 --> 00:27:10,679
And what are the natural geographical forks

586
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:13,081
in this environment to create an interactive decision

587
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:14,321
where you go this way or that way?

588
00:27:14,862 --> 00:27:16,783
But that's an opportunity that we have

589
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,724
that if you're doing like map API stuff,

590
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:19,785
you can't necessarily do.

591
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,663
Yeah, I'd say, I mean, for the stuff I've done, it's been mostly site-specific.

592
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:26,965
We, you know, most of the stuff for alternate reality games or whatever it's been like.

593
00:27:27,305 --> 00:27:32,949
And there's always going out to scout the location and immersing yourself there and seeing what the location has to offer.

594
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,771
Sometimes you'll have to do it remotely.

595
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:39,814
I've gotten really, really good at Google Earth and different other tools at your disposal,

596
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:42,796
but there's nothing beats actually being, you know, boots on the ground.

597
00:27:43,377 --> 00:27:45,279
to see what's there and also to talk to people.

598
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:48,863
And really, opportunities present themselves

599
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:51,765
that you never would have been able to research ahead of time.

600
00:27:51,926 --> 00:27:56,150
But then, making something that has to be a little bit not site-specific.

601
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,191
That's interesting.

602
00:27:57,231 --> 00:27:59,453
I always thought that having that kind of...

603
00:28:00,334 --> 00:28:07,604
Controlled environment knowing where the environment that it's going to take place in was going to solve all our problems until I met you guys

604
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:13,472
Realize you guys have a lot of the same problem and brand new problems and a whole brand new problems

605
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,955
Whereas what we were doing is yeah our games

606
00:28:17,377 --> 00:28:19,698
Well, it was adapting to wherever you were in the world.

607
00:28:19,758 --> 00:28:23,321
And so we had a system set up where the writer would decide,

608
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,763
OK, well, this is sort of about a crooked cop who's

609
00:28:26,103 --> 00:28:26,803
laundering money.

610
00:28:27,244 --> 00:28:28,865
So I'm going to have a first choice, second choice, third

611
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:33,028
choice, fifth choice in terms of what's in the vicinity

612
00:28:33,068 --> 00:28:34,909
within, say, a 200-meter radius.

613
00:28:35,369 --> 00:28:36,790
Is there a police station?

614
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,772
Then I'm going to call that number one, bump that to the

615
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:41,994
top, and it will call up audio specific to that.

616
00:28:42,674 --> 00:28:43,475
It's not really a branch.

617
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:45,036
It's just adapting.

618
00:28:45,076 --> 00:28:45,877
I'll say that the

619
00:28:46,677 --> 00:28:50,999
the cops got a, he's laundering money and he's got a stash there, go break into the

620
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:56,361
system of the police station. Not a lot of police stations around, not a lot of hospitals

621
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:00,583
around. You know, the A list of the locations that I would like, you know, to push to that

622
00:29:00,643 --> 00:29:06,246
player in real time. So then we go down, we go down to, okay, is there a pool hall? Is

623
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:11,068
there, you know, things that are traditionally associated with, you know,

624
00:29:12,857 --> 00:29:17,240
Shadier activities. I'm sure there's some very classy pool halls. Arcades used to be classy.

625
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:23,505
And it goes down the list and we're like, okay, a bank. Okay, then maybe a church. And then we're like,

626
00:29:23,785 --> 00:29:26,867
I don't really want people going to a church and then hearing audio saying there's a crooked cop

627
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:28,268
that works at that church. We'll mix that.

628
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,752
But what it does, what that approach does, which is, it's very exciting, you know, as

629
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:39,255
a writer and a developer, is that you kind of have this magic level designer, which is

630
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:44,538
the world, which is tinkering with your levels, and you can fire up your game and play that

631
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:46,199
mission and go, wow, like.

632
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,360
It's unbelievable. He's running a racket.

633
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:53,002
You know, he's, he's, this cop runs a money laundering out of a laundry, that's number one,

634
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:56,583
and then a car wash, and he funnels the money from here to there.

635
00:29:57,024 --> 00:29:59,545
And now, what's interesting is that it was a very niche game, right?

636
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:04,547
And we're actually saying, we're suggesting that there's criminal activity happening at real locations.

637
00:30:05,827 --> 00:30:08,988
As, you know, Pokemon has brought this really to the mainstream,

638
00:30:09,028 --> 00:30:11,089
it's now there's another responsibility we have to take is,

639
00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:13,530
although it feels cool for the player,

640
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:21,643
We are kind of casting a narrative on top of a business that's not opted into it.

641
00:30:22,622 --> 00:30:25,463
And we're going to touch on those ethical issues and stuff in a sec, but you wanted

642
00:30:25,483 --> 00:30:25,964
to add something.

643
00:30:25,984 --> 00:30:30,505
Yeah, I wanted to add, just keep in mind though, I mean we're talking mostly like GPS location.

644
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:34,787
Remember there's a lot of different sensors in the phone they can also use in the location.

645
00:30:34,807 --> 00:30:40,169
I mean, what if it's not just, oh there's a park nearby, but oh, taking into account

646
00:30:40,249 --> 00:30:45,131
the time of day, or the temperature of where you are, you know, what if some Pokemon only

647
00:30:45,151 --> 00:30:47,012
showed up when the temperature was like below 40 degrees?

648
00:30:48,072 --> 00:30:52,114
Or, you know, if you're up a certain elevation, or if it's a really quiet environment or a

649
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:53,174
really loud environment.

650
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:57,836
I mean, there's all sorts of other cues from the location that you can then gather and

651
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,857
bring into your game to affect the gameplay.

652
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:01,357
And you know, it can sense.

653
00:31:01,397 --> 00:31:05,619
I mean, even with a narrative, how awesome would it be to know the narrative knows that

654
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:06,800
it's starting to drizzle.

655
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:06,980
Yeah.

656
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,384
You know, it's starting to rain and yeah, during the rain, I mean that's,

657
00:31:10,424 --> 00:31:13,168
even from one of the ARGs we did back in the day,

658
00:31:13,308 --> 00:31:17,734
we had a blogger girl who was talking about driving up into the mountains outside of Portland

659
00:31:18,315 --> 00:31:19,957
to go do this thing, get the MacGuffin,

660
00:31:20,598 --> 00:31:24,243
and she mentions in it that she's a little worried because it's starting to snow outside.

661
00:31:24,563 --> 00:31:27,688
and one of our players from Portland says as he read that he looked outside

662
00:31:28,008 --> 00:31:31,453
and it was starting to snow because we wrote that in real time based on the

663
00:31:31,493 --> 00:31:33,096
weather information we had

664
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:36,761
and was just those little touches that again make it feel like this story is

665
00:31:36,921 --> 00:31:37,762
really going on

666
00:31:38,223 --> 00:31:39,685
in the actual world that I live in.

667
00:31:40,045 --> 00:31:41,526
And you can tap into, you know, there's APIs,

668
00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:43,407
there's data coming from Dark Sky.

669
00:31:43,427 --> 00:31:46,868
And so hyper local weather.

670
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:49,750
And not to pitch my own company,

671
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,570
but we can provide that for you.

672
00:31:51,871 --> 00:31:52,271
I like it.

673
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:53,051
Oh, no.

674
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:56,693
Well, I think as these games become more pervasive,

675
00:31:56,773 --> 00:31:59,334
as we have more players out in the world playing actively,

676
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:03,116
I think the next frontier is using one game

677
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:05,036
as the environment for another game.

678
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:07,317
And one thing, one experience that I had,

679
00:32:07,337 --> 00:32:09,358
I was walking up a hill in San Francisco.

680
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,381
at the height of everyone on their phones, Pokemon Go,

681
00:32:13,962 --> 00:32:15,983
and I was the only one going up the hill,

682
00:32:16,003 --> 00:32:18,285
and I could see people come down the hill,

683
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:19,626
and they were coming in waves, right?

684
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,928
They were with their friends on Pokemon,

685
00:32:21,988 --> 00:32:25,231
you know, like, heads down, like, using their phone,

686
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:26,992
and they were coming at me, and all of a sudden,

687
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:28,553
it was like, oh, shit, I'm an asteroid.

688
00:32:28,593 --> 00:32:32,436
It's like, you know, kind of upstream, salmon swimming,

689
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:34,578
the Pokemon players, and it became my game,

690
00:32:34,658 --> 00:32:36,900
and so I think finding ways to,

691
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:40,341
you know, it's like tides, right?

692
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:41,562
You know, it creates these eddies

693
00:32:41,602 --> 00:32:43,022
that you wouldn't have anticipated.

694
00:32:43,423 --> 00:32:46,464
So how can we really play with those eddies

695
00:32:46,584 --> 00:32:49,785
that happen naturally or through game design?

696
00:32:49,925 --> 00:32:52,846
I think social attunement and like attenuation

697
00:32:53,006 --> 00:32:55,728
is one of the easiest things to manipulate in people.

698
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:58,369
And it creates the most immediate effects

699
00:32:58,449 --> 00:33:00,249
in the same way that like saying to you,

700
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:01,770
you know, if we were gonna make everybody

701
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,911
go around the room and turn and shake everybody's hand.

702
00:33:04,391 --> 00:33:05,672
who's sitting next to all of you.

703
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:07,333
That would make the situation really awkward

704
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:09,095
and then it would completely change your relationship

705
00:33:09,135 --> 00:33:10,315
with your immediate context.

706
00:33:10,736 --> 00:33:12,657
And that's something that I wanna do more and more

707
00:33:12,697 --> 00:33:14,218
with our games, like a data set

708
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,479
that we can scrape off the phone

709
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,301
is how many other people are playing the game nearby

710
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:20,323
within a radius of 10 meters.

711
00:33:20,663 --> 00:33:23,824
At that point we can start generating impromptu flash mobs,

712
00:33:24,244 --> 00:33:28,606
because the most significant part of the set dressing

713
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:30,027
is the presence of other people,

714
00:33:30,107 --> 00:33:32,208
because humans are really, really attenuated

715
00:33:32,248 --> 00:33:33,269
to the presence of other people,

716
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:35,409
and whether they're watching and what they're doing,

717
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:37,290
whether they're watching me and am I being weird.

718
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,691
If you can get the player thinking about that stuff,

719
00:33:39,711 --> 00:33:41,992
then you can put them in a really interesting predicament,

720
00:33:42,152 --> 00:33:43,733
and then that enhances your story.

721
00:33:44,013 --> 00:33:45,414
Or, yeah, you can play a game that...

722
00:33:45,874 --> 00:33:49,784
takes place in your context that other people were not even aware of,

723
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,711
but they're enhancing your experience of the real world, that's a really cool one.

724
00:33:53,512 --> 00:33:55,434
So obviously we can talk about this stuff all day,

725
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:57,036
and we have for the last couple days.

726
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:59,758
So please join us later to continue the conversation.

727
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:01,480
But I do want to touch on, while we're still

728
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,381
on narrative best practices, the use of audio,

729
00:34:03,401 --> 00:34:04,803
because that's come up a couple times.

730
00:34:04,883 --> 00:34:07,505
And I know a lot of what several of us

731
00:34:07,585 --> 00:34:09,287
have used for telling the story.

732
00:34:09,307 --> 00:34:10,648
And this comes to the question of,

733
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,530
do you want to create a game where

734
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,752
your players are doing this as they're walking

735
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:15,673
through this environment?

736
00:34:16,494 --> 00:34:17,675
We're using the environment.

737
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:23,111
to help tell the story, we want to make sure that the player is engaging with it. So I

738
00:34:23,151 --> 00:34:24,831
know, I mean, you do that a lot with Motive.

739
00:34:25,151 --> 00:34:29,532
Yeah, we have a best practice, we have a warning, we call it the desk bias or the desktop bias,

740
00:34:30,092 --> 00:34:33,733
which is you're inevitably going to be developing this sitting at your desk and you're looking

741
00:34:33,753 --> 00:34:37,593
at that screen and you're going to want to iterate on it to make it prettier and prettier

742
00:34:37,613 --> 00:34:44,075
and prettier and the end result can be that. You've got a player, you've designed a lot

743
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,735
of visual cues that's staring at their phone and there's just.

744
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:50,111
It just takes away from the whole experience.

745
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:51,913
And it's frustrating.

746
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:54,756
I remember testing when that rain is hitting the screen,

747
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:58,339
and you're trying to understand some character's motivation.

748
00:34:58,499 --> 00:34:59,560
It's not quite clear.

749
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,542
And you're like, this sucks.

750
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:05,365
So it's so critical to just keep going out there

751
00:35:05,385 --> 00:35:06,266
and keep going out there.

752
00:35:06,326 --> 00:35:08,087
And I think the beauty about audio is it's heads up.

753
00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:13,870
And that does bring up one other point, which is when you use audio as your main way of

754
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:19,892
telling your narrative, the other forms of communicating, and particularly text or found

755
00:35:19,932 --> 00:35:25,073
documents, they drop in hierarchy. And plot points and plot twists and clever things we

756
00:35:25,093 --> 00:35:30,635
thought the player would figure out by reading get completely lost. And you guys have found

757
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:31,415
that as well?

758
00:35:31,455 --> 00:35:34,917
Keep the story as simple as possible when you're out there.

759
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:38,657
As we get on to pitfalls to avoid, keep it simple.

760
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,419
Audio is cheap and really effective,

761
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:44,721
and it's often not incompatible with the user's experience

762
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:45,842
of the real world around them.

763
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:47,984
Like if you have ever been walking down the street.

764
00:35:48,431 --> 00:35:49,791
listening to something on your headphones,

765
00:35:49,871 --> 00:35:51,892
and the right song comes on at the right moment,

766
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:54,132
that, your reality is being augmented.

767
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,993
At that point, I don't really care what the data set is.

768
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,153
That's augmented reality,

769
00:35:58,213 --> 00:35:59,574
and humans are really susceptible

770
00:35:59,614 --> 00:36:01,174
to having their reality augmented,

771
00:36:01,574 --> 00:36:02,835
and we just try and recreate that.

772
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:05,475
The heads-up effect of audio is really, really important,

773
00:36:05,515 --> 00:36:07,136
and also, you can do things

774
00:36:07,176 --> 00:36:09,036
that don't have to be physically possible.

775
00:36:09,076 --> 00:36:11,517
They're as real and vivid as the player's imagination.

776
00:36:11,997 --> 00:36:13,017
That's why I love audio.

777
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:16,901
Yeah, no, I think, and music, because when we say audio,

778
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,042
well, we're often talking about narrative.

779
00:36:19,062 --> 00:36:20,643
You know, go over here, this is happening.

780
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:26,365
But music is absolutely another character in the experience.

781
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:28,767
And as you guys are going out and designing,

782
00:36:29,227 --> 00:36:31,468
think of music as this.

783
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:35,532
as this tone setter, and it can do really interesting things

784
00:36:35,552 --> 00:36:37,414
with how scenarios are interpreted.

785
00:36:37,794 --> 00:36:40,697
So in our games often, in some of our games,

786
00:36:40,737 --> 00:36:42,780
we'll take the media that the players create,

787
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,523
and in front of them, if we all come back after the game,

788
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:48,025
we're live mixing sound effects and music

789
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:50,048
to the photos and videos that they've already taken.

790
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,612
The video originally may be something that's quite somber,

791
00:36:55,652 --> 00:36:57,974
but the minute that you overlay the Andy Griffith theme,

792
00:36:58,494 --> 00:37:00,355
it is a completely different experience.

793
00:37:00,915 --> 00:37:03,517
Or if someone's boxing and you throw on Rocky

794
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:04,858
and people, their face melts.

795
00:37:04,898 --> 00:37:08,600
So it's something where I think we think of it

796
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:10,282
as kind of this orchestral background,

797
00:37:10,322 --> 00:37:14,084
but it really does push narrative forward

798
00:37:14,244 --> 00:37:15,905
in ways that may be underexplored.

799
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:19,727
So moving forward on sort of pitfalls to avoid,

800
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:21,228
we've talked about some of these things already

801
00:37:21,248 --> 00:37:23,188
in the conversation, you know, not wanting to look,

802
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:25,509
not wanting to be embarrassed by what you're doing,

803
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,091
keeping the story simple because people

804
00:37:29,391 --> 00:37:30,951
will lose a lot of details,

805
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,852
not asking them to do too much

806
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:36,613
or motivating them properly to get up and go.

807
00:37:37,614 --> 00:37:40,115
So rather than sort of go through some more generics,

808
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:43,196
can I get a brief example from each of you

809
00:37:43,436 --> 00:37:46,237
of something to avoid doing that you've.

810
00:37:46,637 --> 00:37:52,140
A ticking clock where someone has to get to a location, particularly if they're out in

811
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,060
the wild, there's vehicles.

812
00:37:54,261 --> 00:37:57,422
It's just too dangerous and you have a responsibility.

813
00:37:57,502 --> 00:38:03,985
People will already kind of be in this world and going after this objective and be motivated

814
00:38:04,025 --> 00:38:05,826
to move and step out.

815
00:38:06,006 --> 00:38:09,927
So it's a tough one because it's a nice go-to to be like, got to get there before the clock

816
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:10,328
runs out.

817
00:38:10,948 --> 00:38:11,768
That's a good one, Steve.

818
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,889
Specific pitfalls?

819
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:13,309
Yeah.

820
00:38:14,702 --> 00:38:17,506
Don't tell your players to dress up like the Joker and go to the mall.

821
00:38:19,148 --> 00:38:20,429
Because they'll shut the mall down.

822
00:38:21,671 --> 00:38:22,332
That happened to you, right?

823
00:38:22,352 --> 00:38:22,832
The police will come.

824
00:38:22,993 --> 00:38:23,213
Yes.

825
00:38:25,075 --> 00:38:26,077
Well, not being personal.

826
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:29,561
But you had players doing that.

827
00:38:30,682 --> 00:38:31,403
From what I hear, yes.

828
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:35,370
On the advice of counsel, I decline to answer.

829
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,230
Yes, it's obvious.

830
00:38:37,111 --> 00:38:41,534
Well, I think you have to, a pitfall is to assume that you're not going to make mistakes

831
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:44,716
as the designer, or you and your production team are going to do everything flawlessly.

832
00:38:45,076 --> 00:38:45,716
Never happens.

833
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:49,259
And also, you know, learn to kind of enjoy it.

834
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,482
There was one epic mix-up that was very entertaining for me,

835
00:38:54,522 --> 00:38:56,423
and I think it was sort of entertaining for the players, but...

836
00:38:56,903 --> 00:39:05,166
We had a game in Vegas and you can't, it's illegal to take photos and videos on the casino

837
00:39:05,206 --> 00:39:07,266
floor so that was off limits for a lot of the play.

838
00:39:07,807 --> 00:39:13,208
So we put a lot of our actors in rooms in the hotels and one mission, teams had to go

839
00:39:13,248 --> 00:39:17,930
to a room and they walked in and they were going to get grilled on sports trivia.

840
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,872
So we had an actor in there wearing a ref's shirt

841
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:23,094
and a whistle and was just ready to like get in there.

842
00:39:23,434 --> 00:39:27,497
And then another room, they were told that it was a crime.

843
00:39:27,557 --> 00:39:28,698
It just happened there and they had to go

844
00:39:28,718 --> 00:39:29,779
and they couldn't touch anything,

845
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:32,782
but they had to scan the crime scene for clues

846
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,383
and then get out.

847
00:39:34,423 --> 00:39:36,344
And then unbeknownst to them, 20 minutes later,

848
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:39,507
they would be drilled on the details of the room.

849
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,823
But they also didn't know that we'd hidden a guy in the closet

850
00:39:44,724 --> 00:39:45,585
to jump out.

851
00:39:46,907 --> 00:39:49,530
And he was dressed just, he was horrifying.

852
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,310
He was so scary.

853
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:52,553
And so they were supposed to kind of sneak around and then

854
00:39:53,454 --> 00:39:54,075
get freaked out.

855
00:39:54,415 --> 00:39:57,698
But I switched, or the keys got switched, right?

856
00:39:57,759 --> 00:40:00,181
So the wrong actor went to the wrong room.

857
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:09,086
And so the sports, the team expecting sports stats got scared, you know, by this guy in

858
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:09,647
the closet.

859
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:15,210
And then the crime scene kids were getting grilled on like baseball things.

860
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:15,670
So you know.

861
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:17,156
I

862
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:17,316
think

863
00:40:38,247 --> 00:40:40,487
Your player characters have no AI.

864
00:40:40,627 --> 00:40:41,788
That's the problem, they're humans.

865
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,689
And you have no, that's the craziest thing.

866
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:45,929
You're like, no, why are you doing that?

867
00:40:45,969 --> 00:40:47,149
There's nothing about this game

868
00:40:47,169 --> 00:40:48,410
that means you're supposed to do that.

869
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:49,870
I just wanted to go this way.

870
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,931
Well, and that speaks to this question of,

871
00:40:52,071 --> 00:40:53,011
you know, in video games,

872
00:40:53,571 --> 00:40:56,532
traditional video games, we can have invisible walls

873
00:40:56,572 --> 00:40:57,853
that stop you from going there.

874
00:40:57,973 --> 00:40:59,933
And you can't do that in the real world.

875
00:41:00,033 --> 00:41:01,814
People will just walk into that room.

876
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,975
Yeah, if your story can't survive having any,

877
00:41:06,595 --> 00:41:09,357
like any 10, 20 second section of it.

878
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,278
If the player can't just miss that,

879
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:13,280
and your story can't survive that,

880
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,361
like you only say everything once,

881
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:17,843
or like you have a reveal and you have to be there,

882
00:41:17,863 --> 00:41:18,903
and if you're not there for it,

883
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,784
then your story doesn't make sense.

884
00:41:20,824 --> 00:41:21,605
It's not like a movie.

885
00:41:21,665 --> 00:41:23,166
Like if you have to.

886
00:41:23,506 --> 00:41:26,627
pay attention to this section and you can't afford to have the player miss it.

887
00:41:26,907 --> 00:41:30,668
It's just not a story that's suited for an immersive environment because the

888
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:34,910
player will be distracted. We use mobile phones. They could receive a call and or

889
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,931
like they could see a friend and take their headphones off for ten seconds and

890
00:41:37,951 --> 00:41:40,472
we don't want them to be able to skip back necessarily because that doesn't

891
00:41:40,492 --> 00:41:44,973
feel very immersive either. We need a nice story that patches itself together

892
00:41:45,133 --> 00:41:48,395
and leaves enough space for the player to be doing some of the imaginative work

893
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,115
but also that can survive.

894
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:52,657
you know, it's not just dominoes.

895
00:41:52,717 --> 00:41:54,018
If one of those dominoes doesn't fall,

896
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:55,519
the rest of them still need to go down

897
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:57,621
the way you vaguely want them to.

898
00:41:58,441 --> 00:42:00,483
And it was mentioned the, you know,

899
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:02,304
people can just walk where they want,

900
00:42:02,324 --> 00:42:03,505
they don't have an AI,

901
00:42:03,545 --> 00:42:06,428
and then you get this problem with griefers, potentially.

902
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,529
Well, and also too, I'd say that one,

903
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,271
on a serious answer to the question,

904
00:42:10,331 --> 00:42:11,411
instead of the mall thing,

905
00:42:11,431 --> 00:42:13,813
you know, keep in mind kind of that,

906
00:42:14,334 --> 00:42:15,995
where that the magic circle is

907
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:18,517
and how it affects people that aren't in on it,

908
00:42:18,717 --> 00:42:19,398
in on the joke.

909
00:42:20,058 --> 00:42:22,459
Always be mindful of context, right?

910
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:25,220
How things appear to those who don't necessarily know

911
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,682
what's going on when they see a guy on the street

912
00:42:28,862 --> 00:42:29,962
get a hood thrown over his head

913
00:42:30,022 --> 00:42:32,143
and throw it into a black van and scoot it away.

914
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:34,604
And even if the guy was prepared for that

915
00:42:34,724 --> 00:42:35,565
and knew that was happening,

916
00:42:35,585 --> 00:42:36,865
number one, I don't think it's a great idea.

917
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:40,247
But for onlookers, if you're doing it in a public place,

918
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:41,287
keep in the context.

919
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:42,648
I know the people that have said,

920
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:44,749
we're gonna leave you a cache of,

921
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:47,650
it's gonna be in an ammo box left on a picnic table.

922
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:51,252
you know, in this post 9-11 world we live in,

923
00:42:51,553 --> 00:42:55,115
that sort of thing's not really a great idea for the people that aren't in on the game.

924
00:42:55,635 --> 00:42:59,058
And so there are a lot more ethical considerations

925
00:42:59,918 --> 00:43:03,821
that you have to take into consideration with these sorts of things.

926
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:07,682
Yeah, so in a way you're designing both for the player and for whoever's around them.

927
00:43:07,702 --> 00:43:10,103
And onlookers, yeah. Inadvertent onlookers.

928
00:43:10,163 --> 00:43:14,984
If you're doing a multiplayer thing, and someone was talking to me about a design that they had,

929
00:43:15,184 --> 00:43:19,025
and it sounded like it was fun, but one of the problems is multiplayer and you're scavenging.

930
00:43:19,605 --> 00:43:23,586
And the items that you're scavenging could include things like a gun.

931
00:43:24,867 --> 00:43:26,027
And you just have to imagine that.

932
00:43:27,182 --> 00:43:31,026
uh... all over the world, out of context, you hear these two guys going, I got one, I found a gun, I got a gun,

933
00:43:31,087 --> 00:43:34,390
did you get a gun? Yeah. Did you get ammo? I got ammo! Come on over here, I've got a gun.

934
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:35,211
Those

935
00:43:35,231 --> 00:43:39,677
are the things that are not, those are the, the, kind of the byproduct of what can happen. So we're in this

936
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:41,739
kind of area where these tropes, these, these

937
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:46,244
these uh... things that are very handy to, to have in a game.

938
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:50,348
You have to think about, will someone say that out loud, standing in a park?

939
00:43:50,548 --> 00:43:53,670
Consequences can become real if you're not careful.

940
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:56,992
Also beware of helpful players, because we had a...

941
00:43:57,693 --> 00:44:02,156
The launch, like the first launch of one of our very first projects,

942
00:44:02,236 --> 00:44:04,578
the first 15 minutes, things started going haywire,

943
00:44:04,618 --> 00:44:06,699
and we started getting bugs that we hadn't had before.

944
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,661
And it turned out that it was because we were using Bluetooth beacons

945
00:44:09,701 --> 00:44:12,784
to provide very accurate, very local location data,

946
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:15,746
so that users could like, turn left or turn right down a corridor.

947
00:44:16,163 --> 00:44:18,183
have an immediate response, and that would represent

948
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:19,724
an immediate choice that they were making.

949
00:44:20,184 --> 00:44:22,564
And a user had found one of our beacons

950
00:44:23,304 --> 00:44:24,985
where it was supposed to be, but thought,

951
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:26,825
someone might pick that up and do something with it,

952
00:44:26,845 --> 00:44:28,846
so I'm gonna pick it up and return it to the guys.

953
00:44:29,846 --> 00:44:32,106
And not only were they then picking it up and moving it,

954
00:44:32,126 --> 00:44:34,167
in order to try and be helpful, this good Samaritan,

955
00:44:34,187 --> 00:44:35,587
they were walking around with it in their pocket

956
00:44:35,707 --> 00:44:39,268
around the start area, looking for one of us to give it to,

957
00:44:39,508 --> 00:44:40,588
which meant that our players were getting

958
00:44:40,628 --> 00:44:42,769
a load of false positives from the end of the story,

959
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:45,430
and the story was skipping, and we've put in fail-safe,

960
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,070
so that doesn't happen.

961
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,132
But yeah, that kind of players who sort of,

962
00:44:49,512 --> 00:44:50,994
who wanted to go the extra mile,

963
00:44:51,054 --> 00:44:52,715
you also need to build in a reward for them,

964
00:44:53,215 --> 00:44:55,417
rather than, so that everybody wants to feel like

965
00:44:55,437 --> 00:44:57,038
they know something that everybody else doesn't.

966
00:44:57,098 --> 00:44:58,519
That's why espionage works so well.

967
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,962
So, if you're gonna let people see the strings of your game,

968
00:45:02,022 --> 00:45:03,343
that's not necessarily a bad thing,

969
00:45:03,523 --> 00:45:05,345
but you need to reward them, rather than go,

970
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:07,066
thank you, I'll just go and put this beacon back

971
00:45:07,086 --> 00:45:07,827
where it's supposed to be.

972
00:45:10,548 --> 00:45:12,909
We're running a little short on time, so I do want to move forward.

973
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:17,550
And speaking of legal and ethical concerns, one of the big controversies that came up

974
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:22,651
with Pokemon Go was, of course, issues around trespassing, issues around privacy, issues

975
00:45:22,691 --> 00:45:26,892
around putting a PokeStop at the Holocaust Museum, things like that.

976
00:45:26,952 --> 00:45:30,713
How do we avoid those issues as writers and designers?

977
00:45:32,499 --> 00:45:34,621
Well, first, know that they realize they exist,

978
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:38,205
which doesn't exactly occur to a lot of people.

979
00:45:39,226 --> 00:45:41,108
It is an interesting, brave new world we're in

980
00:45:41,148 --> 00:45:42,690
because it does bring up the question of,

981
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,492
like, the guy that wakes up one morning

982
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:48,015
and his garden in his backyard is now a pokey stop

983
00:45:48,075 --> 00:45:50,898
to this, you know, multimillion dollar game

984
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:52,780
that he never consented to,

985
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,563
and he's not making, he's not sharing in the revenue.

986
00:45:55,924 --> 00:46:02,028
but somebody is using his private property to make money off of, basically.

987
00:46:02,068 --> 00:46:08,993
So there are these questions that honestly have yet to be resolved in a lot of ways.

988
00:46:10,174 --> 00:46:14,137
Most people don't mind, but then there is, yeah, there's the curator of the Holocaust

989
00:46:14,177 --> 00:46:20,061
Museum or there's a memorial in the middle of town that was dedicated to a certain family

990
00:46:20,121 --> 00:46:21,702
that all died in World War II.

991
00:46:23,903 --> 00:46:24,924
It's a very somber place.

992
00:46:25,584 --> 00:46:28,645
And there are all these little different use cases

993
00:46:29,845 --> 00:46:32,406
where it may not be appropriate to play a game.

994
00:46:32,726 --> 00:46:36,128
And so right now, it's easy right now.

995
00:46:36,148 --> 00:46:38,949
You can say, well, we'll contact the makers of the game,

996
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:41,089
and we'll have them opt us out.

997
00:46:41,389 --> 00:46:44,170
But then again, if you're a big player,

998
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,611
and you may have your own IP, and you may have your own.

999
00:46:48,152 --> 00:46:53,094
area where you may not want somebody else's IP to be invading on yours, I won't mention

1000
00:46:53,154 --> 00:46:57,217
any amusement park names, that may be an issue there.

1001
00:46:57,497 --> 00:47:01,439
So there are all these considerations that I think aren't going to go away, they're only

1002
00:47:01,459 --> 00:47:04,861
going to get more exacerbated as we go on and there's going to be more and more of these

1003
00:47:04,901 --> 00:47:10,964
games as geolocation games become more mainstream, which I really think they are going to be

1004
00:47:11,004 --> 00:47:13,066
now, now that everybody knows what Pokemon Go is.

1005
00:47:13,086 --> 00:47:14,466
So that's an issue.

1006
00:47:16,087 --> 00:47:23,170
I mean, yeah, we have a way of blacklisting those sites using our tech, but, you know,

1007
00:47:24,351 --> 00:47:25,892
it's like it needs to be centralized.

1008
00:47:26,072 --> 00:47:29,413
Is everybody, you know, who's constantly having people trespassing going to have to figure

1009
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:30,434
out who published the game?

1010
00:47:30,474 --> 00:47:31,634
How do I get a hold of that person?

1011
00:47:31,694 --> 00:47:31,794
So...

1012
00:47:32,635 --> 00:47:34,056
Yeah, you're right. That's a larger question

1013
00:47:34,956 --> 00:47:41,040
So I think about it like this that if you're playing Pokemon go and you see a Pokemon on the other side of a chain

1014
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:46,963
Link fence and you can't get at it. That is not the game not functioning as designed. That is a feature

1015
00:47:47,023 --> 00:47:47,804
That's not a bug

1016
00:47:47,884 --> 00:47:52,407
That is the way that the game introduces exciting elements to make the real world more interesting

1017
00:47:52,507 --> 00:47:55,789
The real world also introduces obstacles to make the game more interesting

1018
00:47:56,489 --> 00:47:59,432
But the world is full of all kinds of fences,

1019
00:47:59,792 --> 00:48:02,254
and fences affect some people more than others

1020
00:48:02,434 --> 00:48:06,098
for reasons of gender, or race, or physical ability.

1021
00:48:06,558 --> 00:48:09,281
And the world is full of unpleasant realities

1022
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:11,843
that some people have to deal with more than others.

1023
00:48:12,363 --> 00:48:15,586
And I think the minute we're working in augmented reality,

1024
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:18,188
we have a responsibility to reality,

1025
00:48:18,489 --> 00:48:20,971
and the player's reality, and to take that into account.

1026
00:48:21,571 --> 00:48:22,452
And so if your game...

1027
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:29,933
if it operates in reality, that means that some people will have an experience of it which might be limited, for example,

1028
00:48:30,053 --> 00:48:33,634
or might, you know, you might not feel able or comfortable walking around at night

1029
00:48:34,714 --> 00:48:37,375
looking for Pokemon in your neighborhood or someone else's neighborhood,

1030
00:48:37,395 --> 00:48:42,677
and that means that experience is locked off for you, and we have to be able to take that into account and to kind of

1031
00:48:43,678 --> 00:48:49,080
write art that can adapt to that, or that at least, you know, takes it into account.

1032
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:54,961
Yeah, no, I think it's important that anybody that's designing for these real world games

1033
00:48:55,101 --> 00:48:59,824
is putting at the top of their list, examining their own design bias.

1034
00:49:00,344 --> 00:49:06,107
And what are you bringing to the table that you're unknowingly laying on everybody who's

1035
00:49:06,147 --> 00:49:08,368
playing and not playing this experience that you're crafting.

1036
00:49:08,888 --> 00:49:13,011
So I think surrounding yourself with intelligent people,

1037
00:49:13,671 --> 00:49:16,133
surrounding yourself with community organizations

1038
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,795
that know way more and better than you do,

1039
00:49:19,516 --> 00:49:21,577
surrounding yourself with experts in various fields.

1040
00:49:21,717 --> 00:49:24,239
I also think there's going to be a lot of dialogue

1041
00:49:24,279 --> 00:49:26,861
between urban planners and game designers,

1042
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:30,023
which is going to be good and messy and great.

1043
00:49:31,004 --> 00:49:33,826
But I think the first thing is to ask

1044
00:49:34,286 --> 00:49:36,968
really, really uncomfortable questions

1045
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:37,989
and see what happens.

1046
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,981
and hire diversely. People will know things that you don't.

1047
00:49:43,561 --> 00:49:46,722
So the last two minutes before we have some time for questions,

1048
00:49:46,802 --> 00:49:49,922
I do want to touch on briefly sort of the business side of this.

1049
00:49:50,763 --> 00:49:54,163
You mentioned you're thinking, you think that this will become a bigger thing now that

1050
00:49:54,183 --> 00:49:58,384
Pokemon Go has happened. Do we think that was just a flash in the pan or is there actually

1051
00:49:58,424 --> 00:50:01,525
market growth potential here? Yeah, it's gonna work.

1052
00:50:02,905 --> 00:50:06,586
I mean, okay, Pokemon Go is lightning in a bottle. There are a lot of things happening

1053
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:13,116
to contribute to its success. I mean IP being the foremost of that. But what it has done,

1054
00:50:13,156 --> 00:50:18,180
it has become a success case and it makes it easier to pitch these projects so you can

1055
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:22,804
say, oh yeah, it's Pokemon Go meets Harry Potter or whatever, you know, and people will

1056
00:50:22,824 --> 00:50:29,370
understand what that is. And so when we add to that, new technologies are going to come

1057
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:30,931
along, eventually wearables.

1058
00:50:31,932 --> 00:50:38,197
something's going to become acceptable socially and technologically. I mean, the technology's

1059
00:50:38,217 --> 00:50:43,601
going to increase and being able to use not only your location but being able to use augmented

1060
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:48,725
reality to do the thing and say, yeah, there's a dragon flying around and there's King Kong

1061
00:50:48,765 --> 00:50:54,129
up on the building and that could give some really, really big potential. Again, there's

1062
00:50:54,169 --> 00:50:56,911
a little bit of unknown. There's a lot of people still aren't quite sure.

1063
00:50:57,431 --> 00:50:59,212
But, I mean, it's not going to go away, I don't think.

1064
00:50:59,272 --> 00:51:02,094
I mean, people are going to try new things, try different things,

1065
00:51:02,154 --> 00:51:03,775
and the technology is going to go forward.

1066
00:51:03,795 --> 00:51:05,116
And I think it's a great thing.

1067
00:51:06,097 --> 00:51:08,098
Obviously, Pokémon Go made money.

1068
00:51:08,118 --> 00:51:10,039
I assume you've heard.

1069
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:14,963
But, yeah, can other experiences like this make money?

1070
00:51:15,884 --> 00:51:18,426
Yeah, yes, totally.

1071
00:51:19,547 --> 00:51:24,832
So I think the Go game has been a really interesting trial

1072
00:51:25,213 --> 00:51:32,139
balloon or test case on how the market of play

1073
00:51:32,179 --> 00:51:33,400
has changed over the years.

1074
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:38,324
You know, when they first started, this is well before I got there, it was just fun.

1075
00:51:38,444 --> 00:51:42,307
It was just to have a good time and send people off to do goofy things in public.

1076
00:51:43,047 --> 00:51:48,331
And I remember being told around 2008 that shifted dramatically where all of a sudden

1077
00:51:48,391 --> 00:51:50,253
the majority of our clients were coming to us and saying,

1078
00:51:50,953 --> 00:51:56,219
We're having a morale crisis because the world is crazy, the economy is crazy, people who

1079
00:51:56,299 --> 00:52:00,564
are in the workplace are going through unprecedented levels of stress and pressure.

1080
00:52:01,305 --> 00:52:09,333
We need play as a way to let go of that for a second, just to take a deep breath and enjoy

1081
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:09,794
ourselves.

1082
00:52:10,414 --> 00:52:13,616
And then, since then, it's changed again and again.

1083
00:52:13,816 --> 00:52:16,097
We see play being used as a recruitment tool.

1084
00:52:16,517 --> 00:52:18,198
We see play, well, we've always seen play

1085
00:52:18,278 --> 00:52:20,499
used as an educational tool, which I think is great.

1086
00:52:20,939 --> 00:52:24,721
And I'm passionate, passionate about applied play,

1087
00:52:24,761 --> 00:52:26,642
about using play towards something

1088
00:52:26,682 --> 00:52:30,044
that you wouldn't necessarily think it could be useful for,

1089
00:52:30,084 --> 00:52:31,545
and which is how the whole zombie

1090
00:52:31,925 --> 00:52:33,586
disaster preparedness games came about,

1091
00:52:34,306 --> 00:52:36,547
because we wanted to tackle something

1092
00:52:36,967 --> 00:52:39,188
that people have a natural aversion to.

1093
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,868
How many people have an emergency kit?

1094
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:46,588
Okay, good, oh good, more preppers than normal.

1095
00:52:47,609 --> 00:52:49,190
But for everyone who doesn't, by the way,

1096
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:50,290
I didn't for a very long time,

1097
00:52:51,131 --> 00:52:53,312
I'm willing to wager that part of the reason

1098
00:52:53,352 --> 00:52:55,973
why you haven't is because you haven't gotten around to it.

1099
00:52:55,993 --> 00:52:59,375
It's kind of boring to buy granola bars on your Saturday.

1100
00:53:00,336 --> 00:53:01,897
Or you're not doing it with friends,

1101
00:53:02,017 --> 00:53:04,418
it's intimidating even to think about the reality.

1102
00:53:05,058 --> 00:53:08,600
So using play to switch those emotions around

1103
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,921
and instead making preparedness something that is,

1104
00:53:11,462 --> 00:53:14,623
memorable and social and engaging and fun.

1105
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:19,686
There are so many different industries and challenges

1106
00:53:19,726 --> 00:53:22,027
that we could be taking the mechanics of play

1107
00:53:22,067 --> 00:53:25,269
and applying towards creating new outcomes.

1108
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:28,671
And we're seeing a demand for that,

1109
00:53:28,731 --> 00:53:29,892
which I think is really interesting.

1110
00:53:29,912 --> 00:53:32,373
People want to really maximize play as a tool

1111
00:53:32,413 --> 00:53:33,974
to solve all of these different problems.

1112
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,192
Okay, so we have like two minutes left.

1113
00:53:36,412 --> 00:53:39,094
So we have time for like one question at each microphone

1114
00:53:39,114 --> 00:53:40,115
for the first people that stand up.

1115
00:53:40,135 --> 00:53:41,996
Can I ask something about the revenue thing

1116
00:53:42,056 --> 00:53:42,857
just really quickly?

1117
00:53:43,177 --> 00:53:45,419
There is one really unique opportunity

1118
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:47,260
with that I've seen with geolocation games

1119
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,261
and Pokemon Go has started to do it

1120
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:52,704
is that presents itself and that is brand partnerships.

1121
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:56,505
in a unique way. I mean they've got the one of the first things was McDonald's

1122
00:53:56,545 --> 00:53:57,025
in Japan

1123
00:53:57,365 --> 00:54:00,426
saying, oh we're gonna have these special Pokemon that only show up at McDonald's.

1124
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:04,427
A multi-million dollar deal, you know, that was a great example

1125
00:54:04,748 --> 00:54:07,528
and that's not possible in other, I mean that's the first time

1126
00:54:07,868 --> 00:54:10,589
something like that has happened. It's kind of a unique new way of

1127
00:54:10,969 --> 00:54:13,770
you drop, you know, you grab people and you point them to

1128
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:17,831
your brand and their gameplay is enhanced by doing that.

1129
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:19,572
That's just a unique moment.

1130
00:54:19,592 --> 00:54:22,114
And I think a DLC is a viable vision.

1131
00:54:22,154 --> 00:54:22,934
Yes, build a DLC.

1132
00:54:22,954 --> 00:54:23,755
You have a campaign.

1133
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:27,177
So we're going to be in the wrap-up room afterwards to continue talking.

1134
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:30,379
We can talk about how to get started in this stuff because we don't have time, but I just

1135
00:54:30,419 --> 00:54:31,619
do want to take two quick questions.

1136
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:32,020
So right there.

1137
00:54:33,234 --> 00:54:34,775
Just sort of I guess going off this topic

1138
00:54:35,016 --> 00:54:36,978
I'm working on a game right now for a museum

1139
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:42,323
And I just wanted to talk about our ask you sort of best practices for working with a client

1140
00:54:43,024 --> 00:54:50,471
making sure that you're sort of incorporating whatever data or you know that they want to be conveying to their visitors or

1141
00:54:50,752 --> 00:54:53,775
You know if it's a commercial project their clients or whatever

1142
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:02,164
Because we've done kind of museum and place stuff in listed buildings or

1143
00:55:02,244 --> 00:55:05,747
buildings that are kind of historic or you know very protective of their fabric

1144
00:55:06,028 --> 00:55:09,331
reassure the venue that you're not going to damage the fabric of the building

1145
00:55:09,391 --> 00:55:12,253
that is if they're not saying it that definitely is something that they're

1146
00:55:12,273 --> 00:55:15,296
thinking about and you know I mean held is the example of

1147
00:55:16,137 --> 00:55:17,838
Is it Minneapolis? Minnesota?

1148
00:55:17,918 --> 00:55:20,099
Who tried to now ban Pokemon Go

1149
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:22,400
because the volume of people visiting the park

1150
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,042
damaged their parks, which surely is,

1151
00:55:25,062 --> 00:55:27,563
then that's the park operating as designed.

1152
00:55:28,304 --> 00:55:30,545
But just reassure them that that's not gonna be the case

1153
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:32,626
and that it's just gonna be a fun kind of foot traffic

1154
00:55:32,706 --> 00:55:34,227
rather than a scary kind of foot traffic.

1155
00:55:35,087 --> 00:55:37,189
We will continuing answering that in the room.

1156
00:55:37,449 --> 00:55:37,829
Right over here.

1157
00:55:38,895 --> 00:55:43,318
Hi, I'm a law student and my area of developing expertise

1158
00:55:43,518 --> 00:55:45,760
is property rights and augmented reality games.

1159
00:55:46,181 --> 00:55:48,002
So I'm really curious to hear if any of you

1160
00:55:48,042 --> 00:55:49,764
have had any actual legal problems

1161
00:55:50,064 --> 00:55:52,105
and also how you interact with lawyers

1162
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:53,446
to kind of preempt these issues.

1163
00:55:53,486 --> 00:55:54,527
I know you guys all touched on it,

1164
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:55,368
but I'm really interested.

1165
00:55:55,989 --> 00:55:57,950
I would love to talk to you offline after this.

1166
00:56:00,058 --> 00:56:01,059
We're not being recorded.

1167
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:06,326
Very strong disclaimers and constantly guiding the player, reminding the player to be safe.

1168
00:56:06,727 --> 00:56:13,255
To actually try to effectively prevent a problem is one of the most important things, I think.

1169
00:56:13,435 --> 00:56:15,878
And then if you have a backup, use your agreement.

1170
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:20,616
Yeah, that takes up a big part of the design process,

1171
00:56:20,676 --> 00:56:22,236
is getting the proper permitting

1172
00:56:22,536 --> 00:56:24,597
and making sure your I's are dotted and T's are crossed.

1173
00:56:24,617 --> 00:56:27,038
So I think it's definitely gonna be a developing space

1174
00:56:27,158 --> 00:56:29,379
where it's gonna come, you're in the right place.

1175
00:56:29,399 --> 00:56:30,279
You are in the right place.

1176
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:31,860
You have the good word.

1177
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,420
Awesome, thank you so much everybody.

1178
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,421
We will be in the wrap up room just across the hall

1179
00:56:35,621 --> 00:56:38,962
and tonight at the secret location around six o'clock

1180
00:56:39,002 --> 00:56:40,263
if you wanna keep the conversation going.

1181
00:56:40,543 --> 00:56:41,483
Thank you so much for coming guys.
