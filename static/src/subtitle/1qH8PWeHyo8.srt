1
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:06,962
All right.

2
00:00:06,982 --> 00:00:08,743
We're good to go?

3
00:00:08,763 --> 00:00:09,003
All right.

4
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:11,745
So I've been told to tell you guys

5
00:00:11,785 --> 00:00:16,088
before I start to turn off any noise making devices.

6
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:18,590
This is being recorded, so anything

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:23,554
that's not distracting from the presentation would be great.

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,957
Also, after the talk, if you could fill out

9
00:00:27,997 --> 00:00:31,320
your evaluation forms, that's really helpful.

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,240
So please do that.

11
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,822
So.

12
00:00:35,107 --> 00:00:37,309
First, I just want to thank all of you

13
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:38,710
for coming to my presentation.

14
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:41,272
It's a huge milestone for me,

15
00:00:41,372 --> 00:00:43,594
and something I've wanted to do for a very long time.

16
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:48,618
And my apologies if I stumble over a few words.

17
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:50,719
I'm more than a little nervous here.

18
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:53,762
There will be time reserved after the talk

19
00:00:53,782 --> 00:00:55,143
for what I'm about to show you.

20
00:00:56,043 --> 00:00:57,565
If you have any extra questions,

21
00:00:57,585 --> 00:01:00,807
we're gonna try to reserve time at the end of the talk.

22
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:07,755
The room that we'll be in is room 3000, which I believe is right across the hall.

23
00:01:09,676 --> 00:01:11,137
Let me start by introducing myself.

24
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,800
So for those that don't know me, my name is Gavin Goulden.

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,942
I'm the lead character artist for Insomniac Games,

26
00:01:18,763 --> 00:01:21,865
working on our upcoming Xbox One title, Sunset Overdrive.

27
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:28,190
Prior to this, I was the lead character artist on Bioshock Infinite for Rational Games,

28
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,491
and it's following DLC, Burial at Sea.

29
00:01:31,713 --> 00:01:36,579
While working on these projects, I was mainly responsible for the look and feel of our characters in the game,

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,324
managing a small team, developing and maintaining best practices,

31
00:01:42,064 --> 00:01:44,567
communicating with other departments to deliver what they needed on time.

32
00:01:46,164 --> 00:01:49,066
Working on this project taught me a lot of lessons.

33
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:51,667
One of these lessons that I truly believe in

34
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:54,028
is the importance of iteration during development.

35
00:01:54,568 --> 00:01:57,330
I feel that artists, and especially younger artists,

36
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,951
are told earlier in their career

37
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:01,292
not to get married to their work,

38
00:02:02,152 --> 00:02:03,513
but aren't really given working examples

39
00:02:03,593 --> 00:02:04,473
why they shouldn't be.

40
00:02:05,395 --> 00:02:13,858
In this talk, I'll be using my team's work on Bioshock Infinite as an example, showing where we came from and where we ended up.

41
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:20,041
How if we had settled on the first idea that we had, it would have looked like a totally different game, and probably not as done so well.

42
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:27,124
I'll share the struggles of development, the processes taken, and the ideas developed along the way, and how we ended up with our final product.

43
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:33,026
Just gonna work this thing. Greg.

44
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:40,975
Alright, so during this talk, I'll be covering the process of iteration using examples from three different departments.

45
00:02:41,517 --> 00:02:42,901
How their needs changed over time.

46
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,759
and how it required us as a character or team to change.

47
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,500
Narrative, the storyline of our game,

48
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,082
the driving force behind the final decisions made.

49
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:54,344
Overall art direction, aesthetic choices made

50
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:57,126
on environment side that influence our character's appearance

51
00:02:57,906 --> 00:02:59,987
and the combat design more intense

52
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:02,069
than any game Irrational had ever made.

53
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,051
Most importantly, the lesson that I learned

54
00:03:05,071 --> 00:03:07,052
from this project and hoping to show with these examples

55
00:03:07,712 --> 00:03:09,753
is the need to embrace the organic nature of change

56
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:10,794
during game development.

57
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:12,523
Not everything can be planned for.

58
00:03:12,963 --> 00:03:14,584
Features are cut once they are tried out,

59
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:15,885
and new features added.

60
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:18,167
Entire directions can change,

61
00:03:18,247 --> 00:03:20,208
and it's our job as production artists

62
00:03:20,828 --> 00:03:23,490
to adapt to those change and deliver high quality assets.

63
00:03:26,652 --> 00:03:28,213
Before we get into these examples though,

64
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,301
I want to get some backstory.

65
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,781
This is how Bioshock Infinite started.

66
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:36,182
It was a dark, gloomy world with an Art Nouveau inspiration.

67
00:03:36,522 --> 00:03:38,403
This is essentially a flying rapture.

68
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:41,284
Low visibility, populated by mutants,

69
00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:43,864
and fantastical machines with a touch of horror.

70
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,265
These worlds were so similar that the development team

71
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,686
actually started referring to the world as Flapture.

72
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,551
Eventually, we felt we were not pushing ourselves far enough.

73
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:59,994
That the game would feel like a Bioshock 3, and not a Bioshock Infinite.

74
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:04,876
Which is a totally new game, and had plenty of fresh ideas, and a unique storyline.

75
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:08,518
Here you can see a great comparison showing what Emporia,

76
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:12,780
which is one of the final levels in Bioshock Infinite, originally looked like.

77
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,282
It's filled with carnival imagery, harsh lighting, and heavy fog.

78
00:04:17,683 --> 00:04:21,365
It was a totally different world, and one that definitely belonged more in Bioshock 1.

79
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:27,624
This is another example of how extremely different the world was.

80
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:31,647
This is a shot of a level that would eventually be dubbed Town Center.

81
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:34,068
It's just an average environment for the game.

82
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:37,451
We intended to introduce the player to our setting.

83
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:41,834
You can see in these images we are holding on to our Bioshock 1 roots

84
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,335
into Rapture.

85
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:46,717
In a lot of ways we were holding back and just playing it safe.

86
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:51,720
It would have been easy for us to make this game as a lot of the team had already made it years earlier.

87
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:55,366
We wanted to do more.

88
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,832
We wanted to embrace the bright blue sky

89
00:04:57,892 --> 00:04:59,456
and the idea of replacing New Year's Eve

90
00:04:59,476 --> 00:05:00,358
with the Fourth of July.

91
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:03,145
This is the town center that everyone has seen.

92
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:05,987
It's an impressive reveal to a city in the sky,

93
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:09,289
above those thick clouds from previous shots,

94
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:12,371
replacing clowns for founding father statues,

95
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,413
and following the idea of having horror in broad daylight.

96
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:17,074
It was a huge departure,

97
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:20,036
an idea driven by our creative director, Ken Levine,

98
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:21,957
but embraced by the entire team.

99
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:24,819
It was fresh, it was a game we needed to make,

100
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,481
and we knew that as soon as we saw the changes side by side.

101
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:39,329
It felt new. It felt like we were no longer making just a sequel, but a game that would stand out on its own, and more importantly, stand out from other Bioshock titles.

102
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,214
Even though it was the right decision, that doesn't mean it was easy at all.

103
00:05:44,674 --> 00:05:51,040
A change this big came well into development after lots of assets had been created and caused all departments to rethink.

104
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:53,602
how they were working and what their end goal would be.

105
00:05:54,362 --> 00:05:56,323
Initially, there were some hard feelings,

106
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,864
lots of cool assets were getting lost,

107
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:00,825
and everyone loved the feeling of Bioshock 1,

108
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:03,326
but it was hard to argue with the new direction.

109
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:06,187
It was more ambitious, it was refreshing,

110
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:08,808
and it challenged us to move outside of our comfort zone.

111
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,851
And a major change came with Elizabeth.

112
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:18,016
Elizabeth is arguably the game's main character,

113
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:21,297
and what the entire story of Bioshock Infinite surrounds.

114
00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:23,198
She needed to seem human,

115
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:25,398
she had to show a range of emotion,

116
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,159
and the player had to want to help her.

117
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:29,240
She needed to be interesting

118
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,060
and not feel like a burden during gameplay.

119
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,461
She was a major part of the story,

120
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:36,422
and not just a friend that you had to protect

121
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,222
from point A to B.

122
00:06:37,642 --> 00:06:39,083
She wasn't just an escort mission.

123
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:42,744
Without question, Elizabeth became the backbone of our game,

124
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:45,185
and one of the major design pillars during development.

125
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,540
That wasn't always the case.

126
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:53,102
Here you can see all of the different faces of Elizabeth.

127
00:06:53,742 --> 00:06:55,784
Many of which show up at some point during the game,

128
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:59,606
but a lot of the versions that were completely finished

129
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:01,887
that we just had to scrap because they weren't hitting the mark,

130
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:04,608
both from a narrative and aesthetic point of view.

131
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:08,290
In this section, we will touch on all these different versions

132
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:11,212
and cover the choices made along the way

133
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:13,073
to go from Gibson Girl to Femme Fatale.

134
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:22,859
Like many game companies, we start from a piece of concept art, ranging everywhere from thumbnail sketches to fully rendered illustrations.

135
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,162
Our concept artists try to convey the story we want to tell in the form of guidelines from modelers.

136
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:32,885
Just to get approval before jumping too deep into production on building a character.

137
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:42,511
In this case, our concept artists tried many different angles and the result is a more classical look for our companion character inspired by Victorian era outfits.

138
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:46,778
Our team went into putting this version of Elizabeth,

139
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:49,160
who at this time didn't even have a name,

140
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:50,561
into production.

141
00:07:53,283 --> 00:07:54,344
The model came out great,

142
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:56,706
but her purpose had entirely changed.

143
00:07:57,286 --> 00:07:59,348
The decision was made to have Elizabeth speak.

144
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,731
And though that may seem obvious now, she was originally intended to be a mute.

145
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:09,232
A quiet, mysterious character that would only show up during key moments in the game.

146
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:12,432
It became clear that this wasn't engaging to players.

147
00:08:13,153 --> 00:08:17,734
This didn't help us tell a story because, well, she didn't say anything.

148
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:22,455
Without having that dialogue, it was extremely difficult to inform players

149
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,635
and to have them interested in helping Elizabeth along her journey.

150
00:08:27,986 --> 00:08:29,847
This required us to go back to the drawing board.

151
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:32,989
Our story had evolved into a fairy tale-like arc,

152
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,593
where the player would rescue a young girl from a tower who had been there since birth.

153
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:41,876
While the purpose of that mission was dark and surrounding mature content,

154
00:08:44,346 --> 00:08:44,886
Oh, sorry.

155
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:47,048
As far as I'm concerned, on your mature content,

156
00:08:47,348 --> 00:08:48,649
the character needed to seem innocent.

157
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:51,050
She needed to seem like your help was needed

158
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,311
and that you as a player wanted to save her.

159
00:08:53,651 --> 00:08:55,412
This meant dropping the formal gown,

160
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:56,893
putting her hair down,

161
00:08:57,274 --> 00:08:58,794
and making her seem young and aloof

162
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,155
to the world outside of her prison.

163
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:07,963
We started to embrace the idea that Elizabeth was completely unaware of what acceptable fashion was.

164
00:09:08,543 --> 00:09:13,468
Wearing a nightgown and boots with a roughly cut hairstyle that she did herself.

165
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:16,451
This implied that she wasn't used to being around other people

166
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:18,973
and certainly wasn't expecting company.

167
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:21,276
The problem we realized though,

168
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:24,499
as the model was complete and functioning in game,

169
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,741
is that none of that information was obvious.

170
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:30,750
It didn't read at all. It was too obscure.

171
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,293
Out of context, she looks like she could belong in any time period.

172
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:38,096
An outfit too generic to speak to a specific time period,

173
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:40,838
not detailed enough to stand out as a major character.

174
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:43,880
When put into a crowd, Elizabeth would just disappear.

175
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:46,863
Another thing that we had to consider

176
00:09:46,883 --> 00:09:49,405
is that Elizabeth was now our main character.

177
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:52,479
She was the face of what we were doing.

178
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:55,200
She would be on posters, she'd be on game covers,

179
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,301
and hopefully be recreated in other forms of media.

180
00:09:58,842 --> 00:10:01,503
She was the face of our game, and we had to ask the question,

181
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:04,944
do we really want the face of our game to be a girl in a nightgown?

182
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:08,266
The answer was no.

183
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:11,907
We needed to push harder and create something that stood out,

184
00:10:12,368 --> 00:10:15,309
an outfit that was more iconic and unique to our title.

185
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:18,668
we had to give up details from our older versions

186
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:21,309
and just built her outfit completely from scratch.

187
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,330
This took back and forth from our concept artists

188
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,931
and modelers, trading paint overs and feedback

189
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:29,432
to really nail something special.

190
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:32,633
At this stage, we had also gotten more comfortable

191
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:35,513
with our tools and were ready to give Elizabeth more polish.

192
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:38,154
This meant developing technology just for her.

193
00:10:40,234 --> 00:10:44,136
Our team created custom shaders, implemented Apex cloth,

194
00:10:44,696 --> 00:10:48,178
authored unique textures, and took multiple passes on an animated rig

195
00:10:48,518 --> 00:10:50,019
to literally make her one of a kind.

196
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:56,602
These changes also came with the pressure of our up-and-coming reveal.

197
00:10:57,262 --> 00:11:00,404
A video of our game would be seen by the public for the very first time,

198
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:04,026
and it became all hands-on deck to make sure that it was impressive.

199
00:11:05,037 --> 00:11:12,681
Elizabeth would be front and center, showing off her abilities and giving a fairly good example of how you would interact with her during gameplay.

200
00:11:17,283 --> 00:11:30,309
Reacting to minor feedback after the reveal and addressing minor polish that we had been meaning to work on as an art team, like revising her facial features, costume tailoring, and her hair rendering, we had landed on our final Elizabeth.

201
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,491
As you can see, like I had mentioned before...

202
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,591
She broke all of the rules,

203
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:39,353
and had a budget that blew most of our assets out of the water.

204
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:44,075
A poly count almost three times higher than the average character in Bioshock Infinite.

205
00:11:44,716 --> 00:11:47,637
Skin materials and hair materials seen on no one else,

206
00:11:48,097 --> 00:11:51,679
and are tailored specifically to ideal viewing conditions just for her.

207
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:56,902
A completely unique rig for her character, with a facial rig having cinematic controls,

208
00:11:57,362 --> 00:12:00,363
and at least double the amount of draw calls as everyone else in the game.

209
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:06,687
Having these specs on every character in the game would have had our rendering engineers hating us.

210
00:12:07,387 --> 00:12:09,088
But for Elizabeth, it was necessary.

211
00:12:09,788 --> 00:12:13,189
She needed to stand out. She needed to be the best looking asset in the game.

212
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:17,750
In the end, assets were tailored around her to ensure that she looked ideal.

213
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:24,392
Lighting was revised to make her look good, and budgets were adjusted around her just to make room for her assets.

214
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:29,798
And when you compare what the final Elizabeth looks like

215
00:12:29,838 --> 00:12:31,079
compared to her initial version,

216
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,941
even in earlier test cases,

217
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:34,222
it is a night and day difference.

218
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:36,524
It took lots of days from different departments

219
00:12:36,844 --> 00:12:38,465
to get her just right, and it shows.

220
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:42,188
Embracing changes that needed to be made

221
00:12:42,248 --> 00:12:43,570
to create the best end result.

222
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:48,954
Once we had settled on our Elizabeth model,

223
00:12:49,014 --> 00:12:51,416
we felt that she was straying away from the original idea

224
00:12:51,716 --> 00:12:53,818
that she was an innocent person trapped in a tower.

225
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:58,674
The corset version of Elizabeth had all of the notes that we needed to for later in the game,

226
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:01,458
but wasn't fitting the first impression that we wanted to give.

227
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:11,509
We had to show that the character progression throughout the game and sell the story that the Elizabeth that you meet at the beginning of the game

228
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,451
isn't the same Elizabeth that you leave at the end of the game.

229
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:19,454
We decided to have different outfits represent different stages of her evolution as a character.

230
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:25,438
The first outfit would push that she was considered young and an innocent person who was unaware of the outside world.

231
00:13:26,258 --> 00:13:30,000
Our concept artist referenced children's uniforms at that time to help show the ideas

232
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:32,622
and we put into practice creating a brand new model.

233
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:37,865
This led to another problem that couldn't be predicted.

234
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:40,127
With level shifting around in the game,

235
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:42,288
areas being cut or shortened,

236
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:46,030
and key story moments being tightened throughout the game,

237
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:48,372
we realized that the Elizabeth in the corset,

238
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:51,814
the one that we had spent so much time

239
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:53,195
developing and perfecting,

240
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:56,797
was slowly taking a backseat in terms of screen time.

241
00:13:57,858 --> 00:14:00,379
The younger Elizabeth is now becoming a more major asset,

242
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,940
and not just something brief

243
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,261
that you see in the beginning of the game.

244
00:14:04,004 --> 00:14:09,127
With more attention and focus, this time we needed to spend more effort into making her asset more appealing.

245
00:14:09,628 --> 00:14:16,872
The initial take, while accurate to the clothing of the period, was looking too frumpy and almost too childish.

246
00:14:19,914 --> 00:14:26,859
After trying different color combinations and passes on trying to improve the fidelity of the model, we needed to do a complete overhaul.

247
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:33,617
Around this time, Ken had seen redesigns of Disney princesses done by an artist named Claire Hummel.

248
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:37,641
We had always considered Disney to be a great reference for Elizabeth

249
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:42,026
and wanted to capture that same sense of wonder in the designs that Claire had done.

250
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:47,748
So we just contracted her to create a design for our younger Elizabeth.

251
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:51,794
This new design had brought Elizabeth to a more relatable age,

252
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:57,543
had a cleaner color scheme, and still fell within our turn-of-the-century time period for clothing.

253
00:15:00,903 --> 00:15:04,525
With our Elizabeth assets locked down, we could focus on taking her further in other ways.

254
00:15:05,225 --> 00:15:08,987
We created damage states in each of her models that would be swapped in throughout the game.

255
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:12,688
This helped tell a smaller story and keep things fresh and interesting

256
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:16,810
and show minor progression with her changes to her model and textures

257
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:20,752
caused by things like major combat in the game,

258
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:23,973
crawling through vents or over rubble.

259
00:15:25,061 --> 00:15:27,743
We made these model swaps whenever Elizabeth went off camera,

260
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:31,626
essentially despawning one version of her and replacing her with a new version.

261
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:34,028
It helped make Elizabeth feel more alive,

262
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:38,472
and was a fairly quick thing to create that really went a long way.

263
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:44,605
Another level of polish that we added to Liz is her ability to spot things throughout the game.

264
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:49,209
Play custom animations and comment on them, on the things that she saw in the world.

265
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,813
This also involved emotional animations that would be added to her animation sets,

266
00:15:54,134 --> 00:15:58,238
which helped make Liz seem like she was reacting to the world around her.

267
00:16:01,621 --> 00:16:05,184
Finally, after we had shipped Infinite, it was time to look at DLC.

268
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:09,526
We wanted to deliver something that had been requested by fans of the franchise

269
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:13,750
and elaborate more on an alternate Rapture that had been explored in previous titles.

270
00:16:14,872 --> 00:16:17,475
This meant converting the roles for our characters from Infinite

271
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:19,577
into something more fitting for Rapture.

272
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:24,682
Namely, creating a femme fatale version of Elizabeth that would be right at home

273
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,745
in movies and pulp fiction of that time.

274
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,702
In many ways, the DLC Elizabeth is a more compressed version of the lessons we learned in the core game

275
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:35,942
that you will see in the next few slides.

276
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:43,745
We completely started from scratch and had a healthy pre-production for a time for a project of that size.

277
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:49,066
Our concept artist, George Lacera, referenced a lot of fashion from the time period

278
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:52,628
and took stabs at different takes on a femme fatale for Bioshock.

279
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:57,378
bringing in narrative, animation, and modeling into the conversation.

280
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:00,621
We wanted to settle on something that was both readable as Elizabeth,

281
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:03,583
but also reused her rig and animations from the core game.

282
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:10,836
After deciding on a concept, we moved forward to creating a new version of Elizabeth.

283
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:13,637
Once we put her into the game, we realized that,

284
00:17:14,237 --> 00:17:16,938
much like the younger version of Elizabeth, like from before,

285
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,779
she just wasn't looking right.

286
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,860
We took the idea of her being clean, dressed in white,

287
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,542
and taking lessons of makeup and lighting from that time a little too seriously.

288
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:30,643
After trying a few different tweaks, trying to polish the textures,

289
00:17:30,663 --> 00:17:34,645
and pushing the model around, we just decided to start over.

290
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:41,870
Essentially, there were just too many small things that just built up into a complete rework.

291
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:47,035
It would have taken longer to rework the character to address all of the feedback,

292
00:17:47,356 --> 00:17:49,858
rather than just recreating her costume from the ground up.

293
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:52,449
At this stage we kind of went rogue.

294
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:54,990
The concept artist, myself and Ken,

295
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,031
worked together at my desk to speed up iteration time

296
00:17:58,072 --> 00:18:00,173
and to get all the features that Ken had requested

297
00:18:00,473 --> 00:18:03,114
into the asset as well as addressing art-related bugs

298
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,335
that had been bothering us.

299
00:18:04,755 --> 00:18:07,456
Things like how her hair was rendering and sorting,

300
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:10,338
we updated her eye textures to introduce

301
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:14,440
new parallax rendering, the cut of her dress,

302
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,721
how she deformed to her predefined rig,

303
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:18,222
and things like that.

304
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,814
We decided that it was quicker just to work at the modeling stage

305
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:27,678
and review it in game since we were basically trying just to hit that last 10%.

306
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:32,342
The concept of the character was correct, it was just a matter of execution.

307
00:18:32,843 --> 00:18:37,067
This meant lots of color choices, lots of different takes on accessories,

308
00:18:37,508 --> 00:18:40,851
and generally lots of iteration on smaller details in the model.

309
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,606
Lots and lots of iteration.

310
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:47,891
So many color choices ranging from Scarlet Elizabeth

311
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,697
and trying to reuse the color scheme from the core game

312
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:54,681
and attempts to make different accessories

313
00:18:54,962 --> 00:18:56,464
to give her some kind of points of interest.

314
00:18:58,432 --> 00:19:01,557
Here you can see what the final product is that we felt as a team.

315
00:19:01,978 --> 00:19:04,842
Really nailed the feeling of a femme fatale Elizabeth.

316
00:19:04,862 --> 00:19:08,068
It was a nice translation of a popular character from our core game

317
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:10,211
into a different time period

318
00:19:10,612 --> 00:19:12,816
and different setting that was familiar to our fan base.

319
00:19:16,597 --> 00:19:19,377
In this next session, I'll be covering how a massive change in our direction

320
00:19:20,138 --> 00:19:22,558
caused us to rethink how our general population

321
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:27,040
uh... causes us to rethink our general population and how embracing a standardized

322
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,120
standardized system

323
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,021
allowed a very small team to develop assets

324
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:33,022
uh... quickly and consistently.

325
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:36,552
making better friends.

326
00:19:37,493 --> 00:19:38,653
As our art direction evolved,

327
00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:41,375
it required us to take a hard look at our general population

328
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:43,677
and how they were fitting into our changing world.

329
00:19:44,177 --> 00:19:45,838
The result was a complete facelift,

330
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,999
bringing our heavily stylized characters

331
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:49,380
from an art nouveau setting

332
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,062
to a more relatable, period-appropriate look

333
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:53,623
that you can see in the final game.

334
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:57,809
Using examples that span over four years of development,

335
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:01,853
I will show how changes such as these gave us

336
00:20:01,953 --> 00:20:03,494
more grounded characters in the world,

337
00:20:04,055 --> 00:20:06,177
a more repeatable population,

338
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:07,898
and a more consistent art style.

339
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,242
First I'm gonna take a drink though, if you don't mind.

340
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,051
The main issue we faced when deciding to move from a darker, Victorian-style environment

341
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,752
to a brighter, turn-of-the-century setting

342
00:20:28,232 --> 00:20:31,533
is that our characters no longer fit both the tone of the game

343
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:33,773
and overall visual fidelity.

344
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:36,774
Given how long the project was in development,

345
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:40,495
gradually over time it was very clear that assets

346
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:42,955
that were created at the beginning of the project

347
00:20:44,816 --> 00:20:47,677
how they look compared to the ones created about a year or two after.

348
00:20:50,405 --> 00:20:53,847
Changing our game's setting required a complete overhaul on our characters

349
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:58,430
to take them from a mutated appearance to something more relatable.

350
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:03,394
We needed to reinvent our characters to properly fit their new home

351
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:06,296
and not seem like they came from an entirely different world.

352
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:10,199
While it was always fun to make monsters

353
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:12,581
and we were happy with the work that we had originally created,

354
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:16,924
as a team we decided to start over and recreate every asset

355
00:21:16,964 --> 00:21:20,046
to support the driving art direction on the environment side.

356
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,904
Originally, we followed a model similar to Bioshock 1,

357
00:21:27,805 --> 00:21:30,267
where all civilians were actually aggressive characters

358
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:32,769
who would either attack you on sight

359
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,532
or just be doing crazy things like eating trash

360
00:21:35,572 --> 00:21:37,273
and swatting at flies that didn't exist.

361
00:21:38,154 --> 00:21:41,597
Artistically, they were very similar to splicers

362
00:21:41,657 --> 00:21:43,658
and followed a much more stylized appearance

363
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:48,242
with exaggerated proportions and overly expressive faces.

364
00:21:49,697 --> 00:21:57,983
With the change in direction, it was also decided and became pretty apparent that this world would have many repeated assets.

365
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:05,227
We were actually creating a population to live in the world, and using faces like these would have had obvious repetition.

366
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:12,892
It was very easy to pick out features on certain characters, as you can see up here, and that was a problem that we wanted to avoid.

367
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:18,072
Creating assets in this way also meant that

368
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:21,793
artists were free to model and texture however they wanted,

369
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,573
as long as the final results looked good.

370
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:27,434
The final result artistically was interesting

371
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,494
and it did look good,

372
00:22:28,975 --> 00:22:31,275
but it meant that every asset was created uniquely,

373
00:22:31,615 --> 00:22:34,576
which led to inconsistent poly counts, UV layouts,

374
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,516
and texturing everything from scratch.

375
00:22:37,216 --> 00:22:38,377
With the workload ahead of us,

376
00:22:39,397 --> 00:22:40,997
and really only having three team members,

377
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:42,758
we knew this was not sustainable.

378
00:22:45,762 --> 00:22:48,324
These assets also had unnatural proportions

379
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,526
that was more fitting in our stylized world

380
00:22:51,846 --> 00:22:53,067
than our more realistic one

381
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:54,448
that would eventually be Columbia.

382
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:58,051
Our textures were also authored in a much more painterly way

383
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:00,172
and the overall tailoring of our outfits

384
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:03,194
were both too damaged and not period-appropriate clothing.

385
00:23:03,855 --> 00:23:04,936
We really wanted to move away

386
00:23:04,976 --> 00:23:06,457
from our civilians looking crazy

387
00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:08,878
and wanted them to appear like people

388
00:23:08,898 --> 00:23:09,959
in the photos from that time.

389
00:23:14,254 --> 00:23:18,797
Much like the problems that we experienced with our civilian heads, the bodies were also very inconsistent.

390
00:23:19,638 --> 00:23:23,161
Dropping our assets into a crowd, the textures we created were so distinct

391
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:25,803
that it became very hard to repeat the characters.

392
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,826
The color choices, the patterns, and types of models were too obvious.

393
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:34,150
And even if they looked good on their own, had very obvious repetition.

394
00:23:35,105 --> 00:23:39,147
This method of working also left us with no clean way of kit bashing assets.

395
00:23:39,847 --> 00:23:42,148
Every asset was essentially created uniquely,

396
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:46,330
and it had become very difficult to reuse any amount of work from one character to another.

397
00:23:50,432 --> 00:23:55,195
We started making baby steps in terms of quality to match the environments being built in-game.

398
00:23:56,255 --> 00:23:58,296
This meant building higher detailed sculpts,

399
00:23:59,517 --> 00:24:00,918
more photorealistic textures,

400
00:24:01,578 --> 00:24:03,859
and bringing the proportions to a more realistic space.

401
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,454
These behavior setups were in the right direction, but we really needed to push it further.

402
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:15,016
This is an example of our general population at the time.

403
00:24:15,857 --> 00:24:20,799
Generally, characters were still looking very distinct, they were still too stylized,

404
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,542
and it was very easy to pick out specific heads.

405
00:24:25,562 --> 00:24:29,904
And quality-wise, we still had older assets that were just throwing off our overall look.

406
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:34,300
um, spawning characters in a test level during an art review

407
00:24:34,922 --> 00:24:37,949
and having one incredibly mutated face show up every now and then

408
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:40,554
seem more like a bug than an artistic choice.

409
00:24:43,111 --> 00:24:46,012
We're also suffering similar problems with our bodies.

410
00:24:46,872 --> 00:24:49,933
Some characters were still wearing ill-fitting dirty clothes

411
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:53,334
and the costumes were very very easy to pick out in a crowd.

412
00:24:54,554 --> 00:24:56,135
These also became distracting.

413
00:24:56,715 --> 00:24:57,935
In Bioshock games the

414
00:24:58,356 --> 00:25:01,937
environment is generally an explorable area that we wanted players to experience

415
00:25:02,777 --> 00:25:04,797
and having characters stand out too much

416
00:25:05,658 --> 00:25:06,758
just drew too much attention

417
00:25:06,778 --> 00:25:08,939
rather than having them fade into the background.

418
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:12,340
So it was becoming a pretty big problem.

419
00:25:15,275 --> 00:25:18,337
The solution to these problems was to create a universal system.

420
00:25:18,797 --> 00:25:22,280
This meant creating a base character that all future characters would be derived from.

421
00:25:22,861 --> 00:25:26,103
Our heads had shared topology, UVs, and facial rigs.

422
00:25:27,244 --> 00:25:32,508
This allowed us to rig heads in more or less one click of a button,

423
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:34,329
share elements of textures easily,

424
00:25:34,689 --> 00:25:37,652
and reuse elements of the models from one character to another.

425
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,844
By establishing these constants throughout the game,

426
00:25:41,184 --> 00:25:42,867
it was easier to make swooping changes

427
00:25:42,887 --> 00:25:45,951
and to control the overall quality of our assets in game.

428
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:51,873
This workflow had us working mostly in ZBrush.

429
00:25:53,154 --> 00:25:54,636
By having a scope that we could pull from

430
00:25:54,656 --> 00:25:57,518
that had our universal vert order and UV layout,

431
00:25:57,578 --> 00:26:00,901
we could basically drop it down to the lowest subdivision level,

432
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:02,242
press a button,

433
00:26:02,882 --> 00:26:06,745
and have it rigged asset ready to go in Unreal pretty quickly.

434
00:26:07,586 --> 00:26:09,628
By having a shared asset that we pulled from,

435
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:11,890
it also allowed us to work much quicker

436
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,492
and also establish an expected final result

437
00:26:14,732 --> 00:26:16,333
that was easy to compare new assets to.

438
00:26:17,263 --> 00:26:21,686
Rather than taking a shot in the dark and trying to have assets match a loosely defined style,

439
00:26:22,086 --> 00:26:26,469
we had a very strong foundation that served as a quality bar artistically and technically.

440
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:27,770
It set a standard.

441
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:32,613
By changing to this workflow, it also removed most of the tedious work from our day-to-day jobs.

442
00:26:33,714 --> 00:26:35,375
By not needing to unwrap every head...

443
00:26:35,923 --> 00:26:39,605
create every low-poly model, and create a unique facial rig for every head,

444
00:26:40,025 --> 00:26:43,206
we could focus on making art and pushing the quality of our work.

445
00:26:44,007 --> 00:26:46,668
By establishing rules, it actually gave us more freedom.

446
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:50,069
Defining restrictions, what we could and couldn't do,

447
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:53,950
it allowed us to focus on quality and keep what was under the hood consistent.

448
00:26:57,972 --> 00:27:02,274
As the world expanded and certain scenes in the game were developed,

449
00:27:02,614 --> 00:27:04,595
the need for larger crowds became stronger.

450
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,612
We needed cheap assets to fill up areas.

451
00:27:08,453 --> 00:27:11,756
Our general population assets were correct and looking great,

452
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:17,142
but the amount of joints, verts, and loaded textures on screen were too much for consoles to handle.

453
00:27:17,663 --> 00:27:21,727
The solution was to create cheaper versions of these assets that had limitations.

454
00:27:22,646 --> 00:27:28,371
Essentially making much lower vertex counts, heads, and bodies baked down into just one material,

455
00:27:28,671 --> 00:27:31,634
and a heavily reduced rig, and no artificial intelligence.

456
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:33,776
We took to calling these characters chumps.

457
00:27:34,877 --> 00:27:37,639
A really dumbed down version of our main character assets.

458
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,285
These assets were surface transfers, and basically an LOD of our major assets.

459
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:49,710
Over time though, these characters were put more under the spotlight

460
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,711
and their quality just wasn't holding up at all.

461
00:27:55,413 --> 00:28:00,115
And to give us one last push to reach a desired quality level, a strike team was formed.

462
00:28:02,061 --> 00:28:06,164
to tackle a large chunk of our town center level and bring it to a final version.

463
00:28:06,744 --> 00:28:11,168
This involved all disciplines and art working together on a specific area.

464
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:15,551
Character, concept, environment art banded together to set an exemplar

465
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:17,673
for what following assets would live up to.

466
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:23,404
In this area, our crowd assets, or our chomps,

467
00:28:23,724 --> 00:28:26,126
were a big focus for the character department.

468
00:28:27,127 --> 00:28:28,527
To improve the quality of our assets,

469
00:28:28,547 --> 00:28:31,249
we developed sets of characters per level.

470
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,051
Rather than cramming a bunch of characters

471
00:28:34,531 --> 00:28:37,393
onto a retrofitted texture sheet like before,

472
00:28:38,714 --> 00:28:41,216
we created characters in a modular way

473
00:28:41,256 --> 00:28:42,757
with the intention that they would be repeated

474
00:28:43,077 --> 00:28:44,038
a lot throughout the game.

475
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:49,202
These assets became easier to manage as there were just fewer pieces to update

476
00:28:49,582 --> 00:28:52,907
and generally cheaper because they were purposely made to share single assets

477
00:28:53,307 --> 00:28:54,649
across at least four characters.

478
00:28:59,263 --> 00:29:05,188
Another friendly character, or characters, that came up during development were the Lutece twins.

479
00:29:06,248 --> 00:29:10,652
It's interesting to think that these characters started off as just a name,

480
00:29:11,392 --> 00:29:13,994
just a brand, and something that you never actually saw,

481
00:29:14,415 --> 00:29:16,857
but turned out to be one of the most popular characters in the game.

482
00:29:17,837 --> 00:29:20,740
The original direction for these characters is that they were identical.

483
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,022
They were literally the same asset,

484
00:29:23,402 --> 00:29:25,884
but one had a beard and the other one was in a dress.

485
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:29,148
Obviously, this is a horrible idea.

486
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:32,490
It was one of those ideas that seemed fine on paper,

487
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,372
but just looked bizarre in practice.

488
00:29:35,452 --> 00:29:36,753
The information wasn't reading,

489
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:39,595
and instead just gave us two characters that looked...

490
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:41,896
off, basically.

491
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:45,359
With the importance of this character increasing,

492
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:49,001
and wanting to move this asset into the quality of our main characters,

493
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:50,462
we needed another pass.

494
00:29:53,237 --> 00:29:57,680
We decided to contact Claire Hummel again, since she did such an amazing job on Elizabeth.

495
00:29:58,341 --> 00:30:01,964
We wanted to apply the same lessons we learned there and apply it to these set of characters.

496
00:30:02,504 --> 00:30:06,208
And it was a huge success. The new version took a more simplified costume,

497
00:30:07,008 --> 00:30:12,253
made bolder choices with the tailoring, and had great similarities that implied these characters belong together.

498
00:30:15,752 --> 00:30:19,776
And finally, to ensure that we delivered a game with the highest quality possible,

499
00:30:20,497 --> 00:30:22,339
I booked at least a month of polish time

500
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:25,702
for my team to get one final pass on the characters in the game.

501
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:31,134
Over time, like I mentioned before, we developed techniques that improved our assets

502
00:30:31,494 --> 00:30:34,817
and left some assets needing to be brought up to a desired quality level.

503
00:30:35,897 --> 00:30:39,520
We had developed techniques for baking in subtle lighting information,

504
00:30:39,981 --> 00:30:43,664
corrected topology, and weighting methods that gave us better deformations.

505
00:30:44,264 --> 00:30:48,608
Having this time allowed us to make sure that every asset had this exact same treatment.

506
00:30:51,825 --> 00:30:56,767
And now some pretty staggering before and after images of our characters.

507
00:30:58,188 --> 00:31:00,929
Most of these are from our initial push to drop stylization

508
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,750
compared to the final asset.

509
00:31:03,091 --> 00:31:05,492
So it's about a two-year difference.

510
00:31:06,592 --> 00:31:10,134
Here you can see one of our Asian civilians that was part of our general population.

511
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:16,302
and this is one of our Caucasian civilians seen in Columbia.

512
00:31:17,683 --> 00:31:19,545
Many of our civilians from the Finkton area,

513
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:21,848
which is shown in a teaser video,

514
00:31:22,528 --> 00:31:24,070
were pushed almost too far

515
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,792
into looking comedically poor.

516
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,956
Eventually we pulled back and made this information more subtle.

517
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:36,523
This asset shows the process from beginning to end,

518
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:39,205
one of our dockworker assets.

519
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:43,848
Oddly enough, this is the first and last character

520
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,549
that I worked on in the project.

521
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:47,870
Having started with a burly,

522
00:31:48,431 --> 00:31:51,513
start-up character that involved a more period-appropriate,

523
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:55,095
just repeatable dockworker that properly fit into Columbia.

524
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:09,639
And finally, an example of how one of our female civilians changed from a more fantastical, unrealistic outfit into something much more cleaner and period appropriate.

525
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,444
For a lot of our civilian outfits, we actually looked towards the 1920s for tailoring.

526
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:19,209
Even though it was out of our time period, the style of the 1920s were creeping into the late 1910s.

527
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,652
This meant that better fitting clothes and more interesting colors and patterns.

528
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:29,214
And here you can see us going from a completely made up outfit on the left

529
00:32:29,554 --> 00:32:33,195
to something more Victorian and then something more Edwardian.

530
00:32:36,077 --> 00:32:40,018
In this last section, we cover my favorite characters from Bioshock Infinite.

531
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:44,040
This is the Vox Populi and the Founders Combat AI.

532
00:32:50,471 --> 00:32:54,072
At Irrational, we greatly improved the appearance of our combat AI characters,

533
00:32:54,592 --> 00:32:56,693
from Bioshock 1 to Bioshock Infinite.

534
00:32:57,493 --> 00:33:01,775
After collaborating with our designers, we were forced to rethink how we handle character art

535
00:33:02,215 --> 00:33:03,315
and a combat scenario.

536
00:33:04,295 --> 00:33:07,657
This often required new models, re-evaluating silhouette,

537
00:33:08,457 --> 00:33:10,157
the importance of color between factions,

538
00:33:10,457 --> 00:33:13,358
and a tiered armor system unique to Bioshock Infinite.

539
00:33:16,587 --> 00:33:18,468
Initially, there were no factions.

540
00:33:19,268 --> 00:33:23,090
Our characters were literally splicers in a Victorian setting.

541
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:26,252
They wore regular torn-up clothes.

542
00:33:26,733 --> 00:33:27,913
They were heavily mutated.

543
00:33:28,754 --> 00:33:31,996
The first concept, as you can see here,

544
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:34,918
is that everyone was against you.

545
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:37,379
So every character you met was trying to kill you.

546
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,999
As we populated the world with regular people,

547
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,921
and the story behind Columbia and its struggle developed,

548
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:48,402
we really needed to split who was trying to kill you

549
00:33:49,002 --> 00:33:50,042
from who just wanted to talk.

550
00:33:51,023 --> 00:33:52,643
This forced us to start thinking about

551
00:33:52,723 --> 00:33:54,284
who enforced the rules of Columbia,

552
00:33:54,584 --> 00:33:56,265
who was trying to stop you on your mission,

553
00:33:56,605 --> 00:33:58,146
and how to break them away from the crowd.

554
00:34:01,627 --> 00:34:03,488
The combat system in Bioshock Infinite

555
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:06,149
challenged our team in a way no other project before it had.

556
00:34:07,158 --> 00:34:12,162
Though you still had plasmids and guns under the hood, it was a completely different game.

557
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:18,026
In Bioshock Infinite, we had actual roles within factions, and both needed to be defined.

558
00:34:18,727 --> 00:34:23,210
You needed to be able to pick out the shotgun guy from the machine gun guy, and they needed

559
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,293
to stand out from civilians so that you could easily detect a threat.

560
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:33,476
Infinite also had huge draw distances that required us to create characters that were more noticeable from a distance,

561
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:41,305
and given how many different types of characters were on screen, required us to share assets and overall proportions.

562
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:53,723
Initially we followed the same system as Bioshock 1 had and tried to apply the mindset to these requirements for Bioshock Infinite.

563
00:34:54,544 --> 00:35:00,007
We found that the idea of anyone being anyone is horribly flawed and just confusing.

564
00:35:00,627 --> 00:35:09,812
If any character can pull out a gun and kill you, not only is it confusing, but you're constantly on edge and never really told when the combat begins or ends.

565
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:15,032
which really fought against the idea of us wanting you to explore the city of Columbia.

566
00:35:15,972 --> 00:35:19,294
Technically, we also tried following the same path as Bioshock 1

567
00:35:19,794 --> 00:35:23,475
by manually placing each and every character as a unique asset.

568
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,681
Placing these characters also became very tedious and hard to iterate on.

569
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,903
Essentially, every spawner needed to be manually placed.

570
00:35:34,623 --> 00:35:39,105
Once that spawner was placed, an artist or designer would need to access its properties

571
00:35:39,425 --> 00:35:41,106
and point it to the correct skeletal mesh.

572
00:35:42,327 --> 00:35:47,189
While this may have worked on Bioshock 1, it quickly became too much to handle in Infinite.

573
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,591
It was nearly impossible to control what assets showed up where,

574
00:35:51,171 --> 00:35:54,553
where assets were being referenced and left a ton of room for human error.

575
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,342
To make this process easier, we developed an override system.

576
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:03,845
The override was assigned per asset

577
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:06,567
and had a drop-down box that had a list of options.

578
00:36:07,768 --> 00:36:10,890
These options were defined by artists that referenced the list of characters.

579
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:15,654
By doing this, designers could just select what kind of character they wanted it to be

580
00:36:16,314 --> 00:36:21,478
and we, as artists, populated what the character would look like.

581
00:36:25,536 --> 00:36:27,957
This means we only needed to update one asset,

582
00:36:28,037 --> 00:36:29,338
and it updated throughout the game,

583
00:36:29,538 --> 00:36:33,601
rather than making sure each spawner was referencing the correct asset.

584
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:36,322
This also made randomization automatic.

585
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,443
If there was more than one option in the list,

586
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,845
rather than having each spawner manually tweaked

587
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,225
to be different from the one next to it,

588
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:46,708
the problem that this exposed, though,

589
00:36:46,728 --> 00:36:50,610
is that Unreal stores all of the model and texture information

590
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,172
into memory before choosing which one to render.

591
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:54,612
Meaning...

592
00:36:56,366 --> 00:36:59,709
The base match that we were originally trying to replace,

593
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:02,251
or that we had on the spawner and would be replacing,

594
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:03,191
was stored into memory.

595
00:37:03,211 --> 00:37:05,553
And then the one replacing it

596
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:07,855
and all of its alternative options

597
00:37:08,195 --> 00:37:09,296
were also stored into memory.

598
00:37:10,017 --> 00:37:11,898
Together, this made one combat character

599
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:14,180
cost nearly as much as a main character.

600
00:37:15,521 --> 00:37:16,642
The solution to this problem.

601
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:19,110
was the wrong box.

602
00:37:19,991 --> 00:37:24,479
Every base mesh in the game is a giant pink cube with a placeholder texture

603
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:26,001
that costs virtually nothing.

604
00:37:26,863 --> 00:37:30,329
It shares the same rig as all of our base humans in order to bring in animations.

605
00:37:31,194 --> 00:37:33,255
since that was a requirement for the actual override.

606
00:37:33,636 --> 00:37:34,796
But other than that, it's practically free.

607
00:37:35,677 --> 00:37:40,339
This meant that all we were ever paying for is the asset being referenced in the override.

608
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,701
If an override wasn't present,

609
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:46,823
the giant box would appear and let you know that something had gone horribly wrong

610
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:48,924
and that an override needed to be assigned.

611
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,361
Our combat characters weren't just bullet sponges.

612
00:37:55,221 --> 00:37:57,662
They were also a big part in telling the story of Columbia.

613
00:37:58,822 --> 00:38:02,663
This world wasn't just civilians with people who had a chip on their shoulder.

614
00:38:03,163 --> 00:38:04,983
They needed a military force to protect them

615
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,664
and the ideals of Comstock, the city's leader.

616
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,544
Even though they shared the same rig as our civilians,

617
00:38:10,964 --> 00:38:14,465
having a uniform that they wore as well as having a unique headset

618
00:38:15,145 --> 00:38:16,926
that was only ever used on aggressive characters

619
00:38:17,386 --> 00:38:20,487
really helped us define what a threat would look like in the game.

620
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:27,852
Another challenge we faced on Infinite that was completely new to our team

621
00:38:27,992 --> 00:38:29,672
was the introduction of a second faction.

622
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:35,114
Early on, we had known that there would be someone else that you fight,

623
00:38:35,534 --> 00:38:39,014
but had no idea what that would be exactly.

624
00:38:39,855 --> 00:38:42,495
We asked ourselves who these characters were,

625
00:38:42,515 --> 00:38:46,116
and the answer was a faction that rebels against the founders

626
00:38:46,436 --> 00:38:48,577
and symbolizes the voice of the working class.

627
00:38:48,977 --> 00:38:50,037
It was the Vox Populi.

628
00:38:51,032 --> 00:38:54,217
Much like the founders, they had to stand out from the civilians in the area.

629
00:38:54,658 --> 00:38:56,460
Rather than creating a uniform for them though,

630
00:38:57,342 --> 00:38:59,926
we decked them out in military gear from the time

631
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:02,129
and used color as a visual language.

632
00:39:03,436 --> 00:39:04,617
for the factions that you were fighting.

633
00:39:05,238 --> 00:39:07,500
Blue generally symbolized the Founders' faction

634
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,762
and red symbolized the Vox Populi.

635
00:39:10,702 --> 00:39:14,025
By using colors in this way and keeping them consistent,

636
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:17,548
it helped to inform the player who was a threat and who was not.

637
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:21,652
So, for example, a civilian would never be wearing a red shirt

638
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:25,595
and were generally kept away from those colors and left in a more neutral area.

639
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:37,014
During the completion of Infinite, we pushed really hard as a team to deliver the product that we wanted to.

640
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:41,258
In this push, we had lots of feedback from focus testing,

641
00:39:41,698 --> 00:39:44,501
and decided that we really needed to push our combat characters further.

642
00:39:45,242 --> 00:39:49,485
We needed to show progression more clearly, and to find tougher enemies from the weaker ones.

643
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:57,733
Working directly with my art director, we created new combat characters in a freeform way.

644
00:39:57,833 --> 00:40:02,196
Time was definitely a factor at this point, so we just worked at the model level.

645
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:06,258
Looking at elements that worked on older passes...

646
00:40:07,681 --> 00:40:11,264
on the models and also wanted to preserve ones from the higher level characters.

647
00:40:12,085 --> 00:40:15,267
The result was to create three tiers per combat role per faction.

648
00:40:16,068 --> 00:40:17,949
Due to how many of these characters are on screen

649
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,391
and given how pressed for time we were,

650
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:23,293
we ended up sharing a lot of elements between characters.

651
00:40:24,294 --> 00:40:25,675
Using Unreal's attachment system,

652
00:40:26,035 --> 00:40:28,898
we added fully rigged armor that was built over a base model

653
00:40:29,158 --> 00:40:30,859
and unique head attachments per tier.

654
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,960
Since we were only ever adding attachments,

655
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,981
the major cost came from the base mesh,

656
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:39,421
and each armor set was added on top of that,

657
00:40:39,441 --> 00:40:41,762
rather than loading in and rendering

658
00:40:41,782 --> 00:40:43,942
three completely unique body assets.

659
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:50,483
Here you can see working examples of the system in place.

660
00:40:50,943 --> 00:40:52,704
It's three completely unique assets

661
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:54,724
that heavily relied on kitbashing

662
00:40:55,144 --> 00:40:57,125
and the sharing of assets to speed up workflow.

663
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:05,950
And here you can see the opposing faction using a similar process just in their own style.

664
00:41:06,751 --> 00:41:11,232
After exploring the Vox Populi more, we were able to really have fun with their designs.

665
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:17,434
These characters were contrasted against the uniform, standardized nature of the founders,

666
00:41:17,454 --> 00:41:19,415
and were able to create their own costumes,

667
00:41:20,155 --> 00:41:23,596
using the idea that these characters fought their way up to the top

668
00:41:23,896 --> 00:41:25,977
and purposely wanted to be scary and violent.

669
00:41:26,377 --> 00:41:28,978
We covered them in red paint, gave them devil horns,

670
00:41:29,538 --> 00:41:31,439
and more torn up elements to their outfits.

671
00:41:32,664 --> 00:41:36,665
Not only did it just look cool, it also really helped show the difference between the two factions.

672
00:41:40,066 --> 00:41:42,667
Another element to our combat system was the idea of heavy hitters.

673
00:41:43,527 --> 00:41:49,408
These characters way back in the dark, cloudy Flapshire setting were originally just going to be flying big daddies.

674
00:41:50,249 --> 00:41:54,450
While that is still a great idea, it fit more with what we wanted Songbird to be.

675
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:58,531
These characters needed to be obvious threats in the combat scenario.

676
00:41:59,231 --> 00:42:02,132
Sometimes towering over a crowd and easy to identify.

677
00:42:03,623 --> 00:42:09,888
These elements also had their own rule set and unique versions per faction, their own rigs and higher budgets.

678
00:42:10,768 --> 00:42:14,731
They were more fantastical and were designed to purposely be action figures,

679
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:19,134
which made us ask if we would want this character sitting on our desk.

680
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:24,138
A lesson we learned during development was to take a step back

681
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:26,880
and look at every character we have in a line.

682
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,961
Does it show clear progression?

683
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:31,203
Can you easily identify one character from another?

684
00:42:31,223 --> 00:42:34,345
This led us to create what we were calling a dinosaur chart.

685
00:42:34,965 --> 00:42:39,088
It was a huge image that we actually had printed and posted in the office

686
00:42:39,409 --> 00:42:40,049
right at my desk

687
00:42:40,449 --> 00:42:43,131
that showed every enemy you would ever encounter in the game

688
00:42:43,412 --> 00:42:44,973
and how they stacked up against one another.

689
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:49,468
This allowed us to really have a bird's eye view and not work in a bubble.

690
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:52,889
After having our heads down for so long,

691
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:57,451
it was easy to focus on characters in a specific area rather than seeing the big picture.

692
00:42:58,211 --> 00:43:01,152
By doing this, it also helped us pick out problems across the board

693
00:43:01,492 --> 00:43:04,193
and tweak assets until they all reach a consistent quality level.

694
00:43:08,193 --> 00:43:12,354
In these next few shots you can see the end result of a lot of iteration on our characters.

695
00:43:13,255 --> 00:43:16,835
Imagine how the game would have looked if we had stuck with our original plan.

696
00:43:17,275 --> 00:43:20,216
You can see characters that fit properly into the world that we had created.

697
00:43:21,096 --> 00:43:24,537
More relatable characters that seem like they had chosen to defend against you

698
00:43:24,557 --> 00:43:26,637
rather than just being plain old crazy.

699
00:43:28,878 --> 00:43:31,938
Clearly defined threats with specific roles in combat

700
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:34,679
and tier level of difficulty throughout the game.

701
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:41,202
and a second faction of enemies that were clearly different

702
00:43:41,762 --> 00:43:43,664
from the characters you encountered earlier in the game.

703
00:43:44,685 --> 00:43:46,887
It took iteration, multiple passes,

704
00:43:47,328 --> 00:43:49,630
and a hard look at what we had in the game to make it right.

705
00:43:50,071 --> 00:43:52,673
Sometimes tough, painful choices.

706
00:43:53,194 --> 00:43:55,015
It meant throwing away work that we had done,

707
00:43:55,316 --> 00:43:57,598
in some cases we're happy with and proud of

708
00:43:57,918 --> 00:43:59,400
for the greater good of the project.

709
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,262
In the end, game development is a team sport.

710
00:44:03,663 --> 00:44:08,224
It isn't about personal statements and what individual assets you can point to and say mine.

711
00:44:08,704 --> 00:44:11,485
It's about delivering the best possible product as a whole.

712
00:44:11,945 --> 00:44:14,826
Fulfilling the needs of the team with high quality work.

713
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,726
Even if that means changing the work that you personally loved.

714
00:44:17,746 --> 00:44:22,708
I hope that these examples prove that we as artists cannot be married to our work

715
00:44:23,068 --> 00:44:26,989
and the ability to adapt to change and drop any personal attachment

716
00:44:27,389 --> 00:44:29,609
and embrace the organic growth of development over time

717
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:32,790
as a necessary step in creating the best product possible.

718
00:44:33,558 --> 00:44:38,361
not only for a AAA development, but for indie developers, student projects, and personal work as well.

719
00:44:39,021 --> 00:44:40,022
Be honest with yourself.

720
00:44:40,422 --> 00:44:42,944
Look at how your work contributes to the game as a whole,

721
00:44:43,344 --> 00:44:46,026
and put the needs of the project before your own personal preference.

722
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:53,470
After reviewing these examples, I want you to go back to work, back to your school projects,

723
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:58,713
personal projects or mods, if that's even still a thing, with these lessons in mind.

724
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:02,369
You will lose work, but you're not wasting your time.

725
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:06,254
Just because your own work ends up getting thrown away,

726
00:45:06,274 --> 00:45:07,756
it doesn't mean that it was a complete failure.

727
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:10,019
Even the thrown away work is contributing

728
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:12,001
to a bigger, better end result.

729
00:45:13,704 --> 00:45:16,107
Not every contribution needs to be in the shipping game,

730
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,330
and no one expects that all of your work will be perfect.

731
00:45:19,512 --> 00:45:21,174
To be blunt, get used to it.

732
00:45:21,674 --> 00:45:24,838
It happens to everyone, on every project, no matter what the size.

733
00:45:25,258 --> 00:45:30,565
On Bioshock Infinite, the estimate is that we created around three games worth of content.

734
00:45:30,925 --> 00:45:34,750
And that could sting, but the end result is something better because of it.

735
00:45:37,436 --> 00:45:39,757
Also, making games is a team sport.

736
00:45:40,377 --> 00:45:41,217
Never forget this.

737
00:45:41,497 --> 00:45:43,478
This is possibly one of the most beautiful things

738
00:45:43,518 --> 00:45:44,298
about our industry.

739
00:45:44,718 --> 00:45:47,539
There are many moving parts with all sorts of disciplines.

740
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:50,460
Moving at the same time, racing to the final goal,

741
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,760
but we're doing it together.

742
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,641
Other departments rely on you

743
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:55,841
just as much as you rely on them,

744
00:45:56,361 --> 00:45:58,722
and it is important to respect that level of communication

745
00:45:58,982 --> 00:46:00,903
and expect back and forth between departments.

746
00:46:03,443 --> 00:46:05,844
Account for change in quality over time.

747
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:12,727
Every project, from the smallest personal project to the largest AAA blockbuster, will have a range of quality in it.

748
00:46:13,248 --> 00:46:17,451
At the beginning of the project, you're getting the feel for it. You want to see what works.

749
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:22,876
As you get better, and everything is moving around you, the art that you did months or years ago will look worse.

750
00:46:23,316 --> 00:46:30,682
You can try to polish it as you see it, but by doing that, you'll either spin your wheels, or end up in the exact same situation months down the road.

751
00:46:31,865 --> 00:46:33,106
Block out time for polish.

752
00:46:33,586 --> 00:46:38,509
Give yourself and your team one last chance to send out their work out the door and be proud of it.

753
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:42,872
Finally, great ideas happen naturally.

754
00:46:43,352 --> 00:46:44,133
During development...

755
00:46:44,956 --> 00:46:49,858
It is very common for fun things to happen naturally through playtesting and experimentation.

756
00:46:50,498 --> 00:46:52,179
Fun is what makes a great game.

757
00:46:52,219 --> 00:46:56,020
It is our job as production artists to try and let those things happen.

758
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,841
We are in a creative industry.

759
00:46:57,861 --> 00:47:03,983
It would be incredibly boring and tedious if you sat down five years ago and planned out every detail.

760
00:47:04,463 --> 00:47:07,024
Be patient and be part of the upcoming changes.

761
00:47:07,544 --> 00:47:08,984
Encourage your team to be creative.

762
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:11,645
Enable them to let awesome things happen.

763
00:47:12,806 --> 00:47:12,946
So.

764
00:47:14,262 --> 00:47:18,726
When the combat designer comes to you and says that the player will be ripping off heads with a giant hook,

765
00:47:19,146 --> 00:47:21,068
you put in the extra time to make some meaty bits.

766
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:24,051
And...

767
00:47:25,552 --> 00:47:26,052
I am...

768
00:47:27,173 --> 00:47:27,414
done.

769
00:47:28,635 --> 00:47:29,396
So, thank you.

770
00:47:37,853 --> 00:47:40,557
So you guys can like line up for questions if you have them.

771
00:47:40,577 --> 00:47:43,682
I actually have a few infinite Steam codes

772
00:47:44,163 --> 00:47:45,745
for the first two people to ask me questions.

773
00:47:47,268 --> 00:47:49,731
Willing to just hand them out, just come up to me after the talk.

774
00:47:50,893 --> 00:47:52,696
And also...

775
00:47:53,803 --> 00:47:58,347
having just won a visual arts award.

776
00:47:58,367 --> 00:48:00,769
That's one of the points, each of the team that's responsible for it.

777
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:06,714
This would be all of our Twitter using art members from Bioshock Infinite.

778
00:48:06,754 --> 00:48:10,176
So, be sure to hit them up and aggravate them for me.

779
00:48:16,912 --> 00:48:23,013
So when you guys outsourced Claire was she just a concept or does she do the concept and the 3d?

780
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:29,855
For the new characters like Elizabeth and the twins. She just did the the concept art. She was like a remote artist that did

781
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:33,176
Combat designs and basically went through the whole process

782
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:38,858
With her so like starting with like thumbnail sketches, and then like the final like rendered things she actually went a little bit

783
00:48:39,698 --> 00:48:43,619
Overboard with it and did like more breakdowns on how costumes from that time

784
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:47,056
worked and really helped our models.

785
00:48:47,076 --> 00:48:47,697
But we did it all.

786
00:48:47,957 --> 00:48:50,020
We did the modeling all in-house.

787
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,061
Okay, cool.

788
00:48:51,081 --> 00:48:51,682
Cool, thank you.

789
00:48:52,783 --> 00:48:56,768
Can you talk at all about any kind of iteration

790
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:59,292
in terms of shader and material stuff,

791
00:48:59,392 --> 00:49:02,095
considering your original art style is so different

792
00:49:02,115 --> 00:49:03,958
from the lighting situation that you ended up with?

793
00:49:04,438 --> 00:49:11,544
Yeah, we actually originally started with just like an out of the box like Unreal Shader, Unreal 3.

794
00:49:12,725 --> 00:49:15,727
And eventually converted into a physically based rendering setup.

795
00:49:16,107 --> 00:49:21,151
So we actually like completely gutted our entire material breakdown.

796
00:49:21,411 --> 00:49:26,034
And it's something that's more like the metalness setup that you've probably seen online.

797
00:49:26,054 --> 00:49:30,537
But before that it was like a traditional, you know, spec diffused normal kind of thing.

798
00:49:30,898 --> 00:49:32,679
And like moved over to like PBR about...

799
00:49:33,864 --> 00:49:35,587
About like a year and a half before finishing.

800
00:49:35,607 --> 00:49:36,168
So.

801
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:37,430
Yeah.

802
00:49:40,836 --> 00:49:41,978
What would you do differently?

803
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:42,820
What's that?

804
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,823
What would you do differently if you had to do it over again?

805
00:49:45,965 --> 00:49:47,428
Um to speed up the iteration.

806
00:49:48,312 --> 00:49:51,815
The speed of iteration, I think I would have

807
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:54,837
put in the standardized system a lot earlier.

808
00:49:55,558 --> 00:49:59,021
I think even with the heavily stylized setting,

809
00:49:59,461 --> 00:50:02,203
we still could have done it and still had

810
00:50:03,044 --> 00:50:07,127
that kind of look, but with just a more constant thing that you could predict.

811
00:50:07,567 --> 00:50:11,030
I think we held on to unique assets a little bit too long

812
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:13,532
that caused problems that we could have avoided.

813
00:50:14,373 --> 00:50:15,894
Did you notice there was a lot of burnout

814
00:50:16,594 --> 00:50:17,735
because of all the iteration?

815
00:50:18,256 --> 00:50:47,452
No. I mean, you know, we're all kind of on board for it. You know, like, redoing, like, main characters over and over again. It can get to you. But, you know, it's for the greater good. And we all, we were all, sorry I got like a light right in my face. But we were all like, we were all on board for it. And all of like the decisions were like communicated. And it made sense. And in the end, you know, it's like hard to argue with, right?

816
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,712
Right, yeah, absolutely.

817
00:50:48,872 --> 00:50:49,132
Thank you.

818
00:50:49,392 --> 00:50:49,593
Yep.

819
00:50:52,336 --> 00:50:55,019
Given the themes and the time period of the game,

820
00:50:56,681 --> 00:50:58,142
when you guys were approaching design

821
00:50:58,162 --> 00:51:00,845
of some of the more racist or hateful imagery,

822
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:03,609
did you have to tone that back and keep control?

823
00:51:03,629 --> 00:51:06,011
Or how did you approach that, knowing that you

824
00:51:06,031 --> 00:51:06,972
had a broad audience?

825
00:51:09,012 --> 00:51:15,435
Well, I mean, you know, like a lot of games were generally were made up of a group of people from different backgrounds and stuff like that.

826
00:51:17,276 --> 00:51:22,899
So, you know, we all had it like internal feedback on whether or not it was a good idea to go forward or not.

827
00:51:22,939 --> 00:51:28,122
We have, there were some things that we pulled back on that, you know, hasn't been revealed and things like that.

828
00:51:28,142 --> 00:51:30,463
Like some original ideas that I'm not going to say here.

829
00:51:30,663 --> 00:51:36,667
But, you know, there's some things that you just try it and just, you know, totally if it's working or not.

830
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:37,847
It's like, wow, that's too much.

831
00:51:39,233 --> 00:51:40,473
you know, you kind of pull back.

832
00:51:40,874 --> 00:51:42,815
I have examples, but I'm on camera,

833
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:43,795
so I'm not going to say that.

834
00:51:43,815 --> 00:51:46,136
I'm not going to say that.

835
00:51:46,556 --> 00:51:46,816
Thanks.

836
00:51:49,618 --> 00:51:50,338
Oh, hey.

837
00:51:50,538 --> 00:51:51,058
Hi, hello.

838
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:56,581
I was wondering, with all the iterations in the art you made,

839
00:51:58,042 --> 00:52:00,083
when you were planning the project in time,

840
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,704
did you go over it, you know, like...

841
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:08,323
Wait, you were over... Sorry, my English is not that good.

842
00:52:08,343 --> 00:52:09,003
No, it's fine.

843
00:52:09,464 --> 00:52:09,644
And...

844
00:52:11,325 --> 00:52:14,487
In the time schedule, with all the iterations, you were overtime?

845
00:52:15,347 --> 00:52:18,989
Oh, well, we ended up doing, like, crunch towards the end of the project.

846
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:23,472
But I wouldn't say that it was because of iteration.

847
00:52:23,592 --> 00:52:28,374
It's just more of a, you know, I mean, new characters came online that we had to push for,

848
00:52:28,434 --> 00:52:30,876
and like, pushing for, like, overall quality, but not...

849
00:52:31,299 --> 00:52:34,362
not through iteration. We generally scheduled for that.

850
00:52:34,422 --> 00:52:36,384
So if you're making something, and it's like,

851
00:52:36,404 --> 00:52:37,605
well, we've got to rework Liz,

852
00:52:37,705 --> 00:52:39,507
it's like, I'm just going to block out like two weeks

853
00:52:39,567 --> 00:52:42,149
to bang out another Liz, basically.

854
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:43,651
Okay. Thank you.

855
00:52:46,293 --> 00:52:47,314
Okay.

856
00:52:47,354 --> 00:52:48,616
So, with the shared facial rig,

857
00:52:48,936 --> 00:52:50,517
did you find that you were limited creatively

858
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,600
in making different characters or...

859
00:52:54,968 --> 00:53:01,553
Well, I mean, for us, generally, like, the shared facial rig was for all of, like, our human characters.

860
00:53:01,573 --> 00:53:03,195
So there's only so far that you go, right?

861
00:53:03,255 --> 00:53:03,995
And, like, everything was, um...

862
00:53:05,703 --> 00:53:09,646
you know, like generally shared over like male and female kind of thing.

863
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:13,488
So we didn't really go too far, like too far out.

864
00:53:13,928 --> 00:53:15,249
We probably could have had more constants.

865
00:53:15,289 --> 00:53:17,930
So like our eye positions and stuff like that probably could have been,

866
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:21,232
you know, consistent throughout people and things like that.

867
00:53:21,252 --> 00:53:23,934
But it wasn't like super limiting

868
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:27,055
just because of like our art style wasn't wasn't wild.

869
00:53:27,075 --> 00:53:30,157
Like you didn't have a guy with like a giant, giant head versus like

870
00:53:30,437 --> 00:53:33,459
super skinny head kind of thing and anything that required.

871
00:53:34,189 --> 00:53:41,734
like I knew, like Liz basically had like her own facial rig and like Daisy had her own and stuff

872
00:53:41,754 --> 00:53:46,557
like that so anything that required it we ended up breaking off but they were usually like anything

873
00:53:46,577 --> 00:53:50,500
that was out of the system so anything that was like a hero character or like super special

874
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,162
got that treatment. So you think it was helpful?

875
00:53:53,518 --> 00:53:56,339
that you had a limitation so you wouldn't go crazy stylized.

876
00:53:56,779 --> 00:54:01,481
Yeah, I mean I think at first there might be some whining,

877
00:54:01,681 --> 00:54:04,862
I guess, about having restrictions put on you.

878
00:54:05,222 --> 00:54:06,762
But once you define those guidelines,

879
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:09,303
you actually have more freedom to work within them.

880
00:54:09,724 --> 00:54:12,084
So you have an established budget,

881
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:14,685
established workflow.

882
00:54:17,046 --> 00:54:19,888
final, you know, look to your art and stuff.

883
00:54:20,188 --> 00:54:22,810
And within that you can just like focus on making art

884
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:24,891
versus like, I'm gonna try that.

885
00:54:25,071 --> 00:54:25,751
Oh, that didn't work.

886
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:26,792
I just wasted time.

887
00:54:26,812 --> 00:54:27,792
Now I'm working extra.

888
00:54:27,812 --> 00:54:28,433
You know what I mean?

889
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:30,394
So it's kind of like freedom,

890
00:54:30,674 --> 00:54:32,395
freedom through restriction, I suppose.

891
00:54:32,455 --> 00:54:32,555
Cool.

892
00:54:32,575 --> 00:54:33,236
All right, thank you.

893
00:54:33,476 --> 00:54:33,776
Thank you.

894
00:54:33,796 --> 00:54:36,457
All right.

895
00:54:37,158 --> 00:54:39,339
All right, go for it.

896
00:54:41,323 --> 00:54:50,568
So from what I understand, I wonder, in the presentation was that, I guess, while you were working on the characters, there were being changes made to the story, and I guess new important characters being added.

897
00:54:51,008 --> 00:54:54,410
Did you find that that was like a real challenge, I guess?

898
00:54:55,090 --> 00:55:08,318
Um, no, we generally like, we would have like script changes that, I mean, just the way that I would try to have like the team working is that they would be working on things that, like if the script changed, it would be weeks down the road.

899
00:55:08,518 --> 00:55:09,518
So trying to avoid.

900
00:55:10,143 --> 00:55:15,166
you know, having somebody working on something and then the day, like a day after it's cut or changed or something like that.

901
00:55:15,586 --> 00:55:22,691
So, uh, trying to avoid that as much as possible and kind of having like a block in your schedule moving with, uh,

902
00:55:23,271 --> 00:55:28,174
with writing. So it'd be like a cascading kind of, uh, kind of deal to prevent that pain.

903
00:55:29,395 --> 00:55:29,895
Thanks.

904
00:55:33,862 --> 00:55:39,946
So the technical solutions you come up with to overcome some of the production problems,

905
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:43,148
how do you start initiating for those changes?

906
00:55:44,129 --> 00:55:47,471
Do you just like sit down with like a production person and say,

907
00:55:47,832 --> 00:55:51,274
here's a problem and you start fixing it? How do you start?

908
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:52,955
Yeah, I mean, generally, um...

909
00:55:54,713 --> 00:56:00,177
like the department heads like in our company would generally be communicating all the time.

910
00:56:00,337 --> 00:56:08,303
So like me and like the like character TD like shader artists and things like that would be

911
00:56:08,663 --> 00:56:12,746
like talking in the same room to make sure that we're all on board and we'd have like actual

912
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:17,069
production people to help us with scheduling to make sure that we weren't dreaming up something

913
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:20,671
that just wasn't feasible. So it was like a.

914
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:22,689
It was pretty organic.

915
00:56:22,729 --> 00:56:25,170
I mean, it was pretty easy to get changes done,

916
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,952
just that we had to rely on communication a lot.

917
00:56:28,032 --> 00:56:31,994
So, if I ended up wanting to change something,

918
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:34,736
I would talk to the character TD

919
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:37,457
and make sure that that was possible,

920
00:56:37,497 --> 00:56:40,759
like adding bones or changing our universal weighting

921
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:41,439
and things like that.

922
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:42,900
Thanks.

923
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:43,300
Cool.

924
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:47,062
I think that's it.

925
00:56:49,143 --> 00:56:50,384
All right, thank you.

926
00:56:50,644 --> 00:56:50,924
Thank you.
