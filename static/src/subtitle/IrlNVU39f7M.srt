1
00:00:02,862 --> 00:00:08,891
Hey everybody, how's it going? My name is Colin Foran, and today we are here to talk about the Westworld VR experience.

2
00:00:09,572 --> 00:00:12,436
I've kind of crammed a lot in here, so I think the time's going to get a little tight.

3
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:16,102
Just wanted to let everybody know that we'll be hanging out outside if anyone has any questions,

4
00:00:16,302 --> 00:00:18,024
and otherwise I'm just going to try to punch through it.

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,762
My name is Colin Foran and I'm the creative lead for an internal HBO team that prototypes interactive experiences.

6
00:00:28,622 --> 00:00:32,683
My background is in art and design, first in concept art, art direction, and now creative direction.

7
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:37,265
The HBO Interactive team is around 15 team members, all from a wide range of backgrounds.

8
00:00:37,925 --> 00:00:40,086
We're a combination of artists, designers, and engineers.

9
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:45,147
The team has game experience from the indie through AAA space, movies, enterprise software, and so on.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,302
The Westworld VR Project is a really interesting cross-pollination between the game and film

11
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:54,583
industries. This talk will broadly explore the issues that we encountered and how we

12
00:00:54,623 --> 00:00:59,665
used a combination of design and tech tools to get past them. But first, some quick background.

13
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:04,247
When the HBO Interactive team was formed around three years ago, the task was figure out what's

14
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:08,869
going to be interesting and then go make it. It was a very experimental, fail fast, learn

15
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,170
fast team with an explicit focus on narrative. It was very important to us.

16
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:20,693
Our jobs were to identify cool tech coming down the pipe, bang on it for a little while, and build up a little production expertise to have ready when a showrunner approached us with an idea.

17
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:25,695
That led to a lot of greyboxing, test shoots, and demos across a handful of platforms.

18
00:01:27,136 --> 00:01:31,237
Engines and tech, not strictly VR, but always with a focus on storytelling potential.

19
00:01:31,997 --> 00:01:36,219
We were plugged into the development scene in Seattle where we were able to get our hands on VR prototypes pretty early.

20
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:46,005
During that period, we were doing a lot with navigation, scale, tethered, untethered, stylization versus realism, showing player body, all the usual suspects that I'm sure will be familiar to everyone in here.

21
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:52,388
At the same time, we were building relationships with the showrunner staff and getting up to speed on how the rest of HBO's content is produced.

22
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,032
Different productions are siloed from one another, so we spent a lot of our early days banging on doors and introducing ourselves to people.

23
00:01:58,947 --> 00:02:02,450
That turned into months of roadshows, showcasing our early demos and VR work.

24
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,872
We call it VRpalooza, and that started around December of 2014.

25
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,875
We found a show-don't-tell approach worked best,

26
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:12,557
so our demos started looking pretty sophisticated.

27
00:02:13,237 --> 00:02:16,179
Not quite vertical slices, but with a certain degree of polish for sure.

28
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:22,538
We had a broad range of people and partners and were able to drum up a lot of internal interest around HBO's potential spin on VR,

29
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:25,721
specifically trying to advance the state of character-based storytelling.

30
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:29,445
But we knew a lot of thought had to go into the stories that would feel appropriate to the platform.

31
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:33,729
After a final round of internal demos, we were encouraged to meet with the Westworld showrunners.

32
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:37,093
We met Jonah Nolan and Lisa Joy in June of 2015.

33
00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:41,156
They explained that the series would be about having your perceptions manipulated

34
00:02:41,236 --> 00:02:43,578
and the effects that could have on a person in a controlled environment.

35
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:47,360
The idea of doing that from a first-person perspective was fascinating to everyone

36
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,982
and the pitch came together fairly quickly.

37
00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:52,104
That kicked off about a year's worth of focused prototyping and development.

38
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:55,247
That started a surprisingly open working relationship.

39
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:57,730
Throughout development, we worked closely with the show's

40
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,972
writers, production staff, and the show runners themselves to

41
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:01,013
ensure we were making something

42
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:02,174
interesting and true to the show.

43
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,337
Now we needed to figure out what we wanted to make.

44
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:05,818
So what is it?

45
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:11,217
Westworld VR is a multi-format, room-scale, destination experience in three-ish parts,

46
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:13,399
with a strong focus on narrative and character.

47
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:16,661
We debuted the experience at TechCrunch shortly before the show premiered.

48
00:03:17,402 --> 00:03:21,725
It combines room-scale real-time content, 360 video, physical props,

49
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:24,467
and an in-universe physical build-out staffed by actors.

50
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:30,291
The story itself was written with the Westworld showrunners and writing staff and created interesting challenges for the team to tease out.

51
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:36,234
Meaningful character interaction in VR, onset 360 capture that progressed the story and felt true to the show,

52
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:42,799
as well as traditionally difficult film set challenges like, for example, micing naked actors doing stunt shoots.

53
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:49,643
Any one of those on their own would be challenging and combining them in a way that felt coherent and really contributed to the story made it even more so.

54
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:51,805
So let me walk you through the user experience.

55
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:55,927
The user is greeted by actors at an in-universe Delos pop-up

56
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:56,508
installation.

57
00:03:56,748 --> 00:03:58,929
They create a reservation and spend some time chatting with

58
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:59,409
the actors.

59
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:02,410
When the reservation is ready, they're taken to a back room

60
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,611
staffed by Delos tech personnel to gear up and

61
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:05,032
headset.

62
00:04:06,532 --> 00:04:08,953
Once they're acclimated to the equipment using an in-headset

63
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:10,894
lobby area, they're transported to the Delos

64
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:13,596
dressing room and greeted by a park host that they had chosen

65
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:15,016
earlier during the reservation.

66
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:17,538
The host is preserved throughout the duration of the

67
00:04:17,578 --> 00:04:18,018
experience.

68
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:21,810
After the user gets some brief narrative background,

69
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,871
the rules of the park and selects a weapon,

70
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:27,293
they transition into the interior of the park itself.

71
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:30,295
A little more background is sprinkled

72
00:04:30,315 --> 00:04:31,635
into the conversation with the host

73
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:34,137
and the user gets to do some light exploration of the space

74
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:35,998
as well as some shooting.

75
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,360
A quest giver NPC appears.

76
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,141
In the fiction of the show, it's the sheriff

77
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:43,502
and he attempts to enlist the user's help

78
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:45,023
to track down Hector Escaton.

79
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:48,872
Mid-delivery, a fly, which will be familiar to viewers of

80
00:04:48,892 --> 00:04:51,338
this show, lands on the sheriff's face, triggering an

81
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:52,541
error in the host programming.

82
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,688
They turn homicidal, executing your host, and

83
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:56,730
eventually turning on you.

84
00:04:58,283 --> 00:05:01,987
The player wakes up to a semi-conscious state surrounded by lab techs and equipment, where

85
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:03,648
they're urged to sit down in a physical chair.

86
00:05:04,108 --> 00:05:08,932
This abstract chapter serves as our transition from real-time to 360 content, and then the

87
00:05:08,972 --> 00:05:11,815
corresponding transition from fully interactive to zero interactivity.

88
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:16,338
Finally they awaken in the Delos lab, revealing that they are, in fact, hosts themselves.

89
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:21,503
After being wheeled through the lab, their companion host wakes up, attacking their captors

90
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:24,745
and imploring the user to remember what has happened before all kinds of horrible things

91
00:05:24,765 --> 00:05:25,046
happen.

92
00:05:25,486 --> 00:05:26,106
And it's lights out.

93
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:31,657
It was also a test to see how effectively HBO Interactive and the Westworld production teams could mesh pipelines.

94
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:36,439
This wasn't simply two production teams sharing assets, this was a fundamental meshing of working styles.

95
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:40,440
Writers, actors, asset creators, and producers all learning to speak the same language.

96
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,661
Interactive tools and their advantages are foreign to many of the production teams, because of course they are, they're different industries.

97
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:52,123
Most of our group comes from AAA gaming, and so we had a responsibility to educate and show by example what these technologies could do.

98
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:55,192
High-end game and show productions are very different,

99
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:57,574
but there's enough of a shared vocabulary with slightly

100
00:05:57,614 --> 00:05:59,635
different meanings that it's easy for misunderstandings to

101
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:00,055
pop up.

102
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:02,537
So what were we trying to accomplish?

103
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:05,078
This isn't a comprehensive list, but an idea of what we

104
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:05,599
were aiming for.

105
00:06:06,653 --> 00:06:08,734
What are questions that, if left unanswered, could

106
00:06:08,794 --> 00:06:10,854
compromise our ability to work with future showrunners?

107
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:13,655
For me, this was a vehicle to show that the technology was

108
00:06:13,695 --> 00:06:15,455
ready for mature, complicated stories.

109
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,176
People needed to look at it as an example and have no doubt

110
00:06:18,216 --> 00:06:19,316
that, yes, they could tell their

111
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:20,417
stories using this medium.

112
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:22,917
But that's actually a pretty ambitious statement.

113
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:25,078
There are a ton of things wrapped up in that concept.

114
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:27,738
I tried to imagine questions coming from the showrunners.

115
00:06:28,158 --> 00:06:29,679
Can I put one of my actors in this thing?

116
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:31,139
Can they give a meaningful performance?

117
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:32,139
How do I move around?

118
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:34,260
I know that I can't force people to look at what I want

119
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,140
them to, so prove to me that that doesn't matter.

120
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:39,781
Anything we could do to prepare ourselves for future meetings and speak with confidence.

121
00:06:41,464 --> 00:06:43,685
At a high level, it was simply building production confidence.

122
00:06:44,046 --> 00:06:46,328
Based on our experiments, we could project outward and say

123
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:47,869
that we could make some of this stuff.

124
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:50,071
But there was nothing that we could point to definitively

125
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,252
and say, it'll be like that.

126
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:52,893
We had to build up a ton of trust.

127
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:55,435
We also needed to test our game design theories in a

128
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:56,296
production environment.

129
00:06:56,756 --> 00:06:58,198
Not to belabor the point, but remember, these

130
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,038
were the early days.

131
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:01,180
We were past the point of knowing that, yes, we could

132
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,201
technically do something.

133
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:04,223
But from a narrative perspective, should we?

134
00:07:04,763 --> 00:07:06,665
The team was excited to roll these disparate demos and

135
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:08,446
experiments into something that felt significant.

136
00:07:08,987 --> 00:07:11,148
We got a ton of mileage out of our gray box work, but this

137
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:12,669
was a chance to really stress our ideas.

138
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:15,190
There's a lot to try, from navigation, affordance,

139
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,531
chapter length, transition intensity, and so on.

140
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:20,513
We certainly weren't the first to be thinking about these

141
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,554
ideas, but we had never seen an experience that put them

142
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:23,854
all together in the way that we wanted.

143
00:07:24,715 --> 00:07:26,736
We also wanted a gesture towards what a high production

144
00:07:26,756 --> 00:07:29,297
value experience could look like by using design tricks

145
00:07:29,337 --> 00:07:31,278
and misdirection to punch above our weight a little bit.

146
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:33,820
We were a small team attempting to show what a

147
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,220
larger team could potentially do.

148
00:07:38,354 --> 00:07:40,255
From an environment art standpoint, that meant working

149
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:42,315
hard to imply that there was more of a world to explore

150
00:07:42,355 --> 00:07:44,496
just around the corner, or to use dramatic lighting and

151
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:46,977
suggest more mystery and depth while obscuring our

152
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:47,877
production limitations.

153
00:07:48,837 --> 00:07:51,118
We had similar ideas on the character side, that if users

154
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:53,179
tested an interaction with a character, they would get a

155
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,279
response implying that there was a ton of robustness behind

156
00:07:55,299 --> 00:07:55,799
that character.

157
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,440
If I tried to shoot my host, for example, they would

158
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,480
acknowledge it and respond.

159
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:01,861
But there's only so far you can walk down that road before

160
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:02,962
hitting production limitations.

161
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,471
Which is a good time for an aside, the first of many.

162
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:08,772
Know what you're making and for whom.

163
00:08:09,312 --> 00:08:11,213
You'll hear me say this a few more times, but I think it's

164
00:08:11,253 --> 00:08:13,954
important to take away, or it's an important takeaway that we

165
00:08:13,974 --> 00:08:14,934
only learned with hindsight.

166
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:17,695
In the example I just gave, we spent a huge amount of time

167
00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:20,196
designing response trees to every possible interaction,

168
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:21,337
which is a cool idea.

169
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:23,858
But we were making a destination-based experience

170
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,779
that people could only realistically go through once.

171
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:28,180
If we had accepted that sooner, we could have saved

172
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,960
ourselves a ton of production time that might have been

173
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:31,441
invested elsewhere.

174
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:34,442
You can still do service to that idea in a more shallow way,

175
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:36,083
but without totally over committing your team.

176
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:37,984
That is the end of the first aside.

177
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:40,185
Narrative goals.

178
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:42,106
We knew we wanted the characters to acknowledge and

179
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,387
respond to you, but in a way that didn't torpedo the story

180
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:46,969
or cause users to go into the antagonistic, how do I break

181
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:47,409
this mode.

182
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:48,689
And pacing.

183
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:50,811
We wanted a slow reveal that would build over time and

184
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,832
really land the emotional impact in our third act.

185
00:08:53,272 --> 00:08:55,113
Could we actually control the spooling out of the narrative

186
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:55,913
in a way that made sense?

187
00:08:56,493 --> 00:08:58,895
It's kind of sort of related to the how do we get them to

188
00:08:58,915 --> 00:08:59,795
look where we want problem.

189
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,399
And also, could we build a narrative that stood on its own without knowledge of the show?

190
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:06,942
Remember, we were launching before the first season, so we couldn't take any shortcuts.

191
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:10,206
Add to that that the story was attempting to feel disorienting intentionally.

192
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:14,210
So tech, can we play with the format and medium to

193
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,691
exaggerate shifts in perception?

194
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,673
Can we utilize real-time video and pre-rendered CGI in a way

195
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:20,235
that feels purposefully disorienting?

196
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:22,877
Putting a handful of ingredients into a bowl does

197
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:23,538
not make soup.

198
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:24,959
It needed to be coherent.

199
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,461
This one felt very high risk, high reward.

200
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:29,663
We didn't want to proclaim that real-time or video was

201
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:32,685
the definitive future of VR, but rather that they were both

202
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:33,586
tools in a toolbox.

203
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,421
Similarly, can we play with real world objects?

204
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:39,043
Is adding one more thing just going to confuse the story?

205
00:09:39,823 --> 00:09:41,684
After running through a few prototypes that experimented

206
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:44,286
with the idea, we knew we wanted physical interactions.

207
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:46,588
But it had to be in a way that adhered to the spirit of the

208
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:47,808
show, same as the last point.

209
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,670
It had to feel coherent and no gimmicks.

210
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,191
Can we rely on interactions and room scale?

211
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:54,032
Remember, these are the early days.

212
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:56,134
There was a lot of design conversation around how to

213
00:09:56,174 --> 00:09:58,215
build an experience that wouldn't completely stall out

214
00:09:58,255 --> 00:09:58,916
if the tech failed.

215
00:09:59,676 --> 00:10:04,439
In the end, the polished hardware got us where we wanted to go, but there was some doubt in the beginning and we had to design against it.

216
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,941
And performance. It's an oldie but a goodie.

217
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:10,984
This was a constant issue. Hitting frame rate was a nightmare for a long time.

218
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:15,347
The platform was being developed while we were trying to lock things down and it added a lot of uncertainty.

219
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:22,832
The ability to solve for performance issues by dropping more hardware into the box was absolutely a motivating factor when we decided to become a destination-based experience.

220
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,001
With those goals in mind, I wanted to run you through the

221
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,803
project pillars that we established at the beginning

222
00:10:28,823 --> 00:10:30,684
of the project to codify what we were talking about.

223
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:32,666
It's a little dry, but I think they're important.

224
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:35,936
Humanistic, convincing real-time character interaction.

225
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:39,458
Emphasis on performance with a seamless blending of reaction to player input.

226
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:44,320
Expressive, nuanced facial performance that encourages an emotional connection between characters and the user.

227
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,022
Mature storytelling that acknowledges and embraces the potential of the medium.

228
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:52,924
We strive to advance the state of the art, combining and enhancing real-time and recorded content.

229
00:10:53,464 --> 00:10:55,906
Our viewers leave having felt unsettled and transported.

230
00:10:56,606 --> 00:10:59,348
Interactive reinforces the connection with characters and

231
00:10:59,368 --> 00:10:59,709
narrative.

232
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:02,011
Within that rule, a user's agency in the real-time

233
00:11:02,051 --> 00:11:04,212
environment corresponds to real-world expectations.

234
00:11:04,813 --> 00:11:06,454
We are not staging a play in front of the user.

235
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:09,137
We are embracing presence to transport them to a convincing

236
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:10,378
location that responds to them.

237
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,180
We are always faithful to the Westworld story as defined by

238
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:13,861
the writing team.

239
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:14,921
That comes up later.

240
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:17,864
Headset-centric content creation on the production

241
00:11:17,904 --> 00:11:20,126
side, thoughtfully target fidelity to an

242
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:21,247
asset or video's use.

243
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:23,889
Asset detail increases or falls off with proximity to

244
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:24,249
the player.

245
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,790
And sets our stage to maintain viewer interest.

246
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,431
As much as possible, we don't author or capture detail that

247
00:11:29,451 --> 00:11:30,431
will be lost in the headset.

248
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:33,012
Within the limitations of our hardware, we are targeting

249
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:35,312
realistic real-time scenes and high-definition video

250
00:11:35,332 --> 00:11:38,573
capture, all of which sounds very obvious, but at the time

251
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:39,293
we struggled with it.

252
00:11:40,673 --> 00:11:41,253
So how did it go?

253
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:42,654
What landed and what didn't?

254
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,254
Before we touch on anything else, we need to start with

255
00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:46,875
communication.

256
00:11:47,788 --> 00:11:50,111
One principle we continually return to was delivering in

257
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:51,193
the spirit of the request.

258
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:53,416
There were times that, because of our lack of shared

259
00:11:53,436 --> 00:11:55,459
vocabulary, the showrunners would ask for something that

260
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:56,761
would completely freak out our team.

261
00:11:57,362 --> 00:11:59,304
It was important during those moments to step back and say,

262
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:01,788
all right, we know we can't literally do this thing, but

263
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:03,310
how can we deliver in the spirit of the thing?

264
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:09,535
The best example of this was a request from the writers to have users manhandled by lab techs during the transition from interactive to video,

265
00:12:10,015 --> 00:12:12,116
actually having an actor tech force you into a seat.

266
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:18,140
That was a non-starter for a handful of reasons, but it was important to dig into the emotional response that they were searching for with that request.

267
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:22,603
The idea of uncertainty or helplessness was absolutely appropriate for the story at that point.

268
00:12:23,063 --> 00:12:28,827
We were able to target that in a way that respected user comfort in the overall safety contract the user has with the people running the installation.

269
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:32,758
Similarly, there were a handful of times where our

270
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:34,299
production wires simply got crossed.

271
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:36,740
A request would come in, for example, to change an outfit.

272
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,740
As an art lead, my mind went immediately to a game-centric

273
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,741
pipeline ramification mode.

274
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:43,922
How could I explain that if we took the time to change an

275
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:45,962
outfit, none of our characters would have hair because the

276
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:48,783
same artist was responsible for both, when in reality, the

277
00:12:48,823 --> 00:12:51,164
comment may simply be, the characters are looking kind of

278
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,825
samey, which is totally valid and much simpler to fix.

279
00:12:54,285 --> 00:12:55,705
Tweak some color blocking, and you're good to go.

280
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,853
And frankly, the show staff are very, very smart people.

281
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:01,117
They have great ideas and knew the source content way better

282
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:01,879
than we ever could.

283
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,384
If you get too caught up in production minutia, you risk

284
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,247
missing out on some really interesting ideas.

285
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,271
Aside number two.

286
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,673
A challenge we had early on was the show defining real.

287
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:14,174
Real on this platform is a pretty loaded word.

288
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:18,797
I'm sure most of the people in this room equate real with a feeling of presence that we haven't seen in games before.

289
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:20,618
Real for the show meant video.

290
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:25,502
It was the truest possible representation of an actor's performance, which was the most important thing that they wanted to preserve.

291
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:30,545
There was also a feeling that no matter how good our assets looked, they would never look as good as the real footage.

292
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:33,349
We actually did a fair amount of R&D before committing to

293
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:34,190
real-time characters.

294
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:35,632
We did a handful of experiments around

295
00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:37,615
stereoscopic billboards and volumetric video.

296
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:39,898
But there were issues around hitting the quality level we

297
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:41,019
were looking for in the various

298
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:42,080
performance considerations.

299
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:44,664
It was really track controllers that won the day

300
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:45,164
for real-time.

301
00:13:46,187 --> 00:13:49,550
We had to spend a lot of time making the case that internal consistency in an environment

302
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,312
was more important than surface level fidelity.

303
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:55,516
If we dropped a prerecorded stereo billboard into a real-time scene, it wouldn't matter

304
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:58,799
that the performance you captured was more real, it wouldn't cohese with the rest of

305
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:00,801
the scene and only serve to pull you out of the experience.

306
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:03,964
But that brings us back to working towards the spirit of the request.

307
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,766
What they were after was nuanced, humanistic performance.

308
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:10,049
Once we proved we could do that within the limitations of the platform, we had them on

309
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,290
board.

310
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,731
That's not to say we didn't find a ton of value in

311
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,551
experimenting, though.

312
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:15,372
We did a lot of experimentation around

313
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:17,533
different ways to get video into the experience, but

314
00:14:17,553 --> 00:14:19,233
that's when you need the production discipline to say,

315
00:14:19,353 --> 00:14:20,654
no, let's revisit the pillars.

316
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:23,215
The billboard environments we did were cool, and there was

317
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:25,316
probably a satisfying Westworld experience in there

318
00:14:25,336 --> 00:14:27,496
somewhere, but in the context of our pillars, they just

319
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:28,617
weren't right for the experience.

320
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:31,458
That, I know it might not work, but let's try it anyway

321
00:14:31,498 --> 00:14:33,879
to see if anything interesting falls out, is a very cool way

322
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,399
to work, if not a little spooky from a

323
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:36,220
production perspective.

324
00:14:37,912 --> 00:14:39,673
So with that out of the way, we can talk nuts and bolts.

325
00:14:40,273 --> 00:14:42,294
Our interactive pipeline would be familiar to anyone here.

326
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:45,135
Storyboarding, concept art, modeling, PBR texturing,

327
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,895
integration into the engine, so on and so on.

328
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:49,576
The only real hiccup here was recalibrating to our fairly

329
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:50,797
aggressive hardware limitations.

330
00:14:51,377 --> 00:14:53,037
We tried to get around that by building out beautiful

331
00:14:53,077 --> 00:14:55,278
corners and vertical slices to aggressively zero in on

332
00:14:55,318 --> 00:14:56,179
appropriate fidelity.

333
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,479
It takes a little bit longer in the beginning, but it's

334
00:14:58,499 --> 00:14:58,919
worth doing.

335
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,280
If things got too heavy, they got triaged out.

336
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,252
Digital doubles and their blends were hand sculpted.

337
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:07,754
I did not write a what I would do differently section,

338
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:10,777
but if I did, I would say that we would almost certainly use scans going forward.

339
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:13,219
It was a significant production hit.

340
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,623
In general, quality increased over time as Epic made continual optimizations to the engine.

341
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:22,427
Props and environments went through a familiar process, concept, model, texture, etc.

342
00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:26,587
There are a lot of interesting design conversations around what to keep faithful to reality and

343
00:15:26,607 --> 00:15:29,409
what to exaggerate for the sake of drama or wow factor in VR.

344
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:34,291
In the case of this revolver, it's like this big, but it feels cooler to feel in the headset.

345
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:37,272
Some more environment art.

346
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:40,973
Some more VFX dev look.

347
00:15:43,584 --> 00:15:45,647
Animation was our long pole and would continue to cause

348
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:46,688
headaches throughout the production.

349
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:49,231
We used mocap for face and bodies and continually

350
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:50,933
struggled with how to incorporate edits from the

351
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:53,035
show writers as well as achieve a humanistic feeling

352
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:54,096
of interactivity with the hosts.

353
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:55,918
One always seemed to damage the other.

354
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:58,000
And there are two elements to that, I think.

355
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:00,728
One was our trying to build in more animation robustness

356
00:16:00,748 --> 00:16:01,248
than we needed.

357
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:03,269
That goes back to the know what it is you're making

358
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:04,009
point from earlier.

359
00:16:04,749 --> 00:16:06,270
The other was not having a solid solution for

360
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,891
incorporating notes and feedback from the performance

361
00:16:08,911 --> 00:16:09,351
from the show.

362
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:12,393
Our desire to show, not tell for the writers was directly

363
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:13,693
at odds with our mocap pipeline.

364
00:16:14,153 --> 00:16:16,094
We were able to fake it a little bit with hand animation,

365
00:16:16,294 --> 00:16:18,756
asset store assets, and in-house grungy mocap, but

366
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:19,736
that only got us so far.

367
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:22,117
We wouldn't be able to really evaluate our performances

368
00:16:22,157 --> 00:16:23,298
until fairly late in the project.

369
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:25,009
And I don't know a way around that.

370
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,791
We did loads of storyboarding and block out and headset, but

371
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:29,653
sometimes you just can't make a call until you see it.

372
00:16:30,593 --> 00:16:32,095
A similar thing can be said for ADR.

373
00:16:32,415 --> 00:16:33,936
There were certain bits of dialogue we just couldn't

374
00:16:33,956 --> 00:16:35,617
evaluate until we heard it all in context.

375
00:16:36,158 --> 00:16:38,299
We should have planned for the need to do a full ADR session

376
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:39,921
from the beginning, but we let it surprise us.

377
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,622
And I think that's my takeaway from the whole thing.

378
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,544
In the end, we over-engineered some things while allowing

379
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:45,885
ourselves to be surprised by others.

380
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:48,567
Anecdote time again.

381
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:51,970
Bandits versus Sheriff, aggressively cutting things

382
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:52,510
that don't work.

383
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:55,974
Originally, you had the user attacked by two bandits that

384
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:58,255
rode onto the bluff, menaced the roadhouse, and murdered

385
00:16:58,275 --> 00:16:58,715
the players.

386
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,136
We wanted to capitalize on scenes from the show.

387
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:03,657
A user would point their gun at the bandits, fire, and

388
00:17:03,697 --> 00:17:04,357
nothing would happen.

389
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,418
That was originally the point at which the user would

390
00:17:06,438 --> 00:17:07,978
understand that they were, in fact, a host.

391
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,859
Bandits felt like a satisfying mission setup, but it was

392
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:11,640
confusing to people.

393
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,120
Why couldn't I shoot the bandits?

394
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,321
Did I do something wrong?

395
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:16,421
I tried reloading the gun, and it would let me, et cetera,

396
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:16,781
et cetera.

397
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:21,923
The bandits weren't working and no matter how many small tweaks or adjustments we made we couldn't get them to read correctly.

398
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:23,703
So we did a script rewrite and cut them.

399
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:25,984
We replaced them with our kindly sheriff.

400
00:17:26,564 --> 00:17:28,665
Whether people recognize the character from the show or not,

401
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:33,886
we could rely on the symbol of a sheriff and the benevolence implied there to more clearly convey the state change to the viewer

402
00:17:33,906 --> 00:17:35,046
when the fly lands on his face.

403
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:39,948
It was really challenging to cut that much content, especially the mocap,

404
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:42,148
from the experience, but it had to be done for clarity's sake.

405
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:45,024
Affordance.

406
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,905
We spent a lot of time throughout the project

407
00:17:46,945 --> 00:17:49,067
developing a strategy around the dividing line between

408
00:17:49,107 --> 00:17:51,769
traditional game UX and game design object interaction.

409
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,952
There was a lot of design and conversation around gamey user

410
00:17:54,972 --> 00:17:57,114
communication, like glowing outlines on interactive

411
00:17:57,194 --> 00:17:59,135
objects versus trying to keep things discoverable.

412
00:17:59,764 --> 00:18:02,305
In the end, we tried for physical where possible, but

413
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:04,487
if an interaction was worse without explicit call-outs,

414
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:05,608
then we would put them in.

415
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:08,010
I wish it was cleaner than that, but there you go.

416
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,032
Another benefit of the experience as a destination is

417
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:13,073
that we had total control over the user experience.

418
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:15,515
It didn't end up happening, but if we ever got into a

419
00:18:15,535 --> 00:18:17,777
situation where someone simply wasn't getting an interaction

420
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,399
or becoming stuck, we knew we had the actors available to

421
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:22,400
provide feedback or guidance through a microphone.

422
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,042
That kept us from having to rely too heavily on voiceover,

423
00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:26,163
text overlay, et cetera.

424
00:18:27,778 --> 00:18:30,398
In the headset or it doesn't count.

425
00:18:30,838 --> 00:18:33,019
It was kind of incredible how often we would land on a design

426
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,439
idea that we were totally confident in, only to have it

427
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,780
fall down once it was in the headset.

428
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,460
That also taught us not to get too precious with our ideas.

429
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,320
If the wine is bad, spit it out.

430
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:44,261
That applied to the general environment layout as well.

431
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:46,961
We spent a lot of time with a variety of gray box testing

432
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:48,542
whether or not an environment should match the show

433
00:18:48,602 --> 00:18:50,902
perfectly or be altered drastically to meet the

434
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,003
physical borders of the play volume, or be some

435
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:53,783
combination of the two.

436
00:18:54,981 --> 00:18:56,542
And in general, we struggled with affordance.

437
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:58,984
We had the general design challenge of wanting items to

438
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:00,826
behave as you'd expect them to in the real world.

439
00:19:01,326 --> 00:19:03,208
We were able to solve for a lot of that by keeping things

440
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,530
just out of reach and implying that they could be interacted

441
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:05,710
with.

442
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:08,713
I worried about that approach early on, but people bought

443
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:09,794
into it without any problems.

444
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:15,384
The chute. Our chute took place on location in the Delos lab set.

445
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:19,549
I don't think I've ever seen a location more hostile to the idea of a 360 chute.

446
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:27,220
Rectilinear patterns everywhere, nested reflected surfaces, tight corridors, and dramatic lighting all promise to make stitching and processing a nightmare.

447
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:31,562
Thankfully, we had the support of Spherica for capture and processing, and the Westworld

448
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:33,484
production team for set support on the data chute.

449
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:37,610
Of course, lighting, sound, and blocking all had to be approached differently, and watching

450
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,094
the department leads solve these problems, often for the first time, was very impressive.

451
00:19:41,936 --> 00:19:43,097
Sometimes we just had to improvise.

452
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:45,959
For this shoot, we didn't hire a director of photography.

453
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,820
Rather, I was on set explaining what we needed

454
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,721
different elements of the shot to do, and then we blocked the

455
00:19:49,741 --> 00:19:50,381
set accordingly.

456
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,082
They came together, but some issues were more difficult to

457
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:53,783
address than others.

458
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:56,864
For example, we had to move Video Village off set, but due

459
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,285
to the range, the monitors we were using continually ran in

460
00:19:59,325 --> 00:20:00,426
a wireless signal drop-off.

461
00:20:00,986 --> 00:20:02,967
Eventually, we were able to duct tape a solution together,

462
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,128
but it's those sorts of issues you won't see coming until

463
00:20:05,148 --> 00:20:05,768
you're in the middle of it.

464
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:13,204
The group had done a lot of experimentation with mono and stereo 360 video before, but this was on a totally different scale.

465
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:18,947
We spent a ton of time both before and on the day of the rehearsals experimenting with single shots, crossfades, and so on.

466
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:22,948
We were terrified of introducing nausea, but in the end we were being too conservative.

467
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:26,390
Eventually the director made a hard push for the one long continuous shot.

468
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:28,714
with all of the turns involved with that.

469
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:31,515
We were spooked, but found that if you were gradual enough in

470
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:33,276
your movements, we didn't introduce any discomfort.

471
00:20:33,836 --> 00:20:35,777
We also had the wheelchair follow the outside of the

472
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,878
room, meaning that the user always had a dark wall to one

473
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:39,359
side of them for most of the trip.

474
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,141
That had the double benefit of allowing us to block action

475
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:44,762
and guide gaze, as well as give users some visual rest if

476
00:20:44,782 --> 00:20:45,202
they needed it.

477
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:51,708
And then there were the typical issues that you would run into on any production, but were new to our team.

478
00:20:52,328 --> 00:20:53,689
Casting was especially difficult.

479
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:59,250
I had worked with actors in games to capture a likeness, but the contract negotiations around live-action casting were new to me.

480
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:07,092
For this experience, we needed actors that were comfortable with a digital double in all of its associated usage and distribution, nudity, and stunt work.

481
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:11,013
You can imagine that pool of people getting progressively smaller and smaller as you go digging.

482
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,973
And then the questions we never would have thought to ask.

483
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:15,435
How much is a squib?

484
00:21:15,915 --> 00:21:18,958
How do you hide it during a 360 shoot on a naked person?

485
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:21,221
All of it needed to be figured out pretty quickly.

486
00:21:21,501 --> 00:21:22,782
And I'm really impressed with the results

487
00:21:22,802 --> 00:21:23,643
that we were able to achieve.

488
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:25,605
And a quick note on audio.

489
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:27,828
Our friend Chris Hegstrom will be giving a talk

490
00:21:27,848 --> 00:21:28,889
around some of the interesting work

491
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:30,290
we did with sound capture and emitters.

492
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,952
I encourage you to attend that if you can.

493
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:33,514
And that is a horse.

494
00:21:33,574 --> 00:21:34,394
We had a horse on set.

495
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:35,175
It was a nightmare.

496
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:44,263
The build-out. The build-out was pretty extravagant, with six actors on site at any given time to take reservations, make people feel comfortable, and get them through the experience.

497
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:50,086
We had front-room actors dressed as hosts who would interact with people, take their reservations, and get them excited about the universe.

498
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:57,149
We also had backroom techs that would run the booths, manage the builds, and offer any assistance needed during the demos. All of it was done in fiction.

499
00:21:57,889 --> 00:22:02,352
The build-out itself supported two play spaces behind a large, outward-facing lobby facade area.

500
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,444
This was incredibly effective.

501
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:06,926
People loved it, and while I was a little spooked at the

502
00:22:06,986 --> 00:22:09,647
idea of actors improvising in world dialogue or people

503
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:11,888
trying to trip them up, they did it wonderfully.

504
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:14,350
People really responded to the feeling of one-on-one

505
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,431
interaction with the actors.

506
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:16,891
It made it feel much more personal.

507
00:22:18,752 --> 00:22:19,153
Reception.

508
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,474
Our feedback was extraordinarily positive.

509
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,236
We agonized over the balance between making things feel

510
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,317
mysterious versus clear for a year and a half, and I was

511
00:22:27,337 --> 00:22:29,118
shocked at how well people seemed to follow the story.

512
00:22:30,018 --> 00:22:31,659
We have a few interesting pieces of data here.

513
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,041
We premiered at TechCrunch before the show was out.

514
00:22:34,602 --> 00:22:36,604
But our next showing was at New York City Comic-Con after

515
00:22:36,644 --> 00:22:37,344
the show had premiered.

516
00:22:37,885 --> 00:22:39,987
We got two different but equally positive reactions.

517
00:22:40,607 --> 00:22:42,309
For the people that hadn't seen the show, they loved

518
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:44,430
being swept along on an experience that felt large and

519
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,051
interconnected.

520
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:47,533
The broad emotional strokes that we were using were enough

521
00:22:47,553 --> 00:22:48,754
to make people feel satisfied.

522
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:51,377
For people that were familiar with the show, we had a much

523
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:52,498
more specific reaction.

524
00:22:52,618 --> 00:22:54,820
People were thrilled to see familiar reactions and hear

525
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,480
familiar lines.

526
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:58,853
Specifically, the fly landing on the sheriff's face was a

527
00:22:58,873 --> 00:22:59,434
crowd pleaser.

528
00:22:59,914 --> 00:23:02,214
In VR, of course, that fly is the size of a golf ball, and

529
00:23:02,254 --> 00:23:03,995
we were still afraid people wouldn't be able to notice it.

530
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:07,036
But post-show, people snapped to it immediately and totally

531
00:23:07,076 --> 00:23:07,756
lost their minds.

532
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:09,737
Everyone understood where they were and what was happening.

533
00:23:09,757 --> 00:23:10,837
It was very satisfying.

534
00:23:12,677 --> 00:23:14,538
The people familiar with the show also wanted to push the

535
00:23:14,578 --> 00:23:15,158
bounds of the park.

536
00:23:15,618 --> 00:23:17,459
There was a lot of, I wish I could have gotten on a horse

537
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,799
and then robbed a bank and then climbed a mountain, which

538
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:21,520
at that point, you're just describing Westworld.

539
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,140
We couldn't make that.

540
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,280
But that's good.

541
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,761
It's better to leave people wanting more.

542
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:29,234
Though we were wary about it, we didn't have any negative responses to the violence.

543
00:23:29,754 --> 00:23:32,116
We spent a lot of time balancing the faithfulness to the show

544
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,877
with an awareness that we had to be careful with how intense we went.

545
00:23:35,018 --> 00:23:37,119
We used to call that knowing how hard to swing the bat.

546
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:39,880
Action that felt right at home in a game or a film

547
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,062
could feel way too intense in someone's personal space.

548
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:45,604
And we did have a few people quit early due to sensitivities around gun violence,

549
00:23:45,644 --> 00:23:48,225
but no extreme reactions. It was all very positive.

550
00:23:50,354 --> 00:23:52,497
People can acclimate to a lot if you give them time.

551
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:56,542
We were really concerned with removing people's agency midway through the experience.

552
00:23:57,463 --> 00:24:00,387
If someone told me that they wanted to pitch that now, I would tell them it was a bad idea.

553
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:03,448
But if you give them a narrative justification for it, they'll buy it.

554
00:24:04,128 --> 00:24:08,431
The experience was originally much more interactive, but we weren't happy with how it detracted from the story.

555
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:12,354
We could poke and nudge shirts, pix everything up, open drawers, and so on.

556
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:15,336
This concept applied to the interaction with your host as well.

557
00:24:15,836 --> 00:24:19,559
How close can you get physically with the host without feeling like you're daring the player to interact?

558
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,501
Some version of this discussion existed throughout production.

559
00:24:22,841 --> 00:24:24,943
It's easy to say that I'm satisfied with where we landed now.

560
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:29,787
But after a while, indecision and half-answers to these questions were coming to a head and bogging down production.

561
00:24:30,628 --> 00:24:34,532
I had been agonizing over this for a long time and finally came into the office with a new proclamation.

562
00:24:35,113 --> 00:24:36,514
If it didn't support the narrative, it was out.

563
00:24:37,215 --> 00:24:42,761
The conversations around prop interaction, gun loading, branching, secondary narratives, all of it had to satisfy that condition.

564
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:44,983
This was highly contentious on the team.

565
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:48,327
Are we turning our backs on the promise of the platform by doing that?

566
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:51,414
My parting thought, I think, is that the onus is on the

567
00:24:51,454 --> 00:24:53,535
content creator to present the user with something that feels

568
00:24:53,595 --> 00:24:54,676
intentional and concise.

569
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,877
If you don't know what it is you're making, the user

570
00:24:56,897 --> 00:24:57,497
certainly won't.

571
00:24:58,157 --> 00:25:00,598
A great exercise was zeroing in on our most inexperienced

572
00:25:00,678 --> 00:25:03,499
user possible, someone who had never used high-end VR, had

573
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:06,041
probably never used a mobile headset, and to push it even

574
00:25:06,081 --> 00:25:07,561
further, had never held a console

575
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:08,301
controller in their hand.

576
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:13,613
Think of all the things that you lose that you took for granted

577
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:14,933
once that gets stripped away.

578
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:16,834
If we were making an arena shooter,

579
00:25:16,914 --> 00:25:18,735
our criteria absolutely would have been different.

580
00:25:19,135 --> 00:25:21,115
But since we were event-based and couldn't control

581
00:25:21,135 --> 00:25:23,396
who went through, we had to prioritize simplicity.

582
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,197
To emphasize that even further,

583
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,278
our experience was around 10 minutes long.

584
00:25:27,678 --> 00:25:29,859
We couldn't support long, thoughtful education loops

585
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,579
on things like gun reloading with our players.

586
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,920
So for the target audience I just described,

587
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,081
the person that had never held a game pad before,

588
00:25:36,723 --> 00:25:40,024
Things just needed to work or we risk frustrating and pulling people out of the experience.

589
00:25:41,184 --> 00:25:42,584
Often this meant going the simpler route.

590
00:25:43,505 --> 00:25:46,005
Rather than a complicated system of prompts and tests to load

591
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:48,926
individual bullets into the gun, for example, we auto-loaded.

592
00:25:49,706 --> 00:25:51,467
Did we lose out on an engaging interaction?

593
00:25:52,027 --> 00:25:52,567
I think we did.

594
00:25:53,127 --> 00:25:55,948
But we also ensured people's minds would be on the story and not how they couldn't get

595
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:56,928
the reload action to work.

596
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:01,110
You may not like the cuts you're forced to make, but the experience will be better for them.

597
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:04,318
That is my time.

598
00:26:04,778 --> 00:26:07,539
I think we have something like five minutes left if we

599
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:08,460
wanted to do any questions.

600
00:26:17,783 --> 00:26:19,224
And so we'll do our best to make it through.

601
00:26:19,304 --> 00:26:21,484
And like I said, anything that we don't get to, I'm going to

602
00:26:21,504 --> 00:26:22,745
grab a coffee and hang out in the lobby.

603
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:23,825
So I'm happy to talk to anyone.

604
00:26:24,837 --> 00:26:30,382
Hey, you talked about having this interaction gradient. That's a really interesting point. I

605
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:36,528
look at other VR experiences like Job Simulator and the creators of that really, they talk

606
00:26:36,568 --> 00:26:41,792
about trying to focus on having a level amount of interaction within their systems. Can you

607
00:26:41,832 --> 00:26:46,837
talk a bit about how you, with that gradient, how you set up the expectation for the user to

608
00:26:47,137 --> 00:26:49,460
be accustomed to losing interactivity or gaining it back?

609
00:26:50,091 --> 00:26:52,993
I think it's easy to look back on that now and say, just do

610
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:54,074
whatever feels appropriate.

611
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,556
But there was a huge amount of fluctuation throughout the

612
00:26:56,576 --> 00:26:57,437
entire experience.

613
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:01,040
Job simulator is an easy one, because of course, as soon as

614
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,862
everyone goes through it, you say, oh my god, I want it to

615
00:27:02,902 --> 00:27:03,802
be like job simulator.

616
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,584
But that was not appropriate for the thing

617
00:27:05,604 --> 00:27:06,244
that we were making.

618
00:27:09,847 --> 00:27:12,970
We got away with what we did because it was a very gradual

619
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:14,632
removing of agency for people.

620
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:16,894
There was always a narrative explanation for it.

621
00:27:17,294 --> 00:27:19,777
I think if we had hopped around or gone more intense,

622
00:27:19,817 --> 00:27:22,099
then pulled back, then gone back intense again, it would

623
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:22,940
have felt disjointed.

624
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,721
And it wouldn't really have cohesed in the way that we

625
00:27:24,762 --> 00:27:25,202
wanted it to.

626
00:27:28,185 --> 00:27:32,448
Hello there. Thank you for that. Wonderful. And I love the show as well.

627
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:41,334
So just a quick question about sort of, I mean, there's a lot of VR experiences featuring violence and shooting and that kind of stuff.

628
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:45,477
And also just sort of looking around and wow, you know, I'm in VR.

629
00:27:45,517 --> 00:27:56,024
But did you kind of experiment with any kind of, any sort of positive or sort of more nuanced emotional interactions with the hosts?

630
00:27:56,164 --> 00:27:58,087
Certainly, that was the entire first chapter.

631
00:27:58,147 --> 00:28:00,991
So a lot of that is you are in the dressing room.

632
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:04,836
Your host comes towards you, gives you a selection to make,

633
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,180
walks around, gives you another selection, and is

634
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,403
generally very warm and flirtatious.

635
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:12,634
It was harder to do, but we were intentionally aiming

636
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:14,814
towards something much more subtle.

637
00:28:15,234 --> 00:28:16,335
And it all played through the face.

638
00:28:16,715 --> 00:28:19,976
So it was never a quest giver in a T-pose behind a table.

639
00:28:20,016 --> 00:28:22,276
It was a lot of leaning forward, reaching for your

640
00:28:22,296 --> 00:28:23,697
hand, trying to make eye contact.

641
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:27,818
Looking back on it now, that certainly doesn't telegraph as

642
00:28:27,858 --> 00:28:28,818
well as the violence did.

643
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:32,199
But as a statement of intent, I'm happy with where we

644
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:33,000
landed with it.

645
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,200
Thank you.

646
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:39,462
Did you experiment with voice input or anything like that?

647
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:41,126
Way, way early days.

648
00:28:41,727 --> 00:28:46,531
In the beginning, it was still very fill fast, learn fast.

649
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:47,732
And so we threw everything at it.

650
00:28:48,813 --> 00:28:49,573
Everyone wants it.

651
00:28:49,673 --> 00:28:52,996
I think it's very challenging to play through an experience

652
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:54,697
like this where someone is talking with you in an

653
00:28:54,737 --> 00:28:56,399
intimate way and not want to respond to them.

654
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:58,320
We just couldn't get the technology to stand up.

655
00:28:59,141 --> 00:29:02,163
So I mean, the way, way next one, totally.

656
00:29:07,686 --> 00:29:09,027
Hi, thanks for the talk.

657
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:12,251
Did you, can you quantify the number of people

658
00:29:12,311 --> 00:29:13,692
that came through the experience?

659
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:16,335
And then I had just a separate question.

660
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:20,512
In terms of the feedback for people that experienced,

661
00:29:21,213 --> 00:29:24,676
can you qualify the reactions to people based on...

662
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,799
There's a very different sort of pipeline for character creation that you described,

663
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:30,201
video and CG characters.

664
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:35,886
Is there any sort of feedback from the users about the quality of those characters

665
00:29:35,926 --> 00:29:39,549
and whether they found something more rich and detailed?

666
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,011
And that'd be great to hear.

667
00:29:41,251 --> 00:29:44,594
But as far as people that had gone through, I think we topped

668
00:29:44,675 --> 00:29:45,696
out at several hundred.

669
00:29:45,996 --> 00:29:47,557
It was across a couple of conventions.

670
00:29:47,617 --> 00:29:51,742
So a couple of booths running all day, getting as many

671
00:29:51,762 --> 00:29:53,724
people through as we could at about 10 minutes a pop.

672
00:29:53,744 --> 00:29:55,585
So it's around several hundred people.

673
00:29:56,506 --> 00:29:57,427
As far as the feedback.

674
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:02,612
Honestly, it's kind of a tricky one because I think we got a

675
00:30:02,652 --> 00:30:05,313
little bit more of a boost than we expected by, oh my

676
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:06,914
god, it's my first time through VR and this is

677
00:30:06,954 --> 00:30:08,174
amazing, you could have showed me anything.

678
00:30:09,635 --> 00:30:13,076
We did specifically pick at that intersection between the

679
00:30:13,116 --> 00:30:16,017
digital doubles and the actors transitioning.

680
00:30:17,957 --> 00:30:20,418
I think we were able to get away with more because we

681
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:22,839
allowed each of those time to breathe and didn't really

682
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:23,499
insist on it.

683
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:25,940
So in the first two chapters where you're interacting with

684
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,640
your digital double.

685
00:30:27,138 --> 00:30:28,081
It doesn't feel hurried.

686
00:30:28,462 --> 00:30:30,288
And then we have that interstitial chapter where you

687
00:30:30,308 --> 00:30:31,031
don't see them again.

688
00:30:31,472 --> 00:30:32,817
And then when you have them walk by.

689
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:36,161
in the 360 video portion and finally have them go through

690
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:36,781
their climax.

691
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:41,746
It's one, I think, either of those stand on their own.

692
00:30:41,786 --> 00:30:43,207
So if you don't make the connection, you're not

693
00:30:43,227 --> 00:30:43,948
penalized for it.

694
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:47,131
And second, it's a very passive connection.

695
00:30:47,151 --> 00:30:50,334
We're not saying, oh my god, identify that this was your

696
00:30:50,374 --> 00:30:52,576
host companion or something negative will happen to you.

697
00:30:52,956 --> 00:30:55,138
At that time, it's very explicitly passive, and you

698
00:30:55,158 --> 00:30:57,140
can just sort of take in what's happening in the scene.

699
00:30:57,961 --> 00:30:58,121
So.

700
00:30:59,602 --> 00:31:01,203
I take from that that we did a very good job.

701
00:31:01,223 --> 00:31:04,286
But I don't think that that's honest critique, really.

702
00:31:04,747 --> 00:31:08,070
I think we really did get a boost from people just kind of

703
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,072
being dumbfounded by what was happening around them.

704
00:31:13,815 --> 00:31:14,556
Is that time?

705
00:31:14,596 --> 00:31:15,076
That puts us at 30?

706
00:31:15,116 --> 00:31:18,940
No, we've got time for one more.

707
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,041
No one's yelling at me yet.

708
00:31:23,327 --> 00:31:27,169
I was just curious when you mentioned that you were able to keep production time of it

709
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:30,791
down by having a smaller number of affordances in given scenes.

710
00:31:31,912 --> 00:31:35,554
In scenes where it looked like there were a lot of objects like under glass cases and

711
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:39,616
everything which I assume to eliminate that kind of interaction, did you find any users

712
00:31:39,656 --> 00:31:44,019
kind of like wishing, oh man, like I wish I could have opened that cabinet or something

713
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:48,461
or like being frustrated with seeing things kind of just out of reach or was just the

714
00:31:48,501 --> 00:31:50,502
presence enough to really enhance the experience for them?

715
00:31:50,949 --> 00:31:53,752
Everyone tries it once, but after trying and not getting

716
00:31:53,952 --> 00:31:55,633
anything out of it, it completely goes away.

717
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,096
So in the beginning, all of that stuff could be

718
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:58,756
interacted with.

719
00:31:59,448 --> 00:32:02,069
And what we ended up doing, in a way that was really

720
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:04,951
effective, was just putting everything outside of the

721
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:05,731
fence that pops up.

722
00:32:05,751 --> 00:32:07,832
So it's like you try to walk over to the coats to play with

723
00:32:07,852 --> 00:32:09,833
the coats, and then you never think about it again.

724
00:32:10,934 --> 00:32:13,615
When we invited people to do it with some things and not

725
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:15,456
others, that's when the whole experience fell down.

726
00:32:15,757 --> 00:32:17,898
So at that point, we could not get their attentions back

727
00:32:17,918 --> 00:32:19,739
because they were trying to wind a watch or throw a

728
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:20,499
horseshoe or something.

729
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:24,321
So we found it was a little upsetting because we had spent

730
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:27,203
so much time laboring over each of those interactions

731
00:32:27,243 --> 00:32:28,223
and trying to make them feel good.

732
00:32:28,564 --> 00:32:30,405
But in the end, it was, rip it out.

733
00:32:30,445 --> 00:32:31,346
It's just not working.

734
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:35,529
It is a possible positive solution for an experience,

735
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,550
just not this one.

736
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:41,795
I think that's it.

737
00:32:42,135 --> 00:32:42,615
Thank you, everybody.
