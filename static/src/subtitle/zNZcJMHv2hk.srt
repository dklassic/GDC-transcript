00:00:06,785 --> 00:00:08,586
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:09,627
Welcome to my talk.

3
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:11,068
My name is Sam Liberty.

4
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:13,189
Hope you're having a great GDC.

5
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:17,252
So today, I'm really excited to be presenting to you

6
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:20,594
on the topic of escape rooms, and specifically,

7
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:24,076
why escape rooms are so great for teaching game design

8
00:00:24,076 --> 00:00:26,338
basics to new students.

9
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:30,681
So first, a little bit about me.

10
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:32,702
I am a professor at Northeastern University,

11
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:36,004
where I teach fundamentals of game design and other classes.

12
00:00:36,822 --> 00:00:43,488
Additionally, I am a consultant in my normal work where I do games for Impact, also known as Serious Games.

13
00:00:43,488 --> 00:00:46,030
You can see some of my clients here over at ExtraLudic.

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:53,055
You'll see that there are a lot of large NGOs, governments, and academic institutions.

15
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:57,839
But I want to draw your attention to some work that I did with DARPA,

16
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:02,363
because I actually designed an escape room for DARPA.

17
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:06,183
on a DARPA grant along with some of my Northeastern colleagues.

18
00:01:06,183 --> 00:01:10,449
So what I designed is an escape room called Daedalus.

19
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:14,014
It was an alternate reality game and escape room.

20
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:15,937
It was played online over Slack.

21
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:26,096
And the purpose of this escape room was to test people's adaptability in teams in unpredictable and uncertain work environments.

22
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:30,838
So we had to design some very specific puzzles that satisfied those requirements.

23
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:38,222
And we were able to not only show that that worked, but that you can actually test and experiment.

24
00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:47,367
in a controlled way with an online game or an ARG compared to having to do it in a lab setting,

25
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:53,149
or to have numerators follow around people in their day-to-day lives.

26
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:57,351
So that was my big escape room contribution.

27
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,232
But over at Northeastern, I teach Fundamentals of Game Design.

28
00:02:01,232 --> 00:02:06,634
To give you a little bit of context, this is usually a class of around 20 students.

29
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:11,417
They're new game design students, and pretty much every game design student that comes through

30
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:17,040
Northeastern has to go through this class. And not only have I taught it and will teach it again,

31
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,904
But I actually designed the syllabus for this class along with some of my colleagues,

32
00:02:21,904 --> 00:02:28,388
and I made sure to include an escape room in one of the early units for reasons that will become clear soon.

33
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:33,852
So in this image, you can see some of my students working on their escape room prototype.

34
00:02:33,852 --> 00:02:42,058
They're actually playing through it, and they're in a situation where they're supposed to be on opposite sides of a prison cell,

35
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:43,859
working in parallel to escape.

36
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:53,128
So what will we be talking about today? First, I'm going to be talking about why escape rooms make

37
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:59,050
such good game design lessons. So we're going to go over the features of an escape room that make

38
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,711
it good for teaching game design basics, and we're also going to go over the individual skills that

39
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:10,832
students get to drill and hopefully master when they design their own escape room in a team.

40
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:13,592
After that, I'm going to tell you exactly how I did it.

41
00:03:14,164 --> 00:03:23,232
and how we do it over in Northeastern, including the phases of design, the skills that students

42
00:03:23,232 --> 00:03:32,761
get to drill, the deliverables that we expect them to bring for their grade, and how they reflect

43
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:36,645
at the end of the process to crystallize their learning.

44
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:44,045
So why escape rooms? What makes these so good at teaching game design and making people into

45
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:49,790
better game designers? So the first feature I want to call attention to is the fact that they are

46
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:54,475
analog, and by analog I mean they are not digital, they're not video games. This makes them

47
00:03:54,475 --> 00:04:01,461
exceptionally easy to rapidly iterate. You are basically just taking pieces of paper, cardboard,

48
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:05,044
whatever, and moving them around and rewriting them and things like that.

49
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:11,421
You don't have to go into a terminal, you don't have to go into Unity.

50
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:13,983
It's pretty great for building things fast.

51
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:19,826
There's also no coding required, which means that you don't need any special skills to do this.

52
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:24,808
All you need is kind of a desire to be a game designer,

53
00:04:24,808 --> 00:04:28,390
and everything that you need to know to make these we actually teach in the class.

54
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:34,293
So it's very egalitarian that way in terms of what skills are required and the kinds of people that can make them.

55
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:42,808
So the next feature I want to talk about is how highly thematic an escape room is, at least hopefully.

56
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:44,149
So when you go to an escape room,

57
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:50,346
Why are you going there instead of just doing puzzles at home like a sudoku or crossword

58
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:56,949
or even something more complicated? And the reason that I think people gravitate towards these games

59
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:03,692
is that they are very immersive. When you're in an escape room, you're really in a 360

60
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:10,735
immersive world that the designers took great care to make you feel like you're in that place.

61
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:13,396
And of course there's some suspension of disbelief.

62
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:21,264
You know, some things aren't necessarily real, but it feels like you're there.

63
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:26,931
So if you're building an escape room that supposedly has you in a hospital infested

64
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:31,576
with zombies and you have to escape, you really want the players to feel that way.

65
00:05:31,716 --> 00:05:36,019
And since my students don't have a huge fabrication budget,

66
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,421
you know, they don't have a big special effects budget,

67
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,524
they're not incredible engineers or set designers,

68
00:05:42,524 --> 00:05:47,869
that immersion is gonna come through their game design,

69
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:50,411
through their puzzle design itself.

70
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:52,232
So this is very good practice

71
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:54,073
for uniting theme and mechanic.

72
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,478
And these can be top-down or bottom-up, by which I mean you can either have a theme that

73
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:03,861
you really want to deliver, like the zombie hospital or whatever, or you can have a mechanic

74
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:08,365
or a collection of mechanics that you think would make a good puzzle or escape room and

75
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:11,227
then build a theme around that.

76
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:14,950
And in fact, that first image that I showed you of the people in the jail cells was a

77
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,553
bottom-up design where they wanted just to split people up and have them working on parallel

78
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:20,534
puzzles.

79
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:23,036
So they came up with the prison theme as a wrapper for that.

80
00:06:23,656 --> 00:06:27,020
And on the right you can see a puzzle that some of my other students made where they were doing

81
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,287
a mafia bar themed escape room that had a supernatural twist to it. So they made this

82
00:06:32,287 --> 00:06:40,276
kind of neat drink menu puzzle. And there's lots of stuff like that that my students end up making.

83
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:41,678
So additionally

84
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:47,152
Escape rooms are multiplayer, and it's good to be able to learn to design multiplayer games.

85
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:53,277
You have to design them for teams, and that means different people moving different ways

86
00:06:53,277 --> 00:06:59,462
in unpredictable manners. It also means multiple player psychographics. So you're building an

87
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:04,426
escape room that appeals not just to you or not just to a certain type of person, but to

88
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:07,749
varied people on a team that can be large.

89
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:14,196
So you might have some puzzles that are for people that like physical assembly and and spatial puzzles

90
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:18,020
You might have different puzzles that are ciphers

91
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:24,127
Puzzles that are logic puzzles. There's lots of different things that you can do and my students do

92
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:29,333
And it requires a little bit more work and a little bit more thought to appeal to a large team like that

93
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,922
Escape rooms feature many interlocking subsystems.

94
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:38,286
All these different puzzles need to be happening either

95
00:07:38,286 --> 00:07:40,828
linearly or in parallel, usually a combination of the two.

96
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,970
They're all different, but they all

97
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,115
have to be united under the umbrella of the escape room

98
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:47,375
itself.

99
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:52,320
So it's really a challenge to unite all those moving parts

100
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,102
and make it feel coherent and immersive.

101
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,568
This opens up an abundance of design space.

102
00:07:59,568 --> 00:08:03,629
There's lots of little nooks and crannies and things to make, and that makes it ideal

103
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:06,490
for a small team of dedicated designers.

104
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:14,473
So by that I mean, again, it's not a video game where you have a coder, a producer,

105
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:20,652
an art director, an animator, a UI UX person, a sound person.

106
00:08:20,652 --> 00:08:23,975
No, you have four or five game designers.

107
00:08:23,975 --> 00:08:26,116
It is a game design class, and it's the early one,

108
00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:29,960
and we don't expect people to have even programming skills,

109
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,983
even though there are a lot of computer science students

110
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:34,644
in the class.

111
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:34,784
But.

112
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:39,032
What you have is a group of four or five game designers.

113
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:41,853
They can all design puzzle ideas.

114
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:43,033
They can all build them.

115
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:45,614
They can all test them.

116
00:08:45,614 --> 00:08:47,574
So this is really perfect for that.

117
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:49,635
And each can kind of master or become

118
00:08:49,635 --> 00:08:52,356
the master of one aspect of the escape room.

119
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:54,397
And then they work together to unite it.

120
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:02,705
Escape rooms have obvious balancing heuristics, and by that I don't mean that it's easy to

121
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:04,046
balance an escape room.

122
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:06,088
The opposite, in fact, is quite challenging.

123
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:13,553
But what I mean is, when an escape room is not balanced, it's pretty obvious why it's

124
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,215
not balanced, or where the imbalance is coming from.

125
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:18,997
So there's things that you can easily look at.

126
00:09:18,997 --> 00:09:21,579
For instance, how difficult are the puzzles?

127
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:25,402
What are your playtesters saying to you about them?

128
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:29,979
the time. You know, it's a 30 minute escape room. Are your players finishing it in 10?

129
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:36,567
That is a problem. Are they finishing it never? That's a problem as well. Is there one puzzle

130
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:40,972
that's taking 20 minutes and then they're trying to cram the rest of it in the last 10?

131
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:43,455
That's probably not the flow you want. You'll be able to see that.

132
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:47,309
And then there's the legibility, or UX, of it.

133
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:49,831
And how I think of UX in an escape room

134
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:51,773
is a little bit different than how I think about it

135
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:53,094
in a video game.

136
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:54,835
But basically I'm talking about the components,

137
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:56,757
how they're made, how they're designed,

138
00:09:56,757 --> 00:09:58,318
and how they're laid out.

139
00:09:58,318 --> 00:10:01,761
The flow of the puzzles, the flow of the room,

140
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:03,923
so that when you begin the timer

141
00:10:03,923 --> 00:10:07,826
and people are in the escape room, they know what to do.

142
00:10:07,826 --> 00:10:09,788
They can start attacking the puzzles

143
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:11,269
and figuring out how to solve them.

144
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:16,072
And if they can't, again, it's obvious that they can't.

145
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:19,695
And it may be painful to the game designer to watch that.

146
00:10:19,695 --> 00:10:21,436
And they can start working on a solution.

147
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:23,758
I'm sure there are many other features of escape rooms

148
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:26,500
that make them really good for teaching

149
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,041
these kinds of things.

150
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,823
If you can think of them, go ahead and put them

151
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:31,423
in the comments.

152
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,784
I'd love to see them.

153
00:10:32,784 --> 00:10:36,167
Maybe we can talk about them as we go on.

154
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,328
But now I want to talk about the skills that your students are

155
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:41,270
going to need in order to make these escape rooms.

156
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:43,960
So the first one is brainstorming.

157
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,641
And there's kind of a misconception around

158
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:50,264
brainstorming that it's just something that you do.

159
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:52,206
You get your team together and you just talk

160
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:54,047
and that's a brainstorm.

161
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:55,988
And to an extent, that's kind of true,

162
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,431
but really brainstorming is a skill like any other

163
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:03,293
that you can build and learn and improve upon.

164
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:06,896
There are specific techniques and times to use them.

165
00:11:07,455 --> 00:11:09,475
And we talked about them earlier in the unit,

166
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:10,675
so they kind of know about them.

167
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:13,796
But this is a chance for us to actually do them.

168
00:11:13,796 --> 00:11:16,177
And we do three of them all in one day

169
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:17,437
to really drill that skill.

170
00:11:17,437 --> 00:11:19,297
So the first one is for the whole class.

171
00:11:19,297 --> 00:11:21,438
And I use a technique called SNAP

172
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:23,618
that I'll go into in a lot more detail

173
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:26,019
later on in this presentation.

174
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,880
The second is a small group brainstorm

175
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,521
once they have their teams, where they build a consensus.

176
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:34,501
And the third is an individual brainstorm

177
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:36,842
where they're coming up with puzzles in kind of a rapid way.

178
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,173
And again, I'm going to talk about all of these a little

179
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:41,575
further along when I do the how section.

180
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,679
After the branch room is complete,

181
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,602
the next skill that we're going to be drilling

182
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:51,086
is rapid iteration, rapid prototyping.

183
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:55,431
So to complete your escape room in time.

184
00:11:55,997 --> 00:12:00,018
and have it be satisfactory. You really need to be building puzzles pretty quick.

185
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:06,560
It's not a long unit, and most of the unit is not devoted to your iterations.

186
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,583
So you're going to build them quickly, get them from your mind to the page, and get people playing them.

187
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,243
You test them multiple times.

188
00:12:14,243 --> 00:12:17,024
Usually they're not going to work right out of the gate,

189
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:19,485
so they need to be tested over and over again to get them perfect.

190
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:27,424
And of course, physical puzzles, like I said before, are very easy to rapidly iterate, even in the middle of a game.

191
00:12:27,424 --> 00:12:32,186
You can stop the time during a test, go in, change one of the numbers,

192
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:40,210
tell them something that they should be seeing that they're not, or whatever, and then make that change for the next time.

193
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,412
Going right into that, playtesting.

194
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:48,255
Which is a little bit different than iterating, because you have to test every iteration.

195
00:12:49,032 --> 00:12:54,095
And I want to call attention to a few things about how we playtest these escape rooms.

196
00:12:54,095 --> 00:12:58,539
One is they will be working both inside and out of class.

197
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:02,422
So the first playtest they do are going to be kind of structured and observed by me,

198
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:03,543
and I'm there to help them out.

199
00:13:03,543 --> 00:13:07,606
But then after that, they're going to be doing them outside of the class,

200
00:13:07,606 --> 00:13:10,428
and they're going to get that experience recruiting.

201
00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:15,952
They're going to get that experience organizing and running, making sure they go well.

202
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:24,428
The final deliverable that they're going to give, and I'll go into more detail in the second half,

203
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:28,749
is actually a game test, right? You're not delivering a final finished escape room.

204
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:33,190
That's not reasonable for students. What you're delivering is a prototype

205
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,151
that you will test live in class, and that really centers prototyping

206
00:13:38,877 --> 00:13:46,889
and testing in this unit as a deliverable, which kind of forefronts it in their experience.

207
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:52,817
And last thing I want to talk about playtesting is that an escape room has major fabrication tasks.

208
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,363
You're going to be going out, you're going to be buying props like the ones you see on the right.

209
00:13:57,363 --> 00:13:59,144
You're going to be spending your own money on that.

210
00:13:59,144 --> 00:14:14,335
You're going to be taking time, probably collectively hours with your team, building, cutting, assembling, designing these props and components, and kind of conceptualizing how they're going to fit in the room.

211
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:17,858
And when you're doing all that, it really behooves you.

212
00:14:18,678 --> 00:14:24,944
to know that the puzzles that you've put into place will actually work.

213
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:30,550
And the only way you know they work is by playtesting them well beforehand. You don't

214
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,795
want to be spending a lot of time and money and effort on something that will blow up as soon

215
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:38,198
as you put it in front of someone. You want to know that it already worked before you did all that work.

216
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:48,006
And that's something that they carry forward in their kind of student careers and hopefully as professionals

217
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:50,628
that play testing is so important and

218
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:54,851
With a video game just like with this escape room

219
00:14:54,851 --> 00:15:00,575
You want to make sure that your mechanics are going to work before you make your program or actually build them out

220
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:03,838
Except again with an escape room. You don't need to code to learn that

221
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:10,010
So, uh, the last skill I want to talk about is fine tuning,

222
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,492
which might seem like it goes along with iterating and testing and it does.

223
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:16,173
But, uh, what I am talking about is slightly different.

224
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:25,576
So early on in this experience, you're going to be making kind of sweeping changes to your

225
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:33,862
escape room, conceptually, organizationally, logistically, or making large changes to puzzles,

226
00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:36,024
maybe even throwing puzzles out.

227
00:15:36,024 --> 00:15:38,005
Those are kind of large changes.

228
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:40,667
By the end, you're going to be focused on these fine-tuning things.

229
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:45,731
And puzzle design is very granular, so a very small change can have a big impact on...

230
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:48,395
the experience of the players.

231
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:50,375
A very small thing can ruin the whole experience.

232
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,016
So you're going to be balancing to the clock.

233
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:56,576
It's a 30-minute escape room that you're designing.

234
00:15:56,576 --> 00:16:00,837
And ideally, you want people finishing near the end

235
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:03,318
or being almost finished at the end.

236
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:08,139
So you have that 30-minute plus or minus two or three minute

237
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:09,479
window.

238
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:12,560
And it's a challenge to get people consistently

239
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,980
landing in that window.

240
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,721
And that requires fine tuning.

241
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:20,663
fine-tuning of the components, fine-tuning of the puzzles, and fine-tuning of a hint system,

242
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:26,446
which of course you'll need to develop because no matter how good your design is, people will get

243
00:16:26,446 --> 00:16:32,750
stuck and they'll need some sort of hint system. So is that going to be a resource-based hint

244
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,791
system, time-based, freebies?

245
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:38,994
it's really up to the students. And another thing that I found is that the iterations

246
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:43,298
on these components can really take students over the finish line and making it clear and fun

247
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:48,042
to players, but can also kneecap a good design. So you see on the right, that's a puzzle some

248
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:54,047
students did. It was a jigsaw style puzzle where they had to find and assemble these pieces and

249
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:59,532
then get a code off of it. But as you can see, the components are very flimsy. They're small

250
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:00,973
pieces of paper.

251
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:05,598
And they turned out to be easily lost.

252
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:09,080
And in fact, that bottom right-hand piece did get lost.

253
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,141
Luckily, the students were still able to play through,

254
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:16,704
because although who knows what that last digit was, a 1, a 6,

255
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:18,405
a 4, but they could just try them all.

256
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:22,047
But that was not the experience that my students wanted

257
00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:24,868
when they designed this escape room.

258
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:27,270
So if they were a little more thoughtful

259
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,470
about their component design, they

260
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,371
wouldn't have had that problem.

261
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:35,188
Okay, so how to teach with Escape Rooms.

262
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,931
I'm gonna show you exactly how I did it

263
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,414
so you can adapt it to your own need.

264
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:43,177
And you might have more or fewer students than me,

265
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:45,900
they might be older or younger, more or less experienced,

266
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,041
so this isn't one size fits all,

267
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:51,006
but I encourage you to take this and kind of iterate with it.

268
00:17:51,826 --> 00:17:55,388
So here is the unit overview.

269
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:56,789
It's a three-week unit.

270
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:59,851
The first week is devoted to research and brainstorming,

271
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:01,432
so kind of ideating our escape rooms.

272
00:18:01,432 --> 00:18:04,734
The second week is about prototyping and iteration,

273
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:06,936
so building and testing it out.

274
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:09,697
And then the third week is going to be the deliverable week,

275
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:12,879
where we're going to actually live playtest that final escape

276
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:16,301
room for each team and do our post-mortem.

277
00:18:17,467 --> 00:18:19,868
So the first thing we do is field research.

278
00:18:19,868 --> 00:18:22,210
Students can visit any local escape room they want.

279
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,072
I usually point them towards Escape the Room Boston

280
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:27,033
because they have good production values

281
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:28,354
and do a good job.

282
00:18:28,354 --> 00:18:30,596
But they all have to go.

283
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:31,697
They do it on their own time.

284
00:18:31,697 --> 00:18:33,118
It's not an organized field trip.

285
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:35,219
They have to organize themselves and go.

286
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:37,741
And then they write an experience report.

287
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,222
So everyone is kind of on the same page.

288
00:18:40,222 --> 00:18:42,884
And we do this because not everyone

289
00:18:42,884 --> 00:18:44,265
has been to an escape room, right?

290
00:18:44,902 --> 00:18:46,283
And if you're going to design one,

291
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:49,984
it's important that you have played at least one.

292
00:18:49,984 --> 00:18:53,065
So they go out and do this to build their base experience.

293
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,145
From there, we go to brainstorming.

294
00:18:55,145 --> 00:18:57,026
And again, I use this technique called

295
00:18:57,026 --> 00:19:00,987
Snap that's been very valuable to me in my role

296
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:02,388
as a designer for Games for Impact.

297
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:04,528
And it's called Snap because it's

298
00:19:04,528 --> 00:19:07,969
based on a card game popular in the UK,

299
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:10,490
similar to War, where you flip over cards.

300
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,531
And when they match, somebody says, snap.

301
00:19:13,272 --> 00:19:16,913
And whoever says it first gets to take those cards as a point.

302
00:19:16,913 --> 00:19:19,274
So this technique is really ideal for having

303
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:22,654
a large group of people with a lot of different experiences

304
00:19:22,654 --> 00:19:29,196
and ideas and synthesizing one view of how to move forward.

305
00:19:29,196 --> 00:19:33,837
So how it works is each student writes out Post-it notes.

306
00:19:33,837 --> 00:19:36,577
We don't use playing cards like in the Game Snap.

307
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:37,938
We create Post-its.

308
00:19:37,938 --> 00:19:40,858
So I might ask, what are the mechanics that are?

309
00:19:41,258 --> 00:19:44,600
that you want to have in an escape room and what are the themes that you want in an escape room,

310
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,162
and they'll write three or four post-its for each one of those. So just so you know,

311
00:19:49,162 --> 00:19:52,904
what we're looking at now is from a Snap brainstorm, although it was not from an

312
00:19:52,904 --> 00:19:58,727
escape room, it was from a different class that I taught at Northeastern, but we did use Snap.

313
00:19:58,727 --> 00:20:03,889
We used a digital board called Miro because we couldn't meet in person because of the pandemic.

314
00:20:04,697 --> 00:20:09,138
However, normally we do meet in person and we do use a whiteboard and a whiteboard marker

315
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:12,260
in real physical Post-its, and it does work better that way.

316
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,301
So someone will come up after they have their cards and present their first one.

317
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:20,203
So someone might say, I want to make a horror-themed escape room, and they'll put it on the wall.

318
00:20:20,203 --> 00:20:25,065
And then anyone that has something similar or the same gets to say, snap, and they come

319
00:20:25,065 --> 00:20:26,666
up and they say, hey, I have a haunted house.

320
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:33,540
they stick it up there. And the closer it is conceptually, the more those post-its overlap.

321
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,164
And then if somebody has something that snaps to either one of those, they say snap and they go up.

322
00:20:38,164 --> 00:20:42,469
And then you can snap to any of those three. And you keep going until no one can snap to any of

323
00:20:42,469 --> 00:20:49,436
the post-its in the cluster. And then you move on to the next one. Hey, I want to make one based on

324
00:20:49,436 --> 00:20:51,538
cute animals. Snap, I have cats.

325
00:20:52,078 --> 00:20:55,580
And over the course of this, thematic clusters form.

326
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,182
And then once everyone's cards are on the wall,

327
00:20:58,182 --> 00:20:59,423
we form these clusters.

328
00:20:59,423 --> 00:21:03,505
You might move them around a little bit

329
00:21:03,505 --> 00:21:04,585
to make sure it makes sense.

330
00:21:04,585 --> 00:21:07,067
It also takes some of the pressure off

331
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:08,888
being perfect in the beginning, because you

332
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:09,928
can move them around.

333
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:12,290
And then we name those thematic clusters.

334
00:21:13,658 --> 00:21:21,184
After that, there's a kind of consensus phase, where they get to put stars on the clusters

335
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:23,825
that jump out as being relevant.

336
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:28,428
So I might ask prompting questions like, what are you excited to work on?

337
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:33,632
And what would be unique in terms of an escape room that hasn't been done a lot before?

338
00:21:33,632 --> 00:21:36,754
Or what do you think is feasible to do in three weeks?

339
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,595
And then those stars go up based on that.

340
00:21:38,595 --> 00:21:43,118
And where those stars clump is usually a good direction for the students to move.

341
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:49,656
So after that we do a group formation based on those clusters, and we have small group brainstorms.

342
00:21:49,656 --> 00:21:53,219
They can use any technique that we've gone over in class or any other technique,

343
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:57,984
but these small group brainstorms are really just about building consensus

344
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,387
so you know thematically and mechanically what you're making and

345
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:04,791
how you're going to utilize the room because the classroom does become the escape room.

346
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:14,504
And then after you have that we do a puzzle brainstorm. So how that works is we break up and individually

347
00:22:14,504 --> 00:22:19,226
come up with puzzle ideas. And the reason we switch to individual at this point is because it's just so much more efficient.

348
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:22,540
So if you have a team coming up with a puzzle brainstorm,

349
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,841
you might have four or five people working together

350
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:28,902
over half an hour, and they get one really cool puzzle idea

351
00:22:28,902 --> 00:22:29,702
that's well fleshed out.

352
00:22:29,702 --> 00:22:31,823
And that's a nice thing to have.

353
00:22:31,823 --> 00:22:35,164
But if you have four or five people brainstorming puzzles

354
00:22:35,164 --> 00:22:38,785
individually, coming up with a couple, instead of having one,

355
00:22:38,785 --> 00:22:40,866
you have maybe 10 or 12, which is

356
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:43,447
important because an escape room has a lot of puzzles in it.

357
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:50,782
So they also start kind of writing out how the puzzle works, and they can then present

358
00:22:50,782 --> 00:22:56,288
it to their team who don't know the puzzle and see if they can understand it and start

359
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:58,591
solving it and if it's exciting to them.

360
00:22:58,591 --> 00:23:03,597
So you get an immediate proof-of-concept playtest right at the end of the brainstorm, which

361
00:23:03,597 --> 00:23:04,418
is a nice thing to have.

362
00:23:06,002 --> 00:23:10,264
So that kind of puts us right into rapid prototyping.

363
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,985
So we have our puzzle design.

364
00:23:12,985 --> 00:23:14,445
We start doing some paper prototyping of that.

365
00:23:14,445 --> 00:23:18,587
By that I don't mean necessarily that they must be made of paper, just that they're lo-fi

366
00:23:18,587 --> 00:23:20,047
and easy to iterate.

367
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:25,149
So it could be something digital like the one on the left, which is a presentation.

368
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:27,810
It was done in PowerPoint and you go through steps.

369
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:33,252
Or it could be paper, it could be glass, it could be really anything that doesn't take

370
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:34,372
that much effort to do.

371
00:23:35,821 --> 00:23:38,063
But we start building those quickly and testing.

372
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:39,104
But who tests it?

373
00:23:39,104 --> 00:23:43,287
That's an important question, because eventually, you're

374
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:45,609
going to need a fresh team that has never

375
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:49,111
done your puzzles before to play your final prototype.

376
00:23:49,111 --> 00:23:52,494
Because if they've seen your puzzles before,

377
00:23:52,494 --> 00:23:55,356
they can kind of fake their way through the escape room

378
00:23:55,356 --> 00:23:56,397
and it's not a good test.

379
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,141
So what we do is we match teams up with a partner team.

380
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:03,362
So those green lines, team one will play team two's puzzles,

381
00:24:03,362 --> 00:24:05,643
and team two will play team one's and vice versa.

382
00:24:05,643 --> 00:24:08,944
And if you need a fresh look later on,

383
00:24:08,944 --> 00:24:10,045
you might go diagonally.

384
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:11,626
So team one might help team four.

385
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:14,207
But that means that the teams that

386
00:24:14,207 --> 00:24:17,788
are connected with blue lines have never played their escape

387
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:18,788
room puzzles at all.

388
00:24:19,465 --> 00:24:24,968
and they're fresh and they will be the team that will playtest your final prototype when

389
00:24:24,968 --> 00:24:29,451
you do the live testing class. So team one and team three, team two and team four.

390
00:24:30,992 --> 00:24:35,196
You're playtesting inside class in that structured way that I talked about before,

391
00:24:35,196 --> 00:24:39,300
but then you're also playtesting outside of class. And the reason that we playtest outside

392
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:44,205
of class is a because there's just not enough time. We have only a couple classes devoted to

393
00:24:44,205 --> 00:24:49,111
building and testing. Each class is an hour and 40 minutes, and four hours is not enough time

394
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:52,734
to playtest and develop an escape room. So you need to do work outside of class.

395
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:58,654
This also gives each student the opportunity to actually organize and run their own playtest

396
00:24:58,654 --> 00:25:03,299
instead of just having the team leader or whoever running playtests all the time.

397
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:07,564
And that's an important skill for players to, for students to build.

398
00:25:09,528 --> 00:25:10,828
then after that you're going to fabricate.

399
00:25:10,828 --> 00:25:12,369
It makes them look a little bit nicer.

400
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:14,490
Something like the props on the right

401
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,551
that are kind of not super polished,

402
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:18,651
but are funny and fun

403
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:23,893
and can immerse your team in their escape room.

404
00:25:23,893 --> 00:25:26,555
And that can be quite a major project

405
00:25:26,555 --> 00:25:28,415
like I talked about before.

406
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:35,186
So now today is the day, the day that you're going to do the live playtest.

407
00:25:35,186 --> 00:25:40,769
And this happens in class, during class time, and it runs the entire escape room

408
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:43,330
with your fresh team under a timer.

409
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,350
And like I said, that timer is 30 minutes.

410
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,151
Now there's a question of space.

411
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:57,676
because you have four teams and each team needs to play for half an hour and that's two hours and that's longer than

412
00:25:57,676 --> 00:26:01,298
than a class. So I usually reserve a separate classroom and I put two of the teams in that

413
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:08,100
and then that gives you an hour for escape room play and then each escape room has

414
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,321
10 minutes of setup before

415
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:14,623
10 minutes of breakdown and feedback gathering after, which is just about perfect, although it

416
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:19,844
is still tight. So because it's still tight, it's really important that you make sure your students

417
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:27,047
have all their prep done before class starts. You don't want them showing up cutting, pasting,

418
00:26:27,047 --> 00:26:28,467
marking, coloring.

419
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:34,450
printing because then they won't have enough time to set up and it'll cut into

420
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,533
the other team's time and that is not fair. So stress that they need to have it

421
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:42,156
all done and ready either the night before or the morning before not in

422
00:26:42,156 --> 00:26:42,436
class.

423
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,515
and to make sure that they not only leave time at the end to gather feedback from their playtesters,

424
00:26:47,515 --> 00:26:53,541
but have an organized way to gather that playtest feedback.

425
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:56,364
And the reason that that is so important

426
00:26:56,364 --> 00:27:03,072
is because it will feed directly into the reflections that they do, the postmortems that they do.

427
00:27:03,072 --> 00:27:03,112
So...

428
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:10,469
you're going to need an organized way to get good quotes and good insights from your players,

429
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:16,170
not just stand up there at the end and say, well, what did you think? And I'm sure if you said that

430
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:21,792
people would talk, but you want to get good specific questions about your puzzles, in addition

431
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:27,373
to your own observations. So it's actually important that one student takes notes during this as well.

432
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,851
So, okay, the reflection.

433
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:37,233
The final, final deliverable is this post-mortem reflection.

434
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:43,056
So this is probably the first post-mortem that my students write in their game design careers.

435
00:27:43,056 --> 00:27:45,397
It's not something that high schoolers typically do.

436
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:45,577
So,

437
00:27:45,577 --> 00:27:52,540
it's important for them to understand what a post-mortem is and why they're written.

438
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,102
So I assigned them to read three post-mortems for favorite games.

439
00:27:56,882 --> 00:28:02,384
They're easy to find online. You can google them. Plenty of them are up on Gama Sutra, as you all know.

440
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:09,786
And they can really get a sense of the form of them and the content of them. So once they do that,

441
00:28:09,786 --> 00:28:16,428
we have them write a group post-mortem on their escape rooms. So we want to hear what went right,

442
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:20,690
what went wrong, and what they would do differently in the future.

443
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,571
So this is essentially an honest evaluation of their work.

444
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:29,165
and crystallizes what they learned in their experience

445
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,167
so that they can continue carrying it forward

446
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,688
in their academic and professional careers.

447
00:28:32,688 --> 00:28:35,370
Because if they don't take the time to reflect,

448
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,312
a lot of that learning can get lost.

449
00:28:38,312 --> 00:28:43,517
And equally as important is, for me as the professor,

450
00:28:43,517 --> 00:28:47,099
I get to see them work through in written language

451
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:50,662
their experience so I know what they struggled with.

452
00:28:51,183 --> 00:28:55,087
I know how they're thinking about their next room.

453
00:28:55,087 --> 00:28:56,909
Basically, they're conceptualizing

454
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:00,913
their next prototype, their next iteration in that document

455
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:01,614
for me to see.

456
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,998
And that's really, really helpful for me to grade them.

457
00:29:04,998 --> 00:29:08,161
So that is it.

458
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:10,043
That's how and why.

459
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:12,753
I'm sure you're really excited to do it yourself.

460
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:18,115
If you have questions that you have not already asked in the comments below, feel free to

461
00:29:18,115 --> 00:29:19,655
reach out to me and I'll try to answer them.

462
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:24,217
You can reach me about this or anything else at my Northeastern email address, which is

463
00:29:24,217 --> 00:29:26,218
there on the last slide.

464
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,622
You can also find me on Twitter where I sometimes talk about game design,

465
00:29:30,622 --> 00:29:35,865
and Medium where I write about my design process and approaches.

466
00:29:35,865 --> 00:29:43,270
So, I hope to see you, and I hope that you have a great remainder of your CDC.

467
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,731
Take care, everyone.
