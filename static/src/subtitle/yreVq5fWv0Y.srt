00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:15,407
Hi, my name is Conny and I'm the writer, art and creative director of my game studio called Youmai.

2
00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:23,913
We created the story-driven adventure called Sea of Solitude, which I will talk about today.

3
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:31,618
I will give you a short introduction about my background, so you see how it all influenced Sea

4
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:32,138
of Solitude.

5
00:00:34,354 --> 00:00:40,757
I started my career with 17 at the biggest German comic house in Berlin,

6
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:46,279
drawing for their monthly comic series.

7
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:51,181
As I had loved video games since I was a child,

8
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,623
as soon as the first games academy opened up in Berlin,

9
00:00:56,704 --> 00:01:02,306
my chosen hometown, I applied and successfully got an internship.

10
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:12,975
and became a game designer. I worked mainly as an art director in the games industry

11
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:22,903
up until I founded my own company, Yomai, together with Boris Monza, one of my best friends.

12
00:01:23,624 --> 00:01:28,668
Sea of Solitude is our first multiple platform title.

13
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:36,951
The first big 3D game we made and the first story-driven game.

14
00:01:37,992 --> 00:01:46,517
We are so proud that we finished it at all with the small 12-people team we had being back then.

15
00:01:48,798 --> 00:01:54,902
Our vision was when humans get too lonely, they turn into monsters.

16
00:01:56,363 --> 00:02:00,066
And first, I want to show you how that looks like.

17
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:26,476
I'm no child of destiny

18
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:29,599
And no fortune's son

19
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,142
I've just chased you so long now

20
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:36,604
I'm too weak to run

21
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:40,807
A new day is here

22
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:44,670
But nothing is new

23
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:48,273
Alone in my room

24
00:02:49,914 --> 00:02:50,955
I tremble

25
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:13,111
Today I will talk about the art direction of Sea of Solitude in depth.

26
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:16,513
I will often use the acronym like SOS.

27
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:21,317
So just so you know, I don't cry out for help when I say that.

28
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:29,323
I'm going to talk about how emotions informed and inspired the visual style of the character.

29
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:41,320
We will cover a lot of ground, looking at how the style of SOS is heavily influenced by emotions,

30
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:49,346
what aspects were important when building our version for Berlin, what makes our Bessel so

31
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:57,351
special, why the monsters look like they do and how limitations inspired features.

32
00:03:58,106 --> 00:04:03,869
So in SOS you play a woman named Kaylee who suffers from such strong loneliness

33
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:09,712
that her inner feelings, that the anger, feeling of hopelessness, worthlessness,

34
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:14,874
turn to the outside and she becomes a monster. On her journey

35
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:25,392
to become human again. She one by one meets her family members who each suffer from different

36
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:33,878
kinds of loneliness and become monsters too. First I want to talk about the general idea that became

37
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:44,345
the base of like everything and influenced every area of art and design. We wanted to make a game

38
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:45,186
where we

39
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:55,374
would start from one emotion and build like everything around it, literally turning the

40
00:04:55,554 --> 00:05:04,116
inside, the inner feeling out. K is basically a representation of me and the path I went through

41
00:05:04,176 --> 00:05:13,339
to overcome my struggles. I wanted to share my journey in the form of a game. If we look at her,

42
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:22,019
someone spilled ink over the otherwise colorful painting.

43
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,924
Her presence on the screen is a personified void,

44
00:05:27,965 --> 00:05:33,369
if you will, representative for the loneliness

45
00:05:33,489 --> 00:05:36,312
and hopelessness of her situation.

46
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:40,876
I can tell you from the feedback we got after the release

47
00:05:42,145 --> 00:05:48,927
massive inspiration I drew from real life experience that on one side this approach

48
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:56,530
to develop a game is one of the biggest chances like from personal

49
00:05:58,231 --> 00:06:04,233
background then there's the biggest chance to be artistically unique and successful but

50
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:10,479
It's also one of the biggest risks for the development of a game,

51
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,844
as you constantly, sometimes like for years, need to deal with this topic.

52
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:21,789
So drawing your game story from your own life can be very tough.

53
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:29,616
Seeing Kay every day, being confronted with my personal struggles at work every day.

54
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:38,133
So basically I always had my baggage with me. Mechanically and artistically I wanted an

55
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:45,615
iconic gadget on Kay's back that represents this feeling of emotional ballast.

56
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:49,867
which tea isn't processing in a healthy way.

57
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:54,191
In the game you put manifested struggles or worries

58
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:58,294
in this backpack to clear the environment of it.

59
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:02,578
As the game progresses, this backpack gets bigger

60
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:06,302
and bigger until it bursts open.

61
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:15,637
an overwhelming K all at once with the struggles she put in there and causing her to have a

62
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:25,222
nervous breakdown. The backpack also serves as a visual help to spot K even in the darker areas of

63
00:07:25,242 --> 00:07:32,546
the painting. My show's narrative perspective was not just literally telling and showing you what

64
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:34,887
happened but putting it all

65
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:46,163
in a metaphorical world so people could make up their own mind, put in their own thoughts and past

66
00:07:46,864 --> 00:07:55,389
into sea of solitude. Another cornerstone of SOS is my artistic background as mentioned. I started

67
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:59,452
my career as a comic artist and I'm in general a huge comic fan.

68
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:03,789
My first big comic love had been the manga Akira.

69
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,433
I especially love the comic style semi-realism.

70
00:08:09,453 --> 00:08:12,855
So not completely realistic but like a mix of the two.

71
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:14,676
Like for example Akira.

72
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,678
And I tried to put it into Sea of Solitude 2.

73
00:08:20,315 --> 00:08:22,437
So the last cornerstone is my origin.

74
00:08:23,197 --> 00:08:25,259
I was born and grew up in a fishing village,

75
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,361
directly on the shore.

76
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:31,825
My family had been fishermen, are still fishermen.

77
00:08:32,986 --> 00:08:37,390
So swimming, boat driving, the sea guards water

78
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,173
are very common for me, it's where I'm from.

79
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,496
Those points, the metaphorical narrative,

80
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:49,784
of my personal story, party, my professional background,

81
00:08:50,244 --> 00:08:52,286
and the love for comics,

82
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:55,048
and me growing up directly on the shore,

83
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:58,751
had been the base for all artistic decisions.

84
00:08:59,592 --> 00:09:01,894
Let's start with the environment art.

85
00:09:02,295 --> 00:09:06,078
The story of Solitude plays out in Kay's mind.

86
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:09,821
That means that what she goes through in real life,

87
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:12,323
we see through her inner eyes.

88
00:09:13,355 --> 00:09:20,218
For the setting, I chose Berlin, the city where I live now for 20 years already.

89
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:28,742
I tried to make a more romanticized version of Berlin. For example, the Japanese actors portray

90
00:09:29,022 --> 00:09:34,444
Germany often, like in Ghibli movies, like Kiki's Delivery Service here as an example.

91
00:09:36,245 --> 00:09:40,007
So we partly took original places from Berlin.

92
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:43,081
and remodeled it for Sea of Solitude.

93
00:09:43,642 --> 00:09:49,270
One example is the above ground subway station called Bülowstraße.

94
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:53,055
Here is the in-game version, you see.

95
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:57,561
And here is the original in-game.

96
00:09:58,477 --> 00:10:08,699
original. We reduced the detail to a minimum necessary to fit our style, but still kept

97
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:17,520
the most prominent details to keep it recognizable. The overboarding feeling Kay has throughout

98
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:24,041
the majority of the game is isolation, and that she is desperate to try and connect with

99
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:24,362
people.

100
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:35,043
with these basic emotions of her, I decided that the city should look as empty as possible.

101
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:47,066
Really no sign of life above the water, like even plants are missing. I didn't want to show

102
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:52,528
a post-apocalyptic setting which would have washed out the metaphorical meaning.

103
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,331
So it's a normal, modern, clean city.

104
00:10:56,431 --> 00:11:01,333
It's just empty, as if the people just vanished from one second to the next.

105
00:11:02,473 --> 00:11:05,555
What we did so was putting everywhere on the ground

106
00:11:07,315 --> 00:11:12,397
sand to enhance the feeling of an ocean.

107
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:21,355
So here you can see some signs of disruption in the far corner.

108
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:26,118
So only the outer circle of the city looks like this.

109
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:31,481
The further away you get from the center of the mind of Cain and of the city,

110
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:38,065
the houses begin to vanish or crumble down and they begin to sink

111
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:42,288
into the ocean and are crooked and even the streets and trains are damaged.

112
00:11:44,676 --> 00:11:48,778
Throughout the prototyping phase, we encountered an interesting challenge.

113
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:55,422
Berlin's houses include like rooftops and walls.

114
00:11:55,782 --> 00:12:04,007
They are like problematic for interesting level design compared, for example, to New York City.

115
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:12,022
We look at it here, like the houses in Berlin have rather like clean design,

116
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:20,464
like nothing beside balconies stick out of the walls, like very much. No ACs or

117
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:28,047
outer fire escapes and we Germans rarely put advertising posters on top of buildings or

118
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:28,327
something.

119
00:12:29,043 --> 00:12:36,686
So all of these things that are often seen on American households are missing in Berlin.

120
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:42,428
So on top of these design issues, we Germans grew up with...

121
00:12:45,744 --> 00:12:54,229
a ton of American media, be it movies, music, comics. It almost feels like home to us because

122
00:12:54,249 --> 00:13:00,993
we are constantly having it in the media, how America looks like and what they are doing.

123
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:10,318
So it almost feels like home, but it isn't our home. So it took us quite a while to create and

124
00:13:10,894 --> 00:13:19,076
explorable gameplay, like explorable architecture that still looks like somehow like Berlin.

125
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:27,058
So we basically extruded like everything more than it is in reality. Here are like

126
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:30,359
some examples like the flat two-type Berlin house wall.

127
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:37,837
So if we extruded it, so light and shadow display would be a bit more intense,

128
00:13:38,338 --> 00:13:43,861
so that depth, but also most important that the households and the rooftops become

129
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:52,247
explorable pathways. So the constant, I'm sorry for the image here, the constant urge

130
00:13:53,028 --> 00:14:00,673
to put in American architecture had been quite big, but we soon saw that even when we accidentally

131
00:14:01,855 --> 00:14:08,698
put just one detail like a typical iconic American rooftop water tanks, which you see

132
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:16,601
on the right, and suddenly our complete effort to portray a European city had been destroyed.

133
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:26,645
So another basic design for me is less is more. To achieve a distinctivity of

134
00:14:26,685 --> 00:14:29,026
solitude environment art, I tried

135
00:14:30,323 --> 00:14:35,627
to design it with as few details as possible.

136
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:44,734
But still, every detail needed in there to make the architecture believable.

137
00:14:46,876 --> 00:14:47,236
For me...

138
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:55,028
To make architecture believable, the most important aspect to get it to feel right is to understand

139
00:14:55,128 --> 00:15:05,576
its function and to include the aspects that are needed to put and hold it into the place where

140
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:11,701
it's meant to be. So a tiny example is like the balcony railings. The metal plate

141
00:15:12,132 --> 00:15:18,673
that is tied to the wall with the boltings to hold the construction in place is something

142
00:15:18,693 --> 00:15:25,695
that I wanted the artist to add, this little thing. While other parts like decoration and

143
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:31,197
aspects could be reduced to a minimum. We applied...

144
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:40,826
Okay, we applied everything I said to circa to exactly 159 unique buildings.

145
00:15:41,747 --> 00:15:49,509
At least 90 of these buildings were used at least twice or up to four times revisited.

146
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,754
like twice or up to four times within the whole game, which made the design of the city and the

147
00:15:55,794 --> 00:16:04,840
polishing so challenging with only one 3D artist beside me, one extra 3D artist and two level

148
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:13,106
designers. So, and I explain now more in detail, we come now to the biggest topic of the whole

149
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,427
production, water.

150
00:16:15,884 --> 00:16:21,551
So I love games very much where I constantly roam in the same environment.

151
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:23,733
So it is more memorable.

152
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:25,935
Like it starts feeling like home.

153
00:16:26,436 --> 00:16:30,701
Like Resident Evil or Dark Souls or Gone Home.

154
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:32,743
Like some examples.

155
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:35,246
So when I did the first

156
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:44,243
level design sketches. I tried to apply what I call the spaghetti level design. So you come back

157
00:16:45,443 --> 00:16:51,244
always to the same area again or often to the same area again to different perspectives. In our case

158
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:58,466
the different perspectives are like rising and lowering the water level. So it was a key to that

159
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:05,687
yeah and it also became one of the most unique features.

160
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:11,141
For the SOS art-wise, but also like gameplay,

161
00:17:12,402 --> 00:17:18,904
the water is like the biggest symbol we have in the game.

162
00:17:18,944 --> 00:17:22,585
You're literally walking or swimming

163
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:24,626
through a flooded world.

164
00:17:25,206 --> 00:17:27,487
And this flooded world is like flooded

165
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:29,447
by the main character's tears.

166
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:33,108
So her very own ocean of tears.

167
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:34,789
From the very beginning, I wanted to,

168
00:17:35,674 --> 00:17:43,017
the water to feel as cozy as possible and clear as if you look into a swimming pool,

169
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:50,700
but even without realistic refraction, so that you sense that it is no real water,

170
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,600
but might have a different meaning.

171
00:17:54,062 --> 00:18:01,406
The clearness combined with the spaghetti level design lets you see areas underwater

172
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:08,690
and the water surface that you like later in the game will have access to.

173
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:19,696
Here are some crappy examples, some examples of the water settings that we could adjust like

174
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:28,554
wave speed or wave height, foam color, foam distortion, foam, the fog underwater, like

175
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:34,595
yeah, regulate everything of this, every of these aspects.

176
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:45,037
The key design rule I gave to my environment artist was I want the SOS environment to look

177
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:46,178
like a holiday.

178
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:57,981
destination with many islands and gentle beaches. It took us a while to find the right angle

179
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:05,948
and color of the rooftops so they are really giving you that beach feeling while still

180
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:07,049
looking like rooftops.

181
00:19:07,723 --> 00:19:13,046
Like a lot of rooftops normally are like this in Berlin and we had to find the area that

182
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:16,888
it almost looked like the beach but still like the Berlin rooftops. It was really

183
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:24,492
a challenge but interesting. Those aspects combined like the clear water, the spaghetti

184
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:32,195
level design and the beach feeling of the rooftops are one of the key elements of the distinctive

185
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:34,877
environment art of Sea of Solitude.

186
00:19:36,656 --> 00:19:44,342
I knew we had several heavy topics we talked about in SOS, so I felt like giving the game

187
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:49,405
a light-hearted visual appeal as often

188
00:19:50,283 --> 00:19:53,485
as possible was really important and essential.

189
00:19:53,946 --> 00:19:59,730
And that we don't flood the player with negative feelings all the time,

190
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,731
from all angles, like everywhere.

191
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:08,076
So this was really important to me to achieve that light-hearted feeling

192
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,938
to compensate for the sappy topics.

193
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:14,100
We have a strong color palette.

194
00:20:16,245 --> 00:20:20,106
with many different weathers, so we tried to achieve that.

195
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:26,087
Same as the water height is affected by the emotions of Kay,

196
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:34,349
the weather is also affected by her mood and connected to her mood.

197
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:42,171
So from very early on, it became clear that the sunny weather

198
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:43,972
that represents the feeling...

199
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:52,028
of positivity and adventuredness needs to be present as often as possible.

200
00:20:52,048 --> 00:21:00,013
When we made the first roadmap of color schemes based on the emotion Kei is going through in the

201
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:07,818
game, there was way too much darkness. I remember how playtesting

202
00:21:08,682 --> 00:21:17,249
made us almost feel like depressed as the sad story and the sad color scheme over a long period

203
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:25,175
was just it was just way too much. So I started to try to give the negative weathers like the

204
00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:33,281
rainy weather for example and where the huge underwater creature is lurking a more positive

205
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:38,025
vibe of colors especially for the water. I tried to give

206
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:48,368
the water looks scary. I tried to make it look less scary by making it appear to glow from the depth.

207
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:59,015
I made the background fork lighter than the fork goes by. And I gave it a bit more purple and blue

208
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:02,838
as it would have initially.

209
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:08,966
yeah it was important to put it in to help calm the tense feeling.

210
00:22:10,086 --> 00:22:20,854
So in the second level I wanted to portray the heated situation between the parents of Kelly,

211
00:22:20,934 --> 00:22:28,119
the boiling suppressed anger of them both, of the parents. It was clear red was the main

212
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:33,443
color of choice here. But same as in the rainy

213
00:22:34,023 --> 00:22:42,245
weather, we mixed, we needed to mix some more calming colors such as yellow and brown into the

214
00:22:42,285 --> 00:22:49,947
scene. The glowing effect of the water being able to see far and clear what's going on beneath the

215
00:22:49,987 --> 00:22:57,788
water surface was important again to fight against the too intense feeling of the story

216
00:22:57,848 --> 00:23:01,029
portrayed in that level. It was really important that we added it.

217
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:12,460
And as you can see in level 2 and 3, the water and the sky are covering much more of the screen,

218
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:18,004
really like drowning the city in the colors because the water level has risen so much

219
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:26,751
in these levels already. So as often as possible we put sunny weather parts into the game.

220
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:34,451
to let the player relax before we pushed them into like tension again.

221
00:23:34,471 --> 00:23:39,013
So this color scheme of the boyfriend's level

222
00:23:39,313 --> 00:23:41,455
had been the easiest to achieve.

223
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:46,137
Like we show someone who hides his depression

224
00:23:47,318 --> 00:23:51,140
behind appearing like totally fine and happy and healthy,

225
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,222
showing this whole city of the game and suddenly, suddenly

226
00:23:55,322 --> 00:23:56,863
it's sick.

227
00:23:57,909 --> 00:24:05,056
fluffy white snow cover was fitting perfectly to the mood we wanted to transport there.

228
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:14,925
So this all white and cozy feelings came right before the final level. Our main character

229
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:22,853
finally faced her own issues. We're portraying a breakdown, the absolute feeling of being completely

230
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:23,713
alone and numb.

231
00:24:24,732 --> 00:24:31,017
It was clear I wanted to have it as dark and black as possible.

232
00:24:31,077 --> 00:24:32,598
No colors, dense fog.

233
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:36,321
So I hope you can see anything here.

234
00:24:37,522 --> 00:24:43,067
In general, we had many issues with our main color, black, in the game.

235
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:52,114
How dark can you turn the game before it becomes hard to watch or understand where you are?

236
00:24:53,285 --> 00:25:01,451
A huge issue is the many different monitors we needed to adjust the game colors to.

237
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:08,715
I always wanted to go as dark as possible, but when we tested the game on another PC,

238
00:25:08,795 --> 00:25:11,357
it was often like simply pitch black.

239
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:18,142
We prevented total navigational loss of the player by adding two thick.

240
00:25:18,844 --> 00:25:29,453
One was a subtle light source around K, so the player could always see what is around them.

241
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:36,519
The second important help was again to make the background fog lighter than the fog close by,

242
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:41,303
so you have the silhouette. With that you can always see like this silhouette of the

243
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:52,622
clearing which functions as landmarks. With those tricks I could finally have my

244
00:25:53,796 --> 00:26:01,640
pitch black parts to. So one of the biggest challenges when we created

245
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:10,585
Tea of Solitude had been our manpower. Creating a game of that size with a team of 12

246
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:15,547
made us come up with a unique design process.

247
00:26:17,455 --> 00:26:25,559
As I mentioned before, I had been not only the art director, but also the brighter main game designer,

248
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:32,742
had with the level design, did the level design schedules, and did the level art with one other

249
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:39,625
level artist beside, and had other responsibilities like the company had.

250
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:46,148
So in the first years of the concept phase, I just had one program helping me with like

251
00:26:47,158 --> 00:26:53,721
Sea of Solitude and we needed to work on other games too that kept the company afloat while

252
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:59,765
we were finding the right approach for Sea of Solitude. So it was like a really just two people

253
00:26:59,805 --> 00:27:08,650
team at the beginning, me and one programmer. So I basically just had time to do one key artwork.

254
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,092
for the environment art at the beginning.

255
00:27:12,112 --> 00:27:17,415
So I did it in my favorite 2D tool, like Photoshop,

256
00:27:17,816 --> 00:27:18,736
Adobe Photoshop.

257
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:22,579
I usually work with like many layers in Photoshop

258
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:26,482
and often use like the so-called blending modes

259
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:31,866
for those layers, like multiply, like overlay and transparency.

260
00:27:31,946 --> 00:27:34,147
I use transparency, gradients and masks.

261
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:37,230
I love using all this for my style.

262
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:48,688
So when I finished that one key artwork, I walked up to my one programmer and showed him exactly

263
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:56,113
how I made this key artwork in Photoshop and asked him if he can reproduce

264
00:27:57,334 --> 00:28:01,617
this immunity as a tool for 3D environment.

265
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:09,604
so that he creates something in unity that I can work the same way I would work in 2D photoshop.

266
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:19,309
Because of the tiny team size, we early on decided to not use any textures

267
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:28,875
in the environment. So even like cracks on the wall and the leaves are triangles.

268
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:36,493
and that had been a huge advantage as we didn't need to unwrap anything or texture,

269
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:46,758
we could scale and squeeze the models freely. We also didn't need to spend time creating textures

270
00:28:47,738 --> 00:28:55,902
as mentioned and because of this we could build almost a whole city district, like a real whole

271
00:28:56,343 --> 00:28:57,663
city district was just.

272
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:09,224
one environment artist needs. So to bring life to the

273
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:17,711
untextual environment, I asked my programmer for various tools to help me. Coloring the shadow

274
00:29:18,852 --> 00:29:24,557
and ambient occlusion was really important that I could like really color it however I want.

275
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:35,437
We also misused the specular component of the materials in Unity and used just slightly

276
00:29:35,537 --> 00:29:39,519
different colors within this specular gradient.

277
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:46,982
So when you move through the world of SOS, this effect brings more life into the world

278
00:29:47,062 --> 00:29:49,162
without you really noticing it.

279
00:29:49,783 --> 00:29:51,683
It makes SOS look less blunt.

280
00:29:53,063 --> 00:29:57,886
That was a really cool check, I feel.

281
00:30:00,408 --> 00:30:03,410
So, I used the gradient.

282
00:30:04,147 --> 00:30:10,072
in Photoshop create like distance fog and also ground fog like for this concept art I did.

283
00:30:10,472 --> 00:30:18,659
So the specialty in SOS had been that I needed fog over and under water but the fog over water

284
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:25,765
shouldn't affect everything underwater and vice versa. So our programmer Dirk

285
00:30:26,438 --> 00:30:31,403
step by step built me a Vasa system tool in Unity,

286
00:30:31,823 --> 00:30:36,187
where I could almost use the same workflow

287
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:37,328
I had in Photoshop.

288
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:39,530
With that...

289
00:30:40,357 --> 00:30:48,740
I didn't need to spend time painting artworks, but I could directly build a one-to-one example for

290
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:55,102
my whole team, where they didn't need to interpret my drawings, but could see like the final product

291
00:30:55,743 --> 00:31:01,525
and use that as a blueprint for everything they needed to create and see of Solitude.

292
00:31:02,345 --> 00:31:05,847
So remember, we were only 12 people, we need to iterate fast.

293
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:16,848
And if you do the same, I advise you to build tools that makes you as flexible as possible.

294
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:25,616
So that brings me to the second biggest art direction aspect next to the environment art,

295
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:33,223
the monster design. In general, we have two different types of monsters.

296
00:31:34,219 --> 00:31:40,364
in SOS, K's monsters and the monsters of the family of K.

297
00:31:41,345 --> 00:31:48,991
All of them are based on the human behind it, mixed with the biggest emotion they have.

298
00:31:49,651 --> 00:31:52,734
These aspects manifest into their monster form.

299
00:31:57,807 --> 00:32:05,291
When I did the very first sketch of Monsters in Sea of Solitude, I sat down in front of a blank paper

300
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:16,778
and I imagined how I would feel when I'm at the absolute lowest point, like angry and sad.

301
00:32:17,158 --> 00:32:23,482
So I rather scratched over the paper and then drawing anything particular.

302
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,661
and a black ball of lines came out of the session.

303
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:33,602
So I started to bring this basic idea

304
00:32:33,822 --> 00:32:37,723
of how manifested anger and sadness could look like

305
00:32:38,243 --> 00:32:40,104
into a human form.

306
00:32:41,404 --> 00:32:45,425
While doing so, the wired lines

307
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,646
turned slowly into a feathery fur.

308
00:32:49,889 --> 00:32:56,472
Then I imagined that in order to still go on in life, not giving up,

309
00:32:57,393 --> 00:33:07,478
even though you go through all these hardships, you need to still have a flame of hope burning inside you.

310
00:33:08,215 --> 00:33:19,661
So I drew this monster with red, orange light shining from the inside out

311
00:33:20,201 --> 00:33:26,744
and through their mouth and through their eyes. This is the base of all monsters you

312
00:33:26,844 --> 00:33:32,506
encounter in the game. A black appearance with red shining eyes and mouth.

313
00:33:33,622 --> 00:33:38,264
A short comment before I go deeper into the family monster designs.

314
00:33:39,545 --> 00:33:48,090
The stories about the parents and about the brother are not taken from my life.

315
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:55,094
I have no brother and my parents are now happily married for over 40 years.

316
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:56,815
40 years.

317
00:33:57,816 --> 00:34:00,938
So those stories are inspired by colleagues and friends.

318
00:34:02,537 --> 00:34:10,324
The brother monster had been the first family monster I did a concept art of.

319
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:20,033
The brother gets bullied in school by his former friends and he suffers from harsh self-doubt.

320
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:26,459
Like unsure for a long time if he is a problem in this whole issue.

321
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,442
So the longer he is in this situation, the stronger his buddhies are harassing him.

322
00:34:33,463 --> 00:34:45,729
The first of the strongest emotions he has is this urge to just want to fly away from this situation.

323
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:52,353
Like the birds he used to watch through the school windows during lessons.

324
00:34:53,699 --> 00:35:03,882
This is why his monster version appears like a huge bird, in particular a raven mixed with a human body.

325
00:35:06,142 --> 00:35:13,804
He is constantly surrounded by his own weather, which reflects his emotions too.

326
00:35:14,425 --> 00:35:21,486
The second emotion next to the urge to fly away is fear to be seen.

327
00:35:22,612 --> 00:35:28,314
He wants to hide because his buddies start harassing him as soon as they see him.

328
00:35:29,575 --> 00:35:37,498
So I created a thick fog around him, almost colorless, where he hides inside.

329
00:35:38,418 --> 00:35:46,061
His water is special, as it is the only one where you can instantly die.

330
00:35:47,026 --> 00:35:52,449
As mentioned before, the water stands for the ocean of tears, desperation, sadness.

331
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:59,694
So his emotional state is already so bad that we decided to make his water deadly.

332
00:36:00,554 --> 00:36:08,039
When Kay falls into that water, hands of the Buddhists obstruct, grab her and drown her.

333
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,201
The father of Kay,

334
00:36:17,022 --> 00:36:21,426
to leave his wife, as they married rather early

335
00:36:21,766 --> 00:36:24,690
in their life and just grew apart.

336
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:29,334
They tried over many years to fix the marriage,

337
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:33,679
but sometimes it just didn't work out.

338
00:36:34,299 --> 00:36:38,524
And the longer they tried, the unhealthier

339
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:39,845
the whole situation became.

340
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:49,644
As he, the father, struggles to openly tell his wife what he feels and rather avoid confrontation,

341
00:36:50,145 --> 00:37:00,531
he starts hiding from her by working way too much. So I drew his monster version as a big chameleon

342
00:37:00,691 --> 00:37:08,375
mixed with a human. I wanted to show with little details like that he is still wearing his wedding

343
00:37:08,455 --> 00:37:08,655
ring.

344
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:15,321
even as a monster that he loves his family.

345
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:20,243
We encounter him first on the skyscraper

346
00:37:20,344 --> 00:37:21,884
where his office is.

347
00:37:22,545 --> 00:37:25,426
I wondered that the building looks almost destroyed.

348
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:28,408
The father monster and the mother monster

349
00:37:28,828 --> 00:37:30,749
fighting for a long while already.

350
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:34,472
She tried to get him out of the skyscrapers

351
00:37:34,812 --> 00:37:37,433
and with this, she destroyed it almost.

352
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:46,995
Also, I designed the interior of the building, or I had the idea for the design of the interior

353
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:54,900
building as rather empty and cold. Same as the father feels. He sits on top of the building,

354
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,301
angrily, angrily crying out.

355
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:07,317
His screams produce steam streams that comes out of every vent inside the skyscraper and

356
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:09,818
push K, the player, away.

357
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:17,503
The father monster tries to avoid touching the water, the ocean of tears, like the plaque,

358
00:38:18,104 --> 00:38:23,407
as he is unwilling to really deal with his own issues.

359
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,208
He can't even swim.

360
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:27,390
The mother monster

361
00:38:28,464 --> 00:38:34,346
looks like a giant octopus mixed with a female head.

362
00:38:34,366 --> 00:38:40,208
She is about 10 times a lot bigger than the father monster.

363
00:38:41,848 --> 00:38:46,929
I imagined like a loving mother that desperately tries

364
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,070
to hold the families, the whole family together,

365
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,631
tries to hold onto like everything

366
00:38:54,391 --> 00:38:56,832
and keep it from crumbling apart.

367
00:38:57,812 --> 00:39:02,655
So she needed many arms and I immediately thought of an octopus.

368
00:39:03,976 --> 00:39:12,661
The mother monster is often completely underwater and that means that she is constantly worrying

369
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:20,026
and sad but as soon as her daughter or husband shows up she comes out of the water and at least

370
00:39:20,106 --> 00:39:27,210
try to appear confident. The mother monster and father monster share a huge

371
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:35,943
weather surrounding them. So we have this dramatic like red and orange colors throughout most of their

372
00:39:36,063 --> 00:39:42,825
level. It stands for the end of their partnership but also the heat of tension surrounding them.

373
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:51,248
The water level is much higher than in the brother's level beforehand as both like the

374
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:57,450
mother and the father suffer from a profound loneliness within their relationship.

375
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:02,144
that affects the whole family, including their children.

376
00:40:03,044 --> 00:40:05,705
The final argument those two have

377
00:40:06,165 --> 00:40:10,046
in the destroyed version of the home in the game,

378
00:40:11,146 --> 00:40:12,947
it looks like a bombed crater.

379
00:40:13,067 --> 00:40:16,527
I hope you can see that in the concept.

380
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:23,269
When the player comes to the home at first, it's still intact.

381
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:32,436
and it's also the only place next to the end of the game where you see plants and vegetation,

382
00:40:32,937 --> 00:40:44,286
plants and vegetation in general. It stands for that Kay feels most healthy there at her home,

383
00:40:45,247 --> 00:40:52,213
so she can see the life which she can't throughout most of the game.

384
00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:53,856
So you can see it there.

385
00:40:56,117 --> 00:41:04,643
So the monster, the boyfriend monster, is the most unique one of all family monsters.

386
00:41:05,304 --> 00:41:10,647
Kay's boyfriend suffers from depression, but tries to appear fine to the outside.

387
00:41:11,007 --> 00:41:20,254
He is doing pretty well until he falls in love with Kay and is finally forced to open up about his struggles.

388
00:41:21,135 --> 00:41:28,140
So when we meet the boyfriend monster first, he appears like a shiny white wolf, like white

389
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,000
lone wolf.

390
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:34,063
Throughout the development, the whole development of Sea of Solitude, I educate myself about

391
00:41:34,103 --> 00:41:40,627
mental health a lot, but also about metaphors, symbols, and so on.

392
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:47,972
The lone wolf is a typical symbol for a man that tends to act independently and spend

393
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,133
more time alone than in groups.

394
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,464
And it is not only him I portray shiny and white.

395
00:41:56,044 --> 00:41:59,527
In his level, the whole Berlin district

396
00:41:59,988 --> 00:42:03,371
where SOS takes place is snowed in.

397
00:42:04,111 --> 00:42:06,213
And he is like really, really good

398
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,175
at camouflaging his real feelings.

399
00:42:08,215 --> 00:42:13,099
So he put the whole game under a cozy white snow layer.

400
00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:20,383
So every time he interacts with Kay in the game and she touches him,

401
00:42:20,883 --> 00:42:29,029
part of his white perfect camouflage falls off and we see the black dog beneath it,

402
00:42:29,189 --> 00:42:38,976
which is a known metaphor for depression. I again designed him part human and part animal.

403
00:42:41,498 --> 00:42:41,838
Kay.

404
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:49,163
The main character itself, I wanted to portray in a different way.

405
00:42:49,183 --> 00:42:53,844
And as ripped apart into her basic emotions,

406
00:42:54,545 --> 00:42:57,226
all of these emotions coming to life.

407
00:42:57,826 --> 00:43:01,047
And she needs to interact with them throughout the entire game.

408
00:43:02,649 --> 00:43:11,673
I took her strongest emotions like self-doubt, joy, self-destruction, hope and willpower.

409
00:43:12,213 --> 00:43:15,855
The playable character represents willpower.

410
00:43:16,295 --> 00:43:23,218
She looks much more like a human than every other monster as she is the closest to recovery.

411
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:32,489
But of course I wanted to design the main character more human, so the player can project

412
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:33,530
themselves better onto it.

413
00:43:35,731 --> 00:43:42,197
Kay is actually completely naked, which was important to me to portray how vulnerable

414
00:43:42,257 --> 00:43:47,702
she is in the state of change and transition to a more healthy life.

415
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:51,945
The only thing Kay wears is her backpack.

416
00:43:53,438 --> 00:43:58,300
It carries the baggage we all carry throughout our life.

417
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:05,102
She doesn't know how to cope with all these emotions

418
00:44:05,662 --> 00:44:06,542
she's going through.

419
00:44:06,582 --> 00:44:10,944
So the backpack becomes bigger and bigger

420
00:44:10,964 --> 00:44:12,284
throughout the game.

421
00:44:13,222 --> 00:44:20,146
until it's like really huge and it bursts and forcing her to finally overcome her own struggles

422
00:44:20,306 --> 00:44:30,672
or all deal with all her emotions. Zeddout is the first other monster you meet, uh,

423
00:44:30,692 --> 00:44:35,535
you really interact with and meet in the game. Um, all of Kay's monsters are partly

424
00:44:36,193 --> 00:44:45,900
her human body. So self-doubt, I choose to mix her with like the human body and with a snail,

425
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:53,325
like especially with a shell. Self-doubt as an emotion always feels to me

426
00:44:54,765 --> 00:45:00,269
as it ends up trying to hide somewhere, like it's hiding, self-doubt and you hide.

427
00:45:01,447 --> 00:45:03,329
Mostly, of course, at home.

428
00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:07,712
So a snail shell is in their home.

429
00:45:09,654 --> 00:45:15,059
The self-doubt monster also has teeth like a small child.

430
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:23,946
I wanted to show that what comes out of the mouth of self-doubt is nothing educated,

431
00:45:25,467 --> 00:45:27,789
but rather like blunt or warm.

432
00:45:29,448 --> 00:45:33,429
often true, but so more childlike.

433
00:45:33,469 --> 00:45:38,091
The self-doubt monster shrinks over the course of the game

434
00:45:38,511 --> 00:45:43,053
until she turns from self-doubt to healthy doubt.

435
00:45:43,913 --> 00:45:48,435
So first she is house high and super scary.

436
00:45:49,736 --> 00:45:52,497
So at the end of the game, Kay can't even take her

437
00:45:52,557 --> 00:45:55,118
in her arms, she's like a baby,

438
00:45:55,298 --> 00:45:58,039
that this healthy doubt incites.

439
00:46:00,682 --> 00:46:06,243
Self-destruction is a mixture between Kay and a siren and a shark.

440
00:46:06,544 --> 00:46:14,845
Like she tries to lurk Kay back into the water, into the ocean of tears so she can swallow Kay again.

441
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:19,706
When I started scribbling her, she was rather soft at the beginning,

442
00:46:19,906 --> 00:46:27,068
self-destruction, and a whale, like a whale. But the more her role became clear,

443
00:46:27,508 --> 00:46:28,928
like the main antagonist.

444
00:46:29,683 --> 00:46:34,726
and the representation of self-destruction.

445
00:46:34,806 --> 00:46:39,368
She more turned into a super creepy being

446
00:46:40,148 --> 00:46:43,250
with this huge sharp teeth.

447
00:46:46,752 --> 00:46:50,494
Okay, so just her torso,

448
00:46:50,554 --> 00:46:52,915
yeah, just her torso and her eyes

449
00:46:53,475 --> 00:46:55,256
are in front of the head.

450
00:46:56,327 --> 00:47:01,611
and not on the side, reminds us that there is also some human part in it.

451
00:47:02,272 --> 00:47:05,154
If you look really closely, you can see that the feet

452
00:47:06,235 --> 00:47:11,059
of Kay's body meld together to form a fin in this monster.

453
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,762
She is always like underwater.

454
00:47:14,982 --> 00:47:17,645
The ocean of tears is her natural habitat.

455
00:47:18,546 --> 00:47:23,069
So self-destruction, same as self-doubt.

456
00:47:26,056 --> 00:47:33,822
shrinks throughout the game so that K can almost lift even self-destruction at the end.

457
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:39,306
Self-destruction is probably the monster you see the most on the internet.

458
00:47:39,346 --> 00:47:46,751
The way she behaves and the way she swims is something we are very proud of

459
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:49,713
because it needed so much work to get it right

460
00:47:50,213 --> 00:47:54,056
and so much attention with complex collision checks to

461
00:47:54,856 --> 00:47:59,919
to turn her around like this the snaker animation that gives her like

462
00:47:59,939 --> 00:48:01,941
this sine curve style

463
00:48:03,682 --> 00:48:04,202
So much work.

464
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,025
So joy

465
00:48:08,985 --> 00:48:12,268
Joy, yeah, we put joy in the category of monster

466
00:48:12,468 --> 00:48:19,072
Even though she doesn't appear that way at the beginning and is rather special in general. I think of joy

467
00:48:19,873 --> 00:48:21,414
as a rather innocent feeling

468
00:48:22,395 --> 00:48:29,480
In innocence I connect with her childhood. So I choose to draw joy as a child version of Cain

469
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,581
She wears a yellow raincoat

470
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:37,154
So she is completely invulnerable to the ocean of tears.

471
00:48:37,775 --> 00:48:42,599
She even can fly just to be sure that she never touches like the water.

472
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:49,705
In the boyfriend monster level, Joy finally shows her monstrous side.

473
00:48:51,146 --> 00:48:56,030
She turns into an obsession monster and attacks Kay.

474
00:48:56,490 --> 00:49:00,013
When she tries to get in, when Kay tries to get in the way

475
00:49:00,053 --> 00:49:01,855
between Joy and the boyfriend.

476
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:10,536
Obsession has sharp teeth and I changed the color to purple for readability purposes.

477
00:49:12,057 --> 00:49:17,782
Another entity in the game is a boat of teeth that she drives.

478
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:27,668
It stands for the hope of K. It also carries the sunny weather with it, like a sphere,

479
00:49:27,768 --> 00:49:33,032
which he gets from joy at the beginning. He gets the sunny weather from joy.

480
00:49:33,752 --> 00:49:42,059
It functions as a safe zone. I wanted to design the boat in a robust but simple way,

481
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:46,582
like hope itself. It is not an emotion

482
00:49:47,213 --> 00:49:49,295
that is loud or profound.

483
00:49:49,836 --> 00:49:54,641
And I feel it is the most important of them all.

484
00:49:57,383 --> 00:50:03,609
The houseboat is the new version of the family's home.

485
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:09,014
So underwater, you can see the broken pieces

486
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,496
of the family home.

487
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:20,366
So above the water, it is a new home, a new houseboat that will carry all family members

488
00:50:20,786 --> 00:50:26,950
with Kay into the new chapter of life, built from the old life.

489
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:41,040
So I often get asked what movies like comic books, books or whatever inspired me for Sea of Solitude.

490
00:50:41,717 --> 00:50:51,622
I then always try to come up with art I love, but the truth is that I didn't look at any other art

491
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:58,966
or any other art to get inspired for Sea of Solitude. It came from the inside.

492
00:51:00,901 --> 00:51:05,562
art-wise, like the visual I drew from everything I learned, the visual like everything I learned

493
00:51:06,383 --> 00:51:15,666
so far and the style I have developed throughout my life so far. For the story I just let out what

494
00:51:15,786 --> 00:51:24,708
I already had in my mind, my feelings. There had been a dangerous situation in between when I looked

495
00:51:24,968 --> 00:51:26,709
at other art for once too much.

496
00:51:27,887 --> 00:51:35,076
When the last Guardian, the game, the last Guardian came out, I was so excited about it

497
00:51:35,777 --> 00:51:42,846
that I almost studied like this design of Trico, of this huge animal in the game.

498
00:51:44,287 --> 00:51:51,730
At the same time back then I was still designing the monsters of SOS and at some point my co-workers

499
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:58,193
came to me and said like Connie and your monster design looks so different now almost like

500
00:51:58,453 --> 00:52:07,396
Trico. It was like a little bit like a shock as I didn't realize this until the moment they told

501
00:52:07,436 --> 00:52:13,539
me about it. Like oh gladly I still could revert the damage back then I have done.

502
00:52:14,235 --> 00:52:20,159
So what I learned through the whole production of SOS,

503
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:26,864
be it for the art, the story or every creative process,

504
00:52:27,584 --> 00:52:31,347
draw from what is inside you.

505
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:35,710
Then it will have the biggest chance to be unique.

506
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:39,592
Adore other's art, but be careful

507
00:52:39,612 --> 00:52:42,615
to not adapt it accidentally.

508
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:51,104
I stopped looking at others art too much at some point and I think this is why

509
00:52:51,124 --> 00:52:59,667
the Solitude became a bit more unique. From now on I will always follow the path of first

510
00:52:59,787 --> 00:53:06,469
looking inside me, take the strongest emotion or thought I have at the point in my life

511
00:53:06,889 --> 00:53:12,811
and use that as a base for the art or the games I want to create.

512
00:53:13,827 --> 00:53:22,249
This way it will likely have the personality, have personality and will be unique.

513
00:53:22,889 --> 00:53:32,712
And I think that is the key we all, all the artists out there, want to achieve. Thank you.
