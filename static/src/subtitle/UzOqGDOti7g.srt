1
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,672
Awesome. Hi, everyone. My name is Abby Sherlock.

2
00:00:16,072 --> 00:00:19,173
Greetings from sunny Los Angeles to San Francisco.

3
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,494
This is the Dramaturgy of Video Games,

4
00:00:21,894 --> 00:00:23,335
Theater, Story, and Empathy,

5
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,476
which is a part of the Game Narrative Summit.

6
00:00:25,496 --> 00:00:26,836
So let's get this started.

7
00:00:27,216 --> 00:00:30,398
So talking about why this talk, how did this come to be?

8
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:32,518
I saw the chat earlier,

9
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:35,700
saw all the theater kids in our audience sprinkling in.

10
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:52,502
This kind of came to me when I went to my first E3 back in 2018, and I realized when I was talking to folks at different events, so many folks had been cast or crew in, you know, theater plays in high school, or they did a theater undergrad, or they just really

11
00:00:52,562 --> 00:01:04,349
loved musical theater and they listened to musical theater all the time in their car and we just talked about the shared love of theater so I was like there has to be something there about that connection about game dev to theater pipeline and vice versa.

12
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:10,791
So previous GDC academic topics on the subject did talk a lot about immersive theater and LARPing,

13
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:17,353
but not really just two comparing and contrasting of the two different mediums and what they mean

14
00:01:17,373 --> 00:01:21,755
to each other and how they relate to each other. And this was true for my own story and for my own

15
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:27,717
path. My most recent project was inspired by Tennessee Williams plays taking place in the rural

16
00:01:28,157 --> 00:01:54,632
South United States. And then I actually do a lot of work on camera hosting, which is so much like performing and acting. It's basically the same thing. And that was kind of a grew out of right, I was at an event, I had a broadcast producer who said, Hey, Abby, you can talk go on camera. And I said, Cool. All right, here I am, I guess. And kind of that progression I noticed happens for a lot of other people. And actually, my first professional experience was actually at the La Jolla Playhouse.

17
00:01:55,238 --> 00:02:00,364
uh not in gaming but in theater so as an actor uh kind of again a rundown of why i'm so passionate

18
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:03,268
about this i've been an actor for more than a decade done shakespeare

19
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:09,916
Greek tragedy, I'm stage combat certified, can do swords, knives, ow, getting hit, hitting

20
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:14,239
others, trained at UCLA, Boston University, the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.

21
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:18,503
So this is really in my blood, I would say at this point for the gaming industry, I've

22
00:02:18,563 --> 00:02:24,547
interned kind of all over Wizards of the Coast, some voiceover stuff, hardware, and then

23
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:25,748
Nerdist and Geek and Sentry.

24
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:28,450
Yeah, it's just kind of what I've done in the space, but.

25
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:35,113
talking about, we're going to refer back to my project Heirloom, which is heavy work with performers and VO.

26
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:40,096
And I was a game developer on it, but also a producer and the director, right, of those performers.

27
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:46,499
And it all leads us back to how are these two places tied together, right?

28
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:51,281
So I argue that empathy in games and empathy in theater

29
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:58,283
are the only two forms of storytelling that require active, and I mean active, participation

30
00:02:58,663 --> 00:03:05,846
from the audience or the player. So I, again, this is my hot take, right, that video games are the

31
00:03:05,906 --> 00:03:11,648
most highly evolved form of theater. So we're using technology, right, as a conduit of empathy

32
00:03:11,988 --> 00:03:16,510
and storytelling instead of live performance. Again, nothing I'm saying really is new,

33
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,970
but hopefully the framing of it.

34
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:19,998
can be used in accessible and productive ways

35
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:21,959
for teams to enrich their stories?

36
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,723
What can we creatively steal from the oldest art form around?

37
00:03:26,344 --> 00:03:28,045
So how is this different from books and film?

38
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:30,828
We love our books, big, you know, we love reading,

39
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:34,492
we love movies, but these are very different mediums

40
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:36,854
and they require different kinds of engagement

41
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:37,514
with their audience.

42
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:40,517
So for games, right, the player has to actively

43
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:41,638
move something in real time.

44
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:43,872
unless a cut scene and it happens on its own.

45
00:03:44,012 --> 00:03:46,733
But even then, you might have to press something analog

46
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:48,033
to have something else happen.

47
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,154
But you have to actively move something.

48
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:53,375
If I wanna go left, I'm gonna take my scroller and go left.

49
00:03:53,795 --> 00:03:55,015
And then with theater, right,

50
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:58,797
the audience has to watch actively in real time.

51
00:03:59,077 --> 00:04:01,737
So that means I have to, I'm engaged, I'm watching,

52
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:04,698
and then the performers have to perform actively

53
00:04:04,738 --> 00:04:07,239
in real time, exactly kind of like players too.

54
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:10,108
And you have to be actively watching in these media

55
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:12,590
that is changing as you're watching, right?

56
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,012
You cannot stay static.

57
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,673
You have to keep momentum for them.

58
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:18,414
And you say, how is this different Abby from a book

59
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:20,556
or a film I watched that and it happens.

60
00:04:20,896 --> 00:04:22,738
So if for the book, if I'm reading a book

61
00:04:23,058 --> 00:04:25,380
and it says the character went left and I'm like

62
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,761
what if they went right instead?

63
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:29,083
They can do that in a game.

64
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:31,725
And then in theater, theater metaphor time,

65
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:33,786
if I'm a performer and I'm giving a joke,

66
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:36,688
and I notice that the audience reacted differently,

67
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:39,129
I can change my joke, right, in real time

68
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:41,110
to give the audience more space for laughter,

69
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,830
or I can go quicker if I need to.

70
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,211
That kind of active, I'm like,

71
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:47,772
this activeness that's happening is special.

72
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:50,714
And again, we love our books and we love our movies,

73
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:52,354
but it's not kind of the same, right?

74
00:04:52,855 --> 00:04:55,556
So the actor within player and performer,

75
00:04:55,716 --> 00:04:57,997
and I'm gonna use, you know, these roles, right,

76
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:01,138
that the actor portrays character on stage.

77
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:02,138
That's our theater.

78
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,279
And then games.

79
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:09,105
the player portrays character on screen. So we both have characters, but we have the medium

80
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:13,569
being different and the role being different. And I again, argue that they are the exact

81
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:14,610
same functions really.

82
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,051
and control stream, but they are different mediums.

83
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:18,992
And again, I use this with, you know,

84
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:21,853
first person player that I am the character.

85
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:23,334
I am that character moving on stream.

86
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:26,475
And then acting, I am that performer.

87
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:28,916
I, we can talk, you can talk about method later

88
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:30,857
and I am the character versus portray,

89
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:33,038
but you are that character, right?

90
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:35,899
And so when we're talking about empathy,

91
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,060
I broke this kind of down into three factors

92
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,982
that I think really kind of sum up all of these kind of.

93
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:46,254
similarities between these two worlds. Biggest one, I believe, is empathy. You know, empathy,

94
00:05:46,294 --> 00:05:51,916
the definition being the practice of feeling close to emotionally and personally to someone

95
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:57,818
other than yourself. And I gave this little quote of, I might watch someone cry at a movie theater

96
00:05:58,138 --> 00:06:05,060
or be moved to tears myself, but I myself am not crying as the character within their specific

97
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,981
situation like I would be.

98
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:08,722
in games or theater.

99
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:11,323
And so again, that actor within character

100
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:13,244
and player within character.

101
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,025
And this is a type of relationship

102
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,547
that I have to emphasize that is rarely able

103
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:19,788
to be recreated in other mediums.

104
00:06:20,328 --> 00:06:22,569
Again, theater and games, unlike movies and books,

105
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,151
are not static and are active.

106
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:27,692
And I think this identification process

107
00:06:28,112 --> 00:06:31,714
is never so tightly wound as it is within these two mediums

108
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:33,595
because I think just the, again,

109
00:06:33,615 --> 00:06:35,597
the activeness of their situations.

110
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:41,516
lend it to us of identification. And again, for all my D&D players out there where you become the

111
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:46,379
character or you're a live thing and you become your character, very similar, very similar. And

112
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,583
I use this example here, one of our favorites, Mr. Tom Hiddleston as Hamlet by William Shakespeare.

113
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:56,486
And then Link, one of our, also one of our favorites from The Legend of Zelda, Skyward Sword.

114
00:06:56,926 --> 00:06:58,707
I use this example of a Wii remote.

115
00:06:59,675 --> 00:07:02,075
and this was the first Skyward Sword came out in the Wii

116
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:03,736
before the re-release on Switch.

117
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:07,197
I would use the Wii as the master sword

118
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:11,078
and I as Link was making those cuts on those enemies.

119
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:15,239
And then the actor with Tom Hiddleston as Hamlet,

120
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:16,679
there is that fear, right?

121
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,380
That he's making these cuts and strokes

122
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,441
and we don't know, we hope, right?

123
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:23,902
Player safety, I'm a stage captain, they're gonna be okay.

124
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:25,962
We hope our ensemble, everyone,

125
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:27,002
all the actors are gonna be safe.

126
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:27,943
But there's that.

127
00:07:28,845 --> 00:07:32,246
you don't know what's gonna happen. It's live theater. Maybe what's gonna happen with the sword.

128
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:38,388
And that similar kind of what if is also in Legend of Zelda because if I don't put my arm right,

129
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:44,950
I might die, right? And so that level of I don't know-ness is really important and potent.

130
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,113
And so another factor, we have empathy, now we're talking about catharsis.

131
00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:53,457
So it is a release of emotions for the audience or player.

132
00:07:53,737 --> 00:07:57,580
So emotionally purging oneself is beneficial for humans and innate,

133
00:07:58,121 --> 00:08:01,043
even if you don't know it, what we look for in narratives.

134
00:08:01,403 --> 00:08:04,666
So this goes back all the way to funeral dirges and wailing

135
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:07,968
within Greek theater laments, where you would just, ah,

136
00:08:08,049 --> 00:08:10,691
you would yell because there was nothing else you could do.

137
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:16,035
to get that deep emotion out of you, right? And again, it doesn't have to be as dramatic as that,

138
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:21,438
but we are looking for some sort of release from how our day-to-day lives in our stories.

139
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:26,302
And so it is, again, I said, hopefully brings resolution, right? We're looking for our stories.

140
00:08:26,682 --> 00:08:32,246
Storytelling was used originally to talk with others, share stories, make sense of natural

141
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:36,850
phenomenon, but it also asks us to make sense of ourselves and how we operate.

142
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:41,475
right? And the questions we need to ask ourselves through our stories. And I think this is super

143
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:46,217
important when you're asking for catharsis within your narrative. What am I looking for? What

144
00:08:46,257 --> 00:08:50,519
catharsis am I looking for within my narrative from as a designer standpoint and then also a

145
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:57,181
player standpoint? And I give these kind of very broad action verbs to escape, to feel less alone,

146
00:08:57,282 --> 00:08:58,782
to laugh, to cry, to journey, to feel.

147
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:03,470
But they could be broken down much smaller after that.

148
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,112
But what do you want that player to feel?

149
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:09,054
What catharsis are you aiming for at the end of that experience?

150
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:14,019
Like you see here, strong emotional catharsis in both of these,

151
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:17,462
Ellie in The Last of Us 2 and then The Trojan Woman by Euripides.

152
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:19,343
Then performance, three.

153
00:09:19,423 --> 00:09:21,405
So we have empathy, catharsis, performance.

154
00:09:22,465 --> 00:09:23,968
Someone in the audience maybe is saying,

155
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,893
I'm not performing, Abby, when I'm eating some chips

156
00:09:26,953 --> 00:09:28,716
and I'm laying on my couch in my living room

157
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,758
playing on my game console.

158
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,321
That's not performance, I'm relaxing.

159
00:09:31,702 --> 00:09:31,902
Okay.

160
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,341
We're gonna reframe it.

161
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:35,041
So the act of performing on stage

162
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:36,982
is an actor within character.

163
00:09:37,362 --> 00:09:39,603
And then the act of performing within screen

164
00:09:40,043 --> 00:09:41,844
as player within character.

165
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:45,185
I always say this as friends with a lot of actors myself,

166
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:48,426
if they're by themselves in a room and they're monologuing,

167
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:50,647
they're still an actor and they're still performing,

168
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:52,427
even if they're by themselves.

169
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:53,928
So even if you're by yourself,

170
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:59,649
you're still performing, right? And they both do, both of these mediums require the willing

171
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:04,811
suspension of disbelief to give into these performances. You enter into an agreement,

172
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:11,392
right? That I know this world is not real, but I fully will pretend that it is. And I have to greet

173
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:18,854
it with openness, that I will be affected by what I am seeing in this medium. I will allow myself to

174
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:24,875
feel, right? And that kind of easiness into that is not always, you know, a given, but.

175
00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:31,799
If you again we want to embrace these things as with openness and our hearts for them to change us as much as possible.

176
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:46,185
And then I had to add as someone with a marketing background has worked with influencers and talent streamers that game platforms and streamers are performers role playing publicly I shocked that we don't talk about this more like you see with Meg mage

177
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:47,266
here for cyberpunk 2077 playing.

178
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:55,931
It's so meta, Twitch, because you have a streamer who is, you know, I am performing for my audience,

179
00:10:55,971 --> 00:11:00,475
for my Twitch chat, and a lot of streamers are also performers, right? And then there are also

180
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:05,999
this LARPing, this role-playing that's happening within the game, right? So it's a really cool

181
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,762
phenomenon. And then also some lovely performances in theater, you see the great James Earl Jones and

182
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:11,523
Cecily Tyson.

183
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:27,234
So cool Abby we've talked about you know how are they similar how they beautifully crossover, give me some practicalities help me out I want to, you know, incorporate more of this with my writing team, I'm a small indie studio and I just want my

184
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:36,938
creatives to be stronger. How can we use these principles of drama for game developers so job a turgey as world building for game designers.

185
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:40,160
Then we're going to cover structure, plot, and development.

186
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,822
And then my favorite, probably actor objective work

187
00:11:43,942 --> 00:11:47,323
within game scripts for developing stronger characters.

188
00:11:48,136 --> 00:12:02,563
So dramaturgy is not even in the drama world, I would say, is kind of like in the background, people don't talk about it as much, but it's so cool. I just I it's really neat. Not everyone is always super lucky to have a dramaturge on their staff.

189
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:09,026
In the past productions I've been in our second assistant director was also the dramaturge so some people can double it up but there are.

190
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:24,395
programs out there where you can get a, you know, a degree in dramaturgy, but it is its definition, the study of dramatic composition and representation of those main elements on the stage so that that mean your dramaturge is a researcher, right, of your script

191
00:12:24,435 --> 00:12:26,236
in your world so it is adjacent to a writer.

192
00:12:26,636 --> 00:12:27,718
They work a lot with words.

193
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:32,283
They're basically your lore keeper for all my fellow nerds in the audience.

194
00:12:32,323 --> 00:12:33,144
They keep your lore.

195
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:35,848
They know what the characters want and their needs and how they operate.

196
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:40,093
And I'm going to give some examples that if you're in, you know, game design, you could

197
00:12:40,113 --> 00:12:41,194
hire a consultant for.

198
00:12:41,675 --> 00:12:52,298
drama work specializes maybe in that genre that you are working in a theme or have individual people on your staff that maybe have an interest in it or background on theater class to do it if they're interested.

199
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:57,860
Some examples here with shell games they did an awesome job where they are working on a food.

200
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,924
game, food VR game right and you have different cultures, all different cultures have all

201
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:06,969
different cool foods, so they reached out to academic masters of their crafts on different

202
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:10,192
food to kind of serve as dramaturges on that subject for the game.

203
00:13:10,593 --> 00:13:16,259
And then I personally knew much of the staff for how to defend yourself by Liliana Padilla,

204
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,320
which is about.

205
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:24,343
a group of women learning self-defense on a college campus. And so what Liliana did is had a

206
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:30,466
bunch of women, since it was about Greek American life, sorority women, ask them questions about,

207
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:35,829
you know, what is the specific lingo you're using? Why do you have these practices? And those women

208
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:41,511
kind of acted as dramaturgs, right, to give Liliana the kind of lay of the land of how this

209
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:44,593
world, right, which she didn't know much about how it operated.

210
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,426
And that made her life writing so much easier, right?

211
00:13:49,397 --> 00:14:01,982
So world building research, and I give these kind of little bullet points you can write down, or just things you can ask yourself right internally when you're writing. So, as a dramaturg would ask themselves all of these, I should know all the rules and

212
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:12,206
specifics of how this place operates politically, ethnically, socially, culturally, religiously, what are the demographics, what's the history, all those who love backstories, this kind of works in right here.

213
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:17,248
So metaphysical expressions and specific lingo used in the world.

214
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:29,526
Word choice is so important. I cannot emphasize that enough. Why people say the words that they say says so much about them and their character. I think of the example of y'all.

215
00:14:30,524 --> 00:14:32,225
I'm originally from South Carolina,

216
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:34,166
and when I hear someone use the word y'all,

217
00:14:34,827 --> 00:14:37,768
I immediately think, oh, are they from the South?

218
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:38,509
Where did they learn that?

219
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:39,369
Do they have a family member?

220
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:41,470
And it sets you off on a path, right?

221
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,772
And so word choice is important.

222
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:46,893
When I say that, maybe it tells you a bit about me, right?

223
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:47,894
And if you're doing your character,

224
00:14:47,914 --> 00:14:50,555
their specific word choice would tell you a bit about them.

225
00:14:50,896 --> 00:14:52,536
So again, why this word choice?

226
00:14:53,097 --> 00:14:55,558
How could that word be used in different situations?

227
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:58,921
Does it change meaning if it's used in different situations?

228
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:04,105
And also, does it mean something deeper if the word is used multiple times?

229
00:15:04,886 --> 00:15:08,629
You should know the history and cultural importance of other comparables in the genre.

230
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,473
Knowing what else is out there is going to be so helpful.

231
00:15:12,793 --> 00:15:15,395
And knowing what's already been done, don't remake the wheel.

232
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:18,237
you know, and seeing what people have done really well.

233
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:21,119
And then how can we learn from the design of this genre

234
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:21,859
and other developers?

235
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,020
What are the expectations?

236
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,721
Are your players going to be angry

237
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:27,583
if you don't have a specific, you know, UI element

238
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:28,624
that's typical of that?

239
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:30,505
And there's all these, but for character, right?

240
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:33,867
You say, are there expectations of how relationships operate?

241
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,088
If we don't give them that,

242
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:36,188
are they going to be frustrated?

243
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:39,451
And then again, what these other comparables do well,

244
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:41,132
what did they not do well?

245
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:44,315
And I say this with no shade or shame of like,

246
00:15:44,435 --> 00:15:45,135
oh, not good.

247
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:48,798
But just being self-aware about what you like as a designer

248
00:15:49,118 --> 00:15:52,461
and what you're looking for, I think it's a holistic,

249
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,162
right, you want a holistic viewpoint.

250
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,324
And so second thing we've talked about,

251
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:58,506
so dramaturgy, narrative structure.

252
00:15:58,646 --> 00:16:01,588
So another technical duty the dramaturg could do

253
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:07,834
to help the actors or director would be breaking down, usually in a chart or some other graphic

254
00:16:07,914 --> 00:16:16,102
form, is your emotional beats, right? And I personally, someone ADHD, if you can't tell,

255
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:22,348
love kinesthetic graphs. They're so helpful with sharing with other people,

256
00:16:22,388 --> 00:16:24,610
with your ensemble, with your team, kind of...

257
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,152
your emotional beats. You can write about it and you can talk about it, but when you can show a

258
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:33,435
graphic of it, it's just really impactful. So you should have a physical copy of the emotional beats

259
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:38,697
or narrative track in a graph or visual form. Again, this is something a director would know

260
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:44,540
or a writer would know, and I have this really great game project macro, courtesy of Richard

261
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:49,723
Lamartian, one of my professors for my project, Heirloom, but you can kind of see here how helpful

262
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:53,545
this is because we went through every single moment in our script, in our game.

263
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:56,966
and you charted it out. So your sequence, right? So what is it?

264
00:16:57,686 --> 00:16:59,246
Characters encountered. Who are you meeting?

265
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:03,328
Your brief description of events happening, the location of where that is,

266
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:06,248
the player mechanics. So what is the player doing?

267
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,110
But this, I think, is our little golden nugget here is player goal.

268
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,330
So what does the player want in that moment?

269
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:14,043
music like little arrows in my hand.

270
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:15,885
And then designer goal.

271
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:19,870
What do I as a designer want to communicate in that moment?

272
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,311
Right, and they could be different things.

273
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:22,493
They could be the same thing,

274
00:17:22,713 --> 00:17:24,134
but they could definitely be different things

275
00:17:24,154 --> 00:17:24,895
that they need to be.

276
00:17:25,256 --> 00:17:27,158
But I think the most important is the emotional beat.

277
00:17:27,618 --> 00:17:27,899
What is...

278
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,221
what are all of those elements leading you towards?

279
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:33,382
They should all be in focus of that.

280
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:36,063
And that's gonna give you such a high level of control

281
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:38,765
with your narrative, if you're doing a linear narrative,

282
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:41,787
that you're just gonna be in such better shape.

283
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:44,128
And then if you do have scoping issues, right?

284
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:46,769
Or you're talking about, like, I need this to be shorter.

285
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,811
You can look, right, at your emotional beats

286
00:17:49,931 --> 00:17:52,072
and see, is this in service of, right?

287
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:55,454
As a creative, we're hopefully in service of our projects

288
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,055
and of.

289
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:59,878
you know, making them the best that they can be. Is this in service of the project? Is this in

290
00:17:59,918 --> 00:18:05,763
service of the emotional bead that this moment's leading to? You might need to cut then if it's not.

291
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:10,847
So again, this can take many different forms. A lot of y'all know already the Campbellian

292
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:16,232
hero's journey or a classic rising action, falling action, just being able to track it

293
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:20,655
in some kind of physical structure, right? So again, structure of the holistic project.

294
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:24,659
I should know the writer's journey of the whole experience and be able to map it.

295
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:31,211
on a visual chart. Where is the beginning, the middle, the end? If it's an on rails narrative,

296
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:35,077
does this make sense to the player? And when I mean on reels, I mean like

297
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:37,776
No A, B, C, or D choices.

298
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:39,737
You just got your one choice and that's it.

299
00:18:39,757 --> 00:18:41,578
You're on the rails narrative, Captain Now.

300
00:18:42,499 --> 00:18:45,680
And then do I know the flow and rhythm of the piece, right?

301
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,041
Does it slow down at certain parts?

302
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:49,102
Is it too speedy?

303
00:18:49,602 --> 00:18:50,703
What's its pacing?

304
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,083
It needs to be intentional.

305
00:18:52,123 --> 00:18:55,045
If it's really slow and everyone's like, oh my gosh,

306
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:56,366
like it just keeps going and going,

307
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:58,647
then you're probably gonna need to cut something, right?

308
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:01,108
Because your flow and rhythm is gonna tell you a lot

309
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:03,029
about how playtesting is gonna go too.

310
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:07,533
And then I have to mention this because I have such respect for branching narratives, but

311
00:19:07,993 --> 00:19:13,938
even harder if it's a branching narrative, the acclaimed open world, but does this make sense

312
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:18,883
to the player through each separate storyline? I know as a player myself, there is nothing

313
00:19:18,943 --> 00:19:21,105
more frustrating than picking another path.

314
00:19:21,545 --> 00:19:23,246
than maybe the most popular one,

315
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:26,169
and seeing that it's not as enriching, right?

316
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:29,611
It's not super impactful as maybe that main path would be.

317
00:19:30,072 --> 00:19:33,415
So how can we as designers make that path less traveled by,

318
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:34,976
more enriching and valid?

319
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:37,198
I think it goes back to this emotional beat structure,

320
00:19:37,478 --> 00:19:40,300
where you're gonna need to iron out the emotional beat

321
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,701
of every single path, right?

322
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:43,463
And that's huge scope,

323
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,965
but it is something if you wanna nail it down,

324
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:47,606
it's gonna be really powerful.

325
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,387
And even if I said there's an ideal path,

326
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:53,427
I want as the player to feel like my choice, no matter what, is valid.

327
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:57,371
So again, really good and difficult narrative design is when you can track

328
00:19:57,511 --> 00:20:01,997
each of these through a branching narrative and they all hit equally.

329
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:02,497
Right.

330
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:07,503
So our third thing we're going to talk about is character work.

331
00:20:07,843 --> 00:20:08,064
So.

332
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:13,506
character work. Often an outside actor will do this. Once you give them a script,

333
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:18,329
you've written your script, I'll get my script, I'll write it up, mark it up, as you can see in

334
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:23,912
this lovely example of House Husbands by Heath Thompson. If someone on your team can do this,

335
00:20:24,652 --> 00:20:28,354
or a performance director can, usually they will automatically, it can really help.

336
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:44,270
I want to clarify when recording when I direct my script is I like analog copies I don't, you know, I just want to feel it in my hand I mark it up it is different colors, lots of writing on it and you're using these tools of after study right to use

337
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,671
game narratives that can make.

338
00:20:46,092 --> 00:20:48,433
characters richer and more thought out.

339
00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:50,754
And a dramaturg usually will also do this,

340
00:20:50,995 --> 00:20:52,575
not, you know, again,

341
00:20:52,595 --> 00:20:54,176
you're not doing the actor's job for them

342
00:20:54,216 --> 00:20:55,697
and you're not doing the director's job for them,

343
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:57,438
but as writers, right, or as designers,

344
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:02,081
you are nailing down kind of the exacts of this world.

345
00:21:02,181 --> 00:21:05,243
You're making this, I use a sandbox analogy.

346
00:21:05,543 --> 00:21:06,704
You're using a sandbox.

347
00:21:06,744 --> 00:21:08,705
You're giving them the constraints of the sandbox

348
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:10,606
so then they can go around and play in it.

349
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:12,667
But you need to establish what the constraints are,

350
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:13,848
or you're just gonna be,

351
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:16,775
I don't know, we're not gonna know where you're playing in it.

352
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:19,837
So psychological theories and objectives, right?

353
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:22,739
So I should be able to go through the script

354
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,121
and break up a character's changing objectives

355
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:26,862
through each scene.

356
00:21:27,362 --> 00:21:29,783
Objectives, objectives are super important after work

357
00:21:29,864 --> 00:21:32,305
because it means, I use the example of hunger.

358
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:43,097
I was really hungry all when I woke up this morning, my objective was, I would like some food, and then I had some food and then I was not hungry anymore, my objective change.

359
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:49,861
That's the very simple way of TLDR of using an objective right and so our objectives as humans and as characters.

360
00:21:50,301 --> 00:21:51,582
are ever-changing, right?

361
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:55,583
So usually I would go through and see

362
00:21:55,603 --> 00:21:57,644
kind of what are my objectives throughout the script.

363
00:21:57,744 --> 00:21:59,925
So, and this is super important,

364
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,085
I would say for character work,

365
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:03,306
is what is their objective overall?

366
00:22:03,786 --> 00:22:06,127
What's their big grand master plan?

367
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:07,288
What would they love to have?

368
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,468
What do they see at the pearly gates?

369
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:11,609
What grounds them, right?

370
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:14,711
So these are like these big life-searching questions

371
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:15,651
that are fun, right?

372
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:18,452
As writers to discover about characters.

373
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:18,732
And then.

374
00:22:19,123 --> 00:22:20,564
What are they motivated by?

375
00:22:20,824 --> 00:22:24,086
It could be money, love, fame, family, et cetera.

376
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,187
What keeps their engine turning?

377
00:22:26,227 --> 00:22:27,187
What makes them go?

378
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,969
And then this, I think, is almost the most important part

379
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:32,610
that no one talks about as much is how.

380
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:35,252
All of character depends on the how.

381
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:38,453
How do they go about getting their objective?

382
00:22:38,954 --> 00:22:41,395
And we really break this down into action verbs

383
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,477
and theater, which is you use these action

384
00:22:44,517 --> 00:22:46,178
verbs within lines.

385
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,541
I'm going to do an example, but you would have a line

386
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:51,982
and you would have this, you know, with this line,

387
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:53,783
I want to do this action verb, which

388
00:22:53,823 --> 00:22:55,904
is how I get my objective.

389
00:22:56,144 --> 00:22:59,025
So if the line was, I want the papers, please.

390
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:01,145
Let's try that with to entice.

391
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:03,766
I want the papers, please.

392
00:23:03,786 --> 00:23:06,327
So that was enticing, yeah.

393
00:23:06,747 --> 00:23:08,808
And then we're going to try to punch, OK.

394
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,069
I want the papers, please.

395
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:14,741
My face changed, your voice changed, audio changed,

396
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:15,802
everything changed, right?

397
00:23:15,842 --> 00:23:17,664
And so action verbs can be really helpful

398
00:23:17,684 --> 00:23:19,565
if you are small in scope on your team

399
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:21,547
and you need to direct action verbs.

400
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:22,908
That's a great way to already like,

401
00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:23,969
get you started on directing.

402
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:25,691
And then what's the subtext of a line?

403
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:27,092
You don't need to do this with every line.

404
00:23:27,412 --> 00:23:28,053
Again, like I'm saying,

405
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,534
everything here is just a suggestion,

406
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:31,996
things to help you out, more tools in your tool belt.

407
00:23:32,997 --> 00:23:34,698
But subtext of lines can be really important

408
00:23:34,738 --> 00:23:35,219
if it's a very...

409
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,642
intentional moment that a lot of hinges on that, maybe that that dialogue.

410
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:42,164
So what I say versus what I actually mean.

411
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:46,428
Another example, we have a you're doing a great job, honey, is the script.

412
00:23:46,588 --> 00:23:47,829
So I actually mean it.

413
00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:49,490
You're doing a great job, honey.

414
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:52,873
Oh, she's so happy. She loves honey. Sweet.

415
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,636
OK, then she does not think honey is doing a great job.

416
00:23:57,557 --> 00:23:58,998
You're doing a great job, honey.

417
00:24:00,043 --> 00:24:06,885
Completely different right we're using different resonators, it's all different so subtext is super super important and fun to work out.

418
00:24:07,605 --> 00:24:14,568
I should know the relationships between characters and why they are the way you are all my writers that they are saying, Oh my god my backstories work.

419
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:19,109
Yes. You typically would not give your backstory to an actor.

420
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:24,650
Um, because that would be like a lot of information to like process, but if you have a dramaturge,

421
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:29,091
that would be great. Or if the actor does have questions, right, and you do have that answer

422
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:32,832
in your backstory, that could be a good time to say, well, actually, now that you ask,

423
00:24:34,352 --> 00:24:39,733
so it could work out. And then why are they this way, this character this way? Where did they come

424
00:24:39,773 --> 00:24:45,195
from right before the scene started and where are they going? This is so helpful when you're acting

425
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:47,656
Acting is fantasy, right?

426
00:24:47,716 --> 00:24:49,278
And so this grounds you.

427
00:24:49,358 --> 00:24:51,880
It lets you know, what are the logistics of my reality?

428
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:54,303
And so knowing again, where, when

429
00:24:54,803 --> 00:24:57,366
is super important for performers.

430
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:59,348
So examples of performance practices

431
00:24:59,388 --> 00:25:00,969
for some of your game teams you have,

432
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,451
can you hold a read through?

433
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:03,602
for your script, right?

434
00:25:03,622 --> 00:25:05,443
Where you're gonna read through the script,

435
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,385
but I'm tush, wonder why they named it that.

436
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:09,327
But there you can do table work.

437
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,490
And even if you don't have professional actors,

438
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,173
please, please, please read it out loud.

439
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:19,816
I cannot emphasize enough how I think writers are like,

440
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:22,299
wow, I didn't realize it sounded like that

441
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,500
until you said it.

442
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,742
And so having someone else read your words

443
00:25:25,802 --> 00:25:26,743
as they are on the page.

444
00:25:27,143 --> 00:25:30,884
is going to be so helpful because you can listen and take notes of what feels good

445
00:25:31,205 --> 00:25:35,747
and what's like a little awkward or more like oh that needs to go or like oh that could stay

446
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:40,388
and so having that is just going to make your process so much easier and again does not have

447
00:25:40,408 --> 00:25:45,130
to be professional actors can be your friends can be your parents can be whoever would like to read

448
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:50,773
for you and then can you record your talent together if you have voiceover actors please

449
00:25:50,813 --> 00:25:55,015
do this this is so cool um it's helpful for performances and it's really

450
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:59,444
bonding. And you can see the ensemble building relationships, their performances are more

451
00:25:59,504 --> 00:26:04,986
nuanced because they're listening to each other. And it's really hard, right, when we're remote,

452
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:09,809
Zoom, but I just did this this past fall where I directed two voice actors in their own booths

453
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:14,111
and they were listening to each other and we got great performances that were super

454
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:17,873
intertwined because they just, you know, they could listen to each other

455
00:26:17,893 --> 00:26:21,415
IRL instead of, you know, being in a solitary booth by themselves.

456
00:26:22,195 --> 00:26:24,217
So if you can do this, I know it's hard with scheduling.

457
00:26:24,337 --> 00:26:25,478
I really would recommend it.

458
00:26:26,058 --> 00:26:28,079
So there are some comparables within the space professionally

459
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,481
that I had to mention, right?

460
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:33,183
This, you know, different, like literally same duties,

461
00:26:33,223 --> 00:26:36,125
different medium of, you know, roles within the industry

462
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:37,627
that I just think are so similar

463
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:39,548
or similar duties and different name

464
00:26:39,928 --> 00:26:41,409
of folks who are maybe a little different,

465
00:26:41,449 --> 00:26:43,091
but we kind of do the same function, right?

466
00:26:44,032 --> 00:26:48,837
I think when we recruit from different spaces, we're going to get diversity of experiences, backgrounds, and different sorts of folks.

467
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:54,344
I was super lucky that my program at USC, I didn't really have a lot of game dev background, right?

468
00:26:54,424 --> 00:26:59,250
I did a lot of marketing and social media, but I didn't have a lot of dev experience.

469
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,774
I had a lot of theater experience, and I feel really lucky.

470
00:27:03,114 --> 00:27:07,396
for that opportunity to be in the space. And I think I would love to see more folks, right,

471
00:27:08,236 --> 00:27:12,238
from theater if they're interested, right, and bring them in. And diversity only makes the games

472
00:27:12,318 --> 00:27:16,700
industry better by having more folks of different intersectionality backgrounds and able to, you

473
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:22,603
know, give us more feedback and different, like, perspectives on what we need. And so a designer,

474
00:27:22,623 --> 00:27:29,326
a designer should always, you know, have many knowledge, their fingers in many knowledge pools,

475
00:27:29,526 --> 00:27:31,146
right, because it's only going to make you stronger.

476
00:27:32,404 --> 00:27:35,947
And so that was a lot of talking.

477
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,948
So we're gonna bring it to our conclusion, right?

478
00:27:38,668 --> 00:27:41,530
Is it solves my question when I was at that E3 hangout

479
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:45,373
is why are there so many theater people in this industry?

480
00:27:45,954 --> 00:27:47,855
Is this like the natural path for all of this?

481
00:27:47,955 --> 00:27:49,296
And I see all of you in the chat,

482
00:27:49,356 --> 00:27:51,357
like, wow, there really is something here.

483
00:27:51,477 --> 00:27:55,040
And I think it is that we literally have very similar roles

484
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,121
or literally the same positions and practices.

485
00:27:57,482 --> 00:27:58,502
And it is a path, right?

486
00:27:58,522 --> 00:28:00,564
That we should see as reasonable as computer tech.

487
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:03,348
or computer science or tech.

488
00:28:03,888 --> 00:28:05,971
And like I said, it would be just really cool

489
00:28:06,012 --> 00:28:07,674
to see read throughs at different places

490
00:28:07,714 --> 00:28:09,957
and just more carrying over at these practices

491
00:28:09,977 --> 00:28:11,800
because they're only gonna make us stronger, right?

492
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:13,443
So in conclusion, thematically,

493
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:16,487
there is a reason theater kids flock to game dev.

494
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:21,774
It feels like home. Games are my favorite medium. I think they're the most evolved art form possible.

495
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:26,860
They're more accessible to more people. Theater is not... We love theater, obviously, if we're in this talk,

496
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,606
but it's not super accessible, and games have the ability, like TV did back in the 1950s,

497
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:35,631
to go into people's living rooms and be there in their heart, in their home.

498
00:28:36,111 --> 00:28:39,553
and we can make these games that make people empathize with each other more

499
00:28:39,573 --> 00:28:43,115
because that identification process, right, with characters is never stronger

500
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,757
than it is in games or theater. And we can make the world, why I'm in games,

501
00:28:46,837 --> 00:28:50,579
to make the world a better place, right? And so practically, I hope all of you in

502
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:55,622
the audience can maybe take some of these practices and bring them back to your studios,

503
00:28:56,323 --> 00:29:02,126
your teams, and make your game stories richer, stronger, and more impactful. So I do have some

504
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:07,108
future resources and citations if you're interested if you were like we need to read more on this.

505
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:15,071
There you go. There's a lot of these that I think would be really helpful. I have to give a thank you to Professor Melinda Finberg of critical drama studies.

506
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:19,613
Hannah Nicklin PhD and Professor Richard Lemartian of game design at USC.

507
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:24,497
for his game design outline that we used earlier. Also a shout out to the mentors

508
00:29:25,438 --> 00:29:29,601
who helped me with this and the summit advisors of the Narrative Game Summit for making my first,

509
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:35,246
this is my first GDC talk. Thank you for selecting me and allowing me to talk about this

510
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:42,993
and help others. So that is it. I have my website here, my email, and my social media. We will not

511
00:29:43,053 --> 00:29:44,174
have time, unfortunately.

512
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:49,098
for questions, but if you do have questions, please feel free to DM me, um, mostly on Twitter

513
00:29:49,418 --> 00:29:54,161
would be good, but if you would like to stay in contact, please, here I am. I am looking for full-time

514
00:29:54,201 --> 00:30:01,727
roles, uh, with production, uh, directing or working with actors after graduation, uh, for in, in May from

515
00:30:01,807 --> 00:30:06,630
USC, but I want to thank you all so much, and I hope you have a great rest of your GDC. Bye!
