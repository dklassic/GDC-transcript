00:00:00,878 --> 00:00:04,060
Augmented reality is a medium unlike anything that's come before.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,582
And over the next couple of years, it's set to explode, especially with several companies

3
00:00:08,622 --> 00:00:11,343
racing to be the first to make the AR cloud a reality.

4
00:00:12,044 --> 00:00:13,004
But it's still a green field.

5
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:18,227
Whether it's gameplay, storytelling, or UX, the rules haven't been written yet, which

6
00:00:18,267 --> 00:00:20,267
means it's up to us to write the playbook.

7
00:00:21,508 --> 00:00:26,150
I'd like to share my experiences developing and thinking about AR gaming with the Microsoft

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:26,610
HoloLens.

9
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:29,152
I'll cover gameplay, UX, and more.

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:41,984
I'd also like to give you a sneak peek of what I think the future of AR gaming is going to look like.

11
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:03,131
I'll see you in the future.
