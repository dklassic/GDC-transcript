00:00:03,226 --> 00:00:06,010
You

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:12,678
Hello

3
00:00:16,974 --> 00:00:21,298
All right, so the story behind this talk is that ever since the EA spouse letter, I've

4
00:00:21,298 --> 00:00:24,881
asked everyone I could think of, like, when they're talking about crunch, like, is there

5
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:28,984
actual, any actual scientific research showing the effects of crunch?

6
00:00:28,984 --> 00:00:33,988
Some people glorify it, some say it's unfortunate but necessary, some say it's terrible and

7
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:38,592
detrimental, but when I ask anyone in any category, okay, is there any peer-reviewed

8
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:40,394
research on this, it's crickets.

9
00:00:41,114 --> 00:00:46,260
Or someone swears, I saw a study once, but when I ask them for a citation, suddenly they can't find it.

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,523
So I went ahead and did the research myself, so you don't have to.

11
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:54,408
These slides will have numbers in them. I will give a bibliography at the end,

12
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:56,109
and a link to the slides so you can check them out,

13
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:59,413
because I think we can do better at this point than just gut feelings.

14
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:04,217
So, just to lay down some boundaries, what are we talking about when we say crunch?

15
00:01:04,217 --> 00:01:06,740
This doesn't have an industry standard definition.

16
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,887
For this talk, when I say crunch, really I'm using it as a synonym for any amount of unpaid

17
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:16,392
overtime past eight hours a day or 40 hours a week.

18
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:19,075
Now this can be short, it can be long.

19
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:21,080
It can be light, it can be brutal.

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,981
I'm talking about all of these.

21
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:26,785
We do usually talk about this in the context of salaried employees where extra hours are

22
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:27,586
not compensated.

23
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:33,712
That's significant because there are federal laws requiring at least time and a half compensation

24
00:01:33,712 --> 00:01:37,476
for overtime, specifically to make it more cost effective that if you're going to make

25
00:01:37,476 --> 00:01:38,677
a habit of this.

26
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:40,938
You're going to have to pay for it.

27
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:45,299
It's more cost effective to just hire more workers and work them less hours.

28
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,801
But salaried workers are exempt from those laws, so on the surface it means that a company

29
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:53,562
appears to just get more work out of other people for free.

30
00:01:53,562 --> 00:01:57,283
There are some edge cases to that, but they generally don't apply to the game industry.

31
00:01:57,523 --> 00:02:01,385
The other term that I'll use in this talk is death march,

32
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:03,945
which is just our colloquial term for a situation

33
00:02:03,945 --> 00:02:05,606
where a team is behind schedule,

34
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:07,286
they're asked to work longer hours to catch up,

35
00:02:07,286 --> 00:02:09,267
that makes them even further behind,

36
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:11,547
they work even longer hours with crunch getting worse

37
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:13,628
and worse over time and the project getting further

38
00:02:13,628 --> 00:02:16,669
and further behind until the entire project just fails,

39
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,309
causing high degrees of burnout and other problems.

40
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:21,570
So that's kind of like one extreme end of the scale,

41
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,350
but we'll be looking at the entire range.

42
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:29,089
So one thing that I did not include in my definition is calling crunch mandatory unpaid overtime.

43
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:30,710
That is usually how it's used.

44
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,292
But this has actually been studied.

45
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:37,255
And whether overtime was strictly voluntary with a worker putting in more hours

46
00:02:37,255 --> 00:02:41,778
because they just wanted to and were passionate versus it being required by management.

47
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:47,141
The issues arising from crunch that we'll be discussing here actually are the same either way,

48
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:51,443
with one small exception I'll get to at the end of the talk. So if you work long hours,

49
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:56,627
you will have certain fatigue effects, period, regardless of the situation that put you there.

50
00:02:58,384 --> 00:03:02,545
So, I'll start with a study that was measuring cognitive function, not productivity, but

51
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:06,486
just basic simple tests like the ability to memorize and repeat a word list or do simple

52
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,167
math, that kind of thing.

53
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:13,128
And it turns out that your ability to process things mentally is not actually constant throughout

54
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:13,549
a work week.

55
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:17,670
It starts off low, gets better in the first part of the week as you get into the swing

56
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,051
of things, and then decays until you get a break.

57
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:26,065
For working hours up to about 25 a week,

58
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:28,608
an increase in working hours has a positive impact

59
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,429
on cognitive function.

60
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:32,472
You get into the swing of things, you get into a rhythm.

61
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:34,855
After that, cognition slowly declines.

62
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:37,498
And this study actually looked at gender differences

63
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:38,119
and found none.

64
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:40,001
So this is basically the same curve for everyone.

65
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:44,773
Once you get past 60 hours, your cognitive function is actually worse than someone who

66
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:45,714
wasn't working at all.

67
00:03:45,714 --> 00:03:52,101
So there is actually scientific evidence that Mondays suck, but if you talk about Wednesday

68
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:54,443
being hump day, that's actually not supported by science.

69
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,705
You peak early Thursday.

70
00:03:55,705 --> 00:04:00,389
We knew that already since Wednesday, since most people actually do it on the weekends.

71
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:06,416
So this was actually consistent with a number of other studies that didn't look hour to hour,

72
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:10,118
but did confirm that longer hours do show performance degradation

73
00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:12,200
when averaged out over the entire week per hour.

74
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,622
I'd also like to draw your attention to the bottom study here.

75
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:20,085
There is a difference in effects of crunch depending on the type of work done.

76
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:25,609
Knowledge work and creative work are actually hit harder than things like repetitive tasks.

77
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,894
While I would love to give you a spreadsheet with just a bunch of numbers to optimize to

78
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:35,019
say here's exactly what's going to happen at hour number 48, there's just too much variability

79
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:39,264
between people, between different kinds of tasks, and many, many other variables.

80
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:43,850
So as much as I would love to spreadsheet this out, it's not actually possible.

81
00:04:44,908 --> 00:04:50,230
So now let's talk week to week. So suppose you just work a 40-hour workweek, no overtime at all,

82
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,492
and we just track your weekly performance instead of hourly. Yes, you'll have some good weeks,

83
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:59,254
you'll have some bad weeks. Going too many weeks without time off can degrade performance.

84
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:03,016
You do get more experienced and skilled over time, so your performance will increase like

85
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:08,479
year to year, but over the course of, say, a few months, we can treat this as sort of constant.

86
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,359
And under crunch...

87
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:14,682
conditions, there is a degradation of productivity over time that continues to

88
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:18,424
go down the longer that crunch happens. Now there isn't a single study that

89
00:05:18,424 --> 00:05:22,827
measures this overall because there's just too many variables, but there are

90
00:05:22,827 --> 00:05:26,689
lots of studies that show this in different narrow contexts and they all

91
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:30,231
tell the same story. So this is a repeated pattern across a number of

92
00:05:30,231 --> 00:05:35,695
fields, countries, and studies that comes through consistently.

93
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:38,760
This is an example of what an actual productivity curve...

94
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,442
Oh, I also... I drew this as like a straight line down.

95
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:44,824
It's not necessarily...

96
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:47,186
It's not necessarily in a linear shape.

97
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:49,687
So this is an example of an actual productivity curve.

98
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:53,089
This is not from game development, but it is from real data

99
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:56,512
collected over ten years from a processing and manufacturing plant,

100
00:05:56,512 --> 00:06:01,555
calculating productivity as the time it takes to do short-term tasks during crunch

101
00:06:01,555 --> 00:06:04,797
compared to how long it takes those under normal baseline conditions.

102
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:10,240
So you can see you do get a big fall off early on, then it goes a little bit back up as people

103
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,102
go into the swing of things, then it drops a bit more.

104
00:06:14,102 --> 00:06:18,045
That's in a non-game dev context, but it's an example of what a curve might look like.

105
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,046
So it's not linear.

106
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,627
And yes, this can actually go negative.

107
00:06:22,627 --> 00:06:25,229
And the reason is because the more fatigued someone is...

108
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:29,192
the more likely they are to make catastrophic errors.

109
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:31,573
So what zero productivity looks like is

110
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:33,555
you spend three hours fixing a simple bug

111
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:35,576
and you create another bug in the process.

112
00:06:35,576 --> 00:06:37,377
That's zero productivity.

113
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:39,779
Negative productivity is you're tired,

114
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:42,001
you see a deprecated file in the Git repository

115
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,542
and you go to remove it to clean things up

116
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:46,724
and by accident you actually delete the entire Git repo.

117
00:06:47,164 --> 00:06:50,726
and cost the entire company like a person month's worth of work

118
00:06:50,726 --> 00:06:53,387
because a bunch of people have just lost their most recent check-ins

119
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:55,588
and everything had to be restored from last night's backup.

120
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:58,049
That's what negative productivity looks like.

121
00:06:58,049 --> 00:07:00,030
And this is what happens during a death march.

122
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,752
The project is behind schedule, people work longer hours,

123
00:07:02,752 --> 00:07:04,132
but if it happens for too long,

124
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,534
this can actually put the team further behind if you're unlucky

125
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:12,076
because someone just happens to make a really big blunder

126
00:07:12,076 --> 00:07:14,117
because of the fatigue effects.

127
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:20,619
And if that happens too many times, then the entire project just ends up collapsing under its own weight.

128
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:29,881
There's also some amount of recovery time that it takes you to get back to your original baseline productivity after crunch. We talk about comp time.

129
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:35,122
Again, this isn't necessarily linear either. I'm just drawing it here to show that there is some recovery period.

130
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:41,628
So, you can see very clearly here that a short-term crunch followed by a recovery period is actually

131
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:46,813
a net productivity loss compared to just working continual 40-hour weeks.

132
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:50,877
Short-term, sometimes you need this to hit a milestone at the end of this week.

133
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:52,198
With the understanding that

134
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:58,883
Long-term is a little bit less efficient, but sometimes you need to squeeze a little bit more hours into a little bit less time in the short term.

135
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:00,424
That can be fine.

136
00:08:00,424 --> 00:08:06,908
Long-term, there is really no science I could find showing any productivity benefits of doing extended crunches.

137
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:12,972
In fact, just the opposite. It's less efficient. You get less done than just working 40 straight.

138
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:17,355
So there's really no justification for crunch beyond like a month or so.

139
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:21,498
Now, it seems intuitive to say, well, if people work longer hours, you get more out of them.

140
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:26,348
But that's just not supported by reality because humans aren't machines.

141
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:29,736
We don't have a constant output per hour.

142
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:30,498
We get tired.

143
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:40,060
So it gets worse when you're looking not just at productivity, but the actual effects on

144
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,882
human physiology.

145
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:48,025
So this is from a pretty big study of over 10,000 Americans over 13 years.

146
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:51,427
They got about 90,000 person years worth of on-the-job data.

147
00:08:51,987 --> 00:08:57,989
which let the study authors control for age, gender, occupation, industry, and religion.

148
00:08:57,989 --> 00:09:02,150
And within that, we're able to show a very clear linear relationship

149
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,571
between hours worked above 8 a day or 40 a week

150
00:09:05,571 --> 00:09:07,812
with greater incidence of injury or illness.

151
00:09:08,872 --> 00:09:13,334
So yes, you don't typically deal with workplace injury in game development beyond a paper cut,

152
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:17,516
but this does include things like heart attack, stroke, stomach ulcer,

153
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:21,758
and other medical conditions that can either kill you or at least take you out of the game for a while.

154
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:24,400
And this is consistent with two other studies

155
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,482
shown here that showed a link between overtime hours and heart disease, stroke, and injury hazard rate.

156
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:36,634
Another study here looked at a survey of almost 4,000 Canadians and asked them lifestyle questions

157
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:40,417
and also whether they were consistently working short, normal, or long hours

158
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:44,080
and basically found that you've got increased chances of mental health issues,

159
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,962
decreasing healthy habits like eating well and exercise,

160
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,884
and increasing unhealthy habits like...

161
00:09:49,324 --> 00:09:52,868
or starting unhealthy habits like smoking, drinking, or illicit drug use

162
00:09:52,868 --> 00:09:54,669
if you are consistently working longer hours.

163
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:57,132
You're just more likely to have those problems

164
00:09:57,132 --> 00:09:59,314
if you're consistently working long hours.

165
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:01,336
And this is also backed up by three other studies

166
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:05,960
that show increased incidence of anxiety and depression disorders,

167
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,204
as well as increased anger and hostility at work on a mood scale,

168
00:10:10,204 --> 00:10:13,287
which then leads to greater incidence of interpersonal conflict on a team

169
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:15,008
and resulting lower team morale.

170
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:22,760
Now, there is an actual mechanism for why overtime hours affect mental and physical health,

171
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,782
and that mechanism is an increase in stress.

172
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:31,386
There is scientific evidence that long working hours is related to stress.

173
00:10:31,386 --> 00:10:34,248
And that's not surprising that long hours are stressful.

174
00:10:34,248 --> 00:10:37,570
It's not surprising that chronic stress is known to cause all kinds of health problems.

175
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:42,297
I do want to be clear when I say stress here. I'm not for the purpose of these studies

176
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:47,825
I'm not just talking about like self-reporting or observational stress. I'm talking about

177
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:52,452
biological stress there are numerous biomarkers for chronic stress and

178
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:59,195
in blood studies, including it changes your levels of cortisol, catecholamines, glucose,

179
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:04,498
HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, prolactin, oxytocin, and a whole bunch of other things.

180
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:09,841
So when I say chronic stress here, I'm actually talking about alterations in your blood chemistry.

181
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:17,787
And there's a vast body of literature that links those biomarkers with a number of physical illnesses, mental illnesses, and cognition deficits.

182
00:11:17,787 --> 00:11:23,532
I could give an entire separate presentation just showing biochemical pathways that get you from stress to poor outcomes.

183
00:11:23,532 --> 00:11:29,477
So this, when I say stress, I'm not saying this in a way of, well, weak humans fold under crunch, higher people who are tough.

184
00:11:29,477 --> 00:11:35,563
This is a physiological response to stress that you cannot get around with just, you know, toughness and bootstraps.

185
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:41,103
Now, some people might be thinking, well, okay, these are just the sacrifices, these

186
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:44,044
are unfortunate, but they're the sacrifices we have to make in order to make good games.

187
00:11:44,044 --> 00:11:47,967
I think we all know that game development is a bit more messy than that.

188
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:52,609
You can't draw a clear line between a single variable like crunch and the outcome.

189
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:57,012
But there was a study on Gamma Sutra, back before it was game developer, specifically

190
00:11:57,012 --> 00:12:01,014
relating people's self-reports of whether they worked overtime or crunched on a project

191
00:12:01,014 --> 00:12:06,417
versus the project's Metacritic score on the left, their financial ROI in the center.

192
00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:09,038
and an aggregate score that the study authors calculated

193
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:11,119
from a combination of factors on the right.

194
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:13,641
And as you can see, the data is all over the place.

195
00:12:13,641 --> 00:12:16,242
Each dot on these graphs is the game's score

196
00:12:16,242 --> 00:12:18,083
versus how much crunch there was.

197
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,064
Some games did a lot of crunch, did really well.

198
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:21,084
Others did poorly.

199
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:23,465
Same for games with no crunch.

200
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:25,866
But spread across a large number of games,

201
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:27,287
spanning the range from AAA to small indie,

202
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:30,609
there is a very mild negative correlation

203
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:34,571
between working overtime and making a successful game.

204
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:34,651
Yeah.

205
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:39,647
And if you thought that was the worst of it, it actually gets even worse because if you're

206
00:12:39,647 --> 00:12:43,349
working at really long hours, these hours have to come from somewhere and the chances

207
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:47,272
are pretty good they're going to come from your sleep.

208
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:52,696
And so there is a there was a key study I found which showed that people who work more

209
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:57,559
than 55 hours a week compared to those who work 35 to 40 are twice as likely to experience

210
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:01,522
shortened sleep hours, almost four times as likely to find it difficult to fall asleep

211
00:13:01,522 --> 00:13:05,044
in the first place and twice as likely to wake up without feeling refreshed.

212
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,645
and repeated exposure to long work hours

213
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:08,925
greatly increased those odds.

214
00:13:08,925 --> 00:13:12,127
So that's where it starts and it gets worse from there.

215
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:14,227
So there is actually a strong correlation

216
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,648
between overtime and sleep deprivation.

217
00:13:16,648 --> 00:13:17,808
So let's talk about sleep.

218
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:21,250
Most humans need somewhere around eight hours of sleep

219
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,650
per night to function optimally.

220
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,751
There's some variation here, we follow along a bell curve.

221
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,052
But if anyone here is thinking that,

222
00:13:27,052 --> 00:13:28,292
you know, well I can function just fine

223
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:30,473
on six hours of sleep, I'm one of the lucky ones

224
00:13:30,473 --> 00:13:32,254
at the lower end of the bell curve,

225
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:33,335
odds are actually extremely high

226
00:13:33,335 --> 00:13:35,155
that you're fooling yourself and you really can't.

227
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:38,197
And honestly, none of us is in a position

228
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:40,898
to actually know how much sleep is optimal for us

229
00:13:40,898 --> 00:13:42,578
unless you've had this measured in a lab

230
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:43,579
in an actual sleep study,

231
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:45,320
because as we're about to see,

232
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,660
your self-perception about this

233
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,801
is not great under normal conditions,

234
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:51,142
and it gets even worse with sleep deprivation.

235
00:13:52,162 --> 00:13:57,564
So going without sleep, it turns out, physiologically, is almost indistinguishable from drinking alcohol,

236
00:13:57,564 --> 00:13:59,645
other than the effect on a breathalyzer test.

237
00:13:59,645 --> 00:14:02,785
This is literally what sleep loss does.

238
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:06,747
It reduces motor function, reaction times, ability to think, judgment,

239
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:10,008
all the things that getting drunk make you do.

240
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:17,030
So, there's actually studies that show exactly how much sleep deprivation versus how many

241
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,492
shots of alcohol it takes.

242
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:24,115
So the next time you hear someone talk about pulling an all-nighter or staying up late

243
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:28,638
working on a project, just mentally translate that to drinking alcohol, right?

244
00:14:28,638 --> 00:14:32,541
You'd say, if someone said, oh, that Ian, he came in and rebalanced our entire game

245
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,982
economy overnight last night.

246
00:14:33,982 --> 00:14:34,543
He's such a hero.

247
00:14:34,543 --> 00:14:36,204
He does those all-nighters a lot.

248
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:38,265
Just mentally translate that to,

249
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:40,186
oh that Ian, last night he got totally drunk,

250
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:41,666
then he balanced our game economy.

251
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,467
He's a hero, he does that a lot.

252
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,587
Right?

253
00:14:44,587 --> 00:14:47,008
That sounds crazy when I say it like that,

254
00:14:47,008 --> 00:14:48,469
but if you say stayed up all night,

255
00:14:48,469 --> 00:14:50,970
that is really literally what is happening here.

256
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,250
And kind of like being drunk, right, if you've ever been in a bar and seen someone who's

257
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,711
like falling off their stool and saying, I'm fine, give me the keys to drive, right?

258
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:04,612
And everyone else is like, dude, you're not fooling anyone, right?

259
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:09,453
Like being drunk, you always think you're less drunk than you actually are.

260
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:10,553
And being tired is like that too, right?

261
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:15,434
One of the first things to go when you start getting tired or drunk is your ability to

262
00:15:15,434 --> 00:15:16,294
self assess.

263
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:19,416
how tired or drunk you are.

264
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,978
So however tired you ever think you are,

265
00:15:21,978 --> 00:15:23,299
it's probably worse.

266
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:25,460
It turns out this is actually what the second wind is,

267
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,821
if any of you have experienced that,

268
00:15:26,821 --> 00:15:28,482
where you're like late up at night,

269
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:29,783
and maybe two or three in the morning,

270
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:31,784
you suddenly reach this point

271
00:15:31,784 --> 00:15:33,966
where you get this sudden rush of energy, right?

272
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,588
That's actually the point where the part of your brain

273
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:38,649
that detects how tired you are

274
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:40,430
is too tired to function and has shut off.

275
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:43,429
It doesn't feel that way.

276
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:47,631
To be sure, you would need to measure this in a lab with cognition tests.

277
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:51,793
But if you do that, what you find is that the second wind is pure perception.

278
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:58,036
Your actual abilities follow a progressive, smooth slide downward.

279
00:15:58,036 --> 00:16:02,057
And the point at which you say, I'm having my second wind, does not show up on that graph

280
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:02,458
at all.

281
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:06,223
Also, this surprised me when I found this,

282
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:09,545
if you pull an all-nighter and then take a full day of rest,

283
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:11,726
you are still not back to baseline.

284
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:14,707
So this can be extremely dangerous and inefficient.

285
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,729
This was from a study where experienced night shift workers

286
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:20,711
had mental performance measured at baseline

287
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:23,652
after a night shift, and again, after a full day of recovery,

288
00:16:23,652 --> 00:16:25,673
and found that even after a full night's sleep

289
00:16:25,673 --> 00:16:28,455
and a full day off, test subjects were not recovered

290
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,396
all the way back to their baseline levels.

291
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:34,636
Now I know what you're thinking, ooh, I know a cheat code for this.

292
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:39,807
In some ways, yes, caffeine does have effects that counteract the effects of being tired,

293
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:41,968
but there are a whole bunch of caveats and limitations.

294
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:46,670
And the most important one that most people are not aware of is that you reach caffeine

295
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,830
tolerance shockingly quickly.

296
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:54,052
It takes about a week, meaning that one week of regular caffeine use and that amount of

297
00:16:54,052 --> 00:16:57,053
caffeine use is no longer giving you any kind of stat bonuses at all.

298
00:16:57,053 --> 00:17:01,815
It's just bringing you back to the baseline you were prior to starting your use of caffeine.

299
00:17:01,815 --> 00:17:02,855
Sorry, coffee drinkers.

300
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:08,080
So, if you don't use caffeine normally and you need a boost for a short period of time

301
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,805
that is covered under caffeine, like one week or less, you can do this to make up for some

302
00:17:12,805 --> 00:17:17,110
of the adverse mental effects of short-term crunch, as long as you stop using it immediately

303
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,254
after that week and get back to a non-caffeine baseline.

304
00:17:20,254 --> 00:17:23,577
For anything longer than that, no, caffeine will actually not help you.

305
00:17:25,622 --> 00:17:29,125
So you might say, OK, Ian, is there any good news here?

306
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,587
Is there anything you can do to improve your performance at work?

307
00:17:31,587 --> 00:17:32,327
And yes.

308
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:36,770
If you want to optimize time, whether you're in Crunch or not,

309
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,612
short attention breaks, so a 10-second attention break,

310
00:17:39,612 --> 00:17:42,274
stretching every few minutes, taking a five-minute break

311
00:17:42,274 --> 00:17:45,197
to walk around every hour, that can refresh your attention

312
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,878
and keep you fresh throughout the day.

313
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:53,964
Also, taking at least 20 minutes when you take a meal to just eat in a relaxed and slow

314
00:17:53,964 --> 00:18:00,009
way actually improves the nutrition of the food and improves digestion and relaxation.

315
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:03,471
And on top of that, of course, any techniques you can use to reduce stress, because as we

316
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:07,455
heard, you know, the main bad effects of extended crunch are from...

317
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:09,116
from levels of stress.

318
00:18:09,116 --> 00:18:11,957
So stress reduction, of course, is a huge field.

319
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,899
That could be an entire talk of its own.

320
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:15,139
But if you have noticed, for example,

321
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:17,661
lots of companies offering things like yoga,

322
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:19,562
meditation, and mindfulness classes,

323
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:23,084
that actually does have a solid basis in science

324
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:25,806
for positive health outcomes due to stress reduction.

325
00:18:25,806 --> 00:18:28,568
It's just that it comes across as a bit disingenuous

326
00:18:28,568 --> 00:18:31,089
when the company offering stress reduction programs

327
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,711
is also the primary cause of your stress in the first place.

328
00:18:35,992 --> 00:18:39,614
Another thing that was found across multiple studies,

329
00:18:39,614 --> 00:18:41,855
and this is the exception that I was referring to

330
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:43,016
at the very beginning,

331
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:46,798
is that allowing people to choose their own work hours,

332
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:49,580
so allowing people flexible time over their schedules,

333
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,821
whether in crunch or not,

334
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:53,842
has basically nothing but positive effects

335
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,664
under normal baseline conditions or crunch conditions.

336
00:18:57,644 --> 00:18:59,105
So that is also something you can do,

337
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,926
is letting people set their own hours.

338
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:03,808
Helps with job satisfaction, health, well-being,

339
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:06,549
productivity, efficiency, just basically everything

340
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:07,269
across the board.

341
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:10,951
Now, another thing you may be wondering,

342
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,612
there may be an elephant in the room here

343
00:19:12,612 --> 00:19:14,533
that I want to address, which is,

344
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:15,814
you're saying like, well, Ian,

345
00:19:15,814 --> 00:19:18,195
you're co-founder of Global Game Jam.

346
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:20,096
Everyone knows that game jams take place

347
00:19:20,096 --> 00:19:21,257
over a sleepless weekend.

348
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:22,858
Are you the biggest hypocrite getting up here

349
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:24,218
and telling us about this?

350
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,401
So I will say, Game Jams in general, and Global Game Jam in particular, do have an image problem.

351
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,884
A lot of people think that these glorify and encourage crunch culture.

352
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:36,826
I have actually talked with Global Game Jam leadership about fixing this and having them

353
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:38,967
make some very public statements about crunch.

354
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:40,328
So far, that hasn't happened.

355
00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:44,211
I will keep pushing on it, but I do want to address this right now.

356
00:19:44,211 --> 00:19:49,454
So first off, as we've seen, the worst health and physiological and psychological effects

357
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:49,774
of crunch.

358
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,516
happen in the long term, not the short term.

359
00:19:52,516 --> 00:19:54,777
With game jams, this is time boxed.

360
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:58,139
You can short yourself on sleep over 48 hours,

361
00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:01,021
but that won't have nearly the same effects

362
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:04,263
of depression and illness and injury

363
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:06,225
that a longer crunch period would have.

364
00:20:06,225 --> 00:20:09,647
So a weekend jam just isn't a fair comparison

365
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:11,868
to the long term damage that a six month death march

366
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:12,529
would do.

367
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:14,550
But more importantly than that,

368
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,952
you don't have to crunch at game jams.

369
00:20:16,952 --> 00:20:19,533
Co-founder of Global Game Jam telling you.

370
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:21,376
you do not have to crunch at game jams.

371
00:20:21,376 --> 00:20:21,556
Right?

372
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:24,401
In fact, knowing what I've just shown you

373
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:26,524
about the effects of long hours and sleep deprivation,

374
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:29,890
I would say that if you treat a game jam as a short-term crunch,

375
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,432
you are doing it wrong.

376
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:36,690
You can work an 8-hour day in a game jam 2 days on a weekend

377
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,133
and probably make a better overall project than if you worked 2 16-hour days

378
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:43,995
and definitely better than if you pulled 2 adjacent all-nighters.

379
00:20:43,995 --> 00:20:49,098
If you want, you can do empirical research on yourself to prove this to yourself.

380
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:52,160
Game jams are actually a good way to do this relatively safely

381
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,381
because they are so time-compressed.

382
00:20:54,381 --> 00:20:57,223
Just schedule several game jams that are at least a month apart

383
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,424
to give yourself time to recover.

384
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:01,927
Time it so that you're going into each game jam equally fresh,

385
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,190
and then try one jam where you only work eight hours a day,

386
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,552
one where you work until you're subjectively tired,

387
00:21:06,552 --> 00:21:09,054
and one where you go with as little sleep as possible

388
00:21:09,054 --> 00:21:10,596
and push yourself to your limit,

389
00:21:10,596 --> 00:21:11,617
and then compare.

390
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:14,480
What's the quality of the work that you did on those games?

391
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,921
How much did you get done?

392
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:18,123
How did you feel during and after each jam?

393
00:21:18,564 --> 00:21:23,228
Just let your team know when you do this on a game jam with a team so they can scope accordingly.

394
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:25,871
And if you do that, that's not really glorifying crunch.

395
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:30,135
It's using game jams to learn more about yourself and the effect that crunch has on you

396
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:34,920
so that you can make better personal decisions when your actual job is on the line.

397
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:42,013
And I just want to address also every now and then you'll see a thread where people will post pictures of jammers asleep on the floor or at their desks.

398
00:21:42,013 --> 00:21:48,341
Just keep in mind that this floor is comfy. Tumblr isn't glorifying crunch. It's mocking it.

399
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,984
This is not aspirational. Don't treat it as such.

400
00:21:52,632 --> 00:21:58,178
So, if you take away nothing else from today, these are the points that I really want you

401
00:21:58,178 --> 00:21:58,939
to remember.

402
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:05,366
Know that your productivity per unit time decreases continually and linearly if you

403
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:10,391
work long hours or you're short on sleep and these effects stack with each other and get

404
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:12,534
worse until you catch up in the short term.

405
00:22:13,014 --> 00:22:16,416
If you do this long enough that you can no longer catch up in the short term,

406
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:20,579
the excess is taken off your lifespan with permanent health damage.

407
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:23,220
And if you're fatigued enough, you'll also be in the territory

408
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,361
where you can, sometimes if you're unlucky,

409
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:27,082
create more messes than you can clean up,

410
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:29,504
and you're actually a net liability to your team.

411
00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:34,088
If your entire team is under these conditions, you're in a death march.

412
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:38,853
And even if you're short on sleep for just a single day,

413
00:22:38,853 --> 00:22:41,536
remember that during the time when you are sleep-deprived,

414
00:22:41,536 --> 00:22:43,938
you are operating as if you are drunk.

415
00:22:43,938 --> 00:22:47,302
So avoid anything where you can kill someone with a mistake.

416
00:22:47,302 --> 00:22:48,603
Try not to drive.

417
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:51,246
For God's sake, stay off the critical path of your project.

418
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:55,276
And there are other things I didn't even get to cover here,

419
00:22:55,276 --> 00:22:56,577
because I just have a half hour.

420
00:22:56,577 --> 00:23:00,098
The effects of crunch on family life and relationship stress,

421
00:23:00,098 --> 00:23:01,999
decrease in job satisfaction, those

422
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:04,200
can lead to increased absenteeism and employee

423
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,061
turnover.

424
00:23:05,061 --> 00:23:06,641
And employees, if they turn over,

425
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:08,222
are quite expensive to replace.

426
00:23:08,843 --> 00:23:13,366
Burnout is also a factor. That doesn't just increase employee turnover, but also

427
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:18,490
costs the entire industry senior level experience that leaves. So there's

428
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,834
more research on that that I just didn't have time for. So the next time you see

429
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:26,216
this sign in Moscone West, your first thought should probably be, you know,

430
00:23:26,216 --> 00:23:29,539
which creative is wasting money at 10 p.m.? Probably whichever one is in the

431
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:30,220
office working.

432
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,434
So to leave you with some final thoughts, you might wonder, OK,

433
00:23:35,434 --> 00:23:38,897
well, how do we avoid crunch if we get behind schedule then?

434
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:40,638
It's all fine and good to say this is bad.

435
00:23:40,638 --> 00:23:41,398
What's the alternative?

436
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:44,260
Let's be clear that we don't usually

437
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,821
get behind schedule because the engineering team was lazy

438
00:23:46,821 --> 00:23:49,663
and playing games all day, or because the designers were

439
00:23:49,663 --> 00:23:52,585
unskilled and didn't know how to make the game right.

440
00:23:52,585 --> 00:23:55,266
Those things both happen a lot on student projects.

441
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:57,368
But in the industry, we tend to filter those people out

442
00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:58,428
when we're hiring.

443
00:23:58,428 --> 00:23:59,889
Professional developers actually tend

444
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:01,250
to be pretty good at what we do.

445
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:07,812
So, the cause of crunch is usually not a skill problem or a laziness problem.

446
00:24:07,812 --> 00:24:08,732
It's an unrealistic schedule.

447
00:24:08,732 --> 00:24:10,312
Expectations are too high.

448
00:24:10,312 --> 00:24:13,073
That's a project management fail.

449
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:17,634
And even if there is a technical skill problem where you do have, say, engineers that just

450
00:24:17,634 --> 00:24:22,195
aren't skilled enough to build the thing as fast as they should, that's still arguably

451
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:26,716
a project management fail because it's the project manager's job to know the capabilities

452
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:27,336
of their team.

453
00:24:27,336 --> 00:24:31,217
If you overestimate the team's skills, that's on the person who did the overestimation.

454
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:36,882
So, if you do find your project behind schedule with too much work and not enough time to

455
00:24:36,882 --> 00:24:41,746
do it, the solution is really not work harder or work longer hours, because you are just

456
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:44,768
as likely to cause damage to the project as to advance it.

457
00:24:44,768 --> 00:24:49,933
Yes, if you're very lucky and happen to avoid random catastrophic errors, you might get

458
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:52,475
a little more done, but the odds are against you.

459
00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:55,664
Right, the solution really here is to,

460
00:24:55,664 --> 00:24:57,705
in order to maximize your chances of success,

461
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:00,986
is to reassess how much you can realistically get done,

462
00:25:00,986 --> 00:25:02,667
and if you can't get done what's currently spec'd

463
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,188
in the time that you have,

464
00:25:04,188 --> 00:25:06,489
redo the spec so that it is possible to get done,

465
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:08,269
or knock back the release date

466
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:10,670
to give the team extra time to get more done,

467
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,591
or hire more people onto the team

468
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:13,532
with enough ramp-up time

469
00:25:13,532 --> 00:25:15,192
that there are net productivity gain.

470
00:25:15,192 --> 00:25:16,493
That one does have some delay.

471
00:25:18,282 --> 00:25:21,924
So yes, there are real citations for all of the sources here.

472
00:25:21,924 --> 00:25:25,967
These are on the comments slide and individual slide as well as the slide here.

473
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:29,809
If anyone wants to look these up for themselves or do more research on this topic, you can

474
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:31,330
get your slides here.

475
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,332
And with that, I will take questions.

476
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:34,933
We have mics here and here.

477
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:44,259
Hi there.

478
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:46,660
My name is Lauren.

479
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:52,790
I'm an art student at Academy of Art, but I'm also a college softball player.

480
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:59,773
And so you can imagine the amount of crunch I get put under having to wake up at like

481
00:25:59,773 --> 00:26:06,857
6 a.m. to do weights for, you know, an hour and then play softball for three hours.

482
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,358
So it definitely...

483
00:26:11,255 --> 00:26:12,878
The hours only come from sleep.

484
00:26:12,878 --> 00:26:14,761
I can definitely agree with that.

485
00:26:14,761 --> 00:26:20,771
I found it interesting when you talked about depression

486
00:26:20,771 --> 00:26:24,857
because I, in the last couple years, I've

487
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:33,634
realize my increase in depression and experiencing anxiety almost exclusively when I'm during,

488
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:39,635
like, when I'm in season. And so when I have, like, a lot of, uh, um, obligations,

489
00:26:39,635 --> 00:26:46,277
all of a sudden it just keeps piling on. Um, but with the increase of, uh, awareness for mental

490
00:26:46,277 --> 00:26:52,939
health, um, as we move forward into the future, I wanted to ask, how do you think the work week

491
00:26:52,939 --> 00:26:56,100
will change in the future, um, for the betterment of mental health?

492
00:26:56,862 --> 00:27:01,409
And what is your ideal work week?

493
00:27:01,409 --> 00:27:04,873
So ideal work week, like I said, you peak at 25 hours.

494
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,136
So you don't want to stop there.

495
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,960
You do still get more.

496
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,843
I think 40 hours.

497
00:27:13,712 --> 00:27:19,074
40 hours was ideal back in Henry Ford's time for people working on an auto assembly line

498
00:27:19,074 --> 00:27:27,117
doing road tasks. The ideal work, uh, work week length for knowledge tasks, um, I have

499
00:27:27,117 --> 00:27:33,239
not found yet, um, like specific, I did not cover specific things here with, um, with

500
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:37,721
relation to that. I'm guessing it's probably between 30 and 35. Now, whether we will get

501
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:41,542
there as an industry when we are very, very stubborn about these kinds of things,

502
00:27:42,283 --> 00:27:47,267
I'm not sure that I have that kind of confidence at scale.

503
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:51,090
But we actually have seen some recent things with that,

504
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,632
like some companies experimenting with four-day work weeks

505
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:56,194
and not a four by 10, like a four by eight,

506
00:27:56,194 --> 00:27:59,597
and reporting positive results from that.

507
00:27:59,597 --> 00:28:01,058
So I think like many things in the industry,

508
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:03,220
there are positive things we can do.

509
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,702
Some studios will do them, some of them won't.

510
00:28:05,702 --> 00:28:07,263
And I can only just hope that the...

511
00:28:08,624 --> 00:28:11,568
you know, that the companies that are doing things better

512
00:28:11,568 --> 00:28:14,232
will eventually, you know, over time make better games

513
00:28:14,232 --> 00:28:17,476
and just kind of displace the ones that aren't.

514
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:18,758
So, but we.

515
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,953
But, you know, game development is chaotic enough, occasionally a toxic studio,

516
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:27,496
you know, in any number of ways can still produce a hit game just,

517
00:28:27,496 --> 00:28:30,338
you know, by random chance, not necessarily because they,

518
00:28:30,338 --> 00:28:34,261
you know, because that's part of the process.

519
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:38,083
You know, and sometimes good studios will produce bombs, you know,

520
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:42,727
but hopefully over time, you know, the, you know, there's a die roll,

521
00:28:42,727 --> 00:28:44,128
there's a die roll modifier.

522
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:48,271
The ones that give positive die roll modifiers are overall going

523
00:28:48,271 --> 00:28:48,571
to be

524
00:28:49,037 --> 00:28:51,598
you know, more successful on average.

525
00:28:51,598 --> 00:28:54,120
And hopefully we can have that also with a shift

526
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,602
in the culture, you know, as more people understand that.

527
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:58,303
That was kind of my hope with this talk,

528
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,464
that it's just, you know, it gets us past

529
00:29:00,464 --> 00:29:02,366
just talking about anecdotes and feelings

530
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,408
and well, I think, and here's my, you know, experience,

531
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:09,010
and really talk about the science that we know

532
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,633
so that we can kind of have a more elevated conversation

533
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:13,333
about this topic.

534
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:13,774
So, thanks.

535
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:16,255
Might have time for one more.

536
00:29:17,293 --> 00:29:18,253
Yeah, I think.

537
00:29:18,253 --> 00:29:21,775
So that was a great question because it's in relation to mine.

538
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:23,215
This conversation about sleep, it's

539
00:29:23,215 --> 00:29:25,657
a very equitable conversation.

540
00:29:25,657 --> 00:29:26,857
So from a privileged perspective,

541
00:29:26,857 --> 00:29:29,798
I mean, there's folks that are working more, have more jobs,

542
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:31,059
and things like that.

543
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:33,780
So it's great to find from a scientific standpoint

544
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,001
the causes of some of these downfalls.

545
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:39,483
But moving forward, I'm curious what your solutions might

546
00:29:39,483 --> 00:29:41,364
be from a process perspective.

547
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,625
Like there's the Pomodoro technique and things

548
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:46,066
like that where you're taking breaks in between your.

549
00:29:46,806 --> 00:29:52,570
your work days. So I'm curious your thoughts on that and how we can use this information to

550
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,393
move forward with companies to recognize that not everybody has the same number of hours in a day.

551
00:29:56,393 --> 00:30:01,757
And while this information is very valuable, I think there's subsets of minorities that will

552
00:30:01,757 --> 00:30:07,781
struggle with implementing it. Yeah, as far as helping studios to do better with this, you know,

553
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:11,144
that's part of why I'm giving this talk, right? So that you'll have a resource to be able to bring

554
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:14,346
up and point to and say, look, here's what science actually says.

555
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:22,032
You know, and again, so that people, you know, so yes, I mean, if you're like a junior designer

556
00:30:22,032 --> 00:30:27,253
at a company, you have absolutely no institutional power, and you do not have a say over whether

557
00:30:27,253 --> 00:30:30,795
you crunch or not, and your producer says, all right, everyone's crunching, it's mandatory.

558
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:35,036
There's limited things you can do other than maybe like look for additional work.

559
00:30:35,036 --> 00:30:39,979
But I want to at least have it so that individuals in that situation at least understand this

560
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:44,941
is what's going to happen to your mind and body under these conditions if it goes for

561
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:46,241
long enough.

562
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:51,364
And so that you can make a more well-informed decision about do I stay, do I leave, do I

563
00:30:51,364 --> 00:30:51,984
push back.

564
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:55,307
Which parts of the rest of my life do I protect?

565
00:30:55,307 --> 00:30:58,611
I would definitely say if you are in crunch conditions,

566
00:30:58,611 --> 00:31:01,954
prioritize sleep as much as you can.

567
00:31:01,954 --> 00:31:04,076
Because if you do get short on sleep from that,

568
00:31:04,076 --> 00:31:06,458
that's just going to amplify all the other negative effects

569
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:09,461
and make you even more dangerous.

570
00:31:09,461 --> 00:31:12,725
So, and yes, like I said, there was a slide

571
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:15,227
where I did show some.

572
00:31:15,945 --> 00:31:19,067
small things that you can do during the day

573
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:20,127
to improve productivity.

574
00:31:20,127 --> 00:31:23,569
This is under crunch conditions or non-crunch conditions.

575
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:25,530
But obviously, there are limits, right?

576
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,092
The effects of an extended crunch will stack

577
00:31:28,092 --> 00:31:32,094
and overpower any positive things that you do,

578
00:31:32,094 --> 00:31:33,334
given enough time, right?

579
00:31:33,334 --> 00:31:35,476
So it's mostly about just optimizing.

580
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,976
And then of course, if there's anyone here

581
00:31:36,976 --> 00:31:40,438
who is a key decision maker, who does have a say over,

582
00:31:40,438 --> 00:31:42,740
do we crunch, do we not crunch, how much do we crunch?

583
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,020
that my hope is that you can use this as a better understanding to understand,

584
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:50,202
okay, here are the effects that are going to happen to individuals and to teams

585
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:54,663
under crunch conditions so that you can make more informed decisions about,

586
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:58,484
you know, when do we crunch, you know, in the short term because we have a milestone due next week

587
00:31:58,484 --> 00:32:03,905
and we're a little bit behind, you know, and I recognize that it's important to hit that milestone

588
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:08,066
if, because if we miss it then, you know, the entire project gets cancelled and our studio closes.

589
00:32:08,446 --> 00:32:09,989
All right, go ahead.

590
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:13,114
But just understand that you will want to give people comp time afterwards to get them

591
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:16,740
back to baseline, that it is inefficient to do that regularly.

592
00:32:18,484 --> 00:32:20,344
And as far as extended crunches go,

593
00:32:20,344 --> 00:32:21,785
that's where you should really be looking

594
00:32:21,785 --> 00:32:24,106
at your project timelines and your goals

595
00:32:24,106 --> 00:32:26,427
and your scope instead.

596
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:27,988
And for people who aren't in that position,

597
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,229
who maybe are junior or mid-level,

598
00:32:30,229 --> 00:32:32,370
if you stay in the industry for long enough

599
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,791
and get into positions of power where this is your call,

600
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:38,412
just remember this so that when you do have the ability

601
00:32:38,412 --> 00:32:40,913
to make those kinds of decisions on behalf of a team,

602
00:32:40,913 --> 00:32:45,255
that you're making decisions based on actual science.

603
00:32:46,293 --> 00:32:48,515
So, I think we are out of time there.

604
00:32:48,515 --> 00:32:49,596
Thank you again for coming.

605
00:32:49,596 --> 00:32:52,619
I will be still around and going to the speaker wrap-up area

606
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:53,681
wherever that is if anyone wants

607
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:55,402
to continue the conversation.

608
00:32:55,402 --> 00:32:57,064
Thank you so much for coming.
