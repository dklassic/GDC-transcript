1
00:00:04,782 --> 00:00:06,462
All right, I think we'll get started.

2
00:00:06,702 --> 00:00:09,403
These blinding lights, so, okay, yeah.

3
00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:15,185
Welcome to the next session in what I think is turning out to be a really fantastic day about e-sports.

4
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:20,227
And I think Frank and Pat deserve tremendous credit for curating today,

5
00:00:20,307 --> 00:00:24,888
because I don't know about you, but I think we're hearing from some of the most interesting folks so far

6
00:00:24,928 --> 00:00:27,669
who are doing really fantastic dynamic stuff.

7
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,250
And I think for me, so I've been studying e-sports for a while now,

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,031
and for me one of the most exciting things about what we've been hearing so far

9
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:39,195
is how much it's getting away from just kind of the mainstream hype conversations

10
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:41,977
and really digging into what's happening in the grassroots

11
00:00:42,057 --> 00:00:44,038
and how organizations are working through this stuff.

12
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:45,859
So I'm really excited about today.

13
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,782
So thanks to Frank and Pat for curating today.

14
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:50,943
My name is TL Taylor.

15
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:53,225
I'm a sociologist. I'm an academic.

16
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:54,546
I'm a professor at MIT.

17
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:55,466
I've written a few books,

18
00:00:56,407 --> 00:00:58,348
one of which was on eSports, came out in 2012.

19
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:00,630
It's a history book.

20
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,592
It was a history book the moment it came out.

21
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:06,449
in part because live streaming broke before I finished the manuscript.

22
00:01:07,339 --> 00:01:12,601
After I finish the manuscript, so I'm currently finishing a book on live streaming right now to kind of bring that conversation up to date.

23
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:16,222
You can find a lot of my work online.

24
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:18,822
I'm on Twitter, so there's some ways to follow me.

25
00:01:18,882 --> 00:01:25,724
And I also keep it for the more academic folks in the audience. I keep a literature page at my website on eSports literature.

26
00:01:25,764 --> 00:01:32,366
There's actually lots of academic research being done in that field. I maintain a page that links to lots of academic research.

27
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:33,506
So if you're interested in that.

28
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:39,233
So today I'm actually going to talk about the roots of esports in particular,

29
00:01:39,413 --> 00:01:42,337
and the powerful role communities have played in the scene,

30
00:01:42,797 --> 00:01:44,539
and the transformative work they do.

31
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:49,625
And I actually think it's a really important thread to filter up right now,

32
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:52,449
and I loved how it came up in some of the other conversations today.

33
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:57,873
because we are at such a huge commercialization push and hype

34
00:01:58,234 --> 00:02:01,537
that I think it's really important to think historically

35
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:05,420
and what are the lessons we can learn from those early moments of eSports.

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,542
I'm going to show you a variety of photos, a lot of them, most of them are from

37
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:17,451
I started doing research on eSports in 2003, way before the hype bubble, and sort of lived

38
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:22,276
through, you know, followed it through a kind of first crash, and now we're on this interesting

39
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,377
resurgence point.

40
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:28,822
So I want to start by just very briefly talking a little bit about the roots of eSports in

41
00:02:28,922 --> 00:02:31,044
hobbyist and enthusiast communities.

42
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:33,914
This is really where eSports comes from.

43
00:02:34,014 --> 00:02:38,079
For those of you who may be new to the scene, you know, you may be used to thinking of eSports

44
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:40,321
as like maybe League of Legends and live streaming.

45
00:02:40,922 --> 00:02:45,387
The roots are quite different and I think both Nick Allen this morning and Tom Cannon

46
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:46,788
when he was talking about the fighting game scene.

47
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:48,929
gave us glimpses of that right now.

48
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:50,110
Gave us glimpses of that.

49
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,071
Historically, communities have been where

50
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:54,872
titles get identified as

51
00:02:54,952 --> 00:02:57,133
competitive, and the scenes that are developed

52
00:02:57,173 --> 00:02:58,453
up around them, and

53
00:02:58,814 --> 00:03:00,794
those titles get worked over and through

54
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:02,635
by competitive communities, and I think

55
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:07,477
One of the lessons we can take from the early days of eSports history is really thinking

56
00:03:07,497 --> 00:03:11,019
about how play and competition is not a static thing.

57
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,080
Play evolves over time.

58
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,482
It often evolves in conversation with new hardware that comes out.

59
00:03:17,662 --> 00:03:23,664
So those of you who witnessed the transformation from LCDs to CRTs may remember how entire

60
00:03:23,684 --> 00:03:27,046
ways of playing in the competitive scene had to be tweaked to accommodate for that.

61
00:03:27,486 --> 00:03:31,914
So play is not a static thing and communities are the places where this gets worked over.

62
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:36,803
So the history of esports, you know, I trace it all the way back, of course, to the arcade period.

63
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:40,930
Probably some of you have seen King of Kong, so you may be familiar with some of that stuff.

64
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:46,623
But the other really important note when you think historically about communities are lands

65
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:52,085
and where people were dragging their machines together to play together and competition

66
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,765
emerged really naturally in those spaces.

67
00:03:55,186 --> 00:03:59,987
Of course, lands have also long been a place where eSports has been commercialized, but

68
00:04:00,027 --> 00:04:05,708
this kind of interesting mix of emergent community enthusiasm and excitement around competitive

69
00:04:05,748 --> 00:04:07,268
gaming has always been there.

70
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:09,207
So these are some older photos.

71
00:04:09,247 --> 00:04:13,269
This is the first eSports event I ever attended in 2003.

72
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,672
It was a Danish national final, but 30 people in the room

73
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:20,213
for a national final.

74
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:23,035
And again, super enthusiast community

75
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:25,857
that was really working hard to make that come together.

76
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:27,838
And I think one of the things that's so interesting

77
00:04:27,878 --> 00:04:29,759
about that early moment in eSports

78
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:32,841
is how you had people who were kind of always working

79
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:34,562
to professionalize the scene,

80
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:36,803
but within community frameworks.

81
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:42,652
And in fact, I think we're at a moment right now too where we're hearing a lot about collegiate

82
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:44,973
esports, which I am super excited about.

83
00:04:45,374 --> 00:04:48,356
Collegiate esports is another great example of a place where

84
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:54,567
Something like the Collegiate Star League actually formed because handfuls of students got together and said,

85
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:57,249
let's have matches where we're battling each other.

86
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:01,593
And so a whole scene and organization arose up around that.

87
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:06,257
And one of the things I think that's important about thinking about these hobbyist and enthusiast networks

88
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:08,919
is the role of the social in it.

89
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,003
It's not about individuals making independent decisions about competitive gaming.

90
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:17,340
But building play in conversation with each other and in competition with each other.

91
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,525
And I think, you know, one of the things that's interesting right now is I know I have over

92
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:26,550
the last few years certainly had, you know, random game developers come up and say like,

93
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,915
oh, why don't we turn X into a pro game or X into eSports.

94
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:31,595
And I'm like, well...

95
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:35,843
That's a good ambition, but do the communities want that title?

96
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:40,505
Communities are really good at sussing out whether or not a title is going to be good

97
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:42,886
for competitive play and in what ways.

98
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:49,909
So I think considering the work that folks on the ground are doing to make sense of high-end

99
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:51,890
play or competitive play is pretty important.

100
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,271
And in this regard, I don't know if any of you have been to DreamHack, but I think DreamHack

101
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:57,692
is a kind of great exemplar of

102
00:05:58,085 --> 00:06:02,095
The kind of passion that goes into communities to produce playful spaces.

103
00:06:02,476 --> 00:06:05,323
DreamHack is essentially mostly a volunteer organization.

104
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,810
If you've ever been to it, it's a massive LAN party.

105
00:06:08,137 --> 00:06:09,797
It's now also a huge eSports event.

106
00:06:10,117 --> 00:06:12,979
But you know, thousands of people come together, they drag their machines there,

107
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,700
hundreds of volunteers build up that space over the period of time.

108
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,643
And I think one of the things we can learn from some of these early roots of eSports

109
00:06:21,823 --> 00:06:24,644
is the power of something we often call serious leisure.

110
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:28,946
People who are willing to invest time and money and energy, they may not be pros.

111
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:31,526
But they're willing to invest a lot in this space.

112
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:37,028
And that folks who are engaged there are also always finding a way around barriers.

113
00:06:37,128 --> 00:06:44,750
I think very much of the early eSports scene as a kind of DIY hacking ethic that's important to consider.

114
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,011
I think one of the most interesting examples where we can see this...

115
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:57,922
Push to innovate practices, push to find new ways of organizing things, push to new forms

116
00:06:57,962 --> 00:07:01,623
of professionalization in esports has been in broadcasting.

117
00:07:01,703 --> 00:07:06,885
And so again, right now we're in a moment where we're seeing a lot of hype and excitement

118
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:10,446
about bringing esports to television or developing the live streaming scene.

119
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:14,888
But there are actually a number of ground breakers early on that were doing important

120
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:15,128
work.

121
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:18,870
in eSports broadcasting that I think we can learn a lot from.

122
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,252
We can learn a lot from the attempts that they've made along the way,

123
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:24,713
the kinds of practices they've been engaged in.

124
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:28,435
So this is a picture of Paul Chaloner, maybe some of you know him, red eye.

125
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:32,237
He's a long time eSports broadcaster. This is when I met him at DreamHack

126
00:07:32,797 --> 00:07:38,581
in 2006 and in 2006 at DreamHack this was the only media eSports thing

127
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:40,221
happening. Paul was set up.

128
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:43,316
with a laptop and was audio broadcasting.

129
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:48,579
And I think some of these early broadcasters were an interesting testament to people just

130
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,802
taking whatever tools were at hand and trying to make something more of it.

131
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:55,823
So at the time it was things like shoutcasting.

132
00:07:56,284 --> 00:08:01,207
Do we have audio? Can I broadcast over an audio feed something that's happening in the game?

133
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:07,009
And when you look at the kinds of work they were doing then, again, 2006, 2007,

134
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:13,453
dragging together machines, trying to figure out how do we create media production in this space.

135
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,754
And these were passionate, kind of committed folks.

136
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:21,498
They were not only creating jobs, but creating services that I think we're now building on and extending.

137
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:26,362
They were also coming up with ways to think about eSports that hadn't been thought of before.

138
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:30,566
So, how do you think about in-camera observing?

139
00:08:30,606 --> 00:08:33,588
What's the role of the in-game camera observer?

140
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,611
The role of commentating, building storylines.

141
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:41,435
All of this was innovative work that was coming up from the grassroots at the time.

142
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:49,207
Some of the most important early organizations founded around media, GotFrag, Team Sportscast

143
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:54,709
Network, and Radio ITG, I think were early foreshadowings of some of the media stuff

144
00:08:54,729 --> 00:08:55,569
we're seeing right now.

145
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:59,450
This is one of the favorite quotes I have from one of the people I interviewed for the

146
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,511
current book on live streaming, talking to them about kind of what it looked like on

147
00:09:04,571 --> 00:09:08,732
the grassroots, on the forefront, building a media space around eSports.

148
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:14,366
He said, I think in some regards this world is pushing technology or using tools

149
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:19,349
that traditional broadcasting uses in a very set way and jackknifing it

150
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:22,171
and doing stuff it was never meant to do.

151
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:27,254
Little things like the basic ATM switcher you can buy from Black Magic and a lot of churches

152
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:30,897
and other public service things have certain limitations, that's the way it is.

153
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:33,879
But if you're a nerd, you can get around those things.

154
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:36,260
You can make hacks and macros.

155
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:38,546
and things that they don't tell you about.

156
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:40,367
It's not an add-on you buy.

157
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:42,549
So there's nerds that build computers.

158
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:45,531
We have all these guys that are nerding out on capture cards.

159
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:49,033
And I think that hacking, DIY aesthetic,

160
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:51,936
that so informs the e-sports industry,

161
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:53,757
whether it's from the player side

162
00:09:53,857 --> 00:09:55,218
or the media production side,

163
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,920
is important to not get lost

164
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:00,502
as we start commercializing more as more.

165
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:05,618
Mainstream media companies are becoming interested as sports entities are becoming interested.

166
00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:13,605
How do we retain this DIY hacking mentality because it has been so transformational in

167
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:15,646
pushing eSports to where it is now.

168
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:19,750
We wouldn't have the media space in the same way if we didn't have these folks working

169
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,311
ten plus years ago.

170
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:27,514
The other thing that I think is really important to keep in mind if you're thinking about esports,

171
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:33,963
especially those of you on the development and design side, is thinking about the ways

172
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:39,271
esports is constructed in relation to communities and not just computation.

173
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,274
Computation is a really important component of eSports,

174
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:49,676
but humans and communities lend a very powerful,

175
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:55,258
have a very powerful role in constructing what the digital playing field is.

176
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,100
And I think one of the things that's hard for developers sometimes

177
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,762
is that they overly privilege designed systems.

178
00:11:03,422 --> 00:11:06,804
And sort of imagine that the game off the shelf

179
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:09,265
or the machine can take care.

180
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:11,830
a lot of the messy work.

181
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,553
So this is, and I love him, I don't think he's here, I love him dearly, Ernest Adams

182
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:20,276
and his colleague talking about video games do not require written rules, but the machine

183
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:22,978
implements and enforces them for the players.

184
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:25,720
The computer is the thing that sets the boundaries.

185
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,262
And as a sociologist, you may guess that my...

186
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:35,698
pitch after many years of studying competitive communities is this is not at all how it works.

187
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:40,460
And in fact, it was one of the funny things, the first work I did, my first book was on

188
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,501
MMOs and I saw a lot of this emergent and iterative behavior in the MMO space.

189
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:50,783
And when I started turning to esports, a couple people would say to me, you know, maybe though

190
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:55,124
the stakes are so high in esports, things will get formalized more in the machine.

191
00:11:55,644 --> 00:12:00,426
Maybe the computer, the system, will lock it down a little bit more because the stakes will be so high.

192
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:02,506
In fact, that wasn't the case at all.

193
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:06,488
And when you look at eSports communities, they are regularly

194
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:10,529
debating, tweaking, iterating the conditions of play

195
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:14,691
with an eye towards skill, virtuosity, and even aesthetics.

196
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:17,511
What counts as beautiful play sometimes matters.

197
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:20,833
So this means that if you actually sort of start looking at

198
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,333
competitive communities in practice,

199
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:29,421
What you see are lots of conversations over things like maps, characters that can be used

200
00:12:29,461 --> 00:12:35,206
or can't be used, cards that work well or don't, weapons, the number of rounds, configuration

201
00:12:35,246 --> 00:12:42,632
settings, mods, exploits, bug use, moves that are preferred or not preferred.

202
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:48,517
What kind of gets validated as legitimate, skillful, virtuosic play?

203
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,561
And that's stuff that, while the computer, while the design system,

204
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:56,344
certainly is a part of that conversation, it's really important to understand

205
00:12:56,664 --> 00:13:03,470
how communities are also extreme interrogators of competitive systems

206
00:13:03,891 --> 00:13:09,095
and will tweak and modify and work with them to make them something that they want them to be.

207
00:13:09,737 --> 00:13:14,879
And so I would say in my experience, spending a lot of time at esports events and watching

208
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,541
tournaments and competitions, you know, paying attention to the ways communities are doing

209
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:20,841
that work is really important.

210
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:25,823
Again, I think we're at an interesting moment where, you know, game developers used to...

211
00:13:26,987 --> 00:13:29,309
If they didn't shun eSports, they didn't care.

212
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,291
They didn't pay much attention.

213
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:36,577
And so communities were also, you know, were often pretty free to kind of iterate in ways

214
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:37,457
that made sense to them.

215
00:13:37,498 --> 00:13:41,542
And I think we're at an interesting junction right now where developers are getting more

216
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:42,703
interested in eSports.

217
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:47,908
The question for me is how do we not lose the value of the social work that the communities

218
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,770
do to make games playable.

219
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:55,883
And I would say this ties to a kind of meta point I want to make, a final meta point,

220
00:13:56,283 --> 00:14:00,890
which is that we really need to understand that play is a form of transformative work.

221
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:07,768
It's not simply that players, including professional players, including eSports players, take a

222
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:08,909
system as given.

223
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:14,694
In fact, transformation, if you think about it legally, means things like adding new expression

224
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:20,960
or meaning, or producing value by creating new information, new aesthetics, new insights

225
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,001
and understandings.

226
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:26,125
And what I want to argue to you is that games and eSports

227
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:27,670
are always doing that.

228
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:32,099
And I think that raises the bar both for designers and how they're thinking about what

229
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:36,929
they're building, but also for us culturally and what we understand eSports can be.

230
00:14:39,335 --> 00:14:46,778
It's not just rules that players are debating, but they're also making decisions all the time about preferred modes of play,

231
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:50,620
what's aesthetically pleasing. I remember once a long time ago

232
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:57,702
talking to Counter-Strike players about a move that was typically prohibited in tournaments, the duck jump, and

233
00:14:58,603 --> 00:15:02,684
asking them why that was prohibited, and time and again they would say, it's ugly.

234
00:15:04,092 --> 00:15:06,394
It doesn't really look good.

235
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:08,976
It doesn't have a feel of skillful play.

236
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:13,479
That's a really nuanced assessment

237
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:17,322
of what virtuosic play can and should be.

238
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:19,064
And I think for designers,

239
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:20,545
there's an interesting challenge there

240
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:25,109
about how do you put out artifacts into the world

241
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:27,511
and let them still be iterated by communities.

242
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:29,933
So this close connection, I think,

243
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:35,125
between communities and their competitive artifacts is something that we risk losing

244
00:15:35,205 --> 00:15:40,189
sight of if we think too narrowly about things like intellectual property.

245
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:45,914
In fact, competitive communities have been powerful developers of some of the most important

246
00:15:45,954 --> 00:15:47,015
spaces in the scene.

247
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:53,060
A very long-standing, hugely popular map in Counter-Strike, Dust.

248
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:58,016
goes back to a modding community, and in fact Counter-Strike itself has its roots in modding.

249
00:15:58,636 --> 00:16:05,780
Dota, which we now take for granted as a title and a genre, again has its roots in the modding community.

250
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,142
And then there's also really fascinating projects like

251
00:16:09,822 --> 00:16:15,285
Project M, where players are trying to again weave together iterations of other games

252
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:21,688
to present, to have a space, to do the kind of play that they find most competitively satisfying.

253
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:27,697
Now the risk with talking about transformative play and transformative work, of course, is

254
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:33,302
that we also have a climate of very narrow intellectual property boundaries.

255
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:38,987
And we, in the MMO period, we saw skirmishes around IP, for example, when players would

256
00:16:39,027 --> 00:16:43,230
say things like, well, I own my avatar, shouldn't I be allowed to sell it on eBay?

257
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:45,532
And companies got very nervous about that.

258
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:46,373
I think we're...

259
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:53,524
Entering a new period around intellectual property debates where it's often third parties and not individuals.

260
00:16:53,585 --> 00:16:58,569
So it's game developers and third-party organizations who feel they also have a stake.

261
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:05,254
My call today, my challenge to you, especially if you're developers and designers, is how do we have,

262
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:11,900
how do we think about a much more robust and nuanced understanding of the role of communities and IP

263
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,703
that understands it's sort of a co-creative process between the two?

264
00:17:17,351 --> 00:17:22,396
Of course, game developers, you know, pick your favorite game, you can go and find the

265
00:17:22,436 --> 00:17:25,899
guidelines in terms of service and use that guides using those.

266
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,643
Again, they're often about non-commercialism or content regulation.

267
00:17:30,123 --> 00:17:35,088
I think generally they're too narrow an intellectual property frame for the transformative work

268
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:36,489
that we're seeing in these spaces.

269
00:17:37,377 --> 00:17:43,818
And as I mentioned, I'm working now to update the eSports book to take into account live

270
00:17:43,838 --> 00:17:47,919
streaming and I think when you start looking at the impact live streaming has had, and

271
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:52,881
I don't just mean the big tournaments, I mean everyday people broadcasting their play, transforming

272
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:54,701
private play into public entertainment.

273
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:56,382
This question of

274
00:17:56,764 --> 00:18:00,566
You know, co-creation, who owns what, is really important.

275
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:04,027
But you can also just, quite frankly, watch on the ground.

276
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:06,108
People iterate strategies.

277
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:09,609
Communities produce preferred modes of play together, collectively.

278
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:14,171
So I'll leave on one very big meta, which is, I actually think...

279
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:20,778
My call is broad because it's not just a kind of quirky design question or a thing about

280
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:21,439
development.

281
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:27,242
I really think we need to understand eSports as cultural products with real stakes.

282
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:28,522
They matter to the culture.

283
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:34,706
And that means we have to take them seriously as transformative spaces, that they're not

284
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:40,149
owned by any one person, that communities play a powerful role in constructing what

285
00:18:40,229 --> 00:18:41,650
they want their play to be.

286
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,950
And I think if you're...

287
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:46,365
interested in understanding how to make a

288
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:53,790
eSports space that is actually going to be vibrant. You'll be thinking about communities and iteration from the get-go.

289
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,471
All right, I'll end there. Thanks.

290
00:19:04,237 --> 00:19:05,618
There's a lot of time for questions.

291
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:19,232
Thank you.

292
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:21,994
Thank you.

293
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:23,135
Thank you.

294
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:27,738
Just a quick question about where do you see speed running fitting into all of this and

295
00:19:27,758 --> 00:19:29,159
the sort of growth in that area?

296
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:31,481
Yeah, I think speed running is fantastic.

297
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:35,864
Again, it's one of those things, there's a history, right, to it, but it's another great

298
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:38,866
example of people taking the bounds of the system.

299
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:42,017
pushing them to their limits and exploring what they can do.

300
00:19:42,077 --> 00:19:48,143
And I think it's really fascinating to see the way speed running has garnered now an

301
00:19:48,324 --> 00:19:53,429
audience through live streaming and a spectatorship where people are participating in that form

302
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:53,830
of play.

303
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,855
And of course, depending on if it's utilizing glitchiness too, you know.

304
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:04,888
Designers, I mean, not all, but some designers can be very precious about their objects.

305
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:09,692
And I think there's something quite lovely when players go in and kind of push and play

306
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:11,253
in ways that weren't always intended.

307
00:20:11,373 --> 00:20:13,215
So I don't know if that gets at what you're...

308
00:20:16,337 --> 00:20:17,999
Hi, I'm Sam Ellsburn, a student.

309
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,806
So one of the things that I think about mostly with competitive games is sort of the morbid

310
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:31,034
reality that depending on how a developer might change either a certain mechanic or

311
00:20:32,376 --> 00:20:35,900
take away a skill from a certain character, that that might...

312
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:44,164
ruin a professional eSports player career, either because they can't compete anymore

313
00:20:44,184 --> 00:20:47,106
or they just aren't as viable as another player.

314
00:20:47,186 --> 00:20:50,007
So I just want to know what is your thought on that.

315
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:51,708
Yeah, no, I think it's a great point.

316
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:59,671
And we of course see this happen all the time when developers roll out patches that the

317
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:01,072
community isn't prepared for.

318
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:03,033
Sometimes right before a tournament.

319
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:04,154
So you're right.

320
00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:06,876
I mean in some ways it's a very precarious playing field.

321
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:10,298
Of course it's worth keeping in mind that in traditional sports,

322
00:21:11,018 --> 00:21:14,060
equipment also changes and can change the shape of play.

323
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,222
But I think one of the key things there is that

324
00:21:17,322 --> 00:21:22,185
especially as developers decide that they want to be more involved in eSports,

325
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:27,288
that they have to be sensitive for the ways those ripple effects kind of work through the community.

326
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:28,168
Thank you.

327
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:35,614
It was a great talk and I really like the line as well about thinking about sort of beautiful players, that act of creativity.

328
00:21:36,114 --> 00:21:41,899
And I wanted to ask you, you kind of said in regards to sort of legal frameworks that you perhaps perceived some of the,

329
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:45,281
I'm assuming some of the larger commercial companies as being a little bit too restrictive.

330
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:52,407
But the need for companies and for competitive eSports to come out of those creative and

331
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:56,330
that history of modern communities, do you perceive, I guess, a lot of the large heavyweights

332
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:02,334
in that space at the moment to be too restrictive with their games and how tenable that situation

333
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,595
might be?

334
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:09,180
And if so or if not, where are the spaces you might see other titles coming from?

335
00:22:10,847 --> 00:22:15,848
So, my feeling right now when it comes to the IP stuff in games is that

336
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:20,890
developers are generally happy if people tinker,

337
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,811
as long as it's non-commercial and or doesn't affect the brand.

338
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:30,653
And I think both of those are insufficient models for cultural production.

339
00:22:31,313 --> 00:22:35,734
So I both think people have a right to make money off of remix-reuse,

340
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,215
that that is the work of culture.

341
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,901
We are always working over artifacts.

342
00:22:42,963 --> 00:22:48,207
And that if you really want to take games seriously as a cultural product or a sports product,

343
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,790
that you can't always control the brand.

344
00:22:53,171 --> 00:23:00,416
So, I think the battles around this are, we're probably much more likely to see them through the live streaming stuff that's happening.

345
00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:08,663
But yeah, I'd like to see, I would like to see co-creative models really flourish a lot more than they do right now.

346
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:19,323
Hi, thank you for the talk. It's nice to hear from an academic background.

347
00:23:19,723 --> 00:23:22,945
I'm checking your website right now, it's a podcast and everything, it's very interesting.

348
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:26,908
My question is, how do you...

349
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:29,990
What do you think eSport is?

350
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:33,492
For me, I do competitive gaming.

351
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:36,455
Is it for glory that you're better than other people?

352
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,317
And eSport, right now, there's a lot of money flowing around.

353
00:23:39,817 --> 00:23:41,098
So it's got a lot of media attention.

354
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:41,658
Is it because of...

355
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:42,759
Is it for money?

356
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:43,780
Is it for glory?

357
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,902
Or like what you were saying, there's a social aspect for it.

358
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:48,103
Is this for the bromance?

359
00:23:48,743 --> 00:23:50,565
So what do you think eSport is?

360
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,663
All of the above and in different iterations.

361
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:57,407
So I think it can vary over the life of a player.

362
00:23:58,207 --> 00:24:01,050
I think it can vary over the context of a scene.

363
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:05,195
So in my experience interviewing pro players over the years,

364
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:11,301
at the root of it is a fundamental passion for...

365
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:15,616
not just competition, but getting and being better.

366
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:21,178
And it is the thing, it's the thing that when I did MMO work, I sort of distinguished

367
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:26,540
power gamers, like the folks who are willing to fail and go over and over and over again,

368
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,602
that fundamentally it's that. It's a thing I don't have. It's why I would give up after

369
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:36,664
a handful of tries. But I think as people inhabit eSports spaces, of course you know,

370
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:41,154
The fame, the glory, the satisfaction, that can all play a role.

371
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:45,818
But fundamentally, at the root, I think it is something about this,

372
00:24:46,378 --> 00:24:50,923
usually a deep passion for the game and a deep passion to keep getting better.

373
00:24:51,303 --> 00:24:54,186
And it's part of, one of the earlier talks today,

374
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,007
it may have been echoed in a couple of them.

375
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,250
I think it's really important to think about the socialization process of

376
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,111
an e-sports player.

377
00:25:00,151 --> 00:25:01,312
You don't just start as a pro.

378
00:25:02,153 --> 00:25:07,737
And often the trajectory is you kind of start beating everybody in your friends and family network,

379
00:25:07,777 --> 00:25:13,141
and then maybe it's everybody in your town, and then maybe it's everybody at the local sort of level, regional level,

380
00:25:13,201 --> 00:25:16,364
and you keep going up. But I think that's often what drives folks.

381
00:25:16,924 --> 00:25:17,225
Thank you.

382
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:17,605
Yeah.

383
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:23,430
Oh, this is really hot.

384
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:30,495
So, hi. I was just wondering, you were mentioning about, obviously now companies are sort of eyeing

385
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:34,228
eSports and their games as eSports in that sort of,

386
00:25:34,949 --> 00:25:38,332
oh, maybe we should be doing more or getting more involved.

387
00:25:38,692 --> 00:25:45,618
I was interested in which companies you think are doing that in healthy ways or in interesting

388
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:49,121
ways, because I mean, you know, you can just sort of throw a kind of, well, here's an API,

389
00:25:49,822 --> 00:25:50,343
do something.

390
00:25:51,303 --> 00:25:51,644
Yeah.

391
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:54,306
Yeah.

392
00:25:55,307 --> 00:25:55,627
Sorry.

393
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:57,149
Yeah, that's a good question.

394
00:25:59,665 --> 00:26:02,787
I don't know that I have a name to name for you in that regard.

395
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:07,711
I think there are companies who are trying to work, for example, with teams.

396
00:26:07,831 --> 00:26:11,973
So like the expert users become the teams and they solicit feedback.

397
00:26:12,594 --> 00:26:18,077
But I think, you know, again, if you heard the team owners panel earlier, I think you

398
00:26:18,097 --> 00:26:22,440
can begin to sense that it's, you know, these aren't flat systems.

399
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,063
They're still like who owns the stuff and where do we get feedback from?

400
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:29,120
What are the layers in which we say, okay, we're not going to listen to that, but we're

401
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,880
going to listen to this.

402
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:35,902
So I think, yeah, so as I mentioned, there's, I think that, you know, there are interesting

403
00:26:35,982 --> 00:26:40,243
projects out there trying to do stuff, but I don't know that I would say any one company

404
00:26:40,283 --> 00:26:41,004
has it perfect.

405
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,684
Okay.

406
00:26:41,704 --> 00:26:41,964
Thank you.

407
00:26:42,024 --> 00:26:42,504
Yeah.

408
00:26:44,305 --> 00:26:45,805
Firstly, thank you for your great talk.

409
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:48,195
I'm a professor from Taiwan as well.

410
00:26:49,057 --> 00:26:53,202
My question is, you mentioned the community does matter, right?

411
00:26:53,802 --> 00:27:00,631
And can you see the Xbox hand moving from the PC to mobile?

412
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:07,980
Can you see the difference between the community on traditional eSports and the community on

413
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,381
mobile?

414
00:27:08,621 --> 00:27:09,522
It's a great question.

415
00:27:09,602 --> 00:27:14,628
I was in India this last year and it was the first time I started thinking more about that

416
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:18,892
question because in India they just simply don't have the same infrastructures of play

417
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,513
that we do here.

418
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:23,356
And so mobile is a thing that they were thinking a lot about.

419
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:29,560
And I think this is exactly where the power of communities to figure out how to piece

420
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,642
together a system that's going to work for them is going to be really important.

421
00:27:32,682 --> 00:27:38,466
So if folks are developing in those spaces, watching the emergent practices that are already

422
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:40,268
bubbling up is going to be pretty key.

423
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:50,431
It's not a model that we've had so much here, in part because of the dominance of PCs and consoles, but I tend to not be a purist.

424
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:57,936
Like, people find ways, you know, so I wouldn't, I would not be surprised if that becomes a viable path.

425
00:27:58,417 --> 00:28:06,843
But what it looks like is going to matter a lot to how networks are configured, the context of play, and the kind of organizations that are already on the ground.

426
00:28:07,764 --> 00:28:08,404
Okay, thank you.

427
00:28:08,424 --> 00:28:08,805
Yeah, sure.

428
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,733
What do you think of fantasy leagues in the whole context of esports?

429
00:28:20,793 --> 00:28:23,195
Yeah, makes perfect sense to me, right?

430
00:28:23,215 --> 00:28:26,498
I mean, people love fantasy sports.

431
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:29,540
It's a huge industry when it comes to traditional gaming.

432
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,322
I think it makes perfect sense.

433
00:28:31,902 --> 00:28:35,465
Probably the most interesting thing right now is around the regulation of that stuff.

434
00:28:36,446 --> 00:28:38,327
The same way with like skins gambling.

435
00:28:39,628 --> 00:28:46,052
But it makes perfect sense to me. I think probably the trickier bit will be the churn issue in eSports.

436
00:28:46,672 --> 00:28:52,436
So whereas in fantasy sports people may be pretty assured that they have a player or a team

437
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:56,899
that they're following year in and year out or there's some fandom that's continuous.

438
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:02,903
We know there's a lot of churn in eSports and that may be a trickier thing to have to navigate when it comes to fantasy stuff.

439
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:07,817
All right, I think that's time, unless I'm, yep.

440
00:29:08,338 --> 00:29:09,361
Thank you all for coming.

441
00:29:10,063 --> 00:29:11,546
Stay for the remaining eSports stuff.

442
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:11,987
It'll be good.

443
00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:12,829
All right, thanks.
