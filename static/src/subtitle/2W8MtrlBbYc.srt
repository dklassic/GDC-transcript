1
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,648
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:05,648 --> 00:00:07,188
First, let me introduce myself.

3
00:00:07,188 --> 00:00:09,629
I'm Tabata from Square Enix. Nice to meet you all.

4
00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:11,849
Good morning everyone. Just let me introduce myself.

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:13,750
As most of you probably know me already,

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,570
but my name is Hajime Tabata.

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,791
I'm the director of Final Fantasy from Square Enix.

8
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,071
Hi, I'm your interpreter for today.

9
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:21,032
I'm Rui Kawada.

10
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:23,372
I'm the chief project manager of Final Fantasy XV.

11
00:00:34,716 --> 00:00:39,441
Yes, but everyone is nervous because it's the first day, right?

12
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:47,448
It seems like everybody is kind of like a little bit nervous and very quiet because it's very early in the morning.

13
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:51,572
Okay, let's do a little bit of a Japanese lesson together.

14
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:55,336
A Japanese kind of morning kind of like, you know, greetings.

15
00:00:55,336 --> 00:00:56,617
Yeah, just repeat after me.

16
00:00:56,617 --> 00:00:56,937
Here we go.

17
00:00:56,937 --> 00:00:57,158
Good morning.

18
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:04,983
Okay, very good.

19
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:07,423
Let's do that then.

20
00:01:07,423 --> 00:01:16,206
Before starting my today's session, let's look at the trailer which we released after the launch of Final Fantasy XV.

21
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:17,007
Let's take a look.

22
00:01:42,348 --> 00:01:44,049
I fear I have left too much unsaid.

23
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:47,933
Take care on the long road.

24
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:54,659
Wheresoever you should go,

25
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:01,986
the line of Lucis goes with you.

26
00:02:01,986 --> 00:02:03,987
Octon, my son.

27
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:24,679
Thank you.

28
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:35,108
So you just saw the trailer and as you know we released Final Fantasy XV last year in November

29
00:03:35,108 --> 00:03:47,279
and the GDC actually asked me to come here and share my development expertise based on the success of Final Fantasy XV.

30
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:53,474
I think that FFXV is currently a success in the business.

31
00:03:53,474 --> 00:04:01,638
But if you ask me if it's a personal success, it's a little different.

32
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:07,481
It's not like I'm rich or anything. It's normal.

33
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:18,445
But mine isn't actually really a success story, and I don't have any magical expertise to speak of,

34
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:21,866
and I haven't suddenly become a millionaire either.

35
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:26,888
To be honest, for me, FFXV has more to offer than just a successful story.

36
00:04:26,888 --> 00:04:32,089
It's a lot more about reflection and learning.

37
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:37,471
So instead of a lot of success stories, I have a lot of regret and learning from my experiences.

38
00:04:37,471 --> 00:04:39,451
So what can you tell us about FFXV?

39
00:04:40,977 --> 00:04:43,159
then what I can tell you today during my talk.

40
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:48,164
I took on the challenges I took on with my teammates

41
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:50,286
through the FFXV project.

42
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:55,470
My story is really simply about the challenges I took on with my teammates.

43
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,313
I can't tell you the success story,

44
00:04:58,313 --> 00:05:05,099
but I thought I could tell you what I learned and what I saw through the challenge.

45
00:05:05,624 --> 00:05:12,028
So I'm here today, I can surely tell you what I learned,

46
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:16,191
and so through this challenge.

47
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,773
It's not about the success story.

48
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:22,495
But today I'd like to share three lessons

49
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:26,338
we learned in particular.

50
00:05:35,265 --> 00:05:50,011
It won't be your typical GDC talk, but it's about the very high level of design for a gigantic project called Final Fantasy XV.

51
00:05:50,011 --> 00:06:04,396
I'll try to make it fun as much as possible, and it will be useful to you at some point, so I hope you'll bear with me.

52
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:14,218
By the way, friends and teams are always important to me from my childhood days.

53
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:17,700
So let me tell you a little bit about my story.

54
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,422
I used to ski competitively as a kid.

55
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,443
It's called slalom.

56
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:25,605
I was the fastest in my ski club.

57
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:31,349
So even with all the kids there, I entered a local tournament.

58
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:39,773
I made my parents promise to buy me a Game & Watch if I won.

59
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:43,714
My parents never bought me a game up to that point.

60
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:10,366
I kept thinking about whether I should get Donkey Kong or Mickey and Donald.

61
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:15,469
I lost the tournament in the preliminary.

62
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:21,954
I was convinced that there was someone stronger than me.

63
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,021
I just convinced myself there was a really strong guy there.

64
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:34,402
But it turned out the guy that beat me lost in the final.

65
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:41,264
And that guy who won the local tournament got beaten in the regionals.

66
00:07:53,564 --> 00:08:01,728
I was back then, I was 11, but that's when I realized there will always be someone better than you.

67
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:06,510
I think that's because I'm more focused on team play than individual play.

68
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:11,432
I think that's because I'm more focused on team play than individual play.

69
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:16,774
Even if you can't win alone, but you can still play for the winning team.

70
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:18,255
That's what I learned from this experience.

71
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:21,156
Yes, that's the main point.

72
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:23,037
Back to the original topic.

73
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,971
The first lesson is about a goal.

74
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:33,216
This is what the father of Final Fantasy, Mr. Hironobu Sakaguchi, said.

75
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:41,382
So namely, what did making Final Fantasy a challenger again mean?

76
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:57,496
It meant approaching the project believing this was our last chance.

77
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:02,299
If we don't do it this time, there won't be a next time.

78
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:10,025
I heard from him that there's a lot of people who are really interested in this project.

79
00:09:17,852 --> 00:09:22,234
That's where the final in Final Fantasy comes from originally.

80
00:09:22,234 --> 00:09:27,037
Right after I was named director of Final Fantasy XV,

81
00:09:27,037 --> 00:09:30,920
I talked to the regional sales head

82
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,602
and received the sales forecast from each region.

83
00:09:34,602 --> 00:09:37,264
So right after I was named director of Final Fantasy XV,

84
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:40,706
I talked to the regional sales head

85
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,388
and received the sales forecast from each region.

86
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:52,581
The numbers were not solid, it was very severe, under 5 million worldwide.

87
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:07,200
Unlike the past, it was a turn-based battle, so we changed it to an action-based battle.

88
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,701
The reason for this was the change in the way we played and the brand of FF.

89
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:38,492
I set a sales goal of 1 million copies higher than the forecast, to 6 million.

90
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:58,003
So knowing we had to surpass that would bring us together and force us to take up the courage to push through whatever stood in our way.

91
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:30,966
So as a Final Fantasy, I've got a lot of history in the past, and as the latest installment of the Final Fantasy franchise, this is the goal that Final Fantasy XV should take.

92
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:47,499
So I approached it with a way how the original Final Fantasy 1 did, so that if it didn't

93
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:51,103
succeed, it would all be over.

94
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:13,044
So, look at this slide. If I compare this challenge to mountain climbing,

95
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:18,145
let's compare it to the previous titles I was involved with.

96
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:20,446
I used to work on handheld titles, as you know,

97
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:26,828
and compared the first two titles actually on portable devices.

98
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:44,078
If it were mountain climbing, this project would be like this.

99
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:09,256
If my previous titles I got involved was kind of like 3,000 meters kind of like the mountains,

100
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:15,640
Final Fantasy XV would be Mount McKinley, so 6,000 meters high.

101
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:21,164
The official name now is Denali, but I call it McKinley during my speech.

102
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:36,809
I had never climbed such a high mountain before, so I had no idea what equipment, route or plan I should use to climb it.

103
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:42,533
At first, I was quite confused about what to do.

104
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:53,746
Speaking Japanese

105
00:13:53,746 --> 00:14:05,093
Yet by setting the goal high, I made a lot of true friends who offered to stand by me.

106
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:08,376
Speaking Japanese

107
00:14:08,376 --> 00:14:16,221
Yes, scaling that mountain wasn't my goal alone, it was our goal, all of us.

108
00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:33,124
I now realize your true friends are the ones that stick with you to the end through good

109
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:34,104
times and bad.

110
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:53,709
And my friends and I built a studio to make Final Fantasy XV,

111
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:57,951
and that studio was called Business Division 2, BD2.

112
00:14:57,951 --> 00:14:58,111
Yes.

113
00:14:58,111 --> 00:15:00,552
Everyone, when you are working on something,

114
00:15:00,552 --> 00:15:04,194
try to set a clear goal of making it happen.

115
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:11,097
So we took on development and marketing,

116
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:12,857
knowing there is no second chance,

117
00:15:12,857 --> 00:15:15,458
and that became the mantra of our project.

118
00:15:16,505 --> 00:15:23,727
And in any endeavor, try setting one clear goal that you realize at all cost, and when

119
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:31,988
it's abstract, make it concrete and an object goal that can be conveyed to others.

120
00:15:31,988 --> 00:15:36,529
And the second lesson involves teamwork.

121
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:53,725
So we needed expertise and technology to conquer the 6,000-meter-tall peak at Mount McKinley.

122
00:15:53,725 --> 00:16:01,030
So we decided to update all the 3,000-meter-tall mountains that we had as know-how.

123
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:18,833
So our experience, past experience in 3,000 meter climbs wouldn't apply.

124
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:26,775
So we needed a new knowledge base, new tech, and new tools.

125
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:32,536
We needed a new knowledge base, new tech, and new tools.

126
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:38,077
On top of that, we needed a team that could wield them and take us to the peak.

127
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,122
Conceptually, it will be a mass of mastery.

128
00:16:42,122 --> 00:16:50,689
So first of all, they told me their strengths and what they wanted to do, and I asked them to do what they do best.

129
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:01,693
I didn't want to compete with my weak points.

130
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:06,036
I wanted to contribute to the project with my strengths.

131
00:17:06,036 --> 00:17:07,757
I asked everyone to do that.

132
00:17:07,757 --> 00:17:09,998
I created a team that could do that kind of design.

133
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:15,122
The roles are assigned by pairing strength and personality

134
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:17,864
to maximize performance at all times.

135
00:17:17,864 --> 00:17:23,147
IMAGE is a strong and flexible organization like a pro sports team.

136
00:17:23,905 --> 00:17:27,026
So it was a grand restructuring that

137
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:29,407
reset the existing hierarchy and assumed

138
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:31,847
the mode of a football team.

139
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:32,787
SPEAKER 1.

140
00:17:32,787 --> 00:17:34,128
SPEAKER 2.

141
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:35,528
SPEAKER 3.

142
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:36,668
SPEAKER 4.

143
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:38,529
SPEAKER 5.

144
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:39,089
SPEAKER 6.

145
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:39,449
SPEAKER 7.

146
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:40,549
SPEAKER 8.

147
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:41,449
SPEAKER 9.

148
00:17:41,449 --> 00:17:41,949
SPEAKER 10.

149
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:42,470
SPEAKER 11.

150
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,330
SPEAKER 12.

151
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,250
SPEAKER 13.

152
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:44,610
SPEAKER 14.

153
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,530
SPEAKER 15.

154
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,610
SPEAKER 16.

155
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,111
SPEAKER 17.

156
00:17:47,111 --> 00:17:48,351
SPEAKER 18.

157
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:49,811
SPEAKER 19.

158
00:17:49,811 --> 00:17:50,851
SPEAKER 20.

159
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:51,272
SPEAKER 21.

160
00:17:53,113 --> 00:18:00,617
We were able to challenge many development milestones in different formations

161
00:18:00,617 --> 00:18:03,939
and achieve many results.

162
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:07,821
As a result, we literally changed the formations

163
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:11,563
to optimize for each development milestone.

164
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:14,305
I think everyone is working now,

165
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:19,548
but do you tell your teammates and leaders what you want to do?

166
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:25,048
I'm sure all of you here today have got your professional work, but how many of you have

167
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:32,389
actually told your peers and bosses your strength and what it is you want to do?

168
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:35,650
If you are not satisfied with your performance, please try this method.

169
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:42,652
Communicate these things can really help bring out the best in yourself.

170
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:46,893
I highly recommend to those who need to design the team.

171
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:58,535
Maybe you are not the actual problem, it's the organization itself that is the problem.

172
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:19,846
So if this is the case for you, and once the team changes and learns how to utilize you,

173
00:19:19,846 --> 00:19:23,667
you can deliver the best performance ever.

174
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:28,888
What I aimed for with FF15 was to create a team of 200 or 300 players,

175
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:32,609
which is the average number of players in American football.

176
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:39,130
On a team scale, it's like having a squad of 200 specialized American football players

177
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,350
instead of like normal 11 players.

178
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:54,631
As a result, the Final Fantasy XV amassed a great deal of energy once it got rolling.

179
00:19:54,631 --> 00:20:10,203
Right after the development started, many people felt that there was a wall to the development of Open World, but thanks to this strong team, we were able to break through that wall.

180
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:16,568
So we managed to overcome our biggest technical hurdle,

181
00:20:16,568 --> 00:20:22,611
which was to create an open world environment and game

182
00:20:22,611 --> 00:20:29,255
system when we had no prior experience of this before.

183
00:20:29,255 --> 00:20:35,599
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA So the team worked nonstop up to March

184
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,041
2015 when we released a demo titled Episode Dusk Eye.

185
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:44,201
What this demo was like, I would like you to watch the video first.

186
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:49,543
What it was like is very important for the next part of the presentation.

187
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:52,844
So, some people probably don't know about this demo.

188
00:20:52,844 --> 00:20:56,625
So, let's have a look at this trailer of what the demo was

189
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,946
and the status of the game back in early 2015.

190
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:05,108
And if you could watch the trailer as it leads to what I would like to talk about next.

191
00:21:17,783 --> 00:21:19,400
["We Wish You a Merry Christmas"]

192
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:46,741
This was actually the trailer that was made two years before the actual launch of the game.

193
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:50,164
Making this demo was a proof of concept for us.

194
00:22:57,886 --> 00:23:01,209
The core system of FFXV is a daily cycle.

195
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:08,816
We make sure that the cycle from day to night is the basic system of the game,

196
00:23:08,816 --> 00:23:12,219
and we make sure that the various game designs around it work.

197
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:19,325
It gave us a clear idea of what else we needed for our final product and how much work it would take.

198
00:23:19,325 --> 00:23:25,350
The base concept of Final Fantasy XV is the daily cycle, the day and night cycle.

199
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:31,069
To make sure that the basic cycle works, we needed to have a minimum number of locations.

200
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:37,114
We thought that we needed to have the minimum number of combat, camp, and character growth equipment.

201
00:23:55,591 --> 00:24:01,695
We had a lot of feedback from the users about the character's likes and dislikes,

202
00:24:01,695 --> 00:24:04,596
but our game design was mostly good.

203
00:24:04,596 --> 00:24:08,799
So with this episode, Dusk Eye, towards the game design,

204
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,581
the user reaction was pretty much like what we expected,

205
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:17,244
but towards the characters, obviously up to the users,

206
00:24:17,244 --> 00:24:21,026
who they like to play, who they really like.

207
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:21,346
However,

208
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:35,144
But actually, the development team faced a very, very severe problem at that point.

209
00:24:47,785 --> 00:24:51,667
Yeah, like I said, obviously, by making this demo,

210
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:54,448
it was a kind of proof of concepts for us.

211
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:56,868
So it gave us kind of like the idea

212
00:24:56,868 --> 00:25:00,770
of how much work still needs to be done.

213
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:04,051
Speaking Japanese

214
00:25:04,051 --> 00:25:07,772
So we realized we were only at the third station

215
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:11,593
on our way up the mountain.

216
00:25:16,034 --> 00:25:33,928
We were halfway done in terms of our development progress, but the peak was still in the distance, and the task was great.

217
00:25:42,905 --> 00:25:50,309
it's the time we really had to confront the chaos that came at us with the teams.

218
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:57,213
We were moving well until then, but now we lost our will.

219
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:23,495
So obviously the volume we needed to get it done was big, so racked by chronic pressure and fatigue and insecurity.

220
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:27,777
So our team lost its muster and performance dropped off sharply.

221
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:40,368
So the summer 2015, summer to autumn 2015,

222
00:26:40,368 --> 00:26:43,989
the performance of the team dropped really, really sharply.

223
00:26:43,989 --> 00:26:48,691
So we couldn't kind of deliver what we really needed to do.

224
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:48,751
Yes.

225
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:49,611
Yes.

226
00:26:49,611 --> 00:26:54,673
So I found the answer to where is our home.

227
00:26:54,673 --> 00:27:00,275
One day, when I was about to go out to work,

228
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:11,871
At the time, my 6 year old daughter came to me and hugged me.

229
00:27:11,871 --> 00:27:18,294
She looked very lonely and asked me,

230
00:27:18,294 --> 00:27:22,536
how long are you going to be busy?

231
00:27:22,536 --> 00:27:26,118
I looked troubled and said,

232
00:27:26,118 --> 00:27:30,060
I'm still busy for a while.

233
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:33,676
So without letting go, she asked me,

234
00:27:33,676 --> 00:27:36,278
how much longer will you be busy?

235
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:39,760
And not knowing what to say, I told her,

236
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,302
well, it's still going to be a while.

237
00:27:42,302 --> 00:27:43,603
So she said,

238
00:27:43,603 --> 00:27:45,784
she was about to cry, but she held it in,

239
00:27:45,784 --> 00:27:47,826
and made a smile,

240
00:27:47,826 --> 00:27:49,887
and said, Dad, hang in there,

241
00:27:49,887 --> 00:27:51,288
cheer up,

242
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:53,029
that's what she said.

243
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:57,292
And she brought me a picture of my smile,

244
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:58,293
and gave it to me as a present.

245
00:27:59,148 --> 00:28:02,609
and on hearing that she held her tears back

246
00:28:02,609 --> 00:28:06,649
so I wouldn't see and with a big smile said

247
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:08,910
chin up and keep up the good work daddy

248
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:13,871
then she back to her room and brought me a picture

249
00:28:13,871 --> 00:28:16,752
a drawing of me working

250
00:28:16,752 --> 00:28:21,873
it wasn't good drawing actually but I laughed a lot

251
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:33,762
I felt that she wanted me to be happy and smile all the time.

252
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:42,605
When I see her crying desperately, as a parent, I feel like I'm being crushed.

253
00:28:42,605 --> 00:28:48,147
At the same time, I want to show my family

254
00:28:52,615 --> 00:28:56,816
At the same time, I realized how much my family actually put up with.

255
00:28:56,816 --> 00:29:01,518
So, in order to solve this problem, I had a meeting straight away with my team.

256
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:25,404
And we decided to organize our own Bring Your Family to Work Day.

257
00:29:42,286 --> 00:29:50,475
The objective was to achieve a better work-life balance, to show appreciation to our families,

258
00:29:50,475 --> 00:29:53,578
and to give them peace of mind.

259
00:29:53,578 --> 00:29:58,864
So we paused for a moment and considered a way our families could learn about our work

260
00:29:58,864 --> 00:29:59,584
and also our goals.

261
00:30:01,215 --> 00:30:08,421
We spent quite a lot of time to prep for this actual family day, even though we were really

262
00:30:08,421 --> 00:30:14,446
in a hurry and also we were really worried about the development milestones and schedule.

263
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:33,025
Back then, the BD2, Business Division 2, had around 250 staff.

264
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:39,970
So bringing their own families to the office was such a big project for us.

265
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:57,531
The staff had a lot of kids, so we customized the FFXV for kids to play with.

266
00:30:57,531 --> 00:31:05,996
So what we did is we actually customized the Final Fantasy XV for the kids and set up some PCs for them.

267
00:31:05,996 --> 00:31:11,519
The kids really enjoyed playing the FFXV for the whole day.

268
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:18,223
My daughter is in the picture right now, and she played the game.

269
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:26,509
And actually our staff and their kids spent all day playing Final Fantasy XV together.

270
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:32,452
And my daughter was there too. She's actually in that photo somewhere.

271
00:31:42,448 --> 00:31:50,836
So our developers showed their husband and wives and parents,

272
00:31:50,836 --> 00:31:57,281
kids, their work desks, and showed them what it is they do.

273
00:31:57,281 --> 00:32:01,585
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JAPANESE INTERPRETER

274
00:32:01,585 --> 00:32:05,208
So showing them what we actually do every day

275
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07,650
gave us a kind of new appreciation for it.

276
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,652
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JAPANESE INTERPRETER

277
00:32:10,242 --> 00:32:17,246
It was really important for each staff to show what they actually do for work to their families.

278
00:32:17,246 --> 00:32:22,790
From there, the FFXV team regained their energy and went on to reach their goal.

279
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:30,816
By having this family day, we got our master back and set our sights on the goal again.

280
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,457
Compared to before,

281
00:32:33,425 --> 00:32:41,931
The key to having a stronger team, it was very, very important to have the family members

282
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:45,694
behind you to support you.

283
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:10,296
And the third lesson was in the result of our challenge.

284
00:33:10,296 --> 00:33:13,539
So let's take a look at this video.

285
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:25,468
This is actually a Japanese TVC which PlayStation Japan team actually made it for us.

286
00:34:19,437 --> 00:34:20,818
FINAL FANTASY XV

287
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:44,516
Yeah, as you can see, the development of the game was kind of winding down towards the end of the development phase.

288
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:49,739
We conducted events all over the world to get our global audience excited for the release.

289
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:52,501
But actually, there was a big, big crisis actually waiting for us.

290
00:35:06,596 --> 00:35:10,658
I'm not talking about our two months delay.

291
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:22,566
This actually happened after we'd mastered up and ready our day one patch.

292
00:35:22,566 --> 00:35:29,670
I'm talking about spoilers from places that broke street date.

293
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:40,984
We never did simultaneous worldwide launch before, so we lacked the expertise to stop copies from getting out early.

294
00:35:40,984 --> 00:35:49,766
If the early birds were enjoying it in silence, we could bear it.

295
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:50,166
Ta-da!

296
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:07,638
But that there are people actually actively trying to ruin the experience for those waiting

297
00:36:07,638 --> 00:36:10,621
for the launch with campaigns on social media.

298
00:36:31,436 --> 00:36:38,701
And I spoke to the relevant parties and heard a lot of people actually complaining about it.

299
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:49,868
I spoke to the relevant parties and heard a lot of people actually complaining about it.

300
00:36:49,868 --> 00:36:56,372
And then I discussed internally and warned our fans about the threat,

301
00:36:56,372 --> 00:37:00,174
and made it clear we wouldn't take ill, intentional behavior lightly.

302
00:37:01,557 --> 00:37:06,541
So we lost a lot of the malicious spoilers,

303
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:15,028
but on the other hand, the criticism of Bokkojin and the game itself

304
00:37:15,028 --> 00:37:24,856
heated up and had a negative impact on the promotion.

305
00:37:24,856 --> 00:37:30,961
There were a lot of lessons learned from this.

306
00:37:32,003 --> 00:37:34,625
But I learned a lot from this experience.

307
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:42,708
But if I find myself in a similar situation again, what should I do?

308
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:46,470
How are you going to face the situation?

309
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:09,079
Rather than relying on enforcement, I probably would come up with another solution.

310
00:38:25,896 --> 00:38:33,421
For example, I'm thinking I'd like to use the spoiler makers to our advantage and create buzz

311
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:38,544
and come up with an idea to integrate them into promotion somehow.

312
00:38:38,544 --> 00:38:40,906
Like the Family Day project,

313
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:48,731
when you're in a pinch, you need a bold idea to overcome it and turn it into an opportunity.

314
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:55,802
As with the Family Day episode, I believe it's critical to look at crisis as opportunities,

315
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:58,763
because there is always a drama.

316
00:39:17,483 --> 00:39:23,505
Yeah, not only like a big project like Final Fantasy XV, but any other project you're working on,

317
00:39:23,505 --> 00:39:30,168
there is always a drama and a crisis and some other big problems waiting for you.

318
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:40,412
What I really learned from my experience in the development of Final Fantasy is this slide.

319
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:44,014
So take crisis into opportunities.

320
00:39:45,923 --> 00:39:50,205
We were finally able to complete FFXV and release it.

321
00:39:50,205 --> 00:39:56,827
We were able to reach our goal of 6 million sales in a month.

322
00:39:56,827 --> 00:40:02,329
As I said at the beginning,

323
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:05,109
if this doesn't hit, it's over.

324
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:07,290
There's no next time.

325
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:16,625
I'm hoping for the next one.

326
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:23,310
I'm sure you all understand now, but to me FFXV is not a success story.

327
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:51,153
So now you've already probably realized that my story about Final Fantasy XV is not a success story.

328
00:40:57,605 --> 00:41:07,189
Yeah, so I don't have any magical expertise from this undertaking, but I know now that

329
00:41:07,189 --> 00:41:16,233
the greatest goals can only be reached by taking big chances.

330
00:41:23,613 --> 00:41:35,620
So now we know there are big chances waiting for us, so we'll continue to take on challenges for Final Fantasy XV and also as well as other new challenges.

331
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:54,494
and bring Final Fantasy back to the challengers.

332
00:41:54,494 --> 00:42:02,036
I think this is another answer to the theme we have worked on.

333
00:42:02,036 --> 00:42:09,958
It's almost time to wrap up, so I will say something a bit GDC-like.

334
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:21,601
So, towards the end of my talk, so let's end on a proper GDC note.

335
00:42:21,601 --> 00:42:31,926
So, I brought a little video that my team has made and a little peek at where we are at.

336
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:34,507
Let's take a look.

337
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:25,378
Thank you.

338
00:45:25,378 --> 00:45:26,198
Applause

339
00:45:26,198 --> 00:45:29,719
Speaking Japanese

340
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:37,202
So we are currently working on three big points.

341
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:41,783
Procedural, AI and Distraction.

342
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:53,847
We are actually working together very closely with NVIDIA's Gameworks team.

343
00:45:53,847 --> 00:46:03,410
Probably it was difficult because it was very quick, so it was difficult to actually see the actual scene, the monster scene.

344
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:22,212
That scene was actually showing the monster battle algorithm.

345
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:31,175
They actually kind of try to analyze the player's kind of like play pattern and then to make

346
00:46:31,175 --> 00:46:34,196
the animal kind of battle pattern.

347
00:46:41,214 --> 00:46:44,995
based on that player's battle pattern.

348
00:46:44,995 --> 00:46:53,176
So we actually have our own goal already in sight.

349
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:57,697
It's a brand new challenge for us.

350
00:46:57,697 --> 00:47:03,358
Are you actually challenging anything new?

351
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:19,793
Do you want to kind of work on a challenge with us?

352
00:47:19,793 --> 00:47:31,217
So we are all open to any offers, like developers, technology, businesses.

353
00:47:32,288 --> 00:47:38,010
We won't be doing Q&A today, but if you'd like to contact us, please do so.

354
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:46,172
We look forward to hearing from you if you'd like to challenge the future of games.

355
00:48:02,577 --> 00:48:12,706
We are waiting to hear from anyone who wants to take these challenges with us.

356
00:48:12,706 --> 00:48:17,049
Actually, there is a special present.

357
00:48:17,049 --> 00:48:27,398
Our technical partner, NVIDIA, kindly prepared something.

358
00:48:29,942 --> 00:48:31,922
NVIDIA's branded backpack.

359
00:48:31,922 --> 00:48:38,304
I was thinking about who to give this to,

360
00:48:38,304 --> 00:48:43,446
but I think I'll give it to someone whose birthday is today.

361
00:48:43,446 --> 00:48:47,787
Yeah, I was kind of like thinking like how to give this away,

362
00:48:47,787 --> 00:48:52,649
but maybe today's birthday lucky person in this room.

363
00:48:52,649 --> 00:48:55,470
Is there anyone whose birthday is today?

364
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:58,171
Anyone whose birthday is today?

365
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,803
No one?

366
00:49:05,803 --> 00:49:07,504
No one?

367
00:49:07,504 --> 00:49:08,585
Nobody?

368
00:49:08,585 --> 00:49:11,968
For real?

369
00:49:11,968 --> 00:49:12,328
Zero.

370
00:49:12,328 --> 00:49:14,550
Ah, here they are.

371
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:15,971
There are two.

372
00:49:15,971 --> 00:49:18,853
Oh, yesterday!

373
00:49:18,853 --> 00:49:21,235
Yesterday.

374
00:49:21,235 --> 00:49:21,896
Yesterday.

375
00:49:21,896 --> 00:49:22,996
No, no, no.

376
00:49:22,996 --> 00:49:25,138
Let's see.

377
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:31,084
After the session, please check the chair you are sitting on.

378
00:49:31,084 --> 00:49:36,529
There is a mark where you can get a present.

379
00:49:36,529 --> 00:49:41,453
If you have it, please come out to the front after the session.

380
00:49:42,249 --> 00:49:49,755
Yeah, we actually put a little note under your chair.

381
00:49:49,755 --> 00:49:51,117
So if anyone found it...

382
00:49:51,117 --> 00:49:51,797
