1
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:06,889
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:06,909 --> 00:00:09,330
We're going to get started.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,371
Thank you very much for joining me during this session.

4
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:16,372
My name is Cyril.

5
00:00:16,652 --> 00:00:19,612
I work for Rovio in Finland, in Helsinki.

6
00:00:21,873 --> 00:00:23,873
And today we're going to talk about making games.

7
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:25,894
This is what we're going to talk about.

8
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:32,080
We're going to look back at what Rovio has done in the last two

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,745
years to modernize the production process, how

10
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:38,689
we look at game, and how we move forward with the production

11
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:39,090
process.

12
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,253
I'm going to start talking about myself, which is nice.

13
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:49,876
But it is relevant to this talk.

14
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:53,219
As you can see, I have been working

15
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:55,240
in the mechanical industry for 10 years

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,823
before I joined the game industry 11 years ago.

17
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:01,846
And this is quite relevant to what

18
00:01:01,886 --> 00:01:03,067
we are doing today at Rovio.

19
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:05,749
There's a lot of DNA that I took over

20
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:09,332
from the mechanical industry to today to the game industry.

21
00:01:10,788 --> 00:01:12,470
Let's think about it. I've got two points here.

22
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:15,374
The first point is about the type of product I used to do.

23
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:19,018
Aircraft, gas product, food packaging.

24
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:23,004
We can imagine that the level of quality of those products

25
00:01:23,064 --> 00:01:23,724
is quite high.

26
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:25,846
And I'm not only talking about the amount of bugs

27
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:27,847
we can see or defects we can see in those products,

28
00:01:27,907 --> 00:01:29,668
but also the usability of those products.

29
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:32,911
I'm sure we're all thinking about that now about games,

30
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:35,472
about the amount of bugs and usability of our games.

31
00:01:36,153 --> 00:01:38,534
But I learned the hard way when I was a quality manager

32
00:01:38,594 --> 00:01:40,916
that if one of my gas products was leaking,

33
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:42,737
I could injure people.

34
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:46,929
The other point is interesting.

35
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:48,150
Think about a factory.

36
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,571
Think about a high-speed production factory.

37
00:01:51,532 --> 00:01:52,672
I was a quality manager.

38
00:01:52,752 --> 00:01:54,233
I was an improvement manager.

39
00:01:55,094 --> 00:01:56,995
And I was running continuous improvement.

40
00:01:57,155 --> 00:02:00,277
I was running improvement with the process,

41
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:01,658
on the product, on the lines.

42
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,921
Imagine a very noisy environment with a very heavy machine,

43
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:10,343
50 tons press, spitting out 1,000 products a minute,

44
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:10,823
for example.

45
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:13,185
Like the can, the beer can, you can see.

46
00:02:13,705 --> 00:02:14,285
1,000 cans a minute.

47
00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:21,068
Every time I had to stop the line, I had to justify the loss of production of 1,000 cans

48
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:21,548
per minute.

49
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:28,990
Every time I wanted to change the process, I had, in some cases, to justify the movement,

50
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,811
the relocation of a 50-ton press.

51
00:02:33,191 --> 00:02:36,912
There was a lot of thinking being done before all those happened.

52
00:02:37,232 --> 00:02:40,253
There was a lot of soul-searching, being very honest.

53
00:02:40,413 --> 00:02:41,414
What are we looking for?

54
00:02:41,654 --> 00:02:44,195
What are we trying to achieve?

55
00:02:45,295 --> 00:02:48,297
And I had to justify it out loud to a lot of people

56
00:02:48,357 --> 00:02:49,398
before it will happen.

57
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,881
We can all take that to the game industry today.

58
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:57,703
How are we trying to define what does good look like whenever

59
00:02:57,763 --> 00:02:59,845
we do an improvement, whenever we change a process?

60
00:03:02,288 --> 00:03:04,690
Then I moved to Finland, and I moved to the game industry.

61
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,792
I worked for a company like Digital Chocolate.

62
00:03:08,353 --> 00:03:10,715
Then I worked for a startup doing interactive images,

63
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:12,696
but with a software as a service mentality.

64
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:16,739
And I opened a Gameloft studio in Helsinki for a year.

65
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,021
And I've been working at Rovio for three years now.

66
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:25,386
About Rovio, just to get a little wrap up

67
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:28,489
about who we are, Rovio was founded in 2003

68
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:29,049
by three students.

69
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:35,491
In 2009, we had 51 games under our belt,

70
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:37,492
and the 52nd was Angry Birds.

71
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:41,273
I think we all know Angry Birds and the success that it has had.

72
00:03:43,173 --> 00:03:45,634
A big milestone for us and for the industry, I think,

73
00:03:45,814 --> 00:03:48,295
is 2016, when we launched the Angry Birds movie.

74
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:51,175
Went number one in more than 50 countries,

75
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,516
making $350 million revenue.

76
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:57,937
A big success for Rovio, a big success for the industry,

77
00:03:57,977 --> 00:04:00,618
showing that we are providing entertainment.

78
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:07,030
Very recently, in 2017, Rovio went through IPO.

79
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:10,794
And the next milestone that we can see in the future,

80
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:13,937
for sure, is that in 2019, we are

81
00:04:13,957 --> 00:04:15,158
going to have a movie sequel.

82
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,601
Hopefully, before that, we will create

83
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:18,822
all the milestones for the company

84
00:04:18,862 --> 00:04:19,783
and for the game industry.

85
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:24,207
Rovio is around 400 people.

86
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,528
300 working on games and 100 on other activities.

87
00:04:30,508 --> 00:04:33,889
The Angry Birds brand was downloaded more than 4 billion

88
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,070
times, which we are very, very proud of that.

89
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:40,712
The way we are organized in the game business unit

90
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,513
is we are divided in four studios in two locations.

91
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:45,493
One will be Helsinki, Finland.

92
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,894
The other one will be Stockholm in Sweden.

93
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:52,025
We are divided by specialty, by genre.

94
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:55,729
So a studio will focus on the slingshot mechanism

95
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,812
that we can see in Angry Birds, and with the Angry Birds

96
00:04:58,892 --> 00:05:02,535
brand, mixing the two and trying to make a making

97
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:03,797
game for this genre.

98
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,639
Another one, Battle, we call Battle,

99
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,181
is located in Helsinki, Finland.

100
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:11,464
It's focusing on team versus team, real-time team

101
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:12,525
versus team battles.

102
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:17,642
The next studio is a puzzle doing match three,

103
00:05:17,782 --> 00:05:21,164
tap to clear, bubble popper based in Helsinki.

104
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:24,446
And the last one, the RPG studio, is based in Stockholm.

105
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:27,087
So as you can see, we are divided by specialty

106
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:27,767
and by genre.

107
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,589
Doesn't mean that there's no crossover between the studios,

108
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:33,390
but this is how we are divided.

109
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,133
So let's talk about making games.

110
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:42,035
And I'm starting in 2015.

111
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:47,829
One reason is because I started at Rovio in 2015.

112
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,192
But the real reason I'm starting my presentation on that date

113
00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:54,313
is this is the first time at Rovio

114
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:58,056
we started to ask us questions like,

115
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:03,760
how can we have a process that helps us to make great games?

116
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,823
How can we have a process that helps us to make great games

117
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:08,823
consistently?

118
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,621
And for me, that was a beginning of us thinking

119
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:15,322
of having a better process, having a process that

120
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:19,044
would be very modern, that will allow us to do great games.

121
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:23,665
If you think about it, process, great game,

122
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:24,626
in the same sentence.

123
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:26,046
Process is usually dull.

124
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:26,926
It's logistical.

125
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,167
It's operation.

126
00:06:28,247 --> 00:06:29,287
It's not super creative.

127
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,288
It's a bit boring.

128
00:06:31,147 --> 00:06:33,228
Great game, we are all here to make great games.

129
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:36,529
It's very creative, it's visual, it's fun, it's cool.

130
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:40,511
But we have those two opposite in the same sentence.

131
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:44,153
But for us, that was it.

132
00:06:44,593 --> 00:06:47,494
We wanted a process that would help us to make

133
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:49,475
great games consistently.

134
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:56,298
So let's look at how Rovio was organized in 2015.

135
00:06:56,858 --> 00:06:57,879
Well, we had a process.

136
00:06:58,039 --> 00:06:59,500
We had a production process in 2015.

137
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,196
I mean, if we think about it, in terms of headcount,

138
00:07:04,516 --> 00:07:06,958
Rovio was the biggest and is still the biggest

139
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:07,978
studio in Finland.

140
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:10,360
Biggest headcount studio in Finland.

141
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,362
We had and we still have around 15, 20 projects

142
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:15,863
going on at the same time.

143
00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:18,925
And if we want to have any sort of strategy,

144
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:21,267
if you want to have any sort of management about where we're

145
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:22,527
going, we need a process.

146
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:26,430
So yes, in 2015, we had a process.

147
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:30,713
But I put the tick box here.

148
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,439
Because did we check that the prototype we were doing

149
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:33,920
were fun?

150
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,680
Yeah, we did.

151
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,361
We always do.

152
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:37,683
You do a game jam, they get a great prototype.

153
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:38,243
Is it fun?

154
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:38,483
Yes.

155
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:39,984
Should we go to production?

156
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:40,525
Yes, maybe.

157
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:43,307
There was a lot of mechanical things we were checking.

158
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:45,248
Do you have a date for launch?

159
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:45,508
Yes.

160
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:46,469
Done.

161
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,372
Now, did we talk about business case?

162
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:53,134
Did we talk about the market?

163
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:56,217
Did we talk about target audience?

164
00:07:56,957 --> 00:07:57,377
Maybe not.

165
00:07:58,018 --> 00:07:59,359
Maybe not the way we do today.

166
00:08:00,905 --> 00:08:03,807
Did we talk about what are the motivations of our target audience?

167
00:08:04,187 --> 00:08:06,048
No, we did not talk about that in 2015.

168
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:11,171
So yes, we had a process, but it was a very,

169
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,372
I'd say tick box is a good example.

170
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,093
It's a very tick box type of process.

171
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:19,456
So let's look at what kind of games were launched

172
00:08:19,956 --> 00:08:21,277
following this process.

173
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:25,420
The one on the left is Angry Birds 2.

174
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:28,212
was launched in 2015.

175
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:33,095
Today, Angry Birds 2 is our biggest game by far.

176
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:34,295
A huge success.

177
00:08:34,476 --> 00:08:35,456
Amazing KPIs.

178
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:40,399
When it was launched in 2015, it was the foundation

179
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:41,619
of this big success.

180
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,320
It was LiveOps compliant.

181
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,181
It was a full-fledged game.

182
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:49,583
It had depth, allowed campaigns, events, sales, et cetera.

183
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:52,585
A great game for free to play.

184
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:58,082
Now who knows about the other game?

185
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:00,063
Bats.

186
00:09:01,164 --> 00:09:03,405
We launched Bats, soft launch, in 2015.

187
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:08,268
Great game, very, very fun, but impossible to monetize,

188
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:10,489
meaning premium game.

189
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,691
Give us $1, we'll give you the game.

190
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:15,132
So in them.

191
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:18,412
I mean, there was nothing else than just a fun game.

192
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,693
There was no possibility to make business with this game.

193
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:22,894
So in terms of deliveries, we could

194
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:25,476
see that there was a lot of variation

195
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:28,757
in the quality, in the overall quality of the game

196
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,618
that we were delivering using this process.

197
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,920
So we knew we had an issue with our process.

198
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,982
The process was not delivering a consistent great game,

199
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,843
or great game consistently.

200
00:09:43,685 --> 00:09:44,805
So we started to work.

201
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:53,737
And we try to understand, is the process in place helping

202
00:09:53,838 --> 00:09:54,818
us to make great games?

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,841
A good place to start is to go to the coffee machine

204
00:09:57,861 --> 00:09:59,603
because you get a lot of people going in and out.

205
00:09:59,663 --> 00:10:00,704
And we start to ask questions.

206
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:06,689
And we ask the central management a few questions.

207
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:09,071
And some of the feedback we had is, hey,

208
00:10:09,772 --> 00:10:10,573
how is this game doing?

209
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:14,030
What does it mean if the central management asking me

210
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:15,492
how a game is doing?

211
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,814
They have no visibility of what is happening?

212
00:10:18,054 --> 00:10:20,257
They have no visibility on the build that is available?

213
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:23,580
They have no visibility of what the team is trying to achieve?

214
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:24,701
Maybe yes.

215
00:10:25,642 --> 00:10:28,485
We heard other things like, what is the target

216
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:29,306
audience for this game?

217
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:36,142
You have to understand that when we launched Angry Birds in 2009, it was such a success

218
00:10:36,222 --> 00:10:38,024
that we took it.

219
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,025
We didn't question it.

220
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:44,270
The reality is the target, the audience that we got in 2009 was a very young audience,

221
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:44,991
you can imagine.

222
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,834
A very young audience that grew with Rovio.

223
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:49,795
But in 2015...

224
00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:54,149
I'm not sure we were not sure that this audience was

225
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:55,970
the audience we wanted for our new games.

226
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:59,012
So we had to question ourselves, do we

227
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:00,974
want the same audience that we currently have?

228
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:05,517
Or do we need to target another audience?

229
00:11:06,757 --> 00:11:08,639
So the question of which audience

230
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,200
are we making this game for is starting

231
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,401
to be very important for us.

232
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:14,303
And yet again, the central management

233
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:17,205
will ask the question, who are we making this game for?

234
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:19,126
No visibility.

235
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:23,307
The example of Angry Birds 2 and bats.

236
00:11:23,788 --> 00:11:25,510
Will this game monetize as free to play?

237
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,113
Clearly, we got a scar from this release.

238
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:33,838
We want to make sure that every single game we're

239
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:35,140
going to launch from now is going

240
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,761
to be a great free to play game.

241
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:38,805
So how are we doing that?

242
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,046
How are we doing the design?

243
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:42,668
What kind of visibility do I have as a central manager

244
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:43,388
on that?

245
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:45,710
At the end of the day, you understand it.

246
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:47,992
It was really about the central management saying,

247
00:11:48,052 --> 00:11:50,574
you know what, the process we have in place

248
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:53,877
is not really helping me to take the right decision

249
00:11:54,157 --> 00:11:56,079
to drive the strategy and to build

250
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:57,320
a vision for the company.

251
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,101
So the process we had in place in 2015.

252
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:05,620
exist, which was great, but was not really helping the central management.

253
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,265
I stayed at the coffee machine and I carried on talking to people coming here.

254
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:11,829
And the next people coming were from the game development team.

255
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,833
And they started to tell me things, very scary, like...

256
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,381
You know what, I've got this game,

257
00:12:18,702 --> 00:12:21,404
but I'm not going to show it to you or to anyone

258
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:22,285
because it's not ready.

259
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:24,107
And you know what's happening when you show a game that

260
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:24,647
is not ready.

261
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:27,490
I will receive email of, you should do this,

262
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,212
you should do that, long like that.

263
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:31,954
So I'm going to hide my work in progress.

264
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:35,958
We all know that this lack of transparency is not the answer.

265
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:40,663
But still, that was how the game were operating, in a way.

266
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:45,269
The other one, which is horrible, is like, hey,

267
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,452
I've got this meeting invitation in my calendar.

268
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:49,154
I have no idea what it is.

269
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:50,736
Are they going to kill my game?

270
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:53,279
No discussion, no visibility.

271
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,445
The fear of going to a meeting that is imposed by the process,

272
00:12:57,805 --> 00:13:00,248
the fear of having your own game killed.

273
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:01,430
That was pretty bad.

274
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:07,693
And then coming to soft launch with no real idea

275
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:11,855
if the game was going to perform or not, really crossing finger

276
00:13:11,935 --> 00:13:15,077
and just say, let's launch this game just in case of.

277
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:16,377
Maybe it will work, maybe it will not.

278
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:20,519
I have no idea from a real user before soft launch about,

279
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,701
is this game answering anybody's needs, anybody's motivation?

280
00:13:25,682 --> 00:13:26,902
And at the end of the day, again,

281
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:29,664
the process we had in place didn't really

282
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:31,705
help the development team.

283
00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:36,594
So we had a process in place, yes, but it didn't really help.

284
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,596
And at the end of the day, you understand

285
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:43,019
that what it meant is that the games team had some sort of fear

286
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:46,061
about the process, and that the central management didn't

287
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:47,822
really respect any of the process,

288
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:52,305
and try to intervene, try to micromanage the team.

289
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:53,546
That's what it was.

290
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:58,269
Of course, I'm painting a picture to make a case here.

291
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:01,832
It was not as bad as that, but you get the feeling.

292
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,780
So we looked, and we say, what do we do?

293
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,201
We saw three opportunities, three opportunities

294
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:15,503
that will allow us to make better games,

295
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:17,683
to have a process that will help us to make better games.

296
00:14:19,544 --> 00:14:22,445
The first one is, what about us focusing

297
00:14:23,305 --> 00:14:26,166
on the vision and the strategy for each game?

298
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:26,926
No exception.

299
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:29,607
Each game that we are making should have a clear vision

300
00:14:29,907 --> 00:14:30,727
what we want to build.

301
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:34,336
and a clear strategy, how we're going to build,

302
00:14:35,117 --> 00:14:37,461
why we're going to build it, when we're

303
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:38,683
going to build it, et cetera.

304
00:14:40,305 --> 00:14:41,287
That will help us a lot.

305
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,951
That was a clear opportunity we saw.

306
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:44,933
The other one was.

307
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,212
Improved transparency.

308
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:49,813
It was clear from my example that the transparency

309
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:50,714
was not great.

310
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:52,574
And I'm not necessarily discussing

311
00:14:52,634 --> 00:14:55,276
about the game team showing the central management what

312
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:55,796
they are doing.

313
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,377
I'm saying the central management giving

314
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,598
a clear visibility on the strategy on what

315
00:15:00,618 --> 00:15:01,478
we're trying to achieve.

316
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:06,429
having the process so visible that it's very transparent

317
00:15:06,469 --> 00:15:08,890
about how we're going to run the process in the future,

318
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,931
how we're going to run game production in the future.

319
00:15:11,372 --> 00:15:14,334
So it's transparency all over the organization,

320
00:15:14,494 --> 00:15:17,436
not just showing the build to the management.

321
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:21,578
And the third one is restore autonomy.

322
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,261
You know, the team that did Angry Birds 2 and Bats,

323
00:15:26,421 --> 00:15:29,123
they were strong autonomous team, all of them,

324
00:15:29,343 --> 00:15:29,883
the two of them.

325
00:15:31,552 --> 00:15:34,934
But the autonomy they had was a fake economy.

326
00:15:34,974 --> 00:15:36,936
Because at the end of the day, because of the lack of

327
00:15:36,976 --> 00:15:40,919
transparency, a lot of people were telling them what to do.

328
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,501
Where, hey, I don't know what's happening, so show me

329
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,362
something, and when I see something, I'll

330
00:15:45,423 --> 00:15:46,083
tell you what to do.

331
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:51,227
So it was not a true autonomy that we had in place back

332
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:51,347
then.

333
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:57,831
Out of the three opportunities, by far, and I mean by far,

334
00:15:58,211 --> 00:16:00,272
we said if we focus on the last two,

335
00:16:00,912 --> 00:16:04,534
on the improve the transparency and restore the autonomy,

336
00:16:05,474 --> 00:16:07,495
we have the better chance to succeed.

337
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:08,435
And why?

338
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:11,857
Because the assumption, and we were convinced about that,

339
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:15,478
that by focusing on those two points, we will build trust.

340
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:18,460
We will build trust in the organization.

341
00:16:19,294 --> 00:16:22,115
And again, it's not about one trusting the other.

342
00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:23,756
It's about looking at the process,

343
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:26,658
the central management, and the development team

344
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:28,338
all trusting each other.

345
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:32,560
The central management and the development team

346
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,141
trusting that the process in place is good for them,

347
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:35,882
can help them.

348
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:38,023
Central management trusting the team,

349
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,384
and the team trusting that the central management will not

350
00:16:41,024 --> 00:16:42,245
intervene or micromanage.

351
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:44,686
That was the assumption back then.

352
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:50,664
So we worked in 2016 in Flight Path.

353
00:16:51,925 --> 00:16:54,726
This is a name we gave to our production process.

354
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:58,589
And I'm saying process here, and I'm writing guideline here.

355
00:16:58,709 --> 00:16:59,809
We're going to see about that.

356
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:03,166
But Flypath is a guideline.

357
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:07,928
It's explaining what to do, but not how to do.

358
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:10,728
There's no secret recipe to how to make a great game.

359
00:17:11,248 --> 00:17:12,209
So we acknowledge that.

360
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,249
It is a guideline.

361
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:17,690
It started in 2016, and I'm going to tell you,

362
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,310
it's still working today.

363
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,771
It's still called Flypath, and we're still working on it.

364
00:17:21,811 --> 00:17:22,571
We still improve it.

365
00:17:23,191 --> 00:17:25,732
How many of our project here started one day

366
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:27,792
and was canceled three months later?

367
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:29,913
This one is more than two years old.

368
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:32,795
and it's still alive and kicking.

369
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:34,417
And I'm very, very proud of that.

370
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:36,901
Every time we improve our process,

371
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:38,683
it's a continuation of FlyPath.

372
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:40,365
So when you hear me saying FlyPath,

373
00:17:40,505 --> 00:17:42,628
this is what I mean, our production process.

374
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:46,939
And Flypass is a story of trust.

375
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,120
You have to understand that.

376
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,201
We have to understand that.

377
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:50,362
It's all about trust.

378
00:17:50,742 --> 00:17:52,104
It's the trust that we build,

379
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:55,347
and where autonomy and transparency

380
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:56,888
are playing a leading role.

381
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:59,571
We build trust through transparency and autonomy.

382
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:01,473
And this is what I'm going to try to explain

383
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,574
during the next few slides.

384
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,831
So let's look at Flypath.

385
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:06,432
It's no rocket science.

386
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:07,793
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

387
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,155
There's no secret, amazing stuff.

388
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:13,337
It starts with concept like any other process,

389
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:17,060
and it will end up in global launch slash live operations.

390
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:18,821
Very simple.

391
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:20,722
We didn't reinvent the wheel.

392
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:25,506
There are a few principles.

393
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:26,747
I'm going to drink.

394
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:30,730
The first one.

395
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:33,112
is ownership.

396
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:35,933
So my title at Rovio today is VP of Operations.

397
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:41,034
I would say I'm a good candidate to be the owner of Flypath.

398
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:44,735
VP of Operations, operations, process, process Flypath.

399
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:47,036
I would be a very, very good candidate

400
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:48,096
to be the owner of Flypath.

401
00:18:48,156 --> 00:18:48,636
But I'm not.

402
00:18:49,316 --> 00:18:50,716
I am not the owner of Flypath.

403
00:18:52,837 --> 00:18:55,017
At Rovio, we have a group called the Production Guild.

404
00:18:55,618 --> 00:18:58,178
The Production Guild is a group of people, producers,

405
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:02,019
operation people, like user research, quality.

406
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:06,493
delivery, player support, and anybody who wants to opt in.

407
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:09,536
Anybody, product lead, management, finance,

408
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:13,459
anybody who wants to have a say in how we run operations,

409
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:16,582
how we run production in Rovio.

410
00:19:17,062 --> 00:19:19,905
We meet every two weeks, and we discuss about production.

411
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:22,968
And whenever Flypass has to change, be evolved,

412
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:25,330
or be modified, we discuss about it,

413
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,691
and we take a decision together.

414
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,953
Making we're not coming with ideas that we will present to management

415
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:40,079
we take decision on how we're going to run the operations how we're going to run the production and

416
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:43,422
This is the production deal is the owner of flight path

417
00:19:44,523 --> 00:19:50,628
So we are owning the way we operate and there's no VP telling anybody how to operate

418
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:55,334
The second one is flexibility.

419
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,916
Asset guideline is very important.

420
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:57,857
It is a guideline.

421
00:19:57,877 --> 00:20:01,862
It's about what to focus on, not how to make great games.

422
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:06,728
There's a little bit of the idea of the battlefield.

423
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:08,510
Soldiers are very, very well trained.

424
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:10,613
They know all their gears.

425
00:20:10,813 --> 00:20:11,914
They know all the procedure.

426
00:20:11,954 --> 00:20:13,216
But when they're in the battlefield,

427
00:20:14,758 --> 00:20:17,039
There's no book that describes how to win a battle.

428
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:18,359
It's the same for us.

429
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,840
We need to be highly skilled individuals and teams,

430
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:23,161
professionals.

431
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,802
But when it's about making games, there's no process.

432
00:20:25,822 --> 00:20:28,402
There's no fly pass who will tell us how to make great games.

433
00:20:28,883 --> 00:20:30,183
So we have to be flexible.

434
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,444
One of the reasons is not everybody

435
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,524
has got the same maturity.

436
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:36,165
So a young team or a young product lead

437
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:37,905
will need maybe a little bit more guidance

438
00:20:39,065 --> 00:20:40,586
than somebody more mature.

439
00:20:41,903 --> 00:20:43,603
The other one is if we're too flexible,

440
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:46,224
the process of today will be the process of tomorrow.

441
00:20:47,385 --> 00:20:51,886
But if we are flexible, then maybe a more mature team

442
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:54,967
will decide not to follow FlyPath, which is absolutely

443
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,088
OK if we are transparent about it, if we are open about it,

444
00:20:58,148 --> 00:20:59,349
if we are discussing about it.

445
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:03,790
Because today's experiment might become tomorrow's FlyPath.

446
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,591
We might drive improvement through not

447
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:07,411
following the process.

448
00:21:08,413 --> 00:21:09,914
And this is a very interesting one.

449
00:21:10,274 --> 00:21:11,655
But if we have a tick-box process,

450
00:21:11,695 --> 00:21:12,896
then everybody does the same.

451
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:16,097
Everybody gets frustrated, and we're not running improvement.

452
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:21,800
Trust.

453
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:23,781
The third one is trust.

454
00:21:25,222 --> 00:21:26,863
I said it, and I'm going to repeat it here,

455
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:27,863
because it is important.

456
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:31,505
It's about trust between the process,

457
00:21:31,645 --> 00:21:33,066
the central management, and the teams.

458
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,614
We all acknowledge that Flypath exists,

459
00:21:36,874 --> 00:21:41,057
and we are going to go through Flypath when we do production.

460
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,801
Central management acknowledges there's Flypath.

461
00:21:47,961 --> 00:21:50,683
There's no need to do micro-management,

462
00:21:50,763 --> 00:21:52,524
because I should get the visibility.

463
00:21:53,824 --> 00:21:55,285
The team acknowledges there's Flypath.

464
00:21:55,405 --> 00:21:57,447
I know what this meeting is coming in two weeks.

465
00:21:57,767 --> 00:21:59,728
I know what I'm supposed to discuss

466
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,029
with the rest of the team.

467
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:04,076
Now, is it perfect?

468
00:22:04,736 --> 00:22:06,637
Well, it's not bad.

469
00:22:07,437 --> 00:22:09,558
Is there a tension here?

470
00:22:10,358 --> 00:22:12,198
Is the team always wanting more autonomy?

471
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:15,279
And the central management always wanted to micromanage?

472
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,220
Yes, it exists.

473
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,900
But we acknowledge this tension.

474
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:18,881
And it's fine.

475
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:23,522
So we have trust also that this tension is healthy for us.

476
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,683
team asking for more autonomy, and central management

477
00:22:28,124 --> 00:22:30,406
trying to put their nose into the project.

478
00:22:30,446 --> 00:22:30,946
But that's fine.

479
00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:32,247
So we acknowledge that.

480
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:35,190
We've done with the principle.

481
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,291
We can look at the different phases.

482
00:22:37,352 --> 00:22:39,073
We'll go one by one in the next few slides.

483
00:22:40,574 --> 00:22:42,136
Fly plus is the five phase.

484
00:22:43,774 --> 00:22:46,975
And then we have a quarterly studio level review.

485
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:49,995
It means every three months, we know that the studio head,

486
00:22:50,255 --> 00:22:51,916
remember I mentioned we have four studios,

487
00:22:52,376 --> 00:22:54,416
so the studio heads and the product lead

488
00:22:54,496 --> 00:22:55,836
will meet the central management.

489
00:22:56,557 --> 00:22:59,737
And we will be discussing about the games.

490
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:02,158
We are going to discuss about the product, the game

491
00:23:02,198 --> 00:23:02,738
we are making.

492
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:07,339
Flypast got three green lights, no more.

493
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:08,739
We had more.

494
00:23:09,282 --> 00:23:09,802
It changed.

495
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,563
We have a production green light, a soft launch green

496
00:23:12,603 --> 00:23:14,483
light, and a global launch green light.

497
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:15,064
That's it.

498
00:23:15,624 --> 00:23:18,745
So FlyPath, the way we handle production at Rovio,

499
00:23:19,705 --> 00:23:23,666
is five phases, one quarterly review, and five gates.

500
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:32,589
The first one, the first one of the phase,

501
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,210
is a mix of three things.

502
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:36,811
Concepting.

503
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,131
market research, and prototype.

504
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:44,293
It all starts with acknowledging the fact

505
00:23:44,313 --> 00:23:47,435
that a fun prototype is not enough to justify 12, 18,

506
00:23:48,676 --> 00:23:49,917
or 24 months of production.

507
00:23:52,318 --> 00:23:53,899
We need more than that.

508
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,661
We need more than a fun prototype.

509
00:23:56,341 --> 00:23:59,443
So concept is all about building a vision,

510
00:23:59,963 --> 00:24:02,025
a team building together a vision,

511
00:24:02,105 --> 00:24:05,167
and a product lead holding the vision forward,

512
00:24:05,447 --> 00:24:06,608
taking the vision forward.

513
00:24:07,498 --> 00:24:08,879
But we need time to build this vision.

514
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,040
Research.

515
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,462
We can't launch a game without understanding the competition,

516
00:24:14,522 --> 00:24:15,963
without understanding what is going

517
00:24:15,983 --> 00:24:18,405
to happen in 18 months or 24 months when we launch,

518
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:21,987
without understanding the users, the target audience

519
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,868
that we are making the game for.

520
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:27,470
And of course, we have a prototype.

521
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,831
So yes, we build a prototype.

522
00:24:28,871 --> 00:24:30,732
And we have a lot of fun with it, absolutely.

523
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:32,493
But it's all together.

524
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,633
When we do research, we have one say in our head.

525
00:24:36,653 --> 00:24:38,355
It's like, it's never too early to test.

526
00:24:38,695 --> 00:24:41,337
It's never too early to have feedback from real users.

527
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:46,062
So as soon as we can put something,

528
00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:47,904
it could be a sentence, it could be a graphic,

529
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:49,546
it can be a mock-up, it can be a prototype.

530
00:24:49,606 --> 00:24:51,568
As soon as we can do that, we can

531
00:24:51,608 --> 00:24:54,290
put that in front of a real user to get feedback, we do it.

532
00:24:55,712 --> 00:24:58,114
It's a lot of effort, but we try to do it as soon as possible.

533
00:25:03,547 --> 00:25:04,607
So we build this vision.

534
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:07,108
This is a concept phase.

535
00:25:08,568 --> 00:25:13,129
Once we have this vision built, once we know where we're going,

536
00:25:13,829 --> 00:25:15,730
once the team has built the vision together

537
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,071
and the product team owns this vision,

538
00:25:19,111 --> 00:25:21,092
we are moving to pre-production.

539
00:25:22,032 --> 00:25:24,312
And pre-production is not about building the vision

540
00:25:24,352 --> 00:25:25,393
because it's already done.

541
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,003
Pre-production is about to figure out if we can deliver

542
00:25:30,023 --> 00:25:31,044
this great vision.

543
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:31,964
Can we build it?

544
00:25:31,984 --> 00:25:32,465
Yes, we can.

545
00:25:33,286 --> 00:25:35,747
So it's all, of course, we're going to stay agile here.

546
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,249
I'm not saying we're going to.

547
00:25:38,297 --> 00:25:41,260
freeze the vision and never change it for 24 months?

548
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:41,720
Of course not.

549
00:25:42,281 --> 00:25:45,864
Of course we're going to iterate it as all the signals coming

550
00:25:45,884 --> 00:25:47,345
from outside.

551
00:25:48,186 --> 00:25:50,288
But at this point, it's not about building the vision

552
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:51,028
anymore.

553
00:25:51,188 --> 00:25:53,851
It's about figuring out, do we have the right tools?

554
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:55,332
Do we have the right process?

555
00:25:55,352 --> 00:25:58,635
Do we have the right people, knowledge, skills, et cetera?

556
00:25:58,755 --> 00:26:00,696
Time, money, all this.

557
00:26:00,736 --> 00:26:02,918
Do we have all this so we can deliver that game?

558
00:26:05,332 --> 00:26:08,314
So we are going to look at what we know.

559
00:26:08,494 --> 00:26:09,695
Maybe we don't need to test that.

560
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,356
What we don't know, what we have been in,

561
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,217
what is very innovative.

562
00:26:13,757 --> 00:26:15,738
Usually, this is what we are going to test,

563
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:19,600
either to build or test in a prototype,

564
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,541
I mean in a final build.

565
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:27,545
And we look at the most risky aspect of our vision,

566
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:28,846
of our game we are trying to build,

567
00:26:28,906 --> 00:26:32,147
and we try to leverage this risk during pre-production.

568
00:26:32,908 --> 00:26:34,689
Remember my past in factories?

569
00:26:35,957 --> 00:26:38,720
Before setting up a line that will spit out

570
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:41,602
1,000 cans per minute, trust me, we

571
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,164
were aligning all the machines.

572
00:26:43,204 --> 00:26:44,565
We were running very slowly.

573
00:26:44,585 --> 00:26:46,567
We were making sure we had all the machine we need,

574
00:26:46,927 --> 00:26:49,470
and all the operator we need, and all the raw material

575
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:49,810
we need.

576
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,291
It's the same.

577
00:26:51,672 --> 00:26:53,173
Different worlds, but it's the same spirit.

578
00:26:53,673 --> 00:26:54,514
We run slowly.

579
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:58,057
We evaluate what it takes to be able to run fast.

580
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:01,180
We adjust, and then we go to production.

581
00:27:04,591 --> 00:27:07,433
During all this time, we meet every three months.

582
00:27:09,654 --> 00:27:13,557
We call it the quarterly review, quarterly studio-level review.

583
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:15,538
So it's one per studio, four studios.

584
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:20,701
And again, it's not all about everybody accepting that, yes,

585
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:21,942
we will meet every three months, and we

586
00:27:21,982 --> 00:27:23,543
will talk about the games.

587
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,664
So there's no surprise.

588
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,605
So when we come to this meeting, we

589
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,967
know what the template of discussion we're going to have.

590
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:30,988
And it's a very open meeting.

591
00:27:31,979 --> 00:27:34,421
I'm not saying that the visibility, the transparency,

592
00:27:34,561 --> 00:27:35,942
is only built in this meeting.

593
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:37,342
There is a lot of discussion.

594
00:27:37,663 --> 00:27:39,464
There's a lot of work in progress available,

595
00:27:39,764 --> 00:27:40,785
so we can play the game.

596
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:44,887
But here is kind of the formal way when we all sit down.

597
00:27:45,027 --> 00:27:47,069
And finance is also here, because we're

598
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:50,191
going to talk about money, about headcount, et cetera.

599
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:53,172
Marketing is here to figure out how

600
00:27:53,192 --> 00:27:54,994
we're going to launch the game, et cetera, et cetera.

601
00:27:55,034 --> 00:27:57,095
So a lot of different functions are in this meeting.

602
00:27:57,515 --> 00:27:59,577
But it's a great way of giving transparency

603
00:27:59,617 --> 00:28:00,537
within the organization.

604
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,891
Then comes the production green light.

605
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:09,176
And it's all about, well, we need

606
00:28:09,196 --> 00:28:10,677
to figure out what the plan.

607
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:12,159
So there was a lot of things happening,

608
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:13,240
a lot of transparency.

609
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:16,303
We've built the vision.

610
00:28:16,423 --> 00:28:18,645
And we saw during pre-production that, yes, we

611
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:19,466
can build the vision.

612
00:28:19,526 --> 00:28:23,871
But let's sit all together one more time before we go and

613
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:27,094
invest 12 or 18 months of the company's time.

614
00:28:29,932 --> 00:28:32,793
And we discussed very early about launch plan.

615
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:35,235
So we talk about marketing already at this point.

616
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:41,678
I took an example here on this slide about Angry Birds March.

617
00:28:41,918 --> 00:28:42,819
It's an interesting one.

618
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,521
In 2016, the first production green light

619
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:51,524
that we run internally was for green lighting Angry Birds

620
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:51,824
March.

621
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:53,505
Are we going to production or not?

622
00:28:54,205 --> 00:28:55,506
And we discussed about everything.

623
00:28:55,626 --> 00:28:56,947
We discussed about Scrum.

624
00:28:57,087 --> 00:28:58,047
We discussed about.

625
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:04,093
timeline about headcount, about tools and servers,

626
00:29:04,213 --> 00:29:06,054
and how we're going to use AWS, et cetera.

627
00:29:06,594 --> 00:29:07,194
It went well.

628
00:29:07,314 --> 00:29:07,835
It went fine.

629
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:08,335
I was happy.

630
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:09,416
It was the first time we had it.

631
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,336
It was a bit of a test.

632
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,117
And yes, we have green light.

633
00:29:12,157 --> 00:29:16,760
We agreed together that we're going to do it.

634
00:29:18,781 --> 00:29:21,942
And then the product leads comes to me at the end and says,

635
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:22,983
what happened there?

636
00:29:23,023 --> 00:29:23,783
What do you mean?

637
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:24,824
Well, you know what?

638
00:29:26,023 --> 00:29:28,765
This Angry Birds Match is my fourth match three game

639
00:29:28,845 --> 00:29:29,845
I'm doing with that team.

640
00:29:31,346 --> 00:29:33,767
I've done three games that were all super successful,

641
00:29:33,907 --> 00:29:35,847
each one more successful than the previous one.

642
00:29:36,248 --> 00:29:37,788
Do you know what is my biggest asset

643
00:29:37,908 --> 00:29:40,629
to make a great success out of Angry Birds Match?

644
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:42,010
I don't know, you tell me.

645
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:42,750
Well, my team.

646
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,551
We've been working together, same team, four times.

647
00:29:45,571 --> 00:29:46,852
This is our fourth title.

648
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:51,374
If I'm going to succeed in this project, it's because of my

649
00:29:51,434 --> 00:29:53,715
team, and at no point we reviewed the team.

650
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,910
And I say, well, that's a very good point.

651
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,171
So what do we do?

652
00:29:58,511 --> 00:30:00,431
We are both part of the production guild.

653
00:30:00,471 --> 00:30:02,812
We are responsible to make FlightPaths evolve.

654
00:30:03,152 --> 00:30:04,252
And we change FlightPaths.

655
00:30:04,413 --> 00:30:06,833
Today, and even though it's not perfect yet,

656
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:10,354
but today we are evaluating the team whenever

657
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:11,595
we are evaluating production.

658
00:30:13,014 --> 00:30:13,715
That's very important.

659
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:15,536
Another point that is interesting

660
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:18,018
is that when the product leads come to this Greenlight

661
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:21,460
meeting, it doesn't come in front of the central management

662
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,042
to ask permission to move into production.

663
00:30:25,663 --> 00:30:26,463
You've seen my build.

664
00:30:26,603 --> 00:30:27,584
You've seen my strategy.

665
00:30:27,624 --> 00:30:28,685
We met every three months.

666
00:30:29,205 --> 00:30:30,266
We went through pre-production.

667
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,106
You got the result.

668
00:30:31,647 --> 00:30:32,447
I've got a plan.

669
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:33,688
You know my plan.

670
00:30:34,048 --> 00:30:36,890
And starting tomorrow, I'm going to start production.

671
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,191
I'm not asking you if I can.

672
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:39,411
But by the way, we have one hour.

673
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:41,833
So if you have any tricky question, maybe it's the time.

674
00:30:41,893 --> 00:30:43,554
Because tomorrow, I'm moving into production.

675
00:30:44,194 --> 00:30:47,216
So again, it's not about asking.

676
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:48,977
We already know that we're good.

677
00:30:49,077 --> 00:30:50,978
And that gives a lot of responsibility

678
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:54,500
to the product lead to basically stop a game,

679
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,562
kill a game before this meeting.

680
00:30:56,862 --> 00:30:58,783
We're not, product lead are not coming to this meeting

681
00:30:58,843 --> 00:31:00,564
to hear anybody killing their game.

682
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,301
So we need to be true to ourselves and our understanding.

683
00:31:04,341 --> 00:31:05,142
What is the strategy?

684
00:31:05,162 --> 00:31:06,242
What we're trying to achieve?

685
00:31:06,422 --> 00:31:08,143
And if we are all on the same page

686
00:31:08,183 --> 00:31:09,384
whenever we come to this meeting.

687
00:31:12,426 --> 00:31:12,866
Production.

688
00:31:12,886 --> 00:31:13,846
We all know about production.

689
00:31:13,986 --> 00:31:15,887
Last 12, 18, sometimes three years.

690
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,629
Oh, sorry, 12 months, 18 months, sometimes three years.

691
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:20,970
It's all about being agile.

692
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,390
I said it.

693
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,671
We don't want to be waterfall.

694
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:26,633
We have to adapt to the market, to all the external signals.

695
00:31:26,973 --> 00:31:29,594
We will do a lot of user testing during this phase.

696
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,164
It means that we will receive a lot of feedback from real users.

697
00:31:33,204 --> 00:31:34,004
We have to adapt.

698
00:31:35,285 --> 00:31:37,447
But if we have to make 180 degree turn,

699
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:39,628
then maybe we should pause and think again.

700
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,330
But it's all about being agile, not being waterfall.

701
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,701
As I said, we do a lot of user testing.

702
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:47,081
This is something we're putting a lot of effort at Rovio

703
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:50,982
during the last 12 months to really understand

704
00:31:51,022 --> 00:31:53,182
what are the tools, what tools are available for us

705
00:31:53,222 --> 00:31:56,703
to test some aspect of the game.

706
00:31:56,803 --> 00:31:58,724
Or whenever we have a question about the design,

707
00:31:59,204 --> 00:32:01,064
depending on the question, how can we

708
00:32:01,084 --> 00:32:04,485
get real user giving us hints about, yes,

709
00:32:04,845 --> 00:32:06,845
your vision seems to be answering my needs,

710
00:32:07,105 --> 00:32:08,966
or no, I'm going to put a bit of friction.

711
00:32:09,326 --> 00:32:11,666
Are you sure this is what you want to deliver to target

712
00:32:11,726 --> 00:32:12,627
audience like me?

713
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,131
And it's about the whole game.

714
00:32:15,631 --> 00:32:17,171
What do I mean by the whole game?

715
00:32:19,132 --> 00:32:21,212
We all understand the core loop and the meta,

716
00:32:21,252 --> 00:32:22,373
and we all are individual.

717
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:23,673
This is given.

718
00:32:25,814 --> 00:32:27,634
But we have legal compliances.

719
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:29,975
In US, we have COPPA.

720
00:32:30,755 --> 00:32:32,056
In Europe, we have GDPR.

721
00:32:32,456 --> 00:32:35,017
There are other compliances, legal compliances.

722
00:32:37,116 --> 00:32:40,077
This is all defined before we move into production.

723
00:32:40,097 --> 00:32:43,359
This is all put into the backlog before we

724
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:44,199
move into production.

725
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,421
And we need to make sure that during production, we build

726
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:48,921
all this, we integrate all this.

727
00:32:49,162 --> 00:32:52,383
We can't come two days before soft launch and say, oh, what

728
00:32:52,443 --> 00:32:53,063
is GDPR?

729
00:32:53,163 --> 00:32:55,024
Or what is Child Protection COPA?

730
00:32:55,525 --> 00:32:56,245
It can't be like this.

731
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,686
So we need to give a lot of visibility.

732
00:32:58,866 --> 00:33:00,447
Then we have external compliance.

733
00:33:00,787 --> 00:33:03,588
We all have partners, Apple, Google, Amazon, you name it.

734
00:33:04,757 --> 00:33:05,538
So what do they want?

735
00:33:05,578 --> 00:33:07,940
They forbid us to do this, and they want us to do that.

736
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,021
They would like us to do that to be featured, for example.

737
00:33:10,442 --> 00:33:12,283
So we call it external compliance,

738
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,224
coming from our partner.

739
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:16,486
We are making sure that all the backlogs of our game

740
00:33:16,526 --> 00:33:18,888
in production have all those tasks already listed.

741
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:22,671
So whenever we estimate a delivery time, or we estimate

742
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:25,773
the size of a game, we are as accurate as we can be.

743
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:28,696
And then we have internal compliance.

744
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:30,297
So that would be Rovio compliance.

745
00:33:30,517 --> 00:33:31,598
So we can imagine that.

746
00:33:32,894 --> 00:33:35,795
At Rovio, with a portfolio of 15, 20 games that we have live,

747
00:33:35,835 --> 00:33:37,496
we always want to do cross-promotion.

748
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,977
And one game will promote the other game

749
00:33:41,157 --> 00:33:42,617
whenever it's needed.

750
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:46,279
And I took the example of Angry Birds 2.

751
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:48,559
I said a lot of good things about Angry Birds 2 today.

752
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:49,840
I'm going to stop now.

753
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,281
I'm going to say something bad about Angry Birds 2.

754
00:33:53,192 --> 00:33:57,634
They launched in July 2015, and I joined a few months before that.

755
00:33:57,714 --> 00:34:02,436
My first project at Rovio was to make sure that all our catalogs, and when I mean all,

756
00:34:02,756 --> 00:34:08,398
all our catalogs will have super-duper cross-promotion features that will cross-promote

757
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:12,075
Angry Birds 2 from every single one of our catalog.

758
00:34:12,395 --> 00:34:14,516
I spent a lot of time with designers, product leads,

759
00:34:14,536 --> 00:34:16,496
to convince them to prioritize their backlog,

760
00:34:16,877 --> 00:34:20,217
to implement cross-promotion feature, to support the launch.

761
00:34:20,357 --> 00:34:22,158
As a matter of fact, Angry Birds 2

762
00:34:22,198 --> 00:34:24,338
was number one in the chart before featuring started,

763
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:25,939
because of cross-promotion.

764
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,099
The cross-promotion was so efficient

765
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:31,200
that it boosted Angry Birds 2 to the top of the chart,

766
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,480
just with cross-promotion.

767
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,341
No featuring.

768
00:34:33,901 --> 00:34:34,561
Then featuring came.

769
00:34:36,102 --> 00:34:41,066
Couple of months, when Angry Birds 2 is fixing all the bugs

770
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:43,348
and adding what they couldn't do before global launch.

771
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:46,631
And then we went to Stockholm and say, all right, now,

772
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:47,672
you're going to pay back.

773
00:34:48,032 --> 00:34:50,715
Turn on your cross-promotion back and feed back some users

774
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,776
to our portfolio.

775
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:54,779
And the product league looking at me and say, cross-promote

776
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:54,979
what?

777
00:34:55,974 --> 00:34:58,435
They didn't have a clue about what was cross-promotion.

778
00:34:59,116 --> 00:35:01,036
So of course, they build the best game ever.

779
00:35:01,077 --> 00:35:01,877
It's a great game.

780
00:35:02,257 --> 00:35:03,618
But in terms of internal compliance,

781
00:35:03,658 --> 00:35:05,739
they were not helping the whole portfolio.

782
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:08,100
It was a very singled out project.

783
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,001
Since then, they implemented cross-promotion,

784
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:13,162
and they're contributing a lot to the cross-promotion

785
00:35:13,302 --> 00:35:13,843
of all the game.

786
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:16,424
But it was so surprising that after all the effort

787
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:19,645
that we've done, that they couldn't even pay back,

788
00:35:20,006 --> 00:35:20,806
if I can use this word.

789
00:35:25,188 --> 00:35:27,269
Then we go to soft launch green light.

790
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:31,392
And the question we are asking ourselves is,

791
00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:33,934
what does good look like?

792
00:35:34,294 --> 00:35:37,156
You remember when I said the example of the factory,

793
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,378
I had to justify a lot before moving a machine.

794
00:35:39,658 --> 00:35:41,219
And this is a little bit the spirit.

795
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,622
So we asked the team to define what kind of KPI

796
00:35:46,203 --> 00:35:47,304
would be good KPI.

797
00:35:47,664 --> 00:35:48,825
What would be a success story?

798
00:35:49,905 --> 00:35:50,646
We asked them that.

799
00:35:50,826 --> 00:35:52,928
Once they answer, we asked them to put it on the PowerPoint.

800
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:56,795
We asked them to print the PowerPoint.

801
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:58,696
We're not stopping here.

802
00:35:58,776 --> 00:36:01,378
We asked them to frame the PowerPoint that was printed

803
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,160
and to put it in the kitchen of the studio.

804
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:08,403
So everybody will see what this team is trying to achieve.

805
00:36:09,104 --> 00:36:10,025
And this is simple.

806
00:36:10,185 --> 00:36:11,025
This is silly.

807
00:36:11,426 --> 00:36:13,427
But it is so powerful.

808
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:16,569
It is so powerful to let the team think

809
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:19,492
about what they want to achieve and to commit to it.

810
00:36:20,092 --> 00:36:20,572
And of course.

811
00:36:21,273 --> 00:36:23,653
You know, things will change, or things will not change.

812
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:26,114
There's always been discussion around those KPI.

813
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:29,595
But putting them in front of the whole company in the company

814
00:36:29,615 --> 00:36:33,416
kitchen is very, very powerful, because you really

815
00:36:33,456 --> 00:36:35,436
have to think about what you try to achieve.

816
00:36:36,217 --> 00:36:37,837
By the way, we asked the same question

817
00:36:37,897 --> 00:36:39,177
very early in the process.

818
00:36:39,537 --> 00:36:41,598
But now we understand that the market has changed,

819
00:36:41,638 --> 00:36:43,018
so we are trying to readjust that.

820
00:36:43,038 --> 00:36:46,019
So across the whole production phases, we have an idea.

821
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,340
We have a clear idea about what we're trying to achieve.

822
00:36:49,549 --> 00:36:51,591
And this is the soft launch green light.

823
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:54,693
Again, it's not about asking, can I move to soft launch?

824
00:36:55,073 --> 00:36:56,975
It's more about, I'm moving to soft launch,

825
00:36:57,295 --> 00:36:59,537
and this is my plan, and this is what I try to achieve.

826
00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:06,782
Then we go to soft launch.

827
00:37:08,398 --> 00:37:09,779
It's a KPI driven phase.

828
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,961
We're going to do paid user acquisition.

829
00:37:12,121 --> 00:37:13,902
At Rovio, we do paid user acquisition.

830
00:37:14,703 --> 00:37:17,085
And we also do paid user acquisition at scale

831
00:37:17,305 --> 00:37:20,247
to make sure that all the CPI, cost per install,

832
00:37:20,287 --> 00:37:27,032
and the lifetime value, LTV, are the same at low scale

833
00:37:27,052 --> 00:37:27,612
and high scale.

834
00:37:28,733 --> 00:37:30,034
And we have two things in mind.

835
00:37:31,174 --> 00:37:33,576
Very hard, very hard to keep that in mind,

836
00:37:33,616 --> 00:37:34,877
but they're here.

837
00:37:35,477 --> 00:37:36,598
The first one is that.

838
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:39,494
Soft launch will not save our game.

839
00:37:40,635 --> 00:37:42,577
There was a lot of talk in GDC this year

840
00:37:42,657 --> 00:37:45,600
about improving retention.

841
00:37:47,205 --> 00:37:51,506
And we all acknowledge the fact that beyond the obvious first

842
00:37:51,526 --> 00:37:55,648
time user experience tweak, D1, D3 improvement,

843
00:37:56,228 --> 00:37:59,709
it is very hard to improve retention.

844
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:01,150
One of the talk, I think yesterday,

845
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:06,691
said that retention is a factor of the genre, the art

846
00:38:06,711 --> 00:38:08,292
style, and the game design.

847
00:38:09,773 --> 00:38:12,313
None of those three is easy to change.

848
00:38:12,774 --> 00:38:14,614
So what it means that if long-term retention is

849
00:38:14,654 --> 00:38:15,474
bad at soft launch.

850
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:17,173
Then it's bad forever.

851
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,593
It's extremely hard to change it.

852
00:38:18,873 --> 00:38:22,134
And we have to remind ourselves, if long-term retention is not

853
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,315
good, we should stop.

854
00:38:24,655 --> 00:38:25,595
We can't save it.

855
00:38:25,935 --> 00:38:28,216
There are exceptions, but in theory, we can't save it.

856
00:38:28,256 --> 00:38:29,376
So we have to remind ourselves.

857
00:38:29,956 --> 00:38:30,456
What it means?

858
00:38:30,696 --> 00:38:32,357
It means that if we have a long soft launch,

859
00:38:33,517 --> 00:38:34,417
it means it's a good game.

860
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,478
It means that we have a long-term retention that

861
00:38:37,538 --> 00:38:39,579
is good, and we are tweaking the economy

862
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:42,359
to make better app DAO and average revenue per paying

863
00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:43,340
users, et cetera.

864
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:46,696
But we have to remember ourselves all the time

865
00:38:46,756 --> 00:38:49,677
that if it's not good in terms of long-term retention,

866
00:38:49,717 --> 00:38:50,497
we better stop it.

867
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:54,158
And that's a soft launch.

868
00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:55,539
So we do paid user acquisition.

869
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:57,639
We do paid user acquisition at scale.

870
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,040
And we're looking at retention very closely.

871
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,561
Battle Bay here spent 14 months in soft launch,

872
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:05,582
the longest for Rovio.

873
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:07,142
Quite long soft launch.

874
00:39:07,902 --> 00:39:08,442
But it's worth it.

875
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:09,663
Very good game for us.

876
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:14,707
New genre, five versus five, real-time battle,

877
00:39:15,988 --> 00:39:17,048
and very good KPIs.

878
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:17,968
We're very happy about it.

879
00:39:18,008 --> 00:39:19,488
And we don't regret a single moment

880
00:39:19,508 --> 00:39:21,149
to have spent 14 months in soft launch.

881
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,910
So we spend the time in soft launch.

882
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:28,790
We have KPI.

883
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:31,071
And again, we are going to launch it.

884
00:39:31,131 --> 00:39:33,971
So it's going to be the whole company behind one game.

885
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:37,192
Marketing, operation, localization.

886
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:39,098
delivery, you name it.

887
00:39:39,158 --> 00:39:40,339
Everybody's behind the game.

888
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:41,739
So again, we are stopping.

889
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:46,801
We're looking at the result of LTV and CPI at scale.

890
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:51,283
Can we boost download through paid user acquisition?

891
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:52,743
Do we have a launch plan?

892
00:39:52,983 --> 00:39:53,483
What is it?

893
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:54,764
Who's doing what and when?

894
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,705
And then we talk about live operations.

895
00:39:58,985 --> 00:40:03,667
The reality is live operation, we talk about it very often

896
00:40:03,707 --> 00:40:04,627
during the design phase.

897
00:40:04,647 --> 00:40:06,888
We talk a lot about it before production, green light,

898
00:40:06,928 --> 00:40:07,688
during production.

899
00:40:08,464 --> 00:40:11,229
But here, we're very honest with ourselves

900
00:40:11,249 --> 00:40:15,736
that we need live operation, not only in soft launch,

901
00:40:15,756 --> 00:40:18,259
because in soft launch, we also do live operation.

902
00:40:19,161 --> 00:40:21,945
But we also need it right after launch,

903
00:40:21,985 --> 00:40:23,988
so it feels fresh, straight off the bat.

904
00:40:27,574 --> 00:40:29,255
I took the example of Angry Birds Blast

905
00:40:29,516 --> 00:40:33,218
that was supposed to launch just very early 2017.

906
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:39,383
And early December 2016, so a few weeks

907
00:40:39,423 --> 00:40:41,345
before the global launch, we met with our partner.

908
00:40:42,345 --> 00:40:44,247
And one of our partners suggested that launching

909
00:40:44,287 --> 00:40:47,910
on December 22, 2016 would be a good idea.

910
00:40:49,411 --> 00:40:52,914
Oh, wow, three weeks before, like during Christmas holiday.

911
00:40:53,094 --> 00:40:54,575
So what we did, we look at our backlog.

912
00:40:54,595 --> 00:40:56,016
Luckily, we had a full game.

913
00:40:57,642 --> 00:40:59,662
spec'd out on the backlog, prioritized.

914
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:02,203
And we said, to global launch, we need all this.

915
00:41:02,323 --> 00:41:03,283
We don't need all that.

916
00:41:03,723 --> 00:41:05,284
And we said, can we make it by December 22?

917
00:41:06,444 --> 00:41:07,865
Yes, if we cancel our holiday.

918
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:09,965
So we cancel our holiday, and we launch.

919
00:41:10,005 --> 00:41:10,826
It was a great launch.

920
00:41:11,306 --> 00:41:14,447
But it was a good example of being well organized with a

921
00:41:14,527 --> 00:41:16,907
proper backlog, including all the compliances and

922
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:19,708
understanding what our partner will want, what we will want,

923
00:41:19,748 --> 00:41:20,728
what the legal will want.

924
00:41:21,656 --> 00:41:26,438
being able to launch three weeks ahead was feasible.

925
00:41:26,478 --> 00:41:29,120
It was a great launch for us, but it

926
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,441
was a very interesting Christmas in 2016.

927
00:41:34,383 --> 00:41:40,466
Live operations is all about improving our game every week.

928
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:43,108
There's no magic bullet, but if we

929
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:45,949
manage to improve our game every week a little bit,

930
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,710
this is live operation.

931
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:50,331
It's about being the best at getting better.

932
00:41:51,473 --> 00:41:53,395
And we're very lucky at Rovio.

933
00:41:54,195 --> 00:41:58,077
We have the chance to work with amazing brands like NFL

934
00:41:58,377 --> 00:41:59,738
and Iron Maiden.

935
00:42:00,338 --> 00:42:01,659
I don't know if you saw those campaigns.

936
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:02,900
We're very, very lucky.

937
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,822
Not only we do live operations with campaigns and events

938
00:42:07,342 --> 00:42:11,004
and sales, but we can do that with amazing brands.

939
00:42:11,304 --> 00:42:13,525
It means that, of course, it puts even more pressure on us

940
00:42:13,585 --> 00:42:15,186
to execute very, very well.

941
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:18,328
But all in all, I have to admit that our ability

942
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:19,969
to work with those brands is a great chance

943
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:21,210
that we do have at Rovio.

944
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,861
That's Flypath.

945
00:42:25,121 --> 00:42:25,501
That's it.

946
00:42:26,402 --> 00:42:27,362
We've seen the phases.

947
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:28,743
We've seen the green lights.

948
00:42:29,224 --> 00:42:30,444
We've seen the principle.

949
00:42:32,025 --> 00:42:33,826
Maybe there's one principle that is missing.

950
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:35,127
It's a life process.

951
00:42:35,808 --> 00:42:39,290
In the last two years, we had four major updates of Flypath

952
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:44,373
that were dictated by our maturity, our culture,

953
00:42:44,693 --> 00:42:47,795
but the reality that because Flypath is evolving

954
00:42:47,855 --> 00:42:49,556
according to our culture and our maturity,

955
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:51,858
everybody's, I mean, all the three points

956
00:42:51,918 --> 00:42:52,698
are feeding each other.

957
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:56,508
We removed green lights, we added green lights,

958
00:42:56,548 --> 00:42:58,910
we merged phases, we did a lot of things.

959
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,771
But by no mean is a set process,

960
00:43:01,931 --> 00:43:04,453
and if we meet again in a year,

961
00:43:04,473 --> 00:43:06,754
it's not going to be the same Flypass that we're having.

962
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:07,535
It's going to evolve.

963
00:43:08,535 --> 00:43:10,576
There is definitely a link between our maturity,

964
00:43:10,616 --> 00:43:12,057
our culture, and Flypass itself.

965
00:43:14,107 --> 00:43:14,808
So what's the outcome?

966
00:43:15,768 --> 00:43:18,310
2015 was very clear about what kind of process we had

967
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,711
and what kind of game we were delivering.

968
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:20,792
What's the outcome?

969
00:43:21,352 --> 00:43:24,214
Well, with Flypass, everyone knows

970
00:43:25,255 --> 00:43:27,917
what to expect at every step of the production process.

971
00:43:28,657 --> 00:43:30,198
This is a transparency that we are

972
00:43:30,238 --> 00:43:32,720
giving across central management, the team,

973
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,381
and the process.

974
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:34,942
No surprises.

975
00:43:35,442 --> 00:43:36,543
We all know what to expect.

976
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:41,904
The outcome is that we launch fewer games.

977
00:43:42,184 --> 00:43:45,509
You have seen less games launched by Rovio recently

978
00:43:47,011 --> 00:43:47,992
because we are more demanding.

979
00:43:48,814 --> 00:43:49,575
But there are better games.

980
00:43:50,816 --> 00:43:52,859
Angry Birds Evolution, Angry Birds Match,

981
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,703
great game for us, great launch last year.

982
00:43:57,266 --> 00:44:01,009
And more importantly, all those games are fitting the strategy.

983
00:44:01,329 --> 00:44:04,532
There's a great visibility at the Rovio level

984
00:44:04,552 --> 00:44:06,914
about what is our strategy, what we're trying to achieve,

985
00:44:07,214 --> 00:44:09,096
and what kind of game do we need to achieve that.

986
00:44:09,536 --> 00:44:10,777
And every game that we are launching

987
00:44:11,037 --> 00:44:12,458
are fitting the strategy.

988
00:44:12,518 --> 00:44:15,421
There's no more rogue project that is happening just because.

989
00:44:16,341 --> 00:44:18,783
They all have a review process through Flypass,

990
00:44:18,863 --> 00:44:21,185
and we make sure that every one of our delivery

991
00:44:21,305 --> 00:44:22,006
fits the strategy.

992
00:44:26,362 --> 00:44:28,683
Autonomy and transparency created trust.

993
00:44:29,544 --> 00:44:33,467
Rovio is a very nice company to work in at the moment.

994
00:44:33,927 --> 00:44:37,830
There's a lot of trust happening in the company.

995
00:44:38,451 --> 00:44:40,512
There's autonomy, we build it ourself,

996
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:43,334
and there's transparency.

997
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,577
It's hard, but it's happening, and we build it ourself.

998
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:49,859
We trust the process also.

999
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:51,720
We have a process that has a name.

1000
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,222
We trust it exists, we acknowledge it exists,

1001
00:44:54,262 --> 00:44:54,823
and we trust it.

1002
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,581
And the reality is that it enhanced the company culture

1003
00:44:58,621 --> 00:44:59,102
quite a lot.

1004
00:45:00,302 --> 00:45:02,304
I'm not saying it was a bad company in 2015,

1005
00:45:02,344 --> 00:45:04,565
but I'm saying that today it's a very, very nice company.

1006
00:45:04,605 --> 00:45:06,566
The company culture is really, really good.

1007
00:45:08,487 --> 00:45:09,388
So what are the next steps?

1008
00:45:09,448 --> 00:45:11,909
And we are coming to the end of the presentation here.

1009
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,392
The next step are about ambitious continuous

1010
00:45:16,452 --> 00:45:16,873
improvement.

1011
00:45:16,913 --> 00:45:18,954
I used to be improvement manager.

1012
00:45:19,034 --> 00:45:21,355
I like the ambitious, because we want

1013
00:45:21,395 --> 00:45:23,136
to be leading the industry.

1014
00:45:23,296 --> 00:45:23,897
We want to.

1015
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:26,189
set the world on fire again.

1016
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:27,770
So what are we doing?

1017
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,091
What are we looking at at the moment?

1018
00:45:29,551 --> 00:45:31,932
We're looking at need-based game design.

1019
00:45:32,392 --> 00:45:34,574
How do we define our target audience?

1020
00:45:34,674 --> 00:45:36,595
How do we understand our target audience?

1021
00:45:36,715 --> 00:45:37,875
What are their motivation?

1022
00:45:38,256 --> 00:45:38,896
What are their needs?

1023
00:45:39,576 --> 00:45:40,537
What are their frustration?

1024
00:45:41,097 --> 00:45:45,059
How do we build a relationship between the target audience

1025
00:45:45,998 --> 00:45:46,698
and the design.

1026
00:45:47,238 --> 00:45:49,179
This is something we're working very, very hard.

1027
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,561
So very early in the process of making game,

1028
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:53,402
we understand who we are making the game for

1029
00:45:53,782 --> 00:45:57,564
and what make them tick, and how we can create design

1030
00:45:57,884 --> 00:45:59,064
for those people.

1031
00:46:02,366 --> 00:46:03,126
Live Operations 2.0.

1032
00:46:03,747 --> 00:46:05,087
You've heard a lot about LiveOps.

1033
00:46:05,147 --> 00:46:07,609
LiveOps was in a lot of talks in GDC.

1034
00:46:07,749 --> 00:46:08,709
It's the buzzword.

1035
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:09,550
It's very important.

1036
00:46:10,244 --> 00:46:12,688
It's very important for us too, very, very important.

1037
00:46:12,989 --> 00:46:15,453
There's a lot of live ops in the presentation I've just done,

1038
00:46:15,853 --> 00:46:17,636
but we know we need to get better.

1039
00:46:18,337 --> 00:46:20,060
When I said, if you remember, that we're

1040
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,582
doing live operation in soft launch,

1041
00:46:22,163 --> 00:46:24,868
we are just starting to do live operations in soft launch.

1042
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,711
Because we realize it is very important to understand

1043
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:31,192
the LTV of our games while doing live operation.

1044
00:46:31,652 --> 00:46:34,334
It means that we need to work harder, faster, better

1045
00:46:34,734 --> 00:46:37,475
in having a real proper game before we self-launch

1046
00:46:37,735 --> 00:46:39,116
to be able to learn about this.

1047
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:40,916
And this is what I mean by live operations 2.0,

1048
00:46:41,917 --> 00:46:43,678
being even better at doing live operations.

1049
00:46:44,558 --> 00:46:46,579
And the third one is fast cycle time.

1050
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:48,297
Faster learning.

1051
00:46:49,037 --> 00:46:50,658
How do we accelerate the pace?

1052
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,501
How can we learn faster from users?

1053
00:46:54,742 --> 00:46:56,883
It means how do we make release faster?

1054
00:46:57,524 --> 00:47:00,066
One of the points that we have in mind is about how do we

1055
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:03,168
shift the quality ownership from a quality team to a

1056
00:47:03,228 --> 00:47:03,929
development team?

1057
00:47:04,249 --> 00:47:07,632
What kind of cultural change does it require to have the

1058
00:47:07,672 --> 00:47:10,334
development team being the owner of the quality?

1059
00:47:10,991 --> 00:47:14,492
And with that, we'll be able to go faster, have faster cycle

1060
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:18,253
time, faster release, and learn faster from the users.

1061
00:47:20,313 --> 00:47:24,774
Coming to my last slide here, what's coming next is we have

1062
00:47:24,814 --> 00:47:29,235
a process we are happy about that is evolving with the

1063
00:47:29,275 --> 00:47:30,755
production guild on its own.

1064
00:47:31,676 --> 00:47:33,536
So now we need to look at the product.

1065
00:47:33,836 --> 00:47:36,397
We need to look at the product very closely.

1066
00:47:38,193 --> 00:47:40,475
One of the reasons is, if we don't have a process,

1067
00:47:40,515 --> 00:47:43,157
or if a process is broken, we might lose time,

1068
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:44,157
we might lose money.

1069
00:47:44,657 --> 00:47:46,559
But those are small time and small money.

1070
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:49,560
If we don't have good product, we're

1071
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,941
talking about the life of the company.

1072
00:47:51,632 --> 00:47:52,633
We need good products.

1073
00:47:52,653 --> 00:47:59,299
So it means that the process is here to help us to make great game consistently.

1074
00:47:59,759 --> 00:48:01,741
It means we need to make great game.

1075
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:04,063
It's not about focusing on the process.

1076
00:48:04,123 --> 00:48:06,265
It's about focusing on the product.

1077
00:48:06,405 --> 00:48:12,590
And that's when Flypath, the culture, and the maturity are coming to one.

1078
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:15,212
The maturity is recorded in Flypath.

1079
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:18,134
Our culture is dictated by Flypath, and they all one.

1080
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:19,876
And now we are looking at the product.

1081
00:48:22,285 --> 00:48:23,987
This is it for the presentation.

1082
00:48:24,048 --> 00:48:25,209
Thank you very much for listening.

1083
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:35,786
So I'm very happy to take any question if there is any.

1084
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:45,467
Hi, I'm a producer on some mobile games right now, and I was just curious about

1085
00:48:46,187 --> 00:48:51,389
How you guys go about sun setting a product and making that decision because you just use you're saying in the green light

1086
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,269
That's not for that

1087
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:59,112
But along the way do you have some kind of formal process set up in flight path for if you do need to sunset something?

1088
00:48:59,172 --> 00:49:01,513
Early okay, so is the question about

1089
00:49:02,785 --> 00:49:04,526
killing a game during production,

1090
00:49:04,586 --> 00:49:06,607
or is it about sunsetting a game while it's

1091
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:07,668
been live for many years?

1092
00:49:07,688 --> 00:49:08,268
Killing the game.

1093
00:49:08,288 --> 00:49:08,789
Killing, OK.

1094
00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:09,829
So killing is a good game.

1095
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:11,610
It's good because it's painful.

1096
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:14,972
And for the team, it's always painful to stop your baby,

1097
00:49:15,092 --> 00:49:16,073
stop developing your baby.

1098
00:49:16,713 --> 00:49:20,296
So we don't have a formal process.

1099
00:49:20,336 --> 00:49:22,857
I mean, we have the standard aftermath.

1100
00:49:23,398 --> 00:49:27,520
And we pop up the champagne, and we put the Wall of Fame photos,

1101
00:49:27,981 --> 00:49:28,401
and everything.

1102
00:49:30,062 --> 00:49:30,342
But it's

1103
00:49:32,218 --> 00:49:34,079
There are many things that we do and we don't do.

1104
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:35,539
So we do the basics.

1105
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,361
What we don't do is about considering the team.

1106
00:49:39,401 --> 00:49:41,022
So there are two points.

1107
00:49:41,282 --> 00:49:43,082
And I mentioned about the value of the team.

1108
00:49:44,103 --> 00:49:44,603
How do we see that?

1109
00:49:44,763 --> 00:49:47,284
There's one point about we take the same team and we try again.

1110
00:49:47,604 --> 00:49:49,345
It has a value because we all learn together.

1111
00:49:49,765 --> 00:49:51,046
Or the other one is acknowledging

1112
00:49:51,086 --> 00:49:52,046
that the team didn't work.

1113
00:49:52,106 --> 00:49:54,047
And it's very hard because they are colleagues and friends.

1114
00:49:54,387 --> 00:49:55,888
But acknowledging something didn't work

1115
00:49:55,928 --> 00:49:56,788
and then change the team.

1116
00:49:57,068 --> 00:49:58,849
And then you come to very personal decision.

1117
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:00,951
And that we know we have to be better at.

1118
00:50:01,812 --> 00:50:03,414
So that is something that is coming.

1119
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:06,557
But otherwise, I would say the usual suspect of the champagne

1120
00:50:06,597 --> 00:50:10,121
and parties and aftermath and these kind of things.

1121
00:50:10,862 --> 00:50:12,203
Post-mortem, sorry, is the proper word.

1122
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:12,724
Yes.

1123
00:50:12,744 --> 00:50:13,084
Thank you.

1124
00:50:13,224 --> 00:50:13,425
Thank you.

1125
00:50:15,782 --> 00:50:16,442
I have a question.

1126
00:50:16,822 --> 00:50:16,943
Oh.

1127
00:50:17,543 --> 00:50:17,783
Sorry.

1128
00:50:18,163 --> 00:50:18,703
No, that's fine.

1129
00:50:18,843 --> 00:50:18,983
Sorry.

1130
00:50:19,003 --> 00:50:20,043
Of course.

1131
00:50:20,663 --> 00:50:28,825
I'd like you to go talk a little bit more about the decision to cancel holiday and make

1132
00:50:28,865 --> 00:50:34,746
the staff work leading up to Christmas because that's going to have a massive impact on company

1133
00:50:34,786 --> 00:50:35,206
culture.

1134
00:50:35,226 --> 00:50:36,147
Okay.

1135
00:50:36,187 --> 00:50:38,127
So I'd like you to talk a little more about that.

1136
00:50:38,147 --> 00:50:38,707
Okay.

1137
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:39,267
That's a finger in my...

1138
00:50:43,195 --> 00:50:45,196
in my ribs, so I lied.

1139
00:50:45,916 --> 00:50:47,237
We didn't cancel the holiday.

1140
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:50,579
So what we did, though?

1141
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:55,242
Because the launch was 22nd of December, technically, we

1142
00:50:55,322 --> 00:50:56,423
looked for volunteer.

1143
00:50:56,763 --> 00:51:00,165
That from 22nd of December to the 7th of January, whenever

1144
00:51:00,205 --> 00:51:04,027
we were coming back to the office, we will have the BI,

1145
00:51:04,087 --> 00:51:06,689
we will have the server operations, cloud

1146
00:51:06,729 --> 00:51:07,449
operation, et cetera.

1147
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:08,249
available.

1148
00:51:08,289 --> 00:51:09,330
So we look for volunteers.

1149
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:10,270
We didn't force anybody.

1150
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:13,531
And then we just worked very hard for the few weeks

1151
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:14,451
that was remaining.

1152
00:51:14,711 --> 00:51:16,071
So when I say we canceled our holiday,

1153
00:51:16,131 --> 00:51:17,752
maybe we canceled our holiday spirit

1154
00:51:17,812 --> 00:51:20,853
about ramping down toward the end of the year

1155
00:51:20,873 --> 00:51:23,113
when there's nothing much to do, because the apps are going

1156
00:51:23,153 --> 00:51:25,154
to close anyway, this kind of thing.

1157
00:51:25,174 --> 00:51:26,894
So I like to do it a bit just for the presentation.

1158
00:51:26,974 --> 00:51:27,834
No, that's fine.

1159
00:51:27,955 --> 00:51:30,195
But yes, we did work hard for it,

1160
00:51:30,515 --> 00:51:31,515
and then we looked for a volunteer.

1161
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,976
But we'd never cancel any holiday in that sense.

1162
00:51:34,196 --> 00:51:34,416
Great.

1163
00:51:34,436 --> 00:51:34,776
Thank you.

1164
00:51:35,336 --> 00:51:35,537
Thank you.

1165
00:51:37,464 --> 00:51:39,185
Hi there, great talk, thank you.

1166
00:51:41,225 --> 00:51:45,347
Do you have a lot of old titles, right?

1167
00:51:45,467 --> 00:51:49,108
Do you apply Flypass process to maintainers?

1168
00:51:49,668 --> 00:51:53,490
To maintain those, because it's a tough process.

1169
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:54,790
It's a good question.

1170
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:56,151
It's a very, very good question.

1171
00:51:56,951 --> 00:51:58,011
A lot of observation here.

1172
00:51:58,511 --> 00:52:00,852
So if you notice that Flypass stop at live operation.

1173
00:52:01,592 --> 00:52:02,853
And we've been asking ourselves, what

1174
00:52:02,893 --> 00:52:03,933
about Flypass after that?

1175
00:52:04,513 --> 00:52:05,954
What about Flypass for a game that?

1176
00:52:07,441 --> 00:52:09,784
go beyond live operations, so maybe go to autopilot.

1177
00:52:10,124 --> 00:52:11,586
Autopilot, meaning it's on the store,

1178
00:52:11,626 --> 00:52:13,169
it's there to be downloaded and play,

1179
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:14,811
but nobody's really maintaining it.

1180
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,992
Sunset, you're there but you can't really pay any IEP, etc.

1181
00:52:19,032 --> 00:52:20,793
We've been asking ourselves this question.

1182
00:52:21,374 --> 00:52:24,477
The priority for us is really to focus on the game that we are making,

1183
00:52:24,557 --> 00:52:25,698
the new game we're going to launch,

1184
00:52:25,778 --> 00:52:28,280
because we are convinced that the game that we're going to launch

1185
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,021
are going to be the next hit of tomorrow.

1186
00:52:31,142 --> 00:52:32,103
We're not going to...

1187
00:52:34,225 --> 00:52:36,847
We can maintain a lot of the game that is in live operation.

1188
00:52:36,868 --> 00:52:37,568
We can grow them.

1189
00:52:38,008 --> 00:52:39,589
But we know the next big hit that

1190
00:52:39,649 --> 00:52:41,490
is going to be hundreds and hundreds of millions

1191
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:44,371
is going to come from a game that is in concept today.

1192
00:52:44,971 --> 00:52:47,972
So we're not applying FlyPath too much,

1193
00:52:48,412 --> 00:52:52,074
just because it's a low priority for us at the moment.

1194
00:52:52,434 --> 00:52:55,635
So anything that is coming live that is being developed

1195
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:57,756
is going through FlyPath.

1196
00:52:59,236 --> 00:52:59,476
Thank you.

1197
00:53:02,725 --> 00:53:07,326
It was a very good talk from the concept on.

1198
00:53:07,346 --> 00:53:12,568
I was just curious about the process for generating ideas and filtering ideas that we will get

1199
00:53:12,608 --> 00:53:14,708
to preproduction.

1200
00:53:14,728 --> 00:53:15,589
A lot of good questions.

1201
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:19,910
A lot of good, because it's really like all the plugs, all the holes that are in my presentation

1202
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,050
are covered by good questions.

1203
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:22,971
So this is also something that we are...

1204
00:53:24,036 --> 00:53:30,319
Searching we're searching our soul here. What is the what is the the good answer? So one studio has a 20% rule

1205
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:33,620
so every in a sprint which is

1206
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:40,883
Which is 10 days they will dedicate one day one day to do something something can be

1207
00:53:41,623 --> 00:53:44,664
Framed or something can be totally open. So they've tried different things

1208
00:53:46,677 --> 00:53:52,079
All the teams are thinking that you should be able to do your work with 80% of your time,

1209
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,900
then you have 20% of your time to...

1210
00:53:54,141 --> 00:53:55,201
It's a bit the same principle.

1211
00:53:55,621 --> 00:53:59,383
Then we have very well organized game jam at the moment, a little bit at the studio

1212
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:03,205
level, not at the Rovio level.

1213
00:54:03,585 --> 00:54:08,128
But for example, when the AR kit came, we made a game jam about the AR kit.

1214
00:54:08,628 --> 00:54:11,328
whenever we were thinking about,

1215
00:54:11,828 --> 00:54:13,749
would there be a next slingshot game?

1216
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:14,909
Would there be one?

1217
00:54:14,929 --> 00:54:15,649
So what could it be?

1218
00:54:15,729 --> 00:54:17,009
Let's do a slingshot game jam.

1219
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:18,010
So we have that.

1220
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:21,710
But overall, we don't have a very strong organized way

1221
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:24,851
of addition and of game jamming.

1222
00:54:24,911 --> 00:54:26,411
It's really ad hoc at the moment.

1223
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:27,911
But we're looking at it to see how we

1224
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,072
can be a bit more systematic.

1225
00:54:29,872 --> 00:54:32,412
Because we are convinced that feeding the beast, we say.

1226
00:54:32,452 --> 00:54:34,133
The more ideas we have, the better chance

1227
00:54:34,153 --> 00:54:37,213
we have to have good ideas and good business case.

1228
00:54:37,533 --> 00:54:37,673
Cool.

1229
00:54:37,953 --> 00:54:38,113
