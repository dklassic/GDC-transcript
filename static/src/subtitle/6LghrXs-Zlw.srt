1
00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:07,530
Good afternoon, everybody.

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,171
Welcome to We Demand Games.

3
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:13,594
The GDC people have asked me to remind you to please silence

4
00:00:13,654 --> 00:00:17,936
your cell phones for takeoff, and also to remind you please

5
00:00:17,996 --> 00:00:20,258
to rate the talk afterwards.

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,552
I'm Owen Gottlieb, assistant professor of interactive games and media at Rochester Institute

7
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:29,173
of Technology, and I'm also there at the MAGIC Center.

8
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:34,815
So I teach in the School of Interactive Games and Media, and the MAGIC Center is our game

9
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:38,657
studio and also a laboratory where we do all kinds of research.

10
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:43,280
There, I'm the founder and the principal researcher at the Initiative in Religion,

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,222
Culture, and Policy at the MAGIC Center.

12
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:49,425
This is our new campus, our new building, which is opening in the fall.

13
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:54,028
A brand new building where we're moving from a beautiful building to a very special new

14
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:56,550
building so maybe you'll have a chance to come and visit.

15
00:00:57,371 --> 00:01:03,596
At the initiative, which we call RCP, we do original design and research on literacy

16
00:01:03,656 --> 00:01:08,640
and comparative religion, exploring what anthropologists call the acquisition of cultural practices,

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,244
basically how people hand down aspects of their cultural practices and create new practices

18
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:16,006
within a cultural group.

19
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:20,710
And all this is targeted to policy impact, either in education or in governmental policy.

20
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,132
And we're faculty at RIT.

21
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:26,175
We're faculty at about seven other institutions, and that's growing.

22
00:01:26,535 --> 00:01:29,218
And many fantastic graduate students and undergraduate students.

23
00:01:29,238 --> 00:01:34,983
We have an alum here, Ruben, today, who is a part of what we have created, and Ian Schreiber

24
00:01:35,063 --> 00:01:35,403
as well.

25
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:40,668
We've recently released two tabletop games in the Lost and Found series, and we also

26
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:44,652
have a digital prototype that we delivered for the mobile phone for our strategy game

27
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,854
for the National Endowment for the Humanities.

28
00:01:47,957 --> 00:01:52,560
So our games are released via GameCrafter, which is one of the places that I'm going

29
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,262
to speak about today and do some targeted case studies about our work there.

30
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:58,864
They're for sale to the public using print-on-demand.

31
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:02,766
And these games happen to be about teaching religious legal systems.

32
00:02:03,086 --> 00:02:06,248
So the games are set in Fustat, Old Cairo, in the 12th century.

33
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:10,611
And the first two games address a Jewish legal code by Moses Maimonides called the Mishneh

34
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:11,011
Torah.

35
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:14,674
And we're currently in development on an Islamic law expansion module.

36
00:02:15,544 --> 00:02:20,548
We hear a lot these days about negative perceptions and fears around religious legal systems,

37
00:02:21,088 --> 00:02:25,051
but we hear very little about what evolutionary anthropologists call the pro-social aspects

38
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:25,752
of religion.

39
00:02:26,352 --> 00:02:31,176
And these law systems were a primary form of governance, promoting community sustainability,

40
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:33,338
collaboration and cooperation.

41
00:02:33,418 --> 00:02:34,979
You can see this in the game play.

42
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:39,542
And we're working to expand that discourse around religious legal systems in their historical

43
00:02:39,642 --> 00:02:40,943
and geographic contexts.

44
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:47,628
So print-on-demand comes into play in many different aspects of my work and the work

45
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:52,711
of the team members, both in the design studio and also in research in the field as we take

46
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:56,512
our games out to be played and watch what happens when people play them and different

47
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:57,373
iterations of them.

48
00:02:58,033 --> 00:03:01,874
And then also teaching game design in the classroom, so when I'm teaching game design

49
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:02,435
and development,

50
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:07,900
Using these systems to help students learn about what it means to ship and that whole process.

51
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,585
And it's really centered around getting something on sale and in the hands of players.

52
00:03:14,725 --> 00:03:20,269
So I teach my students about backwards planning, planning and visioning and the importance

53
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:25,012
of having a picture in mind of your goal and have your team bought into that goal as a

54
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:28,995
North Star with which to navigate and to inspire and aspire.

55
00:03:29,295 --> 00:03:32,217
And so this was kind of the vision that had started it off.

56
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:36,040
These are the finished games in shrink wrap that we had received back.

57
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,376
And the idea was, could we get a box game in our hands and have it?

58
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:41,917
And so this was our North Star.

59
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:44,620
We actually had one game in mind, and we ended up with two games,

60
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,142
which I'm very excited about.

61
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:49,825
So I start here with this realized vision of games in my hands,

62
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,467
and then we'll work backwards.

63
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:53,108
So this is me turning around the box.

64
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,211
I can't believe after the years of work we put into it,

65
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:56,011
I'm holding the game.

66
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:56,992
It's going to go on the shelf.

67
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,915
This is the strategy game, and here's the party game.

68
00:04:01,114 --> 00:04:04,977
So how did I formulate the vision that we would eventually together realize?

69
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:07,638
Well, I had my previous game, Jewish Time Jump New York,

70
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:12,041
is a mobile GPS augmented reality game for teaching history on location

71
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:14,803
in Washington Square Park in New York City.

72
00:04:15,143 --> 00:04:17,965
And the game was built on Eris, an open source platform,

73
00:04:18,286 --> 00:04:20,287
and so the game is free for players.

74
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,449
I'm very proud of the game, and I learned a great deal about getting games

75
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:26,331
into the hands of players and on the market with that project.

76
00:04:28,097 --> 00:04:30,258
Now, Jewish Time Jump, while it was a critical success,

77
00:04:30,318 --> 00:04:32,279
and it's a success from our players' perspective,

78
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,180
keeping it up to date required tremendous and consistent

79
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,121
effort every time the software updated.

80
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:39,882
So every time the Ares platform updated,

81
00:04:40,202 --> 00:04:42,183
or every time iOS was updated, and we

82
00:04:42,223 --> 00:04:44,264
had to rescale everything for the screen size.

83
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:46,705
And entering this new game series,

84
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:49,466
I wanted a game that wouldn't require constant updating,

85
00:04:49,746 --> 00:04:52,047
and nor would it require the kind of raising of funds

86
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:54,708
that I need to do to support that kind of updating.

87
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:59,634
Meanwhile, at the same time, my research is shifting, so I've been shifting focus from

88
00:04:59,694 --> 00:05:05,236
place-based games for teaching history into looking at and analyzing the parallels between

89
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:07,677
medieval legal codes and game systems.

90
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:12,899
Both are rule-based systems, and I had moved kind of the law project to the forefront.

91
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:18,285
So we were looking at genres of tabletop games that would fit with law codes regarding, in

92
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:20,166
particular, lost and found objects.

93
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:22,526
We were thinking about things like resource management.

94
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:26,547
And I'm committed to the intersection of the embodied and the digital, just like you see

95
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:29,468
with the GPS game out in Washington Square Park.

96
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:34,789
And so we turned to a card-to-mobile approach, with games like, think about Agricola or

97
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:38,750
Settlers of Catan, that you have a tabletop game and they also have a mobile version of

98
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:38,850
it.

99
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,914
So I was determined to have a game that we'd have a version that could sit on the shelf

100
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:46,976
for decades without the need for digital update or for emulators to run it, because I always

101
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:49,977
get sad when I have to go, oh, I have to somehow find an emulator for this game.

102
00:05:50,637 --> 00:05:54,779
And leaving behind also the freeware model of Jewish time jump, because I was going to

103
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,760
prove that I could generate revenue, even if small, that could

104
00:05:58,361 --> 00:06:02,205
Turn back in to support the research and the kind of work that we're doing about games and learning.

105
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:07,090
So I spent a great deal of time researching what it would mean to publish an analog game,

106
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,033
talking to friends and colleagues who had published tabletop games

107
00:06:10,073 --> 00:06:12,656
and gone through all the trials and tribulations of that process.

108
00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:16,340
And eventually I landed on print-on-demand as the only viable option,

109
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,862
given my needs and constraints.

110
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,443
So we settled on the Game Crafter, and I'll speak briefly about some other options.

111
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:27,709
Over the course of about three years, I worked closely with students, including Matthew Fassman,

112
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:32,114
Ryan Muscoff, a number of other students, exploring all the affordances and limits of

113
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:35,698
print-on-demand, and then we learned about those firsthand in the hard way.

114
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:40,763
And I hope that the takeaways today, when you make your decisions going into print-on-demand,

115
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:45,906
You'll take those with you, and we'll have gone ahead and forged the bridge for you a bit.

116
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:48,588
So this is the GameCrafter storefront.

117
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:53,110
You also may be familiar with print and play from AdMagic, the people who make cards against humanity.

118
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:57,633
And this site has advanced since we were making our decisions.

119
00:06:58,473 --> 00:07:01,095
It wasn't the right fit for us then. It could be now.

120
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:04,097
We kind of scouted this, whether to determine it was a good fit.

121
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,038
They now have a storefront as well.

122
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:09,740
And I have students in my class now, in game design and development,

123
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,583
who are also using Shapeways to sell straight-to-market game pieces

124
00:07:13,623 --> 00:07:14,623
that are 3D printed.

125
00:07:14,964 --> 00:07:16,565
Another kind of model to keep in mind.

126
00:07:18,086 --> 00:07:22,188
So we landed on print-on-demand, and this is the Shapeways site.

127
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:25,471
We landed on print-on-demand, and so I want to discuss

128
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:27,732
what could print-on-demand afford us?

129
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:32,854
So here's a quick sense of what it was going to mean for us.

130
00:07:33,174 --> 00:07:37,795
That we could release a game that didn't require expensive and regular updates,

131
00:07:38,035 --> 00:07:39,896
that we could move forward to commercialization,

132
00:07:39,936 --> 00:07:42,517
right, our games are on the market in the hands of paying customers now,

133
00:07:42,937 --> 00:07:44,198
with an extremely low budget.

134
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:46,959
We could pilot a game that way and get it to market

135
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:49,360
without having to already have high sales figures.

136
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:55,375
We could print prototypes with our art and put them in the hands of players in volume

137
00:07:55,435 --> 00:08:01,280
quantities and lower costs than actually having to print each one at our university print

138
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,141
shop, for example.

139
00:08:02,822 --> 00:08:06,925
And we could develop a game for research with a shelf-worthy look and feel, that kind of

140
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:08,527
sense of what I was holding in my hands.

141
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:12,751
And maybe even more importantly from a pro perspective, I could avoid these things I

142
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:14,293
really wanted to avoid.

143
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:19,539
So I wanted to avoid laying out thousands of dollars to make a print run prior to sales,

144
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,581
so low budget entry to market.

145
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:27,285
I didn't have to run a Kickstarter campaign and raise funds and do community management

146
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:32,867
for Kickstarter or do supply chain logistics for making sure that things get shipped out

147
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,127
to all the people who contribute.

148
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:38,369
I was very hesitant to go the Kickstarter route, especially on this project, but in

149
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:42,070
general I see the tremendous effort that people who do Kickstarters have to do.

150
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,231
I wanted to try to spend more time in the design studio if possible.

151
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,984
And when I talk about supply chain logistics, some of the things I'm talking about are,

152
00:08:50,004 --> 00:08:50,945
for example, warehousing.

153
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:55,109
If you're going to order a thousand games, you've got to usually pay rent and store them

154
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:59,054
somewhere, especially if you're in a city and you don't happen to have a safe space

155
00:08:59,134 --> 00:09:00,015
to store cardboard.

156
00:09:01,316 --> 00:09:04,257
Other aspects of the supply chain logistics have to do with the distribution.

157
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:08,298
Am I going to have to walk to the post office, you know, four or five times a week

158
00:09:08,318 --> 00:09:11,178
with bundles in my hand in order to get there and ship them out?

159
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:15,019
And then I had spent some time doing some work in supply chain logistics

160
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:20,300
when I was a management consultant and knew about aspects of the system like RMAs,

161
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,041
so return merchandise authorizations, and I did not want to get involved with that.

162
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:28,542
I wanted to concentrate on game design, development, and looking at how people learn with games.

163
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:33,646
In addition, the storefront would give us merchandising so I wouldn't have to fight

164
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:35,911
for shelf space anywhere, so that was important.

165
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:38,216
And then thinking about working with a printer.

166
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:43,293
One of my friends had said to me, listen, when you're working on getting your analog

167
00:09:43,313 --> 00:09:47,594
game printed, you need to go to China and you need to meet in person with your printer

168
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:50,875
because you need to have a relationship with that printer or things are going to go sideways.

169
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:55,697
And I really didn't want to have to build a relationship and go to China and I had really

170
00:09:55,737 --> 00:09:56,578
no way of going to China.

171
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:00,399
It's someday I want to go to China, but not for working, you know, with working on a printer

172
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:01,179
in that regard.

173
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,040
So these are all things that I could avoid.

174
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:07,574
Now on the con side, because I want you to know about some of the issues that are right

175
00:10:07,614 --> 00:10:12,136
up front that we're dealing with, you have an increase in printing cost when you don't

176
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:12,736
go bulk.

177
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:17,437
So if you haven't gone bulk, you're going to be paying a great deal for printing costs

178
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,918
on an individual game or even maybe 10 or 15 or 20, the price is going to go up.

179
00:10:22,718 --> 00:10:26,279
We're going to talk at greater length when I do the case studies about not having product

180
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:26,980
safety testing.

181
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,389
And ways that there are workarounds for dealing with that.

182
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:34,891
We still needed product liability insurance, and I'm going to tie that back to the issue

183
00:10:34,911 --> 00:10:35,731
of safety testing.

184
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:40,672
We weren't directly working with a printer, so I couldn't pick up the phone and talk to

185
00:10:40,692 --> 00:10:42,273
the printer and say, listen, this is an issue.

186
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:45,114
So that's a downside of not having a relationship with a printer.

187
00:10:45,614 --> 00:10:48,135
So we have higher prices and then lower margins.

188
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:52,556
We're talking about very, very low margins because of the cost of printing in a print

189
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:54,717
on demand service that you're not doing bulk with.

190
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:01,881
So I want to take you inside some of the case studies of working inside of the GameCrafter

191
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:07,243
in particular, so that you can avoid some of these pitfalls that we've had.

192
00:11:07,403 --> 00:11:10,364
And we're going to start at the very end of production, and I like to call this one the

193
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,584
Case of the Greedy Grabber.

194
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:17,746
For those of you who haven't been inside on the GameCrafter, this is the inside.

195
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:20,727
You can see these patterned card backs, and I'll show you in more detail.

196
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:26,427
All of the art in the game is based on architecture of Fustat Cairo in the 12th century.

197
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:30,370
And so this is where you kind of put up all of your individual cards.

198
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,674
This is, I have the students in my class have to have everything ready on GameCrafter.

199
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,097
They're not forced to actually take it to market, but they have to understand the production

200
00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:40,038
process to get it so they could take it to market.

201
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:43,421
This is another card back working on architectural patterns.

202
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:49,276
We're going to talk about playmats and cards.

203
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:51,478
So one of the things, these are playmats from the game.

204
00:11:51,498 --> 00:11:52,759
So it's largely a card game.

205
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,422
This is also important to think about because the cost of,

206
00:11:55,462 --> 00:11:58,345
say, a meeple is going to be much larger than the cost of a

207
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:01,227
card, and so many of the designers I've been talking to

208
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,650
have been saying, OK, we're going to go all card.

209
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,972
And you can take mechanics that are based on things that

210
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:06,893
would be more expensive.

211
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:10,756
We're going to make them a card mechanic and be able to ship a game that's much more affordable.

212
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:16,722
So we went the card route from the beginning with the exception of our instruction booklet and these play mats.

213
00:12:16,762 --> 00:12:21,566
So there's play mats that each player has and then there's a communal play mat where communal play takes place.

214
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:26,982
This is what the communal playmat looks like so that people are placing their cards.

215
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:31,043
It's a game about balancing your communal responsibilities with your family responsibilities,

216
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:36,365
collaboration, cooperation, competition, mixing, and then the trade-off decisions that players

217
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:37,906
start having to make in doing that.

218
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:41,187
And this is the cow herd roll card.

219
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:43,888
So that's the playmat that the cow herd plays.

220
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:46,829
And we have both male and female characters for each of the...

221
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:49,731
for each of the roles in the game.

222
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:51,793
Now, this is about QA.

223
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:53,835
So there's markings on here that are not the actual cards,

224
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:54,676
they're QA markings.

225
00:12:54,716 --> 00:12:56,698
We went through about 19 QA cycles

226
00:12:56,738 --> 00:12:57,859
on the last version of this.

227
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,182
And I wanted to show specifically ways

228
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:01,002
that we approached QA.

229
00:13:01,062 --> 00:13:03,765
So I'm gonna close in on the money purse in the river.

230
00:13:04,446 --> 00:13:06,788
And, right, this is so if we have about seven,

231
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,570
eight people doing rounds of QA,

232
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,372
because all the details, right, have to be.

233
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:12,694
We did about 19 rounds of QA on the version that goes to the printer.

234
00:13:13,014 --> 00:13:15,998
We did a few early print rounds to test things out, but now we're talking about the one we

235
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:16,939
took to market.

236
00:13:26,592 --> 00:13:29,997
We did that and then I ordered proof copies of the game so I could pull the game out,

237
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,823
I could look at it, I could go through every aspect, check all the printing, check the

238
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:36,968
card ends, everything, went through the whole thing and it looked gorgeous.

239
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:38,530
We were like so excited.

240
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,715
So the teams gathered around, we're looking at this, okay, we can go to ship.

241
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:44,065
So we had shipped one of each game.

242
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:46,166
We then order 10 of each.

243
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:48,547
Now these are games in the $35 range,

244
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:50,748
and you pay shipping, and you pay shipping insurance.

245
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:52,709
So we get the boxes back, open it up,

246
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,270
and we start spot checking.

247
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:56,191
And this is one of the play mats.

248
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,613
Now you'll notice on the bottom that there's cutoff.

249
00:13:58,653 --> 00:14:00,113
So completed communal responsibility

250
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:01,054
is partially cut off.

251
00:14:01,494 --> 00:14:03,975
And on the cow herd, you can see that beyond the law pile

252
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:05,396
at the bottom right is cut off,

253
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:07,217
and the T of transgression is cut off.

254
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:09,198
We're going like, how is this possible?

255
00:14:09,238 --> 00:14:10,779
Like we have a proof in our hand.

256
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:13,221
But this didn't happen, and yet this is happening.

257
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:15,343
So we can't imagine what it is.

258
00:14:15,383 --> 00:14:17,264
And we start to do investigation.

259
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:20,267
And I reach out, and I'm writing to the game crafter.

260
00:14:20,908 --> 00:14:23,450
And we went back to the designer, who followed the

261
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,611
specs very closely.

262
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:27,974
And eventually we found out that if you pull a template

263
00:14:28,054 --> 00:14:30,416
and you look at the margins on the template, that you have to

264
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:31,417
follow the margin on the template.

265
00:14:31,793 --> 00:14:35,515
exactly and that the stats on the left won't work to get you there.

266
00:14:36,155 --> 00:14:39,757
And from there we got into, I talked to a printer friend of mine at the university,

267
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,658
and he took me back to my old days when I was working in print and said,

268
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:45,840
oh well you know there's bleed and no bleed printing by the way,

269
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,760
and so when you are going to...

270
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:54,326
print in bulk, it's actually going to change the way apparently the game crafter is going to do this.

271
00:14:54,566 --> 00:15:01,052
So there's a page actually in Help that they talk about in detail that we found months later.

272
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:03,074
This might not even have been up when we first looked.

273
00:15:03,355 --> 00:15:06,958
They talk about the registration settings and all this, but we had no idea even to look.

274
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:07,699
for

275
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:09,019
this kind of thing.

276
00:15:30,984 --> 00:15:33,625
And now the game is out, and this is fixed,

277
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:35,406
and we fixed the 10 copies we got back.

278
00:15:35,506 --> 00:15:37,187
But for anyone who's going to look at this,

279
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:40,308
you want to get into the details of how

280
00:15:40,328 --> 00:15:41,949
to work with things like the difference

281
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:44,090
between getting a proof copy, which is not a proof copy,

282
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,791
and how that can change in scale,

283
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:49,113
and in particular, into some of these printing aspects.

284
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:50,913
So a proof copy will not clue you in.

285
00:15:51,213 --> 00:15:52,254
Plan for the greedy grabber.

286
00:15:53,254 --> 00:15:54,195
That's case study one.

287
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:57,656
This is the case of don't eat this game.

288
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,341
And so I'm not an attorney.

289
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:02,762
This is not legal advice.

290
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:05,023
If you want that, you need to seek out an attorney.

291
00:16:05,283 --> 00:16:06,745
This is a story about what I researched

292
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:07,705
and then decided to do.

293
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:09,667
And I hope that it's informing for you

294
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:11,868
when you're working in print on demand.

295
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:13,669
So this is part of the page

296
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,351
of Lost and Found the Strategy Game.

297
00:16:15,371 --> 00:16:17,812
And if you go into the text a little deeper,

298
00:16:18,013 --> 00:16:19,093
you'll see we have a line that says,

299
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:21,535
may contain inks that should not be ingested,

300
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:24,217
not suitable for children younger than 14 years.

301
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:26,679
Is anyone familiar with this issue of testing?

302
00:16:27,388 --> 00:16:27,969
A couple people.

303
00:16:28,469 --> 00:16:28,670
Great.

304
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,613
So 14 years is our text.

305
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:33,536
And then you'll actually see a button from the Game Crafter

306
00:16:33,556 --> 00:16:34,096
that says 12 plus.

307
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,789
So what are we talking, what is this all about?

308
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:40,770
Well, it has to do with the hazards to children and players

309
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,291
such that anything from a small sharp piece

310
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,372
to an untested ink in the card,

311
00:16:45,412 --> 00:16:48,334
imagine you have a printer overseas or even here.

312
00:16:48,914 --> 00:16:50,154
Well, if you don't test the inks

313
00:16:50,735 --> 00:16:52,015
with an independent laboratory,

314
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:53,816
they could have lead in them, for example.

315
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:56,617
And if an overzealous player or child decides

316
00:16:56,657 --> 00:16:58,398
to chew on a card, right, you're in trouble,

317
00:16:58,438 --> 00:16:59,078
you get the picture.

318
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,499
So we started to look at

319
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,926
We dug into this working with Ryan Muskoff and working with Matthew Fassman,

320
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:11,832
started to dig into the Consumer Product Safety Commission regarding third-party testing,

321
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:14,755
and they're saying, well, you don't have to test if it's children 12 and under.

322
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:20,099
But actually, we further researched to look at our responsibility and liability potential,

323
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,821
and we talked to other game designers.

324
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:25,444
And our target audience is high school and up, including undergraduates.

325
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:30,268
We wanted games that were sophisticated enough to have undergraduates engaged in play, but

326
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:32,510
for it to be accessible to high school students.

327
00:17:33,331 --> 00:17:36,574
The regulations are actually complex and ambiguous,

328
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:39,676
and in some ways, we decided to err on the side of caution

329
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,179
by including an age restriction in the marketing and merchandising of the game.

330
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:47,502
So we're not going to read all that, but we went through this with a fine-tooth comb.

331
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,604
And the Game Crafter actually says they don't do lab testing.

332
00:17:51,345 --> 00:17:55,288
If you go do pricing for lab testing, it's maybe in the $3,000, $5,000 range,

333
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:58,230
maybe in the $1,000, depending on the lab or the kinds of tests that you're going to...

334
00:17:59,051 --> 00:18:03,715
And the game crafter says, we don't do it, we don't make games for kids.

335
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:07,238
And then their definition is 12 and under.

336
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:10,901
And so I spent a lot of time talking to labs.

337
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:16,265
Now the actual standard actually makes reference to 14 years of age in addition to mandatory

338
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:17,846
testing for 12-year-olds.

339
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:21,809
And so we picked 14 as the age cutoff.

340
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,132
14 is, for us, the most relevant standard for our product.

341
00:18:26,713 --> 00:18:31,238
And GameCrafter only offers badges for 12+, because of their reading of the regulation,

342
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:35,323
and 18+, for mature games, I guess.

343
00:18:35,683 --> 00:18:38,867
But our boxed text and our actual boxes, they're marked for 14 and over.

344
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:46,040
So what I decided for myself, we also got product liability insurance, and we work with

345
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,144
Magic Spell Studios to do that, and I had one designer say, you must get product liability

346
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:51,544
insurance.

347
00:18:51,584 --> 00:18:56,689
So we went ahead and got that, and I would say know the limits of the print-on-demand

348
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:00,912
up front and plan for them, and check the relevant regulations, and confer with other

349
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,514
people who've done it before, and just plan accordingly for this.

350
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:09,097
And there are hundreds and hundreds of games available on print-on-demand, and I think

351
00:19:09,137 --> 00:19:10,639
many of them don't take this into account.

352
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,385
But because we dug into it for so long, I wanted to share that with you and kind of

353
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:19,370
the thoughts about how to take this, I think, you know, more safely to market.

354
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,862
This is called the curious case of the sand timer that grew.

355
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:28,825
We, in the party game, we have this,

356
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:31,666
you can dial down or dial up the time

357
00:19:31,907 --> 00:19:33,868
for how long people are gonna have to tell their story with.

358
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:35,509
And so we said, man, it would be great

359
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,810
if we could put a timer in the box.

360
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,151
So we said, all right, well, the timer,

361
00:19:39,491 --> 00:19:41,012
they have all these amazing pieces

362
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:42,193
that you can put into your games,

363
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:43,013
and it's about $2.30.

364
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:46,415
So we said, all right, let's do that.

365
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:48,837
And then the cascading decisions start to come.

366
00:19:49,197 --> 00:19:51,919
As we know with coding, also the case with print on demand.

367
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,682
So we had a medium-sized box, and then we actually have to,

368
00:19:55,702 --> 00:19:57,844
yeah, got to count the cards and figure out how many cards

369
00:19:57,884 --> 00:20:01,267
can fit in the box, and could we fit the timer in the box?

370
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:03,529
And so we're sitting there, you know, stacking cards

371
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,430
and counting cards and figuring out the dimensions

372
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,792
and doing all this, and we eventually figure out

373
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:09,794
that if we get the timer, we're going to actually have

374
00:20:09,814 --> 00:20:11,035
to go up and box size.

375
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:13,757
And if we go up and box size, you're going to have

376
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,538
to buy the bottom box and the top box

377
00:20:15,618 --> 00:20:17,780
and a wrap for the images on it.

378
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:22,324
And the process kind of expands with that timer.

379
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:25,106
And so the timer increase to produce the game

380
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:27,849
went from $2.30 for the timer, an additional $3

381
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:30,170
in increase in box cost, and then we

382
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,053
were going to have to redesign all of our box layouts.

383
00:20:33,673 --> 00:20:36,796
And so we decided people could use their watch.

384
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,098
Because for a game in the $30 to $35 range,

385
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:40,699
I'm not adding $6 to the purchase price for a timer.

386
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,930
So that's the case of the timer that grew.

387
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,471
So the cascading decisions that happen when you're trying

388
00:20:49,491 --> 00:20:51,412
to make small changes, because they're going to have all

389
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:52,732
these physical effects as well.

390
00:20:53,392 --> 00:20:57,173
So using print on demand in the design studio and in

391
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,294
research for the field allows us to do things that we

392
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:00,735
wouldn't normally be able to do.

393
00:21:01,115 --> 00:21:03,656
and testing games with people with artwork

394
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:07,057
and being able to print some of the prose that we went over earlier.

395
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:09,818
Now, in the game design classroom, I use it for things like,

396
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:12,458
okay, you're a producer, what are your milestones?

397
00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:13,459
What are your deliverables?

398
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:15,700
And how are you going to backwards plan to get there?

399
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,660
So you've got to budget your pieces and you have to know

400
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,641
are you going to put a timer in that box or not?

401
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:22,482
And my colleague, Ian Schreiber,

402
00:21:23,302 --> 00:21:24,983
they usually get a price that they need to hit

403
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:27,363
and it's a pretty low price and then they can usually barter.

404
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:30,464
They can usually pitch to us as producers to say,

405
00:21:30,504 --> 00:21:32,485
do they get a couple more bucks on their budget?

406
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,286
So they're budgeting as well.

407
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:37,287
So I find it particularly helpful when thinking about

408
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:39,748
what does it mean to get something into the hands of a player

409
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:42,129
and that process of backwards planning and producing.

410
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:45,030
So there are benefits to doing it that way.

411
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,291
So some takeaways, and I also want to open it up to questions.

412
00:21:51,242 --> 00:21:53,564
Plan ahead, learn the details of the print-on-demand system.

413
00:21:54,084 --> 00:21:58,168
Weigh that decision of are you going to go digital, analog, print-on-demand, mix?

414
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:03,352
Keep an eye on the differences in single proofing versus volume,

415
00:22:03,912 --> 00:22:06,194
with the case of the greedy grabber regarding printer differences.

416
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,937
Realize that small shifts and changes will have ripples

417
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:12,239
in terms of formatting and cost.

418
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,781
And please, don't eat the game.

419
00:22:15,022 --> 00:22:17,323
That would be my probably number one request.

420
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:19,786
Thank you very much.

421
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:20,926
That's the formal piece.

422
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:25,350
And so I'd love to entertain questions about print on demand because I could talk about

423
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,191
this for a very long time.

424
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,733
But I wanted to make an opportunity to converse with you.

425
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:39,382
If you can come to the center and speak to the mic, that's the best way to get your question.

426
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:40,523
And then I'll repeat the question.

427
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:48,756
So yeah, Kevin O'Gorman, I teach at the Art Institute of Dallas and Richland College, also in Dallas.

428
00:22:49,898 --> 00:22:56,765
And just to back your play here, I've been doing this for a year, and just to commiserate with the Game Crafter.

429
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:04,421
Another cautionary tale, I had worked on a tabletop game for two years design-wise and

430
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:11,323
getting, buying myself the prototypes as we iterated along and had it down to the final

431
00:23:11,363 --> 00:23:16,184
stretch and it was a tile-based game so I was using the literally you know like drink coaster

432
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:17,585
thick tiles and stuff.

433
00:23:18,603 --> 00:23:25,665
Right when GameCrafter switched from the die cut method to the laser cut for the giant

434
00:23:25,685 --> 00:23:26,466
slugs for those.

435
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:31,247
And so up until then, they would die cut and bag the tiles.

436
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:36,729
And right when I was ready to design the box and go for it, they switched to laser cut,

437
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:41,131
which meant they left them unpunched in the slugs.

438
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:45,212
And so my game no longer fit in the small box because I had sheets.

439
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,723
And so I actually did call them and begged and pleaded.

440
00:23:48,743 --> 00:23:49,566
What's their phone number?

441
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:56,822
Well, I shot him an email and then ran into them at a board game conference and stuff.

442
00:23:56,842 --> 00:23:59,003
So I, you know, harassed them.

443
00:23:59,904 --> 00:24:01,804
And they said there was really nothing they could do about it.

444
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:07,207
And so I actually had to switch from the, like, coaster style tiles to card thickness,

445
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:13,489
square cards, to replace the tiles just to maintain my footprint in the box.

446
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:14,430
Yeah.

447
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,590
So that does happen.

448
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,151
So I was going to say, you know, there's the great benefit.

449
00:24:19,451 --> 00:24:21,872
You know, I couldn't do this without GameCrafter,

450
00:24:21,912 --> 00:24:25,152
and so I have tremendous, you know, love for their product

451
00:24:25,192 --> 00:24:26,293
and their service and what they do.

452
00:24:26,873 --> 00:24:29,633
And because of what they're doing, right,

453
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:31,134
we have to deal with some of these things.

454
00:24:31,174 --> 00:24:32,934
And it's probably through our community

455
00:24:33,174 --> 00:24:35,695
where we're sharing these things and trying to plan ahead

456
00:24:35,735 --> 00:24:37,435
and trying to test things that we'll get there.

457
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:37,575
So...

458
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:46,179
I think using a service like this has benefits and drawbacks, but I'm much happier with the benefits than I am, you know, upset about the drawbacks.

459
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:46,779
But they're tough.

460
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:57,783
Yeah, and the whole idea of, I do the same thing, my students, their classwork has to be GameCrafter ready, like you were saying, but I don't require them.

461
00:24:57,843 --> 00:25:03,845
But I've had two students, you know, publish their stuff on the GameCrafter, so it does work.

462
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,251
I'm getting a minute warning, I'm trying to see it in the back.

463
00:25:07,811 --> 00:25:08,812
Yes, thank you very much.

464
00:25:09,492 --> 00:25:13,573
I'm going to be around afterwards in the after area and I'm happy to talk to people out there.

465
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:14,254
Yes, hi.

466
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,614
Hi, I just got one question.

467
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:24,857
I'm working myself for a board game publisher in Poland and run game jams and this kind

468
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:26,818
of courses with the universities.

469
00:25:27,518 --> 00:25:34,286
Is there a big problem for you to reach out for professional publisher help?

470
00:25:34,526 --> 00:25:44,978
All these problems, it's my first lesson that I teach on my course for board game development process.

471
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:49,900
So this could, I could also help you in some kind. Is there a very big

472
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:57,182
big distance between publishing business and education?

473
00:25:57,242 --> 00:26:02,783
In Europe, yeah, like in Europe, we don't have this. What's this difficulty in the US?

474
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:05,444
Well, we probably have millions of people trying to go to,

475
00:26:05,704 --> 00:26:08,705
my guess is millions of people trying to go to individual publishers,

476
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:11,105
so kind of like trying to break into Hollywood studios.

477
00:26:11,145 --> 00:26:14,806
And so I think my perception is until you have very high sales,

478
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:19,067
like for example, The Captain is Dead has thousands and thousands of sales

479
00:26:19,107 --> 00:26:21,168
and they were then, they pitched to I think Eon Games.

480
00:26:21,668 --> 00:26:23,268
But I think the difference between making a game

481
00:26:23,588 --> 00:26:25,109
and showing that it's viable in the market

482
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:28,449
is probably part of what is the distance between a publisher

483
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:29,630
that'll say, well, take your game

484
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,870
versus the hundreds and hundreds of other people

485
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,830
who are trying to pitch their games.

486
00:26:33,531 --> 00:26:34,552
That's my guess.

487
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:36,914
You're guessing, yeah?

488
00:26:37,114 --> 00:26:42,839
Because, for example, the game that was launched on My Game Jam two years ago

489
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:44,420
now hit the market.

490
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:51,946
And meanwhile, we had games that, for example, Nemesis Campaign reached $4 million on Kickstarter.

491
00:26:52,287 --> 00:26:53,448
So we can...

492
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:56,150
Those are proven financially. They've made $4 million.

493
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:03,813
Yes, but also we have space after launching that successful campaign to collaborate with

494
00:27:03,893 --> 00:27:12,996
universities just to teach our future employees that we can start out while cooperating with

495
00:27:13,316 --> 00:27:14,236
educational business.

496
00:27:14,336 --> 00:27:16,757
It would be great to potentially collaborate.

497
00:27:16,797 --> 00:27:20,579
This is mutually beneficial, so reach out for these professionals.

498
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:23,440
Not everyone is as open as me coming here.

499
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,760
You don't leave after this.

500
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,361
Give me your car.

501
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:26,141
We'll collaborate.

502
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:28,463
But I think this is what happens at GDC, is the chance

503
00:27:28,503 --> 00:27:31,524
to collaborate and maybe break through what seems to be a

504
00:27:31,564 --> 00:27:32,945
barrier that doesn't need to be.

505
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:34,406
So I look forward to talking to you.

506
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:36,247
Thank you for bringing that.

507
00:27:37,228 --> 00:27:39,889
I've got, I think, three minutes left on the clock.

508
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,331
Other questions about any aspect of this?

509
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:45,333
I'd love to entertain a couple more questions.

510
00:27:45,952 --> 00:27:52,134
Yes, I have a question. Jose Zagal, University of Utah. So in academia, we're also tied to

511
00:27:52,234 --> 00:27:55,415
semesters or quarters and there's sort of timeliness factors. So I was wondering if you

512
00:27:55,455 --> 00:27:59,856
could comment on how this print on demand and doing all these cycles, how you made that

513
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:01,797
work in the context of semesters or the academic year?

514
00:28:02,104 --> 00:28:02,785
Yes, thank you.

515
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:06,449
So, and we're starting to, a couple people have started to talk about it, about not saying

516
00:28:06,469 --> 00:28:10,693
you have to take this to market, but that you go through the process of budgeting and

517
00:28:10,714 --> 00:28:12,155
then getting stuff ready to print.

518
00:28:12,596 --> 00:28:13,497
And I do a couple things.

519
00:28:13,637 --> 00:28:19,703
I did, there was a talk, my material was in a couple years ago here, about doing non-binding

520
00:28:20,044 --> 00:28:20,945
agreements on teams.

521
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:24,827
around IP, so at RIT all the students own their IP.

522
00:28:25,187 --> 00:28:28,888
So I have them do a non-binding agreement about how they would carry it forward past

523
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:29,428
the class.

524
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:34,530
I have them scope down so that they're going to actually produce the game in about four

525
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,311
to five weeks, very short, and get it ready to print.

526
00:28:37,571 --> 00:28:39,812
And then I say, okay, and then continue your playtesting.

527
00:28:39,832 --> 00:28:43,594
Maybe you take it to Protospiel, which my colleague Ian Schreiber turned us on to.

528
00:28:44,214 --> 00:28:48,175
Continue playtesting, continue working, but do you know at a certain point you could hit

529
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:49,476
the button and put it to market.

530
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:52,377
So it's chunked that way.

531
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,538
And also I talk to them about scope,

532
00:28:54,578 --> 00:28:56,519
about what type of game are you doing?

533
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,720
If you're doing a sprawling dungeon crawler

534
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,240
and it takes two and a half hours to play,

535
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,641
it could be harder to get playtests in in time.

536
00:29:03,682 --> 00:29:06,022
So I try to get them to scope for that.

537
00:29:06,223 --> 00:29:07,863
I'm sorry, it says one minute, I think.

538
00:29:08,103 --> 00:29:09,004
So I try to get them to scope.

539
00:29:09,024 --> 00:29:11,605
So I'd say scope, they don't have to print then,

540
00:29:11,665 --> 00:29:13,305
they have to think about and plan for

541
00:29:13,325 --> 00:29:14,986
what it would mean to print the next term

542
00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:18,147
to give them the path to access that.

543
00:29:18,187 --> 00:29:18,888
And the hope is that.

544
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:23,572
Some of them are going to go forward and it'll become their portfolio piece, or they might

545
00:29:23,592 --> 00:29:24,733
then pitch a publisher with it.

546
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:28,716
I usually have them list what are the three publishers you want to reach out to with this

547
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:32,420
game and go pitch to that publisher now that you've got a prototype, that kind of thing.

548
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:32,560
Cool.

549
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:32,960
Thank you.

550
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:33,741
You're welcome.

551
00:29:34,962 --> 00:29:36,283
Do we have time for one more or are we done?

552
00:29:36,303 --> 00:29:40,187
I think he said one more.

553
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:40,898
Okay, great.

554
00:29:41,858 --> 00:29:47,380
And so my question was, I saw you mentioned doing like playtesting with the print on demand.

555
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:53,422
What's sort of the cutoff point when you go from hand-making your playtesting materials

556
00:29:53,882 --> 00:29:55,503
and when do you go to printing them?

557
00:29:55,923 --> 00:29:56,883
That's a tough question.

558
00:29:56,903 --> 00:30:01,125
I would say we probably did from printing from spreadsheet to cards and PowerPoint.

559
00:30:02,295 --> 00:30:05,377
In the Lost and Found games, maybe 60, 70 of those before,

560
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:08,139
we were parallel working with the artist team

561
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,500
at the same time and then said, all right,

562
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,282
now let's, we feel like we've gotten the showstoppers gone,

563
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:12,983
now let's try.

564
00:30:13,003 --> 00:30:14,744
So it was kind of feeling for the play

565
00:30:14,764 --> 00:30:16,065
and that the play tests were at the point

566
00:30:16,385 --> 00:30:19,287
where players were responding in the realm we wanted them to

567
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:21,909
and we wanted to get the artwork together.

568
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:23,850
We were also forced because we were on a budget.

569
00:30:24,211 --> 00:30:25,411
So our budget was gonna say, look,

570
00:30:25,431 --> 00:30:26,832
you have that much time to get it done.

571
00:30:26,852 --> 00:30:27,793
So the budget pushed us.

572
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:33,058
Ian always says, you know, the game is never done, it's done when you stop.

573
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:37,543
So a combination of the financial pressure of a budget and time like a semester

574
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,766
and how the playtests are going was how we made that decision.

575
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:41,346
Thank you.

576
00:30:41,547 --> 00:30:41,987
You're welcome.

577
00:30:42,568 --> 00:30:44,189
Alright, thank you very much everybody.

578
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:49,475
I'll be outside and happy to talk more about this with you.
