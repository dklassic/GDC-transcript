1
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:08,892
So thanks very much for coming.

2
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:10,293
Really appreciate it.

3
00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:11,513
My name's Joe.

4
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:13,694
I'm co-founder of Inkle.

5
00:00:13,694 --> 00:00:16,035
We're an independent studio based here,

6
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:20,097
not based here, based in Cambridge in the UK.

7
00:00:20,097 --> 00:00:21,938
We specialize in narrative.

8
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:25,079
So we like to tell good stories.

9
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:26,400
That's basically it.

10
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:34,330
So up until now, we've primarily worked in the area of interactive fiction.

11
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:40,153
Inkle's over five years old now, and right from the start,

12
00:00:40,153 --> 00:00:43,194
our focus has been to take interactive fiction,

13
00:00:43,194 --> 00:00:46,536
which we believe to be this really rich medium,

14
00:00:46,536 --> 00:00:51,438
and make it a bit more just accessible for both gamers and non-gamers alike,

15
00:00:51,438 --> 00:00:52,359
because interactive fiction is...

16
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:56,400
a beautiful medium and can do some amazing things,

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,781
but not everyone has the inclination

18
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:02,902
to use a Pazer-based game.

19
00:01:02,902 --> 00:01:04,643
It's quite hard to get into.

20
00:01:04,643 --> 00:01:06,904
So this is a clip from 80 Days,

21
00:01:06,904 --> 00:01:12,206
which is perhaps our most well-known game to date

22
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,106
along with the Sorcery series.

23
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:18,088
And as you can see, it has this prose-based flow

24
00:01:18,088 --> 00:01:18,768
at its heart.

25
00:01:20,068 --> 00:01:21,669
You could call it the core game loop.

26
00:01:21,669 --> 00:01:23,969
It's, in Halo terminology, you could call it

27
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:25,810
the kind of the 30 seconds of fun.

28
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,890
And there is the wider game, of course.

29
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,891
There's a whole kind of board game-like layer

30
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,691
where you can explore any way you want to go.

31
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:37,552
There's almost 200 cities in the game,

32
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:39,392
and you can go around the world any way you like.

33
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:41,113
So there is the strategic layer.

34
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:45,053
But at its core, at its heart, is the narrative.

35
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:52,260
And so clearly narrative is really important to us.

36
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,362
In fact, it's so important that we built our own scripting

37
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:58,685
language for it, our own narrative scripting language,

38
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,606
which we call Ink.

39
00:02:00,606 --> 00:02:03,308
And all of our games so far, including 80 Days,

40
00:02:03,308 --> 00:02:04,509
were written in Ink.

41
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:07,811
And in fact, Ink is a language that we open sourced

42
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:09,312
last year at GDC.

43
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:14,917
And it's gone on to be used in a few projects that we're

44
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,458
really excited to see, actually.

45
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:25,246
So this is what seeing a city in 80 days looks like in ink.

46
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:26,687
You don't need to obviously read all the text,

47
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:29,870
but if you just pay attention to the rough ratio

48
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,133
between just the prose, the core text,

49
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:35,234
and all the little colored bits,

50
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:37,136
so the blue and the green,

51
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:39,859
they're the syntax and the logic which drive it.

52
00:02:40,654 --> 00:02:42,955
And if you look at the ratio between those two things,

53
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:47,316
it really is focusing on the core text flow.

54
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:50,456
It's allowing writers to just focus on the writing

55
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:52,717
with just this lightweight markup

56
00:02:52,717 --> 00:02:55,858
to add the layer of interactivity.

57
00:02:55,858 --> 00:02:57,578
So we sort of like to think of it as

58
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:00,559
markdown for interactive text.

59
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,213
But now we're making a game that looks more like this,

60
00:03:06,213 --> 00:03:08,454
which I'm really super excited to show you

61
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,455
because this is actually the first time

62
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:12,237
that we've talked about it publicly.

63
00:03:12,237 --> 00:03:13,658
This is Heaven's Vault.

64
00:03:14,623 --> 00:03:20,148
It's a science fiction adventure featuring an archaeologist called

65
00:03:20,148 --> 00:03:24,611
Aaliyah Elazra, or El to her friends. It's set in a beautiful nebula

66
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:31,917
scattered with the ancient ruins of a lost civilization. The player can fly anywhere between different moons,

67
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:33,339
explore

68
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:34,940
ruined cities,

69
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,621
explore dig sites,

70
00:03:36,621 --> 00:03:38,203
uncover

71
00:03:38,203 --> 00:03:42,466
lost artifacts, with the story constantly unfolding around them as they go.

72
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:46,569
And they can go between not just these kind of desolate locations,

73
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:54,033
but also bustling markets and places with loads of different interesting characters to talk to.

74
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,175
And so as you can see, it's a lot more graphical.

75
00:03:56,175 --> 00:03:59,977
This is actually a real screenshot from the game with just the text overlaid.

76
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:05,361
So we have 3D worlds, we have 2D characters,

77
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:08,343
and the structure superficially,

78
00:04:08,343 --> 00:04:09,844
it kind of resembles a point and click

79
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:12,206
in that you can explore a space,

80
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:14,728
you can interact with props and objects,

81
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:15,909
and you can talk to characters.

82
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:20,332
And the text is presented

83
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:22,353
as kind of lightweight dialogue bubbles,

84
00:04:22,353 --> 00:04:25,135
and occasionally we also have narrated audio sections.

85
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:30,873
But fundamentally, we're authoring this in exactly the same way as at 80 Days.

86
00:04:30,873 --> 00:04:35,235
So we still have this, basically a text adventure going on underneath the game

87
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:37,856
that's kind of behind the scenes driving what happens in the game.

88
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:38,436
So back to the talk's title.

89
00:04:38,436 --> 00:04:39,937
What do I mean by an interactive film script?

90
00:04:47,436 --> 00:04:51,918
So whereas 80 Days had that prose-based flow

91
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,578
that it was like writing a novel

92
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:56,199
with a bit of interactive markup.

93
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,780
Similarly, Heaven's Vault is more like

94
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,581
an interactive film script.

95
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:03,823
So it has a film script, but with interactive markup,

96
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:05,923
which changes the direction of the way

97
00:05:05,923 --> 00:05:07,404
that the script flows.

98
00:05:08,456 --> 00:05:11,718
and as it plays behind the scene it sort of generates

99
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:13,459
as you make choices through the game.

100
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:15,560
It generates more of a linear film script

101
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,802
which drives the action in the game.

102
00:05:17,802 --> 00:05:21,124
And that sort of becomes like our blueprint

103
00:05:21,124 --> 00:05:23,525
or the blueprint for what happens in the game.

104
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:26,507
So if we look at an example of a real film script,

105
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:29,749
so this is page 24 from the screenplay of 2001 A Space Odyssey

106
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:37,175
As well as the lines of dialogue, which are in the format you can see at the top,

107
00:05:37,175 --> 00:05:40,776
there are also instructions about how the scene is structured,

108
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:45,398
and even editing decisions like that dissolve 2,

109
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:50,319
which says exactly how the scene should be cut together in the final edit.

110
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:55,902
And in the same way, the Heaven's Vault script

111
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:58,906
has a mixture of dialogue, it has a bit of narration,

112
00:05:58,906 --> 00:06:00,688
and it also has those instructions,

113
00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:04,173
and those can be both interactive,

114
00:06:04,173 --> 00:06:06,536
so the choices that you make through the scene,

115
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:08,398
but also just things like that,

116
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:10,781
just the information about some of the transitions.

117
00:06:11,943 --> 00:06:16,426
Now I should say we're well aware of the dangers of getting too obsessed with the film industry

118
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:20,850
and I know that a lot of game developers can be quite susceptible to it.

119
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:26,014
So I would just like to say it is just a cute metaphor but it's quite a useful one nonetheless.

120
00:06:29,516 --> 00:06:31,237
So first of all, what I want to do

121
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:35,838
is demonstrate exactly what a script editing workflow

122
00:06:35,838 --> 00:06:39,319
actually looks like using our ink editing tool, which

123
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,221
is called Inky, which is also the name of my neighbor's cat.

124
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:46,061
It's just a bit of fun.

125
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:49,242
Ink is a custom Ink script writing tool

126
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,902
that we built in the past year that's also open source,

127
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:55,803
along with the Ink language.

128
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:58,164
But with the main benefit that you can play as you write.

129
00:06:58,164 --> 00:06:59,444
So I'll show you in a moment.

130
00:06:59,444 --> 00:07:02,904
There are two panes, basically, one with the written text

131
00:07:02,904 --> 00:07:06,025
and one with the text flow that you're playing through

132
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:06,625
and making choices.

133
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,025
And I should also.

134
00:07:11,187 --> 00:07:13,748
warn you that you might have heard of programmer art.

135
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:15,488
Well, this is going to be programmer writing.

136
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:16,729
So I do apologize for that.

137
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:19,130
So here we go.

138
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,971
This is just a quick example using the character

139
00:07:21,971 --> 00:07:25,232
names from Heaven's Vault. So there's L and 6,

140
00:07:25,232 --> 00:07:27,313
her robot sidekick.

141
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,374
And so far, this example has just got dialogue.

142
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:31,354
It's got dialogue.

143
00:07:31,354 --> 00:07:32,435
It's got a few choices.

144
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,752
We can see an example of making a choice,

145
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:42,475
and you can see what happens as it drills

146
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:46,398
into those kind of bullet points which form the choices.

147
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:48,781
So that's the kind of the linear film script

148
00:07:48,781 --> 00:07:51,223
on the right-hand side that's generated

149
00:07:51,223 --> 00:07:55,187
and that drives the machinery of what happens in the game.

150
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:59,705
And we have a custom and quite a simple, actually,

151
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:02,627
interpreter for how to interpret that text behind the scenes

152
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:08,090
and produce the visual game, which I'll show you right now.

153
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,572
So this is from the same script.

154
00:08:11,572 --> 00:08:12,633
Here, you can see we've got the 3D environments.

155
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:14,394
We've got the 2D characters and the simple dialogue bubbles.

156
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,515
You can see what it looks like when you make choices.

157
00:08:28,327 --> 00:08:32,072
And by the way, this isn't even a real environment from the game.

158
00:08:32,072 --> 00:08:35,336
This is from a Unity sample environment

159
00:08:35,336 --> 00:08:36,718
that I've hacked up just to put the characters in.

160
00:08:36,718 --> 00:08:41,204
And as you can see, it's pretty simple stuff so far.

161
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:47,610
So this is just a literal piece of text

162
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,852
that gets passed straight through from the ink

163
00:08:50,852 --> 00:08:51,893
directly into the game.

164
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:54,955
And it's a really simple syntax, as you can see.

165
00:08:54,955 --> 00:08:57,056
We can just look for the position of the colon

166
00:08:57,056 --> 00:09:00,098
and separate it into which character is speaking

167
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:01,038
and what do they say.

168
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:04,548
Another cute thing that we do, and something

169
00:09:04,548 --> 00:09:06,109
that we've added to Ink in the last year,

170
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:10,111
is the ability to add hashtags to individual lines.

171
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:13,612
And what we're using this for here

172
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:15,953
is the ability to just put a little smiley on the end,

173
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:19,595
or an emoticon, and that will change the particular piece

174
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:21,996
of art that we show.

175
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:24,397
So we can put a little smiley on, on the end of the line,

176
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,018
and the character will smile.

177
00:09:27,018 --> 00:09:28,079
So we've got a whole range of emoticons

178
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:28,679
that we can use for that.

179
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:32,843
Something else we can do that's really,

180
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:34,324
a really very natural way to write,

181
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,705
but again, it's just part of the game-specific syntax.

182
00:09:36,705 --> 00:09:40,167
So we can put these parenthesized

183
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:42,008
little additional pieces of metadata

184
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:44,290
to just say, right, this character

185
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,591
is speaking to that character.

186
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:50,854
And in the case of our protagonist, when she speaks,

187
00:09:50,854 --> 00:09:53,155
most of the time she actually doesn't talk directly

188
00:09:53,155 --> 00:09:56,917
to the sidekick robot because actually she's a bit aloof

189
00:09:56,917 --> 00:10:00,599
and she's actually more interested in the environment.

190
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,520
So she kind of looks out into the world,

191
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,521
she talks to Six and he's there,

192
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,403
he looks at her by default.

193
00:10:06,403 --> 00:10:09,985
But if we really want her to go and turn and look at him,

194
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:10,925
then we can do that as well.

195
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,552
And then we could also change the pose.

196
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:20,813
So when you put that in parentheses,

197
00:10:20,813 --> 00:10:22,954
it will just choose a particular piece of art

198
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:27,416
that our artist has drawn for that particular moment.

199
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:30,618
And it's just really easy and natural to write this stuff.

200
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:36,024
And here's a genuine piece of ink syntax, finally.

201
00:10:36,024 --> 00:10:39,386
When you put an asterisk on the front, just adding that

202
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:42,488
one thing will turn that line of dialogue into a choice.

203
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:46,351
So we'll have a number of choices that look like that.

204
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:48,712
And when you pick that line, that's what

205
00:10:48,712 --> 00:10:50,153
the character will say.

206
00:10:50,153 --> 00:10:55,396
But what happens if you have a choice with a character name

207
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:57,798
that isn't your character, that isn't the protagonist?

208
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:02,959
well, they also get the opportunity to say a line.

209
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,542
And so whereas previously we were always

210
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:11,285
using choices in the ink to allow the player to make

211
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:14,247
choices in the game, we can also provide choices

212
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:16,749
to allow other characters to contribute.

213
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:18,450
And so what we use this for is a kind of,

214
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,172
you've probably seen this in other games before,

215
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:24,334
when you have a timeout, when if you don't say anything,

216
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,996
then another character might interject with something.

217
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:33,392
So it's really simple to add these extra little details.

218
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,074
So all this dialogue is fine,

219
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:37,476
but what we'd really like our protagonist to be able to do

220
00:11:37,476 --> 00:11:38,457
is explore a scene now.

221
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:41,520
And that's not an obvious thing that you can do

222
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,882
in a text adventure, or at least not in a way

223
00:11:43,882 --> 00:11:48,166
that would synchronize with a 3D explorable space.

224
00:11:50,037 --> 00:11:53,098
So this can be modeled in ink as well, and what we do is

225
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:56,860
we take this idea of choices that aren't directly associated

226
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,922
with visible concrete choices that the player makes,

227
00:11:59,922 --> 00:12:02,043
and we use that.

228
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:04,044
So if you have a location that you want to walk to

229
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:06,966
on the ground, you can choose to walk in exactly

230
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:09,087
the same way that you would in any other game,

231
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,729
whether it's through direct control on the left stick

232
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:14,070
or by clicking on a marker within the world.

233
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,652
And what the game will do behind the scenes is it will say,

234
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:18,913
well, you made the choice to move.

235
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:22,296
Therefore, we will pick that move choice.

236
00:12:22,296 --> 00:12:27,620
And so the dash in the middle is a piece of ink syntax,

237
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,722
which is a way to control the flow.

238
00:12:30,722 --> 00:12:32,764
So once you've made a choice, then

239
00:12:32,764 --> 00:12:34,165
after you've made the choice, then it will.

240
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,407
it'll choose that as the point to go to,

241
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,568
to join the flow together.

242
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:40,589
So what's happening here is you could actually

243
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:43,051
put a piece of content in between

244
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:44,471
moving and arriving.

245
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:47,393
So the arrive choice is another choice,

246
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:49,094
but it's even less directly

247
00:12:49,094 --> 00:12:50,135
related to

248
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:53,077
the player making a specific decision,

249
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:54,658
and it's just something that

250
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:56,519
the game engine will tell

251
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,620
the ink engine to do

252
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,361
when you actually arrive at your

253
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:01,362
target destination.

254
00:13:02,102 --> 00:13:06,784
But in between, you might choose to say something or just

255
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:09,424
speak some lines of dialogue, or do anything else which is

256
00:13:09,424 --> 00:13:10,925
available within the story engine.

257
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:12,725
So here's a really simple example again.

258
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,072
You'll notice, by the way, that all of these examples

259
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:23,114
are extremely linear.

260
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:26,256
Obviously, this is purely for the sake of demonstrating.

261
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:28,598
So in the real example from the game,

262
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:30,800
you'd see a number of choices.

263
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,221
And actually, they stack up.

264
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:34,503
And we use quite complex ink constructs

265
00:13:34,503 --> 00:13:38,687
to inject choices from various places,

266
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,969
from various conversation topics that you

267
00:13:40,969 --> 00:13:42,410
might be able to have throughout the game.

268
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,412
But in this example, we're just going to explicitly give

269
00:13:45,412 --> 00:13:47,374
these particular choices.

270
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,391
So in this example, we've got a line of dialogue.

271
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:53,912
The player chooses to move somewhere.

272
00:13:53,912 --> 00:13:57,754
We don't actually care very much where they decide to move.

273
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,975
And we do have ways to query where the player is.

274
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:02,616
But most of the time, we actually don't.

275
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:05,277
We just want to know when they decide to move so that we can

276
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,557
decide to talk about something as they go.

277
00:14:06,557 --> 00:14:08,198
But actually, the destination isn't always the

278
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:09,579
most important thing.

279
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:10,659
So what does this look like in game?

280
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:12,020
We have a line of dialogue.

281
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:21,655
Now, in this example, we decide to move somewhere

282
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:23,397
by clicking on a spot on the ground.

283
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:25,798
They decide to talk about something on the way over there.

284
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,660
And once they've arrived,

285
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,642
they continue their conversation

286
00:14:30,642 --> 00:14:32,103
actually completely naturally

287
00:14:32,103 --> 00:14:35,565
because the game has automatically chosen an arrive choice

288
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:38,948
and seamlessly kind of gathered the flow back together

289
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:42,711
and taken it to the point after that arrive choice.

290
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:46,393
So what that allows us to do is actually insert

291
00:14:46,393 --> 00:14:49,155
arrived choices at various points in the flow

292
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,837
in order to catch different points

293
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:53,579
throughout the conversation where they might

294
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,641
naturally finish up their conversation.

295
00:14:58,969 --> 00:15:01,451
So next, we need to be able to interact with our environment,

296
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:03,193
not just walk around.

297
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,915
Interacting with objects or props

298
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:09,197
is really just a matter of adding more choices

299
00:15:09,197 --> 00:15:14,982
and using more game-specific syntax on top of the Ink Engine.

300
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,524
So again, we have choices, and we

301
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:20,807
have a really simple syntax of just having the object

302
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:22,808
name or the prop name and the action

303
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:23,689
that you want to do with it.

304
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:26,660
So on the left, we have two examples.

305
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,342
Either you can touch the wall or look at the view.

306
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:32,104
And the way we represent that in the game

307
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:35,768
is the object name is looked up as a game

308
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,789
object within the Unity scene.

309
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:41,312
And then the verb just becomes the label that's

310
00:15:41,312 --> 00:15:44,275
applied within the 3D space.

311
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:47,257
And then once you choose that, we just

312
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:48,579
carry on with the ink flow.

313
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:50,380
We have lines of dialogue or whatever we want to have.

314
00:15:52,176 --> 00:15:55,998
A more complex example that actually uses exactly the same system

315
00:15:55,998 --> 00:16:02,743
is that we can also do more complex navigation options like this.

316
00:16:02,743 --> 00:16:05,805
So most of the time when you're exploring the space,

317
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:10,228
like I said, you don't really care about exactly where the player is.

318
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:12,029
But when you really do care,

319
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:16,652
or if you want to insert some extra dialogue into the flow,

320
00:16:16,652 --> 00:16:18,273
you can mark up...

321
00:16:18,974 --> 00:16:22,942
a prop, so it looks like you're just interacting with an object in the distance, but actually

322
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:28,152
what you're doing is, the game presents that to the player as a navigation choice, just

323
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:28,914
like any other.

324
00:16:30,815 --> 00:16:37,841
Except now, but all you're doing is making a promise to the player with that style of choice that they will

325
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:42,225
Go somewhere at some point and so as an author you then have the opportunity

326
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:48,891
To insert a line of dialogue and then fulfill the promise by providing another kind of implicit choice

327
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:55,136
Which the game will automatically take in order to go to the the place where the player expected to go

328
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:02,190
So what does this look like in Inki?

329
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,532
Again, we've got a couple of simple examples.

330
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:10,015
You can see we can just make some simple choices

331
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:10,976
on the right-hand side.

332
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:13,478
And all of this stuff can be written completely

333
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:16,420
independently of the main game.

334
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,643
So a writer can get started with writing an entire scene

335
00:17:20,643 --> 00:17:22,264
before it even touches the game engine.

336
00:17:22,264 --> 00:17:23,124
And let's see what that looks like in game.

337
00:17:32,414 --> 00:17:34,736
So we've got this hotspot on the object with the verb

338
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:35,236
that we pick.

339
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:36,818
We have the line of dialogue.

340
00:17:36,818 --> 00:17:38,359
We then interact with the object again.

341
00:17:57,598 --> 00:17:59,821
And finally, we're going to have a navigation option that

342
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:01,923
looks just like the normal navigation option, which we

343
00:18:01,923 --> 00:18:05,608
would have had from a move choice, except this time she

344
00:18:05,608 --> 00:18:08,090
says a line of dialogue before she sets off.

345
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,335
So we can be really flexible in the way that we decide to

346
00:18:12,335 --> 00:18:12,876
set this up.

347
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:20,420
So within Heaven's Vault, we don't have full voiceover.

348
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,883
Most of the game is represented using those simple

349
00:18:22,883 --> 00:18:24,946
dialogue bubbles.

350
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:27,890
And the majority of the dialogue is presented that

351
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,736
way, but we do also provide the opportunity to

352
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:41,058
put sections of narration in with audio as well.

353
00:18:41,058 --> 00:18:43,341
So we have two different constructs.

354
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:45,845
We have narration that's presented as text.

355
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:50,051
And then we also have narration that can be presented as audio.

356
00:18:50,051 --> 00:18:52,174
And the text is hidden when we do that.

357
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:57,281
Again, we have another really simple syntax.

358
00:18:57,281 --> 00:18:59,623
We do mark these up using a triple chevron.

359
00:18:59,623 --> 00:19:02,345
But you could even, if this is purely a matter of taste,

360
00:19:02,345 --> 00:19:05,347
you could also just have normal narration

361
00:19:05,347 --> 00:19:06,208
without the triple chevron.

362
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,750
And that would just be like normal prose

363
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,291
that you might have had in 80 days.

364
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,373
It's just because it's actually quite rare in Heaven's Vault,

365
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:15,595
we prefer it to visually stand out on the page.

366
00:19:15,595 --> 00:19:17,496
So this is just our personal choice

367
00:19:17,496 --> 00:19:21,539
to add this extra syntax to make it more visible.

368
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,661
And then if we decide we want to have voiceover for that section,

369
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:31,302
then we can record a piece of audio and stick it on the end as a tag.

370
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:37,163
And so that tag is just metadata, a bit like the emoticons I showed you earlier.

371
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:41,884
And all it does is check to see whether the text within the tag has an audio file name,

372
00:19:41,884 --> 00:19:43,205
and then it will play that audio.

373
00:19:47,815 --> 00:19:53,717
Now we can also start to have more abstract scene instructions like you saw in the 2001

374
00:19:53,717 --> 00:19:54,218
example.

375
00:19:54,218 --> 00:20:02,981
So again with the triple chevron syntax we can also have bespoke camera shots where we

376
00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:06,682
position the camera at a particular angle within Unity.

377
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:08,282
We position characters, we give them bespoke art.

378
00:20:09,503 --> 00:20:11,865
Then we give that game object a name

379
00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:14,628
that contains all of this information within the scene.

380
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:15,548
And then we can trigger it.

381
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:20,253
And because it's all just referenced by name,

382
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:23,416
it's really flexible and easy to set this stuff up

383
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,057
on both ends independently.

384
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:29,962
So the writer, in this case, my co-founder, John Ingold,

385
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,603
is able to write a scene where he thinks,

386
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:33,285
oh, it might be nice to have a custom shot here.

387
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:35,608
He can name it.

388
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:38,913
And this is before we've even started building the scene.

389
00:20:38,913 --> 00:20:41,537
And that will just get passed through as straight text, so

390
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:43,500
that we know that that's something that

391
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,261
we need to author.

392
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:52,196
We can also, outside of shots, which are one specific case,

393
00:20:52,196 --> 00:20:54,377
we can also have the most generic case,

394
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:56,498
where we say something's happened.

395
00:20:56,498 --> 00:20:57,779
And that could trigger animations,

396
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:00,680
it could trigger more camera work,

397
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,201
or it could trigger sound effects,

398
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:04,962
particle effects, whatever we want.

399
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:06,602
But again, it's not really something

400
00:21:06,602 --> 00:21:10,024
that the writer wants to care about while they're writing.

401
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:12,045
They just know that something's happening,

402
00:21:12,045 --> 00:21:14,766
and so they write this scene instruction in.

403
00:21:23,668 --> 00:21:26,970
So let's jump into Inki for the last time

404
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:31,631
and see kind of an example of all of these concepts

405
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:32,591
working together.

406
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:36,473
So again, we have this Depart option.

407
00:21:36,473 --> 00:21:40,054
So that can be used as an instruction to the game

408
00:21:40,054 --> 00:21:42,215
to simply go somewhere.

409
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:43,675
And it is a choice, but it's a choice

410
00:21:43,675 --> 00:21:46,256
that the game will always take automatically if they see it.

411
00:21:46,256 --> 00:21:48,657
Then we have that example of narration

412
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:50,997
with the triple chevron.

413
00:21:52,822 --> 00:21:57,926
And finally, we have another choice and a few scene events

414
00:21:57,926 --> 00:22:01,288
that will kind of have a particular setup.

415
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:03,869
And finally, we have another narration example.

416
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:05,771
But in this example, we're going to have a bit of audio.

417
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:06,351
And let's see that in action.

418
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:07,191
So we get the line of dialogue.

419
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:23,763
This is the depart command being called and we have another line of dialogue from the

420
00:22:23,763 --> 00:22:29,964
robot and we have a piece of narration which is just represented as simple text on screen

421
00:22:29,964 --> 00:22:32,405
and this is the custom camera shot.

422
00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:35,725
We also have an event that fired switching on the light.

423
00:22:35,725 --> 00:22:39,146
We have a bit more dialogue and then we have another depart choice.

424
00:22:39,146 --> 00:22:42,926
We step between the rubble of fallen buildings.

425
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:47,607
Empty doorways opened onto the broken rooms.

426
00:22:49,627 --> 00:22:50,964
and that's how we do audio.

427
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:55,270
And that's basically how we're building the entirety

428
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,952
of Heaven's Vault with ink.

429
00:22:57,952 --> 00:23:00,413
It's all really built out of quite simple objects

430
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:04,457
that kind of combine together in more complex ways.

431
00:23:04,457 --> 00:23:07,839
And we are using more complex ink constructs

432
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,741
in order to weave all of this stuff together.

433
00:23:09,741 --> 00:23:16,366
But that pretty much is the gist of how we can build

434
00:23:16,366 --> 00:23:19,928
a fully 3D game using what's basically a text adventure

435
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:27,854
underneath. So John's really drafting a lot of scenes outside of the main game and slowly

436
00:23:27,854 --> 00:23:36,740
redrafting them until he can pass them on to a level designer, an artist. And then once

437
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,643
you've got the script and you've got a grey box environment, you can combine those together

438
00:23:40,643 --> 00:23:46,247
in quite simple ways, actually. Once you've got a grey box environment, it takes just

439
00:23:46,247 --> 00:23:48,889
about half an hour just to make sure that the props and the...

440
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:53,392
the waypoints that connect everything together all sync up.

441
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:56,514
And that allows us to iterate on scenes really quickly.

442
00:23:56,514 --> 00:23:58,715
It allows us to have independence

443
00:23:58,715 --> 00:24:04,919
between the writing process and the art and design process.

444
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,220
And it really is surprisingly straightforward.

445
00:24:08,726 --> 00:24:14,389
So if you want to hear a bit more about the way that John is constructing the open world

446
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:19,393
and the way that he, especially the way he did it for Sorcery, he's going to be talking

447
00:24:19,393 --> 00:24:22,755
about that tomorrow at 10am in room 2005, I think.

448
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:28,778
But otherwise, thanks for listening, and I think we've got a few minutes for questions.

449
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:39,767
Hello.

450
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:41,187
Hello.

451
00:24:41,187 --> 00:24:46,049
So, after your talk last year, I played around with ink for a bit on my own and actually

452
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:49,091
wrote my own parser off the language spec.

453
00:24:49,091 --> 00:24:55,273
And one of the things that I was trying to figure out how to do and it applies here especially

454
00:24:55,273 --> 00:25:01,836
is ink is great when it is in control of the narrative, where you are, where you are in

455
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:02,196
the...

456
00:25:03,825 --> 00:25:06,548
you know, along kind of a linear or a branching narrative.

457
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:11,855
But as soon as you get into a situation where you're provided with an environment

458
00:25:11,855 --> 00:25:16,180
where you could go to one of several places, you could go to like eight different,

459
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:21,547
let's say NPCs and stripe up a conversation with them depending on where you walk to in the world.

460
00:25:21,627 --> 00:25:27,709
I was wondering what your thoughts are on if you've tried to take ink and have multiple

461
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:35,232
entry points into different conversations while still maintaining your running game

462
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:43,235
state, which you're able to do normally in ink because you're also controlling the position

463
00:25:43,235 --> 00:25:43,815
in the narrative.

464
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:43,996
Yeah.

465
00:25:43,996 --> 00:25:44,036
So

466
00:25:49,362 --> 00:25:57,393
It's a difficult question to answer in the abstract in some ways because every game has

467
00:25:57,393 --> 00:26:03,501
different requirements in a way and the way that we're building that in Heaven's Vault,

468
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:03,681
we are...

469
00:26:05,225 --> 00:26:10,713
binding the ink with the game quite directly.

470
00:26:10,713 --> 00:26:12,917
But you could also imagine, so for example, in 80 Days,

471
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:16,382
we had the way that you go to cities in 80 Days

472
00:26:16,382 --> 00:26:20,188
is we didn't actually do that.

473
00:26:21,158 --> 00:26:22,979
entirely within the Ink Engine.

474
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:24,980
So we would have a JSON file that

475
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,621
specified all of the cities and the connections

476
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:28,982
between all the other cities.

477
00:26:28,982 --> 00:26:31,523
We could have modeled that using choices, for example.

478
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:34,044
So in your example, you could model

479
00:26:34,044 --> 00:26:37,826
going to talk to these different characters as a choice block.

480
00:26:37,826 --> 00:26:40,428
It would be quite a coded choice block that might.

481
00:26:42,288 --> 00:26:44,549
depend on certain conditions and things.

482
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:48,251
It's hard to understand your specific example, I think.

483
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:51,012
But you could model it as a choice block.

484
00:26:51,012 --> 00:26:53,373
So when you decide to go after this character,

485
00:26:53,373 --> 00:26:55,494
it actually takes a choice within the game,

486
00:26:55,494 --> 00:27:00,676
even if the player didn't specifically choose that.

487
00:27:00,676 --> 00:27:04,378
But yeah, there are quite a lot of different approaches.

488
00:27:04,378 --> 00:27:06,539
So maybe we could talk afterwards

489
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:07,399
and about your example.

490
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:08,200
Cool, thank you.

491
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:15,114
Hi, I'm just quite curious about on the other side,

492
00:27:15,114 --> 00:27:16,856
like the Unity side of all of this.

493
00:27:16,856 --> 00:27:20,959
Because for instance, you had a depart, and then another

494
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:23,761
depart, and then an event.

495
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:25,803
So for the writer, they can just write that.

496
00:27:25,803 --> 00:27:27,604
But how is on the other side?

497
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,166
Is each, for instance, the first and the second depart,

498
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:31,727
they worked quite differently.

499
00:27:31,727 --> 00:27:33,369
And of course, the event had the animation,

500
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:35,611
and the light switching on, and all of that work.

501
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:38,573
Are all of those hooks hard-coded specifically

502
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:38,833
to each?

503
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:41,658
thing or do you have like a dynamic system or?

504
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:48,682
So the syntax of the depart choice was simply that you have

505
00:27:48,682 --> 00:27:52,684
the location name, which is a waypoint within Unity,

506
00:27:52,684 --> 00:27:56,926
and then a dash, and then just the depart word.

507
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,847
That's all it is, really.

508
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:01,728
So when it sees that choice, there's a kind of a

509
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:09,295
an event loop in the game that looks at what choice is available and if there's a choice block

510
00:28:09,295 --> 00:28:14,400
and there is a depart within it, it will just do it immediately and it will instruct the character

511
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,665
to walk to that location. If the depart choice was missing then the rest of the choices might

512
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:21,666
become more relevant.

513
00:28:23,192 --> 00:28:24,212
Does that answer your question?

514
00:28:24,212 --> 00:28:26,815
And in the case of the event, that is more something

515
00:28:26,815 --> 00:28:28,356
that's kind of more.

516
00:28:28,356 --> 00:28:28,636
Right.

517
00:28:28,636 --> 00:28:32,819
So that, again, it's just a keyword, really.

518
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:38,864
It's just a tag, basically, that has got a specific name.

519
00:28:38,864 --> 00:28:40,105
It's just a string.

520
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:44,069
And we fire off an event using our own hand-rolled event

521
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:45,210
system in Unity.

522
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,331
And we have different types of objects

523
00:28:47,331 --> 00:28:51,195
that can respond to that named event and do different things.

524
00:28:51,195 --> 00:28:51,715
OK, cool.

525
00:28:51,715 --> 00:28:52,175
Thank you.

526
00:28:52,175 --> 00:28:52,576
Cool.

527
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,511
Okay, thank you very much.
