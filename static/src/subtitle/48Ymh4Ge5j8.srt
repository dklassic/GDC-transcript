1
00:00:07,544 --> 00:00:07,844
All right.

2
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:13,065
My name is Itai Karen.

3
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,806
I made a game called Mushroom 11,

4
00:00:15,506 --> 00:00:16,626
released a couple of years ago.

5
00:00:16,646 --> 00:00:21,088
It's a game with very peculiar and weird mechanics,

6
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:22,448
and even weirder bosses.

7
00:00:23,328 --> 00:00:27,289
I also made a research a couple of years ago on 2D cameras,

8
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:30,070
and I decided to combine my two passions

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,411
and try to create this retrospective of game bosses

10
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:36,572
and what we can learn from.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,192
using references from older to more modern games.

12
00:00:42,774 --> 00:00:45,416
So, what is a game boss?

13
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:49,098
A standard definition would look a little bit like this.

14
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:53,482
A significant computer-controlled enemy who must be defeated to achieve a goal or continue progress.

15
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:58,066
But we all know that the bosses that we remember and we like

16
00:00:58,246 --> 00:01:04,110
usually have one or more of these items as an exception to this rule.

17
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:09,131
From what I noticed, it is closer to just an epic

18
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:12,052
confrontation that serves as a microcosm of your game

19
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:14,414
while temporarily breaking its rules.

20
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,796
So the boss battle is definitely part of your game.

21
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:21,038
It needs to feel as part of the unit, which is your game.

22
00:01:21,418 --> 00:01:23,979
But it's uniquely qualified to break any and all of the rules.

23
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:27,762
Why do you need a boss?

24
00:01:28,442 --> 00:01:32,905
I basically look at it as four different sections.

25
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:33,865
Reward.

26
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:36,490
Take a break from normal gameplay and reward players'

27
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,671
persistence with a new experience and a chance

28
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:39,652
at a major triumph.

29
00:01:40,613 --> 00:01:43,434
Dazzle, surprise the player with an unexpected play experience.

30
00:01:43,554 --> 00:01:46,496
Engage, use the battle to advance the story

31
00:01:46,536 --> 00:01:47,937
or create an emotional attachment.

32
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:50,658
And challenge, of course, that test and acquire skill,

33
00:01:50,698 --> 00:01:55,180
introduce new skills in preparation for what's next.

34
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,641
And we're going to talk about all these.

35
00:01:59,063 --> 00:02:00,443
So shock and awe.

36
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:04,826
How we can dazzle the players with unexpected confrontation

37
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,948
while creating a lasting first impression.

38
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:08,369
And you're probably going to notice

39
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:12,113
that I haven't really put too much effort into the images

40
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,014
because that's boring.

41
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:19,799
All right, so what's the most important element,

42
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,761
even going back to 1975,

43
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,706
this is what's considered possibly the first boss battle.

44
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,267
It's basically just an enemy.

45
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:33,089
uh... with a unexpected strengths it is way more powerful than the player

46
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:33,629
expected

47
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,950
uh... it's also very unlikely for you to win against

48
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,831
uh... the dragon in

49
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:40,492
uh... the dungeon

50
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,773
uh... and it feels like a david and goliath it's uh...

51
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:45,773
kind of a

52
00:02:46,213 --> 00:02:46,533
thread

53
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:50,315
that goes across pretty much all boss battles

54
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:54,036
an easy way to create

55
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:56,317
or like the standard way of creating

56
00:02:56,988 --> 00:03:00,850
A boss that feels invincible is using the size.

57
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:07,272
This is Mothership from Phoenix from 1980, what I consider probably the first modern

58
00:03:07,473 --> 00:03:07,853
boss.

59
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:16,016
The size is so large it also feels like it's almost impossible to defeat.

60
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:22,439
This is possibly one of the best boss battles in the whole time, I'm going to talk about

61
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:22,819
it a lot.

62
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:32,392
And this is a great example of how we can use technology in order to create the illusion of size and how tech can serve the design.

63
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,474
In this case, it was running on the NES.

64
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:39,116
The NES has a limitation of 64 foreground sprites.

65
00:03:39,596 --> 00:03:46,221
Each one of them is 8x8 or 8x16, which means that they had to create a boss mostly on the background,

66
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:49,243
and every time a piece needed to move from one side to the next.

67
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:55,089
They moved it to the foreground, animated it, and then put it back in their background.

68
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:03,212
A few decades later, another game used incredible technology for the time.

69
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,714
This is Shadow of the Colossus. We're going to talk about that game a lot.

70
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:15,497
They created a physics system that's based on partially dynamic, huge objects

71
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:19,338
that influence the protagonist with its own inverse kinematics.

72
00:04:22,552 --> 00:04:28,516
Moving forward through the years, God of War is a franchise that has some epic bosses,

73
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:36,621
huge bosses, and when we're trying to continuously surprise the player, they end up increasing

74
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:38,262
the size of the boss continuously.

75
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:43,786
The bosses in God of War allow you to change the rules during play.

76
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:49,189
In this case, the second phase of the boss is a level in itself, where you need to battle

77
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:50,090
the boss from the inside.

78
00:04:51,314 --> 00:04:57,115
And all the way to the comically large, this is Gongan Weizen from Asura's Wrath, the last

79
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:02,436
phase of this boss is larger than the planet.

80
00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:09,577
And of course, at some point it becomes, it's not the same battle obviously, so it allows

81
00:05:09,617 --> 00:05:14,978
you to completely change the rules.

82
00:05:15,688 --> 00:05:25,432
We're going to talk about surprising the player and that is probably one of the best examples of how you would be able to surprise the player in pretty much every aspect.

83
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:32,695
This is Sinistar from 1982 from Noah Falstein and team.

84
00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:42,080
They were able to create a game, a space game, that completely was different from the space games of the time in both in terms of visuals.

85
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:46,343
The presentation, the theme, even the mechanics was much more complicated

86
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:56,612
and it's mostly known for its crazy digitized voice.

87
00:05:57,953 --> 00:06:03,878
Again, to surprise the players you can use all sorts of methods.

88
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:11,904
Scare the hell out of the players, as you've seen in many of the bosses in the Silent Hill franchise.

89
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:20,400
And of course this memorable boss, the great Mighty Pooh from Conker's Bed Fur Day, using

90
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,342
humor and the presentation was something that I think everybody who played this game really

91
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:29,804
remembers it well.

92
00:06:31,845 --> 00:06:35,867
And of course there are bosses in games that you wouldn't expect to have bosses.

93
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:40,650
This is Mario Kart DS, surprisingly has bosses as well.

94
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:47,227
We're going to talk about various different types of surprises throughout this talk.

95
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:49,329
This is just a quick presentation.

96
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,030
Alright, moving on.

97
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,171
Engage.

98
00:06:53,032 --> 00:06:59,818
We can use the pause in gameplay to tell a story, build anticipation towards the battle, and revel in its outcome.

99
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:09,177
So the stories back in the early days of video games were mostly the traditional story frame.

100
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:14,181
A boy saves a girl. You probably remember that there's a thread in Miyamoto's work.

101
00:07:15,742 --> 00:07:22,568
And even moving on, this is Karateka, more or less from the same time period,

102
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:28,192
used the same damsel in distress cliche, but in this case they used

103
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:35,054
A lot of cutscenes to create narrative progression and apply some foreshadowing, which in turn

104
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:39,536
create anticipation and engagement towards the final battle with Akuma.

105
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:52,121
And now the bosses are perfectly capable now to present a story in a way deeper method.

106
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:56,723
This is Joker from the Arkham Knight, and the Arkham series is one of the most amazingly

107
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:56,903
powerful.

108
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:57,664
And I'll see you next time.

109
00:07:57,684 --> 00:07:57,744
Bye.

110
00:07:57,804 --> 00:07:57,904
Bye.

111
00:07:57,924 --> 00:07:57,984
Bye.

112
00:07:58,004 --> 00:07:58,064
Bye.

113
00:07:58,104 --> 00:07:58,224
Bye.

114
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:58,364
Bye.

115
00:07:58,384 --> 00:07:58,504
Bye.

116
00:07:58,524 --> 00:07:58,624
Bye.

117
00:07:58,664 --> 00:07:58,724
Bye.

118
00:07:58,744 --> 00:07:58,864
Bye.

119
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,883
It has the most amazing bosses and great storytelling.

120
00:08:02,403 --> 00:08:06,706
In this case, the Joker is already dead, but is trying to battle its own...

121
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:09,028
being forgotten.

122
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,651
And the first part of that battle is you playing as the Joker,

123
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:16,514
which is an amazing way of telling a story.

124
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:19,597
And creates this epic intro towards the battle.

125
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:22,959
And if we're talking about epic intros...

126
00:08:24,352 --> 00:08:29,696
I still have shivers down my spine remembering this moment, the first boss in Shadow of the Colossus,

127
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:35,679
creating the silence before the storm in preparation for the first epic battle.

128
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,404
Another fantastic boss is Bob Barbas from DMC.

129
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:56,820
This Bill O'Reilly slash Max Headroom, just the presentation for this fight, creates this rage and again builds anticipation towards the battle.

130
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:09,522
Going back to the Arkham series, the intros for the battles in this series really allow you to throw the players off.

131
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:16,529
And in this case, this is kind of a glitch that they put into the intro to this battle.

132
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,291
When the player sees this thing, they are immediately kind of thrown off their element,

133
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:28,492
which makes the anticipation for the battle even heightened.

134
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:33,772
And if we're talking about breaking the fourth wall, we all remember

135
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,993
Psycho Mantis from Metal Gear Solid.

136
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:39,233
Um, this battle begins with...

137
00:09:40,486 --> 00:09:47,130
Psycho Man is reading your save files and telling you what games you like, forcing you

138
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,551
to unplug your controller in order to proceed with the battle.

139
00:09:50,972 --> 00:09:56,294
That really challenges the boundaries of what the game can do, and I believe that the boss

140
00:09:56,354 --> 00:10:00,857
battle can really allow you, if you're uniquely qualified, to do just that.

141
00:10:03,218 --> 00:10:07,180
And after the battle is complete, having some...

142
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:15,392
Some outlet and a short break allowing you to relish and gloat in the results of the battle

143
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:20,416
and of course advance the story. This is a particularly grotesque ending to the Poseidon

144
00:10:20,716 --> 00:10:29,983
battle in God of War 3. And this might be the first true outro, also quite grotesque.

145
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:34,787
This is Hitler from Wolfenstein 3D with its famous death cam TM.

146
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:42,707
As a quick anecdote, I had to look up Death Cam TM and realize that it was indeed a trademark by PUBG,

147
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:49,491
Player Unknown Battleground, which is funny because Kill Cam is owned by Activision, so I think that tells the story.

148
00:10:51,793 --> 00:10:53,874
Anyway, moving on to battle setup.

149
00:10:54,574 --> 00:11:02,660
We can fit the boss to its environment and vice versa, figure out the timing and post-battle results, and boss sequencing and interconnection.

150
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:10,806
Another early boss battle can be found in Kung Fu Master.

151
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:13,027
This is the true level boss.

152
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:17,769
It literally is a boss at the end of every level and also creates an anticipation using

153
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:22,310
the enemy health bar that is visible throughout the level.

154
00:11:22,871 --> 00:11:27,312
There's the ending boss, which I played Bubble Bobble multiple times.

155
00:11:27,392 --> 00:11:30,353
I never reached level 100 and I didn't even know it had a boss.

156
00:11:31,403 --> 00:11:37,727
But there are a few games in history that had a single boss.

157
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:39,447
But there's also the intro boss.

158
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:46,231
This is Fury from 2016, which is, I think, a perfect way of introducing the game

159
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:49,472
by starting with a bang, really.

160
00:11:49,632 --> 00:11:54,175
So instead of having some endless cutscene telling you what to do,

161
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:57,616
you can start with a boss that teaches you everything that you need to know.

162
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:03,916
This is Nemesis from all throughout Resident Evil 3.

163
00:12:05,477 --> 00:12:10,719
You battle Nemesis multiple times and in completely unexpected timing every time, so it creates

164
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:14,481
this lingering anticipation and this long engagement.

165
00:12:17,063 --> 00:12:23,866
This choice of timing, as we've seen in Bioshock, you choose when to engage your first Big Daddy

166
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:26,608
and it has some meaningful results for later.

167
00:12:28,444 --> 00:12:34,609
Chrono Trigger from 95 had a particular interesting way of giving you a choice of timing.

168
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:44,498
The timeline in which you engage with Lavos really changes the outcome and there are 13

169
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:47,921
different endings based on the timeline.

170
00:12:49,282 --> 00:12:53,025
Going back to Psycho Mantis, again there's so many things to analyze in this battle.

171
00:12:53,852 --> 00:12:57,553
One of the small details that I really enjoy is the fact that how they connect the boss

172
00:12:57,573 --> 00:12:58,293
to its environment.

173
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:06,396
So the boss, even using telekinesis, it attacks you with picture frames and phases, which

174
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:09,937
I think it's a great idea.

175
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:16,579
Once again, the Great Mighty Pooh, well connected to its environment, attacks you with poop,

176
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,620
and you retaliate by throwing an oversized ball.

177
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:34,443
Alright, so connecting the boss with the minions, that's pretty obvious.

178
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:37,325
We keep creating this unified approach.

179
00:13:37,405 --> 00:13:42,970
We remember even from Super Mario Brothers that Bowser is actually the king of the turtles

180
00:13:44,371 --> 00:13:49,155
and visually looks connected to the minions, to some of them.

181
00:13:50,214 --> 00:13:57,416
Although, another anecdote is that originally it was designed by Miyamoto as an ox, only

182
00:13:57,496 --> 00:13:59,696
to be challenged and changed later.

183
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:08,818
Looking again at Super Mario Bros., the connection between the boss battles, basically you're

184
00:14:09,038 --> 00:14:16,860
battling Bowser every time with slightly increasing difficulty, and every time you're sent to

185
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,600
a different castle.

186
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:28,367
But some games really make a point in creating this elaborate story and interconnection between the different bosses.

187
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:29,448
This is Undertale.

188
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:37,597
And every boss has a connection both narratively, thematically, even in terms of UI.

189
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:44,096
to the previous bosses and uses everything that you've learned from previous bosses

190
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:48,660
and eventually challenges everything.

191
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,926
So every boss feels like it breaks some rule that was established previously.

192
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:58,488
This is the Spider from Limbo.

193
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:01,751
I definitely believe it's a legitimate boss.

194
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:05,354
You battle it multiple times in the first part of the game.

195
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:11,832
And again, there are plenty of cases where a single boss can be a challenge multiple times.

196
00:15:11,872 --> 00:15:17,595
And every challenge presents a different skill, and we're going to talk about skills in a moment.

197
00:15:19,476 --> 00:15:27,881
Personally, my second boss in Mushroom 11 was a direct tribute to the spider boss in Limbo,

198
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:34,304
including the part where you use the spider's body to move over the acid pit.

199
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:38,115
Which is a quick point that I wanted to make.

200
00:15:38,615 --> 00:15:43,300
In Mushroom 11, after you defeat the boss,

201
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,182
there's always an additional challenge

202
00:15:45,202 --> 00:15:46,203
that you need to cross.

203
00:15:46,223 --> 00:15:48,966
You need to physically cross over to the next world.

204
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:53,070
Which I thought was pretty interesting and clever.

205
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,852
But to be honest, this is not something I would do again.

206
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:56,573
Because.

207
00:15:57,984 --> 00:16:01,365
When the player believes that, or they see that triumph,

208
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:04,985
they believe that they can proceed to the next level.

209
00:16:05,345 --> 00:16:07,786
Instead, we're challenging them and immediately throwing them

210
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:10,746
back into a new challenge, kind of watering down

211
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:12,367
this excitement and satisfaction.

212
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,588
Wouldn't hurt to just continue automatically,

213
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:20,148
or find a different way to present this challenge.

214
00:16:21,088 --> 00:16:23,029
All right, skill, mastery, and teaching.

215
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:25,789
So we're going to talk about the skills, how

216
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:27,670
we can design a challenge.

217
00:16:28,235 --> 00:16:33,599
to test a specific skill and how to increase the difficulty and combine multiple skills

218
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:38,882
and of course the undivided attention that we have to teach new skills.

219
00:16:40,203 --> 00:16:43,185
This is the first boss from Shinobi, a game that I really like.

220
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:51,691
That boss is pretty much a test for jump and shoot.

221
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,334
And it's basically a skill gate for that specific skill.

222
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:59,249
If you don't know how to jump and shoot, you wouldn't survive a minute in the next level.

223
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:02,331
So making sure that you're ready for what's next.

224
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:09,897
This is Father Gascoigne from Bloodborne, another game with fantastic bosses.

225
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:15,581
So Father Gascoigne is essentially a skill gate for parrying,

226
00:17:17,022 --> 00:17:21,205
and allows you to test the basics before increasing the difficulty.

227
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:30,448
Of course, it's not always physical skills. This is an Athene from the Vault of Glass.

228
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:42,179
This is essentially the ultimate test of communication skills and collaboration between raid members.

229
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,824
One of my favorite things is when bosses actually teach you new...

230
00:17:49,812 --> 00:17:52,553
This is King Bom-Om from Super Mario 64.

231
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:58,274
We are using this undivided attention and no distractions around the boss to teach you something new,

232
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:01,815
which is something that is very important when you're teaching to not have distractions.

233
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:03,895
And we introduced a new skill.

234
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:06,216
This skill is grab and throw.

235
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:11,357
We're basically providing a reason for you to utilize that new skill.

236
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:17,903
This boss particularly does a very clever psychological trick of priming.

237
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:22,067
Because if you don't know what you need to do, you can just sit back and see the boss

238
00:18:22,648 --> 00:18:29,133
doing the same thing, and that primes you to think about grabbing it for a moment.

239
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:32,977
Once again, this is the chain from Fury, the intro boss.

240
00:18:33,557 --> 00:18:37,521
I think bosses are perfectly capable.

241
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:41,942
of introducing the basic mechanics.

242
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:45,304
In this case, this boss is the first thing that you see

243
00:18:45,964 --> 00:18:52,067
and teaches you all the basic mechanics and buttons and skills.

244
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:59,291
This is a very memorable boss, the first boss from R-Type,

245
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,712
one of my favorite bosses,

246
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:06,895
and it uses a great way of implicitly teaching you a new technique.

247
00:19:07,237 --> 00:19:12,299
In this case, the force pod that you send to infiltrate, it has this curvature there

248
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:17,081
that keeps the force pod in the center right in front of the weak point.

249
00:19:17,181 --> 00:19:22,343
And by seeing the effect, using hindsight bias, you retain the observed result.

250
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:27,544
That way, it reinforces the teaching of using the force pod.

251
00:19:29,145 --> 00:19:32,026
This is Ruby Weapon from Final Fantasy VII.

252
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:36,848
It uses a great way of introducing a modified skill, in this case a handicap.

253
00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:45,986
This is the Whirlsend. It's an attack that takes party members off the game.

254
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:50,212
And really changes the way you interact with the boss.

255
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:56,380
Another interesting handicap is the last boss in Shadow of the Colossus.

256
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,783
Following the tragic loss of your horse, Tagro,

257
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:05,287
you don't have the speed and capabilities that the boss allows you to do,

258
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:13,634
so you have to use evasion and stealth in the first phase of the battle.

259
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,137
Increased risk. This is the last boss in Sonic 2.

260
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:27,367
In this case, the entire level does not have any rings, which creates this illusion of

261
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:32,912
risk and the boss feels much harder, which is a different way of playing the game.

262
00:20:34,574 --> 00:20:35,395
This is Berserker.

263
00:20:36,397 --> 00:20:42,618
In a game with a first person shooter, or a third person shooter, where all you need to do is hunt down enemies.

264
00:20:42,678 --> 00:20:52,901
In this case you can't do that, you have to lure the enemy to follow you around into the light to be hunted down by the Hammer of Dawn Death Ray.

265
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,262
And this is Ray from Uncharted 4.

266
00:20:58,522 --> 00:21:01,403
And a lot of bosses use playable cutscenes basically.

267
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:05,722
open up infinite opportunities, introduce different skills.

268
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:14,489
This is not exactly expected, but this battle has, it's basically a glorified sword fight

269
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:16,230
using two buttons.

270
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:26,310
This is GLaDOS, the only boss in Portal, which introduces a new constraint.

271
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:31,192
This is the time constraint, or at least the explicit time constraint that was not available before.

272
00:21:36,307 --> 00:21:42,451
Also, Colossus allows you to use multi-skill, combining multi-skill into one epic battle.

273
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:50,257
This is Wheatley from 4.0.2, which forces you to use all the different things that you learn throughout the game.

274
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:57,522
Going back to Shadow of the Colossus, this is a phased set of skills.

275
00:21:57,702 --> 00:22:01,264
Every phase has a different, unique skill that it tests.

276
00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:05,768
The first part forces you to shoot down the sacks.

277
00:22:06,335 --> 00:22:09,397
The first part is making this sand dragon drop down.

278
00:22:09,697 --> 00:22:11,958
The second part is all about timing and speed.

279
00:22:11,978 --> 00:22:17,462
The third part is holding on to the body of the dragon.

280
00:22:19,123 --> 00:22:22,966
Mr. Freeze is one of my favorite bosses, again, from the Arkham series.

281
00:22:24,286 --> 00:22:32,832
This one also tests different particular skills, but gives you the choice of how to introduce them.

282
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:36,134
You choose when to try out every different skill.

283
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:41,390
The boss tells you that you cannot use that anymore.

284
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,931
He's going to be protected from that.

285
00:22:44,312 --> 00:22:47,654
Which is, I believe, a great way of testing out different skills.

286
00:22:50,076 --> 00:22:51,617
And of course, the side skills.

287
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:59,983
In a game that's all about space battles, in this case, the skill is to get a triple 7.

288
00:23:00,023 --> 00:23:00,423
In space.

289
00:23:05,961 --> 00:23:14,263
In Metroid Prime, which is a 3D action-adventure game, you get kind of a glimpse to a different game.

290
00:23:14,783 --> 00:23:23,605
Spider Guardian is basically a 2D puzzle game, which is again something that only a boss battle can do, if you think about it.

291
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:30,486
One of my favorites, this is The Bride from Miss Explosion Man.

292
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:34,587
This is a side skill that's a tribute to Hat-Tip.

293
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:37,227
If you will, to another game.

294
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:39,827
This is basically a tribute to Punch-Out!!

295
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:49,851
And this is from last year, Dr. Robotnik's Mindy Machine from Sonic Mania.

296
00:23:50,111 --> 00:23:54,072
Which is another glimpse to a different game.

297
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:57,433
A game with the same name, which is essentially a session of Puyo Puyo.

298
00:23:59,494 --> 00:24:01,674
Alright, let's move on to the actual confrontation.

299
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:04,015
Alright, so...

300
00:24:05,747 --> 00:24:10,388
We will be talking about how to design attack patterns around the tested skill that we just established

301
00:24:10,568 --> 00:24:13,209
and how to encourage interaction between the boss and the player.

302
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:24,673
Dracula from Castlevania is a boss that basically tests jumping and hitting from very close range.

303
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:30,695
In order to support that skill, the attack pattern is designed to be very precise.

304
00:24:31,044 --> 00:24:39,150
uses the negative space that is left by that skill and forces the player to get very close

305
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:46,975
to the boss and jump over it. So if you think about it, we are using and complementing the

306
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:54,220
skill that we've established. Cuphead from last year did a fantastic job in pretty much every boss

307
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:59,444
in establishing a skill, a specific skill, and then creating a negative space that forces you

308
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:07,014
to interact in a certain way.

309
00:25:08,336 --> 00:25:13,161
Bosses, bullet hells like Don and Pachi, that Krattsu...

310
00:25:13,755 --> 00:25:18,636
is a great example of the idea of negative space.

311
00:25:18,756 --> 00:25:20,757
Because if you think about it, and as we can see,

312
00:25:21,337 --> 00:25:23,598
the boss can kill you whenever they want.

313
00:25:23,778 --> 00:25:28,079
If the designers wished to kill you, they would just shoot an endless amount of bullets

314
00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:31,220
or end the boss with an infinite speed.

315
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,822
But in this case, we are actually trying to not kill the player.

316
00:25:35,842 --> 00:25:37,182
We're planning how to keep them alive.

317
00:25:37,322 --> 00:25:41,783
And you can see that even within the bullet hell, there are paths.

318
00:25:42,395 --> 00:25:44,435
that are allowed for the player to use.

319
00:25:46,436 --> 00:25:48,736
So that's what we're planning. We're planning the paths.

320
00:25:51,457 --> 00:25:54,818
Another great example is from Contra.

321
00:25:54,878 --> 00:26:00,479
Pretty much a lot of the bosses there create the idea of the counter-attack.

322
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,661
So you are attacking the boss as they attack you.

323
00:26:05,741 --> 00:26:09,082
And that creates kind of a poetic justice, of course.

324
00:26:09,162 --> 00:26:10,662
But also there's a...

325
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:16,764
There's an element here that's very useful for designing a boss, which is creating this

326
00:26:16,905 --> 00:26:22,489
short time window and a limited space, which forces us to have this confrontation and this

327
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:24,570
cycle of evading and attacking.

328
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:30,875
We saw the King Kupama from N64.

329
00:26:30,895 --> 00:26:36,639
This is the DS version, which is pretty much exactly the same idea.

330
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:39,301
It teaches you how to grab and throw.

331
00:26:39,774 --> 00:26:41,675
but it uses a completely different way.

332
00:26:41,695 --> 00:26:45,218
It throws a bomb at you, which again is kind of a cliche of bosses,

333
00:26:45,698 --> 00:26:46,959
but it...

334
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:47,899
it...

335
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,863
this deflection that it requires puts the player in the line of fire

336
00:26:53,123 --> 00:26:56,885
and forces this interaction between the boss and the player.

337
00:26:56,905 --> 00:27:03,630
One of my favorite bosses, at least from the Zelda series, is Drinrova,

338
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:08,093
which again creates... forces this interaction between you...

339
00:27:08,546 --> 00:27:13,067
And the bosses, in this case, you deflect the attack of one sister against the other.

340
00:27:13,227 --> 00:27:21,569
One of my favorite bosses, Eusticia from Bayonetta, in another game with fantastic bosses.

341
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:24,910
In this case, it's another type of counterattack.

342
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,050
It creates a path...

343
00:27:28,031 --> 00:27:30,431
By attacking you, it creates a path for its own destruction.

344
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:36,713
Another version of that can be found in Dingo Dial from Crash Bandicoot Warped.

345
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:44,171
You lure Dingo Dial to shoot at you, thus creating a path that you can use to destroy him.

346
00:27:45,851 --> 00:27:52,434
And you can see also that the arena, in this case, was perfectly tailored for this specific battle,

347
00:27:52,474 --> 00:27:55,175
which leads us to the arena layout.

348
00:27:55,275 --> 00:28:01,537
Again, we're trying to create an arena that complements the battle and is based on that specific fight.

349
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:03,817
This is Cyberdemon from Doom from 2016.

350
00:28:06,033 --> 00:28:12,979
In both phases of the battle, the arena is very small, open, no place to hide,

351
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,824
kind of reminiscent of olden times as well, and it increases the confrontation.

352
00:28:19,844 --> 00:28:27,130
And further, so during the second phase, it uses this temporary layout change

353
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:32,695
that even creates this lane that restricts your motion.

354
00:28:33,683 --> 00:28:37,304
and makes the confrontation even more obvious.

355
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:50,148
But the idea is that the arena is always designed and tailored to that specific boss battle.

356
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:53,929
This is a boss that moves extremely fast and is partially invisible.

357
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:55,349
You don't know where the...

358
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,091
By looking where the attacks come from, you know where the boss would be.

359
00:29:00,151 --> 00:29:02,472
And also they made a lot of fences and...

360
00:29:02,904 --> 00:29:09,267
There are also a bunch of different hubs for interaction.

361
00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:18,232
Lighting can also be used as a great way of introducing a layout.

362
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:25,095
In this case, the Specter Knight boss in Shovel Knight uses the shadows to hide.

363
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:32,019
And if you haven't noticed how it moves in the first phase of the fight, you wouldn't even know how to interact with it.

364
00:29:32,725 --> 00:29:35,226
So it kind of teaches and then tests your ability.

365
00:29:37,748 --> 00:29:41,951
And one of the most important points in boss battles is the attack space.

366
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:49,415
And I'm referring to the idea that you can employ multiple approaches or strategies against the boss.

367
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:58,000
I think a good boss can be beaten in multiple ways, or at least different players can interact with it in different ways.

368
00:29:58,821 --> 00:30:01,743
In this case, this is Ornstein and Smough from Dark Souls.

369
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:08,915
A fantastic boss that is particularly remembered because of the two bosses really.

370
00:30:09,195 --> 00:30:15,617
One of them is quick and weak and the other one is very powerful and slow.

371
00:30:15,957 --> 00:30:21,458
And you choose how to interact with that boss and you form your own strategy.

372
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:27,879
I'm not a huge RPG player but this is also a memorable.

373
00:30:28,392 --> 00:30:32,154
It's a boss battle, this Archimon from Dark Dragon Age Origins.

374
00:30:32,755 --> 00:30:38,358
It's also known for its various different strategies that can be used in order to beat the boss.

375
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:42,440
Once again, Big Daddy.

376
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:48,563
It's one of the first games that allows you to have these different approaches and mobs and emerging behaviors.

377
00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:52,965
You can beat Big Daddy by using shotguns, electricity...

378
00:30:54,846 --> 00:31:01,609
telekinetically moving booby traps, and even hypnotizing one Big Daddy against another.

379
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:08,893
Alright, moving on to clarity. We need to make sure that we avoid unpredictability,

380
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:13,896
obscurity, and randomness by setting clear goals, progression in hits, and predictable attacks.

381
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:21,720
So, the idea of a clear target is very obvious. We all know that we've kind of gotten used to the idea of a glowing target.

382
00:31:22,237 --> 00:31:25,699
a weak spot which creates a clear vulnerability and a call to action.

383
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,720
There's even a funny article from The Onion exactly on that.

384
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,422
Creating a clear call to action is extremely important.

385
00:31:35,482 --> 00:31:37,803
This is an example from Shadow of the Colossus.

386
00:31:38,123 --> 00:31:42,645
Particularly when you have a large boss with multiple weak points, the sigils,

387
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:47,747
it forces us as designers to create some sort of guidance as needed.

388
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:51,188
In this case, the sword that lights up the next target.

389
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:57,311
In some cases, guidance is not needed. This is Dark Link.

390
00:31:59,413 --> 00:32:09,499
You don't need to know its particular weak spots because it is you. You know its strengths and weaknesses.

391
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:13,841
This reminded me of Mirror Prince from Prince of Persia.

392
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:19,024
The first phase, the first part of the game, you create this Mirror Prince by going through a mirror.

393
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:22,930
The second part, you have to battle it.

394
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:27,852
And in this case, the challenge is a logical challenge,

395
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:33,213
figuring out how to beat it by lowering your sword and moving into him.

396
00:32:33,373 --> 00:32:38,595
And this is the puzzle battle, and I really enjoy bosses that employ logic.

397
00:32:39,555 --> 00:32:41,916
And figuring out the goal is the challenge in this case.

398
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:46,757
And one thing that's very, very important, and I can talk a lot about this,

399
00:32:46,857 --> 00:32:48,498
and I don't want to spend too much time on it,

400
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:49,238
the idea is that...

401
00:32:49,728 --> 00:32:55,133
You either employ logic or skill, but try to avoid doing both at the same exact time.

402
00:32:56,814 --> 00:33:00,717
The reason is what I call the delta of chance, and I'm going to talk about that later.

403
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:06,702
Delta of chance is that when you believe that you've succeeded and then immediately fail

404
00:33:06,742 --> 00:33:14,229
because there's an additional challenge and vice versa. That creates a very unsatisfying moment.

405
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:17,311
Clear progression.

406
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:23,923
We talked about the glowing red point, which creates a focal call to action.

407
00:33:24,683 --> 00:33:33,067
We can also see that this particular game, and most games of the time, have a clear hit.

408
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:35,728
You can see a couple of frames that change the color.

409
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:43,191
And also, of course, the health bar, which we've all grown accustomed to in many bosses.

410
00:33:44,632 --> 00:33:45,513
Not every boss has...

411
00:33:46,877 --> 00:33:52,339
Health bars, in some cases, you don't really need it, as long as you have a clear understanding of how far you've gotten.

412
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:56,480
This is the first phase of Hive Mind in Dead Space.

413
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,841
There are a couple of pods that you... five pods that you need to destroy,

414
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:04,122
and by seeing how many you have left, you have a clear understanding of the progression.

415
00:34:06,302 --> 00:34:09,483
Early... in the early games, this is a space harrier.

416
00:34:09,503 --> 00:34:12,364
They used a kind of a weird trick of changing the color.

417
00:34:13,063 --> 00:34:15,865
of the boss as they lose health.

418
00:34:17,207 --> 00:34:19,709
But that trick has been long gone.

419
00:34:19,729 --> 00:34:22,912
It limits your visual design abilities.

420
00:34:24,733 --> 00:34:30,558
An interesting way of presenting your progression is done in Cuphead.

421
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:34,582
So instead of showing you the progression during the battle,

422
00:34:34,622 --> 00:34:36,143
they do it when you die.

423
00:34:36,504 --> 00:34:38,686
Which, if you think about it, is actually quite clever because

424
00:34:38,706 --> 00:34:39,406
you...

425
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,141
potentially lose players just before a potential rage quit.

426
00:34:44,901 --> 00:34:46,462
They can see how far they've gotten.

427
00:34:46,942 --> 00:34:49,543
So that's a very interesting prospect.

428
00:34:50,103 --> 00:34:53,784
It also shows you the phase which gives you even further indication of where you are.

429
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,925
Talking about Cuphead,

430
00:34:58,665 --> 00:35:01,506
it's incredibly important to have a predictable attack

431
00:35:02,506 --> 00:35:05,187
because predictability is control

432
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:07,627
and when you know how the bullets,

433
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,828
you can have many different bullets or attack types.

434
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:17,135
Go in the next frame you have control over the battle and as long as you have information and time to react

435
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,036
You can beat any boss

436
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:26,640
Some bosses kind of put you in a position where you don't have enough time. This is again the first boss in

437
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,762
Shinobi which is notorious for its

438
00:35:30,322 --> 00:35:35,985
Randomness in the attacks. I think in this case. They actually wanted to create this panic

439
00:35:37,705 --> 00:35:41,206
in order to force the player to use the magic.

440
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:44,388
But generally, randomness is very risky.

441
00:35:45,868 --> 00:35:48,189
Going back to Space Harrier,

442
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:51,871
another interesting point is that

443
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:56,853
while in 2D it's very clear to see an attack coming,

444
00:35:56,873 --> 00:35:59,755
it's very clear to extrapolate its position,

445
00:36:01,917 --> 00:36:04,438
In 3D it's not that easy.

446
00:36:04,718 --> 00:36:10,881
I think we've evolved in a way that a change in scale is not that visible.

447
00:36:12,522 --> 00:36:14,843
Some 3D games do it better.

448
00:36:16,304 --> 00:36:19,485
So, going back to Cyberdemon,

449
00:36:19,825 --> 00:36:24,967
as long as it's visible enough that something is going directly at you,

450
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:27,388
then you should be fine.

451
00:36:27,428 --> 00:36:30,310
In this case, the flare behind the rocket

452
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:35,192
gives you just enough information to know if an attack is coming directly at you.

453
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:40,535
Another cool trick from the Barbas fight,

454
00:36:40,555 --> 00:36:45,097
it always attacks you sideways and then clamping towards you,

455
00:36:45,477 --> 00:36:49,960
again giving you just enough information and time to react.

456
00:36:54,202 --> 00:36:57,644
But you don't always have enough information or time to react,

457
00:36:59,582 --> 00:37:01,523
You have to compensate with enough information.

458
00:37:02,423 --> 00:37:09,645
The preemptive shadow, as I call it here, is highlighting where the hit is going to land.

459
00:37:09,865 --> 00:37:16,326
This is both the fireballs and the bombs as well.

460
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:22,768
If you think about it, it kind of compensates for the lack of information that we, as spectators, have.

461
00:37:23,918 --> 00:37:29,882
If Mario can look up and see the bombs falling, we don't have that luxury, so by providing

462
00:37:29,922 --> 00:37:35,965
that guidance, it gives us just enough information to attack.

463
00:37:36,525 --> 00:37:38,206
This is Hellblade.

464
00:37:38,947 --> 00:37:43,269
In Hellblade, of course, and in many other games, they use preemptive animation.

465
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:49,253
It gives you well enough time to see when and where the next attack is coming by having

466
00:37:49,273 --> 00:37:51,934
this animation of the enemy.

467
00:37:53,093 --> 00:38:02,165
Also, here's another cool trick to introduce this telegraphy by actually literally saying

468
00:38:02,505 --> 00:38:07,912
that attacks are coming behind you using the voices in Senua's head, which I thought was

469
00:38:08,192 --> 00:38:08,553
brilliant.

470
00:38:11,278 --> 00:38:13,259
This is Elantrador from Rayman Legends.

471
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:16,220
It uses multiple telegraphing methods.

472
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:21,682
You have the shadow that gives you information on the position,

473
00:38:21,822 --> 00:38:23,082
or the location of the attack,

474
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:25,563
and the animation for the timing.

475
00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:28,384
So with the timing and the position,

476
00:38:28,404 --> 00:38:30,585
you have just enough information to respond.

477
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:39,015
Another cool telegraphing method used in the Master Hand in Super Smash Bros. throughout the series.

478
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:49,123
These kind of implicit hand gestures give you enough information to know when the next attack is coming.

479
00:38:49,503 --> 00:38:55,548
Once again, Wraith and other battles in the franchise, if you notice just before the hit lands,

480
00:38:56,989 --> 00:39:01,433
it slows it down just enough to give you time to react.

481
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:05,235
Which is some sort of telegraphing, but kind of changing reality slightly.

482
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:06,155
This should be fun.

483
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:13,598
So, the first battles in Punch-Out!!

484
00:39:14,658 --> 00:39:18,699
They start pretty slowly, they have a lot of pre-emptive animations,

485
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:20,900
giving you just enough time to respond.

486
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,040
But as the battles progress...

487
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:27,015
and it gets harder and harder, you have less and less time to react.

488
00:39:27,295 --> 00:39:31,697
In fact, the Mike Tyson battle doesn't really give you enough time to respond to any attack.

489
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:36,679
And the only way you would know what to do is by observing the previous attacks and timing them

490
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:40,881
and memorize them and basically anticipate in order to survive,

491
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:45,103
because the previous waves telegraph the next waves.

492
00:39:45,723 --> 00:39:48,204
And that's what you see also in Cuphead many, many times.

493
00:39:48,464 --> 00:39:50,105
The first attack, like in this case the egg,

494
00:39:50,975 --> 00:39:57,338
is extremely risky, you don't even know what it does, and in fact if you're in the wrong place, you would die the first time you see it.

495
00:39:57,378 --> 00:40:02,040
But once you see it once, you know how to react the next time.

496
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:09,542
And this happens constantly in this game, it works very well for a game that has a lot of these interactions, a lot of deaths.

497
00:40:12,303 --> 00:40:17,005
This is a less common example, this is Lillerhorn from Super Meat Boy.

498
00:40:17,564 --> 00:40:20,126
This entire boss is built on memorization.

499
00:40:20,186 --> 00:40:24,908
It has 13 different stages that you need to memorize each one of them in order to survive.

500
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:30,291
Which works very well for this game because this game is all about dying multiple times.

501
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:35,114
All right, let's move on to difficulty.

502
00:40:35,134 --> 00:40:42,699
All right, we're going to talk about Delta of Chance, which I mentioned before, and the

503
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:45,660
fact that we are here to reward and not to punish.

504
00:40:47,388 --> 00:40:48,369
So the delta of chance.

505
00:40:49,429 --> 00:40:53,431
If you look at any phase or any even attack type in a boss

506
00:40:53,511 --> 00:40:57,893
or any kind of interaction with an enemy,

507
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:01,234
you usually see, or you better see,

508
00:41:01,394 --> 00:41:04,775
a challenging peak followed by a foreseeable end.

509
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,576
You can actually see where it's going to end.

510
00:41:07,877 --> 00:41:12,458
And a noticeable easing between them.

511
00:41:12,478 --> 00:41:15,760
And the idea of delta of chance is that, well,

512
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,000
a positive delta of chance.

513
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:21,433
puts you in a position where you see an anticipated failure and

514
00:41:21,693 --> 00:41:28,275
heightened risk followed by an anticipated triumph not immediate triumph, but anticipated triumph and

515
00:41:28,475 --> 00:41:29,475
that translates

516
00:41:30,475 --> 00:41:32,296
directly into the behavior of

517
00:41:33,436 --> 00:41:37,217
Dopamine now. I'm not a chemist a biochemist, but

518
00:41:38,258 --> 00:41:40,618
from it's pretty recent that they

519
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,760
studied this neurotransmitter and realized that its behavior

520
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:52,151
really rewards and encourages behavior that leads to a positive change in your behavior.

521
00:41:53,932 --> 00:42:02,739
And there's always kind of a low dosage of dopamine that changes, peaks when you have

522
00:42:02,759 --> 00:42:06,863
this positive delta of chance and completely stops when you have the negative delta of

523
00:42:06,903 --> 00:42:14,168
chance kind of in an evolutionary way of teaching you how to work and advance in the world.

524
00:42:15,025 --> 00:42:20,470
In our world, you can kind of imagine that if you think about playing a game of Tetris,

525
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:25,554
where you can see that you're almost going to fail, and then you see that the next piece is a long piece.

526
00:42:26,735 --> 00:42:34,341
Sometimes you would want to kind of wait and extend that amazing moment that you know that you've just survived.

527
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:41,987
And that feeling is what I believe is one of the most important and one of the biggest takeaways I think you should have from this talk.

528
00:42:42,577 --> 00:42:48,819
And this is something that I also learned kind of recently, because I made a game that is extremely difficult. You probably know that.

529
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:59,801
The idea of making sure that there's a challenging peak followed by a kind of anticipated triumph is extremely important.

530
00:42:59,941 --> 00:43:03,422
And I can see this in pretty much all the good bosses that I surveyed.

531
00:43:04,923 --> 00:43:07,823
And this is one of the reasons why this boss is so wonderful.

532
00:43:08,283 --> 00:43:10,804
Because every attack wave has a...

533
00:43:11,871 --> 00:43:14,633
a very challenging peak right in the middle of that attack.

534
00:43:15,013 --> 00:43:17,714
You are attacked by multiple different pieces,

535
00:43:18,695 --> 00:43:21,396
you are forced in this very narrow space,

536
00:43:23,137 --> 00:43:24,278
and once you survive this,

537
00:43:24,878 --> 00:43:27,139
you start seeing less and less pieces coming towards you,

538
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,981
and they get more anticipated,

539
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:29,941
you see where they're coming,

540
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:31,942
because those are the only ones left.

541
00:43:32,883 --> 00:43:35,804
And there's a good one second

542
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,726
where you know that you've survived a very difficult challenge.

543
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:43,729
And that second is extremely addicting and satisfying.

544
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:45,930
And I think this is what we're looking for.

545
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:50,534
A great example is from Intruder, from Gradius II.

546
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:58,760
The first part is one single fire snake, and then you hit it and it splits into three.

547
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,642
That moment becomes extremely difficult.

548
00:44:01,971 --> 00:44:06,393
But once you hit one snake and then the second one, you know that you survived it.

549
00:44:06,613 --> 00:44:09,674
The last part, the last few seconds are just very, very easy.

550
00:44:11,354 --> 00:44:16,856
So you have a few seconds of this wonderful satisfaction.

551
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:23,799
Another great way, going back to Hivemind, the first phase of the battle,

552
00:44:23,939 --> 00:44:30,982
after you destroyed the third pod, you're picked up always by the tentacle.

553
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:37,260
And at that point, it seems like it gets a little harder because you're airborne, it's

554
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,581
harder to aim.

555
00:44:38,821 --> 00:44:43,846
But really, there's no risk anymore because you're not subject to the attacks of the tentacles.

556
00:44:44,326 --> 00:44:49,371
So subconsciously, you know that you've beat the first phase.

557
00:44:49,931 --> 00:44:53,955
And those few seconds of you aiming are very satisfying.

558
00:44:55,893 --> 00:45:02,235
Now this is not exactly a boss, but somehow it keeps coming back over and over again in discussions on the favorite bosses.

559
00:45:02,815 --> 00:45:10,457
This is a song from Intargo 3, and I started looking at it and tried to figure out why people like it so much and mention it as a boss.

560
00:45:11,238 --> 00:45:15,579
It had the same traits and qualities of a good boss.

561
00:45:15,939 --> 00:45:21,441
It has attack waves that heighten towards a very challenging, crazy peak.

562
00:45:22,262 --> 00:45:29,005
And once you reach that peak and cross it, it starts slowing down towards this satisfying moment

563
00:45:29,105 --> 00:45:32,207
where you can just kind of rest, you know you succeeded until the next one.

564
00:45:32,227 --> 00:45:36,609
And it's also very memorizable because it's a song, you know how to do this.

565
00:45:38,189 --> 00:45:40,290
All right, let's quickly talk about multi-phases.

566
00:45:42,672 --> 00:45:46,753
Now, there's a notion of creating phases just in order to extend.

567
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:52,073
the gameplay and this is something that I really don't enjoy.

568
00:45:52,093 --> 00:45:58,276
I don't think that creating a long boss battle is something that's extremely important.

569
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:03,099
It's not a way for you to extend how long people play your game.

570
00:46:04,259 --> 00:46:09,762
You are here to reward the player and provide some, in this case, break before increasing

571
00:46:09,782 --> 00:46:14,205
the difficulty slightly or change the battle or change it to a different skill.

572
00:46:14,618 --> 00:46:23,319
I also suggest taking into consideration the delta of chance, so make the break more anticipated

573
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,340
and apply some easing towards it.

574
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:33,641
Some great examples for phasing, as we've seen with the Sand Dragon, where each phase

575
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:35,422
introduces a different challenge.

576
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:40,683
This is a great boss battle from NieR Automata from last year.

577
00:46:42,418 --> 00:46:47,499
The first phase you have this force field that protects the boss.

578
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,740
You can't attack it, but you can learn how it moves.

579
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:57,102
The second part where they turn off the power, you can actually attack it, but you don't really see very well.

580
00:46:57,282 --> 00:47:00,983
So those two phases really complement each other very well.

581
00:47:03,801 --> 00:47:09,808
Last example from the Arkham series, this is Russell Gould, where each one of the phases

582
00:47:10,048 --> 00:47:18,998
changes the rules completely, the oversized boss, then gravity or multiple instances.

583
00:47:19,158 --> 00:47:24,484
So I think the idea is that every phase can break the rules in a different way.

584
00:47:26,988 --> 00:47:30,970
Now let's talk a little bit about the difficulty level and pacifism.

585
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:38,612
A lot of games introduce multiple difficulty levels throughout the game.

586
00:47:38,632 --> 00:47:42,453
You can change it, you can just, the entire game becomes easier.

587
00:47:43,573 --> 00:47:46,514
Cuphead actually allows you to change the difficulty level per boss.

588
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:54,776
There are other bosses that give you the idea of a non-fighting option, or maybe this is

589
00:47:54,816 --> 00:47:55,656
the basic option.

590
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:01,881
In any case, whether or not you fight the boss, the challenge is still maintained.

591
00:48:01,981 --> 00:48:03,182
It's a different challenge.

592
00:48:03,262 --> 00:48:10,187
If you have the fire flower and you hit the boss, if you don't have it, you're using timing instead.

593
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:17,533
And again, the idea that non-fighting options can still maintain some challenge can be seen in Master from Fallout.

594
00:48:18,274 --> 00:48:25,440
In certain circumstances, and if you go through a specific branch of the dialogue, you can actually convince Master.

595
00:48:26,419 --> 00:48:31,122
to self-destruct and avoid a very, very difficult battle.

596
00:48:31,822 --> 00:48:34,964
And if you think about it, it's not that you skipped the battle.

597
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:38,246
You just create a different challenge for yourself.

598
00:48:38,286 --> 00:48:41,448
It's more a logical challenge than a physical one.

599
00:48:43,969 --> 00:48:46,030
And a great example is through Undertale.

600
00:48:46,471 --> 00:48:51,774
There are many types of confrontations, and confrontations can end without a fight.

601
00:48:51,814 --> 00:48:52,334
In fact, there's a...

602
00:48:52,703 --> 00:48:56,064
a true pacifist route that is also considered, I think,

603
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:59,985
as the true ending for the game, that you can just

604
00:49:00,065 --> 00:49:01,685
avoid fighting all the bosses.

605
00:49:01,985 --> 00:49:03,725
And the challenge is still there.

606
00:49:03,805 --> 00:49:05,206
It's a slightly different challenge.

607
00:49:08,006 --> 00:49:10,547
There are other games that allow you to skip bosses.

608
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:13,007
Because again, the boss is a reward.

609
00:49:13,688 --> 00:49:16,588
If the player so chooses, they can just avoid the battle.

610
00:49:16,608 --> 00:49:18,809
And this is Spire of the Dragon, where

611
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:21,449
we can use collectibles to progress and go

612
00:49:21,489 --> 00:49:22,430
through the balloonists.

613
00:49:23,117 --> 00:49:27,640
You can just avoid the battle if you have enough of the thing that you're collecting.

614
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:34,184
And it's all about... If the player just enjoys collecting but they don't enjoy fighting,

615
00:49:34,424 --> 00:49:36,085
then that's their choice.

616
00:49:37,566 --> 00:49:44,291
And finally, in Monster Hunter World, the whole point is that you choose the battles.

617
00:49:44,811 --> 00:49:49,354
You take on quests and it's all for your own personal advancement.

618
00:49:50,525 --> 00:49:55,669
The battle is a reward, it's part of the game, it's not a punishment that you have to endure

619
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:59,172
in order to get to the next world.

620
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:03,795
So, a couple of words on skipping.

621
00:50:03,936 --> 00:50:07,799
So, you need to ask yourself when you design a boss,

622
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,801
is this boss essential to the progression?

623
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,883
Does it teach you something that you have to learn?

624
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:16,066
Does it make sure that you're not going to be hurt later?

625
00:50:16,686 --> 00:50:18,668
And if not, then...

626
00:50:19,491 --> 00:50:24,874
Are you really excluding unable players that you considered as non-deserving?

627
00:50:25,574 --> 00:50:31,957
You remember that the battle must be rewarding, but players can enjoy different types of challenges.

628
00:50:32,817 --> 00:50:38,260
So I urge you to consider easy mode or alternate challenges.

629
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:45,103
For example, I can definitely see start designing bosses that can be either challenged physically

630
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:50,794
or logically, and both ways are completely acceptable.

631
00:50:51,274 --> 00:50:53,155
And of course, even skipping the boss,

632
00:50:53,235 --> 00:50:55,096
because it's the player's choice.

633
00:50:55,897 --> 00:50:58,758
If you want, you can always award the main path

634
00:50:58,998 --> 00:51:03,340
with special items or access to different parts of the map

635
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,341
if you so choose, or even different endings,

636
00:51:05,401 --> 00:51:06,922
as we've seen with some other games.

637
00:51:07,823 --> 00:51:10,464
And if you think about it, it actually increases your replay

638
00:51:10,504 --> 00:51:13,025
value, because if you let the players go all the way

639
00:51:13,525 --> 00:51:14,426
to the ending.

640
00:51:15,237 --> 00:51:20,520
They would enjoy and probably want to return to the bosses again, play them in like the

641
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,461
original main path.

642
00:51:23,021 --> 00:51:25,883
It also exposes more people to your art.

643
00:51:26,363 --> 00:51:33,847
And this is a personal thing for me because I spent around two months working on an ending

644
00:51:34,327 --> 00:51:40,791
for Mushroom 11 that only less than 10% of the players actually reached because the bosses,

645
00:51:41,051 --> 00:51:43,933
for example, and other challenges were extremely difficult.

646
00:51:45,551 --> 00:51:49,874
And most importantly, this allows us to really work

647
00:51:49,894 --> 00:51:53,376
towards true inclusiveness, while not

648
00:51:53,436 --> 00:51:54,897
skipping on the actual challenge.

649
00:51:56,158 --> 00:51:59,400
So in summary, I'm just going to call this out real quick.

650
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:00,961
These are the rules.

651
00:52:01,601 --> 00:52:05,944
Reward, tell a story, locally source, skill test and intro,

652
00:52:06,264 --> 00:52:09,726
do not try to kill, keep everything clear,

653
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:12,788
allow player expression during the battle,

654
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:14,309
phase wisely.

655
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,568
Mind the difficulty curve in the Delta of Chance,

656
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,889
and of course most importantly in boss battles,

657
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:21,590
rules are meant to be broken.

658
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:23,210
Thank you very much.

659
00:52:33,475 --> 00:52:37,157
If you have any questions, you can line up in front of the mics

660
00:52:39,138 --> 00:52:39,738
if we have time.

661
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,840
Yeah, three minutes.

662
00:52:44,721 --> 00:52:44,881
Go ahead.

663
00:52:46,124 --> 00:52:49,126
Hey, so you went over a lot of, obviously,

664
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,748
what the best bosses in games are.

665
00:52:50,788 --> 00:52:54,050
But what are the worst tropes that you would consider?

666
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:57,593
So I had a bunch of those.

667
00:52:58,734 --> 00:53:02,517
And just as respect to my fellow designers,

668
00:53:02,577 --> 00:53:05,359
I try to avoid showing too many bad examples.

669
00:53:05,899 --> 00:53:07,921
I touched on a couple of things that I found.

670
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:15,559
not as useful. I showed, I think some of the bosses in Shinobi, for example,

671
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:21,123
kind of implemented some things that I would not necessarily implement in my own games.

672
00:53:23,185 --> 00:53:25,607
And again, I didn't want to talk about this too much, but

673
00:53:26,047 --> 00:53:28,709
some of the bosses and challenges in my own game

674
00:53:28,869 --> 00:53:32,352
were extremely difficult and this is, this

675
00:53:32,552 --> 00:53:35,815
all has been a personal learning for me,

676
00:53:35,995 --> 00:53:37,176
figuring out how.

677
00:53:38,203 --> 00:53:45,649
And what makes a good boss battle, so I think I would definitely say my own game has some flaws

678
00:53:49,632 --> 00:53:54,536
So you mentioned having an easy mode for skipping really or some ways skipping really hard bosses

679
00:53:54,596 --> 00:53:56,878
But easy mode has a little bit of a stigma

680
00:53:57,739 --> 00:54:01,182
With a lot of players is there a different way that that could be presented than just saying

681
00:54:02,182 --> 00:54:03,203
easy mode for bosses

682
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:09,465
So actually, one of the things that I try to kind of mention in my final slide there

683
00:54:09,585 --> 00:54:12,367
is that we actually need to battle the stigma.

684
00:54:13,248 --> 00:54:16,470
Sure, I mean, we can figure out other ways of introducing easy mode,

685
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:23,274
and I do agree that I don't like using UI to tell you what you're playing.

686
00:54:23,434 --> 00:54:27,457
This kind of puts you in the mindset, this primes you into thinking

687
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:30,739
that you're actually not as good as you are by just saying the word easy.

688
00:54:31,215 --> 00:54:33,996
So that's a really important point, and I do agree with you.

689
00:54:34,856 --> 00:54:39,377
However, the idea that we need to care about what some people

690
00:54:39,477 --> 00:54:42,618
say because they don't feel that other players deserve

691
00:54:42,658 --> 00:54:44,839
to play the hard mode is something

692
00:54:44,859 --> 00:54:46,499
that we as designers need to challenge.

693
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,960
I think this one.

694
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:50,820
Oh, hey.

695
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:51,440
Great talk.

696
00:54:52,474 --> 00:54:57,117
So, Breath of the Wild, my experience with that was I played as much of the game as possible

697
00:54:57,157 --> 00:55:01,160
before getting to the final boss, and the final boss was super short because I was way

698
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:06,943
overpowered and I felt like I sort of missed the intended experience, or at least I felt

699
00:55:07,024 --> 00:55:10,186
as if it wasn't as satisfying for me.

700
00:55:11,066 --> 00:55:13,448
Have you thought about this and what are your thoughts?

701
00:55:13,968 --> 00:55:14,929
I hated that fight.

702
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:21,013
We were very, me and Julia, we played it together and we got to the boss.

703
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:23,006
with a lot of power.

704
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:26,347
And I actually didn't like that battle too much.

705
00:55:26,427 --> 00:55:33,229
I thought it was, I don't know, laid out in a way that was kind of extended too much.

706
00:55:34,089 --> 00:55:39,811
I actually like most of, a lot of the boss battles that Nintendo has

707
00:55:40,691 --> 00:55:44,673
that kind of have everything laid out very well,

708
00:55:44,753 --> 00:55:48,554
where every phase has a different challenge.

709
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:52,000
And I think maybe part of the thing, and to be fair,

710
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,442
one of the amazing things that I love so much about Breath of the Wild is that

711
00:55:55,922 --> 00:55:59,705
you can have multiple approaches to every single thing.

712
00:56:00,965 --> 00:56:05,848
But the problem is that you can't balance everything to the maximum.

713
00:56:06,189 --> 00:56:09,111
So in some cases, there are some strategies that are just better.

714
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:11,152
And you probably found those.

715
00:56:11,932 --> 00:56:15,555
And I didn't. And I'll ask you what he did later.

716
00:56:15,755 --> 00:56:18,456
But honestly, I think this...

717
00:56:19,116 --> 00:56:22,657
really allows this elaborate expression space for the players.

718
00:56:22,737 --> 00:56:26,479
So in some sense, I think maybe you played it very well,

719
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:28,079
and you missed some of the things.

720
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,661
That's part of the challenge for designing it.

721
00:56:33,702 --> 00:56:36,103
So in a game that's focused around boss battles,

722
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,563
like Shadow of the Colossus, how would these rules change?

723
00:56:38,664 --> 00:56:43,225
How do you continue to teach or connect to the minions

724
00:56:43,265 --> 00:56:44,906
when there aren't minions, there are just bosses?

725
00:56:46,753 --> 00:56:48,654
That's actually a great example.

726
00:56:48,714 --> 00:56:55,039
I was trying to not go over too many things because already I had 115 slides.

727
00:56:57,241 --> 00:56:59,562
Basically, the idea of Boss Rush and games that

728
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:08,694
only have bosses. I think Monster Hunter is a great example of kind of the non-linear way of

729
00:57:09,695 --> 00:57:19,320
giving you the choice of when to challenge a certain boss. But in this case, the way I see

730
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:27,724
Shadow of the Colossus is that really, if you think about it, every boss or every colossus

731
00:57:29,385 --> 00:57:29,465
is

732
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:31,753
is a level.

733
00:57:32,734 --> 00:57:36,835
And that level usually has multiple different challenges throughout that level.

734
00:57:36,975 --> 00:57:43,517
And usually, towards the end of the level, for example, the head of that monster, that's

735
00:57:43,577 --> 00:57:44,898
the boss, if you think about it.

736
00:57:46,158 --> 00:57:50,580
But each one of them, and that's something that I enjoyed tremendously in that game,

737
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:55,502
is that each one of those bosses introduces something else.

738
00:57:57,242 --> 00:57:59,803
So I thought it worked out for that game.

739
00:58:00,749 --> 00:58:01,910
I hope that answers your question.

740
00:58:04,432 --> 00:58:08,654
First of all, thank you kindly for giving this highly insightful speech.

741
00:58:09,135 --> 00:58:14,859
Now, earlier during the talk, actually at the very beginning, you did mention Silent Hill Homecoming.

742
00:58:15,419 --> 00:58:22,464
And that got me thinking, how exactly do you try to get boss fights right in a survival horror game,

743
00:58:22,524 --> 00:58:28,528
which emphasizes tension through tight resource management and also feelings of...

744
00:58:29,156 --> 00:58:32,338
Occasional helplessness and powerful powerlessness.

745
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:34,580
Oh, that's a great question.

746
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:38,462
And to be fair, I only played a few.

747
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:44,326
So what I what I felt is that in terms

748
00:58:44,346 --> 00:58:48,649
in terms of the boss battles in Silent Hill, really

749
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:52,912
what I saw, this is a great example

750
00:58:53,052 --> 00:58:53,792
how the theme.

751
00:58:55,161 --> 00:58:57,122
really worked out with the mechanic.

752
00:58:57,422 --> 00:59:03,324
In this case, as you said, this anxiousness,

753
00:59:03,344 --> 00:59:05,364
this pressure that you feel while playing it,

754
00:59:06,205 --> 00:59:10,186
really gets complemented by the visuals in some way.

755
00:59:10,546 --> 00:59:13,627
It could have been, by the way, just as useful,

756
00:59:13,687 --> 00:59:17,849
if you think about it, if this would be a kind of a happy,

757
00:59:19,449 --> 00:59:20,169
smiley face.

758
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:22,910
But the idea of creating this.

759
00:59:25,178 --> 00:59:34,840
this perfectly unified set of behaviors and mechanics that technology supports,

760
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:39,582
the mechanics that support the visuals. I think that worked out very well. I'm not

761
00:59:39,602 --> 00:59:43,743
sure if I answered your question though. No, I think you answered it pretty well. Thank you.

762
00:59:46,391 --> 00:59:49,752
Thanks again as well, and you put a lot of work into that which is fantastic.

763
00:59:49,772 --> 00:59:51,332
We went through a whole lot of examples.

764
00:59:51,992 --> 00:59:55,113
The majority of those examples were single-player boss battles.

765
00:59:55,173 --> 00:59:58,754
Do your rules change? Does your focus change when we're looking at multiplayer

766
00:59:58,794 --> 01:00:02,254
and particularly more than just two people attacking a boss?

767
01:00:03,034 --> 01:00:06,155
I think this is a great example, but if you think about it,

768
01:00:06,175 --> 01:00:10,056
it actually answers the same question, because you need to ask yourself

769
01:00:10,216 --> 01:00:14,057
what are the skills that you're trying to challenge.

770
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:14,117
So...

771
01:00:16,927 --> 01:00:20,691
I don't think I would be able to play Atheon very well.

772
01:00:20,711 --> 01:00:23,573
I know I wouldn't.

773
01:00:23,973 --> 01:00:29,558
So this is one of those things that as I'm seeing other people play it, I can see how

774
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:35,423
they created a set of challenges that are particularly there and not in other bosses

775
01:00:35,463 --> 01:00:40,768
necessarily to challenge the collaboration.

776
01:00:41,028 --> 01:00:44,791
For example, in a lot of bosses in Destiny.

777
01:00:45,623 --> 01:00:48,065
You can see where other players are.

778
01:00:48,385 --> 01:00:51,027
So they created this time poll so you couldn't see that.

779
01:00:51,888 --> 01:00:55,991
So for every different skill, you create a challenge,

780
01:00:56,231 --> 01:00:57,352
kind of a negative space.

781
01:00:57,392 --> 01:01:00,334
So it's easy to talk about negative space in 2D games or

782
01:01:00,554 --> 01:01:03,516
3D games, where I want you to jump, so I'm going to shoot a

783
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:04,977
couple of times to make sure that you jump

784
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:05,958
as high as possible.

785
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:10,421
But also, if I want to challenge your collaboration,

786
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:12,803
then I'm going to put the players in a position that

787
01:01:12,843 --> 01:01:13,744
they can't see each other.

788
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:25,917
Hey, so how would you handle having multiple, like, a boss battle in a game that has, is like a hero-based shooter or something like that?

789
01:01:26,037 --> 01:01:34,103
So, for example, if Overwatch had a boss battle and you could choose any of their 24 characters,

790
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:41,809
like, assuming that the design philosophy is not to limit player choice in which characters they can bring into that battle.

791
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:45,712
Um, sorry, I, I, can you, can you...

792
01:01:46,706 --> 01:01:47,487
Repeat that question.

793
01:01:47,567 --> 01:01:47,988
I think I...

794
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:49,011
Sure, yeah.

795
01:01:49,131 --> 01:01:52,839
Just, it's a pretty vague question, but like, what are some ideas on how you would handle

796
01:01:52,879 --> 01:01:54,383
a boss battle that...

797
01:01:56,030 --> 01:02:01,313
Like where the player basically has too many options available and how they could approach the battle.

798
01:02:01,473 --> 01:02:08,496
I think that's a great point because I was talking about the player expression space is something that is underutilized right now.

799
01:02:08,656 --> 01:02:10,197
There are a lot of bosses that

800
01:02:11,317 --> 01:02:17,860
the expression space is limited to, you know, am I going to jump over two bullets or one bullet at a time?

801
01:02:19,401 --> 01:02:20,381
And they showed

802
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:25,483
Ornstein and Smough from Dark Souls, which gives you this idea of like, okay, I'm gonna go through.

803
01:02:26,365 --> 01:02:28,586
I'll go through this one first.

804
01:02:29,527 --> 01:02:34,529
When you have too much choice, you have choice paralysis.

805
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:38,612
So in some way, I think that's also the art of designing.

806
01:02:39,152 --> 01:02:45,356
And to be fair, I think that's why I led my talk here,

807
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:48,177
to talk first about the skill set

808
01:02:48,337 --> 01:02:49,818
that you would like to challenge.

809
01:02:50,298 --> 01:02:53,500
Once you establish a skill set, or a multiple skill set,

810
01:02:54,078 --> 01:02:59,322
But there has to be some sort of clarity in what you're choosing,

811
01:02:59,402 --> 01:03:01,784
what you're presenting, what you're challenging the player with.

812
01:03:02,224 --> 01:03:06,228
I think that just presenting too many different things

813
01:03:06,648 --> 01:03:11,732
kind of puts you in a point where the player would be helpless, in a sense.

814
01:03:12,433 --> 01:03:15,956
So I think, again, that's part of my point.

815
01:03:15,976 --> 01:03:16,896
There's no...

816
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,461
perfect way to tell you how to design a boss.

817
01:03:21,501 --> 01:03:23,222
Like, how do you place the bullets?

818
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:26,163
What kind of, you know, how it moves from side to side?

819
01:03:26,183 --> 01:03:29,004
How do you, you know, you attack towards the player

820
01:03:29,084 --> 01:03:30,104
or towards where they're going?

821
01:03:30,364 --> 01:03:32,005
All these things are, you know,

822
01:03:32,045 --> 01:03:35,166
eventually it's the art of designing.

823
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:38,167
But in a sense, just having the clear view

824
01:03:38,267 --> 01:03:39,507
of what you're challenging,

825
01:03:40,668 --> 01:03:42,188
I think that's extremely important.

826
01:03:42,288 --> 01:03:45,890
And that needs to be limited, but not singular.

827
01:03:48,082 --> 01:03:50,560
I think we're out of time, so thank you very much.
