1
00:00:06,852 --> 00:00:10,433
We're here to talk about War Remains, which hopefully some of you have seen it.

2
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:15,115
It's a VR experience that transports viewers to the front lines of the Western

3
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:16,415
front in the first world war.

4
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:21,056
Um, and I first of all, just kind of want to introduce some of the people who are

5
00:00:21,096 --> 00:00:21,637
involved in it.

6
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:27,638
Uh, it was created by Madison Wells media, uh, and Ethan Stern's back here taking

7
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:28,018
pictures.

8
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:30,259
Hi, Ethan.

9
00:00:31,054 --> 00:00:31,415
Hi Ethan.

10
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:37,003
So Madison Wells, incredible group, they like to bring creative storytellers together to

11
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:44,394
make impressive, incredible, interactive entertainment, create, produce and distribute.

12
00:00:45,217 --> 00:00:47,941
I'm also involved as Flight School Studio, and that's me.

13
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,543
I'm executive producer at Flight School.

14
00:00:49,563 --> 00:00:50,224
My name's Taylor.

15
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:53,268
It was directed by Brandon Oldenburg.

16
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:56,733
He's our CCO, produced by head of production Jen Kattack.

17
00:00:58,155 --> 00:01:00,578
We're a studio based in Dallas.

18
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:02,000
We've done a lot of.

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,102
VR work and AR work.

20
00:01:04,342 --> 00:01:06,644
We just launched a game on Switch a couple of weeks ago

21
00:01:07,564 --> 00:01:10,246
with Madison Wells called Creature in the Well.

22
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:13,929
Did a project called Manifest 99.

23
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:16,951
It was an Emmy-nominated VR project.

24
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:20,994
So we have done a lot of IP as well as branded work,

25
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:24,137
including the Oculus VR for Good program.

26
00:01:24,157 --> 00:01:26,859
Then with me is Mac.

27
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:29,361
Mac, you want to kind of introduce yourself and your team?

28
00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:35,682
Sure, my name is Mac Smith and I work at Skywalker Sound here in the Bay Area,

29
00:01:36,142 --> 00:01:38,263
about 45 minutes north and west Marin.

30
00:01:38,823 --> 00:01:42,824
And I've worked there as a project employee for about 19 years now.

31
00:01:42,844 --> 00:01:49,305
I've worked on all kinds of projects from Toy Story 3, Tron Legacy, Rango.

32
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:52,166
I was a sound effects recordist on Avengers Endgame.

33
00:01:52,974 --> 00:01:57,136
I also work on documentaries, a couple of theme park experiences.

34
00:01:58,316 --> 00:02:03,219
But coming to VR was brand new for me because I come from the world of cinematic sound design,

35
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:10,243
you know, really linear storytelling. So this was a completely new thing for me and I definitely

36
00:02:10,403 --> 00:02:14,905
learned a lot from the experience. I was not the only one part of the team at Skywalker.

37
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:19,028
My co-supervising sound editor was Bill Rudolph.

38
00:02:19,788 --> 00:02:25,952
A very talented sound designer who comes more from the video game and VR experience. He was involved with Carnet Arena.

39
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:31,897
Among other things, Mike Brinkman was the technical sound designer. So he was really the

40
00:02:31,997 --> 00:02:38,882
implementer of all the sounds and he also created material. Steve Morris, our head of engineering at

41
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:44,686
Skywalker, is a mad genius and I have to give credit to him. And then Damien Kastbauer, who's here,

42
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:45,887
came out for

43
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:57,080
A couple weeks at the start and helped us get the experience stood up and is such a great spirit and encouraging, especially someone like me who doesn't come from the VR world.

44
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:00,503
So that's that's kind of my team there.

45
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:05,930
And then I want to talk about Dan Carlin, who's in the center of that picture there.

46
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:06,010
Dan.

47
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:12,612
is known most of all for this incredibly popular podcast called Hardcore History.

48
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:18,653
If you haven't heard it, it's amazing. He's got this knowledge and enthusiasm for

49
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:25,094
history that I've never seen before. One of his most famous podcasts is called

50
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:31,935
The Blueprint for Armageddon, which is a six-part, 23-hour-long series just about World War I.

51
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:33,716
You think, like, how could I sit through 23 hours? It's incredible.

52
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:39,277
I mean, how do you tackle a subject like World War I, you know, in the first place?

53
00:03:39,337 --> 00:03:45,238
And he finds an amazing way to get, you know, a macro perspective and a micro perspective

54
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:49,859
and talking about big picture things and then dialing way down into like a single person's

55
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:50,559
experience.

56
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:58,761
So Dan was the one who really thought of this project and he wanted to figure out like how

57
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:04,223
could you take somebody and have them walk a mile in the moccasins of like a soldier

58
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:05,123
in World War I.

59
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:11,526
He was thinking, you know, yeah, you could do a TV show or you could do a movie or a video game,

60
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:15,568
but what's something that you could do that you could really immerse somebody in

61
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:22,912
by making them feel like they're a soldier in a trench in the western front of the First World War?

62
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:28,274
And, like, how can you really make them feel like they're there and fool their brain?

63
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:31,316
He kept referring to, like, I want to tap into people's lizard brain.

64
00:04:32,236 --> 00:04:35,158
And VR seemed like the best way to do it.

65
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:43,725
So it's like, yeah, a way to put people in this situation that previously was unimaginable that they could experience.

66
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:46,787
Yeah, absolutely. I think one of the things that's really interesting about...

67
00:04:47,347 --> 00:05:04,856
Dan and his approach to content like this is that he is fascinated by extreme situations and not for the stats of it or for the just the insanity of it before the humanity in that situation. And how do people respond when they're put in these these crazy, crazy places?

68
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:15,565
And that's really what the jumping off point of this experience was, is we don't want to create an experience that's telling you a bunch of facts about World War I.

69
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:27,036
We want to just drop you into it, and we want to give you a chance to see what it's like, to feel it, to experience it viscerally instead of removed and separated and kind of intellectually.

70
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:32,782
And so one of the things that's really important about this experience, and we'll talk about this a lot,

71
00:05:33,382 --> 00:05:38,147
is that there's a major physical component to the experience.

72
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:43,292
Everything that you're seeing digitally is recreated with a high degree of detail physically.

73
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:50,036
And so one of the first challenges that we had is how do you introduce somebody to that concept?

74
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:56,621
How do you tease it? How do you put together a trailer for something that relies so heavily on the physical?

75
00:05:57,281 --> 00:06:06,327
And so the way that Dan wanted to approach that is let's lean into the history and the authenticity that's going into everything that we're doing.

76
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:13,411
So he put together this trailer, we put together this trailer, where Dan Carlin, who you'll hear here, is reading a letter.

77
00:06:14,232 --> 00:06:20,796
From a soldier in the first world war that he was actually riding home to his daughter Marjorie at Christmas in

78
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:22,197
1916 now at this point

79
00:06:29,562 --> 00:06:30,703
My dear little Marjorie

80
00:06:32,664 --> 00:06:36,967
I've only just received your little letter which mama sent with hers on November 19th

81
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:42,030
Do you remember that you asked me to be home for Christmas? I only wish I could

82
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:47,544
But there are many more soldiers in our battery who are more entitled to the Christmas leave than I am.

83
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:51,605
So I'm afraid you will have to do without Daddy this Christmas.

84
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,565
Santa Claus will come, shoo-shoo.

85
00:06:55,605 --> 00:06:57,246
Daddy is as comfortable as possible.

86
00:06:57,806 --> 00:07:01,587
I expect even you would get tired enough to go silently sleep in this dugout.

87
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:04,767
It would be a change from your pink bedroom.

88
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,968
Right again soon, dear.

89
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:10,708
Heaps of love and kisses from your ever-loving Daddy.

90
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:25,097
So the soldier who was writing that Gunnar Wilfred Cove died in 1917 and that letter

91
00:07:25,157 --> 00:07:27,098
was found in his pocket.

92
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:33,203
And we don't mention it overtly in that trailer in the experience anywhere, but it's this

93
00:07:33,363 --> 00:07:38,866
kind of subtle subtext that's I think woven into the trailer and you get a sense of it

94
00:07:39,006 --> 00:07:39,407
anyway.

95
00:07:40,387 --> 00:07:42,048
And a lot of that I think comes down to the sound design.

96
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:45,231
Do you want to talk about how you approached that and some of the thoughts that went into

97
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:45,311
it?

98
00:07:45,891 --> 00:08:12,619
Sure, Bill Rudolph gets all the credit for the sound in the trailer and it's interesting when he originally saw this cut, he was told like, oh, you know, this, we need to cut it down, it's not right, it's not going to work. And he's like, whoa, like, let me just put some sound to it and we'll see, see how it works. And, and this ended up, they ended up not changing the picture because the sound works so well. And he decided to go for a very expressionistic way with the sound. I mean, yeah, we could have like,

99
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:20,522
Artillery pounding, but instead of focusing on, you know, little unique details, one at a time.

100
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:25,843
You know, and that's a lot of what sound can do. It's like creating that feeling, that mood.

101
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:32,486
Walter Murch, who I don't know if any of you have heard of, he's a very famous sound designer from Apocalypse Now.

102
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:34,326
And is here in the Bay Area.

103
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:47,815
He has a lot of fascinating things to say about the power of sound, but one of it is, you know, people are so used to visuals, you know, we're a visual creature, but sound was really the very first sense that any of us ever experienced in the womb before sight.

104
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:58,363
So it has this this feeling. And while visuals sneak in through the front door of your brain through your eyes, sound can even even, you know, sneak in through the back door.

105
00:08:58,963 --> 00:09:03,286
And sort of play with your emotions without you being conscious of why you're feeling a certain way.

106
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:06,088
So we found that was really important in this.

107
00:09:07,468 --> 00:09:11,351
I wish we had better headphones for y'all to hear right now, but I think you could still get it.

108
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:16,534
And I apologize, you're not getting the stereo effect or the low end that we want you to hear.

109
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:17,435
But just imagine.

110
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:20,997
So let's kind of just talk about the overview of the experience a little bit.

111
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:26,521
It debuted at Tribeca and it's currently set up in its own location in Austin.

112
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:34,163
And so we transport these viewers, the people who come to see it, to the front lines of World War I.

113
00:09:34,923 --> 00:09:39,684
And it's roughly 650 square feet in the experience.

114
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:45,446
And you're actually in a trench that's modeled very closely after a World War I trench.

115
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:48,449
And when you reach out and touch things, they're there.

116
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:54,657
We had a really large focus on the tactile set and how that interplayed with the visuals.

117
00:09:55,739 --> 00:10:00,825
We wanted to make sure that the digital, the physical, and the sound were all blended together

118
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,708
really harmoniously and seamlessly.

119
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:06,123
So that we establish this persistence of illusion.

120
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:09,485
You know, it's something we talked about a lot as we were producing it.

121
00:10:09,905 --> 00:10:14,447
We didn't want you to have anything that you could remind yourself, that you could reach

122
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:18,630
out and not touch, that you could remind yourself wasn't real, that you weren't there.

123
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,451
Anything that you interact with.

124
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:25,254
We're not the first project to do that.

125
00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:32,258
You mentioned Carne before that obviously had that in spades and Hero and several others.

126
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:39,282
But I think that what's really interesting about this is the level of detail in all of those sets.

127
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:45,946
When you reach out and touch something, it's not just there's a block where there needs to be a block, but the texture is right and it feels right.

128
00:10:46,006 --> 00:10:47,928
Yeah, I've never seen an experience that's built.

129
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:54,596
In this detail, it's incredible. The sandbags, the corrugated metal, everything. What you see is what you feel.

130
00:10:55,136 --> 00:11:00,603
So this next video I'm going to play just kind of cuts back and forth between the digital experience and the physical,

131
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:02,886
so that you can kind of see what we're talking about.

132
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:56,127
So when we talk about the details on the physical set, I think that I really like

133
00:11:56,167 --> 00:12:02,371
this image of holding up the rat and testing its placement. All of these

134
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:07,553
different physical pieces were installed and then tested and back and forth

135
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:11,795
between the headset and the physical and making sure that not only was it where

136
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:15,978
it needed to be, but that the experience of touching it was actually paying off

137
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:18,239
on what you wanted from the experience.

138
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:23,484
We had dangling arms and a periscope that you could interact with,

139
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:28,889
and the sandbags all over the place, and the corrugated boards.

140
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,094
Even the duck boards that you were walking on were elevated up on a little bit of foam,

141
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:35,857
so that as you stepped on it, there was a give to it,

142
00:12:35,897 --> 00:12:37,899
like you were stepping on boards laid down on mud.

143
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,642
And we took that idea and you start the experience in this hot air balloon.

144
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:50,065
And we used the same concept of that foam to put that air balloon up on even more foam.

145
00:12:50,445 --> 00:12:54,046
So that as you step the one side of the basket to the other, it has a sway to it.

146
00:12:54,427 --> 00:12:57,348
And it was a really nice kind of, you know, low-tech solve for,

147
00:12:57,368 --> 00:13:01,650
I want this balloon to feel like it's actually swaying in the breeze.

148
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:06,092
It just happens to be doing it from your own weight instead of us moving you around hydraulically.

149
00:13:07,073 --> 00:13:12,537
And those rats, I think, are one of the best examples of that. As we first had those rats installed,

150
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:15,480
we reached out and touched them and they felt like teddy bears.

151
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:20,184
And that wasn't the reaction that we wanted people to have. So,

152
00:13:20,204 --> 00:13:25,048
we actually went in and sliced them open and took some of the stuffing out and then put

153
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:32,694
little rib cages in there and sewed them back up and put some hot glue on them so that the coats felt nappy because they just

154
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:35,317
You know, been running around in these trenches in the mud.

155
00:13:35,577 --> 00:13:36,198
Ew. Yuck.

156
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:38,901
Yeah. So when you reach out and touch these rats, it's like,

157
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:43,305
not only are you at first you're like, oh, holy cow, they actually put the rats there.

158
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:45,368
But then you feel them and you're like, oh, my gosh,

159
00:13:45,888 --> 00:13:50,733
you have this really, really strong visceral reaction that you want to step back.

160
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:54,618
And and that level of detail just carried through the entire experience.

161
00:13:55,063 --> 00:13:57,664
Yeah, and audio is obviously a huge part of that.

162
00:13:57,944 --> 00:14:01,345
Our team had to match the great attention to detail

163
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:02,885
that they were doing on the visual side

164
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,206
and the physical side.

165
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:06,006
It was very important.

166
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:09,187
So getting into a little bit of the research,

167
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:12,287
Dan Carlin definitely took the lead on this

168
00:14:12,347 --> 00:14:14,488
and provided us with a lot of material

169
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:19,509
to dive into and to look at from old photographs, paintings,

170
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:20,309
things like that.

171
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:23,450
His podcast was actually a great resource.

172
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:33,959
So as far as the location of where this is supposed to take place, this was the Battle of Passchendaele, 1917 Belgium, which is fairly late into World War One.

173
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:41,278
And, you know, I didn't learn tremendous about World War I in school, so it was great, like,

174
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:46,462
sort of diving into this and realizing that World War I was a huge shift in technology,

175
00:14:48,023 --> 00:14:50,105
that battles had not really been fought this way.

176
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:55,389
You know, it was the first time that machine guns were really used a lot in a war.

177
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,772
Tanks came into effect, you know, later on in the war.

178
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:00,013
Airplanes, obviously.

179
00:15:01,073 --> 00:15:04,536
And barbed wire, believe it or not, you know, caused significant deaths.

180
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:06,077
So that was a new weapon.

181
00:15:07,238 --> 00:15:12,081
You know, and Dan always talks about, you know, things are bad, but it can always get

182
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:12,422
worse.

183
00:15:14,903 --> 00:15:19,747
So, yeah, we, you know, one thing that Dan kept harping on is he wanted for the people

184
00:15:19,827 --> 00:15:22,109
going through this experience to experience drum fire.

185
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,111
and what is drum fire?

186
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,874
It was this horrific amount of explosions and sounds

187
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,096
that would happen that, in a large part,

188
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:32,117
would drive people crazy.

189
00:15:32,137 --> 00:15:33,358
You know, you hear about shell shock.

190
00:15:33,878 --> 00:15:36,040
You know, shell shock was a term that came out of World War I

191
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,702
because there were these soldiers that had experienced

192
00:15:38,862 --> 00:15:41,604
just like day after day, week after week,

193
00:15:41,684 --> 00:15:43,986
months after months, being in the same trench,

194
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:47,068
living sometimes next to their buddy

195
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:48,269
who was a dead soldier next to them.

196
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:56,636
And this drum fire was, you know, cannons on the other side, like the Germans would shoot their howitzers and cannons over.

197
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,137
And the aiming was not great.

198
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:04,142
But in order to sort of take that into effect, they would fire a lot of them all at once.

199
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:07,905
So it's explosion after explosion after explosion, quick succession.

200
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:10,968
And we don't have any recordings of those because there were, you know,

201
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:13,770
we're not great recording technology during that time frame.

202
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:19,334
So in a lot of cases, we had to take, you know, people that like soldiers,

203
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:23,817
their first count, their what they would say firsthand of what it sounded like

204
00:16:23,897 --> 00:16:26,880
and why it would make them feel like they were going crazy.

205
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:31,429
Yeah, I think that was a really interesting challenge from my point of view when you were

206
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,630
talking about that before.

207
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:38,094
The thought that you were going in and listening to what people were saying about their experience,

208
00:16:38,134 --> 00:16:42,738
and not just what did it sound like, but what did I feel because of what it sounded like

209
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:47,421
and what I was going through, and then finding ways to translate that into the sound and

210
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:53,426
the experience, but also the emotions that you're trying to instill in people as they're

211
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:54,567
going through it and they're hearing it.

212
00:16:55,327 --> 00:17:03,273
Definitely, and then it's like, you know, okay, what if someone's going to go into this experience and like you have to take an account, you know, what are they going to expect?

213
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:16,983
You know, they have a certain sense of what they think war is going to be like. So, yes, we want to be as accurate as possible, but we also want to make sure that we're also catering to people who think like, okay, I've seen a bunch of war movies.

214
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:20,539
I've seen a bunch of war movies and this is what I think it sounds like.

215
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:25,163
And also I play a bunch of video games of warfare, so we kind of had to like balance

216
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:31,250
between reality and then cinematic war and also video game war and sort of bring all

217
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:35,194
those things together with the sounds of explosions and all those things.

218
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:36,155
You can kind of see here.

219
00:17:37,877 --> 00:17:40,678
Some of the experience with the soldiers going up over the wall.

220
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:45,239
And one thing you'll also notice too is you know we're trying to create this illusion that

221
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:51,162
this is a very long trench that goes miles and miles long and there's you know warfare

222
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:55,663
happening behind you and ahead of you. You know you're actually not in a very big space but

223
00:17:55,944 --> 00:18:00,505
but we make it seem like it's huge from both a visual and a sound standpoint.

224
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:02,305
Yeah, that was really important.

225
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:04,646
And we thought about that a lot as we were kind of laying out

226
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:06,106
the physical design.

227
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:09,167
And so the way that we were able to approach that,

228
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:11,007
and we kind of had to approach it,

229
00:18:11,148 --> 00:18:13,888
was to take it in layers, right?

230
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:17,329
So we started, you can kind of see us in the upper left hand

231
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:21,030
here, taping off a space so that we could really easily,

232
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,451
really quickly iterate on, what's

233
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:25,591
the amount of space that I'm walking through?

234
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:28,713
And then we went from tape to cardboard.

235
00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:31,715
So we set up all of these giant cardboard walls.

236
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:36,158
Brandon, our director, he's a master with cardboard.

237
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:38,360
It's kind of crazy what he can do.

238
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,702
And we use that process a lot with VR experiences,

239
00:18:42,002 --> 00:18:43,783
especially when we're using a physical space

240
00:18:44,404 --> 00:18:47,166
where we want to, as quickly as possible,

241
00:18:47,286 --> 00:18:50,388
get to the heart of what's important and what's working

242
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:52,569
and see it played out in the space around you.

243
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:54,751
So we'll mock things up with cardboard a lot.

244
00:18:55,711 --> 00:19:00,114
Then we moved into plywood and setting up the plywood system.

245
00:19:00,554 --> 00:19:03,916
And then once all of that was kind of down and we were happy with the flow of it,

246
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,418
then we put the final finishes on it.

247
00:19:07,618 --> 00:19:11,881
And we worked with a great group called the Bender Brothers, built by Bender.

248
00:19:12,701 --> 00:19:16,384
And they came in and helped us iterate on this grid system

249
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:22,067
so that we could quickly pack this up and roll it out and install it places.

250
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,641
I'll play a little time lapse here, going through all of the different steps.

251
00:19:31,022 --> 00:19:35,584
We wanted to iterate a lot on the pathway that you go through.

252
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:39,485
We knew that we wanted different stages and different sections for a couple of reasons.

253
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:44,187
One was throughput was really important, and we wanted to set something up where there

254
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:44,828
were different...

255
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:46,610
This is how we were able to achieve that.

256
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:04,353
Talking about some of the hardware on this.

257
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:11,399
So this was an interesting and ambitious project for the hardware that we were using.

258
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,003
So we decided to go with the wireless Vive system,

259
00:20:16,403 --> 00:20:20,026
which came out in the middle of us, of the production on this.

260
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:24,350
You actually might have seen in a previous slide we had a backpack PC on,

261
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:28,713
which was really cumbersome and we wanted to make it a lot easier for people to...

262
00:20:29,314 --> 00:20:31,116
On board and get into the experience.

263
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:38,405
So we ended up with this final set of hardware where you're wearing a little sling that you put on.

264
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:45,333
It's got the wireless receiver in it, you've got a battery pack, you've got a headphones receiver, and then the Vive Pro and some headphones.

265
00:20:46,974 --> 00:20:50,495
We had a lot of interesting challenges working with this system.

266
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:57,497
It was our first time using the Vive wireless system, and it's very much a line-of-sight system.

267
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:01,718
There's a little bit of give, but it doesn't want to go through walls.

268
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:03,439
It certainly doesn't want to go through plywood.

269
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:19,707
So the way we ended up having to solve that was bolting the PCs to the top of the trench and actually on a shelf that was a few feet above the top of the trench so that the antenna for the wireless system could point back down into the trench and see all of the different spaces.

270
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:26,892
Which, you know, we wanted to have this bunker experience, and so we had to get up high enough that we could come down and people could see it.

271
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:31,175
That was the only place we ended up having a spot that cut out.

272
00:21:31,215 --> 00:21:35,978
If you kind of got down into the bunker and up against the wall, you could make it cut out.

273
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,020
But it was fun.

274
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:46,553
And both Flight School and Madison Wells were really great in letting us at Skywalker help pick which headphones we were going to use.

275
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:52,495
And we actually tested a lot. We spent probably two months deciding which headphones to use.

276
00:21:52,515 --> 00:22:00,177
Because this had to be an experience where people could hear the full fidelity of what at least we thought World War I sounded like.

277
00:22:01,617 --> 00:22:05,139
to really give that low-end feeling and all that.

278
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:10,623
So we ended up with the Fostex closed-back audiophile headphones,

279
00:22:10,683 --> 00:22:12,764
the TH-X00.

280
00:22:13,284 --> 00:22:16,166
They're the ones that you can see sort of the wood grain on the side.

281
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:24,109
And while those are great headphones, we still weren't quite feeling the explosions and all those things.

282
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:31,132
So we were able to at least, we got involved early enough in the project that we were able to tell Flight School,

283
00:22:31,172 --> 00:22:36,114
you know, hey is there a way to build these transducers into the floor of the experience,

284
00:22:36,714 --> 00:22:41,856
which give you a visceral feeling that they're timed with, you know, a lot of explosions.

285
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:43,016
You're feeling the low end.

286
00:22:43,457 --> 00:22:48,219
through your feet. So it's tricking your brain that there's a massive subwoofer in the room

287
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,681
or you're really there and feeling that stuff. So there were these, I think it was believed,

288
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:58,704
four transducers that were put into the experience and they were discrete channels and floor zones

289
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:05,106
and they didn't just rumble. We were actually able to send specific audio to them in those

290
00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:09,348
frequencies so we could really shape them to work with what you're hearing in the headphones.

291
00:23:09,528 --> 00:23:12,049
Yeah, we frustrated a lot of animators in our studios.

292
00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:15,850
We had those those set up and testing right next to where they were working.

293
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:22,351
And and speaking of that, one thing that I came across,

294
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:26,112
you know, we were at Skywalker and while we didn't have the physical space,

295
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:30,733
we were able to sort of map out on the floor and walk through this experience and test it.

296
00:23:32,373 --> 00:23:38,074
I would go into the bunker section and suddenly my eyes were in the ceiling.

297
00:23:38,954 --> 00:23:41,638
It was like, wait a second, like, this isn't great.

298
00:23:41,698 --> 00:23:44,222
Like, like, this totally takes me out of the experience.

299
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:45,725
Yeah, I never, I never saw that.

300
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:47,087
You didn't? Why not?

301
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:50,492
Because I'm, yeah, I'm this tall and you're that tall.

302
00:23:50,592 --> 00:23:53,056
So makes a difference. You gotta, you gotta test things.

303
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,082
Yeah, Bill told me, because he had been down at flight school,

304
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,344
he's like, oh yeah, all those guys are like under six feet.

305
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:02,085
So this is, yeah, definitely a valid concern.

306
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:05,327
And so we were able to put that in and they were able to raise up virtually

307
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:06,968
the ceiling of the bunker.

308
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:10,331
And we'll show you a little bit of the bunker scene now.

309
00:24:10,511 --> 00:24:12,592
Yeah, thankfully, that was easy enough to adjust.

310
00:24:25,253 --> 00:24:32,126
Remember something, I don't care how bad it seems, on the western front of the first world war, things can always get worse.

311
00:24:50,353 --> 00:24:53,595
So in that moment there, you know, you were sort of the tail end of the bunker,

312
00:24:53,695 --> 00:24:57,497
hearing Dan's voice, which is obviously leading the experience and very

313
00:24:57,517 --> 00:25:01,578
important, but then we, you know, after the series of drum fire, you know,

314
00:25:01,598 --> 00:25:03,739
you've really been pummeled with the sound.

315
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:08,761
We got into that more stylized section of like hearing the blood flowing and

316
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:12,283
your heart beating for, for the person experiencing it.

317
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,993
And then back out into the final section of the experience.

318
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:23,016
Yeah, I mean, sound is so important.

319
00:25:23,197 --> 00:25:24,277
I keep harping on that.

320
00:25:24,597 --> 00:25:27,259
But that's what really sort of sells this whole experience.

321
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:29,621
And part of the thing that was nice about this

322
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:32,282
is that this is not a long experience.

323
00:25:32,422 --> 00:25:35,404
It may be 8 to 10 minutes, maybe a little bit longer.

324
00:25:35,604 --> 00:25:38,446
Yeah, it depends on how quickly you want to go through it.

325
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:39,647
I think most people are closer to 15.

326
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:39,727
OK.

327
00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:42,548
But that's like, OK, 15 minutes.

328
00:25:43,068 --> 00:25:45,929
It's not, you know, we can really have the intensity

329
00:25:46,189 --> 00:25:47,149
ratcheted way up.

330
00:25:48,229 --> 00:25:50,250
Unlike if this is a much longer experience, you know,

331
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,890
somebody just couldn't deal with that much intensity.

332
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,551
So when you're in the trench, you know, there's explosions

333
00:25:55,591 --> 00:25:57,771
and explosions and shouting, and you're

334
00:25:57,811 --> 00:25:58,632
hearing all this stuff.

335
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:01,712
Instead of like in a movie where it's like, OK, we're

336
00:26:01,772 --> 00:26:03,633
quiet, and we're going to be loud here, and we're going to

337
00:26:03,653 --> 00:26:04,253
be loud here.

338
00:26:04,843 --> 00:26:10,366
And then loud later on, it was like, OK, we're going to be, you know, it starts off pretty quiet, but then it's going to be really loud.

339
00:26:10,386 --> 00:26:15,509
Let's find a couple moments where we can duck out and be quiet, which was a nice, nice change of pace.

340
00:26:15,629 --> 00:26:19,251
And the other great thing about this experience is, you know, we didn't have any music to contend with.

341
00:26:20,131 --> 00:26:25,412
It was really just Dan's voice and the sound effects and the other audio.

342
00:26:25,452 --> 00:26:29,253
You know, the one thing that I brought to this experience, which the other guys coming

343
00:26:29,313 --> 00:26:34,894
from VR and video games didn't have, was, you know, in cinema we were often dealing

344
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:38,915
with, you know, foley teams, which, yeah, you deal with that in video games to some

345
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:44,356
degree, but I was experienced with how to make sure that we get all the character movements

346
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,756
for the soldiers coming out of the trench.

347
00:26:46,156 --> 00:26:49,918
We're hearing all their gear, we're hearing their body falls and all those things that

348
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:50,738
are very specific.

349
00:26:51,118 --> 00:26:56,561
And then also Loop Group, we hired a professional set of actors to come in who could do convincing

350
00:26:56,621 --> 00:27:00,982
English accents, who could also shout at the top of their lungs and not lose their voice

351
00:27:01,863 --> 00:27:02,623
after three takes.

352
00:27:04,104 --> 00:27:09,286
So we got different people to do voices for both the English soldiers and then later on

353
00:27:09,366 --> 00:27:11,487
some of the German soldiers that you see in the distance.

354
00:27:12,287 --> 00:27:15,809
And then it's like, how do you put all that stuff together and how do you make it work?

355
00:27:15,989 --> 00:27:22,392
With Damien's help, we set up a lot of systems early on to do things like you're coming down in a balloon and we're hearing thunder.

356
00:27:22,412 --> 00:27:26,714
And that thunder gradually transitions into artillery explosions.

357
00:27:26,894 --> 00:27:30,216
And that was pretty cool and interesting and randomizing wind.

358
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:32,897
And then setting up systems to launch.

359
00:27:33,857 --> 00:27:37,599
You're hearing the launch of the howitzers and artillery coming over your head.

360
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:42,504
And, you know, that was kind of great to sort of initially get set up, but as we progressed

361
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:45,707
and progressed and kept adding more layers, a lot of that stuff sort of ended up pushing

362
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:46,468
to the background.

363
00:27:46,908 --> 00:27:49,411
And we were focused on, you know, really what you're seeing.

364
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:53,155
And also, you know, creating the illusion of hearing soldiers around you that you don't

365
00:27:53,235 --> 00:27:53,335
see.

366
00:27:54,176 --> 00:27:56,277
And then how do you contend with that with Dan's voice?

367
00:27:56,297 --> 00:27:59,058
Because Dan's voice had to be paramount.

368
00:27:59,338 --> 00:28:01,359
So we created a lot of ducking systems.

369
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:05,502
So when his voice came up, it would sort of lower other things to some degree

370
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:10,524
without being too obvious to the user what was happening to let his narration be king.

371
00:28:10,544 --> 00:28:14,547
And then finding those moments to get more stylized.

372
00:28:14,747 --> 00:28:16,667
Yeah, I think this is the ring out section here.

373
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:20,629
Yeah, so we're going to start up kind of right where we ended before coming out of the bunker

374
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:24,490
and coming around the corner and seeing this this tank

375
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:27,912
and getting stylized again.

376
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,401
Yeah, the intensity just keeps building throughout the whole thing.

377
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:15,322
Absolutely.

378
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:19,245
So, you know, one of the things that you were talking about that I think is a

379
00:29:19,285 --> 00:29:24,070
really important consideration is how we make the space feel bigger.

380
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,532
And, you know, you did a lot on the audio side to do that.

381
00:29:26,552 --> 00:29:28,414
And then there was a lot in the game design as well.

382
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:34,280
And one of the things that we did was you start off in this void and

383
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,061
you hear Dan's narration and it's just.

384
00:29:36,482 --> 00:29:39,824
It's giving you this threshold moment, this transition to go,

385
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:42,246
okay, I'm coming from wherever I was.

386
00:29:42,326 --> 00:29:44,227
I'm stepping into this space and I'm,

387
00:29:44,628 --> 00:29:46,449
we're giving you a moment to get acclimated.

388
00:29:46,949 --> 00:29:51,773
And then there's this explosion and you're invited to step into the fire.

389
00:29:51,813 --> 00:29:57,397
And so you take a couple of steps and you go from being in this very large open

390
00:29:57,477 --> 00:30:01,340
void, and then you're into a hot air balloon all of a sudden.

391
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,102
And so that's a confined space, but even though we physically have you in a very

392
00:30:07,162 --> 00:30:10,384
small space, we're moving the camera as you move along. So it feels like you're

393
00:30:10,404 --> 00:30:16,106
traversing this this long area. And one of the things we had to do was, we

394
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:20,147
found as we were testing this, that people in the balloon wanted to just

395
00:30:20,207 --> 00:30:24,449
stare at this map board that we had. So we had to actually get overt with the

396
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,630
statement, hey look around, see what's going on around you, get a sense of where

397
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,231
you are. This all happens before you get into the trench.

398
00:30:30,451 --> 00:30:39,980
Right, and this is kind of setting everything up and you feel like you're just up above the clouds, but you start to realize you're descending into this kind of hellscape.

399
00:30:41,342 --> 00:30:45,686
And so we looked for all of these different moments to move you through the space.

400
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:52,851
Step down the trench and then you'll you'll encounter a block section that you can't physically go any further down

401
00:30:52,891 --> 00:30:59,777
but as you look the site continues down and you can see people going up over the edge and and getting mowed down and

402
00:31:00,297 --> 00:31:02,879
you can turn around and there's a periscope that

403
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:06,681
There's a flare that goes over and it lights up the periscope.

404
00:31:06,721 --> 00:31:09,803
And so that lighting contrast draws your eye to it.

405
00:31:09,843 --> 00:31:13,185
And you're invited to come look at that periscope and see that, yes,

406
00:31:13,225 --> 00:31:16,927
you can see up over the edge of the trench and you can see what's happening.

407
00:31:17,968 --> 00:31:20,069
And then you go through this bunker moment.

408
00:31:20,109 --> 00:31:22,130
So, again, it's a small, confined space.

409
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,292
You feel like you're going to get some relief when you step in there,

410
00:31:25,332 --> 00:31:29,474
but instead you start experiencing this drum fire and you're getting rattled.

411
00:31:30,215 --> 00:31:33,696
It finally opens up and you're allowed down the back hallway.

412
00:31:33,716 --> 00:31:43,000
And down that back hall of the trench, it's where the rain starts and where we start to really lean in on Dan's statement that it can always get worse.

413
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:56,405
And so now the mud is really prevalent and the walls of the trench are falling down and you can see out over the battlefield until the final shell finally falls and you're kind of raising up above it.

414
00:31:57,486 --> 00:32:11,197
We looked for a lot of ways to, you know, 650 square feet to somebody who's been designing a tethered VR experience is an incredibly luxurious amount of space, but it's not adequate for the expanse of World War I.

415
00:32:11,237 --> 00:32:18,543
And so we had to find all of these different areas, both in sound and in the physical production, to find ways to extend the space that you're in.

416
00:32:22,637 --> 00:32:23,577
So the key takeaways?

417
00:32:23,657 --> 00:32:23,878
Yeah.

418
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:24,238
Yeah.

419
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:25,458
You got any key takeaways?

420
00:32:25,598 --> 00:32:26,058
Absolutely.

421
00:32:27,098 --> 00:32:29,019
High quality headphones make a huge difference.

422
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,800
It's easier for us to make content

423
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,340
for really great headphones instead

424
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,221
of spending a lot of time trying to optimize it

425
00:32:37,341 --> 00:32:38,781
for inferior headphones.

426
00:32:39,342 --> 00:32:40,522
So I can't say that enough.

427
00:32:41,202 --> 00:32:42,282
So you get what you pay for.

428
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,983
Don't underestimate the power of sound.

429
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:48,264
And it's never too early to get sound involved.

430
00:32:49,204 --> 00:32:49,805
Absolutely.

431
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:57,671
And, you know, one thing that's the key takeaway for me, too, is like, I like to say in the,

432
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:01,795
you know, we work on sound for movies is there's always like a pencils down time.

433
00:33:01,955 --> 00:33:05,758
OK, you know, we make creative decisions and then there's, you know, time where it's like

434
00:33:05,878 --> 00:33:06,819
pencils down on the test.

435
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:12,384
Well, for this kind of thing, everybody can't have the same deadline.

436
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:18,010
You can't have the visuals, the physical, the audio all have the same deadline because

437
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,913
suddenly it's like, oh, we're tweaking things and then something else happens.

438
00:33:23,062 --> 00:33:25,165
And now our sound doesn't match the visual.

439
00:33:25,265 --> 00:33:29,009
So try to please build in time for your audio team

440
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,492
to kind of be the last one standing and tweak things

441
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:33,455
and make sure that it's right for the user.

442
00:33:34,116 --> 00:33:36,038
And then one also thing that they were able to do

443
00:33:36,118 --> 00:33:37,239
at the Austin build out,

444
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:49,743
is to really sort of set up a way to go into the experience very graciously and then come out where you're really setting up the people to have this experience.

445
00:33:50,043 --> 00:33:53,345
So you walk into this, you know, sort of mock recruiting office and you're hearing a loop.

446
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:59,889
of people working and typing on typewriters, and you're hearing a Victrola, and you're hearing Dan talk a little bit in the corner.

447
00:33:59,949 --> 00:34:04,112
So you're setting that mood to get people into this really intense experience.

448
00:34:04,132 --> 00:34:08,855
And then it's important to have audio as you come out of it, too, to sort of get people back into the real world.

449
00:34:08,895 --> 00:34:09,696
You don't want to just, like...

450
00:34:10,176 --> 00:34:14,979
Throws the headphones on have the six intense experience and then just sort of like kick him out the door

451
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:16,700
Yeah, those thresholds are so important

452
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:24,285
we think a lot about what the onboarding experiences and what the off-boarding experiences and and how you take people and these layers deeper and

453
00:34:24,325 --> 00:34:26,466
deeper into the story and into the experience

454
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:46,995
And then, you know, I think from our point of view, one of the things that we found was a really important takeaway was this idea of working in layers and in stages and starting as flexible as you can and using that to test it, to constantly test, send people through it, be considerate of the actual end user who's going through it and what their experience is.

455
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:53,557
And then throughput considerations. How can you find ways to build in the chance to get more people into it?

456
00:34:54,798 --> 00:35:01,023
So go to warremains.com to check out more. It's currently installed in Austin.

457
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:04,146
And hopefully there will be some more announcements soon.

458
00:35:05,627 --> 00:35:06,248
Ethan shrugs.

459
00:35:07,128 --> 00:35:09,811
So we've got, I think, five minutes left for some questions.

460
00:35:09,851 --> 00:35:13,694
And then we'll be over at the wrap table if you want to follow up with this afterwards.

461
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:20,268
Yeah, I have a question. I think what you've done is absolutely brilliant and utterly terrifying, even in 2D.

462
00:35:21,549 --> 00:35:26,974
I think it's a tremendous anti-war tool, you know, I mean, and I really envision it being used that way.

463
00:35:27,414 --> 00:35:32,439
But I'm wondering, with all the Civil War addicts, people who travel to Civil War battlefields,

464
00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:34,921
if you've thought of doing Gettysburg or anything like that.

465
00:35:35,316 --> 00:35:37,237
Yeah, we thought about a lot of different things.

466
00:35:37,317 --> 00:35:41,000
And so one of the things from Dan's point of view that was important at the

467
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,502
beginning is that it's neither pro-war nor anti-war.

468
00:35:44,562 --> 00:35:46,423
We weren't trying to make a statement.

469
00:35:46,463 --> 00:35:53,508
We were trying to just show people the experience and the craziness of it.

470
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:55,729
And then you're invited to draw your own conclusions.

471
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:57,811
I think a lot of people will draw that conclusion.

472
00:35:58,731 --> 00:36:02,033
But yeah, there are a lot of different places that we could take this.

473
00:36:02,113 --> 00:36:05,835
I think it shows the power of VR as an educational tool.

474
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:07,215
It's a way to step into history.

475
00:36:07,535 --> 00:36:08,756
Right. Thank you.

476
00:36:08,776 --> 00:36:23,022
Hi. So, my question is, did you have situations where people were freaking out because of how intense the experience is?

477
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:23,463
Absolutely.

478
00:36:23,523 --> 00:36:27,785
And how were you trying to mitigate it in the design, or were you even trying to mitigate it?

479
00:36:28,196 --> 00:36:32,557
Well, there's one thing that I've neglected to mention as far as the setup.

480
00:36:32,697 --> 00:36:37,039
The way that we were able to set up the audio for this is it was separate.

481
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:39,999
You know, while it was synced with the visuals, it was a separate feed.

482
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,421
So if somebody, like, crouched down and cowered in the corner because they were so freaked out,

483
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:46,901
the audio would not drop out. The audio would continue.

484
00:36:47,322 --> 00:36:52,307
And there's actually a way for an operator who's watching to tap into that audio feed

485
00:36:52,327 --> 00:36:54,930
with a microphone and make sure somebody's okay.

486
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:58,693
So that was a really important experience to make sure, because everybody's going to

487
00:36:58,713 --> 00:37:00,115
experience this in different ways.

488
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:06,404
Yeah, absolutely. And I mean, it, you can always take the headset off and walk away.

489
00:37:06,484 --> 00:37:15,312
Right. So that's, that's one of the important things about, about making sure that there's a way if somebody needs to go backwards through the physical space to get out, we had paths set up for that.

490
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:25,642
And is that a part of the introduction as well? When you bring people into the experience like this, like you can do this, it's okay. Is that actually a part of the procedure?

491
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:42,184
It was Ethan's nodding yes. I don't remember setting that up. But But yeah, I mean, it we we definitely wanted to be cognizant of people. We didn't want this to be a trigger for PTSD or anything like that. So we definitely wanted people to be able to get out of it.

492
00:37:47,408 --> 00:37:47,668
Hey, there.

493
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:51,880
I got to experience this at Tribeca.

494
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,200
Sweet.

495
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:54,421
And it was extraordinary.

496
00:37:54,881 --> 00:38:00,503
And interestingly, I had an opportunity to recount the experience to someone just a couple days ago.

497
00:38:01,564 --> 00:38:05,465
And I said, wow, it was interesting. I'm in the trenches. I feel the fans blowing.

498
00:38:05,645 --> 00:38:11,327
And I was trying to explain how from the outside, it just doesn't look like, well, it looks like a pile of stuff.

499
00:38:11,387 --> 00:38:13,288
But when you're inside, this is transformed.

500
00:38:13,688 --> 00:38:17,289
Seeing the rosary in front of you and being able to touch it, being trapped in this room.

501
00:38:18,184 --> 00:38:22,767
But at the same time, I find myself pushing the boundaries of the system, looking up over...

502
00:38:22,987 --> 00:38:28,730
There's a certain kind of fascination rather than horror, but I find myself appreciating

503
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:32,572
getting a little closer is better than none at all.

504
00:38:33,092 --> 00:38:38,855
And the person I was talking to, who hasn't seen the experience, he countered that a little

505
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:39,015
bit.

506
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:43,918
He said, you know, I was reading about a Holocaust museum where they used to try to simulate

507
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:46,239
the experience of being put in a train car.

508
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,102
by herding all the guests into the elevator together and making them do that.

509
00:38:51,683 --> 00:38:57,887
And they received pushback from survivors who said, you know, you can't really recreate it.

510
00:38:58,607 --> 00:39:03,550
And they had some some qualms about going halfway without going all the way.

511
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,172
So we can't totally step into history. And I'm just curious, what's the,

512
00:39:08,933 --> 00:39:11,935
is it good to get closer? Or does it help us?

513
00:39:13,777 --> 00:39:18,539
Because we can't get all the way there, it's sort of sanitizing what can't really be understood fully.

514
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:24,141
And I mean it more as a discussion, I hope I'm not sounding critical, because it was an amazing experience,

515
00:39:24,981 --> 00:39:29,123
and yet looking at photographs of World War I is horrifying.

516
00:39:29,863 --> 00:39:32,584
We're in this kind of middle space, and I'm just curious as to your impressions.

517
00:39:32,764 --> 00:39:37,366
Yeah, totally, and I think that's a lot of where Dan was coming from in wanting to set this up,

518
00:39:37,426 --> 00:39:39,127
and his desire was very much...

519
00:39:39,987 --> 00:39:41,348
We can't get you all the way there, right?

520
00:39:41,388 --> 00:39:43,810
We don't have a time machine and we're never going to have one.

521
00:39:44,331 --> 00:39:46,652
But can we get one step closer?

522
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:50,835
Can we get one, one degree closer to giving you the sense of what it might

523
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:52,156
have been like to be there?

524
00:39:52,176 --> 00:39:53,617
And that, and that was the goal of this.

525
00:39:53,697 --> 00:39:58,061
And, and I do think that it was closer than, than some of the other

526
00:39:58,101 --> 00:39:59,402
ways that we can study about it.

527
00:39:59,778 --> 00:40:06,203
Well, in a lot of ways, too, it just like starts the conversation for people to go through this experience and then go from there.

528
00:40:06,343 --> 00:40:16,190
You know, maybe they it inspires them to learn more about World War One and do research or or, you know, just start talking about, you know, why did this war even happen?

529
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,312
So I think it's a good thing, even though we can't get all the way there.

530
00:40:19,552 --> 00:40:21,454
Yeah, I'm going to follow up with my friend with that.

531
00:40:21,954 --> 00:40:25,276
Yeah, yeah. This discussion is exactly the goal.

532
00:40:25,296 --> 00:40:25,416
So.

533
00:40:25,617 --> 00:40:30,011
Well, we'll be in the back there to continue any questions, so please come say hi.

534
00:40:30,492 --> 00:40:30,933
Thanks, everybody.
