1
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:09,855
Um alright hey thanks for coming to our talk. My name is Patrick Hackett. This is Drew

2
00:00:09,855 --> 00:00:16,280
Skillman and uh our talk is called 3 years of Tilt Brush. So uh really quick if you're

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,383
unfamiliar with Tilt Brush it's a virtual reality painting application. It's currently

4
00:00:20,383 --> 00:00:26,687
available for the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift with touch controllers. Um Drew and I

5
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:32,512
created Tilt Brush 3 years ago and for the next about 45 minutes we're gonna talk about

6
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,953
the point up until now.

7
00:00:36,353 --> 00:00:38,815
So when we first started writing this talk,

8
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:41,037
what we did is we put together like a timeline,

9
00:00:41,037 --> 00:00:43,338
like we laid out a timeline, took a bunch of events,

10
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:44,879
put them in chronological order,

11
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,181
and then as we went through them,

12
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:48,722
the story that came out of it,

13
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:54,347
what we realized is that it's just two naive game developers

14
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:56,108
applying game development principles

15
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:59,391
to a whole bunch of situations that were not video games.

16
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:05,683
And sometimes, a lot of times, it was very beneficial for us to think in this way.

17
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:09,565
And then there was other times where it was clear that, like, we didn't have a clue what

18
00:01:09,565 --> 00:01:10,186
we were doing.

19
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:13,428
I just wanted to pause for a moment.

20
00:01:13,428 --> 00:01:17,111
As a show of hands, like, who would identify in this room as a game developer?

21
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:17,331
Awesome.

22
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:17,691
That's a great mix.

23
00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:24,934
Okay, but really the important part,

24
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:28,417
and really our hope of what you take out of this talk,

25
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:31,480
is that game development principles work outside of games.

26
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,901
And again, this talk is gonna cover

27
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:35,463
the past about three years.

28
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:38,566
So starting mostly in August 2014,

29
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:42,709
and then leading up till now, September 2017.

30
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:48,754
And we put in this timeline right at the bottom,

31
00:01:48,754 --> 00:01:51,577
and we'll put dots on it so you can kinda follow along.

32
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:58,815
Awesome.

33
00:01:58,815 --> 00:02:01,037
So before we get to Tilt Brush, I

34
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,038
want to talk about some of the back story

35
00:02:03,038 --> 00:02:05,881
and give you guys some context on where we're coming from.

36
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:09,004
Patrick and I, we have our indie roots.

37
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:11,927
Really come from a game studio called Double Fine.

38
00:02:11,927 --> 00:02:13,148
That's not far from here.

39
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:14,669
A lot of you may have heard of it.

40
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,591
We worked together there for probably eight years.

41
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:23,082
And that's really the story where the story begins. We stumbled into a project

42
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:27,186
For the connect called connect party later became or actually it was happy action theater

43
00:02:27,186 --> 00:02:31,849
Then it later became connect party and that that without we didn't realize it at the time, but that

44
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:35,692
It was a magical moment where we kind of got pulled into this

45
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:43,959
This awesome world of mixing technology and art and game development and trying to push on new technologies

46
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:45,300
in just innovative new ways

47
00:02:46,706 --> 00:02:48,367
We got so excited about it, we decided

48
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:50,808
to formalize these efforts.

49
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:52,709
We invented a name for ourselves.

50
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,891
We called ourselves the Department of Future Tech,

51
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:59,152
which was kind of a joke, but also really serious.

52
00:02:59,152 --> 00:03:01,333
And we tried to get as much cutting-edge hardware

53
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,114
as we could.

54
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:04,815
You can see the Gamasutra article we wrote

55
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:06,596
was really just like begging people

56
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:09,438
to give us their crazy VR gear, their depth cameras,

57
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:11,439
their AR gear, we just wanted it all.

58
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,481
And we also jumped on the DK1 Oculus Kickstarter.

59
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:19,682
We immediately started doing late night game jams at work

60
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:21,663
with the two of us and a bunch of other people

61
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:23,744
from Double Fine.

62
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:25,985
Here's Tim Schafer, the head of that studio,

63
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:28,506
checking out just random prototype

64
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:33,749
we put together called Moon.

65
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:36,830
Here's a Razor Hydra duct taped to a Nerf gun.

66
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:42,384
And this I think is one of the first times

67
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:46,025
that a bunch of us got to try six degree of freedom tracking

68
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,985
for the first time, albeit, you know,

69
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:50,426
very mediocre six degree of freedom tracking.

70
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:51,867
So that's rotational plus positional.

71
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:54,948
And this is Paul Dubois, it's a pretty dark GIF,

72
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:56,808
but that's Paul Dubois, a coworker at Double Fine,

73
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:58,769
and he's on the Tilt Brush team now.

74
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,530
And you can see he's got some hydras duct taped to his head.

75
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,771
Actually, you probably can't see, but take my word for it.

76
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,574
So we're just playing around with all of these new toys

77
00:04:07,574 --> 00:04:10,577
when suddenly there's a huge shift in the industry.

78
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:14,301
Can't really like, it caught us by surprise.

79
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:16,864
Facebook bought Oculus for two billion dollars.

80
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:20,868
This was the first signal that things were happening,

81
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:24,532
like it was not just like late night game jams anymore.

82
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:29,023
And around the same time, we were incredibly lucky

83
00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:31,184
to get to try out Valve's Tag Room.

84
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:37,445
It was absolutely, vastly beyond any of our expectations.

85
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:38,706
Anyone who's had a chance to try it

86
00:04:38,706 --> 00:04:40,286
knows how pivotal that moment was

87
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:43,027
and how transformative it was for the whole industry

88
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:45,508
and we're all here largely because of that Tag Room.

89
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:49,489
And around the same time, a coworker at Double Fine,

90
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,170
Lydia Choi, left to team up with ex-Bungie dev,

91
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,690
Brian Sharp, to build a virtual reality sculpting tool.

92
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,891
So over the course of just a few weeks,

93
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:03,552
it became super clear to us that there was a VR train

94
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:07,513
and it was leaving the station and we needed to be on it.

95
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:10,534
So that's what we did.

96
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:12,235
First lesson in being naive,

97
00:05:12,235 --> 00:05:14,775
the train didn't leave for a little bit longer.

98
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:18,016
But we formed a company, called it Skillman and Hackett.

99
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:22,316
clearly influenced by watching too much Mad Men at the time.

100
00:05:22,316 --> 00:05:27,059
Uh, and we got to work immediately. We weren't, we weren't really doing games. We had

101
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:30,061
this motto of not necessarily games.

102
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:34,664
We were doing a lot of the same stuff though, it was just, you know, a lot less people.

103
00:05:34,664 --> 00:05:36,445
Uh, in fact we were working

104
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:37,265
down the block.

105
00:05:37,265 --> 00:05:39,147
We were a block away working at a Drew's apartment.

106
00:05:41,153 --> 00:05:52,318
And really at the time there was just a ton of room to explore. We picked up some contract work to pay the bills and then really just spent our remaining time mashing different pieces of hardware together.

107
00:05:52,318 --> 00:06:04,723
In general at the time we were using the Kinect, Kinect 2, DK2, Hydra controllers, Leap Motion, cell phones, and then really just using Unity to glue all this stuff together.

108
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,665
So some random examples of like prototypes,

109
00:06:09,665 --> 00:06:11,206
things we were making at the time.

110
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:13,747
We did a series of music visualizers

111
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:15,509
for what would eventually become the Gear VR.

112
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,371
We worked with Leap Motion.

113
00:06:18,371 --> 00:06:21,333
At the time they had an update to their SDK coming out

114
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,074
that had greatly improved hand tracking.

115
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:26,896
And so we built a couple of like showpiece demos for them.

116
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:30,944
This is another one with Leap Motion,

117
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:33,925
but this was like VR in Leap Motion,

118
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:36,546
so it was taking the Leap Motion

119
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:38,047
and mounting it to the front of the DK2.

120
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:40,868
This was a user interface mock-up

121
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,668
for how you could manipulate a map in VR.

122
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,989
Another project we did was a collaboration

123
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:45,710
with Tyler Hurd.

124
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,732
We'd worked with Tyler at Double Fine previously.

125
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:52,513
He was now independent.

126
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,654
He made this short called Butts,

127
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:55,674
and we helped him bring it into VR.

128
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:02,373
And yeah, so that brings us to the point in the story

129
00:07:02,373 --> 00:07:07,977
where we really stumble across virtual reality painting.

130
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:11,299
Here, this is one of the earliest gifs we have

131
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:14,341
of the prototype that would eventually become Tilt Brush.

132
00:07:14,341 --> 00:07:17,223
And arriving at this prototype was really to quote

133
00:07:17,223 --> 00:07:19,924
the great Bob Ross, it was the result

134
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:21,465
of some very happy accidents.

135
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:21,525
So,

136
00:07:27,303 --> 00:07:28,905
I'm gonna describe to you the prototype

137
00:07:28,905 --> 00:07:30,646
that we were trying to make,

138
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:32,988
and then share a couple of the happy accidents

139
00:07:32,988 --> 00:07:34,529
that led us to virtual reality painting.

140
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:38,312
So this prototype, the idea was it would be,

141
00:07:38,312 --> 00:07:41,594
this, I should, a little more background,

142
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,676
this was over the course of like probably one day.

143
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:45,497
So this was not a serious prototype.

144
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:47,379
This was just like a what might happen thing.

145
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:51,062
The idea was, take a chess game.

146
00:07:52,392 --> 00:07:55,574
use an iPad as input, but you're wearing a DK2 headset,

147
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:58,897
and then if you can track the position of the iPad

148
00:07:58,897 --> 00:08:01,638
in 3D space, then you can use it as input,

149
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:04,480
and you can reach out and touch in VR

150
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,121
and move chess pieces around.

151
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:08,643
So the chess pieces could be rendered in virtual reality

152
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:10,104
coming off of the iPad.

153
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:11,245
You could reach out, move stuff around.

154
00:08:11,245 --> 00:08:12,666
At least that was the idea.

155
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:18,437
The first happy accident is that it's way easier

156
00:08:18,437 --> 00:08:22,219
to use a Wacom tablet as input for a Unity experiment

157
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:23,640
than it is an iPad.

158
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,881
It's like, oh, the Wacom just behaves like a mouse,

159
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:26,802
you're done.

160
00:08:26,802 --> 00:08:28,703
So in the spirit of working fast,

161
00:08:28,703 --> 00:08:30,864
we substituted the iPad for a Wacom.

162
00:08:30,864 --> 00:08:34,486
And the second happy accident is that I added

163
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:36,528
debug trail rendering lines to the chess pieces

164
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:38,789
because they were, of course, broken and behaving

165
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,190
in all these weird ways.

166
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:40,950
So now I've got...

167
00:08:41,985 --> 00:08:46,089
So now I've got a stylus and I'm moving chess pieces around,

168
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:48,851
but the chess pieces are leaving these ribbons in the air

169
00:08:48,851 --> 00:08:50,753
in that perfect sweet spot.

170
00:08:50,753 --> 00:08:52,835
Because if you've done, you know, like positional,

171
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:54,517
you know, full six off VR tracking,

172
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:58,621
you know that there's this sweet spot right in front of you

173
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,843
where it just feels absolutely amazing.

174
00:09:00,843 --> 00:09:02,325
And that's exactly where I was drawing.

175
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:06,458
And we had, you know, these are the same ribbons

176
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,099
that we've been using for the last,

177
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:09,881
what are five, six years on every single game we made

178
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,081
and every single prototype we made.

179
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:13,583
It was all using just ribbon rendering and visual effects

180
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,644
and particles and layering all this stuff on top of it.

181
00:09:15,644 --> 00:09:18,746
And then the last point is that

182
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:20,707
you could rotate this chessboard

183
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:21,968
and then move the chess pieces around.

184
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:25,651
And so now you really were drawing in 3D space,

185
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:27,392
but absolutely by accident.

186
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:29,653
Bob Ross would be very, I think, proud, I like to think.

187
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:33,648
And really one of the reasons that I'm such a proponent

188
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:36,989
of rapid prototyping is that they really do let you

189
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:38,129
find these happy accidents.

190
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:40,350
And also, if you do a bunch of prototypes,

191
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,031
it can help develop your intuition,

192
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:45,012
which is a point I wanna stop on for a moment.

193
00:09:45,012 --> 00:09:47,293
Rapid prototyping, it builds your intuition.

194
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:49,553
So we'd been working as fast as we could

195
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:53,395
for the last four months, and we'd done a ton of prototypes,

196
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:55,596
and that gave us the perspective

197
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,757
so that when we saw this one, we knew it was special,

198
00:09:58,757 --> 00:09:59,977
we knew it needed to be pursued.

199
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:02,391
The question is, what next?

200
00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:04,917
So we have a prototype we're really excited about.

201
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:05,739
Where is it gonna go?

202
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:09,914
And there were a few things we had going for us

203
00:10:09,914 --> 00:10:12,855
in terms of providing context for where we could take this.

204
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:15,856
And the first was we had a music visualizer UX experiment

205
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:19,777
that Patrick had made from much earlier in the summer.

206
00:10:19,777 --> 00:10:23,198
And it explored keyboard mouse input with the DK2 headset.

207
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:27,219
Now back in these days, there was no VR controller,

208
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:28,479
like those didn't exist yet.

209
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,039
So keyboard mouse was really the only thing

210
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,240
you had to work with.

211
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,120
And this experience was really compelling.

212
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,170
It was kind of surprising, but it worked remarkably well.

213
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,621
And this UI would become kind of the signature Tilt Brush UI.

214
00:10:42,415 --> 00:10:46,758
And the second thing we had was a really cool additive

215
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:49,339
kind of particle bloom-based style that was built up,

216
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:54,923
I mentioned, from many years of experimentation.

217
00:10:54,923 --> 00:10:57,184
And we'd done enough prototyping in VR with it

218
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:58,625
to know that it would work really well.

219
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,166
It was like a very, very obvious fit.

220
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,087
Just take all the work we'd been doing

221
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:03,748
and slap it on the lines that were coming

222
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:05,549
from this Wacom stylus.

223
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:06,750
And third.

224
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,261
We were still super good friends with the team

225
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:11,623
that had left Double Fine to work on that virtual reality

226
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:13,545
sculpting tool, and now that tool

227
00:11:13,545 --> 00:11:15,227
is maturing into Oculus Medium.

228
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:18,331
And everyone's simmering in the same crate of juices.

229
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:22,796
You can see we're all lined up around Brandon Street,

230
00:11:22,796 --> 00:11:24,277
just a few blocks away from here.

231
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,223
And so we knew that there was a precedent being set

232
00:11:28,223 --> 00:11:31,366
for VR art tools, and that helped us connect the dots

233
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:33,528
along with the ribbon rendering,

234
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:35,709
and along with the other work we'd been doing.

235
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:37,411
So we started to paint a picture

236
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:39,172
of where we might be able to take this.

237
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:41,374
We still had a lot of questions over whether painting

238
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:46,078
would be viable as a form of VR content creation,

239
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:47,680
but we knew we wanted to give it a shot.

240
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:53,736
Right, okay, so Drew throws this prototype over the wall.

241
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:55,738
At the time, it's literally named VRChess.zip.

242
00:11:55,738 --> 00:12:00,662
And I say over the wall because the dirty secret

243
00:12:00,662 --> 00:12:02,503
of Skillman and Hackett was at that time,

244
00:12:02,503 --> 00:12:04,364
we didn't have source control.

245
00:12:04,364 --> 00:12:07,387
And so we're passing this thing back and forth.

246
00:12:07,387 --> 00:12:09,508
In this GIF, the first thing that I added,

247
00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:11,870
you could see the first glimpse of the UI.

248
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,531
It's fixed flat in front of you.

249
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:15,453
There's a color picker, some different brushes.

250
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:20,049
So we continued to work on this for a couple of days,

251
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:23,951
and we got a very well-timed email from Johnny Ross.

252
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,332
If you don't know Johnny, he's the co-founder of Mindshow,

253
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:30,913
which is a really great storytelling VR application.

254
00:12:30,913 --> 00:12:34,514
We'd met Johnny at an early San Francisco VR meetup,

255
00:12:34,514 --> 00:12:35,534
exchange contact info.

256
00:12:35,534 --> 00:12:37,855
At the time, he was running VRLA,

257
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:41,796
and he contacted us because he had an idea for another event.

258
00:12:42,758 --> 00:12:46,861
He was setting up the Proto Awards, which was going to be the first virtual reality

259
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:47,882
award show.

260
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:52,465
He wanted it to coincide with Oculus Connect One, reaching out to people he knew to see

261
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:54,907
if he could dig up some entries.

262
00:12:54,907 --> 00:13:01,532
Luckily for him, we did have something we wanted to submit, and unluckily for us, really

263
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:05,895
what we had was a two-day-old prototype, and the conference was in three weeks.

264
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:11,742
So these kinds of forced deadlines were common to us

265
00:13:11,742 --> 00:13:15,130
from games and to be honest, better or worse,

266
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,192
they're a hell of a motivator.

267
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,911
We really thought that the proper unveiling of Tilt Brush

268
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:23,473
could be at Oculus Connect with the submission

269
00:13:23,473 --> 00:13:26,374
to the award show, maybe we win an award.

270
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:28,355
And so to do that, we wanted to put together

271
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:30,036
all the materials of a proper product.

272
00:13:30,036 --> 00:13:33,578
So we needed, in three weeks, a name, a logo,

273
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:36,840
a website, a trailer, and we actually had to get this thing

274
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,901
to a point that we could submit it to an award show.

275
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:39,381
So we got to work.

276
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:39,541
All right.

277
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,261
Names are hard in general.

278
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:50,183
These are some chat snippets I dug up.

279
00:13:50,183 --> 00:13:52,964
And we had a lot of bad names.

280
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:56,526
Virtuous Sketch, Super SketchBox.

281
00:13:56,526 --> 00:13:59,088
I remembered looking through this that at one point

282
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,449
I woke up and I was positive.

283
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:02,950
I came up with the perfect name.

284
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,430
I was so excited.

285
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,952
Told Drew it should definitely be called SketchUp.

286
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:17,510
Drew reminded me is a very good application that already exists. Uh we liked Tilt Brush

287
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,874
initially when we came up with it but honestly we thought it was a little bit too limiting

288
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:25,896
because we recognized that this application could be much more than painting.

289
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,521
For the logo, we worked with Drew's sister and brother-in-law who run a graphic design

290
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:34,162
studio outside of Seattle.

291
00:14:34,162 --> 00:14:40,084
They had already done the logo for Skillman and Hackett, and we, whatever, we bought them

292
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:43,725
a really nice bottle of whiskey to kind of expedite the order through.

293
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:48,606
When I was looking through old email, I thought it was funny that I was concerned the colors

294
00:14:48,606 --> 00:14:51,247
in that first logo were a little too Google.

295
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:58,102
And also you can see that I was I got pretty excited when I actually saw the one that would become our logo

296
00:14:58,102 --> 00:15:03,846
And really I apologize for the cursing in these slides like we didn't really expect to be presenting this stuff ever

297
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:12,171
We weren't trying to come up with a slogan but uh

298
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:16,795
Drew came up with a slogan one time and so we mocked it up to see you know how it looked

299
00:15:18,572 --> 00:15:20,573
Looks pretty good to us.

300
00:15:20,573 --> 00:15:22,634
Couldn't use it.

301
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:23,814
And then we got a trailer cut.

302
00:15:23,814 --> 00:15:26,356
And so, it's important to remember that this was,

303
00:15:26,356 --> 00:15:27,716
this was made for the DK2.

304
00:15:27,716 --> 00:15:30,218
It was centered around keyboard and mouse.

305
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:33,900
You can see the old UI in this video if you look closely.

306
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,341
It was based on sitting at a desk

307
00:15:36,341 --> 00:15:39,282
and so the UI was this cockpit experience around you.

308
00:15:39,282 --> 00:15:43,104
It's fundamentally different from what you would experience

309
00:15:43,104 --> 00:15:44,765
if you've tried this on the Rift or the Vive.

310
00:15:45,656 --> 00:15:46,917
And that was it.

311
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:49,578
All the pieces done, ready for OC1.

312
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:52,339
So yeah, as Patrick said, we got it together.

313
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:54,861
Name, logo, website, trailer,

314
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:58,402
and an actual playable prototype

315
00:15:58,402 --> 00:16:01,064
as opposed to the two day old experiment that we had.

316
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:04,826
And we jump on a plane and we head to Oculus Connect One.

317
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:08,788
The first thing we do is we set up camp in the demo area

318
00:16:08,788 --> 00:16:10,869
and we skip every talk and we just start putting

319
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,390
every single person we can find

320
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,851
through this hot off the presses demo.

321
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,751
And a bunch of things were really special

322
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:20,472
about that first Oculus Connect.

323
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:21,732
There's an electricity in the air.

324
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,393
Anyone who was there knows that it was just like

325
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:25,194
a very special time.

326
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:27,815
But there are two connections in particular

327
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:30,996
that were critical to the future of Skillman and the Hackett

328
00:16:30,996 --> 00:16:32,056
and also to Tilt Brush,

329
00:16:32,056 --> 00:16:33,757
although we didn't know it at the time.

330
00:16:33,757 --> 00:16:36,278
First was Chet Faliszek, who I'm sure many of you know.

331
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:39,599
We tried to track him down and did,

332
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:42,720
and had to convince him to let us put it on Steam.

333
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:45,154
You know, for those not familiar,

334
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:47,235
Chet has had this huge role getting the whole VR industry

335
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:48,675
off the ground, and he's definitely

336
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,736
a big part of why Tilt Brush exists today.

337
00:16:50,736 --> 00:16:54,838
Second connection we made was Andrei Deronichev.

338
00:16:54,838 --> 00:16:56,738
He's a product manager at Google.

339
00:16:56,738 --> 00:16:59,199
And I think Tilt Brush would have existed without Andrei,

340
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,100
but it never would have become part of Google,

341
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,601
and it never would have received the global recognition that

342
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:05,142
followed after we joined.

343
00:17:06,457 --> 00:17:10,278
Okay, so we weren't actually just there to play test

344
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:11,219
and put it in front of people,

345
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:12,620
we were there for the Proto Awards.

346
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,560
That was the big motivator and the source

347
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,262
of this kind of deadline that we imposed on ourselves.

348
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:21,023
And Tilt Brush had been nominated for Best GUI,

349
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:23,825
which ended up being the first award that was announced,

350
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:24,405
and we won.

351
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:28,486
But we were woefully unprepared.

352
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:32,207
I think I remember being shocked and surprised and going up there with Patrick.

353
00:17:32,207 --> 00:17:36,308
I think that I swore and Patrick thanked his mom or something.

354
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:41,110
But it's worth really calling out that what this ended up being for us was one big play

355
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,250
test.

356
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,391
You know, the importance of play testing is one of the most important and critical lessons

357
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:47,131
we took away from our time at Double Fine.

358
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:54,557
And we were paying super close attention to the expression of like every single person's face after they tried the demo,

359
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:57,219
looking for responses, trying to see what people liked.

360
00:17:57,219 --> 00:18:00,041
And at the Proto Awards, you know, we saw that Tilt Brush resonated with the jury.

361
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,836
On social media, it blew up.

362
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:06,437
You can see that unexpectedly,

363
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:09,019
we'd left this experimental slogan

364
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:10,340
somewhere on our website,

365
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,102
and it was getting scraped by social media.

366
00:18:13,102 --> 00:18:14,422
We felt embarrassed about that.

367
00:18:14,422 --> 00:18:17,404
The launch video hit 100,000 views within a few days,

368
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:21,647
and so the results of this public play test were clear.

369
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,289
The world was interested in virtual reality painting,

370
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:26,330
and we wanted to give them more of it.

371
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,592
It's also worth calling out.

372
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:33,402
that this was the moment when we really stopped being a rapid pro prototyping team and pivoted

373
00:18:33,402 --> 00:18:35,784
to become a true product team. Alright so now we're home from OC1 uh we're going to

374
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,176
Very excited about the positive response,

375
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:45,497
itching to get back to work.

376
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:48,738
At this point, we're in about start of October 2014.

377
00:18:48,738 --> 00:18:51,159
We're moving really fast,

378
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:53,980
adding a bunch of features, features, features.

379
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,561
These GIFs show off a bunch of different brushes

380
00:18:57,561 --> 00:18:59,342
that Drew was experimenting with at the time.

381
00:18:59,982 --> 00:19:05,166
And we started really having long conversations about what a brush could be.

382
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:09,550
We proved that ribbons were satisfying, but what if brushes were particles?

383
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,651
What if they were light?

384
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:14,094
What if they were sound or models or behaviors?

385
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:22,701
We started adding features like the ability to export animated GIFs, to import models,

386
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:23,801
real-time lighting.

387
00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:28,347
And while we're adding all these features,

388
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:33,170
we made it a point to go to like every single local VR meetup

389
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,171
to show off the build, get feedback,

390
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:37,673
meet everybody else in the scene.

391
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:41,735
It really was this large running user test with the public.

392
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:48,830
And around early October, we received a mysterious summons

393
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,491
from Valve.

394
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:53,312
They invited us to Seattle, didn't offer much information.

395
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:55,832
You're not going to say no.

396
00:19:55,832 --> 00:19:58,713
And at this point, this meeting is fairly well documented.

397
00:19:58,713 --> 00:20:01,314
It was the unveiling of the Lighthouse technology

398
00:20:01,314 --> 00:20:03,955
to a small number of developers.

399
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:10,315
a chance to give feedback and kind of an ask to, you know, do you want to participate in

400
00:20:10,315 --> 00:20:15,577
what will be the unveiling of this new headset built by HTC. It was an awesome couple of

401
00:20:15,577 --> 00:20:23,639
days of brainstorming with, you know, like-minded VR folks. But what this resulted in was Skillman

402
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,881
and Hackett obtaining a V-1 Vive headset.

403
00:20:28,305 --> 00:20:32,871
So we had officially achieved the unthinkable goal

404
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:36,315
of getting tag room quality VR in Drew's apartment.

405
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:40,120
So by every metric that mattered to us two,

406
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,824
our company was an outstanding success.

407
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:46,948
It also meant that we had to rethink our entire

408
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:49,069
applications user interface.

409
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:51,190
The six DOF controllers were way better

410
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,411
than we expected them to.

411
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:54,812
And remember, like, Tilt Brush was this

412
00:20:54,812 --> 00:20:56,133
desktop based experience.

413
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:57,293
You build things right here.

414
00:20:57,293 --> 00:21:00,675
And the possibilities that room scale VR gave us

415
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:01,816
were totally uncharted.

416
00:21:01,816 --> 00:21:04,417
And so we had to rethink all of these things.

417
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:07,559
At the time, I sent an email to all the other developers

418
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,580
explaining that we got our kit set up.

419
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,242
And I included this image to show how we felt at the time.

420
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:19,269
It's Neil Armstrong.

421
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:21,711
Unfortunately, now we're getting into November,

422
00:21:21,711 --> 00:21:24,293
we've been focusing full time on Tilt Brush,

423
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:25,914
and we hadn't been doing any contract work.

424
00:21:25,914 --> 00:21:28,516
So that means we didn't have any income.

425
00:21:28,516 --> 00:21:30,277
But what we did have.

426
00:21:31,216 --> 00:21:34,497
was a plan for not only how to build out Tilt Brush

427
00:21:34,497 --> 00:21:36,397
as an application, but how to build it out

428
00:21:36,397 --> 00:21:38,118
as this ecosystem.

429
00:21:38,118 --> 00:21:40,718
Part of this ecosystem relied on lots of users

430
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:42,759
consuming these VR sketches.

431
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,079
And at the time, we were really convinced

432
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:48,100
that if you create something in Tilt Brush,

433
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,660
it should only be viewed in VR.

434
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,401
So we needed a product that could reach a lot of users.

435
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:56,662
There's no better candidate than that,

436
00:21:56,662 --> 00:21:57,902
than Google Cardboard.

437
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,526
So we reached out to Andre.

438
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:02,007
I asked him for an embarrassing picture,

439
00:22:02,007 --> 00:22:03,889
and that's what he gave me.

440
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:07,993
And lucky for us, Google at the time,

441
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,254
they had a big cardboard push

442
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:10,455
that was coming that December.

443
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:13,498
So we worked with them and got Tilt Brush Gallery

444
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,239
ready for their event.

445
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:18,142
Tilt Brush Gallery was a cardboard application

446
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:21,004
where you could view a fixed number of sketches

447
00:22:21,004 --> 00:22:23,006
that Drew and I had done.

448
00:22:23,006 --> 00:22:26,469
They were all preloaded on the application.

449
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:31,063
Doing this was another big force sprint for us.

450
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:33,806
But the work that we were doing was also

451
00:22:33,806 --> 00:22:36,409
going to be immediately beneficial,

452
00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:38,672
because we had to turn our attention to the Vive

453
00:22:38,672 --> 00:22:40,795
shortly after that and start optimizing

454
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:41,876
for 90 frames a second.

455
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:50,819
So, uh, as Patrick said, we got the cardboard version of the app launched, or at least a

456
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:56,146
demo of what it might be. Um, and next on our list was, uh, seeing what would happen when we

457
00:22:56,146 --> 00:22:59,971
took the keyboard mouse version and really pushed on those six DOF, uh, six DOF

458
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:03,737
controllers, those six degree of freedom controllers. Uh, Valve, uh,

459
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:08,679
offered us an opportunity, a super generous offer to go hang out with them in the

460
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:13,580
Bellevue office and embed ourselves with the VR team and see what we can make

461
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,921
happen. It was an incredible, incredible generous offer. We took them up on it and

462
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:23,302
we called it Valve Camp. So our goal was to build a GDC demo experience. The

463
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:29,363
reward, if we were successful, was going to be inclusion in Valve's GDC showcase

464
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:30,983
and the unveiling of the Vive.

465
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:38,157
But we'd only have two weeks to do it, two weeks in valve camp. Uh, the experience

466
00:23:38,157 --> 00:23:43,460
itself needed to fit inside of a three minute window, kind of a three minute time box. And

467
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:49,405
of course our approach was to lean on those, you know, indie lessons from Double Fine and

468
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:53,888
uh, in our independent days. Work hard, focus test constantly and iterate like mad.

469
00:23:56,158 --> 00:24:00,200
But Tilt Brush in its current form was way too complicated.

470
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,942
We put people in front of it and play tested it on Valve

471
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,943
employees and other people.

472
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:08,905
And it was just way too much for people to wrap their

473
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:09,245
heads around.

474
00:24:09,245 --> 00:24:12,226
All these features, they didn't make sense to people.

475
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:15,344
in classic style, we cut, cut, cut.

476
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:17,726
We really just cut everything.

477
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:19,767
Our goal was to distill the core

478
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:22,710
of whatever was making Tilt Brush resonate with people

479
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,691
and cut away all the fat, cut away everything

480
00:24:24,691 --> 00:24:26,993
that was distracting from that experience.

481
00:24:26,993 --> 00:24:28,934
And so goodbye refractive brushes,

482
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,016
goodbye audio brushes, goodbye lighting,

483
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:34,259
goodbye model import, goodbye volumetric brushes,

484
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:35,540
just cut, cut, cut.

485
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,061
But it was worth it.

486
00:24:37,617 --> 00:24:43,121
Those cuts were replaced with a massively simplified paintbrush and palette style interface.

487
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:49,786
We tried probably ten different types of true VR six degree of freedom interfaces,

488
00:24:49,786 --> 00:24:53,408
but no one was able to wrap their heads around them in the three minute window.

489
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:57,471
That three minute window ended up being so crucial to honing the experience.

490
00:24:58,602 --> 00:25:03,245
But the paintbrush palette interface, it was working.

491
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:06,086
It was coming in blazingly hot towards the very, very end

492
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:09,188
of that two week period, but we were feeling good about it.

493
00:25:09,188 --> 00:25:11,089
Our confidence was growing.

494
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:13,430
We asked Chet for one last play test,

495
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,292
and he offhandedly said he had someone in mind.

496
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:19,153
So we go back to our desk, we're ripping apart the build,

497
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:22,335
and we get a tap on the shoulder,

498
00:25:22,335 --> 00:25:25,797
and it's, to our surprise, Valve CEO Gabe Newell

499
00:25:25,797 --> 00:25:26,718
is our last play tester.

500
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,970
And the funny thing about VR play tests

501
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,310
is that the person in the headset

502
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,931
can't see the developers.

503
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:36,551
And that means you don't have to mask your expression.

504
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:39,092
So you've got a picture of Patrick and I

505
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:43,513
watching Gabe in the demo and just making a face like,

506
00:25:43,513 --> 00:25:45,833
ah, while we watch Gabe start to use

507
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:48,094
the new interface and brushes.

508
00:25:48,094 --> 00:25:49,674
And we also didn't have to hide our relief when

509
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:50,794
he said that he liked it.

510
00:25:50,794 --> 00:25:53,155
And when Gabe Newell says that he likes something,

511
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:55,495
you feel pretty good about it.

512
00:25:55,495 --> 00:25:57,736
So at that point, we called it.

513
00:25:57,736 --> 00:25:58,436
GDCdemo was done.

514
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,024
and we headed back to San Francisco. Uh, in our carry ons, we had new upgraded V0 prototype

515
00:26:05,024 --> 00:26:09,647
hardware to play with, did a week of bug fixing and then the vibe was unveiled. Uh, this was

516
00:26:09,647 --> 00:26:13,850
another one of those super special times where my old apartment turned into one of the most

517
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:19,253
like futuristic studios in all of San Francisco, at least for a few weeks. Uh, we were trying

518
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:23,276
all the other devs demos. We're trying alchemy stuff, all kinds of things. You can see Patrick

519
00:26:23,276 --> 00:26:25,037
is fishing in the top right corner there.

520
00:26:26,977 --> 00:26:28,517
And the VIVE reception couldn't have been better.

521
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:30,238
It was enormously positive that year at GDC.

522
00:26:30,238 --> 00:26:31,498
And Tilt Brush made it into the GDC demo loop

523
00:26:31,498 --> 00:26:34,219
and was receiving tons of great press because of it.

524
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:35,800
All right, so now we are post-GDC, March 2015.

525
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,920
What do we do now?

526
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,161
Reception at GDC was really stellar.

527
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:38,741
It was clear to us that

528
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:56,698
continued effort pushing on it, Tilt Brush could be a huge success.

529
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:01,661
It was still the two of us at the time, which is great for keeping overhead low,

530
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:05,443
but also, you know, limits the speed we can move.

531
00:27:05,443 --> 00:27:09,145
And contract work was really just not appealing anymore.

532
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:11,766
We wanted to just keep working on Tilt Brush.

533
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:13,748
What are our options?

534
00:27:14,517 --> 00:27:16,958
Being in San Francisco, going to these meetup scenes,

535
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:20,219
we're often encouraged, strongly encouraged,

536
00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:23,720
to take on VC money, so that was certainly a ready option.

537
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,402
Joining a larger company would provide resources

538
00:27:26,402 --> 00:27:29,803
for the team, or we'd just keep moving forward

539
00:27:29,803 --> 00:27:30,603
as we'd been going.

540
00:27:30,603 --> 00:27:32,704
We'd pick up some contract work, try to pay the rent,

541
00:27:32,704 --> 00:27:35,425
and then just do as much as we can in our free time.

542
00:27:35,425 --> 00:27:35,866
This was hard.

543
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:44,986
We thought leaving Double Fine to start a company was hard.

544
00:27:44,986 --> 00:27:46,186
It was actually very hard.

545
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:48,587
This was a magnitude harder.

546
00:27:48,587 --> 00:27:51,007
So what do we have to consider here?

547
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:54,888
First and foremost, we live in San Francisco.

548
00:27:54,888 --> 00:27:57,489
It's expensive.

549
00:27:57,489 --> 00:27:59,390
Contract work is gonna require time.

550
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,210
All the time we put toward that

551
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,611
pulls away from Tilt Brush.

552
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:05,832
Creative ownership is an absolute must.

553
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:10,287
I mean, honestly, it's how we ended up in this position in the first place.

554
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:11,927
It's why we created Skillman and Hackett.

555
00:28:11,927 --> 00:28:14,588
And this was a unique project.

556
00:28:14,588 --> 00:28:17,089
We'd done, as Drew said, we'd done lots of prototypes.

557
00:28:17,089 --> 00:28:22,151
We knew, we recognized that this one was going to be special, and we thought that it truly

558
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:22,891
deserved care.

559
00:28:24,852 --> 00:28:27,872
So on April 16, we announced that we had joined the Google

560
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,633
VR team.

561
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:31,953
We had a lot of conversations with Andre and his team about

562
00:28:31,953 --> 00:28:33,334
the direction of the industry.

563
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:36,655
It was clear that where we hoped it would go, they hoped

564
00:28:36,655 --> 00:28:37,875
it would go.

565
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:42,376
Andre really recognized that Tilt Brush was unique.

566
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:44,377
This move would allow us to keep the lights on.

567
00:28:44,377 --> 00:28:47,437
And the important part to us was that we were going to hold

568
00:28:47,437 --> 00:28:48,918
creative control over the project.

569
00:28:49,975 --> 00:28:53,440
So really, in Google, we had found a perfect match

570
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,543
for Tilt Brush and a partner that we could

571
00:28:55,543 --> 00:28:56,405
grow this industry with.

572
00:28:56,405 --> 00:28:57,186
So that brings us to April 2015.

573
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:07,549
And we had those kind of like broad meta questions,

574
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:10,030
where are we going, how are we gonna do this,

575
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,050
what are we doing, we had them figured out,

576
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,591
but that meant that it was time to get back to work.

577
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:15,872
We had to ship Tilt Brush.

578
00:29:15,872 --> 00:29:18,453
The tentative date for the Rift and the Vive

579
00:29:18,453 --> 00:29:20,494
were the holidays, so we knew that we had

580
00:29:20,494 --> 00:29:22,775
about eight months to integrate ourselves

581
00:29:22,775 --> 00:29:25,316
and our work into this new company,

582
00:29:25,316 --> 00:29:27,356
turn the demo, the GDC demo,

583
00:29:27,356 --> 00:29:29,697
into an actual product and launch.

584
00:29:31,957 --> 00:29:33,919
Our strategy was going to, again,

585
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,501
be to apply those indie game dev lessons

586
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:41,425
from our previous lives of rapid prototyping, fast iteration,

587
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:43,447
extensive play testing.

588
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:46,369
But we just had to do it at Google.

589
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:48,891
And everybody was on board with that.

590
00:29:48,891 --> 00:29:51,133
People were excited for us to kind of bring

591
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:53,515
the approach that had been so successful

592
00:29:53,515 --> 00:29:54,896
in our independent studio to Google.

593
00:29:54,896 --> 00:29:57,538
But it was less clear how to do it.

594
00:29:57,538 --> 00:30:00,480
And a big question is, would it work at a company like Google?

595
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:06,114
One of the first hurdles was really understanding just how

596
00:30:06,114 --> 00:30:07,434
to apply them at all.

597
00:30:07,434 --> 00:30:10,235
Patrick and I had never worked at a big company before.

598
00:30:10,235 --> 00:30:14,577
And we were, let's say, a bit naive, or a lot naive.

599
00:30:14,577 --> 00:30:18,858
And one of my favorite examples of this is our

600
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:22,799
approach to getting help modeling our environments.

601
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,940
This was right at the beginning.

602
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,121
We just started at Google, and we just needed to make some

603
00:30:26,121 --> 00:30:26,641
more environments.

604
00:30:26,641 --> 00:30:27,661
It seemed pretty simple.

605
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:32,596
So our idea was let's just hire our good friend and collaborator, Tyler Hurd.

606
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:34,017
We'd done VRButts with him.

607
00:30:34,017 --> 00:30:35,839
We'd been working with him for a while.

608
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:39,061
And this is how the collaboration worked when it was independent and

609
00:30:39,061 --> 00:30:40,703
we were working with him on Butts.

610
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:42,464
Said, hey Tyler, you wanna work together?

611
00:30:42,464 --> 00:30:45,086
He said, sure, send the contract over.

612
00:30:45,086 --> 00:30:46,407
And this is what the contract was.

613
00:30:46,407 --> 00:30:48,970
It was made in Microsoft Paint.

614
00:30:54,665 --> 00:30:59,229
And equally good is the file name.

615
00:30:59,229 --> 00:31:00,390
Um.

616
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:07,116
So, so this was just, this is a good example of kind of where we were coming from.

617
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:14,823
And Google legal team, the Google legal team is really, really, really, really great.

618
00:31:14,823 --> 00:31:16,044
They're really great.

619
00:31:16,044 --> 00:31:20,909
They soften the blow, and this is not a joke, they soften the blow with homemade cookies.

620
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,660
You guys cannot do this anymore.

621
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,120
You are at Google.

622
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,441
You can't make contracts and MS Pay anymore.

623
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:33,483
So that was one hurdle.

624
00:31:33,483 --> 00:31:36,605
Then we also needed to accomplish a bunch of firsts

625
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:37,985
for the first time.

626
00:31:37,985 --> 00:31:39,726
And we had to do it before the holidays.

627
00:31:39,726 --> 00:31:43,647
We needed to launch on an engine that was new to Google.

628
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:46,308
We needed to launch on hardware that was new to Google.

629
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:49,610
And we needed to launch on a distribution platform, Steam,

630
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,370
that was also totally new to Google.

631
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:56,230
And Patrick and I really didn't understand the magnitude

632
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,250
of these challenges.

633
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,471
Again, we were naive.

634
00:31:58,471 --> 00:32:01,352
We're coming at it from mile a minute indie development.

635
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,172
Who cares?

636
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:03,273
I'm just paying contracts.

637
00:32:03,273 --> 00:32:04,933
Get it done.

638
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:08,835
And luckily, Google stepped up immediately and they helped us.

639
00:32:08,835 --> 00:32:11,356
It turned into a big team effort with a lot of folks

640
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:14,897
behind the scene pushing to make this happen.

641
00:32:14,897 --> 00:32:18,859
And so we were able to get these firsts accomplished at Google,

642
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:21,060
but it was way harder than we expected.

643
00:32:21,993 --> 00:32:24,034
Another challenge was growing the team.

644
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:27,235
Around this time, VR was exploding.

645
00:32:27,235 --> 00:32:30,957
People from games were getting absorbed into VR left and

646
00:32:30,957 --> 00:32:33,858
right, and it was super hard to actually just go from the

647
00:32:33,858 --> 00:32:36,039
two of us to a team like we'd imagined.

648
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,640
It ended up taking a lot longer than we expected.

649
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,161
One of the great things about life at

650
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:43,302
Google is Google scale.

651
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:46,363
Google operates at this massive scale, and it afforded

652
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:49,525
us some really special and unexpected opportunities.

653
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:54,033
Uh, one of them is that we got to collaborate on this mixed reality launch

654
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:58,616
trailer with a visual effects team and a creative agency that did work on the

655
00:32:58,616 --> 00:33:02,259
Martian, uh, which was, you know, coming from, I have a visual effects

656
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:04,440
background, so I was super excited about this opportunity.

657
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,383
Um, we actually gave them like, we approached it in a very indie fashion.

658
00:33:08,383 --> 00:33:09,764
We gave them our source code.

659
00:33:09,764 --> 00:33:10,905
So they had our unity project.

660
00:33:11,186 --> 00:33:13,190
And they were, you can see this is behind the scenes footage

661
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,793
from the shoot, they're doing camera matching

662
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:16,236
and then re-rendering from Unity

663
00:33:16,236 --> 00:33:18,480
and compositing things back together.

664
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,143
It had that like indie vibe approach,

665
00:33:20,143 --> 00:33:22,448
but it was way bigger and more coordinated effort.

666
00:33:24,238 --> 00:33:26,540
Another great example is that when we joined Google,

667
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,622
they sat us next to the Google Data Arts team, which

668
00:33:29,622 --> 00:33:30,963
you may be familiar with some of their work.

669
00:33:30,963 --> 00:33:32,484
And if not, you should check it out.

670
00:33:32,484 --> 00:33:33,945
They do incredible, incredible things.

671
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,067
And they sat us down right next to these guys.

672
00:33:36,067 --> 00:33:38,308
And so of course, through hallway conversations,

673
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:41,651
we just ended up doing a collaboration that was

674
00:33:41,651 --> 00:33:42,691
called Virtual Art Sessions.

675
00:33:42,691 --> 00:33:46,474
And they had two connects on the opposite side of the room.

676
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:49,016
They would capture artists volumetrically,

677
00:33:49,016 --> 00:33:49,916
capture all their paint.

678
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:52,338
And they built the whole thing into a WebGL experience

679
00:33:52,338 --> 00:33:53,479
that you can go check out.

680
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:59,082
Again, massively bigger in scope than anything we would have bitten off ourselves.

681
00:33:59,082 --> 00:34:04,664
We did a collaboration with Glen Keane, legendary Disney animator, and worked with him on a

682
00:34:04,664 --> 00:34:06,345
future of storytelling presentation.

683
00:34:09,118 --> 00:34:12,620
And in addition to kind of resulting in a video that went viral and exposed a bunch

684
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:16,142
of people to Tilt Brush for the first time, I got to try my hand as a roadie.

685
00:34:16,142 --> 00:34:19,664
You can't see me, but I'm in the darkness back there running back and forth.

686
00:34:19,664 --> 00:34:24,106
Right before this video gets taken, someone, another stagehand steps on a power supply

687
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:24,687
and shuts down the Vive.

688
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:31,270
And I was like trying not to throw up as I clicked buttons and rebooted machines and

689
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,030
was waiting to see.

690
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,231
Because this was back when...

691
00:34:33,457 --> 00:34:37,419
everything was just so hot off the presses. You never knew what was going to happen. It was

692
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:45,364
absolutely terrifying. We even did a Mountain Dew NBA collaboration. Definitely,

693
00:34:45,364 --> 00:34:52,668
definitely not indie. So yeah, a bunch of examples of Google scale there.

694
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,710
And really the way, you know, looking back,

695
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,752
the way I see it is we went through trial by fire.

696
00:34:57,752 --> 00:35:00,553
We had nine months of really tremendously

697
00:35:00,553 --> 00:35:03,174
hard growing pains, but we came out of it

698
00:35:03,174 --> 00:35:05,856
on the other side with a 1.0 Tilt Brush release.

699
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,737
But way more important than that is at this point

700
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:10,058
we had a team, it wasn't just the two of us.

701
00:35:10,058 --> 00:35:11,979
We were shipping Tilt Brush with the team

702
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:15,061
and it was, you know, it was better than we could

703
00:35:15,061 --> 00:35:17,442
have imagined thanks to all the new faces

704
00:35:17,442 --> 00:35:18,743
that we had working with us now.

705
00:35:21,998 --> 00:35:23,740
All right, so now we're into 2016.

706
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,062
We're a little bit more comfortable,

707
00:35:26,062 --> 00:35:28,604
really trying to retain this independent spirit.

708
00:35:28,604 --> 00:35:32,027
In particular, we maintained a really fast pace,

709
00:35:32,027 --> 00:35:36,490
instrumenting six-week sprints, led to a lot of launches,

710
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:39,032
and us bringing back all of those features we had cut.

711
00:35:39,653 --> 00:35:42,397
brought back animated gif export, export to FBX,

712
00:35:42,397 --> 00:35:45,381
added a teleport tool, which was a huge oversight

713
00:35:45,381 --> 00:35:47,263
to begin with.

714
00:35:47,263 --> 00:35:49,246
Later in the year, we added the ability to scale

715
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:52,250
and rotate the scene, started building out more pro tools.

716
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:59,650
And a pain that we kind of just had to become accustomed to was we are now in full production on live product

717
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,552
And this means that it is of the highest priority

718
00:36:02,552 --> 00:36:06,974
It still is the highest priority that we do not break existing art

719
00:36:06,974 --> 00:36:11,557
So any new change that we put in can't affect the art that was created in a previous build

720
00:36:11,557 --> 00:36:18,881
Before you know we had launched we could safely prototype scrap throw things away whole concepts doesn't matter

721
00:36:18,881 --> 00:36:20,702
But now we had to live with these choices

722
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,481
In addition, we were rewriting huge sections of the code

723
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:26,222
because you can imagine,

724
00:36:26,222 --> 00:36:28,944
this was all like prototype quality code

725
00:36:28,944 --> 00:36:30,785
and you can't build off of that.

726
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:35,482
and we were hurtling walls.

727
00:36:35,482 --> 00:36:39,103
Drew and I had this motto during the Skillman Hackathon

728
00:36:39,103 --> 00:36:41,383
that you run as fast as you possibly can,

729
00:36:41,383 --> 00:36:44,364
and if you hit a wall, you just turn and keep running.

730
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:46,305
Unfortunately, we're now in a place

731
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:47,925
where we had to solve those hard problems.

732
00:36:47,925 --> 00:36:50,726
So you can't just turn, you have to hurtle these walls.

733
00:36:50,726 --> 00:36:54,227
Or as we like to joke, sometimes you're running so fast,

734
00:36:54,227 --> 00:36:55,487
you just blow right through the wall.

735
00:36:57,292 --> 00:37:01,593
We continued to prototype as much as possible, though.

736
00:37:01,593 --> 00:37:04,794
Most of these prototypes will never see the light of day.

737
00:37:04,794 --> 00:37:08,035
This was a prototype I did for a Connect the Dots game

738
00:37:08,035 --> 00:37:09,316
that would be inside Tilt Brush.

739
00:37:09,316 --> 00:37:11,817
It was pretty much as fun as Connect the Dots is.

740
00:37:11,817 --> 00:37:15,638
This was a portal brush that using the camera

741
00:37:15,638 --> 00:37:18,579
on the front of the Vive allowed users

742
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:20,240
to peek out into the real world.

743
00:37:21,312 --> 00:37:24,875
This was an early version of constraining brush strokes to planes or other shapes. And this

744
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:28,778
would actually eventually ship as our guides feature. Early version of the audio reactive

745
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:33,522
mode. And another early version of a feature that just shipped a quick tool interface.

746
00:37:47,738 --> 00:37:52,902
So in addition to prototyping like mad, we were still play testing like mad.

747
00:37:52,902 --> 00:37:56,465
Again, the indie spirit at Google wanted to keep it alive.

748
00:37:56,465 --> 00:37:58,806
And it had gotten us really far.

749
00:37:58,806 --> 00:38:05,891
We talked about how it was huge, Oculus Connect 1, really defined Tilt Brush those two weeks

750
00:38:05,891 --> 00:38:07,192
at Valve Camp.

751
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,820
It was through those play tests that Tilt Brush really

752
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,661
took its final shape.

753
00:38:11,661 --> 00:38:13,722
And at Google, we wanted to go even bigger.

754
00:38:13,722 --> 00:38:15,704
We wanted to play test on casual users.

755
00:38:15,704 --> 00:38:18,666
We wanted to play test on our peers, our co-workers,

756
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:21,027
other Googlers.

757
00:38:21,027 --> 00:38:23,089
But we also wanted to try something new.

758
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:26,971
We wanted to see if we could see what would happen when we

759
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,293
play tested and worked with some of the world's most

760
00:38:29,293 --> 00:38:32,395
accomplished and impressive artists.

761
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:35,938
And we did it through a program called Artists in Residence.

762
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:40,515
And so through this program, we engaged with about 60 artists

763
00:38:40,515 --> 00:38:45,198
and worked with people, well, people like Glenn King,

764
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,038
who I talked about earlier.

765
00:38:46,038 --> 00:38:50,441
On the right here, this is Victory Dance by him.

766
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:53,262
And this was before we had World Transform.

767
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:56,224
So every one of these strokes, Glenn

768
00:38:56,224 --> 00:38:58,866
had to actually walk to and place in room scale, which

769
00:38:58,866 --> 00:39:00,567
is a crazy time to think about.

770
00:39:00,567 --> 00:39:03,368
Like he probably walked 10 miles to make this sketch

771
00:39:03,368 --> 00:39:04,269
over the course of a week.

772
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:06,811
He was crawling, climbing on things.

773
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:11,354
It was just a demonstration of this grit

774
00:39:11,354 --> 00:39:13,415
that the world's best artists have.

775
00:39:13,415 --> 00:39:15,256
It's unbelievable.

776
00:39:15,256 --> 00:39:16,597
And he would give us feedback

777
00:39:16,597 --> 00:39:18,278
in the form of beautiful drawings

778
00:39:18,278 --> 00:39:20,880
and sketches of strokes he wanted

779
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,763
or brushes that he wanted to be able to use.

780
00:39:25,893 --> 00:39:27,854
Another great collaborator was Peter Chan.

781
00:39:27,854 --> 00:39:29,375
He's another legend.

782
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:31,896
He did a bunch of work at LucasArts and Double Fun Games.

783
00:39:31,896 --> 00:39:33,877
He's worked on a bunch of Hollywood movies.

784
00:39:33,877 --> 00:39:35,738
And this piece is called The Rescue,

785
00:39:35,738 --> 00:39:37,359
and it's the opposite.

786
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,200
We worked with him while we were developing

787
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,341
the World Transform feature.

788
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:44,224
And so he used this world transform feature

789
00:39:44,224 --> 00:39:47,307
to build this huge kind of like epic snowscape

790
00:39:47,307 --> 00:39:50,410
that completely brought Tilt Brush to its knees.

791
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,352
It was so massive.

792
00:39:52,352 --> 00:39:53,774
It runs at 90 frames a second,

793
00:39:53,774 --> 00:39:55,395
but it takes a little while to load.

794
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:57,958
So we need to optimize our loading before we can share that.

795
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:59,639
And here's some feedback we got from Peter.

796
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:01,241
Again, it's just beautiful getting feedback from artists.

797
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:13,174
Chris Pernowski from Tipmouse did this sprawling comic that you explored and like walked around

798
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:16,436
room scale reading these panels.

799
00:40:16,436 --> 00:40:23,861
He also took incredible notes and we captured, we used Chris for some promotional footage

800
00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:27,744
and so he actually wrote this in his notebook which I think is hilarious.

801
00:40:27,744 --> 00:40:29,785
Write fake notes in notebook for shoot.

802
00:40:29,785 --> 00:40:31,186
I am writing these notes now.

803
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:38,669
And again, another collaboration with Tyler Hurd.

804
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:41,551
I'll let the GIF do the talking on this one,

805
00:40:41,551 --> 00:40:45,093
because it's really weird.

806
00:40:45,093 --> 00:40:48,375
It's weird and great.

807
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:50,816
Siguyn Chung is a New York City based artist,

808
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:53,037
and she does beautiful work,

809
00:40:53,037 --> 00:40:54,718
but she also really pushed us on our export.

810
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,779
She was asking for splines that she could bring

811
00:40:56,779 --> 00:40:58,060
into the rest of her workflows.

812
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:01,342
Just a cool example of some of the unusual things

813
00:41:01,342 --> 00:41:03,623
that artists ask for that maybe a regular play tester

814
00:41:03,623 --> 00:41:04,103
wouldn't.

815
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:08,979
So all this art and tons more is on the tiltbrush.com slash air website.

816
00:41:08,979 --> 00:41:12,421
I think it's an incredible reflection of, of Google scale.

817
00:41:12,421 --> 00:41:16,424
And it's also something that never would have happened as the two of us and a

818
00:41:16,424 --> 00:41:18,405
little tiny, my old apartment.

819
00:41:18,405 --> 00:41:18,605
Um,

820
00:41:19,948 --> 00:41:23,210
I want to take a moment and call out the incredible team

821
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:23,951
behind this program.

822
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:26,653
Again, Patrick and I could not have done this.

823
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:30,295
This is like tons of people making things happen at

824
00:41:30,295 --> 00:41:34,118
Google, and those people who built this program and the

825
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:37,901
artists who participated in it had this pivotal and critical

826
00:41:37,901 --> 00:41:40,202
role in defining the path that Tilt Brush would take.

827
00:41:43,616 --> 00:41:46,418
So that's like an example of Google scale, right?

828
00:41:46,418 --> 00:41:49,561
On the opposite side, when we're working at Double Fine

829
00:41:49,561 --> 00:41:51,983
and more generally in the video game,

830
00:41:51,983 --> 00:41:55,745
or independent game scene, we learned how important it is

831
00:41:55,745 --> 00:41:59,208
to participate in and really take care of your community.

832
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:01,790
We spent a lot of time doing this at Skillman and Hackett,

833
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,892
attending all the local meetups and meeting folks,

834
00:42:03,892 --> 00:42:07,495
and we really tried to carry these ideas into Google.

835
00:42:07,495 --> 00:42:09,716
In particular, I spend a lot of time on Twitter.

836
00:42:09,716 --> 00:42:12,679
This is a capture of TweetDeck.

837
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:16,841
where I search for Tilt Brush as one word and two words

838
00:42:16,841 --> 00:42:19,543
because people aren't consistent with it.

839
00:42:19,543 --> 00:42:21,844
We also maintain Tilt Brush at Google.com,

840
00:42:21,844 --> 00:42:24,365
which is very strange for Google.

841
00:42:24,365 --> 00:42:28,068
They do not normally have public facing emails

842
00:42:28,068 --> 00:42:29,669
for their internal products,

843
00:42:29,669 --> 00:42:31,269
but it's been an enormous help for us

844
00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:33,691
to communicate with the community.

845
00:42:34,896 --> 00:42:41,120
Glowing example of this is having a Twitter conversation with a gentleman named Tim Adley.

846
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,663
He had reverse engineered our save file format a long time ago, was creating 3D models with

847
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:50,146
it, followed up over email, and well, eventually we hired him.

848
00:42:52,227 --> 00:42:57,211
I also maintain a ridiculous spreadsheet of feature requests.

849
00:42:57,211 --> 00:43:02,335
It's in no way scientific, but it's a great pulse on feature requests that come in through

850
00:43:02,335 --> 00:43:04,176
that email or through Twitter.

851
00:43:04,176 --> 00:43:06,918
And this really does help shape our future roadmaps.

852
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:11,962
And really the only reason I'm showing all this stuff is to emphasize that the community

853
00:43:11,962 --> 00:43:13,683
should help shape your product.

854
00:43:16,565 --> 00:43:21,070
We've said this a few times before, but at Skillman and Hackett, we gained so much from

855
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:26,077
attending all those local VR meetups, so we wanted to pay this forward a little bit.

856
00:43:26,077 --> 00:43:31,023
So we hold developer meetups at our office, where we let people demo their experiences

857
00:43:31,023 --> 00:43:33,166
that they're building, or just eat pizza.

858
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,740
This was kind of a scary moment.

859
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,262
This was the moment that our community kind of started to take on a life of its own.

860
00:43:42,262 --> 00:43:46,844
Marvel worked with three artists, Danny Bittman, Steve Teeple, and Stuart Campbell

861
00:43:46,844 --> 00:43:51,386
to create promotional art for their upcoming Doctor Strange movie.

862
00:43:51,386 --> 00:43:54,527
Now, like the art they did was amazing, but the crazy part

863
00:43:54,527 --> 00:43:57,269
about this is we didn't have any idea that they were doing it.

864
00:43:57,269 --> 00:44:00,150
And we didn't know about it until the sketch was done and they sent it to us.

865
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,450
It's like, hey, check this out.

866
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:07,909
And it was this sobering moment where we recognized that people were making a living off of this

867
00:44:07,909 --> 00:44:09,710
tool that we're building and maintaining.

868
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:15,812
And I really like to think that the lessons that we learned about community management

869
00:44:15,812 --> 00:44:22,394
from the independent game scene has had just a huge influence on the product.

870
00:44:22,394 --> 00:44:28,176
You know, it's really the dialogue with your community that allows us as product creators

871
00:44:28,176 --> 00:44:30,077
to empower the real storytellers.

872
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:38,051
So that brings us to January 2017.

873
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:39,091
Team has jelled.

874
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:41,672
We're pitting our stride.

875
00:44:41,672 --> 00:44:44,314
We've kind of figured out how we can operate at Google.

876
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:47,075
It was a challenge, but we figured it out.

877
00:44:47,075 --> 00:44:51,316
And that means that now we can move way faster than we were.

878
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:53,758
And we're doing all kinds of cool things.

879
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:55,959
We're pushing in new directions.

880
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:58,120
We launched something called the Tilt Brush Toolkit,

881
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,721
which lets anyone bring tilt brush art into Unity

882
00:44:59,721 --> 00:45:01,842
and preserves shaders and materials.

883
00:45:01,842 --> 00:45:05,444
The purpose of this is to allow people to breathe life

884
00:45:05,444 --> 00:45:07,585
into their tilt brush art.

885
00:45:07,585 --> 00:45:11,047
So some examples here on the left is a music video

886
00:45:11,047 --> 00:45:13,888
that Titmouse Animation did.

887
00:45:13,888 --> 00:45:16,450
And on the right is a game called Palo's Wing

888
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:17,630
that was published on Steam.

889
00:45:19,972 --> 00:45:23,494
We're also launching fast, and the launches are bigger now.

890
00:45:23,494 --> 00:45:24,494
They're a lot bigger.

891
00:45:24,494 --> 00:45:25,875
We've launched on Oculus.

892
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:28,217
We're adding new lighting features, custom environments,

893
00:45:28,217 --> 00:45:31,439
detachable panels, a bunch of polish.

894
00:45:31,439 --> 00:45:36,201
And we finally got to something that was on a roadmap

895
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:38,163
30 slides ago, sharing.

896
00:45:38,163 --> 00:45:40,204
We got deep sharing integration.

897
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,925
And what that meant is that anyone

898
00:45:41,925 --> 00:45:44,486
can share sketches and view sketches

899
00:45:44,486 --> 00:45:46,568
from VR.google.com slash sketches.

900
00:45:48,878 --> 00:45:51,404
And we even have support for other Google products inside of

901
00:45:51,404 --> 00:45:51,745
Tilt Brush.

902
00:45:51,745 --> 00:45:54,993
This is the Blocks library, which is support for Google

903
00:45:54,993 --> 00:45:56,797
Blocks that happened in our most recent launch.

904
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,020
So that's it.

905
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,421
So two and a half years in,

906
00:46:02,421 --> 00:46:06,385
and we've been running this grand experiment with Google,

907
00:46:06,385 --> 00:46:09,007
and we've proven that it can be successful.

908
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:11,509
We've capitalized on the benefits of Google Scale,

909
00:46:11,509 --> 00:46:14,291
tried to really maintain these core principles

910
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:15,652
we pulled from the game industry

911
00:46:15,652 --> 00:46:17,954
and from Skillman and Hackett.

912
00:46:17,954 --> 00:46:22,178
And we hope that these are lessons to show

913
00:46:22,178 --> 00:46:24,640
that these game development principles

914
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,381
can be used outside of games

915
00:46:26,381 --> 00:46:27,922
in very different atmospheres.

916
00:46:28,834 --> 00:46:35,779
And it's also a validation of prototyping as an exercise for production and recognizing

917
00:46:35,779 --> 00:46:38,901
when you should really drop everything and start running at an idea.

918
00:46:38,901 --> 00:46:47,026
So we want to say thanks, but really quick before we jump to questions, a couple things.

919
00:46:47,026 --> 00:46:51,829
Okay, it's common in games to have a credit section and a special thanks section.

920
00:46:52,965 --> 00:46:57,751
So we wanted to let you know that there's a hidden credits

921
00:46:57,751 --> 00:47:00,474
sketch in Tilt Brush that as far as we know

922
00:47:00,474 --> 00:47:02,836
has never been found.

923
00:47:02,836 --> 00:47:05,319
And we're not gonna tell you how to find it,

924
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:07,802
but I just wanted to let you know that it exists.

925
00:47:11,407 --> 00:47:14,107
And likewise, we want to, I mean, there's so many people

926
00:47:14,107 --> 00:47:17,288
that were pivotal in Skelman & Hackett

927
00:47:17,288 --> 00:47:18,409
until like the last three years

928
00:47:18,409 --> 00:47:19,789
have been this wild, wild ride,

929
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:22,090
this incredible rollercoaster.

930
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,290
But I do want to thank a few people

931
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:25,211
who were pivotal in the creation

932
00:47:25,211 --> 00:47:27,011
of our indie studio, Skelman & Hackett.

933
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:29,152
That's Tim Schafer, Aaron Davies,

934
00:47:29,152 --> 00:47:32,052
and as mentioned earlier, our friends on the Medium team.

935
00:47:32,052 --> 00:47:35,033
And a huge shout out to Chet Falicek and Andrei Deronichev.

936
00:47:35,545 --> 00:47:41,086
who saw something special in Tilt Brush and actually did things that brought it to life

937
00:47:41,086 --> 00:47:46,507
and I honestly don't think we'd be standing here without them. So, tons more people to

938
00:47:46,507 --> 00:47:49,048
thank, tons more people. I see you out there. Thank you.

939
00:47:49,048 --> 00:47:49,348
Thank you.

940
00:47:49,348 --> 00:47:49,748
Yeah, so questions?

941
00:48:07,524 --> 00:48:10,888
I think we've got a few minutes.

942
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,991
So I'm a designer, not an engineer.

943
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:14,893
So I don't necessarily get into arguments

944
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:18,237
about tabs versus spaces or Unity versus Unreal.

945
00:48:18,237 --> 00:48:21,180
But you did mention that Tilt Brush

946
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,321
was being built within Unity.

947
00:48:22,321 --> 00:48:25,245
Is that still the basis of what the product is constructed in?

948
00:48:25,245 --> 00:48:28,388
Or have you gone lower level?

949
00:48:28,647 --> 00:48:31,388
Yeah, no, that's a fantastic question.

950
00:48:31,388 --> 00:48:33,108
We are still built in Unity.

951
00:48:33,108 --> 00:48:38,450
We've been optimizing aggressively in order to like,

952
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,751
in order to accommodate the work that people make,

953
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,772
which has been explosively growing in scale.

954
00:48:43,772 --> 00:48:46,553
But we haven't hit the limit of what we're able to do

955
00:48:46,553 --> 00:48:47,654
inside of Unity yet.

956
00:48:47,654 --> 00:48:49,254
There's still optimizations to be made.

957
00:48:49,254 --> 00:48:51,555
There's still a lot of room for us to grow there.

958
00:48:51,555 --> 00:48:53,716
So currently we're still in Unity, yeah.

959
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:59,061
So I actually tried Tilt Brush, I love it.

960
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:03,302
It's an awesome program, it's very immersive,

961
00:49:03,302 --> 00:49:06,183
and I spent hours and hours with it.

962
00:49:06,183 --> 00:49:09,064
But my question is more on,

963
00:49:09,064 --> 00:49:10,545
because I'm also looking at Quill,

964
00:49:10,545 --> 00:49:13,566
so I'm wondering what your guys' thoughts are on Quill,

965
00:49:13,566 --> 00:49:15,867
and maybe where you see,

966
00:49:15,867 --> 00:49:19,728
if you're going in the same direction,

967
00:49:19,728 --> 00:49:21,769
or if you're not going in the same direction,

968
00:49:21,769 --> 00:49:23,570
where are you taking Tilt Brush?

969
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,742
Yeah, that's a fantastic question.

970
00:49:25,742 --> 00:49:27,464
I love Quill.

971
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,847
Incidentally, I had that picture of like,

972
00:49:29,847 --> 00:49:32,570
Double Fine, Skelman & Hackett, Medium,

973
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:35,033
also that's Quill, and it came later in the story,

974
00:49:35,033 --> 00:49:36,234
but that's also where Quill is,

975
00:49:36,234 --> 00:49:37,977
so we had lots of conversations with Inigo

976
00:49:37,977 --> 00:49:39,578
and those guys, they're incredible.

977
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:43,440
I think that for us, Tilt Brush,

978
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,222
we've just taken a little bit of a more broad view

979
00:49:46,222 --> 00:49:48,284
on what a brush can be.

980
00:49:48,284 --> 00:49:50,806
I'm not gonna speak for Inigo or the Quill team,

981
00:49:50,806 --> 00:49:53,168
but from the outside, it looks like they're very

982
00:49:53,168 --> 00:49:57,992
laser focused on unlit strokes and animation.

983
00:49:57,992 --> 00:50:01,015
I've seen a lot of animation, but they're really,

984
00:50:01,015 --> 00:50:05,178
it has a very beautiful, beautiful, specific look.

985
00:50:05,178 --> 00:50:08,921
In Tilt Brush, we've taken much, I think, more,

986
00:50:10,515 --> 00:50:12,276
open-ended approach to brushes.

987
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:14,097
Patrick mentioned that earlier, we were like,

988
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:15,778
what can a brush be?

989
00:50:15,778 --> 00:50:17,839
Like once you're in VR and you're laying strokes down,

990
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,440
well those strokes can turn into anything.

991
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,861
We've really tried to push that in terms of particles,

992
00:50:21,861 --> 00:50:24,523
unlit brushes, lit brushes, animated brushes,

993
00:50:24,523 --> 00:50:28,605
objects, lighting, set design.

994
00:50:28,605 --> 00:50:32,607
So that's really like kind of where we've been focused

995
00:50:32,607 --> 00:50:33,328
in our efforts.

996
00:50:33,328 --> 00:50:36,129
But I think they're, you know, Quill's a beautiful tool.

997
00:50:36,129 --> 00:50:36,730
So I like it too.

998
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:36,890
Thanks.

999
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:40,172
I wanted to ask about the impact.

1000
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:45,413
of your product, not that you've generated necessarily,

1001
00:50:45,413 --> 00:50:49,615
but that the artists that use your product generate.

1002
00:50:49,615 --> 00:50:52,217
So the first part of it would be,

1003
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:56,979
what's the biggest impact that you've seen

1004
00:50:56,979 --> 00:51:00,021
from artists that use your product so far

1005
00:51:00,021 --> 00:51:04,324
and in the future, you know, like a pencil, for instance,

1006
00:51:04,324 --> 00:51:07,205
has a big impact, not by the person who made the pencil,

1007
00:51:07,205 --> 00:51:08,426
but by the people who use it.

1008
00:51:08,777 --> 00:51:12,739
and this is really a new medium.

1009
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:13,560
Sorry to use that word.

1010
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:22,025
And so I'm curious how you plan on evolving your tool

1011
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:25,647
to allow artists to have impacts,

1012
00:51:25,647 --> 00:51:29,410
whether that means like entering into the movie industry

1013
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:30,751
or the video game industry,

1014
00:51:30,751 --> 00:51:34,193
or having Donald Trump sign a new executive order

1015
00:51:34,193 --> 00:51:36,695
in Tilt Brush or whatever it is.

1016
00:51:38,292 --> 00:51:41,514
That's an idea.

1017
00:51:41,514 --> 00:51:42,434
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1018
00:51:42,434 --> 00:51:47,817
I mean, I think the answer there is consumption.

1019
00:51:47,817 --> 00:51:55,081
And I think that that is almost a VR level problem.

1020
00:51:55,081 --> 00:51:56,802
Like I said at the start, we're like, oh,

1021
00:51:56,802 --> 00:51:59,283
if you build in Tilt Brush, you should only view it in VR.

1022
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,064
But then we saw how powerful it was to.

1023
00:52:01,764 --> 00:52:03,465
for people to integrate Tilt Brush

1024
00:52:03,465 --> 00:52:05,567
into their standard pipelines.

1025
00:52:05,567 --> 00:52:08,009
So we added export features and a lot of care

1026
00:52:08,009 --> 00:52:11,531
so that you could take it out of Tilt Brush.

1027
00:52:11,531 --> 00:52:13,433
And then we even added much later

1028
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:15,154
the ability to share to the web

1029
00:52:15,154 --> 00:52:17,456
and so now you can view sketches on your phone.

1030
00:52:18,977 --> 00:52:23,940
And so I think to maximize impact, you need to maximize that part of it.

1031
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:28,924
You need to maximize the ability for someone to use Tilt Brush or Quill or

1032
00:52:28,924 --> 00:52:34,228
any other VR content creation application, and then get it out.

1033
00:52:36,392 --> 00:52:41,717
I'll just add that I for me when I'm working on Tilt Brush, I like to I

1034
00:52:41,717 --> 00:52:49,063
Nostalgically think back to like as a kid using like super paint and Mac paint and like these little pick giant pixels

1035
00:52:49,063 --> 00:52:55,188
Maybe it's a 200 by 200 canvas or whatever and the tool was the tool was ridiculously immature, but it still

1036
00:52:55,188 --> 00:53:02,714
Made me think in a way that I think my brain was ready when like actual art creation on computers happened

1037
00:53:02,714 --> 00:53:02,974
and so

1038
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:08,218
I don't see it necessarily as a short-term effort, but it's more like you said, like

1039
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:13,942
with the AIR program in particular, our biggest goal is just to legitimize it as a new medium.

1040
00:53:13,942 --> 00:53:18,605
We want people to understand it's a new medium and to be thinking about how it will impact

1041
00:53:18,605 --> 00:53:23,828
their lives, even though, you know, who knows, like how that impact will ramp up, but it

1042
00:53:23,828 --> 00:53:28,310
feels like it's on a, you know, there's only, it's growing and it's going to be changing

1043
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:29,951
people's lives.

1044
00:53:29,951 --> 00:53:30,232
Thank you.

1045
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:37,007
This is less a question and more just a comment, but really love

1046
00:53:37,007 --> 00:53:40,954
till brush first tried it at a private valve demo. And I think

1047
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:43,739
my exact comment was this is the coolest shit I've ever seen.

1048
00:53:45,846 --> 00:53:49,188
And work at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

1049
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:51,789
We actually use it to prototype UX for AR, VR experiences

1050
00:53:51,789 --> 00:53:52,669
that we build.

1051
00:53:52,669 --> 00:53:55,951
So not all of them, but occasionally we'll go into it

1052
00:53:55,951 --> 00:53:57,952
and we'll say, well, what do we want?

1053
00:53:57,952 --> 00:54:00,213
And we'll start drawing it out until brush, and then we can

1054
00:54:00,213 --> 00:54:02,274
actually go and refine it and build it in our own tools.

1055
00:54:02,274 --> 00:54:04,715
But it's a really great way to sketch that out.

1056
00:54:04,715 --> 00:54:08,917
So thanks for making something like that possible.

1057
00:54:08,917 --> 00:54:09,838
Yeah, that's awesome.

1058
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:10,238
That's incredible.

1059
00:54:10,238 --> 00:54:11,659
Let us know what you need, what's broken.

1060
00:54:11,659 --> 00:54:13,100
We don't want any rockets crashing.

1061
00:54:14,575 --> 00:54:23,901
Hey, uh, so given that we now have ARKit and ARCore, have you thought about building Tilt Brush in AR?

1062
00:54:25,361 --> 00:54:29,665
Yeah, I mean, we've always talked about, uh, uh, we want to build tilt brush for whatever

1063
00:54:29,665 --> 00:54:35,050
platforms make sense. You know, like, um, we built that cardboard viewer a long time ago,

1064
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:40,154
uh, tilt brush gallery, uh, a long time ago, but it didn't ever make sense for us to try to

1065
00:54:40,154 --> 00:54:47,220
build a creation experience for cardboard because we feel that it requires six off head

1066
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,822
tracked, six off controllers. Thank you.

1067
00:54:56,485 --> 00:54:59,787
Hi, I love the tilt brushes selection of the paints,

1068
00:54:59,787 --> 00:55:02,509
but also the UX decisions and how it uses

1069
00:55:02,509 --> 00:55:03,930
the metaphor of the palette.

1070
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:09,053
And since you guys are so, one of the very early VR apps

1071
00:55:09,053 --> 00:55:11,174
that was available, I was curious what your process

1072
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:13,135
was like and how long it took to arrive

1073
00:55:13,135 --> 00:55:14,776
at that sort of decision.

1074
00:55:15,057 --> 00:55:19,183
Yeah, that mostly happened at ValveCamp.

1075
00:55:19,183 --> 00:55:23,749
You know, like when we showed up there, we had this DK2 version that was all cockpit.

1076
00:55:23,749 --> 00:55:28,175
And I think we had a slide in there that we pulled out that

1077
00:55:28,175 --> 00:55:31,299
was making fun of ourselves for not capturing more...

1078
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:38,327
like iterative footage from that time because a lot of our, um, a lot of the things we tried

1079
00:55:38,327 --> 00:55:43,993
would show up later. You know, what we first had, okay, the panels are around you. And then we

1080
00:55:43,993 --> 00:55:47,957
thought, well, you're in this room scale experience. Maybe they just float. Maybe they just hang out

1081
00:55:47,957 --> 00:55:52,181
and you can move them around, but then people didn't know how to interact.

1082
00:55:52,741 --> 00:55:55,362
We tried what we refer to as Batman belt,

1083
00:55:55,362 --> 00:55:57,042
where you press a button and they attach to

1084
00:55:57,042 --> 00:55:59,062
what we could guess is your hips,

1085
00:55:59,062 --> 00:56:03,604
and then you do this, but it was distracting.

1086
00:56:03,604 --> 00:56:06,304
Flavors of all of those that had springs attached to them

1087
00:56:06,304 --> 00:56:08,225
that would follow you around.

1088
00:56:08,225 --> 00:56:09,665
And eventually it just, whatever.

1089
00:56:09,665 --> 00:56:13,106
You know, like, let's try one more thing

1090
00:56:13,106 --> 00:56:16,687
where we just, you know, dismiss this controller.

1091
00:56:16,687 --> 00:56:18,047
I think there may have even been a time

1092
00:56:18,047 --> 00:56:19,327
when we were talking about Tilt Brush

1093
00:56:19,327 --> 00:56:21,668
would be a one controller application.

1094
00:56:22,248 --> 00:56:26,489
And we thought, well, let's use it and maybe attach the panels to it.

1095
00:56:26,489 --> 00:56:29,529
And then things grew out of that.

1096
00:56:29,529 --> 00:56:30,429
Yeah.

1097
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,230
It was really, I mean, to your point, it was very unexpected.

1098
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:36,291
We didn't think that prototype was going to work.

1099
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:40,411
We were just really lucky to be working on it at Valve

1100
00:56:40,411 --> 00:56:43,832
with a dedicated playtesting room and people running through

1101
00:56:43,832 --> 00:56:46,573
who were actually able to give us a thumbs up, thumbs down.

1102
00:56:46,573 --> 00:56:48,173
So that really helped us find it.

1103
00:56:48,173 --> 00:56:49,913
Awesome, thank you.

1104
00:56:52,173 --> 00:56:56,737
Hi, most mind blowing thing I've experienced in VR

1105
00:56:56,737 --> 00:56:58,339
is scale change in Tilt Brush.

1106
00:56:58,339 --> 00:57:00,441
And I'm wondering if you could tell me

1107
00:57:00,441 --> 00:57:01,902
if you have any further plans

1108
00:57:01,902 --> 00:57:04,885
for developing that functionality.

1109
00:57:06,743 --> 00:57:12,304
Yeah, I mean, that feature took longer than we hoped to actually push live

1110
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:17,505
because it's a delicate balance between simulator sickness.

1111
00:57:17,505 --> 00:57:21,246
You know, we had we had prototypes that you could flip the world over,

1112
00:57:21,246 --> 00:57:26,107
like the environment over that made me nauseous immediately.

1113
00:57:26,107 --> 00:57:28,868
And so that's why you can you know, you can only spin and scale.

1114
00:57:30,608 --> 00:57:39,274
There are flavors that we've talked about of, you know, being able to manipulate different canvases, different layers,

1115
00:57:39,274 --> 00:57:45,718
and have full control over those, but yeah, that's it. I mean, it really is a balance.

1116
00:57:45,718 --> 00:57:50,901
You need some sort of frame of reference if you're going to start whipping the whole world around on you.

1117
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:53,883
The squirrel helps.

1118
00:57:53,883 --> 00:57:56,644
Yeah, that was Drew's idea.

1119
00:57:59,072 --> 00:58:01,934
Excellent presentation. Thank you so much.

1120
00:58:01,934 --> 00:58:09,498
Has there been any discussions to expand Google Tilt Brush into a kind of Adobe After Effects for VR,

1121
00:58:09,498 --> 00:58:13,820
or to allow for hotspots and interactivity inside various scenes?

1122
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:19,492
Yeah, that's probably on the spreadsheet of future requests.

1123
00:58:19,492 --> 00:58:25,934
You know, one of the things that we've really tried to hold onto as we build Tilt Brush

1124
00:58:25,934 --> 00:58:33,595
out is that core experience that was received so positively during GDC, during the unveiling.

1125
00:58:33,595 --> 00:58:40,536
There's still a lot of people, I see on Twitter, that tweet things like, just tried out VR,

1126
00:58:40,536 --> 00:58:43,737
tried Tilt Brush, love it.

1127
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:48,641
right? Flattering, but it's also like we just gave a presentation on we've been working

1128
00:58:48,641 --> 00:58:50,883
on this thing for three years. And so there's...

1129
00:58:51,753 --> 00:58:57,334
it almost feel like there's a little bit of an obligation we have to keep the experience

1130
00:58:57,334 --> 00:59:03,696
for the first time room scale VR users. And so that's our balance. It's like how do you

1131
00:59:03,696 --> 00:59:09,857
how do you maintain that piece while expanding for our pro users and enabling artists and like

1132
00:59:09,857 --> 00:59:16,519
really graduating it to the 2.0 version of Tilt Brush. Yeah the only the only thing I was going

1133
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:17,499
to add to that is just that.

1134
00:59:18,102 --> 00:59:20,863
We've also stayed true to our rapid prototyping roots,

1135
00:59:20,863 --> 00:59:24,124
and we literally have hundreds of crazy prototypes

1136
00:59:24,124 --> 00:59:26,404
exploring every single thing we possibly could.

1137
00:59:26,404 --> 00:59:30,565
And we are gonna try and follow the pattern

1138
00:59:30,565 --> 00:59:32,706
defined in the deck,

1139
00:59:32,706 --> 00:59:36,347
and let the magical prototypes guide the way.

1140
00:59:36,347 --> 00:59:38,247
And we've had a few of them,

1141
00:59:38,247 --> 00:59:42,428
but the fun thing is no one knows what's gonna happen,

1142
00:59:42,428 --> 00:59:43,268
and which ones are gonna win,

1143
00:59:43,268 --> 00:59:44,369
and where they're gonna lead.

1144
00:59:44,369 --> 00:59:46,449
So, I'm just kind of along for the ride.

1145
00:59:49,135 --> 00:59:51,448
Awesome. Hey, thank you guys so much. Thank you. Thank you
