1
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:06,257
I am Matthew Davis.

2
00:00:07,098 --> 00:00:08,940
I'm one half of the team, Subset Games.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,565
I'm going to talk to you about how we made Into the Breach.

4
00:00:14,587 --> 00:00:17,831
On Subset Games, I am primarily the programmer, while Justin

5
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,194
Ma, who's sitting up here, is the artist.

6
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:21,696
We work together.

7
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:24,339
pretty much full-time, just the two of us

8
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:25,960
on the majority of the projects.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,521
And then we end up doing and hiring out contractors

10
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:32,103
and very talented people that fill in the skill gaps

11
00:00:32,143 --> 00:00:33,824
that we don't have to flesh out the game.

12
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:36,085
Stuff like music and sound effects especially.

13
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:39,126
Justin helped me on this whole talk,

14
00:00:39,426 --> 00:00:41,267
so even though I'm the one giving it,

15
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:43,488
a lot of the ideas and the concepts

16
00:00:43,528 --> 00:00:45,289
kind of represents our collective memory

17
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,451
of how we made the game and how we make games in general.

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,892
As I am a programmer, I'm not used to public speaking,

19
00:00:53,093 --> 00:00:54,314
so forgive me if it's a little rough.

20
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:58,076
I spent the last six years in my pajamas programming in my room,

21
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:01,339
not standing in front of a lot of people.

22
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:03,778
Our first game was FTL.

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,245
It was a hobby project that took off a lot more than we ever expected.

24
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:15,994
It was made in just 18 months, which in hindsight was spectacular.

25
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:20,520
At the time, we thought 18 months was a totally reasonable amount of time to put into a game.

26
00:01:21,394 --> 00:01:23,576
And then we did the advanced edition after that,

27
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:25,077
and we moved on to Into the Breach

28
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:26,838
with the security that FTL provided.

29
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,320
FTL went on, I mean, Into the Breach went on

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,582
to take just about four years.

31
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:33,743
And this talk is going to go through

32
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:36,265
why it took four years, the mistakes we made,

33
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:37,947
and the good things we did,

34
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:40,108
but ultimately that whole process

35
00:01:40,528 --> 00:01:42,250
of constant iteration and cuts

36
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,471
that led us from that original prototype on the left.

37
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,513
to the final game that hopefully you've all played on the right.

38
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:51,135
If you haven't played it, it's a micro-tactics game

39
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:56,539
that relies heavily on the mechanic that all enemy attacks are telegraphed

40
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:58,700
so you see what they're going to do before they actually do it.

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,242
And so the game generates these micro-puzzles

42
00:02:01,282 --> 00:02:04,243
where you have to respond to enemy actions before they've committed to them.

43
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,604
Before actually talking about Into the Breach specifically,

44
00:02:10,624 --> 00:02:12,586
I'm gonna introduce a concept that kind of runs

45
00:02:12,626 --> 00:02:14,228
through the thread of how we make games

46
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,350
and how we made Into the Breach,

47
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,935
which is designing with constraints.

48
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:25,021
Justin and I are very game design, gameplay design, whoops.

49
00:02:29,314 --> 00:02:29,574
Sorry.

50
00:02:31,256 --> 00:02:32,418
Gameplay design focused.

51
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:35,020
Everything else kind of has to follow the game design,

52
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,162
the narrative, the sound,

53
00:02:36,602 --> 00:02:38,424
all the elements that go in the game development

54
00:02:38,945 --> 00:02:40,707
end up kind of being a slave to the game design.

55
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:43,009
And then stepping one step further,

56
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,592
there's usually these key designs that we hold constant,

57
00:02:45,892 --> 00:02:47,174
the key mechanics and pillars

58
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,495
that make everything else work.

59
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:52,059
and it's a process of following those key designs

60
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:53,200
to create the game.

61
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,422
So like the shape shorter,

62
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,725
those key designs make up that framework

63
00:02:57,805 --> 00:02:59,867
and everything else from sound to game design

64
00:02:59,907 --> 00:03:01,248
has to slot into the shapes

65
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:04,031
that are determined by those key constants.

66
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,434
The fun part about that in the end

67
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:08,796
is you get to follow a design instead of creating a design.

68
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:12,199
Justin and I are terrible about big picture,

69
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,702
see the whole game, what we're gonna make, and go make it.

70
00:03:15,743 --> 00:03:18,786
We have to kind of discover it and iterate and prototype

71
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:21,189
and fumble our way towards the final game.

72
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,291
And the constraints are a key part

73
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:24,572
of being able to maintain that

74
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:26,574
and make sure you're paying attention

75
00:03:26,594 --> 00:03:27,776
to what's important to the design.

76
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,122
As a really trivial example, if you've decided to stick with an action RPG genre constraint

77
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:40,825
and you move on and you're doing the very classic mechanic of health, that health mechanic

78
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:44,886
is going to constrain a lot of the different mechanics that the rest of the game is going

79
00:03:44,906 --> 00:03:45,527
to be built around.

80
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:50,268
You're going to be stuck with probably some way to heal them, health potions and healing

81
00:03:50,288 --> 00:03:53,310
spells and the like, and you're going to have to deal with what happens when health runs

82
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:53,530
out.

83
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,110
Will you die?

84
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:55,971
Is the game over?

85
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:56,471
Et cetera.

86
00:03:57,773 --> 00:04:03,558
And as a less trivial example, if you went back to not using health, and there was no

87
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:06,160
health and no damage, then what would that do to the game?

88
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:07,521
How does it change?

89
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:12,986
How does that entire structure of how the game works would completely be turned on its

90
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:13,206
head?

91
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:17,570
And so chasing down those constraints, finding the interesting constraints, and seeing where

92
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,792
they lead you is how Justin and I like to make games.

93
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:24,297
I'm going to start by talking about how we found those constraints for Into the Breach,

94
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:28,120
the important ones that led to the game that we ended up making.

95
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:33,125
Even outside of the specific game, we are kind of stuck with our own personal constraints

96
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:33,785
as a studio.

97
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:38,850
There are practical constraints in that there are just two of us for most of the project,

98
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,551
and then a few more at the end of the project.

99
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:46,053
It means we're not going to be making grand designs of MMOs and big 3D RPGs.

100
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:48,954
We're going to be making smaller experiences inherently.

101
00:04:49,534 --> 00:04:51,375
Our design solutions have to be smaller.

102
00:04:53,035 --> 00:04:56,496
But it is a benefit in that with just two of us, we can iterate really well.

103
00:04:57,417 --> 00:05:02,458
We can cut design without affecting hundreds of other team members that have been working

104
00:05:02,498 --> 00:05:03,418
for years on something.

105
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:06,619
We can just say, oh, well, there's just two of us and move on to something else.

106
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,240
We don't have to update anybody else.

107
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,280
We can just push ahead.

108
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,900
On top of our team, there's just some subjective constraints

109
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,421
that we have.

110
00:05:17,362 --> 00:05:20,163
Ways that we approach design, aesthetics we like,

111
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:22,424
things that we like to see in our games.

112
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:24,946
A lot of these are going to look really

113
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:26,866
familiar in the sense of, obviously, game designers

114
00:05:26,886 --> 00:05:27,567
like these things.

115
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,028
But I think everyone has a different take on what

116
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:30,628
it means to them.

117
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:36,190
Readability is important to us, and for that, for us,

118
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,851
kind of specifically refers to limited menus,

119
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:41,791
kind of that single-screen combat UI like you see in FTL.

120
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,992
Most of the game happens just like that screenshot.

121
00:05:45,352 --> 00:05:47,433
You're not digging through really any other visuals.

122
00:05:49,753 --> 00:05:50,954
We also like very low numbers,

123
00:05:51,294 --> 00:05:54,895
an almost board game-like design with low health, low damage.

124
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,716
where one point of damage is meaningful

125
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,318
and then making that two points of damage is a huge change.

126
00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:02,259
Being able to make those really big changes

127
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:03,659
with small increments is fun.

128
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,422
Or looking at the shield bubbles we don't have in FTL.

129
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:09,022
You don't have percentages,

130
00:06:09,363 --> 00:06:12,264
you have just this really visceral bubble system

131
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:13,765
that you can just glance and see the counts,

132
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:15,046
they're kind of like tokens in a board game.

133
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:20,085
We like streamlined design where you're looking to minimize wasted time

134
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:23,567
And in hopefully making shorter experiences

135
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:27,769
We're not looking to make at least in these first games that we made

136
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:30,130
Really big 40-hour games

137
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,972
we were hoping to make something you could sit down and play in a lunchtime get a lot of design and

138
00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:39,554
compact gameplay in like a good punchy 20 minutes and be able to put it down as

139
00:06:39,614 --> 00:06:42,235
Opposed to you needn't commit your afternoon away to enjoy the game

140
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:47,324
Interesting choices is another one that sounds ridiculously obvious.

141
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:51,006
We're all out there making interesting choices, hopefully, in our games.

142
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:54,428
But I think that it's something we forget quite often.

143
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:57,590
Like, we get so bogged down in the designing systems

144
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,331
that if we don't stop to say,

145
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:01,572
wait, have we actually made an interesting choice?

146
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:04,073
Is this huge mess of systems

147
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:06,235
actually creating anything worth thinking about?

148
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:08,696
Or am I just doing busy work when I'm working Mario through them?

149
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:14,784
Beyond our own personal constraints and studio constraints,

150
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:18,087
we start out with what the game is to begin with.

151
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:20,649
And the easy one that we all start with is genre

152
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:22,931
that provides all of those early constraints

153
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:23,952
and all those early designs

154
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:25,433
that you can hang everything else off of.

155
00:07:26,494 --> 00:07:28,095
The trouble is you don't want to get too stuck on it.

156
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,237
And we want to find something

157
00:07:30,257 --> 00:07:32,339
that is slightly fresher in it, if we can.

158
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:34,440
With Into the Breach, we knew quite early

159
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,222
that we wanted to experiment

160
00:07:36,242 --> 00:07:37,643
with turn-based, grid-based gameplay.

161
00:07:38,364 --> 00:07:40,264
I was playing a lot of Hoplite, which is what you see up

162
00:07:40,324 --> 00:07:40,844
on the screen there.

163
00:07:41,745 --> 00:07:44,226
It's a brilliant, elegant, clean,

164
00:07:44,286 --> 00:07:46,506
roguelike experience on mobile that if you haven't played,

165
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:46,887
you should.

166
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:52,389
Justin and I have always liked tactical turn-based games.

167
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:54,109
Things like Final Fantasy and Advance Wars

168
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:55,770
are big touchstones, especially for Justin.

169
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,431
And we just thought it would be an interesting design

170
00:07:58,451 --> 00:07:59,291
space to explore.

171
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:04,094
We wanted to reduce random chance in the game, if we could.

172
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:08,176
Coming off of FTL, FTL was complimented and criticized

173
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:10,138
for the high degrees of randomness in the game.

174
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:13,480
As a response to that, not so much to fix it,

175
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,541
but as just a, what if we did something different?

176
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:18,983
We wanted to play with a game that would have

177
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:23,145
fewer die rolls, fewer just random slot machine-ish mechanics.

178
00:08:25,802 --> 00:08:28,203
Other than genre, a lot of the thematic trappings

179
00:08:28,223 --> 00:08:29,124
are quite important to us.

180
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:32,627
We approach games thinking, how do we

181
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:33,507
want the player to feel?

182
00:08:33,968 --> 00:08:35,409
What are the basic experience you're going to have?

183
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:38,951
And building the key game designs around that concept.

184
00:08:39,892 --> 00:08:41,833
For End of the Breach, collateral damage was kind of

185
00:08:41,874 --> 00:08:43,034
that core beginning thing.

186
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:45,977
There were a lot of movies at the time that had a lot of

187
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:47,598
damage and didn't really seem to care about it.

188
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,919
And we wanted to have that feeling that when you're

189
00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:52,481
committing to these massive explosions and massive damage,

190
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:54,543
that you're also committing to whatever you're doing to the

191
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:55,163
land around it.

192
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:58,582
And so the mechs versus monster theme

193
00:08:58,602 --> 00:08:59,885
kind of fell into that quite naturally.

194
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:01,449
Because when you have giant monsters

195
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,733
and giant robots fighting,

196
00:09:02,773 --> 00:09:04,718
you're naturally going to have that collateral damage.

197
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:09,290
So we start out with a prototype.

198
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,151
I mean, and that last screen in the terms of the genre

199
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,532
and the theme was basically all we have to go on

200
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:15,112
when we start.

201
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:18,813
We don't really dig into huge design documents,

202
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:19,834
as I had said earlier.

203
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,835
So we made something that is a relatively standard

204
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:23,675
tactics formula.

205
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:25,716
It's not really shaking up the genre too much.

206
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,197
It's just playing within what people

207
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:28,017
have already done before.

208
00:09:29,878 --> 00:09:33,000
You can see that this here is a telegraphed attack,

209
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:34,742
which we did have in the game from the beginning.

210
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:37,003
Though a lot of the other units

211
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,344
did not have telegraphed attacks,

212
00:09:38,404 --> 00:09:40,086
they just did standard on their turn,

213
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:42,668
they moved and hit you.

214
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,530
We were already playing with building damage

215
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,491
in that we had this casual encounter,

216
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:50,413
but it wasn't an end state or fail state.

217
00:09:50,594 --> 00:09:51,875
It wasn't really anything that important.

218
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:55,717
It was just a score or something to remind the player

219
00:09:55,757 --> 00:09:57,279
that they're hurting people

220
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:58,620
when they've been building free damage.

221
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:02,514
And we stuck with relatively familiar weapon designs,

222
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:03,755
even from the prototype.

223
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:06,498
You could recognize here the laser beam weapon

224
00:10:06,518 --> 00:10:08,139
that does end up in the final game.

225
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,561
I find it shocking when I look at the prototype

226
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:12,002
that there are ideas like that we stuck with,

227
00:10:12,323 --> 00:10:13,444
because it seems like at this point,

228
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:15,185
hey, that's most of the game.

229
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:16,486
Why did this take five years?

230
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:23,442
But from this point and this kind of standard tactics point,

231
00:10:23,482 --> 00:10:25,244
we explored a bunch of different ideas

232
00:10:25,484 --> 00:10:27,727
before we ended up settling on that telegraphed attacks

233
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:28,708
being the primary one.

234
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:33,553
One thing we played with was time in a turn-based game,

235
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,677
so inserting real-time elements where the enemy would.

236
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:40,520
have a countdown and every time the timer reached zero,

237
00:10:40,581 --> 00:10:42,022
like corruption were spread.

238
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:44,204
Some kind of mechanic would increase their power.

239
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:48,007
And the obvious attempt at doing like a chess timer

240
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:50,309
in a game like this that constantly created that pressure.

241
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,553
It wasn't bad, it just wasn't what we were going for.

242
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:57,315
We wanted to make a turn-based game

243
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:59,858
and have that kind of really careful, calculated play

244
00:10:59,978 --> 00:11:01,179
and really weighing your decisions.

245
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:03,441
And that ran contrary to that.

246
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:06,528
We played a lot with turn order.

247
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:11,290
Not just turn order in terms of how and when people acted,

248
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,931
but also what you acted and how you acted on your turn.

249
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:16,192
The traditional tactics game usually

250
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:18,033
runs with you move and you attack,

251
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,114
and that's what a unit gets to do.

252
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:21,854
And so we had a lot of stuff.

253
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:25,356
If you can see it with this, is what we're talking about.

254
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:27,216
And this is a functioning prototype.

255
00:11:27,576 --> 00:11:29,477
A lot of these were functioning games.

256
00:11:30,377 --> 00:11:32,338
We spent a year doing functioning games like this

257
00:11:32,398 --> 00:11:34,059
that we would throw out because we didn't like.

258
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,482
So here you can see that it's a strange concept where you can reposition or move your entire

259
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:42,963
squad for an action point.

260
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:45,364
You could attack with your mech for an action point.

261
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:48,226
Or you could move some tanks and attack with them for an action point.

262
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:52,888
Even explaining it is hard, and that's a really good example of why it was terrible.

263
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:59,531
And on top of that, we had this complex timeline system where, like, when enemies would act

264
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:02,833
and when players would act and you get a free movement, it's a mess.

265
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:03,693
It didn't work.

266
00:12:04,777 --> 00:12:08,722
And we added a timeline system where the more you acted,

267
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:11,205
the further back your units would go on the timeline.

268
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:14,209
So if you shot and you moved,

269
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:15,671
then you'd end up at the bottom of the timeline,

270
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,073
you wouldn't get to act again for a long time.

271
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:18,935
Or if you just moved,

272
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:20,397
then you'd probably get to act quite quickly.

273
00:12:21,981 --> 00:12:24,745
The ultimate result of that wasn't that interesting.

274
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:26,988
It was still essentially you had to move and shoot

275
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:28,911
because in order to shoot, you're gonna have to position.

276
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:32,195
And so mostly you moved the same amount down the timeline

277
00:12:32,616 --> 00:12:35,700
and it ended up with just a term-based system

278
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,803
wrapped up in a really complicated veneer.

279
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:43,268
And that was something that we run into a lot when it comes to experimenting with these

280
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:47,031
designs is you get a lot of really complex rules but not particularly interesting or

281
00:12:47,071 --> 00:12:47,471
deep rules.

282
00:12:47,992 --> 00:12:51,074
It goes back to that, wait, am I doing anything interesting here?

283
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:54,777
Am I creating interesting choices or am I just making systems for the sake of it?

284
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:56,959
And that's what most of this stuff was.

285
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:01,170
But the fun part about doing this and the, quote,

286
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,573
wasted time on these prototypes within the genre

287
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:06,955
was that we kind of get to prove to ourselves why

288
00:13:07,015 --> 00:13:08,537
the genre standards exist.

289
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:11,319
There's a lot of times that you might

290
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,002
want to put money into a game, put turn-based systems

291
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:14,522
into a game.

292
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:16,204
You just throw stuff into a game because we've all

293
00:13:16,224 --> 00:13:16,644
been doing it.

294
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:17,806
And we love the games that do it.

295
00:13:18,146 --> 00:13:19,908
And so we're pretty sure we want it in our game, too.

296
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:23,011
But when you experiment with changing them,

297
00:13:23,091 --> 00:13:23,671
you get to learn.

298
00:13:25,214 --> 00:13:27,916
why they're there, you get a better understanding for why they work,

299
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:30,437
you get a better understanding for how we can change them,

300
00:13:30,497 --> 00:13:33,179
how we can turn them on their side and do more interesting things with them.

301
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:37,683
So from this point, we

302
00:13:40,505 --> 00:13:41,205
focused on the...

303
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:47,847
telegraphed attacks. And by telegraphed attacks, I mean that all enemy attacks are shown, that

304
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:52,013
there's no mischance, and there's no hit chance, so those telegraphed attacks are reliable.

305
00:13:52,113 --> 00:13:56,599
The information is always going to be accurate. And the end result, hopefully, was that the

306
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,442
player turn was completely deterministic.

307
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:03,407
There would have to be a random chance in the sense that when an enemy acts, it randomly

308
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:05,149
chooses its position and its target.

309
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:10,213
But the hope that we had was once the player was doing their thing, they could completely

310
00:14:10,253 --> 00:14:15,218
rely on the information and what their units can do to come up with a solution and enact

311
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:16,439
that solution reliably.

312
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:19,732
And so from there, the question is,

313
00:14:19,832 --> 00:14:20,973
how does that guide the design?

314
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,595
So if we're gonna run with this concept

315
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:24,876
of telegraphed attacks, it's going to,

316
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,698
and we did not realize it actually at the time,

317
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:29,500
end up shaping the entire game from that point.

318
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:32,403
We thought it would be maybe a minor shift in the system,

319
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,945
but it kind of breaks every other tactics game system

320
00:14:34,985 --> 00:14:35,766
that we were used to.

321
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,828
And we had to find, through mostly trial and error,

322
00:14:39,349 --> 00:14:40,630
how it broke all those systems.

323
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:44,052
And so I'm gonna run down kind of some of the more

324
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,954
interesting and the major points on how it changed

325
00:14:45,994 --> 00:14:47,375
the combat from that point.

326
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:55,611
First, as a generality, if you look at a tactics game, a lot of it deals with managing threat.

327
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:02,114
You have these attack zones that the enemy has and that the player units have, and it's

328
00:15:02,174 --> 00:15:05,315
about staying out of their attack zones and putting them in your attack zones.

329
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:10,478
They tend to be, in this shot from Advance Wars, quite large, that you're not going to

330
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:14,699
actually be able to avoid all of the threat, that you're going to end up having to deal

331
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:14,980
with.

332
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,981
Hiding in trees for cover to reduce damage,

333
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:22,063
dealing with random dice rolls that varies the damage,

334
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:24,864
a lot of ways for that threat to get mitigated in some way.

335
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:29,867
XCOM uses cover, very large and big threat zones,

336
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:32,228
but a robust cover system to reduce

337
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:33,088
the chance of getting hit.

338
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:36,370
Telegraphed attacks kind of change all of that,

339
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,691
because a telegraph system means that

340
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:42,713
that threat zone shrinks to something incredibly small.

341
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:45,474
It becomes trivial to move a mech out of the way.

342
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,648
managing the threat no longer becomes part of the game.

343
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:53,430
And since 90% of a tactics game is about managing the threat,

344
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:54,990
then that kind of breaks the game.

345
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:59,013
And so you kind of, you could give up at that point,

346
00:15:59,153 --> 00:16:00,834
and I think there were times that we did

347
00:16:00,854 --> 00:16:02,454
because we didn't see immediate solutions,

348
00:16:02,955 --> 00:16:05,196
but you can kind of dig it down and see how can you make sure

349
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:06,777
that can still be functioning threat

350
00:16:07,137 --> 00:16:08,498
in a game with telegraphed attacks.

351
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:12,507
The solution that, if you've played the game,

352
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:13,509
you know what you've ended up on,

353
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,474
is that the buildings are where the primary problem lies,

354
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:20,141
and that the enemies have to destroy the buildings to win,

355
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,485
and the buildings, if they get destroyed, is how you lose.

356
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:26,460
In hindsight, that seems ridiculously obvious,

357
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,860
because buildings can't run away,

358
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,201
so just target the buildings.

359
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,301
It seems extra obvious because we wanted

360
00:16:31,321 --> 00:16:32,462
to target buildings anyway.

361
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,002
We wanted that to be part of the game,

362
00:16:34,082 --> 00:16:36,003
so it seems like it should have just slid into that point.

363
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:40,385
But it's another good example of how we get stuck

364
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:42,906
in genre and expectations for how game design works,

365
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:45,707
and that we still wanted the mechs to be the primary...

366
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:49,491
um, thing in the game to be the thing you wanted to protect.

367
00:16:49,872 --> 00:16:52,856
It's so natural, even now when you watch players play the game,

368
00:16:53,336 --> 00:16:55,079
it's so natural to see the, um...

369
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,150
you want to defend your units.

370
00:16:58,571 --> 00:17:00,132
The whole every other game before

371
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:03,615
is don't let your units get hurt and kill the enemy units.

372
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:05,756
Well, this needed us to be, no, no,

373
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:07,237
your units aren't that important,

374
00:17:07,378 --> 00:17:08,779
it's the buildings that are important.

375
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:11,181
But to start with, we did these designs

376
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:12,582
where if the buildings got damaged,

377
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:13,823
it would reduce the shield

378
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:15,264
and then your mechs would be vulnerable.

379
00:17:15,644 --> 00:17:16,605
And so then the day of the game

380
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,066
would still get pushed back to the mechs

381
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:19,587
being the meaningful element in the game.

382
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:21,429
But that never really worked.

383
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:23,130
It always fell apart for the same reason

384
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,672
in that once you hit that point, it was trivial again.

385
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,855
It was only interesting when you were worrying about the buildings getting damaged.

386
00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:34,461
So you follow the design down from telegraphed attacks, you end up with this defensive gameplay.

387
00:17:34,862 --> 00:17:40,468
This defending these immovable objects, which again has these knock-on effects in strange

388
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:43,871
ways for how that affects what I'm going to go into here, which is the fail state and

389
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:44,472
the win state.

390
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:46,774
From the win state point of view.

391
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,601
we saw quite quickly that killing enemies

392
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:53,023
just fundamentally wasn't as fun as manipulating them.

393
00:17:53,984 --> 00:17:56,045
When you have a system with these telegraphed attacks,

394
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:59,528
it's really satisfying to move their telegraphed attacks.

395
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,070
The teleport spells and the grappling,

396
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:05,133
teleport skills and the grappling weapons

397
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:07,555
and all the various ways you can push the enemies

398
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:09,296
were so much more fun and they made the player

399
00:18:09,336 --> 00:18:11,118
feel really smart when they're engaging in that.

400
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,120
And so, instead of running with the traditional

401
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,122
just kill all the enemies, we wanted a way that we could

402
00:18:17,023 --> 00:18:20,348
enhance that that nice part of the game that worked better than others.

403
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:24,340
We arrived at the turn limit concept,

404
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,583
where it was just X turns until the battle ended.

405
00:18:29,023 --> 00:18:29,823
It's quite simple.

406
00:18:30,024 --> 00:18:32,065
We've all done it in a thousand different ways

407
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:34,046
in terms of defend the hack of 20 minutes

408
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,708
or defend this zone.

409
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,289
It's the defensive gameplay kind of lends itself

410
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:39,030
to that concept.

411
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,392
It can be miserable if it's done and quite frustrating,

412
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:44,113
so we wanted to try to avoid that if we could.

413
00:18:44,654 --> 00:18:46,735
But the immediate initial end result was great

414
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:48,616
in that we could make interesting non-lethal weapons.

415
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:50,939
If it no longer became kill the enemy,

416
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:52,581
it just became survive a couple turns,

417
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:54,123
then you could do anything you wanted with the enemy

418
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,365
and have lots of fun with it,

419
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:56,647
and it didn't matter if anybody died.

420
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:02,572
The bonus benefits is the streamlining came in naturally.

421
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:08,054
A lot of turn-based games can have dead turns or dead space,

422
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,315
like when you're chasing down the final enemies

423
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:12,255
or when you're just finding the enemies to begin with.

424
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:14,256
While with a limited turn count,

425
00:19:14,316 --> 00:19:15,857
we found that we could really tighten it up

426
00:19:16,337 --> 00:19:18,858
to be impactful in every turn.

427
00:19:19,218 --> 00:19:21,258
That there was always interesting decisions to be made.

428
00:19:21,338 --> 00:19:24,719
You never really had to burn time just looking for things.

429
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,722
And then as a result, we discovered that micro battles were quite fun.

430
00:19:29,082 --> 00:19:33,306
The end battle length for End of the Breach is only four or five turns per battle.

431
00:19:33,886 --> 00:19:35,367
That was not something we set out to do.

432
00:19:35,648 --> 00:19:38,710
If you told me, make a game with four turn battles,

433
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,832
I would say that sounds really hard, and I have no idea how to do that.

434
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:43,214
But with...

435
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,256
the telegraphed attacks and just kind of following it naturally,

436
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:48,458
we discovered that four turn battles was really fun.

437
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:52,542
And it was a cool thing that I, I mean, I'm sure it exists elsewhere,

438
00:19:52,562 --> 00:19:54,304
but I couldn't think of an immediate example for it.

439
00:19:54,384 --> 00:19:56,606
And so it was a cool thing to just stumble across ourselves.

440
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:01,590
Other than the win state, to go back to the fail state,

441
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:05,474
I've already covered that the mechs getting killed couldn't really be the fail state.

442
00:20:05,814 --> 00:20:08,597
And so naturally it fell on the building damage being the fail state.

443
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:11,156
The trouble with that is that you can't say,

444
00:20:11,556 --> 00:20:14,098
because 10 buildings fell down, the whole world is lost.

445
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,059
From a thematic point of view, that just sounds ridiculous.

446
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,501
And so the big challenge comes, and this comes up a lot

447
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,462
for us, in how do you thematically wrap that game design?

448
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:25,264
We follow the constraints until we get to a design

449
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,044
that we think is the clear solution.

450
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:29,126
And since it's the most important thing,

451
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:31,267
the gameplay design is the most important thing to us,

452
00:20:31,527 --> 00:20:33,468
we need to then come up retroactively

453
00:20:33,728 --> 00:20:35,189
with something to explain why.

454
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,236
We explored a lot of stuff that's very traditional like morale and panic or energy levels

455
00:20:43,387 --> 00:20:44,267
None of them felt great.

456
00:20:45,048 --> 00:20:46,329
Even the last one that we ended up with,

457
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:47,690
I still don't think feels great.

458
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,531
I think it's the least bad option.

459
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:52,433
The narrative explanation of the buildings

460
00:20:52,493 --> 00:20:53,353
are powering the mechs,

461
00:20:53,613 --> 00:20:54,794
and if the buildings get destroyed,

462
00:20:54,814 --> 00:20:55,895
your mechs don't work anymore.

463
00:20:56,675 --> 00:20:57,856
It functions, I don't even think

464
00:20:57,896 --> 00:20:59,577
we really explain it very well in the game.

465
00:20:59,898 --> 00:21:01,359
We mostly run with the idea of,

466
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,420
oh look, the player sees this as power grid,

467
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,300
that sounds important.

468
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:06,282
And it works.

469
00:21:07,202 --> 00:21:08,943
It's not brilliant, you wouldn't write a book about it

470
00:21:09,003 --> 00:21:11,365
or a movie about it, but it functions enough

471
00:21:11,425 --> 00:21:13,766
that you can ignore it for the purpose

472
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:14,907
of the game design function.

473
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:19,269
Following that further, that end state

474
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,850
creates another problem, in that you have

475
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,372
these checkmate scenarios, where the enemy

476
00:21:23,592 --> 00:21:25,633
is attacking too many buildings that you can't stop.

477
00:21:25,873 --> 00:21:27,254
This example here, these two buildings

478
00:21:27,294 --> 00:21:28,935
are gonna get killed, and that one mech

479
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:29,856
can't do anything about it.

480
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:31,737
So you know you've lost.

481
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,319
In chess, that would just be checkmate and you'd stop playing.

482
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,484
It would be very frustrating to throw up the enemy Vex saying,

483
00:21:41,544 --> 00:21:42,745
checkmate, you've lost.

484
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:44,867
That's not how you want a big epic battle to win.

485
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:47,449
You want something a lot more thematic than that.

486
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:52,293
But having the player play out a dead turn and then hit end turn,

487
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,835
which might as well be a I lose button, is really mean.

488
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,677
And that's a really unsatisfying way to lose the game as well.

489
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:02,481
And so we had to do something strange in hindsight

490
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:05,403
of inserting randomness into an otherwise

491
00:22:05,423 --> 00:22:06,384
deterministic design.

492
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:09,426
So we followed this design down that was guided

493
00:22:09,526 --> 00:22:12,049
by deterministic design, but the kind of,

494
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:14,050
one of the final key solutions was,

495
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,511
oh wait, we need a mischance.

496
00:22:15,972 --> 00:22:17,993
We need this random chance to still be in the game.

497
00:22:18,614 --> 00:22:20,636
This way when the player hits and turn,

498
00:22:21,036 --> 00:22:23,158
there's this grid defense that's a very low

499
00:22:23,198 --> 00:22:25,300
percentage chance that whenever the building

500
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,282
gets damaged, they won't actually get hurt.

501
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,515
And so there's always a chance, no matter how dire

502
00:22:31,555 --> 00:22:33,756
the situation is, the player can cross their fingers

503
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:35,557
and hit enter and maybe keep playing.

504
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:38,139
And that was an incredibly important part of the game.

505
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,460
We like to build out systems that are interconnected,

506
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,461
we don't like to just have them hanging there.

507
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:45,842
So we built a lot of things like pilot skills

508
00:22:45,902 --> 00:22:48,444
to increase grid defense, or ways to overpower

509
00:22:48,504 --> 00:22:51,205
the grid defense, and built a lot of structure around it.

510
00:22:52,045 --> 00:22:55,306
But ultimately, I feel like that's if you're building

511
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:59,207
like a building and you need this gross, ugly pillar

512
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:00,868
in the middle of the room to keep your ceiling up,

513
00:23:01,568 --> 00:23:03,828
and then you hang some pictures on it

514
00:23:03,888 --> 00:23:06,689
so it's not that bad, it doesn't help.

515
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:09,190
And ultimately, we just kind of annoyed players.

516
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,911
They really hated the pilot good defense skill.

517
00:23:12,231 --> 00:23:13,211
It had to be very low

518
00:23:13,231 --> 00:23:14,911
because we couldn't have them relying on it.

519
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:17,052
And it was just kind of drawing attention

520
00:23:17,152 --> 00:23:19,132
to an otherwise just necessary,

521
00:23:19,192 --> 00:23:20,673
but not super great mechanic.

522
00:23:24,517 --> 00:23:26,838
In hindsight, I probably would make it almost hidden,

523
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,159
something you wouldn't manipulate,

524
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,900
something that just always had a chance to do,

525
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,361
but you don't talk too much about the player,

526
00:23:31,381 --> 00:23:32,522
just they know it exists.

527
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:38,827
So, telegraphed attacks led to the defensive gameplay,

528
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:40,808
which leads down to the turn timer win state

529
00:23:41,148 --> 00:23:42,429
and the power grid fail state

530
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:44,110
and all the stuff that kind of spun out from that.

531
00:23:44,611 --> 00:23:46,272
But I'm gonna sidestep and talk a little bit

532
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:48,613
about the UI challenges that came along with the rest of it.

533
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:53,046
A lot of this is going to focus on UI guided design,

534
00:23:53,226 --> 00:23:55,647
because you'll see that it's amazing how much the UI

535
00:23:55,707 --> 00:23:57,047
ended up influencing the design

536
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,348
instead of the other way around.

537
00:23:59,948 --> 00:24:02,529
We found that we were going for a chess-like interface.

538
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:04,249
With chess, you're looking at that board,

539
00:24:04,469 --> 00:24:06,149
you know, assuming you've played chess,

540
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,970
how the game works, you know what the pieces are,

541
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,891
you know who can attack who, where the threat lies.

542
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:13,731
You don't need to mouse over the pawn

543
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:14,971
to double check what it does.

544
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:19,411
We wanted to have a feeling like that with Into the Breach.

545
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:23,373
We wanted you to see each puzzle and have it act like a little micro chess

546
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:27,976
puzzle that you could plan out your moves without double-checking

547
00:24:28,357 --> 00:24:29,257
everything on the board.

548
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:31,999
The early iterations of that didn't have that.

549
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:32,700
It was a mess.

550
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,062
Even looking at this screen now myself, I don't really know what's attacking what.

551
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,220
This is an example of the game today without the icons

552
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,040
that we ended up adding.

553
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,801
And it spent years to add the icons

554
00:24:46,841 --> 00:24:47,942
and figure out which ones we needed.

555
00:24:47,982 --> 00:24:49,802
Some of them were added as late as just like

556
00:24:49,842 --> 00:24:50,843
three months before release.

557
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,124
It was a case of they look so painfully obvious

558
00:24:54,164 --> 00:24:56,905
in hindsight, but it was putting it in front of play testers,

559
00:24:56,965 --> 00:24:58,506
have them be confused, get it back,

560
00:24:58,726 --> 00:24:59,806
put it in front of play testers,

561
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,427
have them be confused, put it back.

562
00:25:01,507 --> 00:25:04,728
And it's just ad nauseum for years to sort it out.

563
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:07,842
These are the ones we ended up running with.

564
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:10,102
They're highlighted in yellow to make it a little bit clearer.

565
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:15,323
And the initial goal with these was just to show what was attacking what.

566
00:25:15,684 --> 00:25:17,764
So you could see that this guy quickly was attacking this,

567
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:19,624
and this guy quickly was attacking this.

568
00:25:20,765 --> 00:25:22,365
We thought that was all that really mattered,

569
00:25:22,585 --> 00:25:25,285
is that the target for each enemy was what you needed to show.

570
00:25:25,866 --> 00:25:28,426
But we learned from iteration and experimenting more,

571
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,827
was that the attack type was also important to show.

572
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:34,338
that it was really meaningful if this Firefly unit

573
00:25:34,518 --> 00:25:36,140
was punching this mech,

574
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,502
or if that unit was shooting this mech,

575
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:40,043
because when you move him,

576
00:25:41,444 --> 00:25:44,087
it's going to dramatically affect the end result

577
00:25:44,267 --> 00:25:45,988
if this unit will punch this space,

578
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:49,611
or if he will shoot this space and damage the building.

579
00:25:50,752 --> 00:25:53,615
Having the UI need to show both target and type

580
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,017
hugely constrained the possibilities,

581
00:25:56,497 --> 00:25:58,459
because you've just made it exponentially more difficult

582
00:25:58,499 --> 00:25:59,980
to show the information you need.

583
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:03,745
And so that's what really ended up saying we had to go back

584
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:06,729
and instead of building a UI that could describe

585
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:09,413
all of our weapons, we had to start building weapons

586
00:26:09,453 --> 00:26:10,855
that could be described by the UI.

587
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:17,461
The new constraints that we started with were just three attack types, so the same ones you saw in the last one,

588
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:21,104
in that there are artillery attacks, melee attacks, and projectile attacks.

589
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:25,027
They provided enough variety to have interesting ways to interact with them,

590
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,670
but were also restrained enough that you could quickly recognize them.

591
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,251
They exist in other games, they're not doing anything that crazy.

592
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:37,643
We did not originally have particularly limited attack zones.

593
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:40,586
You had this situation where you have no idea

594
00:26:40,626 --> 00:26:42,568
what this is doing, where this is coming from.

595
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:45,970
It is these units here, but there's no way of knowing that.

596
00:26:47,592 --> 00:26:50,314
Their threat range, I think, was the traditional

597
00:26:50,614 --> 00:26:52,256
radius around an artillery unit,

598
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,018
which was hard to predict and see on the screen.

599
00:26:55,638 --> 00:26:58,000
We also experimented even with player weapons,

600
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,462
these strange attack ranges.

601
00:26:59,482 --> 00:27:01,323
You can see this is almost like a four-leaf clover.

602
00:27:02,424 --> 00:27:15,000
And the hope was that you would have almost like a Tetris-like game where you could layer these shapes and kind of figure out the optimal placement against the enemy shapes in a very traditional tactics method of managing those threat zones.

603
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:17,984
But it meant always checking threat ranges.

604
00:27:19,025 --> 00:27:20,086
every time you moved your unit,

605
00:27:20,146 --> 00:27:21,807
you weren't sure where that unit was going to be able

606
00:27:21,827 --> 00:27:22,208
to attack.

607
00:27:22,568 --> 00:27:23,809
It meant looking at an enemy unit,

608
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:25,971
you couldn't tell which enemy was attacking where.

609
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,313
And so we shred all that down

610
00:27:28,473 --> 00:27:30,154
to just being orthogonal attacks,

611
00:27:30,254 --> 00:27:32,056
just shooting up, down, left, or right.

612
00:27:33,317 --> 00:27:36,179
This had the benefit of, for player attacks,

613
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,141
as long as you can move to the space,

614
00:27:38,181 --> 00:27:39,922
and if you knew what places you could move to,

615
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:40,983
then you knew where you could shoot,

616
00:27:41,003 --> 00:27:42,945
because it was very easy to tell you could shoot up,

617
00:27:42,985 --> 00:27:44,706
down, left, or right from where your destination.

618
00:27:45,348 --> 00:27:48,416
and similarly all of the enemies lined up with their attacks

619
00:27:48,937 --> 00:27:52,647
so it made it much easier at a glance to see what enemy it was attacking where.

620
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,788
And the last major constraint, though there were many, many more,

621
00:27:57,869 --> 00:28:01,433
was these static enemy designs.

622
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:04,697
This is kind of running with the almost chess-like interface

623
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:07,300
in that once the player has learned the units,

624
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,922
the units are reliably the same.

625
00:28:09,743 --> 00:28:12,245
A Firefly unit is always a Firefly unit.

626
00:28:12,346 --> 00:28:14,688
It has the same health, the same weapon, and the same movement.

627
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,812
That created a huge design challenge later on

628
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:21,215
when we started worrying about difficulty and balance.

629
00:28:23,037 --> 00:28:24,678
When it comes to balancing the difficulty,

630
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:27,721
it's super helpful if we could have made micro-changes.

631
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:30,945
If we could have said, this one extra unit

632
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:32,286
does one extra point of damage,

633
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:33,387
and that way it could...

634
00:28:34,488 --> 00:28:39,431
Shift the game slightly without breaking it because end of the breach really runs into a problem that if it's slightly harder

635
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:40,772
It can be nearly insolvable

636
00:28:41,913 --> 00:28:45,155
But since we needed everything to be static we didn't have that option

637
00:28:45,715 --> 00:28:51,319
We did run with this concept of purple units which are significant power upgrades to the existing ones

638
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:59,104
They have they across the board more health more damage and more movement, but it consistently so and they behave very similarly

639
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:03,106
So this firefly unit still shoots out a projectile just like this one

640
00:29:04,413 --> 00:29:06,800
We explored more changes to that,

641
00:29:07,241 --> 00:29:09,508
like the original design was this unit

642
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,795
would also push its target.

643
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,362
while the basic version of it did not.

644
00:29:15,062 --> 00:29:17,084
But that shift was really hard to remember

645
00:29:17,144 --> 00:29:18,965
and keep track of.

646
00:29:19,585 --> 00:29:20,846
You thought you had the Firefly down,

647
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:22,768
you understood how to stop a Firefly unit,

648
00:29:22,908 --> 00:29:24,089
and then when they get upgraded,

649
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:26,110
suddenly blocking a pushing attack

650
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,292
is hugely different than blocking a static attack,

651
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:30,313
because it might push your mech into a building.

652
00:29:30,953 --> 00:29:33,155
And that kind of swap to how you deal with the units

653
00:29:33,195 --> 00:29:34,896
was too difficult, so we had to cut that.

654
00:29:35,797 --> 00:29:36,337
It had...

655
00:29:37,457 --> 00:29:40,842
a very strange knock on effect that you'll notice that there's very few game

656
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:43,045
um... enemies in the game with push attacks

657
00:29:44,047 --> 00:29:44,627
uh... there's only

658
00:29:46,302 --> 00:29:48,263
I think just the beetle, maybe one other.

659
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:50,944
And it was kind of a direct result of this,

660
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:54,565
in that we didn't want push attacks on the early units,

661
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,966
because we wanted the game to be more accessible

662
00:29:57,407 --> 00:29:59,307
and functional on those early islands and easier,

663
00:29:59,347 --> 00:30:01,208
and push attacks made it really complex.

664
00:30:02,089 --> 00:30:03,909
But then we couldn't change those units

665
00:30:04,209 --> 00:30:05,070
in the later portions,

666
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,991
because we had to keep that static enemy design.

667
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:12,017
And so by accident we ended up with that mechanic almost being cut from the game

668
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:16,784
and we didn't really even realize that until quite late in the process that that's what had happened

669
00:30:17,144 --> 00:30:21,330
which is kind of sad but it was worth it in the sense of that consistency of gameplay

670
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,732
really made the enemies manageable.

671
00:30:25,204 --> 00:30:29,326
You can see all these combined resulted in massive cuts to weapon design.

672
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:35,629
Justin had made these amazing upgrade trees where this is a unit that never actually existed

673
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:42,512
in the final version, but the huge spread of how weapons might change and get managed

674
00:30:42,552 --> 00:30:47,394
and the shapes they might make, and when we actually realized all these UI constraints,

675
00:30:47,655 --> 00:30:48,815
we had to ditch all of this stuff.

676
00:30:49,707 --> 00:30:51,469
which was a shame, but it was for the best

677
00:30:51,509 --> 00:30:53,991
and that tighter, more elegant weapon design

678
00:30:54,031 --> 00:30:55,713
really benefited all the other constraints

679
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:56,274
that were in the game.

680
00:30:56,294 --> 00:31:00,438
So you can see how we're growing this web

681
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:01,920
off of telegraphed attacks.

682
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:10,141
And while it's also influenced by a lot of those core personal constraints that we had

683
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:14,945
that I talked about at the beginning, it is ultimately back to following telegraphed attacks

684
00:31:14,965 --> 00:31:16,286
that got us to everywhere that we were.

685
00:31:16,906 --> 00:31:21,390
And this was a multi-year process, taking all the way up to the end of development in

686
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,551
terms of sorting this stuff out.

687
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:26,294
I wish it was as easy as just, oh, there's obvious solutions once you pay attention to

688
00:31:26,314 --> 00:31:28,495
this, but for us it wasn't quite that simple.

689
00:31:29,336 --> 00:31:33,079
And as a better example of how it wasn't quite that simple, I'm going to move and talk about

690
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,300
the strategy layer design.

691
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,089
which is a big shift away from the combat for a minute,

692
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,792
as I've been rambling quite a lot about the combat here.

693
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:42,956
And for the strategy design, what I mean by that,

694
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:44,257
because you'd think the whole game is strategy,

695
00:31:44,317 --> 00:31:45,518
so what am I talking about?

696
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,143
This, all the stuff that happens in between the combat.

697
00:31:49,703 --> 00:31:52,266
The, that big XCOM map that.

698
00:31:52,947 --> 00:31:54,947
you're used to seeing that gives you an excuse

699
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:56,028
to tie the missions together

700
00:31:56,128 --> 00:31:57,708
and has lots of other stuff on top of that.

701
00:31:58,108 --> 00:32:00,049
We love Dexcom and love the games of its ilk

702
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:02,089
and we wanted to have that mechanic in the game.

703
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,370
We wanted to have you care about your pilots

704
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:07,331
and manage squads and repair them and juggle resources

705
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:10,112
and deal with the upgrade trees and research

706
00:32:10,132 --> 00:32:10,932
and all that stuff,

707
00:32:11,072 --> 00:32:12,673
because all that stuff is super duper fun

708
00:32:12,793 --> 00:32:14,073
and we thought of course we'd want this.

709
00:32:16,303 --> 00:32:21,046
It's worth noting that we were simultaneously designing the strategy layer and the combat.

710
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:25,688
In the way this talk is structured, it might seem like we're like, oh great, combat's complete,

711
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:26,729
let's figure out the rest of the game.

712
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:29,150
But it was a lot more in parallel to that.

713
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:36,014
And so a lot of the constraints weren't quite figured out, and we probably, and we suffered

714
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:38,155
a lot more on the strategy side for that reason.

715
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,873
We started with a very large scale world

716
00:32:42,893 --> 00:32:49,016
with lots of nodes and you'd have your little mech squads,

717
00:32:49,276 --> 00:32:50,937
multiple squads that you were managing,

718
00:32:50,977 --> 00:32:53,158
running around the world and chasing down enemy units.

719
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,559
It was very board gaming, it was very abstract.

720
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:58,020
We even had a card system where you draw cards

721
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,501
to get events and insert technology into it.

722
00:33:02,182 --> 00:33:04,203
A lot of deck building games were all the rage

723
00:33:04,263 --> 00:33:05,903
and so we were trying to put that into the game.

724
00:33:06,544 --> 00:33:09,225
Or you can see here that this is a corruption mechanic.

725
00:33:10,065 --> 00:33:14,531
that the enemy could explode into neighboring territories.

726
00:33:15,132 --> 00:33:18,436
That was me playing far too much Pandemic during development.

727
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:24,163
I fall into that all the time of, wait, what did I enjoy yesterday?

728
00:33:24,183 --> 00:33:25,524
Okay, I'm going to put this in the game.

729
00:33:27,984 --> 00:33:29,365
It was dull to chase the enemies around.

730
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:32,087
Chasing squads and pawns on the board just wasn't fun.

731
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,889
You didn't actually care about these abstract nodes.

732
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:36,910
It didn't satisfy what we're looking for at all.

733
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,271
And ultimately, and this wasn't necessarily

734
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:41,833
negative inherently, it was going to be a huge game.

735
00:33:42,293 --> 00:33:44,775
This had to end up feeling very exclamative

736
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:48,117
in that it was going to take you 20 hours to do.

737
00:33:48,678 --> 00:33:50,399
We could tell ahead of time that that's where

738
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:51,900
the design constraints would lead us.

739
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,762
And that wasn't really what we were looking to make.

740
00:33:56,323 --> 00:33:59,866
Despite spending, I don't remember exactly how long,

741
00:33:59,886 --> 00:34:02,448
but probably six months at least, maybe a year,

742
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:04,650
we cut all of this and tried something else.

743
00:34:06,992 --> 00:34:08,693
We went for something smaller, something

744
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,255
that you could maybe care about where

745
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:14,839
you'd have these four different maps that you kept returning to.

746
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,321
And you'd be repairing the buildings, and managing,

747
00:34:17,741 --> 00:34:19,863
and kind of learning to love your little home here.

748
00:34:22,318 --> 00:34:24,140
The end result wasn't great as well.

749
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,226
Oh, it's worth noting as well that there are two games here.

750
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,168
It looks like one in the sense that we've got

751
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:33,372
these four squires, but this side has a lot more

752
00:34:33,392 --> 00:34:36,476
of this energy management where you're upgrading squads

753
00:34:36,677 --> 00:34:39,600
and repairing squads and having a research tree.

754
00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:43,062
and it's a lot more juggly with the resources,

755
00:34:43,322 --> 00:34:45,443
while this side ends up a lot more XCOM-y

756
00:34:45,923 --> 00:34:48,824
with events that come up in certain time scales

757
00:34:49,204 --> 00:34:50,345
with the whole time system,

758
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,246
and you have your units in and out of battle,

759
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:54,166
but it's just the core units with a few extras,

760
00:34:54,827 --> 00:34:57,548
and big text events, kind of like FTL.

761
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:02,841
Ultimately both of these were very complex but not very deep.

762
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:06,083
It goes back to the, I'm building out this huge system,

763
00:35:06,363 --> 00:35:08,545
but I'm gonna stop and say I'm actually making

764
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:10,826
interesting decisions in this huge system.

765
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:13,948
The research system was completely failing.

766
00:35:14,189 --> 00:35:16,230
It was failing for the reasons that I've talked about

767
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,632
and that the weapon design really couldn't support

768
00:35:19,292 --> 00:35:22,034
that research system, but we didn't know that at the time.

769
00:35:22,394 --> 00:35:23,815
We were blindly charging ahead

770
00:35:23,895 --> 00:35:25,496
because we thought we liked upgrade systems.

771
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:32,930
These suffered, as did the other one, as do most strategy layers, from ambiguous fail state.

772
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:38,232
It's not necessarily a problem. A lot of games do have it and it functions.

773
00:35:38,732 --> 00:35:43,454
Civilization, I think, has quite an ambiguous fail state in that you don't, or I don't,

774
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,376
normally play all the way up until I've lost my last city.

775
00:35:47,836 --> 00:35:49,757
Like, I see the writing on the wall and I say,

776
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,978
oh, I'm just going to scrap this and go and start a new game.

777
00:35:52,499 --> 00:35:54,219
And we would rather that the player...

778
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,220
played all the way up to the end.

779
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:58,161
That they always thought they had a chance

780
00:35:58,321 --> 00:36:00,943
and that it was really clear, like a health bar,

781
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:02,063
which is what we ran with,

782
00:36:02,424 --> 00:36:04,205
that can show you where your fail state lies

783
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,005
and what's gonna happen.

784
00:36:06,966 --> 00:36:09,047
And text events didn't work in this game.

785
00:36:09,307 --> 00:36:11,709
I think this is more our narrative failings as writers

786
00:36:11,729 --> 00:36:15,591
than it is that the inherent mechanics didn't work.

787
00:36:15,971 --> 00:36:17,732
Since Justin and I work in isolation

788
00:36:17,872 --> 00:36:18,792
to prototype this stuff,

789
00:36:19,032 --> 00:36:20,633
we didn't work yet with Chris Avalone,

790
00:36:20,933 --> 00:36:22,834
who did the brilliant writing in the game at the end.

791
00:36:23,795 --> 00:36:25,735
and we had a lot of troubles writing text events

792
00:36:25,775 --> 00:36:26,355
for this game.

793
00:36:26,996 --> 00:36:29,076
FTL was so easy to build out a world

794
00:36:29,156 --> 00:36:31,316
that you go to new systems and meet aliens

795
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,197
and there's politics and you talk to people

796
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:34,877
and there's pirates and space stations

797
00:36:34,937 --> 00:36:39,338
and just an incredible diverse set of crap to pull from.

798
00:36:39,858 --> 00:36:42,439
Well, this was a single city with a couple mechs,

799
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,159
enemies that you couldn't talk to

800
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:45,559
because they're just mindless beasts.

801
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,480
And the narrative potential for us as amateur writers

802
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,221
was not there and so we really couldn't make

803
00:36:51,261 --> 00:36:52,281
anything interesting out of it.

804
00:36:55,152 --> 00:36:56,912
And so at this point, we're years into development,

805
00:36:57,853 --> 00:37:00,634
and we're incredibly despondent and frustrated

806
00:37:00,694 --> 00:37:01,654
that none of this is working,

807
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:03,274
that we honestly don't think

808
00:37:03,294 --> 00:37:04,575
that there's going to be a game here.

809
00:37:05,155 --> 00:37:08,236
As we're developing this in simultaneous with the combat,

810
00:37:09,697 --> 00:37:11,858
even the combat, while it was looking interesting,

811
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,158
it looked like it had more potential, it wasn't great,

812
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:15,879
and the strategy layer was terrible.

813
00:37:16,379 --> 00:37:18,362
And so that's really between the two,

814
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,444
you weren't looking at a great game.

815
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,408
And so we really did consider quitting and dropping it

816
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,932
and starting something new multiple times in development.

817
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:26,574
We took breaks to make other prototypes

818
00:37:27,335 --> 00:37:29,498
just to kind of get away from it and clear our brains

819
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:30,400
because it was miserable.

820
00:37:31,861 --> 00:37:34,523
In hindsight, I think that all of the strategy layer stuff

821
00:37:34,563 --> 00:37:36,885
was failing because we were ignoring the constraints

822
00:37:36,925 --> 00:37:38,026
that were imposed by the combat.

823
00:37:38,526 --> 00:37:40,067
I've introduced most of them already,

824
00:37:40,087 --> 00:37:41,768
and that the telegraphed attacks

825
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:43,470
with the limited weapon types

826
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,471
meant that you couldn't really upgrade anything.

827
00:37:45,911 --> 00:37:47,653
All those awesome research trees

828
00:37:48,153 --> 00:37:49,054
couldn't be a part of the game,

829
00:37:49,594 --> 00:37:51,075
and that was an inherent part of the combat

830
00:37:51,095 --> 00:37:52,776
that we were refusing to acknowledge

831
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:54,718
because we desperately wanted upgrade trees

832
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:55,298
to be in the game.

833
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,480
That building defense focus

834
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,421
meant that units were not as important anymore.

835
00:38:00,302 --> 00:38:02,942
And so building out the squads and carrying,

836
00:38:03,142 --> 00:38:04,703
and while we did have that pilot system

837
00:38:04,723 --> 00:38:07,343
in the final version, we wanted it to be a lot more complex

838
00:38:07,543 --> 00:38:09,844
and having to devote resources to repairing mechs

839
00:38:10,304 --> 00:38:11,825
and devote time to repairing mechs,

840
00:38:12,305 --> 00:38:15,125
but that and making you care about the buildings more

841
00:38:15,566 --> 00:38:18,026
didn't match and we didn't really acknowledge that

842
00:38:18,126 --> 00:38:19,527
in these early versions either.

843
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,268
So instead of actually completely giving up on the game,

844
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:28,669
we completely gave up on the Stratula.

845
00:38:29,753 --> 00:38:36,023
And we moved on to this version, which was fundamentally cut everything except for what

846
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:37,065
would tie missions together.

847
00:38:37,586 --> 00:38:40,471
So you just would pick from a list of missions.

848
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,911
And that was the whole strategy layer.

849
00:38:44,671 --> 00:38:47,711
You had, we just wanted you basically to go from

850
00:38:47,731 --> 00:38:50,152
a complex system with tons of choices

851
00:38:50,332 --> 00:38:51,812
to a very simple system with one choice.

852
00:38:52,312 --> 00:38:53,852
And that one choice would have clear rewards

853
00:38:54,192 --> 00:38:55,853
and you would make one interesting choice

854
00:38:56,013 --> 00:38:56,913
and then start your next battle.

855
00:38:57,493 --> 00:38:58,353
And that could work.

856
00:38:59,113 --> 00:39:00,934
And the amazing part was it did work.

857
00:39:02,254 --> 00:39:03,954
The combat at this point was functioning enough

858
00:39:04,014 --> 00:39:05,454
that this could sustain the game

859
00:39:06,615 --> 00:39:08,795
in a way that all the other strategy layers

860
00:39:08,815 --> 00:39:09,715
weren't sustaining it.

861
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:10,675
So.

862
00:39:13,088 --> 00:39:14,369
It was fun for the first time.

863
00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:15,710
We sent it to people and they're like,

864
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,531
oh, this is interesting.

865
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:18,992
This actually, maybe you have another fun game here.

866
00:39:19,413 --> 00:39:20,694
And this was years down the line.

867
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:21,955
We haven't told anyone we're making it

868
00:39:21,975 --> 00:39:22,835
and we still weren't gonna rush out

869
00:39:22,855 --> 00:39:24,637
and tell anyone publicly we were making it.

870
00:39:24,977 --> 00:39:27,079
But it was really encouraging to finally have this.

871
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:30,381
It wasn't what we were necessarily looking to make.

872
00:39:30,642 --> 00:39:31,842
It wasn't what we set out to make.

873
00:39:32,263 --> 00:39:34,444
But it was an acceptance, again, of that least bad option.

874
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:35,826
The acceptance that...

875
00:39:36,766 --> 00:39:38,428
this is what benefits the design,

876
00:39:39,148 --> 00:39:41,090
and it also put us back into a position

877
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,571
that Justin and I were most comfortable.

878
00:39:43,552 --> 00:39:44,533
As I had said at the beginning,

879
00:39:44,573 --> 00:39:47,355
we're terrible at that huge, big picture design.

880
00:39:47,415 --> 00:39:48,736
Those huge strategy layers,

881
00:39:49,177 --> 00:39:51,118
you had to kind of build all the pieces at the same time,

882
00:39:51,198 --> 00:39:52,419
put them all at the game at the same time,

883
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,380
and hope it worked.

884
00:39:54,481 --> 00:39:56,263
This meant something incredibly small

885
00:39:56,443 --> 00:39:57,744
that we could then add on top of,

886
00:39:57,764 --> 00:40:00,126
that we could iterate on and add small pieces

887
00:40:00,246 --> 00:40:01,487
and kind of figure it out as we went,

888
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:03,028
which we were much better at doing.

889
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,362
And so from there, we could build it up into something you'd recognize today.

890
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:11,472
The first thing that we wanted to do was to keep that map visual.

891
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:14,932
I think having an actual physical place is very important.

892
00:40:15,153 --> 00:40:18,013
It helps you kind of survive in the world and exist in the world

893
00:40:18,153 --> 00:40:19,634
and care about the people you're trying to help.

894
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:22,514
And so we quickly put a map back in the game.

895
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:26,075
Though it is ultimately just a thin veneer for a mission list,

896
00:40:26,395 --> 00:40:29,016
you can like on the final version or close to the final version,

897
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:31,857
it's just three missions here that you could select from.

898
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:36,238
And that's no different than the list is just on a map now instead of on a list.

899
00:40:38,222 --> 00:40:40,564
We wanted to make sure we could keep the choices interesting,

900
00:40:40,644 --> 00:40:42,425
because as I had said, we basically

901
00:40:42,465 --> 00:40:45,147
wanted to cut the game down to just that one interesting

902
00:40:45,187 --> 00:40:46,227
choice between missions.

903
00:40:46,808 --> 00:40:48,469
And so the question became, how do you

904
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:50,230
make that one choice interesting?

905
00:40:51,731 --> 00:40:54,013
We experimented a lot with different rewards.

906
00:40:54,893 --> 00:40:57,815
We had this asset system, which both of these versions

907
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,457
of the game had, where battles would give you

908
00:41:00,577 --> 00:41:02,338
these buildings, and those buildings

909
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:03,819
would affect the combat in different ways.

910
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:06,160
like increasing your mech health,

911
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,382
increasing your reactor cores, that sort of thing.

912
00:41:09,503 --> 00:41:10,864
It didn't work for a number of reasons,

913
00:41:11,524 --> 00:41:12,985
one of which was it was really hard to balance

914
00:41:13,045 --> 00:41:16,167
to make it so one of them wasn't the obvious choice.

915
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:18,369
We hate it when you're presented with three things

916
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:20,430
and one of them is 10 times better than the rest

917
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,511
and so you just always pick that

918
00:41:21,531 --> 00:41:22,952
because that's not an interesting choice.

919
00:41:23,472 --> 00:41:26,154
and creating assets that would blend with the combat,

920
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:29,616
which at this point we understood was very tightly balanced

921
00:41:29,736 --> 00:41:32,237
and couldn't really take a lot of poking before it fell over

922
00:41:32,677 --> 00:41:33,978
and that's what these assets did.

923
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:36,459
These building effects would just topple the game

924
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,520
if you poked it too much.

925
00:41:40,021 --> 00:41:41,522
We also needed to worry about how to pace the game,

926
00:41:41,802 --> 00:41:43,423
which is an excellent place to find ourselves

927
00:41:43,443 --> 00:41:44,824
because that meant we were finally thinking,

928
00:41:44,844 --> 00:41:46,345
oh wait, this is a functioning game,

929
00:41:46,745 --> 00:41:49,266
how can we flesh it out, how long is it going to be?

930
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:52,462
and we need to worry about how hard to make the game.

931
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:53,283
Same idea.

932
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:56,004
So this stuff kind of lays down to our final touches.

933
00:41:56,565 --> 00:41:58,186
And I'm going to talk a little bit

934
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,887
about these final touches in the last couple slides here

935
00:42:01,007 --> 00:42:01,948
before closing out the talk.

936
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,650
The resource design...

937
00:42:09,646 --> 00:42:12,809
was we moved it down to something very simplistic.

938
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:15,932
That those early assets were so complex

939
00:42:16,332 --> 00:42:17,694
that we needed something that you could

940
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:19,615
more quickly get a grasp on.

941
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:21,758
So we moved it down to just three resources.

942
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,883
Just your power, your upgrade cores, and basically money.

943
00:42:28,956 --> 00:42:30,977
the difficulty could be shown by the resource count.

944
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,177
So just three resources would mean hard

945
00:42:33,257 --> 00:42:34,658
and one resource would mean easy.

946
00:42:35,298 --> 00:42:37,359
And the map design gave you an option to plan ahead.

947
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:39,940
And all this together combined into

948
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,061
that brilliant single screen UI

949
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,401
that we would love to chase down,

950
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:44,681
that we love to get into the game.

951
00:42:45,082 --> 00:42:47,402
It kind of mirrors the combat in that sense

952
00:42:47,522 --> 00:42:49,183
that you can, without checking tool tips

953
00:42:49,223 --> 00:42:50,604
or whatever reward does,

954
00:42:51,164 --> 00:42:53,745
you can see instantly what your choices are.

955
00:42:54,185 --> 00:42:56,426
and you can make a reasonably informed decision

956
00:42:56,966 --> 00:42:58,587
taking into account what you need right now

957
00:42:58,767 --> 00:42:59,928
and what you need in the future.

958
00:43:00,388 --> 00:43:02,089
It's not complicated, it's not fancy,

959
00:43:02,429 --> 00:43:03,549
but it's totally functional,

960
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:04,990
which is all we really needed

961
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,311
from the strategy layer at this point.

962
00:43:08,432 --> 00:43:09,733
From a game length perspective,

963
00:43:10,893 --> 00:43:13,915
like we did with FTL, our approach tends to be just

964
00:43:14,155 --> 00:43:15,936
where is the upgrade curve gonna lead us,

965
00:43:17,296 --> 00:43:19,257
how quickly do we wanna dole out upgrades,

966
00:43:19,577 --> 00:43:21,058
and what is the final point

967
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,379
we want you to get to with upgrades.

968
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:28,795
But with End of the Breach, we found that there were multiple options, and Justin and

969
00:43:28,835 --> 00:43:31,738
I didn't really necessarily agree on which one was the best option.

970
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:34,560
I liked the two island game length.

971
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,222
It meant that mechs were going to be upgraded.

972
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,791
A little bit, you'd get one or two secondary weapons.

973
00:43:41,091 --> 00:43:42,913
You weren't gonna be able to cap out your upgrades.

974
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,614
You're gonna play the game in just like an hour,

975
00:43:44,634 --> 00:43:46,255
hour and a half, so it was a lot more

976
00:43:46,275 --> 00:43:47,416
of a single sitting game.

977
00:43:48,256 --> 00:43:50,578
And I really enjoyed that tighter, smaller experience.

978
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:53,360
Justin really enjoyed the four island,

979
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,022
more epic experience, where every mech

980
00:43:56,142 --> 00:43:59,505
gets a secondary weapon, which ups the complexity a ton

981
00:43:59,685 --> 00:44:02,207
when you have a lot more options per turn

982
00:44:02,527 --> 00:44:03,208
of what you could do.

983
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,611
and it really adds a lot of overhead to the game,

984
00:44:05,931 --> 00:44:07,033
which is cool.

985
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:09,156
Justin loves it, I'm sure a lot of players love it as well,

986
00:44:09,597 --> 00:44:11,360
but it wasn't necessarily what I was going for.

987
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,943
And so with the sense that we didn't really have

988
00:44:13,983 --> 00:44:16,447
a constraint where it led us to a specific answer,

989
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,469
we tried something weird,

990
00:44:17,729 --> 00:44:19,752
which was to do this dynamic difficulty length.

991
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:23,332
dynamic, not difficult to length, but length of the game.

992
00:44:23,852 --> 00:44:26,172
So the idea being that once you finish two islands,

993
00:44:26,213 --> 00:44:28,273
you could choose to end the game at any point.

994
00:44:29,173 --> 00:44:31,014
Justin and I intended this decision

995
00:44:31,254 --> 00:44:32,675
to be purely player choice.

996
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:35,896
It was supposed to be, oh crap, I've gotta go eat dinner,

997
00:44:36,036 --> 00:44:36,836
I'm gonna end the game.

998
00:44:37,376 --> 00:44:40,817
Or oh, I'm bored of this, I'm not having a super lot of fun,

999
00:44:40,837 --> 00:44:41,577
so I'm gonna end the game.

1000
00:44:41,738 --> 00:44:43,978
Or wow, I love this squad, my weapons are so much fun,

1001
00:44:43,998 --> 00:44:45,939
I never want this to end, so I'm gonna do four islands.

1002
00:44:46,699 --> 00:44:50,125
But when you bury that choice in the middle of a strategy game like this,

1003
00:44:50,325 --> 00:44:54,152
it gets obfuscated and the player doesn't expect it to be just a personal choice.

1004
00:44:55,815 --> 00:44:58,136
I see a lot on the forums, on the subreddit and stuff,

1005
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,996
of people talking about when's the ideal time

1006
00:45:00,016 --> 00:45:00,576
to end the game?

1007
00:45:01,016 --> 00:45:02,177
When should you attack the boss?

1008
00:45:02,237 --> 00:45:02,897
When is it harder?

1009
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:03,637
When is it easier?

1010
00:45:03,997 --> 00:45:06,077
Where's the strategy to this decision?

1011
00:45:06,097 --> 00:45:08,198
Because every other decision involves strategy.

1012
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,938
But since we scale the boss to always be

1013
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,739
the same difficulty regardless of when you end the game,

1014
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:15,139
that was never part of it.

1015
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:17,520
So it just ended up kind of confusing a lot of people.

1016
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,380
For some people, they really enjoyed it,

1017
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,020
but there was enough confusion and enough...

1018
00:45:21,921 --> 00:45:27,188
Oddity to the design that I'm not 100% sure I would chase it down again as a great way to do it

1019
00:45:27,629 --> 00:45:29,332
But it was a fun experiment and it was something that

1020
00:45:30,413 --> 00:45:31,195
Was cool to put in the game

1021
00:45:34,342 --> 00:45:39,525
When it comes to difficulty, I could probably ramble for like a half hour about Into the Breach difficulty,

1022
00:45:39,566 --> 00:45:45,070
probably longer, but I don't have a ton of time, so I kind of have to condense this down into what I think the most interesting parts about it are.

1023
00:45:46,731 --> 00:45:52,835
Inherently, Into the Breach is a strategy game, or a puzzle game, that's masquerading as a strategy game.

1024
00:45:53,776 --> 00:45:57,318
it creates these little micro puzzles that you have to solve

1025
00:45:57,858 --> 00:46:02,981
and the result of that is that too hard becomes unsolvable instead of just hard.

1026
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:10,065
You end up with a situation that as soon as you have six monsters attacking six locations

1027
00:46:10,085 --> 00:46:13,927
and you've only got three mechs, then it's not that it's hard, it's that you just can't stop that.

1028
00:46:14,447 --> 00:46:17,149
And if every turn that was happening you're not feeling like it's hard,

1029
00:46:17,169 --> 00:46:18,650
you're just feeling like this game is unfair.

1030
00:46:19,731 --> 00:46:21,434
and it doesn't really leave a lot of wiggle room

1031
00:46:21,474 --> 00:46:22,256
for what you can do.

1032
00:46:22,797 --> 00:46:26,243
And it really was a threshold that was just very tight

1033
00:46:26,443 --> 00:46:28,367
that as soon as we spawned one too many enemy,

1034
00:46:28,387 --> 00:46:29,368
the whole game broke.

1035
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,993
And so we really had to build up a lot of.

1036
00:46:33,765 --> 00:46:35,306
to balance designs around that,

1037
00:46:35,386 --> 00:46:37,567
on how we spawned enemies and how we designed maps,

1038
00:46:38,408 --> 00:46:40,409
to try to reduce that and to make it as functional

1039
00:46:40,449 --> 00:46:42,750
as it always could so the game would always be solvable.

1040
00:46:43,731 --> 00:46:45,092
And the difficulty ended up being

1041
00:46:45,312 --> 00:46:46,993
very much constrained by the design.

1042
00:46:47,534 --> 00:46:49,655
We did not say, this is how hard

1043
00:46:49,695 --> 00:46:50,676
we want Into the Breach to be.

1044
00:46:51,669 --> 00:46:53,951
Into the Breach said, this is how hard I can be.

1045
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:58,636
And we found the limits on what we felt were the limits

1046
00:46:58,656 --> 00:47:00,958
that the game could do in terms of pushing it

1047
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:04,261
to an upper limit of difficulty and finding a lower limit

1048
00:47:04,361 --> 00:47:06,063
that still kept the game being interesting

1049
00:47:06,403 --> 00:47:08,765
with interesting choices, even for lower skill levels.

1050
00:47:09,887 --> 00:47:12,509
On top of this, Difficulty Into the Breach was weird

1051
00:47:12,649 --> 00:47:13,010
because

1052
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:17,392
Players disagreed hugely on if the game was hard or not.

1053
00:47:17,992 --> 00:47:20,853
We had early Steam reviews that were back to back,

1054
00:47:20,913 --> 00:47:23,174
this game is way too hard, this game is way too easy.

1055
00:47:23,194 --> 00:47:25,415
It just clicked for people in a way

1056
00:47:25,435 --> 00:47:26,415
that it didn't click for others.

1057
00:47:26,936 --> 00:47:28,676
When you're asking, it's like when we were doing

1058
00:47:28,696 --> 00:47:31,477
the early play tests and people didn't wanna get

1059
00:47:31,517 --> 00:47:33,778
their units hurt, they didn't wanna defend the buildings,

1060
00:47:33,818 --> 00:47:35,619
they're so used to their units

1061
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:36,580
being the most important thing.

1062
00:47:37,801 --> 00:47:40,204
that a lot of the decisions we're asking players to make

1063
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:43,088
are not necessarily intuitive in what they're used to doing.

1064
00:47:43,468 --> 00:47:45,311
And maybe we did a bad job teaching that

1065
00:47:45,391 --> 00:47:46,492
and explaining it ahead of time

1066
00:47:46,532 --> 00:47:48,235
so they would be able to click with them faster.

1067
00:47:48,715 --> 00:47:50,538
But for some players it took a lot longer to click

1068
00:47:50,578 --> 00:47:51,879
and so the game was a lot harder for them.

1069
00:47:53,064 --> 00:47:58,390
I think the end result for End of the Breach is a good chunk easier than FTL, but the really

1070
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:01,414
cool thing is that I think that it's still super fun.

1071
00:48:01,995 --> 00:48:06,660
And if you told me ten years ago that an easy game could be super fun, my naive early designer

1072
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,463
self would have said that's silly, I love hard games.

1073
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:13,995
But I think the puzzle game design inherently benefits kind of easy play.

1074
00:48:14,255 --> 00:48:18,961
It's really satisfying to do a crossword puzzle or any sort of puzzle that you're good at

1075
00:48:19,461 --> 00:48:23,046
and to find solutions and just kind of mellow out and solve the game and kind of just enjoy

1076
00:48:23,086 --> 00:48:26,710
yourself in a way that you couldn't do with FTL and that I think FTL...

1077
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:32,273
as a contrast, when it was too easy it was dull, because you didn't necessarily feel smart, you

1078
00:48:32,293 --> 00:48:36,235
just felt like you were being pandered to, or you were not making interesting choices anymore.

1079
00:48:36,935 --> 00:48:41,937
And so it's just another great example for how these games define themselves more than

1080
00:48:41,957 --> 00:48:45,318
it's anything that we're actually doing, and so it's a case that we need to chase that down.

1081
00:48:47,364 --> 00:48:51,146
So on a whole, had we been better at a lot of the ideas

1082
00:48:51,206 --> 00:48:54,208
that I'm espousing here when it comes to following designs

1083
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:56,149
and letting the designs constrain the game,

1084
00:48:56,589 --> 00:48:58,931
we probably wouldn't have taken four years

1085
00:48:58,971 --> 00:48:59,691
to make this game.

1086
00:49:00,411 --> 00:49:02,773
I think that that was not an inherent necessity.

1087
00:49:03,093 --> 00:49:05,974
It was just us being naive in our approaches.

1088
00:49:06,475 --> 00:49:08,216
Some of the key things we could have done better

1089
00:49:08,616 --> 00:49:11,237
is we could have been faster at cutting bad design

1090
00:49:11,317 --> 00:49:13,659
and realizing faster that cutting design was really fun.

1091
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:16,560
I love the feeling of getting rid of bad design now.

1092
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,082
I love the freedom it gives you when you finally get rid of that horrible thing that you've

1093
00:49:21,102 --> 00:49:22,462
been stressing about for the last year.

1094
00:49:23,022 --> 00:49:27,784
It's frustrating to lose a year of work, but it's so freeing to move on to the next thing

1095
00:49:27,824 --> 00:49:29,224
and think maybe it'll be better this time.

1096
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:33,506
We need to realize sooner that we're stuck in a genre.

1097
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:37,848
It happened with the focusing on buildings instead of mechs.

1098
00:49:38,288 --> 00:49:40,389
It happened in the strategy layer constantly.

1099
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:43,271
That we're saying, we want this in the game,

1100
00:49:43,471 --> 00:49:45,572
we like this mechanic, so we're gonna keep it here,

1101
00:49:45,612 --> 00:49:47,613
gosh darn it, and this is exactly what we need.

1102
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:50,055
But the game was saying, no, no, no, that's terrible,

1103
00:49:50,075 --> 00:49:50,795
this doesn't work.

1104
00:49:51,115 --> 00:49:52,596
And we weren't seeing that fast enough.

1105
00:49:52,896 --> 00:49:55,077
We needed to follow those natural design constraints.

1106
00:49:55,097 --> 00:49:57,959
We needed to see what the game was imposing on us

1107
00:49:58,019 --> 00:50:00,240
instead of us trying to impose nonsense on the game.

1108
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:06,931
and ultimately the importance of that there can be mediocre design in the game.

1109
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:13,473
We went into The Breach with so much time and the luxury to really explore design after

1110
00:50:13,533 --> 00:50:19,214
FTL that we were overly perfectionist in our approach, that we needed every mechanic and

1111
00:50:19,334 --> 00:50:24,776
every element to be that perfectly balanced, elegant thing.

1112
00:50:25,516 --> 00:50:27,619
And that doesn't work, or from our experience,

1113
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:28,961
maybe better designers could do it.

1114
00:50:29,442 --> 00:50:32,486
But we found that, as I've covered a couple of them here,

1115
00:50:32,847 --> 00:50:35,611
there are cases where the design leads to this ugly wart

1116
00:50:35,671 --> 00:50:37,614
that sits on the side, and that's okay.

1117
00:50:37,674 --> 00:50:39,176
The strategy layer was not what we wanted to make.

1118
00:50:39,316 --> 00:50:41,119
I still don't think the strategy layer is brilliant.

1119
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:45,921
but it does a completely sufficient job at tying together the combat, which is interesting.

1120
00:50:46,381 --> 00:50:51,103
And letting the combat thrive and find its place and really dominate the play experience is fine.

1121
00:50:51,283 --> 00:50:55,344
Letting the strategy large get out of its way, do the necessary job but mostly not annoy you,

1122
00:50:55,664 --> 00:50:58,645
is all it needed to do. And that's what we ended up with.

1123
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,246
Thank you very much for listening.

1124
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,756
I hope some of it is helpful.

1125
00:51:18,457 --> 00:51:20,582
I know that not everyone has the same approach to things,

1126
00:51:20,682 --> 00:51:22,386
but I think that our journey maybe could,

1127
00:51:22,967 --> 00:51:24,791
I would hope, provide something useful to everyone.

1128
00:51:25,091 --> 00:51:26,715
If you have questions, you're good to go.

1129
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,041
I've played about 80 hours of this game.

1130
00:51:30,101 --> 00:51:30,781
It's awesome.

1131
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:31,561
Thank you.

1132
00:51:31,661 --> 00:51:36,583
I had to take it off my computer because I have to do work sometimes.

1133
00:51:38,383 --> 00:51:39,103
One question.

1134
00:51:40,724 --> 00:51:47,246
When you are at that last bar of grid power and you're about to lose the game, it does

1135
00:51:47,346 --> 00:51:53,088
seem like the buildings resist a lot more than the alleged percentage.

1136
00:51:53,108 --> 00:51:53,868
It does not.

1137
00:51:54,409 --> 00:51:54,550
No.

1138
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,031
It does not.

1139
00:51:55,051 --> 00:51:55,453
It does not.

1140
00:51:55,533 --> 00:51:58,643
No, we have personally, from a design point of view.

1141
00:52:00,586 --> 00:52:04,347
I don't like changing the game, I don't like doing those mechanics, I like a game to be

1142
00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:05,287
a static experience.

1143
00:52:05,707 --> 00:52:09,868
A lot of the design inspiration for me comes from board games and the like, which are inherently

1144
00:52:09,908 --> 00:52:14,289
very static experiences that don't accommodate to the player, and I like making design just

1145
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:19,071
from a personal standpoint of we don't accommodate to the player, we don't try to artificially

1146
00:52:19,131 --> 00:52:21,171
create those exciting saves.

1147
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:24,312
Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just from our approach that's what we

1148
00:52:24,332 --> 00:52:24,512
do.

1149
00:52:24,872 --> 00:52:26,433
The very few times we do anything...

1150
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:30,676
that accommodates the player and into the breach is spawn mates and enemies.

1151
00:52:31,196 --> 00:52:34,358
If there are too few enemies, then we will bump the spawn, and if there are too many

1152
00:52:34,398 --> 00:52:35,519
enemies we drop the spawn.

1153
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,043
Because I talked about difficulty, it makes a huge difference to how functional the game

1154
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:41,724
is and how many enemies are on the board.

1155
00:52:42,144 --> 00:52:45,347
And so that's one of the only moments where we check the player progress or check the

1156
00:52:45,387 --> 00:52:47,068
board state and change the game based on that.

1157
00:52:47,108 --> 00:52:50,771
So is that based on there are going to be a certain number of opponents throughout the

1158
00:52:50,811 --> 00:52:51,252
thing, or is it...

1159
00:52:52,012 --> 00:52:53,513
It's per turn.

1160
00:52:53,533 --> 00:52:54,394
It's per turn.

1161
00:52:54,534 --> 00:52:55,155
Thank you.

1162
00:52:57,113 --> 00:52:58,574
Great talk, and amazing game.

1163
00:52:58,714 --> 00:52:59,815
Thank you.

1164
00:53:00,015 --> 00:53:02,957
So in the game, you have this chance where there's

1165
00:53:03,017 --> 00:53:05,919
a debris that drops, and you have a random number of turns

1166
00:53:05,959 --> 00:53:07,640
where you can come and go and pick it up.

1167
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,262
What was the reason to add that feature in the game?

1168
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:14,004
The time pod that shoots down, and you collect that?

1169
00:53:14,205 --> 00:53:14,365
Yes.

1170
00:53:16,537 --> 00:53:20,160
I'd have trouble remembering the exact set of things that led us there.

1171
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,441
Part of it was thematic.

1172
00:53:21,701 --> 00:53:25,224
We liked this idea that we were running with this time travel mechanic where people were

1173
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:29,267
going back in time and you were doing this loop and all the pilots were supposed to be

1174
00:53:29,287 --> 00:53:29,947
time travelers.

1175
00:53:30,287 --> 00:53:34,451
So we needed some way to thematically introduce time travelers into the game and it just felt

1176
00:53:34,531 --> 00:53:37,753
really epic and cool to have this pod flying down and crashing into the earth.

1177
00:53:38,654 --> 00:53:40,495
And then on top of that, it fit the other constraints

1178
00:53:40,535 --> 00:53:42,937
quite nicely in that it follows the core

1179
00:53:42,957 --> 00:53:44,258
design of defend things.

1180
00:53:44,818 --> 00:53:46,579
It added something else to the board to defend.

1181
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,142
And so it fit the mechanics along with the theme in a way

1182
00:53:50,182 --> 00:53:51,243
that felt quite pleasant.

1183
00:53:51,703 --> 00:53:53,885
I think we had the time pod pretty early, and we liked it

1184
00:53:53,905 --> 00:53:55,646
from the beginning, and it didn't really change all the

1185
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:55,986
way through.

1186
00:53:59,324 --> 00:54:01,527
Hi, thanks for the game, thanks for the talk.

1187
00:54:01,547 --> 00:54:02,568
Thank you.

1188
00:54:02,788 --> 00:54:05,271
So you mentioned that things like the grappling hook

1189
00:54:05,692 --> 00:54:08,976
and the teleportation spell were very fun for players

1190
00:54:09,036 --> 00:54:10,898
and make you feel smart and all that kind of stuff.

1191
00:54:11,899 --> 00:54:13,602
I'm wondering if you ever experimented

1192
00:54:13,682 --> 00:54:16,746
with having the starting mechs be more like the steel Judoka?

1193
00:54:17,826 --> 00:54:26,051
where it's like their primary attack is more of a movement and enemy manipulation attack

1194
00:54:26,131 --> 00:54:31,974
than being... because the initial set is more like direct damage and the enemy movement is kind of secondary.

1195
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:40,441
I'm based on the early experiments the if anything that first starting squad was still too complex for a lot of players

1196
00:54:40,982 --> 00:54:43,425
We especially the artillery weapon which would

1197
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:47,511
You need to shoot next to an enemy to push it instead of shoot at the enemy

1198
00:54:47,971 --> 00:54:50,313
and all games have always trained us to shoot at the enemy.

1199
00:54:50,674 --> 00:54:52,235
And so putting people in front of that and saying,

1200
00:54:52,295 --> 00:54:55,018
do something like indirect fire, do something like manipulating them,

1201
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:56,039
was a lot to ask.

1202
00:54:56,479 --> 00:54:58,921
And so we were focused more on how do we just

1203
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:02,465
introduce something like a push mechanic in a very natural way

1204
00:55:02,705 --> 00:55:03,966
so they could get comfortable with it.

1205
00:55:04,387 --> 00:55:06,909
And even then, I'll see Steel Dukku have a huge, um,

1206
00:55:09,972 --> 00:55:11,393
divide in how much players like it.

1207
00:55:11,613 --> 00:55:13,854
And there are players, perhaps if the game clicked more,

1208
00:55:13,874 --> 00:55:14,534
that they really enjoy it,

1209
00:55:14,554 --> 00:55:16,075
because they get to screw around with those mechanics more.

1210
00:55:16,475 --> 00:55:17,896
And then there are players that are like,

1211
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:18,837
how on earth do you do this?

1212
00:55:19,397 --> 00:55:20,398
And so it was important,

1213
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:21,478
especially for the starting squad,

1214
00:55:21,498 --> 00:55:22,999
to have something that everybody could try.

1215
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,140
That makes sense.

1216
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,200
I love the steel jujitsu.

1217
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:25,661
Thank you.

1218
00:55:26,921 --> 00:55:27,842
Thank you for the talk.

1219
00:55:28,122 --> 00:55:31,284
When you, early on, decided how to move your units,

1220
00:55:32,885 --> 00:55:35,006
and you said you were inspired by Civ,

1221
00:55:35,046 --> 00:55:37,047
did you consider Hexagon?

1222
00:55:38,452 --> 00:55:39,112
Oh, no.

1223
00:55:41,295 --> 00:55:46,541
We started with a grid from the very beginning, and genuinely my only reason for that was

1224
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:51,767
that the first prototype that you saw in the beginning was like a city, and the idea was

1225
00:55:51,787 --> 00:55:55,351
that there were city blocks, and it was a grid-based system like a city, and that was

1226
00:55:55,411 --> 00:55:58,134
where I was coming from when I put that together.

1227
00:55:58,985 --> 00:56:01,967
And I know that's an arbitrary thing, it's really silly,

1228
00:56:02,087 --> 00:56:04,388
and I think once you started programming it,

1229
00:56:04,889 --> 00:56:06,890
changing it to hex would have been a huge change

1230
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,451
that fundamentally changed all the design

1231
00:56:08,471 --> 00:56:09,312
that we'd done up at that point.

1232
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:11,073
And so even though we ran away from cities

1233
00:56:11,113 --> 00:56:12,594
and ended up on larger fields,

1234
00:56:13,494 --> 00:56:16,056
the grid, the square grid still felt more natural.

1235
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:18,858
I think it's also great for the pushing mechanics, though,

1236
00:56:18,898 --> 00:56:20,459
is that it's a lot more intuitive to push

1237
00:56:20,759 --> 00:56:22,320
and be aligned on a grid system,

1238
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:26,563
but that's a happy accident, not like an intentional design.

1239
00:56:29,547 --> 00:56:32,431
Thank you for the talk and congratulations on winning last night.

1240
00:56:32,651 --> 00:56:33,071
Oh, thank you.

1241
00:56:33,972 --> 00:56:38,237
I was wondering if you could speak a bit about how the telegraph attacks influenced your

1242
00:56:38,317 --> 00:56:40,960
enemy AI design and like how the AI behave.

1243
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:48,215
The AI is very simple, where it's just every enemy acts entirely independently.

1244
00:56:48,615 --> 00:56:52,498
There's no planning between them to make sure they're covering a certain amount of buildings or units.

1245
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:54,899
Every turn they just look at everywhere they can attack.

1246
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:59,542
They take the best options and the second best options and they randomize between them.

1247
00:57:00,382 --> 00:57:01,423
And it's as simple as that.

1248
00:57:02,163 --> 00:57:06,466
And do you... what about the spawn points of the new enemies?

1249
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,447
Completely randomized within a spawn zone.

1250
00:57:08,908 --> 00:57:09,108
Wow.

1251
00:57:09,889 --> 00:57:12,850
We always, I always, as a solo programmer,

1252
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:14,850
because the whole game was programmed by just myself,

1253
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:16,570
and a small design team,

1254
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:19,951
I always pick the absolute simplest implementation first.

1255
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:23,032
So I do something just stupid simple to put it in the game.

1256
00:57:23,452 --> 00:57:26,252
And then if stupid simple works, I say great and move on.

1257
00:57:28,272 --> 00:57:31,133
So is it that you have a few different map types

1258
00:57:31,253 --> 00:57:33,893
and you have spawn mapped out for them?

1259
00:57:35,014 --> 00:57:37,094
Yeah, all the maps are actually pre-made.

1260
00:57:38,285 --> 00:57:43,009
Yeah, it doesn't look like that, and a lot of players don't realize that because of the simplicity of making maps.

1261
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:47,413
It takes two seconds to make them. I mean, not two seconds. Justin did most of the work, so for me it was super easy.

1262
00:57:48,914 --> 00:57:53,278
But they are all pre-made, and we have like 200 or something in the game.

1263
00:57:53,979 --> 00:57:56,500
And they had to be, it pre-made made it a lot easier

1264
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:58,121
because we could control stuff like,

1265
00:57:58,821 --> 00:58:01,723
a bad map could really influence the difficulty

1266
00:58:01,843 --> 00:58:02,984
in ways that were horrible.

1267
00:58:03,364 --> 00:58:04,664
And so we needed to control it tightly.

1268
00:58:05,085 --> 00:58:06,986
And again, it goes back to stupid simple

1269
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,527
and that it was easier to make the maps

1270
00:58:08,627 --> 00:58:11,688
rather than me design some algorithm to generate the maps.

1271
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:12,629
Thank you so much.

1272
00:58:19,545 --> 00:58:23,947
This will be the last question, but if you want to do more questions, I can go to the wrap-up room.

1273
00:58:24,147 --> 00:58:25,468
Is there a specific room I should go to?

1274
00:58:27,609 --> 00:58:27,889
Thank you.

1275
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:30,431
Go for it.

1276
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:31,471
Great game, great talk.

1277
00:58:31,892 --> 00:58:33,052
I'm curious about your process.

1278
00:58:33,312 --> 00:58:36,654
Like, you have multiple iterations of mechanics, multiple implementation.

1279
00:58:37,115 --> 00:58:40,857
So what, how do you get to the point where you suddenly realize it needs to change?

1280
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,658
Is it playtesting? Is it, your mindset is self-critique?

1281
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:44,639
How do you approach that?

1282
00:58:46,071 --> 00:58:49,852
It depends on the situation and there was a lot of play testing when it came to like

1283
00:58:50,292 --> 00:58:53,753
Teaching the game and seeing what mechanics would work based on just raw usability

1284
00:58:54,594 --> 00:58:58,555
A lot of the earlier decisions is just in my play testing a lot on our own

1285
00:58:58,915 --> 00:59:04,457
It's one of the reasons we like procedural gameplay and that we can surprise ourselves and really test the game against ourselves quite easily

1286
00:59:04,918 --> 00:59:09,940
And it there comes down to just a lot of intuition and we can tell this mechanics working this mechanic

1287
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,561
We try to balance against it and I'm sorry. I don't have a great answer for it, but

1288
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:16,694
But it's with a lot goes into it.

1289
00:59:17,417 --> 00:59:17,618
Yeah.

1290
00:59:17,939 --> 00:59:18,180
Thank you.
