1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,946
going to go ahead and get going here. Welcome, everyone. Today we're going to talk about our

2
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:18,016
company's failure at trying to get a competitive fighting game publishing label going. Just

3
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:21,480
from the premise there, I'm sure you already know some answers yourself. Let's get going.

4
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:29,194
If you're not familiar with myself or iron galaxy, I started iron galaxy in 2008. I was at

5
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:34,881
Midway as a studio tech director before that. We ended up falling kind of backwards into

6
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,946
doing a bunch of fighting games. And we were doing a bunch of fighting games and we were

7
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:43,388
We started off doing a lot of tech outsourcing, that sort of stuff, and then we kind of

8
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:49,049
worked with Capcom on three really kind of well received ports of classics like Street Fighter

9
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:53,790
3, Third Strike, Street Fighter 3, Third Strike Online Edition, Darkstalkers Resurrection,

10
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:59,052
Marvel vs. Capcom Origins, and then kind of parlayed that reputation from doing those kind

11
00:00:59,072 --> 00:01:05,433
of cool ports into years later taking over Killer Instinct from Double Helix when Amazon

12
00:01:05,453 --> 00:01:07,354
bought them. We did Killer Instinct Seasons 2 and 3.

13
00:01:08,454 --> 00:01:12,459
And that's relevant for this talk because a lot of what we think about when we're getting

14
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,983
this publishing label started is like, who is our audience?

15
00:01:16,063 --> 00:01:16,624
Who knows us?

16
00:01:17,225 --> 00:01:19,747
If you know Iron Galaxy, it's probably from the fighting game stuff we've done.

17
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,710
They're probably fans of ours, right?

18
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:25,514
Also hate windjammers a ton.

19
00:01:26,515 --> 00:01:26,916
Thanks, Pat.

20
00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:35,643
Another thing you might notice from is dive kick. If you're not familiar with dive kick, it's

21
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:39,625
the first thing we ever self published and it's kind of the foundation for all the stuff we

22
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:45,807
tried later. Dive kick is a really weird story the way it happened. One of my designers, Adam

23
00:01:45,827 --> 00:01:49,629
Hart, was working on some of the Capcom stuff and he came to me and said, hey, I got a

24
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,510
little thing I'm working on on the side with some friends. I want to run it by you, though,

25
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,292
because it might be considered competing with the stuff we're working on here. Okay, let's

26
00:01:57,312 --> 00:02:01,113
hear what is it. He's like, well, it's a game, it's a two button fighting game.

27
00:02:01,614 --> 00:02:02,354
I'm like, two buttons?

28
00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:05,035
He's like, yeah, there's literally not even stick movement.

29
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:05,956
It's just two buttons.

30
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:07,697
One button jumps in the air.

31
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:09,678
The other button does a dive kick.

32
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:11,279
I'm like, okay.

33
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:13,540
He's like, there's two characters.

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,181
They're called Dive and Kick.

35
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,422
I'm like, okay.

36
00:02:17,442 --> 00:02:20,324
He's like, every character is a thousand health.

37
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:22,085
Every dive kick does a million damage.

38
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:24,474
I'm like, okay.

39
00:02:24,494 --> 00:02:26,977
He's like, and it's called dive kick.

40
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:28,798
I'm like, that's the dumbest fucking thing

41
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:29,759
I've ever heard in my life.

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,740
Go make it.

43
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:32,242
Good luck, Godspeed.

44
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:34,144
And I laughed at him behind his back.

45
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:35,503
until I played it.

46
00:02:36,103 --> 00:02:38,044
And then I played Divekick and I instantly fell in love with it.

47
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:40,445
Like I kind of talked about like falling ass backwards

48
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:41,485
and doing a bunch of fighting game stuff,

49
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:42,686
but I've always loved fighting games.

50
00:02:43,086 --> 00:02:44,366
And fighting games are, at their core,

51
00:02:44,386 --> 00:02:45,466
they're about a couple of things.

52
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:46,727
And the spacing, right?

53
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,108
Like knowing how far you are from your opponents,

54
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:50,388
getting yourself a good position

55
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:51,849
where they're in more danger than you are.

56
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:54,390
They're about mind games and reading your opponents,

57
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,230
being able to predict what your opponent's gonna do

58
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,811
and punish them when you predict them correctly.

59
00:02:58,551 --> 00:02:59,932
And Divekick has all that, right?

60
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:01,554
And it also doesn't have like the,

61
00:03:01,794 --> 00:03:03,396
hey, I gotta make a Z with the stick

62
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:05,378
and hit three buttons exactly the same frame

63
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:06,579
to do a Shuroken or whatever.

64
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,523
It's like, it takes all the complexity out of fighting games

65
00:03:10,783 --> 00:03:12,305
but it still keeps the essence of what's great about them.

66
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,108
And so it's like a no-brainer, we should do this at IG.

67
00:03:15,388 --> 00:03:16,589
People know us from fighting game stuff.

68
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,261
So we bought it off of Adam and his team and brought it in-house.

69
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:22,604
And we worked on it for about a year,

70
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:27,231
kind of taking it from that initial prototype to getting it out.

71
00:03:27,532 --> 00:03:29,675
We put it out on PS3, Vita, and Steam.

72
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,502
Yeah, it ended up being a pretty big game.

73
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:38,145
One of the things I was really worried about with Divekick was the value proposition.

74
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,728
Because if you look at Divekick, it looks mental.

75
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:42,469
It's like there's nothing there.

76
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,774
And it would be really hard to convince people how to play it and what it was about and all this.

77
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:48,656
So we wanted to make sure it was loaded up with stuff.

78
00:03:48,676 --> 00:03:50,618
So we had 13 characters in there, a bunch of backgrounds,

79
00:03:51,038 --> 00:03:53,260
really robust online offerings and some single-player stuff.

80
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,162
So this was the first thing we ever published.

81
00:03:59,063 --> 00:04:00,504
We had to do everything ourselves.

82
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:02,526
And we've worked on a bunch of games,

83
00:04:02,606 --> 00:04:05,148
like Microsoft, 2K, WB, whatever, ZeniMax.

84
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:06,269
But this is the first thing

85
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:07,370
Suptanet's been responsible for.

86
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,631
But I've been in a few meetings,

87
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:09,612
how hard could it be, right?

88
00:04:09,672 --> 00:04:11,133
So first thing you do, obviously,

89
00:04:11,173 --> 00:04:12,114
is identify your market.

90
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:12,814
I read that somewhere.

91
00:04:13,595 --> 00:04:17,741
And we decided to target, thank you, we decided to target the FGC.

92
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:19,123
We knew that audience the best.

93
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:22,508
You know, like I said before, if you're in the FGC, you've probably heard of Iron Galaxy,

94
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:23,509
good, bad, or indifferent.

95
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,553
So we wanted to pick that, it's like, okay, that's our core.

96
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:29,738
One of the challenges of showing off Divekick is...

97
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:34,460
Like I said, you look at it and someone explains it to you, it sounds ridiculous.

98
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,022
The only way to get people to like it and see what we saw in it was to take it to all these

99
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:44,443
shows. And we targeted a bunch of FGC shows, we went to Southern California regionals,

100
00:04:44,503 --> 00:04:49,905
Northern California regionals, we went to CEO, we went to UFGT, which is now Combo

101
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:50,825
Breaker in Chicago.

102
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:56,608
We went to Evo. At Evo we ran a 350 person side tournament before the game ever launched,

103
00:04:56,648 --> 00:05:00,730
which is insane. We streamed the whole thing. It was really, really cool.

104
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,431
And sure enough, when we took it places, people loved it.

105
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:05,212
It wasn't that they liked it, they loved it.

106
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:08,573
I remember the first time we showed it anywhere was PAX East in 2013.

107
00:05:08,993 --> 00:05:11,534
Adam showed it at his show, but it was just a prototype.

108
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:12,855
This was the first time we showed the full game.

109
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:16,516
And we'd never done a booth before. We had to figure out how all this stuff works.

110
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:18,537
We're spending all this money and doing all this stuff,

111
00:05:18,557 --> 00:05:20,538
and I was just afraid tumbleweeds would be blowing through the booth.

112
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,862
But by like halfway through the first day, people were lined up six, seven deep, right?

113
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:28,984
And Divekick was the talk of PAX East.

114
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:30,044
Like, it's not hyperbole.

115
00:05:30,084 --> 00:05:31,485
Like, couldn't go anywhere without people like,

116
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:32,646
have you seen this Divekick thing?

117
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:35,068
It was all like really, really well.

118
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:36,669
And it was all really, really easy.

119
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:40,131
And I'm becoming more and more convinced this publishing stuff is super easy.

120
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:49,897
So then the game comes out. It did about 200,000 units across all platforms. We eventually also put it out on PS4 and Xbox One.

121
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:57,401
The game did awful on those platforms. That's more an issue of timing. It was way too late to put a sequel out, or a sequel, to put another port of it out.

122
00:05:57,922 --> 00:05:59,983
And I think people had enough dive kick in their lives at that point, right?

123
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:04,866
Most of the original launch ended up coming from Steam, which really surprised us.

124
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:09,110
Because we're targeting FGC, we're targeting fighting game players,

125
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,032
and if you go to these tournaments we went to,

126
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:14,435
they're playing on PS3, they're playing on Xbox 360,

127
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:17,899
they're not playing, like the weird Mame and Melty Blood kids are playing on PC.

128
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,981
Sorry, Melty Blood fans.

129
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:22,804
But no one's doing it, no one's playing it, right?

130
00:06:23,265 --> 00:06:25,187
And so when people are buying Steam,

131
00:06:25,347 --> 00:06:28,130
we kind of realized we actually targeted the wrong audience.

132
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,274
we should have targeted the people that buy an indie game a month,

133
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:34,677
or they buy a coach co-op game for their friend.

134
00:06:35,898 --> 00:06:38,081
So this was like the first sign that, like,

135
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:41,505
okay, we kind of, you know, Divekick seemed to do okay.

136
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:43,767
It could have been a lot better.

137
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:46,047
And thinking about it more deeply,

138
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:48,469
I'm talking about Divekick a lot

139
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:49,690
because it's kind of the foundation

140
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,411
for everything going forward we did.

141
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:54,073
And you can't understand why we failed

142
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:56,014
with the next rev of games

143
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:57,595
without understanding what Divekick did.

144
00:06:59,277 --> 00:07:00,417
So most people, I think they'd be like,

145
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:02,279
hey, 200,000 units, that's amazing, right?

146
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:05,081
Well, we actually lost a little bit of money with Divekick.

147
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:05,901
Not a ton, but some money.

148
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,613
But we had great platform support.

149
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:10,775
Sony was an amazing partner for us.

150
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,897
They gave us some pub funding from the pub fund thing

151
00:07:13,957 --> 00:07:14,998
so we could do the Vita version,

152
00:07:15,278 --> 00:07:16,799
which is also the best version of Divekick

153
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,620
if you're into that.

154
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,703
They took us to E3 and they gave us an hour stream

155
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:23,605
where they set up a press versus press tournament.

156
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,146
They had Dr. Scholl as one of the characters from the game.

157
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,408
They had cosplay they paid someone to come in and do.

158
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,370
Sony was an amazing partner for Divekick in a lot of ways.

159
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,032
Really great reaction to live events.

160
00:07:33,532 --> 00:07:34,893
Everywhere we brought it, it killed.

161
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:36,234
It just destroyed, right?

162
00:07:37,314 --> 00:07:38,715
good press and enthusiast following.

163
00:07:39,315 --> 00:07:40,755
Like, it was really weird,

164
00:07:40,775 --> 00:07:42,556
like whenever we talked about Divekick,

165
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:43,996
people would write articles about it.

166
00:07:44,576 --> 00:07:46,116
Like, if I wanted to tell this story

167
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:47,957
of how Adam tricked me into buying Divekick,

168
00:07:48,497 --> 00:07:49,977
like people would write about it every time.

169
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:52,478
We put a trailer out, they'd post on their website,

170
00:07:52,518 --> 00:07:54,058
it'd go on Polygon, it would go on Giant Bomb,

171
00:07:54,078 --> 00:07:56,839
it would go on IGN, and we didn't even have to email them.

172
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,000
They just would see the trailer and put it up, right?

173
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,720
Again, it's all super, super easy.

174
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:03,154
But how do we end up losing money given that?

175
00:08:03,574 --> 00:08:05,115
Clearly we ship too much of a game.

176
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:08,796
I think, I don't know how many of you are split like IndieDev

177
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:10,157
or like big studios like ours.

178
00:08:10,277 --> 00:08:12,198
We have 120 people at the Iron Galaxy, right?

179
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:14,419
And one of the jokes I like to make is like,

180
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:16,639
someone can't like drop a pencil and pick it up

181
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:18,520
without costing me $10,000, right?

182
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,741
It's like nothing is cheap at Iron Galaxy.

183
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:22,602
Everything's expensive and it's a huge pain in my ass.

184
00:08:23,282 --> 00:08:25,503
And when you work on a game like this for a year,

185
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:26,263
it adds up.

186
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:30,607
So, it's pretty clearly, one of the core things I believe about Divekick, we could have done

187
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:35,212
a lot better, even if we ended up being the exact same game, the exact same marketing

188
00:08:35,252 --> 00:08:40,016
plan, if we would have launched with 8 instead of 13, and then put 5 characters out over

189
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:43,980
the next 6 months after launch, we would have had a longer sales window, it would have been

190
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,444
longer and better, we would have made a lot more money just from that one tweak alone.

191
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:51,577
And plus, if the game didn't sell,

192
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,718
then we just could have stopped working on it

193
00:08:52,738 --> 00:08:53,559
and saved more money, right?

194
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:55,320
We marketed the wrong group.

195
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:56,802
Like, if we took the money

196
00:08:57,282 --> 00:09:01,326
going to Northern California regionals, Evo, CEO,

197
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:03,928
and put it towards going to stuff like, you know,

198
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:06,370
Comic-Con or an anime show or whatever,

199
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:07,851
we would have reached the audience

200
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:09,313
that actually ended up buying the game.

201
00:09:09,973 --> 00:09:11,855
And I'm sure we would have sold more units just doing that,

202
00:09:11,915 --> 00:09:14,177
spending the exact same amount we did in a smarter way.

203
00:09:14,658 --> 00:09:15,939
And then we squandered the goodwill with the press.

204
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:20,827
What I know now about publishing and like best practices

205
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:24,609
and handling PR launches and marketing and all this stuff,

206
00:09:25,109 --> 00:09:27,691
like the stuff we did right and a better job at

207
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:28,831
with all these next round of titles,

208
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:32,233
if we would have done the best practices with Divekick,

209
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:34,234
we would have sold a million units.

210
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:35,315
Like I firmly believe that.

211
00:09:35,355 --> 00:09:37,816
Like the problem with Divekick is everything was too easy

212
00:09:37,836 --> 00:09:38,757
and we didn't have to work at it.

213
00:09:38,797 --> 00:09:40,158
So we just thought everything would just kind of work out.

214
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:44,782
That being said, business is always full of failures,

215
00:09:45,442 --> 00:09:47,905
and you're gonna fail a lot when you're running a business.

216
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:51,389
It's about what did you take away from that experience,

217
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,712
and what can you package up going forward

218
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:55,794
to reuse on an ongoing basis.

219
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:57,896
So, we now have a publishing experience.

220
00:09:58,237 --> 00:10:00,379
We know what it's like to submit to the ESRB.

221
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:03,982
We know what it's like to hire an external QA team to check for bugs for you.

222
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:07,525
We know what it's like to deal with Microsoft and Sony and all the weird

223
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:09,687
quirks they have about publishing on their platforms, right?

224
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:12,950
We know what it's like to deal with like the vacuum of information that can be

225
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,393
steam sometimes. Right. Um, and that's super, super valuable stuff.

226
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:17,935
We have a built an audience now,

227
00:10:18,976 --> 00:10:21,318
200,000 people bought dive kick or got tricked into buying it, whatever it is.

228
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,040
Uh, and they love it.

229
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:23,640
And.

230
00:10:24,628 --> 00:10:29,231
They still, like there's message boards that talk about Divekick, the Divekick website, all this stuff.

231
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:34,414
So they're Iron Galaxy fans for life, which is super awesome because that's something we never had before.

232
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,856
A lot of the work we did before is behind the scenes stuff.

233
00:10:37,877 --> 00:10:41,359
Like we help a developer or a publisher ship their game on time.

234
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,660
We do a version of a version of a version of a game.

235
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,702
And it's not super glamorous and it's behind the scenes.

236
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:48,283
But this is the first time it's like, oh fuck, I love Iron Galaxy, this is great.

237
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:48,744
So we had that.

238
00:10:49,704 --> 00:10:51,385
better understanding of the market we have to sell to.

239
00:10:51,425 --> 00:10:52,666
I've talked about this a lot.

240
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:56,188
The one thing I didn't talk about though is with the FGC stuff,

241
00:10:56,228 --> 00:10:58,690
is like, we really, when I say we targeted the FGC,

242
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,031
it just wasn't by spending on events.

243
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,893
We really leaned into like trying to get credibility with them

244
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:05,274
in a way that was kind of dumb.

245
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:08,096
Because it's like, you know the FGC, they got like a reputation,

246
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:10,458
like I love that community and it's filled like with loving.

247
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:14,700
like people that build things, like build groups and friends.

248
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,661
But it's got a reputation for being like really rough around the edges,

249
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:20,163
and it's earned that reputation by and large fairly, right?

250
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:22,104
And so our marketing was like that.

251
00:11:22,124 --> 00:11:24,525
When we talked about the game on streams, we talked about it like that.

252
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:27,826
I'm sure it was off-putting to people that weren't part of that community, right?

253
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:30,108
We found our voice, right?

254
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:31,368
Divekick was the first thing we ever did.

255
00:11:31,388 --> 00:11:32,889
We got to do the trailers like we wanted.

256
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:36,171
We did weird, funny, like infomercial style trailers.

257
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:38,031
We got to do whatever we wanted, and it was fun.

258
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:48,897
Um, yeah. So, we want to take those assets and flip it into a new publishing business, right?

259
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,780
And the core premise for the business is, okay, what did we do wrong on Divekick?

260
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,602
Above and beyond, like, everything else, we probably just spent too much making Divekick.

261
00:11:57,003 --> 00:11:58,564
So how do we get around that with other things?

262
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:01,826
We don't have anything internal we're working on right now that kind of fits the bill.

263
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:07,710
So let's focus on, like, finding other people's games that are competitive, right?

264
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,792
Because, like, again, if you think about who we are as a studio...

265
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:11,952
Our fans play competitive games.

266
00:12:12,053 --> 00:12:12,813
They play fighting games.

267
00:12:12,853 --> 00:12:13,373
We know that.

268
00:12:13,753 --> 00:12:15,153
Let's not try to sell adventure games.

269
00:12:15,173 --> 00:12:17,013
Let's not try to sell first-person shooters

270
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:19,814
because no one that knows us knows anything about us

271
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:20,654
in that context, right?

272
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:23,635
So let's focus on competitive games.

273
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:25,675
Find ones that are near completion

274
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:28,556
and do micro-investments, essentially,

275
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:29,616
in games that are near completion

276
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:33,097
and be an amplification for whatever marketing or stuff

277
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:33,657
they want to do.

278
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:35,637
Sorry.

279
00:12:35,657 --> 00:12:37,217
I was pointing at Tim Rogers.

280
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,078
Oh, Tim.

281
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:45,243
And the execution on that, we had a handset of core rules

282
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:46,303
for games we were going to sign.

283
00:12:46,944 --> 00:12:49,466
Again, find things that you think you can recoup on

284
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:50,166
the first day.

285
00:12:50,506 --> 00:12:53,268
If you think about games that's close to done

286
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:56,110
with micro-investments, say we make a $25,000 investment

287
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,291
in a title.

288
00:12:58,072 --> 00:12:58,812
Say we price it at $15.

289
00:13:00,374 --> 00:13:05,178
If we have to sell 3,000 copies across three platforms on the first day of recoup.

290
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,022
After Divekick, I didn't think there was any way in the world we couldn't do that.

291
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:14,208
Divekick taught me, like, no, if we just do our things and publish the games like we did Divekick,

292
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:18,792
there's no way we do that. It's fall over easy. It's impossible to screw that up.

293
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:20,594
We wanted to offer developers...

294
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:22,637
things other publishers couldn't.

295
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:24,380
Because we're a developer first and foremost

296
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,481
who happens to publish, right?

297
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:29,408
And we could help them figure out how to get through QA,

298
00:13:29,828 --> 00:13:32,132
work on stuff like UI or whatever it is, right?

299
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:35,597
So we also didn't want to do one title.

300
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:38,690
We wanted to build three and we always want to present them together.

301
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,510
The thinking being, I think this is actually one thing we did that was pretty

302
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:46,172
smart. So, uh, you never show just one game in isolation, right?

303
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,892
You show all three are together at all times.

304
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:50,033
So they're associated together in people's minds.

305
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:53,133
Like, uh, they don't see like the gun sport trailer.

306
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:55,954
They see the video ball capsule force and gun sport trailer.

307
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:57,834
So if they buy capsule force and they like it,

308
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,155
or they bought dive kick and they liked it,

309
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:00,975
they're aware of the other three things they can do.

310
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:03,116
And it kind of just use them to amplify each other.

311
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:07,238
And then just do the same marketing and PR stuff we did for Divekick.

312
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:11,459
Take it on the road a lot, show it to people why it's great, do streams, do all this stuff,

313
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,640
and then obviously cash large checks.

314
00:14:16,142 --> 00:14:20,684
This is, if you take away one thing from today's talk, make it Mefford's Law,

315
00:14:20,784 --> 00:14:21,724
first law of game development.

316
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:25,295
Nate Mefford, I started working with in 2005, he's a programmer.

317
00:14:25,796 --> 00:14:27,678
He's without a doubt one of the smartest people I've ever met.

318
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:30,340
And Mefford's first law of game development is,

319
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,842
the worst thing that can happen to a young developer

320
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:33,443
is to work on a successful game,

321
00:14:33,463 --> 00:14:36,025
because you end up thinking you had something to do with it being successful.

322
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:40,970
I just soak it up.

323
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:44,749
And this was Divekick for us, right?

324
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,832
Like Divekick, everything was easy.

325
00:14:47,032 --> 00:14:48,253
Whenever we wanted to talk about Divekick,

326
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:49,094
people would write about it.

327
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,396
People picked up the trailers.

328
00:14:50,676 --> 00:14:53,840
People, like, they wanted to talk about Divekick.

329
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,282
There was an enthusiasm about Divekick.

330
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,524
And we thought it was us.

331
00:14:57,802 --> 00:15:00,743
We didn't, it's not this game that's amazing, right?

332
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:02,925
It's us and this mechanism we're building around it

333
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:04,866
that makes people so interested in it, right?

334
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:07,388
And once you lost focus on that,

335
00:15:07,988 --> 00:15:10,350
it kind of re, it makes you realize

336
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,552
that every mistake you made was avoidable.

337
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:15,033
Let's talk about those now.

338
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:16,213
So,

339
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:20,372
We've got this new, by the way I didn't realize

340
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:22,215
Method's first law of game development applied

341
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,356
until I was writing this deck.

342
00:15:23,837 --> 00:15:26,581
So, recent binding for your boy.

343
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:27,802
I gotta stop doing that.

344
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:29,705
We signed three games.

345
00:15:30,286 --> 00:15:31,547
First one we signed was Capsule Force.

346
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:34,892
It's kind of like got a Nidhogg screen push mechanic to it.

347
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,095
It's got 80s Japanese anime kind of aesthetic to it.

348
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:40,336
It's really cool, I love it.

349
00:15:41,016 --> 00:15:41,857
Gunsport we signed.

350
00:15:41,877 --> 00:15:44,919
That's the first one's by Cloudbit, Eric and Kat.

351
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:46,019
Second one was Gunsport.

352
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,161
It's a Necrosoft with Brandon Sheffield and his crew.

353
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:49,822
And I fricking love Gunsport, right?

354
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:52,204
Like it's basically volleyball with guns, right?

355
00:15:52,224 --> 00:15:54,725
And so instead of like bumping and setting like lame-os,

356
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,607
you're shooting a ball across the net with a gun.

357
00:15:56,627 --> 00:15:57,767
It's like totally cool.

358
00:15:58,288 --> 00:16:00,049
VideoBall, I fell in love with VideoBall

359
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:01,050
as an electronic sport.

360
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:04,472
The way to describe it to people if you've never seen it,

361
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:07,134
like the shorthand that doesn't do it justice

362
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:09,917
is it's like asteroids meet soccer, right?

363
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:13,520
So, assign those all at once,

364
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:16,022
and then we launch the label.

365
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:17,183
I'm trying to get the volume here right.

366
00:16:18,163 --> 00:16:20,665
So, again, we're gonna talk about all these things at once,

367
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,267
and this trailer is kind of the first time

368
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:26,110
we should have realized something we were doing was wrong.

369
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,532
Because when we put out trailers for Divekick,

370
00:16:29,463 --> 00:16:31,885
they'd get picked up, they'd end up on every single website.

371
00:16:31,905 --> 00:16:33,846
We wouldn't even have to tell them that they were out.

372
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:37,809
We put this trailer together, Tim's friend Vito did this,

373
00:16:37,969 --> 00:16:38,689
it's really good.

374
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,751
It's funny in the way we like to be funny.

375
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:42,952
It kind of doesn't take itself too seriously

376
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:44,693
in a way we like to treat ourselves.

377
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:48,255
And it shows off all the games, I think in a flattering way.

378
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:51,377
And no one watched this trailer.

379
00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:55,319
right? Like if you look at the views of it by YouTube, it's super, super low.

380
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:58,759
And we were used to getting like 50 to 100,000 views in a week on dive kick

381
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:02,360
stuff. Right? Um, so this is a video ball.

382
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:08,362
And I knew each game from a different way. I met a capsule force.

383
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:12,282
I got introduced to from the devolver crew, uh, gun sport. I,

384
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:15,283
I think I branded, I saw Brandon playing it somewhere. No, I heard,

385
00:17:15,423 --> 00:17:18,684
I heard Chris Charla talking about gun sport and I had to check it out.

386
00:17:19,064 --> 00:17:21,385
And Tim, when we were showing off a dive kick.

387
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:25,046
Tim was showing off video ball with his publisher for the game at the time.

388
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:27,767
It was Midnight City, and their booth was always by our booth.

389
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:30,248
And so I got to know Tim and hang out with him and play a bunch of video ball.

390
00:17:30,268 --> 00:17:31,028
And I love video ball.

391
00:17:31,588 --> 00:17:36,030
So to be clear, I think all three of those games are super brilliant in their own way.

392
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,751
And that's why we decided to publish them.

393
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:39,631
Okay, this makes a lot of sense.

394
00:17:39,991 --> 00:17:41,752
But again, like, showing them all together like this.

395
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:45,812
We did all this and no one bought the games, right?

396
00:17:45,852 --> 00:17:47,494
We went to shows, we went to PAXs.

397
00:17:47,954 --> 00:17:50,295
We did an amazing booth at this last PAX East.

398
00:17:50,596 --> 00:17:52,477
We had a billion people come through and play these games,

399
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:54,018
but their sales weren't there.

400
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:55,679
What ended up happening, Capsule Force launched first

401
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:59,581
on PS4 and Steam, just never found an audience.

402
00:18:00,142 --> 00:18:01,403
We could never get excitement up for it.

403
00:18:01,443 --> 00:18:02,904
We do a stream for Capsule Force

404
00:18:02,944 --> 00:18:04,445
and 44 people would watch it.

405
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:06,486
You know, and we do streams for Divekick.

406
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,727
Like, this is like amazing.

407
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,088
we do like a character reveal stream for Divekick,

408
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:13,829
we'd have like 1,500 to 4,000 people watching those streams.

409
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,769
That's like more than we get for killer instinct streams,

410
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:16,970
which is like mind-boggling.

411
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,070
Gunsport and Video Ball both end up taking longer

412
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,050
than we originally imagined,

413
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:22,951
and we had to make some tough choices.

414
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,432
Like, we don't have an infinite supply of money

415
00:18:26,692 --> 00:18:28,512
to keep dumping into this publishing venture.

416
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:30,633
It was like a fixed budget thing for us.

417
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:32,273
And so we just had to cut one of them

418
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:33,473
so the other one could live.

419
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:35,414
So we ended up cutting Gunsport.

420
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:37,214
And to be clear, I can't wait to play that game

421
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:38,174
when Brandon gets it done.

422
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:39,315
Like, I think Gunsport's brilliant.

423
00:18:39,915 --> 00:18:48,318
And then we did Videoball. Videoball launched in this last August, I think, on PS4, Xbox One, and Steam, and it still hasn't recouped yet.

424
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:58,141
So, given all that, let's think about the faulty assumptions we made and why everything broke.

425
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:03,783
Obviously, there's Mefferd's first law of game development, right? But there's more kind of specific things about that.

426
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:08,325
We kind of thought that we had an audience of fans.

427
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,143
and it's core to who we are, and they love Killer Instinct,

428
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,486
and they love Divekick, and they're gonna,

429
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:15,968
just because we say these games are good,

430
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,370
they're gonna buy them, right?

431
00:19:18,431 --> 00:19:20,053
It turns out, and this is something I figured out

432
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:22,776
way too late as well, it's not that people like Divekick

433
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:26,721
or Killer Instinct, people like very specific things

434
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:27,802
about the games they play.

435
00:19:29,423 --> 00:19:31,245
Some people like the sensei quotes from Divekick.

436
00:19:31,786 --> 00:19:34,448
Some people like that when Mr. N runs backwards, he squeals.

437
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:37,251
In Killer Instinct, some people like the shadow system

438
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,232
or whatever it is, right?

439
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:40,475
And if you're giving them an offering

440
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:42,937
that doesn't have those very specific things in it,

441
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:43,658
they won't care.

442
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:45,220
They don't give a shit about it, right?

443
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,903
So it's about really understanding that the games you make

444
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:51,666
and you pour your heart and soul into when you publish,

445
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:53,606
what do people actually like about them?

446
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:55,707
You need to have those conversations with your consumers.

447
00:19:56,207 --> 00:19:58,368
So if you're thinking about leveraging them later,

448
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:00,348
selling more things to them down the road,

449
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:02,209
you know exactly what you're selling to them, right?

450
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,150
And you can't get, like you cannot get too micro

451
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,530
with that discussion.

452
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,751
Like, there's no level of detail that's insignificant

453
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:11,052
when you're talking about that aspect of it.

454
00:20:12,257 --> 00:20:15,280
So timelines and budgets of the game would be small and predictable.

455
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,225
This is literally the dumbest thing I've ever done. So, uh,

456
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:24,292
and I've had some doozies. I, we're a game developer, right? And if you tell me,

457
00:20:24,772 --> 00:20:25,693
Hey, here's an idea.

458
00:20:26,254 --> 00:20:29,258
We're going to give you a short timeline and a little bit of money.

459
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:31,613
Or do you expect a good result?

460
00:20:32,194 --> 00:20:33,695
And my answer would be no fucking way

461
00:20:33,755 --> 00:20:34,876
do I expect a good result.

462
00:20:34,956 --> 00:20:37,018
Like, these things take time, they take money.

463
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:38,540
They're done when they're done, right?

464
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,841
Like everyone knows that about games.

465
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:40,742
Like they're done when they're done.

466
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:42,924
But yet somehow we wanted to find things

467
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:44,405
that were like on a short timeline

468
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:45,666
because we think they're near the end

469
00:20:46,187 --> 00:20:47,588
and make micro investments in them

470
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,690
and expect that a good result, right?

471
00:20:51,704 --> 00:20:53,325
And that's just not how games get made.

472
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:54,906
It's not reflective how games get made.

473
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,129
Any business model you create for funding

474
00:20:58,189 --> 00:21:00,771
and publishing games needs to take into account

475
00:21:01,071 --> 00:21:03,693
that you don't really get to say when the game's done.

476
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:07,016
You get to say when it comes out

477
00:21:07,796 --> 00:21:08,937
and it's either done or it's not.

478
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:14,365
And that's something that is very challenging about publishing.

479
00:21:14,865 --> 00:21:18,586
And I don't really know, short of being absolutely cutthroat about cutting things early,

480
00:21:18,606 --> 00:21:22,367
I don't really know a good way to fix that other than just have bigger budgets.

481
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:25,408
And then lastly, kind of talked about this one already,

482
00:21:25,428 --> 00:21:28,849
if we just spent more time going to Comic Con,

483
00:21:28,969 --> 00:21:32,910
spent more time going to whatever, all the other kind of core shows,

484
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,671
we would have done a lot better not reaching out to the FGC directly.

485
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:37,851
That's more specifically for Divekick.

486
00:21:40,251 --> 00:21:45,313
So kind of wrapping up here, there's two slides of learnings.

487
00:21:46,713 --> 00:21:47,914
Ted talked this first one already.

488
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:49,914
People like very specific things about the games they play.

489
00:21:51,455 --> 00:21:54,456
It's interesting, like, think about it like this.

490
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:58,717
Like, what is on your game bookshelf that you play, right?

491
00:21:59,237 --> 00:22:01,538
And if you think about what you like about all the games on your bookshelf.

492
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:04,412
You'll notice trends, you'll notice things like that.

493
00:22:04,752 --> 00:22:06,033
And it's really easy to look at Steam

494
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:07,454
and figure out what games people are playing

495
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:09,916
and figure out, should I even bother trying to market it

496
00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:10,896
to this group or this group?

497
00:22:11,257 --> 00:22:12,598
Find people that like this game.

498
00:22:12,618 --> 00:22:15,039
Does that make sense to try to market to people that like?

499
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,920
samurai gun or whatever it is, right?

500
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:20,942
That's really easy to do with Steam and Steam Spy.

501
00:22:22,283 --> 00:22:23,805
Make a minimum viable product.

502
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:26,087
This is really, I mean, you can only do this

503
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:28,209
if the game allows it, but like I said with Divekick,

504
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:31,251
if we would've launched with eight characters

505
00:22:31,992 --> 00:22:34,314
and put the other five out over the following six months,

506
00:22:34,674 --> 00:22:35,935
our sales curve would've been longer,

507
00:22:36,236 --> 00:22:37,317
we would've made a lot more money,

508
00:22:37,577 --> 00:22:38,838
we would've had higher engagement,

509
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:41,100
and all those things are really good

510
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,542
for commercializing these things as products, right?

511
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,852
Have a plan to extend the game if it finds an audience.

512
00:22:47,253 --> 00:22:49,336
This one is, it's hard,

513
00:22:49,396 --> 00:22:50,778
this is about finding a balance, right?

514
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,302
Because plans are cheap and building things are expensive.

515
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:57,648
Right? But if you don't have enough stuff, people will never buy it because the

516
00:22:57,688 --> 00:23:02,212
value propositions off and factor into the MVP discussion. How do you do it?

517
00:23:02,252 --> 00:23:05,915
So like these two things are kind of like very coupled together in my mind.

518
00:23:06,355 --> 00:23:08,397
You can only ship an MVP. If you have plans,

519
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:11,920
you can easily execute on to make more stuff later, right?

520
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,483
And follow up with it if it finds an audience. Right. Um, and then finally,

521
00:23:15,523 --> 00:23:19,966
hype just can't be created. This is like, you know, again, this is us thinking,

522
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:23,049
Oh, we made the hype for dive kick, not dive kick, made the hype for dive kick.

523
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:28,601
And it's an easy mistake to fall into with success,

524
00:23:28,661 --> 00:23:30,642
to think like, oh yeah, this was good because of us.

525
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,063
And it's really, no, it's the game.

526
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:32,783
It's always the game.

527
00:23:37,994 --> 00:23:40,115
Yeah, so whatever your original business plan is,

528
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,297
like it would have been really easy

529
00:23:42,718 --> 00:23:44,379
to keep pouring money into GunSport,

530
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,321
to keep pouring money into CapsuleForce,

531
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,762
to keep pouring money into VideoBall,

532
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:50,585
but I don't think we would have gotten a better result.

533
00:23:50,925 --> 00:23:53,848
Like VideoBall, GunSport, CapsuleForce,

534
00:23:54,388 --> 00:23:56,130
the market is so much more competitive now

535
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,332
than when it was when we launched DiveKick in 2013, right?

536
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:01,935
And I don't think you can do small-scale publishing

537
00:24:02,455 --> 00:24:04,717
on the budgets we were talking about in this day and age.

538
00:24:04,737 --> 00:24:05,878
I just don't think it works, right?

539
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:09,020
And so pouring more money still would have been

540
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,862
just a little bit of money in the grand scheme of things.

541
00:24:11,102 --> 00:24:13,704
Like, you know, these aren't like $2 million video games, right?

542
00:24:14,304 --> 00:24:16,446
So I think one of the things we did right

543
00:24:16,466 --> 00:24:17,547
from an Iron Galaxy perspective,

544
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:20,609
it was very painful to have that conversation with Brandon

545
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,510
and explain to him.

546
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:24,913
that we're walking away from GunSport and he can have it back.

547
00:24:25,773 --> 00:24:28,535
But from Iron Galaxy's perspective it was absolutely the very right thing to do

548
00:24:28,555 --> 00:24:31,358
because it just wasn't going to end well.

549
00:24:31,778 --> 00:24:33,419
VideoBall wouldn't have ended as well

550
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:35,901
and we had to kind of pick our battles there.

551
00:24:37,122 --> 00:24:39,924
This is a good one. I think this is...

552
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:42,206
If you're doing streams and getting 44 viewers...

553
00:24:43,728 --> 00:25:04,026
If you're going to shows and not getting a buzz, you know, if you're doing trailers and they get 10 YouTube views on YouTube the first day, you need to think about what the fuck you're doing. You're doing something wrong, right? Either something's wrong with the game. Something is wrong with your approach. Something is wrong with your outreach. You're doing something wrong, and you need to reevaluate even doing it at all, right?

554
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:09,572
Good job. That's me.

555
00:25:10,353 --> 00:25:11,955
Don't artificially limit your potential audience.

556
00:25:12,035 --> 00:25:14,758
This is a mistake we made on Divekick. I kind of already talked about it.

557
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:20,305
We just leaned so hard into FGC stuff and had kind of a rough edge around everything we did with Divekick.

558
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:22,087
I'm sure it turned away potential consumers.

559
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:26,132
In fact, consumers that were the people that ended up buying the game.

560
00:25:27,218 --> 00:25:30,881
Finally, if you're working as a publisher, you have external dev teams, probably.

561
00:25:31,482 --> 00:25:33,644
Don't assume anything about the external dev teams.

562
00:25:33,684 --> 00:25:38,488
One of the bigger mistakes we made was, okay, we shipped, I think Iron Galaxy at this point

563
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:42,572
has shipped or helped shipped over 100 products in eight and a half years.

564
00:25:42,632 --> 00:25:43,453
No one's done that.

565
00:25:43,553 --> 00:25:43,713
Right?

566
00:25:44,474 --> 00:25:46,115
and you get really good by shipping things.

567
00:25:46,575 --> 00:25:48,636
And these teams we work with are all very capable teams,

568
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:50,617
but they just don't have that much experience, right?

569
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:52,898
And so we did not ask,

570
00:25:52,938 --> 00:25:55,040
we asked them questions we would ask ourselves.

571
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,621
We didn't ask them questions that you would have,

572
00:25:57,661 --> 00:25:59,803
you should have been asking us eight and a half years ago.

573
00:26:00,903 --> 00:26:02,604
And so I think we should have been more proactive

574
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,405
about a lot of things.

575
00:26:03,908 --> 00:26:05,269
I think we should have been more involved.

576
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,571
They all would have hated every second of it, right?

577
00:26:07,991 --> 00:26:09,452
But I'm sure it would have been better

578
00:26:09,492 --> 00:26:11,233
if we were more involved in every kind of,

579
00:26:12,093 --> 00:26:13,955
even creative decisions and just talking stuff out.

580
00:26:14,055 --> 00:26:18,938
So, remember, Mefford's first law of game development.

581
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:21,419
Any questions?

582
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:31,145
Oh, sorry.

583
00:26:32,315 --> 00:26:33,257
Hey man, good talk.

584
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:34,639
I was kind of hoping to hear more

585
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,781
about your conference strategy.

586
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:37,544
Was that purely for like player acquisition

587
00:26:37,564 --> 00:26:38,526
or were you doing other stuff?

588
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:41,030
And when you talk about big shows like Comic-Con,

589
00:26:41,692 --> 00:26:43,034
being a smaller company, do you ever fear

590
00:26:43,054 --> 00:26:44,376
about getting like drowned out next

591
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,558
like the Avengers or something?

592
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:48,043
Yeah, so the question was, he wants to know,

593
00:26:49,044 --> 00:26:50,005
what's our show strategy?

594
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:53,369
What do we try to get out of showing things like PAX?

595
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,792
And are bigger shows worth it for a smaller team?

596
00:26:56,272 --> 00:26:58,895
Yeah, it's strictly about acquisition and user engagement.

597
00:26:59,556 --> 00:27:01,278
You can try to set press stuff up at shows,

598
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:02,179
but they never come.

599
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,660
It's really challenging.

600
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:08,345
The other thing that's really great about shows is as a developer,

601
00:27:08,725 --> 00:27:12,908
you build up a network of other developers that are your size and have your same problems.

602
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:18,873
And that's like, it's like valuable on a different axis than getting fans of your company in your game.

603
00:27:19,654 --> 00:27:21,795
Getting drowned out at Comic Con is absolutely a big thing,

604
00:27:22,196 --> 00:27:24,477
but you need, just don't spend a million dollars going to Comic Con.

605
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:28,881
You know, find a place where you can sit at a corner of a table with somebody or whatever.

606
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:31,283
Spend proportionately on what results you expect.

607
00:27:32,844 --> 00:27:34,485
Yeah, simply put. So, cool.

608
00:27:36,371 --> 00:27:39,958
You were talking about how you had a 120 person dev team.

609
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:40,880
Yeah.

610
00:27:41,141 --> 00:27:43,345
So, and you were talking about you're publishing these three other games.

611
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:46,311
What were you working on in between while you were publishing these games?

612
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,191
So the publishing team was very small.

613
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:51,534
It was me, it was a guy named Eddie Caperez, and Felix.

614
00:27:51,975 --> 00:27:55,298
That was essentially the publishing team and QA.

615
00:27:55,378 --> 00:27:56,799
Chelsea, who's my business partner,

616
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,981
runs all the other games.

617
00:27:58,361 --> 00:27:59,802
We've done, the big stuff we were working on

618
00:27:59,822 --> 00:28:00,883
at that time was Killer Instinct.

619
00:28:00,983 --> 00:28:02,265
That's like a 75-person team.

620
00:28:02,645 --> 00:28:04,747
We did Elder Scrolls Online, the console versions of that.

621
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:05,608
That was like a 35-peak team.

622
00:28:08,591 --> 00:28:10,632
just tons of stuff and the teams get smaller.

623
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:12,454
We have some projects that are like one or two people.

624
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:15,336
Like, oh, we're doing the 4K operas

625
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:17,558
for a game I can't talk about, unfortunately.

626
00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:18,118
Stuff like that.

627
00:28:18,158 --> 00:28:20,100
So, lots and lots of different kinds of projects.

628
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:22,002
Some creative, some ports,

629
00:28:22,182 --> 00:28:23,543
and some are just working behind the scenes

630
00:28:23,563 --> 00:28:24,204
to get stuff shipped.

631
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:27,867
And do you think, you know, that publishing part

632
00:28:27,887 --> 00:28:29,828
that you said, you know, you end up being unsuccessful,

633
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:31,850
do you think it impacted, like, budget-wise

634
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:32,951
a lot of your other titles?

635
00:28:33,897 --> 00:28:38,963
So I'm guessing I don't have to repeat these because he's on a microphone, but just in case did

636
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,325
this publishing failure

637
00:28:42,026 --> 00:28:48,012
cost us other opportunities and like this was money we set aside to set up a new business venture. It was very budgeted

638
00:28:48,052 --> 00:28:51,715
It was very measured, which is why we just couldn't keep dumping money into the games, right?

639
00:28:53,057 --> 00:28:55,059
So no, it didn't really have any impact. It just meant like

640
00:28:55,794 --> 00:28:57,615
you know, instead of starting our own indie game,

641
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,015
start setting the next dive kick,

642
00:28:59,395 --> 00:29:01,396
we invested in these other external titles, right?

643
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:02,777
That's what it disallowed.

644
00:29:02,937 --> 00:29:03,997
That's the opportunity it took away.

645
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:05,018
Thank you.

646
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:05,398
No problem.

647
00:29:05,418 --> 00:29:07,559
I think we've got time for one more, maybe?

648
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:10,660
We good?

649
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,740
All right, thanks everybody.
