00:00:11,591 --> 00:00:16,914
Hi everyone, my name is Ian Chen and I'm a Taiwanese-Canadian composer working in films,

2
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:18,134
TV and video games.

3
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:23,277
Today I will introduce you to a variety of traditional Chinese instruments.

4
00:00:24,017 --> 00:00:28,785
And at the end, I will show you how these instruments may be used in the context of

5
00:00:28,865 --> 00:00:33,633
Western orchestral music, taking examples from my soundtrack to indie game Fantastic

6
00:00:33,653 --> 00:00:38,320
Creatures, which was nominated for Music of the Year at last year's Game Audio Network

7
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:38,921
Guild Awards.

8
00:00:39,944 --> 00:00:48,273
Now before I start, I must mention that I am by no means a real expert or an ethnomusicologist on the subject matter.

9
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:54,260
My knowledge came mainly through discoveries I made along the way when arranging and writing for these instruments,

10
00:00:54,721 --> 00:01:00,307
as well as from my time in college when I managed a small Chinese music ensemble in upstate New York.

11
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:07,954
In comparison, in China as well as Taiwan, traditional Chinese music has their own conservatory

12
00:01:08,014 --> 00:01:10,436
systems separate from that of Western music.

13
00:01:11,157 --> 00:01:15,821
And just like Western music, there are many branches, subgenres, and regional differences

14
00:01:16,322 --> 00:01:18,844
within this overarching thing we call Chinese music.

15
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:25,870
And since China is geographically enormous, there can be astonishing differences between

16
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,132
the music of different regions.

17
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:32,695
And some of the most popular Chinese instruments today actually all came from different regions of China.

18
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:38,518
Today I will attempt to go through some of the most popular instruments

19
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:42,820
as well as some lessons on ones that are unique to the Chinese musical sound.

20
00:01:45,382 --> 00:01:48,684
First, let's look at the different family groups.

21
00:01:49,104 --> 00:01:52,066
Now, there are many ways to categorize Chinese instruments,

22
00:01:52,706 --> 00:01:54,967
and traditionally, Chinese instruments are grouped

23
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:58,069
into these eight categories you see on the screen,

24
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,770
known as the Ba-In.

25
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:05,173
These are the metal on the left, stone, silk,

26
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:13,158
bamboo, gourd, clay, skin, or leather, and at the end, wood.

27
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:20,546
And for the purpose of today's discussion, I want to use the more modern way of categorizing them

28
00:02:20,926 --> 00:02:27,271
and we'll broadly divide them into bold strings, plucked or struck strings, woodwinds, and percussions.

29
00:02:29,593 --> 00:02:32,815
Now in the family of bold strings, the most famous one is probably

30
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:36,438
the erhu, which is also sometimes called the Chinese fiddle.

31
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:46,980
Even though the one we are most familiar with is really only a specific regional variant of the family of the Huqin from the southern part of China.

32
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:49,041
And I actually have one right here with me.

33
00:02:53,103 --> 00:02:55,604
I want to use this to show you the construction.

34
00:02:55,964 --> 00:03:01,467
As you can see on the face, there is a little bridge sitting on the python skin.

35
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:08,088
And this is actually, so when I brought this instrument into the US, I actually had to

36
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:13,372
declare it because of the Python skin here. And as you can see, the bow

37
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:20,337
actually sits in between the outer and the inner strings.

38
00:03:21,498 --> 00:03:24,500
So when you play the inner strings, you kind of pull towards you.

39
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:28,103
And when you play the outer one, you push it out.

40
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:28,263
Anyway.

41
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:44,588
And with the samples, it sounds like this.

42
00:03:55,857 --> 00:03:59,480
As you can hear, the Ohu is very expressive and melancholy

43
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,003
and is suitable for sentimental solo passages.

44
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:16,420
But even though it is in the bold family, bold string family, like a violin, I would advise against using Erhu in an ensemble setup the way violins, violas, and celli are used in Western orchestras.

45
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:24,585
I know there have been attempts in recent decades to reinvent Chinese music using the Western orchestra setup as a model.

46
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:32,389
And as such, many modern Chinese orchestras employ an ensemble of Erhuists to replicate the string section in a Western orchestra.

47
00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:36,588
Here I have some example pictures to show.

48
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:42,014
This is the Nanyang Chinese Orchestra. As you can see on the left and the right,

49
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:49,782
there are groups of Erhu players. And then here's the Shanghai Chinese Orchestra. See the Erhu players.

50
00:04:52,835 --> 00:05:01,100
And there have also been attempts to reinvent new instruments for this purpose.

51
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:10,045
For example, the gehu, which was invented in the 1950s to replace the cello in the modern Chinese orchestra.

52
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:16,089
It's kind of like, it's the size of a cello, but with a python skin and such.

53
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:23,865
Now my problem with this approach is that the sound of an uhu is, I think, fundamentally

54
00:05:23,905 --> 00:05:27,607
different from the sound of a strings family in a western orchestra.

55
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:33,789
The uhu is really strong and piercing as a solo instrument, but in an ensemble setting,

56
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:39,832
the sound of each instrument doesn't really add up the same way violins do, for example.

57
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:44,274
And as a result, the sounds produced become kind of bland and non-expressive.

58
00:05:47,322 --> 00:05:52,843
But this is my personal opinion, and of course, you should seek out recordings and judge for yourself.

59
00:05:54,403 --> 00:05:59,784
Now, this leads me to the next instrument family group, the plugged or struck strings.

60
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:01,785
You can see at the back.

61
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:15,047
In a large ensemble setting, I think these will be the instruments I use to provide a strong foundation and harmonic structure to the music, similar to how strings are used in Western orchestras.

62
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:24,705
And in particular, the zong ruan, the da ruan, the pipa, liu qin, and yang qin are the most popular ensemble instruments used in this way.

63
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,888
And each of these instruments is also great for solo.

64
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:43,656
One of the most famous in this category is the pipa, which can be heard in the soundtracks for Zhang Yimou's 2004 film House of the Flying Dagger, as well as, for example, Stephen Chow's film Kung Fu from the same year.

65
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:49,342
Yeah, I have a very, I have, so I have the Liu Qin here, which is a smaller,

66
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:52,865
kind of like a smaller version of the pipa as well as the Zong Ran on the right.

67
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:53,585
I'll show you.

68
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:09,818
As you can see, it has four strings sitting on a

69
00:07:10,818 --> 00:07:13,060
wooden body. It sounds like this.

70
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:17,490
Play with a pick.

71
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:23,456
And there's a technique often used called shake that sounds a little bit like this.

72
00:07:23,536 --> 00:07:24,737
No, I'm not a liuqin player.

73
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:35,166
And then, of course, you can bend the strings.

74
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:51,354
And this is the zong ran or the medium lute and it sounds like this.

75
00:07:55,175 --> 00:08:00,597
Now it's much louder because the body is bigger and it has a rich low tone.

76
00:08:00,617 --> 00:08:04,358
And you can also do a shake.

77
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:17,087
Now if I remember correctly, these instruments come,

78
00:08:17,107 --> 00:08:19,588
actually come from the western part of China.

79
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:23,190
Um, so,

80
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,412
and I'll show you what the samples sound like.

81
00:08:27,432 --> 00:08:28,292
So this is the pipa.

82
00:08:28,312 --> 00:08:37,137
Of course, you don't have to do this shake, you can do it.

83
00:08:44,676 --> 00:08:55,124
And the next one, another popular instrument in this family is called the guzheng, which is a zither-like instrument and basically the ancestor of the Japanese koto.

84
00:08:56,105 --> 00:09:00,848
And in an orchestral setting, it can be thought of as similar to a harp.

85
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:06,192
And here's a picture of a guzheng.

86
00:09:11,736 --> 00:09:12,897
And it sounds like this.

87
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:19,994
Actually, hold on.

88
00:09:21,314 --> 00:09:25,195
So as you pluck on one side, you can use the other hand to

89
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:31,156
push down on the string on the other side to raise the tone and to make this kind of...

90
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:42,519
And I mentioned how you can use like a harp when you play Glissando on it.

91
00:09:47,764 --> 00:09:51,046
a very Chinese sounding thing.

92
00:09:52,147 --> 00:10:00,875
And next we have the Wens family, which includes the Di Zi, the Sheng, Xiao, Suo Na, and Hu Lu Si,

93
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:08,141
just to name a few. The most famous one, I guess, to the Western Era is probably the Di Zi, which is

94
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:16,449
which is a flute made from bamboo with a membrane attached to create a kazoo-like timbre.

95
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,070
Sounds like this.

96
00:10:26,953 --> 00:10:31,255
Please note that the Dizi is in itself a family of flutes of different sizes and tones,

97
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:36,438
and you would often pick the kind you want based on the music and the register of the passage,

98
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:41,440
kind of similar to how you might pick an English horn over an oboe or a piccolo over a flute.

99
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:47,403
A Dizi player often carries a bag of a variety of these instruments and

100
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:50,304
use them based on the key and characteristics of the music.

101
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:55,445
And speaking of which, it might be good to know that many Chinese instruments,

102
00:10:56,787 --> 00:11:01,511
especially those in the woodwinds family, are key-specific, just like their Western counterparts.

103
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:07,517
The difference is that Chinese instruments are not fitted with keys to help with semitones,

104
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:11,181
since Chinese music is traditionally played in a seven-tone

105
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:14,184
yugotemperament rather than the Western system of totem.

106
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:25,112
And as such, you'll find that a Chinese Dizi player might switch between a C flute and a D flute depending on the music written, even though these are pretty close in register.

107
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:30,714
And I have some pictures, I think.

108
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:33,775
Hold on.

109
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:34,976
Ah, here we go.

110
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:43,886
As you can see, this is a picture I took of the Hulusi and Dizi player who came in to record for the soundtrack.

111
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:50,650
At the back you see a bunch of Dizi that he brought for different passages of the music.

112
00:11:53,772 --> 00:12:03,139
And finally, don't forget that percussion instruments are some of the most important and widely used instruments in all sorts of Chinese ensembles, from small to large.

113
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,200
For example, in...

114
00:12:06,297 --> 00:12:14,164
Beijing opera, the drum cymbals, woodblocks, and clave play some of the most critical role

115
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:20,569
in dictating the proceedings of the play, and often also signify important story events

116
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:22,010
in the opera.

117
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:29,661
Now percussion instruments can take center stage much more often than what happens in traditional

118
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:36,889
western orchestral music. Examples can be heard in films such as Ang Lee's Oscar-winning film

119
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,953
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. They're in a fight scene.

120
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:49,219
You only hear a few percussions playing, but it's kind of captivating and pushes the drama forward.

121
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,921
I also used a passage like that in my soundtrack.

122
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:56,303
Well, I'll just show you right now quickly.

123
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:27,427
This is really cool because you don't often hear this kind of passage in western percussion music.

124
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:28,787
And then later...

125
00:13:28,848 --> 00:13:29,988
This is the peepaw.

126
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,743
Which we discussed earlier.

127
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:01,263
Yeah

128
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:04,544
Um, so that concludes the most

129
00:14:05,825 --> 00:14:10,647
I guess in the most popular the more popular instruments that I was going to talk about, but there are also a few

130
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:16,589
uh lesser known instruments that I want to talk about which I incorporated in my into my soundtrack

131
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:19,990
Uh in the pluck instructions family, we have the yangqin

132
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:24,154
Which looks like this.

133
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:26,716
Oh, no, not that one. This one.

134
00:14:28,457 --> 00:14:30,738
As you can see, it's basically a dulcimer.

135
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,939
And it's very useful in a supportive role,

136
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,880
doing things like trills, chords, and arpeggio runs.

137
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:38,621
Something like this.

138
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:52,738
And another interesting instrument in this category is the lesser-known zither called guqin,

139
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:59,801
which is one of the most ancient instruments and one with many romantic stories associated with it.

140
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:04,223
It is favored by scholars as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement,

141
00:15:04,683 --> 00:15:09,065
and is often used to symbolize the concept of music as a whole in Chinese culture.

142
00:15:09,585 --> 00:15:12,106
And that one looks like this.

143
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,107
And when you play, you move the thumb around.

144
00:15:16,378 --> 00:15:22,400
So kind of like the remains of the the plucking sound can change notes as you go.

145
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,861
So it's kind of hard to sample.

146
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:29,803
I did use a little bit of it in the beginning of one of my tracks.

147
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:33,904
I don't can find it.

148
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:36,985
Anyway, it sounds like this.

149
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:56,142
It's a little hard to show because when you move the thumb around, it changes the tone.

150
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:08,866
Anyway, next we have the the Hulusi, which is the gourd category and is in the woodwinds family.

151
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:16,188
It's made from three bamboo pipes attached to a gourd, making a beautiful rounded and mellow sound.

152
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,536
I think I showed it earlier.

153
00:16:19,798 --> 00:16:22,741
It's this thing sitting in the front and the whole thing looks like that.

154
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:29,488
It's originally used by just a few ethnic minorities in the Yunnan province

155
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:32,971
and later gained popularity throughout China.

156
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,854
Here's what it sounds like.

157
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:51,564
I did use it as a solo instrument in some of my passages.

158
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:54,245
Nope, not that one.

159
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:57,808
What's this here?

160
00:16:57,828 --> 00:17:07,213
That's the hallucinogen.

161
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:37,900
So the passage is Hulusi on top of strings and at the end during this hit you actually

162
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,361
you can see this is a linux version of Hulusi.

163
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:46,502
So that's all there is to it.

164
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:52,624
I hope you found this video useful and if you did please like and subscribe and we'll

Take care.

167
00:17:53,464 --> 00:17:53,524
Bye.

168
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:53,924
Take care.

169
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:54,785
Bye, bye.

170
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:54,865
bye.

171
00:17:54,985 --> 00:17:55,065
Bye.

172
00:17:55,085 --> 00:17:55,185
Bye.

173
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:55,405
Bye.

174
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:55,625
Bye.

175
00:17:56,065 --> 00:17:56,165
Bye.

176
00:17:56,185 --> 00:17:56,245
Bye.

177
00:17:56,265 --> 00:17:56,325
Bye.

178
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:56,405
Bye.

179
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:56,485
Bye.

180
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:56,625
Bye.

181
00:17:56,665 --> 00:17:56,785
Bye.

182
00:17:56,865 --> 00:17:56,925
Bye.

183
00:17:56,965 --> 00:17:57,045
Bye.

184
00:17:57,065 --> 00:17:57,125
Bye.

185
00:17:57,145 --> 00:17:57,225
Bye.

186
00:17:57,245 --> 00:17:57,325
Bye.

187
00:17:57,345 --> 00:17:57,405
Bye.

188
00:17:57,425 --> 00:17:57,565
Bye.

189
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:57,725
Bye.

190
00:17:57,745 --> 00:17:57,805
Bye.

191
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:05,139
the Chinese gong as well as... well I mimicked the Chinese gong with like metal balls as well as

192
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:08,706
an arpeggio on the yangqing as I demonstrated earlier.

193
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:15,463
Finally, we have the sung, which is a really cool instrument.

194
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:20,566
It's basically a mouth organ made with bamboo pipes of different lengths.

195
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:25,009
It has one of the most unique sounds not really heard in Western music.

196
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:30,573
It is also the grandfather of many instruments found throughout Asia and Southeast Asia,

197
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:32,135
such as the Japanese shō.

198
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:41,378
It looks like this, and when they play, they hold the instruments with both hands.

199
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:44,200
So it is also very expressive.

200
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:48,003
And I used in...

201
00:18:48,804 --> 00:18:50,145
Actually, let me show you how it sounds.

202
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:12,484
So you can play multiple notes at once. And in the more modern Chinese orchestras,

203
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:20,970
there are more versions of this invented that are larger and it creates support for the music.

204
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:31,758
Let me see if I can... Oh, I also used it in a way to play off the brass section in an orchestra.

205
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:34,380
Let me see.

206
00:19:55,575 --> 00:20:01,780
So there are a lot of different techniques in all the instruments that I briefly mentioned

207
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,040
today.

208
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:25,786
Sometimes it's difficult to know all the details of the instruments, but what's great about these folk instruments is that once you hire an instrumentalist in, they can provide articulations or ornaments that you didn't even think was possible.

209
00:20:26,506 --> 00:20:28,847
And that really adds a lot to the music as well.

210
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:35,588
I want to briefly talk about how, um, well, let me just show you some passages and different

211
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:36,969
examples of the music.

212
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:40,391
So for Di Zi, I use as a solo.

213
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:49,077
It's very piercing, so it's really easy to cut through.

214
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:10,757
So that was a combination of Di Zi and the plucking family with the strings.

215
00:21:10,777 --> 00:21:21,583
So that's more of a fusion sound, whereas here I'll show you a more traditional sound.

216
00:21:23,223 --> 00:21:24,304
Again, percussions.

217
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:37,905
with the pipa. So small ensemble is more common in traditional Chinese music.

218
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:45,767
And then they do, I use the song.

219
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:49,388
I would go into a western sounding.

220
00:21:54,752 --> 00:22:00,296
The strings ensemble with the pipa and the beats on the top.

221
00:22:00,476 --> 00:22:02,038
And now the Erhu.

222
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:07,782
As I mentioned, I prefer to use the Erhu as a solo instrument.

223
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:29,807
And now, cello is also very useful, even though it's not a Chinese instrument.

224
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:34,228
Traditionally, I feel like if you use a traditional Chinese instrument, you kind

225
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:38,769
of lack that sort of low end string sound because it just didn't exist.

226
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:43,210
So in fact, a lot of modern Chinese orchestras just simply use the cello.

227
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:49,551
And just like a Western orchestral score, cello is also very useful in this context.

228
00:22:52,494 --> 00:22:53,654
What else can I show you?

229
00:22:54,815 --> 00:22:56,176
I've shown you this one already.

230
00:22:56,196 --> 00:23:14,847
So this is the bao, which is a di zi-like instrument without the membrane.

231
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:18,470
So it sounds rounder.

232
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,381
And that's called a Bawu.

233
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:37,123
B-A-W-U.

234
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:45,669
And now before I go, I want to also briefly mention how when you hire an instrumentalist,

235
00:23:48,211 --> 00:23:51,473
nowadays there are many who also read Western staff.

236
00:23:51,894 --> 00:23:52,935
However, traditionally,

237
00:23:54,275 --> 00:24:01,041
It's more of an oral tradition, and then later there's a new way invented to notate things,

238
00:24:01,061 --> 00:24:09,049
which is called the gempu, which uses numbers instead of western stuff. And here's an example

239
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:13,893
of how that looks like. So, for example, in Amazing Grace, so one means the

240
00:24:19,303 --> 00:24:21,065
For example, in the key of C, one would be C.

241
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,146
So this would sing like a...

242
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:34,573
So as you can see, it tells you on the top that it's in 3-4.

243
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:41,917
And then if you see one, it means the C, and then three is E, and so on and so forth.

244
00:24:41,957 --> 00:24:43,798
And the dots means the octave.

245
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:46,720
So this is traditionally how...

246
00:24:49,022 --> 00:24:55,768
recent traditionally how things are read and you can even see it in score form. As you can see,

247
00:24:56,609 --> 00:25:03,736
this is like a large score with the woodwinds on the top, the strings here, and the percussions.

248
00:25:05,764 --> 00:25:08,007
the pluggings, and so on and so forth.

249
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:15,357
And when I had the instrumentalist come in to record for my soundtrack, I had to handwrite

250
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:21,645
all the... to basically transcribe all the score into the Jampool form.

251
00:25:22,326 --> 00:25:22,906
As you can see...

252
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:26,966
Oh, it's going to be hard to see. Oh, there we go.

253
00:25:28,808 --> 00:25:29,388
Like that.

254
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:31,490
So for each instrument,

255
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,271
I had to make the

256
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,272
Jempu version of it.

257
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:37,455
Now I know I'm based in LA

258
00:25:37,575 --> 00:25:39,596
and there are actually many artists

259
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:40,297
here who

260
00:25:41,158 --> 00:25:43,479
or many instrumentalists here who also

261
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,860
read Western stuff.

262
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:53,007
I mean, they could be more expensive, and it is not the way that they probably learned

263
00:25:53,027 --> 00:26:01,113
the instrument originally. So if possible, I would suggest to see if you could make a

264
00:26:01,153 --> 00:26:05,856
Genpoo version of it for them, especially if the people you're hiring, for example, for me,

265
00:26:05,956 --> 00:26:11,721
I hired them from the eastern region of LA where there's a lot of Chinese population and

266
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:16,780
And a lot of them don't actually read Western stuff.

267
00:26:17,281 --> 00:26:18,762
So this is useful to know.

268
00:26:19,182 --> 00:26:23,846
Of course, if you don't, if there's no way for you to translate it, then by all means

269
00:26:23,886 --> 00:26:27,029
hire someone who knows how to read Western stuff.

270
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:34,755
But like I said, it is really important, I think, especially when you write for Chinese

271
00:26:34,775 --> 00:26:41,420
instruments, to hire a Chinese instrumentalist to come in and they will add so much to the music.

272
00:26:42,321 --> 00:26:45,966
All right. I think that concludes my talk today.

273
00:26:45,986 --> 00:26:51,953
I hope it was useful and I'll see you next time. Thank you.
