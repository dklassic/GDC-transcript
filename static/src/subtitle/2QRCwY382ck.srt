1
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,733
The massacre was only the beginning.

2
00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:16,954
Who did this to us?

3
00:00:18,174 --> 00:00:19,235
Who attacked the tribe?

4
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,198
All we can do is pray to the goddess.

5
00:00:25,598 --> 00:00:25,818
No.

6
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:27,879
Praying won't save us.

7
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:29,540
We have to find the killers.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,721
So you will have to leave the Sacred Land.

9
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:33,442
Where the trail leads,

10
00:00:35,363 --> 00:00:35,723
I will go.

11
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:56,965
Aloy of the Nora, what brings you to Meridian?

12
00:00:58,566 --> 00:00:59,607
There's a threat to us all.

13
00:01:00,248 --> 00:01:02,710
Men in masks, raising up ancient machines.

14
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,351
And I've seen their leader.

15
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:07,234
From the depths, I will raise an army.

16
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:11,197
A storm of shadows to take back what's ours.

17
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,681
What are you doing to them?

18
00:01:18,482 --> 00:01:19,262
Taking control.

19
00:01:20,323 --> 00:01:22,726
You can see the corruption coming off them like smoke.

20
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:25,228
You've come a long way since the Citadel, Aloy.

21
00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:26,109
Who are you?

22
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:27,250
An interested party.

23
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:46,614
All right guys, let's get started.

24
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:50,156
So you know the drill by now,

25
00:01:50,216 --> 00:01:52,137
about 15 minutes after you leave this hall,

26
00:01:52,157 --> 00:01:54,358
you're gonna get one of these nice little emails

27
00:01:54,378 --> 00:01:54,999
with the feedback.

28
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,120
And the bit I'm really interested in,

29
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,220
this is a little white box.

30
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:02,522
So I'm far too close to my material.

31
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:04,043
I don't know whether this is really clever

32
00:02:04,143 --> 00:02:04,804
or really obvious.

33
00:02:05,364 --> 00:02:07,865
So if you guys could just give me a few notes afterwards,

34
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:09,746
we'd really appreciate it.

35
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:12,788
But without any further ado.

36
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,308
Here's all what you're here to see.

37
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:17,270
Horizon Zero Dawn.

38
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:20,091
So...

39
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:23,193
We're that game with the...

40
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:24,234
with the dinosaurs.

41
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:34,559
And not only that,

42
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,561
more specifically, we're that game

43
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:39,302
where you play as a young huntress

44
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:41,143
and you fight those robot dinosaurs

45
00:02:42,844 --> 00:02:43,725
with a bow and arrow.

46
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:49,129
And we're set in a beautiful, expansive, open world

47
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,412
which, spoilers, is actually the ruins of our own civilization reclaimed by nature.

48
00:02:55,432 --> 00:03:01,874
This is populated by a series of new human civilizations.

49
00:03:02,614 --> 00:03:05,876
Humanity is now scattered and struggling to survive.

50
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:10,818
And as Aloy, the player character, you become embroiled in the conflicts of this new world

51
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,720
and work to solve the mystery of what happened to the old world.

52
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,285
So these tribes, these are what we're going to focus on today.

53
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:24,166
The title of my talk is Repopulating the Earth.

54
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:26,046
And it has a dual meaning.

55
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,067
In the fiction, the tribes, they don't really

56
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:29,267
know anything about our shared history.

57
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:30,407
They've had to start from scratch.

58
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:33,208
They have their own mythology, their own cultures.

59
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:35,428
And really, we had this parallel challenge.

60
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:39,970
We had to go from a blank slate, no design, no story, no tools,

61
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,771
to this world populated by a great many diverse

62
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,371
living peoples.

63
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:49,404
So to begin with, let's take a look at how that blank slate came to be.

64
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:53,206
Because Guerrilla, for the longest time, were the Killzone guys.

65
00:03:54,587 --> 00:03:58,228
And some people in the studio had done literally nothing but 15 years of Killzones.

66
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:00,969
So a little bit of creative fatigue was setting in,

67
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,890
and a small team of just over about a dozen people,

68
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,591
they split off and worked on what would become Horizon.

69
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:11,564
So this was a pretty small team, but the work they did was absolutely pivotal.

70
00:04:12,104 --> 00:04:16,126
They came up with this amazing premise that basically just won over everyone who saw it.

71
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:20,588
We got fantastic prototypes like this that set a very clear expectation of what the game

72
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:21,349
could be.

73
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:25,911
And through all this inspirational work, everyone on the team was really sold on this potential.

74
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:34,817
But at this point it's just potential and this tiny team they can't actually make this huge crazy ambitious game all on their own

75
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,940
To do this they need a lot more people

76
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,124
So Kills on Shadowfall wraps up and then a 200 person team rolls on over and I have a video of what that looked like

77
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,761
So everyone's really excited.

78
00:04:59,162 --> 00:05:01,223
Everyone has loads of ideas, too many ideas.

79
00:05:01,783 --> 00:05:02,584
Everything's up in the air.

80
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:05,305
We have this atmosphere of paralyzing uncertainty.

81
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:08,047
And that was the point where I joined the team.

82
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,448
So 10 slides in, I am Dan Calvert, and I was character

83
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:12,709
art director on Horizon Zero Dawn.

84
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,531
And getting in on the beginning of a crazy, ambitious,

85
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:17,392
creative, new IP.

86
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,492
is many people's dream project, including my own,

87
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:23,996
especially if that project does end up being successful like Horizon was.

88
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:26,178
But of course, at the beginning, when we were starting,

89
00:05:26,198 --> 00:05:27,800
we had no idea if it would be successful.

90
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,842
We didn't even know if we could pull it off.

91
00:05:30,592 --> 00:05:35,294
and I had to deal with the worst possible one-two combo, that uncertainty which I just mentioned.

92
00:05:36,055 --> 00:05:39,356
But also this huge scope of this expansive world full of people.

93
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:46,620
So, summed up, you know, we didn't know what to make, but we knew that we had to make a hell of a lot of it.

94
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:52,403
So, much like this guy, you know, once I got over the initial excitement, I'm like, where the hell do I even begin?

95
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:59,632
This story is the talk of the story of how I ate this burger.

96
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:05,018
How we managed those two contradictory requirements, scope and uncertainty.

97
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:10,284
And I'm going to do this by breaking down the last three and a half years of my life into ten little stories for you all.

98
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:14,688
So, this first story, let's take a look at this contradiction.

99
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:18,452
We don't know what to make, but we know we need to make a lot of it.

100
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,815
And at this point, at the beginning, you know, the project is a blank page.

101
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,137
All we have is a premise, and we just have to figure out the rest.

102
00:06:25,758 --> 00:06:30,742
And this wouldn't have been so bad, were it not for the fact that everyone else was also sitting in front of a blank page.

103
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:33,865
The story isn't written. We don't know how many quests there are going to be.

104
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:37,387
We don't have any idea which characters people are going to need.

105
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:40,550
And all the tools, you know, they're all still geared towards making kills in games.

106
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,731
So these guys, they can't even make any quests.

107
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:45,273
It's going to be a long time until we actually have any information to act on.

108
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,934
But we can't just sit around and wait.

109
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:48,895
I wanted to get some characters done,

110
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:51,037
but I didn't want to do any thorough work.

111
00:06:51,757 --> 00:06:54,239
So for these early characters that we make to be useful,

112
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,760
you know, what form do they need to take?

113
00:06:57,901 --> 00:06:58,482
Formless.

114
00:06:59,242 --> 00:06:59,763
Shapeless.

115
00:07:00,763 --> 00:07:01,404
Like water.

116
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:03,665
You put water into a cup.

117
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,822
It becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.

118
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:11,604
You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.

119
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:15,025
So they had to be like water, you know.

120
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:19,387
We didn't know exactly what shape hole they had to fill, so they had to fill any hole.

121
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,789
Or put it another way, you know, we didn't know exactly how the characters would be used.

122
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:25,891
So we'd need to start with the characters which were the most versatile.

123
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,211
But normally this isn't always how things are done.

124
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:33,032
You see, specific characters like the lead cast for example

125
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,933
are some of the most important content you need to make

126
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:37,094
and obviously it's like some of the more visible content,

127
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:38,234
some of the most visible content.

128
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:40,295
So it's often what people will start with.

129
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:44,236
But you know, specific characters like these, this is risky.

130
00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:47,637
If you're doing a design which is geared to communicate

131
00:07:47,997 --> 00:07:48,898
one thing, one idea.

132
00:07:49,558 --> 00:07:50,398
What if things change?

133
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,580
And what if things are cut?

134
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,461
That's just wasted time and effort.

135
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:58,042
The more important someone is as well to the story,

136
00:07:58,302 --> 00:07:59,362
like these lead characters,

137
00:07:59,823 --> 00:08:01,303
the more likely it is they're going to change.

138
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:03,304
Let's take Ross, for example.

139
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:05,465
So Ross is Aloy's surrogate father.

140
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:07,226
He's pivotal to the first act.

141
00:08:07,826 --> 00:08:09,227
He was part of the story back when

142
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:10,668
they were still working out the premise.

143
00:08:11,553 --> 00:08:13,773
you'd think Ross, you know, he'd be a safe bet.

144
00:08:14,314 --> 00:08:15,354
But not at all.

145
00:08:15,714 --> 00:08:17,514
You see, as the story evolved, so did Ross.

146
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:20,835
He mellows out a lot from this ax-wielding berserker

147
00:08:20,855 --> 00:08:21,436
you see on screen.

148
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,096
And leaving what we know about Ross aside,

149
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:25,137
you know, we don't really know anything about

150
00:08:25,157 --> 00:08:26,777
the culture that Ross comes from.

151
00:08:27,517 --> 00:08:28,998
You know, this is kind of important

152
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:30,818
if you're doing a key character like Ross.

153
00:08:31,518 --> 00:08:34,279
Because he's individual, he's special.

154
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,520
And if I don't know what the average person

155
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,260
from Ross tribe looks like, you know,

156
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,801
how do I know how to make this guy stand out?

157
00:08:42,282 --> 00:08:44,103
So instead of starting with individuals like Rost,

158
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:45,303
we started with the generic guys.

159
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:47,524
Generic is a bit of a dirty word.

160
00:08:48,685 --> 00:08:50,065
I say generic, you're probably thinking

161
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:51,486
things looking the same,

162
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:53,347
things looking boring like this poor guy.

163
00:08:54,587 --> 00:08:55,768
That's not really what generic means.

164
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:58,149
It merely, it's merely the opposite of specific.

165
00:08:58,249 --> 00:08:59,449
It means versatile.

166
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,790
So let's look at this from another angle.

167
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:05,247
What characters did the design team need at the beginning of production?

168
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:10,390
They don't really need specific characters like Ross because their ideas aren't yet that specific.

169
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,991
They're still figuring things out.

170
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,133
They need to have flexibility to change their minds.

171
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:15,373
So we thought bigger.

172
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:19,136
You know, instead of designing a person, we designed peoples.

173
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:24,079
You know, we started with the cultures, the tribes, and we designed these guys as a unit.

174
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:28,042
You know, we'd map out all the different kinds of character we thought we'd need in each tribe.

175
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,543
And we call these key designs archetypes.

176
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:31,943
You know, what you're looking at on the screen,

177
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:34,144
these are the archetypes for the Kai tribe.

178
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,164
But why do it this way?

179
00:09:36,885 --> 00:09:38,045
Well, the trick here is that,

180
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:40,366
provided the tribe as a whole is versatile,

181
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:43,047
individual archetypes can be less versatile

182
00:09:43,107 --> 00:09:44,627
if you're thinking about these guys in a unit.

183
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:47,948
So that guard, you know, he's fairly limited in his uses,

184
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:50,469
but that's okay, provided the rest of the population

185
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:52,810
can cover what the quest team might need.

186
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:58,897
But if we don't know anything, how do we go about identifying which of these archetypes to design?

187
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:01,759
Well, we don't actually need that much to go off.

188
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,484
We only need a few very basic assumptions like this from the writers in order to get started.

189
00:10:07,184 --> 00:10:09,486
I mean, we need a hell of a lot more to get finished,

190
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,409
but we don't actually need all of this information to start.

191
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:15,520
And with this little bit of information,

192
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,000
you know, we can get stuck in,

193
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,741
we can start designing those first archetypes.

194
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:20,242
Once we have something to show,

195
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:22,543
you know, we bounce things back and forth with the writers

196
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:24,983
and we just continue that until we have all of these guys.

197
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:27,464
And this worked out pretty great

198
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:30,305
because whilst all the quests are their own little stories,

199
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:31,906
these stories are taking place

200
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:33,207
inside of an established world.

201
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,547
And because we got started early,

202
00:10:35,587 --> 00:10:38,028
we got in on the ground floor with the writers

203
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:39,489
whilst they're still doing this world building,

204
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:41,450
these archetypes ended up being

205
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,790
a part of that world building.

206
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,646
So when the quest team, you know, when they needed to start nailing down

207
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,847
what kind of characters they needed to use,

208
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:52,931
they tended to be these kind of characters, you know, what a coincidence.

209
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:57,915
And for every character with a name, we'd build a unique character from those generic parts,

210
00:10:57,935 --> 00:10:58,936
those generic archetypes.

211
00:10:59,857 --> 00:11:02,259
Many of our key characters, like Nil or like Petra,

212
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:04,601
they just kept using these generic parts.

213
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:07,423
Those parts, they just kind of fit the characters so well

214
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:09,145
that we didn't need to change anything.

215
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:13,701
But of course there were many, many other characters where that generic content wasn't good enough.

216
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:17,124
There were some simple examples, you know, sometimes a character needs to look injured.

217
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:22,328
But more importantly, we'd have a large number of important story characters

218
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:25,171
where these kind of generic looks wouldn't fit their characterization.

219
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:26,392
Let's go back to Rost.

220
00:11:28,574 --> 00:11:30,656
This is how Rost looked like for most of production.

221
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:33,338
This guy, you know, he even snuck into one of the trailers.

222
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:35,499
and we kept using generic Ross,

223
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,939
you know, we kept keeping him generic

224
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,440
because things were staying in flux for the longest time.

225
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,961
And we really waited until stuff

226
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:43,101
was only really coming together,

227
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:44,941
which was really only a couple of months before alpha,

228
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:47,982
before we started selecting the characters like Ross,

229
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:49,983
who needed that bespoke content the most.

230
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:53,423
And then we would start doing, you know,

231
00:11:53,483 --> 00:11:55,524
very specific designs who really nailed

232
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:57,404
who these characters, you know, really were.

233
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:59,705
And in Ross' case, you know,

234
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,246
this is about making him look a bit more paternal

235
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:03,266
than we originally envisioned.

236
00:12:03,864 --> 00:12:07,026
But it was also about communicating his weird relationship with the rest of the tribe.

237
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:10,630
You see, Rost, he's a very kind of conservative, very traditional Noor,

238
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,572
but he's also an outcast from the tribe.

239
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:15,514
So his design is to strike that difficult balance between, you know,

240
00:12:15,574 --> 00:12:17,156
keeping Noor traditions on one hand,

241
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,398
but also separating him from the rest of the tribe.

242
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,260
And if we didn't wait until we had all of that information,

243
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:26,462
you know, his design would not have been as effective,

244
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:28,724
his characterization wouldn't have been as strong,

245
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:31,786
and, you know, the idea of who Ross was

246
00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:33,747
wouldn't have been as clearly communicated to the player.

247
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:36,529
And, of course, as a bonus,

248
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:38,330
because these bespoke characters,

249
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,951
because they're the last characters we made,

250
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:42,112
they're also the best characters we made,

251
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:44,534
because we were able to take and apply everything

252
00:12:44,574 --> 00:12:46,135
that we'd learned from the other several hundred.

253
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,494
So that's how I steered art design

254
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:50,735
towards first star characters.

255
00:12:51,255 --> 00:12:52,816
That's not the only way the characters needed

256
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,437
to be versatile, because of course,

257
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:56,458
when you're done with a character,

258
00:12:56,498 --> 00:12:57,378
when they're all checked in,

259
00:12:57,798 --> 00:13:00,099
you lose total control over how they're used.

260
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,401
So stop me if you've heard this one before.

261
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:05,602
You've been asked for an asset out of blue.

262
00:13:06,282 --> 00:13:07,963
But don't worry, it's a simple request.

263
00:13:08,283 --> 00:13:11,085
This model, he's only seen far, far, far in the background.

264
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,826
He can be super simple, don't spend too long on him.

265
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:14,927
And then one morning, you boot up the game,

266
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:15,447
and you see this.

267
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:16,888
And.

268
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:23,390
This can be frustrating and hilarious, but look at it from the designer's point of view.

269
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,931
He's probably just addressing some kind of critical feedback,

270
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,532
or maybe this wasn't even the designer who made the request.

271
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:32,252
Maybe some other designer needed a character like this,

272
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:35,273
they found this guy in the database and just figured he's a placeholder, you know?

273
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:41,055
These guys, they shouldn't have to work out exactly which characters they use in which context.

274
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:42,735
It's not fair to impose this on them.

275
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:44,856
So once a character was available...

276
00:13:45,712 --> 00:13:47,734
they should be free to use it however they see fit.

277
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,437
So this didn't really happen on Horizon,

278
00:13:50,457 --> 00:13:53,520
because we didn't build the art at different quality grades.

279
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:56,343
Every character had to survive close-up scrutiny,

280
00:13:56,944 --> 00:13:59,686
even this generic dude whose name I don't remember.

281
00:14:01,695 --> 00:14:05,217
So every character that we made was of the same high visual and technical fidelity.

282
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:11,380
So this guy, you know, his design is not as perfect to his characterization as Ross was.

283
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,522
But I can zoom in on this guy just as close as I could do on Ross.

284
00:14:15,642 --> 00:14:17,483
And also you guys can do the same with photo mode.

285
00:14:18,303 --> 00:14:23,326
So another anecdote, you get a request for a cinematic asset.

286
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:25,727
So it's going to be close up to the camera.

287
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:28,168
You make it super detailed and, you know, super expensive.

288
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:33,983
And then one day you boot up the game and someone's filled a city full of them, and the framerate is now in single digits.

289
00:14:35,405 --> 00:14:40,310
But again, not really an issue on the horizon because every character has a very, very similar

290
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,991
performance footprint.

291
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:46,315
Every character gets very cheap as soon as you're not in their face because we're extremely

292
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:49,258
aggressive and extremely consistent with our approach to LODs.

293
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:55,163
So our crowd NPCs who walk around, and those one-off individuals like the guy you just

294
00:14:55,704 --> 00:14:59,828
saw, they're using the exact same pool of models, but the game is clever enough to use

295
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:00,628
them contextually.

296
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:04,700
A crowd NPC, the game knows only to pull in those lower lods,

297
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,081
whereas the same character in a conversation,

298
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:08,642
the game knows how to pull in the full set.

299
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:12,164
By investing all of this time up front,

300
00:15:12,284 --> 00:15:14,545
making the characters technically more robust,

301
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:17,107
the team could use them however they wanted.

302
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:19,048
And that meant that we weren't constantly

303
00:15:19,088 --> 00:15:20,329
spending time maintaining them,

304
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:22,390
which gave us free time at the end of the project

305
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,011
to do more bespoke characters like Rost.

306
00:15:25,812 --> 00:15:28,333
So, how do you get started when you don't know anything?

307
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:31,775
Well, bespoke content is extremely important, but risky.

308
00:15:32,495 --> 00:15:34,356
So start with more versatile content,

309
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:36,237
work up to more specific things later.

310
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:39,239
The more versatile your content is,

311
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,681
the more likely it is to end up in the final product.

312
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:44,062
And though it takes extra time up front

313
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:46,323
making content versatile from a technical perspective,

314
00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:47,944
increases its usefulness

315
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:50,185
and makes life easier for dependent teams.

316
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:54,848
So that's the first and the longest story.

317
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:56,269
The other ones are shorter, I promise you.

318
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,461
That's how we tackled the uncertainty, but what about the scope?

319
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:06,844
You see, we've got the player character, which has a lot of outfits,

320
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:09,146
and we have story characters, and we have quest characters,

321
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,067
we have enemy characters, and we have all the background characters,

322
00:16:11,107 --> 00:16:13,990
and on a game like Killzone, you have about this much work to do,

323
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,151
and on Horizon, it's a bit more like this.

324
00:16:17,332 --> 00:16:19,974
It's a whole lot more stuff to make, but that's not the end of it.

325
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:21,956
You see, we're a first-party studio.

326
00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:24,478
We're there to show off what the hardware can really do,

327
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:27,080
so it's not enough just to make all these guys.

328
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,138
They need to look not only better than anything that we've ever done before,

329
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:33,601
they need to set the bar for open world games.

330
00:16:34,302 --> 00:16:37,265
So, too much stuff, not enough time.

331
00:16:38,627 --> 00:16:41,891
So has anyone here ever worked on a project where they felt they had more time than they needed?

332
00:16:42,872 --> 00:16:43,213
Anyone?

333
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:46,786
You're a lucky dude.

334
00:16:47,627 --> 00:16:48,607
So how did we get more time?

335
00:16:49,788 --> 00:16:50,729
We didn't.

336
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:53,571
We just made sure that we squeezed as much as possible

337
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:54,812
out of what we did have.

338
00:16:55,352 --> 00:16:56,993
And I'm gonna explain this with some fun graphs.

339
00:16:58,194 --> 00:17:01,756
So this is an abstraction of production capacity

340
00:17:01,796 --> 00:17:03,458
from the beginning of a project until its end.

341
00:17:04,218 --> 00:17:06,520
And the vertical axis, that's capacity.

342
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,742
That's how many artists inside and outside the studio

343
00:17:10,022 --> 00:17:11,623
which I can keep busy making characters.

344
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:13,645
And you see, there's a ramp up.

345
00:17:14,678 --> 00:17:16,198
whilst we're figuring stuff out in pre-pro,

346
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:19,239
and there's a ramp down as we put the brakes on new content

347
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:20,780
and transition to book fixing.

348
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,940
And this is important because this shaded area in the middle,

349
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:26,561
this is literally how many characters

350
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:27,681
are we gonna be able to make.

351
00:17:29,422 --> 00:17:31,683
If this red space is how many characters we're making,

352
00:17:31,703 --> 00:17:35,504
the negative space is how many we aren't but could be.

353
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:38,464
And our potential capacity is quite high.

354
00:17:38,585 --> 00:17:40,525
I can get hold of quite a lot of artists if I like.

355
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:43,126
So this adds up very, very quickly.

356
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:49,511
In an open world game like Horizon, the scope is something which adds value to the player

357
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:51,312
experience in a very direct way.

358
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:55,395
Not just in the sense of here's some more different things for you to look at.

359
00:17:56,295 --> 00:18:00,737
If we can do more characters, we can do more distinct cultures, we can do more variation

360
00:18:00,797 --> 00:18:05,020
within and without, we can make each culture and the world really feel alive.

361
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:08,786
If we can do more characters, we can do more bespoke content.

362
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:13,087
We can do more of those important one-off moments and story characters like Rost.

363
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:18,108
So, like, my plan was, I'm going to claim as much of this white space as possible.

364
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:20,589
But, I mean, that sounds pretty obvious, right?

365
00:18:21,469 --> 00:18:23,329
But it's something I had to constantly sell.

366
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,510
You see, remember our old friend uncertainty?

367
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,050
Uncertainty creates this tendency to be cautious.

368
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,371
And it's very easy to start just eroding this volume

369
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,852
with lots of small, very reasonable decisions.

370
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:39,066
So I hypothetical, let's say there's this cool new procedural texturing tool.

371
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:42,567
So let's experiment, let's get the workflow locked down before we commit to full production.

372
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:46,488
And that's not the end of the world, but now the tools guys,

373
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:48,588
they want to refactor the export pipeline.

374
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:51,669
So let's wait for things to settle before we get stuck in.

375
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:54,430
And certainly days, the writing and design teams,

376
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,450
they don't really know what they need.

377
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,910
Let's wait for things to settle a bit.

378
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,871
Let's wait for some asset requests to come in.

379
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,553
And you see all of these things, they add up very quickly, you know.

380
00:19:03,294 --> 00:19:06,297
So how to solve this? Well, I didn't really solve it.

381
00:19:06,557 --> 00:19:09,559
I just had to learn to tolerate that uncomfortable feeling that came with the

382
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:12,181
uncertainty and just commit to things regardless.

383
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:17,426
We had to just get stuck in. Now I'm not dismissing those examples, you know.

384
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:21,149
We did research that procedural technology, we were constantly pinging

385
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:23,951
the other teams to get that updated design and story info,

386
00:19:24,492 --> 00:19:27,694
but we didn't need to wait until we had this information before we got stuck in

387
00:19:27,714 --> 00:19:28,175
and scaled up.

388
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:31,315
But you might be thinking, you know, isn't this risky?

389
00:19:32,395 --> 00:19:34,756
Couldn't you waste time by making things

390
00:19:35,116 --> 00:19:36,157
that you're not gonna end up using?

391
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:39,438
Well, not really, because there's an opportunity cost

392
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,479
at play, you know, this time is wasted

393
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:42,559
by not being utilized.

394
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:44,680
If we do make something in that time,

395
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,560
and there is a good chance of it being used,

396
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:48,721
then on the whole, we're gonna have a lot more characters.

397
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:51,202
And of course, what is the best way to increase the odds

398
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:52,523
of that content being utilized?

399
00:19:53,003 --> 00:19:55,004
Like Bruce said, by making them like water,

400
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:57,104
you know, by making them as versatile as possible.

401
00:19:58,145 --> 00:20:01,986
So on horizon we had 0 wasted characters.

402
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:05,507
Probably should have done a pun there.

403
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:08,288
And everyone we made, they were used in the game.

404
00:20:09,428 --> 00:20:11,189
Not always how we might have originally thought,

405
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:15,370
but always in a way that kind of added something to the player experience.

406
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,491
So that's how we could go from this to this.

407
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,732
You know, we made smart choices about what to make and in what order,

408
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:23,573
which got us starting faster and earlier.

409
00:20:24,227 --> 00:20:27,048
and we did more work up front making the content more technically robust,

410
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:29,589
which frees us up at the end to do extra stuff.

411
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,010
So how can you find the time to do everything?

412
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:34,451
Well, claim that white space.

413
00:20:34,471 --> 00:20:36,832
You know, make sure you're using all of the time you have available

414
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:38,453
to its fullest potential.

415
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:41,113
Learn to tolerate that feeling of uncertainty

416
00:20:41,494 --> 00:20:43,294
and ignore it if it's just you being irrational.

417
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:45,415
And don't wait for new information.

418
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:46,576
Don't wait for new technology.

419
00:20:47,156 --> 00:20:49,277
Use what you have now and adapt later.

420
00:20:50,924 --> 00:20:54,166
So, you know, that's how we were able to finish everything.

421
00:20:56,748 --> 00:20:59,109
But if you're serving other teams like we are,

422
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:01,291
you know, if you're providing other teams with content,

423
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:03,512
it's not enough to just get everything finished

424
00:21:03,532 --> 00:21:04,173
before you ship.

425
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:07,035
Because the rest of the team is still working

426
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:08,576
in order to do their work.

427
00:21:08,616 --> 00:21:10,537
They need characters, they need characters now.

428
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,739
And we need to get them what they need,

429
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,860
when they needed it, or even before.

430
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:18,233
And this is pretty difficult for our content creation teams,

431
00:21:18,554 --> 00:21:19,514
because most of these other teams,

432
00:21:19,755 --> 00:21:21,736
they're going to be using some mode of Agile development.

433
00:21:21,876 --> 00:21:25,299
You know, they're going to be doing continuous, short,

434
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,821
iterative cycles punctuated by play tests.

435
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:30,824
And this is pretty incompatible with the ideal flow

436
00:21:30,844 --> 00:21:31,905
for our content creation,

437
00:21:32,345 --> 00:21:36,128
where you're doing these long, slow, methodical processes,

438
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:38,410
which are not really fitting nicely

439
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,631
into these Agile development loops.

440
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:46,237
So, you know, any artists here ever been pressured to cut corners and compromise quality to squeeze a model into a sprint?

441
00:21:46,878 --> 00:21:47,158
Anyone?

442
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:48,739
Yeah?

443
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,724
And any producers here ever been frustrated by artists giving you multi-month estimates, refusing to budge?

444
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,087
So, what do you do?

445
00:21:58,268 --> 00:21:59,569
Well, if you zoom in on those blocks...

446
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,741
You know, you get a little bit closer to them.

447
00:22:01,761 --> 00:22:03,661
You actually find that there are a mix of tasks

448
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:04,902
and some are agile.

449
00:22:05,362 --> 00:22:07,962
So anything design related, for instance,

450
00:22:08,002 --> 00:22:10,823
you know, you're testing stuff out as quickly as possible.

451
00:22:11,223 --> 00:22:12,844
You're seeing if it works and you more or less,

452
00:22:12,884 --> 00:22:14,364
you know, just rinse, repeat that process.

453
00:22:15,184 --> 00:22:17,625
Whereas things like game mesh creation,

454
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:19,086
these things are really waterfall.

455
00:22:19,126 --> 00:22:20,926
You know, the work is not very subjective.

456
00:22:21,386 --> 00:22:22,907
It takes a predictable amount of time

457
00:22:23,267 --> 00:22:24,627
and the goals and outcome are pretty clear.

458
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:26,748
You know, you can pretty much do this in one go.

459
00:22:27,803 --> 00:22:30,344
And fortunately, those fast, agile, friendly bits,

460
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:31,685
they're mostly at the beginning.

461
00:22:32,065 --> 00:22:34,906
And the slower, methodical bits, they're mostly at the end.

462
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:38,288
So what we did is we worked in those early subjective bits

463
00:22:38,328 --> 00:22:39,708
into the sprints everyone else was running,

464
00:22:40,188 --> 00:22:40,929
which kept them fed.

465
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:43,470
And that meant we could take our time on the rest.

466
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,171
So let's look at this in practice.

467
00:22:46,611 --> 00:22:48,592
Making a high-poly model is about solving

468
00:22:48,632 --> 00:22:49,873
a couple of very different problems.

469
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,791
So we've worked to get the shape and the form and the volume right, you know,

470
00:22:53,811 --> 00:22:57,052
essentially nailing the essence of the concept design in 3D.

471
00:22:57,753 --> 00:22:59,133
And this process, you know,

472
00:22:59,153 --> 00:23:03,855
it's very subjective in these lots of iterations and it's suited to agile

473
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:08,137
processes. Whereas a high poly also needs material expression,

474
00:23:08,157 --> 00:23:09,558
it needs detail, it needs construction.

475
00:23:09,878 --> 00:23:12,219
These things are all very time consuming. They're all very careful.

476
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,780
These things are not suited to agile.

477
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,596
Making a design change at this point is destructive, it's time consuming.

478
00:23:21,418 --> 00:23:26,285
So what we did is we broke the task in two, we speed sculpted the design, we handled the rest as a separate pass.

479
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:31,574
And the great thing about this was it got the character to the rest of the team extremely quick.

480
00:23:32,863 --> 00:23:35,805
because we very very quickly convert it into a proxy model and get it into the game.

481
00:23:35,825 --> 00:23:38,746
Now these models, they look pretty crude,

482
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:41,327
but they actually clear all of our dependencies.

483
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:46,089
It's visually representative of those characters for design and playtesting.

484
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:50,091
So these characters are recognizable, they're distinct, even if they look a little bit Play-Doh.

485
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:54,112
And tech animation, you know, they can do rigging, they can do simulation.

486
00:23:54,612 --> 00:23:58,174
Animators are getting a good representation of volume, form and weight.

487
00:23:58,814 --> 00:23:59,955
But the most important thing...

488
00:24:00,551 --> 00:24:03,577
is that because we made the poly counts, we made the shaders and textures,

489
00:24:04,098 --> 00:24:06,422
all these things are representative of the final content.

490
00:24:06,883 --> 00:24:10,810
This proxy model and the final model performance-wise,

491
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,913
it's essentially a like-for-like replacement.

492
00:24:14,325 --> 00:24:15,886
So tech can now more relaxed, you know.

493
00:24:16,326 --> 00:24:18,227
There's not gonna be this performance apocalypse

494
00:24:18,268 --> 00:24:19,108
at the end of production,

495
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:21,309
when all of this content gets integrated

496
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:22,470
all the end at once.

497
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,431
So that meant they were willing to let content

498
00:24:25,471 --> 00:24:27,673
be integrated much later than they would have otherwise,

499
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,274
and in much higher volumes.

500
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:31,195
And that's how we got, you know,

501
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:32,615
even more stuff done at the end of production.

502
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:37,249
So this approach is good because it gets us off the critical path really quickly.

503
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:42,292
When other teams have a proxy, which fills their every need, this removes the pressure

504
00:24:42,332 --> 00:24:44,293
on us to deliver that final content.

505
00:24:45,294 --> 00:24:49,016
Lead times are now less of an issue, so we get more flexibility with deadlines.

506
00:24:49,877 --> 00:24:55,420
We needed some finished characters to meet internal milestones or for demos or for trailers,

507
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,602
but other than that we pretty much just had to get the rest of the cast on the disc before

508
00:24:59,622 --> 00:25:00,363
they started printing them.

509
00:25:01,927 --> 00:25:04,268
And that meant that we could give every single character,

510
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:05,488
every single one of them,

511
00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:07,309
the time it needed to be excellent.

512
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:12,091
So how can you work agile without compromising quality?

513
00:25:12,491 --> 00:25:15,192
Well, the trick is to work out which part of the workflow

514
00:25:15,672 --> 00:25:16,633
agile and which bits aren't,

515
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:19,214
and then only apply agile methodologies where it makes sense.

516
00:25:20,494 --> 00:25:21,735
Use proxy content to meet the needs

517
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:24,476
of dependent departments as quickly as possible.

518
00:25:24,896 --> 00:25:26,937
Because if you can quickly meet the needs of other people's,

519
00:25:27,637 --> 00:25:29,558
sorry, if you can quickly meet the needs of other team.

520
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:33,151
you get all the time that you need to make every single asset good.

521
00:25:34,312 --> 00:25:38,095
So proxies, you know, they're a great way to handle these content requests.

522
00:25:40,897 --> 00:25:41,998
We were getting a lot of requests.

523
00:25:42,979 --> 00:25:45,561
Most of these quests, you know, they have at least a half dozen characters.

524
00:25:46,141 --> 00:25:48,603
Pretty much all of them come with some kind of special requirement.

525
00:25:48,623 --> 00:25:51,406
And that's just quests, you know, we've got enemies, we've got player outfits,

526
00:25:51,446 --> 00:25:52,266
all kinds of other stuff.

527
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:54,288
So, you know, that's where all these guys come from.

528
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,362
As I'm sure you've experienced yourselves, everyone always needs everything at once.

529
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:03,383
And you can't do it all at once, so you have to work out some kind of order.

530
00:26:04,364 --> 00:26:07,745
And the most obvious way to prioritize is by how important things are.

531
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:13,787
This is pretty easy to quantify, it's critical path stuff, the things which are central to

532
00:26:13,807 --> 00:26:14,488
the experience.

533
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:18,969
On Horizon, that's core mechanics, player character, main narrative.

534
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,192
But the other thing we had to account for was our old friend uncertainty.

535
00:26:22,732 --> 00:26:26,535
So to avoid wasting time, we started with the things which were most important,

536
00:26:26,855 --> 00:26:28,116
but also the most certain.

537
00:26:29,577 --> 00:26:31,498
Let's look at some of these requests that we got for Aloy.

538
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,540
We got a lot of requests.

539
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:39,804
So this is every feature, addition, gizmo that I was asked at Aloy,

540
00:26:40,324 --> 00:26:42,586
and all of her costumes at one point in development.

541
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:44,788
And clearly not all of these made it,

542
00:26:45,148 --> 00:26:47,289
and thankfully we avoided spending a lot of time on these things

543
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,231
by prioritizing the most certain.

544
00:26:50,844 --> 00:26:52,987
But how do we know which bits were more certain or less certain?

545
00:26:53,648 --> 00:26:57,454
Well, with experience you do kind of get a sixth sense for like how, what is going to work.

546
00:26:58,155 --> 00:27:01,119
But you have to be really careful about relying on your intuition.

547
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:05,696
because prototypes and playtests, they have this tendency to constantly surprise you.

548
00:27:05,736 --> 00:27:07,077
I mean, that's kind of the whole point of them.

549
00:27:07,737 --> 00:27:10,038
So my approach was that for any asset, it didn't really matter what,

550
00:27:10,138 --> 00:27:12,639
we'd immediately offer to create some kind of proxy content,

551
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:15,140
and it's normally led to one of the following outcomes, you know.

552
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:18,322
Often the feature or request, it just works as intended, awesome.

553
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:20,843
But sometimes, you know, the request evolves,

554
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:24,505
we iterate as we need to, we wait for things to settle,

555
00:27:24,605 --> 00:27:26,206
and then we make the final content.

556
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,801
Sometimes the proxy though, it just goes unused.

557
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:30,562
Maybe the feature got cut.

558
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:32,724
Maybe another team didn't have time to work on it.

559
00:27:33,044 --> 00:27:33,764
But it doesn't really matter,

560
00:27:33,784 --> 00:27:35,225
because we didn't actually spend that much time on it.

561
00:27:36,586 --> 00:27:39,108
And sometimes, rarely, the requestee just doesn't

562
00:27:39,128 --> 00:27:40,669
take us up on the offer to make a proxy.

563
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:42,550
And I found that this is generally a good sign

564
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,111
that feature is never going to see the light of day.

565
00:27:44,592 --> 00:27:45,912
So those things we deprioritize.

566
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:52,095
And I found that informal techniques like this are much more reliable than just blindly following production documentation.

567
00:27:52,556 --> 00:27:54,518
So this is an experience I'm sure most of you can share.

568
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:57,761
I've learned to be a little bit skeptical of these tracking systems.

569
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,784
You know, they're often inaccurate or out of date.

570
00:28:00,244 --> 00:28:04,349
The requests normally lack context or are missing some kind of critical information.

571
00:28:05,244 --> 00:28:07,085
And this is my favorite example.

572
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,047
Okay, so there's a killzone level.

573
00:28:09,768 --> 00:28:12,330
It's centered around a 100-foot statue, okay?

574
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,532
And your objective is to infiltrate the complex

575
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:16,273
inside the 100-foot statue.

576
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:18,175
And at the end of the level,

577
00:28:18,635 --> 00:28:20,116
there's a big set piece, you know,

578
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,738
where you blow up that 100-foot statue.

579
00:28:22,358 --> 00:28:23,980
And not a single producer identified

580
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,961
that we needed to build the 100-foot statue.

581
00:28:28,152 --> 00:28:32,714
It was just so obvious that everyone had just assumed that someone else had tracked it somewhere else.

582
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:36,777
And as hilarious as that mistake was, it's perfectly reasonable.

583
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:39,959
Like, trying to log every little bit of work on a project like Horizon,

584
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:44,342
which has a million moving parts and hundreds of independent actors doing their own thing,

585
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:45,422
it's insane.

586
00:28:46,263 --> 00:28:48,504
It's unreasonable to expect someone to do it perfectly.

587
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:52,026
So I gave them a hand by being proactive.

588
00:28:52,427 --> 00:28:55,248
So whilst I did pay attention to those tracking systems, I didn't ignore them.

589
00:28:56,104 --> 00:28:58,845
But I found it far more important to pay attention to the ground truth,

590
00:28:58,965 --> 00:29:00,906
which was to play the game every single day.

591
00:29:00,926 --> 00:29:04,628
You know, so I put my trust in what I could see in the game.

592
00:29:05,148 --> 00:29:08,089
I trusted my own judgment on how the existing content was going to work out.

593
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:12,591
And doing this, you know, I was able to identify work that we were going to need to do

594
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:16,893
and start it and sometimes finish it long before anyone even noticed there was an issue.

595
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,103
I found the best way to do this, the best way to approach this, is you have to shift

596
00:29:22,123 --> 00:29:22,824
your perspective.

597
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,767
You have to stop looking at the game as a developer and try and experience it as a player.

598
00:29:27,068 --> 00:29:29,089
It's important to taste your own dog food.

599
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:33,793
So I caught literally hundreds of things this way and if I hadn't those things would have

600
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:34,534
just not been in the game.

601
00:29:36,678 --> 00:29:37,958
So how can you prioritize?

602
00:29:38,058 --> 00:29:40,059
Well, start with the things which are most critical

603
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:41,539
and also the most likely.

604
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,380
Use project planning tools,

605
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,400
but with some healthy skepticism.

606
00:29:46,341 --> 00:29:47,981
And play the game every single day.

607
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:49,982
Track issues and tasks yourself

608
00:29:50,462 --> 00:29:52,623
and solve issues before people even become aware of them.

609
00:29:54,423 --> 00:29:54,703
All right.

610
00:29:57,764 --> 00:29:59,325
So we're at the end of point four.

611
00:29:59,545 --> 00:30:01,885
I've mostly been droning on about production stuff.

612
00:30:03,256 --> 00:30:05,999
I reckon at least a couple of you in the room are probably thinking a bit, feeling a bit

613
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:06,380
misled.

614
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,822
You know, this is on the visual arts track, why are you talking about production?

615
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:14,409
Well my philosophy is that process and outcome, they're part of the same thing.

616
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:16,511
You know, they kind of exist on the same continuum.

617
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,721
And if you want to be the person who is directing the outcome,

618
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:22,323
you can't wholly delegate process.

619
00:30:22,543 --> 00:30:24,283
And on game development, that process

620
00:30:24,424 --> 00:30:28,225
does involve a lot of strategy and planning, collaboration,

621
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:29,546
team building.

622
00:30:30,466 --> 00:30:33,167
So in my experience, the most effective approach

623
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,988
to creative leadership is a holistic one,

624
00:30:35,448 --> 00:30:36,709
which does incorporate these things

625
00:30:36,729 --> 00:30:39,710
like planning and production alongside creative direction.

626
00:30:40,711 --> 00:30:42,632
But enough production for now.

627
00:30:42,672 --> 00:30:44,252
Let's do some creative direction.

628
00:30:46,994 --> 00:30:50,317
Everything that we've talked about so far has been pretty methodical.

629
00:30:51,878 --> 00:30:55,641
And in keeping we have a pretty methodical approach to our visual design.

630
00:30:56,302 --> 00:30:58,484
Art design is essentially an exercise in communication.

631
00:30:58,964 --> 00:31:01,927
Whatever you're creating must effectively communicate your intent.

632
00:31:02,687 --> 00:31:04,789
But as we have hundreds of people working together,

633
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,072
how do we make sure that these guys, they're all seen to the same him sheet?

634
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,872
We have this focusing device which we call the four pillars.

635
00:31:13,452 --> 00:31:17,134
And these are the key themes, the main ideas around which the premise is built.

636
00:31:17,674 --> 00:31:20,275
You know, it's these first four videos that I showed you,

637
00:31:20,355 --> 00:31:23,376
this beautiful post-apocalyptic world,

638
00:31:23,737 --> 00:31:25,878
you know, these animalistic machines,

639
00:31:26,358 --> 00:31:28,859
the diverse tribes, and of course Aloy.

640
00:31:30,308 --> 00:31:35,671
So anything that anyone asks of the game, it needs to enhance these pillars and not detract from them.

641
00:31:36,492 --> 00:31:39,194
And this is how we work out if something is horizon-y.

642
00:31:40,575 --> 00:31:43,977
As of themselves though, these are not things that I can directly apply to the characters.

643
00:31:44,637 --> 00:31:49,661
So let's examine them and deconstruct them and see if we can translate them into something that's a bit more applicable.

644
00:31:51,262 --> 00:31:51,922
The whole point...

645
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:58,182
of that beautiful, natural, post-post-apocalyptic world is that it's vibrant.

646
00:31:59,303 --> 00:32:06,626
Life perseveres. It's optimistic. So to reflect that pillar, we want characters who are equally

647
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:10,928
vibrant. Diversity is something that's also fairly self-explanatory.

648
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:15,351
The archetypical example in Horizon is, of course, the machines, who are this new

649
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:16,971
and diverse form of life.

650
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:22,934
Horizon is a game that celebrates the difference and the unexpected.

651
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:28,577
So obviously we want tribes to be very different from one another in ways which are complex

652
00:32:28,617 --> 00:32:29,218
and unexpected.

653
00:32:30,811 --> 00:32:32,412
Contrast between the old and the new,

654
00:32:33,032 --> 00:32:34,713
this one is super important.

655
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:35,974
In my opinion, this is the key

656
00:32:36,014 --> 00:32:37,434
to making things feel horizon-y.

657
00:32:38,135 --> 00:32:40,236
So these kind of animalistic machines,

658
00:32:40,756 --> 00:32:43,177
that kind of contrast is the archetypical example of this,

659
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:44,758
but it's a critical theme

660
00:32:44,818 --> 00:32:46,659
and it needs to come across to the characters as well.

661
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,361
And finally, David and Goliath,

662
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,602
this sense of overcoming impossible odds.

663
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:55,244
We need to show those tribes and Aloy as underdogs

664
00:32:55,664 --> 00:32:57,825
in order to really sell the power of those machines.

665
00:32:59,202 --> 00:33:00,523
So having these ideas outlined,

666
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:03,864
it gives us some sort of metric for what is right, you know?

667
00:33:04,304 --> 00:33:06,465
So if I were to add detail X on a character,

668
00:33:06,845 --> 00:33:08,326
and someone else, they disagree.

669
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:11,908
We can discuss this objectively over them what is,

670
00:33:11,928 --> 00:33:13,888
you know, just what our personal tastes are.

671
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:16,189
You know, this isn't foolproof,

672
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,270
but we're able to skip a lot of those

673
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,491
familiar circular arguments.

674
00:33:21,131 --> 00:33:24,433
So let's run through this methodical design process

675
00:33:24,873 --> 00:33:26,754
for a tribe's visual identity.

676
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,689
And this is going to be the Cliff Notes version of how we approach the Loyal Tribe.

677
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:34,213
So let's start at the very beginning.

678
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:36,354
Let's look at some of those assumptions we get

679
00:33:36,374 --> 00:33:37,694
from the writers, like I showed you earlier.

680
00:33:38,694 --> 00:33:40,414
What do we know about the Lenoir tribe

681
00:33:40,434 --> 00:33:41,534
at the start of pre-production?

682
00:33:42,295 --> 00:33:44,975
Well, their core identity is that these guys

683
00:33:44,995 --> 00:33:46,815
are gonna be survivalist hunter-gatherers.

684
00:33:47,856 --> 00:33:50,856
And they're the first tribe the player encounters, okay?

685
00:33:51,636 --> 00:33:54,477
So in order to introduce this interesting contrast

686
00:33:54,557 --> 00:33:57,277
between the advanced machines, underdog humans early,

687
00:33:57,877 --> 00:34:00,498
we're gonna make these guys relatively low-tech.

688
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:08,283
And because these guys are the first tribe, you know, this is where the player is going to be learning the robot hunting.

689
00:34:08,303 --> 00:34:11,625
This is where they're going to, these are the guys who are going to be doing the tutorials for robot hunting.

690
00:34:12,206 --> 00:34:16,748
So in order to be able to teach the player, they need to be expert machine hunters,

691
00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:21,251
but because they're low-tech expert machine hunters, we're hitting that David and Goliath theme.

692
00:34:22,953 --> 00:34:24,914
And we know where the game starts, you know, it's the Rocky Mountains.

693
00:34:25,334 --> 00:34:28,975
This is really useful because from this we get climate, we get material culture,

694
00:34:29,495 --> 00:34:31,376
all kinds of other useful assumptions for which to start.

695
00:34:32,476 --> 00:34:34,397
And our first main point of reference is these mountain men.

696
00:34:34,877 --> 00:34:36,958
So these guys are appropriate for the climate.

697
00:34:37,258 --> 00:34:38,979
They kind of embody that survivor's aspect.

698
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:41,740
This is a pretty good starting point.

699
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,100
We start doing early exploratory sketches in Parallel.

700
00:34:44,621 --> 00:34:47,081
And these guys, you know, they embody that hunter-survivor's role.

701
00:34:47,782 --> 00:34:51,044
But they're not really right. They're not really hitting any of those key themes

702
00:34:51,905 --> 00:34:54,647
These guys, you know, they're too literal to the reference

703
00:34:56,228 --> 00:35:01,191
These guys are too sophisticated for a low-tech culture. So let's let's focus in on that material culture

704
00:35:01,311 --> 00:35:04,714
This is a good way to tackle this. These guys are they're hunter-gatherers

705
00:35:04,794 --> 00:35:06,535
Okay, so they're not going to do a lot of farming

706
00:35:06,895 --> 00:35:12,299
This means that they have little to no textiles and their primary materials for garments. They're going to be hides

707
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,181
They're going to be pelts. They're going to be leathers

708
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:19,094
But we have now a conflict with one of our pillars, okay?

709
00:35:19,835 --> 00:35:22,579
You see, in order to have pelts, you need to have animals.

710
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,223
There's this big discussion in the studio, you know,

711
00:35:25,283 --> 00:35:27,547
should the world of Horizon have living animals?

712
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:29,911
Because on the one hand, you know...

713
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:33,734
There's an argument to be made that having living animals

714
00:35:33,814 --> 00:35:35,916
competes with the primacy of the artificial life.

715
00:35:36,556 --> 00:35:39,299
But on the other hand, we need to feed and clothe the tribes.

716
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:41,380
So we reach a compromise.

717
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:45,103
Animals can stay, but so as to not compete with the robots,

718
00:35:45,764 --> 00:35:48,065
any animal over a certain size is now extinct.

719
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:49,727
So we have to make the garments

720
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:51,408
from stitching smaller hides together.

721
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:54,611
So we've made a bit of progress now,

722
00:35:54,691 --> 00:35:56,292
but something's still missing.

723
00:35:56,892 --> 00:35:59,054
Was design work is now appropriate for the environment.

724
00:35:59,582 --> 00:36:02,685
but we're still not really embodying a lot of those key themes I identified earlier.

725
00:36:03,225 --> 00:36:06,608
And there's nothing about these guys as well that kind of makes them particular to the world of Horizon.

726
00:36:06,648 --> 00:36:09,391
You know, they're only about a step or two removed from Vikings.

727
00:36:10,071 --> 00:36:13,194
So we'd had our nose far too close to this material culture

728
00:36:13,695 --> 00:36:16,557
and had kind of forgotten these guys were hunting robots.

729
00:36:16,617 --> 00:36:20,541
These machines, you know, they're a threat, but they're also an opportunity.

730
00:36:21,201 --> 00:36:23,924
A low-tech culture is going to have all kinds of uses for the materials

731
00:36:23,944 --> 00:36:25,685
that they can strip off one of these damn machines.

732
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:30,968
So this opens up a wealth of new opportunities to hit some of those key themes.

733
00:36:32,269 --> 00:36:37,475
You know, starting by mixing modern and natural through adding some of these robot materials to the characters.

734
00:36:37,675 --> 00:36:40,298
So it took a lot of exploration to get this right.

735
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:44,293
This is one of our first attempts and these guys are really not very successful.

736
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:48,356
Nothing really fit the character, there's no kind of practicality here.

737
00:36:49,097 --> 00:36:52,359
So we start thinking more about function, you know, why are these guys using the robot bits?

738
00:36:52,979 --> 00:36:55,621
And by this point, you know, the writers have established that the Nora,

739
00:36:55,641 --> 00:36:57,583
they don't really have any particular reverence for the robots.

740
00:36:58,243 --> 00:37:03,507
So these guys are going to be using them purely practically, as armor for instance.

741
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:09,995
But working this out is tricky, okay, because if I make these robot pieces fit a person too well,

742
00:37:10,515 --> 00:37:13,578
you know, it looks too deliberate, it looks like they were designed for that person.

743
00:37:13,978 --> 00:37:18,182
You've basically designed a mech suit, you know, we need that contrast between the old and the new.

744
00:37:19,343 --> 00:37:22,165
But if the way that these things are applied, you know, it looks too improvised,

745
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:25,868
it makes the Nora look like they're careless and messy,

746
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:28,651
we're not kind of hitting that expert machine hunter note.

747
00:37:29,644 --> 00:37:30,864
So it took a lot of ideation.

748
00:37:31,305 --> 00:37:33,825
Eventually we solved this by striking the balance

749
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:37,686
by using intricate configurations of these smaller plates.

750
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:40,647
But we're still missing vibrancy

751
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:42,248
because these natural materials,

752
00:37:43,148 --> 00:37:45,268
they're only providing a very, very limited palette.

753
00:37:46,589 --> 00:37:48,209
So we start thinking about maybe how we can use

754
00:37:48,229 --> 00:37:49,710
these robot parts to this effect.

755
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,950
And we start by just taking small elements

756
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,571
like bronze or gold connectors

757
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:56,992
and use these things as accents, as jewelry.

758
00:37:58,339 --> 00:37:59,640
And then we also add in these cables,

759
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,501
especially these really, really colourful anodised ones,

760
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:04,021
you know, that have this kind of silvery luster.

761
00:38:05,962 --> 00:38:07,763
And then what we did, we interwoven these things

762
00:38:07,783 --> 00:38:09,683
with similar cables made from natural materials,

763
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:11,944
and we get to this juxtaposition

764
00:38:11,964 --> 00:38:14,685
of the same shape language, but with different materials.

765
00:38:14,785 --> 00:38:16,326
You know, it helps to make the robot elements

766
00:38:16,366 --> 00:38:18,707
look less foreign, so we get our contrast,

767
00:38:19,147 --> 00:38:21,008
but in a way which isn't abrasive.

768
00:38:22,712 --> 00:38:28,875
And that's the really abbreviated version, but that's how we kind of worked out the main motifs for the Nora visual design.

769
00:38:29,495 --> 00:38:32,977
And because we approached this methodically, there were a lot fewer dead ends.

770
00:38:33,217 --> 00:38:36,438
We knew very quickly if something was working or if something was missing.

771
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:40,860
And this methodical approach went beyond designing the individual tribes.

772
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:45,883
Because in order to make the tribes distinct, before we designed any of them,

773
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:49,084
we roughly mapped out what the core identity of each tribe would be

774
00:38:49,585 --> 00:38:51,085
and what the main force of shaping them would be.

775
00:38:51,808 --> 00:38:56,029
And by planning out things like location, climate, cultural development, technological

776
00:38:56,069 --> 00:39:00,530
sophistication, all these things in advance, we knew that even though we couldn't be sure

777
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,631
exactly how they would end up, we knew that they would be distinct.

778
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,412
So if art is subjective, how can you know what is right?

779
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:12,532
Well, you don't need to know everything, but you do need to know what your work is really

780
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:13,253
about, okay?

781
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:18,554
And I don't mean in a mechanical way, like what the plot is, I mean the overarching themes,

782
00:39:18,894 --> 00:39:20,274
the ideas in the premise.

783
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:24,920
Work through your designs one step at a time,

784
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,981
making sure that your conclusions are internally consistent

785
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:30,262
and logical, but more important,

786
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:33,404
that these things embody the key themes

787
00:39:33,444 --> 00:39:34,884
and communicate them very clearly to the player.

788
00:39:36,545 --> 00:39:39,906
So yeah, once again, that was the super short version.

789
00:39:42,408 --> 00:39:44,729
And I kind of focused on the successes to save time.

790
00:39:46,368 --> 00:39:50,991
Which is pretty misleading, because I gave the impression that this was a lot easier than it was.

791
00:39:51,652 --> 00:39:53,593
And it really, really wasn't easy.

792
00:39:54,573 --> 00:39:57,335
So, when I show you that process as a story, it looks all fine and good,

793
00:39:57,355 --> 00:39:59,556
because you get a nice beginning, middle and end, you know?

794
00:40:00,057 --> 00:40:02,318
But being in the middle of that is something else entirely.

795
00:40:02,918 --> 00:40:06,401
It was frustrating and difficult, and at times I thought it was never going to end.

796
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:09,803
We generated so much material, I couldn't possibly show it to you all.

797
00:40:09,823 --> 00:40:11,424
This is just like a small selection I grabbed.

798
00:40:11,444 --> 00:40:13,965
But you see, in reality...

799
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,905
Design is about trying to find your way to some kind of end goal, because you often don't

800
00:40:18,925 --> 00:40:20,367
know what that end goal is until you reach it.

801
00:40:21,368 --> 00:40:23,952
And even then, sometimes when you do reach it, you're still not sure.

802
00:40:25,313 --> 00:40:28,978
So our process, it's less of a roadmap and it's more of an evolutionary tree.

803
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:32,966
Normally we have some kind of jumping off point, like those assumptions.

804
00:40:33,646 --> 00:40:35,126
So we generate some ideas, okay?

805
00:40:35,407 --> 00:40:37,047
And our concept guides, they're great.

806
00:40:37,287 --> 00:40:38,748
So all of these ideas, they're great.

807
00:40:39,328 --> 00:40:41,669
But we have to choose what to commit to.

808
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:43,129
You know, we have to start making decisions.

809
00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:45,510
Again, not picking between good or bad ideas.

810
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:50,031
We're selecting ideas on how effective they are at encompassing that original intent,

811
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:53,933
as well as how complementary they are with the other decisions that we've made.

812
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,512
And this process just basically continues.

813
00:40:56,752 --> 00:41:02,216
We ideate, we make decisions, we ideate, we make decisions,

814
00:41:02,336 --> 00:41:04,457
and then at some point you just have to kind of stop

815
00:41:05,158 --> 00:41:05,778
when you're feeling it.

816
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:09,441
But committing to things, super important,

817
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:11,382
because it creates this positive feedback loop.

818
00:41:12,082 --> 00:41:13,143
The more decisions you make,

819
00:41:13,523 --> 00:41:15,144
the easier it is to make even more decisions,

820
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:17,126
because you can base them on the decisions you've just made.

821
00:41:17,826 --> 00:41:19,207
You get this snowballing phenomenon

822
00:41:19,507 --> 00:41:21,168
called the cone of uncertainty.

823
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:25,216
Which is basically that as you make decisions over time,

824
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,238
the number of possibilities decrease,

825
00:41:27,858 --> 00:41:29,459
which means that certainty increases,

826
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,502
and then it's easier to make progress and do useful work.

827
00:41:33,502 --> 00:41:36,104
And on the beginning of a new IP like Horizon,

828
00:41:36,364 --> 00:41:38,246
those possibilities, they're endless.

829
00:41:38,586 --> 00:41:39,607
We could have done anything.

830
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:42,809
So it's very easy to feel lost and hopeless,

831
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,671
and it felt a lot more comfortable to play it safe

832
00:41:45,732 --> 00:41:46,792
and just not commit to anything.

833
00:41:47,313 --> 00:41:49,334
But I just had to ignore this and just start making decisions

834
00:41:49,354 --> 00:41:51,056
because it's literally the only way to make progress.

835
00:41:52,518 --> 00:41:56,362
But those decisions, they can be pretty hard because it often feels like you're throwing

836
00:41:56,402 --> 00:41:57,683
away great ideas.

837
00:41:58,384 --> 00:42:03,770
This guy, he's a tech priest from when the guys were just working on the premise.

838
00:42:04,651 --> 00:42:08,434
The story changed a lot and this guy got cut because he no longer fit.

839
00:42:09,035 --> 00:42:16,358
But his design was so strong and it had so many great ideas that just some of the themes and ideas just kept re-emerging.

840
00:42:16,378 --> 00:42:19,399
You know, the robes and the colours, they influenced a very similar Mesa priest.

841
00:42:19,939 --> 00:42:23,720
The Paron logo that's stitched on his sleeves, you know, we adapted this for the Eclipse cult

842
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,562
and this iconography just made a hell of a lot more sense for these guys.

843
00:42:27,242 --> 00:42:28,922
You know, and the cable stitched into his flesh.

844
00:42:29,403 --> 00:42:31,403
You know, we incorporated these into the Banuk shamans

845
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:36,165
and the writing team then, you know, imbued them with a lot more meaning and they became a lot more important.

846
00:42:37,077 --> 00:42:41,458
I didn't need to worry because if those ideas were really strong, they persisted,

847
00:42:42,558 --> 00:42:45,099
a good idea stays with you, it gets stuck up here.

848
00:42:46,959 --> 00:42:48,820
It's impossible to unsee things, okay?

849
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,180
So this is a bunch of random noise, yeah?

850
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,362
Okay, and now you see a dog, okay?

851
00:42:56,162 --> 00:42:58,883
And now you will see the dog whenever you see this picture.

852
00:42:58,963 --> 00:43:00,763
It's now stuck in your subconscious forever.

853
00:43:01,323 --> 00:43:04,284
I could show you this image again in five years and you will still see the dog.

854
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:08,975
So how can you get to the end if you don't know the way?

855
00:43:09,935 --> 00:43:12,797
Well, don't despair if it feels like you're not making progress

856
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:15,299
because the worst thing you can do is be too careful.

857
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:18,301
The best way to crawl through that cone of uncertainty

858
00:43:18,781 --> 00:43:21,683
is to start making decisions, start committing to things,

859
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:24,845
and don't stress out about cutting things.

860
00:43:24,865 --> 00:43:27,247
You know, if something is good and it gets cut,

861
00:43:28,047 --> 00:43:29,768
it will find its place sooner rather than later.

862
00:43:32,426 --> 00:43:35,367
So making those decisions, that's pretty important.

863
00:43:36,668 --> 00:43:38,208
But you need to be sure you're making those decisions

864
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:39,109
for the right reasons.

865
00:43:40,709 --> 00:43:41,970
I'm not making those decisions on my own,

866
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,310
we're making things for other people to use,

867
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,451
so there are a lot of stakeholders

868
00:43:44,751 --> 00:43:45,872
from lots of different disciplines.

869
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:49,890
And this means that we're getting feedback from people who don't always have an art background.

870
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:54,434
These guys, they don't always have the artistic vocabulary to verbalize their feedback clearly.

871
00:43:54,454 --> 00:43:58,457
You know, they're not always able to do things like separate presentation from design.

872
00:43:59,457 --> 00:44:04,881
But turning this inward, as artists, we're not exactly objective about our own work either.

873
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:11,326
Everyone has their blind spots. Everyone can be swayed by quality of finish or taste rather than content.

874
00:44:12,267 --> 00:44:18,454
So, as an example, we present lineups like this, even though these things are just about

875
00:44:18,514 --> 00:44:22,639
presenting costume design and getting feedback on costume design, people were getting swayed

876
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:28,546
by things like gesture, facial expression, even silly things like the order in which

877
00:44:28,586 --> 00:44:29,567
things were presented.

878
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:34,913
We'd talk about this beforehand, and people would make a conscious effort not to be swayed.

879
00:44:35,313 --> 00:44:37,655
But it's really hard, practically impossible even.

880
00:44:38,576 --> 00:44:41,238
The feedback that we were getting was just less useful as a result.

881
00:44:42,298 --> 00:44:47,683
So in a misguided attempt to address this issue, I shifted us to lineups of identical

882
00:44:47,703 --> 00:44:49,804
poses and models, so the only difference was costume.

883
00:44:50,845 --> 00:44:56,009
It didn't really work like I thought it would, because before, if someone didn't like a pose

884
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:59,011
or something, they didn't like that one specific variant.

885
00:44:59,552 --> 00:45:03,917
But now, if someone doesn't like the pose or the face, they don't like any of them.

886
00:45:05,725 --> 00:45:07,726
So those contextual clues like gesture,

887
00:45:08,386 --> 00:45:10,107
they're irrelevant to the costume design, yes,

888
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:11,247
but it's not just fluff.

889
00:45:11,267 --> 00:45:13,608
They're communicating vital aspects of the character.

890
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,329
So now what we do is we go wide representation

891
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:18,430
to begin with, and then we standardize

892
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,731
as the design is closing, as we're getting towards the end.

893
00:45:21,432 --> 00:45:23,252
And sometimes, like this example on screen,

894
00:45:23,773 --> 00:45:25,954
where we draw the same illustration, the same design,

895
00:45:26,094 --> 00:45:27,694
under different conditions to A-B test

896
00:45:27,754 --> 00:45:29,455
and work out exactly what it is people like

897
00:45:29,495 --> 00:45:31,276
about a very specific illustration.

898
00:45:32,674 --> 00:45:34,917
You know, you can't defeat bias with brute force.

899
00:45:35,398 --> 00:45:36,700
It's just something you have to account for.

900
00:45:38,182 --> 00:45:39,504
And another thing you have to account for

901
00:45:39,524 --> 00:45:41,026
is people's expectations.

902
00:45:41,327 --> 00:45:43,850
So before someone sees your work,

903
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:45,873
they will have their own mental image

904
00:45:46,194 --> 00:45:47,035
of what they expect to see.

905
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:50,818
And if what you show is different from those expectations,

906
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:53,240
even if it's appropriate and even if it's good,

907
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,482
it can trigger an adverse reaction.

908
00:45:56,823 --> 00:45:59,025
So this is the first design for Silence.

909
00:45:59,185 --> 00:46:00,807
So for people who don't know,

910
00:46:01,207 --> 00:46:04,890
Silence is this kind of morally dubious genius badass.

911
00:46:06,291 --> 00:46:07,813
He was first described to us by the writers

912
00:46:07,873 --> 00:46:09,334
as this kind of technological wizard,

913
00:46:09,914 --> 00:46:11,636
but he's also an awesome hunter.

914
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,638
He has no problems taking down machines.

915
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:18,641
So I see this first concept, you know, and it's awesome.

916
00:46:18,821 --> 00:46:20,762
It nails who I think Silence is.

917
00:46:20,922 --> 00:46:22,963
And the concept team, they also think they've nailed it in one.

918
00:46:23,404 --> 00:46:24,684
So we're really enthusiastic.

919
00:46:24,925 --> 00:46:27,086
We go show it to the writers, and they like it.

920
00:46:28,487 --> 00:46:30,488
But they don't really see him as Silence

921
00:46:31,348 --> 00:46:33,710
because it doesn't really meet that wizard description that they gave us.

922
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:38,674
So, but no worries, you know, we discuss our expectations and we do a bit more exploration.

923
00:46:39,054 --> 00:46:41,876
And we're not really sure on this wizard thing, so we start subtle, you know.

924
00:46:42,376 --> 00:46:45,299
We show them this, they're not really feeling it, you know.

925
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,400
It's not really as striking as that first design,

926
00:46:48,161 --> 00:46:50,603
and it's not really as strong on that wizard note as it should be.

927
00:46:51,704 --> 00:46:53,685
So we think, okay, we're being a bit uncompromising.

928
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:58,629
Let's pull the wizard slider to max, thinking that this is what silence needs to be.

929
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:01,851
But unexpectedly, they don't like this one any better.

930
00:47:02,777 --> 00:47:07,158
And every time we talk about these concepts, everyone's always doing it in the context

931
00:47:07,198 --> 00:47:08,138
of that first concept.

932
00:47:08,198 --> 00:47:10,499
It was just like, it left such a strong impression.

933
00:47:11,139 --> 00:47:13,239
It essentially just pulled everything else into its orbit.

934
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:17,320
And it wasn't so much that it was wrong, it was just that it wasn't really what they had

935
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:17,900
in mind.

936
00:47:18,381 --> 00:47:19,721
And it just took a bit of adjusting to.

937
00:47:20,481 --> 00:47:24,622
And ultimately what we ended up shipping with was something pretty close to that first concept.

938
00:47:26,105 --> 00:47:28,626
Now mind, those explorations, they weren't wasted time.

939
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:30,567
You see, we incorporated a lot of the features

940
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:32,648
from those ideations into the final,

941
00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:35,190
but it just meant that we kind of got there

942
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,430
in a fairly roundabout way.

943
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:38,852
So now what I do is I try and make sure

944
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:40,753
that every design has a bit of breathing room

945
00:47:41,293 --> 00:47:42,874
by making sure that people see designs

946
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:45,616
long before they're asked to cast judgment on them.

947
00:47:46,356 --> 00:47:48,157
You know, I try and do this out of context

948
00:47:48,677 --> 00:47:50,478
so it doesn't feel like I'm soliciting their opinion

949
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:51,559
that very second.

950
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:56,312
And this is like silly, simple things like, you know, print them out big and stick them around the office,

951
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,513
slip them into random emails and meetings.

952
00:47:59,313 --> 00:48:05,776
And this sounds a little bit manipulative, but it's not really, because if someone really, really doesn't like a design,

953
00:48:06,196 --> 00:48:07,897
a bit of time isn't going to help, you know.

954
00:48:09,197 --> 00:48:14,499
If you're doing something original and with something which is sometimes a little bit weird, like Horizon is,

955
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,681
in order to give a design a chance to be properly appraised, you know, appraised objectively,

956
00:48:20,505 --> 00:48:22,106
it needs a bit of a climatization time.

957
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:25,687
And I found that if you do this,

958
00:48:25,807 --> 00:48:27,708
the more original, the more distinctive designs,

959
00:48:28,228 --> 00:48:29,809
they're the ones that consistently win out.

960
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:34,111
So how can you keep that feedback objective?

961
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,672
Well, be aware that your design work

962
00:48:36,732 --> 00:48:37,632
is judged holistically,

963
00:48:37,652 --> 00:48:39,153
not just that one thing you want to focus on.

964
00:48:39,945 --> 00:48:42,507
Be aware that everyone brings their expectations and preconceptions.

965
00:48:43,548 --> 00:48:44,749
So give your work room to breathe.

966
00:48:44,769 --> 00:48:47,832
You know, in my experience, the more radical, the more unexpected the design,

967
00:48:48,272 --> 00:48:51,415
the more acclimatization people need to see it objectively.

968
00:48:55,698 --> 00:48:58,120
So we're going to stick with this theme of psychological blind spots.

969
00:48:58,801 --> 00:49:01,783
So here's a story about a time that I fell into that coma failing,

970
00:49:02,744 --> 00:49:05,946
getting excited about the process whilst losing sight of the end result.

971
00:49:06,607 --> 00:49:09,149
You know, for where I'm from, we call this being too clever by half.

972
00:49:10,886 --> 00:49:13,227
So now we have a whole bunch of distinctive,

973
00:49:13,247 --> 00:49:15,228
diverse designs, you know, the concept's ready to go.

974
00:49:15,709 --> 00:49:16,449
Now the problem is like,

975
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:18,130
how do we make all this stuff cost effectively?

976
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,191
You know, how do we make these things,

977
00:49:19,311 --> 00:49:21,452
these characters as efficiently as possible?

978
00:49:22,253 --> 00:49:24,774
And modular construction is a fairly obvious way to go.

979
00:49:24,794 --> 00:49:27,896
So, you know, we start with this Lego approach.

980
00:49:27,956 --> 00:49:31,098
You know, we build huge libraries of small pieces,

981
00:49:31,118 --> 00:49:32,659
you know, discrete chunks of the character

982
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,460
which are individually versatile.

983
00:49:35,661 --> 00:49:36,822
And then we just start recombining these

984
00:49:36,842 --> 00:49:37,863
to make many different variants.

985
00:49:38,463 --> 00:49:39,944
And on paper, this looks really promising.

986
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:43,992
But when you transition to 3D, the reality is pretty different.

987
00:49:44,572 --> 00:49:47,735
Because our designs, they use a lot of layering and a lot of overlap.

988
00:49:49,076 --> 00:49:51,177
This makes it really difficult for these pieces to work together

989
00:49:51,538 --> 00:49:53,699
without intersections or without reading complications.

990
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,161
So in order to make these things work together,

991
00:49:56,582 --> 00:49:58,703
we were constantly making design compromises

992
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,125
in order to make things physically fit.

993
00:50:01,986 --> 00:50:05,729
And a good design, it can tolerate a little bit of compromise.

994
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:10,617
But the difficulty with these modular systems is that every time you add a new piece,

995
00:50:11,137 --> 00:50:14,598
the number of these interdependencies increase exponentially.

996
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,881
So each of these lines represents a dependency between these pieces,

997
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:24,763
and the more of these dependencies you have, the more compromises you are going to need to make.

998
00:50:25,843 --> 00:50:29,825
And this looks like a lot, but this is really just like three sets of pieces.

999
00:50:30,305 --> 00:50:33,727
This complexity, it scales exponentially, you know, here's 10 sets of pieces.

1000
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:37,001
This only gets worse and worse, okay?

1001
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:40,065
So now, you know, I can only think of two ways to make this work.

1002
00:50:40,586 --> 00:50:44,310
Option one is we do like hard rules on piece design, we settle on standardized,

1003
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:47,374
very, very similar forms, very, very similar volumes.

1004
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:50,558
But this kind of defeats our point because everything is just going to end up looking the same.

1005
00:50:51,692 --> 00:50:55,534
Option two is like we try and defeat this with cleverness, you know, we kind of create

1006
00:50:55,554 --> 00:50:58,176
some tool that does some kind of procedural fitting system.

1007
00:50:58,837 --> 00:51:01,539
But the trick is like these things, they come with a lot of management overhead.

1008
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:05,222
They require a lot of time to use and maintain.

1009
00:51:05,742 --> 00:51:07,903
And this is time that I could be spending making more characters.

1010
00:51:08,964 --> 00:51:14,066
And really the most that these systems can do is just kind of clumsily warp and fit pieces together

1011
00:51:14,846 --> 00:51:18,868
and that's not really a compromise I was willing to make because I would lose all of these bulges,

1012
00:51:18,968 --> 00:51:23,530
compression folds, you know, these are important descriptive details that really make these

1013
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:30,633
materials feel real. So to cut a long story short, the problem wasn't a modular construction problem,

1014
00:51:31,353 --> 00:51:33,674
it was a damn problem. I was being too clever by half.

1015
00:51:34,339 --> 00:51:38,023
I've gotten so enamored with the potential of this modular process that I essentially

1016
00:51:38,043 --> 00:51:42,547
just lost sight of the outcome, which was simply to make as much variation as efficiently

1017
00:51:42,587 --> 00:51:43,047
as possible.

1018
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:50,534
So in reality that's dead simple, because not every part of a design adds value equally.

1019
00:51:51,892 --> 00:51:54,633
So now what we do is we just look at a set of archetypical designs like this.

1020
00:51:55,173 --> 00:51:56,994
We identify the elements which are most distinct,

1021
00:51:57,354 --> 00:52:00,275
have the most visual variation from design to design,

1022
00:52:00,995 --> 00:52:03,495
and then conversely we identify the bits which have the least variation,

1023
00:52:04,196 --> 00:52:05,736
which are most similar from character to character,

1024
00:52:06,236 --> 00:52:08,497
and then we break them up and we make lots of that first category,

1025
00:52:08,577 --> 00:52:11,158
and then we make fewer or one of the second.

1026
00:52:13,058 --> 00:52:19,581
So we have bigger pieces, they have less interdependencies, and this worked out a hell of a lot better.

1027
00:52:20,101 --> 00:52:24,343
So we can't make quite as many different variants with this set as I could in the earlier example,

1028
00:52:24,744 --> 00:52:28,325
but the variants that I can make are substantially more different looking from one another,

1029
00:52:28,765 --> 00:52:33,007
but even more importantly, because I know interdependencies across these archetypical characters,

1030
00:52:33,427 --> 00:52:35,688
I can make every archetype look very different from one another.

1031
00:52:38,312 --> 00:52:39,674
So how can you avoid being too clever?

1032
00:52:40,135 --> 00:52:41,877
Well, don't lose sight of your objective.

1033
00:52:42,498 --> 00:52:43,840
Focus on what you're trying to achieve.

1034
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,544
Don't get seduced by cleverness for its own sake.

1035
00:52:47,805 --> 00:52:49,828
Make sure it's the problem that's leading the process,

1036
00:52:49,928 --> 00:52:50,850
not the solution.

1037
00:52:52,532 --> 00:52:54,895
So these techniques, they helped us make more content.

1038
00:52:57,327 --> 00:52:59,970
But even then the scope of the game is still hilariously overwhelming.

1039
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:04,234
And Guerrilla is not exactly a small studio, you know, Horizon was about 200 people.

1040
00:53:04,774 --> 00:53:09,438
But we like to pretend and we try and keep a small studio mindset.

1041
00:53:10,405 --> 00:53:12,648
We like having things like direct lines of communication.

1042
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:14,610
We like having an open environment

1043
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,292
where everyone can be criticized.

1044
00:53:16,973 --> 00:53:19,456
But with every single extra person you add to a team,

1045
00:53:19,976 --> 00:53:22,659
collaboration becomes harder, it becomes more formal.

1046
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:25,763
So what we did with the Horizon Character team

1047
00:53:25,783 --> 00:53:26,984
was keep it deliberately small.

1048
00:53:27,325 --> 00:53:29,868
We only had four full-time artists and two contractors.

1049
00:53:31,222 --> 00:53:35,164
So this of course means that we relied a lot on outsourcing.

1050
00:53:36,485 --> 00:53:39,827
And I could talk all day about how to outsource effectively, but I have three minutes,

1051
00:53:40,328 --> 00:53:42,769
so I'm going to focus on, you know, perhaps the most important thing.

1052
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:47,152
To outsource effectively, you need to outsource the right things.

1053
00:53:47,753 --> 00:53:50,154
And the right things are not always the most obvious things.

1054
00:53:50,174 --> 00:53:52,076
They're not always the things that you might want to outsource.

1055
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:57,652
But if you want to make a lot of stuff with a small team, you need to be constantly asking yourself on every task, you know, can we outsource this?

1056
00:53:58,373 --> 00:54:03,735
And the trick to untangling this question is to consider where it is that your studio really is adding the value, okay?

1057
00:54:04,215 --> 00:54:06,316
Because those are the things that you shouldn't be outsourcing.

1058
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:10,277
And at Grimmel Games, you know, we're a game developer.

1059
00:54:11,158 --> 00:54:14,399
We're not a creative commune, we're not an art school, we're not a model factory.

1060
00:54:14,979 --> 00:54:15,820
We're making video games.

1061
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,993
And the meat of the game is the player experience,

1062
00:54:19,013 --> 00:54:21,235
where the storytelling, the gameplay, the technology,

1063
00:54:21,275 --> 00:54:23,496
the visuals, where all of this stuff comes together.

1064
00:54:23,516 --> 00:54:25,837
You know, this is what people remember.

1065
00:54:25,857 --> 00:54:27,558
This is what gives the game its identity.

1066
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:29,439
This is what we need to own.

1067
00:54:29,479 --> 00:54:31,740
This is where we really are adding the value.

1068
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,142
And everything else is essentially details and execution.

1069
00:54:36,223 --> 00:54:38,144
So, game meshes, can we outsource this?

1070
00:54:38,804 --> 00:54:40,205
Well, doing a good game mesh, yeah,

1071
00:54:40,346 --> 00:54:43,067
it requires skill, it requires practice and talent, okay?

1072
00:54:43,688 --> 00:54:45,449
But the outcome is relatively objective

1073
00:54:45,509 --> 00:54:46,930
and fairly easy to communicate.

1074
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,171
It needs to look good,

1075
00:54:48,191 --> 00:54:49,912
it needs to meet the performance requirements.

1076
00:54:51,153 --> 00:54:52,694
This means it's super easy to train,

1077
00:54:53,235 --> 00:54:55,837
it's easy to brief, it's easy to review.

1078
00:54:57,057 --> 00:54:59,579
But they're super time consuming to do well, you know?

1079
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:01,120
So what value are you adding?

1080
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:03,231
by like tying up your internal stuff,

1081
00:55:03,931 --> 00:55:04,911
making these game meshes.

1082
00:55:05,631 --> 00:55:06,852
Let's look at this from another angle.

1083
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:09,392
Here's a workflow from the perspective

1084
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:10,893
of the person making the game mesh.

1085
00:55:11,533 --> 00:55:13,173
So you see someone is handing them a high poly,

1086
00:55:13,593 --> 00:55:15,074
and then in the middle they do their thing,

1087
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:16,854
and they hand their stuff off to like,

1088
00:55:16,934 --> 00:55:18,095
whoever's doing the UVs, okay?

1089
00:55:18,635 --> 00:55:20,915
So this work is just flowing in one direction.

1090
00:55:21,959 --> 00:55:26,201
You know, there are clear endpoints, clear success criteria for every single handover.

1091
00:55:26,742 --> 00:55:28,963
This is not exactly a collaborative process.

1092
00:55:29,303 --> 00:55:32,405
These guys need to cooperate, they need to make sure their shit is getting done, take

1093
00:55:32,425 --> 00:55:35,647
any special notes, but their interactions aren't really adding a lot to the outcome.

1094
00:55:35,828 --> 00:55:38,249
You know, this is the difference between cooperation and collaboration.

1095
00:55:38,649 --> 00:55:43,132
Collaboration is where those interactions make a team greater than the sum of its parts.

1096
00:55:44,113 --> 00:55:47,735
So there's no real reason to have these three guys sit next to each other because they can

1097
00:55:47,755 --> 00:55:51,638
do their job more or less equally the same as if they were hundreds of miles apart.

1098
00:55:53,045 --> 00:55:55,286
Let's compare this to an example of something we did with the studio,

1099
00:55:55,306 --> 00:55:59,588
you know, Aloy's hair, can we outsource this? No.

1100
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:03,870
Because this is not just an asset we can shuffle around, it's an R&D project,

1101
00:56:04,251 --> 00:56:05,391
it spans multiple disciplines,

1102
00:56:05,731 --> 00:56:07,872
and everyone is adding something different to the process.

1103
00:56:08,493 --> 00:56:10,914
The flow is not one-dimensional and predictable,

1104
00:56:11,274 --> 00:56:14,475
it's back and forth, it has dead ends, it has eureka moments.

1105
00:56:15,616 --> 00:56:18,217
And a project like this benefits from people working closely together,

1106
00:56:18,237 --> 00:56:19,978
you know, people who know each other well enough

1107
00:56:19,998 --> 00:56:22,039
that they can have a passionate argument about something.

1108
00:56:22,493 --> 00:56:23,735
without things getting too personal.

1109
00:56:25,396 --> 00:56:27,638
So Aloy's hair is important.

1110
00:56:27,918 --> 00:56:30,140
Anything Aloy related is important.

1111
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,742
Because of course, she's one of the pillars of the game.

1112
00:56:32,762 --> 00:56:34,764
But as important as she was,

1113
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:37,005
it didn't mean that we had to do every single facet of her

1114
00:56:37,446 --> 00:56:38,286
inside the studio.

1115
00:56:39,327 --> 00:56:41,069
And I talked about our speed model process before.

1116
00:56:41,449 --> 00:56:42,470
So inside the studio,

1117
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:44,632
we spend a lot of time working at Aloy in 3D.

1118
00:56:44,672 --> 00:56:46,393
We get her in the game, we get feedback,

1119
00:56:46,413 --> 00:56:47,374
we see how she feels to play.

1120
00:56:48,024 --> 00:56:50,345
And after an extremely long and collaborative process,

1121
00:56:50,385 --> 00:56:52,046
we feel like we've resolved the design,

1122
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,508
the proportions are good, the design elements are working,

1123
00:56:54,948 --> 00:56:56,169
you know, she's nice and readable.

1124
00:56:56,689 --> 00:56:58,590
We're ready to do this kind of final high poly,

1125
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,931
add in all that detail, material expression,

1126
00:57:00,952 --> 00:57:02,973
you know, everything she needs to feel believable.

1127
00:57:03,693 --> 00:57:04,854
Can we outsource this? Yes.

1128
00:57:05,254 --> 00:57:06,535
And at this point, we hand it over

1129
00:57:06,575 --> 00:57:07,575
to one of our skilled friends,

1130
00:57:08,316 --> 00:57:10,357
because whilst this is extremely important,

1131
00:57:10,837 --> 00:57:12,038
things like material expression,

1132
00:57:12,438 --> 00:57:13,979
they're not very subjective, you know,

1133
00:57:14,019 --> 00:57:15,160
they're not very collaborative.

1134
00:57:16,477 --> 00:57:19,098
Detailing is high poly, it's super skilled,

1135
00:57:19,658 --> 00:57:20,599
and it's definitely fun,

1136
00:57:21,279 --> 00:57:22,620
and it's definitely something our artists

1137
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,761
are perfectly capable of doing,

1138
00:57:24,481 --> 00:57:26,442
but it's not necessarily the most impactful part

1139
00:57:26,462 --> 00:57:28,964
of the production, and by not doing this,

1140
00:57:29,044 --> 00:57:31,065
it frees them up to do some other more important things,

1141
00:57:31,105 --> 00:57:32,246
which I'll talk about in a second.

1142
00:57:32,906 --> 00:57:34,407
But just to kind of wrap up,

1143
00:57:34,427 --> 00:57:35,688
what did we outsource in total?

1144
00:57:36,588 --> 00:57:36,968
Quite a lot.

1145
00:57:38,232 --> 00:57:41,213
So using man hours spent on the asset as a metric

1146
00:57:41,754 --> 00:57:43,555
for almost 90% of our content,

1147
00:57:44,315 --> 00:57:46,076
one of our partners did the majority

1148
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:47,297
of the actual asset creation.

1149
00:57:47,317 --> 00:57:48,718
You know, they spent more time on it than we did.

1150
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:50,899
That doesn't mean that they did all of it

1151
00:57:51,399 --> 00:57:53,841
because we still have our fingers in every single character.

1152
00:57:53,881 --> 00:57:54,941
We're still keeping ownership

1153
00:57:54,961 --> 00:57:56,442
of those identity-defining parts,

1154
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,504
but it did mean that they spent more time on it than we did.

1155
00:58:01,069 --> 00:58:06,994
But for 99% of all characters, at some point in their life cycle we had some kind of external

1156
00:58:07,014 --> 00:58:08,095
development assistance.

1157
00:58:08,616 --> 00:58:12,900
So even if a character is owned internally, like one of our lead cast, we still get a

1158
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,764
partner to do at least some of the more mechanical, less collaborative bits like UVs or baking

1159
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:17,144
or LOLs.

1160
00:58:18,325 --> 00:58:28,250
And just a reminder, I said the internal team only did about 13%, which doesn't really sound like a lot, but it's 13% of our enormous scope, so that's a pretty impressive chunk of work.

1161
00:58:29,071 --> 00:58:31,452
And it was pretty awesome work, so I'm just going to take a sec to show it off.

1162
00:58:33,013 --> 00:58:41,718
Internally, we made pretty much the same amount of characters as a Killzone game, so outsourcing more didn't mean that we did less, it just meant that we outsourced more.

1163
00:58:42,578 --> 00:58:46,680
And through outsourcing more, we gave the game the scope of content it needed to be a success.

1164
00:58:48,398 --> 00:58:49,999
So how can you decide what to outsource?

1165
00:58:50,019 --> 00:58:51,260
Well, make a habit of asking yourself

1166
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,400
if something can be outsourced,

1167
00:58:52,421 --> 00:58:53,982
because the answer is yes, but often you think.

1168
00:58:54,882 --> 00:58:56,883
The more collaborative, the more subjective something is,

1169
00:58:56,903 --> 00:58:58,264
the more difficult it is to outsource.

1170
00:58:58,805 --> 00:59:01,166
So work out where your team really needs to add the value

1171
00:59:01,486 --> 00:59:02,847
and hold on to those things in particular.

1172
00:59:03,808 --> 00:59:06,430
These things, they tend to be less content creation

1173
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:08,011
and more problem solving.

1174
00:59:09,532 --> 00:59:11,293
See, our internal team, they focus more

1175
00:59:11,313 --> 00:59:13,134
on that problem solving, collaborative aspect,

1176
00:59:13,514 --> 00:59:14,935
and then delegate to the larger part

1177
00:59:14,955 --> 00:59:16,676
of the actual content creation to our partners.

1178
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,421
This leads into what I look for in a team member.

1179
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:23,983
You see, in my experience, you can categorize game artists

1180
00:59:24,003 --> 00:59:25,303
into one or two boxes.

1181
00:59:25,904 --> 00:59:27,685
You have the artists who are focused

1182
00:59:27,725 --> 00:59:29,806
on making great pieces of work, you know, the craftsmen.

1183
00:59:30,326 --> 00:59:32,027
And there are artists who love figuring stuff out

1184
00:59:32,067 --> 00:59:33,868
and pushing the boundaries, you know, the tinkerers.

1185
00:59:34,963 --> 00:59:39,888
And the people in that first category, they have ownership needs which are pretty focused.

1186
00:59:39,908 --> 00:59:43,692
They put their all into that one thing they're doing now, that thing is theirs.

1187
00:59:44,533 --> 00:59:48,997
And we have a need for people with this focus, but it's not always a very collaborative approach.

1188
00:59:49,457 --> 00:59:52,901
So I found these guys, more often than not, can work just as well remotely.

1189
00:59:54,304 --> 00:59:59,650
When it comes to the team who are inside the studio, I want the mad scientists, okay?

1190
01:00:00,131 --> 01:00:04,996
These guys are the ones who are at the cutting edge of what the tech and what the tools can do.

1191
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:08,080
These guys are the first people to get out of their chair and collaborate.

1192
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:12,765
And these guys are the ones who are just like trying out all kinds of crazy shit on their own initiative.

1193
01:00:13,605 --> 01:00:16,426
So when it comes to ownership, you know, these guys say they think bigger

1194
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:22,708
Yeah, they own big broad problems like human anatomy and deformation or digital tailoring

1195
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:29,590
I mean a more masochistic artist might really like tackling the problem of hair and the character team

1196
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:31,510
They have an abundance of these ongoing projects

1197
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:33,971
Most of our artists own at least a couple

1198
01:00:34,818 --> 01:00:38,139
And their task goes beyond just kind of tinkering and researching and developing.

1199
01:00:38,539 --> 01:00:41,640
These guys are supposed to set the workflow, they're supposed to teach others,

1200
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,361
they're supposed to maintain the standard throughout production.

1201
01:00:45,421 --> 01:00:47,161
And that basically means that for every position,

1202
01:00:47,601 --> 01:00:50,242
I'm looking for someone who has an aptitude for leadership.

1203
01:00:50,722 --> 01:00:53,403
Either an artist who has an existing experience and wants to keep at it,

1204
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,564
but also people who don't have that experience,

1205
01:00:57,584 --> 01:00:59,165
but exhibit the right mindset and qualities.

1206
01:01:00,734 --> 01:01:03,317
These guys need to coordinate a wider pool of artists.

1207
01:01:03,718 --> 01:01:07,603
So in addition to having excellent visual and verbal communication skills,

1208
01:01:07,923 --> 01:01:09,325
they need good emotional intelligence,

1209
01:01:09,626 --> 01:01:12,870
but most importantly these guys need an earnest desire to share their knowledge

1210
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:14,292
and to teach other people.

1211
01:01:15,246 --> 01:01:19,491
And the problem is like not every excellent artist is or wants to be an excellent leader.

1212
01:01:20,092 --> 01:01:23,355
And if you put someone in a position where their job evolves like that and they don't

1213
01:01:23,395 --> 01:01:25,498
want to do that, that rarely works out.

1214
01:01:26,158 --> 01:01:28,801
So how can you handle ownership?

1215
01:01:28,882 --> 01:01:31,404
Well, be aware that people have different needs concerning ownership.

1216
01:01:31,865 --> 01:01:36,307
and hire people whose needs are aligned with what you want to achieve.

1217
01:01:37,287 --> 01:01:40,669
Ownership of broad problems to the right person can be as satisfying

1218
01:01:41,029 --> 01:01:43,710
or even more satisfying than just owning individual content.

1219
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:46,771
And if someone does own one of those broad problems,

1220
01:01:47,311 --> 01:01:51,853
they need to be equipped with leadership skills to educate, inspire and delegate.

1221
01:01:52,874 --> 01:01:55,255
Hire people not only based on their skill,

1222
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:57,876
look for people whose goals align with your own goals.

1223
01:02:00,807 --> 01:02:02,527
the obligatory hiring seek.

1224
01:02:03,468 --> 01:02:04,708
And with that out of the way,

1225
01:02:04,748 --> 01:02:06,429
I'm just gonna circle back to this happy guy.

1226
01:02:07,529 --> 01:02:09,250
I didn't finish that burger

1227
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:11,091
with some grand strategic master plan.

1228
01:02:11,611 --> 01:02:12,871
I didn't calculate the optimal way

1229
01:02:12,911 --> 01:02:14,132
to shove it down my throat at once.

1230
01:02:14,672 --> 01:02:17,013
And I didn't design some kind of magical burger eating tool.

1231
01:02:17,573 --> 01:02:19,034
Instead, I just kind of got stuck in

1232
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:20,435
and took it one bite at a time.

1233
01:02:21,895 --> 01:02:22,735
Because more often than not,

1234
01:02:22,775 --> 01:02:24,276
those smaller day-to-day decisions,

1235
01:02:24,756 --> 01:02:26,537
those are the most important.

1236
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:27,958
Individually, they don't amount to much,

1237
01:02:28,018 --> 01:02:29,558
but their combined effect is powerful.

1238
01:02:30,557 --> 01:02:34,360
How do you make good small decisions? Well, ironically, you have to think bigger, you have to check

1239
01:02:34,961 --> 01:02:37,783
every little call you make against what you're ultimately trying to achieve.

1240
01:02:38,464 --> 01:02:43,188
Every teeny tiny decision needs to be measured against what effect it's going to have on the player's experience.

1241
01:02:44,249 --> 01:02:48,592
And with that, I'm afraid I have run out of time and they're about to kick me off stage.

1242
01:02:49,153 --> 01:02:52,335
Anyone who wants to ask me some questions or argue with me, I like arguing,

1243
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:54,577
you can meet up with me in this wrap-up room.

1244
01:02:55,801 --> 01:02:57,422
Overlook 22, same building right there in the corner,

1245
01:02:57,883 --> 01:02:59,124
at 7.30.

1246
01:02:59,764 --> 01:03:01,325
You see, I foolishly took an appointment

1247
01:03:01,405 --> 01:03:03,267
right after this talk, so I have one last lesson.

1248
01:03:04,388 --> 01:03:05,288
Always check your calendar.

1249
01:03:05,649 --> 01:03:06,890
Don't agree to anything without checking.

1250
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:07,670
You can do it first.

1251
01:03:08,191 --> 01:03:09,892
And it takes only one really dumb mistake

1252
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,573
to undermine an entire presentation.

1253
01:03:12,594 --> 01:03:14,235
So, thanks everyone.
