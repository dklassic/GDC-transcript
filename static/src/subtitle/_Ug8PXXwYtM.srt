1
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:18,010
All right, let us get started with, let's keep redlining out of the mood, multiverse,

2
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,770
metaverse, multiverse, all the verses.

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,931
All right, let's define it.

4
00:00:25,552 --> 00:00:28,332
Keep that in your brain as we're going through this.

5
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:32,693
And then keep this one too.

6
00:00:34,277 --> 00:00:36,019
This one's a little bit more loosey-goosey.

7
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:38,302
All right.

8
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:41,606
Well, who are we and where are we from?

9
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:45,931
That's me.

10
00:00:47,552 --> 00:00:49,194
This is all I have to do for Kelly.

11
00:00:50,736 --> 00:00:50,956
That's it.

12
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:53,653
A long time ago I worked on that game.

13
00:00:55,314 --> 00:01:00,536
So after that game, I left that game company.

14
00:01:01,716 --> 00:01:06,278
I think there, I'll briefly touch on sort of the through line here is certainly that

15
00:01:06,318 --> 00:01:10,679
game company and my tenure with them was at a time when.

16
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:15,204
distribution really exploded and I saw just this huge shift in who gets to make

17
00:01:15,244 --> 00:01:20,410
a game and what games are about and that really fascinated me and I moved more

18
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,314
towards looking at these different levers and mechanisms in the industry

19
00:01:24,354 --> 00:01:25,455
and how they do determine

20
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:28,337
who gets to make a game and why and what they're about.

21
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:31,579
So that moves me more into publishing and business

22
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,921
development and developer relations and working,

23
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,923
going from one game at a time to like 200 at a time when I was at

24
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:40,525
OUYA and then 100 at a time when I was at Google Daydream and now

25
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:43,087
work with external developers creating

26
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:45,428
experiences with Niantic for the real world.

27
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:49,191
That's awesome. I still go Kelly equals journey to me.

28
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:50,031
That's all I needed.

29
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:53,653
All right. I'm a little different.

30
00:01:54,754 --> 00:01:59,717
So I'm a senior producer at Niantic working with the Black Developer Initiative, which we will be talking about.

31
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:02,218
Before then, you'll see a pair of keys.

32
00:02:02,298 --> 00:02:04,599
So before I got in the business, I was a concierge.

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,201
I used to tell people where to go, where the bathroom was.

34
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,763
Realistically, just where the bathroom was.

35
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:15,725
When I was working there, I had a colleague who was just like,

36
00:02:16,446 --> 00:02:18,647
you like video games, you should work in video games.

37
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:21,615
And to me, that logic is like infallible.

38
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:24,877
But at the same time, I was like, not smart enough,

39
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:25,557
I don't think.

40
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:27,438
You know, I don't have an in.

41
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,379
I'm going to be a concierge.

42
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:30,180
She said, nope.

43
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,002
When my boyfriend has an opportunity at his work,

44
00:02:34,382 --> 00:02:35,283
you're going to apply for it.

45
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:38,484
Fast forward a few months, she calls me up,

46
00:02:38,584 --> 00:02:40,005
and she's like, there's an opportunity.

47
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:41,306
You're going to apply for it.

48
00:02:41,926 --> 00:02:44,107
And she was like, OK, so I'm going to tell you the website.

49
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:46,068
Have you heard of a place called LucasArts?

50
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:48,450
And I was like.

51
00:02:49,854 --> 00:02:50,975
I have such things.

52
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:58,181
So there I was a contract QA tester where I worked on Star Wars and Indiana Jones.

53
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:04,115
From there, I got promoted to assistant QA lead,

54
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:06,276
where I worked on some Lego games, you name it,

55
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:08,317
pretty much near the end of LucasArts.

56
00:03:09,018 --> 00:03:10,939
From there, I ran into a couple of old coworkers

57
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,640
who were like, you need to leave LucasArts

58
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:16,102
and come over here, we got a laptop,

59
00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:18,503
you're getting a phone, we got snacks,

60
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:20,344
and it's a mobile space.

61
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:21,525
So I said, okay, cool.

62
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:25,047
So I went over there, became QA lead at DNA West,

63
00:03:25,107 --> 00:03:26,308
which used to be NG MoCo.

64
00:03:26,988 --> 00:03:27,449
From there.

65
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:31,090
At some point, I guess I did a good enough job where they were like,

66
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,891
hey, do you want to be an event producer?

67
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:35,552
I said, sure, I'll do it until you find someone better.

68
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:38,154
A few months after that, they asked me if I wanted to be

69
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:43,116
a product owner of Transformers Legends.

70
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:46,758
Then eventually, I became a product owner of another Transformers game,

71
00:03:47,218 --> 00:03:50,939
and I became the lead event producer for a Marvel game.

72
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,661
I'm the IP guy. That's where I got started.

73
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:59,590
I moved over to Wargaming from that point and then worked some other spots until Kelly

74
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:04,511
found me for this program we're going to talk about and kind of where my focus has been

75
00:04:04,551 --> 00:04:05,111
the last bit.

76
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:10,372
So what is the Black Developer Initiative at Niantic?

77
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:16,233
It was founded during the BLM, you know, the height of the BLM era.

78
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:22,355
We were trying to figure out a way to do what was right, so we founded a program to promote

79
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,292
and empower black game AR developers,

80
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:28,494
geolocation developers to give them opportunities.

81
00:04:29,755 --> 00:04:31,236
We want to see their experiences,

82
00:04:31,276 --> 00:04:32,477
and that's what we're working towards.

83
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:34,619
But what we're going to kind of go through

84
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:38,461
is certain things that we kind of learned along the way.

85
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:42,624
You want to add anything, Kelly?

86
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,506
No, I don't think ... I think are we going to ...

87
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:46,787
Yeah, we're going to jump ...

88
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:49,049
Show the developers next, is that what it is?

89
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We've got this cool slide.

90
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,351
That's my favorite.

91
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:52,592
Yeah.

92
00:04:52,845 --> 00:04:55,426
So today, these are the developers we've currently worked with.

93
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:56,687
Take a picture.

94
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:58,027
Reach out to them.

95
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:01,588
They're amazing developers, even not in the AR space.

96
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:04,109
They deserve the recognition that they deserve.

97
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,851
They are some of the hardest-working people I've got the pleasure to know during this process.

98
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:15,853
All of them are, you know, starting up, up-and-coming developers in the space that,

99
00:05:16,153 --> 00:05:19,414
you know, needs more of these voices, needs more of this representation.

100
00:05:21,428 --> 00:05:23,930
Some of them go from adventure games,

101
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,211
some of them had some really crazy AR,

102
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:27,972
like audio AR stuff is really dope.

103
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:33,114
I do wanna call out, should I call out Wicked Saints now

104
00:05:33,154 --> 00:05:34,195
or leave it for later?

105
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:35,435
No, go for it, yeah.

106
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:39,057
Yeah, so Wicked Saints was the actual first team

107
00:05:39,477 --> 00:05:41,438
that go through our cohort experience,

108
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:43,379
the first BDI program.

109
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,960
And though,

110
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,064
They didn't necessarily move forward with us the way we would like them to.

111
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:52,948
They were able to take their prototype, their pitch deck and everything that they built,

112
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,032
and they were able to get a pre-seed round of $1.1 million.

113
00:05:56,072 --> 00:06:01,178
So yeah, it's pretty awesome.

114
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:11,135
Really quickly, just because this isn't about BDI, but it is the context in which this talk

115
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:14,857
isn't about, but this is the context in which we work together and obviously our foundation

116
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:15,798
for our learnings here.

117
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:22,802
Just to give a little bit more context, when we created it, we really initially took the

118
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:28,286
model of external publishing and the way we engage with developers through funding a concept

119
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:28,706
phase.

120
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:34,069
We made some adjustments and tweaks, added additional programming and mentorship to it.

121
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,772
That was the first iteration of BDI that these teams went through.

122
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:47,497
We have since taken some of these learnings that we're talking about, applied them to

123
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:54,501
reformatting it, and are kicking off a new cohort now.

124
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:56,202
That's the general context.

125
00:06:56,222 --> 00:06:58,463
Is that better?

126
00:06:58,483 --> 00:06:58,563
Okay.

127
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:00,416
Said it better than I could.

128
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:01,476
All right, let's go.

129
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:01,997
I doubt that.

130
00:07:02,277 --> 00:07:03,637
Yeah, all right, we'll see.

131
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:05,558
All right, let's define the problem.

132
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:06,959
We are going to define the problem.

133
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:07,800
Here's the problem.

134
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:13,062
This is from the IGDA in 2019.

135
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:18,525
81% identify as white, 7% Hispanic, Latinx.

136
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:20,546
2% identify as black, African-American, African,

137
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:21,507
Afro-Caribbean.

138
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:22,347
Guess what?

139
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:25,268
If I was to go back to 2014, it's the same statistic.

140
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:27,690
Hasn't changed.

141
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:31,976
We have newer, newer D&I initiatives, but at the same

142
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:34,538
time, that number has not moved up.

143
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:39,442
So part of the problem is access, opportunity, and

144
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:41,283
funding, right?

145
00:07:42,444 --> 00:07:43,005
We know this.

146
00:07:43,105 --> 00:07:43,905
We offer this.

147
00:07:43,945 --> 00:07:46,447
This is what kind of most of these programs do.

148
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:49,890
But it's still imperfect.

149
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,894
It's not a way for us to be able to fully engage a team

150
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:57,196
beyond one of these.

151
00:07:58,742 --> 00:08:04,926
length of time, like if we're just sitting here doing this for five months, what happens after the fifth month? What happens after the sixth month?

152
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:10,249
Because we're finding that in certain instances with people go through these groups

153
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:17,092
confirmation biases appear, people playing or having issues asking for help.

154
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:22,395
They don't want to go through this program, even though, or a program like it, even though we're offering

155
00:08:22,932 --> 00:08:28,336
access, opportunity, and funding because it's seen as, you know, a weakness.

156
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:34,681
Even people who go through programs like this, who then hear of other people going through

157
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:38,845
programs like this, offer prejudice against programs like this.

158
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:46,691
That was good for me at the time, but not necessarily good for me as in my next position

159
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:48,332
or my next spot, my next group.

160
00:08:49,954 --> 00:08:52,015
Whatever way it goes, it's the same win states.

161
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:59,783
using the same success metrics.

162
00:09:00,904 --> 00:09:03,565
So here's the thing.

163
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,325
I don't know about all of you, but I

164
00:09:05,365 --> 00:09:08,006
know that whenever I go to a company or every place I go to,

165
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,407
I feel like I have to be the hardest worker in the room.

166
00:09:11,088 --> 00:09:13,889
I have to be exceptional just to be normal.

167
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:17,991
And this is exactly what kind of happens

168
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:20,972
within programs or initiatives or anything that

169
00:09:21,032 --> 00:09:24,293
runs like this, is you're just looking for the exceptional

170
00:09:24,473 --> 00:09:25,153
instead of just.

171
00:09:26,018 --> 00:09:28,739
a perspective, a new point, providing experience.

172
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,081
It's like when you're at that point looking

173
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:36,122
for those metrics of success, and then you

174
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,543
look at what your company is going to establish in terms

175
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,485
of experience and what they would green light or publish

176
00:09:41,505 --> 00:09:45,427
or produce or whatever, a lot of times they'll just then go,

177
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,987
well, they don't have the experience.

178
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,448
Well, here's the thing.

179
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:50,729
How does a team get experience if they're never

180
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:52,350
given opportunity in the first place?

181
00:09:58,304 --> 00:09:59,765
This one I thought was really clever.

182
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:01,466
Hopefully you'll see the dichotomy in this.

183
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:04,227
So here's the thing, right?

184
00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:10,190
We at Niantic, people who are part of the Web3 wave,

185
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:13,012
blockchain, crypto, however you name it,

186
00:10:13,692 --> 00:10:15,853
we are in this emergent technology.

187
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:18,755
We are now at a moment of time where people are starting

188
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:20,496
to establish themselves and given.

189
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,271
potential opportunities.

190
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:27,053
But the problem is, emergent technology is the divide

191
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:29,354
between resources, excuse me,

192
00:10:29,655 --> 00:10:31,356
people with resources and those without.

193
00:10:32,997 --> 00:10:36,759
Eventually, when the divide is kind of nullified by the fact

194
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,702
that there's been mass adoption, it's no longer valuable.

195
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,803
It's no longer as opportunistic as a lot

196
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:46,144
of people can kind of grow up with this.

197
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:49,426
And I mean, look, this doesn't just happen in tech.

198
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:50,267
It happens everywhere.

199
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:56,671
Any place you work, any place you go, you will see that there are those with resources and those without.

200
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:05,834
But I say that all kind of doom and gloom like we can change that. Everyone in this room at least

201
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:10,835
is interested in learning how to do more or learning what we did so that's the start.

202
00:11:14,796 --> 00:11:19,138
But overall the current message is the barrier to entry changes.

203
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,380
but the message is staying the same.

204
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,322
The more we innovate, the more we discriminate.

205
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,026
The industry is kind of optimized

206
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:32,449
with a certain person in mind,

207
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:33,990
with a certain amount of education,

208
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:36,252
biases intertwined in a pipeline.

209
00:11:36,272 --> 00:11:40,676
I call it a pipeline of privilege.

210
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:46,858
You know, and when we have teams that kind of go through this

211
00:11:46,898 --> 00:11:48,899
who might not necessarily have the same access

212
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,461
to these pipelines, like the teams we showed you earlier,

213
00:11:53,142 --> 00:11:56,504
those biases play against them.

214
00:11:57,745 --> 00:12:01,267
It's not built for teams who are just up and coming.

215
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,389
It's built for established status quo.

216
00:12:07,051 --> 00:12:09,752
We need to think about creating pipelines that

217
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:11,313
provide those opportunities.

218
00:12:12,362 --> 00:12:16,105
that avoid, you know, the socioeconomic side of things

219
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,688
that look to provide opportunities for people

220
00:12:19,728 --> 00:12:21,189
who are interested in this space.

221
00:12:24,992 --> 00:12:26,694
Because it's a huge effing problem.

222
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:36,502
The current message is we all need to work on this together.

223
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,464
Spoiler alert to the end of this.

224
00:12:40,752 --> 00:12:49,262
Niantic can't do this alone. We are just one company pushing our one objective, our one mission with this, and wanting to see the space as diverse.

225
00:12:49,823 --> 00:12:55,089
But everyone here who has the opportunity to work with the company, we're going to need your help.

226
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,951
The industry needs your help.

227
00:13:01,286 --> 00:13:02,867
So here's where the metaverse comes in.

228
00:13:03,227 --> 00:13:04,488
I'm sure some of you are interested.

229
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:08,830
John Hanke put out a blog post about defining the metaverse.

230
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,391
Niantic's is very real world based.

231
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:17,534
But this quote specifically is what stuck with me.

232
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,996
Helping to achieve this meta shift is our purpose at

233
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:23,897
Niantic, but we recognize that it won't be solely our work.

234
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,719
Such a massive evolution will require the work of big

235
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:29,200
companies, startups, and individuals around the world

236
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,140
to become a reality.

237
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:38,150
I don't want those individuals, those startups, and those companies to be only certain companies,

238
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,171
certain individuals.

239
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:45,637
If we're going to be looking at a new boom, a new opportunity here, moving into the metaverse

240
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:51,662
or whatever, we need to define lines that are free and open for all to be able to express

241
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:56,166
themselves, show opportunities, and present growth.

242
00:14:02,995 --> 00:14:07,017
Why it needs to be done. This one's probably a silly slide, but it's true.

243
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:13,941
So this starts with, I have a friend. Yes, I have friends, believe it or not.

244
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:19,964
And this is kind of what got me thinking about this and wanting to work in this

245
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:25,067
space and understanding that maybe the origin story I gave you of me was

246
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:29,089
probably a little bit, I don't know, rare for this space.

247
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,512
So my friend, she reached out to me and was like,

248
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,333
hey, my son's really interested in video games

249
00:14:35,913 --> 00:14:38,535
and he wants to know if there's an internship at your work.

250
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:40,936
And I said, nope.

251
00:14:42,357 --> 00:14:44,738
And he's like, well, can you set up something for him?

252
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:48,580
I was like, no, we don't really have any type of internships

253
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,302
that doesn't count into like the senior year of college

254
00:14:52,362 --> 00:14:54,163
in a role or something specific like that.

255
00:14:54,203 --> 00:14:56,424
We don't really have anything for someone younger,

256
00:14:56,904 --> 00:14:57,884
someone looking for other.

257
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,303
opportunities or space.

258
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:07,046
So I took that and I was like, OK, I can't,

259
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:08,827
I could be like, you can come sit at my desk,

260
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:11,048
but it's not the same thing as kind of experiencing it.

261
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:13,689
And I felt it would be disservice to be like, hey,

262
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:14,189
you know what?

263
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:15,970
Wait till you're in your mid-20s,

264
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,990
you're working at a desk, someone's

265
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,351
going to offer you an opportunity of a lifetime,

266
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:21,872
you're going to have to take it, you're

267
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:24,053
going to have to nail that job, and then you're

268
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:26,174
going to have to work really, really hard

269
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:27,334
to stay in this industry.

270
00:15:28,163 --> 00:15:29,364
But then you'll be in it.

271
00:15:30,385 --> 00:15:34,188
I felt like that was not the message I wanted to be able to

272
00:15:34,228 --> 00:15:35,849
give them, because it's not fair.

273
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:41,314
I know my journey, some pun intended, I know my journey is

274
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,836
different than yours, but I wanted to be able to provide a

275
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,097
more open space.

276
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:49,200
So that's kind of what got me thinking about how do we

277
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,921
increase the devs in this space?

278
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:51,942
What can I do?

279
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,422
More devs in the space equal more experiences, more points of view, wouldn't you say, Kelly?

280
00:16:02,843 --> 00:16:03,083
Yeah.

281
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:05,564
They make different stuff.

282
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:10,646
Yeah, like, I'm going to tell you, some of the designs that I've seen come through the

283
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:16,669
BDI program that we've had show a lot of different experiences that other game designs don't.

284
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:18,149
They're not just match threes.

285
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:24,572
They're built on experiences that they have from soft post-apocalyptic.

286
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:31,996
worlds that are founded because they are negativity in the world and everyone was doing wrong and just wanting to write those rights.

287
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:39,282
To those showing the whole world covered in water because humans need to do better.

288
00:16:40,904 --> 00:16:49,511
To ones being able to, want to be able to just print their words and have them be seen on the streets through special locations.

289
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:51,413
Social, economic.

290
00:16:51,825 --> 00:16:54,447
based ones that in social activism games,

291
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:58,310
that are wanting to empower kids of the future

292
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,631
so that they can have courage.

293
00:17:01,012 --> 00:17:03,934
I mean, that's not like, no knock in Candy Crush,

294
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:06,416
but that's not Candy Crush, right?

295
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:08,898
This is something that someone is experiencing

296
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,640
and they need to tell these stories.

297
00:17:13,402 --> 00:17:14,923
I want them to be able to tell their stories.

298
00:17:14,943 --> 00:17:16,224
I want them to be able to see their lights.

299
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:18,066
Because I think more points of view

300
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:19,887
broaden everyone's horizon.

301
00:17:24,195 --> 00:17:26,556
Wealth, let's just face it.

302
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:28,777
Independence begins with money.

303
00:17:29,377 --> 00:17:30,737
With money, you can have security.

304
00:17:31,338 --> 00:17:32,758
You can have longevity.

305
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:35,299
Because one of the biggest things that we all know,

306
00:17:35,379 --> 00:17:37,540
those who work in the industry for a while,

307
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,780
is longevity is tough.

308
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,381
If you're able to survive a space

309
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:43,721
or be a dev in the space for longer than a couple years,

310
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,322
you're doing something all right.

311
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:48,863
But for that, it means you need security.

312
00:17:49,063 --> 00:17:49,703
You need wealth.

313
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:57,257
One of the tenants, one of the massive tenants out of all the things that we think about in BDI, and this is truly

314
00:17:58,918 --> 00:18:04,403
almost nebulous, is thinking about it in terms of, you know, generational wealth.

315
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:10,708
Being able to have someone be able to provide for someone who can provide for someone, provide for someone.

316
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:17,834
Having those opportunities to have access to wealth means that they can tell their stories, being able to tell their stories.

317
00:18:18,438 --> 00:18:22,501
mean that they can be able to keep telling their stories for generations.

318
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:24,482
But it does start with money.

319
00:18:24,863 --> 00:18:27,985
We need to be able to provide money in some way, shape, or form.

320
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:31,387
Can I add something to that one?

321
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:31,668
Please.

322
00:18:31,688 --> 00:18:35,350
Because I like this one.

323
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,172
Going back to that statistic that we found,

324
00:18:38,232 --> 00:18:40,194
reached back all the way to 2014 of

325
00:18:40,294 --> 00:18:44,897
two percent of developers in the industry that identify as black.

326
00:18:47,263 --> 00:18:52,925
I'm assuming it was there at best the previous decade, likely even lower.

327
00:18:53,645 --> 00:18:59,247
And I think about, again, my own journey through independent game development, that explosion

328
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:04,508
of digital distribution, how many people were shut out of the wealth that was generated

329
00:19:04,868 --> 00:19:06,549
by that shift in our industry.

330
00:19:06,989 --> 00:19:11,010
And right now with XR, we're in a similar state.

331
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,130
It's a new opportunity.

332
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,031
The developers that get in now.

333
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:20,816
will have more opportunities and will be leaders just a year or two or three from now.

334
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:25,481
I think we're already seeing that in the VR space and we're seeing the trends of that in AR again.

335
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:29,446
So this is a really big deal.

336
00:19:31,348 --> 00:19:33,831
It's like, you know, striking with the iron's hot.

337
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:34,491
Yeah.

338
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,352
This is the moment.

339
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:38,871
We could do a lot.

340
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:40,932
We need to be able to do a lot together

341
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,032
with this type of stuff.

342
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:44,834
Because we don't want to wait until web 4.0,

343
00:19:44,994 --> 00:19:45,654
whatever that is.

344
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:49,496
I don't want to know what 4.0 is.

345
00:19:52,718 --> 00:19:54,419
But yeah, Kelly jumped the gun.

346
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:56,380
Moment of time equals opportunity.

347
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:56,940
Oh, sorry.

348
00:19:57,841 --> 00:19:59,582
No, no worries, you're good, you're good.

349
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:09,554
Because what I found is representation is both inspiration and innovation.

350
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:13,855
I actually wrote this, I'm pretty proud of it to be honest.

351
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:23,897
The TLDR of this really short sentence is if we are to grow as an industry and as a

352
00:20:23,937 --> 00:20:27,957
people we need to pave the way for others and stop following the same cycles that we

353
00:20:27,997 --> 00:20:28,718
find ourselves in.

354
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:34,479
You know, it can go from the ways to how you produce things,

355
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:38,862
to how you hire, to how you are looking for devs,

356
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:40,263
maybe with more experience,

357
00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:42,484
but maybe you might want to take a chance on somebody

358
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:46,687
to kind of go back, find that experience,

359
00:20:46,907 --> 00:20:48,689
help them grow in this industry

360
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:50,730
instead of discounting them right off the rip.

361
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,733
Like I said earlier, we need your help in this.

362
00:20:55,573 --> 00:20:57,855
This is something that we need to all be aware of.

363
00:20:58,435 --> 00:20:59,616
We need to make changes.

364
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:04,674
You know, initiatives and programs like this live or die by participation.

365
00:21:06,235 --> 00:21:09,897
So if you have one or you know of one, help with it.

366
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,619
So what can you do, though?

367
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,580
So we have these.

368
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,861
These are just some ideas.

369
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:23,723
These are some things that we kind of take a look at when we work with our teams or current

370
00:21:23,763 --> 00:21:25,424
cohorts and our new cohorts as well.

371
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:31,848
Yeah, share your cheat codes, which I got from the incredible Trinidad Hermodai.

372
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,774
You know, the idea of just all those little things that we've all picked up along the

373
00:21:36,815 --> 00:21:41,561
way in the jobs, especially in, I think, our generation and older.

374
00:21:42,442 --> 00:21:45,042
We didn't have a lot of formal training on the job.

375
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,463
We picked up things as we went.

376
00:21:46,903 --> 00:21:50,944
How can you take a moment, share with someone else

377
00:21:51,024 --> 00:21:54,666
like that trick you learned or that template you always use

378
00:21:54,706 --> 00:21:56,726
when you're starting a game design document?

379
00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:59,987
These little things I think I sometimes don't even realize

380
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:01,288
that I picked up along the way

381
00:22:01,328 --> 00:22:04,829
and yeah, let other people into that.

382
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:09,430
I'm a big fan of the Kobayashi Maru from Star Trek.

383
00:22:11,178 --> 00:22:16,480
because I like the idea that, you know, Kirk didn't believe there was an unwinnable scenario.

384
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,141
And so when I think of cheat codes, that's what I think of.

385
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:23,503
Just because someone says you can't do it doesn't mean you can't find a way to cheat it.

386
00:22:23,523 --> 00:22:26,844
Because sometimes cheating's good. Sometimes.

387
00:22:30,926 --> 00:22:34,908
Look at a way to be less optimized. You wrote this one, so...

388
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,893
Yeah, it goes back to what John was talking about earlier.

389
00:22:38,913 --> 00:22:42,116
I think when I think of the system,

390
00:22:42,136 --> 00:22:45,979
like how do we do things the fastest way possible?

391
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,182
That is often including.

392
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:58,227
biases that come through these systems that have been sort of copy and pasted throughout the history of industry from

393
00:22:58,988 --> 00:23:05,354
Who we hire, the colleges we're hiring from, the way we organize our meetings, the way we communicate online

394
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:11,960
There's so many ways in which it's just easy to do it the the way we've always done it

395
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,040
and

396
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,230
It's not really about becoming less optimized,

397
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,251
but it just takes that little bit of extra effort

398
00:23:20,271 --> 00:23:22,312
to think about how can you do it differently.

399
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:26,955
How can you be including people in a conversation?

400
00:23:27,035 --> 00:23:31,718
How can you be looking at taking your university outreach

401
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:34,260
efforts and shifting them to colleges

402
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,881
your company normally hasn't looked at?

403
00:23:37,102 --> 00:23:38,623
And it just takes a moment, and then it

404
00:23:38,663 --> 00:23:39,844
becomes the optimized way.

405
00:23:39,864 --> 00:23:42,065
And it becomes a new process, but it just

406
00:23:42,105 --> 00:23:45,287
takes a beat to create a different system.

407
00:23:48,456 --> 00:23:48,956
Yep, yep.

408
00:23:50,538 --> 00:23:53,440
But also spend time elevating your Black, Indigenous,

409
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,261
other people of color at work.

410
00:23:56,122 --> 00:23:58,503
One of the big things that I have to shout out

411
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,486
is that through my journey, through my way of getting

412
00:24:02,506 --> 00:24:05,148
through the year, I had people who believed in me.

413
00:24:06,749 --> 00:24:08,891
People who I normally wouldn't expect to believe in me,

414
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:10,592
but they believed in me, they supported me,

415
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:11,513
and they pushed me through.

416
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,455
And I'm completely 100% grateful for that.

417
00:24:19,155 --> 00:24:21,976
And I can guarantee anyone else in your space who might be like,

418
00:24:22,516 --> 00:24:24,356
hey, maybe there is a QA guy there,

419
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:27,717
but he's really interested in production, take a chance.

420
00:24:27,777 --> 00:24:30,978
Or maybe someone seems really confident about game design,

421
00:24:32,258 --> 00:24:32,899
take a chance.

422
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:35,239
Or when you're meeting other developers in the space,

423
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:39,400
if you have the option to work with them, take a chance.

424
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,081
See what they can do, because I guarantee

425
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:42,601
you'll get some stuff that's going to be great.

426
00:24:44,222 --> 00:24:45,402
Do you have a D&I program?

427
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:48,109
in your team or office, offer your support,

428
00:24:48,189 --> 00:24:49,370
offer your time, offer your help.

429
00:24:50,851 --> 00:24:54,614
If you don't, make one, or go ask how to make one,

430
00:24:54,654 --> 00:24:56,275
or go try to work towards that, or build

431
00:24:56,936 --> 00:25:00,238
ERGs that are within your company that you can kind of help

432
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:01,999
support and perpetuate this stuff.

433
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,484
I mean, I love this note that Kelly added this

434
00:25:07,524 --> 00:25:09,265
like last minute, so I was surprised.

435
00:25:09,325 --> 00:25:15,250
But literally, consider how you, your team, your company,

436
00:25:15,689 --> 00:25:20,572
is setting up black, indigenous, people of color employees

437
00:25:20,612 --> 00:25:21,673
for future success.

438
00:25:21,713 --> 00:25:24,114
This includes pay equity, career development,

439
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:25,715
opportunities for advancement.

440
00:25:26,295 --> 00:25:29,117
Again, I was fortunate, but I know I'm an outlier.

441
00:25:30,198 --> 00:25:32,839
I know I'm in rarefied space when it comes to this.

442
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,601
I would like to change that.

443
00:25:38,022 --> 00:25:39,703
And like I said, don't have a D&I program work?

444
00:25:39,944 --> 00:25:40,904
Find out how to start one.

445
00:25:41,865 --> 00:25:43,045
Maybe if it doesn't have one,

446
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:45,047
maybe find one that does have one.

447
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:46,688
whatever works with that space.

448
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:51,513
Yeah. If I may ask you first.

449
00:25:51,573 --> 00:25:53,975
Okay. John has ever propensity

450
00:25:53,995 --> 00:25:55,616
to just jump in when I know the answer and stuff.

451
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:58,018
So I'm like, John, just tell me exactly what I'm supposed to talk.

452
00:25:58,939 --> 00:26:03,784
So the two ways I see that most of

453
00:26:03,804 --> 00:26:08,468
that second to last bullet point teams falling short.

454
00:26:08,488 --> 00:26:10,189
I guess one is,

455
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,122
Actually, they're both kind of related to the same thing,

456
00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:19,305
which is giving teams that do the work in hiring more

457
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:24,289
inclusively, but then are either under-leveling or underpaying

458
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:29,873
those people, which then set them back for the next three

459
00:26:29,893 --> 00:26:33,415
to five years, at least, on their career trajectory.

460
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:36,037
Because as you know, in a lot, it's becoming.

461
00:26:38,158 --> 00:26:41,100
less popular in some sectors,

462
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,882
but for the most part you negotiate your next job based on your last salary,

463
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:46,002
based on your last title.

464
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:48,043
So that's something to consider.

465
00:26:48,063 --> 00:26:50,384
Then the second is, again,

466
00:26:50,784 --> 00:26:52,745
I think we come from the school of we learned,

467
00:26:53,305 --> 00:26:53,766
we got.

468
00:26:54,946 --> 00:27:00,852
promoted by you know what it's like battlefield promotion like somebody

469
00:27:00,872 --> 00:27:04,876
suddenly the opportunity came up and it was like you do the job and then you

470
00:27:04,896 --> 00:27:10,341
figure it out and we succeeded in that but that is definitely not the most

471
00:27:10,401 --> 00:27:15,866
inclusive way to go about promoting and fostering talent and so become a better

472
00:27:15,906 --> 00:27:16,306
manager

473
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:19,169
Get your managers to become better managers.

474
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:24,494
Really think about how you're fostering career development

475
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:26,857
and those opportunities for advancement.

476
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:28,678
Be clear on your job ladders,

477
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:29,799
I think would be the third one.

478
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,702
That's great, yeah, like those Battlefield promotions,

479
00:27:32,802 --> 00:27:34,664
I can guarantee I didn't have as much gray

480
00:27:34,684 --> 00:27:35,745
in my beard as I do now.

481
00:27:36,466 --> 00:27:38,188
Yeah, I was definitely.

482
00:27:38,288 --> 00:27:39,509
A lot gray in your beard too?

483
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:40,510
Yeah, that's fair.

484
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:44,115
Well, I mean, that's all we have.

485
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:46,936
I will say that at Niantic, we try to move quick

486
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,017
through meetings and give people some time back,

487
00:27:49,197 --> 00:27:51,618
but I guess I cut through this a little short.

488
00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:54,960
But I want to thank you all for taking the time

489
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,441
to sit down and listen to us kind of talk about it.

490
00:27:59,241 --> 00:28:02,082
Real TLDR, TLDR of all this is,

491
00:28:02,543 --> 00:28:03,763
if you're working in the metaverse,

492
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:04,884
you're working in these spaces,

493
00:28:05,224 --> 00:28:06,424
make them more inclusive, please.

494
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:07,985
It starts with you.
