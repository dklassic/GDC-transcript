1
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,246
Thank you for all of you for coming out to Reign's Game of Thrones, the Song of Fire and License.

2
00:00:12,907 --> 00:00:22,395
I want to first introduce us three panelists. I'm a semi-moderator, but also going to be chiming in as a panelist as well.

3
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:32,505
Just starting with myself, I work at Devolver Digital. My name is Nigel Lowry, and I work at Devolver Digital, the publisher of Reign's Game of Thrones and the Reign's series.

4
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:36,381
And hopefully we'll be able to lead this conversation.

5
00:00:37,982 --> 00:00:39,503
Yeah, so I'm Francois Haliot.

6
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:44,447
I'm the designer, developer, and author, writer

7
00:00:44,507 --> 00:00:47,229
of Reigns Game of Thrones and the other Reigns, too.

8
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:50,211
In various capacities, I'm the developer.

9
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:52,473
Hey, I'm Jeff Peters.

10
00:00:52,513 --> 00:00:54,955
I'm the VP of licensing and retail at HBO.

11
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:57,596
My group is in charge of basically all the consumer

12
00:00:57,637 --> 00:00:59,758
products for HBO's television shows, which

13
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:01,039
extends out to digital games.

14
00:01:01,564 --> 00:01:06,647
We were the team that worked directly with Devolver and Nereal to create this collaboration.

15
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:13,231
And so there's a lot of people behind that work at Nereal, at Devolver Digital and HBO that worked on this.

16
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:20,515
But we're the three that kind of pulled our teams and talked about what we wanted to kind of get out there about the story of this project.

17
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:25,518
So the goals and the takeaways is a very brief chat.

18
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:29,421
The first part is a very brief chat about licensed games and the relationship to brands.

19
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:34,376
That's kind of how this started. I wanted to speak about licensed games at first.

20
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:40,239
Originally it was going to be a larger panel with a lot of people that worked on a variety of licensed games,

21
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:45,602
but in talking to our mentors at GDC, they thought it was best, and I see why now,

22
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:49,445
to tell the full story as much as we can about Reigns Game of Thrones is a little more focused,

23
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:54,488
and about our experience, so hopefully it will be helpful to the audience.

24
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,892
You guys look into licensed games or have a licensed project proposed to you.

25
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:05,517
The bulk of this conversation is to be a discussion of Reign's Game of Thrones, the game.

26
00:02:05,537 --> 00:02:11,602
I list here as an unreproducible case study that hopefully can provide you guys with some action items,

27
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:19,428
some insights, some stories and anecdotes that, again, if you guys have an opportunity to work on a licensed game,

28
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:20,950
this will be of service to you.

29
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,713
I say unreproducible, and we'll get to this again later.

30
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:30,536
A lot of games, a lot of success, and a lot specifically in this project you'll see

31
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:33,840
is a matter of timing, things coming together, and a lot of luck.

32
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:38,966
I don't think people should be ashamed of admitting that success is a large part of

33
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:41,368
luck and I think that's a lot about what we'll talk about today.

34
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:44,440
And then finally, question and answer session.

35
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:46,461
Jeff would appreciate it.

36
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:50,265
I would not actually, but Jeff would appreciate it if you didn't ask about Game of Thrones

37
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:50,765
spoilers.

38
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:54,369
If you can get something out of him of substance, I will give you $100.

39
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:58,192
My wife and I would be appreciative.

40
00:02:58,332 --> 00:02:58,753
You can't.

41
00:03:00,374 --> 00:03:00,935
We'll see.

42
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:03,777
You do.

43
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:08,361
So, very quickly, and again, start chiming in whenever you have some thoughts.

44
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:13,956
The whole thing, like I said, is framed around the idea of licensed games, and it's this intersection of art and IP.

45
00:03:14,796 --> 00:03:24,878
I've always found it fascinating that there's an established brand, a licensed movie, a comic book, a breakfast cereal, and someone makes a game out of it.

46
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:28,398
In some, sometimes successful, sometimes monstrous ways.

47
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:34,680
This has changed a lot over the years. I went and did a little bit of research and looked into it.

48
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:40,455
And I think Jeff would probably agree and Francois too, in your experience in playing games, you've seen a lot of different licensed products.

49
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:47,097
Most recently, Spider-Man was a huge success that took that brand to new places and probably was one of the now

50
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:54,699
tentpole entries in what that brand and the IP is about. You also have things like AdWord Gaming, which I'm strangely attracted to.

51
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:57,720
Cool Spot was a video game for 7-Up.

52
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,441
There's a fucking video game about 7-Up's icon and people don't really care about it, but it was a way of marketing for them.

53
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:10,482
The Witcher, a lot of people probably don't think about or realize that The Witcher is based off a book, and there was a licensed property.

54
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:18,284
And then even this week, we saw Nintendo giving their license to an indie developer, of great note of course, and great success,

55
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:21,444
but they're putting out Cadence of Hyrule, which blew everyone's mind.

56
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:25,985
So a lot has happened with licensing over the past few years, and when looking at this,

57
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:30,366
and Jeff and I and Francois talked a little bit about this prior to the session,

58
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:33,627
we kind of talked about it being a spectrum.

59
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,334
This isn't a judge of quality by any means. It's just of how the game relates to a brand maybe.

60
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:45,838
So you have the standard section, again, it's not buckets, but these are games that take a brand,

61
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:49,701
make a video game out of it. They can be very high quality, like Aladdin for example,

62
00:04:49,741 --> 00:04:51,823
if you ever played it on the Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo.

63
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:54,164
Super Nintendo was the superior version, in my opinion.

64
00:04:55,645 --> 00:05:00,509
But they're basically merch. Not a bad thing. It's not a bad take on a licensed game,

65
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:02,710
but they're merch. They're translating it very directly.

66
00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:08,308
Where we move over into complementary, we see video games as a support product, right?

67
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:11,529
These are something that may do something with that brand, that story that extends it out.

68
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:14,790
An example being Enter the Matrix, which again, it's a personal one I love.

69
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:18,872
It took two characters that would wander off screen in the second Matrix movie,

70
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:22,053
and this game would tell you what the fuck did they do when they wandered off screen.

71
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:27,795
And it was really cool. As a big fan of the Matrix, and Matrix 2 and Matrix 3, I will defend them all,

72
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:32,137
that it was really neat to see how it rounded out that series.

73
00:05:32,836 --> 00:05:35,758
And then, thank you Jeff for the final section.

74
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:38,699
He named it and it's a really cool name, Exemplar.

75
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,381
These are the games that take it so far,

76
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:46,023
and this is a very sliver, a small sliver of, I think, licensed games,

77
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:48,584
take something so far that they almost,

78
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:52,086
that game actually becomes the most important part of that franchise.

79
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:55,308
As I mentioned, The Witcher before, if you walk through the halls here,

80
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:59,290
I bet 95 out of 100 people would associate it first with the game,

81
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,371
and most people would have no idea that it was a book series.

82
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:08,459
It extends these brands into absolutely new areas, things that they never expected to go and are very hard to come by.

83
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,841
But when done well, they're outstanding.

84
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:14,525
Do you guys kind of agree with this spectrum that we talked about?

85
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:20,911
Yeah, you know, it's definitely an interesting kind of way to break these things down.

86
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:26,016
When we're talking about this as a brand holder, you know, so HBO owns the IP for Game of Thrones.

87
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:30,710
You know, it's actually probably worth just taking a little step back and

88
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:34,934
sort of explaining our attitude toward licensed products and licensed gaming.

89
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:40,258
You want them to be, you know, more than just a logo slap where you're taking

90
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:41,920
Game of Thrones and putting on something, you know.

91
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,942
You can do that on a coffee mug or a t-shirt and get away with it.

92
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:47,004
But when you're talking about a game,

93
00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:49,786
those kind of things are not really that fulfilling, you know.

94
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:54,470
And we take a lot of care to make sure that the projects that we want to embark

95
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,911
on are bringing more to it than.

96
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:57,615
That sort of standard approach.

97
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,977
You get into the complimentary tier,

98
00:07:01,057 --> 00:07:02,518
and that's really what interests us.

99
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,400
We're looking for ways for our brands

100
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,861
to be enriched by a game.

101
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:09,982
And that Matrix example is a good one.

102
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:14,185
It's basically a side story, content within the world

103
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:15,285
that goes in a new place.

104
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:17,006
We've done some games like that.

105
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:19,287
Reigns is a similar thing.

106
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:23,350
We allowed the characters into the universe of Reigns.

107
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,900
And let the narrative take them places that aren't happening in the show.

108
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:31,963
The exemplar thing, when we were talking about this last week,

109
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:33,844
is to me it's a really interesting thing.

110
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:35,225
That really is kind of a holy grail.

111
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:38,307
Where if you can create something that is so powerful

112
00:07:38,347 --> 00:07:40,889
that it's almost like putting out new content altogether

113
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:43,591
in a new part of your brand.

114
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:47,414
That's just a really attractive thing as a licensor

115
00:07:47,494 --> 00:07:50,035
and as a storyteller, as a brand holder.

116
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:51,418
It's hard to do.

117
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,640
And I would say there are probably very few examples of that actually happening.

118
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,681
I actually couldn't think of many more, to be honest with you.

119
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:02,003
I mean, you could argue that Spider-Man was so big, but still, I mean, there's movies,

120
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:06,206
there's the comic books, so it's hard to really push it to that point of something so singular,

121
00:08:06,646 --> 00:08:07,146
like The Witcher.

122
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:07,746
Yeah.

123
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:17,552
Yeah, I think, indeed, also we sort of naturally tended to go towards the complimentary kind

124
00:08:17,592 --> 00:08:19,553
of position for Rang's Game of Thrones.

125
00:08:20,227 --> 00:08:30,309
Because with the size of the series and the books behind the series Game of Thrones, it's

126
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:37,070
such a very large landscape of a universe, if you want, and they created a very, very

127
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,931
strong visual universe.

128
00:08:39,271 --> 00:08:45,472
And our game could not at any point be like a substitute for that universe, and it's really

129
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:46,692
something that adds.

130
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:54,814
something that lets the player use his memories and his visual artifacts that come directly

131
00:08:54,854 --> 00:09:01,062
from the show and turn them into something else that's not related necessarily to what's

132
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:03,165
told in the series.

133
00:09:03,445 --> 00:09:05,107
So very like an extension.

134
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,672
And let players play while they wait for the new series,

135
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:15,074
while they prepare for what happens next in the show.

136
00:09:15,374 --> 00:09:18,995
And it's really in this way that it's a complementary kind

137
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:20,316
of approach, I think.

138
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:25,498
And so I think there's a whole other GDC panel on licensed

139
00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:27,238
games, because I think there's some really interesting things

140
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,520
being done, both historically and modern day.

141
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,101
And I think we really are in some golden age of licensed

142
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:34,401
games.

143
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:39,295
Which brings us to Reign's Game of Thrones, an unlikely but obvious pairing.

144
00:09:39,935 --> 00:09:43,636
Just a quick history, this was a collaboration between HBO and Nereal.

145
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:47,797
This game came out, if you're not familiar with it, it did come out the end of last year

146
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:49,858
on mobile and on Steam.

147
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:54,019
It'll be coming out three days before season 8 starts on Nintendo Switch.

148
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:55,679
Good timing.

149
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,920
Yeah, we planned that out remarkably well.

150
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,780
That's seemingly the publisher's smart ideas, I think.

151
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:03,749
It's a case study.

152
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:07,752
The reason we're here is it's a case study on how a small developer, a small development

153
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:14,457
team can work with a global brand and how it can, much to honestly our shock, work out

154
00:10:14,537 --> 00:10:15,218
super smoothly.

155
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:19,882
Again, a lot of luck and the people involved as we make this happen, but it was a story

156
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:20,802
that I think was worth telling.

157
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:23,725
Again, like I said, it's unreproducible.

158
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,788
And by the way, unreproducible and irreproducible are both words and I changed this three times

159
00:10:27,808 --> 00:10:28,549
in this presentation.

160
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:29,690
But unreproducible luck.

161
00:10:30,349 --> 00:10:34,511
is contributing factor. So it's hard to replicate and I don't think you know this doesn't sound like

162
00:10:35,392 --> 00:10:40,415
sounds real self-congratulatory. It's not. It's really an attribution and nod to the fact that

163
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:45,859
this is a lot of luck and timing involved here. So there's some discussion points walking through

164
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,402
everything from collaboration to release and then learning. And in the interest of time I just want

165
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:55,586
to jump right into the collaboration. I'd love for you guys to tell the story from both your sides.

166
00:10:56,126 --> 00:10:58,248
How did this collaboration come into being?

167
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:02,675
Yeah, so why don't I start with my little anecdote.

168
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:07,078
Um, this, uh, the, this game kind of hit our radar.

169
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:10,960
Um, you know, I've got some folks on my staff who are over here who are kind of our game team.

170
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,821
And they, they knew about Reigns.

171
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:15,963
And, you know, the, the original game got some really great love.

172
00:11:16,603 --> 00:11:18,384
And, uh, for, you know, well-deserved it.

173
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:20,325
And, and so it was sort of on our radar.

174
00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:21,706
It's like, that's an interesting game.

175
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:27,270
And you guys at Devolver had been trying to kind of figure out how to have a conversation with us

176
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,210
because you were thinking...

177
00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:32,654
You know, maybe there's something there with that, you know, that mega show Game of Thrones.

178
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,017
You had made contact through a third party that we both work with

179
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:41,259
and somebody knew somebody who called somebody else and eventually an email ended up on my

180
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,142
in my inbox. And we had a very quick

181
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:49,124
back and forth exchange saying like, this could be interesting. So, two or three

182
00:11:49,144 --> 00:11:52,967
days later, I don't remember exactly how long, we got an email from Dan Weiss

183
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:56,269
who's one of the creators of Game of Thrones. And Dan said,

184
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,568
We're over here in Belfast shooting, I think they were shooting season seven.

185
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:01,810
Have you guys heard of this game Reigns?

186
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,192
Like, we're obsessed and we're playing it all the time.

187
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:06,114
Could we do that for Game of Thrones?

188
00:12:06,134 --> 00:12:07,115
Could you guys make that happen?

189
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:10,738
And, I mean, talk about making me look good.

190
00:12:10,838 --> 00:12:13,660
We were able to just literally, like say, oh yeah, we know those guys.

191
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,221
No problem.

192
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:15,602
We'll, you know, we'll hook you up.

193
00:12:16,223 --> 00:12:19,465
And so it was, I mean, it was the ultimate, like, you know,

194
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:20,987
smooth moment for me professionally.

195
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:21,787
So that was great.

196
00:12:22,668 --> 00:12:24,990
But then, you know, knowing that they were really into this.

197
00:12:25,815 --> 00:12:28,636
You know, it was an immediate like, yeah, let's see if we can make this happen.

198
00:12:30,157 --> 00:12:34,119
You know, and then we'll get deeper in after that, but that was kind of our like little kismet moment.

199
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:41,322
And then getting from there to getting a game done is the whole rest of the story that, you know, there's some interesting twists and turns along the way.

200
00:12:41,923 --> 00:12:49,026
And Francois, do you mind, I know, I mean, because I'm involved, I know the story of when you first pitched the original Reigns to our team.

201
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:49,366
Yeah.

202
00:12:49,987 --> 00:12:51,567
So yeah, that was in 2015, December.

203
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:56,183
And I sent a pitch to a developer

204
00:12:56,743 --> 00:13:03,489
because I didn't do any eat before that.

205
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:06,312
So that was like I was starting as an indie, if you want.

206
00:13:06,992 --> 00:13:10,035
Very much indie, like the proper one who was scrubbing.

207
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:17,052
Anyway, so I was a send a mail to Frank Parker saying,

208
00:13:17,393 --> 00:13:19,073
OK, I got this great concept.

209
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:22,214
It's a mix of Tinder and Game of Thrones.

210
00:13:22,474 --> 00:13:26,935
And that's how I sold the game to Devolver in a way.

211
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:28,975
And then, yeah, I remember afterwards,

212
00:13:28,995 --> 00:13:31,476
we were like, remember the brains, or sorry,

213
00:13:31,516 --> 00:13:35,357
Tinder, Game of Thrones concept, but that's how you pitched it.

214
00:13:35,877 --> 00:13:36,597
What if we could do that?

215
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:38,238
Yeah.

216
00:13:38,438 --> 00:13:38,978
And I was a

217
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:42,175
I totally didn't expect, even at that point,

218
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:44,884
even after the success of RANKS, to actually make a...

219
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,851
So we got a deal done, right?

220
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:53,854
Well, we started on a deal. How did you, this is questions for Jeff,

221
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:58,116
how did you push this internally? Like, if you have the producers,

222
00:13:58,216 --> 00:14:00,697
but how did you work through HBO? Because I kind of think that's important.

223
00:14:00,777 --> 00:14:05,620
Yeah, that's definitely worth mentioning. Every company is different,

224
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,402
obviously, but from our, with our process,

225
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:13,644
there's several rungs of a ladder you have to climb.

226
00:14:14,302 --> 00:14:15,602
You know, on this one.

227
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:17,503
And Dan and David are one of them.

228
00:14:17,963 --> 00:14:19,764
They kind of, we hit that rung early

229
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:20,904
because they wanted to do this.

230
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:24,426
But then, you know, we, the next step was, you know,

231
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,087
to begin talking to you guys about a business deal.

232
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:26,967
What is the deal here?

233
00:14:27,707 --> 00:14:31,309
And, you know, it's worth noting that when, you know,

234
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:32,990
when we do a deal for, for example,

235
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,230
for a big free-to-play game,

236
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,892
that's a much bigger financial opportunity,

237
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:40,713
which comes with completely different royalty rates

238
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:42,213
and guarantees and all these things.

239
00:14:42,808 --> 00:14:47,549
We looked at this, we couldn't hold them hostage for a gigantic minimum guarantee

240
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:49,430
because that's just not how the business works.

241
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,111
Also we don't have a gigantic minimum guarantee to give you.

242
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:53,711
Right, it would have died on the line right then.

243
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:54,612
Right.

244
00:14:54,672 --> 00:14:58,273
So we're lucky that we can come with some flexibility in that sense.

245
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:01,174
And so we began thinking about, well, what could we accept?

246
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:01,974
What would make sense?

247
00:15:02,854 --> 00:15:07,416
We immediately pitched this internally to the executives

248
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:09,657
that have sort of a check mark for us.

249
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:17,609
as a Halo game, as something that is going to bring, you know, it fits perfectly with the show.

250
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:23,812
It's got this really great point of view and a stylistic view that we really like,

251
00:15:23,952 --> 00:15:27,874
and we just had this vision. We actually asked you guys, I think, to mock up what Tyrion would

252
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:30,976
look like and what Daenerys would look like. Yeah, there's some examples, early examples here on the

253
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:35,618
screen of like, they needed to have art to show. Yeah, so having some art was excellent, because

254
00:15:35,658 --> 00:15:38,519
it's, you know, it's one thing to just say, yeah, it's a game where you swipe left and right.

255
00:15:39,061 --> 00:15:41,861
But being able to show what it's really going to look like was helpful.

256
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:49,383
We also have to take our digital deals to George Martin, who's the creator of the books and the universe.

257
00:15:49,403 --> 00:15:52,283
So we have a close relationship with him on gaming in particular.

258
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:54,264
And so we had to be able to pitch his team.

259
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:58,745
And we worked pretty closely with you guys to help hone that.

260
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:01,665
It took a while. It was probably a better part of a year.

261
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:05,106
That was one thing that, you know, if they could teach about...

262
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:09,458
make a point about is it's the one thing that will not change.

263
00:16:09,498 --> 00:16:14,500
I bet most licensed games whether you guys or any other license or is it just takes so

264
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,982
much time and you actually have to build that obviously not into like I want to get this

265
00:16:18,022 --> 00:16:23,806
approved but the process in general is it's not going to turn around a license game very

266
00:16:23,846 --> 00:16:29,489
quickly because there may be you know to me I'm talking to Will and Dustin and Jeff.

267
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,872
But then there's a lot of people that I've never talked to or never see

268
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:37,154
that have to approve these things. And it's kind of mind-blowing to think about.

269
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:40,097
Because we as a company, and I know Francois' company,

270
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:42,679
we're pretty quick to turn things around because there's only a few people.

271
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,581
But you have to keep in mind how many people have to approve this.

272
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:49,203
And then, I mean, we can talk about now or later,

273
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:51,085
but the casting thing I didn't even think about.

274
00:16:51,105 --> 00:16:53,687
I had no idea about how casting works and the talent.

275
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:57,290
Yeah, and I think overall the...

276
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,021
The making of the game was nine months,

277
00:17:00,301 --> 00:17:03,082
and signing the contracts was a year.

278
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:04,922
So that was longer than making the game.

279
00:17:05,803 --> 00:17:07,343
But that's totally fine.

280
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:09,044
But you made Reigns for Majesty in the meantime.

281
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:09,404
So that was fine.

282
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:09,824
Yeah, exactly.

283
00:17:09,844 --> 00:17:11,245
I made another game in the meantime.

284
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:12,325
That was actually really helpful,

285
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:13,746
that you guys had something to work on.

286
00:17:13,926 --> 00:17:14,586
Yeah.

287
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:15,706
Yeah, we were on a series.

288
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:17,167
Definitely.

289
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:21,849
It's definitely that internal approval process,

290
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:22,889
but it's also legal.

291
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,890
We are big corporations, and we have.

292
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:29,805
Very rigid legal department, so we had to negotiate an agreement with you guys and go through that.

293
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:31,346
Doesn't happen overnight.

294
00:17:32,126 --> 00:17:38,610
Um, you know, it's uh, it, it, it, I will say as a, you know, a testament to you guys, you hung in there with us all the way.

295
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,491
You know, and we're there and, and, uh.

296
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:42,692
We weren't doing anything else really.

297
00:17:42,932 --> 00:17:43,452
Ha ha ha.

298
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:44,573
Just hanging out.

299
00:17:44,873 --> 00:17:45,133
Yeah.

300
00:17:45,654 --> 00:17:52,758
But, uh, it's, that's an important thing, you know, if we're speaking to folks who maybe, you know, want to have an idea to do something like this with a licensed property.

301
00:17:53,318 --> 00:17:59,963
You know, I would say just from our perspective, some advice is you do need to come with some flexibility and,

302
00:17:59,983 --> 00:18:04,525
you know, perseverance and, you know, and kind of patience.

303
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:08,087
And we try to be really communicative on our side.

304
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:09,308
Like we try to keep you posted.

305
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:13,171
And I always say I never really mind when people bug me saying like, do you have an update?

306
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:13,891
Do you have an update?

307
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:16,893
You know, I'll be happy to tell you no, we don't have an update.

308
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,454
That could be different with a different licensor.

309
00:18:19,494 --> 00:18:21,275
You know, you have to probably gauge that.

310
00:18:21,315 --> 00:18:22,936
Like what's the back and forth like?

311
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,021
It is a process and it's going to be different for every project.

312
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,302
We had to think about things like our other digital game projects that were underway.

313
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:32,863
How do we launch this one?

314
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,563
What time does it go out?

315
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:37,724
You know, you're talking about marketing, you know, and user acquisition.

316
00:18:37,744 --> 00:18:40,845
You know, if we've got one other game that's out there in the market buying ads

317
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:45,527
and doing a big spend for Game of Thrones, it's not a great idea to put out a second one

318
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:48,708
so you're both competing and you're just driving up the spend rates for everybody.

319
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:54,410
So we try to be very organized with that and kind of put things out, like an air traffic controller.

320
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,191
Got a bunch of planes to take off, how do we do it the right way?

321
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:01,672
And that's all a part of the internal discussion.

322
00:19:02,493 --> 00:19:05,994
So that leads me to a question for Francois, because there's this big machine working,

323
00:19:06,574 --> 00:19:10,595
and obviously you have this, I think I say here, cultural phenomenon at Game of Thrones.

324
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:15,257
What were you and your team, what were you thinking? Were you scared of this?

325
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,178
Yeah, I think...

326
00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:26,809
I think we were very proud because I'm a big fan of the book.

327
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:35,891
I can show you my 1996 edition of Game of Thrones and of the series that we watched

328
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:37,031
a couple of times before.

329
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:43,812
So that was a huge thing as a fan to be able to touch this and play with it and make something

330
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:44,052
with it.

331
00:19:44,112 --> 00:19:48,033
So that was, I think, a big responsibility in a way.

332
00:19:50,421 --> 00:20:00,310
And also, yeah, all this process that sort of, we sort of inherited like a year of discussing

333
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,351
this deal and stuff.

334
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:09,157
And so we, the production phase couldn't fail, you know, yeah.

335
00:20:09,297 --> 00:20:14,842
We had a certain pressure to make things happen in a continuous and...

336
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:22,246
with quality, but with the aim of getting somewhere in the time that we defined,

337
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:25,087
because that made sense for your air traffic control.

338
00:20:25,127 --> 00:20:31,669
So we couldn't actually postpone like I would have done for another project.

339
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:35,230
We couldn't postpone the thing too long, I think.

340
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,131
And then the final part of the collaboration,

341
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:39,971
you've mentioned a little bit of this.

342
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:40,771
This is for Jeff.

343
00:20:43,027 --> 00:20:45,329
You know, it's still surprising to me, even to this day.

344
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,051
And we appreciate it, but

345
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:49,993
was there pushback on a small team,

346
00:20:50,194 --> 00:20:52,496
small team working on a pretty, I don't know,

347
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:54,417
different kind of game for

348
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:56,459
your flagship IP at HBO, I assume?

349
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,022
The pushback is maybe too strong of a word, but it is.

350
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:03,265
That was something that I had to basically have an answer for

351
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:05,247
when I went up to my executive team.

352
00:21:05,627 --> 00:21:08,670
I had to say to them, look, this isn't, you know, this isn't EA.

353
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:11,998
But this is why we think it's an interesting opportunity.

354
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:17,862
I hate to interrupt, but I think that you guys are known, you have a bunch of very successful,

355
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:21,364
free to play, I think, Game of Thrones games, right? And bigger games.

356
00:21:22,225 --> 00:21:25,787
But was there concern, I mean, did you guys go in and say,

357
00:21:25,847 --> 00:21:30,290
look, there's a pretty limited financial gain to be had here, comparatively?

358
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,032
Yeah. Yeah, that was definitely part of the analysis.

359
00:21:33,052 --> 00:21:35,034
And it's always one of the questions, well, what are we going to earn?

360
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:45,961
The, again, so that, that feeds into the presentation and I, you know, I, I feel personally at HBO,

361
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:51,484
I have a luxury of being able to say, we want to do something because it's a halo product.

362
00:21:51,985 --> 00:21:56,107
This is something that is going to be, you know, it's, it's going to get some shine.

363
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:59,369
It's not just putting out something to crank out royalty checks.

364
00:22:01,255 --> 00:22:02,136
That's not always the case.

365
00:22:02,536 --> 00:22:05,357
Some licensors, some companies really aren't,

366
00:22:06,077 --> 00:22:06,997
they're not that focused on that.

367
00:22:07,017 --> 00:22:08,618
They're much more about mass plays

368
00:22:08,678 --> 00:22:10,659
and really maximizing earnings.

369
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:13,019
So that's sort of how we position it.

370
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,440
And we've done this in many other things,

371
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,821
like jewelry and sneakers and other things like that,

372
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:21,622
where we maybe aren't gonna earn a ton,

373
00:22:21,782 --> 00:22:24,984
but the attention you're gonna get,

374
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:28,025
the fan reaction, the surprise,

375
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:29,805
and all of that is valuable to us.

376
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:35,068
So this was really positioned that way as this is a game that just makes so much sense.

377
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:41,130
When we put it out there, yeah, we're not going to, you know, fund a new season of a

378
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:46,312
Game of Thrones spin-off on the royalty checks from this project, but the value is going

379
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:46,712
to be there.

380
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:53,233
And we were right, you know, the reaction to this game was fantastic and it's exactly

381
00:22:53,273 --> 00:22:53,934
what we did it for.

382
00:22:54,454 --> 00:22:55,194
Awesome, thank you.

383
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:55,494
Yeah.

384
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,411
So I'm going to move on to the concept production.

385
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:00,472
And we've kind of gone over a little bit of this already,

386
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:02,012
so this is going to be a flowing thing.

387
00:23:02,052 --> 00:23:05,974
But I think that first question for Francois.

388
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:09,336
So you mentioned you obviously read the books since 1996,

389
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:11,637
watched the show.

390
00:23:12,377 --> 00:23:14,718
What was your, I mean, what kind of research did you do?

391
00:23:14,778 --> 00:23:16,639
Did you go back because it seems like a pretty overwhelming,

392
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:19,200
like I'm still amazed actually myself of the detail,

393
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,701
you know, what kind of research did you do before you started?

394
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:31,976
So, yeah, I did a lot of research and that's where the fact that you play with a universe

395
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:40,500
and not just a single IP that's not very well known, is that you got like a corpus of information

396
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:40,880
and of...

397
00:23:41,401 --> 00:23:47,524
But that's very, very detailed and very afford, like you got like the canon, you got...

398
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,180
fan theories and all this is very, very clear.

399
00:23:51,421 --> 00:23:55,904
There's like a continent of information you can go through

400
00:23:56,725 --> 00:24:01,608
that's been criticized and reviewed by people.

401
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:05,952
So you can very easily find information about everything.

402
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,883
From the on of winter, if you take some sort of details that are just spread out in the

403
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:18,087
series, to very obvious things like the wall and so on and so forth.

404
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:25,654
So you can really easily, and that's really like three things for me.

405
00:24:25,954 --> 00:24:31,299
That's the Tibris series, the first things that we really looked into and researched,

406
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:33,521
the books and the fan site.

407
00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:43,054
But that's always interesting for us, especially because our game, in a way, is a bit like

408
00:24:43,174 --> 00:24:47,758
a fan fiction simulator, in a way.

409
00:24:47,818 --> 00:24:51,781
This is, in the end, what we sort of created.

410
00:24:52,181 --> 00:24:58,085
We wanted the player to be able to tell himself, to bring the story where he could imagine

411
00:24:58,145 --> 00:24:58,506
it to go.

412
00:24:59,346 --> 00:25:03,869
That was really what we wanted to do, and that's what fan fiction is.

413
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:11,496
So that was relevant to look at that material, and it's a very extremely detailed material

414
00:25:11,536 --> 00:25:13,438
on the Internet for Game of Thrones.

415
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,522
So one of the things that I think surprised me in the process, and this is what I wanted

416
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:22,265
to ask you guys about it, and I think maybe would be helpful for the folks watching here,

417
00:25:22,846 --> 00:25:25,728
is this idea of an approval process versus a collaboration.

418
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:26,869
Because I went into this...

419
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:32,275
Honestly thinking again big scary corporation that I didn't know yet that it would be approval process

420
00:25:32,295 --> 00:25:35,578
You send something and they tell you to know to X things, right?

421
00:25:35,598 --> 00:25:36,819
And then you have to go back and do it

422
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:42,503
But what was surprising I think probably to I know to you and I was that it was pretty collaborative

423
00:25:43,044 --> 00:25:46,446
Yeah, so can you guys talk a little bit about the process?

424
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:51,531
Maybe how in general you do it as a licensor and then you know Francois maybe about how it worked with Game of Thrones

425
00:25:51,971 --> 00:25:52,551
Yeah, yeah

426
00:25:52,772 --> 00:25:53,172
so

427
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:58,451
We have a lot of approvals that we have to do.

428
00:25:58,511 --> 00:26:00,332
We have to really think as the brand holder,

429
00:26:01,413 --> 00:26:03,795
anything we put out there public has to be on brand.

430
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:06,777
It has to not create a headache.

431
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:09,900
I would wake up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night

432
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,822
thinking, oh, did we put out something that somebody's

433
00:26:12,842 --> 00:26:15,124
going to be pissed off that we put in it?

434
00:26:15,204 --> 00:26:18,707
So we take good care to make sure we're really

435
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:21,749
doing something that's, one, going to do the brand proud,

436
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,951
but two, work in our universe.

437
00:26:25,774 --> 00:26:27,635
Talent likeness is a big thing.

438
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:28,176
Right.

439
00:26:28,476 --> 00:26:34,239
Again, a lot of, every company is different in this case, but for Game of Thrones, our actors have the right to approve those illustrations.

440
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:34,419
Right.

441
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:41,363
And so that requires us to get the drawings, send it out to their representatives, they'll look at it, they may request changes.

442
00:26:41,884 --> 00:26:42,744
I think mostly in this case-

443
00:26:42,764 --> 00:26:44,485
And this is the talent themselves to clarify, like-

444
00:26:44,765 --> 00:26:45,606
Correct, the actors.

445
00:26:45,686 --> 00:26:50,869
Yeah, the actors. I mean, some of them their agent does it for them or their manager, some of them, you know, the actor themselves.

446
00:26:51,329 --> 00:26:53,491
Peter Dinklage is all, you know, you'll just write your right back.

447
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:54,371
That's cool.

448
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,092
Yeah, yeah.

449
00:26:56,216 --> 00:27:00,397
But the, you know, that's a whole other process. That's something we had to work in.

450
00:27:01,898 --> 00:27:08,000
The story was very much a concern for us, because this is a very narrative driven game.

451
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:13,223
We're putting it out in between season 7 and 8, and you know, the finale is coming.

452
00:27:13,663 --> 00:27:18,825
And we had to make sure we weren't putting in something that was going to be, you know, wrong for the game.

453
00:27:19,925 --> 00:27:22,426
And so we had to really take care and think about that.

454
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:24,147
You know, you guys would submit.

455
00:27:24,938 --> 00:27:28,821
outlines and narratives and my team would just pour through them

456
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:31,403
and make sure something wasn't incorrect.

457
00:27:31,643 --> 00:27:36,907
I remember one specific thing, I think it was Cersei,

458
00:27:36,927 --> 00:27:40,089
it was about Daenerys, but something that Will, who's sitting up here,

459
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,373
was like, well, no, her braid is usually over here, and her part is here.

460
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:48,336
It was something so specific, and there's things I didn't think about.

461
00:27:48,356 --> 00:27:49,637
I was like, that just looks like Cersei, right?

462
00:27:51,692 --> 00:27:56,654
There's a lot of details that the actor and then the brand holder is going to want to get right.

463
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:01,876
Yeah, and I would say, you know, one of the reasons why we get really specific like that is because

464
00:28:02,857 --> 00:28:07,879
Game of Thrones in particular, there's a fan base out there that notices those things and doesn't like it.

465
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:12,821
You know, they want it to be on. So we're really careful on all that stuff.

466
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:16,863
I was going to say, to that point, I just realized, sorry, but I just realized looking at this.

467
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,090
On the left is the pitch, right?

468
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,870
It's the pitch image.

469
00:28:20,051 --> 00:28:21,091
On the right is the final image.

470
00:28:21,111 --> 00:28:22,211
And that's how long, we were talking

471
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:23,171
about how long the deal took.

472
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:25,792
A lot happened at Xerces between that pitch

473
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:28,753
and when the game came out.

474
00:28:29,253 --> 00:28:30,874
She rose to power and also got a haircut.

475
00:28:30,914 --> 00:28:31,194
Yeah.

476
00:28:31,354 --> 00:28:33,975
It's also in the final image, we decided

477
00:28:34,015 --> 00:28:36,456
the setting, which was around season seven.

478
00:28:36,496 --> 00:28:40,337
So yeah, we had to stick to how she looked at that point.

479
00:28:41,157 --> 00:28:42,177
So talk about, sorry to interrupt,

480
00:28:42,217 --> 00:28:43,598
talk about the approval from your side.

481
00:28:44,018 --> 00:28:45,118
I think the approval.

482
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:54,652
And especially at my level, the collaboration with Will, who is a Vervarian, was very interesting

483
00:28:54,692 --> 00:29:00,135
also because it's not just like some sort of censorship process that just cuts your

484
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:01,977
thing or tells you, no, you can't do that.

485
00:29:02,277 --> 00:29:03,057
He never said that.

486
00:29:03,097 --> 00:29:05,779
He said always you should do that instead.

487
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:11,943
It's more like a collaboration, since he always was always bringing something new to

488
00:29:11,963 --> 00:29:13,865
the game that was adding value to it.

489
00:29:15,568 --> 00:29:19,809
I can, because I looked at a few discussions we had,

490
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:23,750
and that's a very interesting way of explaining

491
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,170
how we made the game better together.

492
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:32,591
That's not, it's where the collaboration with the license

493
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:33,552
was interesting.

494
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,312
So for example, I had this card, okay,

495
00:29:36,392 --> 00:29:39,473
a delegation of archmasters from the Citadel is here.

496
00:29:39,493 --> 00:29:42,273
They are asking you to select the next Grand Maester.

497
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:45,659
So we'll say, I don't think this set of cards works.

498
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:48,360
The maesters are pretty much an apolitical organization,

499
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,621
and the grand maester is selected by the archmaesters,

500
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:53,542
not by the ruler of Westeros, which was totally true

501
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:54,762
and totally right.

502
00:29:55,362 --> 00:29:58,623
So to this I answer, and this is where you see the discussion

503
00:29:58,643 --> 00:30:02,364
and where we come to something that's a bit better and more

504
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:02,824
interesting.

505
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:05,985
I answer to that, yes, you're right, but without choice,

506
00:30:06,185 --> 00:30:06,805
we need cards.

507
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:10,052
like that to recruit a new maester if need be.

508
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:12,576
If you killed the maester and you need to recruit a new one,

509
00:30:12,816 --> 00:30:13,457
how do you do that?

510
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:16,682
That's me as a game designer who say, I need this in a way.

511
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,665
And his answer is very interesting

512
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:21,729
because that's how we put things forward if you want.

513
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:24,319
They could be executed in a more devious way.

514
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:28,421
I think it's reasonable that the king-queen will want to influence who is appointed Grand

515
00:30:28,461 --> 00:30:31,602
Maester, but we should not make it as simple as speaking like this.

516
00:30:31,642 --> 00:30:37,645
So you see how the discussion sort of brought the design forward and made the game better

517
00:30:37,705 --> 00:30:38,065
in the end.

518
00:30:38,105 --> 00:30:42,867
And we had that sort of thing on the 1,600 cards of the game, if you want.

519
00:30:43,187 --> 00:30:49,650
So that process was very much a process to bring quality to the game and not just say,

520
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,691
you can't put that.

521
00:30:51,711 --> 00:30:54,154
If I can't do that, what do I do?

522
00:30:54,174 --> 00:31:00,061
He very much understood the way I was designing my thing,

523
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:00,562
if you want.

524
00:31:00,602 --> 00:31:01,503
That's very important.

525
00:31:01,803 --> 00:31:03,625
Another one, because that's a funny one.

526
00:31:06,801 --> 00:31:09,202
So it's like, so one of the card was,

527
00:31:09,403 --> 00:31:11,744
dragon is afflicted with an acute lethargy.

528
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:13,425
I'm unable to cure.

529
00:31:13,445 --> 00:31:14,646
Do you wish to see him?

530
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:15,686
So that was one of the card.

531
00:31:16,027 --> 00:31:18,628
And we'll say to this, can you remind me,

532
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:20,949
what is the story with dragon being asleep like this?

533
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,791
Like, don't fuck with my dragons, you know?

534
00:31:23,391 --> 00:31:24,732
So, yeah.

535
00:31:24,772 --> 00:31:29,134
So we had a lot of, but always in a tone that was helpful

536
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:32,196
and not just saying, don't do that.

537
00:31:32,276 --> 00:31:33,617
It's not going to work.

538
00:31:33,677 --> 00:31:34,718
That's just, yeah.

539
00:31:35,134 --> 00:31:37,057
An example of collaboration.

540
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:40,802
And the last thing I wanted to ask about, I mean we've kind of talked about it a little

541
00:31:40,822 --> 00:31:45,608
bit, but what was a surprise to me, and again I would love to communicate to the audience

542
00:31:45,648 --> 00:31:52,777
here is you get blessed with this universe, right, to work with, but you don't...

543
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:57,713
Business reasons will prevent you from being able to work with all parts of it, right?

544
00:31:57,853 --> 00:31:59,074
So, for example, the casting.

545
00:31:59,314 --> 00:32:01,015
We just mentioned the approval process, but

546
00:32:01,315 --> 00:32:04,718
we can't put 400 individual actors in this game, right?

547
00:32:04,998 --> 00:32:07,059
Right, yeah, we have some limitations.

548
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:10,141
And again, this is all unique to our business, but

549
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:14,484
there's only so many actors we can put in a thing before too much.

550
00:32:14,964 --> 00:32:18,667
And they participate, they're paid out of our royalties as they should be.

551
00:32:20,228 --> 00:32:22,850
And so we have a cap, we only have so many we can put in.

552
00:32:23,772 --> 00:32:30,157
And that was difficult because I remember, Francois, you had sort of this archetypal list of,

553
00:32:30,237 --> 00:32:34,261
we need somebody to, you know, because we're melding in your existing game engine.

554
00:32:34,961 --> 00:32:36,803
We need all of these characters. How do we do them?

555
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:40,406
And so we had to come up with things like, well, all right, you're going to have to have just like,

556
00:32:40,686 --> 00:32:45,410
instead of Lord Janos Slint, the captain of the City Watch,

557
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:48,493
we have to have a generic captain of the City Watch.

558
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,195
And let's write it, let's craft a different name for that guy.

559
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:54,405
We had to be a little flexible on that stuff.

560
00:32:55,765 --> 00:33:00,306
Generic, stark soldier instead of a guy that you know from the show, that type of thing.

561
00:33:00,486 --> 00:33:02,407
Yeah, that was a little surprising to me, I know.

562
00:33:02,687 --> 00:33:08,668
Yeah, I think also one good thing for that particular range of approvals,

563
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:11,129
which are the visual approvals for the talents,

564
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:16,930
the good thing about Rangs is that you got one portrait of Cersei,

565
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,150
one portrait of Jaime.

566
00:33:18,906 --> 00:33:22,288
Although difficult it is to do Jamie, that's another problem.

567
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:24,610
One portrait of each of the characters.

568
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:30,775
So you don't, we don't have like eight months of production to get to the point where we

569
00:33:30,815 --> 00:33:33,397
got all the visuals of Tyrion, if you want.

570
00:33:33,757 --> 00:33:42,384
And that makes it, that's very useful because we were able to work in priority on these

571
00:33:42,424 --> 00:33:46,808
visuals at the start, in the first three, four months of the project.

572
00:33:47,201 --> 00:33:51,491
to be able to submit them to approval, and it takes quite a long time.

573
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,520
We were a bit worried at some point.

574
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:59,083
And just to be able to, in parallel, work on the story,

575
00:33:59,143 --> 00:34:03,166
because the story, we don't need the approval from the license

576
00:34:03,186 --> 00:34:06,668
team, but not from Tyrion on what he says in the game.

577
00:34:06,968 --> 00:34:11,731
So this is how we manage the overall process

578
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:13,212
of the production.

579
00:34:13,232 --> 00:34:16,634
It's like we had to prioritize a few things

580
00:34:16,714 --> 00:34:20,016
to get the approval in time for the release, if you want.

581
00:34:21,002 --> 00:34:24,584
I also, this reminds me of a key moment in the game design,

582
00:34:25,224 --> 00:34:28,126
where the original Reigns game and Her Majesty,

583
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,246
there's one monarch.

584
00:34:29,606 --> 00:34:31,367
It's, you know, he gets a new name

585
00:34:31,407 --> 00:34:32,708
every time he's regenerated.

586
00:34:32,808 --> 00:34:35,650
But we, when we started talking about this,

587
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,431
we said, well, who is sitting on the throne?

588
00:34:37,491 --> 00:34:39,332
Like, are we really gonna pick one?

589
00:34:39,352 --> 00:34:39,752
Right.

590
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:42,334
You know, like, can we really pick one?

591
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:43,254
I don't know if we can.

592
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:49,258
And that, you know, the design twist on that was,

593
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:49,738
okay, well.

594
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,821
These are visions that Melisandre's having.

595
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:56,002
We kicked around several different ideas on both sides

596
00:34:56,062 --> 00:34:58,303
and had a really long back and forth, how do we do that?

597
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:01,045
How do you have different Game of Thrones characters sitting

598
00:35:01,085 --> 00:35:04,927
on the throne who don't belong there necessarily?

599
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:08,868
And when we did finally land on that visions in the fire thing,

600
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:10,249
it was like, aha.

601
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:13,691
And that also then influenced, well,

602
00:35:14,331 --> 00:35:16,512
which actors do we need to put in this thing?

603
00:35:17,352 --> 00:35:19,354
And it was all a really complex kind of...

604
00:35:19,394 --> 00:35:22,776
Yeah, I remember that very precisely.

605
00:35:22,836 --> 00:35:24,337
There's a lot of talk about that.

606
00:35:24,397 --> 00:35:26,419
Yeah, we spent a lot of time...

607
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:30,702
Because the first idea we had was to imagine, you know,

608
00:35:30,722 --> 00:35:35,066
at some point Daenerys ends up in the Tower of Warlocks in Qarth.

609
00:35:35,146 --> 00:35:38,528
And that could have been all the visions she got at that point.

610
00:35:38,589 --> 00:35:40,650
And that was in season 7, so that was...

611
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,932
Or 6, I don't remember.

612
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,394
That's season 2, man. That was a long time ago.

613
00:35:48,175 --> 00:35:49,916
That was actually a big fan.

614
00:35:49,956 --> 00:35:52,437
That's the reason why we didn't.

615
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,297
That was our complaint.

616
00:35:53,337 --> 00:35:54,838
We were like, that was season two.

617
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:56,418
It was very long ago.

618
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,120
Yes, yes, true.

619
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,242
But yeah, so that would have been an interesting way to mix up,

620
00:36:05,202 --> 00:36:06,783
explain that we got visions in the game.

621
00:36:07,403 --> 00:36:09,805
But the idea of Mélissandre was interesting,

622
00:36:11,105 --> 00:36:12,566
much more interesting because she's got...

623
00:36:13,581 --> 00:36:19,424
She failed a bit with Stannis, so she's looking for the new king or the new queen to follow.

624
00:36:20,164 --> 00:36:27,808
And that gives a very interesting motive to the game that really vibrates very well with

625
00:36:27,888 --> 00:36:28,669
the series.

626
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:33,311
And her fallibility, which we've seen in the show, like she's certain she had the right

627
00:36:33,331 --> 00:36:34,292
guy and it wasn't true.

628
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:39,334
That worked perfectly in this thing, because we figured, oh, well, every time you regenerate,

629
00:36:39,374 --> 00:36:41,175
it's her being like, oh, no, that wasn't it.

630
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:42,136
Maybe it was Sansa.

631
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,560
Maybe it's Jon Snow.

632
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,901
It worked out really well for this.

633
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:49,622
And that's what I guess the goal of this particular section is.

634
00:36:49,922 --> 00:36:52,803
If you're working with somebody, and we're obviously very fortunate,

635
00:36:53,443 --> 00:36:56,524
but if you're working with somebody on a licensed game like this,

636
00:36:56,984 --> 00:37:01,586
the collaborative process versus just the simple approval process is ultra important.

637
00:37:01,826 --> 00:37:05,227
So it makes a, maybe from the standard thing that we talked about,

638
00:37:05,547 --> 00:37:06,727
to something more complimentary.

639
00:37:07,585 --> 00:37:13,949
Because you're doing something that adds the experience of your fan base to your fan base and the license's fan base.

640
00:37:14,509 --> 00:37:17,071
We don't have time to really delve into it. This was part of the discussion, but

641
00:37:17,752 --> 00:37:21,954
Francois shared this. This is the, if you pull the hood back on any Reigns game,

642
00:37:22,515 --> 00:37:25,397
it's an effin' spreadsheet, right?

643
00:37:25,437 --> 00:37:28,178
It's just thousands of choices that can be made and where it goes.

644
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:33,077
Yeah, and these would be dumped over to Will to like home to approve.

645
00:37:33,137 --> 00:37:36,618
So yeah, so that's just a shared spreadsheet if you want.

646
00:37:36,698 --> 00:37:44,661
And the whole process was good for this is that we had one single shared spreadsheet.

647
00:37:45,821 --> 00:37:47,762
I was not sending text to approve.

648
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,271
It was sending it back with a red pencil.

649
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:52,751
No, so it's not like that.

650
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:56,913
We had a full process, and it could

651
00:37:56,953 --> 00:37:58,634
change the status of each line.

652
00:37:58,714 --> 00:38:02,315
And we come back, we read it, and this

653
00:38:02,355 --> 00:38:03,856
is how the game was made.

654
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:05,436
And you got 1,600 lines like that.

655
00:38:05,557 --> 00:38:10,058
And the last little bit of the actual game

656
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:11,699
was the marketing release.

657
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:16,481
I do work with a lot of the marketing at Devolver Digital.

658
00:38:17,032 --> 00:38:21,353
And so, you know, one of the things, and I want to hear Francois and Jeff's take on it,

659
00:38:21,393 --> 00:38:23,574
but one of the interesting things is, okay, when you're getting ready,

660
00:38:23,854 --> 00:38:27,255
the game was very close to completion before we announced it.

661
00:38:27,415 --> 00:38:31,096
I mean, there wasn't a whole lot left because it was a lengthy approval process.

662
00:38:31,116 --> 00:38:33,896
We didn't want to announce it and then just kind of shrug our shoulders while we're waiting.

663
00:38:34,816 --> 00:38:37,617
So when we did announce it, one of the interesting things that, you know,

664
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,778
you have to take into account versus your own game or your own project.

665
00:38:41,282 --> 00:38:42,822
is obviously the existing fan base.

666
00:38:43,463 --> 00:38:46,264
And with this particular one, there's certainly lots of expectations.

667
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,266
As Jeff alluded to, there's people looking for hints.

668
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:49,586
They want answers.

669
00:38:50,867 --> 00:38:51,848
And so,

670
00:38:52,688 --> 00:38:55,189
one of the things, the first prompt I have up there is,

671
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:58,531
you know, what was important to communicate to fans of Reigns,

672
00:38:59,272 --> 00:39:02,393
Reigns Game of Thrones, and between the two franchises.

673
00:39:02,894 --> 00:39:06,896
And one thing that was ultra important that I guess I didn't anticipate until right before really doing it,

674
00:39:07,444 --> 00:39:12,228
is making sure that people understand you're working with a licensed game and there's some expectations.

675
00:39:12,948 --> 00:39:16,210
It's getting better, but there's expectations that this is just a skin job

676
00:39:16,471 --> 00:39:21,094
and it is putting the, you're slapping Game of Thrones maybe on Reigns.

677
00:39:21,134 --> 00:39:26,398
And we had to really avoid that. We wanted to communicate that this was, in fact, a full-fledged standalone game.

678
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:30,200
It's a sequel. However you want to put it, it's not, you know, did you enjoy Reigns?

679
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,903
What if we just slapped these characters on there? Because that's pretty common in licensed games. You see this.

680
00:39:35,575 --> 00:39:42,057
And so I don't know, you know, when it comes to my questions to you guys is how did you think about managing those communities, those expectations?

681
00:39:42,337 --> 00:39:46,339
What was it that you sought to be the most important thing from your side when you were releasing it?

682
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,861
Yeah, you know, that is it's always top of mind for us, right?

683
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:57,984
Like we we are nothing without our fans, you know, like there's no show without an amazing rabid fan base.

684
00:39:58,064 --> 00:40:00,505
So it's it's very important to us.

685
00:40:01,605 --> 00:40:02,365
We we take.

686
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:09,062
You know, very seriously, and make sure that the things that we put out there aren't going to be deemed like that, where it's just a cash grab or a logo slap.

687
00:40:09,162 --> 00:40:16,004
Have you had that happen? Have you had any, I mean, without maybe giving too specifics, have you had things that were just a huge blowback when you announced them?

688
00:40:17,384 --> 00:40:20,885
Or any kind of particular angst, sensitivities that fans have?

689
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:29,828
We've had a few things that kind of landed with kind of a little head scratch reaction, but nothing too terrible, because we take really careful care to do that.

690
00:40:31,506 --> 00:40:37,288
But no, it's definitely important, and it had to be seen as, you know, as complimentary

691
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:41,450
to the brand and additive to the brand, not, you know, not taking away from.

692
00:40:43,251 --> 00:40:47,853
There's also, you know, the other things that we think about a lot are about timing and

693
00:40:47,993 --> 00:40:53,055
all the other stuff that's going on, not just for products, you know, not my department,

694
00:40:53,115 --> 00:40:54,296
but for the show itself.

695
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:59,480
So is there going to be a teaser trailer that's dropping the day before we announce this game?

696
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,582
If so, we don't want to do it that day because everyone's going to be talking about that teaser.

697
00:41:03,602 --> 00:41:05,623
They're not going to be talking about this product.

698
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:10,025
You know, is there, do we have some other, are we talking about a, you know, our deal with Adidas that day?

699
00:41:10,065 --> 00:41:13,727
Like we need to, you know, we need to get breathing room in between all these things.

700
00:41:13,787 --> 00:41:14,828
That's an interesting point you brought up.

701
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:20,531
I remember specifically in a conversation was we were releasing the game in between seasons.

702
00:41:21,944 --> 00:41:25,746
And I kind of, of course, like your natural expectation is, why don't we just release

703
00:41:25,786 --> 00:41:26,907
this alongside a season?

704
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:27,907
How great would that be?

705
00:41:29,228 --> 00:41:34,571
But I think you made the point that everyone's trying to do that, whether it's, you know,

706
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:39,394
whiskey or shoes or whatever it is, they all want to be tied in.

707
00:41:39,474 --> 00:41:43,056
Ours is a narrative kind of thing that could really satiate a fan base in between.

708
00:41:43,176 --> 00:41:45,697
I spend a good part of my work day telling people.

709
00:41:46,093 --> 00:41:49,435
You don't want to be right next to the new season of the show,

710
00:41:49,475 --> 00:41:51,136
because all anybody's going to talk about

711
00:41:51,257 --> 00:41:54,478
is what's on TV on the show, and they're going to miss you.

712
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:57,880
It is a fire hose of Game of Thrones content right now,

713
00:41:58,661 --> 00:42:01,402
and more so in four weeks, three and a half weeks.

714
00:42:02,303 --> 00:42:03,424
And you don't want to be-

715
00:42:03,444 --> 00:42:03,744
Plug.

716
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:04,884
Yeah, plug, plug.

717
00:42:04,965 --> 00:42:05,365
Tune in.

718
00:42:06,445 --> 00:42:09,207
But it is very much a concern of ours

719
00:42:09,247 --> 00:42:10,908
is that you need to do these things in a way

720
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:12,189
where they're going to have room to breathe,

721
00:42:12,389 --> 00:42:13,209
and they can get lost.

722
00:42:14,292 --> 00:42:23,656
Also, one thing that is important is, I think, as a licensor, we got the sort of expectation,

723
00:42:24,797 --> 00:42:31,340
but when you think about it, like, five seconds, you understand it's very long, that when you

724
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:37,683
work with, like, the Game of Thrones IP, you got a bit of Game of Thrones marketing.

725
00:42:38,043 --> 00:42:39,404
But it's not that at all.

726
00:42:39,843 --> 00:42:45,146
And it's very important to understand that you still have to sell your game, and although

727
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:53,650
you use the IP and you use the universe of Game of Thrones, you won't share the marketing

728
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,751
plan of the series, okay?

729
00:42:56,171 --> 00:43:03,595
And that's super important because that's exactly the sort of thing you want to avoid

730
00:43:03,675 --> 00:43:06,036
actually, to be on the same sort of level.

731
00:43:06,736 --> 00:43:09,938
Because it won't work for your product, to be very clear.

732
00:43:10,259 --> 00:43:15,983
Yeah, that was... We talked about that at length, I think, right before the release of it.

733
00:43:16,163 --> 00:43:20,067
And this is, again, another thing that hopefully can communicate, or at least take away,

734
00:43:20,487 --> 00:43:22,829
is it's still on you to market your game.

735
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:26,772
You have the benefit of an IP, but it's definitely on you to market your game.

736
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,094
Because these brands, and in our case, Game of Thrones,

737
00:43:29,475 --> 00:43:30,636
they have their own strategies.

738
00:43:30,756 --> 00:43:33,118
And they have strategies that don't necessarily...

739
00:43:33,138 --> 00:43:35,520
You're going to accept the small indie mobile game.

740
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,783
They're not putting ads in between Game of Thrones and V for this game.

741
00:43:40,683 --> 00:43:43,925
We can expect a tweet and some social support or things like that.

742
00:43:45,106 --> 00:43:45,566
Sometimes.

743
00:43:46,306 --> 00:43:48,527
But it's really on you.

744
00:43:48,648 --> 00:43:53,570
And so it was on us on the publishing side to really work with Apple, Google and Steam

745
00:43:53,991 --> 00:43:56,412
and other partners and PR and things like that to get it out there.

746
00:43:56,752 --> 00:43:58,493
Because it's not that HBO wasn't helpful.

747
00:43:58,793 --> 00:43:59,834
It's that they have a lot of things.

748
00:44:00,574 --> 00:44:02,676
And they can offer a little bit to you.

749
00:44:03,847 --> 00:44:07,049
The input, you know, they told us and they're right, it's still on you to sell your game.

750
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:12,552
So that was a good piece of learning that I think I would definitely pass on to someone working on a licensed product.

751
00:44:12,572 --> 00:44:15,754
Don't think of it as an easy street, like you got this, you can go.

752
00:44:15,914 --> 00:44:18,896
This is where, you know, licensing is different from code dev.

753
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:25,500
You know, I mean, there's the other model where like, you know, we might take a whole bunch of money and pay someone to make us a game.

754
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:25,980
Right.

755
00:44:26,501 --> 00:44:26,781
And then.

756
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:28,224
We market it.

757
00:44:28,284 --> 00:44:29,525
We would be doing it.

758
00:44:29,585 --> 00:44:30,926
But let me know if you would like to do that.

759
00:44:31,006 --> 00:44:31,606
No, we would not.

760
00:44:32,787 --> 00:44:35,028
But that's actually not how we approach things.

761
00:44:35,108 --> 00:44:35,868
We're just not set up to.

762
00:44:35,968 --> 00:44:38,809
A lot of other studios and TV networks do that more often.

763
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:43,612
But that's one of the wrinkles of this, which is very

764
00:44:44,312 --> 00:44:46,333
valuable as a takeaway for anyone that's thinking about

765
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:46,693
doing this.

766
00:44:47,373 --> 00:44:49,354
You have to have your own marketing strategies, and you

767
00:44:49,374 --> 00:44:52,096
have to bring that in in your pitch and explain how you're

768
00:44:52,116 --> 00:44:52,556
going to do it.

769
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:53,917
How do you acquire users?

770
00:44:54,497 --> 00:44:55,157
What does that mean?

771
00:44:55,732 --> 00:44:58,334
You know, does it mean blanketing Facebook with ads for your game?

772
00:44:59,214 --> 00:45:03,558
I need to know that because I need to go to my social media team and explain to them this is going to be out there.

773
00:45:03,918 --> 00:45:05,880
These guys are going to be buying against Game of Thrones.

774
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,722
Are you trying to do the same thing in that same window?

775
00:45:09,122 --> 00:45:10,143
Should we be careful?

776
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,706
You know, it's a lot behind the scenes that you have to really think about.

777
00:45:14,006 --> 00:45:18,450
And it's in 2019, you know, that is a real concern.

778
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:22,293
That was another thing that popped up in the marketing that was interesting to me is

779
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,675
that App Store was our primary place to sell the game.

780
00:45:26,004 --> 00:45:28,246
And when you type in Game of Thrones in the App Store,

781
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:33,569
you're not going to be first if you're a small game. Like there's a lot of other bigger things out there.

782
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:35,830
So you had to, we had to work,

783
00:45:36,751 --> 00:45:42,474
you know, we make sure we talk with Apple making sure that, you know, it was all set up properly

784
00:45:43,394 --> 00:45:46,816
and things like that. But you're a competing, you're not the only licensee out there.

785
00:45:47,037 --> 00:45:50,178
And that was a an eye-opening thing too. It worked out fine for us.

786
00:45:50,198 --> 00:45:53,580
We got promotion and things like that from Apple and Google and whatnot, but

787
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:55,872
You know, when people are trying to organically find your game,

788
00:45:56,272 --> 00:45:59,454
if you're one of many, that was something that you just got to keep in mind.

789
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:02,516
In the interest of time, I just want to ask one last question

790
00:46:02,536 --> 00:46:04,458
before we open it to questions from you guys,

791
00:46:04,498 --> 00:46:05,959
if you have any, that aren't about Season 8.

792
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,043
What, in general, would you take away from this?

793
00:46:11,183 --> 00:46:14,865
What was the personal, professional highs and lows of this project?

794
00:46:14,965 --> 00:46:15,906
And that's for both of you.

795
00:46:15,986 --> 00:46:16,426
You go first.

796
00:46:18,848 --> 00:46:19,128
I think...

797
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:34,631
I think what we take from this is very much the fact that the licensed game needs to be

798
00:46:34,651 --> 00:46:38,634
connection between the license and the game.

799
00:46:44,451 --> 00:46:46,753
And you can't have this unbalance.

800
00:46:47,153 --> 00:46:52,357
I think the bad licensed games are either you've got big brands and a weak game you

801
00:46:52,378 --> 00:46:56,481
put behind that because you need to have some sort of gameplay.

802
00:46:57,662 --> 00:47:06,468
And another bad game is when you've got the license is just like a layer on top of a very

803
00:47:06,508 --> 00:47:07,449
good game mechanic.

804
00:47:08,563 --> 00:47:09,283
That's just it.

805
00:47:09,483 --> 00:47:12,024
It's like you're risking your game.

806
00:47:12,384 --> 00:47:14,624
So this is very important, I think.

807
00:47:15,244 --> 00:47:18,405
And that's the main takeaway for me as a designer,

808
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:23,426
is that makes sense when you use the license to make

809
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:28,768
the game better, and you use the game to enrich the license

810
00:47:28,828 --> 00:47:32,949
in a way, or explore what I say about explore the universe

811
00:47:33,009 --> 00:47:33,889
of Game of Thrones.

812
00:47:34,478 --> 00:47:37,019
And when you got that connection, that makes it work,

813
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:40,219
that makes it worthwhile, and you bring something

814
00:47:40,279 --> 00:47:41,280
to the table, I would say.

815
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,461
And I think we start to see that,

816
00:47:44,541 --> 00:47:48,482
and I'm very, very excited to see Indies starting to do that.

817
00:47:48,562 --> 00:47:51,983
And I think that's also an interesting thing that's

818
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:55,924
happening that's, in a way, starting with us, I suppose.

819
00:47:56,704 --> 00:48:00,245
That Indies, like working with big IPs,

820
00:48:01,889 --> 00:48:04,112
is something very, very strong.

821
00:48:04,332 --> 00:48:06,234
If it makes sense, if the game play makes sense,

822
00:48:06,535 --> 00:48:07,556
it's super strong.

823
00:48:07,596 --> 00:48:09,679
Like, so you were talking about cannons.

824
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:11,561
Cannons of Hyrule.

825
00:48:11,601 --> 00:48:12,543
Cannons of Hyrule.

826
00:48:12,863 --> 00:48:16,728
That's a huge thing, and I think it makes so much sense

827
00:48:16,808 --> 00:48:17,048
because...

828
00:48:17,714 --> 00:48:22,718
You always add in the Zelda game, the Zelda IP,

829
00:48:22,738 --> 00:48:28,802
you always add this sort of very strong connection

830
00:48:29,362 --> 00:48:31,564
to dance and music.

831
00:48:32,044 --> 00:48:34,926
So you got a lot of things around that

832
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:36,867
in the Zelda franchise.

833
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:41,030
And the crypt of the Necrodancer gameplay

834
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:41,850
is so perfect.

835
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:43,071
It makes a lot of sense.

836
00:48:45,318 --> 00:48:50,281
Both thematically and mechanically as a game design perspective.

837
00:48:51,522 --> 00:48:54,543
Jeff, what did you get out of this? What did you get out of your relationship with us?

838
00:48:55,284 --> 00:48:57,265
Except, I mean, other than meeting you guys.

839
00:48:57,305 --> 00:49:01,007
Well, that's obviously a high point, but besides that.

840
00:49:01,047 --> 00:49:04,889
You know, we get a lot of shine off of this, you know?

841
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:11,033
Like, when you talk about, again, that dynamic of it's not going to earn us, you know, the most.

842
00:49:11,931 --> 00:49:13,853
But we've gotten accolades.

843
00:49:14,073 --> 00:49:15,675
We got amazing reception.

844
00:49:15,755 --> 00:49:17,817
People reviewed this game and loved it.

845
00:49:17,937 --> 00:49:20,639
I mean, the general reaction to the announcement was,

846
00:49:20,779 --> 00:49:21,620
oh, hell yeah.

847
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,182
Like, that's exactly the reigns of Game of Thrones.

848
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,723
It's perfect.

849
00:49:25,524 --> 00:49:30,789
And I mean, talk about a sense of fulfillment from that.

850
00:49:30,829 --> 00:49:32,971
That's exactly what we all were excited about.

851
00:49:34,412 --> 00:49:35,934
The collaboration, the collaborative efforts

852
00:49:35,954 --> 00:49:37,795
that we've talked a lot about were very fulfilling.

853
00:49:38,577 --> 00:49:41,879
And to me, it's a testament to the two teams.

854
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:46,581
And the big win on this is like it is not Halo.

855
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:49,542
And it feels like an additive experience for our fans

856
00:49:49,562 --> 00:49:52,203
where we created something that we're

857
00:49:52,263 --> 00:49:57,005
giving this new little world inside our world to play with.

858
00:49:57,525 --> 00:49:59,766
And that's really, really gratifying just professionally

859
00:49:59,826 --> 00:50:00,727
and personally, too.

860
00:50:01,187 --> 00:50:01,407
Great.

861
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:03,668
Well, thank you guys for answering

862
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:04,809
the questions and chatting.

863
00:50:04,909 --> 00:50:05,489
I'd love to.

864
00:50:05,529 --> 00:50:06,970
And that's it for the.

865
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:10,871
The presentation itself, if you guys have any questions,

866
00:50:10,891 --> 00:50:12,131
we're happy to answer them.

867
00:50:12,391 --> 00:50:14,572
First, who wants to know the end of Game of Thrones?

868
00:50:15,572 --> 00:50:17,632
All right, don't call on any of them.

869
00:50:18,592 --> 00:50:19,012
Sorry, dude.

870
00:50:20,773 --> 00:50:24,854
I think there's a, if you need to talk over the microphone.

871
00:50:27,894 --> 00:50:28,514
Thank you so much.

872
00:50:28,554 --> 00:50:30,995
It was very interesting to hear the insights

873
00:50:31,315 --> 00:50:33,235
of this experience.

874
00:50:33,515 --> 00:50:35,456
I missed the first maybe two minutes,

875
00:50:35,896 --> 00:50:36,916
and I didn't hear a.

876
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,561
This was the first game you did with IP,

877
00:50:42,761 --> 00:50:47,722
or you had any previous experience on doing IP games?

878
00:50:47,842 --> 00:50:48,502
I don't think you have.

879
00:50:48,542 --> 00:50:49,683
No, I didn't.

880
00:50:50,483 --> 00:50:50,523
OK.

881
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:53,223
I've worked on, we did something for a game called

882
00:50:53,263 --> 00:50:55,444
Broforce and a movie called The Expendables called

883
00:50:55,464 --> 00:50:56,264
The Expendabros.

884
00:50:56,924 --> 00:50:58,545
But that was a free promotional thing,

885
00:50:58,565 --> 00:50:59,885
and it was a much smaller project.

886
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:01,185
OK, I played that one.

887
00:51:01,544 --> 00:51:02,004
No, OK, good.

888
00:51:02,264 --> 00:51:03,525
Yeah, it was very good.

889
00:51:03,565 --> 00:51:04,446
It was free, so why not?

890
00:51:04,586 --> 00:51:06,227
Yeah.

891
00:51:06,347 --> 00:51:11,011
So my question is, when you had to deal with the IP owner,

892
00:51:11,772 --> 00:51:14,994
and you have to set the terms of the contract,

893
00:51:15,755 --> 00:51:20,038
and there's not much information around what are good terms,

894
00:51:20,399 --> 00:51:25,203
like what is a reasonable MG or marketing stipend?

895
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:30,877
Or I don't know, how much the license is worth for the revenue share.

896
00:51:31,277 --> 00:51:32,437
I can't tell you that to be honest.

897
00:51:32,457 --> 00:51:34,437
I mean, Jeff could, I don't know even how much he could speak to it.

898
00:51:34,618 --> 00:51:37,158
That's a really good question because I didn't know that either going in.

899
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:38,298
We had no idea.

900
00:51:38,638 --> 00:51:41,659
But I think in my, at least my limited experience and from what I've heard from others,

901
00:51:41,779 --> 00:51:43,139
it just, it depends on the IP.

902
00:51:43,819 --> 00:51:44,739
And the licensor too.

903
00:51:44,759 --> 00:51:45,519
And the licensor.

904
00:51:45,579 --> 00:51:47,500
Some people I think are pretty aggressive out there.

905
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:47,980
Yeah.

906
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,400
So, I mean, we're pretty flexible in my shop.

907
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,061
Like, we're open to discussing all that stuff.

908
00:51:55,069 --> 00:51:58,590
So it's hard to say, you know, like, come with a million bucks or you're not going to get in the door.

909
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:00,191
Like, that might be the case some places.

910
00:52:01,732 --> 00:52:06,254
Royalty rates are often more important in a, in a, for a smaller project like this, you know, like,

911
00:52:06,775 --> 00:52:11,657
if you can't offer a huge amount guaranteed, like, maybe you can share more on the royalty side,

912
00:52:11,697 --> 00:52:15,139
which can help, you know, make that case that, well, if, look, if it does really well,

913
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:17,500
then our cut is, is better, you know.

914
00:52:18,282 --> 00:52:28,588
Yeah, okay. Thank you. Because it's very difficult to understand because probably all of the licensed games have NDA, so nobody can share the information.

915
00:52:28,608 --> 00:52:38,115
But I really look hard for information about it. There's nowhere to be found anyone who tells, hey, this is regular, this is okay.

916
00:52:38,175 --> 00:52:43,938
I'm not sure this is regular. I think that's probably what I've learned from it. It just depends on sometimes there's an overinflation of value.

917
00:52:45,568 --> 00:52:49,369
You have no idea. I wish I could answer. I just know our deal, which I obviously can't talk about.

918
00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:53,790
But I think, you know, the best way to do it is just to ask. If you have a target, go ask them.

919
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:57,051
They'll probably be willing to say, this is what I'm going to need.

920
00:52:57,071 --> 00:52:58,751
Okay. Thank you. Yeah, thank you.

921
00:52:59,331 --> 00:53:00,491
Want to go over to that side? Yeah, sure.

922
00:53:00,792 --> 00:53:13,054
Hi. Awesome talk. And I just want to ask, do you have any advice for someone who wants to get close to a company to make a licensing game?

923
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,922
I'll tell you, Jeff alluded to this earlier.

924
00:53:17,863 --> 00:53:20,706
When we started this, I had no contact at HBO.

925
00:53:20,726 --> 00:53:22,287
I had no idea how to get a hold of HBO.

926
00:53:22,307 --> 00:53:26,351
I went to my HBO Go and screamed at it and did nothing, right?

927
00:53:26,731 --> 00:53:30,835
I basically looked and I thought about who they might be doing business with

928
00:53:31,376 --> 00:53:34,278
and then worked down the ladder onto someone I might know.

929
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:38,149
So it was a three or four person chain before we get to the idea of,

930
00:53:38,429 --> 00:53:41,051
okay, this is someone that may know somebody at HBO.

931
00:53:41,411 --> 00:53:45,114
So if you have a target you're going for, I'd suggest looking who they may be working with currently,

932
00:53:45,594 --> 00:53:47,216
and then kind of working through those avenues.

933
00:53:47,236 --> 00:53:50,958
Because that's basically how I got it. I have no other avenue to get to talk to anyone at HBO.

934
00:53:51,158 --> 00:53:55,642
There is an organization called Lima, which stands for licensing industry,

935
00:53:56,142 --> 00:53:59,424
some merchandising of America. I don't know what Lima stands for.

936
00:54:00,645 --> 00:54:04,347
So that's the licensing trade organization that most of us belong to.

937
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:09,310
You can probably, I mean, it doesn't hurt to call them.

938
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:15,213
They've got a website and just say, who do I contact at HBO or Sony or Warner Brothers or whatever.

939
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:16,634
Like they might be able to help you out that way.

940
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:19,575
And Google, you know, like Google it up.

941
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,717
We get a lot of cold calls that people just kind of find our details out there online.

942
00:54:23,758 --> 00:54:25,879
And just one quick question.

943
00:54:26,139 --> 00:54:28,040
Who do you want to get the Iron Throne?

944
00:54:30,548 --> 00:54:34,851
Ah, that's a hard one. I've actually said this publicly before, so it won't come back to haunt me.

945
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:40,135
But my favorite character is Tormund, Giant's Bane. So, yeah, I want to see Tormund on a throne. That would be dope.

946
00:54:41,596 --> 00:54:43,477
All right. Thank you very much.

947
00:54:43,737 --> 00:54:52,804
How's it going? Hi, my name is Ashley and I lead marketing for Activision and Blizzard Consumer Products.

948
00:54:52,884 --> 00:54:53,364
Never heard of them.

949
00:54:53,943 --> 00:54:55,685
I know, a little tiny company.

950
00:54:55,845 --> 00:54:59,109
I think we spend a lot of our days in the same way,

951
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:00,771
talking to partners about marketing.

952
00:55:00,951 --> 00:55:01,732
So thank you for that.

953
00:55:02,698 --> 00:55:08,983
I question, either for you specifically, Jeff, or for you guys, how you navigate confidentiality.

954
00:55:09,263 --> 00:55:15,369
So wanting to make sure that you are servicing the fans and giving them what they want in

955
00:55:15,449 --> 00:55:18,832
regards to programs that might be day and date, etc.

956
00:55:18,872 --> 00:55:23,436
But obviously dealing with extremely sensitive materials and timelines.

957
00:55:24,917 --> 00:55:28,900
Any interesting anecdotes, if you guys could or wanted to share?

958
00:55:31,655 --> 00:55:36,099
To answer the first question, we're very serious about it.

959
00:55:36,379 --> 00:55:40,883
Like, we don't often like to do NDAs ahead of having a deal

960
00:55:40,923 --> 00:55:42,465
because it's just extra paperwork to do.

961
00:55:42,765 --> 00:55:44,366
So we don't share anything.

962
00:55:44,546 --> 00:55:47,229
And then our license agreements have full confidentiality

963
00:55:47,249 --> 00:55:50,692
clauses with complete ironclad requirements.

964
00:55:51,792 --> 00:55:53,974
That said, we actually don't let anything,

965
00:55:54,034 --> 00:55:55,115
we didn't tell them anything.

966
00:55:55,716 --> 00:55:58,058
Like, when we had things where we were like,

967
00:55:58,178 --> 00:55:59,339
oh, you can't have that in the game.

968
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,200
Because it's.

969
00:56:00,644 --> 00:56:01,865
potentially going to be, you know.

970
00:56:02,586 --> 00:56:05,210
We found ways to communicate that to them without saying,

971
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,553
take that out, it's going to be in the final season.

972
00:56:07,813 --> 00:56:10,837
We're pretty careful.

973
00:56:11,498 --> 00:56:11,718
Yeah.

974
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:17,846
So if I can add to this, we had some sort of a

975
00:56:19,057 --> 00:56:23,819
a way to circumvent, even getting closer to doing spoilers and stuff,

976
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:28,681
or potential spoilers, because we can also accidentally find them, you know.

977
00:56:28,961 --> 00:56:33,102
So basically what we did for Game of Thrones, for Reign of Game of Thrones,

978
00:56:33,202 --> 00:56:36,643
is to just do all the possible spoilers.

979
00:56:37,313 --> 00:56:40,856
So it's like everything that can happen in the series

980
00:56:41,076 --> 00:56:42,957
will happen in the series.

981
00:56:43,098 --> 00:56:43,418
Sada.

982
00:56:44,198 --> 00:56:44,599
No, no.

983
00:56:44,879 --> 00:56:49,343
So it's like, it's really, but it's maybe,

984
00:56:49,623 --> 00:56:51,925
but that's also related to the fact

985
00:56:51,965 --> 00:56:54,427
that we make a narrative game, so we have to tell stories,

986
00:56:54,467 --> 00:56:54,747
you know?

987
00:56:54,907 --> 00:56:58,450
We can't just mess around.

988
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:01,752
But the fact is that because of frames

989
00:57:01,812 --> 00:57:03,794
and because of the lack of the light.

990
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:08,484
the probabilistic system we got behind that just creates stories with whatever happens

991
00:57:08,524 --> 00:57:13,569
to the player and you can have ranks that you can have millions of possible ranks if

992
00:57:13,609 --> 00:57:13,910
you want.

993
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:21,938
So that just creates like a potential things that can happen with the Game of Thrones.

994
00:57:23,388 --> 00:57:25,750
I talk about like fine fiction simulator.

995
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:32,314
It's like we just embrace the possible scope and we never tell you.

996
00:57:32,675 --> 00:57:33,275
We can't.

997
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:34,256
And of course, we don't.

998
00:57:34,276 --> 00:57:35,036
You guys don't even know.

999
00:57:35,056 --> 00:57:35,677
We don't even know.

1000
00:57:35,757 --> 00:57:38,919
So we can't tell you this is the right answer if you want.

1001
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:40,741
But maybe we have it.

1002
00:57:41,121 --> 00:57:44,203
In a couple of months, he's going to see some things on TV that he's been like, oh yeah,

1003
00:57:44,243 --> 00:57:44,843
that's right.

1004
00:57:44,863 --> 00:57:45,284
Son of a bitch.

1005
00:57:45,304 --> 00:57:45,704
Thank you guys.

1006
00:57:45,724 --> 00:57:45,944
Thank you.

1007
00:57:45,964 --> 00:57:46,745
Thank you.

1008
00:57:47,205 --> 00:57:47,626
Thank you.

1009
00:57:47,646 --> 00:57:47,866
Thank you.

1010
00:57:47,886 --> 00:57:48,126
Thank you.

1011
00:57:48,424 --> 00:57:52,327
We only have a couple minutes left, so just quickly, we'll get both of them, but just if we could be quickly.

1012
00:57:52,367 --> 00:57:56,349
Yeah, I'm curious. So I'm sure you guys at HBO get a ton of pitches

1013
00:57:56,509 --> 00:58:00,092
from different mobile game companies. Would you say that getting the email from

1014
00:58:00,712 --> 00:58:03,934
Dan and David is the thing that set the project

1015
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:07,797
above the others, or was it going to happen regardless, do you think?

1016
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:12,500
It certainly helped, and again, it was one of those that made us look good. But we really

1017
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:16,042
liked Reigns, and were interested in it anyway, and probably would have

1018
00:58:16,603 --> 00:58:16,783
you know.

1019
00:58:17,234 --> 00:58:20,256
So we're just pending the conversation with these guys to make sure there's actually something there.

1020
00:58:20,316 --> 00:58:22,537
We probably would have pitched this up, you know, to them.

1021
00:58:23,337 --> 00:58:25,458
But, you know, so it doesn't require that, right?

1022
00:58:25,538 --> 00:58:27,559
And it's very rare that that would be the case.

1023
00:58:27,619 --> 00:58:31,801
It's much more likely that, you know, your producers, your showrunners aren't sending...

1024
00:58:31,821 --> 00:58:35,243
So you think it would have happened regardless of that?

1025
00:58:35,343 --> 00:58:36,103
I think so, yeah.

1026
00:58:36,504 --> 00:58:39,465
And Dan and Dave are really unique in that they are really,

1027
00:58:39,845 --> 00:58:41,586
they love the licensed product and the merch,

1028
00:58:41,626 --> 00:58:43,747
and they're really engaged with us in that,

1029
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,788
and often say, like, what about this, what about that?

1030
00:58:48,619 --> 00:59:00,304
Hey, I got a quick question. I don't know if you can disclose that, but is there a reason why Game of Thrones franchise hasn't been breaking like the triple A game stuff?

1031
00:59:00,444 --> 00:59:09,647
Like I've seen, we see Spiderman, Star Wars games, all these big brands, and Game of Thrones is kind of like the biggest PC game I guess is like the Telltale series.

1032
00:59:11,728 --> 00:59:16,810
So we haven't really found the right opportunity to do that, and we've looked at things and we will continue to look at things.

1033
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:20,303
It's a, I'll tell you what, from a licensor standpoint,

1034
00:59:20,783 --> 00:59:24,526
knowing what it takes to build a AAA console game,

1035
00:59:24,586 --> 00:59:26,488
$100 million and then a couple more million.

1036
00:59:26,608 --> 00:59:27,529
Don't look at me, I don't know.

1037
00:59:27,549 --> 00:59:29,871
I mean, a couple more hundred million to market the game,

1038
00:59:29,891 --> 00:59:32,613
you know, like that's a massive, massive investment

1039
00:59:32,993 --> 00:59:35,735
from the studio and the publisher and all of that.

1040
00:59:36,536 --> 00:59:41,300
And it has to be right and it has to be fantastic and good.

1041
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,201
If you look at the track record,

1042
00:59:43,462 --> 00:59:45,643
we talked about this a little bit in the beginning about...

1043
00:59:46,032 --> 00:59:47,132
The history of licensed gaming.

1044
00:59:48,013 --> 00:59:52,974
There's a lot of roadkill out there over the years with licensed console games.

1045
00:59:53,414 --> 00:59:57,895
And we began looking, when we first started looking at,

1046
00:59:58,835 --> 00:59:59,975
we called them video games.

1047
01:00:00,416 --> 01:00:01,496
This was like 12 years ago.

1048
01:00:01,776 --> 01:00:02,776
We should do a video game.

1049
01:00:03,236 --> 01:00:04,236
No one calls them that anymore.

1050
01:00:04,937 --> 01:00:05,517
I do.

1051
01:00:06,977 --> 01:00:09,518
But we started looking at that.

1052
01:00:09,758 --> 01:00:11,978
And we did some research and we looked at case studies.

1053
01:00:12,018 --> 01:00:15,679
And the Spider-Man game from this year has been...

1054
01:00:16,382 --> 01:00:24,104
revelatory in that sense. But, you know, I always look at Avatar, and if there's anyone here from, I think, Sony, you know, no offense.

1055
01:00:25,024 --> 01:00:31,085
But Avatar was the biggest movie in the world. It set all the box records. It blew the doors off of everything.

1056
01:00:31,445 --> 01:00:36,547
They put out a console game, and it was a complete dud. And that's our nightmare.

1057
01:00:37,207 --> 01:00:43,368
Yeah, right. But there is, well, if you look at the modifications for some of the games, there are some pretty good ones.

1058
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,134
Great, Game of Thrones mods.

1059
01:00:45,214 --> 01:00:46,735
So there's obviously some marketing.

1060
01:00:46,755 --> 01:00:47,696
Unlicensed mods.

1061
01:00:47,796 --> 01:00:50,398
And Game of Thrones is a licensed mod.

1062
01:00:50,418 --> 01:00:53,119
Game of Thrones has like this certain adhesive

1063
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:55,101
with some of the games because, you know,

1064
01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:57,662
the way the franchise works.

1065
01:00:57,702 --> 01:00:57,902
Yeah.

1066
01:00:58,563 --> 01:01:00,444
Yeah, no, it's something we are looking at.

1067
01:01:00,464 --> 01:01:02,966
We've heard pitches, and for the right opportunity,

1068
01:01:02,986 --> 01:01:03,826
I think we totally would.

1069
01:01:03,846 --> 01:01:05,347
You know, it's also the other part,

1070
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:08,149
it's a four year dev cycle too, right?

1071
01:01:08,209 --> 01:01:10,550
So it's a commitment.

1072
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,452
It's a bear to take on something like that.

1073
01:01:12,572 --> 01:01:13,032
I imagine.

1074
01:01:13,172 --> 01:01:13,332
Yeah.

1075
01:01:14,394 --> 01:01:15,316
Well, thank you all very much.

1076
01:01:15,336 --> 01:01:18,260
Thank you for the question, and thank you all very much for coming out.

1077
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:18,621
Appreciate it.

1078
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:18,821
Thank you.

1079
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:19,021
Thank you.
