1
00:00:06,258 --> 00:00:11,280
Right now, I will now turn you over to Heather Albano and harvesting interactive fiction.

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:19,543
Thank you very much.

3
00:00:19,543 --> 00:00:20,944
I think that's working.

4
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:21,604
You can all hear me?

5
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:21,864
Yeah?

6
00:00:21,864 --> 00:00:23,044
All right.

7
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:29,247
I have been reminded to ask you to please turn off your cell phones or put them on silent

8
00:00:29,247 --> 00:00:31,448
and to please remember to fill out your course evaluations.

9
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,528
All right.

10
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:33,988
Let's go.

11
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:41,408
This is the game Time Magazine named as its game of the year,

12
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,709
80 Days, released by Inkle.

13
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,289
This is the game that won the Apple Design Award of 2014,

14
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:44,890
Device 6, released by Simogo.

15
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,411
And this is the game that spent months

16
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:50,392
in its top RPG in the iTunes Store,

17
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:52,213
with a brief stint as top overall app,

18
00:00:52,213 --> 00:00:53,413
A Darkroom by Amirali Rajan.

19
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,152
These games are all by anyone's definition interactive fiction,

20
00:01:12,152 --> 00:01:16,354
which means that interactive fiction, long perceived

21
00:01:16,354 --> 00:01:21,217
as a hobbyist niche, is starting to generate interest,

22
00:01:21,217 --> 00:01:26,439
enthusiasm, awards, and dollars in the mainstream gaming

23
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:26,759
market.

24
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,541
Video games have a lot more tools at their disposal

25
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,322
to evoke player emotion.

26
00:01:33,447 --> 00:01:38,810
camera angle, speed of play, the expressions on the faces of the NPCs, the tones of their

27
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:46,234
voices. When a game form without any of these elements at its disposal starts generating

28
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:52,298
genuine emotion on the part of its players, it's worthwhile to investigate why. When you

29
00:01:52,298 --> 00:02:01,002
see these games sitting at Top RPG or Winning Times award, it is even more worthwhile to

30
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:01,843
investigate why.

31
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:06,273
We should discover what games like this have to teach us

32
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:09,396
about storytelling and how we can harvest those techniques

33
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,618
when designing narrative for other kinds of games.

34
00:02:11,618 --> 00:02:14,200
And we're gonna do that today.

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,082
First though, we should take a step back

36
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:17,123
and define some terms.

37
00:02:17,123 --> 00:02:19,084
To begin with, who am I?

38
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:24,444
I am a freelance narrative designer and game writer.

39
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,665
I do most of my work for Choice of Games.

40
00:02:26,665 --> 00:02:34,847
I also was lead writer on Mission 1 of Codename Cygnus, and I've done some work on pen and

41
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:35,467
paper RPGs.

42
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:39,309
So that's me.

43
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:41,629
Now what do I mean when I say interactive fiction?

44
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,330
It's a pretty broad canvas.

45
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,972
If you take it to mean fiction that is interactive...

46
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:56,093
It can be applied to the choose your path type made famous by Choose Your Own Adventure,

47
00:02:56,093 --> 00:03:03,299
to the parser-based type made famous by Infocom, to modern games built using Inform, Choice

48
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:09,724
Script, and Twine, to the audio-based code named Cygnus, to Inkle and Inkle Writer games,

49
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:14,888
to interactive visual novels, and there is a meaningful argument that any narrative-driven

50
00:03:14,888 --> 00:03:18,531
game on any platform whatsoever is interactive fiction.

51
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:22,675
Generally, when people use the term IF, though,

52
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:26,619
they're talking about something pretty specific.

53
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:30,502
They're talking about either parser-based or choose-your-path.

54
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,083
So we will focus on those.

55
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,525
Quick history of parser-based.

56
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:38,648
In 1979, Dave Liebling, Mark Blank, Albert Veza,

57
00:03:38,648 --> 00:03:41,691
and Joel Burez founded Infocom, which

58
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:44,833
produced Zork-style games, or adventure games,

59
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:48,136
or parser games, until the company's death in 1989.

60
00:03:49,087 --> 00:03:51,748
These were games without graphics, which were pretty

61
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:53,909
limited in 1980 anyway.

62
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:55,850
Even if you haven't played one, I'm sure you know the format.

63
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,450
There's a chunk of text.

64
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,751
There is a cursor.

65
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:01,573
The player types in where they wish to go next or explore next

66
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:05,255
or what they want to do next in a noun and verb combination.

67
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:07,296
And the game responds, telling them what they see

68
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,117
or what happens in consequence of their action.

69
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:12,959
Infocom games were known for their storytelling.

70
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,441
They were, in fact, distributed via bookstores as well

71
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:16,841
as store selling software.

72
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:25,902
The company was acquired in 1986 and Activision, the acquirer, shut down the Infocom division in 1989.

73
00:04:25,902 --> 00:04:28,804
But the game form didn't die.

74
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:34,747
The fans of the parser-based game reverse-engineered Infocom's technology

75
00:04:34,747 --> 00:04:38,129
and created programming languages for developing parser IF,

76
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:41,271
the predominant example of which is Graham Nelson's Inform.

77
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:49,279
From 1995 onward, the parser IF community has been focused around competitions, especially

78
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,641
the annual IF comp, in which authors submit free games and vote for the best.

79
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:58,785
These competitions have resulted in considerable artistic innovation as people stretch the

80
00:04:58,785 --> 00:05:00,666
boundaries of the art form.

81
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,808
The history of Choose Your Path is similar.

82
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:10,873
Game books, which were also sold in bookstores, were published first by Vermont Crossroads

83
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:11,913
Press then by Bantam.

84
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:13,993
If you were a kid in the 1980s and 90s,

85
00:05:13,993 --> 00:05:17,296
you probably read slash played at least one.

86
00:05:17,296 --> 00:05:19,738
And even if you didn't, you probably know the tropes.

87
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:21,180
There's a chunk of text, and then there

88
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,363
are multiple choice series of things you can do.

89
00:05:24,363 --> 00:05:26,846
If you hit the troll, turn to page 17.

90
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:28,808
If you run away, turn to page 30.

91
00:05:28,808 --> 00:05:30,870
If you try to negotiate, turn to page 45.

92
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:35,847
The problem with these early game books

93
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:39,689
was the explosive, exponential nature of branching narrative.

94
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:42,291
When you have this many branches,

95
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,493
you can't make every branch a long, in-depth story.

96
00:05:45,493 --> 00:05:48,515
Not realistically, not practically.

97
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,116
And so these early game books were

98
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,918
restricted to telling short, simple stories,

99
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:54,599
mostly suitable for kids.

100
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:57,060
So the first Choose Your Path games, the game books.

101
00:05:57,795 --> 00:06:01,458
were pitched to kids and young adults

102
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:05,201
and tended to explore safe, comfortable science

103
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:06,362
fiction and fantasy genres.

104
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:07,583
Fighting fantasy partway solved this problem

105
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:13,868
by representing the choices the player made

106
00:06:13,868 --> 00:06:19,192
with a stored variable and the consequences of those choices

107
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:22,434
by calling that variable in lieu of strict branching.

108
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,142
The only problem was they did this through pencil, paper, dice, and the expectation that

109
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:33,263
the player's brain was going to function as the game computer, which works, but which

110
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:35,804
restricts their audience to people who are willing to do that kind of work.

111
00:06:35,804 --> 00:06:42,806
The years between 2009 and 2012 saw a proliferation of free tools for writing branching narrative

112
00:06:42,806 --> 00:06:47,248
games, including but not limited to ChoiceScript, Twine, and InkleWriter.

113
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:52,326
These tools were all designed to store and call variables within the game

114
00:06:52,326 --> 00:06:57,470
instead of making the player do it with a pencil, thus completing fighting fantasy's solution.

115
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,472
The same years saw two different revolutions.

116
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:03,615
The first one was artistic, incited by twine.

117
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:12,562
People making twine games, most of which were small games given away for free,

118
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:17,365
made them on a hugely diverse range of topics and storylines and perspectives.

119
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:21,427
These were games made by people who were not previously making games.

120
00:07:21,427 --> 00:07:24,008
Voices we hadn't heard before.

121
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:26,589
Games about things nobody writes games about.

122
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:29,990
An artistic expansion that deserves a presentation all by itself.

123
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,012
The second revolution happened in the commercial indie space.

124
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:39,494
Thanks to mobile app stores, Steam, Kickstarter, and Patreon,

125
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:45,216
it became feasible for small studios to make cost-effective text-based projects

126
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:46,277
that actually pay the rent.

127
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:53,779
Those studios include Choice of Games, Fail Better Games, Inkle, and Tin Man Games.

128
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:58,900
Most of them have developed their own tools for developing text-based games, most of which

129
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,621
are free for anyone to use.

130
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:04,602
The most popular among commercial authors seem to be Choice Script and Inkle Writer.

131
00:08:04,602 --> 00:08:12,264
So examples of modern IF tend to be more or less like one grandparent or the other.

132
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:13,964
A spectrum.

133
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:16,566
I cut out for a second, I'm back.

134
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:20,608
From a purely parser-based, all the way to the far right, to the branching narrative

135
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:24,570
on the far left, to a variety of works in the fuzzy gray middle area.

136
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,272
What they have in common is that all of them are based on words.

137
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:30,853
They're all driven by narrative.

138
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:31,894
That's it.

139
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:32,754
That's all they've got.

140
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:34,675
Look at the reaction they're getting.

141
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:35,716
We're at the narrative summit.

142
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:43,936
Everybody in this room is in this room because they already

143
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:45,796
believe game narrative is important.

144
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:47,957
I don't have to cite statistics to convince you.

145
00:08:47,957 --> 00:08:51,257
But the fact that there are statistics to cite

146
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:52,278
is really interesting.

147
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:56,138
It implies that the mainstream gaming market, or at least

148
00:08:56,138 --> 00:08:58,719
some of it, is also coming around to the idea

149
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:02,600
that game narrative is really, really important.

150
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,920
We have objective evidence that might convince other people.

151
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,965
of the first time we can cite a business need,

152
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,286
not just an artistic need, for great narrative

153
00:09:11,286 --> 00:09:14,666
and great storytelling and great prose in games.

154
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:18,927
So then, what can modern IF teach us

155
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:20,728
about game storytelling?

156
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:23,388
As I just described, modern IF is an enormous canvas,

157
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:26,269
very diverse, there are a lot of things I could talk about.

158
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:28,389
I only have 25 minutes, so I've picked three

159
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:31,490
of the most interesting techniques to cover today.

160
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:31,630
Poetry?

161
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,891
ambiguity and complicity.

162
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:44,514
By poetry, I mean the quality of the prose separate

163
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:46,155
from the quality of the narrative.

164
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:50,517
Poetry in this context has been defined by Choice

165
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:52,478
of Games co-founder Dan Fabulich

166
00:09:52,478 --> 00:09:56,140
as short beautiful prose that hits hard.

167
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,143
When words are all you have to communicate world, character,

168
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:01,443
story.

169
00:10:02,283 --> 00:10:05,605
you spend a lot of time making the words powerful.

170
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,065
Everyone has to count.

171
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:11,787
Here's an example taken from With Those We Love Alive

172
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:12,407
by Porpentine.

173
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:17,689
This is one of the first screens you see in the game.

174
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:18,969
All the pink words are links.

175
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:23,771
If you click on city, this is the only description

176
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:26,031
of the city you get.

177
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:26,351
32 words.

178
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:31,392
And it's 32 words that tell you a hell of a lot, or rather,

179
00:10:31,392 --> 00:10:34,594
that poetically imply a whole lot.

180
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:36,236
Ropes are strung between the buildings.

181
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,617
I wonder why.

182
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:38,918
There's a temple.

183
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:41,100
OK, I wonder to who or to what?

184
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,822
Why is the canal dry?

185
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:45,624
What is a dream distillery?

186
00:10:45,624 --> 00:10:47,646
That's 32 words doing an awful lot of work.

187
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:51,598
They do world building, they imply some backstory,

188
00:10:51,598 --> 00:10:53,820
they open mysteries to investigate,

189
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,422
and they are enormously effective in communicating

190
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,144
the atmosphere of the game.

191
00:10:58,144 --> 00:11:00,866
And one of the ways they do this is

192
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:04,309
by implying rather than delivering

193
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:05,410
utilitarian exposition.

194
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,033
These are short sentences with carefully chosen words

195
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:12,095
that suggest things to the player who then needs

196
00:11:12,095 --> 00:11:14,777
to engage with the game, engage with the words,

197
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:16,579
engage with the world.

198
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:19,220
to fill in the blanks for themselves.

199
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,301
It's actually interesting I was making this point,

200
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:25,062
because the two speakers before me made the same point

201
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:29,884
about encouraging the player to fill in blanks for themselves

202
00:11:29,884 --> 00:11:32,665
so that they're brought into the experience they're having.

203
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:35,566
Part of the strength of this text comes from its ambiguity,

204
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:37,547
which moves me on to my next topic.

205
00:11:39,217 --> 00:11:42,442
To some degree, ambiguity in IF is unavoidable.

206
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:43,784
It's a byproduct of the medium.

207
00:11:43,784 --> 00:11:47,270
Without graphics and without, obviously,

208
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,353
an infinite amount of space for text.

209
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:52,216
You cannot possibly cover every detail.

210
00:11:52,216 --> 00:11:55,477
The player's imagination has to fill in some of the details.

211
00:11:55,477 --> 00:11:57,757
There's obviously a degree to which this

212
00:11:57,757 --> 00:12:00,738
is true for any game medium.

213
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:04,099
Daniel Greenberg, I think, phrased it best last year.

214
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,460
He said at GDC last year, the game world

215
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,920
does not exist on the screen.

216
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,401
The game world exists between the ears of the player.

217
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:15,502
This is more true for something text-based than something

218
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,542
not text-based, simply because there's only the one tool.

219
00:12:18,502 --> 00:12:20,043
And this is a feature, not a bug.

220
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:23,004
It can be used deliberately.

221
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:25,306
You're going to have to omit some of the details,

222
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:26,647
so you pick which ones.

223
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:29,529
Decide where you want the player's imagination actively

224
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:30,289
filling in gaps.

225
00:12:32,924 --> 00:12:36,627
I just showed how With Those We Love Alive does this.

226
00:12:36,627 --> 00:12:39,810
A Darkroom, with its sparse description, does this.

227
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,112
Device 6 does this to great effect.

228
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:45,494
The review I quoted on the second slide up there

229
00:12:45,494 --> 00:12:46,755
praises it for this very technique.

230
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:50,518
It calls the game one of those elusive stories you never quite

231
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:51,759
feel you've got a grip of.

232
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,322
The protagonist spends the entire game

233
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:55,983
trying to fathom what's going on around her,

234
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,565
and never quite does so.

235
00:12:58,565 --> 00:13:01,187
And the experience all the more engrossing because of it.

236
00:13:02,397 --> 00:13:05,899
Some questions are best left unanswered.

237
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:08,280
And the first choice of game, Choice of the Dragon,

238
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,362
did this by the way in which it asked the player

239
00:13:11,362 --> 00:13:13,863
to specify their dragon's gender.

240
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:16,625
Not just you get to choose between a binary,

241
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,966
but you get to choose almost anything,

242
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,747
including a refusal to answer.

243
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:24,989
And the game works equally well in any of those,

244
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:26,770
if you pick any of those options,

245
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,892
because the game is designed for this

246
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,913
to be one of the spaces where the player's imagination is

247
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:31,993
filling in the blanks.

248
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:42,095
Ambiguity can also be used as a deliberate tool when the designer chooses not just what

249
00:13:42,095 --> 00:13:47,839
to leave out, but chooses to make an aspect of the game deliberately unclear, requiring

250
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,001
the player to interpret it and act on his or her interpretation.

251
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:52,082
Emily Short's Blood and Laurels does this.

252
00:13:52,082 --> 00:14:01,128
The motivations and allegiances of NPCs are variable, requiring the observation and interpretation

253
00:14:01,128 --> 00:14:02,629
of minute clues to classify.

254
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:08,171
Andrew Plotkin's Hadean Lands does this with a variety of its world-building and character-interaction

255
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:10,192
elements, not to mention its ending.

256
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:14,013
And Alan De Niro's Solarium does it in multiple places within the text.

257
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:14,733
This one's my favorite.

258
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:18,695
Clicking on the word man changes it to woman.

259
00:14:18,695 --> 00:14:24,457
Clicking on the second his changes it to her, but the middle his stays constant.

260
00:14:24,457 --> 00:14:27,078
What exactly is the author saying?

261
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:29,239
Any one of four things, at least.

262
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:30,600
Four epigrams for the price of one.

263
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,171
Finally, there are those IF games

264
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:36,452
that use ambiguity as a deliberate tool,

265
00:14:36,452 --> 00:14:39,213
not at the prose or the world-building level,

266
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,973
but at the narrative design level itself.

267
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:43,954
The second choice of game, choice of broad size,

268
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:45,295
used this technique.

269
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:47,596
In the final scene, the PC always

270
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,056
meets the enemy captain in battle.

271
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,797
But based on the player's earlier choices,

272
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:55,238
the enemy captain can be a star-crossed lover,

273
00:14:55,238 --> 00:14:58,480
a dear friend, a rival of longstanding, or a bitter enemy.

274
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:01,198
The scene plays out the same way.

275
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:03,379
The same actions on the player's part

276
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:06,360
lead to promotion or to court-martial.

277
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,342
But precisely where the challenge lies,

278
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:14,404
the precise, the desirable outcome,

279
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:16,925
the way the scene looks, is variable

280
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:19,706
dependent on the way the player has previously

281
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:23,208
interacted with the game and the choices they have made,

282
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,209
the emotional connections they have formed.

283
00:15:26,563 --> 00:15:27,984
Four stories for the price of one.

284
00:15:27,984 --> 00:15:30,245
The game world does not exist on the screen.

285
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:32,027
It exists between the ears of the player.

286
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:35,189
Ambiguity leaves room for the player

287
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:36,790
to draw their own conclusions, provide

288
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,012
their own interpretation, insert themselves more meaningfully

289
00:15:40,012 --> 00:15:40,713
into the narrative.

290
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:43,775
The choices you make in broadsides

291
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:46,657
make you complicit not only in the ending,

292
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:49,519
but the whole story, not just how the story ends,

293
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,280
but what the story is.

294
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,322
Allowing or forcing.

295
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:58,260
the player to fill in blanks themselves gives the player an absolutely incomparable sense

296
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,722
of involvement in the story.

297
00:15:59,722 --> 00:16:03,486
Which brings us to the most interesting IF technique, the one I think has the greatest

298
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:07,551
promise when adapted into other types of game narrative, complicity.

299
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:11,155
Where complicity is defined as a feeling of ownership in the plot.

300
00:16:12,443 --> 00:16:14,945
Now, I think we can all agree that's an important thing to have.

301
00:16:14,945 --> 00:16:16,946
If we didn't think that was an important thing to have,

302
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:20,549
we would be writing some other kind of fiction, novels or screenplays.

303
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:23,951
We are writing interactive fiction because the space where the player interacts

304
00:16:23,951 --> 00:16:26,834
with the story is part of what we're trying to do.

305
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:28,955
Complicity is part of what we're manufacturing.

306
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:31,657
There are multiple ways you can do this.

307
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,219
The first is you can give the player actual choices

308
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:37,562
and allow those choices to actually affect the narrative.

309
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,741
These are games that already do this.

310
00:16:40,741 --> 00:16:43,865
Blood and Laurels, 80 Days, anything from Choice Games

311
00:16:43,865 --> 00:16:45,087
are made using ChoiceScript.

312
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,109
There are obviously a number of video games

313
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:48,091
that do this as well.

314
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:56,471
There are more variables that need to be considered when your game has more elements than just words.

315
00:16:56,471 --> 00:17:06,657
But there are ways to handle a player-choice-driven branching narrative so that it represents only an incremental and not an exponential increase in production cost.

316
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:11,959
Choice of Games has a few techniques for managing some of the perceived problems with branching narrative.

317
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,461
But again, I only have 25 minutes and that's another...

318
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:19,444
presentation, maybe next year. For the moment, whether or not you have the

319
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:23,386
budget and artistic scope to allow real choices, you can make much of what the

320
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:26,628
player does feel like a real choice by constructing a feeling of freedom for

321
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,649
the player. What do I mean by that?

322
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,022
This is a screenshot from Hadean Lands,

323
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:34,324
and this is a very typical Parser.if experience.

324
00:17:34,324 --> 00:17:39,247
You have your description, and you have your cursor,

325
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:42,209
and you get to decide the verb and noun to type next

326
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:45,912
out of all the verbs and all the nouns in the universe.

327
00:17:45,912 --> 00:17:48,914
Parser.if enthusiasts say this is

328
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:51,576
one of their favorite parts of the genre.

329
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:53,117
You can do anything.

330
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,861
except that is obviously not actually true.

331
00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:58,021
You cannot do anything.

332
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:00,302
You can do what the game has been programmed

333
00:18:00,302 --> 00:18:03,922
to allow you to do, but you feel like you can do anything.

334
00:18:03,922 --> 00:18:07,203
To borrow the words of Carolyn Van Esseltyn,

335
00:18:07,203 --> 00:18:09,044
the core parser experience grants

336
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:12,264
the illusion of infinite choice and an actual experience

337
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:14,165
of carefully restricted choice.

338
00:18:14,165 --> 00:18:16,325
And to go on in Andrew Plotkin's own words,

339
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:20,286
the core value of parser IF is freedom of action.

340
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:23,823
The player approaches it as an open-end range of choice.

341
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:26,325
I could do anything, so what does it make sense to try?

342
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:29,809
And as soon as the player asks, what makes sense here,

343
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,731
they are immersed in the game world.

344
00:18:31,731 --> 00:18:33,534
When you feel you can do anything,

345
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:35,676
what you choose to do is that much more meaningful.

346
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:41,284
If you're unable, unwilling, artistically restricted

347
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:45,085
to offering real choice or an illusion of freedom,

348
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:47,346
you can still make the player's inevitable action

349
00:18:47,346 --> 00:18:50,887
feel like I did it rather than the game made it happen to me

350
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:54,269
if you pay attention to how the action is executed.

351
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:56,830
This is at a higher level philosophically

352
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,490
than storytelling technique.

353
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,631
We're talking about mechanics in its most mechanical sense,

354
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:02,732
the way your player interacts with your game.

355
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:06,948
So, parser enthusiasts say,

356
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:09,250
parser IF has this one great advantage

357
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,812
over multiple choice lists.

358
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:15,956
If you decide to do something, you have to type it.

359
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:17,758
Not just I did it, not just it happened to me,

360
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:18,999
but I did it.

361
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:20,780
Reactive Studios knows this too.

362
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,102
Anything you do in Codename Cygnus must be spoken out loud.

363
00:19:23,102 --> 00:19:25,985
Now let's talk about the broader implication.

364
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,290
With the advent of motion sensing and voice activated

365
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,492
input devices such as the Kinect,

366
00:19:32,492 --> 00:19:35,935
it has become possible to actually allow the player

367
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:40,780
to swing the sword, throw the punch, climb the ladder,

368
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,861
and say the word.

369
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:43,282
So let's say you have an input device

370
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,984
that can reliably interpret a player

371
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,145
reading off a dialogue tree.

372
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:49,128
Just think what words you could put in their mouths.

373
00:19:49,128 --> 00:19:51,290
Short, beautiful prose that hits hard.

374
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:55,288
The Picard speech that brings peace to warring factions,

375
00:19:55,288 --> 00:19:57,569
the order to kill the enemy captain who is also

376
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:58,949
your star-crossed lover.

377
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,870
These are the experiences.

378
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,490
This is the level of emotional experience

379
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,771
that we can be bringing to our players.

380
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:10,692
So to recap, looking at public response

381
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:13,693
to some of this year's interactive fiction offerings

382
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:15,514
suggests a growing interest in good story,

383
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,274
separate from any other considerations.

384
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:26,697
IF has evolved a number of storytelling techniques that can be harvested when writing for other

385
00:20:26,697 --> 00:20:27,017
types of games.

386
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:34,263
And IF has evolved a number of tools for designing narrative.

387
00:20:34,263 --> 00:20:36,825
This is not a tool for designing narrative.

388
00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:41,328
This is optimized for other things.

389
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:42,809
It does them very well.

390
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:45,231
Numbers, graphs, formulas, got it knocked.

391
00:20:45,231 --> 00:20:49,714
It is not optimized for storyboarding or prototyping narrative.

392
00:20:51,138 --> 00:20:51,818
These are.

393
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:56,439
They are designed specifically for narrative structure,

394
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:57,659
branching or otherwise.

395
00:20:57,659 --> 00:20:59,400
They are easy to use.

396
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,760
They are free to use for prototyping.

397
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,741
And they will make your life so much easier

398
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:03,761
than using a spreadsheet.

399
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:06,702
So there is the perception that the day of interactive fiction

400
00:21:06,702 --> 00:21:10,583
has come and gone, that it gave birth to the graphics-based

401
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:14,984
game and then faded away, except for a small fandom

402
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:17,064
in a back room somewhere.

403
00:21:17,064 --> 00:21:17,705
But that's not true.

404
00:21:18,907 --> 00:21:26,271
Interactive fiction is a vibrant art form. It is still evolving. It is still trying new experiments. It is still developing new techniques.

405
00:21:26,271 --> 00:21:31,515
And there is hard evidence to suggest it still has a hell of a following, growing all the time.

406
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:42,541
The established narrative techniques and new narrative experiments in IF are generating enthusiasm from your target market and from people who might become your target market

407
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:46,484
by using IF's narrative techniques in conjunction with other tools for

408
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:51,240
game development video games can be taken to new artistic heights

409
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,083
and perhaps also to new heights on Metacritic.

410
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:54,724
Thank you.
