00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:12,430
Hello and welcome to day five of GDC Showcase.

2
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,411
I'm Gamma Sutra's news editor and associate publisher

3
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:17,532
and your host for this AMA, Alyssa McAloon.

4
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:20,354
I'll be moderating today's session with Brian Horton,

5
00:00:20,494 --> 00:00:22,155
creative director at Insomniac Games.

6
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:24,736
We'll be taking your questions throughout the chat.

7
00:00:25,156 --> 00:00:27,577
So feel free to drop those in the questions tab

8
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:28,978
in the little chat box on the right side

9
00:00:28,998 --> 00:00:29,778
of your screen throughout.

10
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:32,680
Kind of keep things geared towards game development

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,780
as we are GDC here,

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,482
and we'll try to get your answers throughout the show.

13
00:00:36,502 --> 00:00:36,542
So.

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,393
With that, let's introduce today's AMA guest.

15
00:00:40,653 --> 00:00:41,434
Brian, hello.

16
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:42,995
Would you like to introduce yourself?

17
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:44,817
Hey, thanks so much, Alyssa.

18
00:00:45,318 --> 00:00:48,921
You know, it's an honor to be invited at GDC to talk about Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales.

19
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:50,583
My name is Brian Horton.

20
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:52,204
I'm the Creative Director at Insomniac Games.

21
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:56,468
A quick bio for me, I've been a developer for about 26 years

22
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:58,951
and a Creative Director at Insomniac for the past three.

23
00:01:01,448 --> 00:01:01,948
Great to have you.

24
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:02,808
Yeah, thanks.

25
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:07,232
You know, I'd like to answer some questions.

26
00:01:07,252 --> 00:01:08,372
I'm really excited to do that.

27
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:10,714
But I'd also like to provide some context

28
00:01:11,014 --> 00:01:12,815
and a short story overview

29
00:01:13,136 --> 00:01:16,858
and the pillars that helped make our game happen.

30
00:01:16,898 --> 00:01:18,139
So does that sound like something we can do?

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,200
Yeah, all for it. Let's go.

32
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:20,901
All right.

33
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:27,383
You know, I would say working on Spider-Man definitely has been a career highlight,

34
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:31,325
because my love for this iconic web-slinger runs deep.

35
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:37,367
Like most kids from the 70s, I watched the Spider-Man cartoons every Saturday morning.

36
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:43,389
My mom made me homemade Spider-Man outfits when I was a kid, and I rocked them on Halloween.

37
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:49,531
And of course, I poured through all my classic Spider-Man comics.

38
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,796
But years later, I rediscovered my love for the iconic web slinger in Miles Morales.

39
00:01:56,797 --> 00:02:00,901
Brian Michael Bendis and Sarah Pacelli brought a fresh new energy to the franchise,

40
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:03,123
and it was a huge influence on the Insomniac team.

41
00:02:03,844 --> 00:02:06,967
We fell in love with Miles, and it was essential to make a video game,

42
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:10,491
Origin Story, that was special experience.

43
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:13,454
And it started with our first game, Marvel's Spider-Man.

44
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:17,964
Miles is an Afro-Latino teen born and raised in Brooklyn.

45
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:22,185
His passions include science, playing ball, mixing beats,

46
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:25,086
and his favorite hero, Spider-Man.

47
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:29,087
And in our story, Peter is an older and more experienced

48
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:29,407
hero.

49
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:32,087
And this provided us a unique opportunity

50
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:35,768
for a new take on the origin story with Miles.

51
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:40,290
So when he was bitten by a genetically engineered spider,

52
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:43,555
and discovered his new powers, it

53
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:45,816
was destiny that Peter would be his mentor

54
00:02:46,336 --> 00:02:48,418
and show Miles the ropes to become a hero.

55
00:02:49,538 --> 00:02:50,819
So this brings us to the beginning

56
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,761
of the game in Marvel's Spider-Man, Miles Morales.

57
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:57,244
It's a year later, and it's the first day of winter break.

58
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:59,905
Miles' skills will be put to the test.

59
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:03,688
When Rhino escapes a prison convoy carving a path

60
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:07,510
of destruction across Manhattan, Peter is injured in the battle,

61
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:09,932
and Miles must protect his mentor.

62
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:13,233
Bioelectricity will surge through his body.

63
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:18,116
An explosive new power helps him to defeat Rhino.

64
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:20,657
But after this harrowing encounter,

65
00:03:21,398 --> 00:03:23,199
Miles learns his mentor is leaving town

66
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:23,959
for a couple of weeks.

67
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:27,181
And this huge responsibility weighs on Miles.

68
00:03:28,862 --> 00:03:29,582
But he's not alone.

69
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:32,804
His best friend, Genki Lee, knows his spider secret

70
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:34,845
and will support Miles while he stays

71
00:03:34,885 --> 00:03:35,885
with them over winter break.

72
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:39,350
The Morales family recently moved from Brooklyn

73
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,451
to his mother's childhood apartment in East Harlem.

74
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:44,991
It's a vibrant and multicultural community

75
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:47,352
made even more beautiful by the fresh snow

76
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:48,512
and holiday decorations.

77
00:03:49,332 --> 00:03:51,233
But all isn't well in Miles' new home.

78
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:55,734
Roxxon is days away from opening a new power plant

79
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:56,775
in the heart of Harlem,

80
00:03:57,235 --> 00:04:01,296
powered by an experimental energy source called Nuform.

81
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:06,274
Rio Morales, Miles' mom, runs for city council

82
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:07,774
to fight Roxxon's push into Harlem

83
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:10,034
and to protect the people and neighborhood she loves.

84
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:12,695
And like all great Spider-Man stories,

85
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:15,276
Miles' personal and hero lives collide

86
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:18,396
when his mother's rally is attacked by the Underground,

87
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:21,577
a high-tech criminal army led by the Tinkerer

88
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:23,718
who steals Roxxon's new form.

89
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:26,298
When Miles tries to stop her,

90
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:29,719
his powers destabilize this experimental energy source.

91
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:33,505
resulting in an explosion that destroys Braithwaite Bridge,

92
00:04:34,185 --> 00:04:36,107
only deepening his doubts as a hero.

93
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:39,109
So that's a little bit of a primer of our story,

94
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,831
but ultimately this is a game

95
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:43,793
where Miles must rise to the challenge

96
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:47,275
to become his own Spider-Man, overcoming his fears

97
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,857
and mastering his new powers to stop the war

98
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:51,279
that threatens his new home.

99
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,481
And we built this game on three pillars

100
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:56,743
that are an evolution from the first game

101
00:04:57,123 --> 00:04:58,745
while taking full advantage of the power

102
00:04:58,765 --> 00:04:59,345
of the PlayStation 5.

103
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:04,416
Our first pillar is to become an explosive new Spider-Man.

104
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:07,519
Our second was to protect your home

105
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:09,040
from two warring factions.

106
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:14,024
And the third is to play a seamless cinematic experience.

107
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,864
So in our first pillar, Become an Explosive New Spider-Man,

108
00:05:18,345 --> 00:05:20,285
we wanted Miles to play differently from Peter,

109
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:23,287
with new combat, traversal, and gadgets

110
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:25,948
that reflect his unique powers, bioelectricity,

111
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:28,889
and optical camouflage, and his unique personality.

112
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:30,430
So when you see Miles swing through the city,

113
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,451
he has his own unique take on how he is a web slayer.

114
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,092
So these powers are gonna grow throughout the game

115
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,253
as Miles and the player become more experienced.

116
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:41,434
In our second pillar,

117
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:43,515
protect your home from two warring factions,

118
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:45,916
Harlem is ground zero for a two-sided war

119
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:47,777
between Roxxon and the underground.

120
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:49,718
And Miles must defeat these threats

121
00:05:50,198 --> 00:05:51,539
to protect his family, friends,

122
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:52,719
and all the people of Harlem.

123
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,201
In our final pillar,

124
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:57,281
play a seamless cinematic experience.

125
00:05:57,742 --> 00:05:59,863
We wanted the player to have an uninterrupted journey

126
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:00,803
from beginning to end,

127
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:02,504
eliminating loading screens

128
00:06:02,764 --> 00:06:06,005
to keep the player engrossed in the story and gameplay.

129
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,443
So Insomniac Games' mission is to make a positive and lasting

130
00:06:11,523 --> 00:06:12,664
impact in people's lives.

131
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:15,006
And Miles lives up to these ideals,

132
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:18,329
earning the name Spider-Man by embracing those unique powers

133
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:19,109
to save Harlem.

134
00:06:20,911 --> 00:06:23,273
So it was an honor to work with PlayStation, Marvel

135
00:06:23,293 --> 00:06:25,775
Games, and the talented actors and amazing developers

136
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:28,617
at Insomniac Games to bring Marvel Spider-Man to life.

137
00:06:29,298 --> 00:06:31,439
And I really want to thank GDC for inviting

138
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:34,442
me to talk to you guys today and answer some of your questions.

139
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:37,064
So with that, I think we should just go ahead and wrap up.

140
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:38,018
Ask away.

141
00:06:38,575 --> 00:06:39,955
Yeah, they've been flowing in.

142
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:41,997
So we'll just go ahead and get started here.

143
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:46,039
Coming from, let's see, this is kind of going to mix

144
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,600
a question from Tremaine in chat

145
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,801
with a question from Emilius in chat,

146
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:54,003
talking about how Miles Morales differs from Peter

147
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:55,784
as like a protagonist mechanically.

148
00:06:56,224 --> 00:06:57,485
So Tremaine wanted to know,

149
00:06:58,205 --> 00:07:00,767
they noticed that Miles is not as strong

150
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,348
or can't jump as high or as far as Pete.

151
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,389
Was this a conscious decision made from the start

152
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:07,410
or was this made for balancing with Miles' other abilities?

153
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,081
Yeah, I think we really looked at ways that we can offset

154
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:13,764
the power set between Peter and Miles.

155
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:16,786
And one of those was, you know,

156
00:07:16,806 --> 00:07:19,048
some of the distances strengths that he has as a character.

157
00:07:19,088 --> 00:07:21,690
He's not as experienced as Peter, he's not quite as strong,

158
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,072
but what we do have to compliment against that

159
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:26,474
is the power of his bioelectric punches.

160
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:29,036
And with that, with bioelectricity,

161
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:32,799
he's also able to dash and go across large distances.

162
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,321
So when you're swinging through the world

163
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:35,201
and you have a venom,

164
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:39,364
bar available, you can actually dash using Venom Dash to gain more speed.

165
00:07:39,404 --> 00:07:44,007
So we found that our new powers was a way to offset and create some of the dynamism

166
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:46,868
that we may have pulled back from from the first game.

167
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:51,791
Well, that's kind of flows right into what Amelis was asking here,

168
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:53,492
saying that as Peter players would.

169
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:55,053
Oh, no, it scrolled. It scrolled. Where'd it go?

170
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:57,615
Sorry, this is live chat here.

171
00:07:57,995 --> 00:08:01,017
So as Peter, the player would progress and earn new abilities via suit upgrades.

172
00:08:01,457 --> 00:08:04,199
Miles, on the other hand, already has a few abilities at.

173
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:09,160
Naturally, most of them render the ones Peter had redundant if transported to this game.

174
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,805
Can you talk a bit more about the creative choice to remove all suit abilities and replace

175
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:17,151
them with passive mods? Maybe also a bit about intertwining his abilities with key level moments?

176
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:26,806
Yeah, the passive mods was something that we came to as a really exciting way to give the players that mix and match capability of new powers and really to start chasing those suits.

177
00:08:26,846 --> 00:08:32,012
People love getting new suits. So we are still getting a reward for each suit that you could craft.

178
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:35,576
That said, we wanted to balance that against the powers.

179
00:08:35,896 --> 00:08:38,058
So when you had suit powers before, they were like these really.

180
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,701
amazing OP skills, which were a lot of fun.

181
00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:43,404
But what we wanted to do instead was leverage

182
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:46,567
all of Miles bioelectric attacks as a way to get some

183
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:49,450
of that spectacle back and balance the suit power.

184
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,093
So by having the suit mods, we think that was a good way

185
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:56,016
to still encourage suits and acquisition of suits

186
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,599
to get new things, but also lean more

187
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:01,261
into Miles inherent powers and abilities.

188
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,222
Awesome. So I'm going to take another question from Joaquin here in chat,

189
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:07,943
but I'm also going to hijack it a bit with my own.

190
00:09:07,963 --> 00:09:09,184
These are all great questions, by the way.

191
00:09:09,204 --> 00:09:10,384
I want to say these are wonderful.

192
00:09:10,544 --> 00:09:12,946
There's so many more in here that we're going to get to that are incredible

193
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:13,906
and keep them coming throughout.

194
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:15,407
We'll get to as many as we have time for.

195
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:19,249
So the next question here is, how are you guys able to plan and schedule

196
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:21,951
the development length for this kind of smaller Spider-Man adventure?

197
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:25,592
And I'm also curious personally about doing this during a pandemic.

198
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,094
If you could kind of talk about your development for the whole game.

199
00:09:28,754 --> 00:09:29,274
Schedule wise.

200
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:34,496
Yeah, we knew we had the fantastic foundation of Marvel Spider-Man, which I had the honor to work

201
00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:40,098
on with Brian Intihar and the whole team. But so we had a lot of the core key systems from the

202
00:09:40,118 --> 00:09:45,539
first game, which allowed us to really quickly iterate. And our focus was how do we make Miles

203
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:49,421
feel unique? That was the first thing we did. So we spent a lot of our early pre-production time

204
00:09:49,461 --> 00:09:50,441
just developing Miles.

205
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:56,722
unique core skill sets. And also we were developing a whole new cast of enemies. So the underground

206
00:09:56,983 --> 00:10:01,724
posed a whole new kind of level of threat and we wanted to make sure that their powers worked

207
00:10:01,824 --> 00:10:09,646
specifically against and was a nice ballet between venom bioelectricity and their programmable matter

208
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:14,367
weapons. So we spent a lot of the early development developing those systems and also Miles' unique

209
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:19,208
traversal style. So that's where we spent a lot of our pre-production and we're able to roll into

210
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:19,668
production.

211
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:23,012
in a very short amount of time because of the foundation of the first game.

212
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,997
So we did build our game in vertical sort of slices.

213
00:10:27,398 --> 00:10:31,362
So we had multiple slice productions where we work on portions of the game

214
00:10:31,683 --> 00:10:34,786
and that brought them up to a quality that you could play the whole game from beginning to end.

215
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:39,893
We also developed our story very early on and tested it all along the way with storyboards.

216
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:41,813
before we went to the mocap stage.

217
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:44,214
And that goes into the final set question,

218
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:46,454
which is how we dealt with the pandemic.

219
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:48,655
Luckily, we had a lot of our cinematic shot,

220
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,635
but we had a number of story revisions that came after alpha

221
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:54,116
that meant that we needed to get new data.

222
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:56,336
But with a pandemic, we couldn't go to the stage.

223
00:10:56,396 --> 00:10:59,657
So our animation team did an amazing job adapting old data,

224
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:03,918
getting new data either from a remote access safe location,

225
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:06,478
or they even recorded some of their own data themselves.

226
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,264
to help assemble these scenes in a very unique way that we've never done before.

227
00:11:10,624 --> 00:11:13,849
So I just wanted to give a really big shout out to our animation team for being so

228
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:16,152
ingenious during the pandemic.

229
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:19,690
I've talked to a couple developers at this.

230
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,771
We did a GDC podcast episode

231
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:23,632
with the Jackbox folks a while ago

232
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:25,553
and talking to people about the pandemic.

233
00:11:25,673 --> 00:11:28,055
It's so interesting to hear where the timing works out

234
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:29,256
for like where it hit in this part.

235
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:30,637
These projects we're kind of like seeing now

236
00:11:30,697 --> 00:11:31,577
and saw a few months ago,

237
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:33,638
just how like everything was torn asunder

238
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:34,779
towards the end in the middle

239
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,120
and how it does adapted to it.

240
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,121
So thank you for sharing that.

241
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:41,171
Let's see, another one from Harris here says,

242
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:43,013
it was revealed a couple of years ago

243
00:11:43,073 --> 00:11:45,636
how much technical wizardry was, excuse me,

244
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:47,338
was cleverly concealed by the direction

245
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:49,240
of the opening cut scene of Spider-Man in PS,

246
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,802
or Spider-Man, the first one.

247
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:53,966
Is there any moment in particular in Miles Morales

248
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,288
that comes to your mind as achieving seamless parody

249
00:11:56,328 --> 00:11:57,950
across the technical and the creative sides?

250
00:11:58,555 --> 00:12:01,077
Yeah, so we really took on our third pillar,

251
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:03,698
play a seamless cinematic experience.

252
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:05,839
Even a step further from Spider-Man,

253
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,260
there are no loading screens in Miles Morales

254
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,301
on the PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation 5.

255
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:11,722
So that was a big goal for us.

256
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:15,143
So we start our game in the subway with Miles Morales.

257
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:16,284
And as soon as you hit start,

258
00:12:16,644 --> 00:12:20,588
You seamlessly enter into the city and begin the video game with no loading screens.

259
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:24,531
So there was a lot of trickery we had to do to think about how do we get into

260
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:28,314
Miles' apartment without a loading screen and then out into the world.

261
00:12:28,735 --> 00:12:31,978
All of those were innovations that the team worked on together

262
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:36,962
on Miles Morales to make that even more seamless and more immersive.

263
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:43,151
So kind of bouncing off those pillars there again, Z in chat wants to know, can you tell

264
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:46,893
us a bit about the pillars from the first game for comparison and how they changed the second game

265
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,514
to distinguish the experience of Miles Morales?

266
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,972
Yeah, the pillars in the first game was really,

267
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,013
it was driven off of the idea to play

268
00:12:54,353 --> 00:12:55,654
like a Marvel movie feels,

269
00:12:55,874 --> 00:13:01,137
the idea of getting this bombastic, amazing sense

270
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:03,458
of cinematic drama that you'd get from a Spider-Man

271
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:07,200
and bring that to responsive, fast gameplay.

272
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,701
So that was a guiding principle that I think,

273
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:12,442
Brian Anterhart and the team really drove towards

274
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:14,023
that brought...

275
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:20,507
a level of spectacle and fun factor to the Spider-Man franchise. So that is still a foundation

276
00:13:20,547 --> 00:13:26,331
of what we build on. These pillars were additive. They were just a way for us to really be super

277
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:34,056
specific about Miles' character, the story he had, the threats, and our theme of Miles

278
00:13:34,256 --> 00:13:41,340
learning his new neighborhood, his new home of Harlem, and how he was going to let that be fuel.

279
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,562
to learn how to become a new Spider-Man.

280
00:13:43,842 --> 00:13:45,383
So that's, I think the biggest change

281
00:13:45,463 --> 00:13:48,445
was being very specific about how this was going to be

282
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:50,346
a Miles Morales experience versus just,

283
00:13:51,126 --> 00:13:52,447
versus a Peter Parker experience.

284
00:13:53,403 --> 00:13:56,764
I guess let's talk a bit more about crafting Miles as a character.

285
00:13:56,964 --> 00:14:01,284
There's a lot of comments coming to chat here about seeing diversity in a video game,

286
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:05,825
seeing like a deaf character or even like Miles's family or like LGBT inclusion.

287
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,666
So we'll start at the top here with...

288
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:09,546
Tremaine's question got uploaded very quickly.

289
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:12,667
So they say they're all about diversity and love the game.

290
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,807
So when it was decided that Miles would get his own game,

291
00:14:15,307 --> 00:14:19,268
how did you go about making sure that Harlem and its residents were properly represented?

292
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:21,768
Some studios failed to get the properly part, but you guys nailed it.

293
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:25,079
Authenticity was one of our key ingredients

294
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,581
to across the whole franchise.

295
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:29,585
When we talk about his new home of Harlem,

296
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:31,207
a lot of that started with research.

297
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:33,390
Our team did exhaustive amount of research

298
00:14:33,651 --> 00:14:36,455
to ensure that the city itself felt authentic,

299
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:38,377
the people within it as well.

300
00:14:38,638 --> 00:14:39,138
We actually did...

301
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:43,003
We actually went to Harlem with a group of people

302
00:14:43,043 --> 00:14:44,584
to talk to the residents of Harlem

303
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,484
and to show them early builds of our game,

304
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,625
to get an idea of like,

305
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:50,765
hey, does Miles' apartment feel correct?

306
00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:56,246
And we talked to people with mixed ethnicities

307
00:14:56,266 --> 00:15:00,287
to ensure not only is Miles as a black American,

308
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:02,368
but having Puerto Rican roots.

309
00:15:02,508 --> 00:15:04,588
Those cultures and those different aspects

310
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:05,508
of his personality.

311
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:07,693
and the culture being represented correctly.

312
00:15:08,013 --> 00:15:09,654
So we actually made a lot of,

313
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:13,358
got a lot of amazing data and made some informed decisions

314
00:15:13,418 --> 00:15:15,440
how we can get better representation across the game,

315
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,221
not only in the way the world looks,

316
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:18,282
but the people themselves.

317
00:15:19,123 --> 00:15:20,785
And a big shout out to our narrative team,

318
00:15:20,825 --> 00:15:22,086
Ben Arfman is a lead writer,

319
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:24,128
Mary Kenny as a senior writer.

320
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:28,402
Mary Kenny worked very closely with Evan Narciss,

321
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:30,705
one of our story consultants,

322
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:32,467
to ensure all the people of Harlem,

323
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:34,670
the quest givers, felt correct.

324
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:36,392
So Haley is one of our, you know,

325
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:39,196
we're so proud of bringing Haley to the game.

326
00:15:40,677 --> 00:15:42,879
It really is just a powerful community organizer,

327
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:45,421
but also just the next level of representation

328
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:50,024
by showing authentic ASL between Miles and her in the game.

329
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:53,646
That was a huge innovation for both story and also animation.

330
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:58,709
So yeah, we just feel like research and asking questions

331
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:01,911
and working with people outside of our team

332
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:04,513
to help ensure that everything we did on the screen

333
00:16:05,113 --> 00:16:06,094
was authentic and correct.

334
00:16:06,987 --> 00:16:11,070
So Angelica in chat here has a question about ASL.

335
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,612
They say that they love that ASL made an appearance in the game.

336
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,974
Can you talk about the decision to bring that into the game and

337
00:16:16,014 --> 00:16:18,376
kind of what kind of challenges the team had to do to make that

338
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:19,256
as successful as it was?

339
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:23,003
So it was Mary Kenny wanted to create a deaf character

340
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:24,404
in the game and Haley was born,

341
00:16:25,024 --> 00:16:27,024
but that came with a number of technical challenges.

342
00:16:27,364 --> 00:16:30,465
Like how do we correctly capture ASL in the game?

343
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:34,765
So we actually hired ASL actors, Haley specifically,

344
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:38,206
and even Miles who is played by Nanji Jeter,

345
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:42,487
we had someone who spoke ASL or was fluent in ASL

346
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:46,727
to do the mocap and we created brand new technology

347
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:48,808
at the capture stage and with our animators.

348
00:16:49,148 --> 00:16:53,691
to ensure that all the finger movements were captured correctly. So there was a lot of work

349
00:16:53,852 --> 00:17:00,076
to ensure that this was going to be done right. And we actually brought a consultant in as well

350
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:04,179
on the day of the stage to ensure anything that we wrote in the script, if there were any words

351
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:10,704
or anything that needed to be unique or sorry, that was not authentic or correct, that we would

352
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:14,927
make those adjustments on the stage, including the fact that Miles is actually not as experienced

353
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:18,750
with ASL. So his version of ASL is very different than Haley's.

354
00:17:20,187 --> 00:17:22,668
as a beginner versus someone who's more experienced.

355
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:26,369
And like, it sounds like that having that kind of technology

356
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:28,209
and taking the time to go through those steps

357
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:30,650
and establish like workflows for that

358
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,211
is makes it easier for including that stuff

359
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:34,811
in the future too.

360
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:36,792
100%, I think it was an innovation

361
00:17:36,812 --> 00:17:38,032
that we'll be building on in the future.

362
00:17:39,528 --> 00:17:41,770
All right, another question here from,

363
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,051
another one from Tremaine, thank you.

364
00:17:43,691 --> 00:17:45,132
Can you walk us through a typical day

365
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,713
as a creative director for Insomniac?

366
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:48,275
What are your responsibilities, pressures,

367
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:49,015
and what do you enjoy?

368
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:53,258
Well, one, Insomniac Games is just an amazing company

369
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:53,878
to work for.

370
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,460
It's, we have a philosophy

371
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,341
that great ideas come from everywhere.

372
00:17:58,121 --> 00:18:01,844
So anyone on the team is contributing on the core

373
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:05,046
of what makes Spider-Man or any game we work on unique.

374
00:18:05,206 --> 00:18:07,508
So it's about finding and pulling

375
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:16,955
collecting the ideas from our team and trying to come up with a vision that allows people to contribute ideas.

376
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:20,459
So if I think about my typical day, it starts first very early on.

377
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,690
to make sure that there is a clear vision and goal.

378
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,891
Once we have that, then it really just is a matter of,

379
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,311
on a day-to-day basis, working with the team

380
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:31,252
and helping steer to the final result

381
00:18:31,272 --> 00:18:32,332
that we're trying to accomplish.

382
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:36,993
But it is, a day-to-day usually is a lot of conversations

383
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:40,054
early, working very closely with Cam Christian,

384
00:18:40,634 --> 00:18:44,195
the game director, Jess Reed, the head of production,

385
00:18:44,895 --> 00:18:47,075
and other leadership group to make sure

386
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:48,876
that every single person that is...

387
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:53,097
leading this effort has a clear direction and goal of what they need to do.

388
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:57,638
And then, you know, throughout the day, it's a lot of meetings. It's a lot of playing the game

389
00:18:58,618 --> 00:19:02,059
and asking questions and hopefully providing some direction that's going to get us

390
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:07,320
to the next level. And then, you know, we do it all over again every day. So it's a really

391
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,821
fun and collaborative experience. Just kind of building on that,

392
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:14,902
obviously you didn't like wake up one day, join the game industry and suddenly be a creative

393
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:18,463
director. How did you kind of get to where you are now? And I guess what lessons did you carry

394
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:19,643
forward from other roles you've had?

395
00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:22,238
Yeah, I've been very fortunate.

396
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:26,701
I went to art school, so I'm trained as an illustrator

397
00:19:26,721 --> 00:19:31,104
and a painter, and I got my first job at Disney Interactive

398
00:19:31,184 --> 00:19:33,246
in 1994, right out of college.

399
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:34,927
And then from there, I've just progressed.

400
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:43,093
from different companies. I worked at DreamWorks, I worked at Electronic Arts, I worked at Crystal

401
00:19:43,113 --> 00:19:48,016
Dynamics on Tomb Raider, and that was where I really learned a tremendous amount of that

402
00:19:48,497 --> 00:19:51,839
AAA video game development before going.

403
00:19:52,175 --> 00:19:55,178
to Infinity Ward and eventually coming to Insomniac Games.

404
00:19:55,218 --> 00:19:58,240
So yeah, across 26 years, I've picked up a lot of things.

405
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,483
But one thing I will say is working at Insomniac,

406
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:03,504
it is a mixture of excellence

407
00:20:03,864 --> 00:20:06,226
and really taking care of the team,

408
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:07,147
the wellbeing of the team.

409
00:20:07,187 --> 00:20:09,469
That's something that we really are priding ourselves on.

410
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:13,052
And actually making a positive statement in the world

411
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,214
that our mission to make a positive, lasting impact.

412
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:19,491
To me, that's a reason to want to make video games,

413
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,812
is to say something important.

414
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:24,735
So yeah, I've been very fortunate to sort of grow

415
00:20:24,816 --> 00:20:27,678
from an artist to a lead artist to an art director

416
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:30,721
and eventually into game direction and creative direction.

417
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:33,023
And that's been a gradual experience.

418
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,002
I guess speaking of jumps from one thing to another,

419
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:38,824
PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5

420
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:41,348
for Marvel's Spider-Man versus Miles Morales.

421
00:20:42,469 --> 00:20:44,952
Gonna grab a couple of questions on that quick,

422
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:46,294
but we'll start off with Brian's here.

423
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:48,576
It says, hey Brian, can you talk about

424
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:51,660
Insomniac's engine evolution from PS4 to PS5

425
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,682
and what you were able to achieve

426
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:53,643
with the new console high tech?

427
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:59,171
Yeah, we have an amazing core team who works on our engine.

428
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:03,273
Abdul, one of our senior programmers,

429
00:21:03,713 --> 00:21:07,174
created our ray traced reflections for the PlayStation 5.

430
00:21:07,314 --> 00:21:08,915
And that was one of our huge innovations.

431
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,876
And what that really means is to make sure that every,

432
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,237
you know, if you think of New York City,

433
00:21:14,557 --> 00:21:16,918
it's a city of skyscrapers made out of glass, right?

434
00:21:17,018 --> 00:21:19,719
So if every single surface can reflect correctly,

435
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:23,803
and you can see the characters in the world reflecting, the world just becomes that much

436
00:21:23,863 --> 00:21:29,708
more rich and realistic looking. The other area that we focused on is allowing options of how you

437
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:37,496
play. So you can either play at 60 frames per second at a near 4k, or you can play at a hybrid

438
00:21:38,076 --> 00:21:43,601
60 frames per second at a lower resolution that's upscaled, or you can play at 30 frames per second

439
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:45,203
with full ray trace.

440
00:21:45,923 --> 00:21:46,564
full ray tracing.

441
00:21:46,604 --> 00:21:48,345
So we had all these different options

442
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:51,286
to give the player more choice on how they played the game.

443
00:21:51,826 --> 00:21:54,227
But any mode that you play on the PlayStation 5

444
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:58,769
is definitely the most superior Spider-Man experience

445
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:59,249
you could have.

446
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:03,451
It truly is amazing to play the game in 60 frames per second

447
00:22:03,691 --> 00:22:05,352
with ray tracing in our hybrid mode.

448
00:22:05,912 --> 00:22:11,735
So it's been a really amazing progress.

449
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:13,815
To see our technology grow from the PlayStation 4,

450
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:14,896
which already looked amazing.

451
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:18,191
into the PlayStation 5 on launch day,

452
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:19,773
that was a huge accomplishment.

453
00:22:19,813 --> 00:22:21,334
And kudos to our tech team.

454
00:22:22,414 --> 00:22:24,076
So of course, Miles Morales is available

455
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,277
on both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

456
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:29,740
Can you talk a little bit about kind of developing

457
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,361
for these two different kinds of technology

458
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:32,442
with different capabilities

459
00:22:32,522 --> 00:22:34,984
and making those experiences like good

460
00:22:35,044 --> 00:22:35,985
on both sides of the fence?

461
00:22:36,525 --> 00:22:38,006
Cause it'd be easy to go forward and be like,

462
00:22:38,026 --> 00:22:39,828
well, here's all these cool PlayStation 5 features

463
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:41,589
and have the PlayStation 4 version left out.

464
00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:43,090
But it seems like you guys achieved a balance.

465
00:22:43,771 --> 00:22:50,306
Yeah, we wanted to make sure the PlayStation 4 consumer is going to get a Spider-Man experience that they were accustomed to.

466
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,562
the same level of fidelity of art and storytelling

467
00:22:54,602 --> 00:22:56,964
and characterization, all of that,

468
00:22:57,144 --> 00:22:58,305
all the gorgeous graphics,

469
00:22:58,445 --> 00:23:01,367
all of that that we saw on the PlayStation 4 is represented.

470
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,368
But we wanted to make sure we had this upside,

471
00:23:03,388 --> 00:23:05,590
this idea when you did go to the PlayStation 5,

472
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,532
these other ingredients would really help contribute

473
00:23:08,852 --> 00:23:10,393
to the overall experience.

474
00:23:10,934 --> 00:23:12,395
And in addition to the visuals,

475
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:16,137
we really did enhance the 3D audio in the game.

476
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:21,722
We wanted to make sure that the haptic controller was getting maximum use.

477
00:23:21,782 --> 00:23:26,025
So when you do play with haptics, it really does add another level of immersion.

478
00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:31,290
So I think that's the big difference is the tremendous pieces of hardware like

479
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:35,693
the controller, the 3D audio, in addition to the capabilities to run at 60 and

480
00:23:36,254 --> 00:23:38,456
with ray tracing, those are the big differences.

481
00:23:39,263 --> 00:23:41,545
I think like Miles Morales was the first game I played

482
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:43,225
that had the adapter trigger functionality in it.

483
00:23:43,245 --> 00:23:45,767
So like that was like my first moment was like swinging

484
00:23:45,787 --> 00:23:47,227
and being like, oh my gosh, this is so cool.

485
00:23:47,247 --> 00:23:48,808
It was a great way to showcase that tech.

486
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:52,450
We're not here to talk about what I care about.

487
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,271
Oh no, I think that's great.

488
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:55,851
Thanks for playing the game, by the way.

489
00:23:55,891 --> 00:23:58,032
Yeah, I'm bad at it, but it's incredible.

490
00:23:58,793 --> 00:24:02,354
Ellen in chat wants to ask if you can talk a bit

491
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,555
about the animation challenges your team faced

492
00:24:04,595 --> 00:24:06,436
to show how Miles is more inexperienced

493
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:08,357
with web slinging in combat compared to Peter.

494
00:24:09,435 --> 00:24:11,997
Sure, I'm just gonna give a big shout out to James Hamm.

495
00:24:12,377 --> 00:24:15,679
He did a lot of the principal animation and traversal

496
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,221
that it gave the personality of Miles Morales

497
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:19,122
versus Peter Parker.

498
00:24:19,162 --> 00:24:21,884
As soon as you play that first moment

499
00:24:21,984 --> 00:24:23,766
where you web swing as Miles Morales,

500
00:24:23,806 --> 00:24:25,567
you can feel that it's a different character.

501
00:24:26,127 --> 00:24:27,608
And a lot of that came down to

502
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:30,190
James putting himself into the idea.

503
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,733
He started as amateur parkour and he loves movement

504
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:36,535
and he's a big fan of the character.

505
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:40,676
And he wanted to bring a different personality to Miles Morales.

506
00:24:40,997 --> 00:24:44,518
So that was a big part of it is like, how do we get his web slinging feeling unique?

507
00:24:44,538 --> 00:24:48,959
And you're going to see a little bit more of out of control, but also a little bit more style.

508
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:54,020
We put a lot of effort into additional manual tricks, so he's going to have fun.

509
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,321
He's like a younger, new Spider-Man.

510
00:24:56,621 --> 00:25:00,062
We wanted the player to have this sense of joy when they swung through the city.

511
00:25:01,022 --> 00:25:03,785
augmenting that with more performable tricks.

512
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:05,386
So that was a huge part.

513
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:06,747
And then when it came to the combat,

514
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,010
we wanted a little bit more desperation and clumsiness,

515
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,491
but also this tremendous power

516
00:25:11,951 --> 00:25:12,912
when you see him performing

517
00:25:13,072 --> 00:25:15,134
all the different bioelectric moves.

518
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:17,296
And then the other thing that's really exciting

519
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:19,958
is the fact that Miles has this optical camouflage.

520
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:23,339
he can now scare people by going invisible

521
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:25,599
and redirecting into different places.

522
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,200
So that also informed a lot of the way he moves

523
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:29,741
through the world.

524
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:33,042
So, and then I'd be remiss not to see Najee Jeter

525
00:25:33,422 --> 00:25:35,442
who has done such a great job bringing life

526
00:25:35,502 --> 00:25:37,463
to the character and every cinematic

527
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,384
and all the VO you hear that informs a lot

528
00:25:40,404 --> 00:25:41,544
of who the character is as well.

529
00:25:42,097 --> 00:25:44,857
There's a second part to Ellen's question that I accidentally did not read.

530
00:25:45,358 --> 00:25:47,778
They're curious about while you're going through those animations

531
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:51,719
to make them kind of distinctly miles and a little bit more unexperienced.

532
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,220
Was were there ever concerns about it becoming unclear

533
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,441
what the player was doing or kind of like

534
00:25:58,501 --> 00:26:01,042
an inexperienced on miles side,

535
00:26:01,082 --> 00:26:03,083
making the player feel like they might be doing something wrong?

536
00:26:03,743 --> 00:26:04,703
Yeah, we wanted to balance.

537
00:26:06,747 --> 00:26:14,013
the flair, like him, like, like sort of like arms, you know, in the air, legs, the bicycling

538
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:17,776
that might happen with his legs, all of that is flair, but not necessarily to make you

539
00:26:17,816 --> 00:26:18,637
feel out of control.

540
00:26:18,697 --> 00:26:24,182
So anytime you wanted to go up to a place, it still had the same accuracy of Spider-Man.

541
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:28,846
But what we wanted to do is on those in between things, provide a level of animation that

542
00:26:29,126 --> 00:26:30,688
that just gave him a different personality.

543
00:26:30,728 --> 00:26:34,312
So we didn't want to mess up a lot

544
00:26:34,412 --> 00:26:35,633
of what made Spider-Man great,

545
00:26:35,673 --> 00:26:38,296
which was that accurate and fluid traversal

546
00:26:38,456 --> 00:26:39,017
from the first game.

547
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,241
You got me scrolling questions here.

548
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:46,303
There was one that was very good about I'm so sorry, I'm going to paraphrase

549
00:26:46,323 --> 00:26:48,244
because I can't find it in the drawing list of questions

550
00:26:49,164 --> 00:26:52,526
talking about kind of getting that cinematic experience you talked about before.

551
00:26:53,026 --> 00:26:55,828
Can you talk a bit about maybe the technical kind of like tricks

552
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:58,809
that you guys use or experiences from past games that you've drawn on

553
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,071
to kind of make this like seamless movie like experience

554
00:27:01,091 --> 00:27:02,632
where the player still feels involved in it?

555
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:10,864
Yeah, I would say the bridge sequence was one of our big places of innovation in addition to going in and out of interiors, which was one thing.

556
00:27:10,904 --> 00:27:16,465
But as far as like on the sticks, we wanted to have these micro cinematic moments that led into interactivity.

557
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:23,927
And every time you did what we called exotic abilities, let's say like webbing up a bus, you're still using all of your web.

558
00:27:24,327 --> 00:27:25,668
buttons that you would use in gameplay,

559
00:27:25,688 --> 00:27:27,788
we would just make sure we framed the camera in a way

560
00:27:27,828 --> 00:27:29,048
that looked more cinematic.

561
00:27:29,389 --> 00:27:31,009
So whenever we could, we'd make these little

562
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,950
micro cinematic moments that led into an interactive moment.

563
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,091
And we tried to keep the QTE amount down

564
00:27:37,551 --> 00:27:39,371
by making you feel like anything that might've been

565
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:41,532
considered a QTE was not abstract.

566
00:27:41,832 --> 00:27:44,273
It felt connected to the buttons and inputs

567
00:27:44,313 --> 00:27:46,353
that you would be used to in the game.

568
00:27:46,493 --> 00:27:48,054
So the bridge sequence is probably

569
00:27:48,074 --> 00:27:49,714
the best expression of that.

570
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:54,589
I found the questions I was paraphrasing that was half something Liana asked and half something

571
00:27:54,649 --> 00:27:55,890
Thomas asked in chat here.

572
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,230
So credit where credit is due.

573
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:02,193
Just to build on Thomas's a bit more and kind of what you just talked about, what was the

574
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:06,795
key to delivering chasing and escaping experiences so successfully?

575
00:28:06,856 --> 00:28:10,377
Can the same concept slash ideas be applied for less cinematic and more player-controlled

576
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:10,998
experiences?

577
00:28:11,478 --> 00:28:12,379
Yeah, absolutely.

578
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,841
We're always trying to put as much control in the players' hands whenever we possibly

579
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,101
can.

580
00:28:17,121 --> 00:28:20,223
And a lot of it just comes down to how can we bring more.

581
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,922
cinematography into gameplay itself.

582
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:26,184
So I think that's a big push for us going forward,

583
00:28:26,584 --> 00:28:29,266
is continuing to evolve that so we never lose control

584
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:32,729
and try to put all actions in the player's hands,

585
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,851
but still try to find opportunities

586
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:36,272
where we can play with the camera.

587
00:28:37,836 --> 00:28:41,738
Um, you're gonna have to stop me if you're, I don't know how much you can talk about this one.

588
00:28:41,758 --> 00:28:45,520
It's always a great way to start off a question. Um, I guess working with an established IP,

589
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,083
can you talk a bit about kind of being creative in that space when you're working with a character

590
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:54,226
that has so much like history and established lore? Yeah, what's wonderful about Miles is he

591
00:28:54,406 --> 00:28:55,847
has a little under...

592
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:57,659
10 years of lore, right?

593
00:28:57,699 --> 00:28:59,461
So there was a lot of room for us to grow.

594
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:02,263
But as a franchise, Spider-Man has over 60, right?

595
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,445
It has much larger history.

596
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:06,807
But I think what's great about Marvel Games

597
00:29:06,887 --> 00:29:09,329
is they're so willing to work with us as partners

598
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:11,951
to build on the established norms.

599
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:15,274
So you'll see a lot of things that we did in the first game

600
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:16,655
and things we did in the second game that

601
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:17,776
deviate from the comic books.

602
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:21,039
But that's all built on trust and conversations

603
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:21,499
that we have.

604
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:24,031
to say, does this still feel in keeping with the character?

605
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:25,953
And that's what we always have to ask ourselves

606
00:29:25,993 --> 00:29:26,773
when we make a change.

607
00:29:27,574 --> 00:29:31,597
Like the Tinkerer, for instance, being female and younger

608
00:29:31,778 --> 00:29:33,479
and a friend of Miles Morales.

609
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:35,981
That was something that we innovated for this game.

610
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:37,603
And kind of building off of those story beats,

611
00:29:37,623 --> 00:29:39,845
you can subvert expectations in a fun, exciting way

612
00:29:39,885 --> 00:29:41,686
as well, which is always fun to see unfold.

613
00:29:41,706 --> 00:29:42,587
That's the hope, right?

614
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:45,790
We have 24 seconds here, and there's

615
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:46,951
so many more questions in chat.

616
00:29:46,971 --> 00:29:47,631
Oh, I'm sorry.

617
00:29:48,681 --> 00:29:51,123
It's the nature of time. It's unforgiving.

618
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:55,906
So I guess if anyone wants to reach out to you about more kind of like Spider-Man development questions,

619
00:29:55,946 --> 00:29:57,447
can they hit you up on Twitter or email?

620
00:29:57,507 --> 00:30:02,990
Yeah, at Brian Horton Art, you know, hit me up and I'll be happy to answer as many questions as I possibly can.

621
00:30:03,471 --> 00:30:06,793
Awesome. Thank you to everyone in chat for all your wonderful questions.

622
00:30:07,393 --> 00:30:10,035
Thank you for making Spider-Man Morales with the rest of your wonderful,

623
00:30:10,055 --> 00:30:12,216
or Spider-Man Morales with the rest of your wonderful team.

624
00:30:12,897 --> 00:30:14,378
And have a great rest of your showcase, everyone.

625
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:17,752
BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP
