1
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:06,702
Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:06,702 --> 00:00:08,283
My name is Anders Frank.

3
00:00:08,283 --> 00:00:12,544
I'm sitting in a cool room with Zelda in the background.

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:15,125
And I'm going to spend the next 30 minutes

5
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:21,427
to talk about visual attention and getting good at eSports.

6
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:24,689
My talk has a key message, and that

7
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,289
is that visual attention matters.

8
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:30,471
It can support better game performances

9
00:00:30,471 --> 00:00:33,752
as it provides opportunity to see the possibilities

10
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:35,372
of actions in a game environment.

11
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:45,857
And to establish that claim, I would like to introduce a theory from psychology that helps us understand the relationship between gameplay and visual attention.

12
00:00:45,857 --> 00:00:51,519
But I also want to share some kind of work we do in the game League of Legends.

13
00:00:51,519 --> 00:01:02,142
Before heading on on that topic, I would like to introduce, give a little bit background on myself.

14
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:05,043
I've been interested in use cases for

15
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,286
for quite a long time.

16
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:10,887
It started actually in the 90s when I was given the opportunity

17
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:13,349
to head a virtual reality laboratory.

18
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:17,270
Everybody was, of course, technical,

19
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,811
optimistic about technology at that time,

20
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:24,313
and I worked at the VR laboratory for the Swedish military

21
00:01:24,313 --> 00:01:26,234
to try to find use cases

22
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:28,835
and how to use that sort of technology for the Swedish military.

23
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:34,238
Quite interesting head-mounted display, I would say.

24
00:01:34,238 --> 00:01:35,718
In the end of the 90s, it was...

25
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:40,863
The technology was not, or VR was not that trend anymore.

26
00:01:40,863 --> 00:01:45,445
And it became replaced by games and game technology and so on.

27
00:01:45,445 --> 00:01:52,048
So I shifted to look at that one, which was quite nice for me because I love games.

28
00:01:52,048 --> 00:01:58,291
And so we start using the commercial games engines and also

29
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:04,274
commercial games to adapt them to force release military.

30
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:12,114
try to figure out ways to use that technology for other purposes than just combat and violence.

31
00:02:12,114 --> 00:02:19,921
So we did, for instance, a peacekeeping mission trainer called Foreign Ground for the ongoing

32
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:22,483
UN mission in Liberia.

33
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:28,768
And I became so interested in the training aspect of it, so you can actually train by

34
00:02:28,768 --> 00:02:30,409
games and learn from games.

35
00:02:30,982 --> 00:02:38,647
So I shift focus to do that in office training, trying to address that phenomena of wargaming.

36
00:02:38,647 --> 00:02:45,411
Now, one has to imagine, remember that wargaming has been around in cadet and officer training for

37
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:52,816
centuries. But my sort of interest was not only the good side, but also the back side of it,

38
00:02:52,816 --> 00:02:58,540
the bad sides, which actually became the thesis, the topic of my thesis.

39
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:04,328
where I just started to introduce a concept called

40
00:03:04,328 --> 00:03:09,009
gaming mode, which is basically when you play the game

41
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:11,770
and not training for the real stuff.

42
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,590
It is the back side of the gaming

43
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,251
because it becomes so powerful that you actually

44
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:21,412
lose the concept why you play the game.

45
00:03:21,412 --> 00:03:23,792
So that became the topic of my PhD.

46
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:31,013
But since 2017, I'm at Tobii working on other technology.

47
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:32,795
And in this sense, I'm working on eye tracking.

48
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:41,641
And I work as a position as a game experience researcher.

49
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:46,485
And once again, I'm trying to identify the user values.

50
00:03:46,485 --> 00:03:50,988
But now with eye tracking.

51
00:03:51,408 --> 00:03:53,949
And I've been working with many well-known games

52
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:56,851
to influence the games with eye tracking.

53
00:03:56,851 --> 00:04:04,055
For instance, Shadow of the Tomb Raider or The Division,

54
00:04:04,055 --> 00:04:08,177
where we're really trying to define aspects of the game

55
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:12,179
and influence the game with eye tracking, to move the camera,

56
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:16,602
to aim with your eyes, and also to create immersion effects

57
00:04:16,602 --> 00:04:17,582
and lighting and so on.

58
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:24,889
But since a while back, we are more focused on eSports,

59
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,391
which is kind of another aspect of eye tracking

60
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:29,912
because it's analytical use.

61
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:35,255
To use the eye tracking technology to become better.

62
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:37,756
And a couple of years ago,

63
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:42,459
we did a study among professional Dota 2 players.

64
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:46,661
And we interviewed them to try to figure out

65
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,902
what kind of skills are needed to...

66
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:55,771
be good at the game due to two. And the arguments and the logic behind that was if we're going to

67
00:04:55,771 --> 00:05:01,054
introduce eye tracking to support that skill level we need to first of all we need to understand

68
00:05:01,054 --> 00:05:09,338
what kind of skills are needed to play the game to play the game good. So this is all these answers.

69
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,144
interviews was then analyzed and categorized into different groups of skill levels.

70
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:22,048
And we can see in this graph how the different categories are changing over as you move from

71
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:30,434
novices to expert. And the first category is mechanical skills, which is basically

72
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:35,477
learning how to play the game, the moving the camera control and the hitting and the creep control.

73
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:42,781
harass stuff in your bi-deabilities and very mechanical skills, which is a skill level that's

74
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:50,763
quite easily been learned in the beginning, but it's never ever learned, finally learned to the

75
00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:56,245
extent that you don't learn anymore. So the graph of that one moving from novice to expert actually

76
00:05:56,245 --> 00:06:02,927
goes from have a steep learning curve and then plateaus, but it doesn't, it still increases.

77
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,802
The second category of skills is what we can call awareness skills.

78
00:06:10,802 --> 00:06:16,484
And awareness skills is when actually you would like to read the game.

79
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:19,244
If you survive and not being killed all constantly,

80
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:22,185
are you looking at the team positioning yourself

81
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:24,666
and also the opponents and the incoming threat.

82
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,106
You're being aware of what time it is,

83
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:31,368
the time awareness and cool down of your abilities,

84
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:33,568
but also what kind of level the opponents are.

85
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:40,698
And that is a skill that's quite not really introduced and learned when you're a novice.

86
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:49,324
It becomes aware of it, but it is being more associated to intermediate and expert players.

87
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:55,568
And the last category is what we can call higher cognitive skills.

88
00:06:55,568 --> 00:07:01,071
For instance, be able to really, really understand the game in depth to predict what's happening.

89
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:03,092
What are the enemy intentions?

90
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:06,544
What are our current tactics, what to do?

91
00:07:06,544 --> 00:07:09,886
But also on the meta level, what items and abilities

92
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:13,108
or heroes should I choose given the current situation?

93
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:15,870
And that skill is mostly associated

94
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,093
to those players who are really good at the game.

95
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:27,678
So having this graph in the end gave us a rough estimate

96
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:31,560
that having the eyes on the game really

97
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,341
changes.

98
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:37,578
depending on what kind of skills level you're trying to sort of enhance.

99
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:46,243
So the question is then how do players extract meaningful information from the

100
00:07:46,243 --> 00:07:49,604
game? Because it sends it is different

101
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:54,187
meaningful information of tactics that is for actually creep control and

102
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:58,589
the clock and so on. So how does actually visual attention

103
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:00,671
and gaming relate? How can the player extract meaningful

104
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:01,311
information?

105
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:13,155
And one aspect of that one is to introduce the theory of ecological psychology.

106
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:19,017
One of the proponents of those is psychologist James J. Gibson.

107
00:08:19,017 --> 00:08:24,098
He was, he spent his life interested in visual perception.

108
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:29,479
And in his work, he coined the term aphornesis.

109
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:32,800
Which I would spend some time to talk about.

110
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:42,986
A furnaces is the mutual relation between the organism, that is of course humans, and the environment.

111
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:47,307
One needs to keep in mind that the environment contains everything.

112
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:54,289
It is the background, it is the city, it is the forest, it is the objects in the city, it is the humans and the animals, so it's everything.

113
00:08:54,289 --> 00:09:04,012
And all those things exist in relation to each other in a layer structure, which constantly changes as events occur.

114
00:09:05,297 --> 00:09:12,622
Humans, an organism, are actively changing the environment, interacting with it.

115
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:18,246
And the phonosis is actually when the environment, how that offers to humans.

116
00:09:18,246 --> 00:09:23,650
It is the relationship between an agent and the environment.

117
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:28,914
And I will give you a couple of examples here to really simplify what I mean.

118
00:09:28,914 --> 00:09:31,816
If we take an object, as we usually call a chair,

119
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:35,742
it offers most humans a place to sit on.

120
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:43,047
But it doesn't offer that to a very small human, for instance, an infant,

121
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:44,388
who is not able to do that.

122
00:09:44,388 --> 00:09:49,971
Or animals, for that matter, take, for instance, an extreme value as a fish.

123
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:52,193
Fish cannot sit on this one.

124
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:58,577
So we cannot say that this sort of object is something you sit on.

125
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:02,119
It applies to a certain kind of organism or humans.

126
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:10,678
And even if we design and create objects to offer actions to most humans,

127
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:16,081
one must remember this is always relative to an agent.

128
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:22,405
So this scene of the cockpit, as I am, and I'm two meters and four centimeters,

129
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:27,047
offers something else than a place to sit and rest and move around.

130
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:29,789
For me, it's more like it offers torture.

131
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:33,531
I cannot stand sitting in an airplane.

132
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:37,649
That's for sure.

133
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:40,429
Another example is that we have something,

134
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:42,550
an object we can call a hammer,

135
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,371
which has some certain, some kind of qualities to it.

136
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:48,272
It offers something to grasp.

137
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:53,113
It offers, you can hit with it, and you can also throw it.

138
00:10:53,113 --> 00:10:57,334
But that's only relevant for those individuals

139
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:59,575
who can grasp the hammer.

140
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,275
And for instance, humans without arms.

141
00:11:02,922 --> 00:11:12,870
That's not an object that offers the same qualities, properties, as for other humans.

142
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:20,357
And what about learning? Well, part of it is that it is constrained by the physical properties of

143
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:26,142
the agents of ourselves as interacting with the environment. But many of the things can

144
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:30,446
actually be learned. These abilities can be developed.

145
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:40,510
And one would need to keep in mind that the perceiving of affordances or the possibilities of actions are essential for survival.

146
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,951
It is what our perceptual systems have evolved to do.

147
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:56,674
So learning is about differentiating and making finer distinctions about the world to discover new affordances that was previously invisible.

148
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,555
By experience, training.

149
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:07,003
time and explorations. And it usually comes to that extreme when an organism is totally

150
00:12:07,003 --> 00:12:12,985
compatible to an environment. We can call it attuned to the environment. And then in that

151
00:12:12,985 --> 00:12:20,248
sense, the experts become a sea of furnaces that's more or less investable for novices.

152
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:29,232
For instance, if we take this beautiful part of the forest, for me, it's a place that offers

153
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:37,724
walking about and taking a rest and enjoying the smell and sound of it perhaps.

154
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:44,749
My stepmother looking at the same situation or same image will see other, will perceive

155
00:12:44,749 --> 00:12:50,454
other affordances than I am. She will immediately respond to say that

156
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:53,617
this is something where I can pick mushrooms.

157
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:59,490
And she has done that, of course, to make a financial sense and of course,

158
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:09,357
and have experienced similar situations and cultivated her perception to see those furnaces.

159
00:13:09,357 --> 00:13:15,942
And same goes for the sport situations where a good soccer player can see the opportunities,

160
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:23,708
when to pass, when to shoot. She or he are able to read the game. An interesting

161
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:31,452
for us as spectators of the sport is that it's enjoyable to see those really good soccer players in action.

162
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:35,495
If we can see those acting upon their furnaces.

163
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:45,763
Which is kind of interesting because it doesn't only apply to perceiving what to do, it's also performing what to do.

164
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:51,467
Which takes us to the difference between perceiving and acting on our furnaces.

165
00:13:53,305 --> 00:13:56,307
And according to the theory, there is actually no difference.

166
00:13:56,307 --> 00:14:01,489
Seeing and acting on a fornice is deeply intertwined.

167
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:04,090
We act to perceive and we perceive to act.

168
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,291
We move our heads to see better what's going on.

169
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:11,353
And we shuffle off objects to perceive newer fornices.

170
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:15,735
We move a wall to be able to see behind it.

171
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:19,376
We construct rows and level out the environment.

172
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:21,937
We do constant changes to the environment.

173
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:25,663
to pursue new affordances to make a roadway drivable and so on.

174
00:14:25,663 --> 00:14:32,284
And the theory also describes two different kinds of actions to that one.

175
00:14:32,284 --> 00:14:37,525
And the first action aspect is exploratory. And that is the part when you explore the sort of

176
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:45,867
perceived possibilities, gather all the information, what kind of affordances are

177
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:49,028
in the surroundings. And the other one is actually performing it.

178
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:53,380
As I said in the earlier example of the performatory soccer player,

179
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:58,063
he or she is able to see the opportunity but also act on it.

180
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,626
And to give another example for this one,

181
00:15:01,626 --> 00:15:04,448
in the human activity of playfulness in the game world,

182
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:08,150
we have a game of chess. A game of chess is a game that's

183
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,712
more or less designed around exploratory function.

184
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:16,235
Performing the moves that is changing the chess pieces,

185
00:15:16,235 --> 00:15:18,357
the rotation of the chess pieces,

186
00:15:18,814 --> 00:15:20,576
is more or less trivial.

187
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:22,998
But what to change is on seed opportunities.

188
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:23,899
It's the hard stuff.

189
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:27,162
In the other end of the spectrum,

190
00:15:27,162 --> 00:15:29,484
we have a tracking field, for instance,

191
00:15:29,484 --> 00:15:33,107
100 meter dash relay, which is kind of a trivial way

192
00:15:33,107 --> 00:15:33,968
to understand what to do.

193
00:15:33,968 --> 00:15:36,451
You just run in a straight line for 100 meters.

194
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:39,493
But it's super hard to actually perform that in a good way.

195
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:43,497
And if we go through the video games.

196
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:50,451
For instance, Counter Strike, that's something that's always, usually falls in between.

197
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:55,495
You not only need to move around to see the opportunities of what to do and so on,

198
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:57,777
you also need to perform quite well.

199
00:15:57,777 --> 00:15:59,619
So when you get an opportunity for a shot,

200
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:04,443
you need to really be fast enough and do it really quickly.

201
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:09,947
So most games have those kind of two aspects of actions already designed in them,

202
00:16:09,947 --> 00:16:13,110
to play the game.

203
00:16:13,948 --> 00:16:20,471
So now I'm going to show you a video from an influencer called VackyJacky

204
00:16:20,471 --> 00:16:26,954
so when he explains how to play PUBG. We will see he's just night tracking in

205
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:32,017
this video so we can see the bubble moving around where he's looking at

206
00:16:32,017 --> 00:16:36,299
and he will use show us how how a technique to spot the enemy.

207
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:46,873
And as you will see in the video, he will constantly move to be able to perceive the opponents,

208
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:52,596
but we also will see that he's quite effective at performing and realizing their forces when he gets the kills,

209
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:53,256
the opportunity for kills, I would say.

210
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:55,077
Let's see if I can get it off here.

211
00:16:55,077 --> 00:17:04,500
Welcome guys!

212
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:10,724
I've said it before, being good at spotting enemies is the single most important skill to have in PUBG.

213
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:12,905
The reasons are obvious.

214
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:18,806
Spotting your enemies before they spot you, allow you to move in open areas with low risk.

215
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:26,708
Allow you to take the first shot in a gunfight, or let you decide if it's better to avoid confrontation when executing stealth tactics.

216
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:35,868
The art of spotting enemies lies mainly in the way you use your eyes,

217
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:39,250
where you focus and how you scan your surroundings.

218
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:44,053
I illustrated this manually in my old spotting video, but now thanks to my sponsor,

219
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:49,496
Tobii Gaming, I am able to show you this using Tobii eye tracking technology.

220
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:52,218
What you will see here is as real as it gets,

221
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:57,100
as I have been able to record exactly where I look during gameplay.

222
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,022
The content of this video is scan types,

223
00:18:00,477 --> 00:18:04,279
focus resource management and detecting movement.

224
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:05,300
The first scan type is the horizontal scan.

225
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:13,827
The horizontal scan is by far the most important way to spot enemies when running in the open.

226
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:20,151
My most frequently used strategy is to stay completely away from vehicles and instead

227
00:18:20,151 --> 00:18:23,073
simply move out directly in the open.

228
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:27,757
The reason I feel comfortable doing this is because of the effectiveness of horizontal

229
00:18:27,757 --> 00:18:28,217
scanning.

230
00:18:29,928 --> 00:18:38,413
Horizontal scanning is a method you want to use when you want to be able to consume as much visual information at the fastest possible rate,

231
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:48,520
which is also super useful when holding a position or trying to identify the location of an enemy while looking in the direction you just heard him fire a shot in.

232
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:57,346
Horizontal scanning should be used when an enemy would naturally stand out in relation to his surroundings by contrast alone.

233
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:59,107
Using the Tobii Eye Tracker 4C

234
00:18:59,674 --> 00:19:07,219
I was able to record this heatmap of my focus which is really cool because you can clearly

235
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:17,346
see in which areas of the screen I look the most.

236
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:18,686
Take a moment to study this recording.

237
00:19:18,686 --> 00:19:23,409
And as I said earlier, the horizontal scan that WackyJackie goes through, and there are

238
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:28,473
more examples in the video, I don't have time to show it, is a technique to really see the

239
00:19:28,473 --> 00:19:29,313
affordances.

240
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:34,255
Horizontal scan is not the furnace itself. It's actually what's it's a technique to discover their furnaces

241
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:42,542
And since battle royale is more or less a game, but if you see an enemy if you see a moving

242
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:46,946
Avatar is is the enemy could be the team of course, but but it's mostly the case. It is

243
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:55,072
Survival game so it's mostly enemy. So there are certain techniques to really discover those furnaces when it comes in sight

244
00:19:55,072 --> 00:19:56,453
hit the enemy

245
00:19:56,453 --> 00:19:57,314
um, so

246
00:19:58,095 --> 00:20:03,559
So horizontal scan is a technique to discover the affordances.

247
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:08,342
Which comes up to the summing up to the psychology in gaming.

248
00:20:08,342 --> 00:20:13,365
And I borrowed this quote from Jonas Lindroth who wrote in his paper that

249
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:17,607
gameplay is to perceive and act on and transform the affordances that are

250
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:22,971
related to a game system or other players in the game.

251
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:27,233
And in this sense it's interesting because it's a definition of

252
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:34,576
gameplay and gaming with this theory in mind that doesn't actually care of what form it is being

253
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:41,498
played in. It could be board games, it could be video games, and it can even include sports,

254
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:51,641
which is funny because there's given the current debate about whether esports is a real sport or not.

255
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:51,821
So

256
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,652
What about visual attention and how to improve that skill?

257
00:20:56,652 --> 00:21:01,053
Can we support the visual attention, the ability to

258
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:07,494
to attend to your visual perception? Yes we can and we have started this one

259
00:21:07,494 --> 00:21:11,875
this journey. We can provide metrics, we can track

260
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:17,336
the visual attention in some aspect and by having metrics we can explain to

261
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:17,997
players

262
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:24,990
how the strengths and weaknesses of their ability to take advantage of the information richness of

263
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:34,978
the game environment. And TwoBear has together with Mobalytics created a visual attention

264
00:21:34,978 --> 00:21:41,183
metrics in the sort of companion apps that's being developed by Mobalytics.

265
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:44,584
And that companion map, game performance index,

266
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:49,707
contains many, many aspects of playing League of Legends.

267
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:51,868
Now we are precisely, right now,

268
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:54,989
we are introducing visual attention to an eye tracking

269
00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:57,070
to that sort of metric, existing metrics.

270
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,492
But the key challenge is to transform eye tracking data

271
00:22:01,492 --> 00:22:04,754
into meaningful and game-specific metrics.

272
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:12,364
And last year we spent some serious time to create kind of an understanding of that field. So we

273
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:19,870
collect gaze data from a vast amount of different players from different ranks and analyze that

274
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,533
together to get some kind of a counter-factualizations of what's going on. So it became

275
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:32,839
meaningful and from that we obtained the five metrics. And those five metrics are first of all

276
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,761
the Meaning Map Awareness.

277
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:41,544
That's the frequency you look at the minimap and how much time you spend on that minimap.

278
00:22:41,544 --> 00:22:44,505
The second one is tunnel vision.

279
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:50,088
Tunnel vision is a bad aspect of it because you're focused on a specific region and you're

280
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:54,150
sort of zoning out on something, you're neglecting other parts of the game.

281
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,131
So it's a metric that tells you how often you do that.

282
00:22:57,131 --> 00:23:03,855
Information processing indicates how much rapidly you can process information.

283
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:08,221
which is kind of the average fixation as calculated,

284
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:12,002
because it is really associated to professional performance

285
00:23:12,002 --> 00:23:16,504
if you are processing information quite rapidly.

286
00:23:16,504 --> 00:23:20,185
And to those who is really aware about the theory,

287
00:23:20,185 --> 00:23:22,326
he will say that, well, wait a minute,

288
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:26,988
information processing is not compatible to the theory

289
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,148
of ecological psychology.

290
00:23:28,148 --> 00:23:29,109
Well, I can come to that.

291
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:31,030
I know, I know, I know.

292
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,224
The fourth aspect concerns fight preparation.

293
00:23:36,224 --> 00:23:41,930
It is a measurement how aware you are with the surroundings before you enter a fight.

294
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:47,976
Look at the minimap, look at the surroundings, your abilities and so on before entering a fight.

295
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:51,340
And pick awareness is that you are...

296
00:23:52,642 --> 00:24:06,668
When you're getting picked off, it's usually because of you don't pay attention to the surrounding so we can measure how if that happens and if you are paying attention to the game.

297
00:24:06,668 --> 00:24:11,391
I would like to show you an example from a video.

298
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:13,252
I'm going to hide my screen over here.

299
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:20,975
And this is an image of, oh sorry, a video of a player who plays Twisted Fate and he plays mid lane.

300
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:26,443
and he's about to get his ultimate and before he gets an ultimate he

301
00:24:26,443 --> 00:24:30,005
scans and see that opportunity in the bot lane

302
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:34,547
and we will see in the video how often he checks the bot lane what's going on

303
00:24:34,547 --> 00:24:40,770
and so on and immediately he's got the ability for the ultimate he will go

304
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,952
there so he's and also looking if he's in the right

305
00:24:42,952 --> 00:24:45,233
moment so let's see the video

306
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:49,235
it's without sound

307
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:57,399
And the red rectangle over there is actually the measurement of the fixations of the eyes.

308
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:05,104
So it's actually a way we can quite easily see when the eyes are on the minimap.

309
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:11,708
And we should perhaps take that again, because now it's over more or less.

310
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:18,392
So what's happening in the beginning here is that he is, he or she actually, is playing the game and

311
00:25:19,068 --> 00:25:26,493
constantly looking at the bot lane over there, making a fixation, makes a fixation, and soon

312
00:25:26,493 --> 00:25:34,178
he will get his ultimate. Bam, bam, check it out, there it goes, and decides where to go, bam.

313
00:25:34,178 --> 00:25:42,124
So he constantly checks if it's the right, and preparing to do that before he actually enters

314
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:42,644
the fight.

315
00:25:51,162 --> 00:25:53,604
What are the benefits for this kind of system?

316
00:25:53,604 --> 00:25:59,969
Well, first of all, we have the ability to track how players gather information

317
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:04,132
and seek a furnaces with the eye tracker and storing of the gaze data.

318
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:09,897
And by that we can analyze that and provide feedback to the players

319
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:14,040
and tell how to improve their information gathering skills

320
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,041
and through the metrics.

321
00:26:16,483 --> 00:26:23,625
and then we lay the foundation for players to make use of what they see to improve their decision making.

322
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:27,686
If James Gibson would be around, he would say that, well you know what,

323
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,467
players are supported in the quest to discover affordances.

324
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:32,907
He wouldn't use that kind of a thing of decision making.

325
00:26:32,907 --> 00:26:38,509
He would say that players are supported in the quest to discover affordances.

326
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:40,269
Which is kind of neat.

327
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:46,310
However, the metrics support discovery of their affordances.

328
00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:51,880
The metrics is not the affordances by themselves.

329
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:57,321
At the same time as the horizontal scan is not affordances by itself.

330
00:26:57,321 --> 00:26:59,282
It's a technique to discover their affordances.

331
00:26:59,282 --> 00:27:03,103
So the metrics tell us what part of the screens you're looking at,

332
00:27:03,103 --> 00:27:06,123
not on what items specifically.

333
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:09,704
And to understand, to really understand what you're looking at,

334
00:27:09,704 --> 00:27:13,505
you need to understand, you need to experience and training to,

335
00:27:13,505 --> 00:27:15,065
as I said earlier, earlier.

336
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:20,966
For instance, if you have a situation on a minimap,

337
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:24,669
is that a threat or is that an opportunity?

338
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:24,969
That depends.

339
00:27:24,969 --> 00:27:26,790
Depends on the skill level.

340
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,953
It also depends what was happening, of course.

341
00:27:29,953 --> 00:27:38,039
To really unlock the potential for this one,

342
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:41,201
I encourage people to take on the journey

343
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,683
to develop future companion apps.

344
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:50,612
that will assist in perceiving and acting on more affordances, which is tailored on player skill

345
00:27:50,612 --> 00:28:00,882
level. For instance, scanning. We can, if we have an affordances system live in the game app, we can

346
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:05,747
see, we can measure how often you were killed by an opponent that you didn't spot before.

347
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:18,529
And if that's live and that can be measured, we can have, we can introduce ideas that you need to change the ways you scan your horizon, actually scan the game.

348
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:27,695
Or we can make predictions of Fortis' encouragement. For instance, if things are building up to become a threat.

349
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:31,910
and to be able to detect if the players actually see those things

350
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,191
and or highlight that something's going on and so on

351
00:28:36,191 --> 00:28:40,051
to really nurture and train the players to perceive those kind of

352
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:44,632
performances when the situation builds up. And the same goes for planning to

353
00:28:44,632 --> 00:28:49,613
avoid taking risky actions for instance roaming around in League of Legends

354
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:52,494
when you are quite uncertain or unaware.

355
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:58,732
If that could be measured live, that could actually encourage you to change your behavior.

356
00:28:58,732 --> 00:29:05,214
As having this instructor behind them saying, well, what are you doing? What are you doing?

357
00:29:05,214 --> 00:29:09,556
But for you to realize that, of course, we need some kind of advanced systems. We need

358
00:29:09,556 --> 00:29:14,998
machine learning and computer vision, or preferably we can integrate this kind of

359
00:29:14,998 --> 00:29:20,740
a training matrix, analytical metrics, in the game itself. So it's encouraged that.

360
00:29:21,254 --> 00:29:31,219
because then we can make use of the full API to really make sense of what's going on in the contextual situation of the game.

361
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:36,681
To sum this presentation up a little bit, I first introduced the Gibson ideas on affordances,

362
00:29:36,681 --> 00:29:45,345
which provides quite valuable insights how visual attention relates to successful game performances.

363
00:29:46,135 --> 00:29:50,078
The theory itself combines the exploration phase,

364
00:29:50,078 --> 00:29:52,999
I mean, the ability to see what opportunities are

365
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,900
laid before us in the environment,

366
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,902
and acting on it, the performatory aspect of it,

367
00:29:57,902 --> 00:29:59,022
in an interesting way.

368
00:29:59,022 --> 00:30:03,885
And player discovery and acting upon those affordances

369
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:09,068
are essential to improve in the game performances,

370
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:12,310
not only seeing what to do, but also doing it.

371
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:19,934
And by tracking visual attention, we can support this discovery.

372
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:20,554
For instance, with eye tracking.

373
00:30:20,554 --> 00:30:21,795
And the journey has just begun.

374
00:30:21,795 --> 00:30:30,301
I encourage all of you to pick a game and let's get started because there's so much work to do.

375
00:30:30,301 --> 00:30:38,967
And by that, I would like to say thanks for listening to this presentation.

376
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:43,531
Hope you learned something about that and adios, hej då.

377
00:30:44,145 --> 00:30:48,103
and I hope to see you at the next GDC.

378
00:30:48,103 --> 00:30:48,324
Bye!
