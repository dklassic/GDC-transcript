00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:10,393
Hi there. I'm Hannah McLeod, and I'm a narrative designer at Crystal Dynamics,

2
00:00:10,393 --> 00:00:14,836
and one of the writers on Marvel's Avengers. This is Getting the Most out of an Entry-Level

3
00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:18,759
Games job, and I thought the most appropriate way to get started would be to talk a little

4
00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:25,965
bit about my first job in the games industry. My first job was at Telltale Games, working on

5
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:31,029
The Walking Dead A New Frontier, aka Season 3, and Minecraft Story Mode Season 2.

6
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:38,911
My job title was Creative Development Assistant, or CDA for short. And if you have no idea what

7
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:44,274
that title means, you're not alone. Most people at Telltale didn't know either.

8
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:50,017
There were four of us. One CDA per project. And our primary duties involved taking court

9
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:56,981
reporter-style notes in meetings and exporting voiceover scripts for recording sessions.

10
00:00:56,981 --> 00:01:00,783
I loved my job. But the reality of it could be a little jarring.

11
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,591
We didn't have a manager.

12
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:07,612
Well, we had a manager the first couple months at my job,

13
00:01:07,612 --> 00:01:10,113
and then she got promoted and moved apartments,

14
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:12,654
and they never replaced her.

15
00:01:12,654 --> 00:01:14,374
We didn't have a promotion ladder.

16
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:18,536
We had two CDAs, former CDAs, who'd

17
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:22,697
moved into narrative design and audio design, respectively,

18
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:24,718
but no clear idea how they did it

19
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,598
and if that method would even work for us.

20
00:01:28,136 --> 00:01:31,157
We didn't even really have a department.

21
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:34,398
We, well, our time card said we were in production,

22
00:01:34,398 --> 00:01:37,900
but we could answer to creative, audio,

23
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,341
and it could change by the day, by the hour.

24
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:43,442
We didn't really have a lot of training.

25
00:01:43,442 --> 00:01:46,663
Our training involved shadowing a CDA for a couple of weeks

26
00:01:46,663 --> 00:01:48,624
before getting dropped in the deep end

27
00:01:48,624 --> 00:01:50,004
of our own solo project.

28
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:56,616
Despite, or I guess because of all of this, by the end of my tenure at Telltale,

29
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:00,726
I was accredited writer on the last three episodes of Minecraft Story Mode Season 2.

30
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,161
That's me.

31
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:08,683
And from talking to other developers, I've realized I'm not special.

32
00:02:08,683 --> 00:02:14,105
Entry level positions in the games industry are rare.

33
00:02:14,105 --> 00:02:18,167
Even mine was phased out before the studio closed in 2018.

34
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:19,848
So you kind of have to take what you can get.

35
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,350
And it's not always the exact job you want.

36
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,170
Beggars can't be choosers.

37
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,712
And I don't think I can change the entire industry with one talks.

38
00:02:28,712 --> 00:02:31,273
Especially their approach to entry level positions.

39
00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:37,435
But I decided I'm going to try to give you a toolbox of sorts to get through this chaotic,

40
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:43,396
often nebulous time in your game development career. A couple of caveats before we start,

41
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:49,317
though. The studio I worked at no longer exists, which is why I can be pretty explicit with my job

42
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:55,399
duties and examples of the things that I did. Not everyone has that opportunity. And, well,

43
00:02:55,399 --> 00:03:00,560
we're in an NDA world. So, I don't begrudge anyone not sharing more details about their

44
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,200
first job.

45
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:07,446
I also work in narrative, so most of my examples are going to be narrative-based, but the advice

46
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:11,229
is meant to be as department-agnostic as possible.

47
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,331
I also know that a lot of people, including myself, are still working remotely and maybe

48
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:18,452
working remotely permanently.

49
00:03:18,452 --> 00:03:24,793
So I try to make the advice work if you're in a remote position or if you're in the office.

50
00:03:24,793 --> 00:03:29,475
So your mileage may vary, but I'm hoping by the end of this talk that you'll have at least

51
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:34,936
one thing you can try to get yourself noticed, which is the goal, by the way.

52
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:36,396
It's to get noticed in your first job.

53
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:39,457
You succeed in this industry by building connections.

54
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:45,819
Games are beautifully collaborative and notoriously unreliable. And the reason I

55
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:52,441
can even be here today is because people noticed me and helped me forward. Yes,

56
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:56,843
you also need to hone your skills and work hard and make a great game.

57
00:03:56,843 --> 00:04:00,904
But I would be nowhere without all of the people that I did those things with.

58
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:09,641
In fact, even if you only get noticed by one person in your first job, that's a success.

59
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:17,686
Congratulations. You've started building your network. And one last caveat. Do not do all of

60
00:04:17,686 --> 00:04:25,570
the things that I suggest in this talk at once for one job. I try to. And I don't recommend it.

61
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,892
And I'll get into that a little bit more at the end.

62
00:04:31,847 --> 00:04:38,772
So the first piece of advice that I ever received was from Steve McManus, who was a designer who sat

63
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:45,157
next to me at the open office at Telltale. He doesn't remember this, but a couple of weeks

64
00:04:45,157 --> 00:04:50,821
into my first job, he leaned over and suggested that I take my headphones off sometimes.

65
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:54,885
Now, if you've ever worked in an open office, you know headphones are kind of necessary to get

66
00:04:55,722 --> 00:05:01,305
any work done. But what he meant was, if I listen to the studio around me, I might learn

67
00:05:01,305 --> 00:05:07,468
some things. And he was completely right. So right that I kind of use listening as core

68
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:13,771
to all the rest of my advice in this talk. It's kind of your secret... It's kind of your

69
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:18,654
super secret weapon that you can always fall back on when you're feeling overwhelmed or

70
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:21,576
you're not sure what you should be doing. So...

71
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:30,597
remotely listening looks a little different. It could mean following a Slack channel,

72
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:37,560
even if you're not 100% sure it applies to you, or listening to the chit chat before and after

73
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,542
a Zoom meeting, not just the meeting itself. Or it could even mean following an email thread

74
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,062
as someone

75
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:49,386
some team bats a proposal back and forth. So it's probably better to say, if you're remote,

76
00:05:49,386 --> 00:05:56,832
to keep your headphones on sometimes. Okay. So you have your super secret weapon. It's harder

77
00:05:56,832 --> 00:06:02,757
to say than I thought. Now it's time to talk about who you want to get noticed by in your first job.

78
00:06:02,757 --> 00:06:06,480
We're going to start really, really easy. Your manager.

79
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:13,318
I know, I know. I just said I didn't have one in my first job and that's true. But I have one now

80
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:18,841
and she's great. Hi, Nicole. And if you are lucky enough to have a manager in your first job,

81
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:24,443
you got to use it. So if you don't know what a manager does, it's their job to kind of keep

82
00:06:24,443 --> 00:06:29,185
track of how well you're doing in your job. They will give you performance reviews if your studio

83
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:33,988
has formal ones. And they're kind of your gatekeeper to any promotions that you might get.

84
00:06:35,048 --> 00:06:39,171
It's also their job to kind of gather feedback from your other teammates to see how well

85
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:42,773
they like working with you and if they have any ways you could improve.

86
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:47,256
Which is great because it avoids the awkward situation of having to ask people directly

87
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:48,456
for that kind of feedback.

88
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:55,741
The reason that it is so easy to get noticed by your manager is because it's literally

89
00:06:55,741 --> 00:07:00,023
their job to notice you and advocate for you in the studio.

90
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:02,204
Now, not all managers are created equal.

91
00:07:03,134 --> 00:07:07,018
Some are more invested than others, but you're only really going to get as much from your

92
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:12,062
manager relationship as you put into it. So the first way to get noticed by your manager is to

93
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:18,008
tell them your career goals right from the start. I was clear in my interview for the CDA job that

94
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:22,972
I wanted to be a game writer. I submitted writing samples with my resume and it just so happened

95
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:26,655
that my temporary manager was one of the people interviewing me. So

96
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:31,079
She also spread the word about my career goals,

97
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:33,440
so that when I started on my first solo project,

98
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,041
which was Minecraft Story Mode Season 2,

99
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,723
the team already knew going in

100
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,884
that that was something I wanted to do.

101
00:07:39,983 --> 00:07:46,790
And I am a woman in game development. So I know there is this hesitancy to not come across too

102
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:52,015
ambitious in our work. But I want to nip that in the bud right now. No one expects an entry-level

103
00:07:52,015 --> 00:07:59,302
employee wants to be in that role forever. So sharing your ambitions is one step closer to

104
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:02,085
making them a reality. So be ambitious.

105
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:07,770
The other way to get noticed by your manager is to schedule weekly one-on-ones.

106
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,673
So your manager is also a game developer, which means they're super busy.

107
00:08:12,673 --> 00:08:17,496
And they're even more so if they have to manage more people than just you.

108
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:20,477
So you want to try to stay on their radar as much as possible.

109
00:08:20,477 --> 00:08:28,002
These one-on-ones can be short check-ins or long vent sessions, depending on your relationship.

110
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:37,726
But it's supposed to be for talking about how the job is going and if you're having any issues that you need feedback or advice on

111
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:42,768
And any feedback they might have for you on how you could do better. If you're remote

112
00:08:42,768 --> 00:08:48,111
I really suggest that you check in with your manager more often than just once a week

113
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:53,833
Right now I work from home. So my manager and I are kind of in constant contact over Slack that way we can

114
00:08:54,594 --> 00:08:58,877
raise any issues that we're having as quickly as possible and we don't have to wait until

115
00:08:58,877 --> 00:09:04,181
the next check-in. There's this kind of out of sight, out of mind mentality if you don't do that.

116
00:09:04,181 --> 00:09:09,566
It's also fine to skip these one-on-ones occasionally if you don't have anything

117
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:14,590
to talk about that week, but I highly recommend you keep them on the calendar so that your manager

118
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,253
can see the notification and go, oh yeah, that person is here and they're doing well.

119
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:26,037
If you don't have a manager or your manager isn't as invested as you'd like them to be,

120
00:09:26,037 --> 00:09:30,140
the next easiest person to get the attention of is the person you report to.

121
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,984
So sometimes that is your manager, but for a lot of people, it's a different person.

122
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:40,949
In fact, I gave a survey to some of my fellow game writers and I asked them what they wish

123
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:43,992
they would have known before their first job in the industry.

124
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:48,555
And a surprisingly large amount of people wish they'd known who they were supposed to

125
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:48,996
report to.

126
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:53,942
So some advice on figuring out who this person is.

127
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:55,163
Ask during your interview.

128
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:57,684
It's actually a really great question to ask early

129
00:09:57,684 --> 00:10:00,706
because it can give you an idea of what the position is for

130
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:02,827
based on who it reports to.

131
00:10:02,827 --> 00:10:04,347
And if the person you report to

132
00:10:04,347 --> 00:10:05,908
happens to be in your interview,

133
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:08,009
it gives you the chance to sort of

134
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:09,870
ask about their leadership style

135
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,491
and the day-to-day task load.

136
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:17,996
If you miss the chance to ask during your interview, ask during orientation because

137
00:10:17,996 --> 00:10:23,382
the last thing you want is to be dropped off at your desk or dropped off of a Zoom call

138
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:27,506
and not know who you're supposed to be talking to or what you're supposed to be doing.

139
00:10:28,568 --> 00:10:31,049
The person you receive your day-to-day tasks from

140
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:32,089
is the person you report to.

141
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,109
They're also the person that you show your work

142
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:35,990
to to receive feedback.

143
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,370
Also, this person can change.

144
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,570
Unlike your manager, which tends to be pretty stable

145
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,611
if you have one, the person you report to

146
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:44,931
can change depending on the project you're on,

147
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:48,152
what part of the production process you're in.

148
00:10:48,152 --> 00:10:50,652
For me, when I first started, the person I reported to

149
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:52,953
was a fellow CDA who was training me.

150
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,653
So I would report to him, and then he

151
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:57,793
would divvy up his own tasks between us.

152
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:02,536
When I got assigned to Minecraft Story Mode, it was still a pretty small team, so I answered

153
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:07,018
directly to the lead writer, and he would have me do research and that sort of thing.

154
00:11:07,018 --> 00:11:11,240
As we got well into production, I answered to the creative producer, who was in charge

155
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,362
of scheduling and meetings and all of that stuff.

156
00:11:14,362 --> 00:11:17,864
And then as we got to recording, because I was the one exporting the voiceover scripts,

157
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:21,546
I would report to the voice director, and then would make sure that the VO was all getting

158
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:24,568
in where it needed to be in the game.

159
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:33,142
The way to get the person you report to to notice you.

160
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:35,203
At first, it looks a lot like your manager.

161
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:36,804
You want to tell them your career goals,

162
00:11:36,804 --> 00:11:38,285
but for a slightly different reason.

163
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:40,747
The person you report to controls your tasks.

164
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:42,389
So if they know your career goals,

165
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:44,050
they can start tailoring those tasks

166
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,071
to help you achieve those goals.

167
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:49,554
They can also give you FaceTime with the departments

168
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:51,675
you might want to join if you're not in the department

169
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:52,876
that you want to be right now.

170
00:11:53,577 --> 00:11:58,918
And they can also volunteer you for tasks when you're too shy to, or maybe you aren't

171
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,298
there when the task comes up.

172
00:12:00,298 --> 00:12:04,399
In fact, the person who reports you can end up being your biggest advocate for increased

173
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,960
responsibilities and promotions because they see you every day.

174
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,560
You can also schedule one-on-one meetings with them if you want.

175
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,421
It's slightly less necessary because you're seeing them all the time.

176
00:12:14,421 --> 00:12:17,962
But if you feel like the person you report to could be doing more to help you with your

177
00:12:17,962 --> 00:12:20,082
career advancement, then absolutely set those up.

178
00:12:20,712 --> 00:12:25,614
But the best method to get the attention of the person you report to is actually to report

179
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:26,314
to them.

180
00:12:26,314 --> 00:12:29,675
When you're out of tasks and not sure what you should be doing, go ask the person you

181
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:31,916
report to if there's anything you can do to help.

182
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,717
It shows initiative and that you can be depended on.

183
00:12:34,717 --> 00:12:38,258
And they might even give you tasks that they were thinking of doing themselves until they

184
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,459
realized you were free.

185
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,160
At Telltale, I really enjoyed the fact that I had multiple people to report to because

186
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,162
it meant if one person didn't have any tasks for me, I could go to somebody else.

187
00:12:50,943 --> 00:12:56,246
The other way to get the attention of the person you report to is to employ our super

188
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:59,048
secret weapon, listening.

189
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:03,270
So when someone comes up to the person you report to and asks them for something, is

190
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,412
it ever a task that you think you might be able to handle?

191
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:09,174
Is there anything that's on their plate that you could take off their plate?

192
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:16,876
For example, my creative producer was often asked for collated data of our voiceover process.

193
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:23,058
So like, how many lines did we record for the last episode? What is the line count for this character?

194
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:28,299
I knew that information was easy if slightly tedious to find, so I volunteered to do it.

195
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:31,860
And then I put it together in a living document that I could update so that

196
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,061
everyone who checked it had the most recent information.

197
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,745
Our writers were often asked for Minecraft driven solutions to creative problems.

198
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:46,429
So, it was a little hard for them to come like have an encyclopedic knowledge of Minecraft.

199
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:50,312
So, I would volunteer to research things. Like if they needed a block that had certain

200
00:13:50,312 --> 00:13:57,158
characteristics, I would volunteer to research that for them. The upside of listening into what

201
00:13:57,158 --> 00:14:02,682
the person you report to is being asked to do is it means you don't have to be caught up on tasks.

202
00:14:02,682 --> 00:14:04,103
You are already up to speed.

203
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:07,392
I get a lot of compliments for this even now.

204
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:09,312
Basically, every time someone comes up

205
00:14:09,312 --> 00:14:10,373
to the person I report to,

206
00:14:10,373 --> 00:14:12,393
I would take one headphone off and listen in

207
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,334
just in case an action came out of it and I could help.

208
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:20,276
It also helps, the game of telephone that sometimes occurs

209
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,617
when a task is getting to you can confuse

210
00:14:22,617 --> 00:14:24,358
like who asked for the task,

211
00:14:24,358 --> 00:14:26,418
what problem it was trying to solve,

212
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:28,919
what exactly they want from you.

213
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,280
So it's sometimes better to just hear it directly

214
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,020
from the source.

215
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:39,449
If you're not sitting near the person you report to, it's probably good to ask if you can be moved.

216
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:43,931
If you can't or if you're remote, then you just need to be a little extra vigilant.

217
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:49,713
So if you see that someone asks in an email for something from the person you report to,

218
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:53,454
maybe it's worth following up on that. Or if they're tagged in Slack.

219
00:14:53,454 --> 00:14:57,396
Or my manager, who's also the person I report to right now,

220
00:14:57,776 --> 00:15:02,679
I have her JIRA tasks up on a board so that when someone sends something to her, I can see if it's

221
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:07,663
something that I could take off her hands. The more of these kinds of tasks you complete,

222
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:10,625
the more you'll get and the more positive attention you'll receive.

223
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:17,056
In fact, these kinds of volunteer opportunities are sort of the first big steps I took towards

224
00:15:17,056 --> 00:15:19,338
becoming a game writer on Minecraft Story Mode.

225
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:24,701
So for example, our lead writer was asked to create the quiz at the beginning of Season

226
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:29,804
2 that lets you do all the big choices from Season 1 without having to actually play Season 1.

227
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:34,026
And I volunteered to do it because I was familiar with Season 1.

228
00:15:34,026 --> 00:15:36,207
And that ended up being my first writing in the game.

229
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:46,754
Another episode writer was introducing a bunch of new characters in her episode and asked me to join her doing...

230
00:15:46,754 --> 00:15:49,715
She had to create a bunch of casting sheets.

231
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:54,778
They're like bios and descriptions and personality for the character to help us cast them.

232
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,562
and I volunteered to split the workload because there were a lot of them. And because I'd done

233
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:04,306
the casting sheets for those particular characters, she then asked me to do the

234
00:16:04,306 --> 00:16:09,230
scenes that introduced those characters because I was so familiar with them.

235
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,573
We also had a creative team member in every voiceover session listening in on Skype so

236
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,996
they could provide context to the voice director and the actor.

237
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:23,478
And these were lengthy four-hour sessions, so the creative team often didn't have time

238
00:16:23,478 --> 00:16:26,158
to be there the whole time, so I would volunteer.

239
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:30,800
And it let me kind of show off my knowledge of the story and show I could do lengthy tasks

240
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,320
without someone looking over my shoulder.

241
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,400
Okay.

242
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:32,620
That was a lot.

243
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:43,231
a breath. Before you freak out about not knowing how to do any of these things or thinking that

244
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:48,575
you'd never have enough knowledge to volunteer for something, let's talk about what you should

245
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:54,419
be doing when you have nothing to do. You've asked the person you report to or your manager or both

246
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:59,223
if there's anything you can help with and there really isn't. So you've got nothing to do but

247
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:01,084
you're trying to get noticed.

248
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:14,573
It this alone time is rare. So it's really a good time to take advantage of it to build your knowledge, because the more knowledge you have, the more confidence you'll have to volunteer for things in the future.

249
00:17:14,573 --> 00:17:18,655
So, when you're asking yourself, what should I be doing right now.

250
00:17:18,655 --> 00:17:20,716
Let's start simple.

251
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:28,305
play the game. Seriously. You may think that's kind of obvious, but most of your co-workers

252
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:31,988
are not going to have a lot of time to play the game in its entirety. Like, they'll play

253
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:36,191
the level that they're working on over and over and over again, but it's probably been a while

254
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:41,135
since they've played it from beginning to end. And you have no idea how much confidence you get

255
00:17:41,135 --> 00:17:44,718
if you're the only person in a room who can answer a question about the game as a whole,

256
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:47,820
because everybody else is so focused on one small part.

257
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,602
If there's no game to play or no build that's working, try looking for documents.

258
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:57,983
So pitch decks are a great buzzwordy way to get an overview of what the game is supposed

259
00:17:57,983 --> 00:17:58,723
to be.

260
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:03,665
There's also design documents which can give you overviews of the gameplay or animatics

261
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:07,786
of the storyboards or even a script of all the cinematic moments.

262
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:13,335
The idea is you're trying to get the big picture of a project because a lot of your co-workers

263
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:17,982
will be pretty focused on their individual parts and won't have that same viewpoint.

264
00:18:17,982 --> 00:18:21,488
So that can give you something of value to contribute to a conversation.

265
00:18:22,414 --> 00:18:28,057
If your game is a sequel or prequel or spin-off, it's time to get familiar with those other games.

266
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:33,901
Some people, they don't have a lot of time to play a lot of different games,

267
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:41,825
so I would still recommend looking at a playthrough or reading summaries or looking at wikis.

268
00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:46,268
Your co-workers have probably already done this too, but it's probably been a while,

269
00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:48,209
so the details will be more fresh for you.

270
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:54,597
It's also good to consider why changes were made from these other games to the one you're

271
00:18:54,597 --> 00:18:55,558
working on now.

272
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:59,240
It's also a good way to break the ice with your coworkers if you could ask them, like,

273
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,781
why was this particular change made?

274
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:04,163
Minecraft Story Mode Season 2 was obviously a sequel.

275
00:19:04,163 --> 00:19:08,605
So I played Season 1, and that was why I had the confidence to volunteer for that quiz

276
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:13,088
job, because I knew the details more in my head than the writer did.

277
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:24,258
The next thing you can do is use your superpower to listen in to what games your game is being

278
00:19:24,258 --> 00:19:25,721
compared to.

279
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:25,861
So

280
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:33,522
Game developers like to talk in comparisons because our different departments have very

281
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:38,224
specialized technical language that doesn't really translate to other departments.

282
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:43,386
So sometimes it's easier to compare something rather than try to explain all the technical

283
00:19:43,386 --> 00:19:43,906
details.

284
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:49,047
Like if a boss designer is trying to explain a mechanic to the writing team, it's sometimes

285
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:51,668
easier to go, like, this boss fight.

286
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:53,869
Because then we can all be on the same page.

287
00:19:54,889 --> 00:20:00,553
It gives us a kind of common developer lingo that we can all use.

288
00:20:00,553 --> 00:20:04,275
For Minecraft Story Mode Season 2, we actually got compared to things that were not games

289
00:20:04,275 --> 00:20:06,736
a lot, which is also totally valid and worth checking out.

290
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:10,198
Lord of the Rings came up quite a bit.

291
00:20:10,198 --> 00:20:14,220
I actually have not read the books and I've only seen the movies once.

292
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,482
So every time a scene from Lord of the Rings came up, I would write it down and I would

293
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:20,924
go look at that scene later so I could understand what everyone was talking about.

294
00:20:21,424 --> 00:20:25,845
Probably the one that came up the most was Avatar The Last Airbender because a lot of

295
00:20:25,845 --> 00:20:28,526
us had seen at least one episode of the show.

296
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:33,647
So when someone brought up that as a pitch or an example, everyone was on the same page.

297
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:39,189
It's also worth understanding why these kinds of comparisons are being made to your project.

298
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:43,170
It's going to help you pitch ideas yourself in the future because you already have this

299
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,070
lingo down that everyone else is using.

300
00:20:46,565 --> 00:20:50,715
It's also worth sometimes checking out what people don't want your game to be compared

301
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:55,145
to because it can be easier for some people to describe what a thing isn't than what a

302
00:20:55,145 --> 00:20:55,586
thing is.

303
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:07,809
Okay. So, if your game is based on an existing IP, which a lot of games are now, it's time to

304
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:12,871
get to know that IP as well as possible. For Minecraft Story Mode, obviously,

305
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:18,933
it was getting to know Minecraft. So, I played Minecraft, but I also looked at wikis and watched

306
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:21,094
YouTubers who play Minecraft.

307
00:21:21,734 --> 00:21:26,519
In fact, watching the YouTubers was almost more useful because they were a higher skill

308
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,240
level than I was.

309
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,265
So they could do more things in the game than I could just by myself.

310
00:21:31,265 --> 00:21:34,909
It also let me get to know the Minecraft community a little bit, which ended up being pretty

311
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:40,195
important because Minecraft Story Mode features character versions of some of these YouTubers.

312
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:44,609
For Avengers, obviously I've now read a lot of comics.

313
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:46,950
I have opinions on lore that I did not know

314
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,131
the first thing about in 2017.

315
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:50,732
So you're trying to become something

316
00:21:50,732 --> 00:21:52,753
of an amateur expert in your IP,

317
00:21:52,753 --> 00:21:55,355
because again, your coworkers have probably

318
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,035
done this research before.

319
00:21:57,035 --> 00:21:57,816
But,

320
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:04,252
It's been a while. And it gives you even more of that shared language. You all have something

321
00:22:04,252 --> 00:22:09,717
that you can connect on and use as an example. In fact, you can even ask your coworkers for

322
00:22:09,717 --> 00:22:14,341
recommendations. So, in my case for Minecraft, I would ask people about YouTubers that they

323
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:20,907
particularly liked. Or for Avengers, about comic runs that were very influential.

324
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:23,229
For all of these things, you want to take notes.

325
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:30,794
just it helps you digest all of the things that you're taking in and you can use them

326
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:33,555
as a reference for later, which is really useful.

327
00:22:33,555 --> 00:22:39,337
Even if you never look at these notes again, it slows you down and lets you really take

328
00:22:39,337 --> 00:22:42,338
in what you're looking at and it'll make it easier to remember it later.

329
00:22:43,548 --> 00:22:49,690
Okay. So, you've done your research. You've built your knowledge base. You're feeling

330
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,851
a bit more confident. You've even got a good rapport going with the person you report to

331
00:22:53,851 --> 00:23:00,233
or your manager or both. It's time to get the attention of the rest of your team. Your

332
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:07,314
coworkers. So, why do you want your coworkers to notice you? Well, game development is a

333
00:23:07,314 --> 00:23:07,855
team sport.

334
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:15,226
Whether you're a team of 20 or 220, the industry is actually really tiny and we talk to each

335
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:15,527
other.

336
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:20,329
So it's probably better if people have something nice to say about you, you know?

337
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:23,770
Also, most people don't stay in the same studio forever.

338
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:28,632
So let's say you're going to a new studio and someone at your new studio knows someone

339
00:23:28,632 --> 00:23:31,074
at your old studio and they ask about you.

340
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:34,955
Would it be better if someone has something nice to say than to not know who you are at

341
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:35,055
all?

342
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:40,400
And maybe you aren't in the department you want to be in yet. So, you want to get the attention

343
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,721
of that department. So, here are some ways that I've used to get the attention of my fellow

344
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:55,003
coworkers. It's all about volunteering. To take notes in meetings. To play test. To do Scratch

345
00:23:55,003 --> 00:23:59,924
VO and to audit new hire training. So, we're going to break these apart and sort of go into each one

346
00:23:59,924 --> 00:24:00,404
in detail.

347
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:05,302
So you should always be taking notes in meetings for yourself.

348
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:08,885
Every developer I know has a notebook that they carry around.

349
00:24:08,885 --> 00:24:15,011
But this is more volunteering to take notes for everyone in a meeting.

350
00:24:15,011 --> 00:24:18,274
One huge gigantic caveat before we dive into it.

351
00:24:18,274 --> 00:24:22,138
Women in game development are often relegated to being the note takers in meetings.

352
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:27,561
Male developers, I'm sorry to say, are less likely to volunteer for that or even to think

353
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:29,762
to volunteer for that.

354
00:24:29,762 --> 00:24:32,263
So now that I'm not entry level, I don't volunteer for this.

355
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:37,066
Especially because it was part of my job description as a CDA and I'm good at it.

356
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:39,908
So it could be very easy for that to just become my job.

357
00:24:39,908 --> 00:24:45,431
But for entry level employees, taking notes in meetings is a really easy way to get the

358
00:24:45,431 --> 00:24:49,253
attention of everyone in the room if you do it right.

359
00:24:49,253 --> 00:24:50,754
So here are some tips.

360
00:24:53,391 --> 00:25:00,213
Okay, so Telltale had us taking court reporter style notes, which I don't recommend.

361
00:25:00,213 --> 00:25:04,255
They're very hard to skim through and they're very dense.

362
00:25:04,255 --> 00:25:07,816
The reason we did it was because it was very hierarchical there.

363
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:12,278
So it mattered who gave what note because some people's notes were gospel and you had

364
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,939
to do them while others were just suggestions.

365
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:18,360
And so they needed to be able to look at a note and know exactly who said it.

366
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,186
I'm hoping most of that hierarchy is kind of on its way out and so that matters less.

367
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:27,772
But one thing they did have us do that was very useful was take attendance at the beginning

368
00:25:27,772 --> 00:25:29,034
of the meeting.

369
00:25:29,034 --> 00:25:32,779
So, in addition to helping you learn people's names and giving you an excuse to ask people

370
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:33,520
their names.

371
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:41,723
It helps the people looking at the notes to know who still needs to be run through a proposal or who still needs to give feedback on something.

372
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:50,766
If you're remote, that calendar invite is not good enough because there will be people who say, yes, I'm attending this meeting and then they don't show up or vice versa.

373
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:54,468
So you really want to take attendance based on the actual call.

374
00:25:55,789 --> 00:26:04,858
And some studios, actually a lot of them, have kind of databases of names and photographs to really help you as kind of a cheat sheet if you're really nervous.

375
00:26:04,858 --> 00:26:10,904
And Zoom obviously has little names and faces, so that can also help you in taking this attendance.

376
00:26:11,784 --> 00:26:16,008
The actual style of note that you take during the meeting does not matter.

377
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,429
Just take it the way you're most comfortable.

378
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:22,472
At Telltale, we typed our notes because, once again, it was court reporter style, but also

379
00:26:22,472 --> 00:26:23,753
we had laptops.

380
00:26:23,753 --> 00:26:25,975
And obviously work from home, it's easier for me to type my notes.

381
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:28,377
But some people, they prefer to handwrite.

382
00:26:28,377 --> 00:26:29,357
It slows them down.

383
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:30,758
It helps them digest things easier.

384
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:32,019
It helps them remember them better.

385
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:34,241
So it's really up to you what you want to do.

386
00:26:34,241 --> 00:26:39,405
The most important thing is what you do after the meeting, which is when you organize and

387
00:26:39,405 --> 00:26:40,386
internalize your notes.

388
00:26:41,046 --> 00:26:47,690
So organizing your notes means making them clear and concise for public consumption.

389
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:53,553
Shorter is always better. Bullet points over sentences every time. I also recommend doing

390
00:26:53,553 --> 00:26:58,536
headers for different discussions, maybe highlighting certain things or changing

391
00:26:58,536 --> 00:27:03,859
the font color in some places. This makes your notes easier to skim for other people

392
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:07,742
and they look pretty and I get a lot of compliments when my notes look pretty. So

393
00:27:07,742 --> 00:27:09,303
I do recommend that.

394
00:27:10,537 --> 00:27:15,000
Organizing your notes can also help you internalize what you've heard in the meeting.

395
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,903
Like maybe as you're going through your notes, you remember an example that someone used and

396
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:24,765
you can now add that to your list of things you want to look up. So you're building your

397
00:27:24,765 --> 00:27:27,426
knowledge and you can also add it into your notes for other people.

398
00:27:28,294 --> 00:27:32,476
Also, don't be afraid to send the messy version first.

399
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:34,676
So let's say you haven't,

400
00:27:34,676 --> 00:27:38,418
they want the notes immediately following the meeting

401
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:39,598
and you're a little nervous about it

402
00:27:39,598 --> 00:27:40,379
because they're kind of messy

403
00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:42,359
and you did them in just your own style.

404
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,540
Don't be afraid to send those out

405
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,140
because they'll just use those

406
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,341
to pull their action items out of.

407
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:50,053
and then you can send the organized version later,

408
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:52,715
and they'll use that for reference afterwards.

409
00:27:52,715 --> 00:27:55,157
At Telltale, we used Google Docs.

410
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:58,139
So they could look at my document as I was editing it,

411
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:00,081
so they could get their action items,

412
00:28:00,081 --> 00:28:01,502
and then when they went back to it,

413
00:28:01,502 --> 00:28:02,943
it would be fully organized.

414
00:28:04,939 --> 00:28:08,322
All right, so there are two major perks

415
00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:10,964
to taking notes in meetings that will get you attention.

416
00:28:10,964 --> 00:28:13,927
And the first is getting into meetings

417
00:28:13,927 --> 00:28:16,409
way above your pay grade, seriously.

418
00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:19,352
Because I was taking notes, I was in every leads and director

419
00:28:19,352 --> 00:28:20,413
review.

420
00:28:20,413 --> 00:28:24,136
I also got to be in department meetings for departments

421
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:27,239
I wasn't even in just because they knew I took good notes.

422
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:33,081
And probably my favorite was I got to be in our weekly IP holder meeting with our executive

423
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:38,783
producer in Mojang, which meant I was learning things that even the leads didn't know. In fact,

424
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:43,425
I would sometimes be cornered by the leads after the meeting to ask how it went,

425
00:28:43,425 --> 00:28:45,586
which made me feel very important and got me attention.

426
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:49,729
The other thing that taking notes can help you do

427
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:52,209
is get into meetings with the department you want to be in.

428
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:54,730
So in my case, it got me into the writers' rooms,

429
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,291
which was really fun.

430
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:59,152
So I got constant FaceTime with the writing team,

431
00:28:59,152 --> 00:29:02,453
and they knew who I was and knew I went above and beyond

432
00:29:02,453 --> 00:29:03,953
with my notes.

433
00:29:03,953 --> 00:29:06,294
So that was all very, very positive.

434
00:29:06,294 --> 00:29:08,855
It's not necessarily possible for everybody

435
00:29:08,855 --> 00:29:11,936
to be able to get into other departments' meetings,

436
00:29:11,936 --> 00:29:13,276
and I totally understand that.

437
00:29:13,276 --> 00:29:16,197
But if you get the opportunity to, I highly recommend it.

438
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:24,425
Okay, so next, playtesting. If you're in QA, this obviously doesn't apply to you. You don't

439
00:29:24,425 --> 00:29:29,889
need to volunteer for more playtesting. And small tirade, but QA is a completely valid

440
00:29:29,889 --> 00:29:35,735
career path and not just an entry-level stepping stone into another department. The QA team

441
00:29:35,735 --> 00:29:36,135
is...

442
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:39,924
They're the unsung heroes of game development,

443
00:29:39,924 --> 00:29:42,305
and they're constantly crapped on by the Twittersphere.

444
00:29:42,305 --> 00:29:44,505
So be nice to your QA team.

445
00:29:44,505 --> 00:29:47,066
QA, you're awesome, tirade over.

446
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:49,907
So for the rest of us,

447
00:29:49,907 --> 00:29:52,308
volunteering to playtest has a lot of different benefits.

448
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:54,389
For example, it can get you in front of people

449
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:55,489
you normally wouldn't talk to.

450
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:58,030
For Minecraft Story Mode Season 2,

451
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,431
we introduced a lot of new game mechanics.

452
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,372
So I got to talk to programmers and things like that

453
00:30:03,372 --> 00:30:04,972
that I never would have normally spoken to

454
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:06,533
just because I was testing their thing.

455
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:10,195
I have very low skill level when it comes to playing games.

456
00:30:10,195 --> 00:30:11,296
I'm not very good.

457
00:30:11,296 --> 00:30:16,580
And that can sometimes be helpful for playtesting because I'm kind of the lowest common denominator

458
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:16,720
player.

459
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,545
Some review meetings will also ask that someone play the game while everyone else watches.

460
00:30:22,545 --> 00:30:28,649
I'm really nervous to do this because I don't have a lot of confidence in my skills.

461
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:33,013
But at Telltale, that meant that the player was the one making the dialogue choices.

462
00:30:33,013 --> 00:30:34,354
So it was a little less scary.

463
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:38,717
Just make sure to be ready to answer questions as you play.

464
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:41,879
That's really the biggest point of playtesting.

465
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:44,721
For example, I playtested a boss once for Avengers,

466
00:30:44,721 --> 00:30:48,965
and the designer asked me things like what visual cues I was picking up,

467
00:30:48,965 --> 00:30:52,947
or if I knew what I was supposed to be doing at any given moment.

468
00:30:53,628 --> 00:30:59,370
For Telltale, it was all about if you took a long time to make a choice or you chose the silent option.

469
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:06,632
The question was, were there any choices that you felt were valid or did you think they were all valid?

470
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:08,313
And that's why you didn't choose one.

471
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:12,434
Our display text also was slightly different from the dialogue that would come after it.

472
00:31:12,434 --> 00:31:16,255
And so we were often asked if it felt like the game honored our choice.

473
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:21,180
But really, you're just being a data point for whomever you're playdusting for.

474
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,061
So just be honest.

475
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:28,726
Next is Scratch VO, which is probably my favorite way to get to know my coworkers and to get

476
00:31:28,726 --> 00:31:32,569
attention from other members of the team.

477
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:38,053
For people who don't know, Scratch is the temporary voiceover that's put into the game

478
00:31:38,053 --> 00:31:42,415
to help get levels on their feet before the script is really settled and before you bring

479
00:31:42,415 --> 00:31:45,197
in voice actors, which costs a lot of money.

480
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:49,239
So this is typically done by employees who are decent at reading a line.

481
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:51,040
They don't have to be super great actors.

482
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,461
They just have to be nice to listen to.

483
00:31:53,682 --> 00:31:59,068
I did theater, in case you couldn't tell. I did theater growing up, so I really love doing Scratch.

484
00:31:59,068 --> 00:32:04,255
And I'm a woman in game development, and because there are so few of us, you tend to get asked to

485
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,519
do practically every female character in the game, so it's really fun.

486
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,940
I know not everybody is comfortable doing this.

487
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,021
They don't like to do something that's silly

488
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:15,381
or they feel silly

489
00:32:15,381 --> 00:32:17,421
or they don't like the sound of their own voice

490
00:32:17,421 --> 00:32:18,582
and that's okay.

491
00:32:18,582 --> 00:32:20,182
But I have been pleasantly surprised

492
00:32:20,182 --> 00:32:22,342
by every single one of my coworkers

493
00:32:22,342 --> 00:32:25,223
that's done Scratch Feo, seriously.

494
00:32:25,223 --> 00:32:27,363
Telltale even had employee table reads

495
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:30,184
where employees would get assigned the roles

496
00:32:30,184 --> 00:32:32,344
and it kind of felt like you were in high school again

497
00:32:32,344 --> 00:32:33,524
reading a Shakespeare play,

498
00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:35,985
like there was that much giggling.

499
00:32:35,985 --> 00:32:37,865
But it was really like a team bonding.

500
00:32:38,226 --> 00:32:47,789
experience to do it. So why am I telling you to do ScratchVO? Number one, the audio team is the best.

501
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,448
I am extremely biased because I work with them a lot,

502
00:32:51,448 --> 00:32:54,069
but the audio team, they're amazing.

503
00:32:54,069 --> 00:32:56,090
They're at the end of the pipeline,

504
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,571
so they're often forgotten or left out of decision-making,

505
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:02,453
even though they touch every single part of the game,

506
00:33:02,453 --> 00:33:04,253
like every single part.

507
00:33:04,253 --> 00:33:06,454
Like if you were an enemy designer

508
00:33:06,454 --> 00:33:08,475
and you're creating a robot army,

509
00:33:08,475 --> 00:33:11,076
don't you think that robot army would be so much scarier

510
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:12,377
if they all spoke in unison

511
00:33:12,377 --> 00:33:15,318
and there was like this creepy radio fuss over their voice?

512
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:20,299
or maybe you're a level designer and people are not figuring out that they need to go in the

513
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:25,100
direction of the explosion because they keep missing the explosion. So, you add explosive

514
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,261
noises, like, right in their ears so that they know they should be looking for one.

515
00:33:29,261 --> 00:33:37,783
They touch everything. So, getting some time with the audio team one-on-one doing ScratchVO just is

516
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:41,704
going to make you a better collaborator. It means you're less likely to forget them when you're

517
00:33:41,704 --> 00:33:42,584
putting something together.

518
00:33:45,707 --> 00:33:48,808
It also lets you see the game's story from a different perspective.

519
00:33:48,808 --> 00:33:54,551
Let's say you don't touch the story practically at all in your day-to-day job,

520
00:33:54,551 --> 00:34:01,254
and you get asked to read for a minor villain, and you find out from their script that they're

521
00:34:01,254 --> 00:34:05,636
trying to take over the operation from the main villain. It's something you never would

522
00:34:05,636 --> 00:34:07,817
have known had you not come in and read that part.

523
00:34:09,085 --> 00:34:11,726
It also gives you a chance to get away from your desk.

524
00:34:11,726 --> 00:34:14,348
If you're remote, obviously you're still at your desk,

525
00:34:14,348 --> 00:34:18,870
but it's a nice break from whatever your job is.

526
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:24,173
And probably my favorite part is you get noticed

527
00:34:24,173 --> 00:34:25,474
when your voice shows up in the game.

528
00:34:25,934 --> 00:34:33,196
Probably my favorite thing in the entire world is when I'm in a meeting and I'm talking and someone realizes why they've heard my voice before,

529
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:37,397
especially if it's for a role that's very different from my own personality.

530
00:34:37,397 --> 00:34:42,118
Like I would be the Scratch voice for Stella, who was the minor villain in Minecraft Story Mode,

531
00:34:42,118 --> 00:34:45,159
and someone would go, oh my god, that was you!

532
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:48,859
And immediate attention. It's really fun.

533
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:55,381
Audio is always looking for more people to do Scratch, and I think a lot of the time it's because people don't know what it is or don't know that we do it.

534
00:34:56,142 --> 00:35:02,994
So please volunteer, even if it's just to read three lines from a character that immediately dies.

535
00:35:02,994 --> 00:35:08,103
It's a blast and you can get to know your audio team and it's awesome.

536
00:35:08,103 --> 00:35:08,263
Okay.

537
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:14,111
One last way to get to know your coworkers and get noticed by them is to audit new hire training.

538
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:20,056
Like I said at the beginning, onboarding and training in the industry is not universal,

539
00:35:20,056 --> 00:35:25,621
but if there's a formal process at your studio or you just know someone got hired in the position

540
00:35:25,621 --> 00:35:30,526
you want to be in or the position right above you, ask if you can listen in on their training.

541
00:35:30,526 --> 00:35:32,107
The worst they can say is say no.

542
00:35:32,748 --> 00:35:35,750
The worst they can do is say no.

543
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,171
But it'll let you get to know people

544
00:35:38,171 --> 00:35:40,713
who are closer to your level.

545
00:35:40,713 --> 00:35:43,695
If it's someone who has the job just ahead of yours,

546
00:35:43,695 --> 00:35:45,616
they have been in your position recently.

547
00:35:45,616 --> 00:35:47,157
And you are basically peers.

548
00:35:47,157 --> 00:35:50,159
So you're going to be growing up in the studio together.

549
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:52,381
So it's good to get to know them.

550
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:54,142
It also lets you learn the kind of skills

551
00:35:54,142 --> 00:35:56,563
you'll need for your next promotion.

552
00:35:56,563 --> 00:35:59,505
And you can direct your self-study and all

553
00:35:59,505 --> 00:36:01,166
of that research toward bettering

554
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:02,507
those particular skills.

555
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,594
You also won't need as much onboarding.

556
00:36:05,594 --> 00:36:08,120
When you're promoted, you can hit the ground running

557
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,723
because you've already had this training.

558
00:36:11,027 --> 00:36:15,628
It's valuable to listen in on this stuff, even if you think you know everything there is to know

559
00:36:15,628 --> 00:36:20,370
about that position, because hearing about it from somebody else will give you tips and tricks

560
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:26,372
you never would have come up with on your own. At Telltale, we hired a big group of narrative

561
00:36:26,372 --> 00:36:30,733
designers and writers at the same time. And so our narrative design director put

562
00:36:30,733 --> 00:36:35,255
together a kind of formal class to teach them the

563
00:36:35,955 --> 00:36:43,282
proprietary engine and how we approach storytelling at the studio. And I asked to sit in. And I didn't

564
00:36:43,282 --> 00:36:46,825
participate because obviously this is their training. They're trying to get to the point

565
00:36:46,825 --> 00:36:51,208
where they can just jump in and work. So I didn't want to take time away from that. But it let me

566
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:55,252
see more about the engine, which meant when I was actually writing for the game,

567
00:36:55,252 --> 00:36:57,334
I already knew all of the stuff I needed to.

568
00:36:58,134 --> 00:37:03,977
And I also got to know a lot of people who were new to the studio and were similar or just above me in level.

569
00:37:03,977 --> 00:37:08,219
And so it was a really great experience to kind of create a peer group.

570
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:14,722
Plus, I was volunteering for a course taught by the narrative design director who had an opinion

571
00:37:14,722 --> 00:37:19,165
on whether or not I could be a narrative designer. So it was a good idea to get

572
00:37:19,165 --> 00:37:23,006
FaceTime with him too and show that kind of initiative. All right. So.

573
00:37:25,138 --> 00:37:26,559
work over, busy stuff over.

574
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,580
It's time to talk about the best people

575
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,281
to get noticed by at your studio.

576
00:37:33,281 --> 00:37:36,502
Friends.

577
00:37:36,502 --> 00:37:37,843
You are probably spending a lot of time

578
00:37:37,843 --> 00:37:40,764
at your studio at this point, or at the very least,

579
00:37:40,764 --> 00:37:43,925
on the computer with your studio at this point.

580
00:37:43,925 --> 00:37:46,686
And maybe you like the people you work with.

581
00:37:46,686 --> 00:37:48,807
Maybe you even want to be friends with them.

582
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:51,548
I'm not going to teach you how to make friends and influence

583
00:37:51,548 --> 00:37:51,808
people.

584
00:37:52,148 --> 00:37:56,559
But I do have some unconventional methods for if you're still eating lunch alone, and

585
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,849
you're just really nervous about talking to this really cool people who make games for

586
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:01,410
a living.

587
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,491
In addition to making you more comfortable at your studio, which is great,

588
00:38:06,491 --> 00:38:11,574
there's actually some job reasons that you may want to make friends at your studio.

589
00:38:11,574 --> 00:38:18,497
In that same survey where I asked people what they wish they would have known before they started at their first job,

590
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:24,420
I got a lot of responses like this, wishing they'd known some of the internal politics or office gossip.

591
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,743
at the studio because they'd kind of stumbled into some awkward situations without knowing it

592
00:38:29,743 --> 00:38:35,167
and kind of put their foot in their mouth. A lot of people are too embarrassed to ask

593
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:40,110
about this kind of stuff to their manager or the person they report to or their co-workers

594
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:45,374
that they don't know very well, but friends will give you the unvarnished truth.

595
00:38:46,655 --> 00:38:50,616
I relied on my friends a lot at Telltale for dealing with executive leadership and directors

596
00:38:50,616 --> 00:38:57,259
because I would observe something or see something or listen to something and be like,

597
00:38:57,259 --> 00:39:01,862
I don't understand what's going on here and I'm really worried about getting in the middle of it.

598
00:39:01,862 --> 00:39:06,764
So I would ask my friends and they could kind of clarify. So it avoided any kind of

599
00:39:06,764 --> 00:39:08,204
embarrassing situations.

600
00:39:10,205 --> 00:39:14,770
Another good thing about making friends at your studio is that it sort of dismantles

601
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:21,739
or demystifies, I suppose, the hierarchies in your studio. It's kind of hard to be intimidated

602
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:26,324
by the senior programmer if you're also killing him once a week in One Night Werewolf.

603
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:33,186
I really like seeing people in both their professional and casual settings.

604
00:39:33,186 --> 00:39:37,847
At Crystal, while we were still in the office, we had a running lunch game of Resistance,

605
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:39,608
which is a deception game.

606
00:39:39,608 --> 00:39:44,529
And it was always really fun when someone came up to one of my friends and asked them

607
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:49,490
a work question, because they would go from absolutely lying about not being a spy to

608
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,971
answering professional work question.

609
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:56,472
And then they would go back, and it was so cool to see those two different settings.

610
00:39:56,552 --> 00:40:01,353
I couldn't be intimidated by them anymore. I saw at the Switch. How do you make these friends?

611
00:40:01,353 --> 00:40:07,954
You listen. You listen for opportunities to make friends. A lot of game developers are also board

612
00:40:07,954 --> 00:40:15,176
game nerds. Maybe there's a weekly board game night at your studio. Ours was on Fridays at Telltale.

613
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:19,117
Maybe there's a game during lunch, like our Resistance game.

614
00:40:19,577 --> 00:40:26,121
Or something I was really proud of at Telltale is I volunteered to play a campaign of pandemic legacy

615
00:40:26,121 --> 00:40:31,424
with three co-workers I'd never spoken to before. We were from completely different departments

616
00:40:31,424 --> 00:40:37,387
and we ended up becoming this extremely tight-knit group that I would never have known about had I

617
00:40:37,387 --> 00:40:38,848
not put myself out there.

618
00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:44,450
Board games are really great because there's a task to complete, so there's less likely

619
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:48,392
to be awkward silences or a lot of personal questions.

620
00:40:48,392 --> 00:40:52,333
Even if you're joining a long-standing board game group, they're going to be so focused

621
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:57,575
on teaching you the rules and whatever homebrewed home rules they have that you're not going

622
00:40:57,575 --> 00:41:00,456
to be the center of attention quite as much as you think you will.

623
00:41:00,456 --> 00:41:04,478
And by the fourth or fifth game with these groups, you're going to feel like one of them.

624
00:41:04,926 --> 00:41:07,928
There's also Dungeons & Dragons.

625
00:41:07,928 --> 00:41:12,651
I didn't play a lot of D&D before I joined the games industry, but I'm really glad that

626
00:41:12,651 --> 00:41:17,754
I had some knowledge of it because though Dungeons & Dragons is more complicated than

627
00:41:17,754 --> 00:41:21,637
your average board game, it gives you a longer amount of time to get to know a group.

628
00:41:23,695 --> 00:41:29,617
So it also gives you this sort of standing social engagement outside of work, especially when you're an entry-level employee.

629
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:34,118
You can kind of go work, work, work, work, work and not focus on anything else.

630
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:38,820
So it's nice to have dedicated like four or five hours that we're going to be playing this game.

631
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,062
So listen for games and groups that are looking for new players.

632
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:48,403
Maybe if you don't want the time commitment of a full campaign,

633
00:41:48,403 --> 00:41:51,664
someone is putting together a one-shot with pre-generated characters.

634
00:41:51,664 --> 00:41:55,805
In fact, if the character sheet is what intimidates you, which it was for me,

635
00:41:55,805 --> 00:42:00,806
you can ask your game master to help you make the character, even make it for you.

636
00:42:00,806 --> 00:42:06,288
And so you can kind of dive in without all of the complicated math and skills and things like that.

637
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:11,097
We had a running D&D game during lunch at Crystal.

638
00:42:11,097 --> 00:42:13,399
So we only played for an hour once a week,

639
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:16,182
but we got to know so many different people at that table.

640
00:42:16,182 --> 00:42:20,466
And it was kind of cool to see

641
00:42:20,466 --> 00:42:23,069
who became sort of the heroes of the story.

642
00:42:23,069 --> 00:42:24,990
And I really, really liked that.

643
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,332
And then during COVID,

644
00:42:26,332 --> 00:42:29,174
I actually joined an online game with a coworker

645
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:31,016
and it let me get to know some people

646
00:42:31,016 --> 00:42:32,097
from different studios.

647
00:42:32,237 --> 00:42:33,498
which was pretty cool.

648
00:42:33,498 --> 00:42:36,360
And we hope to meet in person one day

649
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,722
to roll dice at a table.

650
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,084
So I'm by no means an expert in D&D,

651
00:42:41,084 --> 00:42:43,826
but every time I play with coworkers, it has been a blast.

652
00:42:43,826 --> 00:42:45,687
So I definitely recommend it.

653
00:42:45,687 --> 00:42:49,370
And if you want some less nerdy hobbies, OK.

654
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:52,953
There's always sports.

655
00:42:52,953 --> 00:42:55,795
Telltale had a push-up club where once a day,

656
00:42:55,795 --> 00:42:57,897
people would get together to do 100 push-ups, which

657
00:42:57,897 --> 00:42:59,838
was always very interesting to see out the window.

658
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,484
Maybe there's a running group at lunch that you could join or an intramural studio team.

659
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:14,049
So maybe your studio faces the other offices in your office park and volleyball or something.

660
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:20,874
Again, if you're not looking for a huge time commitment, maybe try out a studio fitness class.

661
00:43:20,874 --> 00:43:26,698
I visited our yoga class once or twice at Telltale and it was a cool bonding moment

662
00:43:26,698 --> 00:43:27,339
with a lot of people.

663
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:35,683
Again, time commitment issues, look for one-off events, like maybe your studio organizes a

664
00:43:35,683 --> 00:43:39,525
karaoke night or one of the teams is going to do an escape room.

665
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:44,568
I highly recommend looking for activities for the same reason that I recommend board

666
00:43:44,568 --> 00:43:45,208
games.

667
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:50,011
If you have a task to complete, there's fewer awkward silences and it can be less uncomfortable

668
00:43:50,011 --> 00:43:54,053
than say a mixer or that kind of thing.

669
00:43:54,053 --> 00:43:56,114
Time for coffee might be nice, but...

670
00:43:56,835 --> 00:44:02,536
It's kind of hard to get the conversation flowing, especially with people you don't know very well.

671
00:44:02,536 --> 00:44:08,758
If you are remote, obviously, this is all a lot harder. But you just got to be looking for those

672
00:44:08,758 --> 00:44:13,840
opportunities. Our resistance game actually went fully online when we all started working from

673
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:19,862
home. They homebrewed a version that worked over Zoom. I know there's a Discord server that plays

674
00:44:19,862 --> 00:44:21,662
One Night Werewolf completely text.

675
00:44:22,453 --> 00:44:27,057
based, which is really cool to find out. Our studio organized Zoom events to get to know

676
00:44:27,057 --> 00:44:32,543
people one-on-one, but sometimes it's as simple as noticing when a co-worker brings up a show

677
00:44:32,543 --> 00:44:38,068
you love and then following up to see what they think about it. Or maybe someone in a

678
00:44:38,068 --> 00:44:39,909
Zoom call is wearing a Critical Role shirt.

679
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,792
And you're like, there are critters at the studio.

680
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:46,353
Maybe we could all maybe watch live once

681
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:48,014
and talk about it over Discord.

682
00:44:48,014 --> 00:44:50,315
That would be cool.

683
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:52,756
If you grew up in the 90s or the 2000s,

684
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:55,418
you know that internet friends are just as valid

685
00:44:55,418 --> 00:44:56,999
as in-person friends.

686
00:44:56,999 --> 00:44:58,799
And that goes double when they work at your studio.

687
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:02,622
So you may have figured out kind of what I've been hinting

688
00:45:02,622 --> 00:45:07,444
at this whole time, why you're getting to know these people.

689
00:45:09,149 --> 00:45:15,551
I'm trying to get you mentors. You can definitely go around your studio and ask for mentors

690
00:45:15,551 --> 00:45:22,813
if you want to. But sometimes it's easier to have mentors find you. I asked those same game writers

691
00:45:22,813 --> 00:45:26,934
if they had mentors in the industry. And I got some pretty overwhelming responses,

692
00:45:26,934 --> 00:45:33,976
including a mentor is extremely crucial for growth in the industry. So, how do you find mentors?

693
00:45:35,463 --> 00:45:40,307
That is the question that I have technically already answered for you a couple of times.

694
00:45:40,307 --> 00:45:45,672
So how do you find mentors? Maybe your manager is giving you career advice now.

695
00:45:45,672 --> 00:45:52,137
That's a mentor. Or the person you report to has already started tailoring all of your tasks

696
00:45:52,137 --> 00:45:53,698
to help with your career goals.

697
00:45:54,791 --> 00:46:00,113
mentor. Or your co-workers from the level design team have enjoyed having you take notes

698
00:46:00,113 --> 00:46:03,794
for them so much that they just invite you all the time. Even when they don't need notes

699
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:11,676
taken, they just want your opinion on stuff. You've got a group of mentors. Or maybe you

700
00:46:11,676 --> 00:46:17,258
have an audio designer in your D&D group and they volunteer to teach you the audio engine

701
00:46:17,258 --> 00:46:19,058
on the side because they know you're interested.

702
00:46:20,947 --> 00:46:27,129
Mentor. Most of my mentors I've realized are mentors in hindsight because I think about all

703
00:46:27,129 --> 00:46:33,251
of the things that they've done for me and I'm grateful for every single one. Having people

704
00:46:33,251 --> 00:46:41,253
looking out for you in this crazy creative industry is essential. So use your listening

705
00:46:41,253 --> 00:46:46,734
power, build your knowledge base, get noticed, and these people will find you.

706
00:46:47,635 --> 00:46:52,861
But if you are still having trouble and you just haven't found the right mentor yet,

707
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:58,407
ask yourself these questions. Who is doing what I want to be doing?

708
00:46:58,407 --> 00:47:02,712
Who in your studio has your dream job? Maybe it's time to get some one-on-one time with them.

709
00:47:03,553 --> 00:47:08,961
Who is one step up from where I am now? Maybe you met them in new hire training.

710
00:47:08,961 --> 00:47:14,369
Or maybe you just know that somebody is just above you. It's worthwhile to seek this person

711
00:47:14,369 --> 00:47:19,677
out because they were where you were super recently. You can learn from their immediate

712
00:47:19,677 --> 00:47:20,618
successes and failures.

713
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:25,228
Has anyone made the move you want to make?

714
00:47:25,228 --> 00:47:26,609
If you're changing departments,

715
00:47:26,609 --> 00:47:28,230
has anyone already made that jump?

716
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:31,393
You better believe I sought out the narrative designer

717
00:47:31,393 --> 00:47:34,495
who used to be a CDA and I consider him a mentor.

718
00:47:34,495 --> 00:47:36,497
Hi, Juan.

719
00:47:36,497 --> 00:47:37,517
And finally, who has time?

720
00:47:38,258 --> 00:47:44,844
because game developers are busy and not everyone has time to be a mentor. It's important. Notice

721
00:47:44,844 --> 00:47:50,669
there are mentors on this particular slide because it's really important to have more than one.

722
00:47:50,669 --> 00:47:55,193
Your mentor is going to get busy and so you want someone else that you can turn to at any given

723
00:47:55,193 --> 00:47:59,296
time. It's totally fine if someone doesn't want a mentor.

724
00:48:00,388 --> 00:48:02,370
If they don't want to mentor you, totally fine.

725
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:04,331
I haven't run into a lot of people who don't.

726
00:48:04,331 --> 00:48:05,772
Most people just don't have time.

727
00:48:05,772 --> 00:48:10,495
And if they don't have time, they tend to recommend someone they know who does.

728
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:14,538
And don't worry if that person is outside of your studio either.

729
00:48:14,538 --> 00:48:19,121
Again, not everybody stays at their studio forever, so it's good to know people elsewhere

730
00:48:19,121 --> 00:48:22,583
and who might have different experiences.

731
00:48:24,327 --> 00:48:31,230
Okay. All of this advice has been to help you get noticed by other people in your studio.

732
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:37,873
My last piece of advice is just for you. Go home on time.

733
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:44,015
Not enough people in this industry are telling newcomers that.

734
00:48:44,015 --> 00:48:53,620
This entire presentation is not to give you a to-do list. It's just to give you options.

735
00:48:55,789 --> 00:49:00,732
This, this right here is the only prescriptive advice. Go home on time.

736
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:08,836
In November of 2017, the day that the second episode that I'd written on for Minecraft

737
00:49:08,836 --> 00:49:18,901
Story Mode launched, I was unceremoniously laid off with 89 of my coworkers, including the three CDAs.

738
00:49:18,901 --> 00:49:19,922
If I had known

739
00:49:21,361 --> 00:49:24,684
back at the beginning, that that was how it was going to end.

740
00:49:24,684 --> 00:49:28,848
The only thing I would change is having a life outside of work.

741
00:49:28,848 --> 00:49:33,652
I worked upwards of 60-hour weeks at my job,

742
00:49:33,652 --> 00:49:35,974
trying to do all of these things at once.

743
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:39,798
And we had a deck on the fourth floor of our building.

744
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:42,380
And I spent most of my time on that deck

745
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:46,504
sobbing because I was burnt out and stressed

746
00:49:46,504 --> 00:49:48,345
and didn't know if I was doing anything right.

747
00:49:50,349 --> 00:49:52,891
I wished I'd had a life.

748
00:49:52,891 --> 00:49:55,713
I asked those same game writers how important work-life balance

749
00:49:55,713 --> 00:49:58,055
was for them, and these are my answers.

750
00:49:58,055 --> 00:50:01,758
I mean, it's pretty important, very important, huge,

751
00:50:01,758 --> 00:50:03,179
the most important thing.

752
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:08,783
I don't think I can change the entire industry with a talk.

753
00:50:08,783 --> 00:50:09,824
I said that at the beginning.

754
00:50:09,824 --> 00:50:13,306
But I can get newcomers to stop buying into the idea

755
00:50:13,306 --> 00:50:14,487
that crunch is necessary.

756
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:20,937
The average person only stays in this industry for five years.

757
00:50:20,937 --> 00:50:22,878
I don't want that to be you.

758
00:50:22,878 --> 00:50:26,681
I want you to succeed and to have people you count on.

759
00:50:26,681 --> 00:50:29,043
That's why this talk exists.

760
00:50:29,043 --> 00:50:32,125
When I was laid off, I ran to my mom's house,

761
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:33,866
and I hid for a week.

762
00:50:33,866 --> 00:50:35,087
I stayed off the internet.

763
00:50:35,087 --> 00:50:37,109
I didn't talk to anybody.

764
00:50:37,109 --> 00:50:42,352
But when I came out from under that rock,

765
00:50:42,352 --> 00:50:43,533
the people I reported to.

766
00:50:44,615 --> 00:50:54,605
had written me these glowing reviews on LinkedIn. And my coworkers had gotten me my writing samples

767
00:50:54,605 --> 00:50:57,268
and had put me in touch with narrative teams that were hiring.

768
00:50:57,268 --> 00:51:03,434
And my friends were all giving me support and saying it was going to be okay.

769
00:51:03,434 --> 00:51:07,998
Game development is

770
00:51:09,395 --> 00:51:14,156
tumultuous and unstable, and I'm not going to sugarcoat that.

771
00:51:14,156 --> 00:51:19,418
But getting noticed by the right people can make it easier.

772
00:51:19,418 --> 00:51:24,939
OK, so in summary, your goal is to get noticed by your manager,

773
00:51:24,939 --> 00:51:29,321
by the person you report to, your co-workers, your friends,

774
00:51:29,321 --> 00:51:30,001
your mentors.

775
00:51:31,977 --> 00:51:35,498
Gain confidence to get their attention by using listening

776
00:51:35,498 --> 00:51:36,738
and building your knowledge base,

777
00:51:36,738 --> 00:51:39,619
letting it inform your self-study.

778
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:42,680
And do not burn out to succeed.

779
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,181
Work hard.

780
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:45,241
Be exceptional.

781
00:51:45,241 --> 00:51:49,543
Then disconnect and have a life.

782
00:51:49,543 --> 00:51:51,884
Making games can seem like a dream.

783
00:51:51,884 --> 00:51:55,605
But the real dream is working on something you love

784
00:51:55,605 --> 00:51:56,745
and having a life you love.

785
00:51:56,745 --> 00:51:59,847
One last request.

786
00:51:59,847 --> 00:52:01,527
Pass it on.

787
00:52:02,614 --> 00:52:10,822
I am here right now because people noticed me, and I want to give people that same opportunity.

788
00:52:10,822 --> 00:52:15,686
I hope you'll do the same when it's your turn to notice.

789
00:52:15,686 --> 00:52:16,367
Thanks for listening.

790
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:17,888
Bye.
