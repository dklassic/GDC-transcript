1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,312
All right, let's get started.

2
00:00:10,372 --> 00:00:11,012
Thanks for coming.

3
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:13,414
Quick reminders, please silence your cell phones

4
00:00:13,454 --> 00:00:14,915
and no video recording.

5
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:17,696
This hour-long talk is split into two halves

6
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:18,897
by me and Robert Yang.

7
00:00:19,377 --> 00:00:20,938
So we have separate evaluation forms.

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,580
If you didn't get beeped on the way in,

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,921
like if you stayed from the last talk,

10
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:27,742
if you can go get beeped, that would be great.

11
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:29,383
You'll get the evaluation form.

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,585
Please fill them out because your feedback

13
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:32,205
is important to us.

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,030
My name is David Shaver, and I'm a game designer at Naughty Dog.

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,351
Before that, I was at Respawn Entertainment,

16
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:39,651
Shell Games, and Zynga.

17
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:42,212
I've been in the industry for almost 11 years

18
00:00:42,432 --> 00:00:44,652
and worked on lots of different games, the most recent

19
00:00:44,672 --> 00:00:45,233
you can see here.

20
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:48,493
I started out as a game programmer

21
00:00:48,573 --> 00:00:50,274
and switched to game and level design.

22
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:52,875
Years ago, this very workshop helped

23
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:55,695
me realize my love of design and helped with that transition.

24
00:00:57,173 --> 00:01:00,195
Now, this talk is about how to guide players naturally

25
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:01,136
with your level layout,

26
00:01:01,576 --> 00:01:03,878
and how to minimize the reliance on HUD markers

27
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,519
and forced camera moves and all that stuff.

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,302
It's the talk that I wish someone would have given me years ago

29
00:01:08,582 --> 00:01:09,903
because it really would have saved a lot of time.

30
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,065
Speaking of saving time, this talk is jam-packed,

31
00:01:13,165 --> 00:01:14,166
so this overview is quick.

32
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:17,269
Part one, guiding players with block mesh layouts with me,

33
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:20,191
and part two, Robert will be talking about level lighting.

34
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:20,831
Let's go.

35
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,854
First up, let's get all on the same page.

36
00:01:24,754 --> 00:01:25,955
What the heck is block mesh?

37
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:31,412
Well, at Naughty Dog, we call levels built with simple geometry and textures block mesh.

38
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:34,815
Unfortunately, our industry hasn't arrived at a single term at this yet.

39
00:01:35,235 --> 00:01:38,478
It's actually, they also call it gray box and white box and all kinds of things.

40
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:42,182
Mostly, I prefer block mesh because it includes color and lighting,

41
00:01:42,582 --> 00:01:46,105
which are very important when playtesting layouts since they help guide players.

42
00:01:47,062 --> 00:01:49,624
Also, handing off colored block meshes to your artists

43
00:01:49,784 --> 00:01:51,125
make it a lot easier to communicate

44
00:01:51,265 --> 00:01:53,847
the kinds of textures and colors you had in mind.

45
00:01:54,507 --> 00:01:56,028
Green floor, it's probably grass.

46
00:01:56,268 --> 00:01:57,309
Brown, it's probably dirt.

47
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,371
Now let's look at a common level design process

48
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,172
at a game studio.

49
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,453
First, you need to establish the context

50
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:05,514
and constraints of your level.

51
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:08,116
This includes things like the environment type,

52
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:10,277
the time of day, location in the story,

53
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:13,079
available character abilities, enemy types, all that stuff.

54
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,641
You should decide on the gameplay and narrative beats,

55
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:15,841
too.

56
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:18,561
Once you have your requirements in Beats,

57
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:21,942
dive right into building a rough version of the entire level

58
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,383
so that you can get a sense of pacing and scale.

59
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:27,203
Be sure to stub in those game plan narrative beats, too.

60
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:30,184
Get something playable quickly, and then watch

61
00:02:30,244 --> 00:02:30,984
other people play it.

62
00:02:31,404 --> 00:02:33,105
There's no need for a formal play test or anything.

63
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,885
You can just grab anybody, because the feedback

64
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,766
that you get from them is going to change a block mesh.

65
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:41,667
Repeat this iteration loop until you basically run out of time.

66
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:44,627
And once you run out of time, your layout's locked,

67
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,068
and you hand it off to the rest of the team

68
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:46,948
to make it look amazing.

69
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:48,673
But your job isn't done yet.

70
00:02:49,114 --> 00:02:51,815
Your task at this stage is to ensure that your design goals

71
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:53,196
mesh with their artistic goals.

72
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,878
So keep playtesting and work with your artists

73
00:02:55,918 --> 00:02:58,059
to ensure that it still plays great with the real art.

74
00:02:58,899 --> 00:03:00,160
Now, it's worth noting that every studio

75
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,041
has a different process.

76
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:03,522
But this core iteration loop is universal.

77
00:03:04,703 --> 00:03:06,104
So now let's get to the block mesh tips.

78
00:03:06,704 --> 00:03:08,525
Now, our game director Kurt told me

79
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:10,086
that tips wasn't a strong enough word

80
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,087
for how important these are.

81
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,128
So I'm going to rename them now to guidance principles.

82
00:03:15,683 --> 00:03:17,485
So first up, we have affordance.

83
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,967
One of the most powerful ways to guide players

84
00:03:21,047 --> 00:03:23,528
is by using affordances, which are properties of an object

85
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:26,290
that define its possible uses and make clear

86
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,110
how it should be used.

87
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,852
A classic example is a door handle.

88
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,434
Just by looking at a push bar or a pull handle,

89
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:34,715
you intuit whether or not to push or pull the door

90
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:35,435
as you approach.

91
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:37,577
Ladders afford climbing.

92
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:40,338
Edges also afford climbing.

93
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:45,815
Ramps afford jumping off or smashing through a vent in Wolfenstein 2.

94
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:49,957
Affordances depend on your game rules because that's what they're communicating to the player.

95
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:55,079
So for our game designers, affordance is a great way to communicate to the player

96
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,600
what they can interact with or where they can go.

97
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,782
Players will learn what is interactive and it will attract them towards these affordances.

98
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,543
Consistent Color and Shape establish a trust contract

99
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:08,425
with players who use these to learn your game rules.

100
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:12,830
You should ensure that all of your affordances work consistently throughout the game,

101
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:15,972
or it breaks that trust contract, which will cause player frustration.

102
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:20,354
You should also include affordances in your block mesh phase.

103
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,455
It'll help guide players where you want them to go.

104
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:23,856
So let's see what it looks like.

105
00:04:26,537 --> 00:04:29,478
So in this block mesh, it's not clear where the player should go next.

106
00:04:30,058 --> 00:04:32,720
Sure, the ladder affords climbing up the little tower, but then what?

107
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,521
Jump to the cliff? Dive in the water?

108
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:36,201
What if we add some affordances?

109
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,260
It becomes clear where to go.

110
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,081
The boards on the roof afford jumping to the cliff,

111
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:44,622
while the edge grabs on the cliffs afford climbing.

112
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,603
Of course, this example is tailor-made for Uncharted,

113
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:51,264
but the game's same concepts will apply to your traversal mechanics.

114
00:04:52,064 --> 00:04:53,905
It may seem silly to add them so early,

115
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:57,405
but trust me, it makes a world of difference in how your playtests go,

116
00:04:57,606 --> 00:04:58,826
and it doesn't take that much effort.

117
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:04,648
And one more thing, ensure these affordances use consistent shape and color.

118
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,551
Follow the game metrics and you empower your team with this information.

119
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:11,613
They could even be prefab objects that the whole team can use.

120
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:15,095
Next tip, denying affordance.

121
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:20,159
While affordances are important at showing the player what they can interact with,

122
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:23,000
showing them what they cannot interact with is also important.

123
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:27,203
This is denying affordance and it prevents player frustration and guides them.

124
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:31,539
Now you can't just disable a ladder or place an invisible wall.

125
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,921
I mean, you can, but you shouldn't because it's frustrating to players.

126
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:41,784
So you need to contextualize why you can't use the affordance by adding clearly visible

127
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:44,045
things that say, can't use this or don't go there.

128
00:05:45,685 --> 00:05:49,107
Also make sure the reason for denied affordance is clear in your block mesh.

129
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,772
At Naughty Dog, we record when a playtester tries to jump

130
00:05:54,293 --> 00:05:55,734
and grab something that they can't grab.

131
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:58,455
We call these bad jumps and overlay them

132
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:00,116
as red spheres in the game so that we

133
00:06:00,136 --> 00:06:01,497
can identify problem areas.

134
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:04,179
Often, we'll find something that looks climbable

135
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,260
but isn't supposed to be.

136
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,701
So we'll cover it with foliage or something.

137
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:10,263
And after the next playtest, those bad jumps will be gone.

138
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,444
Like sanding down a piece of wood,

139
00:06:12,784 --> 00:06:14,866
this process makes the levels play smoother.

140
00:06:16,735 --> 00:06:18,616
Here's an example of using spiky shapes

141
00:06:18,756 --> 00:06:20,457
and breaking up the horizontal edge

142
00:06:20,577 --> 00:06:21,758
to deny climbing affordance.

143
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,200
Even though the window is within climbing range,

144
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,721
you still can't grab it because it's visually blocked.

145
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,203
Notice how this is contextualized

146
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,324
to the environment with bricks and rebar.

147
00:06:33,264 --> 00:06:35,726
This is important for games grounded in reality.

148
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,187
For games not so grounded, you can get away with a lot,

149
00:06:39,388 --> 00:06:39,988
and that's OK.

150
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:42,969
Just find the right tone and context for your world

151
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:45,091
to make it feel natural and still deny affordance.

152
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:46,947
Now let's see some block mesh.

153
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,430
Let's say that we want the player to go through the window on the right,

154
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,551
which is busted open.

155
00:06:52,832 --> 00:06:54,913
The left window is covered with a bush,

156
00:06:55,494 --> 00:06:58,737
and the front porch window and door are blocked with boards.

157
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:01,579
Most players will glance at this house

158
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:03,420
and go right for that window in a playtest.

159
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:05,342
The intended way forward is open,

160
00:07:05,662 --> 00:07:08,024
while the rest of the entrance affordances are denied.

161
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:11,968
Next tip, shape language.

162
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,552
Establishing a consistent shape language communicates affordance and guides players.

163
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:21,755
Climbing edges in Uncharted are always horizontal and flat.

164
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:28,639
As a player, you learn this visual language of Ford's climbing and you can spot it easily.

165
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,643
Also, people tend to have emotional associations with certain types of primitive shapes, which

166
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:37,025
is even common across cultures.

167
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:42,348
We can use this to our advantage to guide players toward or away from certain shapes.

168
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:45,245
Round shapes tend to be viewed as non-threatening.

169
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:46,726
There's nothing to stab you with.

170
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:50,468
Rectangular shapes are viewed as stable and trustworthy,

171
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:51,929
like a shelter.

172
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,411
And diagonal shapes are viewed as aggressive and dangerous,

173
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:56,111
like a spear.

174
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:59,033
Now let's take a look at a screenshot

175
00:07:59,053 --> 00:08:01,515
from Uncharted, The Lost Legacy, and highlight the shapes.

176
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,237
As you can see, the spiky shapes feel

177
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:07,318
a little bit uncomfortable, possibly causing

178
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:08,479
you to want to avoid those areas.

179
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:12,097
The round areas aren't a threat and they actually provide stealth.

180
00:08:12,877 --> 00:08:16,338
And the square shapes are combat cover or buildings, nice and stable.

181
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,139
All of this subtly guides the player to the buildings.

182
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:21,300
Now let's see what it looks like in Block Mesh.

183
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,601
Let's say we want the players to go to the right

184
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:28,182
and they're being chased, so exploration will wreck pacing.

185
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:32,044
The path sort of leads there, but some players may veer to the left.

186
00:08:32,264 --> 00:08:33,904
So how can we gently nudge them to the right?

187
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:36,945
First let's add some spiky trees

188
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,026
and some other pine trees that angle toward the goal.

189
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:41,296
Then we'll add some round bushes.

190
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:44,438
Finally, we'll add a small building.

191
00:08:44,718 --> 00:08:45,918
And I'm not going to lie, at this point,

192
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:46,599
I kind of feel like this.

193
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,340
But with a lot less hair.

194
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,061
All right, let's highlight those shapes we just added.

195
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:57,328
The spiky shapes say danger, and they discourage going there.

196
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:00,751
The square building implies, hey, stability is this way.

197
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:03,392
The round stepping stones on the ground

198
00:09:03,553 --> 00:09:05,334
act as breadcrumbs to that stability,

199
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:07,795
and the round bushes kind of act as bumpers

200
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:09,116
to frame the play space.

201
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,598
Of course, none of this prevents the player

202
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,639
from going wherever they want.

203
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,860
It just gently guides them where they should go.

204
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:17,702
Next tip, color language.

205
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:23,601
When you're trying to establish a consistent visual language in your affordances,

206
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:24,482
shape is only half of it.

207
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:26,884
You also need a consistent color as well.

208
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:33,008
Adding color provides valuable context for an otherwise barren block mesh.

209
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:35,510
It also adds depth if you're making a 3D game.

210
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:39,373
Coloring also speeds up collaboration with your team

211
00:09:39,593 --> 00:09:42,235
because at a glance, they can get it without explanation.

212
00:09:43,236 --> 00:09:45,337
Is the ground supposed to be dirt, lava, water?

213
00:09:46,973 --> 00:09:51,296
Now Naughty Dog is notorious for using contrasting colors to draw the eye to where you should go.

214
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:57,038
Here we have a bright yellow sign and rail, and it subtly lets the player know where to put the plank.

215
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:03,081
Most people won't question why only one rail is yellow, they'll just remember that they intuitively knew where to go.

216
00:10:05,142 --> 00:10:06,743
Here we have white climbable edges.

217
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:08,864
And here are some more edges.

218
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:11,665
But wait, these are green. I thought you said to be consistent.

219
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,492
Well, it's not a single color that's important.

220
00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:17,254
It's using consistent color and shapes

221
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:18,916
in the context of the environment.

222
00:10:19,556 --> 00:10:21,037
Try to blend them into the environment

223
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:23,519
so it looks natural but still stands out.

224
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,421
Let's see how color can age a block mesh.

225
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:28,503
Here we have a gray box.

226
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:31,545
It's not really clear where the player should go

227
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:32,826
or where they even can go.

228
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:35,268
Affordances are gray and they're hard to see.

229
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:37,530
Also, what kind of environment is this?

230
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,131
A desert? An icy planet?

231
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:42,598
First, let's add color to the affordances

232
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:45,559
so that you can see them and the path forward, sort of.

233
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:47,680
But we're still missing the context.

234
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,560
What is this place?

235
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,180
You know, everything blends together.

236
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:51,721
Boom.

237
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:54,582
We add color to the top of the blocks,

238
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:56,702
and suddenly you're in a grassy, mountainous area

239
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:57,683
with water down below.

240
00:10:58,383 --> 00:11:00,243
As you can see, adding color to your block mesh

241
00:11:00,303 --> 00:11:03,784
helps contextualize the level to the players and to teammates.

242
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:06,705
And to further ground this on Earth, let's add some props.

243
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:12,678
Now, color is important, but it shouldn't be the only thing that you rely on because

244
00:11:12,698 --> 00:11:13,958
some players are colorblind.

245
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,281
You should combine color with other techniques, like unique shapes, and using contrasting

246
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:20,862
color values rather than hues.

247
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:25,724
Bonus points if you can get colorblind playtesters or teammates to help identify problems, and

248
00:11:25,764 --> 00:11:26,925
make your game more accessible.

249
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:29,386
Next tip, landmarks.

250
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,787
Here's the bridge. That's our way out of here.

251
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:45,972
Ever wonder why game characters spend so much time pointing at things in the distance?

252
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:50,335
Well, that's because they're landmarks, and they're a great way to orient players in your world.

253
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:56,000
A landmark is basically just a big object that can be seen from far away and from different vantage points.

254
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,944
If used correctly, players will see this object over and over as they get closer to it

255
00:12:00,164 --> 00:12:01,785
to let them know they're headed in the right direction.

256
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:05,650
Landmarks also act as a goal for the player to work toward.

257
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,232
They're also called weenies.

258
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:09,416
If you want to know more about that,

259
00:12:09,516 --> 00:12:10,918
just Google Disney and weenies.

260
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:12,401
Don't worry, it's safe for work.

261
00:12:13,302 --> 00:12:13,783
Probably.

262
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,366
It depends if your safe search is on.

263
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:17,947
All right, check this out.

264
00:12:18,627 --> 00:12:19,948
Zelda, the Breath of the Wild, really

265
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:21,049
goes nuts with the landmarks.

266
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:24,031
In just this one shot, there are several visible all in a row,

267
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,632
and they're not overlapping one another.

268
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:27,333
They also have unique silhouettes

269
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,855
so you don't confuse them, which is also a great tip.

270
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,597
Try to have unique silhouettes for things in your game

271
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:34,759
so that players can distinguish them at a glance.

272
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:36,860
All right, block mesh time.

273
00:12:37,861 --> 00:12:39,602
Let's add a landmark to this block mesh.

274
00:12:41,747 --> 00:12:47,010
It's pretty basic, but it can have a huge impact on drawing the player toward a certain direction.

275
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:52,152
If I'm working with a landmark, I like to add it first and then build the level backwards from there.

276
00:12:52,753 --> 00:12:55,574
That way I can always see it in the distance and shape the level accordingly.

277
00:12:56,714 --> 00:12:58,115
Next tip, openings attract.

278
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,297
Caves, doors, etc. They all seem to attract people toward them.

279
00:13:03,438 --> 00:13:07,340
These openings often lead to a refuge space, which psychologically feels safe.

280
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:12,148
Openings also have an air of mystery about them, and people want to see what's inside.

281
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:17,092
This attraction happens in the real world with hobbies like spelunking and urban exploration.

282
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:23,517
Here in Titanfall 2, a ramp affords jumping to a nicely lit opening that begs to be explored.

283
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:28,221
This underwater opening lets you know that there's something beyond it if you swim for

284
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:28,341
it.

285
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,464
It even works in block worlds.

286
00:13:31,684 --> 00:13:33,125
As soon as I saw this, I went right for it.

287
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:36,828
Doors and archways also draw you inside,

288
00:13:36,948 --> 00:13:38,690
even though an archway may not have a roof above it.

289
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:42,673
When adding openings to block mesh,

290
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:44,755
it's important to have different colors

291
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:46,456
for interior and exterior walls.

292
00:13:47,337 --> 00:13:48,958
Here we have a cool white exterior

293
00:13:49,018 --> 00:13:50,139
and a warm yellow interior.

294
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,781
This helps players read depth in your block mesh.

295
00:13:53,442 --> 00:13:54,923
If they're the same color, it's hard to tell

296
00:13:54,963 --> 00:13:56,104
that it's even an opening.

297
00:13:57,065 --> 00:13:59,727
Also, communicate this design intent to your artist

298
00:13:59,747 --> 00:14:01,609
to ensure that they know that this is an entrance

299
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:02,970
and that it needs to stand out.

300
00:14:04,297 --> 00:14:07,018
Next tip, gates and valves.

301
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:09,059
Terrible joke.

302
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:12,380
All right, no, not those gates and valves, the kind that make way more money.

303
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,100
We want the level design kind.

304
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,901
Gates stop progress until some sort of conditions are met.

305
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:21,362
You've killed all the enemies, you've moved the debris out of the way, etc.

306
00:14:22,223 --> 00:14:23,083
Valves are the opposite.

307
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:26,804
They let players move forward and then they slam the door shut behind them so they can't

308
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,464
get backtrack.

309
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:32,926
In this scenario, we want the player to enter the combat space and be trapped until combat's

310
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:33,146
over.

311
00:14:33,994 --> 00:14:37,837
We have a valve into the space and then a gate at the other end blocking them so they can't leave.

312
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:44,241
Once they enter, the gates and valves reduce the possibility space of the world to just the combat zone.

313
00:14:44,982 --> 00:14:48,604
Also, there's less mentally to keep track of so players can focus on the task at hand.

314
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:56,229
It may look like this is only useful in linear games, but open world games can use it too with scenarios like arena battles.

315
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:01,193
The Halo series did a great job of having big open levels that gated and valved players when needed.

316
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:04,358
Now gates are pretty straightforward.

317
00:15:04,498 --> 00:15:06,339
There's something in your way, and you need to clear it.

318
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,241
So I'll focus on valves, which can be a little more nuanced.

319
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,462
In this valve example, you drop down,

320
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:12,503
and you can't get back up.

321
00:15:29,573 --> 00:15:31,454
A fairly famous valve is in Super Metroid.

322
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,282
where an entire chunk of level acts like a valve.

323
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:37,865
At some point, the player falls down this really long shaft and there's no way back up.

324
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:42,068
They're stuck, and the vast possibility space of the game is reduced

325
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:43,990
to a tiny portion as seen on the map.

326
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,932
In this space, they find two critical items,

327
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:48,533
the high jump boots and the ice beam,

328
00:15:48,994 --> 00:15:51,696
and they learn to freeze enemies and then jump off of them

329
00:15:52,176 --> 00:15:53,937
so that they can use it to escape the shaft.

330
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:58,221
The shaft that was once a valve has now become a gate that needs to be overcome.

331
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:00,706
Given the entire world to explore,

332
00:16:00,746 --> 00:16:02,748
they may have never discovered this ability.

333
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:05,570
Next tip, leading lines.

334
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:08,553
Leading lines are a composition technique

335
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:10,314
where lines in the environment draw the eye

336
00:16:10,354 --> 00:16:11,796
to a specific place in the scene.

337
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:15,639
In this photo, the logs dry the eye up and into the frame

338
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,020
to finally rest on the house.

339
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:20,263
In games, these are often things like roads and pipes

340
00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:21,584
and cables and all sorts of stuff.

341
00:16:22,825 --> 00:16:25,407
Here in Titanfall 2, we wanted the player to focus on this door

342
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:26,949
and not miss the reveal of a new enemy.

343
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:30,089
Pipes and floor grates form leading lines to the door.

344
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:33,350
And when you get close, a stalker rips the door open

345
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,250
for a grand reveal.

346
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:38,512
Here in the block mesh is a hallway with a T-junction

347
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:38,952
at the end.

348
00:16:39,972 --> 00:16:41,873
Let's say you wanted the player to go to the right again.

349
00:16:42,673 --> 00:16:43,993
Right now, it's a coin toss.

350
00:16:44,554 --> 00:16:47,495
They may turn left, see a locked door and turn around,

351
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,256
or they may smoothly go to the right and enter the next area.

352
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:52,717
By adding some leading lines, though,

353
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:54,357
we can draw their attention to the right

354
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:56,078
and increase the chances they'll go there.

355
00:16:56,847 --> 00:17:00,108
Pipes on the walls and rug guide the player down the hallway.

356
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,929
But the pipes on the left stop while the pipes on the right

357
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:05,870
go along around the corner, drawing the eye.

358
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,931
The caution cones break up the red line of the rug going left.

359
00:17:11,252 --> 00:17:14,533
And to go over the top, we add a big bright yellow cable

360
00:17:14,913 --> 00:17:17,274
that hugs the right side and goes along around the corner.

361
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:20,195
Just some simple shapes, but it can have a huge impact

362
00:17:20,335 --> 00:17:22,175
on smooth navigation in your play tests.

363
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:24,216
Next tip, pinching.

364
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:28,839
Pinching basically means your layout funnels the player to a specific spot.

365
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:34,742
You accomplish this by blocking off areas and angling shapes to naturally flow to that spot.

366
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:37,223
It's good for redirecting players to a specific area,

367
00:17:37,783 --> 00:17:39,824
and it's also a great way to set up a cool reveal,

368
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:43,486
like the view of a landmark, without forcing the camera to look at it.

369
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,827
If you pinch them to a specific spot,

370
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:48,708
the camera will be naturally pointed at the thing you want them to see.

371
00:17:53,843 --> 00:17:56,624
Of course, all of this completely depends on your mobility mechanics.

372
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:59,886
It's much easier to do this in a game where players are stuck on the ground

373
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,446
than in something like Titanfall where they're flying all over the place.

374
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:04,307
Let's look at an example.

375
00:18:05,527 --> 00:18:07,948
Here, the buses and cars are angled to a specific spot,

376
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:09,949
which you can see highlighted here.

377
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:15,651
Walking down the street, the shapes naturally bring you to the end of the pinch,

378
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:17,632
which faces the way forward.

379
00:18:19,205 --> 00:18:20,065
Let's see it in action.

380
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:22,686
In this video, the pinch lines up a perfect shot

381
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:24,647
of the hospital in the distance, which is your goal,

382
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:26,367
and the tunnel that takes you there.

383
00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:41,773
Next tip, framing and composition.

384
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,451
Another technique borrowed from photography.

385
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:48,572
By framing your subject, be it a landmark, a big enemy,

386
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:50,453
or a cave opening, you draw attention to it.

387
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:52,374
If you'd like to learn more, just

388
00:18:52,394 --> 00:18:54,435
Google some photography composition techniques.

389
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:55,295
You'll find lots of stuff.

390
00:18:57,176 --> 00:18:59,117
This one's really useful when combined with pinching

391
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:00,898
to set up an important reveal on the level.

392
00:19:01,498 --> 00:19:03,499
After you pinch the player to a specific spot,

393
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,840
perfectly frame the object for maximum effect.

394
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,341
Let's see it in action.

395
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:20,198
As you saw, the player is naturally pointed at the dam,

396
00:19:20,338 --> 00:19:22,799
and due to good framing, it was the dominant thing on screen.

397
00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:26,460
Also, a side tip, people's eyes are drawn to detail,

398
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,861
and the dam is very detailed.

399
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:30,202
All of this with just some layout

400
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:31,342
and no forced camera moves.

401
00:19:33,003 --> 00:19:34,563
All right, next tip, breadcrumbs.

402
00:19:35,264 --> 00:19:35,924
Aw, yes.

403
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:40,106
Breadcrumbs lead the player a little piece at a time

404
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:40,606
to the goal.

405
00:19:41,706 --> 00:19:43,847
They can be almost anything, chunks of stuff on the ground,

406
00:19:43,987 --> 00:19:47,268
pickup items, enemies, lit areas, et cetera.

407
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:50,680
It's usually better to add breadcrumbs to your block mesh

408
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,680
after the early play tests, because they

409
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,921
can hide fundamental layout guidance problems.

410
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:57,502
But if you still need them after a few revisions,

411
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:58,562
don't feel bad about adding them.

412
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:02,003
In this example, the bits on the fence and roof

413
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:04,424
create a visual stepping stones to the ledge.

414
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:08,965
In Destiny 2, these panels guide the player into the tunnel.

415
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:11,846
Now, if your game has pickups.

416
00:20:12,732 --> 00:20:14,773
They're a classic way to breadcrumb players around the level.

417
00:20:15,273 --> 00:20:17,173
Like how many times have you played a Mario game

418
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:18,873
and the coins led you to a new area?

419
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:22,914
Pickups are also great for letting players know they're on the right path

420
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:24,554
in a cluttered or maze-like environment.

421
00:20:25,094 --> 00:20:27,455
This one's placed next to an area that you can duck under,

422
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:29,315
which some players forget they can even do.

423
00:20:29,815 --> 00:20:31,916
So it subtly hints, yep, you're going the right way.

424
00:20:33,976 --> 00:20:34,976
So to go back to this house,

425
00:20:35,396 --> 00:20:38,397
let's say only half the players during our last playtest went into the house,

426
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:39,817
and the other half got lost.

427
00:20:41,238 --> 00:20:44,001
Let's add some rocks and boards as breadcrumbs leading to the window.

428
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:47,604
Notice how the boards are angled toward the window, creating leading lines.

429
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:52,629
You can also sprinkle these breadcrumbs in open world areas to lead players to interesting

430
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,811
things like the panels in the Destiny example.

431
00:20:56,393 --> 00:20:57,354
Next tip, textures.

432
00:20:58,454 --> 00:21:02,016
You can use textures to subtly or sometimes obviously point the way to a goal.

433
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:07,059
These can be just about anything. Arrows, scrapes on the wall, signs, etc.

434
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:13,222
Here in Uncharted, The Lost Legacy, scrape textures on the wall communicate a fordance that you can shimmy here.

435
00:21:14,002 --> 00:21:19,785
This example leads to a secret area and a collectible, so it's a good example that you don't need to do this for just the main path.

436
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:22,307
Here in Uncharted 4...

437
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:27,020
These tire tracks on the rock communicate affordance that you can drive here.

438
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:30,543
Now, when I played this game, I didn't notice the tire tracks and I got lost.

439
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:32,305
I didn't work on this game.

440
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:34,867
I worked on the next one.

441
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,112
Once I noticed the tire tracks, though, the rest of it driving went totally smoothly.

442
00:21:41,514 --> 00:21:44,336
Signs literally point the way to the hospital, which is also your goal.

443
00:21:45,457 --> 00:21:47,499
These textures are often some of the last things added

444
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:48,399
when making a level.

445
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,761
So it seems like it's not really going

446
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:51,822
to help your block mesh phase.

447
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:52,622
But guess what?

448
00:21:53,323 --> 00:21:54,704
You don't need to wait for an artist to add them.

449
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:56,405
You can cheat.

450
00:21:56,705 --> 00:21:59,567
And you can build them out of block mesh for your play tests.

451
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:02,829
Here I've added an arrow and a sign to point the way.

452
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,052
And these scratch marks lead into the alley,

453
00:22:06,152 --> 00:22:07,973
indicating something heavy was dragged back there.

454
00:22:08,713 --> 00:22:09,314
And the best part?

455
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,215
These are all just block mesh.

456
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:16,641
Labeling rooms and areas can be super helpful for both linear and open games.

457
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:22,044
If you're building a school, for example, having labels like gym and cafeteria provide

458
00:22:22,084 --> 00:22:24,785
valuable context and signposts as your players explore.

459
00:22:30,736 --> 00:22:34,299
Here I've pulled this away from the wall a bit so you can see that it's just a bunch of blocks.

460
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,343
This stuff only takes a couple minutes to do and it works wonders for your play tests

461
00:22:38,643 --> 00:22:41,406
and also to communicate with your artist where you think signage might go.

462
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:45,530
And I'm not going to lie, this one is so easy and simple and obvious,

463
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,051
it kind of blew my mind when I learned it.

464
00:22:47,071 --> 00:22:49,233
Alright, next tip.

465
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:50,514
Movement.

466
00:22:51,175 --> 00:22:53,197
Movement grabs the eye and the player's attention.

467
00:22:54,392 --> 00:22:55,772
This can be anything that fits your game.

468
00:22:55,912 --> 00:22:59,154
Big scripted moments, birds, sparks, buddies, enemies,

469
00:22:59,414 --> 00:23:01,856
and even just something flapping in the breeze.

470
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:05,698
Also, make good use of the direction of the movement.

471
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:07,659
The player's eye will follow the movement

472
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:09,580
and it can draw an invisible line

473
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,740
right to where you want them to go.

474
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,101
In this example I'm about to show,

475
00:23:13,402 --> 00:23:15,083
the birds draw your attention to the left

476
00:23:15,943 --> 00:23:17,364
where there's this open trailer door.

477
00:23:17,824 --> 00:23:19,645
And the trailer door is also banging in the wind.

478
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:22,046
Both of these things kind of subtly let you know,

479
00:23:22,086 --> 00:23:23,707
like hey, maybe you should check out what's inside.

480
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,740
And the dead body totally helps too.

481
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:45,385
Of course, adding movement in the block mesh phase is highly dependent on your game and engine.

482
00:23:46,005 --> 00:23:48,047
If you can, though, try to include them in your playtests.

483
00:23:48,388 --> 00:23:50,730
Maybe not in the first ones, but definitely before you lock it down.

484
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:52,631
And you don't have to get fancy.

485
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:56,175
You can have basic cubes just lurping through the sky as a placeholder for birds.

486
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,839
Now, adding movement is also super useful as a bandage late in development

487
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:04,222
when the level is basically done, but players are still getting lost.

488
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:08,120
Since the level itself is done, you can script in some movement to help.

489
00:24:08,641 --> 00:24:12,262
But don't rely on it though, like try to solve the player guidance problems in the

490
00:24:12,282 --> 00:24:12,942
block mesh phase.

491
00:24:14,103 --> 00:24:17,865
Last tip, light and god rays, aka light rays or sun beams.

492
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,886
Light and god rays are useful for guiding players to a goal.

493
00:24:22,507 --> 00:24:26,348
People are naturally drawn to light sources and god rays point a line right at the goal.

494
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:29,690
This is important even in the block mesh phase.

495
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,011
The Naughty Dog lighting artists begin very early.

496
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,393
In this example, the two lit areas are breadcrumb goals.

497
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:40,255
First the one with the bad guy in the middle, and then the

498
00:24:40,315 --> 00:24:41,075
one at the top right.

499
00:24:42,517 --> 00:24:44,198
Here we have some god rays coming out of a window.

500
00:24:44,698 --> 00:24:46,760
They take up more screen space, so you're more likely to

501
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,220
notice them.

502
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,622
And they draw a leading line straight to the window, which

503
00:24:49,682 --> 00:24:50,463
is also the exit.

504
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:52,184
Also, notice that swordfish.

505
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,326
It is totally drawing an arrow right at the window.

506
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,196
So that's not lighting, but textures or whatever.

507
00:24:57,517 --> 00:24:59,058
So since my talk is about player guidance,

508
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:01,020
these light tips focus on that.

509
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,802
Robert's upcoming talk is about lighting a level,

510
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,003
so let's start wrapping it up.

511
00:25:05,344 --> 00:25:07,105
But first, a bonus tip.

512
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:09,107
Ah, the squint test.

513
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,889
So simple and majestic, but what is it?

514
00:25:12,848 --> 00:25:15,891
Well, it's basically an easy way to see what stands out in your level.

515
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:18,794
Step one, squint your eyes and look at your game.

516
00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:23,239
Step two, things will be blurry, but what stands out from that blur?

517
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,421
A lit door? A bright yellow truck?

518
00:25:26,062 --> 00:25:28,745
The things that are standing out are the things that players are going to notice first.

519
00:25:29,205 --> 00:25:31,808
So step three, adjust your block mesh and your lighting

520
00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:35,272
so that the things that are popping out are the things that you want them to see.

521
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,076
And here's a fun quote Matias gave me.

522
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:41,999
My professor used to say that squinting can replace

523
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:42,799
four years of art school.

524
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,421
Thanks for the quote.

525
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:46,922
OK, let's see it in action before we wrap up.

526
00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:48,524
Here's a shot from Titanfall 2.

527
00:25:49,344 --> 00:25:51,066
Squint your eyes and take note of what stands out.

528
00:25:51,386 --> 00:25:51,706
Go ahead.

529
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:53,107
I'll give you a minute.

530
00:25:54,308 --> 00:25:55,109
Squinting.

531
00:25:55,209 --> 00:25:55,929
Are we good?

532
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:56,470
Squinting.

533
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,210
Got it?

534
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,091
OK, good.

535
00:25:59,072 --> 00:26:01,553
You probably noticed the yellow walls and the waterfall,

536
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:02,934
and the orange cave opening.

537
00:26:03,774 --> 00:26:05,415
The yellow walls are wall running paths

538
00:26:05,455 --> 00:26:07,457
that draw leading lines straight to the cave.

539
00:26:07,937 --> 00:26:09,858
And the waterfall uses movement and sound

540
00:26:09,898 --> 00:26:12,439
to grab your attention, and it also helps frame the cave.

541
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,761
Openings attract, and the cave is

542
00:26:14,801 --> 00:26:16,442
lit a totally different color from everything else

543
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:16,902
in the scene.

544
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:19,283
OK, it's time to wrap it up.

545
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:21,125
But wait, there's more.

546
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,373
I want to tell you about hashtag Blocktober.

547
00:26:24,954 --> 00:26:27,495
Last October, Michael Barkley at Naughty Dog tweeted this,

548
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:29,496
but in his awesome Scottish accent,

549
00:26:29,577 --> 00:26:30,617
and I am not going to attempt.

550
00:26:31,498 --> 00:26:32,518
What's up, level designers?

551
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:33,979
Level blockouts are art.

552
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,201
Hashtag Blocktober should be a thing.

553
00:26:37,201 --> 00:26:38,422
The response was overwhelming.

554
00:26:38,922 --> 00:26:41,844
Everyone from AAA devs to hobbyists participated.

555
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:43,825
Now, I bring this up because it's

556
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:47,066
and encourage people to make things.

557
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:50,688
So many people didn't realize that the self-deprecating crap

558
00:26:50,728 --> 00:26:53,329
that they were making looked exactly like their favorite games

559
00:26:53,389 --> 00:26:55,911
early in development, and they were super inspired to keep going.

560
00:26:56,871 --> 00:26:58,312
Blocktober is happening again this year,

561
00:26:58,392 --> 00:27:01,374
and Mike created this Twitter account to collect everything people make.

562
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:04,736
So follow it and get started now on your block meshes for Blocktober.

563
00:27:07,345 --> 00:27:09,846
If you like this talk, check out these other links and books.

564
00:27:10,507 --> 00:27:12,268
If you make multiplayer maps, be sure to check out

565
00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:13,949
Elizabeth's talk from last year.

566
00:27:14,189 --> 00:27:15,230
There's no need to write these down.

567
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,291
I'll put all this up on my website after GDC.

568
00:27:18,132 --> 00:27:19,312
It has some bonus tips at the end.

569
00:27:20,153 --> 00:27:21,253
Hopefully you found this talk useful,

570
00:27:21,394 --> 00:27:23,295
and I'll see your block meshes in Blocktober.

571
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:23,795
Thank you.

572
00:27:31,313 --> 00:27:36,636
Hi, this is the second half of the talk of Invisible Intuition.

573
00:27:37,117 --> 00:27:41,539
I'm Robert Yang, I'm a professor at the NYU Game Center.

574
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:45,161
If you want to know more about what we're about, come visit us on the expo floor starting

575
00:27:45,201 --> 00:27:45,481
Wednesday.

576
00:27:47,242 --> 00:27:52,846
And David just talked a lot about block mesh and greyboxing, not greyboxing, sorry, just

577
00:27:52,886 --> 00:27:54,727
block meshing and geometry.

578
00:27:55,247 --> 00:27:59,850
And in this talk I want to focus kind of more on the lighting side of things because as

579
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,152
David just said at Naughty Dog they actually start lighting really early.

580
00:28:03,252 --> 00:28:08,315
So this is also kind of a dimensional level design that I think a lot of people are scared

581
00:28:08,415 --> 00:28:11,417
of and want to avoid doing and you shouldn't be scared about it.

582
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:20,135
A little bit about me, I'm mostly known for my gay culture video games.

583
00:28:21,256 --> 00:28:22,978
Can I get a round of applause for gay sex?

584
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:28,503
Okay no, stop, stop.

585
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:30,705
It's not about that, perverts.

586
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:39,906
This talk is kind of more about maybe how I light my gay video games maybe a little

587
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:45,711
bit and it's okay if you're not cool enough to put gay sex in your game but you know even

588
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:49,154
if you're a straight person you can put lighting in your game maybe.

589
00:28:52,235 --> 00:28:56,256
So in this talk, it's kind of aimed more for beginners

590
00:28:56,816 --> 00:28:58,797
and intermediate level designers.

591
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:01,057
Although even if you're an experienced level designer,

592
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:03,337
maybe you don't think about lighting as much as you could.

593
00:29:03,517 --> 00:29:05,478
So maybe it'll still be helpful for you.

594
00:29:06,218 --> 00:29:10,039
We'll start with a more general discussion of lighting

595
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:12,319
and then get more and more specific

596
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:15,680
as the talk progresses until we end with how

597
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,040
to light a level with a more specific suggested workflow

598
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,741
that you can do in Unity or Unreal or whatever you use.

599
00:29:24,174 --> 00:29:27,095
So first let's start with a brief history of light.

600
00:29:29,877 --> 00:29:32,538
A very brief and simple history of light

601
00:29:32,578 --> 00:29:34,359
might start with the sun, right?

602
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:35,560
The sun is really great.

603
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,141
Let's give it up now for the sun.

604
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:40,182
Although it's going to rain a lot, I'm told.

605
00:29:40,282 --> 00:29:42,744
So you won't see much sun in the next few days.

606
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:49,289
There's also fire, controlled burning in gas lamps, incandescent light bulbs with filament

607
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:50,730
and run current through the filament.

608
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:56,174
There's also a stronger focus these days on energy efficient light sources like fluorescent

609
00:29:56,214 --> 00:29:59,257
lighting or LED lighting is also becoming more common.

610
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:07,003
And I think it's very tempting to think of this as a story about technology and progress

611
00:30:07,203 --> 00:30:11,347
and older light sources becoming obsolete or something.

612
00:30:12,737 --> 00:30:15,340
That's not exactly true, and I don't think that's exactly accurate.

613
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,005
Like, the light bulb did not make the sun obsolete, right?

614
00:30:20,065 --> 00:30:23,970
Like, you still like going outside and playing in the sun or whatever you do in the sun.

615
00:30:24,871 --> 00:30:26,273
I wouldn't know, I'm a game developer.

616
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:32,126
The LED did not make the fire obsolete, right?

617
00:30:32,947 --> 00:30:38,571
You'll go to a restaurant, maybe tonight, and have a nice candlelit dinner or something,

618
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:43,875
and the flickering candle, it's really nice when that's actual fire,

619
00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:46,777
not one of those weird LED flickering things, right?

620
00:30:49,668 --> 00:30:55,590
So as a society, I think we still use fire as a light source, not necessarily as like

621
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:59,452
a task light source where you like write letters by candlelight or something.

622
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:03,373
But you know, it's still in our birthday candles, our campfires.

623
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:08,875
Fire hasn't disappeared, but our culture around fire has changed.

624
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:12,996
Fire used to be common, and now it's kind of more like a special occasion kind of thing.

625
00:31:13,116 --> 00:31:15,417
But it's still here in civilization.

626
00:31:16,622 --> 00:31:19,644
So each of these light sources means something different

627
00:31:19,984 --> 00:31:21,305
and makes a space feel different.

628
00:31:21,865 --> 00:31:24,607
And I urge you to pay attention to the different moods

629
00:31:24,687 --> 00:31:26,848
and atmospheres these different light sources evoke.

630
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,051
And today, contemporary lighting design

631
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:36,473
has been kind of heavily standardized and industrialized.

632
00:31:37,374 --> 00:31:38,975
If you're a lighting designer and you're

633
00:31:39,015 --> 00:31:42,096
shopping for light fixtures or luminaires,

634
00:31:42,356 --> 00:31:43,157
as they're called in Europe,

635
00:31:43,837 --> 00:31:49,440
It's very common to, on the left right there, that's like a picture of like a lighting catalog.

636
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,342
And the lighting catalog gives you all these different stats so you can kind of predict

637
00:31:53,422 --> 00:31:54,323
what the light will do.

638
00:31:55,143 --> 00:31:58,785
And there's also usually often like a chart in that lower left.

639
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:00,966
I've blown up the chart on the right there.

640
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:04,427
And that's a light distribution curve chart.

641
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:10,750
And that kind of shows you how much light that light source or light fixture is going to throw at every given angle.

642
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,631
So notice this light bulb with that light distribution chart on the right.

643
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:19,133
It's kind of shaped like a heart a little bit and has like a crease at the top.

644
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:23,315
Well, that makes sense, right, because the light socket is on top.

645
00:32:23,535 --> 00:32:26,076
It's not going to throw light through the light socket.

646
00:32:26,116 --> 00:32:26,936
That doesn't make sense.

647
00:32:26,956 --> 00:32:29,237
So it's mainly throwing light downwards and to the right.

648
00:32:29,317 --> 00:32:32,598
So now you know how to read a light distribution chart.

649
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:33,379
It's pretty easy.

650
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,281
So this is how real life lighting design quantifies

651
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:41,762
and standardizes the physics of light.

652
00:32:42,342 --> 00:32:45,984
But in video games, light is often much messier than this.

653
00:32:46,944 --> 00:32:51,186
So now I want to talk a little bit about what is game lighting

654
00:32:51,606 --> 00:32:52,607
and what do we mean by that.

655
00:32:54,821 --> 00:33:01,803
Light is a complex phenomenon that's hopefully elegant with a unified theorem and all that.

656
00:33:04,384 --> 00:33:10,906
All these phenomena like reflections, occlusion, translucence, shadows, all those happen in

657
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:13,606
real life for free, so to speak.

658
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:19,111
But in video games, lighting is like a bunch of crap in a box.

659
00:33:19,211 --> 00:33:19,852
We don't...

660
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:23,715
It's just a bunch of random systems that we, like, hack and tune together,

661
00:33:24,256 --> 00:33:28,600
and we throw all that crap in a video game and then pray it'll look okay in the end.

662
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,763
So it's not a beautiful, elegant system.

663
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:33,545
It's just a bunch of random stuff.

664
00:33:34,465 --> 00:33:39,168
And to give you an idea of all that random stuff, right, in any given game engine there's

665
00:33:39,448 --> 00:33:44,671
different cascading shadow maps, there's refraction shaders, there's caustics, there's fog, there's

666
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:51,035
glow sprites, HDR, screen space ambient occlusion, bloom, all these different things are all

667
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:53,376
kind of representing one system.

668
00:33:53,516 --> 00:33:56,758
But in a video game, it's like 20 different systems, right?

669
00:33:57,338 --> 00:34:01,280
And we kind of just turn them on and turn them off on like a case-by-case basis.

670
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:08,387
So when you play a video game, maybe when you go in this room, that's when they turn on some screen space reflection.

671
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:14,033
And then when you go in this other room, they turn off screen space reflection to save on framerate and optimize it and stuff.

672
00:34:14,994 --> 00:34:19,738
And again, from a physics perspective, that makes zero sense.

673
00:34:19,778 --> 00:34:24,723
The idea that you can turn off shadows in real life makes no sense.

674
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:28,388
That would just be like, you should go see a doctor

675
00:34:28,428 --> 00:34:29,168
if that happens, right?

676
00:34:29,188 --> 00:34:29,828
That's not good.

677
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:35,130
So again, video games, we rely on this piecemeal approach

678
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,830
of all this random stuff together.

679
00:34:38,371 --> 00:34:40,491
So in this talk, I'm not going to be talking

680
00:34:40,811 --> 00:34:42,252
about a lot of those effects.

681
00:34:42,352 --> 00:34:44,852
I'm going to be focusing on what I view as the fundamentals

682
00:34:44,992 --> 00:34:48,193
of lighting in level design, which are basically

683
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:51,414
these four basic light types, directional light, spotlight,

684
00:34:51,574 --> 00:34:52,955
ambient light, and point light.

685
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:00,265
So let's say you're mocking up a level in Unity or something,

686
00:35:00,585 --> 00:35:02,828
and you don't have any lights going on.

687
00:35:02,908 --> 00:35:05,390
It's just a dark level, no lights there yet.

688
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:07,513
And I just have a bunch of blocks there.

689
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:12,247
So first you might add some ambient light.

690
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:16,170
Ambient light is a kind of like default amount of light

691
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,411
you might add to a scene.

692
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:19,473
It refers to the whole scene.

693
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:20,274
It's global.

694
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:23,957
And you do that to make sure those shadows in your levels

695
00:35:24,097 --> 00:35:25,258
aren't pitch black.

696
00:35:25,738 --> 00:35:28,200
Because in real life, very few things

697
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,862
are just pitch black like that, unless you're in a really

698
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:32,063
dark cave or something.

699
00:35:32,283 --> 00:35:34,805
There's always a little bit of light bouncing around

700
00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:35,286
everywhere.

701
00:35:35,606 --> 00:35:37,428
So ambient light is kind of meant

702
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,789
to simulate that a little bit.

703
00:35:39,703 --> 00:35:44,346
But notice when we add ambient light, that doesn't really help us read the shapes or anything.

704
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:46,508
It's still very flat, right?

705
00:35:47,168 --> 00:35:52,151
You still can't really see the shapes that well, but you can just distinguish the silhouette.

706
00:35:54,013 --> 00:35:56,174
So that's when you might add another light source.

707
00:35:56,595 --> 00:35:58,535
So here's a directional light.

708
00:35:58,595 --> 00:36:00,796
Directional light is a global light source.

709
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:04,118
It illuminates the entire scene at once from one given

710
00:36:04,158 --> 00:36:04,858
direction.

711
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:07,519
And it usually doesn't matter where you position a

712
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,840
directional light, depending on what tool you're using.

713
00:36:10,421 --> 00:36:12,662
And now with the directional light, you can read the shapes

714
00:36:12,842 --> 00:36:15,903
much more clearly, because you add that directionality

715
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:16,903
component to it now.

716
00:36:17,404 --> 00:36:19,144
And notice how everything pops out more.

717
00:36:20,018 --> 00:36:24,059
In games we usually use directional light, usually for like sunlight or maybe moonlight

718
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:24,539
or something.

719
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,820
Then we also have a spotlight.

720
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:31,482
If the scene is set at night, maybe you want to add some streetlights.

721
00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:34,302
For a streetlight you might want to use a spotlight.

722
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:39,684
A spotlight throws a light in a cone shape in a given direction and from a given position.

723
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:45,386
So here I'm using a spotlight as a downlight to emphasize this walkable floor area instead

724
00:36:45,446 --> 00:36:46,927
of emphasizing something else.

725
00:36:49,947 --> 00:36:52,389
And lastly, I want to talk about the point light.

726
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:54,730
The point light throws light in every direction.

727
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:58,031
Some tool sets might call this an omnidirectional light,

728
00:36:58,131 --> 00:37:00,252
or you can call it an omni light for short,

729
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:02,133
which makes it sound really cool, omni light.

730
00:37:02,473 --> 00:37:07,256
But you imagine a point light as this invisible ball of light

731
00:37:07,556 --> 00:37:10,197
that's just washing everything nearby with light.

732
00:37:11,178 --> 00:37:12,919
So a point light, I think, is usually

733
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,500
really good at drawing attention to a focal point,

734
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,041
because it ends up creating kind of this hot spot

735
00:37:18,141 --> 00:37:19,002
effect a little bit.

736
00:37:20,903 --> 00:37:25,812
In contrast with a spotlight, it's not always clear where the spotlight is shining from,

737
00:37:25,832 --> 00:37:29,739
especially if it's a spotlight like a floodlight shooting light across.

738
00:37:32,242 --> 00:37:35,544
And in practice, you should try to use all four lighting types at once,

739
00:37:35,804 --> 00:37:38,085
because they all can work together really well.

740
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,006
Ambient helps bring up the shadows.

741
00:37:40,307 --> 00:37:42,748
Directional light helps make those background buildings pop

742
00:37:43,148 --> 00:37:45,470
and helps guide the main mood of the scene.

743
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,091
Then you also have a spotlight highlighting an area.

744
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:50,513
Then you also have a point light highlighting the street light.

745
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,915
And again, all this stuff works together, helps create depth.

746
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:58,938
It helps push a background and a foreground for your scene.

747
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:00,899
And that's good.

748
00:38:02,427 --> 00:38:09,448
And with these light sources, I would argue that they form like a complete domain of lighting

749
00:38:09,508 --> 00:38:09,888
tools.

750
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:16,270
So stretching this gamut from like a global light source that affects everything to a

751
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:20,671
local light source that only affects nearby things or a light source that shines in one

752
00:38:20,691 --> 00:38:25,492
direction or all directions, I feel like it's like a complete domain kind of.

753
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:31,793
So again, that's why every 3D engine or tool set usually has these light sources.

754
00:38:35,629 --> 00:38:39,372
So now we should talk a little bit about how we should use

755
00:38:39,412 --> 00:38:40,192
these light sources.

756
00:38:40,993 --> 00:38:44,716
And I'm going to talk about a lighting theory called

757
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:49,920
three-point lighting, which is a very common form of lighting

758
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,583
design theory that's very common in film and photography.

759
00:38:53,663 --> 00:38:55,725
So if you have a background in that, this will seem very

760
00:38:55,785 --> 00:38:56,485
familiar to you.

761
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:02,200
The basic idea of three-point lighting is that you have three different light types.

762
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,003
And here's a diagram that hopefully explains some of it.

763
00:39:07,283 --> 00:39:12,287
In that top left we have a combined composite of three different light types, but we can

764
00:39:12,327 --> 00:39:15,790
also break down what each light is doing into a separate channel.

765
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:19,012
So that's what those other three smaller pictures are doing.

766
00:39:19,812 --> 00:39:22,254
And in the top right, you have a key light.

767
00:39:22,534 --> 00:39:24,755
The key light is kind of like your brightest light source,

768
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:28,677
and it kind of sets the dominant lighting angle and mood

769
00:39:28,737 --> 00:39:30,838
for your scene or picture or image.

770
00:39:31,439 --> 00:39:33,800
Then in the bottom left, we have a fill light.

771
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,562
A fill light helps brighten up the shadows,

772
00:39:36,622 --> 00:39:38,863
kind of like the ambient light we were talking about before,

773
00:39:39,123 --> 00:39:41,484
and helps fill in the darker parts.

774
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:43,966
Usually you want this at a lower intensity

775
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:44,986
than your key light.

776
00:39:46,126 --> 00:39:49,169
Then in the lower right, we have the rim light.

777
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:53,513
And it's also sometimes called a back light or a hair light,

778
00:39:53,573 --> 00:39:54,674
depending on what you're doing.

779
00:39:55,135 --> 00:39:56,877
And it illuminates your silhouette

780
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:59,459
to help pop it out from the background very faintly.

781
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:01,901
Otherwise, the hair might end up, or the top of the head

782
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,623
might be blending in with the background.

783
00:40:03,663 --> 00:40:07,567
So notice they do some specular and stuff on top like that.

784
00:40:10,049 --> 00:40:12,630
And a very common three-point kind of setup

785
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,631
might end up looking a little bit like this.

786
00:40:15,572 --> 00:40:17,292
You have a key light and fill light, usually kind

787
00:40:17,312 --> 00:40:18,913
of at opposing angles.

788
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:20,514
You usually don't want them falling

789
00:40:20,554 --> 00:40:22,935
the same direction and position, because then that

790
00:40:22,955 --> 00:40:24,015
kind of defeats the purpose.

791
00:40:24,595 --> 00:40:27,377
So usually you want fill and key to be at least

792
00:40:27,437 --> 00:40:29,097
different angles and positions.

793
00:40:30,406 --> 00:40:35,371
And in film and photography, there's also often the background light, that optional

794
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:35,972
light right there.

795
00:40:36,672 --> 00:40:41,217
The background light helps brighten the background to help get rid of any awkward shadows that

796
00:40:41,257 --> 00:40:42,539
come from the key and fill.

797
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:45,902
Remember, in real life, they can't just turn off shadows for the key and fill.

798
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:48,865
They actually have to have another light to get rid of that shadow.

799
00:40:52,969 --> 00:40:57,851
And if you basically watch any movie, you can kind of break down any given film shot

800
00:40:58,271 --> 00:41:02,293
along these lines and try to see what all the different light sources are doing.

801
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:05,875
So these are some examples from a blog called Lighting Pixels.

802
00:41:06,475 --> 00:41:10,237
You can see there's a key light, a fill light, and a rim light on that left.

803
00:41:10,877 --> 00:41:14,519
The key light is kind of coming from that top left of that image.

804
00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:17,580
So then it kind of feels like sunlight, kind of.

805
00:41:18,461 --> 00:41:21,784
And everything in that image is kind of evenly illuminated, too.

806
00:41:21,864 --> 00:41:23,026
So it seems very readable.

807
00:41:23,706 --> 00:41:26,009
Meanwhile, on the right, the key light

808
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:27,591
is not coming from the top.

809
00:41:27,631 --> 00:41:29,292
The key light's coming from below,

810
00:41:29,593 --> 00:41:31,595
which means it's probably not sunlight,

811
00:41:31,815 --> 00:41:33,777
unless these people are hanging upside down.

812
00:41:33,797 --> 00:41:35,079
That's probably not sunlight.

813
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:35,159
So.

814
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,444
To me, that means it's more like an artificial light source, maybe like a nice candle or something.

815
00:41:41,944 --> 00:41:49,909
And when that candle is illuminating from Bama's face, I feel like that sets up a very different mood in the right image versus the left image.

816
00:41:50,229 --> 00:41:56,594
The right image feels kind of more intimate and maybe even romantic. I don't know what movie that's from.

817
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,318
Maybe they're breaking up or having a divorce.

818
00:41:59,438 --> 00:41:59,819
I don't know.

819
00:42:00,941 --> 00:42:03,004
Some shit is going down in that right image, right?

820
00:42:03,185 --> 00:42:05,669
But in the left image, zero shit, right?

821
00:42:05,729 --> 00:42:08,314
It's very, very nice and safe.

822
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:18,571
And it's really important to note that with three-point lighting, it's referring to three

823
00:42:18,691 --> 00:42:20,212
types of light sources.

824
00:42:20,492 --> 00:42:23,313
You don't always need to place three lights in every scene.

825
00:42:23,753 --> 00:42:28,574
So for example, in that film shot on the left, there's only two light sources there, a key

826
00:42:28,594 --> 00:42:29,274
light and a rim.

827
00:42:29,294 --> 00:42:30,114
There's no fill.

828
00:42:30,394 --> 00:42:33,695
And the right side of his face is left in shadow.

829
00:42:33,975 --> 00:42:37,296
And that's OK if that's what you want to do with your lighting, and that's the mood you

830
00:42:37,316 --> 00:42:37,876
want to create.

831
00:42:38,737 --> 00:42:43,061
Same thing in that right image, there's only one light source, just one key to help kind

832
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:46,444
of emphasize I think the extreme close-up and intimacy of that shot.

833
00:42:48,126 --> 00:42:52,811
So again, it's just about what you want to do with your lights and what you want your

834
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:53,451
lights to say.

835
00:42:55,918 --> 00:42:57,820
So here's another example on main unity.

836
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,303
Say you want to like light this hunky dude with three point light theory.

837
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:06,529
The way I lit him, I had a key light kind of grazing him a little bit so I could like

838
00:43:06,569 --> 00:43:07,970
catch some muscle definition.

839
00:43:08,811 --> 00:43:14,537
And I had the fill light kind of a little off angle from there because I still wanted

840
00:43:14,557 --> 00:43:17,580
to maintain the key but I wanted to soften how the shadows were hitting him.

841
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:23,044
If you see in the right, that's a variant without the fill light.

842
00:43:23,084 --> 00:43:27,208
And without the fill light, I felt like his face was too much in shadow and I couldn't

843
00:43:27,248 --> 00:43:28,288
read what was going on.

844
00:43:29,049 --> 00:43:34,513
And if you're like a beginner level designer, I would say most beginners forget to do the

845
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:39,517
fill part, and if you're starting out, you should err on the side of more fill than less

846
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:39,898
fill.

847
00:43:41,854 --> 00:43:46,939
And then lastly, I have a rim light, also kind of picking out the right side of his

848
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,883
face there and help separating that from the background so you can read his features better.

849
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:58,340
And as for implementation, here I'm actually using three directional lights in Unity, but

850
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:03,544
just with the layer mask set to just one layer just for that object.

851
00:44:03,624 --> 00:44:07,227
So it ends up being not that expensive if you use the culling masks.

852
00:44:08,247 --> 00:44:11,950
In Unreal, you can use a feature called light channels, which kind of does the same thing.

853
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,192
It's super useful for isolating light sources for objects.

854
00:44:15,933 --> 00:44:21,637
But most games end up doing just maybe one light source technically, with the key light

855
00:44:21,657 --> 00:44:26,901
might be your main directional light, but your fill might be ambient or spherical harmonics

856
00:44:26,961 --> 00:44:31,845
probes, and then your rim light might be Fresnel and reflection and stuff in your shader.

857
00:44:35,181 --> 00:44:38,723
But I think there's one big problem with three-point light

858
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,604
theory for games, especially in regards to level design.

859
00:44:42,244 --> 00:44:46,706
And that is the fact that film and photography have a very

860
00:44:46,806 --> 00:44:48,907
tightly controlled camera perspective.

861
00:44:49,367 --> 00:44:51,548
But in video games, we often give camera

862
00:44:51,568 --> 00:44:52,689
control to the player.

863
00:44:53,469 --> 00:44:56,250
So if you were looking at this hunky dude,

864
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,631
and then you walk around and admire

865
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:01,592
the back of this hunky dude, now the key light

866
00:45:01,792 --> 00:45:03,993
isn't a key light anymore, because the viewing angle

867
00:45:04,013 --> 00:45:04,574
has changed.

868
00:45:04,874 --> 00:45:06,634
Now my rim light is like a key light.

869
00:45:06,915 --> 00:45:09,716
Now my fill light isn't visible or something.

870
00:45:09,736 --> 00:45:11,857
I don't even know what's going on in that image anymore.

871
00:45:12,557 --> 00:45:17,059
So one big problem here is that we can't really

872
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:20,600
know where the player is going to see this object, which

873
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,421
will affect how we compose our lighting.

874
00:45:24,362 --> 00:45:28,947
This is why a lot of 3D games, I think, end up vomiting rim shaders and Fresnel effects

875
00:45:29,067 --> 00:45:33,091
everywhere because they can't predict where the player's going to be looking at this object,

876
00:45:33,172 --> 00:45:39,458
so they just spam Fresnel and rim everywhere so that there's always some rim action going

877
00:45:39,618 --> 00:45:39,698
on.

878
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,581
But, you know, that should be your last resort.

879
00:45:42,622 --> 00:45:44,283
Let's try to be more subtle than that.

880
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,822
And I would argue the way you can be more subtle is to think about how your level layout

881
00:45:51,002 --> 00:45:56,885
will facilitate the viewing angles for your subjects and then you can light accordingly

882
00:45:56,945 --> 00:45:58,566
and use that as a framing device.

883
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:02,428
So your level layout is a lighting tool.

884
00:46:03,308 --> 00:46:09,332
You can suggest a view or frame a certain composition just by having the player move

885
00:46:09,372 --> 00:46:11,793
through a hallway and that will suggest an angle for them.

886
00:46:13,373 --> 00:46:18,595
That's also why you need to do a little bit of block out and block meshing before you

887
00:46:18,635 --> 00:46:22,116
do some lighting so that you have an idea of where the player is going to be going.

888
00:46:25,596 --> 00:46:32,078
And lastly I want to end with this section, how to light a level, and I want to walk you

889
00:46:32,138 --> 00:46:36,579
through some steps that I would recommend you take with your own levels if you're starting

890
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:36,759
out.

891
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,540
This example will be in Unreal, but you can do it in any engine basically.

892
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:48,435
So first, you do your blockout or gray box or whatever you want to call it with just

893
00:46:48,455 --> 00:46:49,797
some basic real-time light.

894
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:53,921
If you're doing some light baking, you don't want to do it at this stage because your level

895
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:55,042
is constantly changing.

896
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:59,126
You don't want to waste your time spending an hour lighting a room and then you end up

897
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:00,567
deleting that room or something.

898
00:47:00,587 --> 00:47:01,668
Then you've wasted your time.

899
00:47:02,209 --> 00:47:06,272
So right here is when I recommend you just use some basic real-time light and not worry

900
00:47:06,312 --> 00:47:07,413
about the lighting so much.

901
00:47:08,134 --> 00:47:14,100
For Unreal, I like switching it, using stationary lights for this, and I also like enabling

902
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:19,325
a setting called force no pre-computed lighting, which will help you not worry about light

903
00:47:19,385 --> 00:47:21,567
mapping and light map baking and stuff.

904
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:24,688
And that's in the world settings in the Unreal Editor.

905
00:47:25,128 --> 00:47:27,249
And in Unity, I like using real-time lights,

906
00:47:27,649 --> 00:47:31,111
and I disable the auto-generate lighting checkbox

907
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:34,532
so that you're not constantly sitting and waiting and stopping

908
00:47:34,932 --> 00:47:36,653
for the light maps to bake.

909
00:47:38,113 --> 00:47:40,554
Although I hear the light map's faster now or something.

910
00:47:40,574 --> 00:47:40,994
I don't know.

911
00:47:44,056 --> 00:47:44,476
Step two.

912
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:48,867
Now you want to set up your main mood, your big mood in your scene.

913
00:47:49,628 --> 00:47:52,852
And to do that you want to set up your global lights.

914
00:47:52,972 --> 00:47:57,558
So remember ambient and directional, those apply to your whole entire game world.

915
00:47:57,598 --> 00:48:01,482
So now's maybe the time to set that up before you worry about smaller stuff.

916
00:48:02,907 --> 00:48:07,329
And here you can see I have a bunch of sunlight flooding in from those middle windows right

917
00:48:07,369 --> 00:48:07,549
here.

918
00:48:08,369 --> 00:48:15,073
And I want to set up the main mood of this level with like a big sunny sun-filled area.

919
00:48:15,753 --> 00:48:22,296
And to do that I need to set up the indirect light bounces, especially for directional

920
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,017
light or sunlight.

921
00:48:23,657 --> 00:48:27,419
If you want something to feel like sunlight, you should be paying attention to your indirect

922
00:48:27,459 --> 00:48:28,259
light bounce settings.

923
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,087
In Unity, that would be going to your light settings, and in Unreal, that would involve

924
00:48:33,107 --> 00:48:37,396
going to your world settings and adjust the lightmass section of the world settings, and

925
00:48:37,496 --> 00:48:40,563
also look at the skylight actor in your Unreal scene.

926
00:48:42,104 --> 00:48:46,867
And if you're not working with global illumination or light map baking for whatever reason, then

927
00:48:46,907 --> 00:48:51,710
the next best thing is to hand place invisible, faint point lights everywhere.

928
00:48:53,051 --> 00:48:58,675
If you're working on a game like, I hear there's a rumor that Fallout 4 did not have global

929
00:48:58,695 --> 00:49:05,979
illumination so they had to place faint point lights to simulate and fake all the sunlight

930
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:06,920
bouncing everywhere.

931
00:49:07,661 --> 00:49:09,001
So you can totally do that as well.

932
00:49:11,095 --> 00:49:14,798
In Unity, I like switching those lights to not important so that they don't contribute

933
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:15,658
to specular stuff.

934
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:20,061
And in Unreal, I like increasing the minimum roughness on those lights so that they don't

935
00:49:20,622 --> 00:49:22,063
create hot spots in your reflections.

936
00:49:25,478 --> 00:49:29,962
Then step three, after you've kind of set up the main mood of your scene, now you should

937
00:49:30,002 --> 00:49:33,225
start thinking about the gameplay and lighting for your critical path.

938
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:38,529
To review, the critical path is kind of like the ideal things that your ideal player would

939
00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:41,672
kind of do in a certain order or whatever in your level.

940
00:49:43,015 --> 00:49:47,437
And at this stage, you should probably focus on navigation and wayfinding.

941
00:49:48,077 --> 00:49:52,839
Does the player know various entrances and exits and know where they are?

942
00:49:53,299 --> 00:49:57,520
David talked about this a lot in his talk, about how they care a lot about wayfinding.

943
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,561
Lighting is another tool for you to do that.

944
00:49:59,941 --> 00:50:06,083
And here, I'm using it in a really painfully obvious way, where I'm using bright orange

945
00:50:06,283 --> 00:50:08,224
lights on bright red doors.

946
00:50:09,984 --> 00:50:16,211
Feel free to be more subtle than that in your own work, but for the purposes of this example,

947
00:50:16,532 --> 00:50:17,713
it's super obvious.

948
00:50:19,512 --> 00:50:25,994
And when you're doing that, I also urge you to think about kind of like the hierarchy of different things you're doing here.

949
00:50:26,554 --> 00:50:32,416
Here, I would argue the left door is being lit to be more important than the door on the right.

950
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:38,637
The door on the left kind of has a wider spotlight and it's more intense and brighter and also kind of has its own room and shadow.

951
00:50:38,657 --> 00:50:40,398
So the contrast is much stronger.

952
00:50:40,798 --> 00:50:48,580
Meanwhile, that door on the right, it's certainly an option and it certainly reads as like an entrance or exit to this room, but it's also a bit more faint.

953
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:48,860
So.

954
00:50:49,261 --> 00:50:52,204
Now we're emphasizing this door on the left, super important.

955
00:50:52,404 --> 00:50:54,747
This door on the right, it's like okay.

956
00:50:55,047 --> 00:50:58,151
You know, it's an okay door, but you know, that door on the left, yeah.

957
00:51:01,217 --> 00:51:06,919
Then once you're done doing main player wayfinding, and also you're like testing throughout all of this, right,

958
00:51:07,779 --> 00:51:11,360
you should be thinking about the other interactions in your game.

959
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,221
So if you're setting up any NPCs or set pieces or encounters,

960
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:20,103
you should be trying to light those encounters so that the player will actually notice what's going on.

961
00:51:21,064 --> 00:51:25,926
So here, these are like critical gameplay objects that you might want to like, like

962
00:51:26,026 --> 00:51:31,068
enemies coming into the room, or maybe the enemies are like guarding an objective or

963
00:51:31,108 --> 00:51:31,648
something.

964
00:51:31,928 --> 00:51:34,129
So on the left, they're guarding this orb.

965
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:36,891
The orb is very important in this game, I assure you.

966
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:43,554
And I have, I've set up a blue, blue-green kind of turquoise light, and it's kind of

967
00:51:43,594 --> 00:51:48,376
coming at this perpendicular angle to that orange arrow, which is what I imagine as the

968
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:49,716
player's critical path in this.

969
00:51:50,437 --> 00:51:55,580
And when you have that blue light coming like a grazing perpendicular angle kind of,

970
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:02,525
that helps set that up as a rim light to help emphasize the shapes going on there instead of the surfaces.

971
00:52:03,698 --> 00:52:05,819
Kind of the same thing going on in the example on the right.

972
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,601
You might see two small people, two small silhouettes

973
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:10,442
in the background.

974
00:52:11,102 --> 00:52:13,823
And that's because I've kind of thrown a background

975
00:52:13,883 --> 00:52:14,864
light behind them.

976
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:17,865
So those silhouettes end up popping out,

977
00:52:17,985 --> 00:52:19,726
and you notice them really easily.

978
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:21,807
So again, if you're lighting stuff

979
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,829
where soldiers or enemies jump through windows or something,

980
00:52:25,049 --> 00:52:26,569
you might want to have a light behind them

981
00:52:26,589 --> 00:52:28,590
to help frame them and help them pop out.

982
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:36,234
And when you're doing this, you should be thinking about your texture pass.

983
00:52:37,896 --> 00:52:40,239
Texturing is pretty important.

984
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:44,665
I think that's why David talks about using color a lot. You should be thinking about the basic values.

985
00:52:45,546 --> 00:52:48,690
This is a page, I basically just took

986
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:51,293
these from some Unreal UDK documentation.

987
00:52:52,834 --> 00:52:57,716
Here the albedo on the left is really dark, and the albedo diffuse texture on the right is much brighter.

988
00:52:58,256 --> 00:53:02,217
And when you have that dark albedo, the light doesn't bounce as much,

989
00:53:02,398 --> 00:53:07,439
because most game engines use the albedo texture to calculate reflectance for indirect light.

990
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,541
So you can see that scene ends up feeling really, really dark in a weird way.

991
00:53:11,941 --> 00:53:15,122
But if you use a brighter albedo, in that bottom right example,

992
00:53:15,443 --> 00:53:19,164
now the scene is kind of evenly illuminated and it feels much more like sunlight.

993
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:24,126
And one really easy way to check this is if you open up your Albedo or Diffuse Texture in Photoshop,

994
00:53:24,446 --> 00:53:29,708
open up the Levels Histogram, look at that, most of your values should be more in the upper mid-range.

995
00:53:30,088 --> 00:53:34,489
And you usually want to leave the left and right, the extreme values, empty,

996
00:53:34,789 --> 00:53:39,071
so that lighting can do its work. So don't try to do extreme black or extreme white.

997
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,345
And, oh my god, I'm running out of time.

998
00:53:42,445 --> 00:53:43,226
OK, I'll try to go fast.

999
00:53:43,546 --> 00:53:47,408
So this is also where lighting is really, really important,

1000
00:53:47,468 --> 00:53:51,250
I think, where some stuff might be too dark,

1001
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,151
and some stuff might look great.

1002
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:57,574
And I think that has a very strong political valence to it.

1003
00:53:58,354 --> 00:54:02,498
This is an example from an article called Black Skin is Still a Radical Concept in Video Games.

1004
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:08,824
And in this one, the woman on the right from Skyrim, I would argue, is lit pretty well.

1005
00:54:09,305 --> 00:54:12,368
You can read all the different contours and surface planes of her face.

1006
00:54:12,768 --> 00:54:18,874
Meanwhile, the woman on the left is lit very poorly, I think, where I can't really read her face that well.

1007
00:54:19,454 --> 00:54:21,677
Her chin and jaw are totally lost.

1008
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:29,690
I'm not trying to call out Skyrim or Bethesda.

1009
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:33,631
I don't think there was an evil racist at Bethesda going, ha ha ha.

1010
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:40,993
I think this was just another example of institutional racism that happens in video games where maybe

1011
00:54:41,373 --> 00:54:46,574
playtesters were testing mostly with white characters, so they never saw that black characters

1012
00:54:46,734 --> 00:54:52,015
are lit really poorly in this game, or need more specular contribution on their reflection

1013
00:54:52,075 --> 00:54:54,056
or light probes or whatever is going on in Skyrim.

1014
00:54:56,439 --> 00:54:58,804
It's important for us to take responsibility for our art,

1015
00:54:59,105 --> 00:55:01,992
and if in doubt, just ask a collaborator

1016
00:55:02,072 --> 00:55:04,197
so that you can kind of avoid situations like these.

1017
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:12,700
And then the last step is you should maybe iterate on your level, keep trying different

1018
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,521
lighting schemes.

1019
00:55:14,441 --> 00:55:18,982
And this is an example of a sci-fi scene that's lit four different ways.

1020
00:55:19,102 --> 00:55:23,303
So keep experimenting with your lighting, but at the same time, know when to stop and

1021
00:55:23,363 --> 00:55:24,263
move on with your life.

1022
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,744
This is a trap that a lot of level designers fall into.

1023
00:55:27,764 --> 00:55:31,485
They keep tweaking lights a little bit brighter, a little bit darker, as if that'll make a

1024
00:55:31,525 --> 00:55:32,165
huge difference.

1025
00:55:32,285 --> 00:55:32,905
It will not.

1026
00:55:33,385 --> 00:55:33,985
I guarantee you.

1027
00:55:34,025 --> 00:55:36,866
Just make the lights as good as you can.

1028
00:55:37,206 --> 00:55:38,027
And then move on.

1029
00:55:38,047 --> 00:55:39,910
You may come back to it later if you have more time.

1030
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:41,072
You won't have more time.

1031
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:43,155
But go back to it later.

1032
00:55:43,675 --> 00:55:44,777
Just say that to yourself.

1033
00:55:45,097 --> 00:55:45,718
And move on.

1034
00:55:45,778 --> 00:55:47,220
And make the rest of your game.

1035
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:50,164
So to review real quick.

1036
00:55:51,633 --> 00:55:53,214
Lighting sets mood and evokes culture.

1037
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:57,497
There's four different light types common to a lot of 3D game engines and tool sets.

1038
00:55:58,177 --> 00:56:01,900
Three-point lighting argues that you should think about the task and function of each light

1039
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:03,861
and what it's doing for the image composition.

1040
00:56:04,882 --> 00:56:05,702
Light globally.

1041
00:56:05,923 --> 00:56:11,126
Do your big lights first and then do start doing spot checks for gameplay and critical path.

1042
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:16,810
And also know when to stop fiddling with your lights and move on and make your game

1043
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:18,971
and don't just keep fiddling with one light.

1044
00:56:20,591 --> 00:56:21,893
Thanks for listening. That was me.

1045
00:56:23,877 --> 00:56:24,218
Applause.
