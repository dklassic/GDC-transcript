00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:12,161
Hi everyone, my name is Vladimir and I'm here to give you my talk called Aesthetic Driven Development

2
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:16,802
or basically how we started making an art before we made a game,

3
00:00:16,802 --> 00:00:19,662
how it worked out for us and how you can do the same.

4
00:00:19,662 --> 00:00:25,023
So before we actually proceed, I wanted to give you some background information on who I am,

5
00:00:25,023 --> 00:00:26,704
or rather who we are.

6
00:00:26,704 --> 00:00:29,464
I run a studio of two people called Cold Wild Games.

7
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:35,045
It is located in Riga, Latvia, and my partner Helen, she does art and writing.

8
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:37,987
and I do pretty much everything else.

9
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:41,609
Occasionally we hire freelancers to do the music for us.

10
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,290
We've been making games since 2016

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,573
and we also own a pair of cockatiels

12
00:00:48,573 --> 00:00:51,454
or weerobirds for our Australian friends.

13
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:55,877
The cage is a metaphor for us working from home

14
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:59,419
even though they leave it much more often than we do.

15
00:00:59,419 --> 00:01:02,240
And all further images and tweets in this presentation

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,501
were made by...

17
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:06,712
Helen, that's her Twitter handle there below.

18
00:01:06,712 --> 00:01:15,074
Anyway, so to give a bit more background, before 2019s the game development processes

19
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:18,034
for us was rather straightforward.

20
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:23,215
We would build a prototype that we enjoyed playing, then we would start figuring out

21
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:26,956
the graphics, essentially it turned out into the game.

22
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:31,377
We've made three more or less serious games up to this point.

23
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:40,651
they had a very moderate success. For what it's worth our most successful game called Lazy Galaxy

24
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:48,212
has achieved 6 000 sales over two years and I suppose some of you who might be watching this

25
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:56,214
presentation they might cry over those numbers and that's all right actually. I still think

26
00:01:56,214 --> 00:02:01,395
it's not it would not be enough to maintain the studio, sustain the studio by itself. So

27
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:05,309
the move was to change the approach.

28
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:08,774
And one of the things that we did in 2019,

29
00:02:08,774 --> 00:02:11,177
rather than start building a prototype

30
00:02:11,177 --> 00:02:12,980
with gameplay in mind,

31
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,623
we focused on aesthetics and art first

32
00:02:15,623 --> 00:02:18,968
and found out what our audience liked.

33
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:26,591
And to fast forward a bit, the game has sold around 10,000 copies in 7 months, so the real

34
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:33,832
bankruptcy that is threatening us is the moral bankruptcy probably, and the only one so far.

35
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:39,313
So I actually believe this happened because we focused on creating the attractive art

36
00:02:39,313 --> 00:02:42,374
first, before we actually began making the game.

37
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:53,221
And in this talk, I'll try to outline the process and approach of how we did it and how you can systematically try to do the same.

38
00:02:53,221 --> 00:03:04,608
Right, so first of all, in 2018, while I was porting the game, our previous game, to consoles, Helen did not have much to do.

39
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:11,933
And I just essentially told her to draw in the...

40
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:20,877
Octobit trend which started in October which basically involved environment as a subject and

41
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:25,604
each daily image would require an artist to draw a

42
00:03:25,604 --> 00:03:26,565
painting using

43
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:33,791
more colors than before. So there was a color limit, there was also a time constraint on one day

44
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:40,674
to make an evening, to make a posting and for most days she tried to post it on one time,

45
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:48,077
at one similar time, it was in the evenings, so that both European and American audiences would

46
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:55,800
see it. But since I treat the games as an art more than a business, but at the same time

47
00:03:56,814 --> 00:04:02,678
I don't want to dry of hunger, I decided to approach this whole thing as an experiment

48
00:04:02,678 --> 00:04:04,940
to see where it leads to us.

49
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:12,165
The idea is to make something that everybody likes, us and people who would play our games,

50
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:15,467
and then to see if the game can materialize.

51
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:16,388
Right.

52
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:23,793
So after this, if we treat it as an experiment, we need some sort of a criteria to evaluate

53
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:24,353
the results.

54
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:35,580
I think we've created, well I've created, four different things that I want to evaluate the games, the art with.

55
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:48,805
First of all, I think we both of us need to like something that has been created, because as a studio of two people, it makes sense that both of us would like working on something together.

56
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:55,435
and I think for the smaller indie studios it's much easier to come to an agreement and to find

57
00:04:55,435 --> 00:05:02,280
something that everyone in team is passionate about. Afterwards we would look at the response

58
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,965
on Twitter. How has the image been perceived? At every slide I will try to give the amount of likes,

59
00:05:08,965 --> 00:05:18,292
retweets and comments about user reaction and how they would like the image or not.

60
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:18,792
Overall...

61
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,381
the ease of creation also matters,

62
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:26,223
because if you think about it, we're a two people team,

63
00:05:26,223 --> 00:05:32,665
so we would need a way to make hundreds of assets together,

64
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,987
either to establish a soulless asset production container,

65
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:40,449
or just to include our limitation

66
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,709
to create the quality games.

67
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,811
Pick whichever you like out of these two.

68
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:53,140
So we really wanted to have a chance to create the art that looks decent but would not take

69
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:59,483
so much effort that we'd never publish a game. Afterwards we would also consider the game design

70
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:05,966
constraints because even if the image is created it kind of implies the style of the game that you

71
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:12,649
can come up with and not images are equally appropriate for different game types. And we

72
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:15,390
don't like all the genres so...

73
00:06:16,907 --> 00:06:20,056
We have those four things, but what are the baselines?

74
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:24,909
I think it's hard to measure liking or disliking images by themselves, so...

75
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:32,891
To take it as a baseline, our usual game-related tweets had maybe under 20 likes, 1 or 2 comments,

76
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:37,552
mostly from our friends, thank you, and 1 to 5 retweets.

77
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:42,433
And I wish I'd say I was cherry-picking those ones here, but to be honest, this is what

78
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:44,334
the usual tweets look like.

79
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:47,394
I kind of like them, but I'm the biased guy here.

80
00:06:47,394 --> 00:06:53,116
So the idea is we would look for everything that is better than that at the time.

81
00:06:55,353 --> 00:07:01,796
Helen had roughly 500 followers at the start of the experiment and close to 1000 or a bit

82
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,176
more at the end of it.

83
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:04,697
So how did it go?

84
00:07:04,697 --> 00:07:11,380
I'll try to give some descriptions of the images that turned out and why they did or

85
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,080
did not work out.

86
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,262
And for example, let's start with this one.

87
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:19,043
I call this the forest hut.

88
00:07:19,043 --> 00:07:20,443
Let me move myself here.

89
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:23,886
So this is the forest hut, and I think both of us

90
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:24,766
like this one.

91
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:27,088
The response was also pretty good,

92
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:30,230
with 72 likes and 12 retweets.

93
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,791
But if you think about it, it's not easy

94
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,073
to create something like this.

95
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:38,034
First of all, this is an isometric perspective,

96
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:43,177
and pixel art is kind of harder with isometric perspective.

97
00:07:43,177 --> 00:07:48,941
And plus the amount of details here is a bit,

98
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:50,882
well, that's a lot of detail, to be honest.

99
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:56,880
So even though we could imagine it being a part of some tactical RPG game,

100
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:03,365
it's ultimately a pass for us because we would not be able to afford to create a game like this.

101
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:06,907
Everyone's situation is different, but this is how I would evaluate it.

102
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:14,872
Then we had a stork and personally I'm a huge fan of the birds. I think Helen likes birds too.

103
00:08:14,872 --> 00:08:21,320
And the stork had a good amount of likes and retweets, but again this color palette was...

104
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,125
it was kind of tricky to make it right.

105
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:34,070
But even then, the resolution is lower than the previous images, but what kind of game do you imagine with this asset?

106
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:45,099
Maybe it would be a decent puzzle game, but it's not really our genre and who makes non-erotic puzzle games in 2020, so that's an all.

107
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:47,001
Next, the market.

108
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:55,673
So, we liked it and I personally really liked the vibrant colors and overall it just seemed

109
00:08:55,673 --> 00:09:01,098
aesthetically pleasing to look at, plus it was not very hard to make, but what killed

110
00:09:01,098 --> 00:09:07,183
this one was the amount of attention, because only 33 likes and 1 retweet comparing to what

111
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:12,367
we've been getting before was clearly not enough for us to actually consider it as a

112
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:15,170
possible game art, even though both of us liked it.

113
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:24,292
Next are the ruins and I personally did not like it that much, so opinions were different,

114
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:30,695
but it had a lot of attention, but then again on the other side I don't think it would be easy

115
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:37,078
to create this because of the higher resolution and the amount of detail. So that's a pass.

116
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:43,624
In the end of the experiment we had a few images that would fit as the game sprites

117
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:50,329
and I wanted to go through some of those concepts just to show the way how I think.

118
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:56,653
First of all, two of them are isometric, which as you might have guessed from before is a

119
00:09:56,653 --> 00:10:00,415
point of skepticism for me, but I'm not against isometric images per se.

120
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,962
If we look at the windmill on the left,

121
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:05,762
or is it watermill?

122
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:06,823
Yeah, this is the watermill.

123
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:10,446
If we look at the watermill on the left,

124
00:10:10,446 --> 00:10:15,329
it still looks kind of generic, despite the good reply,

125
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:18,231
and you would probably not remember looking at it.

126
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:22,194
The waterfall is a bit more appealing,

127
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:24,976
but again, it's hard to imagine the type of game

128
00:10:24,976 --> 00:10:26,938
that I would put it into.

129
00:10:26,938 --> 00:10:27,738
On the other hand...

130
00:10:28,197 --> 00:10:32,179
Why we like the temple? There are a few reasons for that.

131
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:41,784
First of all, the temple offers the unique style and for the artists who only start to do something like this,

132
00:10:41,784 --> 00:10:47,567
for us, we are really struggling with the style for our games because

133
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:53,710
sometimes you feel like you can draw but it's not really memorable enough or distinguishable enough and...

134
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,920
Finding the right style for the artist is the real struggle.

135
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,981
And we still haven't figured it out in the end,

136
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:02,362
but it felt like the right step in the right direction.

137
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,043
Plus, if you think about it,

138
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:09,004
the temple consists of small, replicable geometric shapes

139
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:12,945
that you can use for other types of buildings or the world.

140
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:14,746
So ultimately, I think in this case,

141
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:17,227
the temple was a goal for these reasons.

142
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:25,837
So, we liked the floating temple and what do we do next?

143
00:11:25,837 --> 00:11:27,638
For me, I don't feel comfortable diving

144
00:11:27,638 --> 00:11:29,439
into the project right away.

145
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,900
And I think it makes sense to do some more

146
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,621
experimentations without huge commitment.

147
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:39,463
And for us, the logical step would be to take idea further.

148
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:41,564
And Helen spent a few hours to just draw

149
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:44,686
how the trees of this world would look like.

150
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:51,110
And she put it on Twitter again with more relevant tags like pixelart and gamedev at that point

151
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:59,698
and it still got a pretty decent response, very decent for us, 105 likes. That kind of validated

152
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:06,224
the idea and served as a positive sign to show us that we may need to pursue the idea further.

153
00:12:07,135 --> 00:12:11,959
The next and somewhat a final step before creating the actual prototype for us

154
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:16,782
is to commit even more of our time and resources into this.

155
00:12:16,782 --> 00:12:23,227
Helen drew ships and some more potential islands, how they would look in the game.

156
00:12:23,227 --> 00:12:31,353
We combined them into small sequences of presumably gameplay gifs or concept art.

157
00:12:31,353 --> 00:12:34,735
Let me move myself.

158
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:36,377
And every one of them.

159
00:12:37,274 --> 00:12:39,955
had quite a bit of attention.

160
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:43,177
I mostly made those GIFs on my Saturdays and Sundays

161
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:45,558
and posted them on Screenshot Saturday

162
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:47,479
just to see how people responded,

163
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,260
and response was quite well.

164
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,481
In total, we spent roughly two months

165
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:52,821
for this whole process.

166
00:12:52,821 --> 00:12:55,362
It was 25 workdays before,

167
00:12:55,362 --> 00:12:58,524
between drawing and choosing,

168
00:12:58,524 --> 00:13:01,285
then roughly 15 part-time days

169
00:13:01,285 --> 00:13:04,947
to validating our idea further with those GIFs.

170
00:13:04,947 --> 00:13:05,287
And,

171
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:13,732
I think overall those 40 days is a bit more than 25% of the time that we spent on the

172
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:16,833
project together before the Early Access launch.

173
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:22,554
I think I treated it as an investment and you should too if you do something like this

174
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:31,216
because it allowed us to find the audience for the project before we actually started

175
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:31,796
to work on it.

176
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:37,874
In the end, it just allows us to work on something that both we and audiences want.

177
00:13:37,874 --> 00:13:44,324
Of course, if you can afford it, expanding this window of finding art is definitely worth it, I think.

178
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:49,371
Because this can be beneficial and open more options to you.

179
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:55,990
Of course, you still need some constraints to stay focused, because, for example, I don't

180
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,232
think I would do it more than 3 months in advance, because there should be like this

181
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:05,315
stop sign and point where you decide, I like this art and we should give it a go.

182
00:14:07,741 --> 00:14:13,443
Anyway, so we have the art and it becomes clear that audience really likes this style and want more.

183
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:16,684
So, what actually happens with the game?

184
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:24,948
And I think at this point you really need to acknowledge the potential art style effects on the gameplay right from the start.

185
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:30,950
Because in our case, like you see this horizontal building overlay and display.

186
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:40,400
I was maybe thinking of something like Kingdom at the start, but I wanted to make a more complex building chains

187
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,162
And it becomes clear that you cannot have a lot of those buildings on screen at the same time

188
00:14:45,162 --> 00:14:45,242
so

189
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:51,610
you cannot put a very complex production chain into the game

190
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,991
with limited screen space because then player would need to scroll around the

191
00:14:55,991 --> 00:14:56,991
screen a lot

192
00:14:56,991 --> 00:15:00,872
and it definitely affects the gameplay experience and user experience and

193
00:15:00,872 --> 00:15:05,433
I was against it. If you think about, we also wanted to create it

194
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:08,234
as a non-violent game, just our preference, but if you

195
00:15:08,234 --> 00:15:09,294
consider the...

196
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:17,572
combat based game prototype, then 2D combat, even if it is a strategic game, can become quite limited.

197
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:25,636
So, overall, I think hitting the right notes with art might seem like a treasure, but

198
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:31,799
if you can find the gameplay ideas with it, if we would not be able to find the fun gameplay ideas with it, we would not continue it.

199
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:38,803
But, limiting the amount of buildings to 6 or 7 per screen

200
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:43,962
did wonders for us because that allowed us to look for other options.

201
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:49,246
So the constraint is what game would you make if you had six or seven buildings

202
00:15:49,246 --> 00:15:53,850
on the screen or on the level at the same time?

203
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,393
And I think it contributed to the next step for us.

204
00:15:57,393 --> 00:16:01,957
So we can't have many islands, those small isles on one screen,

205
00:16:01,957 --> 00:16:06,221
and but we still want some sort of a management game.

206
00:16:06,221 --> 00:16:06,921
What do we do?

207
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:14,719
In our case we added this map as a sort of a glue to connect the islands together and

208
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:21,143
it really added this exploration aspect into the game which made the map exploration and

209
00:16:21,143 --> 00:16:25,885
trading way more fun because players would be able to find different spots on the map

210
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:33,070
with different prices on the goods and then sell them or buy them in a profitable manner.

211
00:16:34,148 --> 00:16:38,956
The map with free movement also allows us to add more quests or just more memorable

212
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:44,706
islands that would not serve a lot of the gameplay purpose but more of an experience

213
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:48,152
purpose because we want players to experience the game.

214
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:54,287
So overall I think this glue worked because of the constraints that we've set first from

215
00:16:54,287 --> 00:17:01,836
the art style and then from our own artificial constraints based on this island amount per screen

216
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:07,141
and I realize that if you look at this presentation you might think wow this has been easy like

217
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:16,553
You can figure those things out and maybe you are right, but for us it was a real struggle to come up with something that is both pretty and playable,

218
00:17:16,553 --> 00:17:24,983
because I don't want to take away the fun from the gameplay, but it sometimes is still very hard to come up with something potentially fun for other players.

219
00:17:26,116 --> 00:17:30,341
Anyway, so you have something that people like and what happens next?

220
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:35,767
For us, since it became clear that audience likes what we are doing, we've tried to

221
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:42,315
capitalize on those pretty graphics and we've created the Steam page, I think, two or...

222
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:46,516
two and a half months after we started actively developing the game.

223
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:51,979
At this stage we just made a simple 30-second trailer from all of the features that we had

224
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:58,022
in the game at that point, rather in the prototype, and there were five screenshots.

225
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,479
The point was to start gathering wishlists.

226
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:05,080
So we published the Steam page and as soon as we had something new, we would post it

227
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,101
on Twitter and update the Steam page with screenshots.

228
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:13,243
Thus, it would lead people to wishlist the game or just get us more attention of the

229
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:13,903
game.

230
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:17,044
Another vital point for me was the remake of trailers.

231
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:22,606
The first trailer was really very simple, but then, as time progressed, I was updating

232
00:18:22,606 --> 00:18:28,068
the trailers, re-uploading them, re-announcing them and it also gave us a bit more media

233
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:33,304
If I can say the word media, mostly it's people were retweeting it or just looking

234
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:34,264
at on YouTube.

235
00:18:34,264 --> 00:18:38,405
So I think the innovations were a good thing.

236
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:46,988
On the downside, I think we had some of the complaints that on game launch was that people

237
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:50,449
have seen everything on our Twitter before they've launched the game.

238
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:55,590
But it was the minority and actually that's a valid argument and we've tried to be more

239
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,471
secretive about our development later on.

240
00:18:58,111 --> 00:19:05,117
So we have a Steam page with directed audiences from Twitter, from Screenshot Saturday, from Pixelart tags to our game.

241
00:19:05,117 --> 00:19:11,482
And also the Weather Factory studio helped quite a lot with their Twitter exposure.

242
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:23,733
So in the end when the game was nearing its launch, we had roughly 5,000 wishlists in 5 months and we launched the game in Early Access.

243
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:35,154
What happens then? The results were quite good because we had close to 6,000 sales in the first two months.

244
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:36,715
It hit 10,000 sales by January 2020.

245
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:43,360
So we also got covered by some bigger youtubers, which I've never dreamed to be covered by and

246
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,265
our community has doubled in size, which sounds way cooler than it is. It was

247
00:19:49,265 --> 00:19:51,326
150 more people who we all like.

248
00:19:51,326 --> 00:19:51,707
And

249
00:19:53,645 --> 00:19:57,088
I didn't run any paid marketing, maybe...

250
00:19:57,088 --> 00:20:00,871
No, I've run some ads on Facebook and on Reddit.

251
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:03,814
Overall it was under $20 total.

252
00:20:03,814 --> 00:20:05,856
So I mostly relied on organic marketing.

253
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:09,699
I think having a pretty style allowed for this

254
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:13,002
because otherwise it never worked for us before

255
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:14,984
in the same manner.

256
00:20:14,984 --> 00:20:17,126
So you might be thinking about it

257
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:20,109
and feeling like we've shot in the dark.

258
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:22,558
hoping that we would hit something.

259
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:24,721
And you might be true.

260
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:28,468
So these are not tested suggestions or improvements

261
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:31,473
how I would try to adjust the process if I do it again,

262
00:20:31,473 --> 00:20:33,917
when I do it again, rather.

263
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:34,017
So.

264
00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:40,125
First of all, I think setting art constraints would make more sense, for example, if you

265
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:45,247
ask your artist to only draw RTS units, or if you're talking about pixel art, you might

266
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:51,610
also set the resolution, maybe don't make sprites more than 64x64, and I'm still stretching

267
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,951
it, that's too much actually, but yeah, it's really up to you.

268
00:20:54,951 --> 00:21:01,114
Also as I mentioned before, the longer experimentation would probably mean a bigger pool of potentially

269
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:04,475
successful results, but it also implies higher costs for you.

270
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,461
The other thing that was mentioned by me in the beginning,

271
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:16,142
I think it was the Kickstarter, just to validate your idea, but now if you ask me,

272
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:20,323
I never had a chance to run a Kickstarter from Latvia, but if you ask me, I think Kickstarter

273
00:21:20,323 --> 00:21:26,345
should be launched together with the Steam page, together with Lists, so Kickstarter is still the

274
00:21:26,345 --> 00:21:28,725
next step, a bit further after you've validated your idea.

275
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:35,182
Maybe if you want to have a cleaner result, avoid tagging popular accounts like Pixel

276
00:21:35,182 --> 00:21:40,328
Dailies, because every tweet by them would mean a netflux of likes, but it would also skew your

277
00:21:40,328 --> 00:21:47,177
data and statistics in not so favorable manner. So you would not be able to make a good decision.

278
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:51,478
Also, the last slide is viewer discretion.

279
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,999
I was thinking maybe I should put it on the first one,

280
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:57,420
but I think it makes sense if I talk about it in the end,

281
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,260
when you know all the context.

282
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,381
So after I posted something similar on Reddit,

283
00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:03,622
there was a comment that I'm the manager type

284
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:07,543
who don't know much, and then I complained to my friend,

285
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:09,603
and then my friend said that it makes sense.

286
00:22:09,603 --> 00:22:11,044
And I actually agree with it now,

287
00:22:11,044 --> 00:22:13,965
because essentially what I'm trying to present to you

288
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:17,766
is the sample size of one, which worked for us,

289
00:22:17,766 --> 00:22:18,426
and the.

290
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:21,523
What is the guarantee that it's going to work again?

291
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:26,607
Nonetheless, here are some of my arguments

292
00:22:26,607 --> 00:22:29,909
which I would use to counter this argument.

293
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:33,632
First of all, we've made a few games before

294
00:22:33,632 --> 00:22:34,933
that did not use this process

295
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:37,634
and it did not work out as well for us.

296
00:22:37,634 --> 00:22:40,677
This is somewhat different than just drawing concept art

297
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:41,157
because...

298
00:22:42,587 --> 00:22:45,389
With concept art you know what you are drawing, essentially.

299
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:48,312
You know the ideas that you are going to have in your game.

300
00:22:48,312 --> 00:22:53,117
Here you just draw something and hoping that it would fit the game.

301
00:22:53,117 --> 00:22:55,219
But it's not necessarily a bad thing.

302
00:22:55,219 --> 00:22:59,823
At least not for us, if you want to approach it in a more artistic way.

303
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:05,304
Also I think David Wheel, I hope I pronounced your surname correctly, but in GDC 2019 he

304
00:23:05,304 --> 00:23:11,449
had a good presentation where he also focused on marketing using visual aesthetics of the

305
00:23:11,449 --> 00:23:13,231
game and I think it really worked for him.

306
00:23:13,231 --> 00:23:19,197
So if you want to do something like that, do your research and be careful, that's all

307
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,138
I wanted to say.

308
00:23:21,138 --> 00:23:24,161
Overall, I think this will be it for me.

309
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:25,502
Thank you very much.

310
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:32,986
I know you cannot ask the questions directly during this time, or maybe you will be able to,

311
00:23:32,986 --> 00:23:38,790
but if you have anything, try to leave them in the video comments and I'll try to answer them.

312
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:43,775
There's this artist's Twitter handle if you have any questions for her or just want to follow her.

313
00:23:43,775 --> 00:23:47,598
Plus my email is... yeah.

314
00:23:47,785 --> 00:23:51,429
That's my email, if you want to know something, try to write it.

315
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:55,892
I usually answer within 2 weeks if I'm not super burned out.

316
00:23:55,892 --> 00:24:03,939
Overall, I want to thank you for watching this, your comments or critiques are welcome

317
00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:09,865
and I hope you have a nice year ahead of you and a nice life.

318
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,946
Vladimir is out.

319
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:11,026
Bye!
