1
00:00:06,245 --> 00:00:06,485
Hello.

2
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:07,605
Hi everyone.

3
00:00:07,986 --> 00:00:10,407
My name's Andy Nguyen, and this is gonna be a talk

4
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:12,988
about building community within open development,

5
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:16,090
but more specifically, how you can use community

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,072
as an additional tool to help you with your development.

7
00:00:19,912 --> 00:00:24,456
So, as a quick overview for the layout of the talk, I will talk about what I mean by

8
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:28,120
community development as opposed to community management.

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,964
Community management, I believe, is something more about maintaining what you already have,

10
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:36,627
and community development is more about integrating the community into your development process.

11
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:41,612
I'll talk about how it began, our most important tool that we're currently using for community

12
00:00:41,632 --> 00:00:44,635
development, which is Discord, and then how you can get started with it.

13
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:46,359
So who am I?

14
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,981
My name's Andy Nguyen.

15
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:50,865
I work at Pocket Watch Games as a producer and a designer.

16
00:00:51,506 --> 00:00:53,388
And we're most known for having released Monaco

17
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:55,831
back in 2013, for which I was the level designer.

18
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:59,195
And my most important role right now

19
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:01,598
for our current project is that of a business

20
00:01:01,658 --> 00:01:02,499
and community developer.

21
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:05,218
So our current project is Tooth and Tail.

22
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:06,699
It's a real-time strategy game.

23
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:07,340
It's not out yet.

24
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,682
And the goal of this game is we wanted

25
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:11,964
to make a real-time strategy game with simplified controls

26
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:13,405
that was playable on a controller.

27
00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:17,448
And the idea here is that real-time strategy games are

28
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:20,351
sort of notorious for having overly complex controls

29
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:21,532
or a high barrier to entry.

30
00:01:21,772 --> 00:01:23,834
And we wanted to see if we could make a real-time strategy game

31
00:01:23,854 --> 00:01:24,915
that was just as engaging.

32
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:30,820
though without that aspect of having to learn to play well in order to enjoy the game.

33
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:33,462
So here's a quick picture of what it looks like.

34
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:35,924
It's, you know, player versus player.

35
00:01:35,944 --> 00:01:37,726
You can play 1v1 or 2v2, etc.

36
00:01:38,646 --> 00:01:39,908
But more importantly, it's story time.

37
00:01:40,488 --> 00:01:43,751
So about six months ago, I was in Korea.

38
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:47,554
I flew out there for an event called BICFest, or Busan Indie Connect Festival,

39
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:49,556
and it was in Busan, South Korea.

40
00:01:50,885 --> 00:01:55,569
And I was having a great time, because it was one of the first times I've ever flown

41
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,390
out of the country.

42
00:01:56,971 --> 00:02:01,995
Though I was setting up shop by myself, and I found it really challenging to sort of communicate

43
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:03,336
how to play the game with new players.

44
00:02:04,117 --> 00:02:09,161
Even if we had sort of streamlined gameplay, it was not easy to talk to somebody who didn't

45
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:13,125
know English and explain how to play the game, how to explain the controls, etc.

46
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:19,175
So I'm kind of freaking out, and I'm trying to come up with my own way of describing how to play the game.

47
00:02:19,836 --> 00:02:25,723
And I know it's Korea, so the closest thing I ever got to communicating with them was I could point to the game and say StarCraft,

48
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:29,007
and they're like, oh, StarCraft, StarCraft. I'm like, okay, great. I'm like, let's one step closer.

49
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:32,391
And I could point to a work, and I'm like, SEV, and they're like, yeah, SEV.

50
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:34,930
Wow, I know like Korean words now.

51
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,191
But that's the closest thing I ever got

52
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:38,752
to actually teaching them how to play the game.

53
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:40,754
And so about 30 minutes in,

54
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:43,416
and I had to do this for like the whole weekend,

55
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:46,558
this individual comes up and he places his laptop

56
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,839
in between the monitors.

57
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,580
and there's an image of the controller.

58
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,801
And then he starts telling people how to play the game.

59
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:54,022
He's really enthusiastic.

60
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:56,743
He's cheering on one side, he's cheering on the other side.

61
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,023
He's telling them what to do.

62
00:02:58,063 --> 00:02:59,784
He's like, go attack him here, go do this here.

63
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,145
And then when he wins, he's like, GG.

64
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:02,985
And I was like, whoa, what is this?

65
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,386
He goes and takes a selfie with me.

66
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:07,087
He's extremely nervous and extremely shy.

67
00:03:08,007 --> 00:03:10,288
And he pulls up his phone, and through Google Translate,

68
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:11,768
he says, hi, I'm from the community,

69
00:03:11,888 --> 00:03:13,509
and I've traveled two hours here to help you.

70
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:18,250
This was one of the most amazing things I ever had happen

71
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,691
to me as a developer, because it saved me in that moment.

72
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:25,392
But it wasn't the first time something like this happened.

73
00:03:26,613 --> 00:03:28,233
Six months prior, back at PAX East,

74
00:03:28,713 --> 00:03:32,254
there was a Boston local named Chris, and he contacted us.

75
00:03:32,314 --> 00:03:34,895
And he said, hey, I'm in Boston, and I

76
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:36,616
was wondering if you wouldn't mind if I

77
00:03:36,636 --> 00:03:37,536
could help out at your booth.

78
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:41,394
So we let him, and it was a very simple volunteer job

79
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:43,275
where he got us water, got us food,

80
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,156
but he loved the game so much,

81
00:03:45,216 --> 00:03:46,937
and he was one of our best players at the time,

82
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:50,998
that having that extra pair of hands at a trade show

83
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,879
is incredibly valuable, and anyone here

84
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,160
who's demoed at a trade show will know how exhausting it is.

85
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:58,522
So to have somebody just help meant so much.

86
00:03:59,577 --> 00:04:05,241
And the thing that is still kind of unbelievable to us is next week is PAX East and we have

87
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:07,702
12 volunteers from our community coming to help us.

88
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:10,704
We actually expanded the size of our booth to accommodate them.

89
00:04:10,724 --> 00:04:13,366
I honestly don't know what to do about that.

90
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:18,269
But it made me feel like there was something special.

91
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,527
And I feel like everyone here can achieve something special too.

92
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:25,068
So the community within Tooth and Tail is a closed alpha,

93
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:26,869
meaning that we don't let everybody in.

94
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:28,970
And we've only been running it for about a year.

95
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,111
We've had 3,500 applications for this alpha.

96
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:37,913
And among those, there are 2,500 members who are part of

97
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:40,975
the community, of which 500 are online daily.

98
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,136
So these are very small numbers when I think about.

99
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:49,847
You know, some developers have Twitter followers in the tens of thousands or Facebook likes

100
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:51,510
in the hundreds of thousands.

101
00:04:52,132 --> 00:04:54,036
But I think a lot can come out of these small numbers.

102
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:56,560
So here are a few community examples.

103
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:59,823
Clash of Comrades is an organization

104
00:04:59,863 --> 00:05:01,285
that is entirely community-driven.

105
00:05:01,705 --> 00:05:03,807
In the beginning, we used to schedule our own tournaments,

106
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:05,828
but now they schedule their own tournaments themselves.

107
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:07,750
I think there's actually one going on right now.

108
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:09,792
They used to run these monthly,

109
00:05:09,832 --> 00:05:10,953
but now they run these weekly.

110
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:13,575
They coordinate the applications,

111
00:05:13,655 --> 00:05:14,736
they schedule all the times,

112
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:16,398
they stream it, they shoutcast it,

113
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:17,699
they create VODs and highlights,

114
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:19,400
they even produce their own prizes

115
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,341
and mail them out to people.

116
00:05:21,305 --> 00:05:24,142
They even informed us of other services so they

117
00:05:26,072 --> 00:05:31,094
helped us with discovery by showing us a service called Splice.gg which promotes eSports games.

118
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:35,476
We never intended for Tooth and Tail to be an eSports game because it's kind of silly

119
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:39,838
to think that an indie game could be something as big as, you know, the MOBAs of today.

120
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:41,679
And I'm not saying that we are.

121
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,180
That was never our intention.

122
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,281
But the fact that the community wanted to take this into their own hands and make it

123
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:51,203
something like that, I think, is quite amazing to us.

124
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:57,728
They take these matches that are played across multiple different patches and then they compile

125
00:05:57,768 --> 00:06:02,532
data and they send this data to us so then as the balance designer my life is made a

126
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:07,456
lot easier because I have data to work off of in terms of what's being played and what's

127
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:10,338
not being played or what's the success rate and what's not the success rate.

128
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:15,562
And I can just do my job and not have to worry about if I'm doing it right or not because

129
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:16,963
I'm constantly getting this feedback.

130
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:31,507
They've even gone so far as to help us with the troubleshooting process, because obviously nobody likes bugs, but rather than getting mad because the game crashes, they supply the information necessary to solve the crash.

131
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:43,031
And then before the crash is resolved, they even go to inform other community members about what the symptoms and causes of the crash are, so that they can be avoided or resolved on their own.

132
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:47,045
This is a product of having a community dialogue.

133
00:06:47,586 --> 00:06:50,508
And it also has the benefit of basically

134
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:51,869
having community troubleshooting.

135
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:54,851
So we don't have an FAQ because our FAQ is organic.

136
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:55,992
When people have questions,

137
00:06:56,032 --> 00:06:57,053
they're answered by the community.

138
00:06:58,274 --> 00:07:01,496
They even go ahead and make like strange memes of us

139
00:07:01,556 --> 00:07:03,218
and they like to spam it with the channel and stuff.

140
00:07:04,663 --> 00:07:06,684
So what is community development?

141
00:07:06,704 --> 00:07:08,205
And I think this is the key point here

142
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:09,445
versus community management.

143
00:07:09,865 --> 00:07:12,746
So for in our experience, what community development is,

144
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,426
is it's business development.

145
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:16,507
For example, this competitive scene

146
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:18,608
that was made organically,

147
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,909
which goes on to produce content, marketing content,

148
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:23,789
that we could spend time on our own

149
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:25,250
as a small development team making,

150
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,190
but we don't have to because they make it on their own.

151
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:31,232
It's game design because they're playtesting the game

152
00:07:31,272 --> 00:07:32,812
constantly and giving us this feedback.

153
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:36,193
And it's also a quality assurance because the moment

154
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,895
something happens across different platforms,

155
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:41,737
Mac, Linux, PC, or different types of hardware specs,

156
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:42,858
they let us know immediately.

157
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:44,659
And not only do they let us know,

158
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:45,920
they help us diagnose the problem

159
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,061
because the worst thing is when someone tells you a bug,

160
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,483
game crashed, and that's all you get.

161
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,424
You don't have any idea what to do about that.

162
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:55,266
So this is all supplied by the community

163
00:07:55,366 --> 00:07:56,467
and I like to think that...

164
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:03,482
as developers you can leverage the community as an additional tool to your development team.

165
00:08:06,378 --> 00:08:11,440
So our goals when we started out making Tooth and Tail

166
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,741
was we wanted to build a marketing machine.

167
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,442
Essentially we wanted to achieve

168
00:08:16,482 --> 00:08:17,902
the point of self-automation.

169
00:08:18,743 --> 00:08:23,364
And more specifically, the goal here is to get to the point

170
00:08:23,384 --> 00:08:25,685
where we can just focus on game development

171
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:27,746
because other aspects of development

172
00:08:27,786 --> 00:08:28,806
are handled by the community.

173
00:08:31,114 --> 00:08:37,303
This was inspired by a talk that I attended back in Steam Dev Days in 2014,

174
00:08:37,423 --> 00:08:38,845
where Tom Bui at Valve says,

175
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:45,995
the community will make games better because they can experiment and iterate at a much faster rate than you and I ever could.

176
00:08:47,422 --> 00:08:50,203
For example, we're a small team of three core members

177
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:50,943
at Pocketwatch.

178
00:08:51,383 --> 00:08:53,264
We're literally capped in the sense that

179
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,745
even if we work 24 hours a day,

180
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:56,225
there's only so much we can output.

181
00:08:56,665 --> 00:08:59,446
And we can think about how to output more than that.

182
00:08:59,827 --> 00:09:03,088
However, if you consider that the community

183
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:04,408
is an additional part of your team

184
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:05,989
and that community will continue to grow,

185
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:07,950
then that's exponential growth,

186
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,690
as long as you encourage your community

187
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,811
to develop alongside you.

188
00:09:12,438 --> 00:09:15,000
You can see this through the blood of all of Valve's things.

189
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,402
They produce hats, the community produces hats,

190
00:09:17,862 --> 00:09:23,066
skins for League of Legends, skins for Counter-Strike guns,

191
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:25,908
and the community even votes upon what kind of materials

192
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:28,290
they want to have inside of the game itself.

193
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,431
So Valve doesn't have to produce that content.

194
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:35,815
They even go so far as to price use the laws of economics to price these materials for them

195
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:42,719
So they don't have to have somebody whose job it is to assign arbitrary price values to these new assets that are coming in

196
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,820
It's a machine that's automatically

197
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:50,924
Sort of it's automated by the laws of economics and by the community based off supply and demand

198
00:09:52,044 --> 00:09:55,747
There was a time back in college when I used to love watching these tf2 skits

199
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:59,509
But they would only come out once every six months or so and so valve

200
00:10:00,788 --> 00:10:03,029
with this philosophy said, well, it'd be a lot easier

201
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:04,570
if we gave the tools to the community

202
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,331
so that they can make the skits for us.

203
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:08,292
And now you have the Saxxy Awards

204
00:10:08,352 --> 00:10:13,735
and there's an infinite number of TF2 marketing cartoons

205
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:14,936
rather than once every few years.

206
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,237
Other developers do this too.

207
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:19,859
So when World of Warcraft came out, you could mod the UI.

208
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,840
And I think at the time their intention was

209
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,901
to allow players to customize the visuals of it.

210
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,002
But the most downloaded mod by magnitudes

211
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,223
was something called Quest Helper.

212
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:31,421
And what Quest Helper allowed players to do,

213
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:32,702
or what they enabled them to do,

214
00:10:32,722 --> 00:10:34,844
is sort of quest in a way where they could understand

215
00:10:34,904 --> 00:10:36,766
where to go and what the objectives of the quest.

216
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,329
And so that was an indication of the game design for WoW.

217
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:42,191
So in the Cataclysm expansion,

218
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:43,872
they actually just implemented it into the game.

219
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:52,207
So the results of this sort of process is you now have fans developing content for you,

220
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:57,092
you now have fans developing marketing for you, which makes a better game than you and

221
00:10:57,132 --> 00:11:00,094
I could ever make, and it builds a bigger team than you and I could ever be.

222
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:03,137
So why did we take this approach?

223
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:08,101
Well, Tooth & Tail is a multiplayer game, and for indies, multiplayer games are sort

224
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:09,922
of infamous for having this...

225
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:13,839
chicken and egg problem where if nobody's playing your game,

226
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,522
no one's going to buy your game

227
00:11:15,562 --> 00:11:17,105
because you can't play against anybody.

228
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:18,427
But if nobody buys your game,

229
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:19,428
then no one's playing the game.

230
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,772
And so we knew we needed to see the community

231
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:22,574
in the first place.

232
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,122
We knew we would require a constant iteration on the game

233
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:28,744
because if AAA companies are even struggling

234
00:11:28,784 --> 00:11:29,645
with the balance of the game,

235
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:31,827
how could a small indie team with limited resources

236
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:32,948
consider balancing the game?

237
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:35,430
And we felt like this was going to be

238
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,491
a challenging game design for us

239
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:38,973
because we wanted to take all the core philosophies,

240
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:41,615
concepts, and experiences of a real-time strategy game

241
00:11:41,655 --> 00:11:44,737
that you know and love, like Command and Conquer

242
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,459
or StarCraft or Age of Empires,

243
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,060
and then boil it down into something

244
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,721
that was really accessible but felt the same.

245
00:11:51,215 --> 00:11:56,919
And so as a result of this approach, what we did was we created a suite of automated tools for community development.

246
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:05,746
And this is how we began that process. So for comparison, Monaco took the avenue of traditional press.

247
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:14,633
We got some IGF awards. We did a bunch of interviews. We went through the traditional press outlets like IGN or blogs like Kotaku or Joystick at the time, etc.

248
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:19,759
So for comparison, what we did was before we made Tooth & Tail,

249
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:23,081
one of the reasons we made Tooth & Tail was we wanted to make a game that was streamable,

250
00:12:23,221 --> 00:12:26,803
or in other words, as fun to watch as it is to play.

251
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:34,868
Because we knew that back in 2013, it was sort of the verge of Twitch becoming the phenomenon that it is today,

252
00:12:35,248 --> 00:12:36,869
and YouTubers were getting more...

253
00:12:39,706 --> 00:12:42,589
talking directly to consumers better than the traditional blogs were.

254
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:45,752
So we wanted to make a game that encouraged this kind of content,

255
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:48,575
and it, in essence, encouraged community development.

256
00:12:52,045 --> 00:12:58,729
Another reason why we chose this method was back during Monaco days, we felt like something

257
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:04,292
that was sort of essential to the sort of indie marketing that a lot of us indies do

258
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:05,013
is Twitter.

259
00:13:05,873 --> 00:13:10,696
And we were not very successful in achieving the amount of followers or the amount of virality

260
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:14,979
or retweets that other developers were getting with their games.

261
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:19,061
And so we felt like maybe Twitter wasn't something that was in our company's blood.

262
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:20,562
We weren't good at tweeting.

263
00:13:21,864 --> 00:13:24,666
But what we were good at is we were good at engaging

264
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:25,647
the consumer directly.

265
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:28,168
And with Monaco, we did this to some success,

266
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:29,809
but not to the scale that it is today.

267
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,232
With Monaco, we were good at getting fans to talk with us

268
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:36,694
and love developing the game alongside us

269
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:39,015
and essentially become evangelists for the game,

270
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:41,777
ambassadors for the game that promote,

271
00:13:41,937 --> 00:13:44,079
go out there and they talk about the game for you.

272
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:45,960
And that goal is very small.

273
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,081
That goal is very achievable.

274
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:50,023
It's not hundreds of thousands of followers.

275
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:50,443
It's like 10.

276
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:52,940
And that's all you need, which is great.

277
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,143
So when we took this approach,

278
00:13:56,183 --> 00:13:59,185
we decided our marketing outlets would be Twitch

279
00:14:00,046 --> 00:14:03,689
and Discord, or at the time it was MIRC or IRC,

280
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,671
which is basically developer chat.

281
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:10,729
So Twitch, the way it began was at the time in 2013,

282
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,272
streaming development was sort of something

283
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,673
that was becoming very popular

284
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:18,974
and a lot of developers still do it today, we still do it,

285
00:14:19,655 --> 00:14:21,956
but it was very much a traditional dev stream.

286
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:24,878
Andy Schatz would be on a computer and you'd be coding,

287
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:26,359
you're talking about the game,

288
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:29,380
this is a very early, ugly prototype of the game.

289
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:32,862
But what happened organically,

290
00:14:33,693 --> 00:14:35,715
was as the game became more fun,

291
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,816
we played the game on stream

292
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:39,897
in a way that was very competitive.

293
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:42,859
And we were sort of role-playing this idea

294
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:45,161
that even though the game was an ugly, ugly prototype,

295
00:14:45,781 --> 00:14:49,303
we were imagining the game as it was in its completed state.

296
00:14:49,643 --> 00:14:51,705
And it set a culture of competitive play.

297
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:53,866
We were shoutcasting the game.

298
00:14:53,946 --> 00:14:54,967
We were doing highlights.

299
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:56,568
We were talking high-level strategy.

300
00:14:56,668 --> 00:14:58,989
We were getting excited over the back and forth

301
00:14:59,029 --> 00:14:59,890
of the competitive match,

302
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,471
even though it was just a simple prototype.

303
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:05,612
And as people watched that, they participated with us.

304
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,253
And this is part of our open development style.

305
00:15:07,293 --> 00:15:09,414
So it's like, you can talk to us as developers

306
00:15:09,514 --> 00:15:11,374
as we're sort of engaging in this back and forth.

307
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:16,756
And we acquired alpha members through that method.

308
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:18,917
So essentially what I'm talking about here

309
00:15:19,037 --> 00:15:20,458
is establishing a culture

310
00:15:20,598 --> 00:15:22,458
of the kind of community members that you want

311
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,580
by acting as the community members you want.

312
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:29,415
than engaging with those community members directly.

313
00:15:29,836 --> 00:15:32,182
And so when you acquire them into your community,

314
00:15:32,243 --> 00:15:34,649
they are now sort of replications of you.

315
00:15:37,464 --> 00:15:41,985
Then the second avenue for which we have done community building is through

316
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:45,326
the community chat itself, the direct line to the community members.

317
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:50,568
And we've made sure that all of our marketing avenues focused to this point.

318
00:15:50,588 --> 00:15:54,249
So the Steam forums, the tweets that we do do, our Tumblr, etc.,

319
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:58,270
they all tell the consumer to go to the community chat.

320
00:15:58,931 --> 00:16:01,932
It started with IRC, and IRC was fine.

321
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,672
But IRC is like 1,000 years old, and

322
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:05,833
a lot of people don't really.

323
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:09,246
want to, it's not like a user-friendly interface.

324
00:16:10,027 --> 00:16:12,708
But then Discord came out back in I think October of 2016.

325
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:16,529
And this thing, this application changed the face

326
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:18,870
of how we approach community entirely.

327
00:16:20,431 --> 00:16:24,512
So Discord, what it is, it's a free community chat tool.

328
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:25,392
Everyone can use it.

329
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:26,873
I'm sure you've all heard of Slack.

330
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:28,794
And I'm sure many of you have heard of Discord

331
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,354
as it's rising in popularity.

332
00:16:30,895 --> 00:16:32,135
It's essentially Slack.

333
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:35,438
for the consumer, it's a consumer facing product.

334
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:39,084
Trying to replace the days of like Ventrilo or TeamSpeak

335
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:41,328
or all those things like when you used to get

336
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:43,653
into your clan chat and talk with your clan

337
00:16:43,673 --> 00:16:45,736
or talk with your guild before you did a raid, et cetera.

338
00:16:48,414 --> 00:16:57,579
So about three or four months ago, I was invited to be the first ever guest blog or non-Discord member to write articles on their official blog.

339
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:09,806
And the way this happened was I was talking to one of the developers for Discord about how we were using their platform to do development rather than actually just gaming community building.

340
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:12,658
and how we used the tools that they provided

341
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,218
that were intended for community building

342
00:17:15,518 --> 00:17:17,959
and how we leveraged those tools

343
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:20,700
to assist in the development of the game.

344
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,260
And he was fascinated by all the Cypress of doodads

345
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,421
and whatnot that we had done,

346
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:27,501
so I ended up writing a blog about it.

347
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:29,742
And I'll go over some of that with you today.

348
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:33,303
So here's how we enhanced our community chat.

349
00:17:35,063 --> 00:17:36,643
First off, our permission tools.

350
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:44,520
So with the permission tools, what essentially it comes down to is you can assign roles or

351
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,941
status or different privileges to different members in your community.

352
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:57,183
Now the typical interaction of this, or the typical way this surfaces in community is

353
00:17:57,203 --> 00:17:58,003
you have moderators.

354
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,063
So this is something that's very typical in forums.

355
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:06,244
You have moderators that delete bad, you know, troll comments on forums or whatnot.

356
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:07,805
But what we've done here...

357
00:18:08,928 --> 00:18:12,691
that I think sets it apart is we've thought about expanding the scope of what permissions

358
00:18:12,731 --> 00:18:12,931
mean.

359
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:19,715
And so in Discord, we've separated them out by color and by priority, and we've identified

360
00:18:19,755 --> 00:18:23,958
the individuals who serve as ambassadors for the company and the individuals who are superfans,

361
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:24,439
et cetera.

362
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:25,660
This is a 100% voluntary job.

363
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:33,289
And it's driven, it allows the community to basically help itself.

364
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,632
So we select these members out of the community who we believe

365
00:18:37,372 --> 00:18:40,554
represent us and represent the company in a positive way.

366
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:43,536
And we explain to them what they mean to the company.

367
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:45,958
Then we assign them this unique role.

368
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:52,843
Essentially, I think the reason why we chose to do this is because

369
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:55,798
If you're very passionate about your community,

370
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,000
having the responsibility to help grow your community

371
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,662
is something that's very intrinsically rewarding.

372
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:02,626
So we've gone beyond just making moderators.

373
00:19:02,646 --> 00:19:03,307
We have guides.

374
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:06,070
Guides, their role is to convert a new player

375
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,913
into a non-new player by informing them

376
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:10,816
of all of the thick questions they have about the game.

377
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:12,298
They're essentially living FAQs.

378
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,466
We even have superstars in which we recognize members who do positive things for the community.

379
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:23,474
We mark them as a superstar because they did fan art or they did a custom song for the

380
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:24,375
game or something or whatnot.

381
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:28,060
You can make tools with Discord.

382
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:32,214
So one of the tools that we did is we have a completely

383
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,875
hands off alpha onboarding process.

384
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:37,938
Traditionally what happened in the past was we would have

385
00:19:37,978 --> 00:19:41,560
like a form and individuals would sign up for the form

386
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,841
and then we would basically email keys out.

387
00:19:44,502 --> 00:19:46,743
But this took time off of our hands as developers

388
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:49,685
and we don't want to distribute keys manually every morning.

389
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:54,648
So we decided to make the onboarding process for the alpha

390
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:56,169
be something that was community driven.

391
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,063
So after having selected the select few of moderate,

392
00:20:01,123 --> 00:20:04,586
select handful of moderators who we felt represented

393
00:20:04,606 --> 00:20:05,807
the company in a positive way,

394
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:08,669
we instructed them that they now had the power

395
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:12,072
and the responsibility to key members of the community.

396
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:14,874
So as tons of community members come into the chat,

397
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,257
the moderators now identify the ones who they think

398
00:20:18,377 --> 00:20:21,460
represent the culture that we want,

399
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,801
the culture of positivity or of inclusivity.

400
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,401
And then they proceed to vote on that individual.

401
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:30,882
And if enough moderators vote on that individual,

402
00:20:31,223 --> 00:20:33,464
a bot automatically private messages them a key.

403
00:20:34,004 --> 00:20:36,325
And this is how we make sure that we weed out individuals

404
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:38,546
who may be toxic or too salty when they play,

405
00:20:39,227 --> 00:20:40,967
and encourage that there's a positive growth

406
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:41,648
in our community.

407
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,909
This is done via a bot, but more importantly,

408
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:45,930
it's done via the community.

409
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,511
The bot itself is actually programmed

410
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:48,892
by the community as well.

411
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:54,012
So we also wanted to make sure that we created retention

412
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:54,613
with this method.

413
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:57,333
So the tip, like I said before, the typical format

414
00:20:57,373 --> 00:21:01,755
was to have a sign up form and then to give out keys.

415
00:21:01,815 --> 00:21:04,995
But I think in the past, we didn't have a lot of success

416
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,336
with that because once we gave out the key,

417
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,277
we had no means of making sure that they played the game

418
00:21:10,457 --> 00:21:12,218
or provided us with the feedback necessary.

419
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,958
So instead, our current format is that players now have

420
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:17,219
to earn their keys by contributing to the community.

421
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:21,517
This means engaging in, watching the stream,

422
00:21:21,637 --> 00:21:23,558
engaging in conversation, asking questions,

423
00:21:23,638 --> 00:21:26,179
providing answers, becoming familiar with the game.

424
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:28,880
And by earning a key through proving

425
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,521
that they're passionate about the community,

426
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,582
it means that the community itself is ultimately

427
00:21:34,422 --> 00:21:35,583
full of just passionate people.

428
00:21:36,523 --> 00:21:39,024
And less individuals who are just looking for a free key.

429
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,385
This really does promote retention.

430
00:21:42,565 --> 00:21:45,528
We've also used the tools within Discord to help us make the game.

431
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:49,571
So, Tooth & Tail is an online game and it doesn't have matchmaking.

432
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:50,612
You can play online.

433
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:54,355
There's a lobby system and you can make a lobby and play against each other.

434
00:21:54,395 --> 00:21:57,537
But there's no way to mark yourself as looking for a game.

435
00:21:57,677 --> 00:21:59,919
However, because everyone is in the chat,

436
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,482
using the bot that was programmed by the community, you can type ready.

437
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:07,623
And it'll now mark you green, so your name turns green.

438
00:22:07,903 --> 00:22:11,244
It also marks you as a permission or a role as looking for a game.

439
00:22:11,424 --> 00:22:12,824
So you can ping looking for a game.

440
00:22:13,944 --> 00:22:15,344
And this is what it kind of looks like.

441
00:22:15,404 --> 00:22:17,965
On the right hand side where there's user list, you can now look and

442
00:22:17,985 --> 00:22:21,065
say, hey, that's every single person looking to play the game.

443
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:23,086
They're green, when they chat their name's green and

444
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:24,026
I can see them on the side so

445
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:25,906
I can private message them and tell them if they wanna play the game.

446
00:22:26,526 --> 00:22:30,267
This is great because now it just gets more people to play the game.

447
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:34,867
So, getting started, these are some simple stuff that you can do today.

448
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:38,911
Pick your hub.

449
00:22:39,051 --> 00:22:42,013
You can, for us it's Discord and we're having a great time with it, but you can pick any

450
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:44,976
hub if it's like a chat hub or a blog or what not.

451
00:22:46,778 --> 00:22:49,439
Set up your roles or define your roles more specifically.

452
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:51,961
And this is something that I feel like

453
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:53,501
has worked out really well for us.

454
00:22:54,062 --> 00:22:55,883
We defined our role as a developer.

455
00:22:55,963 --> 00:22:58,624
We've defined our superstars as moderators

456
00:22:58,904 --> 00:23:00,945
or guides or featured members.

457
00:23:01,626 --> 00:23:05,528
Define what those roles, privileges, and entitlements mean

458
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:09,349
because it establishes various levels of importance

459
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,070
within your community.

460
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:15,454
Create a singular landing page so that people can go to this one spot and

461
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,774
get all the information they need to know.

462
00:23:16,835 --> 00:23:19,857
Because your community is not just a hub with a bunch of people in it.

463
00:23:20,277 --> 00:23:21,298
It's now an ecosystem.

464
00:23:21,938 --> 00:23:25,961
It's now, it's got its own rules and its own metrics and it lives and

465
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,082
moves on its own.

466
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:27,942
They're gonna have questions.

467
00:23:27,962 --> 00:23:30,544
They're gonna wanna participate in it as if it's a game in and of itself.

468
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,127
Announce your updates.

469
00:23:34,787 --> 00:23:34,907
So.

470
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:41,665
It's important for you not to go dark because your community is eagerly waiting for the next bit of news.

471
00:23:42,126 --> 00:23:47,277
So constantly talk about the little things that you're doing so that your community can have something to engage in.

472
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:51,220
You can do this either Discord or Twitter,

473
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,041
whatever hub you have, and then invite them to engage.

474
00:23:54,221 --> 00:23:57,162
So you take your invite or however you want

475
00:23:57,983 --> 00:24:00,264
to ask your community to join this one spot

476
00:24:00,584 --> 00:24:02,024
and funnel them all into one place.

477
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,565
In the beginning, we tried funneling them

478
00:24:04,665 --> 00:24:06,706
all into a newsletter, but ultimately,

479
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:10,108
we worked into just funneling them all into this chatroom.

480
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:13,829
Whatever it is, just make sure that they know every single step of the way,

481
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,329
whatever it is that you're talking through, where to go.

482
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:21,230
So whenever we tweet, we Facebook, whenever we make a blog on Tumblr or

483
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,011
a Steam forum post, it all tells them to go to this one spot,

484
00:24:25,411 --> 00:24:27,212
that one landing page that I talked about earlier.

485
00:24:28,812 --> 00:24:30,893
And hopefully, if you build your community up enough,

486
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:34,213
then you can have people for some reason meme out about you.

487
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:37,474
That's not Photoshop, that's Andy Schatz's face at the Boston Major.

488
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:41,491
So this is some of our moderators.

489
00:24:41,531 --> 00:24:43,332
I'd like to give a big shout out to them.

490
00:24:43,552 --> 00:24:45,593
Here's some resources that I used for this talk.

491
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:46,833
And thank you.

492
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:50,874
And that's our Discord page and my Twitter and our, oops,

493
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:53,375
that's, I should say Tumblr or blog or whatnot.

494
00:24:53,415 --> 00:24:57,196
But yeah, I encourage you to check out our Discord

495
00:24:57,216 --> 00:24:59,157
because it's got a lot of really cool,

496
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:00,357
fun things you can do in there.

497
00:25:01,438 --> 00:25:01,958
So thanks so much.

498
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:14,128
Oh, okay. Questions, anyone?

499
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:23,624
Hi, so really great talk first of all.

500
00:25:23,644 --> 00:25:24,544
Okay, thanks.

501
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:26,245
So I have a question.

502
00:25:26,385 --> 00:25:27,766
Your game obviously is multiplayer,

503
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:29,147
which is the kind of game that already

504
00:25:29,507 --> 00:25:31,849
sort of encourages people to seek out a community.

505
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:32,249
Yeah.

506
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:33,190
So they have someone to play with.

507
00:25:34,931 --> 00:25:37,052
How viable would you say all of these things are

508
00:25:37,172 --> 00:25:38,954
sort of for a single player game

509
00:25:39,094 --> 00:25:41,435
that is generally more of a solitary experience?

510
00:25:41,595 --> 00:25:43,436
Well, yeah, I've thought about this as well.

511
00:25:44,322 --> 00:25:47,143
I think the key isn't necessarily single player versus multiplayer,

512
00:25:47,864 --> 00:25:51,366
but something that can be iterated on or have perpetual engagement.

513
00:25:51,606 --> 00:25:57,089
So a game like Darkest Dungeon, which has added content constantly,

514
00:25:57,449 --> 00:26:01,051
or like Don't Starve or whatnot, can easily foster this sort of community.

515
00:26:01,772 --> 00:26:05,494
A game that would probably not work well in this, like the most extreme case,

516
00:26:05,514 --> 00:26:07,535
would be something like a narrative game that's...

517
00:26:08,015 --> 00:26:09,858
like a short narrative game that's prone to spoilers.

518
00:26:10,338 --> 00:26:12,681
Because once the consumer finishes it,

519
00:26:12,721 --> 00:26:14,523
there's not much they can do beyond that.

520
00:26:15,104 --> 00:26:17,306
But if you have something that's like a systemic game

521
00:26:17,346 --> 00:26:18,668
that is procedurally generated

522
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:20,069
or continues to build upon itself,

523
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,953
there's lots of reasons for the player to come back

524
00:26:22,993 --> 00:26:23,734
and give you feedback.

525
00:26:25,155 --> 00:26:25,435
Thank you.

526
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:26,276
Thank you.

527
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:29,087
Hello.

528
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:30,088
Hi.

529
00:26:30,228 --> 00:26:30,308
Hi.

530
00:26:30,748 --> 00:26:31,289
I have a question.

531
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:36,593
So when you're on Twitch streaming the development, how

532
00:26:36,613 --> 00:26:39,356
do you decide when you're going to be streaming?

533
00:26:39,696 --> 00:26:42,519
Oh, because if you don't want to give away a certain part

534
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,420
of a game, you want that part secret.

535
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:47,643
Or what makes you decide, OK, we're going to stream this,

536
00:26:47,964 --> 00:26:48,504
but not this?

537
00:26:48,724 --> 00:26:48,944
Right.

538
00:26:49,004 --> 00:26:52,247
So the question is, how do you decide what to stream and what

539
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:52,728
not to stream?

540
00:26:53,949 --> 00:26:56,569
We also have portions of the game

541
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,350
that we haven't streamed at all yet.

542
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,450
They're the ones, for us, it's what we've chosen

543
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,371
to be the most prone to spoilers.

544
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:06,571
So we haven't streamed any of the single player

545
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:07,272
or anything like that.

546
00:27:08,232 --> 00:27:11,393
What we typically, the high level goal of streaming for us

547
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:14,073
is to set a cultural example for the community.

548
00:27:14,153 --> 00:27:16,074
So we stream in the way we hope

549
00:27:16,194 --> 00:27:17,754
other viewers stream themselves.

550
00:27:17,994 --> 00:27:20,735
And it's worked out because by running tournaments

551
00:27:20,815 --> 00:27:23,075
for something as small and as simple as this alpha.

552
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,638
we've encouraged other people to do the exact same thing.

553
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:27,358
And it works.

554
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:29,941
So find whatever it is in your game

555
00:27:30,101 --> 00:27:32,463
that you think you can imagine other people doing for you,

556
00:27:33,063 --> 00:27:33,924
and then stream that way.

557
00:27:34,424 --> 00:27:36,266
Because people, you know, you lead and they follow.

558
00:27:37,186 --> 00:27:37,607
Okay, thanks.

559
00:27:38,147 --> 00:27:38,407
Thank you.

560
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:40,809
So.

561
00:27:42,446 --> 00:27:48,531
So I think two of the biggest concerns in generating an open development community is

562
00:27:49,832 --> 00:27:57,478
One the creation of clicks or kind of a sense of elitism or entitlement within privileged users

563
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:03,503
And then also being held accountable for the actions of those

564
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:08,587
Individuals and occasionally having to apologize on their behalf, right? How do you?

565
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:14,871
for one thing, incentivize a community,

566
00:28:14,891 --> 00:28:16,392
a type of community engagement

567
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:19,975
that doesn't stratify your player base.

568
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:24,718
And also, how do you hold people accountable

569
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:27,980
without letting it get so far

570
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,862
that you're stuck making an apology

571
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:33,724
that you never should have been forced to make

572
00:28:33,744 --> 00:28:34,364
in the first place.

573
00:28:35,785 --> 00:28:40,327
So just to go over your question again, the first one is elitism, right?

574
00:28:40,908 --> 00:28:46,911
Yes, I guess the first one is how to prevent clicks among privileged players.

575
00:28:47,331 --> 00:28:52,874
And then the second one would be how to make those privileged players self-accountable

576
00:28:53,454 --> 00:28:56,416
so that you're not having to shepherd them around.

577
00:28:56,436 --> 00:28:59,838
Right, so these situations have already come to us.

578
00:29:01,642 --> 00:29:03,804
there have been complaints from other members

579
00:29:03,864 --> 00:29:05,005
who are not moderators,

580
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:08,187
who felt like the moderators themselves were too click-like.

581
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:10,469
The question, sorry,

582
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,270
the question is that how do you prevent clicks

583
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,752
and how do you hold players accountable

584
00:29:14,812 --> 00:29:17,133
for if they're in a position of power and they abuse it

585
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,594
or something along those lines, right?

586
00:29:19,195 --> 00:29:20,776
So both have happened to us.

587
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:24,198
As far as clicks are concerned,

588
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:27,661
I've never done anything to actively prevent them

589
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:28,501
in the sense that,

590
00:29:30,694 --> 00:29:37,819
I don't say, the moderators themselves do have a private channel for which they talk

591
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:38,600
about moderation.

592
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,421
And that in and of itself is a click.

593
00:29:40,461 --> 00:29:42,523
And they talk about their own things in private.

594
00:29:44,204 --> 00:29:46,846
I don't feel that this is destructive to the community.

595
00:29:48,447 --> 00:29:52,610
And I think a big part of that is a lot of what has gone into selecting the moderators

596
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:56,954
themselves is to make sure that even though they have their own subsection of which they're

597
00:29:57,514 --> 00:29:58,435
essentially the elites.

598
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:02,027
they're vetted so that they're not elitists.

599
00:30:02,207 --> 00:30:05,250
They do talk directly to everyone else as individuals,

600
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:08,832
and I've established a rule page for the moderators

601
00:30:08,972 --> 00:30:11,894
to know that they should not talk to individuals

602
00:30:11,974 --> 00:30:13,295
as if they are inferior to them.

603
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:15,677
Now, in the event that this does happen,

604
00:30:15,717 --> 00:30:17,358
and it has happened, we've...

605
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,081
The developers are the highest tier of elites,

606
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:24,582
essentially, in development, and they have to step in,

607
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,583
which takes time off on our hands.

608
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:29,025
It has happened a few times over the year,

609
00:30:29,465 --> 00:30:32,006
where we have to step in and talk to a moderator directly,

610
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:33,227
and then guide them.

611
00:30:33,407 --> 00:30:35,348
But this particular correction process

612
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:38,850
allows it, sort of,

613
00:30:40,351 --> 00:30:44,553
serves as a way of showing the moderators how to behave.

614
00:30:44,913 --> 00:30:46,654
It is sort of going to happen, I think.

615
00:30:47,907 --> 00:30:49,349
Yeah, thanks.

616
00:30:53,672 --> 00:30:56,095
Hi there, I'm Paulo from Brazil, thanks for the talk.

617
00:30:57,836 --> 00:31:00,719
Your company has already made a name for itself with Monaco.

618
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:01,780
Yeah.

619
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,443
I'd like to ask if you have any tips or hints for companies

620
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:08,085
that still haven't made a name for themselves to start up,

621
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,666
to kickstart these communities.

622
00:31:09,727 --> 00:31:09,947
Oh, sure.

623
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:16,561
Well, to be fair, while we do have a name or a reputation for having made Monaco,

624
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:20,962
when we opened the alpha initially, it wasn't like a flood of people applied.

625
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:24,782
Because there are new and interesting games happening all the time.

626
00:31:25,643 --> 00:31:32,144
And we felt like, while we had a small advantage, in the form of about four people off of our Monaco forums.

627
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:36,065
The first four people who ever joined the alpha were four off the Monaco forums.

628
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:38,406
That was kind of the initial bump.

629
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:40,356
And it took a while.

630
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:42,617
The first, like I mentioned in the talk,

631
00:31:42,637 --> 00:31:44,538
we were IRC before we went to Discord.

632
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:47,780
The first year was less than 30 individuals in our IRC.

633
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,620
So it took a while.

634
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:52,922
But those 30 individuals are also the same 30

635
00:31:53,002 --> 00:31:55,223
that are on every day to this day.

636
00:31:56,264 --> 00:31:58,145
And many of them are moderators now.

637
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:01,666
So the goal here is not to have a huge community.

638
00:32:02,326 --> 00:32:04,788
The goal here is to find the few that really, really

639
00:32:04,848 --> 00:32:06,328
will stay with you the whole time, for years.

640
00:32:07,554 --> 00:32:09,375
And I think that's a very achievable goal,

641
00:32:09,435 --> 00:32:10,395
even if you start from zero,

642
00:32:10,455 --> 00:32:12,997
as long as you tell people where to go

643
00:32:13,017 --> 00:32:14,357
to connect with you.

644
00:32:14,377 --> 00:32:15,958
Because if they don't know where to go,

645
00:32:16,038 --> 00:32:17,459
then they're not going to be able to show you

646
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:18,339
that they care about your work.

647
00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:19,700
Thank you.

648
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,180
Thank you.

649
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,660
Okay, thanks.

650
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,662
There are some in the open room.

651
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:25,042
Okay, sure.

652
00:32:25,062 --> 00:32:25,482
Thanks everyone.
