00:00:00,518 --> 00:00:03,679
Hello everyone, good afternoon, good morning.

2
00:00:03,739 --> 00:00:05,079
Welcome to the GDC Twitch channel.

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:06,379
My name is Brian Francis.

4
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:08,820
I'm a contributing editor at gamasutra.com.

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,301
I am a community manager at GDC

6
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:15,062
and we are here playing Indivisible from Lab Zero Games.

7
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:17,102
This game just came out this week.

8
00:00:17,402 --> 00:00:18,082
It's pretty cool.

9
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:21,803
It comes to us, like I said, from Lab Zero

10
00:00:21,843 --> 00:00:24,364
and two of the folks from Lab Zero are with us today

11
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,984
in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.

12
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,645
Mike and Mariel, how's it going?

13
00:00:30,578 --> 00:00:32,300
Am I doing this? Am I in the center of the screen then?

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,000
Uh...

15
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:33,341
Nevermind.

16
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:34,121
Ha ha ha ha.

17
00:00:35,262 --> 00:00:36,583
Yeah, no, not quite. Um...

18
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:37,965
We have a whole hour there.

19
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:38,285
Yeah.

20
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:39,666
Ha ha ha ha.

21
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:41,087
We're doing good.

22
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:42,148
Ha ha ha ha.

23
00:00:42,528 --> 00:00:45,931
Right on. I'm gonna turn the volume down on the game a little because I'm now having to deal with two different voices.

24
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:46,392
Um...

25
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:47,192
No problem.

26
00:00:48,353 --> 00:00:49,514
One sec. Uh...

27
00:00:49,754 --> 00:00:54,078
Before I ask you guys to introduce yourselves, what I should do is ask Alex to introduce himself.

28
00:00:54,218 --> 00:00:55,839
Alex, we haven't heard from you in ages.

29
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,180
Hey, what's up, bro?

30
00:00:57,956 --> 00:00:58,817
How are you doing?

31
00:00:59,037 --> 00:00:59,517
I'm all right.

32
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:00,938
I was just following podcast rules here.

33
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,059
I was going to wait till you finished up.

34
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:02,900
Good.

35
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,180
I'm good.

36
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:03,821
It's good to be back.

37
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:05,662
I, uh, it's been a minute.

38
00:01:05,742 --> 00:01:07,644
So let's, uh, let's do this one up nice.

39
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:07,844
Yeah.

40
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:09,085
I got to, it's been so long.

41
00:01:09,105 --> 00:01:09,565
I've forgotten.

42
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:10,486
I got to log into chat.

43
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:13,688
So anyone who's watching live, please know you can go ahead and drop questions for

44
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,010
these two fine people in and we will relay them.

45
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:19,833
Uh, we prefer questions about game design and development, but we'll kind of take

46
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:20,794
anything right.

47
00:01:21,154 --> 00:01:23,156
My just appreciate being called the fine person.

48
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:23,896
Oh, sure.

49
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:34,268
Speaking of fine people, Mike, would you start by introducing yourself first?

50
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:41,630
Hello, I'm Mike Z. I did some stuff on this game. I don't even remember what I'm called anymore.

51
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,470
I think you said design lead.

52
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,630
Design lead? Okay.

53
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,631
No, project lead.

54
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:49,671
Project lead and design director and programmer. No, wait, that's Rob.

55
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:51,792
I did stuff, yeah.

56
00:01:52,732 --> 00:01:54,172
If you don't like something, it was probably me.

57
00:01:54,464 --> 00:01:57,866
You made a video game. Mariel, what is your role in this game?

58
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:02,729
Um, so it kind of changed over the course of the project.

59
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:05,991
So I started off as art director and lead animator.

60
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,212
Later became head of story.

61
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:11,854
And now, because that's too many titles, I'm just creative director.

62
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:18,208
right on. In the world of too many titles and too many things that we have to explain

63
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:21,891
before we get started on learning more about this game, how this game was made, I'm going

64
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:26,216
to go ahead and do a tiny bit of disclosure. Indivisible comes to us, one of the other

65
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:30,240
team members, two of the other team members are Brandon Sheffield and Matthew Kumar who

66
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,281
are great friends of GDC.

67
00:02:32,743 --> 00:02:35,965
but they also worked on the game, so we filled it with just claiming, you know,

68
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:37,026
hey, they worked on both.

69
00:02:37,046 --> 00:02:37,587
They work for us.

70
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:39,148
They work for the game that had nothing to do.

71
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:42,691
I guess I should also disclaim my back to this game on IndieGoGo way back when.

72
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,032
That awesome.

73
00:02:44,052 --> 00:02:44,912
Thank you.

74
00:02:45,153 --> 00:02:45,473
Right on.

75
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:48,015
That had nothing to do with us covering the game or anything.

76
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:49,396
We just I've been working.

77
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:51,157
I've been keeping track of games we wanted to cover.

78
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:52,198
And this was one of them.

79
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:53,039
So we did.

80
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:56,141
It had something to do with you covering the game, because if you hadn't,

81
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:57,342
you wouldn't be covering it right now.

82
00:02:57,562 --> 00:02:58,683
That's not true.

83
00:02:59,444 --> 00:02:59,644
Well.

84
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:08,101
It might not exist. Yeah, I didn't mean like bias wise I meant like if you hadn't given us money the game

85
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:12,783
For sure, yeah, let's start there actually, I mean let's talk about how this game came to be funded

86
00:03:12,803 --> 00:03:14,863
I remember you guys started on Indiegogo, right?

87
00:03:17,644 --> 00:03:23,426
So I think we were we were kind of coming off of finishing all the skull girls DLC that we did which we also

88
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:24,787
crowdfunded on Indiegogo

89
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:28,568
So we we'd how many characters did we release for skull girls?

90
00:03:30,932 --> 00:03:32,553
Six, I think, because Fukua.

91
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:35,715
Okay, so we put out six DLC characters for Skullgirls.

92
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:38,477
Am I gonna be wrong about that on a live stream?

93
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,420
Sorry, I didn't sleep.

94
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,021
And once we finished that,

95
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:44,822
you know, we started looking ahead

96
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:46,704
and thinking about our next project.

97
00:03:46,744 --> 00:03:49,446
And I think we all kinda wanted to work on something

98
00:03:49,486 --> 00:03:52,108
that we all would like to play in the end, just because.

99
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:54,049
No, six characters is correct.

100
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:54,710
Yeah.

101
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,451
I love the big band, Jungle Fortunes.

102
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:57,912
You're right, there's no fact-checking.

103
00:03:57,972 --> 00:03:58,292
Anyway.

104
00:04:00,947 --> 00:04:04,890
Yeah, so we all just thought like, what's, you know, what's a genre that we could tackle that

105
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,793
we think we would all like to play in the end? And we kind of came to the consensus that it was

106
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:18,158
kind of like this RPG. And so we started kind of developing this idea. We were talking with like,

107
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,421
a couple different publishers, but through that process, we kind of put together this pitch.

108
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:27,504
And then we were able to take this pitch and bring it to 505 and 505 agreed to help.

109
00:04:30,713 --> 00:04:34,834
fund the game if we were able to raise a certain amount of money through crowdfunding.

110
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:42,036
You did it! Sorry, yeah, sorry. Oh, a guard break. I was trying not to say anything because I want

111
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:48,519
to make sure that people can learn without me saying anything. So, continue. Yeah, so we

112
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:54,781
had it up on Indiegogo. It was kind of a stressful experience just because

113
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:58,282
we had to ask for a lot of money. Yeah.

114
00:05:00,222 --> 00:05:02,583
I'll interrupt for a second. So I actually...

115
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:12,730
I apologize, but what we learned from this crowdfunding experience is that Kickstarter has won the war.

116
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,431
Oh yeah?

117
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:22,656
We picked Indiegogo because we were asking for a lot of money, and Indiegogo took less cut overall,

118
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:27,359
which, when you're asking for, like, millions of dollars, matters.

119
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:27,900
It was 1.5, right?

120
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,136
I think actually Indiegogo was 1.3?

121
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:33,437
No, sorry, we were asking for 1.5.

122
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:34,418
Oh, yeah, million.

123
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:34,918
Yeah.

124
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:35,819
Right, yeah.

125
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,540
Like, when you're asking for that much money,

126
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:41,663
losing some percent to overhead just from your crowdfunding

127
00:05:41,683 --> 00:05:42,584
platform sucks.

128
00:05:42,824 --> 00:05:44,585
So Indiegogo took less overhead.

129
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:49,669
But Indiegogo had so much less reach

130
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,611
that people kept asking about, like,

131
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:54,052
I can't find it on Kickstarter.

132
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:56,013
Hey, I hear you guys are doing a Kickstarter, right?

133
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:58,395
Kickstarter has become the Kleenex term for.

134
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:03,542
crowdfunding right right I say crowdfunding but sometimes I'll kind of

135
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:08,047
fall back yeah and it's just a Kickstarter yeah so what we learned

136
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,211
after that is like and throughout the course of the whole crowdfund there were

137
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:14,594
people that were like I really want to back this game I'm not backing anything

138
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:19,880
on Indiegogo because Indiegogo allowed

139
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:25,881
people to put up projects that were like, whatever we get, we keep, even if we don't

140
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:28,182
reach the goal. And that became their reputation.

141
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:31,884
Right. Like there's, there's, you know, pros and cons, obviously.

142
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:36,346
And, you know, at the time, Indiegogo was the right choice for us.

143
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:39,067
Yeah. Like Indiegogo has been fantastic to work with.

144
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:39,388
Yeah.

145
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:45,691
It's just the reach and the public perception of the two platforms is like vastly different.

146
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,372
And we learned that firsthand.

147
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:51,834
Yeah. Yeah. So let's, let's focus on that for a minute.

148
00:06:51,854 --> 00:06:52,094
I think.

149
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,608
Even when you're on Kickstarter at this stage in the game,

150
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,249
when you're trying to crowdfund a video game,

151
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,751
the market is so saturated and so full

152
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:02,895
that it's a challenge every developer we talk to

153
00:07:02,935 --> 00:07:04,216
to get the word out about your project

154
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:05,537
and keep people coming back to it.

155
00:07:05,857 --> 00:07:07,618
So you guys dealt with that on Indiegogo.

156
00:07:07,638 --> 00:07:09,320
I mean, like four years ago now,

157
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,921
but as you were working through that,

158
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:12,522
how did you overcome that problem?

159
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:14,064
How did you get people to go to Indiegogo

160
00:07:14,104 --> 00:07:15,044
and give you the money you needed?

161
00:07:16,846 --> 00:07:19,468
I think it was just kind of like a chain reaction.

162
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:20,829
We released Skullgirls.

163
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:23,279
And then once we did the Skullgirls Indiegogo,

164
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:26,201
we had the existing IP of Skullgirls to say like,

165
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:28,502
hey, just you're funding more Skullgirls.

166
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,664
And then once we had success with that,

167
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:34,487
I think that's only the reason why that we could go

168
00:07:35,047 --> 00:07:37,309
to crowdfunding with an entirely new IP.

169
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:40,732
Like if we just came straight out the door with this game,

170
00:07:40,812 --> 00:07:42,012
I don't think it would have been funded.

171
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:45,015
I think we needed to have our existing reputation

172
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:46,996
as a studio and someone that could deliver

173
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:48,217
on a crowdfunding campaign.

174
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,543
And that's why it happened at all.

175
00:07:50,663 --> 00:07:54,925
Yeah. Another thing that really helped was we had the prototype,

176
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:59,107
which was a double edged sword, actually, because a lot of crowdfunding campaigns

177
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:00,908
are selling you the business term.

178
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,169
They're selling the sizzle, not the steak. Right.

179
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:07,350
A lot of crowdfunding campaigns are like, we're going to make a cool game

180
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,171
and you're going to think it's cool and like cool means

181
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:10,572
something different to everybody. Right.

182
00:08:11,112 --> 00:08:13,933
So I wanted to make sure because like.

183
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:18,137
you're playing it now right and there's not an RPG that is like this or a

184
00:08:18,377 --> 00:08:21,680
Metroidvania that is like this because we did the battle system that's never

185
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,100
been done

186
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,023
and I wanted to make sure people understood what the heck we were trying

187
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:25,323
to do

188
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:29,967
so we had a prototype and the prototype was we worked for three months on a

189
00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:30,327
thing

190
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:34,791
and like parts of it look like crap and parts of it look great and parts of it played like crap

191
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:36,012
and parts of it played okay

192
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:40,576
but it was like this is the idea we're going for and a whole bunch of people

193
00:08:40,616 --> 00:08:42,138
during the crowdfunding campaign were like

194
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,436
There were two parts of it.

195
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:46,157
One of them was like, well, I can already play this.

196
00:08:46,297 --> 00:08:47,537
Why do I have to give you anything?

197
00:08:48,137 --> 00:08:49,797
Like, you guys are basically done, right?

198
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:52,778
And the other one was, well, if this is what you're going for,

199
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,318
then I'm not giving you money.

200
00:08:54,979 --> 00:08:55,259
Right.

201
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,059
So it made it too real.

202
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,400
We couldn't sell the idea anymore.

203
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,420
Yeah.

204
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,860
Well, I mean, because people looked at it,

205
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,960
and they were like, well, parts of this look like crap.

206
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,681
So I don't want to pay for a whole game that's like this,

207
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:07,041
right?

208
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:10,142
Do you think you would take that approach on your next project,

209
00:09:10,162 --> 00:09:11,822
and put it like a playable beta or a demo?

210
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:21,026
Um, this is probably suicide, but I would, like, I really enjoyed being able to be like,

211
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:23,007
look, this is exactly what we're trying to do.

212
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:24,128
Yeah.

213
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:25,348
I would.

214
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:31,670
So I would like to reach the point where we don't have to crowdfund things anymore.

215
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,272
I like crowdfunding because it shows that people really believe in the thing that we're doing.

216
00:09:36,432 --> 00:09:40,033
And like, we get people that are along for the whole ride.

217
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:40,773
Yeah.

218
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:43,664
it's extremely stressful and worrying.

219
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:46,586
And for a lot of other teams

220
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:49,008
and for another crowdfund that we do,

221
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:50,249
like you don't always make it.

222
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:50,669
Right.

223
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:56,674
And that experience was really harrowing.

224
00:09:56,914 --> 00:09:57,174
Yeah.

225
00:09:57,595 --> 00:09:59,716
And I think also crowdfunding or not,

226
00:09:59,776 --> 00:10:00,837
I think as a studio,

227
00:10:00,897 --> 00:10:04,300
we do wanna embrace open development as much as we can.

228
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,541
Yes.

229
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:07,382
So just streaming, sharing.

230
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:11,317
you know, bring builds out to places to test,

231
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:13,839
just trying to be as open as we can without,

232
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:16,500
you know, obviously just spoiling like story

233
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,441
or anything like that.

234
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:21,404
We managed not to spoil two thirds of this game.

235
00:10:21,524 --> 00:10:24,426
I'm really surprised.

236
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:26,407
Yeah, but just being open about development,

237
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:28,028
I think we'll always try to do,

238
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:29,669
whether we crowd fund or not.

239
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,531
Yeah, I wanna do, sorry.

240
00:10:33,137 --> 00:10:33,818
No, please go ahead.

241
00:10:33,838 --> 00:10:37,320
I want to do betas for everything that we do, because the public feedback

242
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,440
is the best part.

243
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,601
And also, it's a really good way to get word of mouth

244
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,243
because people can play the thing you're doing.

245
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:47,785
We did backer previews for this game twice throughout the development. Right.

246
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:52,748
Those took a lot of extra work because we couldn't just chop out

247
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:55,590
the beginning of the game because we wanted not to spoil things.

248
00:10:56,157 --> 00:11:01,002
So in the future, I'd like to try to organize whatever we're doing so that we can do that in

249
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:06,488
like a manner that's not basically build a separate mini game for a month. Yeah. But I

250
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:10,312
definitely want to not be one of those teams. It's like we're working on a thing you're not

251
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:14,736
going to hear from us for two years. Right. Well, good luck with that. I guess that sounds

252
00:11:15,197 --> 00:11:17,219
like it's a lot of extra effort to have to like

253
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,583
worry about putting together demos and taking part in things.

254
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:21,464
But I suppose the feedback is worth it.

255
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:22,344
Definitely worth it.

256
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:25,825
Like, yeah, even just like seeing people play the thing that you're working on

257
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:30,426
and enjoy it really helps you be able to continue to work on it.

258
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:33,827
Because you know that like, oh yeah, people actually like this thing

259
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:35,648
is really helpful.

260
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:41,268
Yeah, let's dig into that. I mean, I want to come back and talk about the business more because I feel like your decision to go with the publisher is super interesting.

261
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:43,330
But let's talk about this combat and this system.

262
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,611
We've got a bunch of good questions in chat.

263
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,373
Bryant, how are you doing in there?

264
00:11:46,393 --> 00:11:49,156
Great. You're like, yeah, I'm just tearing it up.

265
00:11:49,356 --> 00:11:55,663
I'm just doing the Metroidvania kind of style, like explore, look around, figure out where I can go to figure out what side quest and what's main quest.

266
00:11:57,043 --> 00:11:59,924
The combat system, which you just mentioned, like the design of this game, so you can see.

267
00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:02,924
For those of you who are unfamiliar with the stream, which I bet it is in a lot of you,

268
00:12:02,964 --> 00:12:07,205
there's 41 great people out there in chat, people like almightymince and TheodosStreams,

269
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:09,106
y'all seem pretty familiar with this game, but in case you aren't...

270
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:11,326
Oh, I didn't re-quote this. Neither did you, right?

271
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:12,607
Oh, not in time.

272
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:13,687
Sorry, I'm gonna be rude.

273
00:12:14,187 --> 00:12:14,707
It's fine.

274
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:15,187
No worries.

275
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:16,968
Yeah, please, get more folks in here.

276
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:18,128
What is your Twitter handle?

277
00:12:18,548 --> 00:12:19,468
OfficialGDC.

278
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:20,788
I think they, uh, yeah.

279
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:21,919
They tweeted us.

280
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,700
I don't know how Twitter works.

281
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,781
How do I even see that?

282
00:12:25,382 --> 00:12:26,502
I don't know.

283
00:12:26,522 --> 00:12:27,143
It's so much harder.

284
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:30,806
Anyway, so there's a Metroidvania-y kind of part of the game where you're here using

285
00:12:30,846 --> 00:12:34,769
abilities to navigate a 2D space and then as you just saw a second ago, there is a combat

286
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:38,912
screen where you're using the face buttons to pick moves for each of your characters.

287
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:44,336
Those moves are then sort of manipulated by using different directions that affect the

288
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:44,576
stuff.

289
00:12:45,357 --> 00:12:48,439
So, for instance, I'm going to get blasted by this asshole.

290
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,240
Wow.

291
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:50,901
Are we not PG?

292
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,801
Nice. No, we're not.

293
00:12:54,462 --> 00:12:55,863
You know, it's for adults.

294
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:57,064
GDC is 18+.

295
00:12:58,345 --> 00:12:58,926
Not that kind of 18+.

296
00:12:59,006 --> 00:13:02,009
I'm good at this.

297
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:03,950
Anyway, yeah, Alex, you had a question.

298
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,131
You had a question, Alex.

299
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:06,112
Well, no, not at all.

300
00:13:06,132 --> 00:13:08,574
Let's get into some combat because I want to talk about the systems.

301
00:13:08,594 --> 00:13:09,995
And there are some great questions in chat.

302
00:13:10,035 --> 00:13:12,417
Let's start with one that is directly relevant to that.

303
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:14,639
AlmightyMintz asked, any insight you can provide

304
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:17,702
in how you balance combat for so many characters and possible combinations?

305
00:13:17,742 --> 00:13:18,082
I know there's...

306
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:22,411
a ton, right? I mean, there must be like well over 10 at least that you can get in your party at any one time.

307
00:13:22,431 --> 00:13:23,592
And there's a maximum of four.

308
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:26,875
So how did you guys think about adding characters and balancing?

309
00:13:28,376 --> 00:13:32,059
Sorry, I've been bad at Twitter and actually couldn't find the thing.

310
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:33,440
Yeah, I'll help you. You answer.

311
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:36,403
I'm really bad at Twitter, okay?

312
00:13:37,064 --> 00:13:44,310
Yeah, so there are actually over 20 characters, uh, that you can get in your party. You can have four in your battle.

313
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:45,211
Um

314
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:53,089
Balancing is kind of the same way that we approached it for SGE, right?

315
00:13:53,389 --> 00:14:01,592
So characters have attacks, obviously damage is an important part, but also in a game like this,

316
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:08,074
width and size for the hits are important, right? Like Ajna's sideways axe swing hits

317
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:14,336
multiple rows of enemies, and like her down does lots of extra damage. So we looked at the systems

318
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:16,137
that we had in this game, which are...

319
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:20,570
damage, meter, and how fast your actions come back.

320
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:30,117
And we basically balance things around their overall utility rather than just damage.

321
00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:34,921
So like Jhin saying, every time you do a neutral attack, they start their...

322
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,823
Did you do it? Thank you.

323
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:40,706
Oh, did you actually retweet it?

324
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:40,846
Yes.

325
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:45,249
Don't let me touch social media.

326
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:53,349
Yeah, so ginseng, every time you stir their mortar, it increases the efficacy of their next heal.

327
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,571
Basically, exponentially.

328
00:14:56,551 --> 00:14:59,333
So the next time you do an up attack, you get way more health back.

329
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:08,259
But, they don't do a whole lot of damage, and you do need healing very often, so they don't have a lot of cooldown on anything that they do.

330
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:15,983
Whereas, razme can reach anyone, anywhere, can slow enemies, and has really, really good super resist.

331
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:24,640
So she's way slower to recover all of her pips, and like, Ajna's down attack does almost twice as much damage as her neutral attack.

332
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,444
So it has a much longer cooldown, and the cooldown is multiplicative each time, right?

333
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:35,387
So you cost yourself like 20% of your speed each time you do it.

334
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:45,074
So if you mix up what you're doing, you can deal slightly less damage, but be able to do it way more often, or choose to do a huge amount of damage in one turn.

335
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:50,497
And not get another turn for a little while. Yeah, you're motioning. Oh

336
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:58,481
Me yeah, no, no. No, sorry. Sorry. The main thing I wanted to say that we were balancing around is

337
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:04,445
We balanced not around level but basically around player skill, right?

338
00:16:04,525 --> 00:16:09,848
That was the main thing that we had to do with this game because damage isn't random and blocking isn't random and all the rest

339
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:10,368
of that stuff

340
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:13,590
One of the things that we learned from the prototype

341
00:16:14,491 --> 00:16:14,691
Again

342
00:16:15,252 --> 00:16:21,775
um, Republic development is really useful, was, uh, to balance around block damage rather than

343
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:28,298
hit damage, because since you can block whenever you want, um, assuming that people are going to

344
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:32,760
be good enough to block all the time, even if it means that they can't use supers very often,

345
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:40,104
uh, was a big help, because, like, the boss of the prototype, when we first played it,

346
00:16:40,404 --> 00:16:43,845
they were balanced around how much damage they did when you got hit, but, like,

347
00:16:44,182 --> 00:16:46,122
When you learn how to block, you didn't get hit at all.

348
00:16:46,182 --> 00:16:48,062
So like nobody lost to them ever.

349
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:52,303
And it just was, oh, I'm blocking and then not caring for like two minutes.

350
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:53,224
Right. Right.

351
00:16:54,124 --> 00:16:55,884
So, yeah, I don't think it's a very defensive

352
00:16:57,344 --> 00:16:57,624
game.

353
00:16:57,704 --> 00:16:59,805
I something that has really struck me.

354
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:03,726
And, you know, this game, you guys talk very publicly being strongly

355
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:06,086
influenced, at least in combat design by Valkyrie Profile,

356
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:08,067
which I confess I never played.

357
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:09,147
But in so.

358
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,886
I know I'm a garbage human for a lot of reasons, but...

359
00:17:14,286 --> 00:17:14,886
Wow.

360
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,267
Well, I'm a clean person.

361
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:19,268
Yeah, no, you're fantastic.

362
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:21,910
So I've been playing a little bit of this game and watching others play it, and something

363
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:28,533
I've noticed immediately is that there's so much that I associate with fighting game design

364
00:17:28,953 --> 00:17:29,694
popping up here.

365
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:30,314
Right?

366
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:33,055
So you're talking about hitboxes and that kind of thing.

367
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:34,596
I noticed there are different levels.

368
00:17:34,616 --> 00:17:38,318
There are, it looks like high attacks, medium attacks, and maybe even low attacks.

369
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:38,798
Yep.

370
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:39,799
And there's all kinds of stuff there.

371
00:17:41,015 --> 00:17:46,497
How did you choose what to bring over and integrate into this design? Those seem like very conscious decisions

372
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:48,638
yes, um, so

373
00:17:49,878 --> 00:17:50,498
this game

374
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:55,580
I'm gonna get a lot of flack for saying this because I don't mean art style or story or anything

375
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,741
I only mean combat this game is what I thought valkyrie profile was going to be

376
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:02,001
When I looked at the box before I played it

377
00:18:02,021 --> 00:18:09,323
Oh, yeah, so valkyrie profile is the same like four face buttons to do stuff with your team, but it's strict terms

378
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:12,717
Right, so everyone on your team goes however many times they go.

379
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:16,259
And when you're done, the enemy goes all in a row.

380
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,220
And then you go again, right?

381
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,821
And it's damage is random.

382
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:21,262
That's what I thought this game was going to be.

383
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:25,324
Yeah, and blocking is RPG randomness and all that.

384
00:18:25,684 --> 00:18:29,786
So this game is basically Valkyrie Profile with Final Fantasy's ATB.

385
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:32,828
So you characters can go whenever they want.

386
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:35,469
And then everything else comes from fighting games.

387
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:38,230
Blocking is up to you because I hated it when it was like this.

388
00:18:38,614 --> 00:18:40,534
Please just block this hit and don't die!"

389
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:43,055
And then like, they roll a two and they don't block it and you're like,

390
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:44,135
well crap.

391
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:47,976
I wanted everything that we did to be

392
00:18:49,316 --> 00:18:50,996
up to the player as much as possible.

393
00:18:51,856 --> 00:18:53,337
Um, the, there are

394
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:54,637
cough cough cough

395
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:55,097
sorry.

396
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:57,157
No worries.

397
00:18:57,517 --> 00:19:00,778
There are up, down, and neutral attacks that you can do with every character.

398
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,319
So every character has three normal attacks that they can do.

399
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:07,519
Ajna has combo strings and some other characters have combo strings but

400
00:19:08,075 --> 00:19:09,555
That's the basics.

401
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:13,016
That actually came from Dockery Profile.

402
00:19:13,056 --> 00:19:15,296
Give every character three different attacks

403
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:17,337
that they did in some order that you determined.

404
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:20,597
So they would do like ABC or CBA or whatever.

405
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,058
And how to give control over those things to the player.

406
00:19:26,438 --> 00:19:28,219
It wasn't even, it was definitely,

407
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:30,379
we wanna give people different attacks,

408
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:34,260
but it was mostly figuring out

409
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,180
like how to give you control over that.

410
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:43,812
that was a difficult part, because giving you like forward and backward, a lot of people

411
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:44,753
didn't find it.

412
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:48,815
Giving you up and down, more people found it, but the people that would find forward

413
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,477
and backward didn't find it, so you have to tell people anyway.

414
00:19:52,437 --> 00:20:00,543
And then like, a lot of the rest of it came from trying to make it feel as intentional

415
00:20:00,643 --> 00:20:03,144
as fighting games feel when stuff happens to you, right?

416
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:05,546
Like giving you defense as your own choice.

417
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:09,366
There's even clean block, which is like parrying or just defend.

418
00:20:09,886 --> 00:20:14,449
So if you block at the last second with a character, they're blue instead of pink,

419
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:20,292
and you get back a small amount of your action pip so you can go sooner and you won't die.

420
00:20:20,312 --> 00:20:24,675
And as you upgrade your defense, you actually heal more and more from clean blocks.

421
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:32,060
But doing that and giving you combos and making juggles matter and making how big a combo

422
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,261
you do matter and what order you do attacks in.

423
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:38,491
Putting in guard breaks that are fighting game style. So that actually came out of

424
00:20:39,391 --> 00:20:45,755
Like the way that you do guard breaks in this game is like very very fighting game light, right? If you play guilty gear which

425
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:52,798
Full disclosure a whole bunch of the meter management mechanics in this game are based on guilty gear. Oh, yeah

426
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:55,660
I'll go got an ace to kill in here somewhere

427
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,661
But about a rope cancel no

428
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:09,103
Um, yeah, actually, I mean, you can cancel attacks into supers whenever you want.

429
00:21:09,563 --> 00:21:10,144
Yeah?

430
00:21:10,524 --> 00:21:11,904
For expending meter. Yes.

431
00:21:12,464 --> 00:21:13,905
Brian, could you show us how? I don't know how.

432
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:14,345
No.

433
00:21:15,225 --> 00:21:19,246
Oh, just in the middle of one of your attacks, do a super. Super is R1 plus attack.

434
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:20,306
Oh, the super. Okay.

435
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:20,966
Yep.

436
00:21:21,987 --> 00:21:22,147
Nice.

437
00:21:22,267 --> 00:21:26,568
So yeah, the meter management stuff comes fully from Guilty Gear, right?

438
00:21:26,648 --> 00:21:29,408
So if you want to attempt to block, it costs bar.

439
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:36,247
You can still do it when you don't have bar because that was really mean to not let you block in the prototype and like

440
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:38,408
Whole bunches of people died

441
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:38,489
But

442
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:47,355
If you want to attempt defense it cost bar the better you are at defense the more bar you get back from it

443
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:50,697
And the better you are at attacking the more bar you get from that

444
00:21:50,837 --> 00:21:57,542
So the better you are on defense the more effective your offense can be because you have more bar to use

445
00:21:58,714 --> 00:22:04,377
And the better you are in offense, the more useful your defense is because spending bar doesn't matter as much

446
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,681
That is wild that was I

447
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:16,444
Loved that part of guilty gear of like there was only one resource to manage and it mattered everywhere

448
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:23,227
So I tried very hard to do exactly that same thing with this game. Totally. Let's um, if you got a second, let's talk about

449
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:27,830
Design of the individual characters. There's a good question here in chat from Theodore streams wants to know

450
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:35,497
When you were designing the game, was there ever a character that was almost scrapped because the design wasn't working or you had to redesign it completely, maybe something to do with the art?

451
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:37,759
Was there any characters that almost didn't make it?

452
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:40,281
Kushi.

453
00:22:40,841 --> 00:22:41,162
Yeah.

454
00:22:41,262 --> 00:22:41,642
Yeah.

455
00:22:42,002 --> 00:22:42,643
How come?

456
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:50,409
So, Kushi's a character you meet a little later on, and she's like a girl that has a giant bird with her.

457
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:55,353
And I think, Mike, you could probably speak to the complexity of doing the two characters in one.

458
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:55,693
Yeah.

459
00:22:55,713 --> 00:22:57,875
All right, so she's...

460
00:22:58,698 --> 00:22:59,859
Kind of Naka Ruru.

461
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:05,302
Right, so you have a bird that you can tell to do things if you're standing on the ground,

462
00:23:05,462 --> 00:23:09,324
but then if you hit up, she gets on the bird and you get a different set of attacks,

463
00:23:10,124 --> 00:23:13,446
uh, including one that's really good against groups and one that is basically

464
00:23:13,506 --> 00:23:17,128
Dragoon jump from Final Fantasy where you leave the screen for a while and then come back

465
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:22,151
and you spend all of your remaining pips to stay up and do extra damage. Oh, that's good. Um,

466
00:23:23,932 --> 00:23:24,473
She was

467
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,901
probably top two hardest characters that we actually had to implement.

468
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:34,642
Because coordinating a completely separate sprite that needs to be like

469
00:23:35,203 --> 00:23:38,983
where it has to be so that you can get on it and all the rest of that is like

470
00:23:39,564 --> 00:23:42,684
really difficult in this game because we also have

471
00:23:43,504 --> 00:23:46,505
collision to deal with so like there was a lot of

472
00:23:48,086 --> 00:23:50,986
okay well the bird gets stuck on the ceiling the bird gets stuck on a ledge

473
00:23:51,086 --> 00:23:55,047
like you can't reach the bird like telling the bird what to do

474
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:57,876
Yeah, we actually ended up

475
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:01,378
making one of those game design decisions that you

476
00:24:02,218 --> 00:24:09,161
make a lot for fun over everything where like the bird can just go through all collisions because it solved every problem and

477
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,382
Actually made everything way more enjoyable

478
00:24:11,823 --> 00:24:12,343
perfect

479
00:24:13,323 --> 00:24:15,124
Yeah in terms of animation also

480
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:19,126
You know even though they function is essentially one character

481
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:21,087
You know we had to animate

482
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,903
Kushi herself, Altun the bird, and then both of them together.

483
00:24:25,304 --> 00:24:30,007
So it was like three sets of animation to create one, you know, coherent move set.

484
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:35,492
And doing everything, right? Like you have an idol for Kushi on the ground and an idol for Kushi on the bird.

485
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:36,152
Yes, yeah.

486
00:24:36,172 --> 00:24:37,634
And it's like, wow.

487
00:24:37,674 --> 00:24:41,877
Yeah, so there's a lot of stuff that went into it. I think originally she was just cut,

488
00:24:42,137 --> 00:24:46,301
as well as Hunat and Zeebotch, which are also another like two-for-one character.

489
00:24:47,261 --> 00:24:51,025
And then we got a little bit of an extension, so we put the both of them back in.

490
00:24:51,045 --> 00:24:51,185
Yeah.

491
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,673
So like, when you get Kushii, you will notice she doesn't have supers.

492
00:25:00,695 --> 00:25:07,341
Her burn attacks do basically super damage and have basically super cooldown, but she

493
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:10,243
doesn't spend meter, she generates meter instead.

494
00:25:12,565 --> 00:25:18,050
That was a decently fun thing to have done, but it also stemmed from the fact that we

495
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,892
didn't have the resources to go and...

496
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:27,182
implement and lots of extra stuff for a character that already had lots of extra stuff. Right.

497
00:25:27,202 --> 00:25:32,383
Yeah, I can only imagine. And like, we should talk about that, because the look of this game

498
00:25:32,563 --> 00:25:36,505
is outstanding. I mean, it's striking. It's beautiful. It's vibrant. There's a good question

499
00:25:36,545 --> 00:25:41,026
in chat that lead us in here from Art of Joichi. They want to know the monster designs are cool.

500
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:44,107
So how did you decide how they attack? And how did you come up with the designs? And I would

501
00:25:44,147 --> 00:25:48,728
love to hear more in general about the inspiration for this art style and this whole vibe. I know

502
00:25:48,768 --> 00:25:50,168
there was like a real Southeast Asian.

503
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:56,505
Flavor flowing through it. So like where did you guys what inspired look at this game and the design of the monsters in the world?

504
00:25:58,585 --> 00:26:04,707
So that was something that that I think was part of the idea early on we kind of wanted to do a game in a

505
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:05,768
setting that we felt

506
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:08,409
We don't see enough of

507
00:26:19,635 --> 00:26:26,318
designer, artist on Skullgirls, Alex Ahad, you know, was a big part of it. He was the one that

508
00:26:26,338 --> 00:26:30,740
also designed all the monsters. Creator of Skullgirls, thank you. Yeah, creator of Skullgirls.

509
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:37,804
Yeah, so I think between those two things, like kind of the influence that he wanted to bring on

510
00:26:37,884 --> 00:26:41,625
and, you know, the rest of the team was really on board with this idea and kind of like researching

511
00:26:41,706 --> 00:26:47,849
and exploring and, you know, reading up and just really kind of like getting into this world

512
00:26:49,528 --> 00:26:54,689
was a huge part of just setting up the world that we see in the game.

513
00:26:55,869 --> 00:27:02,931
And I think it is very fantasy, but I think you can definitely see the inspiration, and

514
00:27:02,951 --> 00:27:10,472
I think the setting does have a very distinctly Southeast Asian feel over, I don't know, other

515
00:27:10,492 --> 00:27:10,732
stuff.

516
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:15,013
Yeah, I mean, you're not a space marine and you're not from Japan, right?

517
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:17,053
I do also want to point out that...

518
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:23,159
We got to make this choice because we were in a space where we could decide

519
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:28,362
exactly what we wanted our game to look like, but there are a lot of really talented studios

520
00:27:28,422 --> 00:27:33,444
making games in Southeast Asia. So if we can do a small bit to bring exposure to them,

521
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:40,168
that is also really gratifying for us to be able to do. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, totally. Mario,

522
00:27:40,188 --> 00:27:44,010
can you talk a bit more in depth about your inspiration and your process for designing?

523
00:27:44,715 --> 00:27:50,360
I'm presuming you you were heavily involved with that. Maybe not but like the design of the monsters and the characters how you sort of went through that

524
00:27:51,521 --> 00:27:56,585
Yeah, so so the monsters we did mostly leave to Alex that was kind of like a wheelhouse

525
00:27:56,605 --> 00:28:03,731
So we took care of that but in terms of the the characters the characters was very collaborative among amongst all our artists

526
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:10,797
And so basically the way the way it kind of ended up working was when we had the crowdfunding campaign we had

527
00:28:12,033 --> 00:28:13,354
It was kind of crazy, actually.

528
00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:16,075
We had each of our artists just kind of come up

529
00:28:16,115 --> 00:28:18,436
with a design and we would throw it out there

530
00:28:18,516 --> 00:28:20,437
once we reached a certain number of,

531
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:22,878
like a certain number of dollars raised.

532
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:24,999
Hey, if you're gonna do a crowdfunding campaign,

533
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:28,221
you might wanna plan more stuff in advance than we did.

534
00:28:28,281 --> 00:28:32,023
Yeah, I think, yeah.

535
00:28:32,103 --> 00:28:33,964
It came to the point where it was literally like,

536
00:28:34,304 --> 00:28:35,805
we need another character design

537
00:28:35,885 --> 00:28:37,045
because we're going to be coming up

538
00:28:37,105 --> 00:28:38,306
on the milestone very soon.

539
00:28:38,686 --> 00:28:39,326
Who's got what?

540
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:39,747
Right.

541
00:28:41,227 --> 00:28:43,467
So, so it was, it was kind of crazy early on.

542
00:28:43,507 --> 00:28:45,067
We were just kind of throwing things out.

543
00:28:45,888 --> 00:28:50,149
Um, and then I think the problem we realized was that, you know, we thought

544
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:53,669
we were just kind of tossing ideas out there, but then our audience grew

545
00:28:53,729 --> 00:28:55,290
really attached to the games.

546
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,070
Um, which is, which is great.

547
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:01,751
But then, you know, once we had the money and we sat down to really

548
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:05,872
figure out what this game was, we were like, okay, well, we kind of sold

549
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,313
the game on these characters.

550
00:29:07,373 --> 00:29:08,533
Now we have to make them work.

551
00:29:09,904 --> 00:29:15,348
So we had a lot of meetings kind of getting together and figuring out like,

552
00:29:15,868 --> 00:29:19,290
who do we like, who do we not like, why do we like this, why do we not like this.

553
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:24,274
We also had to cut down the number of characters from our original pitch, I think,

554
00:29:24,394 --> 00:29:26,455
just because we realized it was too ambitious.

555
00:29:27,336 --> 00:29:30,298
And deciding who to cut really sucked.

556
00:29:30,358 --> 00:29:35,041
Yeah, just off pure numbers. Like, we just couldn't make that many characters.

557
00:29:35,522 --> 00:29:37,803
Right. So let's get into that.

558
00:29:38,828 --> 00:29:45,451
Real quick. I'm curious like well further I mean for other teams like as you're trying to work through the process of winnowing down your

559
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:51,274
Your options to fit in your schedule and your budget. Like how did you decide what to cut?

560
00:29:55,336 --> 00:30:00,318
It's it's hard because it's I think it's kind of like this continual process the entire time

561
00:30:01,815 --> 00:30:06,177
You know, you always think you want to start small and like scale up, but you kind of,

562
00:30:06,617 --> 00:30:10,979
I think what always ends up happening is that you, you plan too much and then you just kind

563
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,000
of have to keep chopping as you go. Yeah, I will just admit flat out we are really bad at scope.

564
00:30:16,401 --> 00:30:20,502
I technically am really bad at scope because I'm like, well we should cut this thing,

565
00:30:20,722 --> 00:30:23,904
but like one of these parts is really cool so can we fit this somewhere else?

566
00:30:24,684 --> 00:30:28,085
And then we should cut this thing, but one of these parts is really cool,

567
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:30,326
can we fit this somewhere else? So a lot of it was just like...

568
00:30:31,387 --> 00:30:34,008
I don't want to get rid of it.

569
00:30:34,328 --> 00:30:34,589
Right.

570
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:40,592
Which then leads into us killing ourselves trying to get, you know, as much of the stuff we wanted in.

571
00:30:40,612 --> 00:30:42,854
Sorry to ruin your day.

572
00:30:43,314 --> 00:30:47,336
Yeah, but I guess, you know, in terms of like, say, cutting characters,

573
00:30:47,536 --> 00:30:51,479
it just kind of came down to, we know it'll take this long to make a character,

574
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,000
we only have this many months.

575
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:59,121
And then from that we just say, okay, well, we can make 10 or 15 or however many characters

576
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:04,506
And that's how we decide to cut stuff like that. Yeah, I think a lot of it does come down to making

577
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:10,350
like planning out each task and actually seeing where it fits into the schedule and then

578
00:31:11,191 --> 00:31:15,534
Once you see, you know, you have too many tasks for the time you have to make it then you can be like, okay

579
00:31:15,554 --> 00:31:18,236
Well now we've got to prioritize what is going to be

580
00:31:19,357 --> 00:31:23,320
You know, what's kind of the core reason we're making this game does this task?

581
00:31:23,783 --> 00:31:26,525
serve that purpose. And kind of cut it back that way.

582
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:32,568
There was a lot that triage was really useful for, because it forces you to take a hard look

583
00:31:32,588 --> 00:31:36,890
at the thing you're doing and be like, okay, this bit is really unimportant. As much as I like it,

584
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,231
we can skip it. And there were a bunch of things that I wanted to have in the game

585
00:31:40,892 --> 00:31:45,514
that we skipped, because it was just like, you know what, it's not core to the thing that we're

586
00:31:45,534 --> 00:31:49,436
doing, and it'll mean that this character doesn't get done, or we don't have this boss, or whatever.

587
00:31:49,906 --> 00:31:50,927
or we don't have cutscenes.

588
00:31:51,487 --> 00:31:54,929
You know a big one I think actually is probably the party select.

589
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:55,330
Yep.

590
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,871
We could probably talk about that.

591
00:31:57,931 --> 00:32:01,894
Well, the one that I was going to mention is Antoine and Sangmu.

592
00:32:02,314 --> 00:32:07,558
We have two characters that are fully animated that will be added to the game that didn't

593
00:32:07,618 --> 00:32:14,703
make it for initial release because the choice was actually finish polishing the entire rest

594
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:17,044
of the cast or implement these two new characters.

595
00:32:18,065 --> 00:32:18,165
Yeah.

596
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:20,726
That's kind of a no brainer.

597
00:32:21,586 --> 00:32:23,307
And like real quick, I really said, right?

598
00:32:23,928 --> 00:32:25,789
Yeah, I think a lot of people and I remember this.

599
00:32:26,129 --> 00:32:28,971
I mean, I'm pretty sure this was a Skullgirls thing a few years back,

600
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:30,012
like a lot of people don't

601
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:32,813
a lot of people who don't make games might not appreciate

602
00:32:32,874 --> 00:32:35,075
how much time it takes to implement a character like that.

603
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:40,298
You could polish, you know, tweak and like double check the entire roster

604
00:32:40,438 --> 00:32:41,439
or add two more.

605
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:44,181
And like that is such a significant amount of time and effort

606
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,002
for something that can often seem so.

607
00:32:47,427 --> 00:32:53,849
So simple on its face. Yeah, I'm also gonna tell the person playing you should totally switch targets to the ads cuz they'll kill you first

608
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:58,730
You switch targets. Okay. Thank you. Yep

609
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:05,212
Yeah, we could probably mention that the party select like we had yeah we had a whole

610
00:33:06,293 --> 00:33:12,735
mocked up and completely implemented character select screen that had a carousel and everything else. Oh, yeah, and

611
00:33:14,115 --> 00:33:16,396
It was never quite

612
00:33:17,055 --> 00:33:24,121
as good as the box version that you got for this game that was in the prototype, it was

613
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:27,844
never as intuitive as the first version that we made.

614
00:33:28,284 --> 00:33:32,388
And we spent a lot of time on it and we really tried to make it a thing that could work,

615
00:33:33,329 --> 00:33:38,553
and in the end it was slower to use, it was more difficult to use, and it was entirely

616
00:33:38,613 --> 00:33:40,315
less clear, even though it was prettier.

617
00:33:42,135 --> 00:33:45,378
pretty it had all the characters animating on the screen it was like

618
00:33:45,478 --> 00:33:50,921
glowy and everything like moved but but it was it was just kind of like too

619
00:33:50,981 --> 00:33:54,744
much to look at yeah it was kind of confusing like actually using it as a

620
00:33:54,764 --> 00:34:03,610
character so it was way harder yeah and one last thing is that I think we also

621
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:06,972
cut it because it would make loading easier on the switch right yes we cut it

622
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:11,255
because primarily the tech reason at the end is

623
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,720
in order to have that screen you have to have all those sprites loaded

624
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:22,662
and those sprites are pretty big so saving memory on the switch

625
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:26,463
meant if we could cut that screen then the switch can only

626
00:34:26,943 --> 00:34:30,064
be forced to load the npcs that are in the level and the sprites that are in

627
00:34:30,104 --> 00:34:34,506
your party currently. Right. And like that really helped so it

628
00:34:34,546 --> 00:34:37,466
was that wasn't like the sole reason but it pushed it over like

629
00:34:37,627 --> 00:34:39,247
right it was the last thing that was

630
00:34:40,793 --> 00:34:44,556
That was the point at which we were like, okay, this is we just got to stop trying to make this work.

631
00:34:44,756 --> 00:34:49,521
Yeah, and it was sad because we spent a lot of time on that screen.

632
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:50,361
Right.

633
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:54,125
I don't think anyone ever even saw it because it wasn't in the backer previews.

634
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,266
No.

635
00:34:55,406 --> 00:34:57,788
Wow, that's extra sobering.

636
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,472
This maybe it's too soon, but like...

637
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:09,207
As you look back on everything you did on this project, do you have a better idea of how you might avoid

638
00:35:09,527 --> 00:35:11,048
spending a lot of time and

639
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:16,833
Effort on something like that that ultimately just doesn't work out like is there a way you would cut it sooner on your next project?

640
00:35:17,293 --> 00:35:21,457
Or is it just something you have to feel out as you go? I?

641
00:35:22,197 --> 00:35:27,041
Feel like it's kind of both, you know like there's always gonna be things that you just can't predict

642
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:31,045
Like I always say, you know, we've made a ton of

643
00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:34,870
missteps and mistakes on this project and we'll never make those mistakes again,

644
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:39,451
but next time we'll just make a bunch of different mistakes. Oh yeah, no that's game development,

645
00:35:39,491 --> 00:35:44,293
is never making the same mistake twice but always being able to find a new one. Yeah.

646
00:35:45,494 --> 00:35:50,555
So it's weird because like there was some stuff that was cut really early and there were some

647
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:54,377
things that was like, like one of the things we had in the crowdfunding campaign was we had

648
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:57,198
different weapon sets and we tried that.

649
00:35:57,723 --> 00:36:02,945
for platforming and for combat, and it was way less fun than giving you access to everything all at once.

650
00:36:03,106 --> 00:36:04,466
And I still get people that are like,

651
00:36:04,566 --> 00:36:06,207
Oh man, I was looking forward to switching weapons.

652
00:36:06,307 --> 00:36:09,169
And it's like, we had that for like six months,

653
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:12,570
and it was really not enjoyable to do during the platforming sections.

654
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:18,714
So we unified all of the stuff that she could do into one control scheme, which took forever.

655
00:36:19,674 --> 00:36:24,637
But that was like really early on, we realized like this is not working and we can't do it.

656
00:36:25,362 --> 00:36:30,824
The character select was more like we all wanted it to be there, it just didn't work

657
00:36:31,985 --> 00:36:33,626
no matter how much we pushed at it.

658
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:37,688
And like, sometimes you'll have this cost fallacy, right, where you're like, I spent

659
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:39,909
so much time on this, I should just try to finish it up.

660
00:36:40,429 --> 00:36:43,851
And like, that's the thing that you really need to learn how to avoid in game dev is

661
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:47,092
you need to be able to objectively look at something and be like, it's not working.

662
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:47,793
Yeah, right.

663
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:52,275
It might have taken us, you know, two months of like, aggregate time, but it's really not

664
00:36:52,315 --> 00:36:54,556
working and the character select ended up being one of those.

665
00:36:55,684 --> 00:37:00,107
Yeah, I think you're right. I think a lot of the devs we talk to really appreciate outside

666
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:04,930
perspective on problems like that, whether it's playtesters or publishers and that kind of thing.

667
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:10,433
So I'm curious, let's talk about 505 and the partnership real quick. What drove you to

668
00:37:10,473 --> 00:37:17,998
seek out a publisher and why did you choose to work with 505? Money. Continue. That's a good

669
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:22,781
answer. Yeah. I mean, sure. We

670
00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:28,920
We didn't think that we could make a full game off of just crowdfunding money, and we

671
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,120
kind of wanted to really level up our team.

672
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,742
We wanted to expand on the games that we could create, and we felt that the only way to do

673
00:37:37,782 --> 00:37:41,383
that was with actual funding from a publisher.

674
00:37:42,663 --> 00:37:44,823
There are things that publishers do that...

675
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:51,720
smaller developers definitely can't, right? They have global reach, they have on-site and global

676
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,661
testers, they have people who know how to contact first parties to do things. Like we had first

677
00:37:57,701 --> 00:38:02,462
party contacts at the end of Skullgirls, but getting all of those was largely a matter of like,

678
00:38:02,742 --> 00:38:07,423
we happen to know people who now work at Sony from before, instead of like, we have a department

679
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:14,364
that can do these things, right? Also, for Sirius, like, we couldn't have asked.

680
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:19,582
the public for the amount of money that this game ended up actually costing.

681
00:38:20,242 --> 00:38:27,067
I mean, we spent our whole crowdfunding goal and all the backer stuff, which was 2.1 million,

682
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:31,030
plus the publisher contributed that amount and more.

683
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:36,054
It wasn't as much as a lot of other games of this size.

684
00:38:38,196 --> 00:38:42,699
I will not mention any names, but like, we couldn't have asked for what this game actually

685
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,280
ended up costing in terms of...

686
00:38:44,752 --> 00:38:48,813
development time and resources and money, there was no way.

687
00:38:49,713 --> 00:38:55,556
I think also, you know, working with a publisher, again, gave us

688
00:38:55,676 --> 00:38:59,617
access to like, we have, we have testers that are really great.

689
00:38:59,697 --> 00:39:02,858
And we have a QA team that, you know, like we have a producer

690
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:06,640
over at 505, a couple of producers, you know, who are

691
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,181
really hands on with the game and just making sure it works.

692
00:39:10,277 --> 00:39:17,623
Like basically they make it so that we can actually just focus on the development and not worry as much about the peripheral stuff

693
00:39:17,903 --> 00:39:22,727
Yes, like they have a submission team, right? So like we don't have to have someone who is

694
00:39:23,507 --> 00:39:27,751
talking to Sony and getting reports back and pushing the button to put patches up and like

695
00:39:28,411 --> 00:39:32,034
Scheduling releases and all that stuff, right? It's a help

696
00:39:32,815 --> 00:39:34,816
Nice

697
00:39:34,856 --> 00:39:38,179
There always are with dealing with any organization, but like it's

698
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:39,783
been exceedingly helpful.

699
00:39:40,303 --> 00:39:40,563
Good.

700
00:39:41,184 --> 00:39:43,025
I assume it's with their help that you're

701
00:39:43,065 --> 00:39:44,867
able to do as many ports as you're doing, right?

702
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:46,068
Or were those always part of the plan?

703
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:49,690
Switch definitely wasn't because it didn't exist when we

704
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,572
did the crowdfunding campaign.

705
00:39:52,052 --> 00:39:52,292
Right.

706
00:39:52,953 --> 00:39:55,735
Yes, they've been really helpful as far

707
00:39:55,815 --> 00:39:58,457
as being able to provide dev kits

708
00:39:58,577 --> 00:40:01,259
and getting us first party information

709
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:05,503
and helping us find people to do the Switch port

710
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:07,985
and us not have to worry about that as much.

711
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,484
They've been really nice to contact by the way

712
00:40:12,345 --> 00:40:20,818
Like yeah, go ahead. Oh, I've know that I was just a nice people are good. I appreciate nice people nice people are good

713
00:40:22,957 --> 00:40:26,360
I wonder if you're not comfortable or not up on this we have to talk about it

714
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,642
But you know you mentioned, you know making some changes to make things work well on the switch

715
00:40:29,662 --> 00:40:33,365
I'm curious we haven't talked to many people about what it's like to try and port games to the switch

716
00:40:33,805 --> 00:40:38,669
Have you can you talk at all about the challenges you faced or any changes you've made sort of make it run well on that?

717
00:40:39,029 --> 00:40:39,369
console

718
00:40:39,389 --> 00:40:42,471
No worries I would prefer you not to be murdered so

719
00:40:52,468 --> 00:41:02,435
The PS4 and XB1, sorry, not Xbone, I'm not a gamer anymore, have 8 gigabytes of memory

720
00:41:02,595 --> 00:41:03,956
and give you most of that.

721
00:41:04,616 --> 00:41:07,758
The Switch has 4 and gives you about half of that.

722
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:15,624
Just on that alone, we've had to do a bunch of things that we didn't have to do for other

723
00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:16,104
consoles.

724
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,083
load things earlier and unload things earlier and not keep stuff around that we just didn't

725
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:26,205
care about keeping around on the other consoles because there isn't the space for it.

726
00:41:27,746 --> 00:41:35,750
It's hard. It's not quite as hard as previous Nintendo consoles were to port for, actually.

727
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:41,072
But it's hard. In many ways it seems like the easiest Nintendo console to port to yet, but

728
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,694
who can say? No, that's definitely the case.

729
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,672
Yeah, 100% that is definitely the case

730
00:41:48,832 --> 00:41:51,854
Brian I've been kind of steamrolling over this conversation. You have any burning questions

731
00:41:51,874 --> 00:41:54,735
You want to you want to squeeze out here in the middle of this?

732
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:58,857
Not at all challenging fight

733
00:41:59,738 --> 00:42:03,380
This is a good design, I like this a lot. Yeah

734
00:42:05,701 --> 00:42:06,061
Okay, let's go

735
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:13,612
I cannot keep up talking and work on this boss.

736
00:42:14,053 --> 00:42:15,774
You're full health now.

737
00:42:16,554 --> 00:42:17,214
Chat, all right.

738
00:42:18,195 --> 00:42:18,795
Let's see.

739
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:20,696
Here we go.

740
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:24,018
AJM Games Dev wanted to know, let's talk about level design.

741
00:42:24,058 --> 00:42:26,140
What challenges did you face when laying out these levels?

742
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,681
Going from map, but wow, place to place on a map is great.

743
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:31,343
But what do you feel is the level design philosophy

744
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:32,383
of Indivisible?

745
00:42:35,065 --> 00:42:37,006
Level design is something we actually

746
00:42:37,046 --> 00:42:39,648
did have a lot of trouble with, just because I feel like we

747
00:42:40,262 --> 00:42:44,284
we weren't equipped early on to really take on the level design that we

748
00:42:44,544 --> 00:42:48,306
intended to do. Just because the nature of Metroidvanias is

749
00:42:48,926 --> 00:42:53,288
you know, lots of backtracking, lots of finding hidden paths and kind of

750
00:42:54,269 --> 00:42:55,810
you know, like they're big maps.

751
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:00,292
They were much bigger to start with.

752
00:43:00,852 --> 00:43:05,854
We, own your mistakes right? We were extremely inexperienced at level

753
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,736
design because the level for a fighting game is it's the same size.

754
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:09,176
Right.

755
00:43:09,783 --> 00:43:12,145
And it's got nothing in it. It's a floor and two walls.

756
00:43:12,285 --> 00:43:12,465
Yeah.

757
00:43:12,485 --> 00:43:13,366
And there's no collision.

758
00:43:13,806 --> 00:43:14,007
Yeah.

759
00:43:14,227 --> 00:43:15,328
Um, yeah.

760
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:21,673
So, initially when we started doing level design, uh, one of the things that I really wanted out of it,

761
00:43:21,753 --> 00:43:25,877
that we actually ended up keeping, uh, much to everyone else's chagrin,

762
00:43:26,317 --> 00:43:30,220
is you can, by the end of the game, you can walk through the entire world.

763
00:43:30,581 --> 00:43:31,421
Everything is connected.

764
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:32,142
Hmm.

765
00:43:32,322 --> 00:43:38,327
Um, you can walk, well, I mean, walk an ability, right, around the entire world without teleporting anywhere.

766
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:46,228
So that meant that every level had to be connected to one on each side of it at least, right?

767
00:43:46,308 --> 00:43:46,608
Yeah.

768
00:43:46,928 --> 00:43:54,414
Which meant that there needed to not be like, this is a side with nothing in it, and that was a giant challenge for everybody.

769
00:43:55,695 --> 00:44:02,099
We went through a huge number of paths of designs for what each level was going to be.

770
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,101
They were all way too big when we started.

771
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:16,754
I will specifically say Matthew Kumar and JP and Earl went through and did a lot of

772
00:44:16,814 --> 00:44:21,837
work to get the level down to a manageable size while still keeping the goals that we

773
00:44:21,878 --> 00:44:22,518
initially had.

774
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:25,580
That I will specifically talk about.

775
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:30,964
One of the things that Matthew asked us when he finally became part of the team was...

776
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:34,494
for each level, like, what are the important things for this?

777
00:44:34,634 --> 00:44:37,536
And what are the goals that you want people to get out of this level?

778
00:44:37,576 --> 00:44:39,939
Which is like, I'm dumb and we never thought about that.

779
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,903
And it became making each of the giant levels that we had, like

780
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:50,188
Desert, which you're not at yet, was four times as big as it is.

781
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:55,153
And it was just. Confusing and gigantic and like.

782
00:44:56,207 --> 00:45:02,990
horrid. And there was never the question of like, what do you actually want out of this level? Like,

783
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:08,893
what's the important feature here? Right, I think in addition to that, you know, just tackling level

784
00:45:08,913 --> 00:45:13,875
design, which is something we hadn't done as a studio, you know, we also had to beef up our

785
00:45:13,975 --> 00:45:18,637
environment art team because we didn't, you know, we had individual artists on Skullgirls just kind

786
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:25,720
of like handling each stage, but now we have an environment art team. Artists. Really?

787
00:45:26,248 --> 00:45:27,528
Wasn't it just Willie?

788
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:29,749
No, there were other people.

789
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:40,292
And, yeah, so I think trying to find that balance of like, okay, we want to make, you know, this level design as good as possible.

790
00:45:40,332 --> 00:45:48,854
We want it to be the right size, but we also, like, we couldn't make it too big just because the environment art team couldn't keep up with the scale of the levels that they were, you know, early on.

791
00:45:49,335 --> 00:45:53,956
It was just too much to add art to because our artists are basically...

792
00:45:54,477 --> 00:45:57,378
hand placing every single object that you see in the background.

793
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:01,360
You know, we did have like some prefabs but a lot of it was just

794
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,462
built from scratch. So finding that balance

795
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:11,164
between, you know, fun level design that kind of like helps the game feel long

796
00:46:11,204 --> 00:46:15,186
enough overall, also kind of fitting in the story, like

797
00:46:15,226 --> 00:46:21,029
where the cut scenes were in the level, and then actually arting it all. It was

798
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:23,290
just, I don't think we...

799
00:46:24,429 --> 00:46:29,052
knew what we were in for? Nope. Right. I think that's basically the slogan for this project.

800
00:46:29,933 --> 00:46:35,698
Yeah, there was a lot. I do want to offer a special shout out to our environment art team

801
00:46:36,138 --> 00:46:41,863
who basically never complained the entire time. They should have. And we're just like,

802
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:48,608
okay, what do you need done? We got it. Wow. Yeah, I mean... People on cutscenes also, same deal.

803
00:46:48,628 --> 00:46:50,069
They were never like...

804
00:46:51,872 --> 00:46:55,794
You need to cut this part of the game explicitly because it's too much environment art.

805
00:46:55,874 --> 00:47:00,616
Like we ended up having to notice that and like ask for being told that.

806
00:47:01,757 --> 00:47:04,598
Um, yeah, they were pretty gung-ho to just do whatever.

807
00:47:04,618 --> 00:47:09,341
Yeah, but I mean as a result it looks amazing. Yeah, it looks gorgeous.

808
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:13,523
Yeah, I mean the whole look and vibe of this game is uh is outstanding.

809
00:47:13,783 --> 00:47:16,325
Um, I was gonna ask, you know, what you can just jump up that by the way.

810
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:22,086
Like you're outside and the fortress is falling, so you have low gravity so you can just jump that whole way.

811
00:47:22,266 --> 00:47:24,228
Nobody's watching or anything, just, you know, don't worry about it.

812
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:24,608
Right.

813
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,250
Ugh!

814
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:34,357
Um, I was, yeah, I was gonna ask, like, how did you, you know, what did you prioritize when polishing your level design,

815
00:47:34,397 --> 00:47:37,640
but it sounds like you had to figure that out as well as you were going.

816
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,041
Yeah.

817
00:47:39,061 --> 00:47:42,705
Uh, yeah, so, let's see, let's see, we have so many fucking good questions here in chat.

818
00:47:44,427 --> 00:47:49,671
Let's see. Nope, nope, nope. All right. Brian, is there a way we can get rid of the mouse cursor?

819
00:47:49,691 --> 00:47:54,054
Good question. I already got rid of that mouse cursor. Thanks, Alex, for spending two minutes of

820
00:47:54,074 --> 00:47:59,277
our precious stream on that. Yeah, anytime. Ominous here has a good question about sort of like

821
00:47:59,758 --> 00:48:04,501
organization and ties back into art design. How much do you let your staff provide creative input?

822
00:48:05,061 --> 00:48:08,844
How do you organize staff input and how do you keep that input from clashing during production?

823
00:48:11,192 --> 00:48:13,052
I think everyone has say...

824
00:48:13,072 --> 00:48:14,733
I have a separate answer for this question.

825
00:48:14,773 --> 00:48:16,653
Yeah, okay.

826
00:48:17,013 --> 00:48:21,075
Yeah, that was exactly what I was going to say, and I do not mean to speak over you.

827
00:48:21,135 --> 00:48:25,496
Sure, sure. Well, I was just going to say everyone, we encourage everyone to speak up

828
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:30,697
just because I think a lot of the issues we ran into development, we were able to

829
00:48:31,357 --> 00:48:36,399
kind of like avoid or circumvent because someone spoke up and just gave us an opinion that we

830
00:48:36,419 --> 00:48:37,039
weren't expecting.

831
00:48:37,861 --> 00:48:40,683
So we do try to encourage everyone to speak up as much as possible.

832
00:48:42,104 --> 00:48:46,546
But I think, like Mike, you and I, we're both kind of like the vision holders.

833
00:48:47,567 --> 00:48:49,828
So we know what we want out of the game.

834
00:48:50,568 --> 00:48:58,253
And so, you know, we're always listening to feedback, but ultimately, once a decision needs to be made, it's going to be made by you or I, essentially.

835
00:48:58,993 --> 00:48:59,133
I...

836
00:48:59,153 --> 00:49:05,417
Oh, wow. It's actually the end of his beam from outside.

837
00:49:05,437 --> 00:49:06,678
I thought I'd wait that longer.

838
00:49:07,202 --> 00:49:11,865
Nice. Okay, that's a good bug. And I should remember about that.

839
00:49:13,686 --> 00:49:17,669
Right, that was the thing I was gonna say is like, we are, as far as feedback goes,

840
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:22,693
completely flat. And I don't want us to change that. I've worked at places where it was like,

841
00:49:23,534 --> 00:49:27,116
you say, you would say something about art, and the artist would be like, well, you're not an

842
00:49:27,196 --> 00:49:32,560
artist. Who cares? Right? And like, the artist would come to a designer and be like, this part's

843
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:36,263
been really frustrating, like, in me just playing it because I'm arting this part.

844
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,212
And the designer would be like, yeah, well, you're not a designer, so shut up.

845
00:49:39,632 --> 00:49:39,992
Get out.

846
00:49:40,032 --> 00:49:45,436
Like that sucks, because the feedback that you get, that's usually the most useful

847
00:49:45,496 --> 00:49:47,818
is from the people that aren't in your discipline, right?

848
00:49:47,858 --> 00:49:52,141
Because they notice things that you are not trained or are trained to not notice

849
00:49:52,641 --> 00:49:59,146
anymore. And like I try to listen to absolutely everybody from everywhere at

850
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:03,949
all times. And then like the way that I put it on Skullgirls was I'll listen to

851
00:50:04,049 --> 00:50:05,510
everybody, but the decision is mine.

852
00:50:06,585 --> 00:50:12,930
And we got a bunch of good features on SG actually, like the hold to pause, the holding

853
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:16,632
start to pause the game so that you can't accidentally do it by brushing the start button

854
00:50:16,652 --> 00:50:21,556
while you're playing, came from a random person on the internet, I mean, he's not going to

855
00:50:21,596 --> 00:50:25,739
think he's random, but, who had a bunch of other suggestions that got ignored, but that

856
00:50:25,819 --> 00:50:26,560
one was amazing.

857
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:30,883
So you never know where an insanely good suggestion is going to come from, I mean that one got

858
00:50:30,923 --> 00:50:32,825
adopted by Fighting Games all over now.

859
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:36,247
And it's the same from your development team, right?

860
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:42,362
You never know who's going to suggest something that's totally going to change the way that you were thinking about something.

861
00:50:42,382 --> 00:50:53,888
But I still believe that the best games come from one person's vision or one person's vision for a part of it.

862
00:50:54,028 --> 00:50:59,331
Right. If you if you have a collaboration for everything, it'll get super watered down at the end.

863
00:50:59,391 --> 00:51:02,913
So you need to be able to give people ownership of their parts.

864
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:03,714
Yeah.

865
00:51:05,155 --> 00:51:12,958
I've often thought that the way that you get a really good game is by having someone who has a vision at the beginning,

866
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:20,181
but then can properly communicate that vision to a team of people who will then believe in it and help you execute it, right?

867
00:51:20,461 --> 00:51:23,062
Because it's not just about one person knowing what they want.

868
00:51:23,162 --> 00:51:28,504
It's about one person being able to explain to other people so that they also know what they want.

869
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:32,674
Yeah, if no one knows what they want, you're not going to get anything.

870
00:51:32,774 --> 00:51:36,015
But if only one person ever knows what the team wants,

871
00:51:36,295 --> 00:51:39,117
you're also not going to get anything because that's going to be

872
00:51:39,157 --> 00:51:40,137
micromanaging hell.

873
00:51:41,618 --> 00:51:43,318
Yeah, that makes you want to go up outside.

874
00:51:43,498 --> 00:51:47,300
I'll help you because I'm here because we have less than 10 minutes left.

875
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,781
So if you have any good questions for these two good people, please

876
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:52,362
put them in chat within the next eight minutes or so.

877
00:51:53,383 --> 00:51:55,243
Before we get out of here, I kind of want to know.

878
00:51:56,091 --> 00:51:57,211
I mean, I want to know how it's doing.

879
00:51:57,552 --> 00:51:59,872
You launched recently and hopefully it's all going well.

880
00:51:59,892 --> 00:52:02,113
But I also want to know what motivated your decision

881
00:52:02,173 --> 00:52:03,254
to sell the game where you do.

882
00:52:03,294 --> 00:52:06,175
I mean, when we talk to designers now and developers,

883
00:52:06,315 --> 00:52:09,776
so often a major point of contention is which storefront

884
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:11,717
to put the game on and which service to put it out on.

885
00:52:11,737 --> 00:52:14,718
And that seems only likely to grow more contentious

886
00:52:14,878 --> 00:52:15,598
in the years ahead.

887
00:52:15,919 --> 00:52:18,419
So tell me, how did you think about how to sell this game

888
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:19,980
and sort of why did you put it out the way you did?

889
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,041
I guess, I mean-

890
00:52:23,681 --> 00:52:24,382
I don't know.

891
00:52:24,762 --> 00:52:25,262
I don't know.

892
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:32,433
I mean, I guess you're referring to like Steam versus Epic now is kind of the discussion that we're having right?

893
00:52:32,493 --> 00:52:38,956
I mean, I guess I guess for us epic came so late in the game that it just didn't really impact our decision at all

894
00:52:40,216 --> 00:52:41,277
I mean it just

895
00:52:41,877 --> 00:52:46,940
Sorry, some part of it was that we already had a steam version that worked, right? Yeah

896
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:53,363
Yeah, so it you know consoles and PC Mac Linux. Yep

897
00:52:54,053 --> 00:52:57,395
was just basically it at the time that we made the decision.

898
00:52:58,015 --> 00:53:01,297
Steam was the thing, and so that's just kind of what we followed through.

899
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,258
So we haven't been too...

900
00:53:04,638 --> 00:53:04,978
Hello?

901
00:53:05,279 --> 00:53:07,580
Hello? I'm not gonna say anything.

902
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,101
I'm not gonna say anything.

903
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:10,881
I actually don't know what's happening.

904
00:53:11,942 --> 00:53:15,544
There's been a lot of things exposed about the Epic Store, like that they

905
00:53:16,384 --> 00:53:19,746
give your information to their Chinese owner.

906
00:53:20,503 --> 00:53:20,903
Oh yeah.

907
00:53:20,983 --> 00:53:21,723
And all that stuff.

908
00:53:21,863 --> 00:53:23,284
So to me, personally...

909
00:53:23,304 --> 00:53:23,824
Before we...

910
00:53:24,344 --> 00:53:25,425
Before we wander down that path,

911
00:53:25,485 --> 00:53:26,885
I just really want to make sure that was actually fact...

912
00:53:27,545 --> 00:53:28,786
Like, confirmed, because that was a...

913
00:53:29,346 --> 00:53:30,826
Weird thing for a minute, I recall.

914
00:53:30,887 --> 00:53:31,467
Sorry.

915
00:53:31,507 --> 00:53:32,747
It was a weird thing for a minute.

916
00:53:33,187 --> 00:53:34,948
I have no idea whether it was factually confirmed,

917
00:53:34,988 --> 00:53:37,129
because we didn't come out on the Epic Store.

918
00:53:37,209 --> 00:53:37,889
So, but...

919
00:53:38,189 --> 00:53:38,649
Yeah, I don't...

920
00:53:38,709 --> 00:53:39,109
I don't want to...

921
00:53:39,129 --> 00:53:40,690
I'm not trying to defend the Epic Store here.

922
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:41,270
I'm just trying to...

923
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,891
Make sure our claims...

924
00:53:43,571 --> 00:53:44,731
You know, we're on a livestream here,

925
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:46,472
so we don't have the luxury of an editor.

926
00:53:47,152 --> 00:53:47,572
So, like...

927
00:53:47,632 --> 00:53:48,313
Some have said...

928
00:53:50,178 --> 00:53:57,923
I mean, I think the bigger point is just that, you know, Steam was our option when we were deciding, and so that's what we just stuck with.

929
00:53:58,344 --> 00:54:07,810
Steam was also really damn helpful on SG, and some part of it is... I already know how Steam works.

930
00:54:08,771 --> 00:54:17,117
Like, a lot... Some of it was, we had a Steam build that worked. Some of it was we already worked with Steam, so we know how to like...

931
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,363
put things up and test them and distribute them to everybody and all that.

932
00:54:21,164 --> 00:54:23,846
And Epic showed up really late in our development cycle.

933
00:54:24,867 --> 00:54:26,729
That does seem like a very clean answer.

934
00:54:27,509 --> 00:54:28,790
We only have a few minutes left here.

935
00:54:29,491 --> 00:54:31,172
I do want to get in before we go.

936
00:54:31,233 --> 00:54:36,837
Mariel, we've asked about, we've low-key asked about the art style for this game.

937
00:54:37,738 --> 00:54:41,602
I'm going to say something that is not true, which is a dumb...

938
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:44,703
what I might call a dumb gamer thought, sorry gamers,

939
00:54:46,344 --> 00:54:50,525
is that 2D art is easy because it's not 3D art, and even though the character is

940
00:54:50,545 --> 00:54:55,087
moving in a 2D space, that therefore is easier than a 3D

941
00:54:55,107 --> 00:54:56,587
space because there's a whole other dimension.

942
00:54:57,047 --> 00:55:02,629
Again, not a good thought. What is it? But I mean, I get it, I get it.

943
00:55:03,089 --> 00:55:07,611
So 2D animation, you know, it is hard.

944
00:55:08,111 --> 00:55:11,272
I think another thing that people don't really know about it is that it's not

945
00:55:11,352 --> 00:55:11,552
cheap.

946
00:55:12,027 --> 00:55:13,528
Yeah.

947
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:15,509
And especially the type that we do

948
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:17,671
where we are actually hand animating,

949
00:55:19,132 --> 00:55:22,395
you know, we're drawing every frame by hand, essentially.

950
00:55:23,076 --> 00:55:25,458
I think there are ways to make 2D animation cheaper.

951
00:55:25,498 --> 00:55:28,620
Like if you use, you know, flash style animation

952
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,202
that are kind of like more like puppets.

953
00:55:31,182 --> 00:55:34,425
But I guess for what we specialize in as a studio,

954
00:55:34,485 --> 00:55:37,628
we really care about, you know, hand drawn animation

955
00:55:37,648 --> 00:55:38,949
and where we're doing every frame,

956
00:55:38,989 --> 00:55:41,331
we can kind of make everything as expressive as we want.

957
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:45,438
We think it looks great, you know?

958
00:55:46,399 --> 00:55:50,862
So there's definitely challenges for sure.

959
00:55:51,102 --> 00:55:54,705
One is just that there aren't as many 2D animators

960
00:55:54,825 --> 00:55:58,148
that do this kind of stuff as there are 3D, I think.

961
00:55:59,309 --> 00:56:02,551
Especially, I think, 2D game animators,

962
00:56:02,671 --> 00:56:05,914
because this is something that I've given GDC talks about,

963
00:56:05,974 --> 00:56:09,316
you know, just the specificities of game animation.

964
00:56:10,208 --> 00:56:13,189
is different than just animating for a movie or a TV show.

965
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:15,630
So it's like a subset of a subset.

966
00:56:16,751 --> 00:56:18,831
And finding people that can do that really well

967
00:56:18,951 --> 00:56:19,812
is really difficult.

968
00:56:20,872 --> 00:56:23,213
And then there's a lot of technical constraints.

969
00:56:23,273 --> 00:56:25,334
Like, we can't really have skins.

970
00:56:25,534 --> 00:56:28,135
We can't, you know, we can't apply spray.

971
00:56:28,475 --> 00:56:30,616
Like if we wanted to do the equivalent

972
00:56:30,696 --> 00:56:32,237
of a different outfit, you know,

973
00:56:32,317 --> 00:56:35,238
or like swap a skin on a rig, like we can't do that.

974
00:56:35,618 --> 00:56:38,179
We just have to redraw the entire thing.

975
00:56:39,275 --> 00:56:42,897
The extent of the customization we can do is like colors?

976
00:56:43,217 --> 00:56:50,222
Yeah, we can do attached things to characters, but that requires going through every frame and adding a point for the thing to be attached.

977
00:56:50,682 --> 00:57:00,348
And then animating the thing to have a frame that is in whatever attitude it needs to be for as many different versions of it as we need to fit the character.

978
00:57:00,368 --> 00:57:05,672
Yeah, like a good example of that is in Skullgirls we have this character Beowulf, who's a wrestler.

979
00:57:06,808 --> 00:57:11,391
And he has this folding chair that he can have either on him or off him.

980
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:18,097
And for every frame of animation of Beowulf, we had to match it to a frame of the chair

981
00:57:18,617 --> 00:57:23,041
and then designate on the frame of the character where the chair went.

982
00:57:24,422 --> 00:57:28,725
So you can't just attach it to the character. It's all hand done.

983
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:30,287
You also have an example from this game.

984
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:35,551
Whenever any of the battles end and the incarnations go back inside Ajna, they go back inside her forehead.

985
00:57:36,608 --> 00:57:41,570
That meant going through every frame of her and putting a point on the forehead so that they had some place on that art

986
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:43,311
That they knew where to go, right?

987
00:57:44,651 --> 00:57:48,553
I will also mention since you talked a bunch about the art side of it

988
00:57:49,773 --> 00:57:56,176
2d is not any simpler as far as tech goes and in fact, it's more difficult than basic 3d

989
00:57:57,156 --> 00:57:58,677
for tech because

990
00:57:59,217 --> 00:58:05,099
Graphics hardware is designed around give me a whole bunch of textures all at once leave them there and then use them

991
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:09,232
Right? Like, texture this guy's chest and texture the wall,

992
00:58:09,332 --> 00:58:15,315
and then leave those textures in graphics memory and send a new model that puts the texture somewhere every frame.

993
00:58:16,296 --> 00:58:21,298
In 2D, since you have a texture that is changing, basically,

994
00:58:21,398 --> 00:58:25,120
and all of these frames of animation definitely do not fit on a graphics card at once,

995
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:30,283
you have to update a texture every frame, and graphics hardware is really bad about that.

996
00:58:30,523 --> 00:58:35,325
Especially when it's a large texture, so we had to do a huge amount to decompress and update everything.

997
00:58:36,569 --> 00:58:39,269
much more than we would have had to do if we made the game 3D.

998
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:45,971
Also, the short version of 2D is easier than 3D is

999
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:50,252
look at Guilty Gear Xrd, right? They made that game

1000
00:58:50,412 --> 00:58:55,573
look 2D via 3D and it was way more work than just making it look 3D.

1001
00:58:56,553 --> 00:58:59,974
But it looks incredible. They've even given talks and

1002
00:59:00,154 --> 00:59:03,415
published papers on how much more work it was

1003
00:59:03,775 --> 00:59:04,995
to get 3D that looks 2D.

1004
00:59:05,769 --> 00:59:08,070
So 2D is more work.

1005
00:59:08,451 --> 00:59:08,811
Right on.

1006
00:59:08,851 --> 00:59:11,313
Yeah, not more, but an equivalent amount.

1007
00:59:11,453 --> 00:59:12,554
I don't think anyone was saying that.

1008
00:59:12,594 --> 00:59:16,737
I was just making it using a dumb argument to get to a helpful lesson.

1009
00:59:16,757 --> 00:59:20,300
No, but it is an argument that we have heard a lot.

1010
00:59:21,982 --> 00:59:26,706
I think my favorite is when we initially did the Skullgirls crowdfunding campaign,

1011
00:59:28,007 --> 00:59:32,410
people were so upset over the cost of just doing a single DLC character.

1012
00:59:33,456 --> 00:59:40,880
So we would get comments like, you know, why does it cost this much, this cost as much as my house, I can do this for free, I can do this for free in a weekend.

1013
00:59:40,981 --> 00:59:44,283
And we were like, please try, please do that, I want to see that.

1014
00:59:44,663 --> 00:59:49,626
That's actually one of the reasons we started all the open development stuff, is so that we could show people like,

1015
00:59:50,327 --> 00:59:53,869
y'all are talking crap about game development, this is what we're actually doing for it.

1016
00:59:54,229 --> 00:59:54,990
Yeah.

1017
00:59:55,390 --> 01:00:01,974
Yeah, the, this character cost more than my house was my favorite comment out of everything because...

1018
01:00:02,277 --> 01:00:04,037
That doesn't even have anything to do with gamedev.

1019
01:00:04,077 --> 01:00:07,338
That was just like, OK, try paying 12 people for three months.

1020
01:00:07,738 --> 01:00:08,979
It costs as much as your house.

1021
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:10,659
Yeah, right. Yeah.

1022
01:00:10,699 --> 01:00:12,460
It's just what those people are even doing.

1023
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:13,480
It's wild.

1024
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,621
I mean, dispelling the myths of Iran game development is half the reason we're here.

1025
01:00:16,701 --> 01:00:18,241
So, I mean, we're all about it.

1026
01:00:19,302 --> 01:00:21,742
Yeah. Sometimes I make bad gamer arguments.

1027
01:00:22,963 --> 01:00:26,884
I can I can I can summon my 13 year old self who was arguing on forums

1028
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:29,745
the way Anja summons her friends from her head.

1029
01:00:30,462 --> 01:00:34,883
Um, Alex, I'm sorry to cut you off. Everyone in chat, um, thank you for your wonderful questions.

1030
01:00:35,143 --> 01:00:38,304
Uh, I hate to do this to everyone, but if we keep going, we're just gonna turn into...

1031
01:00:38,604 --> 01:00:41,865
This one hour stream is gonna turn into a two hour stream, and I would normally like that,

1032
01:00:41,905 --> 01:00:46,527
but someone has to transcribe parts of it, so I want to make it easy for them.

1033
01:00:46,827 --> 01:00:51,789
That someone is sometimes me. Um, uh, with that, thank you all for the

1034
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,930
five hour stream from Almighty Mintz. Um, God.

1035
01:00:56,577 --> 01:01:01,680
Not not here and keep talking extra life is coming up. No, we're not gonna do that. No anyway

1036
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,421
Um, so thank you all for watching the GDC twitch channel

1037
01:01:04,721 --> 01:01:10,304
Um, the GDC is game developers conference. We as you can see from my screen, we're gonna be happening next March in

1038
01:01:11,204 --> 01:01:15,626
From the 16th and 20th. I just said look at my own monitor to confirm the dates

1039
01:01:17,127 --> 01:01:20,207
Well, if you were yourself a game developer, we would love to have you out there.

1040
01:01:20,267 --> 01:01:22,488
We are past the point of talk submissions, unfortunately.

1041
01:01:22,848 --> 01:01:26,148
We really hope, however, that you come out and check out some great talks.

1042
01:01:26,268 --> 01:01:30,289
If you stick around this channel, if you click the follow button, you will get to, you know,

1043
01:01:30,389 --> 01:01:33,790
sometimes we just roll some talks on the channel, roll our old interviews, you know, you can

1044
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:38,851
know, but also more importantly, you get notifications when we go live with people like Mike and

1045
01:01:38,891 --> 01:01:41,191
Mariel, which thank you both so much.

1046
01:01:41,671 --> 01:01:43,911
Every time we have a stream where the devs just.

1047
01:01:44,512 --> 01:01:49,978
talk and don't stop talking, I am so thankful because A, it makes playing the game easy,

1048
01:01:50,299 --> 01:01:52,401
and B, it makes asking the questions easy.

1049
01:01:52,722 --> 01:01:57,027
And you two have been a fountain of knowledge today.

1050
01:01:57,748 --> 01:01:58,329
And I'm very thankful.

1051
01:01:58,349 --> 01:01:59,450
You were actually very helpful.

1052
01:02:00,151 --> 01:02:01,312
You found the one bug and I...

1053
01:02:02,298 --> 01:02:06,961
We don't have a good metric for how long it takes to complete the game yet, so an hour for Hamana was pretty helpful.

1054
01:02:07,221 --> 01:02:11,885
Right on. And also, I tossed Mariel. I showed Mariel a bug earlier that I stumbled on.

1055
01:02:12,225 --> 01:02:14,366
But it was small. Very minor shader thing.

1056
01:02:14,687 --> 01:02:20,110
Anyway, Alex, if they have any questions more, we got so many great folks in chat asking questions.

1057
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:22,872
Where should they ask them? Where's the best place to actually get an answer?

1058
01:02:22,892 --> 01:02:24,333
Because apparently Mike's bad at Twitter.

1059
01:02:25,674 --> 01:02:28,176
Oh, I have a Twitter. I'm just bad at every Twitter that's not mine.

1060
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:35,922
Yeah, I mean we have, we're active on our Steam community page, you can tweet us at labzerogames.

1061
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:47,427
If you have complaints as a backer, please email us, indiegogo at labzerogames.com, we'll try to get back to one of our almost a thousand emails from backers right now.

1062
01:02:47,447 --> 01:02:49,868
That's the other side of crowdfunding.

1063
01:02:52,383 --> 01:02:58,466
Yeah, shouldn't be too hard to find us, just feel free to reach out and we're around for sure.

1064
01:02:58,606 --> 01:03:03,768
If you have complaints for me specifically, you can add Mike Z Says SEZ on Twitter.

1065
01:03:04,629 --> 01:03:07,070
I'm at KinuCakes on Twitter.

1066
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:08,991
And you have to say that forever.

1067
01:03:09,531 --> 01:03:09,911
Why?

1068
01:03:10,192 --> 01:03:10,512
Cakes.

1069
01:03:10,932 --> 01:03:12,193
Oh, oh it's fine.

1070
01:03:13,393 --> 01:03:20,297
Yeah, I mean, I don't chat back much to people, but I'm always, you know.

1071
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:23,739
watching and thankful for all the positivity that comes in.

1072
01:03:24,219 --> 01:03:27,562
For full home, the game is indivisible. It's out on PC and

1073
01:03:27,602 --> 01:03:31,485
consoles. We recommend I personal statement, I recommend

1074
01:03:31,505 --> 01:03:34,407
you check it out. Even though I backed it up. Like I said, I

1075
01:03:34,447 --> 01:03:38,130
backed it in to go go. And I have we have friends who work on

1076
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,212
we have friends of the show who work on the game. It's just

1077
01:03:40,292 --> 01:03:43,415
cool. That whole hour was just cool. That boss fight was cool,

1078
01:03:43,455 --> 01:03:46,437
even though it made me want to pull my hair out. Thank you,

1079
01:03:46,497 --> 01:03:49,079
everyone. Have a good day. Goodbye.
