1
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:08,720
So thank you so much for being here.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,803
We came from Austria, as you might hear eventually,

3
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:16,266
and we're super excited to bring our knowledge to you guys.

4
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,908
Today, we want to talk about tackling

5
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:20,169
audience experiences in games.

6
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:23,312
So not looking at games from the typical player's

7
00:00:23,312 --> 00:00:25,433
point of view, but there are also other people

8
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:28,276
who might be interested in the game.

9
00:00:28,276 --> 00:00:32,779
But first things first, let me quickly introduce ourselves.

10
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:33,880
So my name is Johanna Birke.

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,412
And my name is Rainer Angewand.

12
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:41,720
I'm a researcher and I'm a lecturer at the Graz University of Technology in Austria.

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,222
So I'm coming from the academic side.

14
00:00:43,222 --> 00:00:48,169
And I'm CEO and co-founder of the Austrian-based indie studio Rearbyte.

15
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:51,748
So my background, I have a PhD in computer science.

16
00:00:51,748 --> 00:00:55,389
I love doing research, I love doing data analysis,

17
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,829
like machine learning.

18
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:59,389
I love looking at the player's point of view

19
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:01,210
through this data analysis.

20
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,630
I also do AI research.

21
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,811
So everything very academic versus very researchy.

22
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:09,932
Well, I'm not a doctor, but I've been working a lot in games

23
00:01:09,932 --> 00:01:13,972
and our company has published about 25 titles

24
00:01:13,972 --> 00:01:15,273
on all the major platforms.

25
00:01:15,273 --> 00:01:18,613
So we're into creating, developing, and publishing games.

26
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:24,123
All I can publish is papers as an academic,

27
00:01:24,123 --> 00:01:27,545
which is also lovely because I can gather knowledge

28
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,407
and bring it to the people by publishing those papers.

29
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:34,169
And to publish those papers, I obviously need data.

30
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:37,451
But again, when I do not develop games or publish games,

31
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:39,532
I don't have often access to this data.

32
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:39,832
So...

33
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:44,334
Yeah, luckily our games produce a lot of data

34
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:45,935
that can be used for analyzing them.

35
00:01:46,597 --> 00:01:51,339
So we found that being a researcher at a research institution

36
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:54,100
and working together with an indie game studio

37
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,101
is a very, very good benefit for both of us

38
00:01:57,101 --> 00:02:01,403
because I can use this data to help their studio

39
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:02,043
to improve their games.

40
00:02:02,043 --> 00:02:05,164
On the other hand, I can also use this data

41
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:08,746
to publish interesting contributions for the community.

42
00:02:08,746 --> 00:02:11,387
So we found this is something which we have in common,

43
00:02:11,387 --> 00:02:13,728
but there's also something else we do have in common.

44
00:02:14,248 --> 00:02:15,869
We both love streaming.

45
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,329
So I love streaming games.

46
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,190
I'm a streamer myself.

47
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,491
I'm not a good streamer or popular streamer,

48
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:21,491
but I enjoy it myself.

49
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:25,953
And what I found most interesting actually

50
00:02:25,953 --> 00:02:28,414
was looking at the chat while streaming.

51
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,615
Because looking at the chat,

52
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:34,577
there's something going on which is so different

53
00:02:34,577 --> 00:02:37,818
compared to what we have when designing games.

54
00:02:37,818 --> 00:02:40,839
So there's the entire population of spectators.

55
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,626
and we wanted to find out more about those spectators through data analysis.

56
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:52,312
Yeah, well I've also gained a lot of experience in streaming. It's more about streaming development

57
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:55,996
and playtesting of our games. So, yeah, today...

58
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,143
We want to talk about this spectator.

59
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:04,987
Who is a spectator and how can we design

60
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:06,308
to engage spectators?

61
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:10,731
And last but not least, we want to give away

62
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:13,113
some evaluation strategies that we use together

63
00:03:13,113 --> 00:03:13,994
in this field.

64
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:18,982
So we will give this talk a little bit from the researcher's perspective and then also

65
00:03:18,982 --> 00:03:21,786
from the designer developer's perspective.

66
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:28,415
So when we think about a spectator, we need to first find a proper definition for a spectator.

67
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:31,400
A spectator can be found in so many different and several places.

68
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,363
A spectator can be someone watching a stream without any action, just being there and watching a streamer.

69
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:45,186
But it can be also someone who is really involved and really engaged, constantly interacting with the streamer

70
00:03:45,186 --> 00:03:50,049
and with other spectators through the chat, for example, asking questions, making comments.

71
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:58,312
It can be also someone who is just sitting at home, maybe a parent watching over the shoulder of the child playing a video game,

72
00:03:58,312 --> 00:04:00,913
maybe being invested, maybe not at all.

73
00:04:00,913 --> 00:04:08,996
But it could be also a fan in a stadium filled with thousands of fans enjoying together a StarCraft play.

74
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:15,301
So spectators can be found in so many several places and we also need to consider the different

75
00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:21,226
types of spectators with different backgrounds. For this talk we want to use a definition of

76
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:27,291
spectators, that spectators are basically people who follow the gameplay in real time without being

77
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:32,575
the main player in the game. Eventually they have impact on the game to some extent which

78
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:34,576
we'll hear later but it's not the main focus.

79
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:41,322
But first let us take a step back and see what is important for the player.

80
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:46,384
So the player wants to have a good playing and streaming experience.

81
00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:54,186
And a player wants interaction possibilities with the viewers that are there in the chat or viewing on site for example.

82
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:59,829
It's all about entertaining those viewers and retaining those viewers.

83
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:05,573
And in the end, the goal is to build a community around the game, the player, and the stream, for example.

84
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,024
When you design a video game for a spectator, however,

85
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:11,026
you need to think of different aspects.

86
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:13,588
Because as soon as a player would enter a stream,

87
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:16,850
the spectator must immediately know what's going on,

88
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,212
understand the gameplay mechanics, and so on.

89
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:22,414
You should think of different interaction possibilities

90
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:25,176
with either the player or with the other viewers.

91
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:27,778
They want to be entertained, surprised,

92
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:30,300
so they have different motives for coming to the stream.

93
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,202
Or they just want to be part of the community

94
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:33,483
as a social aspect.

95
00:05:34,522 --> 00:05:35,678
need to know that.

96
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:39,214
Fans and spectators is something different.

97
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:44,438
A fan can become to a, a spectator can become to a fan,

98
00:05:44,438 --> 00:05:47,481
but they don't start off as a fan immediately.

99
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:51,164
So fans are usually motivated by a lot of achievements.

100
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:53,506
However, a spectator can be motivated

101
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:55,748
by so many different things

102
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:59,151
without the necessity that they are fans.

103
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,573
They can just enjoy the aesthetics of the game,

104
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:04,616
this drama or the skill of players.

105
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:11,798
There are different strategies which are definitely interesting for us as game designers,

106
00:06:11,798 --> 00:06:15,340
how to make views to fans, but that's probably a different talk.

107
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:21,282
Today we want to focus on the motives for the spectators and what's interesting about that.

108
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:31,183
Spectators are motivated by different aspects of a streaming or game watching experience.

109
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:37,045
So some are eventually more interested in the game itself, some are eventually interested in

110
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:45,547
the streamer or player or team, esports team, as a person or as a team, and others are interested

111
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:51,128
in the social experiences and want to interact with other spectators or the community.

112
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:56,497
So, in literature we can find different motives for spectating.

113
00:06:56,497 --> 00:07:03,670
Interestingly enough, there's not a lot of research yet on streaming or in eSports behavior.

114
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,051
It's...

115
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:06,978
growing and becoming more important.

116
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:09,100
But the most research we found,

117
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,323
and which is very similar to what we're interested in,

118
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:14,645
can be found in sports events.

119
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:18,048
So going to a football game, to a soccer game, for example,

120
00:07:18,048 --> 00:07:21,031
and understanding the spectator's motives there

121
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:23,393
can help us also understand the motives

122
00:07:23,393 --> 00:07:26,576
for people watching a stream or going to an e-sports mat.

123
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:30,891
So some of the motives can be, for example,

124
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:33,393
the identification, that a spectator really

125
00:07:33,393 --> 00:07:36,135
wants to be associated with a successful player

126
00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:39,977
and also wants to celebrate the success.

127
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:42,719
The aesthetics, this is really, really important.

128
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:46,122
They really enjoy the beauty of the game.

129
00:07:47,563 --> 00:07:54,725
we have drama and excitement. This is this idea that you experience this thrill, maybe stress,

130
00:07:54,725 --> 00:08:02,708
but a very pleasant form of stress while watching a game. Escape. Escape would be that you escape

131
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:09,751
from this daily routine and you come home from work and you just turn on a stream and watch the

132
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:12,051
stream just to getting relaxed again.

133
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:17,911
Knowledge. Eventually you're a gamer yourself and you want to learn more about the game.

134
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:25,256
You want to experience through the skills of the player and you want to learn the social interactions.

135
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:31,200
Especially on Twitch this is so important that you're able to communicate with other spectators.

136
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,103
This relation to some sort of a community, to some sort of a group.

137
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:36,785
And then the team or the player support.

138
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:40,307
That you're part of a community who is supporting a player.

139
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:45,382
Similar to player types, which all of you might know,

140
00:08:45,382 --> 00:08:47,765
there are also different types of spectators.

141
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:51,229
This is one simple model we built,

142
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:54,132
where you have the player and the game

143
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:56,355
as main interest points for spectators.

144
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:58,337
Could be also other spectators.

145
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,900
And some people really want to interact.

146
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,542
Some, however, want to consume.

147
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:06,984
So those, for example, who want to interact with other players

148
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:09,846
or with the players are socializers.

149
00:09:09,846 --> 00:09:13,048
Those who want to consume and learn from the skills

150
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:15,510
from a player, for example, can be learners.

151
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,472
Those who want to be part of the game,

152
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:22,095
make some sort of impact on the game, can be participators.

153
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,377
And those who are consuming the games,

154
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:26,198
they're just enjoying the beauty.

155
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:32,501
And based on that, in literature, we find nine different personas.

156
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:37,623
And what we all know, when we create games, it's always important to think about those

157
00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:40,864
different personas who we are designing the games for.

158
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:42,505
Same can be done for spectators.

159
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:49,192
So there's for example the bystander. The bystander is someone who is still not very

160
00:09:49,192 --> 00:09:55,200
interested in the game yet, who just happens to be there. This one is either uninformed about the

161
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,726
game or uninvested and not really engaged yet. However this can change.

162
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:06,591
If there's something happening which is engaging, for example some drama or some excitement,

163
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:14,518
this one can become to a curious one. The curious is suddenly interested in the game and then wants

164
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:20,763
to learn more about the game. It starts with a small fascination and they eventually start

165
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:26,749
watching and watching more and this one eventually becomes to the inspired. The inspired

166
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:30,027
feels like, oh, that's a cool game.

167
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:32,227
I also want to play this game.

168
00:10:32,227 --> 00:10:34,748
This one would eventually, after the stream,

169
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:38,289
go to Steam and buy the game him or herself.

170
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:42,090
This is already a very, very nice process

171
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,351
when he got too inspired.

172
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:49,274
And as soon as you already know about the game, you eventually become the pupil.

173
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:54,537
A pupil, this one wants to learn. This one wants to understand specific techniques,

174
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:58,559
tricks of the player, or wants to learn about specific maps within the game.

175
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:06,644
He's or she's very interested in learning details, so this one would ask questions,

176
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:11,006
would interact with the player, or would interact with other spectators.

177
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:15,482
And then there's the unsatisfied, AKA the grumpy one,

178
00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:19,423
who'd rather like to be playing him or herself,

179
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,504
which comes from a desire.

180
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:24,865
An example for that would be a dad playing with his son,

181
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:27,726
and the son wants to play and the dad has to watch,

182
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:29,186
but actually wants to play himself.

183
00:11:29,827 --> 00:11:36,417
Next, there's the entertained and the entertained would rather prefer watching over playing.

184
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:43,128
So, there's this difference that content is being watched for entertainment basically like a movie.

185
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:45,283
Then we have the assistant.

186
00:11:45,283 --> 00:11:49,804
The assistant wants to sort of impact the game progress.

187
00:11:49,804 --> 00:11:53,505
They want to help, they want to be some sort of advisor.

188
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,766
This one would be, for example,

189
00:11:55,766 --> 00:11:58,107
all the brothers sitting next to me

190
00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:00,227
and trying to help me through the levels.

191
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:02,408
But this could be also someone

192
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:04,909
who wants to tell me about things

193
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:06,689
which I don't want to know

194
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:08,530
because I want to explore the game myself.

195
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:11,784
Then there's the commentator.

196
00:12:11,784 --> 00:12:13,826
This is a very interesting one.

197
00:12:13,826 --> 00:12:17,749
This one is a spectator and a performer or entertainer

198
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:18,630
at the same time.

199
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,432
This one wants to entertain other spectators.

200
00:12:21,432 --> 00:12:24,194
This one would be constantly talking about the game,

201
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:27,457
giving comments, in the chat, in the Twitch chat,

202
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:30,099
also constantly talking about the game.

203
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:32,180
This can be some sort of a cameraman

204
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,341
telling a different perspective.

205
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,190
And last, the last one is a part of the crowd.

206
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,851
This one wants to be part of the community.

207
00:12:41,851 --> 00:12:44,032
If something insane is happening

208
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:48,233
and the crowd would go wild or in a stream,

209
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:51,494
the entire chat will be flooded.

210
00:12:51,494 --> 00:12:54,835
This is what the part of the crowd would enjoy.

211
00:12:56,676 --> 00:13:03,488
Yeah, so now that we've learned about these different types of personas, of spectators,

212
00:13:03,488 --> 00:13:06,854
how can we design to engage the spectators?

213
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,322
Well, first of all, our main goal as a game designer

214
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:13,363
would be to create a playable game.

215
00:13:13,363 --> 00:13:15,605
But speaking of spectators, we also

216
00:13:15,605 --> 00:13:17,966
want to create a watchable game.

217
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:21,388
So that means viewers need to be able to understand what's

218
00:13:21,388 --> 00:13:23,830
going on in the game, and they need

219
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,692
to be able to keep track of everything that is going on

220
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:28,213
in the game at any time.

221
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:30,334
And also, we want to retain those viewers.

222
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:33,876
That means we want them to come back to our stream

223
00:13:33,876 --> 00:13:35,317
or to our play session.

224
00:13:35,317 --> 00:13:36,818
And they should keep watching.

225
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,586
What we identified were those three phases of spectator engagement.

226
00:13:43,586 --> 00:13:50,212
First, we want to attract people to a game or to a stream, and we want to teach them about the game.

227
00:13:50,212 --> 00:13:54,276
So, what is the game about? How is the game played? What are the rules of the game?

228
00:13:55,367 --> 00:14:02,189
Next, we want to retain those viewers so that they come back and maybe tell others and watch again,

229
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:10,711
keep watching. And third, we want community involvement and engagement. So that means

230
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:14,873
we want people to interact with streamers and with each other.

231
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:20,257
And this is all to support the spectator's motives that we have heard before.

232
00:14:20,257 --> 00:14:24,281
So, for example, we can attract with the aesthetics of a game,

233
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:28,585
or with drama, or just with basic simplicity,

234
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:33,050
so that people know how the game works.

235
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:40,032
And we can use drama for retaining viewers, for example, and we can try to build up knowledge

236
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:46,815
so that people come back, learn something more. And then we have social interaction for involvement

237
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:53,737
and engagement. We can encourage people to teach others about the game and we can support this

238
00:14:53,737 --> 00:15:01,139
affiliation that viewers will be supporting a specific team, for example, or a special player

239
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:02,820
or a stream. So...

240
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,877
What happens when a viewer walks into a stream?

241
00:15:07,877 --> 00:15:11,259
First question that pops up is, what is happening here?

242
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:14,601
And as I said before, the optimum thing

243
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:19,484
would be that the game is just very easy to pick up.

244
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:23,106
And from the very first second, you actually

245
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:23,866
know what's going on.

246
00:15:23,866 --> 00:15:27,549
But we want to have viewers learn about the game

247
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:29,610
while watching the game or the stream.

248
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:39,076
So, our goal is first to design to attract viewers, and that should be seen in all the

249
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:45,020
different kind of areas of development of the game. Coming from game design, then graphics,

250
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,501
UI, all those features.

251
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:51,443
They should give spectators visual hints and experiences

252
00:15:51,443 --> 00:15:53,484
about all the actions that are currently

253
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:54,864
happening in the game.

254
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:57,685
People should know about the tactics and even emotions

255
00:15:57,685 --> 00:15:59,306
the players are going through.

256
00:15:59,306 --> 00:16:02,627
A good example for that is in League of Legends,

257
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:04,847
there is a color scheme indicating

258
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:06,608
what is happening at the time.

259
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:08,809
So you just jump into a stream, and then you

260
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,169
see a certain color, and you know, OK,

261
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,650
this is the current phase, or this is maybe

262
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,950
what's going on at the moment.

263
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:22,482
And people or viewers should understand the current situation of the game, for example, if the team is winning or losing.

264
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:26,719
Next, we want to design to teach viewers.

265
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:31,942
This is an example we did in one of our games at Rarebyte.

266
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:38,605
There's a difference between UI done for players

267
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:40,946
versus UI for spectators.

268
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:43,027
So for a player, it's maybe important

269
00:16:43,027 --> 00:16:45,728
to really focus on the player's character

270
00:16:45,728 --> 00:16:47,729
and see what's going on with the character

271
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:50,610
and around the character and give a lot of feedback there.

272
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,571
But for spectators,

273
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:57,304
Maybe they want an overview of all the players in multiplayer and they want to be able to

274
00:16:57,304 --> 00:17:00,090
compare player skills or player stats.

275
00:17:02,677 --> 00:17:09,101
One element which is very exciting here is one method called information asymmetry.

276
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:15,946
Here the idea is that the player and the spectator have different pieces of information.

277
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:22,490
A very obvious one as a streamer or as a player, I do know for example what strategy I'm planning at the moment.

278
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,613
This is just in my head, so obviously this is something I as a player know, but the spectator doesn't.

279
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,635
I as a streamer can now decide whether or not it makes my stream more interesting,

280
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:31,897
or whether or not it makes my stream more interesting.

281
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:36,098
to tell the spectators this piece of information

282
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:40,559
or to keep it for myself to keep the spectators

283
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,200
full of tension and excitement what's happening next.

284
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,500
So keep this element of surprise.

285
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,581
As a game designer, I can also add elements

286
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:50,921
to make this happen.

287
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:52,241
For example, what we just heard,

288
00:17:52,241 --> 00:17:56,042
to add specific UI elements or give specific overviews

289
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,843
which are just seen by a spectator.

290
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:01,704
So for example, I can see an entire map

291
00:18:01,704 --> 00:18:05,246
of all the different players competing to each other,

292
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:08,388
and I know what's going on, but the players do not.

293
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:11,169
So this is also helping me to get excited.

294
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:12,930
Or I know as a spectator,

295
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,591
there's a specific trap over there,

296
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:16,952
and the player is just running over there.

297
00:18:16,952 --> 00:18:19,793
And I, as a spectator, get very excited about that.

298
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,292
So why do viewers stay or come back to a game or stream?

299
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:28,013
Well, first, there's just this fierce competition

300
00:18:28,013 --> 00:18:29,493
that you know from sports.

301
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:33,035
People like to see competition and see teams or players

302
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:36,577
competing and basically playing against each other.

303
00:18:36,577 --> 00:18:38,818
And then there is drama, of course.

304
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,798
You never know who's going to win this game.

305
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:41,579
Is it this player?

306
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,299
Is it this team?

307
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:42,959
Is it another one?

308
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:55,468
And then there's this affiliation that we want to support, that viewers get engaged and will support their favorite streamer, performer, player or team.

309
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:59,411
What we want to do is, we want to design for drama.

310
00:18:59,411 --> 00:19:06,536
So we want to create an intense playthrough and intense matches to support that drama.

311
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:08,438
And if you think of esports, that's...

312
00:19:09,435 --> 00:19:16,463
Basically what is happening there is that players that are very similar in skill play

313
00:19:16,463 --> 00:19:17,183
against each other.

314
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:21,207
So there's a natural drama coming from that.

315
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:27,234
But if you have games that are played by just random players, this is different.

316
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:33,120
And maybe you have to think about integrating mechanics to rebalance different player skills.

317
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:38,021
There's this infamous example of rubber banding in Mario Kart,

318
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:41,281
where you can basically, if you fall behind, you can catch up

319
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:44,582
because you just get faster.

320
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:47,602
We even used that in a hoverboard racing game.

321
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:51,723
You just had to, like, move onto a trail

322
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,403
and then you were able to catch up

323
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:56,144
and there was just an intense race coming from that

324
00:19:56,144 --> 00:20:01,545
with completely different kind of players or skilled players.

325
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,824
Also, we want to design to create the unexpected.

326
00:20:06,824 --> 00:20:11,545
So a viewer comes to stream and should never know exactly

327
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:12,366
what will happen next.

328
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:16,367
And that's one of the reasons this viewer will probably

329
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:18,188
stay to find out.

330
00:20:18,188 --> 00:20:22,229
We can add random events or story twists to our games

331
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:24,790
to change this kind of balance within the game.

332
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:29,051
We can add surprise boxes, crates, or loot to do that.

333
00:20:29,591 --> 00:20:32,394
For example, this here is from We Are Screwed,

334
00:20:32,394 --> 00:20:34,135
a game we're currently working on.

335
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:37,619
We have procedural content generation

336
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:40,521
and random events in that game.

337
00:20:40,521 --> 00:20:42,483
And it's a space co-op game

338
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:44,365
where people take on different roles.

339
00:20:44,365 --> 00:20:47,468
And we use this, kind of, those random elements

340
00:20:47,468 --> 00:20:50,190
to force people to change roles all the time.

341
00:20:52,750 --> 00:21:00,817
Something which is also very interesting is how to make it happen that viewers can be part of the experience.

342
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:08,824
So there could be, for example, a passive mechanic to give streamers the option to involve

343
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:11,585
the spectators in the game.

344
00:21:11,585 --> 00:21:15,626
So for example, what I use in Darkest Dungeon,

345
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:17,747
there's this option that you have those different

346
00:21:17,747 --> 00:21:19,287
characters which you can play,

347
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:20,787
and I would always look at the stream

348
00:21:20,787 --> 00:21:22,208
and look who's most active,

349
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,249
and then I would name the in-game characters

350
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:28,170
based on my spectators, based on my viewers.

351
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,790
So this is, they're basically getting involved

352
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,291
in a very passive way, but I as a player,

353
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,352
I have the mechanic to involve them.

354
00:21:37,352 --> 00:21:38,133
On the other hand.

355
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,423
being as a spectator active in a game experience can be also very engaging.

356
00:21:45,423 --> 00:21:53,206
This would mean that spectators can vote for specific things happening in the game,

357
00:21:53,206 --> 00:21:57,888
or now it becomes increasingly interesting to also make mechanics that you can for example

358
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:03,531
cheer for specific players within a game, and then they get a specific boost in the game as a game

359
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,012
mechanic or a specific item.

360
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,575
In the end, it's about building a community around the game

361
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:12,657
and making it accessible to all those viewers,

362
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:15,019
all those different kind of spectator personas.

363
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:18,302
The audience should feel welcome at all times,

364
00:22:18,302 --> 00:22:21,565
while players should still feel safe.

365
00:22:21,565 --> 00:22:25,067
And the goal is to let viewers be a part of something.

366
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:36,966
Next, we want to go, or quickly go through some strategies we used on our projects. So first...

367
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:41,427
So there's so many evaluation strategies.

368
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:44,130
I mean, coming from a UX background,

369
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,493
there are so many ways how you can think

370
00:22:46,493 --> 00:22:48,935
of evaluating the player experience,

371
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:50,957
and all those can be also used, basically,

372
00:22:50,957 --> 00:22:52,979
to evaluate the spectator's experience.

373
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:55,001
Those can be things like observations,

374
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:58,124
think-out-loud tests, working with data,

375
00:22:58,124 --> 00:23:01,107
in-game data, in-game metrics, interviews, you name it.

376
00:23:01,628 --> 00:23:07,696
But we want to introduce two specific models which we used in our collaboration basically.

377
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:11,802
And the first one is the in this point of view.

378
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:13,889
Yeah, let's start with the indie point of view.

379
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:16,111
And of course, this is called the party test.

380
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:18,534
And it looks exactly like in this picture here.

381
00:23:18,534 --> 00:23:22,298
This works in a way, and this is very simple.

382
00:23:22,298 --> 00:23:25,180
We would just invite 15 to 20 people to our office

383
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,544
and do something called a play party.

384
00:23:28,544 --> 00:23:31,587
And we would just start a game

385
00:23:31,587 --> 00:23:33,709
and then have some people play this game.

386
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,332
and other people watch those people play.

387
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:41,516
And then we evaluate and we record that

388
00:23:41,516 --> 00:23:44,259
and we collect data basically.

389
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:47,161
And we can identify issues like with onboarding,

390
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:49,704
with usability and playability.

391
00:23:49,704 --> 00:23:52,086
And this is both for player

392
00:23:52,086 --> 00:23:54,608
and spectator engagement and experience.

393
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:59,015
And my point, the academics point of view,

394
00:23:59,015 --> 00:24:01,376
I love, again, I love working with data.

395
00:24:01,376 --> 00:24:03,837
And I do a lot of big data analysis,

396
00:24:03,837 --> 00:24:06,177
so I really try to gather a lot of data,

397
00:24:06,177 --> 00:24:11,199
either qualitative or quantitative data.

398
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:14,300
But what's very interesting is, for example,

399
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,622
to build different models based on the interactions

400
00:24:18,622 --> 00:24:22,063
of spectators with the game, or with the stream,

401
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:25,004
with the player, or with other spectators.

402
00:24:25,704 --> 00:24:29,665
This can be usually, can be data locked in the game,

403
00:24:29,665 --> 00:24:32,606
can be locked in the stream, can be Twitch data,

404
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:33,987
or can be even Twitter data,

405
00:24:33,987 --> 00:24:35,587
which is just related to the game.

406
00:24:35,587 --> 00:24:39,869
I want to introduce you to models which we use,

407
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:41,969
or two processes we often use.

408
00:24:41,969 --> 00:24:45,270
The first one is graph-based analysis.

409
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:48,812
Here we built, based on the interaction of the spectators

410
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:51,993
with each other or with the player, we built a graph.

411
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:54,533
This means if as soon as two.

412
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:59,936
spectators would interact in a chat at a very similar time. We assume this might be some sort

413
00:24:59,936 --> 00:25:05,758
of communication, so we would make a connection between two nodes within this graph, which means

414
00:25:05,758 --> 00:25:12,161
okay they're connected, they have some sort of relationship within this graph, and we can make

415
00:25:12,161 --> 00:25:13,661
sense out of this data.

416
00:25:14,102 --> 00:25:19,285
So, looking at a lot of data, this could be a graph, this is how such a graph looks like.

417
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:26,390
And what we can see, there are some nodes with a lot of connections. Those nodes could be very

418
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:33,694
relevant and important points to look at. Those can be, for example, those personas of commentators

419
00:25:33,694 --> 00:25:37,036
who want to entertain the others and are really important.

420
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,738
as an engagement starting point.

421
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:44,341
So, can we use this information to give those a specific reward, for example,

422
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:50,864
to make sure to keep them engaged and keep them in our stream or part of our game experience?

423
00:25:50,864 --> 00:25:56,707
And then we can also identify the weaker points, those with not a lot of connections.

424
00:25:56,707 --> 00:26:02,791
And we can think of ways how to integrate those and help them to connect to other spectators.

425
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:08,517
On the other hand, this is one of the more traditional ways to do data analysis.

426
00:26:08,517 --> 00:26:14,318
This is basically where you look at the number of interactions over time.

427
00:26:14,318 --> 00:26:20,760
So this is when you look at the Twitch chat, for example, you can see in minute 40,

428
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,760
there was something going on, something very important was going on.

429
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:30,042
And we can find out by looking at the in-game data, here was a specific boss fight.

430
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:32,202
Apparently also the streamer did something very well.

431
00:26:32,622 --> 00:26:37,085
Can we use this information to make the engagement even better for the next stream?

432
00:26:37,085 --> 00:26:46,512
So just to summarize, we can also say that those different relations strategies can actually work

433
00:26:46,512 --> 00:26:51,936
together. Again, so that I can do my data analysis, I need a lot of data.

434
00:26:52,516 --> 00:27:01,082
The point is that very, very often when we work with studios, it's becoming very expensive and

435
00:27:01,082 --> 00:27:07,907
it's becoming very complicated because the data the studio locked in the game just was not right,

436
00:27:07,907 --> 00:27:11,650
was not locked in a correct way or just not locked at all.

437
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:19,675
Yeah, and the idea is just to work together from the very beginning of the project and do a data definition together.

438
00:27:19,675 --> 00:27:28,661
And then we as a studio would take this definition and build it right into the very foundation of the game.

439
00:27:28,661 --> 00:27:31,183
And we then plan and prototype our game.

440
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:35,626
And when a build is ready of the game, we would start a play testing session.

441
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:41,870
And then we would be able to collect data that is then given back to the research institution.

442
00:27:42,442 --> 00:27:45,824
And since the data already fits what we sort of need,

443
00:27:45,824 --> 00:27:48,066
because of this definition phase,

444
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,949
for us it's so much easier and much more cost-effective

445
00:27:50,949 --> 00:27:54,332
to make sense out of the data and help the studio,

446
00:27:54,332 --> 00:27:57,534
even if it's a small studio or a big studio,

447
00:27:57,534 --> 00:27:58,915
to help to improve the game.

448
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:04,751
All right, a short recap of what we talked about today.

449
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:08,353
Keep in mind, not every spectator has the same motives.

450
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:12,196
There are different motives for viewing a stream or a game.

451
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:15,718
Then also keep in mind that you need to design

452
00:28:15,718 --> 00:28:18,560
for different spectator personas.

453
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,142
And also, as we just said, seize the opportunity

454
00:28:22,142 --> 00:28:24,924
of collaborations between your indie studio

455
00:28:24,924 --> 00:28:27,926
or your game studio and research institutions.

456
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:30,248
All right, that's it.

457
00:28:30,248 --> 00:28:31,349
Thank you very much.

458
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:32,369
If you have any questions.

459
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:32,769
Thank you so much.

460
00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:33,550
Thank you.

461
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:33,950
Thank you.

462
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,310
Thank you.

463
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,491
Thank you.

464
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:36,131
Thank you.

465
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:40,574
I think we have time for one or two questions.

466
00:28:40,574 --> 00:28:43,215
Afterwards we will be in the wrap-up area.

467
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:51,635
Hi, I was wondering if to combat the problem you're having with data sources like that

468
00:28:51,635 --> 00:28:56,399
being locked down by different studios, are there any emerging standards that are being

469
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,981
adopted across the Indy platforms?

470
00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:02,163
Yeah, that's a very good point actually.

471
00:29:02,163 --> 00:29:04,606
So that's one of the issues we're having right now.

472
00:29:04,606 --> 00:29:07,009
We are actually trying to build one of such standards

473
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:08,931
at the moment because yeah,

474
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:12,615
it is actually pretty easy and straightforward,

475
00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:16,560
but yeah, there's exactly a lack of things like that.

476
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,762
So thanks for pointing that out also.

477
00:29:20,215 --> 00:29:32,604
Hi. So have you found that designing a game with this, making it spectator approved or

478
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:44,553
liked that streamers will like quickly recognize that the game is made for that and will adopt

479
00:29:44,553 --> 00:29:45,053
it?

480
00:29:46,588 --> 00:29:58,459
Yeah, so the idea would be to build features into the game that would just enable streamers to use that to engage more with their audience, for example.

481
00:29:58,459 --> 00:29:59,160
Of course. Yeah.

482
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,500
Thank you.

483
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,745
Okay, so thank you so much and have a lovely evening.
