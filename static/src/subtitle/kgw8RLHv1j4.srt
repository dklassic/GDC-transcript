1
00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:12,155
Hello, are you all exhausted? No? Okay. Then it's your job to

2
00:00:12,175 --> 00:00:17,779
keep me awake because, oh boy, I'm exhausted. I'm also somewhat

3
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:22,602
losing my voice. So I need you to be the loud ones this time.

4
00:00:24,743 --> 00:00:29,987
Well, you know, how many of you have been to my talks before? A

5
00:00:31,688 --> 00:00:32,108
few of you.

6
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:37,240
I'm known for giving these incredibly dense brain blast

7
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,344
talks with 150 slides and tons of references and facts and

8
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:46,909
whatever. This is not that talk. Not only because I'm losing my

9
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:52,273
voice, but just because this topic, I agonized over how to

10
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:55,096
give this talk, to be honest. I've rewritten it more than

11
00:00:55,196 --> 00:00:59,059
almost any talk I've ever given. And guys, I've been doing this a

12
00:00:59,099 --> 00:00:59,520
long time.

13
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:04,396
It's something that I feel really deeply and passionately

14
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:08,399
about and it's something that I take very, very seriously. This

15
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:11,522
is co-listed with the advocacy track and not just the design

16
00:01:11,562 --> 00:01:16,826
track. And it's for a reason. The other thing about this talk

17
00:01:16,886 --> 00:01:22,912
though is it isn't entirely going to be about games. Right?

18
00:01:24,237 --> 00:01:26,458
Social is in the title of this talk.

19
00:01:26,898 --> 00:01:29,360
And as soon as we're dealing with people,

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,581
we aren't necessarily entirely in the realm

21
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:32,602
of just entertaining.

22
00:01:34,463 --> 00:01:37,005
So, here's the thing.

23
00:01:37,645 --> 00:01:38,846
I'm just gonna say it bluntly.

24
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,027
Social spaces aren't just games.

25
00:01:42,308 --> 00:01:43,348
Like from the get-go.

26
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:45,810
There are a few of you with whom I remember

27
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,211
sitting and having discussions.

28
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:48,672
You're here in the room, it's so good to see you.

29
00:01:50,673 --> 00:01:52,854
Literally now, gosh.

30
00:01:54,001 --> 00:02:00,006
almost 20 years ago having arguments about whether or not we were even making games when we

31
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:06,372
were making the early virtual worlds and the MMOs. You know, when I was making Ultima Online, I

32
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,375
would have arguments with people like Eric Zimmerman about this.

33
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:15,793
I told them bluntly, I'm not sure that's what I do. I'm not sure I make games. I think I design

34
00:02:16,074 --> 00:02:23,917
places and worlds and societies and not just games. They just happen to have a lot of games in

35
00:02:24,057 --> 00:02:29,720
them. Things that you can stumble across and play. But really, a huge amount of the work was

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,762
going into simulating things like tailoring and rabbit hunting and running a shop. Not

37
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:39,084
necessarily what we think of as games. I used to say I was making worlds.

38
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:45,996
virtual worlds. And I really do believe that when you start

39
00:02:46,076 --> 00:02:50,557
working in the arena of online social spaces, that's what

40
00:02:50,577 --> 00:02:53,278
you're doing. Even though those days are long gone and you know,

41
00:02:53,518 --> 00:02:56,678
MMOs are not the new hotness anymore. They have not been in

42
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:01,760
quite a while. But if you are making a social VR space, a

43
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,900
social AR space, a lot of people are trying to do, you aren't

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,761
just making a game, you're designing a society.

45
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:14,735
When you choose to take up those tools, connectivity,

46
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:19,699
persistence, identity, you are going to design that society

47
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,641
either on purpose or by accident.

48
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:27,005
And sorry to say, I'm seeing a lot of people

49
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:29,006
doing it by accident.

50
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:34,010
So I'm here to try to persuade you to do it on purpose.

51
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:40,955
We'll start with the obvious thing. This should be a

52
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:44,476
terrifying responsibility. The problem is we're all blinded by

53
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:49,718
snow crash. There's still people out there. I know we have some

54
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:52,318
folks from Oculus in the audience. There are people in

55
00:03:52,338 --> 00:03:57,159
leadership at Oculus saying yes, I dream of building snow crash.

56
00:03:57,179 --> 00:03:58,360
No, snow crash is bullshit.

57
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:01,943
It's not where we are really headed.

58
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:06,525
And it's a great book and a really compelling vision, but

59
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:08,987
we need to be aware of what we're actually working with.

60
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,828
The very first time I met Bruce Sterling, a different

61
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:14,830
cyberpunk science fiction writer, I had already been

62
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,171
working in online worlds.

63
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:18,472
I asked him point blank, how did you get virtual reality?

64
00:04:18,532 --> 00:04:19,252
So wrong.

65
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:21,153
Wasn't really a fair question.

66
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:25,595
I want to tell you an anecdote that happened while speaking

67
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:30,779
with an extremely powerful and famous executive at a very

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,043
large blue company whose last name starts with Z and ends

69
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:39,346
with Uckerberg. I was interviewing for a job there.

70
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:45,611
And I had talked with people all day long and last

71
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:46,472
interviews with him. And

72
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:50,843
He says to me, well, I've heard good things

73
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:53,385
from everybody all day, and everybody's been asking

74
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:54,846
you questions for eight solid hours,

75
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:57,288
so what questions do you have for me?

76
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,953
And I said, well, I'd like to know your opinion.

77
00:05:03,373 --> 00:05:08,037
What do you think are the social and ethical implications

78
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:14,022
of social virtual reality and connected augmented reality?

79
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:17,485
This was his answer.

80
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:30,085
I may have ranted at him for a little while and then not gotten the job. But I also would

81
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:35,008
not have taken it at that point. And probably will never work for them again now that I've

82
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:43,312
said that. But that's okay. Let's get real for a minute. We are talking about companies

83
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:48,415
that are trying to create world spanning social VR and AR structures and haven't done basic

84
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:53,118
work on what online communities are. I often say I'm not entirely sure Facebook understands

85
00:05:54,258 --> 00:06:00,622
right? Adding you willy nilly to groups. Is anybody a fan of that one? Features like that.

86
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:08,406
So the idea that people are out there building constructs like this without doing some basic

87
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:12,929
lesson learning is a little bit terrifying to me given the way that society has developed and

88
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:17,351
the amount of power that has ended up in the hands of large internet companies. And it should

89
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:18,712
be a little bit terrifying to you too.

90
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:25,772
So I promised some lessons. How many of you here are actually working on building social

91
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:34,056
virtual reality experiences? Awesome. How about, how many people are working on like trying to

92
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:41,740
cash in on Pokemon Go and build social AR experiences? A few. Okay, good. So let's get

93
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,583
real and look at some specific lessons here before I go all lofty on you.

94
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:51,049
is, I'm going to call out actually a particular company, but I think their response to this

95
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:56,573
incident was actually really good. So I want to preface that. Do all of you recall the case of

96
00:06:56,593 --> 00:07:06,100
the virtual groping in quiver, quiver, VR, whichever? Okay. Good. So a woman logged into this

97
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,903
game, which apparently is about doing VR archery, and a stranger named, I think it was

98
00:07:10,943 --> 00:07:15,287
big bro some number, walked up and started virtually groping her.

99
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:21,479
response of the company, they were not logged on at the time.

100
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,868
They did not know about the incident until an article was

101
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:25,129
written.

102
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:31,147
when they found out, to their credit, they immediately put in a bunch of features so that

103
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:37,351
gropers, bodies could not see one another anymore when they came into close proximity. They

104
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:43,414
expanded what they called the personal bubble. And they added a new gesture that they would

105
00:07:43,454 --> 00:07:48,618
like to add to the vocabulary of social VR. One where you can do and create like this

106
00:07:49,138 --> 00:07:54,681
exploding blue force field that turns the harasser invisible and prevents them from

107
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:55,442
interacting with you.

108
00:07:56,533 --> 00:08:01,276
And they were very up front, immediately posted a post mortem

109
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:04,018
about what had happened and encouraged everybody,

110
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,720
hey, we need to take this stuff seriously.

111
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,142
And major props to them.

112
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:10,904
But let's be straight about what should have happened.

113
00:08:12,185 --> 00:08:13,886
What should have happened is that the people

114
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,648
who were logged on 24-7 monitoring behavior

115
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:19,190
were called by a harassment call,

116
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,931
appeared with the wrath of God,

117
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,093
turned the asshole into a toad and banned him for life.

118
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:26,545
Right?

119
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:32,346
This is actually best practice in online community spaces.

120
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:38,388
Now, I understand that we have a lot of small companies

121
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:41,529
that don't have the resources to maintain

122
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,009
customer support on call 24-7,

123
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:47,850
that don't have all of the tools and the background

124
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,771
and the technology to be able to do this.

125
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:53,412
And I don't care.

126
00:08:56,305 --> 00:09:02,488
Because if you host an online community where people can cause harm to another person, you are on the hook.

127
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:07,650
And if you can't afford to be on the hook, don't host an online community.

128
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:13,112
I wish there were a different answer. I don't think there is.

129
00:09:15,193 --> 00:09:19,534
Now, you're the government of that space. You're hosting real people.

130
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:21,755
You should want to be doing this.

131
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:24,256
You should understand the idea that...

132
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:26,747
You may not quite know how.

133
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:28,688
That's fine.

134
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:30,510
Let's talk about ways you can do it.

135
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:33,972
The first thing people need to understand is that you

136
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:37,315
actually need to build all of your moderation structure, all

137
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:39,917
of this, on a due process.

138
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,119
You actually need to institute a rule of law.

139
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:46,342
That means starting from the very beginning, actually having

140
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:49,543
such a code of law, a code of conduct. You need some kind of

141
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:53,305
code of conduct, end user license agreement, terms of

142
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:56,026
service written in plain English that every player

143
00:09:56,106 --> 00:09:59,027
affirmatively signs up to the first time they log in and they

144
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:03,129
swear an oath, I will abide by this. And it needs to be posted

145
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:06,030
everywhere and you need to be reinforcing this as a cultural

146
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,331
thing. Every day. Right?

147
00:10:09,928 --> 00:10:11,910
This is kind of what we do in the real world.

148
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,312
And we're not even entirely satisfied

149
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:16,294
with how well it works here, right?

150
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:18,596
But you don't get to abdicate doing it.

151
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:21,760
It has enormous benefits,

152
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:24,462
just not only as a cultural thing,

153
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:26,724
but also for clearing up edge cases.

154
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:27,745
Because you're going to be fighting

155
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:30,628
an awful lot of edge cases.

156
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:38,747
The most concrete practical thing is a tool that has been in use for, oh gosh, I went

157
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:44,791
asking and the earliest virtual world I could find that was doing it were games on America

158
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:46,032
online and genie.

159
00:10:47,673 --> 00:10:52,097
Anybody who here doesn't know what those are because they're too old.

160
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:55,319
And that's a concept called the circular buffer.

161
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,882
And this is a very simple thing that if you weren't using voice chat you could all go

162
00:10:59,902 --> 00:11:00,743
and implement right now.

163
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:07,128
unfortunately using voice chat so you're screwed. But simply

164
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,471
recording, keeping track of the last minute to five minutes of

165
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,955
every single interaction each client sees and storing it.

166
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:19,138
Discarding the stuff that's five minutes old and always entering

167
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:21,741
the most recent stuff so that when something like this

168
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,903
happens and no admin is online.

169
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:30,379
When they hit the report button, it is attached as impartial

170
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,960
evidence that can be adjudicated.

171
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:36,463
The Quiver story, how do you pronounce that anyway?

172
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:37,644
Quiver, quiver, anyway.

173
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:41,526
That story, I absolutely believe the woman.

174
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:44,568
I absolutely believe that story happened.

175
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:46,209
There's corroboration and all the rest.

176
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,391
At the same time, believe me, you will have cases where it

177
00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:50,232
will turn into.

178
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,502
One says, the other says. If you don't have tools like this, you are literally going to spend your

179
00:11:56,542 --> 00:12:03,245
entire monthly profit on the first call. Standing there mediating between two people who are

180
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:11,048
yelling at one another. It is actually cheaper to ban every single user who calls for help. I

181
00:12:11,088 --> 00:12:16,449
know, this sounds horrendous. Banning every person who calls for help is cheaper.

182
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:25,657
than helping them, right? Because they cost so much money to support. So you need to have

183
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:31,138
incontrovertible evidence. I have no idea how small shops are going to do this with voice

184
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:36,540
logs. Worse, I think you need to do more than just voice logs. I think you need to record

185
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:43,002
every single gesture so that when somebody does this, the CS person can replay it back and

186
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:44,542
verify who started the fight.

187
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:57,396
It's not going to be cheap. But you need to do it. The gesture was a great touch, but banning

188
00:12:57,436 --> 00:13:04,061
wasn't mentioned in the article. A key lesson from all kinds of social spaces and virtual

189
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:10,427
worlds is that offenders repeat. The number one player killer in Ultima Online was

190
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:13,349
personally responsible for murdering over 4,000 people.

191
00:13:16,723 --> 00:13:22,706
The people who engage in this behavior do it over and over again. And if your social VR or AR

192
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:28,108
system does not have a persistent account system with persistent identity that players invest

193
00:13:28,168 --> 00:13:34,431
into, you're effectively making every player get away scott free. Because all they need to do is

194
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:36,752
create a brand new account every single time they log in.

195
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:48,287
Actions like this matter more in VR, precisely because VR embodies us and makes us feel like

196
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:55,932
we're really there. Okay? There's a lot of talk about, oh, well, we'll just block, we'll just

197
00:13:55,992 --> 00:14:02,156
mute, we'll do a personal bubble. It's wholly inadequate. Okay? Let's take a simple thought

198
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:08,119
experiment. One avatar interpenetrates another avatar in some way that somebody finds

199
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,821
uncomfortable. They, you know, they, you know, they, you know, they, you know, they, you know,

200
00:14:11,854 --> 00:14:17,597
do something nasty and start dry humping the other avatar. Great. So the personal bubble kicks

201
00:14:17,697 --> 00:14:23,619
in and the other avatar can't be seen. In theory that person is now okay, right? It's the same

202
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:29,302
logic as well, I'll just block them on Twitter and everything will be fine. What about the

203
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:36,265
third party who is still watching? You're going to be still just as angry about this incident

204
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:40,307
when you get told about it by the third party, right?

205
00:14:41,703 --> 00:14:45,264
Block and mute have never been adequate enough tools for

206
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:48,744
managing these sorts of problems in online settings.

207
00:14:50,285 --> 00:14:52,825
How many of you have read the original rape in cyberspace

208
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:57,506
article? I should ask that more precisely. How many of you

209
00:14:57,586 --> 00:15:01,507
working in social VR and AR have read, have not read the

210
00:15:01,547 --> 00:15:06,828
original cyberspace article? Okay. Homework item number one.

211
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:14,717
This was an article that came out in the village voice in 1993 regarding the first major

212
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:21,261
documented case, because I'm positive there were many, many more. Instance of one avatar

213
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:28,965
raping another one. And actually he raped two in public in the living room in the main house at

214
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:36,770
the main entrance of the entire virtual space. With a knife. As in raped with a knife.

215
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:39,674
But here's the interesting thing.

216
00:15:40,755 --> 00:15:43,257
He didn't even do it to their actual bodies.

217
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,459
He did it using this technological tool

218
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,921
that was available in this game called a puppet.

219
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:52,223
And the puppet, all it did, this was a text world,

220
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:54,185
all it did was make it look like

221
00:15:54,265 --> 00:15:55,786
somebody else was doing something.

222
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:58,588
The victims were actually just standing there.

223
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:02,391
And they could mute and block him all they wanted.

224
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:10,213
but it didn't matter because it looked to everyone else in the room like Mr. Bungle was getting

225
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:18,557
these two poor people to do horrendous things to themselves. In 1993, this became a bit of a

226
00:16:18,597 --> 00:16:24,821
cause celebre because people started arguing about whether or not that was really rape. I

227
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:32,045
mean, it's online. That can't be real, can it? We know better now, I hope. Although...

228
00:16:33,298 --> 00:16:35,980
have to see, I think there's plenty of Twitter trolls who

229
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,986
probably still think, what's the big deal? Right? But I'm pretty

230
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:45,390
sure that right now somebody is going, you know, it will be

231
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,553
awfully cool to do user generated content in social VR

232
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:51,556
and somebody is probably inventing the VR version of that

233
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:54,179
puppet right now. Right?

234
00:16:56,698 --> 00:17:02,801
another fellow virtual world guy going way back has this absolutely wonderful phrase, TTP. We

235
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:08,763
use it as an index with which to measure the success of virtual worlds social design. It

236
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:19,448
stands for time to penis. How long until you find the UGC penis that some player has

237
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:20,508
managed to stick in your game?

238
00:17:22,605 --> 00:17:30,706
Ultima Online, the first one I saw was drawn by dropping fish on the road. It happened on the

239
00:17:30,746 --> 00:17:37,187
first day. And of course the most famous incident, I encourage you, go look up the video on

240
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:45,149
YouTube. It's astonishing in a surreal kind of way. This poor woman, Angie Chung, was

241
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:49,830
literally attacked by a flying swarm of thousands of penises that swirled around her in a

242
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,310
tornado.

243
00:17:52,194 --> 00:18:01,636
So that isn't entirely on the troll, right? If you run that world, that's on you. It's on you.

244
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:10,818
Every feature you make should be looked at first as a weapon. And it's a dark way to look at

245
00:18:10,878 --> 00:18:18,000
humanity, I know. I've grown so cynical. How will a player abuse someone else with this?

246
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:21,845
Odds are excellent that you aren't actually evil enough

247
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:23,326
when you playtest.

248
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:25,827
Otherwise, something like groping somebody,

249
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:28,607
God, that would have come up in the first 15 seconds, right?

250
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:32,008
You know, it's almost an obvious scenario.

251
00:18:32,808 --> 00:18:35,169
I mean, what could they do with the actual bows and arrows?

252
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:37,190
We haven't even gotten to that part.

253
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,871
It wasn't long ago that we saw an experienced triple A team

254
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:45,332
miss one of these kind of basic things.

255
00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:46,452
How many of you played The Division?

256
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:51,404
Right. So here's this MMO shooter on the console with a

257
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:56,647
triple A team and they made all the players collide with all the

258
00:18:56,707 --> 00:18:59,929
other players. And then they had a single quest giver sitting in

259
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:04,951
the central lobby. So there were lines running out the door and

260
00:19:05,031 --> 00:19:07,353
people would barricade the door to prevent other people from

261
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:08,413
getting quests. Right?

262
00:19:10,673 --> 00:19:14,997
My personal experience with making that mistake was in the

263
00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:21,041
alpha for Ultima Online sometime around February to May

264
00:19:21,101 --> 00:19:25,024
of 1996, where we allowed people to spawn in the inn.

265
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:26,725
And then they would walk outside.

266
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:29,227
And they were collidable, of course.

267
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,849
And people would gladly let them out the door.

268
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:34,891
But then they would sand in the door and not let anyone

269
00:19:35,031 --> 00:19:38,133
in, and in the pursuit of realism, we had made it so you

270
00:19:38,153 --> 00:19:40,255
could shoot arrows through the windows.

271
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:47,190
of the inn. So they would let you out and rush to the windows and shoot you in the back as you

272
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:52,292
walked away. And of course you couldn't get back in to defend yourself. You couldn't see who was

273
00:19:52,332 --> 00:19:57,254
in the building. We basically proved all of the fundamental premises of medieval defensive

274
00:19:57,314 --> 00:20:07,178
architecture. That was 1996 and a game in 2016 can still make the same mistake because we're

275
00:20:07,218 --> 00:20:09,198
not necessarily very good about sharing the history.

276
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:13,211
Or reading it, rather, because the stories have been told.

277
00:20:14,594 --> 00:20:15,416
We laugh about them.

278
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:19,545
They're fun, until you're pincushioned with 100 arrows

279
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:19,885
in your back.

280
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,842
This brings us to another issue. Those of you who are building social VR, you are here

281
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:32,864
listening to this talk. Excellent. You are good people. You are not going to do these

282
00:20:32,944 --> 00:20:38,707
things. But if you are successful, the people you hire will hire other people who will in

283
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:40,688
fact do things like consider it a perk.

284
00:20:41,248 --> 00:20:47,273
to go over to people's private chat spaces and watch them as they engage in, you know, very

285
00:20:47,353 --> 00:20:55,080
private things. The very first guy that I banned and fired as an admin on a text mod was

286
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,665
somebody who thought it was the perk of a God to be able to spy on same sex couples who were

287
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:07,872
having cyber sex in their private rooms. You have to hard code in the same sex couples

288
00:21:08,673 --> 00:21:15,740
limitations into the architecture of your world. Permission bits, absolute logging of every kind

289
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,766
of extra normal command, the ability to grant or revoke any kind of capability granularly per

290
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:26,851
individual and only grant the powers that are specific to the scope of that individual's job.

291
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:33,850
And you have to do this because in the early days of MMOs we had

292
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,472
issues where game masters in Ultima Online were having hot

293
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:41,054
tub parties with players and trading sexual favors for in

294
00:21:41,094 --> 00:21:47,037
game items. They needed the ability to spawn those items for

295
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:50,159
their job. Unfortunately we didn't have logging in the hot

296
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:54,141
tubs. Probably fortunately actually. So it was hard to

297
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:56,022
prove that these situations were happening.

298
00:21:57,092 --> 00:22:03,076
thing is odds are near certainty. If your virtual world is successful, your digital objects

299
00:22:03,116 --> 00:22:08,941
are going to have real money value. There's no escaping it at this point. It is absolutely

300
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:15,286
hopeless to try. Just assume that anything you create as a digital object has real world

301
00:22:15,346 --> 00:22:22,251
value and people will be doing things like sleeping for it, paying for it and stealing it.

302
00:22:24,382 --> 00:22:27,722
Just go in the door assuming that that is part of this field.

303
00:22:33,764 --> 00:22:38,745
Fundamentally, you should not be opening a virtual world

304
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:40,806
unless you think in terms of this kind

305
00:22:40,846 --> 00:22:41,926
of legal infrastructure.

306
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:45,067
The easiest way to think of this is you are the gods

307
00:22:45,107 --> 00:22:47,547
of this space, but you're the government of this space.

308
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:52,831
We have drifted away over time from having in-game admins

309
00:22:52,911 --> 00:22:56,353
have even visible avatars in the space.

310
00:22:57,053 --> 00:23:00,175
And the reason is in order to minimize the possibility

311
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:02,857
of personal relationships forming between customer service

312
00:23:02,897 --> 00:23:03,798
and individual players.

313
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:07,800
I miss the days when you could hang out with the players

314
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,901
and you were the God and they weren't and all of it

315
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,562
and you could hang out and do things for them.

316
00:23:12,203 --> 00:23:14,844
But the reason why we've gone and anonymized everybody

317
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:16,365
is because corruption happens.

318
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:27,084
You also need to be aware, and this is also just a home truth,

319
00:23:28,665 --> 00:23:35,210
the people who use virtual spaces are very often using them for therapeutic purposes.

320
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:43,055
That means a higher incidence of individuals inside your space who are dealing with psychological

321
00:23:43,095 --> 00:23:47,418
stress of various sorts. It's just how the numbers work out.

322
00:23:48,453 --> 00:23:54,257
You just need to be aware of it. There is not a single large scale commercial virtual world

323
00:23:54,297 --> 00:24:02,403
that does not have the FBI and suicide hotlines on speed dial. The number of runaways that we

324
00:24:02,463 --> 00:24:10,750
tracked down for the FBI and the police while at Sony online was easily in the triple digits.

325
00:24:14,112 --> 00:24:15,533
And I would add to this, by the way,

326
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:19,470
Be prepared to deal with manifestations of mental illness.

327
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,752
Those folks will frequently be calling for assistance

328
00:24:22,952 --> 00:24:24,173
within this virtual setting.

329
00:24:25,534 --> 00:24:29,456
And you have gone and built their home away from home,

330
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:30,817
the place that they use to cope,

331
00:24:32,198 --> 00:24:35,380
the place that they are using as their support system.

332
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,202
Often the friends that they've made in your space

333
00:24:38,962 --> 00:24:42,144
are the ones that literally keep them alive.

334
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:44,626
You are holding

335
00:24:45,237 --> 00:24:46,658
their lives in your hands.

336
00:24:47,658 --> 00:24:48,998
So you have to take it seriously.

337
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,519
You shape this society in really fundamental ways.

338
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,139
Have I scared the shit out of you yet?

339
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,940
I hope so, right?

340
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,900
I hope so.

341
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,681
Don't worry, it won't all be a downer.

342
00:25:02,741 --> 00:25:03,281
I promise.

343
00:25:03,441 --> 00:25:07,862
But the flip side of this power

344
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,843
is that you can shape this environment

345
00:25:11,903 --> 00:25:13,623
in ways that are amazing.

346
00:25:14,532 --> 00:25:17,053
The original Mudd, Richard Bartle actually designed it

347
00:25:17,214 --> 00:25:19,094
as a blow against the British class system.

348
00:25:19,595 --> 00:25:22,036
That is why you can level up and be anyone and anything.

349
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:24,777
Because he felt like he'd grown up

350
00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:26,478
in a very restrictive world where,

351
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,779
oh no, you have the wrong accent.

352
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:31,521
You'll never get a doctorate, right?

353
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:34,282
That's amazing, that's super cool.

354
00:25:34,502 --> 00:25:37,724
And in fact, a lot of the earliest virtual spaces

355
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,805
were safe spaces for

356
00:25:42,717 --> 00:25:46,057
safe spaces for queers, safe spaces for the asexuals, safe

357
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:49,898
spaces for people who prefer the idea of having hundreds of

358
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:55,319
little tentacles for genitalia. They were all colors and shapes

359
00:25:55,399 --> 00:26:01,061
and sizes and ages. All of those ideas. One of the huge, huge

360
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:04,541
mistakes of social VR is that they're forgetting that the

361
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:08,542
promise is be someone you aren't. Right?

362
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:14,350
That has always been a fundamental premise of engaging in a virtual world.

363
00:26:16,232 --> 00:26:23,258
Even in the normative modern MMO worlds, cross-gender roleplay is still incredibly common, right?

364
00:26:23,338 --> 00:26:23,939
We all know this.

365
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,263
Identity exploration is one of the fundamental things that alternate realities let us do.

366
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,956
And when you choose a class or a race or whatever in one of

367
00:26:34,996 --> 00:26:37,698
these online worlds, like wow, you're effectively almost

368
00:26:37,758 --> 00:26:39,300
engaging in a personality test.

369
00:26:40,621 --> 00:26:43,423
People tend to choose archetypes that resonate and

370
00:26:43,463 --> 00:26:45,164
relate to how they visualize themselves.

371
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:52,670
This is why I hate voice chat, because it's one of the many

372
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,913
things that is taking these tools away from people.

373
00:26:57,835 --> 00:26:59,376
It extends beyond voice chat, though.

374
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:02,205
How many of you are short, like me?

375
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:04,688
All right, short people.

376
00:27:04,808 --> 00:27:07,290
You guys know that you have lower lifetime earnings

377
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:08,432
than tall people, right?

378
00:27:09,813 --> 00:27:12,616
You get less promotions and lower salaries?

379
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:14,598
Yeah.

380
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:17,781
So it turns out that halflings and gnomes

381
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:20,864
in fantasy role-playing games are in less XP per hour

382
00:27:20,984 --> 00:27:21,745
and level slower.

383
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:31,004
because we import real world biases into these worlds. Not intentionally, just the fact that

384
00:27:31,044 --> 00:27:38,709
we made halflings short results in them earning less XP because people have biases. So as we

385
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:45,254
chase realistic avatars, we should consider whether realism is really a good idea. If those

386
00:27:45,294 --> 00:27:48,356
are behaviors and beliefs that we actually want to reinforce or not.

387
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:52,589
You know, one of the beauties of the early internet and of

388
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:54,851
virtual worlds in particular is that nobody could tell you

389
00:27:54,871 --> 00:27:55,391
were a dog.

390
00:27:56,612 --> 00:27:59,674
Only now we can hear you barking on discord, right?

391
00:27:59,815 --> 00:28:00,335
And we know.

392
00:28:00,355 --> 00:28:02,457
So that's an issue.

393
00:28:05,525 --> 00:28:10,308
most obvious of these are tend to be related to gender presentation but race presentation is

394
00:28:10,348 --> 00:28:15,552
another one that's really frequently overlooked. I have lost count of the number of social spaces

395
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:23,537
that don't have race as a customization option. That is embarrassing. From the get go you

396
00:28:23,557 --> 00:28:28,760
should be thinking about it. It was controversial in star wars galaxies for us to have a breast

397
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:34,764
size slider. Fortunately female players pitched a fit.

398
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:40,013
when they found out it was controversial. Because it's

399
00:28:40,073 --> 00:28:44,997
important. People need to feel like they can be what they want

400
00:28:45,037 --> 00:28:51,322
to be. And be who they are. We had to rename it the torso

401
00:28:51,342 --> 00:28:55,285
slider though because LucasArts was very touchy about the

402
00:28:55,305 --> 00:28:59,568
terminology. Probably the biggest bias that is present in

403
00:28:59,588 --> 00:29:05,153
social VR is around empathy, frankly. Um, I don't know if

404
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:09,493
The challenge here is, well there's multiple challenges,

405
00:29:09,553 --> 00:29:11,955
but as people enter a space,

406
00:29:12,015 --> 00:29:13,316
if they don't have a stake in the space,

407
00:29:13,356 --> 00:29:15,358
if they don't have persistent identity in it already,

408
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,601
they, it's very easy to behave as a virtual sociopath.

409
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:22,304
They don't have any community ties whatsoever.

410
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:24,966
So you have to start creating investment

411
00:29:25,026 --> 00:29:27,047
into an identity really early on.

412
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:31,111
So those of you who are making systems that are drop-in,

413
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,965
don't, you have to start doing persistent identity. If you can

414
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:39,427
abandon identity, that's basically a license to do

415
00:29:39,447 --> 00:29:43,011
whatever you want and not get stopped. You can't use things

416
00:29:43,051 --> 00:29:46,054
like credit cards to block, for example. Average U.S. household

417
00:29:46,094 --> 00:29:49,238
I think has 13 credit card numbers. That's an awful lot of

418
00:29:49,318 --> 00:29:51,880
shots at harassing somebody without getting caught.

419
00:29:53,445 --> 00:30:00,311
So the real way you have to do it is by causing personal investment in the identity they are creating so that they don't want to lose it.

420
00:30:00,891 --> 00:30:02,813
They don't want to lose the investment they've made.

421
00:30:03,714 --> 00:30:09,478
But the other big thing that you need to do is increase channels for conveying emotional content.

422
00:30:10,672 --> 00:30:12,814
between the avatars, between the players.

423
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:16,137
And again, this is a place where voice

424
00:30:16,177 --> 00:30:18,460
kind of cuts both ways, right?

425
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,962
I mean, there are two classic ways of doing this.

426
00:30:21,483 --> 00:30:21,963
Very simple.

427
00:30:22,143 --> 00:30:24,386
One is gameplay that involves teamwork.

428
00:30:25,046 --> 00:30:26,688
The other one is an emote system.

429
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,072
Simply put, an emote system.

430
00:30:31,313 --> 00:30:33,295
Best practice emote systems.

431
00:30:34,913 --> 00:30:38,655
involve automatically parsing text chat and pulling out the

432
00:30:38,695 --> 00:30:41,617
emotional cues that people are already sticking in there, like

433
00:30:41,677 --> 00:30:46,739
smileys. You know this because Facebook messenger does it, chat

434
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:49,721
does it, Twitter does it, everything does this now. That's

435
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:55,263
best practice. Giving people manual puppeteering structures

436
00:30:55,364 --> 00:30:58,025
like, oh, I have to hit this combination of buttons to smile,

437
00:30:58,445 --> 00:31:01,186
results in people not smiling, I'm afraid. Right?

438
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:08,863
Yes, there's a subset of people who are good at puppeteering. Most people are not. Having

439
00:31:08,903 --> 00:31:13,605
the system puppeteer for them off of cues has been shown to be dramatically more

440
00:31:13,645 --> 00:31:19,887
effective. Dramatically more effective. I don't know how you're going to do this with

441
00:31:19,947 --> 00:31:23,989
voice. Maybe it can be a really cool research project for somebody to start developing

442
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:29,251
technology to do natural language processing and analysis of voice stressors. But I'm not

443
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:30,851
expecting it any time soon.

444
00:31:32,248 --> 00:31:36,778
So good luck, those of you working in that field, because

445
00:31:37,138 --> 00:31:39,403
wild voice does convey a significant amount of

446
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,265
emotional content.

447
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:48,692
particularly once you get into fictional social VR spaces of any sort, you can't expect people

448
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:54,454
to be trained actors in knowing how to convey emotion. It's going to be challenging. And if

449
00:31:54,494 --> 00:31:58,436
what they need to do is convey real emotion, they will prefer to use Skype where they get all

450
00:31:58,456 --> 00:32:06,539
the cues rather than settling for an inferior system. So my actual advice to social VR people

451
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:09,500
bluntly is to sidestep as many of these problems as possible.

452
00:32:10,355 --> 00:32:13,858
don't have large scale worlds with a bunch of strangers interacting with one another in an

453
00:32:13,918 --> 00:32:18,742
unsupervised fashion. Because I don't think you have solutions at the current level of

454
00:32:18,782 --> 00:32:24,206
technology for some of these problems. You know, maybe Facebook or Google will be solving

455
00:32:24,226 --> 00:32:29,210
these for you at some point, but right now they just don't. Stick to small groups, people who

456
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:33,773
mostly already know each other. Make the avatars relatively unrealistic so nobody cares about

457
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:39,157
the fact that the emotional cues are wrong. Play to the strengths.

458
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:43,695
The strengths of VR today are that VR is clumsy.

459
00:32:46,455 --> 00:32:47,055
Play with that.

460
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:49,816
I think that is part of why something like Job Simulator is

461
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:51,816
one of the most successful VR experiences we have.

462
00:32:52,657 --> 00:32:53,997
It embraces the limitation.

463
00:32:56,157 --> 00:33:00,318
Here's the thing, for those of you now who, how many of you

464
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:01,218
played Pokemon Go?

465
00:33:01,238 --> 00:33:05,079
I want to say in advance, Pokemon Go is an amazing

466
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:05,619
achievement.

467
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:08,595
It's phenomenal and brought joy to millions of people.

468
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:10,116
So I'm now going to shred it to pieces.

469
00:33:12,337 --> 00:33:14,258
All of these issues get dramatically worse once we're

470
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:15,198
talking about social AR.

471
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,601
You know, from the technology side, people are starting to

472
00:33:19,661 --> 00:33:22,942
figure out that a lot of people made this mistake.

473
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:26,724
They thought that the technology of VR headsets

474
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,786
would naturally lead into the technology for AR headsets.

475
00:33:29,826 --> 00:33:30,526
And they're wrong.

476
00:33:31,026 --> 00:33:32,187
It's kind of a speed of light thing.

477
00:33:32,207 --> 00:33:33,227
It's just not happening.

478
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:44,223
They are, if you are talking about social things, they are the same technology in this very

479
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:44,985
particular way.

480
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:50,776
I want to take you back in time to 2006 when a whole bunch of us got invited to Stanford

481
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:56,479
for an exercise of the Institute for the Future where we engaged in a futurist envisioning

482
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,861
project called the metaverse road map.

483
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:02,583
This was in those days when people thought it was a good idea to have Twitter feeds behind

484
00:34:02,643 --> 00:34:03,003
speakers.

485
00:34:04,724 --> 00:34:06,405
I'd love to see the one for this talk right now.

486
00:34:09,087 --> 00:34:11,168
This is what we said virtual worlds would become.

487
00:34:12,004 --> 00:34:16,946
We said there are four kinds. And at that time, almost all of them were virtual worlds.

488
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:21,509
Which is to say, fictional environments that you connect to through a client of maps of places

489
00:34:21,569 --> 00:34:28,532
that aren't real. Where you go run around and do stuff. That box holds Eve and a second life,

490
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:32,494
Habbo Hotel and World of Warcraft. Right?

491
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:38,175
But we said, you know, if all you do is swap out the data set

492
00:34:38,695 --> 00:34:42,478
of those maps, you instead get virtual worlds that are built

493
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:43,619
using the real world.

494
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:46,582
And you can log into those instead.

495
00:34:47,062 --> 00:34:48,584
And those are called mirror worlds.

496
00:34:48,664 --> 00:34:50,245
And it's a term that's been around for quite a while.

497
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:53,068
This is also the time when there are a lot of people who

498
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:55,570
are mounting backpacks on their back with computers and

499
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,133
then putting a webcam on their head and filming everything

500
00:34:59,173 --> 00:35:00,934
that they were doing and having to swap out hard drives

501
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:01,595
about every 20 minutes.

502
00:35:03,197 --> 00:35:04,317
This is called life logging.

503
00:35:05,238 --> 00:35:07,380
And yes, we saw that as being part

504
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,081
of virtual world structure as well.

505
00:35:09,822 --> 00:35:12,244
This is the identity piece, the identity component.

506
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:16,287
And then lastly, and chronologically last as well,

507
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:17,868
is what we called augmented reality,

508
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,310
where these things would start to come together.

509
00:35:21,011 --> 00:35:24,053
Where you might have a virtual world or a mirror world

510
00:35:24,153 --> 00:35:26,155
both overlaid on top of the real world,

511
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:27,776
and you engage in life logging

512
00:35:27,816 --> 00:35:29,358
as one of the ways to interact with it.

513
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,420
Well, all of these are now here.

514
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:38,652
All of these are now in fact here. And the thing is, even

515
00:35:38,692 --> 00:35:41,713
though the operators of all of these different services don't

516
00:35:42,134 --> 00:35:46,276
know this really, they are all running against what I would

517
00:35:46,296 --> 00:35:51,279
call virtual world servers. Virtual world back ends. It's

518
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:55,721
just that Twitter only bothered to build the chat part. And

519
00:35:55,741 --> 00:35:59,884
Waze only bothered to build the moving around part. And Yelp

520
00:36:00,044 --> 00:36:03,426
only bothered to build like region markers.

521
00:36:05,016 --> 00:36:11,339
Right? One of the key lessons of virtual worlds, and it's one

522
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,920
that actually a lot of virtual players just refuse to accept.

523
00:36:16,461 --> 00:36:19,442
And I think a lot of people who work primarily with headsets

524
00:36:19,643 --> 00:36:24,185
refuse to accept. Rendering is by far the least important part

525
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:28,586
of this entire field. Sorry if you're a graphics programmer.

526
00:36:30,213 --> 00:36:36,155
It is easily the part that matters the least. Every single graphical world I have ever seen

527
00:36:36,255 --> 00:36:44,958
has offered a plain text client. Why? Because the admins need it to go look at logs. Right? The

528
00:36:44,998 --> 00:36:49,200
worlds are on the server, the representation independent. We might have a canonical

529
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:54,821
client, but the representation is not the part that really, really matters.

530
00:36:55,607 --> 00:36:57,948
What matters is the action that's going on on the server,

531
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:00,310
which is where you actually track things like

532
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:03,011
the avatar profiles, their histories,

533
00:37:03,051 --> 00:37:05,432
the location of objects, how they interact with one another

534
00:37:05,452 --> 00:37:06,693
and what their behaviors are.

535
00:37:07,954 --> 00:37:10,995
So all of those things are actually virtual worlds.

536
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:12,636
I call this the goggles fallacy

537
00:37:13,396 --> 00:37:16,438
because it is distressing, perhaps inevitable,

538
00:37:16,898 --> 00:37:20,500
that the current boom in virtual reality

539
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,501
is being driven by the hardware.

540
00:37:25,432 --> 00:37:29,354
If you actually go look at what is going on in these various

541
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:33,577
settings, they're all about clients moving on servers.

542
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,180
Interacting with objects on servers.

543
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:42,104
Sometimes we drive around on those servers by driving

544
00:37:42,124 --> 00:37:43,204
around in the real world.

545
00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:45,926
You know, that's Waze and Google Maps.

546
00:37:46,527 --> 00:37:48,288
It's actually every Android phone.

547
00:37:48,468 --> 00:37:49,369
You guys know that, right?

548
00:37:49,489 --> 00:37:51,991
Android phones are, that's part of how Google detects

549
00:37:52,071 --> 00:37:53,091
where there's traffic jams.

550
00:37:54,144 --> 00:37:55,826
Your phone's not moving, tells them.

551
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:02,194
But Yelp and Zillow are all about teleporting around on

552
00:38:02,214 --> 00:38:04,077
the virtual side, but not the real side.

553
00:38:04,097 --> 00:38:05,519
But it doesn't matter.

554
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,882
Either way, there's an avatar moving on the virtual side.

555
00:38:08,944 --> 00:38:10,025
So it's the same technology.

556
00:38:11,238 --> 00:38:15,200
You can literally run down the kinds of technological elements required to build a virtual

557
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,462
world server. Does it simulate a space? Yes. Check, check, check. Where is the data from? Is it

558
00:38:20,482 --> 00:38:25,185
real or fictional? Doesn't matter. Who cares? Could be half and half. Does it track clients?

559
00:38:25,245 --> 00:38:29,727
Are they connected? Doesn't need to be constant on connection. It could be some of the time.

560
00:38:29,827 --> 00:38:36,870
Check, check, check. Are our clients positioned relative to one another spatially? The main

561
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:40,632
difference is that in WoW and Pokemon we actually bother to spawn bots in there.

562
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:47,902
right? And let you like interact with them in some fashion. That's about it. Of course these

563
00:38:47,962 --> 00:38:52,146
days we kind of allow people to spawn geotag markers into Google maps so we're kind of

564
00:38:52,186 --> 00:39:01,174
letting people spawn bots there too. I'll say it bluntly, an old school text mud from 1992 is

565
00:39:01,294 --> 00:39:07,220
closer to Snow Crash than anything that has been built with goggles. By quite a lot.

566
00:39:09,665 --> 00:39:15,127
A lot of defenders of VR start talking here about how the sense of presence that exists inside

567
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:22,290
of VR is what makes the difference and they're wrong. They're wrong. Telepresence was defined

568
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,731
back in the days before we had pictures.

569
00:39:25,694 --> 00:39:28,936
People reported those sensations in pure text environments.

570
00:39:29,276 --> 00:39:33,560
In factually, if I had to rank the level of presence,

571
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,643
I would probably put VR first, then the text games,

572
00:39:38,123 --> 00:39:39,705
then all the ones that are on monitors.

573
00:39:40,805 --> 00:39:43,007
Because text games actually embody you

574
00:39:43,407 --> 00:39:44,949
almost as powerfully as VR does.

575
00:39:45,734 --> 00:39:49,176
And in fact, if you are looking for more specific concrete

576
00:39:49,236 --> 00:39:54,439
lessons about how to deal with avatar intersection issues and

577
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:57,480
all the rest, I would be looking at how text mods

578
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,221
handled things.

579
00:39:58,761 --> 00:40:03,244
For example, consent systems for paired emotes was a very,

580
00:40:03,364 --> 00:40:06,105
very common design trope in text mods.

581
00:40:06,686 --> 00:40:09,207
One that also appears in modern day LARPing.

582
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:12,676
where you can't just hug somebody or grope somebody,

583
00:40:12,776 --> 00:40:15,339
but there is almost a two-factor authentication process

584
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:17,881
that players must go through in order to engage with others.

585
00:40:19,442 --> 00:40:21,584
That stuff popped up in the text worlds first,

586
00:40:21,704 --> 00:40:22,946
because in the text worlds,

587
00:40:23,786 --> 00:40:25,788
there was no distinction of distance.

588
00:40:26,108 --> 00:40:27,730
Everybody was standing on a pin

589
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,331
in each individual text room.

590
00:40:30,072 --> 00:40:32,014
So all it took was one word for them

591
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,296
to be interpenetrating with your avatar.

592
00:40:37,713 --> 00:40:42,119
The takeaway from this is, I mean, how many of you have heard crazy stories about Eve

593
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,402
or the plague in WoW or any of these things?

594
00:40:44,883 --> 00:40:46,085
You all heard crazy shit like that?

595
00:40:47,186 --> 00:40:47,527
Awesome!

596
00:40:47,927 --> 00:40:50,951
In a post-Pokemon Go world, expect that to start happening in the real world.

597
00:40:52,985 --> 00:40:58,330
right? All of those things will happen in the real world. Because all of these

598
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:02,894
technologies are really just virtual world servers. It is not going to be very long

599
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:07,578
until there is a template ID associated with your washing machine so that when you look at it,

600
00:41:07,618 --> 00:41:10,821
you'll be able to pull up the manual. You can do that crudely right now with Google, of

601
00:41:10,881 --> 00:41:16,326
course. But we're not very far away from it actually having an individual instance ID.

602
00:41:17,507 --> 00:41:19,289
Like your washing machine.

603
00:41:20,101 --> 00:41:25,365
and it will have its own character sheet that will have its repair history. Because all it

604
00:41:25,405 --> 00:41:31,490
needs to do is be an object in that database. In the run time database of our world. That's not

605
00:41:31,871 --> 00:41:37,155
far fetched. That's not science fictional. The problem is we never trust the client. What

606
00:41:37,215 --> 00:41:44,001
happens when you are the client? Because you are going to be the client. Your phone is

607
00:41:44,141 --> 00:41:47,925
anyway. And this is most relevant because of Pokemon Go. Okay?

608
00:41:48,537 --> 00:41:52,279
I'm going to pick on it, I can't help it. I already did a very detailed mathematical

609
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:57,082
breakdown of why it's advancement system was utterly broken. But I did that back in Austin,

610
00:41:57,102 --> 00:42:00,464
you can find that on my website, it's called systems designed for retention, if you like

611
00:42:00,504 --> 00:42:06,107
graphs, it's full of it. The real question for us in this room is around things like there are

612
00:42:06,147 --> 00:42:11,970
no player killer switches in meat space. Right? So if you start designing your social

613
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,932
structures in a way that incentivizes players to commit virtual violence against one another,

614
00:42:16,193 --> 00:42:17,813
they're probably going to start doing it for real.

615
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,844
All of these things can be quite unintentional. Pokemon Go, I'm sure, absolutely did not

616
00:42:26,924 --> 00:42:34,769
intend for its map of spawns to be racist and classist. And yet, it's really, really hard to

617
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:40,553
find Pokemon in poor black neighborhoods and in rural areas. Because its UGC map happened to

618
00:42:40,593 --> 00:42:46,217
be built out of kids who were going to Stanford and Berkeley. Right? Technologically

619
00:42:46,257 --> 00:42:47,618
advantaged college students.

620
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:54,746
further. What starts happening, you all heard, oh, Pokemon spawn in the Holocaust museum.

621
00:42:55,047 --> 00:43:03,720
Pokemon spawn in Arlington cemetery. Sure. Right? None of this happened on purpose. I don't

622
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,282
ascribe any malicious intent.

623
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:13,169
But nobody ever means to do this stuff. Nobody ever means to damage somebody's actual equity in

624
00:43:13,249 --> 00:43:21,317
their home by accidentally putting Pokémon spawn points or gyms in their privately owned

625
00:43:21,377 --> 00:43:30,144
backyard, thereby causing an endless stream of trespassing. And yet, it happened. Right? So we

626
00:43:30,185 --> 00:43:31,586
do have to think about these issues.

627
00:43:32,814 --> 00:43:38,419
It might be that someday legislation will appear that goes right alongside

628
00:43:38,759 --> 00:43:42,963
well there's water rights and mining rights and air traffic rights

629
00:43:43,584 --> 00:43:46,746
and virtual layer annotation rights.

630
00:43:47,567 --> 00:43:52,171
That might actually be the only solution to something like Pokemon spawning in your backyard.

631
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:57,155
And of course then somebody will license Pokemon rights to a company for money, right?

632
00:43:57,236 --> 00:43:58,977
I struck oil, I struck Pokemon.

633
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:04,943
But it starts raising questions like can or should a company

634
00:44:04,963 --> 00:44:09,185
like Niantic strike a deal with coffee shop A as opposed to

635
00:44:09,225 --> 00:44:12,908
coffee shop B, thereby tilting the level of the business

636
00:44:12,968 --> 00:44:16,169
balance in that area? There's no rules or regulations around

637
00:44:16,229 --> 00:44:17,870
stuff like that. They could direct traffic somewhere it

638
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:21,412
isn't wanted. What if somebody happens to create a really cool

639
00:44:21,452 --> 00:44:24,274
social AR game and says, wow, it would be really fun, you know,

640
00:44:24,334 --> 00:44:26,395
I'm actually a secret gamer gator, I'm going to start

641
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,997
spawning Pokemon on top of a Black Lives Matter rally.

642
00:44:30,908 --> 00:44:34,570
It is trivially easy for an operator of a virtual world to pull a stunt like that.

643
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:42,953
We've seen the early harbingers of things like that. Anonymous got its start by holding a flash

644
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:49,795
mob in front of a Scientology facility in New York City. We kind of trained people to do this.

645
00:44:51,436 --> 00:44:56,778
All those anonymous kids, we kind of built them, right? We've been training them how to do this

646
00:44:56,818 --> 00:44:56,978
stuff.

647
00:44:58,286 --> 00:45:00,768
Phrases like geo tagging mistakenly give us the

648
00:45:00,848 --> 00:45:03,110
impression that, oh, we're sticking a little bit of

649
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,052
virtual on the real, when what is happening is actually the

650
00:45:06,092 --> 00:45:06,873
exact opposite.

651
00:45:07,753 --> 00:45:10,436
We're actually sticking a little bit of real stuff into

652
00:45:10,476 --> 00:45:12,557
what is already a primarily virtual environment.

653
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:15,820
The Harbingers here get real.

654
00:45:16,721 --> 00:45:20,303
We used to say, oh, I even said it earlier, a character

655
00:45:20,363 --> 00:45:23,246
choice in an MMO is effectively a personality test.

656
00:45:24,031 --> 00:45:26,233
But so is a collection of your likes on Facebook,

657
00:45:26,253 --> 00:45:28,474
because Facebook is really just an extended character sheet.

658
00:45:29,135 --> 00:45:31,077
And sure enough, that's why there's a company called

659
00:45:31,097 --> 00:45:33,378
Cambridge Analytica that data-mined that data on 220

660
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:37,382
million Americans and used it for targeted micro-advertising

661
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:39,383
in order to both suppress votes and encourage people to

662
00:45:39,443 --> 00:45:42,866
come out and vote and get us Brexit and Trump.

663
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:46,649
Because if you run a virtual world, that is the kind of

664
00:45:46,789 --> 00:45:49,211
panopticon power you have.

665
00:45:53,055 --> 00:46:00,638
Fake news. Fake news is an instant dungeon. It's an instant dungeon personalized tailored just

666
00:46:00,678 --> 00:46:04,880
for you. You get your own spawns and there's Alex Jones is the boss at the bottom of the

667
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:11,383
dungeon. And you get to play lizard people. Right? Because that's the power you have when

668
00:46:11,403 --> 00:46:18,145
you're running a virtual space. You all saw the mobs for Pikachu. I have no idea whether it

669
00:46:18,165 --> 00:46:20,866
was a conscious decision in that game.

670
00:46:21,831 --> 00:46:26,115
to make it so that each spawn of a Pokemon was instanced.

671
00:46:27,136 --> 00:46:30,539
But if they had not been, if it had been zero-sum,

672
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:32,541
there that day in Central Park

673
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,742
around that Santa Monica pier,

674
00:46:34,242 --> 00:46:35,924
and there was only one Pikachu to have,

675
00:46:36,604 --> 00:46:38,887
I think we would have seen Pika murders by now.

676
00:46:42,287 --> 00:46:46,947
It's human nature. And this sounds like it's crazy, but it is not. I know it because it

677
00:46:47,047 --> 00:46:52,448
already happened. In Ultima Online, when we launched first in Hong Kong, the triads joined

678
00:46:52,569 --> 00:46:56,849
the game. And they would go and do their player killer war in the game, and then they would

679
00:46:56,889 --> 00:47:02,530
take it to the streets. Because by designing our game in such a way that it encouraged

680
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:06,791
tribalism, encouraged othering other players, and then encouraged violence between the

681
00:47:06,831 --> 00:47:11,472
groups, we encouraged them to do it everywhere. What happens when the real world is the

682
00:47:11,492 --> 00:47:11,992
playing field?

683
00:47:13,448 --> 00:47:19,390
My local gym is a locked church. They've had a lot of problems with people parking in the

684
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:23,671
parking lot at 3 a.m. and getting as close as possible to the stained glass windows to try to

685
00:47:23,711 --> 00:47:30,973
catch a signal so they can zap a Pokemon inside. How long until they break in, I don't know. The

686
00:47:31,073 --> 00:47:37,015
phones have all of this stuff built in. They do. It's built into the phones, but the phones

687
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:38,215
at least have privacy chips.

688
00:47:39,098 --> 00:47:41,540
The phones have private store houses that even Apple can't

689
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:45,242
break into its own phone. But just yesterday a cloud stuffed

690
00:47:45,422 --> 00:47:49,004
toy, I don't even remember the name of it, turned out that they

691
00:47:49,024 --> 00:47:51,926
were storing the voice chat logs of all of the kids that ever

692
00:47:51,966 --> 00:47:56,169
talked to their plushie on AWS instance on a database that was

693
00:47:56,229 --> 00:48:03,893
not passworded. We don't even need the actual user. We don't

694
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,661
It's enough to just get enough users to see the perturbations

695
00:48:08,701 --> 00:48:12,042
of what's around them. Are we prepared to community manage

696
00:48:12,082 --> 00:48:15,282
downtown San Francisco when we have better history tracking of

697
00:48:15,322 --> 00:48:19,263
what each individual does than the police or the government do?

698
00:48:20,683 --> 00:48:23,924
You want to manage community for downtown San Francisco? We

699
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:26,825
couldn't even handle a bunch of kids angry about supposed ethics

700
00:48:26,885 --> 00:48:30,385
and video game journalism. We're supposed to deal with San

701
00:48:30,425 --> 00:48:34,126
Francisco? But those are the tools we're taking up.

702
00:48:37,374 --> 00:48:41,037
It doesn't take away from the achievement of Pokemon Go. It's possible to achieve great

703
00:48:41,077 --> 00:48:48,623
things and still open Pandora's box. But we do have these lessons. We do know that these are

704
00:48:48,643 --> 00:48:53,447
the things that we can be thinking about. And I realize I'm here at GDC and I'm talking to you

705
00:48:53,487 --> 00:48:57,210
about stuff that does not seem very game like at all. But I'm talking with you about it

706
00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:03,195
because you're my peeps. You're the ones who will listen. I can't get a, you know,

707
00:49:04,033 --> 00:49:09,675
I can't get a Google or anybody to listen to this. If there's anybody from Apple here, call me.

708
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:15,016
We're going to be playing logged in whether we signed up for it or not is kind of the

709
00:49:15,056 --> 00:49:21,378
message I'm trying to give. That's your take away. That's really what this is about. And we

710
00:49:21,438 --> 00:49:25,479
usually call entities like that governments. It's not an accident that we talked about

711
00:49:25,579 --> 00:49:31,560
governance clear back in the text mods. So yeah, monopolistic giant governments.

712
00:49:32,732 --> 00:49:35,815
There's a little bit more awareness of that since I

713
00:49:35,855 --> 00:49:37,476
submitted this talk months ago.

714
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,859
Zak has actually said, oh, maybe this news thing's an

715
00:49:39,879 --> 00:49:40,119
issue.

716
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,363
And we do have our first gold farmer in the White House.

717
00:49:44,683 --> 00:49:47,426
Steve Bannon used to run IGE, the gold farming company, and

718
00:49:47,466 --> 00:49:50,649
then he turned around and built a gaming website network.

719
00:49:50,689 --> 00:49:52,811
That was his training wheels for running Breitbart.

720
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,233
So some people are paying attention.

721
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:02,421
When a time comes that new modes and venues exist for communities, and said modes are

722
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:06,766
different enough from the existing ones, that question arises as to the applicability of

723
00:50:06,826 --> 00:50:11,651
past custom and law, and when said venues have become a forum for interaction in society

724
00:50:11,691 --> 00:50:12,571
for the general public.

725
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,553
regardless of the intent of the creators of said venue.

726
00:50:15,853 --> 00:50:21,296
And at a time when said communities and spaces are rising in popularity and widely exploited for commercial gain,

727
00:50:21,776 --> 00:50:29,559
it behooves those involved in said communities and venues to affirm and declare the inalienable rights of the members of said communities.

728
00:50:31,741 --> 00:50:31,961
August 27, 2000.

729
00:50:36,877 --> 00:50:40,080
To my knowledge, exactly three virtual worlds in history

730
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,202
have bothered to adopt that Declaration

731
00:50:42,402 --> 00:50:43,503
of the Rights of Players.

732
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:48,748
But the need for it is now greater than ever,

733
00:50:48,768 --> 00:50:51,131
and I really wish Pokemon had adopted it.

734
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:54,994
And I sure hope that those of you

735
00:50:55,014 --> 00:50:56,396
who are going back to your companies

736
00:50:56,436 --> 00:50:59,058
will seriously consider, oh, please, update it, revise it.

737
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,603
But start thinking in terms of the rights that players should be having in these spaces.

738
00:51:03,683 --> 00:51:06,546
Because soon enough, Internet of Things is going to hit.

739
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:08,808
This is also not fiction.

740
00:51:09,428 --> 00:51:11,430
I had this conversation with Zuckerberg too.

741
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,231
This is why he bought Oculus.

742
00:51:14,532 --> 00:51:17,475
To turn the world into a unified database of objects.

743
00:51:19,296 --> 00:51:21,118
I'm probably not getting any more consulting gigs there.

744
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:21,538
Oh well.

745
00:51:23,019 --> 00:51:25,101
We're actively collaborating in this process.

746
00:51:25,481 --> 00:51:27,022
All that's missing is unifying the data.

747
00:51:27,859 --> 00:51:31,901
Facebook owning identity and chat, Amazon the object template database, Google the runtime

748
00:51:31,921 --> 00:51:33,982
template database, Apple the client, you know.

749
00:51:34,483 --> 00:51:37,424
We're collaborating in this process and what comes, I don't know.

750
00:51:37,925 --> 00:51:38,845
I honestly don't know.

751
00:51:39,605 --> 00:51:40,346
That's why I'm here.

752
00:51:40,366 --> 00:51:41,867
I need your help.

753
00:51:43,348 --> 00:51:47,390
We need each other's help if we're going to deal with this because this is not hypothetical.

754
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:55,214
Do not let our world be designed by the people who prefer the lobby of the W to the IGF.

755
00:51:57,235 --> 00:52:00,798
You guys don't go to the lobby of the W, I hope. Right?

756
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:05,761
Technologists in this room, you guys know how much of this we

757
00:52:05,801 --> 00:52:09,744
can build right now. Bluetooth LE beacons, some simple mesh

758
00:52:09,764 --> 00:52:17,270
networking. We could build this now. So I wish HoloLens and

759
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:20,032
Magic Leap had that emblazoned on the eyeballs instead of

760
00:52:20,112 --> 00:52:22,533
demos because the chip that matters is the networking chip.

761
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,255
Not the graphics chip.

762
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:32,323
That is what keeps me up at night. I'm sorry, GDC is not supposed to be a downer. If we had all

763
00:52:32,343 --> 00:52:38,586
gone to the EGW, I'm sure we would all be leaving here inspired and psyched up. But this is

764
00:52:38,626 --> 00:52:45,130
the advocacy track. But I'll say this. This room is the one that gives me hope. How many of you

765
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:53,094
have played a game in the last 24 hours? With a stranger? How many of you feel games, hey,

766
00:52:53,174 --> 00:52:54,635
they're for connecting, right?

767
00:52:56,362 --> 00:53:00,023
How many of you feel games, about fairness, supposed to be

768
00:53:00,063 --> 00:53:01,063
fair, right?

769
00:53:02,784 --> 00:53:06,784
How many of you think games are for being smart, right?

770
00:53:08,025 --> 00:53:09,165
And that games are for everyone?

771
00:53:10,705 --> 00:53:10,925
Yeah?

772
00:53:11,946 --> 00:53:12,206
Good.

773
00:53:13,786 --> 00:53:14,806
That's what gives me the hope.

774
00:53:14,826 --> 00:53:18,047
Because entertainment has always led the way on this

775
00:53:18,087 --> 00:53:20,407
stuff, and that is a pretty good ethos with which to start.

776
00:53:22,028 --> 00:53:24,448
And this is a group that is willing to read giant strategy

777
00:53:24,488 --> 00:53:24,708
guides.

778
00:53:26,224 --> 00:53:30,026
So please, go read the work of, you know, read Julian DeBelle,

779
00:53:30,086 --> 00:53:33,108
read Nick Yee, read T.L. Taylor, read Thomas Malaby.

780
00:53:33,608 --> 00:53:36,030
Go read all of the endless stuff that has been written about

781
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:39,032
this, because I got to tell you, by the way, virtual worlds

782
00:53:39,372 --> 00:53:42,594
are the best documented part of all of video games and the

783
00:53:42,634 --> 00:53:44,516
most studied, probably by an order of magnitude.

784
00:53:45,816 --> 00:53:46,917
The stuff is out there.

785
00:53:48,638 --> 00:53:52,721
So, you know, frankly, I'm leaving our collective fate in

786
00:53:52,761 --> 00:53:53,341
your hands here.

787
00:53:55,782 --> 00:54:00,205
These are your tools. Now you know what you're actually doing.

788
00:54:01,145 --> 00:54:03,727
Right? It is not what you were not making cute archery

789
00:54:03,767 --> 00:54:08,089
simulators. It is not what this was ever about. Now you know

790
00:54:08,129 --> 00:54:11,031
better. And that's good. So it shouldn't be too much of a

791
00:54:11,071 --> 00:54:14,773
downer. You're the best qualified people on earth to

792
00:54:14,933 --> 00:54:23,038
actually build this future. So go out there. Let's have some

793
00:54:23,138 --> 00:54:23,318
fun.

794
00:54:24,763 --> 00:54:29,906
Right? Seriously. Let's explore. Have some fun. Just get your

795
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:45,535
homework done first. Thank you. We probably have like some

796
00:54:45,595 --> 00:54:52,219
seconds for questions. Five minutes for questions says the

797
00:54:52,259 --> 00:54:53,199
glowing yellow sign.

798
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:56,441
There are microphones here if anybody has any, but you don't

799
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:57,822
because I've persuaded you completely.

800
00:54:57,862 --> 00:54:58,342
That's awesome.

801
00:54:59,043 --> 00:54:59,563
Now, there we go.

802
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:05,928
Hi, I thought it was really interesting what you said

803
00:55:05,968 --> 00:55:12,312
about, essentially, you have the responsibility, and you

804
00:55:12,332 --> 00:55:13,753
have some legal responsibility.

805
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:22,789
You can't go, even if someone wants to open up a taco stand, you have to deal with the health

806
00:55:22,809 --> 00:55:31,193
department and all those things. If you run a bed and breakfast, you have to do that. So all

807
00:55:31,233 --> 00:55:33,755
these things are not unreasonable.

808
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:38,586
for people to, you know, devs to take into account. And I guess,

809
00:55:38,866 --> 00:55:42,287
you know, dealing with human nature, a turbine, we had to

810
00:55:42,347 --> 00:55:47,109
take out the point up emote because, you know, it's a Nazi

811
00:55:47,129 --> 00:55:50,570
thing. And, yeah, you don't always expect that at the

812
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:55,873
beginning, but it's, yeah, it's bad stuff. Yeah, so if the

813
00:55:55,893 --> 00:55:58,734
questions all turn out to just be MMO veterans coming up and

814
00:55:58,754 --> 00:56:01,655
saying, yeah, that, that's fine. Thanks.

815
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:14,740
By the way, the inventor of TTP. Actually it was Freeman. Oh,

816
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,642
really? Jeff Freeman.

817
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:25,080
There's one thing that I wanted to say just to pile on top of this, which is that over the course

818
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:29,803
of WoW we saw something that's really remarkable, which is something that makes me really sad

819
00:56:29,843 --> 00:56:38,569
that people aren't making MMOs anymore, which is that MMOs started as the wild west of gaming

820
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:44,533
and ended up being the single safest genre for women to play in gaming.

821
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:49,178
because everything else is unmoderated voice chat,

822
00:56:50,059 --> 00:56:53,203
whereas MMOs have persistent identity,

823
00:56:53,303 --> 00:56:56,286
have persistent community, have the logging,

824
00:56:56,507 --> 00:56:57,989
all of the stuff that you talked about,

825
00:56:58,549 --> 00:56:59,951
and that's something that we fought.

826
00:57:00,894 --> 00:57:03,536
And Blizzard led the way and made it real.

827
00:57:03,677 --> 00:57:06,479
And you can actually see the gender split of that audience

828
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:09,401
of wow, just go from 2080 to 5050

829
00:57:10,162 --> 00:57:11,443
over the course of a decade.

830
00:57:11,923 --> 00:57:14,445
And I think that's important for us to realize

831
00:57:14,846 --> 00:57:16,107
it took a lot of work.

832
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,148
And I have a question, I just wanted to be sure

833
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,409
that we all acknowledge that.

834
00:57:19,629 --> 00:57:20,911
Yeah, I think we should.

835
00:57:20,931 --> 00:57:23,773
And it's even more depressing when you realize

836
00:57:23,793 --> 00:57:25,654
that the starting point of 2080

837
00:57:26,295 --> 00:57:29,017
was actually already way the hell ahead.

838
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,982
right, because at the time that virtual worlds were starting,

839
00:57:34,042 --> 00:57:36,684
the gender split for typical mainstream gaming

840
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,204
was more like 95-5.

841
00:57:39,225 --> 00:57:43,927
So virtual worlds were already dramatically more inclusive

842
00:57:43,987 --> 00:57:46,688
spaces than gaming was in general.

843
00:57:47,049 --> 00:57:49,470
And now we've made a lot of progress.

844
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:53,252
And along comes Xbox Live, oh my god, right?

845
00:57:54,352 --> 00:57:57,093
So yeah, there's definitely a lot to learn there,

846
00:57:57,113 --> 00:57:58,174
a lot of lessons to take on.

847
00:57:59,337 --> 00:58:00,237
Let's go over to this side.

848
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:07,282
I think you said for the ideal virtual space, the avatars would be non-realistic and not moving.

849
00:58:08,022 --> 00:58:11,284
Can you elaborate on the not moving, because not moving in VR seems...

850
00:58:12,265 --> 00:58:14,426
Especially with hand controllers, it seems kind of bad.

851
00:58:14,907 --> 00:58:18,069
Not moving very much. I actually mean locomotion, physical locomotion.

852
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:21,151
So, yeah, VR is really good at...

853
00:58:22,611 --> 00:58:26,293
clumsily moving arms. It's really good at that. It's pretty

854
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:29,796
bad at moving your legs. As we know, right? Most of the

855
00:58:29,836 --> 00:58:33,178
locomotion methods involve short hop teleporting and whatnot

856
00:58:33,238 --> 00:58:36,281
because of the nausea issues, vestibular, blah, blah, blah.

857
00:58:36,621 --> 00:58:39,923
But the other side of that issue is that, you know, allowing one

858
00:58:39,963 --> 00:58:42,865
avatar to move on to another is one of the starting points for

859
00:58:42,906 --> 00:58:47,769
these problems. If I were making a social VR thing that I wanted

860
00:58:47,809 --> 00:58:51,512
to be a commercial success, I would go clone IMVU.

861
00:58:52,965 --> 00:58:57,848
You sit at opposite sides of a table. You're sitting. You can

862
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:01,331
wave your hands and head all you want. You can build crazy ass

863
00:59:01,391 --> 00:59:03,672
avatars, right, because it's all about personal expression and

864
00:59:03,692 --> 00:59:06,054
getting to know the other person. It's limited to two

865
00:59:06,114 --> 00:59:08,576
people at a time, so if you bail or block, you'll never have to

866
00:59:08,596 --> 00:59:12,018
deal with that person again. It just sidesteps all the issues,

867
00:59:12,218 --> 00:59:16,361
right? Whereas if you say, no, what I really want to build is

868
00:59:16,421 --> 00:59:19,723
wow, only in a VR headset, I go, then you're going to have to

869
00:59:19,783 --> 00:59:22,325
build all of the infrastructure that Damien just talked about.

870
00:59:23,371 --> 00:59:25,252
and you can't, frankly.

871
00:59:25,892 --> 00:59:27,253
I'm not sure anybody can, right?

872
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:29,975
Like I don't, literally do not know a way

873
00:59:30,095 --> 00:59:31,796
for people to solve some of those issues

874
00:59:31,836 --> 00:59:34,357
with voice chat at current levels of technology.

875
00:59:34,897 --> 00:59:35,558
Will we get there?

876
00:59:35,658 --> 00:59:37,919
Sure, but not today.

877
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:39,560
So that's really what I meant.

878
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,240
Thanks.

879
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:40,900
Sure.

880
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:49,411
I am aged enough to have played MUDs and traditional MMOs for decades.

881
00:59:49,691 --> 00:59:54,354
People tend not to take it very well when they get banned, even in text mods.

882
00:59:55,195 --> 01:00:01,640
So what happens when the form we are projecting into a virtual world is our form?

883
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:06,964
Are people going to get more addicted to that experience such that we could expect severe

884
01:00:07,024 --> 01:00:09,185
reactions from people who would be banned from those worlds?

885
01:00:10,254 --> 01:00:15,077
No, because most people who want to project their real forms aren't going to bother to use virtual worlds to do it.

886
01:00:15,137 --> 01:00:17,699
Virtual worlds convey real forms really, really badly.

887
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:19,660
Right?

888
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,661
That's not what I mean.

889
01:00:20,981 --> 01:00:23,222
I know what you mean. I think I do.

890
01:00:25,243 --> 01:00:27,104
People will take it more...

891
01:00:28,643 --> 01:00:35,508
You're basically asking will people take banning and punishment more seriously when what they projected is their real self, right?

892
01:00:35,608 --> 01:00:41,092
They put more of themselves physically into it. We're playing a bunch of MMOs. It's a lot of text. Maybe there's chat.

893
01:00:41,372 --> 01:00:43,914
But in virtual reality, you are there.

894
01:00:44,675 --> 01:00:48,858
Yeah, Avatar might not be, you know, might not look like you, but to you, you are in that space.

895
01:00:48,898 --> 01:00:51,120
So what happens when somebody kicks you out of that space?

896
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,901
Yeah, I think there's probably a physical reaction,

897
01:00:53,921 --> 01:00:56,502
but in practice, I actually literally do not buy

898
01:00:56,542 --> 01:00:58,664
that you are more there in the VR case

899
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,585
than you are in the others, right?

900
01:01:02,426 --> 01:01:06,328
The building up of identity is the thing

901
01:01:06,348 --> 01:01:10,371
that actually stings, and so it's the loss of that identity

902
01:01:10,491 --> 01:01:11,892
is what ends up being really painful.

903
01:01:13,092 --> 01:01:15,374
And CAs are signaling me that we have to go

904
01:01:15,454 --> 01:01:17,015
to the overflow questions room.

905
01:01:17,315 --> 01:01:20,176
So really fast, on that, to add to your list,

906
01:01:20,317 --> 01:01:21,097
live on the screen.

907
01:01:21,812 --> 01:01:27,517
Yes, Sherry Turkle. If I started listing books and academics we would be here all day. I'll

908
01:01:27,697 --> 01:01:33,102
head to, just follow me. We'll find a spot out there. We'll find a spot out there. We'll find
