1
00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:11,818
Okay. All right, so we're going to get started. As a reminder, please mute your cell phones.

2
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:16,342
And I think that's it. Fill out the evaluations. Fill out the evaluations at the end, please.

3
00:00:16,522 --> 00:00:27,031
Thank you. So, yeah, this talks about Pro Guitar featuring Rock Band 3. My name is Jason

4
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:31,535
Booth. I'm the Senior Technical Designer at Harmonix, and I was responsible for design

5
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:33,317
and prototyping the feature.

6
00:00:34,348 --> 00:00:36,910
I'm Sylvain Dubrowski, senior designer at Harmonix.

7
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,112
On Rock Band 3, I was in charge of gameplay systems.

8
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:44,775
One of the things I did was work on Pro Guitar and Strike Team

9
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,336
Lead for most of the project.

10
00:00:48,578 --> 00:00:50,219
OK, for those of you who don't know what Pro Guitar is,

11
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:51,580
first let's check out this video.

12
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:41,722
All right, so thanks to Fender for that video.

13
00:01:41,962 --> 00:01:44,062
This talk is about Pro Guitar and Rock Band 3

14
00:01:44,443 --> 00:01:45,603
and our experiences making it.

15
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:47,423
It was a big, ambitious feature,

16
00:01:47,464 --> 00:01:49,144
and we learned a lot of things in its production.

17
00:01:50,905 --> 00:01:53,005
So first I want to talk about why we made this feature.

18
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:56,006
As a little bit of context, in 2008,

19
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:57,467
music game sales were around 16%

20
00:01:58,287 --> 00:01:59,607
of North American video game sales.

21
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:02,468
We knew we had to innovate for our hardcore players

22
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:03,389
looking for a new challenge.

23
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:05,009
And we knew that...

24
00:02:05,773 --> 00:02:09,937
being able to play real guitar in Rock Band 3 is a good extension of Harmonics' mission,

25
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:14,360
which is to teach non-musicians the joy of, um, making and performing music.

26
00:02:16,422 --> 00:02:19,504
So you might have heard a bit about this in previous Harmonics talks, so I'll go quick.

27
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:22,947
Um, this is the one question. The one question is a question you can ask

28
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:25,229
about any of your features in your game to see if they make sense.

29
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,333
You can use it to align your team. Guitar Hero's one question is, is it rock?

30
00:02:30,774 --> 00:02:31,374
So you can see likeâ€¦.

31
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,653
Iconic characters with their own over-the-top special moves is a good answer to that question.

32
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:40,536
When it came time to work on Rock Band, Harmonix added features like Character Creator with

33
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:45,420
user expression, being able to have more realistic graphics, putting tattoos on your guys. Those

34
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,663
are all good answers to the question of Rock Band, which is, is it an authentic band experience?

35
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:54,967
When it came time to work on Rock Band 3, you can see features like Real Instruments.

36
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:59,691
We added Pro Keys and cymbals to the drums, Pro Guitar, and Harmonies are all good answers

37
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,672
to the question, is it an authentic band experience?

38
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:06,458
So the first pair we're going to talk about is the first three months.

39
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,782
This is where we had a group of senior developers and management to talk about the feature.

40
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:19,368
Yeah, so I started thinking about this problem space, right?

41
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:21,169
Of, well, what is it we're really trying to do?

42
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:24,632
Are we trying to, you know, teach somebody how to play a guitar who's never played one before?

43
00:03:24,732 --> 00:03:27,754
Or is it just really about playing Rock Band with a guitar?

44
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,937
And when I started thinking about this, I realized that they don't actually intersect that much.

45
00:03:32,518 --> 00:03:33,498
And to compound things...

46
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:35,963
The sort of feedback that we're going to need to give,

47
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,784
the information we're going to need to display,

48
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:41,145
actually radically changes as somebody becomes more comfortable with a guitar.

49
00:03:42,846 --> 00:03:45,747
So right off the bat, we established our target audience

50
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:48,708
as being sort of the hard-to-expert rock band players,

51
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,709
the people who have been, you know, playing a lot of our game,

52
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:52,810
but they didn't necessarily have guitar experience,

53
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,790
but were interested in learning.

54
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,772
And we set a sort of modest goal of like, hey, you know,

55
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:01,394
If these guys are able to sort of play a campfire version of songs at the end of this,

56
00:04:01,454 --> 00:04:02,695
then we've kind of won, right?

57
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:07,878
If we can get them to play, you know, a couple song version of, you know, a couple chord version of some song,

58
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:12,361
then they're going to feel really good, and maybe they'll go on and learn more about guitar and music.

59
00:04:13,742 --> 00:04:17,344
And sort of our approach was to use this sort of ramp we have in our games,

60
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:19,926
where you start out on easy and you're playing a very simplified version,

61
00:04:20,246 --> 00:04:22,708
and you work your way up to a much more complex version over time.

62
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:27,411
Another sort of initial decision was we have this great illusion in our games.

63
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:31,039
The first time you play, you know, the first time you play Guitar Hero or Rock Band,

64
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:34,821
you hit some silly little gem, you know, representation on this guitar,

65
00:04:34,861 --> 00:04:36,702
and then this huge sound comes out of the speaker.

66
00:04:36,722 --> 00:04:38,523
And that's really rewarding to players.

67
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:42,565
So rather than, you know, the traditional instrument learning experience

68
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:44,846
where the first sound you make actually sounds really horrible,

69
00:04:45,346 --> 00:04:47,687
we were going to use that illusion, so the first time you get something right,

70
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:50,528
you got that big sort of feedback.

71
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,130
Okay, so...

72
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:58,988
There's a lot of ideas and there's a large possibility space at this time.

73
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:02,771
But the problem is, you know, Harmonics is a big company and we have a lot of projects,

74
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:05,833
and at this point we didn't actually have coding resources to get things in the game.

75
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:11,156
So what we did was we explored the space as much as we could, you know, with designers

76
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:15,059
and artists, design docs, pictures, and video. I'm going to show you some of that stuff right

77
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:20,242
now. So as a quick primer, for those of you who

78
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:23,825
don't play guitar, if you're looking at a guitar neck, it has these raised metal objects

79
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:24,405
called frets.

80
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:29,377
You push the string down behind the fret, and then you pluck the string with your other

81
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:33,298
hand, and that actually will make sounds. And as you move your finger along different

82
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:35,318
frets, you'll actually make different types of sounds.

83
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:41,400
On a rock band guitar, this is actually replicated by the five buttons. They represent five different

84
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,421
frets. So when you're holding the second red button, you can see that that is replicating

85
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:49,482
holding down behind the second fret and picking a string.

86
00:05:51,122 --> 00:05:54,003
So we call this fret relative. As you move from left to right,

87
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:56,789
You're actually moving up from the first to the fifth fret.

88
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:59,751
And these things coming down the track, which we call gems,

89
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:01,453
are colored to represent that.

90
00:06:01,813 --> 00:06:04,856
When you have to hit that, as it crosses the bar at the bottom,

91
00:06:05,256 --> 00:06:05,937
you're hitting a fret.

92
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:08,379
So this red one coming down, that's the second fret

93
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:08,919
you'd have to hit.

94
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,741
And time is the next axis.

95
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:15,265
One of the things we wanted to experiment with first

96
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:18,728
is the idea of fret relative, because millions of our players

97
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:20,469
have been playing this game.

98
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:22,802
We kind of baked this knowledge into them.

99
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:24,602
We thought this might be the first thing we should try.

100
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:28,844
So here's an example from an early design document.

101
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:30,805
You can see on the top, if the player was

102
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:33,646
to be playing a real guitar, in this example,

103
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,127
the third position represents the third fret.

104
00:06:36,547 --> 00:06:38,508
So the player would be holding the third fret

105
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:39,249
with his left hand.

106
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,229
And each of these gems have a color on it.

107
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:43,270
And the color represents which string you'd have to hit.

108
00:06:43,831 --> 00:06:44,611
So in this example.

109
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:49,020
I'm holding the third fret, and on the green one, I'd have to hit the lowest string.

110
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,541
On the red one, I'd have to hit the next string up from that.

111
00:06:53,742 --> 00:06:57,264
Here's another example of that, where color and position represent which fret you'd have

112
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,805
to hit. The string position, you can see on the gems,

113
00:06:59,865 --> 00:07:04,568
is represented by stars in this example. Or, actually, there's numbers that are not

114
00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:09,330
represented there that we could have tried. So we quickly moved into videos.

115
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:13,352
Here's a 3D Studio Max mockup that our artist made.

116
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:16,778
It's always good to do a max mockup with real data.

117
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:18,319
In our case, this is songs.

118
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,040
Let me turn up a tiny bit.

119
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,041
Can you guys hear that?

120
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:31,288
So this max mockup, you can see, kind of was hard to understand

121
00:07:31,328 --> 00:07:32,268
and kind of hard to read, right?

122
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:34,090
It's a pretty standard song.

123
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,771
And there's a lot of stuff going on.

124
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,292
And this convinced a lot of us that maybe fret relative

125
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,373
was not the best approach.

126
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,870
Then we started thinking about the idea of string relative.

127
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,251
If you turn the guitar neck 90 degrees,

128
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:49,052
instead of looking at the frets,

129
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:50,432
you're now looking down the fretboard.

130
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:52,893
You'd have your lowest strings on one side

131
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,314
and your highest strings on the other side.

132
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,615
Gems coming down, instead of telling you,

133
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,215
coming down what fret they would on,

134
00:07:58,335 --> 00:07:59,576
they would come down and tell you

135
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:00,796
which string you have to play on.

136
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:03,217
And something about the gem would have to represent

137
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:05,138
what fret to play instead of what string.

138
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:07,979
So, let's look at one example here.

139
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,540
This is an early art mock-up.

140
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,300
It is actually pretty confusing.

141
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,460
So.

142
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:15,176
Let's talk through it a little bit. On the right-hand side, you can see each of these

143
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:19,119
gems are coming down on a unique string, meaning you'd have to strum that string when it reaches

144
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:23,282
the bar at the bottom. And then there's a light on it that tells you relative position

145
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:26,845
of actually which fret you'd have to hit. Kind of confusing. On the left-hand side,

146
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:31,769
there's the idea of what a chord could look like in this. We still haven't quite nailed

147
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:37,053
that. Then we put this into video. This is an actual song in motion. There's no sound

148
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:37,454
on this one.

149
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:41,429
You can see that there's a lot to process here in real time.

150
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:43,469
And this is kind of scary for us.

151
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,910
We were happy to try string relative,

152
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,610
but that wasn't maybe super successful.

153
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,430
But then we got to this one right here.

154
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:51,871
This came towards the end of our period here.

155
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:54,991
And you can see, like, with that same real data we had before,

156
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:56,392
this is looking a lot more promising.

157
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:58,532
This is actually closer to what we end up with.

158
00:08:59,092 --> 00:09:01,173
Chords aren't quite figured out, but notes

159
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:03,533
and their relative positions are a little bit easier

160
00:09:03,553 --> 00:09:04,773
to understand in this way.

161
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:08,233
This video gave us a little bit more confidence

162
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:09,773
coming towards the next period.

163
00:09:10,354 --> 00:09:13,675
In fact, with this, we were able to work with management

164
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:15,055
and senior developers in the company

165
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,136
to come up with our minimum goals and constraints

166
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:17,656
for the system.

167
00:09:18,136 --> 00:09:20,317
Pro Guitar had to display notes and chords on the track.

168
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:21,897
It had to be pitch accurate, means

169
00:09:22,297 --> 00:09:23,378
you never play the wrong note.

170
00:09:23,398 --> 00:09:24,558
We want to teach people the right thing.

171
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:27,659
It had to target non-musician rock band players,

172
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,220
as Jason said before, people that were looking

173
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,860
for a new challenge.

174
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,761
It didn't necessarily have to work with bass.

175
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,522
It didn't necessarily have to work with all the Rock Band 3 songs.

176
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:38,643
We were targeting maybe, say, 20 of the 80.

177
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:41,925
And it didn't have to work in all game modes.

178
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:43,927
It could be its own menu option off the main screen,

179
00:09:44,187 --> 00:09:44,888
if we needed it to be.

180
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:49,351
So, our takeaway here is,

181
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:52,813
when we had low resources,

182
00:09:53,434 --> 00:09:55,955
we used whatever we could to actually learn about the problem space.

183
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:57,897
You know, getting things in the game is always best.

184
00:09:58,337 --> 00:10:00,058
But if we can't, we like video.

185
00:10:00,554 --> 00:10:03,876
And pictures and text are also useful to find more information.

186
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:07,958
So the next period we're going to talk about is the prototyping period.

187
00:10:08,338 --> 00:10:10,940
This lasted for about seven months of the almost two-year period.

188
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:15,943
So the problem space here is we need to iterate really fast.

189
00:10:16,003 --> 00:10:17,604
We want to get things in the game to try it.

190
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,966
And we had a large group, and when you have a large group,

191
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,968
there's a lot of disagreements about what you want to try and get in the game first.

192
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:27,471
So one of the first things Dan did as strike leader at this point in time

193
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:29,872
was reduce this group to a smaller size.

194
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:35,971
We added Jason Booth and Mike Monselvatch, as Jason was our coder on the team.

195
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:39,753
Jason is a multi-talented coder that can do anything we needed him to do.

196
00:10:40,093 --> 00:10:44,455
Jason can do graphics, gameplay, menu work, and Mike is similar as an artist.

197
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:47,996
He can do 2D, 3D. These guys can do tons of iteration really fast.

198
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:54,579
So, I went into this a little bit already.

199
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:58,441
The best part of SmallStrike Team is the implementers are the people doing the work.

200
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,212
Jason and Mike are able to do all that.

201
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:03,773
I was able to contribute wherever I can,

202
00:11:04,553 --> 00:11:06,914
whether it's meeting notes or lesson designs or song ideas

203
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:08,695
or art mock-ups.

204
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:12,837
Another thing is we were able to have more focused meetings.

205
00:11:12,857 --> 00:11:14,957
We'd get things in the game, meet about it right away,

206
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:16,618
and decide a course of action after that.

207
00:11:17,058 --> 00:11:19,099
You know, if we didn't decide on a course of action,

208
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,600
a lot of times our philosophy is, like,

209
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,460
just try the fastest solution,

210
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,761
and we'll learn something about it.

211
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:27,062
We also were able to sit closer to each other

212
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:28,002
with a smaller Strike team.

213
00:11:29,145 --> 00:11:32,027
Jason sat really close to Mike, like three desks away.

214
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:34,088
And later in production, I moved into the room

215
00:11:34,108 --> 00:11:34,988
with the coders on the team.

216
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:37,170
One thing I forgot to mention is,

217
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,211
in case you're not familiar with the term Strike Team,

218
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:42,092
it's kind of like Scrum, although our version

219
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:44,714
was a little bit less strict than Scrum.

220
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:46,755
But you can imagine it's a group of people

221
00:11:46,795 --> 00:11:48,536
focused on a feature like Music Library,

222
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:51,317
or in our case, Pro Guitar, Pro Keys, stuff like that.

223
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:57,269
All right, so now I'm going to talk a bit about how we actually went about prototyping this

224
00:11:57,809 --> 00:11:59,850
and coming up with the various design solutions we did.

225
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:05,495
So the first thing that we noticed, you know, we rolled onto the project and there were

226
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:08,837
all these mockups and stuff, but we didn't really have any hardware.

227
00:12:09,758 --> 00:12:13,440
And I kind of looked out into the landscape of, you know, possible solutions for getting

228
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,302
data out of a guitar and getting that as MIDI or something like that.

229
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:19,485
And all of these solutions have various problems.

230
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,186
For one, they're all pretty expensive.

231
00:12:21,904 --> 00:12:23,886
They have latency, they have accuracy problems.

232
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:25,927
There's all these different types of issues.

233
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:31,653
And rather than try to tackle any of these things right away, we basically just decided,

234
00:12:31,673 --> 00:12:35,296
you know what, we're going to use whatever works best, not worry about it right now,

235
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:40,000
and we'll use the information we gather to inform our hardware department of what we

236
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,721
need out of a guitar.

237
00:12:41,782 --> 00:12:45,625
Now, I have to point out that building hardware is not exactly an easy process.

238
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:47,827
It's very complex, very risky.

239
00:12:48,547 --> 00:12:51,469
So, you know, if we could have done this by just plugging in a guitar,

240
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,991
it would have been our priority.

241
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:59,015
But for now, what we did was use some off-the-shelf stuff to figure out what we really needed.

242
00:13:00,036 --> 00:13:02,298
And so the first question that I set out to answer is,

243
00:13:02,418 --> 00:13:04,600
okay, how are we going to communicate what to play to the player?

244
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,582
You know, they may not know anything about music notation,

245
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:10,364
and that's really kind of the crux of...

246
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:13,609
You know, the first half of the game is communicating to the player.

247
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:19,991
So for this, we decided to take sort of a Montessori approach, which is, you know, in

248
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:23,872
Montessori, you know, kids are basically playing with models and various things, and they're

249
00:13:23,892 --> 00:13:27,394
learning a lot from this, and they're learning actual, you know, sort of factual things,

250
00:13:27,454 --> 00:13:29,014
but not in a very direct way.

251
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:32,716
And so our thinking here was like, if we can get your hands into the right position, if

252
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:35,957
we can get you to play a G chord, then it doesn't really matter whether you understand,

253
00:13:36,297 --> 00:13:38,498
you know, that that's a G chord or know any music theory about it.

254
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:40,478
It's just about getting your hands to do the right thing.

255
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:47,041
And so that was really our focus, is like, let's get their muscle memory built up, let's get them doing the right thing and not worry about anything else.

256
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:51,503
Now we wouldn't present anything wrong, but you know, we would just focus on that.

257
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:58,305
So I started thinking about this idea of like, okay, we're going to need to notate this to the player, and I started looking at traditional notation.

258
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:05,708
And traditional notation is kind of interesting because it was designed for conductors who had to fit an entire orchestra onto a page.

259
00:14:06,828 --> 00:14:10,209
And to do this, they came up with various forms of compression to fit everything onto a page.

260
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,351
And one of these is the idea of key signature, which is that

261
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,552
the player has some knowledge of which notes

262
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:19,994
are going to be played within a possibility space.

263
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:22,656
And then you don't have to notate that stuff.

264
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:24,597
And I was like, oh, that's kind of interesting.

265
00:14:24,637 --> 00:14:27,018
Kind of what we're facing is a compression problem, right?

266
00:14:27,038 --> 00:14:28,879
Like, how do we take all this information

267
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:31,900
and get somebody to recognize it right away?

268
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:35,262
Now, most guitar players don't actually even read traditional notation.

269
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:38,373
or at least not very well, they tend to read tablature a lot.

270
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,755
The reason is, is tablature is physically centric.

271
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:42,557
It tells you exactly where to put your hands.

272
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:45,519
On a guitar, you can actually play the same note in multiple places.

273
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,282
So tablature is a way to say,

274
00:14:48,342 --> 00:14:50,243
look, put your hand exactly on the twelfth fret.

275
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:53,026
But it has other problems.

276
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:54,327
It doesn't work with chords very well.

277
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:55,228
It's kind of hard to read.

278
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:57,570
When you get a lot of stuff, it doesn't represent rhythm well.

279
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:01,293
And so there's actually a third type of notation that guitar players use,

280
00:15:01,313 --> 00:15:02,133
which is chord charts.

281
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:05,708
These are great because they show you kind of a layout of what your hand's supposed to do,

282
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:07,489
but they only really work for chords.

283
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,372
So, often you find guitar notation is written in these three different forms, sometimes all at once.

284
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:17,814
And there's no way we can really ask people to learn all these three notation systems,

285
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:23,097
or, you know, understand them in real time.

286
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:27,619
And so we knew right off the bat we were going to have to invent some new form of music notation.

287
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,341
And what we wanted was something which was physically centric, like a tablature is.

288
00:15:32,225 --> 00:15:37,727
But it would need to have some form of compression for dealing with chords and sort of complex musical passages.

289
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:45,009
And we knew from our experience with Rock Band and Guitar Hero that we had a very good concept of time to give the users.

290
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:50,811
So I started thinking a lot about the chord problem and sort of what I was doing when I was playing a chord.

291
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:56,433
And I started thinking about a D chord. And I'm like, wait a minute, a D chord kind of makes this shape, right?

292
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:01,055
With my hands, I'm making this shape. So maybe if we took that and we actually...

293
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:05,058
You know, map shapes into gems that would come down the track,

294
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:08,260
then the player who had already seen these shapes would be able to recognize them.

295
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,343
And so when you see different chords mapped out like this,

296
00:16:12,423 --> 00:16:14,844
Mike would sort of, you know, sketch these things out,

297
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:18,467
and it was like, oh, okay, I can see a unique signature for each one of these.

298
00:16:18,507 --> 00:16:20,128
I can see how all these chords look different.

299
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:24,491
Additionally, when we started messing around with, like, variations,

300
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,733
like, these are all different variations of major, minor, A chords,

301
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:30,235
they actually all produce unique shape signatures.

302
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:32,783
So when we started messing with this, we thought, you know,

303
00:16:32,903 --> 00:16:37,085
this might be kind of the key for compressing all this information down for the user.

304
00:16:39,006 --> 00:16:43,249
So we also started thinking, OK, well, I can play the same chord in multiple places

305
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:44,529
when you think about it as a shape.

306
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,751
And so we're going to have to number that somehow

307
00:16:47,851 --> 00:16:49,812
to let the player know where to anchor that chord.

308
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,215
And, you know, we were also looking at music in general.

309
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:56,336
There's all these other opportunities for compression, right?

310
00:16:56,896 --> 00:17:01,278
Music tends to repeat a lot, so you're going to have that sort of compression of repeating riffs.

311
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:05,601
There's various playing styles of, you know, strumming the guitar loosely like Bob Dylan.

312
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:09,223
You know, you don't necessarily need to notate every note in that.

313
00:17:09,243 --> 00:17:12,325
You just need to notate, okay, he's playing this chord and here's the rhythm he's playing.

314
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:14,246
And then there are things like arpeggios.

315
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:18,829
And all an arpeggio is, is it's a chord that's played one note at a time instead of all together.

316
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:21,551
So we're looking at these things and, you know, my basic thought was

317
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:25,773
there's a lot of opportunities for sort of compression within our notation here.

318
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:28,823
And Mike would sketch some of these out.

319
00:17:28,863 --> 00:17:31,605
Like here's an example of, you know, how we might represent arpeggios,

320
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:34,507
which is pretty close to what we finally shipped.

321
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:37,289
And so here we have essentially a D chord,

322
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:40,291
and then we're just sort of lightly notating which strings to pluck when.

323
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:44,234
We even played with things like changing the plane that these exist on

324
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:46,676
to sort of create mode switches in the player's head.

325
00:17:49,117 --> 00:17:52,720
So, you know, while we were thinking about all this stuff,

326
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:56,583
we still had some sort of lingering questions that have been coming up.

327
00:17:57,531 --> 00:18:02,833
One of the things for me was, you know, we dismissed string, sorry, fret relative and

328
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:07,014
sort of decided that, you know, we had this chord language and this string relative system

329
00:18:07,034 --> 00:18:11,056
to work with, but we still had this question of, like, horizontal versus our perspective

330
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:12,376
track like we have in our games.

331
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:16,698
And my initial thinking on this was, hey, you know, all music notation is horizontal.

332
00:18:16,758 --> 00:18:17,658
You read horizontal.

333
00:18:17,978 --> 00:18:21,459
There's got to be something about that that's actually better for people.

334
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:24,960
And when I made the first version of the prototype...

335
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:29,366
I made it visually agnostic so we could sort of plug in new models and then just see how

336
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:29,826
they worked.

337
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:32,267
And this is an example of the horizontal one.

338
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:36,028
And it broke down right away for a couple major reasons.

339
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:41,391
One is that when things are scrolling horizontally or on any flat plane, they're going to move

340
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:44,512
many more pixels per frame than when they're coming at you.

341
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:48,153
They tend to move in very small deltas when you consider the pixel motion.

342
00:18:48,914 --> 00:18:51,735
So it's actually easier to read details on them when they're coming at you.

343
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:55,849
And additionally, this idea of this chord shape language just broke down in a horizontal mode.

344
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:59,311
You can see Mike was working various sketches trying to figure this out.

345
00:19:00,212 --> 00:19:01,973
But there just wasn't really a great way to do it.

346
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:06,336
So, as we got the prototype up, I needed some songs.

347
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:11,000
And, you know, when people talk about prototyping a lot of times...

348
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:14,604
You'll hear them say you have to tackle all your hard problems first,

349
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:17,126
because otherwise you'll never get to them or whatever.

350
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:18,947
And I think that there's some truth in it,

351
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:23,310
but I think you have to make sure you don't just do those things.

352
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,712
I think sometimes you need a prototype to build momentum for your project, right?

353
00:19:26,952 --> 00:19:29,914
You need to build some success to get other people bought in,

354
00:19:29,954 --> 00:19:31,575
to get them psyched up about what you're doing.

355
00:19:32,496 --> 00:19:37,099
So when it came to song selection, which is really a core component of what we do,

356
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:39,676
I chose songs that were definitely going to work.

357
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:41,697
They were going to be easy enough to play for a new player.

358
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:45,178
They would be simple enough that when you were playing a simplified version of them,

359
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:47,759
you still felt like you were playing the full version.

360
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:51,260
So things like I Love Rock and Roll and Twist of Cain.

361
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,901
Twist of Cain doesn't have any solos in it.

362
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:56,382
It's a really powerful sounding song, but it's actually very, very easy to play.

363
00:19:57,382 --> 00:20:00,983
So rather than jumping right into Crazy Train or something, I sort of focused on these.

364
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:04,171
Additionally, Mike and I just came up with a system.

365
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:09,135
Rather than coming, sort of a convention, to solve the chord gem problem,

366
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:13,058
rather than actually building a system which would graphically build these elements,

367
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,500
he would just model the ones that we needed for a song.

368
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,902
So, you know, I Love Rock and Roll has three chords in it,

369
00:20:18,022 --> 00:20:20,064
so he would go model those chords,

370
00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:22,686
and that saved us from having to solve any of these problems right away.

371
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:29,051
So, at this point, we had a pretty good prototype built.

372
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:36,953
And, you know, had some, some, most of our answers kind of answered here.

373
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:42,036
But we still had a bunch more after this stage, which is things like, you know,

374
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:46,258
okay, great, we have this chord shape language and, you know, I can recognize that that's a D chord,

375
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,319
but if I've never seen it before, I have no idea what it is.

376
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:50,360
So we're going to need to teach that to players.

377
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:55,143
And to translate that shape into something they do with their hand,

378
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:58,325
there's going to be some information we need to give them to walk them through that process

379
00:20:58,345 --> 00:21:00,626
so they can really understand what they're supposed to do with their hand.

380
00:21:01,307 --> 00:21:02,127
from this notation.

381
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,469
And then there's going to be a bunch of other things

382
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:06,211
that you need to really learn a song, right?

383
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,392
It's not just about learning a single chord.

384
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:09,753
It's about learning a song in the end.

385
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:10,654
That's what people want to do.

386
00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:11,655
They want to be able to play a song.

387
00:21:13,556 --> 00:21:15,178
So at first, you know, our attitude was,

388
00:21:15,198 --> 00:21:17,019
wow, we don't want to make a big training,

389
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,340
edutainment program, right?

390
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,901
Like, we want to make something that's fun and exciting.

391
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:22,663
Maybe we can sneak this education in

392
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:24,485
along with our game somehow

393
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:26,907
and inline the training right into the songs.

394
00:21:27,707 --> 00:21:29,269
But this proved really jarring for people.

395
00:21:30,227 --> 00:21:34,169
We tried things like stopping, you know, and sort of bringing up menu displays and stuff.

396
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:40,172
So we switched this model of upfront learning, which is, okay, so I Love Rock and Roll's

397
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:43,854
got three chords in it, so let's make them actually learn those chords one step at a

398
00:21:43,874 --> 00:21:48,277
time and then they'll proceed and actually try to play the song using what they've learned.

399
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:55,341
And as we were mocking this up and implementing it, you know, we kept thinking that we needed

400
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:59,423
this virtual hand, right, that would show the players what their left hand was supposed

401
00:21:59,443 --> 00:21:59,863
to be doing.

402
00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:03,550
But what we found out through playtesting was that nobody actually looked at the hand.

403
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,071
What they really needed to know was just, what is my, you know, what is each finger

404
00:22:08,091 --> 00:22:12,933
supposed to do in simple text, and then some feedback about what their hand was doing.

405
00:22:13,413 --> 00:22:16,774
So in this video, you can see me sliding around my hand and sort of lighting up when I hit

406
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:20,635
the right notes, you know, and telling me whether I'm right or wrong and showing me

407
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:21,496
where my fingers were.

408
00:22:22,536 --> 00:22:28,598
And this sort of proved to be the most valuable part for players actually learning this for

409
00:22:28,618 --> 00:22:29,118
the first time.

410
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:34,747
So we also started prototyping a trainer.

411
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,710
And now, when I think back to learning music,

412
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:38,971
you know, it's not like I...

413
00:22:39,671 --> 00:22:41,733
The first song I learned, I learned it in real time,

414
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:42,954
playing along to the record, right?

415
00:22:43,294 --> 00:22:46,377
I sat and I, like, you know, learned how to play that one chord,

416
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:48,338
and then I figured out what the next three notes were,

417
00:22:48,438 --> 00:22:52,101
and kind of, kind of went in whatever time it took for me to figure that out.

418
00:22:52,442 --> 00:22:55,144
And so we tried to imitate this by having what we called wait mode,

419
00:22:55,564 --> 00:22:58,166
which is where the game would just sort of wait for you to, you know,

420
00:22:58,186 --> 00:23:00,168
get the right answer, and then it would proceed on,

421
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:00,768
and it would bring up...

422
00:23:01,178 --> 00:23:03,500
And this is a video of the prototype running.

423
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,680
So you can see me going through the chord book,

424
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,961
playing the various chords from the song.

425
00:23:31,153 --> 00:23:35,094
And one of the problems that becomes apparent is if you have a lot of chords in the song, it gets really tedious.

426
00:23:36,474 --> 00:23:44,576
And then here's a little clip of the prototype.

427
00:23:45,696 --> 00:23:48,936
And there it's waiting for me because I missed that note.

428
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,798
So yeah, that was kind of where we got to on the prototype.

429
00:23:56,792 --> 00:24:02,837
And we would internally playtest this with various people in the company who had little to no experience.

430
00:24:03,638 --> 00:24:08,001
And we would always ask them, you know, okay, so, you know, at the end of this, we'd be like, well, how fun is this?

431
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:12,525
And they'd sort of look at us weird and be like, I don't know if that's really the right question.

432
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,387
It's super compelling or encouraging or something like that.

433
00:24:15,948 --> 00:24:17,369
They were really excited about the feature.

434
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,333
But at first, they weren't even sure whether fun was really a word that could be applied.

435
00:24:23,197 --> 00:24:27,839
But we sort of believe that, you know, the secret to our success of actually teaching people to play guitar

436
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:32,601
was rooted in that idea that, you know, this could be a fun experience instead of a grueling experience.

437
00:24:33,482 --> 00:24:35,022
And so we kept working on little details.

438
00:24:36,263 --> 00:24:37,303
So like one of these details,

439
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:40,765
we kept having this problem of people not knowing what their left hand was doing.

440
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:44,527
When they were, you know, when they had the help up and the guitar was there

441
00:24:44,547 --> 00:24:47,008
and it was showing them exactly what they were doing, the feedback was really good.

442
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:50,890
But we didn't want that up all the time because it was too much information and too distracting.

443
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:57,066
So we kept trying different things, you know, to sort of show them what their left hand was doing in other ways, and sort of failing.

444
00:24:57,086 --> 00:25:02,629
And then one day, I was watching crazy Japanese game shows, and it was the human Tetris wall, right?

445
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:08,032
And the wall's coming towards somebody, has a hole cut in him, and the person has to get into the shape of the hole and get through.

446
00:25:08,052 --> 00:25:11,634
And I was like, you know, that's kind of what we're doing in Inverse, right?

447
00:25:11,694 --> 00:25:16,556
We have a shape coming towards you, and we're asking you to get your hand into that position.

448
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:20,278
So maybe what we can do is sort of generate a wall.

449
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,270
uh, based on what your hand is doing,

450
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,191
and then the shape can slot through that, right?

451
00:25:24,211 --> 00:25:25,212
And it'll give you some feedback.

452
00:25:25,592 --> 00:25:28,614
And that's where this idea of the position wave, uh, sort of started.

453
00:25:31,055 --> 00:25:34,157
So, when the prototyping was coming to a close,

454
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:37,658
um, it was pretty obvious there were some inherent limitations to what we were doing.

455
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,620
Um, you know, our notation system had a lot of up-front learning.

456
00:25:41,761 --> 00:25:44,142
Uh, this chord-shape solution was certainly interesting.

457
00:25:44,562 --> 00:25:44,922
But it didn't...

458
00:25:45,346 --> 00:25:48,690
It didn't work well when you had, you know, songs with lots and lots of

459
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:52,395
complex jazz chords and things like that. It just sort of became hard to read.

460
00:25:53,316 --> 00:25:55,999
We had tons of screen space issues. You could never make the numbers

461
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,882
large enough and things like that.

462
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:01,746
And as a result of all this, some songs would work really well and some songs wouldn't.

463
00:26:02,635 --> 00:26:04,377
And there were still a bunch of problems,

464
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,038
both from the guitar technique standpoint and just

465
00:26:07,439 --> 00:26:09,160
sort of general problems that we wanted to solve.

466
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:11,261
And we sort of realized that, you know,

467
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:13,663
a lot of these problems aren't solvable, right?

468
00:26:13,703 --> 00:26:15,124
They're not totally solvable.

469
00:26:15,144 --> 00:26:16,645
What we can do is chip away at them.

470
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:17,806
We can make them better.

471
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:19,327
We can try to make the learning curve smoother,

472
00:26:19,587 --> 00:26:20,948
but we can't necessarily solve them.

473
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,691
So meanwhile, from all this, we had a pretty good idea

474
00:26:25,712 --> 00:26:26,912
of what we needed out of hardware.

475
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:30,255
And it was pretty apparent at this point that

476
00:26:30,605 --> 00:26:34,046
This idea of knowing what the left hand was doing was really going to be key and we were

477
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,866
going to have to manufacture some type of hardware.

478
00:26:36,487 --> 00:26:39,768
And so really what we wanted was we wanted to know exactly what the left hand was doing.

479
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:41,388
We needed that to be low latency.

480
00:26:41,728 --> 00:26:44,829
We needed it to be very high in accuracy so that players wouldn't get frustrated when

481
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:47,090
they hit a note and it said they didn't or things like that.

482
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,371
And finally it needed to be low cost, right?

483
00:26:49,671 --> 00:26:50,871
And it's a really hard challenge.

484
00:26:53,172 --> 00:26:57,734
So what our hardware team decided to do is sort of go on two directions, right?

485
00:26:57,754 --> 00:26:58,014
So that the- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

486
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:02,680
The real thing we wanted to do was have a real guitar, right?

487
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,240
Like a real Fender guitar you could play,

488
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,861
and you plug it into an amp and it could be real.

489
00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:09,022
But we also realized that there are problems with this.

490
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:10,862
You have additional problems that come into play,

491
00:27:11,482 --> 00:27:13,983
like tuning and string breaking and your hand's hurting.

492
00:27:14,664 --> 00:27:16,644
You know, there's a lot of extra complexity there.

493
00:27:17,564 --> 00:27:18,785
And so for some players, you know,

494
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:21,526
some sort of plastic controller would actually be a lot better,

495
00:27:22,246 --> 00:27:24,767
as long as it was still representational of a real guitar.

496
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:30,186
And on top of that, you know, there was no real known technology to do this with a real guitar,

497
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:32,688
and we had no idea what it was going to cost if we did figure it out.

498
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,189
Whereas, you know, sort of our button approach,

499
00:27:36,629 --> 00:27:39,651
we had a pretty good idea of how that would be built and what it would cost.

500
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:45,233
So, you know, we decided to pursue both of these directions,

501
00:27:47,194 --> 00:27:48,635
and started working with Fender,

502
00:27:49,615 --> 00:27:54,617
and eventually went down there and built a first prototype of this string controller with them.

503
00:27:55,732 --> 00:27:58,913
And it was really exciting because even though the thing only worked up to the fifth fret,

504
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:03,915
to actually like play the game we were building with a real guitar was like a real amazing

505
00:28:03,955 --> 00:28:04,775
moment for all of us.

506
00:28:05,956 --> 00:28:10,578
And so we settled on this two-pronged approach. We were going to have this 22-fret real guitar,

507
00:28:10,618 --> 00:28:14,780
which actually shipped this week. And, you know, you can plug this thing to an amp and

508
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,342
play it. It's 100 percent a real guitar, but you can also play the game with it. And it

509
00:28:19,362 --> 00:28:20,882
doubles as a really amazing MIDI guitar.

510
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:25,104
And then we would have a lower-cost approach, which was this sort of button guitar.

511
00:28:26,425 --> 00:28:29,746
Which we would probably be able to manufacture by the time we ship the game.

512
00:28:30,326 --> 00:28:34,048
And it was a much safer and more cost-effective route for many people.

513
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:40,071
So from this I just wanted to bring up a few sort of prototyping suggestions.

514
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:44,733
Like Sylvan said, I think really reducing the team size down is crucial.

515
00:28:44,773 --> 00:28:51,135
The less people, the less arguments and random discussions you need to have to keep everyone in sync.

516
00:28:51,195 --> 00:28:55,697
So it allows you to move really fast if you can get a very small number of people to prototype a feature.

517
00:28:56,748 --> 00:29:01,191
And really the cycle that I like to think about is, you know, you get together, you come up with these core goals.

518
00:29:01,211 --> 00:29:05,093
Like, what is it you're trying to build and, you know, what is really the, the target audience?

519
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:05,793
Things like that.

520
00:29:06,173 --> 00:29:07,814
And you sort of establish these constraints.

521
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:10,675
And then you just go, you know, hack it in any way you can.

522
00:29:10,755 --> 00:29:13,157
Try all the different variations of things that might work.

523
00:29:13,517 --> 00:29:16,198
And then when you sort of think you have your answer,

524
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:18,199
you put that in front of actual users and you see.

525
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,821
You know, I would have users come in and they would play and they would learn this thing.

526
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:23,142
And then I would give them a real guitar.

527
00:29:23,442 --> 00:29:25,503
And I'd be like, can you play that chord on a real guitar?

528
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:28,913
And they would sort of sheepishly take it, and then when they hit that chord,

529
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:31,838
they had this amazing expression on their face because they'd just learned

530
00:29:32,218 --> 00:29:35,023
how to play something on a guitar, something that seemed impossible to them,

531
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:36,485
you know, from playing this game.

532
00:29:37,326 --> 00:29:38,208
So that was really exciting.

533
00:29:40,007 --> 00:29:41,548
And the other thing is, like, you know,

534
00:29:42,008 --> 00:29:44,190
you're going to have these constant arguments about various features

535
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,971
or different ways you can go with people.

536
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:46,931
And if they keep coming up,

537
00:29:47,271 --> 00:29:48,832
it's a sign that you need to address them.

538
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:49,873
You need to try something.

539
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,895
So we kept having these discussions of fret relative versus string relative

540
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:54,255
and horizontal versus perspective.

541
00:29:54,616 --> 00:29:56,717
And until we actually, like, put those into videos

542
00:29:57,277 --> 00:29:59,298
or, you know, actually put them in the game in some case,

543
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,099
we couldn't really solve those arguments.

544
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:03,521
But as soon as you do, all of those discussions go away.

545
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:04,781
So if it keeps coming up,

546
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:06,482
don't even bother having a discussion.

547
00:30:06,522 --> 00:30:07,563
Just go start implementing it

548
00:30:08,383 --> 00:30:09,404
and figure out what's going on.

549
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:15,092
And then finally, when you're prototyping, you know, a lot of times people are so focused on the problem that they're trying to solve,

550
00:30:15,432 --> 00:30:19,953
that they forget all the little things that make a prototype or a game polished and make it feel good.

551
00:30:20,013 --> 00:30:25,175
And often what happens is when you present this to somebody, all they notice is those things you didn't bother to do, right?

552
00:30:25,235 --> 00:30:28,015
Those little things that you're like, oh, that's easy, we'll get to that later.

553
00:30:28,356 --> 00:30:31,576
Sometimes it's worth spending the time to actually do those things early,

554
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:36,398
because it lets people really get to the meat of your solution and really see what's going on.

555
00:30:39,118 --> 00:30:39,899
All right.

556
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,399
So let's talk about the last period.

557
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:43,139
This is the 13 months of production.

558
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:46,380
At this point, the prototype branch was pretty hacky.

559
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,940
We couldn't keep adding features to it,

560
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,581
and we had to bring it over into the real Rock Band 3 branch.

561
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:54,861
But at some point during the prototype,

562
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:55,801
we got really confident.

563
00:30:57,482 --> 00:30:58,402
You saw the playtest results.

564
00:30:58,422 --> 00:30:59,782
We were really excited about this feature.

565
00:31:00,322 --> 00:31:02,462
And we decided to aim higher than our original goals.

566
00:31:03,603 --> 00:31:06,043
We decided we'd make the system work for guitar and bass

567
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:08,423
for every song on all four difficulty levels.

568
00:31:09,055 --> 00:31:11,637
Um, easy difficulty level would be playable without training.

569
00:31:11,857 --> 00:31:12,537
It would just be notes.

570
00:31:13,218 --> 00:31:16,340
And expert difficulty would be every chord and note in the song.

571
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,541
As crazy as that sounds,

572
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:19,823
even if that's really, really hard for people,

573
00:31:19,903 --> 00:31:21,344
even if the jump from hard to expert

574
00:31:21,784 --> 00:31:23,745
is a little bit higher than it is normally,

575
00:31:23,785 --> 00:31:25,086
we thought that was a good goal.

576
00:31:26,107 --> 00:31:27,928
Um, this would work in all modes in the game.

577
00:31:28,029 --> 00:31:29,990
So you can jump right into quick play

578
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,912
next to two other tracks or three other tracks for seven players.

579
00:31:33,493 --> 00:31:36,435
Um, this feature is the same as every other instrument in the game.

580
00:31:37,223 --> 00:31:39,625
We would do trainers for every song on guitar and bass

581
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:40,886
for four different difficulty levels.

582
00:31:41,587 --> 00:31:43,108
And we'd also do general guitar lessons,

583
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,510
which would teach people actually theory

584
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,951
and things that they would have to learn

585
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:48,752
to play the game at all four difficulty levels.

586
00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:51,995
Which means that although we solved a lot of issues

587
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:52,835
in prototyping,

588
00:31:53,456 --> 00:31:56,358
that we still had a ton of stuff to figure out.

589
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,721
Um, some of the stuff we had to figure out

590
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:01,082
was just rock band standard stuff.

591
00:32:01,102 --> 00:32:02,683
We had to figure out how to make work in this world,

592
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:05,545
like solos and peak states and, um...

593
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:06,562
A

594
00:32:33,502 --> 00:32:35,783
We had a 22-fret guitar and a 17-fret guitar.

595
00:32:35,803 --> 00:32:37,264
How are we going to author differently for those,

596
00:32:37,284 --> 00:32:38,786
and what kind of chord names are we going to put on it?

597
00:32:40,387 --> 00:32:42,388
So, as some of you may know,

598
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:43,949
developing software for emerging hardware

599
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:44,670
can be complicated.

600
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:47,452
This is our case as well.

601
00:32:47,512 --> 00:32:50,114
On the PC, we were using standard mini drivers.

602
00:32:50,814 --> 00:32:53,076
On the consoles, something like that doesn't exist.

603
00:32:53,136 --> 00:32:54,037
It's not that flexible.

604
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:58,020
So here's our timeline for production.

605
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:09,684
So, we had an ambitious plan for our hardware team to go off and make these two hardware versions, which are really exciting to us, but it would take a while and we needed something to develop with so we can answer these questions.

606
00:33:10,764 --> 00:33:19,088
On the left hand side, you can see we had seven of these things we call the bridge modules. These were made by our hardware team. They take MIDI and convert it to a signal that the console can understand.

607
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:25,970
We had seven of these for 180 people. It was just enough for our team to develop with, but it wasn't a lot.

608
00:33:26,495 --> 00:33:27,636
And they were a little idiosyncratic.

609
00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:29,697
Sometimes you'd walk across the floor and static electricity

610
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:31,038
would make you have to reset your console.

611
00:33:31,418 --> 00:33:33,760
But it was just enough for us to get done what we needed.

612
00:33:35,201 --> 00:33:37,002
A few months before we were done finishing the game, we

613
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:38,383
started getting our Mustangs.

614
00:33:38,443 --> 00:33:40,624
You can see we had seven of those on the right.

615
00:33:41,124 --> 00:33:42,365
But the Squire came in even hotter.

616
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:46,267
In fact, four days before E3, we got our first version of

617
00:33:46,307 --> 00:33:47,568
the working Squire guitar.

618
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:51,631
We had an emergency code in there to cheat success if we

619
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:52,231
needed to use it.

620
00:33:53,126 --> 00:33:54,306
I'm happy to say we didn't need to use it.

621
00:33:54,526 --> 00:33:56,247
So you guys saw real playing on stage,

622
00:33:56,287 --> 00:33:58,327
and people were kind of blown away

623
00:33:58,487 --> 00:33:59,628
that it actually worked.

624
00:33:59,888 --> 00:34:00,248
So were we.

625
00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:06,150
Um, second problem, uh, is, uh,

626
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,251
just a simple fact of life

627
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:08,431
when you work on these types of games.

628
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:10,972
Uh, our content, uh, is songs,

629
00:34:11,012 --> 00:34:12,052
and our songs are our levels.

630
00:34:12,312 --> 00:34:13,793
Um, and we get those late sometimes,

631
00:34:13,873 --> 00:34:14,273
a lot of them.

632
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:16,334
Uh, we had to learn about this problem space

633
00:34:16,374 --> 00:34:17,754
before we got our final songs.

634
00:34:17,774 --> 00:34:19,415
This is like working on a shooter,

635
00:34:19,995 --> 00:34:20,135
and...

636
00:34:20,663 --> 00:34:24,345
Not having your levels and your final controller to play them on into the last three months.

637
00:34:24,785 --> 00:34:26,066
You want to learn things before that.

638
00:34:27,147 --> 00:34:32,650
So our solution was our audio designers would make test versions of songs or snippets.

639
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:38,013
They would record them or cut up other songs so that we could learn about as much as we needed to learn about before these final songs came in.

640
00:34:39,694 --> 00:34:45,277
So for our production team, we had a lot of people that actually had played guitar for a long time.

641
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:49,239
And our two audio guys who were making these sample songs...

642
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:51,156
Actually taught guitar for many years.

643
00:34:53,017 --> 00:34:54,758
They would crank out the type of content

644
00:34:54,778 --> 00:34:55,979
we needed to answer questions.

645
00:34:56,779 --> 00:34:59,000
The first thing they would give us is famous guitar songs,

646
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,281
songs that everyone wants to learn, like Smoke on the Water.

647
00:35:01,862 --> 00:35:03,743
Coincidentally, some of those songs that everybody learns,

648
00:35:03,763 --> 00:35:04,723
they only learn the easy part.

649
00:35:04,843 --> 00:35:06,684
They learn da, da, da.

650
00:35:06,924 --> 00:35:08,905
They learn that, but they don't learn the arpeggiated verse

651
00:35:08,925 --> 00:35:10,806
that we'd have to figure out or the crazy solo that

652
00:35:10,846 --> 00:35:11,487
goes on forever.

653
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:13,788
We also got, like Jason mentioned,

654
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:15,969
songs that should work well in our system,

655
00:35:16,009 --> 00:35:17,910
like I Love Rock and Roll, which we had in the prototype

656
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:18,830
and we had in the final game.

657
00:35:19,891 --> 00:35:21,993
Finally, the thing we worked on the most was stuff like

658
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:26,136
songs that would stress the system that normal guitar players would need for all our DLC.

659
00:35:26,197 --> 00:35:28,499
Stuff like arpeggios and alternate tunings,

660
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:31,501
really weird chords, tons of that stuff.

661
00:35:32,602 --> 00:35:34,163
We would have these guys go in and make it, you know.

662
00:35:34,644 --> 00:35:35,685
Early on, we were thinking,

663
00:35:35,805 --> 00:35:38,527
well, core language works pretty well as long as we don't get crazy trained.

664
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:39,628
Then we got crazy trained.

665
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:42,591
So, a quick tangent.

666
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:44,172
It's a video I found on YouTube of someone like,

667
00:35:44,732 --> 00:35:46,914
nailing, you can turn it up a little more,

668
00:35:47,315 --> 00:35:48,516
nailing the tapping solo.

669
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:55,633
I'm sure it got better later. So...

670
00:35:56,013 --> 00:36:00,777
We have to kind of say that, you know, often what we find on YouTube is that people are absolutely insane.

671
00:36:01,037 --> 00:36:03,099
Yeah. A lot better than we thought. It's amazing.

672
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,623
So, having them work ahead allowed us to solidify our authoring this time.

673
00:36:08,663 --> 00:36:13,587
We figured out what we were going to do for Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert on both the instruments, bass and guitar.

674
00:36:14,661 --> 00:36:16,983
We were always going to keep the same hand position for all difficulties.

675
00:36:17,023 --> 00:36:19,764
So if you're playing on the third fret on easy, you're playing on the third fret on expert.

676
00:36:20,644 --> 00:36:24,206
Medium would have a simple variety of chords that we picked out that we thought people could learn.

677
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:29,409
And hard we'd try to make just parsable in real time so you didn't necessarily have to go to our trainers.

678
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:34,272
We also figured out in this period how we're going to author for the 17 versus 22 fret guitar.

679
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:38,094
We also brought in Rick Peckham as a weekly consultant.

680
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:41,275
Rick is chair of guitar at Berklee School of Music in Boston.

681
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:44,926
He brought us a unique perspective and helped keep us honest during this period.

682
00:36:45,906 --> 00:36:50,388
Among other things, Rick came in weekly and helped us with something like chord names.

683
00:36:50,868 --> 00:36:54,630
On the side of the track, we wanted to display the chord name for people who could use that.

684
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:59,452
And we don't have a lot of space, so we kind of had to come up with our own new terminology there.

685
00:36:59,472 --> 00:37:00,972
We wanted to make sure it made the most sense.

686
00:37:01,713 --> 00:37:05,974
And it's also done in code, so our audio guys don't have to author that for every single chord.

687
00:37:07,115 --> 00:37:08,855
He also helped us with trainer lessons.

688
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:10,196
I mentioned this before.

689
00:37:10,657 --> 00:37:13,458
We didn't have our songs yet, but we made educated guesses

690
00:37:13,518 --> 00:37:15,839
about what people would have to learn on Easy, Medium, Hard,

691
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,640
and Expert and started authoring those.

692
00:37:17,721 --> 00:37:19,281
And this was great for a couple reasons.

693
00:37:19,301 --> 00:37:22,583
One is our audio guys spent all their day

694
00:37:22,603 --> 00:37:23,844
analyzing other people's music.

695
00:37:23,864 --> 00:37:26,866
And this was their chance to make music that actually people

696
00:37:26,886 --> 00:37:29,267
would play as lessons and made sense in this context.

697
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,028
And it's also great because people would learn

698
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,429
a little bit of theory, and they could actually

699
00:37:32,629 --> 00:37:34,010
take this to their own guitar lessons later.

700
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,791
So the last problem I'm going to talk about

701
00:37:37,011 --> 00:37:38,552
is our problem of

702
00:37:39,097 --> 00:37:42,220
Going from prototype to production took us a lot longer than we expected.

703
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,703
It was estimated that it would take a couple months to get all the features from the prototype

704
00:37:46,103 --> 00:37:46,524
in the game.

705
00:37:46,884 --> 00:37:50,707
And over five months later, we didn't even have all that stuff into Parody.

706
00:37:52,248 --> 00:37:53,990
So here's a video.

707
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:57,833
If you could turn up the audio, please.

708
00:37:58,293 --> 00:38:01,076
This is the first version working in the game in Quick Play.

709
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:03,798
You can see a lot of prototype graphics in the back.

710
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,460
You can see that.

711
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,461
The notes look OK.

712
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:09,341
They're not quite great.

713
00:38:09,761 --> 00:38:11,241
There's no chord to exist there.

714
00:38:11,682 --> 00:38:13,082
The strings don't have any feedback.

715
00:38:13,162 --> 00:38:14,362
There's no position wave.

716
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:17,963
This doesn't even match the prototype at this stage.

717
00:38:19,844 --> 00:38:21,764
So for prototyping, we had this core group

718
00:38:21,944 --> 00:38:23,325
that were evaluated by a larger group.

719
00:38:24,645 --> 00:38:27,186
When it came time to production, our Strike Team membership

720
00:38:27,226 --> 00:38:27,426
grew.

721
00:38:28,146 --> 00:38:29,406
Jason rolled off from coding duties,

722
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:33,308
and we added a project lead, QA guy, two audio guys,

723
00:38:33,488 --> 00:38:35,788
a producer, and three coders to do the work

724
00:38:35,808 --> 00:38:36,568
that Jason was doing.

725
00:38:37,468 --> 00:38:39,189
This definitely changed the dynamic of the team.

726
00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:44,411
So these new team members weren't around to see the prototype grow and learn the lessons

727
00:38:44,451 --> 00:38:45,031
for themselves.

728
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:49,373
You know, a lot of misunderstandings happen when three coders are trying to get previously

729
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:50,533
one coder's work in the game.

730
00:38:52,994 --> 00:38:56,916
We also had more reliance on external resources even though we had more people.

731
00:38:57,256 --> 00:39:00,717
So if we wanted to get a new menu screen in the game, that might get tasked if it was

732
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:03,658
really big and, you know, held off for a couple weeks.

733
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,552
So this exposed some process problems, this new big group.

734
00:39:09,572 --> 00:39:10,813
So we need to get back on track.

735
00:39:11,854 --> 00:39:14,576
So one of the first things we did to get back on track

736
00:39:14,596 --> 00:39:18,299
was Daniel Sussman reiterated to me our core focus, which

737
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:20,740
was non-guitar players and their ability

738
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,062
to enjoy and play and learn how to play guitar in this game.

739
00:39:23,522 --> 00:39:25,244
There he is over there if you want to kick him in the nuts.

740
00:39:29,006 --> 00:39:31,728
He was so vehement about this that he was willing to even

741
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:32,769
cut hard an expert.

742
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,190
And to us, this was a wake-up call

743
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,492
because we really wanted this to work on all songs.

744
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:39,673
All the way up and be able to teach you everything that the guitar player did.

745
00:39:41,474 --> 00:39:42,715
So it's helped get us back on track.

746
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:45,897
It helped us prioritize our tasks.

747
00:39:46,777 --> 00:39:49,479
You know, if we had to do work for the trainer, check, we'll do that right away.

748
00:39:49,919 --> 00:39:54,682
But arpeggio work and stuff like that, that can wait until after we solve the core problems.

749
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:59,465
We put all these tasks in the schedule, prioritize them, and then our guys would get excited

750
00:39:59,485 --> 00:40:01,386
because we would see all these stuff we wanted to get to.

751
00:40:01,646 --> 00:40:04,288
We knew we had to blow away the other stuff first, so that helped speed us up.

752
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,201
We also switched to more short-term deadlines.

753
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:10,601
We had an alpha date that was many months away.

754
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:12,342
Instead of just relying on that, we actually

755
00:40:12,362 --> 00:40:13,742
set ourselves a new short-term date

756
00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:16,342
that would get all the features in in a month and a half.

757
00:40:16,722 --> 00:40:18,543
And then we pushed up our external playtest

758
00:40:18,563 --> 00:40:20,523
so we could actually find out this information sooner.

759
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:23,844
The result of these changes was the next four months

760
00:40:24,204 --> 00:40:26,444
were the most productive for our period in production.

761
00:40:27,744 --> 00:40:30,545
We were now actually back on track and ready to playtest.

762
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:32,125
We wanted to know, did we nail this stuff?

763
00:40:32,715 --> 00:40:35,216
We're lucky enough at Harmonics to have a really great playtest department.

764
00:40:36,076 --> 00:40:38,317
It could be a subject for a whole talk about how to run a good one of these,

765
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,577
and we don't have time for that.

766
00:40:39,977 --> 00:40:42,638
But we think it's important enough that if you don't have a playtesting department,

767
00:40:42,658 --> 00:40:44,979
at least find someone that you can to own the process.

768
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:47,000
It's a really big part of what we do.

769
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:50,001
Our playtest questions at this point are,

770
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:52,282
are trainers as effective as they need to be?

771
00:40:53,722 --> 00:40:55,723
What info do we need in our video tutorials, if any?

772
00:40:56,523 --> 00:40:58,504
Previous Rockman games had relied a lot on videos.

773
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:04,060
What happens when players don't use the tutorials and trainers and jump right into Quick Play and just start playing?

774
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,921
You know, this is a bad case scenario for us, but we wanted to test it because we knew we'd learn a lot of things.

775
00:41:08,442 --> 00:41:12,843
And, you know, I suggest doing that for your games, you know, have people skip cut scenes and skip all the trainers and just see what happens.

776
00:41:14,284 --> 00:41:17,685
Finally, can players learn how to play guitar through Rock Band 3?

777
00:41:19,005 --> 00:41:20,646
So, here we are, a few months before.

778
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:23,027
We can turn this up a little bit more.

779
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:27,068
You can see the track here is actually somewhat close to what we shipped.

780
00:41:28,793 --> 00:41:32,195
The numbers on the single note gems are smaller than ideal,

781
00:41:32,255 --> 00:41:33,656
and we pumped that up after this.

782
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:35,236
The position may have changed a little,

783
00:41:35,256 --> 00:41:36,277
but that was pretty close.

784
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:38,278
And here you can see the chord book

785
00:41:38,298 --> 00:41:39,258
that Jason was talking about

786
00:41:39,338 --> 00:41:40,799
actually in action in the real game.

787
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,539
We beefed it up a little bit

788
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:44,160
so players would have to play chords three times

789
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,941
because they weren't getting good feedback without that.

790
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:49,142
But what we found out is with real lessons and real songs,

791
00:41:49,162 --> 00:41:50,223
when we divided up the songs...

792
00:41:51,018 --> 00:41:53,659
but players would take a long time to learn these chords.

793
00:41:53,779 --> 00:41:56,241
And by the time they actually learned them all and got into the trainers,

794
00:41:56,621 --> 00:41:57,741
they had forgotten what they'd done.

795
00:42:00,003 --> 00:42:01,523
That was the first major problem.

796
00:42:01,824 --> 00:42:04,445
The other issues were smaller but consistent.

797
00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:07,306
On the right-hand side, you see this thing we call the jam highway,

798
00:42:07,427 --> 00:42:09,187
which is a preview of all the stuff you have to play.

799
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:10,528
Players would just stare at that.

800
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,750
They had no idea what it did, and it just distracted them.

801
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:16,972
Additionally, we made a classic mistake of separating our elements

802
00:42:17,032 --> 00:42:19,653
for how you switch lessons in the upper right-hand side.

803
00:42:20,033 --> 00:42:20,473
And in the...

804
00:42:20,856 --> 00:42:23,498
lower middle side, how you speed up and down the track.

805
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,181
Finally, as you saw there, our success feedback

806
00:42:26,201 --> 00:42:26,981
was pretty underwhelming.

807
00:42:28,703 --> 00:42:32,766
So we got a lot of little issues that we

808
00:42:32,806 --> 00:42:33,827
needed to solve out of this.

809
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:36,810
And our trainer needed to be rethought.

810
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,832
Teaching the chords beforehand wasn't working as well

811
00:42:38,852 --> 00:42:39,512
as we wanted it to.

812
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:43,335
But people were really learning how to play guitar.

813
00:42:43,996 --> 00:42:46,418
Within an hour, we had people that had no guitar experience,

814
00:42:46,498 --> 00:42:48,480
and they were moving power chords around and playing

815
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:48,920
really well.

816
00:42:49,453 --> 00:42:50,113
And this was great.

817
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:53,855
Like, all of our people on our strike team went to the playtest and got to see this.

818
00:42:53,895 --> 00:42:57,497
And we got really pumped up to actually finish off the game really well by seeing how well

819
00:42:57,517 --> 00:42:57,958
we were doing.

820
00:42:58,558 --> 00:43:03,941
And we knew we just had to nail those last issues with those core audience people before

821
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,101
we can get to our wish list items.

822
00:43:05,562 --> 00:43:10,524
So some of that response was, first thing we did, maybe a day or two after the first

823
00:43:10,585 --> 00:43:12,666
external playtest was add a number to the position wave.

824
00:43:12,986 --> 00:43:14,967
This tells you what your left hand is doing at any time.

825
00:43:16,008 --> 00:43:17,728
I had a sneaky suspicion we should try this for a while.

826
00:43:17,748 --> 00:43:18,689
But it wasn't until we saw.

827
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:22,552
Like newbie players actually wanting more information about where their hand was that

828
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:23,752
we actually added this to the game.

829
00:43:25,834 --> 00:43:30,136
Finally we eliminated the chord book and actually brought it directly in to the training.

830
00:43:30,637 --> 00:43:35,239
So players could at their own volition decide when they wanted to turn it on and learn the

831
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,441
chord right then at any time as opposed to doing it all front loaded.

832
00:43:39,422 --> 00:43:42,524
If you go to see the Dance Central talk, which I highly recommend later, you'll see that

833
00:43:42,544 --> 00:43:46,366
they kind of wind up with similar spot in their actual production of their game.

834
00:43:47,747 --> 00:43:49,108
Also, we did a better layout here.

835
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:52,410
You can see on the left-hand side, all the elements for speeding up and slowing down

836
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:56,672
and changing which lesson you're on and the progress are all in the same spot.

837
00:43:58,754 --> 00:44:03,117
So after solving those issues by iterating and re-verifying via further external play

838
00:44:03,137 --> 00:44:06,339
tests, we were able to get to a ton of polish and wish list items.

839
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:07,699
This is just some of them.

840
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,421
I'm going to talk about a little bit here.

841
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:12,903
This first slide shows you some stuff.

842
00:44:13,863 --> 00:44:15,024
What I want to really mention here is...

843
00:44:15,482 --> 00:44:19,822
When I first came to Harmonics, I was really surprised by how much polish went into the tiny elements of the game.

844
00:44:19,842 --> 00:44:21,743
I'm just going to talk about one tiny little example here.

845
00:44:22,503 --> 00:44:27,864
So, for a series of repeated chords, you can see it from the old prototype video,

846
00:44:28,804 --> 00:44:30,864
we would have names for every single chord,

847
00:44:31,204 --> 00:44:34,945
and it would be kind of intimidating and hard to tell when your chord changed.

848
00:44:35,525 --> 00:44:41,486
So, one of the first things we did is do a little bright highlight on the first chord in a series of chords.

849
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:43,847
So, every time the chord changed, you would see a little bit of a pop.

850
00:44:44,587 --> 00:44:49,090
And we eliminated the chord name next to the chord of anything but the very first chord.

851
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:54,275
Doing that, of course, meant that after the very first chord, it would scroll off screen.

852
00:44:54,715 --> 00:44:58,939
So what we did was we locked it into place until that series of chords is gone.

853
00:44:59,259 --> 00:45:04,483
So if you do use the chord name, then it doesn't go away and you know a series of 50 chords

854
00:45:04,543 --> 00:45:05,344
is still this chord.

855
00:45:06,865 --> 00:45:09,648
At this time, we were also able to get in a ton of our wishlist items.

856
00:45:09,788 --> 00:45:10,748
Here's just a small sample.

857
00:45:11,189 --> 00:45:13,691
We finally nailed the arpeggio look and got it working in the game.

858
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,021
We got guitar techniques such as slides up and down the neck

859
00:45:17,101 --> 00:45:19,041
and muted notes, which are just playing

860
00:45:19,081 --> 00:45:19,961
without actually fretting.

861
00:45:21,422 --> 00:45:23,762
And hammer-ons and pull-offs and tons more.

862
00:45:24,162 --> 00:45:26,923
One last example was this idea of being

863
00:45:26,943 --> 00:45:28,723
able to turn on the chord numbering

864
00:45:28,803 --> 00:45:29,883
option in the modifiers.

865
00:45:31,344 --> 00:45:32,364
We'd wanted to do this for months,

866
00:45:32,404 --> 00:45:34,504
and we had it kind of working, but there was actually

867
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:36,585
a rendering bug that didn't let us get to this

868
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:37,625
until the very last day.

869
00:45:38,245 --> 00:45:40,645
And with a lot of begging on my part for the producers,

870
00:45:40,765 --> 00:45:41,645
we actually got this in.

871
00:45:43,806 --> 00:45:43,926
So.

872
00:45:44,861 --> 00:45:48,244
Our summary here is, when we go from prototype to production,

873
00:45:48,524 --> 00:45:49,505
it always takes us a lot longer.

874
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:51,907
We haven't quite nailed it, but for this project,

875
00:45:53,908 --> 00:45:54,829
we did a couple techniques.

876
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,531
For one, we used placeholder content

877
00:45:58,532 --> 00:46:00,233
for being able to rapidly develop.

878
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:02,555
We learned a lot from these MP3s,

879
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:04,897
and we learned a lot about the space,

880
00:46:04,937 --> 00:46:06,739
just like we did earlier on with the pictures and the video.

881
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,402
We revisited our target audience,

882
00:46:10,442 --> 00:46:11,743
and that helped our team.

883
00:46:12,846 --> 00:46:17,629
realign on the core goals that we should really be working on before we think of the bigger issues, or the smaller issues.

884
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:23,793
And finally, short term deadlines helped us get our work done faster as people wanted to see the results of that work,

885
00:46:24,374 --> 00:46:26,155
especially stuff like external play tests.

886
00:46:27,476 --> 00:46:31,539
So, we're really happy with the response from Pro Guitar and Rock Band 3.

887
00:46:32,419 --> 00:46:35,842
We see a lot of people enjoying it and learning how to play guitar and going out and taking lessons.

888
00:46:36,602 --> 00:46:38,303
I'd like to thank everybody at Harmonix for...

889
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:41,452
This feature, there's a lot of people that worked on this really hard.

890
00:46:41,872 --> 00:46:43,893
And I want to thank all of you for coming to our talk.

891
00:46:44,673 --> 00:46:48,115
And please fill out your forms and we'll take questions now.

892
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:49,075
Thanks.

893
00:46:49,335 --> 00:46:50,196
Do you want to roll the video?

894
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:50,616
Yeah.

895
00:46:56,498 --> 00:46:58,879
So, while we take questions, we're going to run this video.

896
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,301
This is like from prototype to the end, you know, I love rock and roll in this series

897
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:07,443
of time-lapse photography here.

898
00:47:17,934 --> 00:47:18,174
Howdy.

899
00:47:18,734 --> 00:47:19,054
Hey.

900
00:47:20,915 --> 00:47:21,135
Hey.

901
00:47:21,315 --> 00:47:23,916
Were you working with the Pro Drums and Pro Keys teams at all?

902
00:47:24,696 --> 00:47:28,597
And was there any temptation to try and create a unified visual style

903
00:47:28,617 --> 00:47:29,297
for the three of them?

904
00:47:30,257 --> 00:47:33,098
Yeah, I worked on the Pro Drums and Pro Keys team.

905
00:47:33,638 --> 00:47:35,799
The Pro Drums is probably the easiest problem.

906
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:37,859
We kind of actually nailed that right away.

907
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,580
We wanted kind of the circle symbol gems.

908
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,141
And we just got a look for that, and it kind of just worked right off the bat.

909
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:45,442
Pro Keys is a.

910
00:47:45,884 --> 00:47:50,627
Very different problem, and it required very different solutions for a ton of reasons.

911
00:47:51,707 --> 00:47:57,871
There was no real desire to try to solve that problem at the same time or in the same way,

912
00:47:57,911 --> 00:48:01,552
just because we knew that they were just going to come up with different issues.

913
00:48:01,572 --> 00:48:04,334
So I was on both teams, but most of the teams were separated.

914
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:06,115
And we developed it separately.

915
00:48:06,735 --> 00:48:09,857
Yeah, I picked up real drumming after playing a whole bunch of rock band

916
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:11,298
and did my first show in December.

917
00:48:11,898 --> 00:48:12,818
So that's pretty awesome.

918
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:13,859
Cool. Thanks a lot, man.

919
00:48:17,807 --> 00:48:18,007
Howdy.

920
00:48:18,487 --> 00:48:18,627
Hi.

921
00:48:18,927 --> 00:48:23,631
I'm just curious about the decision to ship the games on a separate date from the Squire

922
00:48:23,671 --> 00:48:27,914
guitar which just came out this week and how that impacts, how you see it impacting your

923
00:48:28,495 --> 00:48:30,476
sales and reach of this great platform.

924
00:48:31,637 --> 00:48:32,778
Could you repeat the question on the ladder please?

925
00:48:33,058 --> 00:48:33,559
Sorry.

926
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:38,202
I was curious to understand the rationale and decision making behind the fact that the

927
00:48:38,242 --> 00:48:43,106
game launched several months ago and the Squire guitar controller just launched this week

928
00:48:43,206 --> 00:48:43,286
and...

929
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,101
How that distance in time kind of affects the sales and reach

930
00:48:47,221 --> 00:48:48,141
of this great platform.

931
00:48:49,161 --> 00:48:49,861
How it affected what?

932
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:52,122
How it affects the reach and kind of just the fact

933
00:48:52,142 --> 00:48:53,862
that, you know, are people still going to pick it up now

934
00:48:53,902 --> 00:48:55,502
that it's an older game versus, you know,

935
00:48:55,522 --> 00:48:56,843
something that came out today.

936
00:48:56,863 --> 00:48:57,783
I can't hear you at all.

937
00:48:58,263 --> 00:48:58,543
Sorry.

938
00:48:58,703 --> 00:48:59,803
I'm sorry.

939
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:03,104
I think you're asking about how, since the Squire came out

940
00:49:03,124 --> 00:49:05,364
later, how did that affect the reach of the game?

941
00:49:05,644 --> 00:49:05,844
Yes.

942
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:08,205
I think there's a lot of people actually excited

943
00:49:08,265 --> 00:49:09,305
about the Squire Guitar.

944
00:49:09,645 --> 00:49:11,925
A lot of people, I think, were surprised by how.

945
00:49:13,065 --> 00:49:15,566
Good. The button guitar actually felt like I was.

946
00:49:15,626 --> 00:49:18,287
I was a big proponent of, I didn't even really care so much about that one.

947
00:49:18,307 --> 00:49:21,468
But then, now that I got it at home, it has a lot of advantages.

948
00:49:22,068 --> 00:49:25,249
It's really easy to just take apart and throw away and bring it to your friend's house.

949
00:49:25,269 --> 00:49:25,969
It's a lot cheaper.

950
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:31,691
So, I think, I don't know, for us, I think we would ideally like to have the string guitar sooner.

951
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:34,712
But, I think it's worked out well. I think people are going to enjoy both of them actually.

952
00:49:37,093 --> 00:49:37,353
Thank you.

953
00:49:39,214 --> 00:49:42,615
So, I haven't played the pro guitar, but one thing I noticed...

954
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:49,974
That was disconcerting about the Pro Keys was the lack of auditory feedback about my mistakes.

955
00:49:50,194 --> 00:49:53,915
And I see here, you know, there's a lot of visual feedback about what you're doing,

956
00:49:54,095 --> 00:49:58,736
but did you have the same issue about audible feedback for mistakes?

957
00:49:58,756 --> 00:50:04,718
Yeah, we actually had a lot of discussions about that earlier on, and we sort of made a decision.

958
00:50:05,498 --> 00:50:11,001
The first thing you want to do is to get the output from the keyboard to go somewhere and have it amplified.

959
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:14,722
You can do the same thing with the Fender guitar, so you can actually have both.

960
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:34,135
The fear going into it was that, you know, the first time somebody actually plays something

961
00:50:34,575 --> 00:50:37,559
on an instrument, it sounds really bad, right?

962
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:41,744
And that that is so detrimental to so many people that that's why they never play an

963
00:50:41,764 --> 00:50:42,164
instrument.

964
00:50:42,324 --> 00:50:43,586
They just instantly assume they suck.

965
00:50:43,646 --> 00:50:46,790
So we wanted to create that illusion to get them over that hump.

966
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:50,534
And later on, as they start to play on a real instrument and stuff, they'll figure those

967
00:50:50,574 --> 00:50:50,935
things out.

968
00:50:51,795 --> 00:50:53,476
Yeah, I definitely wouldn't want it as the default.

969
00:50:53,937 --> 00:51:01,363
Yeah, I mean, some of our guys have actually like, gone through things to hook it up so they can hear themselves as well, and you know, it's certainly fun that way too.

970
00:51:01,563 --> 00:51:04,446
Yeah, my first six months of playing guitar, I sounded really, really bad.

971
00:51:05,086 --> 00:51:06,988
You didn't want to be there. You didn't want to hear that.

972
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:14,835
Hi. During the prototype phase, you mentioned that you didn't have any hardware until relatively late.

973
00:51:15,536 --> 00:51:18,598
So during that prototype phase, what did you kind of use to...

974
00:51:19,354 --> 00:51:22,156
Try and develop solutions to the problems that you encounter.

975
00:51:22,656 --> 00:51:28,839
We basically would just buy anything we could that would work in the context of the problem we were trying to solve.

976
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,181
So did you have actual input into the game with that?

977
00:51:32,221 --> 00:51:34,403
Yeah, we had actual input, but we had all kinds of things.

978
00:51:34,683 --> 00:51:39,045
I even plugged a keyboard in just to check the beat match at one point.

979
00:51:39,506 --> 00:51:40,446
It's one of those things, right?

980
00:51:40,826 --> 00:51:47,590
You don't have the final hardware, but you find things and you figure out how to figure out these problems ahead of time.

981
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:48,391
Just use whatever we could.

982
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:56,471
And then, so for the Squire guitar, does it actually listen to the pitch of the note, or is there something else going on?

983
00:51:56,491 --> 00:52:03,013
No, it senses what your hands do. It does not, it does, you'll notice in those videos that, um, or if you, it's like the button guitar is, right?

984
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:08,014
If you push a fret down, it knows you pushed that fret down before you pluck any string or anything like that.

985
00:52:08,574 --> 00:52:14,235
Um, you know, there's a lot of attempts at audio analysis and all kinds of interesting things. Um, that's...

986
00:52:15,152 --> 00:52:19,435
It's you get a lot of latency from that and you get a lot of a lot of other issues of accuracy and things so

987
00:52:19,975 --> 00:52:24,158
We had we couldn't get any of those solutions to really work for us. So is there any um

988
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:26,639
Does it deal with tuning I guess at all in the game?

989
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:32,223
Does it is tuning agnostic you could have a thing tuned to the most horrible sounding thing and it would still register correctly

990
00:52:32,263 --> 00:52:34,385
That's why you got to use a string mute if you're really badly out of tune

991
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:40,088
Are there so are there songs in the game that use like outside of standard tuning that was addressed ever or no?

992
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:43,571
Did you just you asked about alternate tuning? No, no. Yeah. Yeah

993
00:52:44,185 --> 00:52:46,627
Yeah, I kind of breezed through that in my slides,

994
00:52:46,647 --> 00:52:48,629
but that's one of the problems we had to solve later on,

995
00:52:49,029 --> 00:52:49,670
was alternate tuning.

996
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:52,772
And we decided to pretend that you're in the same tuning

997
00:52:52,792 --> 00:52:54,514
that the guitar player played.

998
00:52:55,094 --> 00:52:56,816
Our general philosophy on all these systems

999
00:52:56,876 --> 00:52:58,657
was, if you're looking down at your hand,

1000
00:52:58,818 --> 00:53:00,399
you're playing it like you're that guy.

1001
00:53:00,539 --> 00:53:02,761
So if you're in drop D tuning, using one finger,

1002
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:03,682
for those of you who know what that is,

1003
00:53:03,922 --> 00:53:05,403
you're going to play it like that guy played it.

1004
00:53:05,764 --> 00:53:07,345
And it's your decision if you want to tune your guitar to

1005
00:53:07,365 --> 00:53:07,525
that.

1006
00:53:07,645 --> 00:53:08,446
It works no matter what.

1007
00:53:08,657 --> 00:53:12,079
So does it tell you that, though, or is it just like play?

1008
00:53:12,219 --> 00:53:12,719
Does it what?

1009
00:53:12,819 --> 00:53:14,100
Does it tell you what tuning you're in?

1010
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:17,442
No, it doesn't tell you what tuning in the game.

1011
00:53:17,462 --> 00:53:18,243
You can look that up, though.

1012
00:53:18,523 --> 00:53:19,063
OK, thanks.

1013
00:53:19,403 --> 00:53:19,703
Thanks.

1014
00:53:22,585 --> 00:53:27,548
So the decision to allow the player to plug into an app

1015
00:53:27,588 --> 00:53:30,090
and play as a real guitar, was that decided early

1016
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:33,252
on in the process, or was that a feature you implemented later?

1017
00:53:34,993 --> 00:53:37,234
Is your question the decision to use a real guitar?

1018
00:53:37,294 --> 00:53:37,795
Was that early on?

1019
00:53:38,202 --> 00:53:42,352
I think the capability to plug into an amp and play as a real guitar.

1020
00:53:42,372 --> 00:53:44,136
I mean, that's what we wanted to...

1021
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:49,139
We wanted people to play on a real guitar.

1022
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:52,220
They don't have fantasies about playing on a more elaborate plastic guitar.

1023
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,181
They have fantasies about playing on a real guitar.

1024
00:53:54,961 --> 00:54:00,464
So, you know, having a guitar that could then plug into an amp was kind of the ideal solution for us.

1025
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:03,505
Now, we didn't know that we'd be able to get that to ever happen.

1026
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:08,187
So we pursued both avenues, and they both ended up with certain advantages.

1027
00:54:16,017 --> 00:54:21,902
When you were working out the notation and how to show these to the player and doing your external play test to see what was more intuitive,

1028
00:54:22,562 --> 00:54:28,427
at what point did you start seeing people transition from, hey, I need to learn this song beforehand and now I can play,

1029
00:54:28,467 --> 00:54:34,912
to start seeing people go, oh, I can actually sight-read these entire chord charts and songs and things like that?

1030
00:54:35,893 --> 00:54:40,857
Yeah, I think for, it really depended on their comfort level and, like, people that,

1031
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:43,582
Played a little guitar, were able to pick it up fairly quickly.

1032
00:54:43,962 --> 00:54:46,745
If you gave them a song that was just CG and D-chords,

1033
00:54:47,205 --> 00:54:51,109
they wouldn't have any problem sight-reading that.

1034
00:54:51,149 --> 00:54:54,853
Single-note runs, things like that, solos, all way harder.

1035
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,001
But so it sort of depends on the song selection and what their experience was.

1036
00:54:59,081 --> 00:55:02,862
Now, for a player who'd never played anything before, it would take a little while.

1037
00:55:02,902 --> 00:55:06,923
But, you know, we would do user testing sessions that would last about an hour.

1038
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:11,064
And in almost every case, you know, you could take the person who'd never played a guitar

1039
00:55:11,084 --> 00:55:12,885
and give them a guitar and get them to play you something.

1040
00:55:13,765 --> 00:55:15,185
Poorly, but, you know, they'd do it.

1041
00:55:15,465 --> 00:55:19,506
I'll say in those short sessions, someone's not going to go from being able to be super proficient.

1042
00:55:20,006 --> 00:55:23,507
But at the company, it took us, once we had a pretty good system...

1043
00:55:24,339 --> 00:55:29,460
We could sight read pretty much all the good guitar players could sight read on hard within like, you know, a couple weeks.

1044
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:38,802
You mentioned it might work, the actual guitar would work well as a good synthesizer.

1045
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:40,823
Could you speak up a little bit louder please?

1046
00:55:41,023 --> 00:55:46,385
You mentioned that the guitar would work out of context as a MIDI guitar of sorts,

1047
00:55:46,905 --> 00:55:50,246
plugged into your regular rig or synthesizer.

1048
00:55:50,266 --> 00:55:51,446
Have you tested this, worked with it?

1049
00:55:52,071 --> 00:55:56,494
It must have, I like the idea of low latency over other synth guitars.

1050
00:55:56,794 --> 00:56:01,117
I fully expect that there's going to be a lot of musicians picking up the Squier because

1051
00:56:01,597 --> 00:56:05,239
it has really incredibly low latency and high accuracy MIDI output.

1052
00:56:05,459 --> 00:56:05,579
Yeah.

1053
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:06,240
That's a good value.

1054
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:11,523
I mean, that could be this other thing that takes off with this for musicians.

1055
00:56:12,283 --> 00:56:13,364
You know, it seems like it could become...

1056
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:14,785
I can't quite hear you.

1057
00:56:14,885 --> 00:56:15,586
I'm sorry.

1058
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:19,908
It sounds like it could become popular with guitarists.

1059
00:56:19,928 --> 00:56:20,268
Hopefully.

1060
00:56:20,649 --> 00:56:21,209
I mean, you know.

1061
00:56:21,732 --> 00:56:22,852
That's great if it does, right?

1062
00:56:24,173 --> 00:56:26,314
A lot of people have spent years trying to come up

1063
00:56:26,334 --> 00:56:27,294
with good MIDI solutions.

1064
00:56:27,394 --> 00:56:29,995
So if this is another one, and it turns out to be popular,

1065
00:56:30,035 --> 00:56:30,496
that's great.

1066
00:56:30,796 --> 00:56:31,796
Yeah, I should take the time to plug,

1067
00:56:31,816 --> 00:56:34,277
both the guitars are MIDI output, the plastic one

1068
00:56:34,317 --> 00:56:36,258
and the string one, as is our keyboard.

1069
00:56:36,278 --> 00:56:38,279
So we made actual real instruments this time.

1070
00:56:38,739 --> 00:56:39,319
I'm going to try it.

1071
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:43,241
Thanks.

1072
00:56:43,321 --> 00:56:45,382
One of your earlier slides had a fun score

1073
00:56:46,042 --> 00:56:47,143
as part of the user research.

1074
00:56:47,662 --> 00:56:50,444
I was just wondering, is that something you developed internally?

1075
00:56:50,484 --> 00:56:52,306
Like, the concept of a fun score and...

1076
00:56:52,727 --> 00:56:53,187
We actually...

1077
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:54,829
Yeah, what's that meant to test for you?

1078
00:56:55,429 --> 00:56:57,131
Oh, we would actually just ask the people,

1079
00:56:57,171 --> 00:56:59,493
if you had to rate it on the scale of 0 to 5,

1080
00:56:59,633 --> 00:57:01,936
how fun it was, and then aggregated that onto that chart.

1081
00:57:02,576 --> 00:57:05,199
Okay, and so it's just a general sanity check?

1082
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:12,026
Yeah, I mean, you know, fun is, I mean, if you've ever seen any design talk where people start talking about fun, it's kind of hard to quantify it.

1083
00:57:12,106 --> 00:57:16,789
So, but, you know, people, when they find something fun, they have some idea of how fun it is.

1084
00:57:16,869 --> 00:57:22,213
So we just ask them and use that sort of information to figure out whether we're on the right path or not.

1085
00:57:22,254 --> 00:57:25,916
And then try to drill down into what's tripping them up, what's causing little issues.

1086
00:57:26,197 --> 00:57:29,759
I think early on, I think we've done maybe zero to five the whole time.

1087
00:57:29,799 --> 00:57:33,342
So you can compare it against past games fun level at that certain level of the project.

1088
00:57:33,827 --> 00:57:36,268
So whatever standard, I guess, just keep it the same

1089
00:57:36,308 --> 00:57:37,949
so you can compare it in future games.

1090
00:57:38,429 --> 00:57:38,649
Neat.

1091
00:57:38,729 --> 00:57:38,929
Thanks.

1092
00:57:39,169 --> 00:57:39,449
No problem.

1093
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:42,190
Hi.

1094
00:57:43,371 --> 00:57:46,472
I have been playing this with quite a lot of people.

1095
00:57:46,752 --> 00:57:49,013
And since you've done a lot of play testing,

1096
00:57:49,033 --> 00:57:51,334
I would like to hear if you have any.

1097
00:57:51,574 --> 00:57:52,554
Could you speak up a little bit?

1098
00:57:52,694 --> 00:57:53,094
Oh, sorry.

1099
00:57:53,374 --> 00:57:55,775
If you have done a lot of play testing,

1100
00:57:56,295 --> 00:58:01,777
I've noticed some difference in people who are unexperienced

1101
00:58:01,837 --> 00:58:02,778
or never played this.

1102
00:58:03,489 --> 00:58:10,193
and the way they are picking things up, whether they have been playing music or not, and also

1103
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:16,056
difference between whether they've been playing music using musical notes or just by, like

1104
00:58:16,116 --> 00:58:21,139
rock music is usually you don't know the notes and then classical musicians are very trained

1105
00:58:21,179 --> 00:58:22,199
in using musical notes.

1106
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:27,302
Do you have any experience from your playtesting, like around that issue?

1107
00:58:27,732 --> 00:58:33,235
Yeah, well, we actually, internally, we keep a database of all our employees, what their musical experience is,

1108
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:37,136
you know, how experienced they are with our games, what difficulties they play on,

1109
00:58:37,196 --> 00:58:41,178
so that when we're testing these things, we actually can pull that type of information out.

1110
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:44,740
Like, certainly, somebody who plays guitar or even plays music has a little bit of a leg up.

1111
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:51,143
And we did find that there was one guy who went into the test, didn't go through any

1112
00:58:51,163 --> 00:58:56,326
of the tutorials, went straight in, and saw the chord language, and just, he got it right

1113
00:58:56,346 --> 00:58:56,626
away.

1114
00:58:57,166 --> 00:59:00,428
Now, other people would be like, I don't know what this is, but some people just got it

1115
00:59:00,488 --> 00:59:00,908
right away.

1116
00:59:01,108 --> 00:59:05,811
And, you know, certainly the ones who play more music are going to do that.

1117
00:59:06,071 --> 00:59:09,853
I should point out that there were some musicians, it actually had a little bit more of an actual

1118
00:59:09,893 --> 00:59:12,835
learning curve for the first five, ten minutes because they're used to a different way of

1119
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:13,935
thinking of a tab and all that.

1120
00:59:14,496 --> 00:59:14,656
So.

1121
00:59:15,191 --> 00:59:18,333
Some people that are non-musicians actually had a leg up in our final system.

1122
00:59:18,834 --> 00:59:21,016
It depended on the person and kind of how they thought.

1123
00:59:21,076 --> 00:59:26,160
But generally, there was about anywhere from a 5- to 40-minute learning curve

1124
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,822
of just being able to translate the dimensions of moving up, moving left on the screen

1125
00:59:30,243 --> 00:59:32,705
and that kind of axis rotation.

1126
00:59:34,126 --> 00:59:39,470
And did you see any link between knowing to play with musical notes or not in your...

1127
00:59:41,294 --> 00:59:46,743
this data of what experience they had before and how long it took for them to pick things up.

1128
00:59:48,606 --> 00:59:50,329
Between them being able to read traditional music?

1129
00:59:51,451 --> 00:59:54,973
This is not really a correlation there, because we don't display anything in traditional notation.

1130
00:59:55,193 --> 01:00:01,556
I think the more important skill for actually parsing it was being familiar with beat match

1131
01:00:01,596 --> 01:00:02,176
to some degree.

1132
01:00:02,496 --> 01:00:05,277
And if they had read tablature, that was also useful.

1133
01:00:05,837 --> 01:00:10,159
You know, a lot of players, a lot of what we were trying to eliminate was players stopping

1134
01:00:10,179 --> 01:00:12,721
and looking at their hands, because we want them looking at the screen.

1135
01:00:13,121 --> 01:00:17,122
So we were trying to keep feedback and things like that up there, so you could know what

1136
01:00:17,143 --> 01:00:18,863
your hand was doing without having to look at it.

1137
01:00:19,343 --> 01:00:19,564
Right?

1138
01:00:20,024 --> 01:00:20,584
And, yeah.
