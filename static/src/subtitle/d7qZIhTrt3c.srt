1
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:07,942
My name is MiloÅ¡. I'm coming from Nordeus,

2
00:00:07,962 --> 00:00:10,983
a gaming studio based in Belgrade.

3
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:14,225
I'm here to tell you a bit more about

4
00:00:14,965 --> 00:00:16,626
our giving back efforts to the community.

5
00:00:18,246 --> 00:00:21,007
I will mention community a few times

6
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:23,569
during this half an hour, and when I say community,

7
00:00:24,389 --> 00:00:28,050
I mean the community where we are

8
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:30,031
working and living as a company.

9
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:31,892
So, for us, that's Serbia.

10
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:35,783
I'm going to talk about different strategical things,

11
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,084
different technical things.

12
00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:41,086
And I hope there will be a lot for you to take away

13
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:42,826
from this lecture.

14
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:50,209
Ask yourself, why should we, as game producers, game

15
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:52,550
developers, give back to our communities?

16
00:00:56,447 --> 00:00:58,228
I have a few reasons why.

17
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:03,893
First one, that we need to figure out that our businesses are an integral part of our

18
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:04,494
communities.

19
00:01:06,195 --> 00:01:11,339
If our communities are not developing, our businesses in one moment will have problems

20
00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:12,300
with the resources.

21
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:18,585
When I say resources, what I mean, I mean knowledge, I mean people, I mean funding.

22
00:01:19,502 --> 00:01:22,904
We need to figure out the ways how to develop our community

23
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:26,186
so our business can grow with it.

24
00:01:27,847 --> 00:01:30,648
Second important thing is that you need to stand out.

25
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:35,131
In this moment, there is hundreds, thousands,

26
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:38,973
gazillion companies that are very similar to yours.

27
00:01:40,353 --> 00:01:45,336
And if you want to attract the brightest

28
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:48,338
and most passionate people to work for you,

29
00:01:49,803 --> 00:01:51,524
You need to find a way how to stand out.

30
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:56,187
And if you show your future employees that you're thinking

31
00:01:56,227 --> 00:02:01,010
strategically and how to develop your community, that

32
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,672
you're thinking strategically a few years ahead about your

33
00:02:04,712 --> 00:02:07,614
business, and that you're having a cause that is bigger

34
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:12,057
than your business in some sense, that is one of the best

35
00:02:12,117 --> 00:02:14,278
ways how to differentiate.

36
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,420
Eventually, if you don't want to do it, your players will

37
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,061
ask you to do it.

38
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:23,506
With all these generations that are now here,

39
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:28,447
millennials, set, epsilon, all these generations,

40
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:30,308
for all these generations,

41
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:33,128
purpose is something that is very important.

42
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:38,450
There is many, many surveys that shows

43
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,030
that millennials, for example,

44
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,031
will rather buy products from companies

45
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:44,191
that have some kind of purpose,

46
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:48,332
comparing, of course, to ones that don't have.

47
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:49,412
So.

48
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:52,736
One way or another, if you don't want to do it,

49
00:02:52,936 --> 00:02:54,838
in one moment your players will ask you to.

50
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,042
These kind of activities are awesome way

51
00:02:59,082 --> 00:03:02,485
to create a different type of engagement for your people.

52
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:04,187
When I say people, I mean your colleagues

53
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:05,328
that work with you.

54
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:08,591
When I say different engagement,

55
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:10,092
different than their everyday work.

56
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,683
And of course, that will create different content

57
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:18,865
for external and internal communication that you can use.

58
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:21,628
And of course, awesome content that you can use

59
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:24,771
to tell everybody what you are working on.

60
00:03:26,312 --> 00:03:27,273
So how we started.

61
00:03:28,113 --> 00:03:31,917
We, when we were founded 2010,

62
00:03:32,437 --> 00:03:34,639
we didn't know a lot about giving back.

63
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,441
But we knew that we want to do it.

64
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:39,323
So what we did,

65
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:42,096
We asked our colleagues, hey guys,

66
00:03:43,337 --> 00:03:45,137
what is the thing that you're passionate about?

67
00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:47,118
And it was babies.

68
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:51,779
So, yeah, awesome, awesome thing to be passionate about.

69
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:57,040
And what we did, we invested one million euros

70
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,181
in the construction of 15 maternity wards in Serbia.

71
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:05,563
Those 15 maternity wards are responsible

72
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:08,983
for 30% of all babies born in our country.

73
00:04:10,388 --> 00:04:11,268
Huge thing.

74
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:15,151
If you want to compare it to US market,

75
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:19,393
it's like we invested $180 million into some cause.

76
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,456
A lot, a lot of money there.

77
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:25,937
I'll talk a lot about Serbia.

78
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:29,539
So for starters, let me give you a little bit of context

79
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,321
who we are as a Nordius and who we are as a country.

80
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:35,503
So as I said, we are founded in 2010.

81
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,305
We have three games published by now.

82
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:43,747
And one that we are mostly known for is Top Eleven,

83
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:44,468
Football Manager.

84
00:04:45,248 --> 00:04:47,750
We have 200 million registered users.

85
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,473
And Top Eleven is one of the most successful games for

86
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:56,215
mobile platforms in sports category.

87
00:04:56,735 --> 00:05:01,458
We also have Golden Boot and Heroic, which are out there

88
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,759
for a short period of time.

89
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,620
But we will see how they will develop.

90
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:06,261
We are cool.

91
00:05:07,318 --> 00:05:09,780
of 170 people from 22 nationalities.

92
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:12,763
So very, very diverse group.

93
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:15,907
And as I said, we are based in Belgrade, Serbia.

94
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:20,651
So Serbia, not Siberia.

95
00:05:21,632 --> 00:05:25,777
Siberia is in Russia, it's very cold there, bears, snow.

96
00:05:26,297 --> 00:05:29,420
Probably half of Siberia is not even livable.

97
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:34,294
We're in Eastern Europe, in Balkans region.

98
00:05:35,074 --> 00:05:36,815
Very beautiful region, small region,

99
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:38,235
but with very turbulent history.

100
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:44,498
We as a country have very thriving IT industry right now

101
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:48,840
and worldwide we are known for our tech talents.

102
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:53,402
Also, we are very known through history

103
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:56,664
for our scientists and our sportsmen.

104
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:58,724
So to test your knowledge,

105
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:00,664
Do you know who this guy is?

106
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:04,486
Tesla.

107
00:06:05,526 --> 00:06:08,227
I cannot see anything, but I heard Tesla somewhere.

108
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:10,508
That's right, Nikola Tesla.

109
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:13,869
So this is the guy that this Tesla Automotive Company

110
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:16,189
was named by, and he's responsible

111
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,110
for all the electricity we have here.

112
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,691
So what he did, he created a system

113
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:25,072
to transport electricity in long distances.

114
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:28,939
Of course, he did many other amazing things,

115
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,799
but this is the one that he's mostly known for.

116
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:33,800
And he lived a lot of his,

117
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,001
like half of his life here in US.

118
00:06:38,621 --> 00:06:39,321
Mihailo Pupin.

119
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:41,862
It's not a quiz because probably you wouldn't know who he is,

120
00:06:42,622 --> 00:06:44,522
but he's a very cool guy.

121
00:06:44,902 --> 00:06:45,203
Why?

122
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:48,323
He has a crater on the moon named by him.

123
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:51,644
And he was the one of the founders of NASA.

124
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,461
Also, he perfected the phone.

125
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:58,023
So, not mobile phone, the landline phone,

126
00:06:58,063 --> 00:07:00,064
so our parents would be very happy with him.

127
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:03,466
But he did also some many amazing things

128
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:06,448
in different areas.

129
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:07,768
And do you know this guy?

130
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:09,949
Come on.

131
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,811
Yeah, maybe I heard greatest tennis player

132
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:14,752
of all time somewhere.

133
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:15,812
Yeah.

134
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:18,950
I think he is, maybe we can argue about it

135
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,671
and talk a little bit after,

136
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:26,033
but 70 and something titles speak a lot who he is.

137
00:07:26,874 --> 00:07:30,616
So, small country with some amazing people out there

138
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,457
and tech talents thriving in the industry.

139
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:35,978
But let's get back to our babies.

140
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:39,156
So how we did this activity?

141
00:07:39,316 --> 00:07:45,401
We supported the NGO that was working on this project.

142
00:07:46,122 --> 00:07:48,384
We give them financial support,

143
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:50,646
and we support this activity

144
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,147
in different communication ways.

145
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:55,330
So we help them spread the word about it.

146
00:07:56,782 --> 00:07:58,023
And mostly that was it,

147
00:07:58,243 --> 00:08:01,465
because we couldn't use our expertise in this area

148
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:03,647
because we do not know anything about babies,

149
00:08:04,107 --> 00:08:05,508
except they are cute, et cetera.

150
00:08:06,328 --> 00:08:11,892
So, before we go more deeply into the reconstruction,

151
00:08:12,373 --> 00:08:14,494
let me give you one other example from Serbia

152
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,615
of giving back activity.

153
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:19,558
This activity is from the banking sector,

154
00:08:19,818 --> 00:08:22,440
so I have to use this very generic banking slide to show it.

155
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:25,772
And you're right, there is something missing here.

156
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:30,633
This guy is like the guy for the whole corporate PPTs

157
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:31,773
and you can find him everywhere.

158
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:35,654
But the text out there, it's something that is not generic,

159
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:37,434
so pay attention on it.

160
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:40,115
What this bank did in Serbia,

161
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:44,536
if you want to take a loan as an entrepreneur,

162
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:47,136
your company must be older than two years.

163
00:08:49,217 --> 00:08:50,497
You're too risky for the banks

164
00:08:50,557 --> 00:08:51,718
and they don't want to give you a loan.

165
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:53,019
What this bank did,

166
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:56,200
they created a support educational system

167
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,963
that gave you a consultancy before you asked for a loan,

168
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:04,424
somebody to help you to develop your business plan,

169
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,745
to understand how your business should look like

170
00:09:06,785 --> 00:09:07,286
in the future.

171
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:08,826
And when you get your loan,

172
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:12,508
they gave you a mentorship in duration of one year,

173
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:15,150
where some entrepreneur from your industry

174
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,831
will help you to further develop your business.

175
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:22,335
So essentially, they created a product

176
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:25,396
and attached different giving back activities on it.

177
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:30,157
We have these two examples side by side.

178
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:35,077
Let's try to compare them and understand the differences.

179
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:39,578
So we can both agree that both of them are giving back.

180
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:41,939
Their activities for the community,

181
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,299
they are solving some problems out there,

182
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:47,020
so that's out there.

183
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:48,864
Can you help me with this?

184
00:09:49,064 --> 00:09:50,885
In what ways were companies involved?

185
00:09:51,785 --> 00:09:53,505
When you look at the activity that we did,

186
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,866
in what way were we involved as a Nordius

187
00:09:55,906 --> 00:09:57,146
in this battle for maternity wards?

188
00:09:59,486 --> 00:09:59,686
Finance.

189
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:01,887
Finance, you're true, you're right, you're true.

190
00:10:02,747 --> 00:10:03,067
You're right.

191
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:04,747
So, and the bank?

192
00:10:08,948 --> 00:10:09,388
Service?

193
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:12,689
Yeah, service, knowledge, people.

194
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:15,769
They use the expertise of their people

195
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:17,730
to create a value for the community.

196
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:24,149
How their people were involved, our people were involved in communication.

197
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:27,892
We were out there, we were talking about the things that we were doing, we were opening

198
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:35,278
maternity wards, we were trying to use our PR agencies to help to spread the word, etc.

199
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:40,582
And the bank, the bank used the expertise and knowledge of their people to really do

200
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:43,664
some work out there and help entrepreneurs directly.

201
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:46,947
How this impacted the businesses?

202
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:50,513
For us, when we thought about it,

203
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:53,194
we didn't thought about the business

204
00:10:53,234 --> 00:10:55,154
when we made the decision to support

205
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:56,294
Battle for Maternity Wards.

206
00:10:57,255 --> 00:10:59,415
It was a burning problem in Serbia.

207
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,075
We just wanted to solve it.

208
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:04,376
We want to help our community,

209
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:05,636
so we just went out there and did it.

210
00:11:05,936 --> 00:11:08,617
And it's very hard to put a value

211
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:10,197
when you're helping babies.

212
00:11:10,257 --> 00:11:10,958
You never know.

213
00:11:10,978 --> 00:11:14,538
It's very hard to calculate it in your business.

214
00:11:15,443 --> 00:11:19,465
But for the bank, they created a pipeline

215
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:21,026
for their future customers.

216
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:25,009
When you help entrepreneurs in early stage,

217
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:30,753
it's very, very probably they will stay with you

218
00:11:31,653 --> 00:11:35,376
after they grew and become a stable business.

219
00:11:36,885 --> 00:11:41,586
When it comes to external communication, a lot of people asked us why babies?

220
00:11:42,426 --> 00:11:43,366
Where is the connection?

221
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:44,786
What's happening there?

222
00:11:44,826 --> 00:11:47,087
Why are you as a gaming company helping babies?

223
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:52,728
And for the bank, it was something that was very logical to explain.

224
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:57,829
Since, hey, we are a bank, we are a financial institution, we are helping entrepreneurs

225
00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:58,649
start their businesses.

226
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:00,129
Super logical.

227
00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:04,870
So nobody asked them why, they just asked them to give them more information how we

228
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,250
can help.

229
00:12:06,577 --> 00:12:09,239
So when we have those two examples side by side,

230
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:12,502
what do you think, which one of those

231
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:14,244
will have longer impact,

232
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:17,426
bigger impact in the long run?

233
00:12:18,507 --> 00:12:19,588
Let's show up hands.

234
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:21,710
Who think the baby example?

235
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:25,152
And the bank?

236
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:27,094
So probably others.

237
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:30,917
You heartless people, you choose banks before babies.

238
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:33,139
But you're right.

239
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,609
bank will have the bigger impact.

240
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,330
Why?

241
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,052
Because their giving back activity

242
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:44,153
is integrated in their product.

243
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:49,215
And their product, when this activity will help them

244
00:12:49,556 --> 00:12:52,357
grow as a business, so the impact,

245
00:12:53,378 --> 00:12:56,019
when you're calculating it over the years, will grow.

246
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,601
Just imagine the situation where we, as a gaming company,

247
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:01,702
ran into some problems.

248
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:05,776
This activity will be the first one that should be cut.

249
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:08,177
Because that's how businesses work.

250
00:13:08,297 --> 00:13:10,178
You have like expense,

251
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:13,199
it's not giving any value to a business,

252
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,820
cut it and move on.

253
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,582
So in that sense, the bank will create more impact.

254
00:13:21,222 --> 00:13:22,463
Also, what is important,

255
00:13:23,563 --> 00:13:26,405
this activity was a part of a bigger strategy.

256
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:28,626
It was just one of activities

257
00:13:29,386 --> 00:13:32,447
that was aimed to create a value for the community.

258
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,823
So when we finished with our giving back,

259
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:40,745
with our Battle for Maternity Awards activity,

260
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:42,386
we wanted to figure out, okay,

261
00:13:43,186 --> 00:13:45,368
how should we use more knowledge

262
00:13:46,148 --> 00:13:48,630
and our expertise to help community out?

263
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:52,572
And what we did, we created a strategy

264
00:13:53,593 --> 00:13:56,054
that has four different stakeholders in it.

265
00:13:56,995 --> 00:13:59,657
First, stakeholders are employees.

266
00:14:00,651 --> 00:14:04,675
We wanted to figure out the ways how we can help our employees

267
00:14:05,736 --> 00:14:08,058
give back to the causes they care about.

268
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,361
So we want to create different internal events,

269
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:13,303
different fundraisers to help them to do it.

270
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:16,426
Other stakeholders are players.

271
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:20,852
We, as a gaming company, have a huge platform, our game,

272
00:14:21,572 --> 00:14:24,673
or now our games, that will grow.

273
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,574
And those platforms and those players

274
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:30,394
have some causes that they're passionate about.

275
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:32,875
And we want to use our platforms as a way

276
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,675
to give them opportunity to give back.

277
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,396
Third is environment.

278
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:40,657
There is a huge talk about environment

279
00:14:40,777 --> 00:14:43,198
and what kind of, like...

280
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,041
about the problems that we are in right now.

281
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:48,123
So we don't want to be a part of the problem.

282
00:14:48,183 --> 00:14:51,104
We want to try and be part of the solution

283
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:53,446
and think about how we're using our resources

284
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:54,566
and what can we do better.

285
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:57,728
And fourth, which is most important for us

286
00:14:57,788 --> 00:15:00,890
and probably most interesting for you, is community.

287
00:15:01,993 --> 00:15:05,014
So when we were thinking about how to help out our community,

288
00:15:05,595 --> 00:15:07,656
we figured out that there are three challenges out there.

289
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:12,918
First one is very low level of digitalization in Serbia.

290
00:15:13,698 --> 00:15:16,780
So our systems are very outdated.

291
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,821
We are still waiting in lines, in post offices, banks.

292
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:24,443
We don't use modern tools in our everyday business

293
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:25,464
or administration.

294
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:28,906
And we wanted, as a company, to figure out how to help there.

295
00:15:29,886 --> 00:15:31,806
Second thing is education.

296
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,287
We have an outdated higher education,

297
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:39,489
which is not creating talents that

298
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:42,409
are needed for this fourth industrial revolution.

299
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,870
We want to change that.

300
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,971
And third thing is, we as a gaming company,

301
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:50,732
we care about gaming ecosystem.

302
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:55,207
In Serbia, the gaming ecosystem is very underdeveloped,

303
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:59,268
and we wanted to set as our mission

304
00:15:59,328 --> 00:16:02,768
to find a way how to help that ecosystem develop.

305
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:08,450
First thing that we did to go out

306
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,130
and solve all of these problems

307
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,571
is create an umbrella organization

308
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:14,951
with like-minded companies.

309
00:16:16,465 --> 00:16:17,846
Why an umbrella organization?

310
00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:22,847
We figured out that if you want to tackle the systemic problems,

311
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:26,548
like huge problems, you need to work very closely with the state.

312
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:28,788
You need to go and change the laws.

313
00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:30,068
You need to work with ministries.

314
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:35,389
And we, as a company, we didn't have that power to do it.

315
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:39,210
So we created Digital Serbia Initiative

316
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,331
with 26 like-minded companies that are from different industries.

317
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:45,131
So we will have more.

318
00:16:46,497 --> 00:16:48,779
We'll have more soft power to use

319
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:53,463
when we are dealing with different stakeholders on top.

320
00:16:54,564 --> 00:17:01,049
We wanted to figure out how to solve problems in these areas.

321
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,211
First one is higher education.

322
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:05,934
Second one is legal framework.

323
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:08,076
Third, startup ecosystem.

324
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:11,098
And fourth, we want to figure out the ways

325
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:12,119
how we can help

326
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:16,897
Why their public understand the importance of digitalization and such.

327
00:17:17,718 --> 00:17:19,759
So when we had an umbrella organization,

328
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:25,223
the second thing we wanted to do is create a physical space

329
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:27,284
from where we can run these changes.

330
00:17:28,285 --> 00:17:29,846
So we created the Nordeus Hub.

331
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:33,899
Nordeus Hub is a co-working slash event space

332
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:37,780
where it's a physical space very close to our office.

333
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,282
And from there, we want to do different things

334
00:17:41,422 --> 00:17:42,142
in the community.

335
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:44,483
We want to run different programs for talents.

336
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:49,225
We want to help talents develop even further

337
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:53,147
and help them to start creating value

338
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:55,688
for their community as early as possible.

339
00:17:56,973 --> 00:18:01,235
Also, we want to help out the community-driven programs.

340
00:18:01,695 --> 00:18:03,916
So we want to help communities,

341
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:05,997
programs that are coming from community

342
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:08,398
to have a space where they can do their programs

343
00:18:08,498 --> 00:18:10,899
and help them increase their impact.

344
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,521
We want to help our people develop even further

345
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:18,142
so they can increase their impact on the community.

346
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:23,665
And fourth, we want to help Serbian Gaming Association

347
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:27,577
develop the gaming industry as much as possible.

348
00:18:27,997 --> 00:18:32,321
We're helping them to do different events

349
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:37,265
in Nordius Hub, and also run different programs

350
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:38,866
in our Hub for Gaming community.

351
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:41,929
I'm going to tell you a little bit more about those programs.

352
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:44,311
So first is Game Making Boot Camp.

353
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:48,775
We figured out that our students in Serbia

354
00:18:49,055 --> 00:18:53,318
are not getting into any touch with the gaming industry.

355
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:55,192
during their studies.

356
00:18:55,993 --> 00:18:58,275
So if they're playing games, that's

357
00:18:58,315 --> 00:19:00,837
the only way how they communicate.

358
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,159
Because in our curriculums, there

359
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:05,681
isn't anything that is connected to the gaming industry.

360
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:09,004
So we figured out that we have to show them

361
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:11,747
how gaming industry looks like from inside.

362
00:19:12,387 --> 00:19:16,852
And we created a boot camp that will have different tracks for different type of students

363
00:19:17,353 --> 00:19:20,697
to show them a bigger picture how the gaming industry looks.

364
00:19:21,177 --> 00:19:26,443
We will have a track for artists, we will have tracks for game devs, we will have a

365
00:19:26,483 --> 00:19:30,768
track for business development, game designers, etc.

366
00:19:31,248 --> 00:19:32,850
And with the idea...

367
00:19:33,748 --> 00:19:37,452
to put the gaming industry and career in gaming

368
00:19:37,973 --> 00:19:42,018
as one of the first few choices for the students

369
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:45,062
when they think about what is my next step in the career.

370
00:19:46,604 --> 00:19:49,227
Second program is Indie Game Incubator.

371
00:19:51,095 --> 00:19:54,077
We want to develop a gaming industry in Belgrade, in Serbia.

372
00:19:54,837 --> 00:19:59,159
And if we want to do that, we figured out

373
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:04,381
that we do not have a mechanism that is creating or supporting

374
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:06,663
new and upcoming gaming studios.

375
00:20:07,737 --> 00:20:12,101
So what we did, we created an incubator program

376
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:13,662
which will last six months,

377
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:19,106
and it will consist from coworking space for six months.

378
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:23,850
We will also do assessment in the game studio

379
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:26,712
and give them mentors for different areas

380
00:20:27,153 --> 00:20:29,034
where they need help the most.

381
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:32,656
And we will organize different workshops that are more,

382
00:20:32,716 --> 00:20:37,019
they're like general business workshops,

383
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:41,122
that will help businesses understand the other roles

384
00:20:41,182 --> 00:20:42,883
their business needs to have,

385
00:20:43,123 --> 00:20:47,546
like HR, finance, accounting, law, et cetera.

386
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:53,050
We hope that this program will help us to produce

387
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,111
one, two, three.

388
00:20:55,535 --> 00:21:00,701
game, new gaming studios in the future, and it will help us fuel the gaming industry.

389
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:06,704
This example, this is also one activity that we did,

390
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:09,286
but it's not connected to our community,

391
00:21:09,306 --> 00:21:14,088
it's more connected to our community of our players.

392
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,409
But I wanted to mention it to you

393
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:19,771
just for you to understand how you can use your games

394
00:21:19,851 --> 00:21:23,633
maybe to impact your players.

395
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:25,293
Do you maybe know what is this?

396
00:21:25,954 --> 00:21:27,675
Have you heard about War Child Football Club?

397
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:30,089
No? Yeah.

398
00:21:30,949 --> 00:21:31,890
It's a soccer club.

399
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,531
So, not football, soccer club.

400
00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:37,272
And the World Child is an organization

401
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:38,813
that is helping children...

402
00:21:40,786 --> 00:21:43,507
reintegrate into their societies after they survived

403
00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:48,288
some kind of war or they lived near the war zone, et cetera.

404
00:21:48,788 --> 00:21:52,108
War Child Football Club is the program they are running

405
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:53,609
in Central African Republic,

406
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:56,309
where they want to use football or soccer

407
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,930
as a tool to help those children

408
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,490
reintegrate into their society.

409
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:04,671
For us, we have a football game,

410
00:22:05,331 --> 00:22:08,312
and it was an easy match to make.

411
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:12,416
You can see they have very funky jerseys.

412
00:22:13,177 --> 00:22:15,658
And those jerseys, they're using those jerseys in real life

413
00:22:15,738 --> 00:22:17,379
and they're awesome looking.

414
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,400
So what we figured out, what we can do,

415
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:23,323
we offered those jerseys in our in-game shop.

416
00:22:23,923 --> 00:22:26,404
So you can buy those jerseys and their emblem

417
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:28,926
in our in-game shop and all the proceedings will go to them.

418
00:22:30,507 --> 00:22:33,568
The response from the community was amazing.

419
00:22:34,803 --> 00:22:39,326
The sales of this jersey surpassed the sales of jerseys

420
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:42,188
from some of the most famous soccer clubs,

421
00:22:42,548 --> 00:22:43,449
football clubs in the world,

422
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,150
like Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, and others.

423
00:22:48,052 --> 00:22:49,973
For us, this is just scratching the surface.

424
00:22:50,093 --> 00:22:53,355
It's a new turf, but I think there are studios out there

425
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,237
that are doing a great job with this,

426
00:22:55,997 --> 00:22:58,939
and I think this is a territory where we can do

427
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:00,800
so many amazing things in the future.

428
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,021
So, let's summarize how we got there,

429
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:08,401
and how maybe you, when you go home,

430
00:23:08,981 --> 00:23:12,863
can retrace our steps and maybe be here

431
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:14,383
even in a few years and talk about it.

432
00:23:15,383 --> 00:23:19,545
First of all, try to start with anything, really.

433
00:23:19,925 --> 00:23:20,985
Don't overthink it.

434
00:23:21,085 --> 00:23:23,766
You go back home and think about

435
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,066
what is the cause that you are passionate about,

436
00:23:26,427 --> 00:23:29,407
or what is the cause that your company is passionate about.

437
00:23:30,788 --> 00:23:33,570
It's just, or your people that are passionate,

438
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,690
just go out there and solve it.

439
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,492
We did it with the Better for Maternity awards.

440
00:23:37,992 --> 00:23:41,014
And in the end, it was something that created a huge value.

441
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:42,155
We solved a huge problem.

442
00:23:43,095 --> 00:23:45,137
So it's just important to start somewhere.

443
00:23:45,797 --> 00:23:46,878
But when you're doing that,

444
00:23:47,378 --> 00:23:49,940
think about what are the problems out there

445
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,561
in the community that...

446
00:23:52,617 --> 00:23:57,901
really you or your company have expertise and knowledge to solve it and that you are

447
00:23:57,921 --> 00:23:59,162
of course passionate about it.

448
00:23:59,802 --> 00:24:04,786
For us, those were higher education, digitalization, and gaming ecosystem.

449
00:24:06,687 --> 00:24:11,771
When you figure out those challenges, try to figure out what are the knowledge, what

450
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:15,153
are the skills and expertise you have that you can use in solving those problems.

451
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:19,056
Look, money can be given by anybody.

452
00:24:20,032 --> 00:24:22,994
But the expertise and knowledge we have as an industry,

453
00:24:23,414 --> 00:24:24,434
it's quite unique.

454
00:24:25,615 --> 00:24:28,576
For Serbia, it's certainly totally unique

455
00:24:28,996 --> 00:24:32,778
because maybe there is one, two, three companies in Serbia

456
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:34,679
that created the product from scratch

457
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:36,760
and had a global success with it.

458
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:42,232
But for your communities, it's important to understand

459
00:24:42,612 --> 00:24:45,555
what are your skills that you excel

460
00:24:45,975 --> 00:24:47,276
and knowledges that you excel

461
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:49,958
and how you can transfer and create value for the community.

462
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:55,043
And of course, try to create a holistic strategy around it.

463
00:24:55,523 --> 00:24:57,364
Try to understand who are the people

464
00:24:57,404 --> 00:24:59,686
that you want to impact and try to understand

465
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:01,288
what are the ways that you can impact them.

466
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:08,207
We're just in the beginning of this adventure as a gaming industry.

467
00:25:08,988 --> 00:25:13,732
The rest of the world and the rest of the industries went a few steps ahead,

468
00:25:14,673 --> 00:25:17,896
but the important thing is that we are not pioneers,

469
00:25:18,056 --> 00:25:22,861
so we can maybe use the knowledge and experience they had

470
00:25:23,261 --> 00:25:25,203
to start a few steps ahead of them.

471
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:28,567
and try to do amazing things.

472
00:25:29,968 --> 00:25:31,629
We have responsibility to try

473
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:33,690
because we're in the entertainment industry.

474
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,351
We are very high grossing industry.

475
00:25:36,472 --> 00:25:37,792
And what is more important,

476
00:25:38,313 --> 00:25:43,135
we are like touching so many lives out there.

477
00:25:43,956 --> 00:25:45,777
So many people that are living in so many,

478
00:25:46,297 --> 00:25:49,499
in many different communities with many different problems.

479
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:52,781
And we have a platform that we can use to harvest.

480
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:56,766
different skills, expertise, money, or whatever it is,

481
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:58,630
and try to solve some problems out there.

482
00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:01,553
Thank you so much.

483
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,674
This was all for me.

484
00:26:04,094 --> 00:26:06,816
It was an amazing experience being here and talking with you.

485
00:26:08,217 --> 00:26:10,918
Please, if you have some questions, feel free to ask.

486
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:12,939
I think we'll have three, four minutes.

487
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,022
Anyhow, if we don't have more time to do it,

488
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:20,184
I will be in Overlook 2014 for 45 minutes.

489
00:26:20,864 --> 00:26:23,346
So you can come over there and talk to me.

490
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:27,368
Also, these are my contacts, so feel free to reach out

491
00:26:27,488 --> 00:26:30,230
and say hi or ask any questions you have.

492
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:31,356
Thank you so much.

493
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,061
How many people does it take?

494
00:26:41,581 --> 00:26:44,704
And what's the size that you need to do something like this?

495
00:26:45,665 --> 00:26:48,727
It really depends, but you need to...

496
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:49,808
Yeah, it really depends.

497
00:26:49,948 --> 00:26:52,630
Right now, from Node.js perspective,

498
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:57,374
there is always 10, 20 people involved in some capacity.

499
00:26:57,995 --> 00:27:00,637
And it differs because there is different activities,

500
00:27:00,717 --> 00:27:02,519
so we need different skill set,

501
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,401
but you need to have one person that will...

502
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:07,275
lead the charge.

503
00:27:07,956 --> 00:27:11,358
It doesn't have to be a full-time person, but it has to be somebody that will think

504
00:27:11,438 --> 00:27:16,562
about how these activities are progressing, and the person that will talk with others,

505
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:20,985
with managers, with people in the company, to try to help them understand what is the

506
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:22,847
scope of the job and how they can be involved.

507
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:27,490
So out of the 15 to 20 people, none of those are full-time on this?

508
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,051
It's just a passion that they have?

509
00:27:29,832 --> 00:27:30,072
Yeah.

510
00:27:30,352 --> 00:27:32,494
It's a passion that they have, and also it's something that we...

511
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:38,834
We present this as part of their job and their time that they can use.

512
00:27:38,894 --> 00:27:43,736
So it's something that we are very passionate about as a company, so we mindfully invest

513
00:27:43,776 --> 00:27:44,276
time in it.

514
00:27:45,636 --> 00:27:48,977
Thank you.

515
00:27:49,057 --> 00:27:49,397
Please.

516
00:27:50,938 --> 00:27:53,839
I wanted to ask you, what were the biggest challenges?

517
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:57,220
You talked about that you did a program for teaching game development, right?

518
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:57,860
Yep.

519
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,941
What were the biggest challenges to setting all that up?

520
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:06,234
For us, the biggest challenge was to understand the market out there,

521
00:28:06,274 --> 00:28:09,579
because our gaming industry is very segmented in the sense that there is like

522
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:14,325
so many different gaming studios in different stages of development.

523
00:28:14,946 --> 00:28:19,352
And to create a program that will give value for all of them, it's very hard.

524
00:28:20,173 --> 00:28:22,094
And that was one of the biggest challenges.

525
00:28:22,855 --> 00:28:25,757
I think that we will see, because this program is now

526
00:28:25,897 --> 00:28:29,500
ongoing, what I can see the future problems could be

527
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,242
is maybe inflow of those new.

528
00:28:32,922 --> 00:28:38,507
We need to spin a few rounds of this game making boot camp

529
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:41,669
so we will have more people interested in making games

530
00:28:41,729 --> 00:28:42,950
in the future so we can help them.

531
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,732
And also, yeah, those are like briefly the problems,

532
00:28:47,752 --> 00:28:50,753
but there are many challenges out there, yeah.

533
00:28:50,953 --> 00:28:52,814
And just like a positive side note,

534
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:55,355
like how did the kids react?

535
00:28:55,395 --> 00:28:56,435
Like did they love it?

536
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:59,897
No, they enjoyed so much.

537
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:01,377
They're constantly out there.

538
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:03,618
They're like, hey, how can we do this?

539
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,979
You know, they're like asking to have more time with us,

540
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:10,681
to be there, and a lot of those children

541
00:29:10,701 --> 00:29:12,861
then ask what we can do next.

542
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,010
What are our next steps? How can we be involved more?

543
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,536
So I think the reaction was great.

544
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,543
That's awesome. Thank you.

545
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:21,580
Please.

546
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,683
Your indie game, Incubator, you mentioned.

547
00:29:25,403 --> 00:29:27,846
Obviously, EuroStudio would have put in a lot of time

548
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:30,308
and effort and money into things like PR

549
00:29:30,408 --> 00:29:31,729
and things like that for those.

550
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:34,552
I'm curious what sort of systems you

551
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,353
have for dealing with the revenue

552
00:29:36,393 --> 00:29:37,774
that any of those games brought in,

553
00:29:37,835 --> 00:29:40,997
whether it was a revenue sharing or a royalty-based thing

554
00:29:41,057 --> 00:29:41,338
or what.

555
00:29:41,878 --> 00:29:42,519
Thank you for your question.

556
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,380
We don't ask for anything.

557
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,201
We don't even do PR.

558
00:29:48,544 --> 00:29:54,107
So for us, because it's a very unique situation in Serbia.

559
00:29:54,147 --> 00:30:01,330
Nordeus is very popular there because it's like a startup child that everybody was looking for

560
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:06,072
and from like in our eight years we grew to be such a huge success in Serbia,

561
00:30:06,092 --> 00:30:07,092
so everybody knows about us.

562
00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:12,134
In that sense, we don't need to do any PR, we are very recognizable.

563
00:30:12,674 --> 00:30:15,496
And on the other hand, this is our giving back activity.

564
00:30:15,516 --> 00:30:16,896
We want to, what we want to do.

565
00:30:17,617 --> 00:30:21,258
We are seeing the benefits in creating the industry that

566
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:23,960
will come much later when we have 10 or 15,

567
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,002
30 successful gaming studios that we can maybe,

568
00:30:29,623 --> 00:30:31,544
that we can benefit from it in the future.

569
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:33,725
So for right now, we don't want to use any,

570
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:36,106
we don't want to ask for any money, any investment,

571
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:36,506
or anything.

572
00:30:36,546 --> 00:30:38,907
We just want to be there to help them out, to start,

573
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:40,528
and to see how it will develop.

574
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,288
Okay, so there are other people that are in the indie game incubator then.

575
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:48,815
Are they like officially working for you or are they separate?

576
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:55,419
No, they are our colleagues that are using part of their time and their expertise to help in different areas.

577
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:02,705
Okay, and last question, is your studio retaining the intellectual property rights for anything they make or are they themselves?

578
00:31:03,206 --> 00:31:09,071
No, no, no, no, everything, we don't take any credits, we don't take any royalties, nothing.

579
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:11,233
We're just there to help out.

580
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:12,374
Okay, thank you.

581
00:31:12,634 --> 00:31:12,874
Thank you.

582
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,590
So, uh-huh, please.

583
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,511
Sorry, one more.

584
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:24,755
Was there anything specifically, politically, logistically, that caused a lot of friction on the way to getting the system set up?

585
00:31:26,276 --> 00:31:33,540
From... those kind of frictions we have in this, like, higher scale solving of the problems,

586
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,102
in a sense, like dealing with the ministries in higher education, etc.

587
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:40,384
For incubator programs, those are all run by us.

588
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:43,325
And we have an expertise how to do them.

589
00:31:43,345 --> 00:31:46,226
We have a space, so we have resources put into them.

590
00:31:46,286 --> 00:31:50,747
In that sense, we didn't have a lot of big frictions.

591
00:31:50,987 --> 00:31:54,268
But when we are dealing with changing the higher education

592
00:31:54,488 --> 00:31:58,989
laws or trying to implement different game-connected

593
00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:01,549
curriculums to the universities, it

594
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:04,730
can be very hard to push because those systems are very slow.

595
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,051
They're not reacting good to change.

596
00:32:08,371 --> 00:32:10,571
So from that perspective, there are challenges.

597
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:11,792
Thank you.

598
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:13,153
Please.

599
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:18,237
This is all very awesome, definitely, you all think about this a lot, and I think that's

600
00:32:18,317 --> 00:32:18,657
great.

601
00:32:19,318 --> 00:32:20,118
I did have a question.

602
00:32:20,178 --> 00:32:22,040
One of the pillars you mentioned was your players.

603
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:27,844
I was curious if you'd experimented at all with, I mean, having such a large player base

604
00:32:27,924 --> 00:32:32,447
and mobilizing them directly in any ways, or communicating with them about these initiatives.

605
00:32:33,781 --> 00:32:35,803
About the local initiatives that we are doing,

606
00:32:36,063 --> 00:32:37,805
we didn't do anything around it.

607
00:32:37,845 --> 00:32:41,088
So for us, the players are also the huge unexplored area

608
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:41,769
that we need to do.

609
00:32:42,229 --> 00:32:44,371
The only activity that we did is this one,

610
00:32:44,611 --> 00:32:46,733
and the one with one special day that we just

611
00:32:46,893 --> 00:32:47,594
fundraise for them.

612
00:32:48,575 --> 00:32:53,276
But it was nothing that, so the only activity that involved player like very directly was

613
00:32:53,296 --> 00:32:55,517
the activity for World Child Football Club.

614
00:32:56,077 --> 00:32:59,719
But I think there is like a huge potential there that we can tap into.

615
00:33:00,139 --> 00:33:05,001
But the game studios that did amazing things around this is Riot.

616
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:10,663
They have a few different awesome initiatives, how they involved players with buying different

617
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:12,083
skins and et cetera.

618
00:33:12,103 --> 00:33:15,584
So you can look them up and maybe there is something that can help you out.

619
00:33:15,844 --> 00:33:16,084
Thank you.

620
00:33:16,325 --> 00:33:16,565
Thank you.

621
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:20,965
Okay people, thank you so much.

622
00:33:21,326 --> 00:33:22,890
I'll be in Overlook if you want to chat,

623
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:24,253
and thank you for being here.
