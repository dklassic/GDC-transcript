1
00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:07,565
So I'm Carol Shaw.

2
00:00:07,665 --> 00:00:10,626
I'm going to talk today about reclaiming my soul.

3
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:13,488
And it's really about why it's a very personal talk.

4
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:14,808
It's not a real production talk.

5
00:00:14,828 --> 00:00:17,289
There's not going to be a lot of specific information.

6
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:19,430
You probably won't need to take any notes during this talk.

7
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:22,952
But it's about why I, after working

8
00:00:23,212 --> 00:00:26,033
in free-to-play mobile social games for about four years,

9
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:29,815
decided to stop doing that and go back to work in AAA games.

10
00:00:31,702 --> 00:00:34,405
So I want to be really clear about what this talk is not

11
00:00:34,445 --> 00:00:34,685
about.

12
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:38,128
I'm not going to talk about how trashy and crappy free-to-play

13
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:38,688
games are.

14
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:42,351
I don't actually think that all of them are trashy or crappy.

15
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:46,314
And it's definitely not a statement that people

16
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:49,577
should stop making them and abandon it as a genre.

17
00:00:50,177 --> 00:00:51,699
I think there's a lot of really talented people

18
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:53,860
out there that are trying to make good versions

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,841
of this style of game.

20
00:00:56,102 --> 00:00:58,524
I met a lot of them in my time in that genre

21
00:00:58,564 --> 00:00:59,585
and working in that genre.

22
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:00,786
So you know.

23
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:02,104
It's definitely not that.

24
00:01:03,385 --> 00:01:04,887
In-app purchasing, just a little background.

25
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:06,688
In-app purchasing launched in October of 2009.

26
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:10,411
I started working in mobile free-to-play

27
00:01:10,631 --> 00:01:13,293
in February of 2010, so not too long after that.

28
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:14,797
I worked on a game.

29
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:15,898
My first game was We Rule.

30
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:17,459
We'll talk a little bit more about that.

31
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,723
And it launched on the iPad 1 when that went live

32
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:23,804
on April 3rd of 2010.

33
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:26,066
So about as far back as you could

34
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,548
be making free-to-play games, because it's a super young

35
00:01:28,608 --> 00:01:30,409
genre, I've been doing it.

36
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:32,931
So that's why I have a little bit of experience.

37
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:34,453
Felt like this was a good talk to give.

38
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:36,974
You know, oops.

39
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,836
Back, back, back.

40
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:41,996
Anyway, but I also want to be clear.

41
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:45,058
This isn't a puppy, how cute puppies and kittens

42
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:47,360
and how awesome the free play genre is.

43
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,802
I have a lot of complaints about it.

44
00:01:49,622 --> 00:01:50,543
And I'm going to get into those.

45
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:53,285
I have a lot of things that just kept me up at night.

46
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:54,847
They were things that I questioned

47
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:57,309
about whether this was the kind of game I wanted to be making.

48
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,292
So this is definitely not how much I loved my time

49
00:02:01,472 --> 00:02:02,553
making that type of game.

50
00:02:04,227 --> 00:02:08,110
And really, why did I decide to stop making them?

51
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:11,092
That's a big part of what this talk is going to be about.

52
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:14,255
And a lot of it was because it was keeping me up at night.

53
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:17,117
I was sitting, laying in bed, awake,

54
00:02:17,157 --> 00:02:20,139
and wondering if the types of things

55
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:21,880
that I was doing in the games I was creating

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,322
were actually good experiences for my customers.

57
00:02:29,797 --> 00:02:30,978
The industry was very good to me.

58
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:32,918
Working in that genre was really good.

59
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:35,459
I got to work for a lot of great companies.

60
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:38,080
And I got to make some money, and I

61
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,220
got to learn a lot of new things all the time.

62
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:44,262
But I developed some concerns.

63
00:02:44,502 --> 00:02:48,563
So Laura Lin, when she talks about stopping

64
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:51,584
making social games and moving into different genres,

65
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:53,144
she had a pivot point.

66
00:02:53,204 --> 00:02:55,625
She had a feature somebody asked her to make that she felt.

67
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:58,806
Specifically, she can point to that one feature and say,

68
00:02:59,207 --> 00:03:01,628
that's when she decided to stop doing that type of game.

69
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:03,368
For me, it was more of a slow burn.

70
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:08,791
Took about maybe 15 months or so of really asking myself

71
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:10,111
questions and trying to determine

72
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:12,412
what I wanted to do next.

73
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:15,994
And this is a great example of why

74
00:03:16,054 --> 00:03:18,675
free-to-play social mobile games is not necessarily

75
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:20,175
the right place for me right now.

76
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,881
It isn't specifically about this game,

77
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:25,822
but I am the wrong demographic for this game.

78
00:03:26,182 --> 00:03:28,363
And if I had stayed doing free-to-play mobile games,

79
00:03:28,623 --> 00:03:30,124
I would have had to play this game,

80
00:03:30,264 --> 00:03:31,725
and I would have had to play it for hours.

81
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,426
I would have had to study it.

82
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,227
I would have had to spend a lot of time thinking

83
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:36,808
about how did they monetize.

84
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:38,969
They made a lot of money, and they're still

85
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,110
making money from this game.

86
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,912
I mean, Glue had their quarterly call last week,

87
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:47,074
and this game made 54% of their revenue.

88
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:49,475
Their second game is Deer Hunter, also a game

89
00:03:49,575 --> 00:03:50,936
I'm not a great demographic for.

90
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:57,799
But, I mean, it's phenomenal, but it's also, I felt disingenuous because I don't want to

91
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,520
play this game.

92
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,342
I didn't want to spend my spare time, you know, thinking about Kim Kardashian.

93
00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:03,302
It just wasn't for me.

94
00:04:03,822 --> 00:04:08,064
I know there's probably a lot of people that play it and enjoy it, and I wish them well.

95
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,566
But again, you know, I would have been bored by it.

96
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,567
I didn't want to feel as though...

97
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,129
You know, I was giving my time to something,

98
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,251
and I probably would have had to pay money towards it as well

99
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,173
to get a good idea of what the opportunities for monetization

100
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:21,373
were.

101
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:23,635
And it was more of what would have been a study of business

102
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:25,257
and not really a study of game design.

103
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:29,881
So I wanted to stop playing games.

104
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,583
I wanted to start playing games again and stop studying them.

105
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:36,210
I wanted to do things like go to different tracks.

106
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,412
So for the last couple of years, for all the GDCs,

107
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:40,834
I've gone to the business and marketing talks

108
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,156
and some of the production talks.

109
00:04:42,776 --> 00:04:45,339
But these are the icons for the community, the production,

110
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,319
and the design tracks.

111
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,621
And these were the kinds of talks

112
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:49,342
I really wanted to start going to again.

113
00:04:49,362 --> 00:04:51,664
I didn't have a lot of reason to go to a lot of these talks

114
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:53,126
when I was doing free-to-play games

115
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:54,387
because I'm an executive producer.

116
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,829
And my job is actually to think about how to make money

117
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:57,690
in those types of games.

118
00:04:59,252 --> 00:05:01,313
You know, now I get to go back and kind of go back

119
00:05:01,353 --> 00:05:03,034
to my roots and think about the things

120
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:04,896
that I'm passionate about in game development.

121
00:05:06,577 --> 00:05:10,780
So in my talk description, I said

122
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,501
I would talk about five things that I

123
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,924
found to be frustrating about the free-to-play genre.

124
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:18,426
This is easily the number one thing

125
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:22,048
I found to be very, very frustrating for me.

126
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:24,110
Minimum viable product is.

127
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:27,353
It's a lean startup.

128
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,655
It came from a lean startup.

129
00:05:29,136 --> 00:05:30,939
It's the version of the product which

130
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:33,643
allows a team to collect the maximum amount

131
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:35,906
of validated learning about customers

132
00:05:36,027 --> 00:05:37,108
with the least effort.

133
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,614
Eric Reese is the founder of the Lean Startup Movement.

134
00:05:41,661 --> 00:05:45,646
And I think that this is actually a really great way

135
00:05:45,706 --> 00:05:46,747
to make software.

136
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:49,651
And to me, it wasn't a great way to make games.

137
00:05:49,952 --> 00:05:52,635
I didn't want to turn out any more games that I felt

138
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:54,097
were incomplete on launch day.

139
00:05:54,558 --> 00:05:56,040
I wanted to get to a point where it was a.

140
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,063
You know, it could be reviewed by a critic,

141
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:01,764
and they could actually analyze it.

142
00:06:02,165 --> 00:06:03,566
And the critic wasn't going like, but there's

143
00:06:03,586 --> 00:06:05,147
got to be more, and I know in six months

144
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:06,468
it'll actually be a full game.

145
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,231
So for me, I wanted to move from the idea

146
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:13,394
that there's this circle in the lean startup movement

147
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,535
where you have ideas, and you build, and you code,

148
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,057
and you measure, and you get data back, and you learn,

149
00:06:18,097 --> 00:06:20,900
and you kind of keep iterating on that process all the time.

150
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,762
And they're all fairly equal in importance.

151
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:26,705
You know, for me, I wanted it to look more like this.

152
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,486
I wanted to spend a little bit more time on the upfront side

153
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:31,967
and a little bit less time looking at data

154
00:06:31,987 --> 00:06:34,048
and understanding how to monetize

155
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,590
and how to extend the retention of the game.

156
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,431
So I wanted to focus on, you know, in the future,

157
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:41,672
I want to be focusing much more on ideas

158
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,793
and writing good, solid games.

159
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,554
Like, I want to put out not buggy games.

160
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:48,156
A lot of the social mobile games are, you know, I play them

161
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:50,477
and I'm like, oh my god, did they QA this?

162
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,138
Because I just don't see it.

163
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:53,799
And I don't want to do that.

164
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,921
I want to QA my games and turn out a high quality product.

165
00:06:59,663 --> 00:07:02,225
So this is a sort of embarrassing part

166
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:06,208
of the free to play genre, as fast follows and clones

167
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:08,730
and sometimes outright piracy.

168
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,772
It's a sign I should drink some water.

169
00:07:14,715 --> 00:07:14,875
So.

170
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:21,060
This is a something this is again. It ranks as one of those things that kept me up at night. I didn't want to be

171
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:28,969
Contributing to part of the industry that felt like it was cheating my fellow developers out of their creativity

172
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:35,035
So you know like oops?

173
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,919
So you know all of these games are variations on

174
00:07:39,838 --> 00:07:44,942
you know, this game, Clash of Clans, which was, in fact, a variation of Backyard Monsters

175
00:07:44,962 --> 00:07:45,582
from Facebook.

176
00:07:46,303 --> 00:07:47,604
The Supercell guys are awesome.

177
00:07:47,664 --> 00:07:49,765
I think they made a very high-quality game.

178
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:54,168
They've actually been pretty nice and given credit where credit was due to Backyard Monsters

179
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:54,749
on Facebook.

180
00:07:55,249 --> 00:08:02,154
The disclaimer is, I worked on Backyard Monsters for mobile, so I was very well aware of what

181
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:04,515
it was like to be making a copy of another game.

182
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:12,104
Because in a lot of ways, Backyard Monsters was chasing Clash of Clans, even though Backyard

183
00:08:12,144 --> 00:08:15,009
Monsters had actually come first, but on Facebook.

184
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,811
So for me it was this really interesting experience of knowing that Clash of Clans was number

185
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:24,732
one in the boards, nobody else was beating it, but we were going to try and make a game

186
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:30,513
based on the background of the game and see if we could, you know, beat Clash of Clans

187
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:31,213
at their own game.

188
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:32,713
It wasn't successful.

189
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:36,854
It wasn't a successful game and it was pulled down and it was the last free to play title

190
00:08:36,894 --> 00:08:37,434
I worked on.

191
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:40,595
And I, you know, I learned a lot from it.

192
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:41,475
I had a great team.

193
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:42,295
Again, this is like...

194
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:46,599
Not about the people that make the games, but it's about the kind of games that are getting made.

195
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,643
This is the even seedier underbelly of Fast Follows and clones.

196
00:08:51,843 --> 00:08:54,705
All three of these games have just pretty much been outright cloned.

197
00:08:55,446 --> 00:09:00,130
Dream Heights from Zynga, they did, you know, the Tiny Tower guys did a great thing.

198
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,551
You can go search for it online.

199
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:07,255
That's a, you know, frame by frame of how Dream Heights looked so much like Tiny Tower

200
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,857
and played so much like Tiny Tower.

201
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:10,958
I play a lot of threes.

202
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:12,158
I think it's an awesome game.

203
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,519
And I was sad to see that 2048, which came out afterwards

204
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:17,220
and was very, very similar to it,

205
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,421
just really stomped it, where people just thought

206
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:22,362
2048 was the original game.

207
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:25,603
And I wanted those developers who did threes to actually get.

208
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:27,984
credit for their work.

209
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:30,767
But really, maybe Spryfox was the one

210
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,549
that really pissed me off the most

211
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:34,090
and made me just question the people

212
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,572
that I was working with in the industry.

213
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:39,215
And there was a lawsuit, I think it was settled.

214
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:41,357
I don't know the details about how that happened.

215
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:44,060
But I mean, that was a really frustrating moment

216
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,203
because I love Triple Town and I've given money to that game

217
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,524
and I want it to be successful.

218
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:51,066
I want Spryfox to keep making games.

219
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:55,288
So I don't want other companies to come in and kind of stomp

220
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,688
them by stealing their ideas.

221
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,930
And if there's any one thing that just frustrated me

222
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,690
and kept me up, that was probably

223
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,991
one of the big ones, this slide.

224
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:08,872
All right, so like I said, I'm a producer.

225
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:10,452
And producers think about money.

226
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:13,553
So who knows what this quote is from?

227
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:16,714
Nobody, really?

228
00:10:16,974 --> 00:10:18,195
Star Trek, Lloyd's home.

229
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:23,756
But, well, Scotty said it to Kirk when there was the whales.

230
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,723
But for me, I had to think a lot about whales

231
00:10:28,783 --> 00:10:30,324
because I had to think about how to make money.

232
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:33,248
And for the purposes of this talk,

233
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:35,411
I'm going to use every play came out with a report a couple

234
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:37,693
weeks ago where they defined whales

235
00:10:37,773 --> 00:10:40,196
as people who spend $50 or more per month in a game.

236
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:47,712
And the important part of the statistic for me was that they make up less than 1% of the customer base

237
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:50,455
But they represent 29% of the revenue

238
00:10:51,376 --> 00:10:57,983
You know, that's not something I felt like I wanted to work with like that means as somebody who's trying to create a business

239
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:02,327
I need to focus because it's 29% of my revenue. It's almost a third of my revenue

240
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:05,288
that I need to be considering those players

241
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:06,708
and understanding their motivations

242
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:09,029
and trying to move them in the direction

243
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:11,150
that I want to go and kind of watch that direction.

244
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,170
And I didn't want to do that.

245
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,771
I didn't want to ignore 99% of my customers

246
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:18,232
so that I could pay attention to this 1%

247
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:21,172
so that I could make sure that 30% of the revenue

248
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:21,913
didn't go away.

249
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:28,614
Keep having to unscrew it.

250
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:29,455
Just throw that.

251
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:35,088
So for me, this was a real eye-opening experience.

252
00:11:35,148 --> 00:11:36,768
I want to be able to make games that

253
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:39,690
are going to look out at the whole audience

254
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,211
and understand who they are and be able to cater to all of them

255
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:45,352
and try and give everybody a really delightful, great

256
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:45,892
experience.

257
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:47,953
But when you're working on free-to-play games

258
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,413
and you have to focus on your whales,

259
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:50,634
that can be a huge challenge.

260
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:55,217
Also extremely challenging is user acquisition

261
00:11:55,277 --> 00:11:56,177
and discoverability.

262
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,698
I don't think either of these problems have been solved yet.

263
00:11:59,978 --> 00:12:01,679
I think there's lots of companies

264
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:02,900
and there's been a lot of businesses

265
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,120
created to try and solve both of these problems.

266
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,361
But they're not solved.

267
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:10,663
I still think random games can show up

268
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:12,683
and Apple might think they're awesome and feature them.

269
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:16,046
And there doesn't seem to be any specific way

270
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:17,528
to make that happen for yourself.

271
00:12:17,588 --> 00:12:19,770
Like, I worked for really big developers,

272
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,492
and sometimes we'd get featured and sometimes we wouldn't.

273
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:24,654
And then last week, some friends of mine

274
00:12:24,674 --> 00:12:26,656
that are like four small indie game developers,

275
00:12:26,696 --> 00:12:28,277
their game got featured, and it was awesome.

276
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:29,298
I was super happy for them.

277
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:31,440
But I have no idea how that happens.

278
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,322
So you can't really plan for that.

279
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:36,882
And user acquisition is very expensive.

280
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,683
So this is a slide from Fixoo.

281
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:41,563
It's a little bit old, so it's from September.

282
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,765
But if the average price is between $1.50 and $2

283
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:48,766
for a loyal user, and that's somebody

284
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:51,046
who's going to log in at least three times to your game,

285
00:12:51,427 --> 00:12:53,187
that's a very high cost that you're

286
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:55,548
paying to try and get those customers to see your game.

287
00:12:57,189 --> 00:12:59,951
I think like 300,000 games in the app store right now.

288
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:02,633
So getting seen is really hard.

289
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:05,215
So user acquisition becomes really important.

290
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:10,599
And because no one's really nailed how that works, you have to think a lot about this.

291
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,641
And to me, that wasn't my core competency.

292
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:16,524
It's not what I've spent my career understanding and learning how to do.

293
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:19,506
I like to make games and I like to think about mechanics and game features.

294
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:22,189
how to do production and get products out the door

295
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,191
and make them high quality.

296
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:24,833
This is not that.

297
00:13:25,414 --> 00:13:28,077
Thinking about user acquisition was so far out of my realm

298
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,600
and having to learn about it just wasn't fun for me.

299
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,703
And I appreciate that it's fun for some people,

300
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:34,425
but it really wasn't fun for me

301
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:36,468
and I didn't really wanna spend a lot more time doing it.

302
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,493
I didn't really want to spend a lot more time thinking about the alphabet soup of acronyms.

303
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:48,317
So when I worked at Njimoko, every morning I would get up and I would pour my coffee

304
00:13:48,337 --> 00:13:52,280
and then I would sit down and I would start looking and filling out a chart with all of

305
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,503
these numbers to understand how my overnights were, how my weeklies were.

306
00:13:57,364 --> 00:14:01,026
And again, I didn't come in in the morning and schedule a brainstorm.

307
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:04,829
I didn't come in in the morning and talk to my art director and see what was the newest

308
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:06,710
art for the next content pack release.

309
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:11,574
I sat down and looked at these numbers and that just stopped being fun for me.

310
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:15,516
Like originally I think it was kind of fun and then it became not so fun.

311
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,453
All right, probably the biggest and most important thing for me

312
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:26,096
about the free-to-play market and thinking about what

313
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:29,378
I want to do better, I don't want

314
00:14:29,398 --> 00:14:31,559
to use analytics to drive addictive behavior.

315
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,761
I think it's kind of one of the banes of the industry

316
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:38,744
is that we are able to do things like use A-B testing.

317
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:40,024
So I love this one.

318
00:14:40,104 --> 00:14:42,766
And the key word in this is trying to A-B test your way

319
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:44,067
to a magical product.

320
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:46,749
And it's the magical product that I'm after.

321
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:51,092
But it is impossible, I think, to use A-B testing or true

322
00:14:51,132 --> 00:14:53,173
multivariate testing to try and get

323
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:55,014
to that point of that magical product.

324
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:56,756
It will take you forever.

325
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:59,377
I think that there's a use for A-B testing

326
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:00,918
and a use for multivariate testing.

327
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:03,620
But it's really about how you're going to educate your design.

328
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:06,242
It's never going to solve your problems.

329
00:15:06,502 --> 00:15:07,943
It's only going to help you point out

330
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:09,064
where there are problems.

331
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:11,346
I don't think that's how the industry uses it.

332
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:14,487
I think there's an over-reliance on this type of testing

333
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,488
that can blind an organization to the fundamental

334
00:15:18,848 --> 00:15:20,128
shortcomings in their products.

335
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:23,689
And to me, that's not good.

336
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,470
That's not something I want to be a part of.

337
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,071
I want to see the forest, not just the trees.

338
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:31,607
This is what I like to use data for.

339
00:15:31,707 --> 00:15:33,268
So sorry, this slide's a little washed out.

340
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:36,711
But this is a level distribution slide from WeRule.

341
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:39,613
And to me, when we pulled this data

342
00:15:39,653 --> 00:15:41,515
and it came along with a lot of additional data

343
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:42,916
about what actually was happening

344
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:43,997
at these specific levels.

345
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:46,759
But you can tell that there's like a huge peak of people

346
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,599
that are stuck at level 39.

347
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:49,961
This is when we had the levels go up to 50,

348
00:15:50,302 --> 00:15:51,102
eventually they went up to 80.

349
00:15:53,315 --> 00:15:55,596
And this was a pretty important thing.

350
00:15:55,616 --> 00:15:56,836
We looked at this, we compared it

351
00:15:56,876 --> 00:15:59,137
with when we thought people were churning out of the game.

352
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:02,258
And we actually used this to modify the game to make it

353
00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:04,179
hopefully more fun for players.

354
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:06,880
We didn't actually even look at how it impacted revenue.

355
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,541
Like, I have no idea if the people at level 39

356
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:12,702
actually paid their way, if this was a paywall

357
00:16:12,742 --> 00:16:13,703
that they paid their way out of.

358
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,463
Because we just didn't look at it for that.

359
00:16:16,464 --> 00:16:19,345
And I'm happy that we didn't look at it for that, because I want to think in terms of

360
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:24,586
how to solve these problems for what the customer is experiencing, and, you know, could we have

361
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:25,647
made more money off of that?

362
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:26,407
Maybe.

363
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:30,748
But again, you know, I didn't want to use the data for that.

364
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:33,789
I wanted to use it to help make a more delightful experience for my customers.

365
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,750
I work at Telltale Games now.

366
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:39,491
We make episodic narrative games like The Walking Dead.

367
00:16:39,511 --> 00:16:43,913
We're working on a Game of Thrones game as well, which is very exciting.

368
00:16:45,523 --> 00:16:49,804
But with Telltale, we specifically don't use any data

369
00:16:49,864 --> 00:16:51,865
to drive addictive behavior at the company.

370
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:57,167
This is an example of the choices screen that you see.

371
00:16:57,187 --> 00:16:59,107
Has anybody played a Telltale game?

372
00:16:59,767 --> 00:16:59,968
Yeah?

373
00:17:00,148 --> 00:17:00,448
Oh, good.

374
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:00,768
Awesome.

375
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:04,437
So at the end of the game, you see the choices screen.

376
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:07,058
And while the designers and while the producers

377
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:09,359
can look at this and kind of understand the branches

378
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,220
and where people went down the game path,

379
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,701
what we really hope it does is tell the player,

380
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:17,262
hey, there's this other way you could have played the game.

381
00:17:17,442 --> 00:17:19,503
Maybe you want to go back and play it that way too.

382
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:22,764
A lot of other people maybe tried a different path than you.

383
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:24,805
We're premium games.

384
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:26,786
We don't make any money if they replay our game.

385
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:27,826
It doesn't matter to us.

386
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,407
All that matters is that we think

387
00:17:29,427 --> 00:17:30,908
that they're going to enjoy the experience.

388
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:34,122
if they replay it and kind of go down another branching path.

389
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:40,200
It also helps us build community,

390
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:42,562
which is something I've always been passionate about,

391
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:44,264
is having community built around games.

392
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:48,408
And this is a great way to start conversations on the boards,

393
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,029
because people will come in and say,

394
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,671
oh, I didn't choose this path.

395
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:53,032
What was your experience doing that?

396
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:55,855
And it just sort of fosters conversation

397
00:17:55,915 --> 00:17:59,999
and interesting explorations of what the game can be

398
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,120
if you play it a different way.

399
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:05,858
Another thing I really like is achievements.

400
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,719
So I've been playing a lot of Two Dots, which

401
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:08,980
is a free-to-play puzzle game.

402
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,541
It's probably my favorite free-to-play game.

403
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:14,102
And I've given them money, so I've monetized in that game.

404
00:18:14,842 --> 00:18:15,723
I think it's a great game.

405
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:19,024
I recommend that you go check it out and have fun with it.

406
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:20,885
You can totally play it without spending any money,

407
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:24,787
or you can spend a little money and get some cool power-ups

408
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:25,207
and stuff.

409
00:18:26,383 --> 00:18:30,045
No game is ever going to be made or broken on whether you include achievements with your

410
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:30,265
game.

411
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:31,626
Like, it's just a fact.

412
00:18:32,126 --> 00:18:37,269
It's not going to make a good game better, and it's not going to make a bad game worse.

413
00:18:37,469 --> 00:18:41,431
It's just a thing that you can include that some of your customers will enjoy.

414
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:46,934
I think it's a fun way to introduce humor, where even if your game doesn't have humor,

415
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:49,835
you can make humorous achievements that people can talk about.

416
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,116
And again, this is another way that you can foster community.

417
00:18:54,024 --> 00:18:57,705
And, you know, it forms another bond between you and your customer, and it forms a bond

418
00:18:57,745 --> 00:18:58,505
between the players.

419
00:18:58,565 --> 00:19:02,606
So on this one, I didn't take a screenshot, but you can flip over to the other players

420
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:06,388
tab and sort of see what your friends have been doing, so you can connect on Facebook

421
00:19:06,408 --> 00:19:06,888
in this game.

422
00:19:07,828 --> 00:19:11,189
And they also do a nice thing where you, when you're leveling up in the game, you see your

423
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,150
friends, sort of like Candy Crush does.

424
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:14,310
But again...

425
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:19,260
This for me is a great way to use data because what it does is it motivates the player to

426
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,082
have more fun.

427
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:24,090
And that's really what I want to spend my time using data with and I don't want to spend

428
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:24,651
as much time

429
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,839
using my data to figure out how to monetize my customers.

430
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:30,280
In fact, if I didn't have to use the word monetize ever again,

431
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,600
I'd be pretty happy.

432
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,921
Also, I think that this may be the last time I publicly

433
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:37,101
have to use the word funnel.

434
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:39,882
I never want to use that term again, either.

435
00:19:40,082 --> 00:19:43,363
And I think that I understand why they exist,

436
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:45,783
and I understand why people chase them down.

437
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:48,264
But again, I don't want to put my customers in a funnel.

438
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:53,130
So this is a slide I did a few years ago for a talk I gave

439
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,931
about how awesome data was and how you should use it

440
00:19:56,591 --> 00:20:00,133
to manage your funnels and monetize your customers.

441
00:20:01,353 --> 00:20:02,534
And I've circled a couple of things,

442
00:20:02,554 --> 00:20:04,554
it's really hard to read, I'll post my slides up later.

443
00:20:05,395 --> 00:20:09,917
But these are the things that I take with me going forward as the important pieces of

444
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:11,897
data that I would like to continue using.

445
00:20:12,398 --> 00:20:16,960
I'm super curious about engagement, like where do my customers turn out of my game, like

446
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,721
where are the problem points that I want to try and resolve.

447
00:20:20,481 --> 00:20:22,123
That's something I'll always want to understand.

448
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:25,167
I think user segmentation is pretty interesting,

449
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:27,189
like who are my customers, who's playing my game.

450
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:30,553
And I actually am a huge, huge fan of player relations.

451
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:32,555
Like again, I like building community,

452
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:35,539
but I also feel like you should build a good customer service

453
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,421
organization, particularly if you're

454
00:20:37,441 --> 00:20:38,783
doing some sort of free-to-play game,

455
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:40,384
but really for any type of game.

456
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:43,469
So that kind of leads me to what I've learned

457
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:44,930
and what I will take with me.

458
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,830
Some of the data points that I review

459
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:49,991
are things that I'll take with me.

460
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:52,031
But some of the other learnings I have

461
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,791
are really around things like demographics.

462
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:56,052
In the four years that I was working

463
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:57,232
on free-to-play mobile games,

464
00:20:57,752 --> 00:21:00,073
I saw the demographics shift pretty radically.

465
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:02,893
Like a lot more people play games than used to play before

466
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,133
and a lot more different types of people play games

467
00:21:05,194 --> 00:21:05,894
than did before.

468
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:07,514
And going back to work on...

469
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,775
a series like The Walking Dead or Game of Thrones,

470
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:13,537
that might be something that you would not

471
00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:15,718
consider that lots of different types of people would play.

472
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:18,300
But a lot of people watch the Game of Thrones.

473
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,940
And I expect that there's going to be

474
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,881
a lot of people across different age groups

475
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:24,183
and across the genders that are going to play this game.

476
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,465
I particularly have enjoyed seeing more women playing games, and I think that that's something

477
00:21:30,485 --> 00:21:34,429
I'm going to always keep in mind and make sure that developers are continuing to push

478
00:21:34,469 --> 00:21:35,430
in that direction as well.

479
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:39,794
This is one of the greatest transitions or time periods our industry has gone through.

480
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:46,344
Another big piece for me has been looking at how games are

481
00:21:46,424 --> 00:21:46,804
sold.

482
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:48,586
So I do a lot of online work.

483
00:21:48,626 --> 00:21:50,347
I'm an online producer, primarily.

484
00:21:51,148 --> 00:21:53,190
I think about how to connect users to each other

485
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,491
and connect them to my games.

486
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:58,555
But I also think about how to sell games and distribute them.

487
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:02,158
The shift between digital and physical goods

488
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:03,820
has been pretty radical through the years.

489
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,161
It's kind of hard to read.

490
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:05,902
It's from between 2010 and 2013.

491
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:11,946
And so it's getting to be where there's more digital sales

492
00:22:12,007 --> 00:22:13,207
than there are physical sales.

493
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:15,229
And I think that'll continue.

494
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,731
I don't think physical games are necessarily gonna go away.

495
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:19,572
I'm definitely not of that camp.

496
00:22:20,393 --> 00:22:22,034
But I do feel like digital distribution

497
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:24,756
is a huge opportunity to get to more customers.

498
00:22:24,796 --> 00:22:26,518
And I think mobile has driven that a lot.

499
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:30,984
And that's something that, you know, particularly when I went to Telltale, I thought was interesting

500
00:22:31,004 --> 00:22:33,868
because they do primarily digital distribution throughout the season.

501
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:37,914
And then when the season's over, they create a physical disc that they also distribute.

502
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:40,177
So it's kind of the best of both worlds for me.

503
00:22:41,979 --> 00:22:49,101
And probably the last thing that I will take with me, so this is a funny, it says hopeful

504
00:22:49,141 --> 00:22:52,443
parents at the bottom, they're watching their child play video games and thinking about

505
00:22:52,463 --> 00:22:56,624
his bright future as a video game player of mostly Super Mario, I think.

506
00:22:57,661 --> 00:23:02,104
And for me, I wanted to think about what my career path was.

507
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:05,186
I mean, I've been in the industry for over 10 years.

508
00:23:05,706 --> 00:23:08,408
Before that, I did stuff on the web and online industry

509
00:23:08,468 --> 00:23:09,909
for another six years.

510
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:12,871
So I've been doing tech since like 95, I think.

511
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:16,093
So I'm always thinking about what's next

512
00:23:16,173 --> 00:23:18,674
and how to decide what I want to do next.

513
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:24,769
Excuse me.

514
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,072
When I first started looking at video game companies,

515
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,013
I looked at the games that I loved

516
00:23:30,193 --> 00:23:31,474
and that I wanted to play more of.

517
00:23:32,215 --> 00:23:33,856
The Sims and SimCity were the first games

518
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:36,518
that I played that I stayed up all night playing.

519
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:40,300
So, sorry, a little dry this morning.

520
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:48,748
So for me, going to Maxis and working on games like SimCity 4 and The Sims 2 and Spore were

521
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:49,369
no brainers.

522
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:51,932
I felt very passionate about those games.

523
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:53,754
I loved the creative aspect.

524
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:55,015
I loved the community aspect.

525
00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:58,239
It was a really easy decision for me to go there because it was my passion.

526
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:00,121
It was very easy for me to follow my passion.

527
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:03,347
And then I went and worked on a bunch of these free-to-play

528
00:24:03,387 --> 00:24:03,647
games.

529
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:06,388
So there's up tops the Enchimoko games and the KickSide game

530
00:24:06,408 --> 00:24:06,889
at the bottom.

531
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:09,530
And I didn't ever feel the same kind of passion.

532
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,052
What I did feel was this excitement

533
00:24:12,152 --> 00:24:16,134
and this just general wonder at all of the new information

534
00:24:16,174 --> 00:24:17,435
that was always coming my way.

535
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,217
It's a great and vibrant new industry.

536
00:24:20,777 --> 00:24:23,078
And with that brings a lot of interesting new learnings.

537
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:24,639
But I never felt all that passionate.

538
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,140
It was like that Kim Kardashian game.

539
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,581
Like, I just didn't want to play it.

540
00:24:27,721 --> 00:24:30,543
I didn't leave work and want to go home and play my own games.

541
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:34,879
And when I started looking around for companies to join,

542
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:37,181
I realized I was playing a lot of The Wolf Among Us,

543
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:40,603
which I am, again, like it was kind of a weird game.

544
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:42,444
I'm not a big Fables comic book fan.

545
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:44,025
I'm actually not a big comics person.

546
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:46,232
Hopefully that won't get me thrown out of the games

547
00:24:46,272 --> 00:24:46,652
industry.

548
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:49,914
But I loved The Wolf Among Us.

549
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:52,515
I just thought it was a really interesting game.

550
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:54,476
It had some interesting characters in it.

551
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:56,257
I loved seeing the branching storylines.

552
00:24:56,777 --> 00:24:58,158
And then when Game of Thrones was announced,

553
00:24:58,178 --> 00:25:00,379
I am a huge nerd about the Game of Thrones books.

554
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,020
I've been reading them for years and years

555
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:03,461
before the show came out.

556
00:25:03,521 --> 00:25:04,982
So it was kind of a no-brainer for me

557
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:06,503
to kind of go and apply there.

558
00:25:06,523 --> 00:25:08,584
And one of the great things about it is I

559
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:10,325
feel like I'm following my passion again.

560
00:25:10,345 --> 00:25:11,706
I feel like, you know.

561
00:25:12,506 --> 00:25:16,609
If there's one thing I will take away from my time doing free to play, it's that I didn't

562
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:19,432
feel passionate about it and I really wanted to feel that way.

563
00:25:19,472 --> 00:25:22,914
I think when you do game development, you've got to love what you're doing or it's just

564
00:25:22,994 --> 00:25:24,456
not going to be genuine.

565
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:29,920
So we are ‑‑ oh, wow, I am four seconds short of 25 minutes.

566
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,761
It's amazing.

567
00:25:32,522 --> 00:25:33,443
We have to get out of this room.

568
00:25:33,483 --> 00:25:34,544
There's another talk in here at 12.05.

569
00:25:35,144 --> 00:25:38,207
I'm going to go hang out in the wrap‑up room, which is in 5.05, if you want to come

570
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:38,567
talk to me.

571
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:39,628
Thanks very much.

572
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:52,407
you
