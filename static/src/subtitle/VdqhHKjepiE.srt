1
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:09,282
Hello, everybody, and thank you very much for coming.

2
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:13,186
I'm Tynan Silvester, and today I'm

3
00:00:13,206 --> 00:00:16,610
going to be going over RimWorld, Contrarian, Ridiculous,

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,012
and Impossible game design methods.

5
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:21,995
But for those of you who might not be as familiar with it,

6
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,037
I just want to run the trailer and tell you

7
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:24,658
a little bit about it.

8
00:00:26,788 --> 00:00:29,989
So RimWorld is a space colony simulator

9
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:32,450
in which you land on a distant planet

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,251
and it's sort of a space western

11
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:38,432
and you construct your base.

12
00:00:40,492 --> 00:00:43,073
You farm stuff and your characters interact,

13
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:46,014
you'll trade, they develop relationships,

14
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:47,554
they fall in love, they fall out of love,

15
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:49,855
they have ex-breakup fights

16
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:52,296
and go to each other's weddings and get drunk

17
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:54,136
and do things they probably shouldn't do.

18
00:00:55,017 --> 00:00:56,197
And over time you develop a base.

19
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,065
and continue in that direction.

20
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:00,946
So,

21
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:08,910
with the design of RoomWorld, I tried really hard to approach the problem in a different way than

22
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,492
what I saw as the usual. So today I'm going to talk about some of those contrarian

23
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,993
approaches and the beliefs that make them possible.

24
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,165
The core idea here is not about what to do specifically,

25
00:01:19,826 --> 00:01:22,747
but rather how to change the mental framing

26
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:26,850
of design problems to try to find new solutions.

27
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,772
Because if you frame a problem in the same way

28
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:32,273
as is automatic and common and typical,

29
00:01:32,954 --> 00:01:35,335
then often you will get the same answers as everyone else.

30
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,517
But if you frame a problem in a new way,

31
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:40,178
valuable new answers can arise.

32
00:01:40,238 --> 00:01:42,280
So, on to RimWorld.

33
00:01:43,872 --> 00:01:46,494
One of Emerald's greatest inspirations is, obviously,

34
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:47,274
Dwarf Fortress.

35
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:49,396
So hats off to Tarn Adams for that one.

36
00:01:50,357 --> 00:01:54,040
But I wasn't actually inspired by playing Dwarf Fortress

37
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,522
as much as I was inspired, because I can barely

38
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:59,444
play Dwarf Fortress, as much as I was inspired by the stories

39
00:01:59,504 --> 00:02:01,245
people created from Dwarf Fortress.

40
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:04,868
Players have used Dwarf Fortress as a storytelling tool.

41
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:09,647
by playing lawn games and writing down what goes on

42
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:11,708
and recording the events, taking screenshots

43
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:15,331
and embellishing it all with poems and stories and art.

44
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:17,012
So some of you might have heard of stories

45
00:02:17,052 --> 00:02:18,873
like Boat Murdered or Gem Clawed.

46
00:02:19,774 --> 00:02:23,476
And these are epic tales of creation and destruction

47
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:27,299
and humor and victory and ambition and tragedy

48
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,302
and interpersonal tension and alcoholism.

49
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:34,404
And this fascinated me because

50
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:36,587
The emotions are so varied.

51
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:40,128
I've long believed that games attract us

52
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:42,289
because they yield emotional experiences

53
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:43,829
that people find fulfilling.

54
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:46,170
And I think classically, games deliver

55
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,530
what I call the arcade emotions, which are basically

56
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:55,272
suspense, triumph, and defeat, and the emotional sphere

57
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:55,872
surrounding those.

58
00:02:56,212 --> 00:02:59,013
But in Dwarf Fortress stories, the emotions were much broader.

59
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:02,633
They were the emotions of story, and character, and empathy.

60
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:08,002
Like the feeling of discovering a character is jovial or evil or prideful.

61
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:10,103
There's an emotion to discovering who someone is.

62
00:03:10,563 --> 00:03:14,444
Or pride in seeing an evil character reverse themselves and become good.

63
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:17,805
Or disappointment when a good character does the opposite.

64
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:24,866
Laughter at absurdities, anger at injustices, and worry over wounded friends.

65
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:31,788
And these kinds of feelings speak to deeply ingrained human needs that go beyond skill

66
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:32,528
and competition.

67
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:36,007
And so why did so few games seem to be

68
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:38,889
yielding these experiences in a systematic way?

69
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:40,571
I think part of it is social momentum.

70
00:03:40,591 --> 00:03:43,713
I mean, back in the 80s, you had arcade game designers,

71
00:03:43,873 --> 00:03:45,294
they wanted to get people to put quarters in,

72
00:03:45,374 --> 00:03:46,575
and so a great way to do that

73
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:48,096
is to make an infinite difficulty game

74
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:49,718
that anyone can start out playing,

75
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:51,039
but no one can ever finish.

76
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,200
They absorb any level of skill,

77
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:55,982
and they take in money by selling you lives and continues.

78
00:03:56,723 --> 00:03:57,724
And a lot has changed since then.

79
00:03:58,526 --> 00:04:01,067
But I think we're still living in a design culture

80
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,148
that echoes that founder effect, those founding ideas.

81
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:09,629
Even the name of what we're doing here,

82
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:12,010
games, it's the Game Developers Conference.

83
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,231
Even that has assumptions embedded into it.

84
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:18,592
Typically, if you talk to people about games,

85
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:22,333
games mean competition, victory, triumph, defeat.

86
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:30,181
The word game does not refer to the emotions of picking strawberries with your child, or

87
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:36,203
going to the beach, or laughing at some comical misfortune, or the pride of creating a story.

88
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:42,384
So when someone says, I'm going to make a game, before deciding anything else, they've

89
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:43,964
already set a mental frame on the problem.

90
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:50,366
And if not careful, they've potentially subscribed to a set of assumptions that could limit them.

91
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:52,548
And of course, I'm not the first to notice this.

92
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:55,170
So we do hear a lot about doing narrative in games,

93
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,991
and this is a really good impulse.

94
00:04:57,532 --> 00:04:59,593
Often, though, this means importing other assumptions

95
00:04:59,693 --> 00:05:02,636
from books or movies and sort of ramming them together

96
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:05,057
with games and kind of doing the two side by side.

97
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:08,540
So, and even then, saying, I'm gonna make a story

98
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:11,062
is just as much of a cognitive prison

99
00:05:11,142 --> 00:05:12,303
as saying, I'm gonna make a game.

100
00:05:12,924 --> 00:05:14,044
But what I saw with Dwarf Fortress

101
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,205
and the stories that it's created

102
00:05:15,886 --> 00:05:18,928
is a glimpse outside these constraints.

103
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:24,264
So from very early on, I said specifically and explicitly

104
00:05:24,644 --> 00:05:25,805
that RimWorld is not a game.

105
00:05:26,805 --> 00:05:27,505
It's not a game.

106
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:28,646
RimWorld is not a game.

107
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:30,186
And I have to keep repeating it,

108
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:31,987
and I have for years, like a mantra,

109
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:33,668
because it reframes everything,

110
00:05:34,148 --> 00:05:36,509
and it's so easy to slip back into the game framing.

111
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:38,430
Nor is RimWorld a story.

112
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,330
I'm not here to tell a story.

113
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,931
The game is not there to tell a story.

114
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:45,272
RimWorld is a story generator.

115
00:05:46,502 --> 00:05:49,844
The player interacts with it and stories emerge from that interaction.

116
00:05:50,544 --> 00:05:54,026
So let's look at examples of how this reframes some design decisions.

117
00:05:55,747 --> 00:05:56,107
First one.

118
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,489
One common complaint

119
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:00,130
among RimWorld

120
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,272
players who are really skilled is that they play really well,

121
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:08,054
but they still get their face beaten by the game.

122
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:10,616
And they feel this is unfair because

123
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:12,157
they think that

124
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:16,391
their skill should be rewarded with commensurate success.

125
00:06:17,613 --> 00:06:18,694
And since this comes up so often,

126
00:06:18,714 --> 00:06:20,256
I've actually named it the skill test assumption.

127
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:22,118
It's the assumption that skill

128
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:23,439
should be rewarded proportionally.

129
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,662
And this seems kind of obvious, right?

130
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:30,087
Like, the player's more skilled, so they have more success.

131
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:31,989
But hold on.

132
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:34,071
It's not a game.

133
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,420
It's not about winning and losing.

134
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:38,241
Success isn't assumed.

135
00:06:38,562 --> 00:06:39,442
It's not even important.

136
00:06:40,202 --> 00:06:42,003
Stories can end in success or failure

137
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:43,684
and still be great stories.

138
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:48,307
Every tragedy from Romeo and Juliet to Ex Machina

139
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:53,289
ends in horrifying failure and loss for the protagonist,

140
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,110
but those tragedies are rich

141
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,131
and moving emotional experiences.

142
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,333
I mean, imagine applying the skill test assumption to.

143
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:06,833
stories, like a movie. Imagine a movie where the protagonist gets exactly their

144
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:10,194
rewards proportional to his skill level.

145
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:18,017
I don't think it would be a great movie. I think this is the opposite of a good story, but it's exactly what a classical game is supposed to be.

146
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:26,459
In writing, they'll teach you that one basic principle of good stories is that the protagonist pushes against some challenge

147
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:30,280
and gets an unexpected, disproportionate pushback.

148
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:32,302
So you look at examples.

149
00:07:33,342 --> 00:07:34,323
The movie The Matrix.

150
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:38,525
Neo is exploring the mystery of the Matrix.

151
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:39,446
He doesn't even know what it is.

152
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:41,407
And suddenly he wakes up in a tube of goo

153
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:43,569
with wires down his throat.

154
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:45,390
That's a disproportionate pushback.

155
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,692
In Star Wars, Luke is basically just bored

156
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:49,832
and he doesn't like the Empire

157
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,493
and he wants to help out against it.

158
00:07:52,194 --> 00:07:54,355
And he ends up holding a laser sword fighting a dark lord.

159
00:07:55,616 --> 00:07:58,358
An alien, Ripley's crew, looking to make a few extra bucks

160
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:00,439
from some distress signal, and they're

161
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:04,581
hunted by a xenomorph, by a weapon, perfect organism,

162
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:05,581
that's going to kill them.

163
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:07,602
And this is the opposite of the skill test assumption.

164
00:08:07,642 --> 00:08:09,643
So I think we have to choose.

165
00:08:10,124 --> 00:08:12,925
If we're going to make an accurate skill testing game,

166
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:18,008
we cannot generate a good story, at least not in the mechanics.

167
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:20,269
Games with split story and gameplay

168
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:22,930
can do this, because the scripted story.

169
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,472
presents the unexpected pushback against the characters,

170
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,894
while the individual game mechanics challenges

171
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:30,396
reward the player's skill.

172
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:33,738
It's like a back and forth structure.

173
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,981
But with the game generating the whole story

174
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:38,743
top to bottom, characters and all,

175
00:08:39,323 --> 00:08:42,386
initialization and conclusion, it doesn't work anymore.

176
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,668
So that's why while RimWorld does acknowledge player skill,

177
00:08:44,728 --> 00:08:46,329
and we do try to reward it in many ways,

178
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,282
The game is very deliberately willing to harm players

179
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:53,262
who are even playing well.

180
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:54,743
Because if it couldn't,

181
00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:56,984
I think it would be badly hobbled as a story generator.

182
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:02,167
Another aspect of RimWorld that makes it work

183
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:05,789
without matching player rewards to skill

184
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:06,690
is how it handles failure.

185
00:09:08,511 --> 00:09:09,191
To have tension,

186
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:12,933
I think a game has to threaten the player

187
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:14,414
with some sort of consequence.

188
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:15,875
That's what's in the balance.

189
00:09:16,663 --> 00:09:19,245
In classic games, this is, the game is over,

190
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:20,766
or you failed the skill test.

191
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:23,488
And this makes sense, because these games

192
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:24,489
are all about testing skill.

193
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,290
Once you've failed the skill test,

194
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:29,472
the question is answered, the test is done,

195
00:09:29,492 --> 00:09:30,933
there's nothing else to find out.

196
00:09:31,994 --> 00:09:32,655
Stories are different.

197
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:34,876
In a story, attention is maintained

198
00:09:34,896 --> 00:09:36,478
by threatening things that the characters care about,

199
00:09:36,838 --> 00:09:38,119
not by threatening to end the story.

200
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:40,260
So in RimWorld, when things go wrong,

201
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,142
they're designed to go wrong such that

202
00:09:42,502 --> 00:09:45,144
the player loses some story element that they care about.

203
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,400
like a pet or a loved one, but the game isn't ended.

204
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,280
We just keep going.

205
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,360
We play it out.

206
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,821
And this works because the player's invested

207
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:54,341
in these things.

208
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:56,621
In StarCraft, you don't really care about

209
00:09:57,162 --> 00:09:58,422
any one of your Marines, right?

210
00:09:58,922 --> 00:10:00,222
There's nothing to make you care about them,

211
00:10:00,522 --> 00:10:02,203
except insofar as they can help you win.

212
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:03,803
All you really want is victory.

213
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:08,564
But in RimWorld, you care about your characters

214
00:10:08,604 --> 00:10:09,465
because you've gotten to know them.

215
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:12,105
And losing even a character who might be kind of useless

216
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,506
in terms of victory can still be

217
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:15,286
a little bit heart-wrenching.

218
00:10:17,336 --> 00:10:18,477
And losing things is a good story.

219
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,179
Losing things is emotional, it's powerful.

220
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,161
It sets up the stakes for later on.

221
00:10:24,022 --> 00:10:27,605
You remember Psycho, the movie.

222
00:10:28,246 --> 00:10:29,727
It starts out with the woman.

223
00:10:30,768 --> 00:10:33,150
She goes out to the hotel, she's looking for something,

224
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,572
and she gets stabbed to death

225
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:37,094
like a third of the way through the movie.

226
00:10:37,814 --> 00:10:39,276
And you all think that she's the protagonist.

227
00:10:40,677 --> 00:10:41,978
But the story doesn't end.

228
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,340
It just goes on with other characters.

229
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:47,122
And the fact that she got stabbed and killed

230
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:48,744
raises the stakes later on.

231
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:52,407
And that's how RimWorld handles failure.

232
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:53,828
So here are some examples, specifically,

233
00:10:54,048 --> 00:10:54,949
like of game mechanics.

234
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:56,290
When the raiders win a battle,

235
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,191
they don't just keep going relentlessly

236
00:10:58,311 --> 00:10:59,572
and massacre everyone in the base

237
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:00,753
after they've broken your defenses.

238
00:11:01,073 --> 00:11:03,575
They used to do this, but in later versions,

239
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:06,978
We discovered that if the raiders become satisfied

240
00:11:07,018 --> 00:11:10,879
with kidnapping somebody or stealing some of your stuff

241
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:12,939
and leaving, they leave you to recover,

242
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,640
you can rebuild and you know the stakes

243
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,680
next time they're coming after you.

244
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:18,901
Even if your whole base burns down,

245
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:21,142
you can rebuild a new one right next to the ruins

246
00:11:21,502 --> 00:11:22,062
or in the ruins.

247
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:23,802
If your colony's in a poor state,

248
00:11:24,903 --> 00:11:27,443
your characters get low expectations mood bonuses

249
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:30,044
so they can continue to function at a lower wealth level

250
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:32,385
without the creature comforts of a rich base.

251
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:34,964
and that lets you have some space to recover

252
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:36,325
without everyone just falling apart.

253
00:11:37,486 --> 00:11:38,567
And when things go really bad,

254
00:11:38,587 --> 00:11:40,909
the player can even flee their base in a caravan

255
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:42,070
and go somewhere else entirely.

256
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,211
And we've just emergently created

257
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:45,592
that old Western story trope

258
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:47,854
where the protagonist flees their village

259
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:48,915
that's burning behind them

260
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:50,376
with their family dead or enslaved,

261
00:11:51,217 --> 00:11:53,959
looking to get revenge or start a new life

262
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,720
for whatever goal they might choose.

263
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:57,922
It's the same as when Luke's parents

264
00:11:57,962 --> 00:11:59,223
got roasted at the start of A New Hope.

265
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:00,964
I call this

266
00:12:01,923 --> 00:12:07,125
elastic failure, because instead of failure being a brick wall that you run into and shatter

267
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:11,226
on, it's something that stretches the failure state.

268
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:15,647
You enter a deeper and deeper failure state, and those failure states tend to be very dramatic

269
00:12:15,928 --> 00:12:20,049
and very storyful, because it's in the process of failure and the process of perhaps recovering

270
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:24,750
from that, that if we can stretch that out, that produces those dramatic situations.

271
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:31,493
Another example of applying the story generator concept is RimWorld's approach to game visuals.

272
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:35,125
So typically, I think when we evaluate game graphics,

273
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:36,565
the most obvious way to do it is to say,

274
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:37,266
how good do they look?

275
00:12:37,826 --> 00:12:39,306
How clearly do they communicate gameplay?

276
00:12:39,746 --> 00:12:42,827
And these are generally pretty good criteria.

277
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:45,068
But if you're making a story generator,

278
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:45,888
the frame is different.

279
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:48,009
What purpose do the visuals serve?

280
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,970
To communicate the story.

281
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,671
They don't have to look detailed to do that,

282
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:54,992
or beautiful or realistic.

283
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:57,913
In fact, it might be better if they were less detailed,

284
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,113
less beautiful and less realistic.

285
00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:02,806
Because a story is not a sequence of images,

286
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:04,747
it's a sequence of events.

287
00:13:05,688 --> 00:13:08,209
Images are just one means of communicating those events.

288
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:09,409
But there are others.

289
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,631
When you read a novel,

290
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:14,532
or you listen to a friend tell you a story verbally,

291
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:16,513
your mind fills with the situations

292
00:13:16,573 --> 00:13:17,834
and the characters and the emotion.

293
00:13:18,354 --> 00:13:19,174
And you feel the story.

294
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:21,796
And those situations and characters and emotions

295
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:23,877
are what the story generator's trying to create.

296
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,037
And none of them are visual.

297
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,339
So all that stuff on the screen, it's not the end product.

298
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,991
The end product is the understanding and emotions

299
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:34,274
and internal experience of creating and enjoying that story.

300
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:37,376
So Rimworld's graphics don't actually attempt

301
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:41,139
to look maximally beautiful, or realistic, or detailed.

302
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,042
I think of Rimworld graphics as a system of symbols,

303
00:13:45,883 --> 00:13:47,344
like Asian characters a little bit,

304
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:48,485
or icons on your phone,

305
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,887
and they represent abstracted objects.

306
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:54,090
To me, Rimworld graphics are as important

307
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,170
as the typeface on a novel.

308
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:56,852
It can be better or worse.

309
00:13:57,743 --> 00:14:03,466
But in the end, I don't care, except in terms of how effectively it transmits the story into the player's mind.

310
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:09,528
So, how do we do that specifically? In RimWorld, this is what I tried to hit.

311
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:14,770
Number one, not ugly. If it's painful to look at, or it looks awful on video,

312
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,712
you're not going to sell that many games because it's just ugly.

313
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,452
It's actually unpleasant to look at.

314
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:26,314
So we try to definitely at least reach the threshold of beauty where you can look at it without psychic suffering.

315
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:30,669
uh... easily identifiable visual characteristics have to be very easily

316
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,090
to identify for what they represent

317
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:33,771
this is in conflict with

318
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:35,673
conflict with abstraction a little bit

319
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:40,176
it makes it easier for new players to to play or for people watch a video or trailer

320
00:14:40,576 --> 00:14:41,556
and understand what's going on

321
00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:42,457
which is important

322
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:44,739
minimal noise

323
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,441
making the graphics really simple

324
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,502
reduces the noise in the image

325
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:53,344
and that reduces the cognitive load

326
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:54,425
to read the image

327
00:14:56,772 --> 00:15:00,075
An image with a lot of detail everywhere might be beautiful,

328
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:02,437
but when you're talking about a game like RimWorld

329
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:04,619
with potentially hundreds and hundreds of objects

330
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,641
on the screen, scanning through that with your eyes

331
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:09,103
and finding what matters to you becomes harder and harder

332
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:10,024
the more details in there.

333
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:12,346
Intensity hierarchy.

334
00:15:12,386 --> 00:15:16,350
This is one way of helping people determine visually

335
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,911
what is important and what is not.

336
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:21,958
So it's essentially a hierarchy of what you call

337
00:15:22,018 --> 00:15:24,719
visual intensity, to draw the eye more strongly towards

338
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:27,259
things that are story relevant and let the eye

339
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,640
slide over things that matter less.

340
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,201
As a simple example, characters and buildings in the game

341
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:36,082
have solid black outlines, but plants have dark green

342
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,522
outlines or no outlines at all.

343
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:39,563
And this means that plants tend to blend

344
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,703
in the background slightly.

345
00:15:41,603 --> 00:15:43,224
You can still see them, it's not difficult,

346
00:15:43,544 --> 00:15:44,664
but the characters really pop out.

347
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:46,285
So if there's a big field of trees,

348
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,031
and one character on it.

349
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:50,431
The character is, looks like he's in the foreground.

350
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:53,473
And the plants are all sort of smeared together.

351
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:55,453
And it draws your eye there.

352
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:58,214
And the same is true of items, gold, food,

353
00:15:58,674 --> 00:15:59,555
all have black outlines.

354
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:01,615
Plants, no.

355
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:03,136
Second to last, fast implementation.

356
00:16:04,472 --> 00:16:05,952
For Rimworld, I really just made graphics

357
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:06,913
really, really quickly.

358
00:16:07,793 --> 00:16:10,214
Skipping over the need to worry about animation

359
00:16:10,814 --> 00:16:13,495
and complex graphics made it possible

360
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,776
to inject more story content into the game,

361
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:16,696
more mechanics.

362
00:16:17,196 --> 00:16:18,857
A lot of this stuff would be almost impossible to do

363
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:21,858
if we tried to do it anywhere near the standard

364
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,579
that a lot of games go for with their graphics.

365
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:26,480
Because if the only goal is to enrich the story,

366
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,381
you cut whatever details you need to

367
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:30,381
to make the story as rich as possible.

368
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
It's all about focusing on that one target

369
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,421
of being a story generator that works well.

370
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:37,601
And finally is leave room for interpretation.

371
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,521
I'm gonna go into this later,

372
00:16:39,462 --> 00:16:43,543
but the basic notion is that you don't show everything

373
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,603
and that lets the player imagine things better.

374
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:48,984
But I have a later discussion on that, which is right here.

375
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,165
Usually one would assume that in order to play

376
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:56,066
or in order to enjoy some aspect of a game,

377
00:16:57,006 --> 00:16:59,886
the developer has to implement that aspect of the game.

378
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:02,130
But it's not necessarily true.

379
00:17:03,151 --> 00:17:04,191
So if you consider this table,

380
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:06,633
the top left and the bottom right are what you would expect.

381
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:08,695
You put something in the game and people enjoy it,

382
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:09,855
or people read it.

383
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:11,617
You don't put something in the game

384
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:13,798
and nobody perceives it because it's not there.

385
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,200
The top right is a classic design failure,

386
00:17:17,221 --> 00:17:19,682
wherein a designer might put some complex,

387
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:21,103
beautiful number system in,

388
00:17:21,203 --> 00:17:22,725
but a player just reads it as noise

389
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:23,685
because they don't know what's going on,

390
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:24,806
or they don't see it.

391
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:27,948
But the bottom left is what I'm really interested in.

392
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,402
This is what I mean when I'm talking about impossible game design.

393
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:35,406
Something that's not present in the game, but the players are perceiving it anyways.

394
00:17:36,827 --> 00:17:42,753
And think of how powerful this is, because you don't even have to do the work, but the

395
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:45,215
players are enjoying things that you never had to actually implement.

396
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:51,021
And it works because the human mind is really an overactive system for matching patterns.

397
00:17:52,122 --> 00:17:52,563
This is why...

398
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,024
you know, ancient people, they would look at the constellations in the sky and they

399
00:17:57,044 --> 00:18:01,687
would see beasts or chariots or people, or they saw messages from the gods in chicken

400
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:02,968
guts and tea leaves.

401
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:06,311
And people pattern match in a very specific way, it's not random.

402
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:11,756
People interpret everything that's possible as tribal interpersonal politics.

403
00:18:13,446 --> 00:18:15,768
So this is why religious traditions or mythologies

404
00:18:16,248 --> 00:18:19,430
would interpret unknowable phenomena in the old days

405
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:21,012
like weather or earthquakes

406
00:18:21,612 --> 00:18:23,754
with the intentions of unseen deities.

407
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:27,076
It's the weather has an intention, it's not just an object.

408
00:18:27,536 --> 00:18:29,798
Our political discussion tends to revolve around

409
00:18:30,178 --> 00:18:32,720
pretending countries are people or corporations are people.

410
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,662
It's like France did this or Germany did that.

411
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:36,943
Germany has a lot of different people

412
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:38,204
and it doesn't have a single intention,

413
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:40,146
but we anthropomorphize it that way.

414
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:43,123
And I think it's because the part of our mind

415
00:18:43,143 --> 00:18:45,665
that models social interactions is super overdeveloped

416
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:46,746
because it's important to us.

417
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:49,448
But it's so overdeveloped that we thoughtlessly apply

418
00:18:49,468 --> 00:18:51,030
it to everything, effortlessly,

419
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,651
without even realizing we're doing it.

420
00:18:53,972 --> 00:18:58,035
And we impart rocks, or we impart emotions and intentions

421
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:00,617
on things like rocks and rivers and rain

422
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:03,340
and stuffed animals.

423
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:06,422
And this happens, of course,

424
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:08,023
even though these things don't have feelings.

425
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:11,046
So we can use this, since the goal of RimWorld

426
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:13,287
is to create a story of emotions and intentions,

427
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:16,729
and people are massively over-interpreting these things,

428
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,791
we can let the player's pattern-matching mind

429
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:23,613
automatically and unconsciously ascribe emotion

430
00:19:23,653 --> 00:19:26,995
and intention in places where it doesn't actually exist.

431
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:30,076
And that's useful because stories are made

432
00:19:30,297 --> 00:19:31,717
of emotions and intentions.

433
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:34,859
So here are some ways to do it,

434
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,541
or some things that feed into this phenomena,

435
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:38,581
which I call apophenia.

436
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,681
One is abstracted feedback.

437
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:41,561
This is what I mentioned before.

438
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,482
The player can only invent interpretations

439
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:47,063
if you don't force an interpretation upon them.

440
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:50,624
This is why the graphics are kept so simple in RimWorld.

441
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:52,745
So for example, here's a situation.

442
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:56,526
The doctor is treating his wife's bullet wound,

443
00:19:57,366 --> 00:19:58,566
but it doesn't show the character's faces

444
00:19:58,686 --> 00:19:59,447
or their body language.

445
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:01,848
This is deliberate.

446
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:04,028
It means that the player is free to imagine these faces

447
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:06,529
and this body language based on the situation.

448
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:10,843
if we put a visual image of that body language in,

449
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:12,063
the player would not be able to imagine it.

450
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:14,184
So, you know, if the doctor and the wife like each other,

451
00:20:14,484 --> 00:20:17,245
the player might imagine a heartfelt moment of tension

452
00:20:17,325 --> 00:20:18,365
as he tries to save her.

453
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:20,066
And if they dislike each other,

454
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,787
the player might imagine that they have this,

455
00:20:22,827 --> 00:20:24,047
like, get it over with attitude,

456
00:20:24,107 --> 00:20:26,068
or I'll let you touch me, barely.

457
00:20:26,088 --> 00:20:29,128
And if one character likes the other, but not the reverse,

458
00:20:29,148 --> 00:20:30,809
there's all sorts of other permutations

459
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:31,749
that you could come up with.

460
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,230
The second thing is long-term relevance.

461
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:42,405
You want to keep things relevant for a long time to maximize the connections between circumstances

462
00:20:42,465 --> 00:20:42,825
and events.

463
00:20:43,765 --> 00:20:49,849
Interesting story events and interpretation spring from the overlapping of different circumstances.

464
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,552
So if you can retain over time the reasons why a character might want to do something,

465
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:59,875
why might they want to have that intention, or why they might feel a certain way, you

466
00:20:59,895 --> 00:21:02,457
can give people food to generate their own interpretations.

467
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:05,784
So for example, this is why in RimWorld,

468
00:21:05,824 --> 00:21:07,966
I specifically designed the random incidents

469
00:21:09,107 --> 00:21:11,409
to take a long time to play out, wherever possible.

470
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,931
So diseases, they last a long time.

471
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:15,112
So does the toxic fallout.

472
00:21:16,313 --> 00:21:19,836
It floats down for months, half a year maybe.

473
00:21:20,817 --> 00:21:24,540
Volcanic winter, prowling manhunter packs of wild boars,

474
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,562
they wait outside the doors for a week,

475
00:21:26,822 --> 00:21:27,503
hoping you'll come out.

476
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:30,153
sieges and so on and so forth.

477
00:21:30,773 --> 00:21:33,574
Colonists remember events like family deaths

478
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:34,935
or marriages or divorces.

479
00:21:35,436 --> 00:21:36,496
They know their relationship,

480
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:37,917
they know what this person did to them.

481
00:21:38,978 --> 00:21:41,519
Failed surgeries, they remember these things for a long time

482
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:43,400
so there's many ways for these situations to overlap

483
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,561
and connect together and knit into a story of intentions.

484
00:21:47,002 --> 00:21:50,364
So for example, if the doctor previously failed a surgery

485
00:21:50,404 --> 00:21:52,685
on his wife, she will have a memory record of that

486
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:53,646
which the game will express.

487
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:54,886
It says botched my surgery.

488
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:59,228
and makes her express dislike for him in the game systems.

489
00:21:59,848 --> 00:22:00,548
But that's pretty thin

490
00:22:01,648 --> 00:22:03,469
in terms of how we do it numerically with the game,

491
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,249
but in terms of how this player can interpret it,

492
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:06,329
it can be quite rich

493
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,650
in terms of how she might feel about this situation.

494
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,291
If the wife needs surgery because of a wound from an animal

495
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:16,571
who's still prowling outside and food is short

496
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:18,192
and the two were divorced recently,

497
00:22:18,232 --> 00:22:20,412
but they had a cathartic fight that they feel better about,

498
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:22,733
you could just pile in the context

499
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,973
and imagine what all these different permutations.

500
00:22:29,774 --> 00:22:32,956
Next, I want to talk about game developers.

501
00:22:33,596 --> 00:22:35,397
So game developers, as a group, I

502
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:37,438
think we tend towards, obviously,

503
00:22:37,478 --> 00:22:41,621
a fascination with mechanics and logic and systems and numbers.

504
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:44,962
And especially this is in computer game development,

505
00:22:44,982 --> 00:22:46,443
because this is how computers work.

506
00:22:48,344 --> 00:22:50,285
So game developers will often chase

507
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:52,326
their own emotional signals and tend

508
00:22:52,346 --> 00:22:55,508
to work towards mechanical, numerical interactions that

509
00:22:55,528 --> 00:22:58,210
are interesting, which can work really well.

510
00:22:59,010 --> 00:22:59,550
Don't get me wrong.

511
00:23:00,325 --> 00:23:03,147
But if we're making a story generator, this is a trap.

512
00:23:03,768 --> 00:23:05,349
Because stories are not made of numbers.

513
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:07,070
They're really made of emotions.

514
00:23:08,191 --> 00:23:11,233
A story generator game has to relentlessly focus

515
00:23:11,453 --> 00:23:14,555
on the emotional journeys of the characters depicted.

516
00:23:14,575 --> 00:23:17,157
And this is really different from a game game,

517
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:19,899
where the numbers and the mechanics provide the puzzle

518
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,320
that the player can test themselves against.

519
00:23:23,498 --> 00:23:27,461
So as before, we have a conflict between the game as a skill test and the game as a story

520
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:27,862
generator.

521
00:23:28,262 --> 00:23:32,426
In a skill test game, the player spends their time engaging with a logical system that they

522
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:32,926
can master.

523
00:23:33,887 --> 00:23:39,812
In a story generating game, the player spends their time engaging with the imaginary emotions

524
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:40,373
of the characters.

525
00:23:41,814 --> 00:23:45,357
And so many times, I've gotten suggestions from players for mechanics that would be interesting

526
00:23:45,397 --> 00:23:45,697
to add.

527
00:23:46,118 --> 00:23:46,538
Interesting.

528
00:23:47,312 --> 00:23:49,874
More intricate economic production chains,

529
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:51,916
like right now you can just dig steel out of the ground

530
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:53,477
and build something with it, which is ridiculous,

531
00:23:53,817 --> 00:23:55,439
because in real life you have to dig ore out

532
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:57,200
and then get some coal and smelt them together

533
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:58,161
and refine them.

534
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:00,704
And people want that modeled, some of them.

535
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:05,308
Weapon customization with grips and stat changes and scopes.

536
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:08,631
Propagating fluid dynamics or gas.

537
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:12,254
Or deeper simulation of plant seeding or animal breeding

538
00:24:12,294 --> 00:24:13,015
or these sorts of things.

539
00:24:16,918 --> 00:24:18,961
These don't go into the game automatically,

540
00:24:19,101 --> 00:24:20,143
because even though they're interesting,

541
00:24:20,203 --> 00:24:23,168
none of them are fulcrums for characters' emotional journeys,

542
00:24:23,188 --> 00:24:24,991
or at least not as strong as they could be.

543
00:24:25,772 --> 00:24:27,495
You're not gonna get an emotional character moment

544
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:30,900
from somebody smelting ore or seeding plants.

545
00:24:32,395 --> 00:24:34,776
And that's the sort of decision razor that I try to apply

546
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,056
to cut things out of the design.

547
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:38,056
Is it relevant to the character's emotional journey?

548
00:24:38,096 --> 00:24:39,397
If it's not, it doesn't go in the game.

549
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:42,037
So I focus always on things that characters will feel about.

550
00:24:42,697 --> 00:24:45,398
Things like changes in relationship status between people,

551
00:24:46,238 --> 00:24:47,678
arrival and departure of family,

552
00:24:48,498 --> 00:24:50,199
health problems created and solved,

553
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,779
food being good or bad or scarce or plentiful.

554
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,659
I mean, these speak to deep human needs,

555
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,220
evolutionary time needs.

556
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,620
Social competition and wealth and status.

557
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,401
Quirks and traits of individuals.

558
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:05,684
I mean, getting to know people is a very feeling intense process.

559
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:11,068
And this can be hard to do because I have the same impulses as everyone else who loves

560
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:13,570
to write computer code, which is I'm really interested in numbers.

561
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:19,155
So it's easy to fall into the trap of self-indulging that and saying, oh, I'm going to code this

562
00:25:19,255 --> 00:25:23,438
really interesting thing that's going to make this system that's going to have all these

563
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:24,219
crazy properties.

564
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,441
But I try to suppress that.

565
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,832
it could drive the game away from what it's really supposed to be,

566
00:25:30,872 --> 00:25:31,813
which is story generation.

567
00:25:32,253 --> 00:25:33,274
So I always ask over and over,

568
00:25:33,334 --> 00:25:35,776
does this enrich the emotional journeys of the characters?

569
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:38,517
So that's RimWorld as a story generator.

570
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:42,300
Next, I want to move on to some of the specific methodology

571
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,641
that I used during development.

572
00:25:46,283 --> 00:25:49,165
So game design, I think as a discipline,

573
00:25:49,185 --> 00:25:50,606
is really all about task selection.

574
00:25:51,107 --> 00:25:52,968
It's answering the question, what do I do next?

575
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,951
Do I optimize the graphics system, draw art for a new character?

576
00:25:57,695 --> 00:25:58,756
Do I write some new dialogue?

577
00:25:59,697 --> 00:26:01,878
Do I clear a whiteboard and just start brainstorming

578
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:04,760
or start implementing a new bathroom mechanic,

579
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,461
or do I go to lunch?

580
00:26:06,722 --> 00:26:07,603
And this is a hard problem.

581
00:26:08,403 --> 00:26:10,625
And it's an important one because task selection

582
00:26:11,285 --> 00:26:13,167
is staggeringly impactful.

583
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:15,388
It shouldn't be done casually.

584
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:17,930
Because that one moment where you choose

585
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,431
to do the right task,

586
00:26:20,402 --> 00:26:22,723
or the wrong one can equal months of labor

587
00:26:23,403 --> 00:26:26,305
trying to fix a problem on a poorly chosen task

588
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:28,226
or spending time implementing features

589
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:29,847
that don't really have much impact.

590
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:34,750
Optimizing things that aren't slow

591
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,251
or perfecting graphics that nobody notices.

592
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,813
Unfortunately, there's a lot of great games out there

593
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:44,335
that are really well implemented,

594
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,676
but the developers worked on the wrong tasks

595
00:26:47,017 --> 00:26:48,998
and so they don't see the success that they should.

596
00:26:50,335 --> 00:26:52,575
So I spent a long time thinking about how to do task selection.

597
00:26:53,136 --> 00:26:54,636
And I'll start by criticizing some

598
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:55,796
of the typical approaches a little bit.

599
00:26:55,816 --> 00:26:56,937
And I'll tell you what I've done on RimWorld.

600
00:26:57,597 --> 00:26:58,197
So how do we choose?

601
00:26:59,497 --> 00:27:02,498
Very consistently, I think that really the first naive approach

602
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,579
that a random person on the street will come with

603
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:06,560
is to game designers.

604
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,860
They'll ask the question, here's an idea.

605
00:27:09,521 --> 00:27:10,901
Would this idea be cool in the game?

606
00:27:11,901 --> 00:27:13,882
And if so, they think it should go in the game.

607
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:16,303
And I get suggestions of this form all the time.

608
00:27:16,683 --> 00:27:18,403
This idea would be cool, so you should put it in.

609
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:24,073
But this is absolutely the wrong question to be asking as part of a design process.

610
00:27:24,713 --> 00:27:27,854
In fact, it's almost a useless question, because lots of ideas would be cool in the game.

611
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:32,696
The fact that an idea would be cool does not mean you should do it.

612
00:27:33,436 --> 00:27:39,218
The real question is, of every possible idea for the game, which one has the best coolness

613
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:40,438
to cost ratio?

614
00:27:41,831 --> 00:27:43,032
And this is the difference between

615
00:27:43,312 --> 00:27:45,173
satisficing and optimizing.

616
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:47,435
And these are two decision making methods.

617
00:27:47,475 --> 00:27:49,576
So satisficing is, you set your criteria,

618
00:27:49,596 --> 00:27:50,817
which is, the idea is cool,

619
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:52,959
and you consider options, one after the other.

620
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:56,141
And as soon as you find one that satisfies the criteria,

621
00:27:56,481 --> 00:27:57,582
you choose it, done.

622
00:27:58,683 --> 00:27:59,503
Optimizing is different.

623
00:28:00,624 --> 00:28:02,705
With optimizing, you would essentially

624
00:28:03,566 --> 00:28:05,227
enumerate as many options as possible,

625
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,129
sort them according to some criteria,

626
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,671
and then choose the best one from that process.

627
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:12,859
So each of these has its place.

628
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:14,761
If you want to buy a T-shirt off the internet,

629
00:28:15,621 --> 00:28:17,703
you're going to satisfy us because you can't enumerate

630
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:19,605
all the people who will sell you T-shirts off the internet.

631
00:28:19,905 --> 00:28:21,907
And T-shirts are pretty darn similar anyways.

632
00:28:22,508 --> 00:28:24,389
So you'll probably just go and maybe look at a couple sites

633
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:25,911
and choose the first one that you like.

634
00:28:26,511 --> 00:28:27,372
And that's rational.

635
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:28,433
That's a good thing to do.

636
00:28:29,754 --> 00:28:33,177
But if you're choosing dinner off a menu with five items,

637
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,319
you can afford to consider all the options

638
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,741
before choosing the best one.

639
00:28:37,578 --> 00:28:38,799
If you were satisficing, you would just read

640
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:40,239
from the top of the menu and literally just choose

641
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:41,800
the first thing that was not awful.

642
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,860
But with optimizing, maybe there's something

643
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,281
even better down and you're gonna check there too.

644
00:28:46,301 --> 00:28:47,201
You're gonna do the extra work.

645
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:51,182
So we can see some clear differences between these two.

646
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:52,562
Optimizing is way more effortful

647
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:54,803
and satisficing criteria can be simpler

648
00:28:55,103 --> 00:28:56,203
because it's just a pass fail.

649
00:28:57,483 --> 00:29:00,584
But optimizing criteria need to be a comparison operator

650
00:29:00,624 --> 00:29:01,864
between two options that lets you know

651
00:29:01,904 --> 00:29:02,705
which is better than the other.

652
00:29:04,457 --> 00:29:06,439
Satisfying saves time because you can consider

653
00:29:06,499 --> 00:29:08,120
just a tiny proportion of the options,

654
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,783
but optimizing needs to look at as many as possible.

655
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:12,584
And even though it's just thinking,

656
00:29:13,225 --> 00:29:14,506
this is real cognitive effort,

657
00:29:15,627 --> 00:29:18,109
the type that people try to avoid doing

658
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,831
and really instinctively recoil from.

659
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:22,193
So I have to push myself into it.

660
00:29:23,754 --> 00:29:25,055
As an aside, when I understood this,

661
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,537
I read about this concept,

662
00:29:26,617 --> 00:29:28,999
I realized why I hate shopping so much.

663
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,211
because when I shop I tend to try to optimize.

664
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:33,891
So I'm looking at something in the store

665
00:29:33,911 --> 00:29:35,772
and I'm like okay, is it better

666
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:36,533
than all the other ones here?

667
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:39,214
Is it better than every other option

668
00:29:39,234 --> 00:29:40,574
of this type in the universe?

669
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:43,335
Is it the best thing I could spend this $20 on

670
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,476
with the total integrated feature value

671
00:29:45,496 --> 00:29:47,177
of this being superior to the total integrated

672
00:29:47,217 --> 00:29:48,498
feature value of every other option

673
00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:50,158
that I could possibly spend this $20 on?

674
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:53,340
Which is a really kind of stressful problem

675
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,741
to be facing all the time in the shopping mall.

676
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:58,262
So I've learned to start satisficing a little bit there

677
00:29:58,282 --> 00:29:59,282
because it's a lot more relaxing.

678
00:30:01,077 --> 00:30:03,998
But optimizing does get better results

679
00:30:04,758 --> 00:30:05,979
in terms of decision quality.

680
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:09,540
And as we saw, because task selection can be so impactful,

681
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,441
this is important in games.

682
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:15,423
So with RimWorld, I tried very much to not satisfy us,

683
00:30:15,443 --> 00:30:16,483
but I also tried not to plan,

684
00:30:16,503 --> 00:30:19,164
or at least not plan in a traditional way.

685
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:22,306
You know, the classical approach to a problem

686
00:30:22,346 --> 00:30:23,946
is you decide what you're gonna do and then you do it.

687
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:27,008
So it's a blueprint for a house or a script for a movie,

688
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:27,608
that's your plan.

689
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,329
But think of everything you discard.

690
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,180
by creating a plan like this.

691
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,461
You discard the inspiration that you might have

692
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:37,362
during development, like new ideas, shower thoughts.

693
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:40,762
You discard feedback you might receive from players.

694
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:43,843
You discard things you learn from testing your own game.

695
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,324
Because you're a slave to decisions you've made

696
00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:48,305
when you put them in the plan.

697
00:30:48,945 --> 00:30:50,985
And some developers move against this in a partial way,

698
00:30:51,746 --> 00:30:52,926
which I've definitely done and works

699
00:30:53,006 --> 00:30:54,446
in certain circumstances by iterating.

700
00:30:54,907 --> 00:30:56,487
So essentially create a plan, execute it,

701
00:30:56,867 --> 00:30:59,348
maybe in some simplified form.

702
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:00,950
and then iterate on that result.

703
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:04,094
But I decided to try to go a little further in this

704
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,316
and remove the concept of the fixed plan

705
00:31:06,396 --> 00:31:08,839
from the design process entirely.

706
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,363
So here's what I did on RimWorld, day to day.

707
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:14,706
First,

708
00:31:16,747 --> 00:31:18,287
I kept one immediate to-do list.

709
00:31:18,747 --> 00:31:20,348
This is a Google Doc for each developer.

710
00:31:21,068 --> 00:31:22,369
This is what they're working on at that moment.

711
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:23,829
Usually it's like a page or two pages,

712
00:31:24,189 --> 00:31:25,290
maybe a little longer sometimes.

713
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,430
They're short, they generally don't include

714
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,091
more than a week or two of stuff to do.

715
00:31:29,391 --> 00:31:31,031
And I have one, each of us have one.

716
00:31:32,832 --> 00:31:34,893
Second, the giant ideas reservoir.

717
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:37,194
That's another Google Doc.

718
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,475
In this one, I record every inspiration,

719
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:44,076
and every idea, and everything that comes up.

720
00:31:44,865 --> 00:31:46,946
that seems like it could possibly ever be worthwhile.

721
00:31:47,846 --> 00:31:49,467
And this is where I'm trying to enumerate all the options.

722
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:51,507
Because even that's its own task.

723
00:31:52,248 --> 00:31:54,009
And this document soon includes hundreds,

724
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:56,430
even thousands of items.

725
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,891
RimWorlds currently is about 60 pages,

726
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:01,132
25,000 words or so.

727
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:03,993
I think it might be a little more now, since I wrote this.

728
00:32:05,453 --> 00:32:06,594
And probably it should be longer,

729
00:32:06,714 --> 00:32:08,755
because I don't, I'm a little too lazy

730
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:10,195
to write down every idea, but I really should.

731
00:32:11,316 --> 00:32:11,496
Third.

732
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:16,631
Regularly put effort into sorting the ideas reservoir to put the best ideas on top.

733
00:32:17,611 --> 00:32:20,252
And this is something you do week after week, month after month,

734
00:32:20,712 --> 00:32:22,833
revisiting the same stuff over and over and over again.

735
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:24,513
Or the new stuff as it gets added in.

736
00:32:24,793 --> 00:32:25,674
It's a living document.

737
00:32:26,774 --> 00:32:28,234
To me, I just basically do a bubble sort.

738
00:32:28,555 --> 00:32:30,515
I compare pairs of ideas and if they seem out of order,

739
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,376
like this one's on top, but this one seems stronger,

740
00:32:33,396 --> 00:32:34,956
I just put the lower one on top.

741
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:38,249
And often, because I'm doing it repeatedly,

742
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:40,231
I'll reverse the decision that I made the week before

743
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:42,333
or the month before, because I've learned something new,

744
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:45,416
or I feel different, or something else has come up

745
00:32:45,656 --> 00:32:47,118
and been added to the document.

746
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,223
I think while sorting, one tip here is,

747
00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:54,445
it's important to never ever consider

748
00:32:54,565 --> 00:32:55,486
anything to be locked in.

749
00:32:57,202 --> 00:32:59,083
Because when you feel like locking something in,

750
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:00,565
what I tell myself is,

751
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:02,967
it's my mind not wanting to do the work.

752
00:33:03,427 --> 00:33:04,288
Because when something's locked in,

753
00:33:04,308 --> 00:33:05,409
you don't have to think about it anymore.

754
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:06,871
And that's delicious.

755
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:08,752
That's what you're after, right?

756
00:33:08,772 --> 00:33:10,414
That's cognitive comfort.

757
00:33:10,874 --> 00:33:14,097
But that would make the system not work as well.

758
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:15,459
So I really try to force myself

759
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:16,820
to never consider anything locked in.

760
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,402
Re-evaluate, re-evaluate, re-evaluate every time.

761
00:33:21,324 --> 00:33:21,784
You gotta ask.

762
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,258
If this idea wasn't already in this position,

763
00:33:25,358 --> 00:33:26,098
would I move it here?

764
00:33:26,358 --> 00:33:27,839
And if not, move it to wherever it should be.

765
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:30,620
And I've said which idea is better.

766
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,321
By that I basically mean benefit per cost.

767
00:33:33,982 --> 00:33:35,723
Benefit means having more positive impact

768
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,884
on player experience or better market positioning.

769
00:33:38,724 --> 00:33:41,145
Cost is a combination of implementation difficulty

770
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:42,846
or negative impacts on players,

771
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:44,427
like if they have to learn something new

772
00:33:44,507 --> 00:33:46,768
or do a new tutorial item or something like that,

773
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:48,689
then that's a negative impact on players.

774
00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:50,490
These are big topics in themselves,

775
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,150
so I won't go into them.

776
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,751
I just wanted to clarify that a little bit.

777
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:59,767
Fourth, when the to-do list gets under about a week of tasks,

778
00:34:01,368 --> 00:34:03,428
or any to-do list, I go to the ideas reservoir.

779
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:06,369
I sort it, maybe a little more if needed.

780
00:34:06,729 --> 00:34:08,630
And then I just take some ideas off the top and move them over.

781
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,991
And so it's just copying and pasting between Google Docs.

782
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:15,151
And that's it.

783
00:34:16,272 --> 00:34:22,293
And these are the results that I think make it advantageous.

784
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:24,054
One is you retain inspiration.

785
00:34:24,877 --> 00:34:30,181
Have you ever written something in a notebook and then open it up two years later?

786
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:31,342
Like you forget about it entirely.

787
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:35,365
You open up your notebook, you look at your ideas from three or four years ago and you

788
00:34:35,385 --> 00:34:36,666
just don't recognize any of them.

789
00:34:37,346 --> 00:34:39,007
It's like another person giving you ideas.

790
00:34:40,569 --> 00:34:41,729
That's inspiration retention.

791
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,451
You've forgotten the ideas.

792
00:34:43,811 --> 00:34:45,072
I've had this happen to me so many times.

793
00:34:48,552 --> 00:34:49,993
What's good about having an ideas reservoir

794
00:34:50,013 --> 00:34:51,034
that you're always putting things in

795
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:53,255
is you capture every idea, every valuable thought

796
00:34:53,275 --> 00:34:54,415
from every day all the time.

797
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,557
You don't just capture from your brainstorming sessions.

798
00:34:56,797 --> 00:34:58,498
You capture from the shower, from the car.

799
00:34:58,838 --> 00:35:01,439
You capture from stuff you read or a movie you saw.

800
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,301
Some of these ideas can be used years after the fact.

801
00:35:05,401 --> 00:35:06,162
And some of them are layered.

802
00:35:06,182 --> 00:35:07,042
You put an idea in.

803
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:10,224
It inspires another one and then you compare it to a third

804
00:35:10,544 --> 00:35:11,985
and they combine together into something new

805
00:35:12,005 --> 00:35:13,646
that goes into the game two and a half years later.

806
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:14,687
That's happened.

807
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,820
I think a few months of random note taking

808
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,841
beats a three-hour brainstorm session every single time.

809
00:35:24,603 --> 00:35:26,463
Next is long-term decision making,

810
00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:27,464
it really reduces bias.

811
00:35:28,804 --> 00:35:29,904
Essentially the goal of all this

812
00:35:29,984 --> 00:35:32,205
is to get better quality design choices.

813
00:35:32,785 --> 00:35:33,726
So if you can reduce bias,

814
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:34,786
that's obviously what you're after.

815
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:38,487
Since you're not deciding at one specific moment

816
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:39,148
what you're gonna do,

817
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:41,288
you're not subject to the biases of that moment.

818
00:35:42,189 --> 00:35:43,589
Instead you make decisions over time

819
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:45,370
and reconfirm them in different states.

820
00:35:46,366 --> 00:35:47,686
And this is good because it eliminates

821
00:35:47,726 --> 00:35:48,946
those short-term biases.

822
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:52,387
Your emotional state one day might lead to a bad decision

823
00:35:52,427 --> 00:35:54,447
or maybe you're just obsessed with some new idea,

824
00:35:55,088 --> 00:35:56,148
but later on you'll realize,

825
00:35:56,168 --> 00:35:57,808
you know, that was actually kind of crap.

826
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:01,909
Next is future knowledge advantage.

827
00:36:03,249 --> 00:36:05,129
Since you only decide things when you need to,

828
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,010
by which I mean you only move things to the to-do queue

829
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,471
at the latest possible time

830
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:13,031
when you really need something to do,

831
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,031
you always know as much as possible

832
00:36:15,071 --> 00:36:16,012
when making that decision.

833
00:36:17,939 --> 00:36:22,002
The principle is, the future version of you always knows more than the present version

834
00:36:22,022 --> 00:36:22,302
of you.

835
00:36:23,122 --> 00:36:28,746
The future version of you pretty much, more or less, is a universally entirely better

836
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,007
decision maker than you are now.

837
00:36:31,527 --> 00:36:34,409
Because they know everything you know and they also know whatever you're going to learn

838
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:35,209
between now and then.

839
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,812
And so if you can hand a decision to someone who's smarter than you and more knowledgeable

840
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,934
than you in every conceivable way, then you probably should.

841
00:36:42,574 --> 00:36:43,374
And that's future you.

842
00:36:44,555 --> 00:36:45,876
So that's the future knowledge advantage.

843
00:36:48,661 --> 00:36:49,882
No status quo bias.

844
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:53,725
Status quo bias is the cognitive bias

845
00:36:53,905 --> 00:36:55,106
where people prefer the status quo.

846
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:57,488
And they look at change with suspicion.

847
00:36:57,508 --> 00:37:00,330
And this is measurable, this is just part of human nature.

848
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:03,493
And there's a reason for it, but it's a major problem

849
00:37:03,673 --> 00:37:04,473
that comes from planning.

850
00:37:05,074 --> 00:37:08,476
Because you put something in a plan and the bias kicks in.

851
00:37:08,857 --> 00:37:09,958
You don't want to change the status quo.

852
00:37:10,498 --> 00:37:11,399
And it gets worse in a group,

853
00:37:11,419 --> 00:37:13,160
because everyone gets invested in the status quo.

854
00:37:15,462 --> 00:37:17,323
In this system, you've got a big ideas reservoir,

855
00:37:17,343 --> 00:37:18,164
but none of it's planned.

856
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:20,244
None of it's locked in.

857
00:37:20,284 --> 00:37:21,205
There is no status quo.

858
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,047
Because you don't have a status quo plan to change,

859
00:37:24,207 --> 00:37:25,648
your decisions aren't affected by the bias.

860
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,891
Next is asynchronous working.

861
00:37:30,953 --> 00:37:32,154
You don't need to work synchronously.

862
00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:35,957
I work remotely with currently two other people.

863
00:37:36,858 --> 00:37:40,101
In Ludean, we don't even talk to each other that often.

864
00:37:40,161 --> 00:37:42,483
Sometimes we'll go several days without talking directly.

865
00:37:43,384 --> 00:37:43,704
Because

866
00:37:44,747 --> 00:37:46,429
Communication is actually pretty costly,

867
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,832
and a lot of communication is wasted time

868
00:37:48,852 --> 00:37:50,273
that could be done better in other ways,

869
00:37:51,034 --> 00:37:53,077
especially when you need to schedule meetups

870
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:54,919
or worry about when you're actually gonna synchronize

871
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,380
and get together and have those discussions.

872
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:58,002
And if you miss something, it's brutal,

873
00:37:58,022 --> 00:38:00,965
because you gotta go back and get it later.

874
00:38:04,558 --> 00:38:06,840
This methodology doesn't require brainstorming sessions

875
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,421
or design meetings or anything, because you're always

876
00:38:08,441 --> 00:38:08,921
brainstorming.

877
00:38:08,941 --> 00:38:11,163
And even when you're sleeping, if you have an idea,

878
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:12,564
you don't have to evaluate it.

879
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:13,704
You just drop it in a reservoir.

880
00:38:14,185 --> 00:38:15,726
And the designer will later bubble sort it in.

881
00:38:16,766 --> 00:38:18,227
And you don't get emails with your tasks.

882
00:38:18,407 --> 00:38:19,728
They're just there in your to-do document.

883
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:23,871
And it works remarkably well, at least for our context.

884
00:38:25,432 --> 00:38:27,753
I'm convinced, personally, that I

885
00:38:27,793 --> 00:38:31,796
think the intensely social, synchronous methodologies that

886
00:38:31,996 --> 00:38:32,696
get used a lot.

887
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,084
People are biased towards them because people like hanging out with other people,

888
00:38:37,845 --> 00:38:39,666
which is totally a legitimate thing to want to do.

889
00:38:40,366 --> 00:38:43,008
But it's at least worth acknowledging that and saying,

890
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:47,031
if you can do this in a different way, it might be more optimal

891
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,912
for decision making and saving people time.

892
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:53,876
I don't necessarily recommend this for extroverts, though.

893
00:38:55,617 --> 00:38:57,358
Finally is ideas fight their way to the top.

894
00:38:58,339 --> 00:38:59,860
By the time you're working on it, every idea...

895
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:03,901
that anybody works on explicitly or implicitly

896
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,621
has been compared with every single other idea

897
00:39:05,661 --> 00:39:06,702
that's ever been had about the game.

898
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:09,463
So they have to fight their way to the top

899
00:39:09,503 --> 00:39:11,244
of that ideas reservoir over time.

900
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:13,284
And to get there, they have to be good.

901
00:39:13,304 --> 00:39:15,766
If there's a lot of ideas, they have to be really good.

902
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:19,027
For RimWorld, we had so many great ideas

903
00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:20,428
that never made it into the game

904
00:39:21,268 --> 00:39:22,708
because other ideas were even better.

905
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:26,030
I had, like, I would think this idea was amazing

906
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,111
and it just gets out-competed completely

907
00:39:28,131 --> 00:39:29,871
and a year later, it's in the middle of the document.

908
00:39:31,104 --> 00:39:33,345
Because to fight their way to the top of that competition,

909
00:39:33,425 --> 00:39:34,566
each idea has to be a champion.

910
00:39:34,926 --> 00:39:36,747
And if you make a game with champion ideas only,

911
00:39:37,447 --> 00:39:38,388
it's gonna come out real strong.

912
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:41,450
And this is really honestly,

913
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,571
that last one I think is the most important outcome.

914
00:39:45,432 --> 00:39:48,894
Champion ideas, things that are stupidly simple,

915
00:39:49,814 --> 00:39:51,695
but emotionally rich, elegant,

916
00:39:52,335 --> 00:39:53,936
and meaningful in mechanics and story.

917
00:39:54,797 --> 00:39:56,478
Gettable and familiar for new players,

918
00:39:56,658 --> 00:39:57,638
but also new and exciting.

919
00:39:58,617 --> 00:40:03,318
You never spend your time doing work to fix up downsides or breakage cases of some idea

920
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:08,140
because once you recognize that the idea has those downsides or breakage cases, which ideally

921
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,582
you would during the analysis phases, maybe not this month, but maybe next month, you'll

922
00:40:12,602 --> 00:40:16,083
find it out or realize it, you'll bubble it down.

923
00:40:20,598 --> 00:40:24,120
There's one other useful decision razor here is it possible ship without it.

924
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,622
This is critical before you've actually ship something that people are playing.

925
00:40:28,562 --> 00:40:31,123
It's remarkable how often the answer is yes actually.

926
00:40:31,984 --> 00:40:37,146
So here are some of the things that I shipped early versions without some of this has been added later,

927
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:45,150
but the first version of room world which did people did play and enjoy and pay money for back in 2013 didn't have these things character animations already discussed how.

928
00:40:47,451 --> 00:40:49,212
Nobody animates and why.

929
00:40:50,897 --> 00:40:52,138
And it doesn't bother anybody.

930
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:53,979
Stockpile system.

931
00:40:54,479 --> 00:40:55,679
Traditionally in the Dwarf Fortress

932
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,041
like colony simulator genre,

933
00:40:59,301 --> 00:41:02,042
a core part of the gameplay is placing down these stockpiles

934
00:41:02,062 --> 00:41:03,422
and putting things in it and managing where they are.

935
00:41:03,663 --> 00:41:04,723
But in the first version of RimWorld,

936
00:41:05,223 --> 00:41:06,584
I wasn't that great of an AI programmer

937
00:41:06,904 --> 00:41:08,364
and I couldn't figure out how to make them do that.

938
00:41:08,905 --> 00:41:11,386
So I just had them pick up resources and touch a building

939
00:41:11,406 --> 00:41:14,067
and then just disappear into this magical place in the sky

940
00:41:14,467 --> 00:41:15,888
from which you could spend them.

941
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:17,768
And nobody minded, the game still worked fine.

942
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:20,459
traders who physically visit the player.

943
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:22,820
I wanted trading in the first version of the game,

944
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,040
but the AI for having a trader come in

945
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,841
and deal with getting attacked and hang around

946
00:41:26,881 --> 00:41:29,101
and interact with you and leave and carry all this stuff,

947
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:32,542
all those systems were just really brutal

948
00:41:33,622 --> 00:41:35,823
and complicated to do, so I just didn't do them.

949
00:41:36,383 --> 00:41:40,724
Instead, I just put a communications console

950
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,885
where ships fly over and you can trade with them magically

951
00:41:43,025 --> 00:41:44,285
and stuff just teleports up and down.

952
00:41:44,746 --> 00:41:46,606
And it fulfills the same design purpose as the trader

953
00:41:46,626 --> 00:41:48,267
without all those nasty details.

954
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,708
Contagious crop blight, you'd think a crop blight

955
00:41:51,728 --> 00:41:54,209
would have to move between plants and spread

956
00:41:54,249 --> 00:41:55,669
and things like that, but no, mine just kills

957
00:41:55,729 --> 00:41:56,730
a whole bunch of plants randomly.

958
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,071
It fills the purpose, although I might replace

959
00:41:59,091 --> 00:41:59,611
that one soon.

960
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:01,832
And contagious diseases.

961
00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:07,814
So players are, I have found, remarkably accepting

962
00:42:07,954 --> 00:42:11,395
of not having things that might seem to be necessary

963
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:12,116
up front.

964
00:42:12,756 --> 00:42:15,297
Very, very few people complain about the things

965
00:42:15,317 --> 00:42:15,897
that I've talked about.

966
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:18,433
but they have lots of complaints about other things.

967
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,494
So the things that seem important up front,

968
00:42:20,854 --> 00:42:22,476
the things like, yeah, we gotta have character animations,

969
00:42:22,516 --> 00:42:23,837
and the trader has to come and trade with you,

970
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:24,457
obviously, right?

971
00:42:25,578 --> 00:42:28,400
The players probably don't really care, necessarily,

972
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,502
about those things, and they probably really care

973
00:42:30,522 --> 00:42:31,723
about other things entirely.

974
00:42:35,065 --> 00:42:37,627
So, I've described a bunch of somewhat

975
00:42:37,887 --> 00:42:39,008
contrarian design strategies.

976
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:42,531
One can just try to follow the steps.

977
00:42:43,992 --> 00:42:47,454
But I think to really be able to try to do something different,

978
00:42:48,034 --> 00:42:54,959
you have to go deeper and have this intention on a level of personal philosophy

979
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,280
and belief, for a couple reasons.

980
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,402
First, obviously, contrarianism means doing things differently,

981
00:43:01,002 --> 00:43:03,123
so everyone can't do different things the same way.

982
00:43:03,184 --> 00:43:03,664
I'm not saying...

983
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:06,926
This talk isn't telling you guys to make a story generator, necessarily.

984
00:43:07,406 --> 00:43:08,627
It's to find your frame.

985
00:43:10,428 --> 00:43:11,108
Secondly, it's...

986
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:16,596
you won't get social reinforcement as much as if you're doing something more typical.

987
00:43:18,157 --> 00:43:22,600
You might see some non-comprehension or disagreement or pushback from the social environment around

988
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,202
you when you discuss something like that.

989
00:43:25,362 --> 00:43:28,985
And you need to have the belief foundations to hold on to those convictions even without

990
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:30,186
external positive feedback.

991
00:43:31,347 --> 00:43:35,490
And this is doubly challenging because it's human nature to synchronize our beliefs with

992
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:36,231
the people around us.

993
00:43:36,911 --> 00:43:39,773
It happens automatically, it's unconscious, almost involuntarily.

994
00:43:41,023 --> 00:43:43,585
I'm sure some of you have heard of these research studies,

995
00:43:43,645 --> 00:43:45,686
where they'll put a subject in a room

996
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,568
surrounded by actors pretending to be other subjects,

997
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:49,329
and they put some lines on the wall,

998
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,091
and they ask, which line is shorter than the other ones?

999
00:43:52,892 --> 00:43:54,973
And all of the actors pretending to be other subjects,

1000
00:43:54,993 --> 00:43:55,854
they all give the wrong answer.

1001
00:43:57,415 --> 00:43:59,116
And something like 30% of the time,

1002
00:43:59,557 --> 00:44:01,698
the research subject will agree with the social milieu

1003
00:44:01,738 --> 00:44:04,140
instead of the line which is right on the wall,

1004
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:04,781
right in front of them.

1005
00:44:05,982 --> 00:44:07,903
They will agree with essentially hallucinating

1006
00:44:08,303 --> 00:44:09,845
or trying to go along with the people around them.

1007
00:44:10,611 --> 00:44:14,092
And so if that happens 30% of the time for something so simple,

1008
00:44:14,132 --> 00:44:17,173
imagine how much harder it is to believe

1009
00:44:17,213 --> 00:44:20,014
the correct or a contrarian logic on a deeper question.

1010
00:44:21,735 --> 00:44:24,196
Speaking of questions, it's often hard to even ask the question,

1011
00:44:24,836 --> 00:44:26,197
much less get the correct answer.

1012
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,958
So consider questions like, should we make a game?

1013
00:44:30,258 --> 00:44:31,379
Should our product tell a story?

1014
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,980
Should more skillful players get greater rewards?

1015
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,581
Should we plan our work ahead of time?

1016
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:40,931
Should we try to maximize communication between developers?

1017
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:43,373
Should we try to make our game as beautiful as possible?

1018
00:44:43,393 --> 00:44:45,255
Do our characters have to have faces?

1019
00:44:46,275 --> 00:44:48,357
Should we implement this idea that seems really cool?

1020
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:52,561
I think noticing these questions exist

1021
00:44:54,703 --> 00:44:55,924
can be an intellectual challenge.

1022
00:44:56,725 --> 00:44:58,006
And giving unusual answers to them

1023
00:44:58,046 --> 00:44:59,267
is really just a matter of mental effort.

1024
00:45:02,924 --> 00:45:04,345
Finally, I think the thing that convinced me

1025
00:45:04,385 --> 00:45:05,846
at the core to pursue a strategy like this,

1026
00:45:05,866 --> 00:45:07,968
or at least trying on some level to do something different,

1027
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:10,071
is that indie game development

1028
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:11,032
is really a tournament market.

1029
00:45:11,472 --> 00:45:12,713
It tends to be set up such that

1030
00:45:13,894 --> 00:45:16,337
to a small number of winners, all of the rewards go.

1031
00:45:17,558 --> 00:45:19,280
That means that in such an environment,

1032
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,682
a typical result, the 50th percentile,

1033
00:45:21,762 --> 00:45:24,945
is actually either failure or a struggle.

1034
00:45:25,626 --> 00:45:26,747
It's not a success to be typical.

1035
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:32,434
And if you use typical strategies, you should expect typical results.

1036
00:45:33,214 --> 00:45:38,116
So, from this logic, the only option is to use an atypical, high-variance strategy.

1037
00:45:39,817 --> 00:45:44,980
And these will be strategies, by definition, that most people are not using or likely won't

1038
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,340
agree with.

1039
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:49,602
Because if a lot of people are using them, then you're back to the typical results.

1040
00:45:51,011 --> 00:45:52,572
But take heart, one rule of history is that

1041
00:45:52,592 --> 00:45:54,473
the social milieu is always making mistakes.

1042
00:45:54,933 --> 00:45:56,614
It's true in every society and all time everywhere.

1043
00:45:56,674 --> 00:45:58,815
So just because nobody's thinking a certain way

1044
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:01,037
or asking certain questions doesn't mean that they're dumb.

1045
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:05,259
In a tournament market, where the average results

1046
00:46:05,439 --> 00:46:07,440
equal failure, I don't think you should be frightened

1047
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,382
of following individual logic to a different conclusion

1048
00:46:10,582 --> 00:46:12,263
or frightened of taking a strange frame.

1049
00:46:13,384 --> 00:46:16,065
I think it should be more frightening to follow the group.

1050
00:46:17,646 --> 00:46:18,327
Thank you very much.

1051
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,322
As always, please fill out your evaluations.

1052
00:46:31,984 --> 00:46:33,465
I did write a game design book a few years ago.

1053
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:33,966
That's it.

1054
00:46:34,126 --> 00:46:34,907
And you can check that out.

1055
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:39,211
And yeah, if you guys have some questions,

1056
00:46:39,271 --> 00:46:40,953
I would love to take you if you'd just come up to the mics

1057
00:46:40,973 --> 00:46:41,133
here.

1058
00:46:41,934 --> 00:46:43,756
And how about over here?

1059
00:46:44,545 --> 00:46:44,785
Hey man.

1060
00:46:45,606 --> 00:46:45,746
Hey.

1061
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:51,030
You spent the beginning of the talk drawing the distinction between a game and the story simulator you're trying to make.

1062
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:51,330
Yeah.

1063
00:46:51,430 --> 00:47:00,297
And talking about how people generally want to feel skillful and want the game to be fair, and that's something you're not, I don't want to say not interested in, but you know, that's not the priority.

1064
00:47:00,457 --> 00:47:00,637
Yeah.

1065
00:47:01,117 --> 00:47:07,222
And then you're talking a lot about how you're actually bringing story tropes from movies and books, you know, disproportionate pushback and so on.

1066
00:47:08,423 --> 00:47:14,125
to this game. I would argue that when you are watching a movie or reading a book, the

1067
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:18,487
one thing that the audience can do is abdicate responsibility for what's happening on screen.

1068
00:47:19,447 --> 00:47:22,949
We feel empathy, but that's probably the only way we can actually survive watching Game

1069
00:47:23,009 --> 00:47:25,670
of Thrones because, well, at least that wasn't our fault.

1070
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,892
versus when you're doing something in a game,

1071
00:47:28,532 --> 00:47:30,334
people feel implicated in the success

1072
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:31,975
of what's happening on screen.

1073
00:47:32,476 --> 00:47:34,217
I'm wondering how you're drawing the line

1074
00:47:34,297 --> 00:47:35,819
on the one hand where people actually form

1075
00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:37,420
this emotional connection,

1076
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,042
but also feel they're responsible

1077
00:47:39,082 --> 00:47:40,243
for what's going on screen,

1078
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,204
but you're telling them,

1079
00:47:42,845 --> 00:47:44,747
yeah, but it's not a fair game, right?

1080
00:47:44,787 --> 00:47:46,789
Like, the fact that you can be competent

1081
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:48,610
is not really important.

1082
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,292
I think there's a balance of influence.

1083
00:47:51,052 --> 00:47:53,194
that at least this is the strategy that RimWorld took.

1084
00:47:53,314 --> 00:47:54,494
The player can influence the game,

1085
00:47:55,015 --> 00:47:56,395
but they don't control every single thing

1086
00:47:56,455 --> 00:47:57,676
that their characters do.

1087
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,198
They lay out priorities or set a schedule,

1088
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,000
but the colonists that you're controlling

1089
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,421
won't always follow what you want them to do.

1090
00:48:05,961 --> 00:48:08,162
They might do something else entirely,

1091
00:48:08,182 --> 00:48:10,064
they might go crazy, or they might just fall asleep,

1092
00:48:10,084 --> 00:48:11,284
or so on and so forth.

1093
00:48:11,324 --> 00:48:13,405
So I think in a game where you control people directly,

1094
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:16,747
or control a protagonist at every moment and every action,

1095
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:19,331
A lot of this would have to be reinterpreted

1096
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,212
because you wouldn't be able to abdicate anything.

1097
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,374
It wouldn't be the feeling of watching something.

1098
00:48:23,794 --> 00:48:25,876
But in BrimWorld, you're far enough away

1099
00:48:25,896 --> 00:48:26,577
from what's going on

1100
00:48:27,097 --> 00:48:28,358
and the moment-to-moment interactions

1101
00:48:28,778 --> 00:48:31,080
that even though you influence the context of the situation

1102
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,842
and set the overall priorities of some of the characters,

1103
00:48:36,124 --> 00:48:38,246
you are not exactly in control.

1104
00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:40,228
And so you can get into the mental frame of watching it

1105
00:48:40,588 --> 00:48:41,749
and saying, this thing happened,

1106
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:43,470
not I did this thing necessarily.

1107
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:44,731
Does that make sense?

1108
00:48:44,951 --> 00:48:45,492
Yeah, of course.

1109
00:48:45,712 --> 00:48:45,872
Thanks.

1110
00:48:46,212 --> 00:48:46,432
All right.

1111
00:48:47,743 --> 00:48:47,964
Please.

1112
00:48:48,305 --> 00:48:49,429
Hi, thank you very much for your talk.

1113
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:53,001
I was very intrigued by your methodology pieces

1114
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:54,285
and where they borrow from.

1115
00:48:55,447 --> 00:49:00,369
other methodologies but have their own unique spin on them. I was curious if you have given

1116
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:05,232
much thought to how those would scale up as you start adding much larger team sizes. It

1117
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:09,454
seemed like some of the things you were talking about make a lot of sense with a pretty small

1118
00:49:09,494 --> 00:49:14,237
team and I could see how that could work with compartmentalized small teams and a larger

1119
00:49:14,277 --> 00:49:16,618
team. But say for example if you have a team of 130 devs.

1120
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:20,460
and everyone's contributing to the idea barn

1121
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,601
actively, organically.

1122
00:49:22,081 --> 00:49:23,902
It's almost like multiple full-time jobs

1123
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:25,323
just to sort that list.

1124
00:49:25,923 --> 00:49:27,805
Much less try to turn that into collaborative

1125
00:49:28,185 --> 00:49:29,906
work assignments between different disparate

1126
00:49:29,946 --> 00:49:30,626
groups of people.

1127
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:31,507
So I was just curious,

1128
00:49:31,527 --> 00:49:32,607
because you seem to be very well thought

1129
00:49:32,707 --> 00:49:34,668
how that maps to scale.

1130
00:49:35,689 --> 00:49:38,090
I gotta be honest,

1131
00:49:38,631 --> 00:49:40,352
I generally focus on my own problems

1132
00:49:40,432 --> 00:49:42,413
and I am in the sort of the three person range.

1133
00:49:43,656 --> 00:49:47,799
I think it would be a really interesting discussion to talk about that, but I can't claim expertise

1134
00:49:47,879 --> 00:49:48,880
on it at this point.

1135
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,902
I think you could probably come up with ideas just as good as mine, right?

1136
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:57,466
So I don't want to pretend to have some more knowledge than I have here.

1137
00:49:57,887 --> 00:49:58,547
But it's a good question.

1138
00:49:58,587 --> 00:49:59,067
Thank you very much.

1139
00:49:59,107 --> 00:50:04,131
I should have mentioned earlier that I only have three people and that this is really

1140
00:50:04,191 --> 00:50:08,274
a system that was designed for that, and that scaling it up would be something that you

1141
00:50:08,294 --> 00:50:10,596
guys would have to figure out in your own context.

1142
00:50:11,076 --> 00:50:11,236
Okay.

1143
00:50:11,457 --> 00:50:11,677
Thank you.

1144
00:50:13,423 --> 00:50:16,344
With just those three people, with your ideas list,

1145
00:50:17,145 --> 00:50:20,366
is it just one person sorting the list every time?

1146
00:50:20,506 --> 00:50:24,327
Or because, so you just unilaterally decide

1147
00:50:24,427 --> 00:50:25,587
what ideas are the best ones?

1148
00:50:25,867 --> 00:50:26,187
Pretty much.

1149
00:50:26,347 --> 00:50:29,388
I mean, on RimWorld, I do the design work,

1150
00:50:30,088 --> 00:50:31,209
and I do some programming,

1151
00:50:31,309 --> 00:50:32,549
and the other guys help out with tech.

1152
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:36,310
We do discuss things, of course.

1153
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,431
You know, I ask some questions.

1154
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,551
You know, what do you think of this or that?

1155
00:50:38,771 --> 00:50:42,532
But I am making those executive decisions, so to speak.

1156
00:50:44,707 --> 00:50:44,927
Please.

1157
00:50:45,607 --> 00:50:48,630
So storytelling or telling stories about my game

1158
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,292
would require having a nice record of the game,

1159
00:50:50,512 --> 00:50:52,073
at least as a memory prompt to show stuff off.

1160
00:50:52,614 --> 00:50:53,815
Do you have any thoughts on what direction

1161
00:50:53,835 --> 00:50:56,757
you're going to go with the game recording what's happened

1162
00:50:57,158 --> 00:50:57,838
so I can tell stories?

1163
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,321
I think this is an interesting question

1164
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:04,204
because it touches on the difference between generating

1165
00:51:04,224 --> 00:51:05,765
story events and recording and telling them.

1166
00:51:06,486 --> 00:51:08,668
Because those are different processes, right?

1167
00:51:08,708 --> 00:51:12,411
Like you can watch something that goes on the street

1168
00:51:12,491 --> 00:51:13,031
or in a video.

1169
00:51:13,953 --> 00:51:16,896
and the story comes in your mind in some format and then if you're gonna repeat

1170
00:51:16,936 --> 00:51:20,099
that backers synthesize that are say what was important about it and what was

1171
00:51:20,139 --> 00:51:20,720
the connections

1172
00:51:21,281 --> 00:51:22,862
that's a layer of interpretation which is

1173
00:51:22,882 --> 00:51:25,585
and uh... i think a different task entirely

1174
00:51:26,266 --> 00:51:29,069
and my approach to that on rimworld was just to not do it

1175
00:51:29,609 --> 00:51:30,750
because i think that the player mind

1176
00:51:31,687 --> 00:51:33,528
player can unconsciously do that better than the game.

1177
00:51:34,188 --> 00:51:37,791
The game is fine at generating these numerical interactions

1178
00:51:37,811 --> 00:51:39,752
and all this stuff, but the interpretation

1179
00:51:39,772 --> 00:51:41,554
and seeing what's important and what's meaningful,

1180
00:51:43,315 --> 00:51:46,637
I very much leave that to the player apophenia.

1181
00:51:46,657 --> 00:51:49,599
You do record rates.

1182
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:51,481
Sorry?

1183
00:51:51,521 --> 00:51:54,163
You do record rates and things.

1184
00:51:54,183 --> 00:51:56,144
In a very simple format, just so people

1185
00:51:56,164 --> 00:51:57,945
can correlate something on the graph with an event.

1186
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:01,931
Yes, yes, yes.

1187
00:52:03,512 --> 00:52:05,654
But it's not trying to tell the story in an accurate way.

1188
00:52:06,254 --> 00:52:06,455
Sorry.

1189
00:52:06,935 --> 00:52:07,135
Please.

1190
00:52:07,155 --> 00:52:08,236
Hi.

1191
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:10,958
I just had a question about the task selection stuff.

1192
00:52:11,498 --> 00:52:17,563
So once you got individual developers' lists of things to do, do you often find ideas from

1193
00:52:17,603 --> 00:52:21,245
the pool sort of bubbling up to be even higher priority than what people were working on

1194
00:52:21,265 --> 00:52:22,346
and then have to kind of change?

1195
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:26,170
you know, direction or even if something was already like half implemented in the game,

1196
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:29,773
did you ever find it like priority dropping below new ideas?

1197
00:52:31,655 --> 00:52:33,677
At least for WimWorld, it doesn't tend to happen.

1198
00:52:34,498 --> 00:52:37,921
I mean, I don't think we've cut anything significant for a couple of years.

1199
00:52:37,941 --> 00:52:38,862
So.

1200
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:45,232
No, I mean a big part of the point of the whole process

1201
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:47,514
is to try to avoid finding out that something is broken

1202
00:52:47,554 --> 00:52:48,235
after you put it in.

1203
00:52:49,016 --> 00:52:51,618
So no, in practice, it doesn't tend to happen,

1204
00:52:51,658 --> 00:52:52,319
at least for RimWorld.

1205
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:52,779
Not that much.

1206
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:54,941
Although if it does, we're always watching out for that.

1207
00:52:55,502 --> 00:52:57,403
And we will definitely redesign something.

1208
00:52:57,463 --> 00:52:58,004
I'm sure it happened.

1209
00:52:58,024 --> 00:53:00,566
I just can't think of examples of that specifically.

1210
00:53:00,786 --> 00:53:00,986
Thanks.

1211
00:53:01,427 --> 00:53:01,647
All right.

1212
00:53:03,709 --> 00:53:06,952
So I'm wondering if you've thought about.

1213
00:53:07,942 --> 00:53:12,683
basically a hybrid where you take something like an MMORPG

1214
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:16,363
and put some of these story generation elements into it,

1215
00:53:17,003 --> 00:53:19,024
or going the other way and make a game

1216
00:53:19,084 --> 00:53:21,244
that starts out as a story generator,

1217
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:24,705
but has selected game mechanics added in?

1218
00:53:26,545 --> 00:53:27,645
From the MMO point of view,

1219
00:53:27,665 --> 00:53:31,206
I mean, to me, that's like an entire other layer

1220
00:53:31,226 --> 00:53:34,007
of complexity, so I'm trying to solve the basic problem

1221
00:53:34,347 --> 00:53:36,007
to start with, which is to do it with one person.

1222
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:42,555
I have, you know, people suggest ideas about putting multiple RimWorld colonies in one

1223
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:46,379
world or having a whole bunch of people on one planet so they can interact over a distance

1224
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:49,402
and that would sort of start to seem like an MMO if it was long enough.

1225
00:53:51,784 --> 00:53:57,349
I do think that introduces a lot of difficulties that I have not thought through how to solve

1226
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:58,830
exactly right now.

1227
00:54:03,646 --> 00:54:07,187
You gave us a bunch of examples of stuff players didn't miss when you launched your game,

1228
00:54:07,527 --> 00:54:11,489
but what examples of stuff did players actually complain about or miss?

1229
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:17,091
They complain about...

1230
00:54:18,491 --> 00:54:20,692
See, now I'm trying to think back to years in the past too.

1231
00:54:21,452 --> 00:54:24,936
to some of the stuff that happened during that time period when those things weren't

1232
00:54:24,977 --> 00:54:25,237
in there.

1233
00:54:25,257 --> 00:54:30,283
A lot of the time people wanted more content, they'd say things were unbalanced or something

1234
00:54:30,303 --> 00:54:33,126
would be unclear so they wouldn't know how to interact with something.

1235
00:54:33,367 --> 00:54:35,950
Like really prosaic design problems a lot of the time.

1236
00:54:38,355 --> 00:54:41,077
Or oftentimes, yeah, people want different content.

1237
00:54:41,117 --> 00:54:44,240
Instead of wanting, say, I want the trader to come on foot

1238
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:48,162
instead of by the sky, they want slug aliens

1239
00:54:48,282 --> 00:54:51,104
to come and give you alien milk that's

1240
00:54:51,164 --> 00:54:52,525
like super powerful or something like that.

1241
00:54:53,306 --> 00:54:55,407
So people are usually asking for totally new things,

1242
00:54:56,268 --> 00:54:58,429
or fixes to things that are bothering them actively,

1243
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:01,171
not to more complex versions of things

1244
00:55:01,191 --> 00:55:02,012
that already work pretty well.

1245
00:55:02,652 --> 00:55:03,173
Does that make sense?

1246
00:55:03,553 --> 00:55:03,793
All right.

1247
00:55:03,993 --> 00:55:04,334
Thank you.

1248
00:55:04,654 --> 00:55:04,754
OK.

1249
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:06,362
Yes?

1250
00:55:06,722 --> 00:55:09,023
So I'm assuming you're entirely self-funded,

1251
00:55:09,143 --> 00:55:12,585
but in a situation like this where you're so flexible

1252
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:13,826
and you have no commitments,

1253
00:55:14,346 --> 00:55:17,088
how do you see working with business partners

1254
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:20,249
or people who might want, say, milestones

1255
00:55:20,369 --> 00:55:23,771
or some kind of idea or commitment of where you're going?

1256
00:55:24,492 --> 00:55:26,213
Yes, you're correct that I was self-funded.

1257
00:55:26,233 --> 00:55:28,634
I just used personal savings to start the company

1258
00:55:28,654 --> 00:55:31,275
and did it myself and got some roommates

1259
00:55:31,736 --> 00:55:33,477
for the first while.

1260
00:55:35,128 --> 00:55:36,389
In terms of integrating other people,

1261
00:55:36,889 --> 00:55:38,589
I think there would have to be a very high degree of trust

1262
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,830
from those partners in you.

1263
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:45,951
I think that someone could contribute things

1264
00:55:46,611 --> 00:55:48,972
with the understanding, like ideas or concepts

1265
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,192
or suggestions, with the understanding

1266
00:55:50,232 --> 00:55:51,332
that they're going into the process

1267
00:55:51,372 --> 00:55:52,432
in the same place as everyone else.

1268
00:55:53,173 --> 00:55:56,473
So, essentially I think it demands trust.

1269
00:55:57,734 --> 00:55:59,954
But I haven't personally faced this problem

1270
00:56:00,434 --> 00:56:01,275
and it's something that I would.

1271
00:56:02,148 --> 00:56:06,551
Generally, I personally prefer this model of self-funding

1272
00:56:06,591 --> 00:56:07,971
just because it gives that freedom.

1273
00:56:09,932 --> 00:56:12,093
But yeah, if you could find some business partners who

1274
00:56:12,133 --> 00:56:15,195
could trust you that much, that could work out as well.

1275
00:56:16,935 --> 00:56:17,196
Thank you.

1276
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:19,477
Hi there.

1277
00:56:19,897 --> 00:56:22,778
So RimWorld's been early access for several years now, right?

1278
00:56:23,597 --> 00:56:26,098
It was Kickstarter 2013, late 2013.

1279
00:56:26,138 --> 00:56:29,439
Then I sold it on my own website for several years.

1280
00:56:29,859 --> 00:56:31,560
And then it hit Steam Early Access in July 2016.

1281
00:56:32,521 --> 00:56:32,821
OK.

1282
00:56:33,301 --> 00:56:35,542
Would you say that your decisions

1283
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,243
on cutting what features would be in the launch version

1284
00:56:38,903 --> 00:56:41,204
were a little bit easier because you weren't doing a 1.0

1285
00:56:42,245 --> 00:56:43,425
final release of the game?

1286
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:50,168
It's definitely been essential to have a lot of players

1287
00:56:50,268 --> 00:56:51,569
banging on the game over time.

1288
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,081
For the first period before the Kickstarter,

1289
00:56:56,262 --> 00:56:58,743
I was just by myself, but even then,

1290
00:56:59,684 --> 00:57:01,525
I got to play it where possible,

1291
00:57:01,605 --> 00:57:03,345
and I even sent it to people

1292
00:57:04,706 --> 00:57:06,147
and demanded that they make a YouTube video

1293
00:57:06,167 --> 00:57:07,407
of themselves playing it the first time,

1294
00:57:07,547 --> 00:57:08,848
because I wanted that first-time experience,

1295
00:57:08,888 --> 00:57:10,549
and I need to be able to watch people just playing the game

1296
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:12,310
to solve those problems before I send it

1297
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:15,451
to the initial batch of YouTube videoers or journalists.

1298
00:57:17,072 --> 00:57:19,113
So that feedback is really an essential part of the process,

1299
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:20,593
and it's a huge fountain of information.

1300
00:57:22,345 --> 00:57:24,507
Does that address the question or was there something more specific?

1301
00:57:24,827 --> 00:57:30,370
And as a follow-up, do you know when you're going to come out of early access on Steam and call it 1.0?

1302
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:32,092
I couldn't speculate about the future.

1303
00:57:32,112 --> 00:57:32,332
Never?

1304
00:57:33,432 --> 00:57:37,215
Well, I mean the game has long legs and there's a lot of places to add things.

1305
00:57:37,715 --> 00:57:41,718
But my general strategy on this is I don't promise the future because I don't actually know.

1306
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:43,079
Thank you.

1307
00:57:43,399 --> 00:57:43,559
Okay.

1308
00:57:45,907 --> 00:57:48,329
Hey, you were talking about your, um, sorting system.

1309
00:57:48,529 --> 00:57:48,729
Yeah.

1310
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:55,415
And, um, is that a lot of different, I'm just trying to kind of get an idea of how

1311
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:59,018
that sorting system is, is that just a whole bunch of different numbers that you've.

1312
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:05,469
I know it's just put I it's a bubble sort which doesn't require it only

1313
00:58:05,509 --> 00:58:09,592
requires comparison one to one like the way I just approach it personally I

1314
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:12,394
thought about making make making a giant spreadsheet and putting numbers are

1315
00:58:12,735 --> 00:58:15,397
cost-benefit score or something like that and try to do some mathematical

1316
00:58:15,417 --> 00:58:19,560
thing but I find it so hard to put numbers on these things because they're

1317
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,724
so asymmetrical like you're comparing one task which is like you know let's

1318
00:58:25,064 --> 00:58:25,765
stabilize the.

1319
00:58:26,947 --> 00:58:31,829
the data loading XML reading system so the modders can use it more easily, versus like

1320
00:58:32,389 --> 00:58:36,411
let's add some butterfly men who will fly you to the moon or something like that.

1321
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:37,811
They're just so completely different.

1322
00:58:37,831 --> 00:58:45,074
I don't know how to compare those things, except for directly in sort of a very subconscious

1323
00:58:45,094 --> 00:58:46,035
evaluation type way.

1324
00:58:46,615 --> 00:58:48,416
So it's basically just bubble sort, one-to-one comparison.

1325
00:58:51,955 --> 00:58:54,356
Hey, do you find that you have to do a lot of work

1326
00:58:54,396 --> 00:58:56,376
to manage expectations of your players

1327
00:58:56,456 --> 00:58:59,097
if they don't really understand that the idea here

1328
00:58:59,137 --> 00:59:01,537
is that it's a story generator and not a classic game design?

1329
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:02,258
Definitely.

1330
00:59:02,278 --> 00:59:03,118
This is a really good question.

1331
00:59:03,698 --> 00:59:04,358
Thank you for asking.

1332
00:59:07,399 --> 00:59:10,519
OK, players have this notion where

1333
00:59:10,539 --> 00:59:11,900
they'll get really pissed off at a challenge

1334
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,940
if it seems illegitimate, and especially

1335
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,620
if they're losing to it.

1336
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,181
But if it seems somehow legitimate,

1337
00:59:16,221 --> 00:59:17,101
they'll totally accept it.

1338
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:19,421
So in RimWorld, we always have the problem

1339
00:59:20,511 --> 00:59:25,654
people get angry when their characters go crazy on a drinking binge or set the place

1340
00:59:25,694 --> 00:59:26,894
on fire because they're pyromaniacs.

1341
00:59:27,454 --> 00:59:33,518
But even if they don't lose that much, but if an enemy raid comes and just crushes them,

1342
00:59:33,798 --> 00:59:36,559
that seems more legitimate because it's from the outside and they have this notion that

1343
00:59:36,859 --> 00:59:37,860
my people should be mine.

1344
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:41,144
And that's an expectations problem, I think.

1345
00:59:41,264 --> 00:59:43,126
It's not something you necessarily fix on the actions,

1346
00:59:43,147 --> 00:59:44,588
it's something you fix in terms of setting

1347
00:59:44,608 --> 00:59:45,570
the player's expectations.

1348
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:49,034
So, I tried as much as possible in the marketing,

1349
00:59:49,675 --> 00:59:52,899
in the name of the storytellers.

1350
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,303
For example, the RimWorld has the AI storyteller

1351
00:59:55,343 --> 00:59:55,763
that you choose.

1352
00:59:57,387 --> 00:59:58,407
and this is very explicitly

1353
00:59:58,987 --> 00:59:59,467
done that way

1354
01:00:00,068 --> 01:00:01,848
uh... and just all the messaging around the game

1355
01:00:02,248 --> 01:00:04,189
to try to get people in the frame of

1356
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,290
you know you can enjoy when things are going bad

1357
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:09,151
it's here to see this crazy wacky stuff that goes on

1358
01:00:09,611 --> 01:00:11,071
even things like there's no you know

1359
01:00:11,331 --> 01:00:12,092
I'm not adding points

1360
01:00:12,572 --> 01:00:14,592
I won't add uh... steam achievements

1361
01:00:15,093 --> 01:00:15,653
for this reason

1362
01:00:15,973 --> 01:00:17,874
because as soon as I added that suddenly it would be about

1363
01:00:18,454 --> 01:00:20,134
getting those and that would displace the motivation

1364
01:00:20,854 --> 01:00:23,375
and just shatter the story frame

1365
01:00:24,556 --> 01:00:26,376
people can set their goals but that's really up to them

1366
01:00:28,866 --> 01:00:30,509
It's a lot of different stuff, basically.

1367
01:00:30,809 --> 01:00:31,610
It's a lot of different stuff.

1368
01:00:33,092 --> 01:00:35,676
And yeah, setting those expectations is critical.

1369
01:00:36,477 --> 01:00:37,238
Great, thank you.

1370
01:00:37,538 --> 01:00:37,819
Thank you.

1371
01:00:40,202 --> 01:00:41,824
All right, well, thank you everyone for coming.

1372
01:00:41,864 --> 01:00:43,126
And don't forget those evaluations.
