00:00:02,994 --> 00:00:09,016
Hi guys. You all look very tired. My name is Doro Apeyotese and I'm the VP of product

2
00:00:09,056 --> 00:00:15,698
verification and former VP of strategic initiatives at Paradox Interactive and we are hiring.

3
00:00:17,912 --> 00:00:23,320
Sound a bit more excited. Come on. Second of all, I just wanted to kind of remind everyone

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,467
the thing with the cell phones, turn them off and this stuff. But also maybe turn them

5
00:00:27,547 --> 00:00:31,233
back on again towards the end and give me a really good rating when the e‑mail comes

6
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:32,094
through so I can come again.

7
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:38,160
Finally, this is a surprisingly good turnout considering the topic. I realize it's not

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:44,705
the most accessible and maybe applicable for everyone. Just as a bit of housekeeping and

9
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:51,511
expectation management, who came just because we advertised that there would be jokes? Anyone

10
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:55,854
come for the jokes? One person came for the jokes. Two people. Okay. There aren't any.

11
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,392
No, I mean, look, I went through the presentation and I realized they weren't very good. To be

12
00:01:02,412 --> 00:01:12,218
fair, I did keep one. So look forward to me telling my joke. Start off, let's talk a bit of

13
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:18,041
background. So what was the strategic initiatives division, team, department, whatever, did we

14
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:20,442
really put a bunch of people in a room and have them brainstorm?

15
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:28,574
Of course not. It wasn't just that. So the Paradox SI division, like so many other things

16
00:01:28,614 --> 00:01:34,118
that are cool about Paradox, it was largely the brainchild of the CEO, most people who

17
00:01:34,138 --> 00:01:40,522
know anybody at Paradox know him. And well, basically Paradox has enjoyed a fair bit of

18
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:44,625
success and growth in recent years. I mean, right now maybe more so than ever. We're doing

19
00:01:44,685 --> 00:01:45,005
really well.

20
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:49,709
And Frederick wanted to make sure that the qualities that made the company successful thus

21
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:54,232
far, like company-wide collaboration, grassroots innovation, and a friendly, familiar

22
00:01:54,292 --> 00:02:01,637
culture, would not be lost just because the organization and number of staff changed. And

23
00:02:01,737 --> 00:02:05,760
not to mention the company going public, which he knew about at the time, but he didn't

24
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,042
tell me about. Which is pretty impressive, because we were pretty deep into his good

25
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:12,585
wine when we were discussing this at his house. And nonetheless, he wouldn't spill the

26
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:14,886
beans about the IPO. So good job, Frederick.

27
00:02:16,877 --> 00:02:28,770
This is a challenge all this time. I think most people who've had the pleasure and the horror of going from a small company to a medium-sized company to maybe a large company has been through this to some degree.

28
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:37,440
Something changes along the way. A lot of stuff for the good and some stuff for the not so good. And often, you know, innovation is one of the first things to go.

29
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:40,122
The reasons can be visualized.

30
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:42,944
For instance, if your company starts looking like this

31
00:02:42,984 --> 00:02:45,585
and you've got maybe 20 people divided between production

32
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,886
and maybe marketing or something,

33
00:02:46,906 --> 00:02:50,708
and then you start adding silos and levels of hierarchy,

34
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:53,450
then all of a sudden a lot of the natural flowing

35
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,131
conversation that would otherwise happen

36
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:56,972
is just not really going on anymore.

37
00:02:57,412 --> 00:02:59,554
And the idea with the strategic initiatives division

38
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:02,235
was to basically exist outside of this thing.

39
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:04,276
By the way, this is not an accurate representation

40
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:05,877
of what Paradox looked like at the time.

41
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:06,538
That would be insane.

42
00:03:07,078 --> 00:03:13,023
But just mental model. But to kind of be able to interact with the company at all these

43
00:03:13,063 --> 00:03:17,708
different levels and to produce cool new strategies that had been basically vetted by everyone

44
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:22,612
who needed to look at them before they got articulated. So that was a cool idea.

45
00:03:24,282 --> 00:03:30,527
Now, what was the workflow that we hoped would happen more or less automatically? A simple

46
00:03:30,607 --> 00:03:36,271
way of visualizing it was something like this. So we wanted a paradox employee, sometimes

47
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:41,335
someone within the SI division or elsewhere, but ideally someone from the grassroots that

48
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:47,639
would otherwise not really know how to go about getting their ideas through, would have

49
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:47,939
an idea.

50
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:54,666
And then flesh out a bit of a concept. And then, you know, get some advice maybe ideally

51
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:59,548
from someone within SI. And if they could execute it on their own, they would be asked

52
00:03:59,648 --> 00:04:03,150
to do so. Because we're very much that kind of company. We want people to execute on their

53
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,332
own stuff because the results are always a lot better and, you know, the drill. But if

54
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,774
they couldn't execute it and we still thought that it was a really good idea, it would be

55
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:16,517
a shame for it to kind of die there and then. So we wanted them to be able to hand it over

56
00:04:16,577 --> 00:04:17,097
to the SI.

57
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:25,102
division. And the kind of challenges that would require SI to adopt someone else's idea, we

58
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:30,645
predicted would be stuff like bandwidth and priorities. So where does this new task fit

59
00:04:30,685 --> 00:04:35,409
along all the other stuff you're having me do if someone's already pulling 45, 50-hour weeks,

60
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:40,912
which apparently happens in the games industry? Someone coming along and saying, hey, we've

61
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:45,735
got this new cool thing that we want you to look at. You should be happy not to get yelled at.

62
00:04:46,796 --> 00:04:50,261
Ownership, so which department takes the lead on this and why?

63
00:04:51,402 --> 00:04:55,467
Cross functional dependencies, so what do we need and what can we expect from other

64
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:56,409
departments or functions?

65
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:01,114
Unclear feasibility, should this even move beyond the idea stage?

66
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:06,225
And these challenges can all be solved, yes, but it's kind of expensive and time consuming

67
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:11,386
and stressful. And perhaps prohibitively so, especially for large initiatives. And also

68
00:05:11,426 --> 00:05:16,367
we didn't want to have this filter where the only people who ever got any ideas through

69
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:20,288
at Paradox were the ones who knew how to navigate these things. Right? Because those are not

70
00:05:20,348 --> 00:05:26,249
necessarily the people who have the best product ideas or services or what have you. They're

71
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:30,969
just very good at navigating the maze of getting stuff done. These are kind of different skill

72
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:31,370
sets. Right?

73
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,833
Once something did end up with SI, and just a reminder that could happen from everywhere in the

74
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:43,755
organization and some stuff actually started within SI, the execution workflow would be

75
00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:47,817
something like this. Number one, produce a strategy that takes all of the previously

76
00:05:47,857 --> 00:05:52,939
mentioned challenges into account. So feasibility, bandwidth, cross department

77
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:57,821
involvement and so on. Present this strategy to relevant stakeholders, making revisions

78
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:58,541
as necessary.

79
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:02,051
Number three, get sign-off from relevant stakeholders.

80
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:04,233
Number four, hand the project over,

81
00:06:04,293 --> 00:06:06,395
which is perhaps the most important thing.

82
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:10,438
So the one thing we did not want to have happen with SI

83
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:13,140
is that we end up actually both implementing

84
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,841
and then maintaining things.

85
00:06:14,981 --> 00:06:16,983
So whether we're talking product, services,

86
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:18,484
anything like that, the last thing we wanted

87
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:21,266
is to become yet another production business unit

88
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:22,968
within the org that just balloons

89
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:25,309
and keeps throwing people at problems.

90
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:26,230
And before you know it, you...

91
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:30,234
You're basically part of the line organization and you're not really doing any innovation

92
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:30,795
work anymore.

93
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:36,280
But of course we should be around to provide assistance as the initiative gets executed.

94
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:41,906
So one way of looking at it was that we were using, or sorry, doing a sort of pre-production

95
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,068
on new business ventures and improvement ideas.

96
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:48,033
And this would require a fair bit of width in our own competencies.

97
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:54,518
If someone from marketing needed to use the SI workflow or someone from biz dev or someone

98
00:06:54,558 --> 00:06:59,943
from product dev or someone from any department, we needed to be able to meet them halfway.

99
00:07:00,844 --> 00:07:04,086
My background is primarily in product development, game design, game development.

100
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:09,391
I got help later from a colleague named David who just added so much.

101
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:11,312
He worked in sales and stuff like that.

102
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:14,115
So we actually had a pretty good width to our services.

103
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:18,980
I wanted to look at a few of the initiatives because this is all very abstract so far.

104
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:24,207
So what were some of the things that we kind of articulated at least through SI.

105
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:33,167
Just a quick caveat, though. The stuff that I'm going to be showing here is stuff that we

106
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:37,948
worked on within SI, but the fact that we worked on it within SI doesn't mean that it ever

107
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:43,329
actually went further than SI. So the last thing I want is a bunch of click bait headlines. I

108
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:48,290
don't even know if there's media in here. But no headlines saying Paradox will do this thing

109
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,291
very, very soon because you'll look stupid when we don't. So, I'm going to be showing you

110
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:57,013
Just to look at a few of the initiatives, starting in Q3 2015 and all the way through to Q2

111
00:07:57,133 --> 00:08:01,956
2016 we did a lot of stuff. You see two colors, one being purple for myself and one being

112
00:08:01,976 --> 00:08:07,478
green for my colleague David. We are going to be looking at a few of these in a bit more

113
00:08:07,518 --> 00:08:13,261
detail over the next few slides. And the ones that I've picked out are the ones that fit

114
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:15,242
into very specific categories because

115
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:21,626
Well, basically there were three categories where all of these initiatives ended up. And we'll

116
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:25,028
talk about what those categories are as well. So we're going to focus on three specific

117
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:30,592
initiatives and starting with the creative workshop. So the question, because most of our

118
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:34,074
initiatives tried to kind of answer a question or some sort of problem statement, the

119
00:08:34,094 --> 00:08:38,336
question was how can we do a better job of identifying cool ideas from within the

120
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:42,939
organization and is there any way we can simplify the pitching of everything, in-house

121
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:43,860
pitching, internal pitching.

122
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:47,348
Games as well as other products, services and improvements.

123
00:08:48,522 --> 00:08:52,623
And we thought that this would be the first step in accomplishing the intended innovation

124
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:56,704
workflow. So this is kind of a natural first initiative. If you're going to have an innovation

125
00:08:57,024 --> 00:09:01,766
division where stuff from the grassroots makes it into the innovation department and then

126
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:06,607
gets executed on, there needs to be some way of making this happen. We had a few ideas

127
00:09:06,627 --> 00:09:10,789
that we were bouncing around and we kind of decided against sitting by the coffee machine

128
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:14,470
and water cooler and listening really, really hard. We didn't think that one would scale.

129
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,870
So we needed something else.

130
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,093
So what we did was we produced something that we called a creative workshop. It wasn't really

131
00:09:21,113 --> 00:09:26,176
that fancy. What it was is kind of like a digital idea box. Most of you have seen something like

132
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:32,079
this before. This is a Kanban board that we've made in JIRA. Where we have tickets. The cool

133
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:35,921
thing about tickets is you can put comments in there so they become kind of like a little forum.

134
00:09:36,461 --> 00:09:40,563
And you have the different columns with the different stages of the process. So you have

135
00:09:40,723 --> 00:09:42,264
when something is new, it's new.

136
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:48,549
obviously. And then you have feedback requested, feedback provided and then some sort of end

137
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:54,474
state, right? And I guess one thing that's also very cool is that we have the horizontal

138
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:59,478
swim lanes. So every category gets its own horizontal swim lane. So it could be stuff

139
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:03,521
like product dev, marketing, all these other things that we've gone through. General business

140
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:08,125
stuff, office stuff. We even put office supplier requests through this.

141
00:10:09,106 --> 00:10:15,491
And each and every one of these swim lanes actually had a curator from the specific subject

142
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:20,516
matter area. So you could actually get feedback as well as sometime a yes or no answer from

143
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:26,161
someone who actually was in the know. So we thought that was very cool. And the results were

144
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:31,686
kind of mixed. And we'll get back to exactly why. I mean, the actual product as such, if you

145
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:35,529
can call it that, it worked as intended. But we didn't really get

146
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:41,693
Quite as much traffic there as we would have hoped. We'll get back to why a bit later. Next

147
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:45,415
up we looked at something that had to do with crowd funding. So we were just going fully blue

148
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:51,239
sky, could we do crowd funding at Paradox in some way that doesn't feel anti-consumer and we

149
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,202
really love our fans. So the question was, yeah, as I say, consistent with our values and

150
00:10:56,262 --> 00:11:00,084
image, respectful to our fans and has synergies with the many other ideas that we have

151
00:11:00,164 --> 00:11:03,306
floating around. Some of which I really can't talk about because those might actually

152
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:03,546
happen.

153
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:08,431
And the initiative was something that we called Paradoxocracy.

154
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:11,614
I mean, I called it Paradoxocracy. Everyone else thought that sounded stupid.

155
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:17,599
So basically, both featured traditional crowdfunding, because there were multiple tiers to it.

156
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:23,384
We had the glorified pre-order thingy where you pay us money, we give you a t-shirt, and eventually maybe the game, if you're nice.

157
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:29,169
As well as experimental ideas like backers voting for game features.

158
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:36,070
So the idea was that depending on how much money you spent on a crowdfunding campaign, we

159
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:42,112
could give you tokens and you could vote for certain little things that we could do A or B or

160
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:46,134
C with and we would have a voting thing happen. Very experimental.

161
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:51,140
Don't think it should be too controversial. Some people immediately thought what are the

162
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,728
fans going to say. I think it would have gone over well here in America. I understand that the

163
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:59,993
Supreme Court has said that money is the same as speech. So there you go.

164
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,353
Central to the whole strategy was our having a virtual currency

165
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:08,576
though and we don't really have a relevant virtual currency that

166
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:11,478
could be used in this way so the results were basically that we

167
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:14,761
did not execute this. We didn't actually make this. We may yet

168
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:17,143
in the future though. We may call something else

169
00:12:17,243 --> 00:12:18,825
paradoxically because I think it's really clever.

170
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:23,062
Next up we did something called an internal culture audit.

171
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:25,104
So with some of the initiatives that I had worked on,

172
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:30,387
I experienced some pushback that I identified as cultural

173
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:32,428
and I kind of took a step back and asked some questions.

174
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:35,530
First of all, how does our actual culture map

175
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:37,292
to our desired and stated culture?

176
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:40,434
What means could we use to get closer to our goals?

177
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:47,208
And the outcome was very good in that we did an in-house culture audit. Well, I say we, I did an

178
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:54,994
in-house culture audit producing a mammoth 132 slide PowerPoint presentation. And we looked at

179
00:12:55,034 --> 00:13:00,458
stuff like what an organizational culture actually is, what factors shape organizational

180
00:13:00,498 --> 00:13:05,362
cultures in general, case studies from inside and outside the games industry. And we also made

181
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:10,245
an inventory of the paradox culture. And the results were good. So...

182
00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:18,091
Off the back of this, we actually started a pretty far-reaching and still rolling process

183
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:22,915
of not just doing an inventory but actually doing a bit of a revision and a rearticulation

184
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:26,858
of the internal paradox culture with a lot of really good activities that I think are

185
00:13:26,878 --> 00:13:28,879
going to really help us gel as a team.

186
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,723
And this stuff can kind of be tracked back to the work we did on the internal culture

187
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:35,444
audit and strategic initiatives.

188
00:13:36,385 --> 00:13:37,026
So yay me.

189
00:13:37,746 --> 00:13:40,048
Now, rates of success.

190
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:45,929
Well, overall, you remember that very first slide with a bunch of different things on there?

191
00:13:45,969 --> 00:13:50,435
That was not an exhaustive list. We did a lot more stuff. If you look at it statistically, we

192
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:54,460
have these three categories. We have good, we have mixed results and we have the stuff that was

193
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,121
not executed.

194
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:01,440
30% or so good, 30% or so mixed and 40% or so not executed.

195
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:03,762
And if you've worked at all with innovation

196
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:05,803
and initiatives like these at a company level,

197
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,984
these are not bad numbers.

198
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:07,925
These are pretty good.

199
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:10,807
But obviously I think we want to have them even better.

200
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:13,248
And we have this category called mixed.

201
00:14:13,388 --> 00:14:15,890
Some of the mixed results are more towards the good

202
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,431
and some towards the not so good.

203
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:24,784
So I want to hop into some learnings and tips because there are a lot of things that we

204
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:28,471
would have done a better job of if we would have known at the beginning of the whole SI

205
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:29,333
thing what we know now.

206
00:14:31,457 --> 00:14:37,500
Tip number one, take nothing at face value. Simply accepting a premise will lead to false

207
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:43,144
starts. So the people who describe a problem for you to solve are going to have various

208
00:14:43,184 --> 00:14:47,086
challenges themselves. They might be constrained by their vantage points. They will engage

209
00:14:47,206 --> 00:14:52,910
in wishful thinking. They may confuse facts and timelines and maybe be wrong in some other

210
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,090
way.

211
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:56,949
Like, let's take the creative workshop thing, for instance.

212
00:14:56,989 --> 00:14:57,709
Go back to that one.

213
00:14:58,229 --> 00:14:59,949
The assumption from everyone up front

214
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:02,790
was that people were simply dying within Paradox

215
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,471
to communicate their cool ideas somewhere.

216
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:06,711
But the behavior, once the system had been implemented,

217
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:07,871
didn't really reflect that.

218
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:08,812
I mean, there were some people

219
00:15:08,852 --> 00:15:10,192
who were really super enthusiastic.

220
00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:13,013
What didn't happen was this big, massive blowout

221
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:14,513
of really cool, actionable ideas

222
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:16,354
that we could just make billions off of.

223
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:22,821
So if you get such an unexpected result, that's sometimes a blessing. You should ask yourself,

224
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:29,051
what do I believe about my own company that simply isn't so, and try to kind of dig into that a little bit.

225
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:35,314
So when you're given a mission, like for example, provide people with tools to innovate, can

226
00:15:35,354 --> 00:15:40,157
we find ways to make people live our culture more, head up our new innovation department

227
00:15:40,197 --> 00:15:44,781
and incubate awesome stuff, do everyone a favor and push back on the premise just a

228
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:45,241
little bit.

229
00:15:46,102 --> 00:15:50,184
Figure out what the background is, what is assumed and or taken for granted so that you

230
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:54,768
don't end up exhausting yourself working the wrong angles and solving non‑problems.

231
00:15:56,567 --> 00:16:03,150
Next up, stress test your mandate. So some change will always come at the expense, real or

232
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:09,333
perceived, of some people. It follows that some people will have a vested interest in your

233
00:16:09,393 --> 00:16:14,275
failing. Most important thing is not to figure out who these people are and target them but

234
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:19,338
rather to figure out what to do in general if and when this happens. Different people may work

235
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:23,040
against you or at least not help you at different times for different reasons and you should

236
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,341
probably know what to do if and when that happens.

237
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:29,457
I would suggest to apply good game dev prototyping practices.

238
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:34,618
Identify your deal breakers, try to provoke those deal breakers to happen as early as

239
00:16:34,658 --> 00:16:40,260
you can, and at the very least have the uncomfortable hypothetical discussions with your sponsors,

240
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,560
managers, what have you.

241
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:45,922
Who has the right to say no to me at what point and for what reasons?

242
00:16:46,682 --> 00:16:49,943
Who can I escalate to if I feel that somebody is being uncooperative?

243
00:16:51,023 --> 00:16:54,024
Once a decision has been made, whose responsibility is it to enforce?

244
00:16:55,266 --> 00:17:01,279
And of course hypothetical discussions aren't as good as the real thing. So when, not if,

245
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,109
when your progress grinds to a halt, make whatever is blocking you the number one priority.

246
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:12,581
Because if something or someone is blocking you, you may have a hurdle there that is going

247
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:16,642
to happen again and again and again unless you solve it right then and there, especially

248
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:22,004
if it's something that someone is doing. If they get away with it once, now they have

249
00:17:22,044 --> 00:17:27,606
a tool that they can use repeatedly. So whenever something needs escalating, just do it. However

250
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,287
impopular that makes you within your first six months of working at a place.

251
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:37,186
Next up, this is a bit of a trick of mine. I like to itemize and map out the relevant forces.

252
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:43,575
I like to think that I'm a reasonably empathic person and I like to apply that in a somewhat sociopathic way.

253
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:49,342
I just kind of like to reduce certain things down to kind of things and assign strength values to them.

254
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:50,083
I guess that's a bit of a...

255
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:56,529
game design occupational hazard, thinking that way. But I suggest developing an understanding

256
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:01,473
of the forces working for or against you, including the individuals, so the role, formal

257
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:06,597
authority, informal influence and so on. Culture, so relevant aspects of course, like is the

258
00:18:06,637 --> 00:18:11,441
culture conservative, is it consensus minded, whatever. The company structure in the formal

259
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:11,681
sense.

260
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:20,151
The makeup of the executive team, et cetera. Processes, so what do and what don't we already

261
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:25,775
know how to do with consistent results. Strategy, so where does the company see itself in the

262
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:30,958
medium and long term and where does innovation fit into that. Like how important is innovation

263
00:18:30,998 --> 00:18:36,601
or innovation processes to the goals of the company. And then I suggest assigning a strength

264
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:40,303
value to these factors and prioritizing them accordingly. For example.

265
00:18:41,404 --> 00:18:45,027
Stronger forces at the bottom, weaker ones at the top. You've got your tier 1 forces like you

266
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:49,610
have a snowflake culture or something, a very strong focus on profitability. These don't

267
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:55,495
need to be tied to individuals. Sometimes they just exist in the walls. CEOs of authority

268
00:18:55,535 --> 00:19:00,079
and influence, ambitious growth targets, a strong but reactive board that's not going to

269
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:05,603
step in unless a lot of money is lost. You may have an enthusiastic executive team and a

270
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:09,726
complete lack of innovation or change management processes. These will obviously

271
00:19:10,427 --> 00:19:14,088
change over time. That's kind of the point. That's why you're there. But it's really good

272
00:19:14,128 --> 00:19:17,870
to kind of have these organized in this way because sometimes you can basically take a

273
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:23,952
high level idea or whatever you were going to do and just do a little pretest against

274
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:28,514
this and just kind of figure out where the minefields are going to be. I'm going to be

275
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:33,036
working on this one thing where I don't know when it will be profitable. Well, you're in

276
00:19:33,096 --> 00:19:35,897
conflict with a tier 1 force. You may want to be careful with that one.

277
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:39,378
Next up, obviously account for scale.

278
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:42,465
So for the initiatives that I've outlined,

279
00:19:42,585 --> 00:19:44,525
which factor do you think was the biggest predictor

280
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:45,246
of success?

281
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:47,546
The short answer is the size of the initiative.

282
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,268
So every time an initiative scales up to involve more

283
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:55,329
people, departments, resources,

284
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:58,090
your challenges automatically multiply.

285
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,290
There are simply more things that can fail

286
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,571
because complexity goes up.

287
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:02,511
This is not news to us.

288
00:20:05,532 --> 00:20:07,513
This is the one thing that we had hoped to solve

289
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:08,993
that we didn't really manage to.

290
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:15,238
It was just as hard, like it scaled as much for us as it did for anyone else as we started,

291
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,579
you know, requiring more stuff and there were more dependencies.

292
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:20,139
I don't have any silver bullet for this one.

293
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,500
I think this may go down in history as just like the brute force problem.

294
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,720
You just have to work your way through it.

295
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:33,622
I mean, we still had an easier time in absolute terms than an average employee would have,

296
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:36,643
but that was mostly because we had the time and resources.

297
00:20:37,023 --> 00:20:39,883
It was time consuming and resource consuming to solve some of these issues.

298
00:20:42,286 --> 00:20:50,654
Final thoughts. So was strategic initiatives as a thing a good idea? Yes. Yes. I may have

299
00:20:50,674 --> 00:20:54,098
sounded kind of critical up until this point but yes, absolutely. The thing is

300
00:20:55,092 --> 00:20:58,634
Even if not every initiative that we executed on yielded the results that we hoped for,

301
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:04,297
the fact remains that without the SI divisions, the things that we actually managed to deliver

302
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:08,219
on would not have happened. At least not the way Paradox was configured at that time.

303
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:12,822
And since we've not really tried any other configuration just yet, I have to say that

304
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:15,963
overall I'm really happy that we did it this way. That's not to say there's not a better

305
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,906
way to do it. Also, right now we're in the process of kind of doing a

306
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:22,488
A bit of a retake on some of this stuff.

307
00:21:22,508 --> 00:21:25,431
So we're kind of reorganizing the whole innovation pipeline a little bit.

308
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:29,595
And one of the things that's happened is we actually have an external vendor.

309
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:31,196
I think I'm allowed to say this.

310
00:21:32,938 --> 00:21:36,862
They're kind of helping us a little bit with looking at these things, you know, with innovation

311
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:37,202
and stuff.

312
00:21:37,222 --> 00:21:41,526
And one of the first things that they suggested was, hey, have you ever thought of a ticketing

313
00:21:41,546 --> 00:21:41,887
system?

314
00:21:43,174 --> 00:21:47,815
Yes, we actually have a ticketing system. That's not the challenge. The challenge is getting

315
00:21:47,855 --> 00:21:53,336
people to use it at the rate that we want. But theirs is better, mind you. They actually

316
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:57,358
have apps and stuff like that. Obviously I wasn't about to start building it to that

317
00:21:57,398 --> 00:22:02,199
extent. But conceptually the idea was a good one. So some things were good in theory, but

318
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:07,300
we just couldn't execute at the level where we should have. Nonetheless, doesn't mean

319
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,581
that SI was a bad idea.

320
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:15,213
I will say, though, that both the things that went well and the things that didn't go so

321
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:21,054
well were probably because paradox is paradox. And ultimately this whole thing may not be

322
00:22:21,094 --> 00:22:26,935
for you. Because your culture is your culture. Your organization is what it is. I'm sure

323
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:33,537
very different if you're EA or if you're Valve. But at least think about it. I think there

324
00:22:33,577 --> 00:22:37,998
are ways of working with this that can kind of be made to work if you really care.

325
00:22:38,738 --> 00:22:43,881
Try. And if you're doing it honestly. So if you don't want to take the plunge with both feet,

326
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:48,183
for instance, you might consider a more flexible solution. So maybe employees with cool ideas

327
00:22:48,664 --> 00:22:54,807
could be given like a temporary seat in SI, sort of like a mission to evaluate something further.

328
00:22:55,528 --> 00:22:59,790
Maybe during downtime between projects, I've heard that there are certain studios where

329
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:05,654
people basically get benched waiting for new projects to come around. Not naming them, but,

330
00:23:06,074 --> 00:23:07,135
some of them might be in Montreal.

331
00:23:08,527 --> 00:23:12,750
And once their idea is properly fleshed out and approved, they can then help to execute.

332
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:17,753
Right? So it could look like this. And this is my awesome diagrams again. But an employee

333
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:22,376
might have an idea, go before some sort of approval committee, yes? And then get taken

334
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,823
So we're going to take that away from that flow and put it into the SI division where they can

335
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:31,567
flesh out a concept together with other clever people and then maybe after that be put into

336
00:23:31,607 --> 00:23:35,471
the team that handles the execution of that same thing. So thus being part of the whole flow

337
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:40,275
and actually managing to midwife their own idea or whatever you call it. So, you know,

338
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:45,978
As it so happens, both me and David are actually in new roles.

339
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:52,100
So I was VP of strategic initiatives and one of the strategic initiatives that I suggested

340
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:59,982
was really well received. So much so that they said we can't imagine anyone else doing it.

341
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:03,324
So they just kind of plucked me right out of there. And same thing with David,

342
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:07,725
because he worked on some stuff with our friends at Tencent and that went over really well.

343
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:15,667
plugged him out too. So I guess that's a good place to wrap up. So the two people who were in

344
00:24:15,707 --> 00:24:21,749
charge of innovation managed to innovate themselves right out of the innovation team. And

345
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:28,170
I suppose you could call that a paradox. I'll take groans. It's okay.

346
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:28,471
Thank you!

347
00:24:36,093 --> 00:24:36,753
Any questions?

348
00:24:41,784 --> 00:24:45,808
Oh, thank you. I don't know this man. I have not paid him to do this.

349
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:57,160
Where was the joke? How big was your team? Was it a few people? Was it tens of people? Did it

350
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,864
scale up and down as you did different things or was it like a fixed number of people?

351
00:25:01,444 --> 00:25:08,648
So the question was how big the team was and did we scale it up and down with the size of the initiative and the thing that was being worked on.

352
00:25:08,688 --> 00:25:15,151
So the only permanents were myself and my colleague David, at least in the way the SI division used to look.

353
00:25:15,191 --> 00:25:19,033
In the newer permutation we actually have more people but the roles are a little bit different.

354
00:25:20,094 --> 00:25:23,636
What we would do then when something would scale up is that we would use like outsourcers

355
00:25:23,677 --> 00:25:29,281
and stuff. So one of the things that actually happened off the back of something that my

356
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:34,865
colleague David did was this whole thing with the choose your own adventure electronic book

357
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:37,827
things that we've been releasing a little bit. I don't know how many of you have caught

358
00:25:37,847 --> 00:25:42,070
that. That actually came out of SI. And the first iteration was actually done exclusively

359
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:46,453
with outsource vendors. So. Yes?

360
00:25:47,293 --> 00:26:14,682
Thanks for the talk. I'm wondering, so you mentioned in the workflow that some of the ideas submitted by the employees will just go directly to them if it's executable just in the team. So do you have any examples of game features that you guys looked at and eventually went back to the games team? Like how much influence do you have on game feature, strategy about game features? You think this is very important, you should add in it versus just cross-company initiatives?

361
00:26:14,802 --> 00:26:19,525
Yeah, so the question is how much influence did the SI division but more importantly the

362
00:26:19,565 --> 00:26:24,549
workflow itself have on game team features and so on. Actually quite little because they

363
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:28,251
have their own process for that kind of stuff. But what we did have is we had some ideas

364
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:33,234
that had to do with corollary things that were not really part of the current scope

365
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:40,659
of the game project. So there was one gentleman that had a really cool idea, like one thing

366
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:41,279
that's pretty big.

367
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,245
Our strategy games are the so-called after action reports where people write down their game sessions and stuff like that.

368
00:26:48,285 --> 00:26:53,590
And he had a really cool idea about having a system that would at least partially maybe automate that.

369
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,452
So that we got more of them. It was a really cool thing. And then he quit.

370
00:26:59,697 --> 00:27:04,820
We'll pick that up someday, I'm sure. But those kinds of things. This was also a place to get

371
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,722
feedback but also to some degree it was a way to get attention of the people who can sign the

372
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:12,424
checks and say, well, this sounds good enough that we can actually give you the hours that you

373
00:27:12,444 --> 00:27:16,386
need to put on this and not have it be something that you're supposed to do in your own time

374
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:19,707
because that's just not how it works. Thank you.

375
00:27:24,007 --> 00:27:32,051
I have a question about the strategy initiative. So actually I think it's hard to value how much

376
00:27:32,111 --> 00:27:41,857
money you can make through your department. So why the paradox can establish this permanent

377
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:45,739
department within your company and make sure that thing is worth running?

378
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:51,033
So the question is, it's very difficult to assess how much money and what kind of return

379
00:27:51,093 --> 00:27:56,157
on investment that we can get from doing something like this. We did it because we're Paradox

380
00:27:56,197 --> 00:28:00,861
and this is the kind of stuff that we do. If it's small enough scale, Frederick will

381
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:05,504
basically go, let's try this and we will try it. But of course part of the ‑‑

382
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:11,390
hope was that the work that we did would kind of validate itself eventually, if that makes

383
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:15,955
sense. So we would not have run it indefinitely. We were keeping track of the amount of

384
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:20,220
billable hours and if nothing actionable would have come out of SI, it would have died,

385
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:26,026
guaranteed. What happened now, though, is that we did a lot of stuff that actually went

386
00:28:26,086 --> 00:28:27,468
somewhere, which is a very good thing.

387
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:36,112
And I don't know if there is any way of knowing where the threshold should be ahead of time for

388
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:43,036
profitability, but I'm pretty sure that in this case we did reach it because I still have a job.

389
00:28:45,877 --> 00:28:46,677
Does that answer the question?

390
00:28:47,098 --> 00:28:48,038
Yeah, I think so.

391
00:28:48,198 --> 00:28:48,598
Thank you.

392
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:51,680
Is there time for another question?

393
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,401
For me it's fine, yes.

394
00:28:54,796 --> 00:29:01,483
So what were some of the strategies that you used to get stakeholder influence when it came to creating the Strategic Initiatives Program?

395
00:29:02,861 --> 00:29:06,723
So the question is what kind of strategies we use to get stakeholder influence and buy

396
00:29:06,763 --> 00:29:07,583
in from the stakeholders.

397
00:29:07,603 --> 00:29:08,103
Yeah, exactly.

398
00:29:08,443 --> 00:29:08,883
Well, there you go.

399
00:29:08,903 --> 00:29:13,785
So that is work that was actually done by the CEO, Frederick, before I even hit the

400
00:29:13,805 --> 00:29:15,626
ground, before I was even in the office.

401
00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:21,748
So I showed up and this had already been kind of advertised within Paradox and he kind of

402
00:29:21,788 --> 00:29:22,889
handled that more or less himself.

403
00:29:22,949 --> 00:29:25,269
But there was an element of maintenance.

404
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:31,875
So it was kind of, you know, like I said to the gentleman just now, we were expected to

405
00:29:31,915 --> 00:29:35,719
continuously kind of validate and justify our own existence to some degree.

406
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:42,245
And with some people I think the tolerance and patience was a bit, should we say,

407
00:29:44,457 --> 00:29:52,025
different. Some people were a little bit harsher on us, I guess. But I think eventually, as I say,

408
00:29:52,145 --> 00:29:57,310
there is a more modern permutation. We're still doing it to some extent, even without me in the

409
00:29:57,791 --> 00:30:03,576
team. So I think overall we managed to do it. As for specific techniques that I would use,

410
00:30:03,616 --> 00:30:06,940
I guess that overall I'm a big fan of just ‑‑

411
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,861
Catering to people's wallets.

412
00:30:09,202 --> 00:30:12,485
Like find some angle where you're solving other people's problems.

413
00:30:13,926 --> 00:30:15,828
Or at least pretending you're solving their problems.

414
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:19,611
And that should probably get you funded at least until you've proven that you're not

415
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:20,892
actually solving any problems.

416
00:30:21,893 --> 00:30:22,213
Gotcha.

417
00:30:22,313 --> 00:30:22,553
Thanks.

418
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:25,576
I think that's about it.

419
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:26,777
Thank you so much for coming everyone.
