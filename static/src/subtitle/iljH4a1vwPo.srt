1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,551
So thank you all for coming.

2
00:00:07,972 --> 00:00:09,673
Welcome to HoloLens and Beyond.

3
00:00:10,374 --> 00:00:12,515
My name is Bart Schneidlowski, and I'll be discussing

4
00:00:12,655 --> 00:00:15,578
augmented reality game design challenges and open problems.

5
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:17,880
So just a little bit about me.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,381
I'm not actually a game developer,

7
00:00:19,421 --> 00:00:20,942
nor am I an augmented reality developer,

8
00:00:20,982 --> 00:00:22,584
but I've been spending a lot of time with it lately.

9
00:00:23,364 --> 00:00:24,285
Just out of personal interest,

10
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:26,827
you can find out more about me by visiting my website.

11
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,197
Augmented reality is set to explode.

12
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:32,178
I think everybody recognizes that at this point.

13
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,360
And it's an exciting time.

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,741
Right now, I think you can divide devices up

15
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:39,243
into two categories, mobile and headset.

16
00:00:39,843 --> 00:00:41,004
Mobile is pretty ubiquitous.

17
00:00:41,144 --> 00:00:42,345
I think almost everyone in this room

18
00:00:42,385 --> 00:00:44,046
probably has a device that can do AR.

19
00:00:44,686 --> 00:00:46,667
But how many people here, just a show of hands,

20
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:48,148
have used an AR headset?

21
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:51,430
Wow, so actually quite a lot, more than I expected.

22
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,355
So right now the HoloLens is the leading edge device,

23
00:00:56,695 --> 00:00:57,816
despite being two years old.

24
00:00:57,836 --> 00:01:00,638
And that's what I've been using

25
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,060
to do my AR game development experiments.

26
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:06,722
Just an overview of the capabilities

27
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:07,683
for those who might not know.

28
00:01:08,523 --> 00:01:09,924
It's a fully self-contained computer.

29
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:12,947
It's untethered, no connection to Wi-Fi necessary.

30
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:14,588
You can walk around the room, do whatever you'd like.

31
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:19,560
It has a depth camera for acquiring the geometry of the environment that you're in, as well

32
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,981
as detecting hand gestures.

33
00:01:21,502 --> 00:01:25,304
Now gesture support is very limited, it's not like a Leap Motion device, that's why

34
00:01:25,324 --> 00:01:28,226
you won't really see a lot of hand stuff going on in my demos.

35
00:01:29,727 --> 00:01:34,250
It has excellent spatial audio capability that's often overlooked, it can do 3D positional

36
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,432
audio very convincingly, and it has voice recognition.

37
00:01:39,255 --> 00:01:43,138
So I've been doing a lot of just little prototypes and games in my spare time.

38
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:45,120
Two of them are up on the HoloLens app store.

39
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,141
And I'll just kind of go through those

40
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:48,082
really quickly to show you kind of what I've been working on.

41
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,811
So this one is just a straightforward helicopter action game.

42
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:01,206
controlled by an Xbox 360 pad.

43
00:02:02,086 --> 00:02:04,727
And it was inspired by Electronic Arts' Strike series,

44
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:07,748
if everybody remembers Jungle Strike or Desert Strike

45
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:15,111
back in the early 90s, that was my inspiration for this.

46
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:17,172
The next game that I've released is very different.

47
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:19,493
It's an educational game, it teaches you

48
00:02:19,993 --> 00:02:23,094
how to ask for and understand spoken Japanese directions.

49
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:27,127
You play a little bear, you have to guide him around a town,

50
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:30,369
delivering honey and asking for the location of the next customer.

51
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:34,691
And there are segments throughout the game that will introduce progressively more vocabulary,

52
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:37,132
so you actually look away and take like a little mini lesson.

53
00:02:54,414 --> 00:02:55,875
Go straight.

54
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:57,997
Turn left at the second street.

55
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:58,717
Go straight.

56
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:03,301
Turn left at the second street.

57
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:30,052
So that's the the gist of those 2 games. Let's talk about game flow first of all

58
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:33,954
a typical AR game involves scanning the environment first the device can

59
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:37,977
acquire the 3D geometry of the level and then that is retained.

60
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:42,680
Placement comes next. This can be done automatically you can place units based

61
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,962
on the geometry you have or in some cases scanning and placement are

62
00:03:46,002 --> 00:03:49,945
actually the same thing. In Doko Desu ka the user places things as the

63
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:53,507
depth cameras turned on and there's no actual pre-scanning phase.

64
00:03:55,001 --> 00:04:01,105
So once you're done placing it's time to play and you can optionally continue to

65
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:03,826
refine the scan and use the depth camera during playtime.

66
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:09,669
Challenges in AR game design I think can really be broken down into two big broad

67
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,531
areas and that's challenges with the unpredictable environment and challenges

68
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:15,573
with the players unfamiliarity using an AR headset.

69
00:04:17,194 --> 00:04:19,415
The environment is obviously unpredictable, you have no idea where

70
00:04:19,455 --> 00:04:20,516
someone's going to be playing the game.

71
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:22,016
It could be here.

72
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:25,886
in the bathroom for whatever reason or on an airplane.

73
00:04:25,906 --> 00:04:27,669
You have absolutely no idea, but your game

74
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:29,871
will be expected to work in any environment.

75
00:04:32,534 --> 00:04:34,637
The placement and level design challenge, I would say,

76
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:35,858
is mostly a technical challenge.

77
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,501
And I like to think of it as topology and context,

78
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,562
the two big factors here.

79
00:04:39,623 --> 00:04:40,263
What I mean by that.

80
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,505
Topology, I mean, does the object actually fit within the topographic area that you have

81
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:50,589
physically, without actually asking whether it belongs there.

82
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:52,951
So for example, why are these crystals on my toilet?

83
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:53,652
I have no idea.

84
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:55,153
They probably don't belong there.

85
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:59,377
Context would answer that question, and that's a matter of detecting objects.

86
00:04:59,677 --> 00:05:04,402
So in this photograph, the character was actually placed after the couch was detected.

87
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:12,144
Another design challenge that I found personally is the issue of scale.

88
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:17,366
So in a traditional game, you have complete control over the scale of the levels, the

89
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:18,707
user's perspective and so forth.

90
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:20,448
That's not the case in AR.

91
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:25,890
And I found that you want to have your holograms be relatively large to be kind of compelling.

92
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:29,400
and also the hardware doesn't really have the fidelity to support, you know,

93
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,640
micro-machine-sized vehicles running around.

94
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,781
But that also introduces the challenge of, you know, how do you scale,

95
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:38,023
for example, physical buildings if you want to have them realistic compared to your objects.

96
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,523
So it's an artistic issue.

97
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:44,585
In this screenshot, it's hard to see, but the helicopter is way too big relative to the building,

98
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,466
and it's something that I never really thought about, but I think as an artist,

99
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:52,168
or as artists, you might want to consider that before embarking on an AR game.

100
00:05:53,948 --> 00:05:55,569
The way placement works in the helicopter game.

101
00:05:56,715 --> 00:05:58,436
I want to start off by having, you know,

102
00:05:58,456 --> 00:06:01,077
I want the maximum distance between structures in the game.

103
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:02,438
So there's a helipad in a building.

104
00:06:02,638 --> 00:06:05,860
And ironically, this screenshot shows an erroneous placement

105
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,340
where they're placed right next to each other.

106
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,582
That sometimes happens, the constraint solver fails.

107
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:13,103
I do this by generating multiple different, you know,

108
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:15,565
sizes of objects and different separation distances.

109
00:06:15,665 --> 00:06:16,985
I do a bunch of trial placements

110
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:18,826
and I pick the one that scores best.

111
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,628
Vehicles are much more straightforward.

112
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,950
I distribute them between elevated surfaces and the floor.

113
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:27,896
Oftentimes the scan will not have any elevated surfaces,

114
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:29,596
in which case they just fall back on the floor.

115
00:06:31,897 --> 00:06:33,217
Now there's a big opportunity for people

116
00:06:33,237 --> 00:06:35,478
that want to kind of move the field forward to,

117
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:38,499
I think, to develop better constraint and placement solvers.

118
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:40,759
The options right now, there's a few of them.

119
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,540
They allow you to kind of specify some basic constraints,

120
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,901
but they're not very flexible.

121
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:47,761
I think there's really a huge amount of opportunity

122
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:49,002
to really do something much better.

123
00:06:50,462 --> 00:06:52,142
Dynamic navigation planning is a big thing,

124
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:53,383
being able to incorporate.

125
00:06:53,992 --> 00:06:57,353
you know new areas are scanned dynamically into like a much more robust

126
00:06:57,373 --> 00:07:00,495
and have mesh type system I think that doesn't really exist off the shelf yet

127
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:05,516
and the big one is object recognition segmentation to provide context

128
00:07:06,157 --> 00:07:10,038
so that allow you to do more interesting and relevant placements around the room

129
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,060
or whatever area you're in and of course facilitate character interactions with

130
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,640
the environment

131
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,662
and on that note you know what we do with object recognition when I when I

132
00:07:19,702 --> 00:07:22,162
took this picture I immediately thought I don't know how many people remember

133
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:23,063
Duke Nukem

134
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,991
the iconic alien scene, right?

135
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:28,992
But this is just kind of silly,

136
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:30,512
but obviously you could imagine doing

137
00:07:30,592 --> 00:07:31,953
much more powerful interactions.

138
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,773
And in the way that Pokemon Go kind of inspired people

139
00:07:34,813 --> 00:07:36,874
to go out and explore, just get out of the house,

140
00:07:37,534 --> 00:07:38,974
you can imagine in the future having games

141
00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:41,535
that encourage people to just go around

142
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:43,616
and explore how different objects interact

143
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:44,936
with their characters or their game,

144
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:46,256
like what abilities are unlocked

145
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:47,537
and what could possibly happen.

146
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:50,618
I think that's a hugely powerful aspect of AR

147
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:52,318
that I expect to see really explode

148
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,098
the next couple of years.

149
00:07:54,804 --> 00:07:56,526
This is just a wish list for placement solvers.

150
00:07:56,546 --> 00:07:58,989
I'm going to just skip over this and leave this for people who can,

151
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:00,291
you know, want to download the talk later.

152
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:03,574
While I was developing the helicopter game,

153
00:08:03,654 --> 00:08:07,018
one challenge that I encountered was the AI helicopter

154
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:08,760
had a lot of difficulty navigating around.

155
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:13,168
The room rooms are actually very cluttered in this case, you can see it

156
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:18,209
bumping into my what the hole and sees my office chair. So I I tried,

157
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:21,269
you know, basically just ray casting and just a kind of a heuristic approach.

158
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:24,590
I you know, it's inside don't have control of the level. I thought that I

159
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,010
can kind of get away with this. Well, it turns out it doesn't really work

160
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,871
very well. So I had to essentially create like a din you know, a dynamic

161
00:08:31,651 --> 00:08:32,871
aerial nav mesh of sorts.

162
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,612
Now you can see the helicopter is able to navigate around the office chair

163
00:08:36,632 --> 00:08:37,532
without any difficulty.

164
00:08:39,163 --> 00:08:42,364
So it's an interesting problem to have to consider.

165
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:44,204
You want to consider where the empty space is

166
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:46,245
as well as where actual items are.

167
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:49,866
To accomplish this, I just basically sampled the space

168
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:51,406
ahead of time after the scan is complete.

169
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:54,347
Here you see what are basically the center points

170
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:56,627
of volumes and there are edges between.

171
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:57,647
So this forms a graph.

172
00:08:58,448 --> 00:08:59,828
The yellow color coding indicates

173
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:01,448
the largest island in the graph.

174
00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:03,369
So white nodes are not accessible

175
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,649
from the yellow nodes and vice versa.

176
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:06,970
And green is a particular pathway that you can take.

177
00:09:07,989 --> 00:09:11,252
And you have to build this essentially dynamically when the level is first scanned.

178
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:18,299
Because you don't have control over the level, spawning vehicles in the middle of the game

179
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,521
is a challenge, a design challenge I would say.

180
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:25,165
And I got around, the way I do it in my game is I have these hidden tunnels.

181
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,762
So it's kind of a fun effect, but a little bit gimmicky at the same time.

182
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:40,662
You don't want to overuse it.

183
00:09:41,503 --> 00:09:44,805
For aerial vehicles, I use flyovers, which makes excellent use

184
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:45,986
of the spatial audio capabilities.

185
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:48,227
You can really hear the helicopters coming up from behind and over you.

186
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:51,710
Let's see.

187
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:55,993
And this problem with static scenery, so.

188
00:09:57,534 --> 00:09:58,435
the room is not going to change.

189
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:00,637
The player is going to be playing a particular physical location,

190
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:01,317
you can't change it.

191
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:05,641
And that actually deprives us of a key reward mechanism.

192
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:09,044
And that is just seeing the environment change.

193
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:11,365
So for example, in a traditional game like here's Sonic,

194
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:13,948
the player's ability stay the same throughout the game.

195
00:10:14,228 --> 00:10:17,971
But a big motivator for going forward is seeing what the next level actually looks like.

196
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:21,874
And I never really realized how much games actually depend on this reward mechanic.

197
00:10:22,374 --> 00:10:24,676
And it's totally absent in augmented reality, unfortunately.

198
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:27,078
So you kind of have to think about ways to work around that limitation.

199
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,242
I think one solution that's very clear is to empower the player to alter their own reality.

200
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:37,085
I've been told that Microsoft's acquisition of Minecraft was actually largely driven by

201
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:41,627
their mixed reality plans going forward, so this is kind of a concept image of what Minecraft

202
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:42,187
might look like.

203
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:48,511
But even without doing a sandbox, totally open-ended game, I think you can adapt a game

204
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:53,093
like say a platformer, while introducing a level design and alteration game mechanic

205
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,954
that gives people the freedom to alter their environment.

206
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:56,054
So I developed this.

207
00:10:57,154 --> 00:11:00,138
prototype as part of a kind of short competition that I entered last year.

208
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:05,465
And you'll see Mega Man running around and collecting power-ups that allow him

209
00:11:05,505 --> 00:11:08,188
to extrude different kinds of platforms and the objective is kind of get to the

210
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:08,769
next power-up.

211
00:11:29,451 --> 00:11:31,292
So this is all controlled in the Xbox controller.

212
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,616
In my original idea, you can imagine taking this to a much greater extent,

213
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:41,538
not just platforms, but having all kinds of deformations to the level, you know, say pushing.

214
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,521
things into walls, carving out tunnels, you know, bridges.

215
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:48,163
By the end of the game I would imagine that the entire room would be kind of transformed

216
00:11:48,183 --> 00:11:49,383
with all kinds of interesting elements.

217
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:52,265
And I think that this game mechanic would work for other kinds of games,

218
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:55,247
like say a Bomberman type game or some sort of a competitive game.

219
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:57,508
It's something that I haven't really seen done,

220
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:00,350
and I think it's an idea that I would personally like to revisit

221
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,872
once more AR headsets become available and kind of commonplace.

222
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,695
So I had a lot of fun making it, and people that have tried it out have had a lot of fun playing it.

223
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:15,119
Another big design challenge is the fact that the player controls the camera.

224
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:17,242
The player's head is the camera, much like VR.

225
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:20,545
You can't really force a player to gaze in a particular location.

226
00:12:21,686 --> 00:12:26,672
Unlike VR, however, at least home VR, you have near unlimited ability to walk around.

227
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,694
You can walk around the room without fear of tripping over things

228
00:12:28,774 --> 00:12:30,996
because you are still in your real space.

229
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:32,938
And that should be leveraged, I think.

230
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:35,872
but the narrative challenge still remains

231
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:38,814
and I think you can kiss cinematic sequences goodbye

232
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:39,435
for the most part.

233
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:41,716
But interestingly on mobile,

234
00:12:41,856 --> 00:12:42,957
they're still perfectly doable.

235
00:12:43,037 --> 00:12:46,519
You can switch between a augmented and non-augmented mode.

236
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,600
So that's one key difference

237
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,321
between the platforms, I would say.

238
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:55,571
Something that I encounter a lot when I demo the HoloLens to friends is what I call the

239
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:56,012
freeze.

240
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:59,875
So here my coworker kind of forgets that he can walk around until I point out that, hey,

241
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:01,637
you can actually move around and get a better view of things.

242
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:07,722
It's surprisingly common, and I think that since AR devices are going to be a novelty

243
00:13:07,762 --> 00:13:11,665
for several years and you want to kind of keep in mind demoing these things, you have

244
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:15,509
to come up with strategies to draw the player out and make them realize that, hey, you actually

245
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:16,029
can walk around.

246
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:16,830
You don't have to stand still.

247
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,251
It's not going to disappear if you move around.

248
00:13:20,155 --> 00:13:22,999
A big part of why that happens though is the limited field of view.

249
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:27,344
Something that the HoloLens has been criticized for and I know upcoming AR headsets kind of

250
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:28,265
have the same limitation.

251
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,611
The videos that are recorded have holograms present throughout the entire frame.

252
00:13:33,031 --> 00:13:37,016
In reality there's kind of a clipping window that's quite small and it makes it easy, especially

253
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:38,778
in the helicopter game, to lose track of things.

254
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:45,674
I use guidance arrows to point out where people should be looking, but I found that the simple

255
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:49,118
guidance arrow that most people are familiar with if they're gamers, which uses the shortest

256
00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:50,999
angle distance, is very confusing.

257
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:53,962
What happens is people look down sometimes if there's something behind them, and then

258
00:13:53,982 --> 00:13:57,205
they don't see that thing there, and they're like, well I don't know what's going on, and

259
00:13:57,225 --> 00:13:59,768
they totally ignore the guidance arrows and they get confused.

260
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:05,649
What I found works much more effectively is just simply limiting it to horizontal movement.

261
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:11,615
And then once something's within like a range of an angle sweep, then do an up and down guidance.

262
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:15,620
And also just adding that look text made a huge difference when I started demoing it to people.

263
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:20,569
And I think there's room to do things like seamless confusion detection,

264
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:21,789
which is something that I've kind of worked on.

265
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:23,649
I haven't gotten great results yet.

266
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:26,090
But the idea is knowing all the stuff that's going on in a game,

267
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,971
where the player's looking, whether they're looking around rapidly.

268
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:31,852
You can figure out whether someone's confused and perhaps offer guidance.

269
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:36,793
The problem is you can also incorporate verbal cues,

270
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:38,773
like if people will often verbalize their confusion.

271
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,762
The challenge of course is limiting false positives.

272
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,643
Many people might, you know, there's lots of times

273
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:45,164
when you might want to look away intentionally,

274
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:46,265
like say you're talking to somebody

275
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,745
and you don't want to start flashing indicators

276
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:48,186
in front of the user.

277
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:56,497
So far my ideas that I've kind of shown are not necessarily AR native, they're just adaptations of existing games.

278
00:14:57,118 --> 00:15:02,805
But one thing that came to mind is that you have a lot of information about where the player's head is at any given frame,

279
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:05,208
so why not use that as an input device?

280
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:09,433
So I came up with this little game concept that I think is closer to something that's really AR native.

281
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:14,337
It makes use of the environment interactions and that kind of room scale experience.

282
00:15:15,058 --> 00:15:16,799
And it's something that really can only be done in AR.

283
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,522
And people that have tried it have had a lot of fun.

284
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:20,923
It's a very kinetic experience.

285
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:24,506
And again, something that I think I'd like to revisit further if I had time.

286
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:28,229
Ergonomics.

287
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,631
An issue that came up in Doko desu ka?

288
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:33,253
The experience, like many, takes place on the floor.

289
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:36,421
and it's very uncomfortable to look at the floor for extended periods of time

290
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:39,424
unless you happen to be Gaston from Beauty and the Beast.

291
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:43,427
Most people don't have that kind of neck strength, so you want to think about that.

292
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,570
In Doco Descartes, the solution was proposed by a co-worker.

293
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,534
It's really simple. You just allow the map to be elevated and it works great.

294
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,477
Simple solution, but definitely something to keep in mind.

295
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:57,599
It's more comfortable to have your head looking up than it is down.

296
00:15:57,619 --> 00:15:57,679
Now,

297
00:16:01,663 --> 00:16:06,027
To really take advantage of augmented reality or mixed reality, I think you want to kind of get away from

298
00:16:07,688 --> 00:16:11,031
the design language of 2D screens. Unfortunately, I know I'm guilty of this myself.

299
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,713
A lot of applications have 2D floating menus.

300
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:18,217
But what's really a lot more effective than pasting something in front of someone's face

301
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:21,380
is to just make it incorporate your UI elements as part of the environment.

302
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,203
So for example, these buttons are 3D objects in the level itself.

303
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:28,005
Also, what you can do is map.

304
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:32,054
different kind of logical things that happen in the game

305
00:16:32,234 --> 00:16:34,215
to different spatial areas in the room.

306
00:16:34,756 --> 00:16:36,857
So in Doko Desu Ka, the original idea

307
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:38,638
was to have an instructor that stands off to the side.

308
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:39,758
I ended up with a blackboard,

309
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:41,660
but the idea is that you look away from the game

310
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,601
when you wanna learn or review vocabulary,

311
00:16:44,221 --> 00:16:45,682
and you kind of do that mental context switch.

312
00:16:45,742 --> 00:16:46,863
The game knows you're not looking at it,

313
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:48,644
and then when you're ready, you go back to the game.

314
00:16:48,664 --> 00:16:50,765
And I think that's kind of a very natural feeling,

315
00:16:50,805 --> 00:16:54,427
very intuitive way to leverage space in UX design.

316
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:58,717
So also a key differentiator between AR and VR, of course,

317
00:16:58,737 --> 00:17:01,079
that you can do this kind of like room scale stuff much more easily.

318
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,901
So in summary, what have I learned about making things fun?

319
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:08,143
I think what I've learned is that you want to keep a casual audience in mind.

320
00:17:08,423 --> 00:17:10,504
It'll be a while before these things become widely accessible.

321
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:13,606
You'll have a lot of, you know, non-hardcore gamers using it,

322
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:15,787
and you want to be attentive to their needs

323
00:17:16,627 --> 00:17:18,228
in kind of drawing them into these experiences.

324
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,883
You can adapt many existing game mechanics,

325
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:24,326
but I think the real payoff is in developing

326
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,749
AR-native content, stuff that can only work

327
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:27,750
on these platforms.

328
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:31,054
A big part of that is making use of the environment.

329
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:33,317
It adds that wow factor, and really,

330
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:34,999
that's what makes things really AR-native.

331
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:37,262
So there's a ton of opportunity to do creative things here.

332
00:17:38,822 --> 00:17:43,650
And just keep in mind that people enjoy creating and sharing things, and the ability to change

333
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,854
their reality feels magical to them.

334
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:49,080
And so you should really keep that in mind, I think, when designing games going forward

335
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,841
for this kind of medium.

336
00:17:51,522 --> 00:17:55,144
I think there's a lot to look forward to in coming years, obviously improved headsets,

337
00:17:55,725 --> 00:17:56,905
and also the AR cloud.

338
00:17:57,205 --> 00:18:01,708
So for those who don't know, this idea of having a digital soft copy, so to speak, of

339
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:06,430
the world, everything kind of mapped out and accessible to facilitate multi-user experiences,

340
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,271
you know, persistence.

341
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:11,593
And I think this will open up the door to what I would call like, you know, world-scale

342
00:18:12,013 --> 00:18:12,954
location-based gaming.

343
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,502
And I wanted to leave you guys with this little prototype that I made, a little demo,

344
00:18:17,982 --> 00:18:23,684
using a major motion picture franchise for the art of what I think gaming might look like in 2021.

345
00:18:23,884 --> 00:18:33,848
Agent Nicole, do you read me?

346
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:40,551
Copy that. I've got your video and sensors.

347
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:41,351
So this is the place?

348
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:41,491
Yes.

349
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:44,694
Doesn't look like much.

350
00:18:44,714 --> 00:18:46,974
I'll bet that's just the way they want it.

351
00:18:47,014 --> 00:18:48,634
All right, I'm going in.

352
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:53,635
I'm picking up signs of motion. Be careful.

353
00:18:53,695 --> 00:18:56,096
This doesn't look good.

354
00:19:15,802 --> 00:19:20,408
Get out of there.

355
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:25,776
Head for the exit.

356
00:19:39,598 --> 00:19:43,520
So is it actually arriving in 2021? Well, I think that depends on people in this room.

357
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,861
I hope that it becomes a reality and if you guys don't make it, I think maybe I will.

358
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:52,083
So that's pretty much it. I think we have 10 minutes now for questions.

359
00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:56,285
If anybody would like to ask any questions, feel free. Thank you.

360
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:13,683
Nicole Lizaro from Z Design.

361
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:18,247
I was curious, what do you think is the largest unsolved problem?

362
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:24,531
What would you like us to do next for creating good experiences for AR games?

363
00:20:25,032 --> 00:20:26,713
What is the largest unsolved problem?

364
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:27,814
I think that's a very good question.

365
00:20:28,715 --> 00:20:34,019
I think, gosh, there's a lot of stuff, but I think that if I had to pick one thing

366
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:38,102
that I certainly want to investigate going forward is the object recognition segmentation

367
00:20:38,122 --> 00:20:40,523
and making that much more easy to deal with.

368
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,295
I think that would really facilitate a lot.

369
00:20:44,236 --> 00:20:47,519
That and of course, just improvements in sensing

370
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:48,940
and so forth, but I think object recognition,

371
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,101
if I had to list one thing,

372
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:51,983
that I think could make things really magical.

373
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:53,844
So you know that it would be AI,

374
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:56,386
a difference between a coffee table and a couch,

375
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:58,248
because your character would do different things

376
00:20:58,308 --> 00:20:58,969
if it was on each side.

377
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:00,590
Exactly, yeah, being able to detect that quickly

378
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,993
and having a way of robustly categorizing

379
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,094
what the play space looks like,

380
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:07,696
I think would be just super amazing.

381
00:21:08,243 --> 00:21:12,007
I want to play a game where it knows that the best place to hide the body is in my fridge.

382
00:21:12,328 --> 00:21:13,710
Exactly, right, right, right.

383
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:14,951
Thank you.

384
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:17,414
Thank you.

385
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:23,642
For developers, what other tools are available for geolocated-based gaming other than the

386
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,205
new Google Maps feature and Mapbox?

387
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:30,311
In terms of geolocation, I'm actually not sure, unfortunately.

388
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:31,231
I wish I knew.

389
00:21:31,831 --> 00:21:33,892
I know that Google recently released that API.

390
00:21:35,173 --> 00:21:36,554
On the HoloLens right now, for example,

391
00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:39,375
there's no real built-in geolocation capability.

392
00:21:39,395 --> 00:21:40,175
There's no GPS.

393
00:21:40,756 --> 00:21:42,176
You'd have to do it through Wi-Fi or something.

394
00:21:43,277 --> 00:21:44,317
I really don't know, and that's, I think,

395
00:21:44,597 --> 00:21:47,379
an area that's being, I think there are lots of

396
00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:49,180
small startups working on things,

397
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,901
but unfortunately I don't have any understanding of that.

398
00:21:55,036 --> 00:21:57,461
When you were scanning the room for the game,

399
00:21:57,522 --> 00:22:00,649
what's the time frame for the calibration of the room

400
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:02,392
between scanning it and starting the game?

401
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:03,781
That's a really good question.

402
00:22:03,801 --> 00:22:05,222
The question was, you know, how long does it take

403
00:22:05,262 --> 00:22:07,223
from scanning the room to starting a game?

404
00:22:07,564 --> 00:22:09,745
And the room scan itself can take quite a while.

405
00:22:09,965 --> 00:22:12,306
I use the Spatial Understanding Library,

406
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:15,948
which post-processes the raw spatial mesh even further.

407
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,989
So it can take a bit of time,

408
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:20,251
depending on the play space to scan the space.

409
00:22:20,731 --> 00:22:21,651
So you're looking at like,

410
00:22:21,752 --> 00:22:23,032
you could spend like 30 seconds

411
00:22:23,072 --> 00:22:24,453
to a minute to two minutes scanning,

412
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:26,854
if you want like a, you know, the full area scanned.

413
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:28,475
And then on top of that,

414
00:22:28,495 --> 00:22:31,077
depending on how you implement your placement solver

415
00:22:31,137 --> 00:22:31,497
after that.

416
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,322
It can take anywhere from like 10 seconds in my room

417
00:22:35,382 --> 00:22:37,384
to place the objects to I've seen some places

418
00:22:37,404 --> 00:22:39,185
where it gets confused and it spends like almost a minute.

419
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:42,448
Now that's partly because I didn't use

420
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:43,929
the most efficient way of placing things

421
00:22:43,969 --> 00:22:45,350
and invoking the constraint solver.

422
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,071
That I think could be easily improved.

423
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,453
But you're definitely looking at sucking up

424
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,394
about a minute of time.

425
00:22:50,474 --> 00:22:53,656
And so in my game, once you've scanned a space,

426
00:22:54,036 --> 00:22:54,977
I make sure to retain that.

427
00:22:54,997 --> 00:22:56,098
So if you start a level over again,

428
00:22:56,118 --> 00:22:57,839
it asks you do you wanna just reuse the previous scan

429
00:22:57,859 --> 00:22:59,240
so you don't have to keep going through and doing it.

430
00:22:59,841 --> 00:23:00,461
It is slow though.

431
00:23:01,415 --> 00:23:04,235
How long before it's not exact real time,

432
00:23:04,255 --> 00:23:05,936
but near real time where you could like walk

433
00:23:05,996 --> 00:23:09,997
into the bedroom and delay you for a couple seconds

434
00:23:10,037 --> 00:23:11,177
or something and then kind of pop up there?

435
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:12,037
That's a great question.

436
00:23:12,237 --> 00:23:15,358
I think it's really just a year or two away.

437
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:18,219
So the AR cloud stuff that I mentioned,

438
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:19,039
that's kind of that idea.

439
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:21,159
The idea is that they'll be able to kind of crowdsource

440
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:23,340
scans and so when you walk into a place

441
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,240
that's already been scanned,

442
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,640
it recognizes that and loads the room data.

443
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:29,361
I'm not on one of these teams that develops the hardware,

444
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:30,981
but from what I've kind of heard leaked to me.

445
00:23:31,802 --> 00:23:35,684
It sounds to me like this problem will be alleviated a lot within the next year.

446
00:23:36,044 --> 00:23:39,065
So I think we're not very far off.

447
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,247
So certainly within two years when this stuff is more mainstream, I think you'll see the

448
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:44,047
scanning phase be done much more rapidly.

449
00:23:44,187 --> 00:23:44,368
Cool.

450
00:23:44,788 --> 00:23:45,188
Great talk.

451
00:23:45,228 --> 00:23:45,728
Thanks for sharing.

452
00:23:45,868 --> 00:23:46,168
Thank you.

453
00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:48,189
Thank you.

454
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:52,991
I noticed that in some of your examples, you used a game pad for controlling the...

455
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:55,979
the game and in some of them it was gestures.

456
00:23:56,499 --> 00:24:00,261
What do you think are the unique challenges

457
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:02,562
as far as control space between,

458
00:24:02,862 --> 00:24:04,743
like the differences between those?

459
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:05,504
That's a good question.

460
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:07,385
You know, challenges with regards to control.

461
00:24:07,505 --> 00:24:10,306
I think what I've noticed when people first use

462
00:24:10,326 --> 00:24:12,047
these devices is they start reaching out at stuff.

463
00:24:12,527 --> 00:24:14,988
So obviously having hand gestures is super, super important.

464
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:18,390
Now, the problem is though, I feel that once you get

465
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,091
beyond that initial stage, you always have to have that

466
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:21,692
to be intuitive.

467
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:25,408
I feel that beyond that though, hands are not very intuitive.

468
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:27,989
And in fact, if you think about what hands are used for,

469
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:29,429
they're used for manipulating tools,

470
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:31,589
not like pointing and waving at things.

471
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:33,970
And I think that people that are very zealous

472
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,310
about using only hand gestures are missing a key part

473
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,311
of the human anatomy and why we have hands.

474
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,871
The Xbox 360 controller, I think,

475
00:24:40,951 --> 00:24:42,372
is unfortunately not something Microsoft

476
00:24:42,412 --> 00:24:44,472
is gonna move forward with in terms of a control device,

477
00:24:44,512 --> 00:24:46,013
but I find it to be extremely useful.

478
00:24:46,273 --> 00:24:48,513
I personally prefer it to motion controller type controls.

479
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:50,554
I think a combination of something like that

480
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:52,174
and hand controls would be great.

481
00:24:53,855 --> 00:24:56,717
But if you really want fine, persistent control,

482
00:24:56,737 --> 00:24:58,458
when you're trying to design something, for example,

483
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:01,180
something like a controller actually works really well.

484
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,762
And I like the fact that it's one single thing,

485
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:06,483
so I can take one hand away and start waving around,

486
00:25:06,663 --> 00:25:08,505
potentially, and then return to my controller.

487
00:25:09,605 --> 00:25:11,567
So I think realistically, though,

488
00:25:11,587 --> 00:25:13,608
it's gonna be a combination of just intuitive hand controls

489
00:25:13,808 --> 00:25:15,869
as much as possible, picking up voice,

490
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,891
and then something like a motion controller.

491
00:25:17,911 --> 00:25:19,492
I think it seems to be where the industry's heading.

492
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:20,572
Thanks.

493
00:25:21,013 --> 00:25:21,253
Thank you.

494
00:25:24,043 --> 00:25:30,447
I had a question about redressing or reconfiguring the entire scan.

495
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:34,629
So it seems like you have a lot of depth information already.

496
00:25:34,649 --> 00:25:38,332
And for example, with the military game,

497
00:25:40,213 --> 00:25:44,395
how come you can't cover up the bed with, let's say,

498
00:25:44,855 --> 00:25:47,997
procedural texturing or?

499
00:25:50,052 --> 00:25:52,873
kit bed, like modeling, modular modeling

500
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:55,294
that could actually cover up the entire bed.

501
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:57,435
That's a really good question.

502
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,256
So he's asking about why not generate

503
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,778
more procedural geometry to kind of cover objects.

504
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:02,858
And you absolutely can.

505
00:26:03,699 --> 00:26:04,299
Two things though.

506
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,860
Number one, since I'm not an artist

507
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,860
and just working on my own,

508
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,401
it's been really hard to do stuff like that.

509
00:26:08,521 --> 00:26:10,983
But a bigger challenge on the HoloLens in particular

510
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:12,864
is that it's very fill rate limited.

511
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:16,806
So it's very hard to get things to run

512
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,326
at 60 frames per second, which is what you want.

513
00:26:18,807 --> 00:26:21,227
And if you were to generate a bunch of geometry

514
00:26:21,267 --> 00:26:22,088
over the spatial mesh.

515
00:26:22,368 --> 00:26:24,268
So in fact, what I actually do is I actually

516
00:26:24,568 --> 00:26:25,969
cull parts of the spatial mesh.

517
00:26:26,069 --> 00:26:28,229
I didn't show that slide, but I actually

518
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:30,370
remove parts of the spatial mesh that are not absolutely

519
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,470
necessary for occlusion.

520
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,831
I retain them for collision just to kind of lower

521
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:36,211
the fill rate requirements.

522
00:26:38,092 --> 00:26:39,932
You absolutely could with more powerful hardware.

523
00:26:40,192 --> 00:26:41,072
I think we're all looking forward

524
00:26:41,092 --> 00:26:42,313
to better GPUs on these things.

525
00:26:42,653 --> 00:26:43,973
And I think it's a fantastic idea.

526
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:45,814
One potential design issue, though,

527
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:48,034
is that when you try to render something

528
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:50,175
really big like that, that small FO,

529
00:26:50,215 --> 00:26:52,555
that field of view limitation can make it look kind of weird.

530
00:26:52,975 --> 00:26:53,976
Like, you know, you'll look at the bed

531
00:26:53,996 --> 00:26:55,656
and you'll see an area that has geometry,

532
00:26:55,676 --> 00:26:58,197
but then the bed is still the bed out here.

533
00:26:59,457 --> 00:27:01,837
So I guess that's kind of an artistic challenge.

534
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:07,441
To summarize that, one big issue with the HoloLens right now is the performance.

535
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:12,686
It's got a very weak GPU, but you could absolutely do that,

536
00:27:12,726 --> 00:27:18,070
and I think that's an area of further research that I think would be really fruitful to try.

537
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:20,990
Have you come across anybody that tried?

538
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:21,631
Not really.

539
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:24,532
The closest I've seen is just people kind of placing,

540
00:27:24,572 --> 00:27:27,914
I think, pre-made maps or maybe kind of procedurally generated

541
00:27:27,934 --> 00:27:30,075
but kind of flat maps on top of tables, things like that.

542
00:27:30,555 --> 00:27:33,476
I haven't seen something where you have a conformant scene,

543
00:27:33,496 --> 00:27:36,138
like where you have, say, something conforming to all sides

544
00:27:36,158 --> 00:27:38,419
of a bed, for example, or a coffee table.

545
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:41,280
I think it'd be really awesome and I would absolutely love to see it.

546
00:27:42,101 --> 00:27:42,821
Cool. Thank you.

547
00:27:45,943 --> 00:27:46,663
I guess that's it.

548
00:27:48,282 --> 00:27:50,964
I'll be hanging around for a little while probably outside feel free to you

549
00:27:50,984 --> 00:27:54,265
know if you see me any time during the expo to to stop and say hello.

550
00:27:54,285 --> 00:27:57,907
If if you're lucky I might have my whole ends on me some of the days

551
00:27:57,947 --> 00:28:01,409
here and thanks a lot for attending the talk and I hope you guys do some

552
00:28:01,449 --> 00:28:05,411
awesome stuff and I'd love to see more you know more air gaming in the

553
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:05,751
next year.
