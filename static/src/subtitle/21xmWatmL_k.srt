Hi, I'm Don Rawitsch and I invite you to attend my retrospective session on the history of the Oregon Trail Educational Computer Game.

2
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:16,263
Many of you probably first encountered Oregon Trail in school during the 1980s on a personal computer,

3
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:25,389
but we're going to start back a decade when I was one of three 21-year-old teachers who co-invented the game working on a mainframe and a teletype.

4
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,074
We'll take a deep dive into where the idea came from and how it was designed without

5
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:33,296
the benefit of graphics or sound.

6
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:38,280
So hitch up your wagons and join me on the adventure that launched educational computing's

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,061
best known game.

8
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:40,942
See you there!
