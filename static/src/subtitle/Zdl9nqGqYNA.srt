00:00:00,529 --> 00:00:14,439
On GDC Podcast Episode 8, we have Celia Hoden, a user experience consultant, psychology PhD, and author who will get us learned about cognitive science, UX, and how our brains process something as complex as a video game.

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,600
Back in a few.

3
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:39,870
And we're back. Hey, this is Chris Graft, editor-in-chief of Gamasutra, and I'm here with Alyssa.

4
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,612
Yeah, this is Alyssa, and I am already trying to interrupt you like a minute into this thing.

5
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:49,033
We're a little out of practice, huh? I think it's like we have to relearn every time.

6
00:00:49,053 --> 00:00:52,274
I don't, I haven't talked, well I have roommates, but I haven't like talked to people

7
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:55,475
as much as usual, so it's just a little, a little rusty.

8
00:00:55,675 --> 00:00:59,476
And your last name is Alyssa McAloon, not your last name is Alyssa McAloon.

9
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:04,389
Yeah, one of those is correct. One of those names might be the one that belongs there.

10
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,973
Yeah, the gears are just starting to spin in my head. Getting, you know, greased up and ready

11
00:01:11,013 --> 00:01:18,897
to go for this. So, yeah, Alyssa McAloon. Anything new happen since the last podcast?

12
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:23,019
Animal Crossing. It's just Animal Crossing. That's it.

13
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,660
How'd your GDC go?

14
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,241
Oh, GDC, yeah, that was Animal Crossing 2.

15
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:29,282
Oh man, oh geez.

16
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:34,584
I did watch some of the streams that were going all week on the GDC Twitch channel,

17
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:36,304
which were pretty interesting.

18
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:41,206
Popped in every now and then, but you can probably talk a little bit more about those than I can.

19
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,261
Oh, no, I don't know if I can.

20
00:01:44,783 --> 00:01:48,825
No, the virtual talks turned out really great, actually.

21
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:50,887
And there is something to be said

22
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:53,309
about hanging out in your living room,

23
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:56,691
absorbing content from the comfort of your own home.

24
00:01:58,032 --> 00:02:02,495
So we actually streamed the GDC awards, the Game Developers

25
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:07,419
Choice awards, through Twitch, as well as the IGF awards.

26
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,820
And it was a, you know, it.

27
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:18,688
it was a big effort on the part of people who are like our hosts and you know the GDC events team

28
00:02:19,728 --> 00:02:26,834
and it turned out it turned out really nice and just kind of it kind of made me feel it made me

29
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:32,639
feel good you know there's a lot of adversity right now it's tumultuous times right? Yeah yeah

30
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:37,663
no it was a I don't know it was difficult for them to bring together I imagine and it came

31
00:02:37,703 --> 00:02:38,624
together in this really like

32
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:44,316
heartwarming online way. I think being on Twitter and in the Twitch chat throughout

33
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:48,761
like the entire week and for the awards, it was like the most wholesome gathering of minds that

34
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:55,791
I've seen online in a long time, which is like, wow. It was shockingly wholesome for Twitch chat,

35
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:57,453
considering how many people were watching.

36
00:02:58,434 --> 00:03:01,516
So thanks for everyone who showed up for that.

37
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:06,819
And also there are a bunch of virtual talks that are on the GDC YouTube channel.

38
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:10,701
And they're up for free on the vault too, right?

39
00:03:11,522 --> 00:03:11,882
Yes.

40
00:03:12,142 --> 00:03:15,524
Yeah, the entire listing from that week is viewable.

41
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:16,465
Yeah, yeah.

42
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:18,126
And if they're not free now, they will be.

43
00:03:18,206 --> 00:03:19,707
I'm pretty sure they're all free right now.

44
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:22,969
It's a good number of them scrolling through them right now.

45
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:24,450
So there's a lot of content.

46
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,591
Content.

47
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:26,591
A lot of free content.

48
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:28,295
is my middle name.

49
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:30,196
Chris Content Graph.

50
00:03:32,217 --> 00:03:37,540
Uh, so yeah, other than that, you mentioned, uh, Animal Crossing. I think that we should just hit

51
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:42,803
on that real quick because I know that our listeners want to really listen, uh, listen to

52
00:03:42,863 --> 00:03:44,044
us talk about that.

53
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:49,247
30 minutes later. Um, no, Animal Crossing's real good and what was that? Sorry.

54
00:03:49,802 --> 00:03:55,665
You're like some kind of professional, like, uh, animal crossing player.

55
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:56,625
I go to your Island.

56
00:03:56,645 --> 00:04:00,187
You're like, you know, you're kind of like when you have rich friends or

57
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:01,788
friends who are like really well off.

58
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:04,629
And when your gates open for Island, I go there.

59
00:04:04,649 --> 00:04:07,751
You're like, the streets are, are paved with bells.

60
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:08,471
Yeah.

61
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:08,771
Yeah.

62
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:09,551
Yeah.

63
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:10,732
Like my real life.

64
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:11,112
That's me.

65
00:04:11,632 --> 00:04:12,694
It's well organized.

66
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:16,959
No, I had a lot of anxiety that can be channeled into organizing, and Animal Crossing is a

67
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:18,200
wonderful conduit for that.

68
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:24,447
I'm pretty sure we talked about the Gamasutra editorial team had at talking about all of

69
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:30,134
that over yesterday in a lead on gamasutra.com, so you can read that for my long-form opinions

70
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:31,255
where I talk too much about it.

71
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:34,216
No, I don't think you could ever talk too much about it.

72
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:35,077
You do.

73
00:04:35,117 --> 00:04:37,860
You have, you have very enthralling opinions.

74
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,325
You like live on a different, uh, tier of animal crossing-ness than I do.

75
00:04:44,006 --> 00:04:45,327
It's everything I aspire to be.

76
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:46,268
Thank you.

77
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:46,989
I think.

78
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:47,430
Yeah.

79
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:47,690
Okay.

80
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,090
Thank you.

81
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:48,911
Anytime.

82
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:49,532
Okay.

83
00:04:49,592 --> 00:04:53,496
So I think that we should, uh, get on with our, uh, with our guest.

84
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,540
Yeah, game development time.

85
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,120
I'm excited.

86
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,661
Hello.

87
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:57,381
Hello.

88
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:59,262
I don't know what you say.

89
00:04:59,422 --> 00:05:00,642
You folks are hilarious.

90
00:05:00,682 --> 00:05:04,024
I was muted most of the time to better sound.

91
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,744
But you're hilarious.

92
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:08,185
It feels like we're starting to relearn

93
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,346
how to interact with people.

94
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:10,406
Oh my god, how we do that?

95
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:11,447
We don't know anymore.

96
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:12,887
Yeah, I know.

97
00:05:13,027 --> 00:05:14,408
It's a totally new.

98
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:17,249
See, I haven't even introduced you properly yet.

99
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:20,050
I'm going to give you the warmest introduction here.

100
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,711
And now you have to listen to it unmuted.

101
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:23,491
Then you can react.

102
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:26,133
and correct me as I'm doing it.

103
00:05:26,153 --> 00:05:27,935
So, all right, here we go.

104
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:33,680
And if any of this is wrong, I blame your personal webpage.

105
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,180
Thank you.

106
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:39,265
All right, Celia Odent has worked on,

107
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:43,188
she has worked as a UX, okay.

108
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:45,310
Yay, that starts well.

109
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:50,134
Okay, our next guest has worked as a UX consultant

110
00:05:50,194 --> 00:05:52,516
in the game industry for over a decade.

111
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:53,985
No, that's false.

112
00:05:54,746 --> 00:05:55,346
Over, okay.

113
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:57,108
This is a bad start then.

114
00:05:57,128 --> 00:06:00,750
No, I've only been a consultant for the past two and a half years,

115
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,772
but before that, I was working in the studios directly.

116
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:04,573
Okay.

117
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:06,534
But it was close.

118
00:06:07,135 --> 00:06:08,115
Okay, this is good.

119
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:09,636
This is live editing.

120
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:11,518
All right.

121
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:13,359
Holds a PhD in psychology.

122
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:14,440
Yay, that's good.

123
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:14,900
Okay.

124
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,542
Has worked on Ubisoft franchises,

125
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:20,744
like Rainbow Six, Driver, Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs.

126
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:21,425
Mm-hmm.

127
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:25,897
Okay. LucasArts sadly canceled Star Wars 1313.

128
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:27,679
That was sad.

129
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:29,300
Yeah. Or is it 1313?

130
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,224
Maybe it was 131.3, who knows?

131
00:06:34,304 --> 00:06:38,287
The Kingdom Hearts approach.

132
00:06:38,828 --> 00:06:43,071
And also worked on a little game called Fortnite at Epic Games.

133
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:46,254
Yeah, I don't know if you've heard of it. It's a nice game.

134
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:47,375
It's a nice little app.

135
00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:48,456
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

136
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:51,654
And all right, there's more.

137
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:52,875
You're too accomplished.

138
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:56,536
Oh, stop.

139
00:06:56,676 --> 00:06:59,017
Prolific speaker, including multiple times at GDC,

140
00:06:59,077 --> 00:07:02,699

00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:03,499
Yes.

142
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:04,139
Yes.

143
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,500
That's a cool summit.

144
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,581
All right, we're almost through here.

145
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:11,502

148
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:17,245
Yes.

149
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,760
Is that all?

150
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:20,642
Is that the big stuff?

151
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:22,584
Yeah, I think that's good.

152
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:26,287
All right, everyone, help me welcome Celia Hoden.

153
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:27,147
Hey, Celia.

154
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:28,569
Hey, thanks for having me.

155
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:30,110
Yeah, of course.

156
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,031
We're super excited.

157
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,552
Should we call you Dr. Celia?

158
00:07:32,572 --> 00:07:34,934
No, you can if you want.

159
00:07:34,974 --> 00:07:36,635
If you have a tendency of yours.

160
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:38,136
How about just doc?

161
00:07:39,452 --> 00:07:40,793
Doc, yeah, doc, it's cool.

162
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,374
Okay, all right, doc.

163
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:44,035
So...

164
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:45,635
Only if I can say Greg Scott.

165
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:47,416
Okay.

166
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:48,937
That's a requirement, I think.

167
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:50,438
Yeah, we will allow it.

168
00:07:51,378 --> 00:07:55,921
So, first, we kind of went over your professional background,

169
00:07:55,961 --> 00:07:58,602
but like, what, how did you get into this?

170
00:07:59,823 --> 00:08:04,645
This is like, I'm excited to have you on because it's a unique thing.

171
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:08,233
It's not that unique but yeah, it's...

172
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:09,555
Ish.

173
00:08:09,675 --> 00:08:10,656
Yeah, unique-ish.

174
00:08:11,837 --> 00:08:13,899
Yeah, a lot of people ask me that question.

175
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,041
It's really funny because it really happened.

176
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:18,183
It just happened, serendipity.

177
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:26,610
So 12 years ago, I was working in the toy industry and doing educational games and stuff

178
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:26,911
like that.

179
00:08:27,937 --> 00:08:34,981
But I was a gamer, I've always been a gamer my whole life, like light gamer, like I play a lot of games, not just video games.

180
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:43,004
And so back then, I was already seeing a lot of parents freaking out about video games and...

181
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:48,868
fearing that it would turn their kids into dumb people.

182
00:08:48,948 --> 00:08:51,289
I don't know why, but it's been around for a while.

183
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:56,192
So back then I started to look into the science behind it and the psychology.

184
00:08:56,252 --> 00:08:59,794
Is there any research behind the impact of video games?

185
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:01,215
Back then I found some research,

186
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:06,078
mostly about the positive impact on cognitive skills,

187
00:09:07,418 --> 00:09:09,199
but also the worries around.

188
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,203
you know, violence and pathological gaming and stuff like that.

189
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:20,867
And so this is how I started to write articles about it back in France and to start going

190
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,548
into festivals.

191
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:27,651
There were a few festivals back in the day about video games and this is how I met with

192
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:28,152
Ubisoft.

193
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:29,873
And so it happened that way.

194
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:31,093
Got it that way.

195
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:36,451
How, why was that attractive to you or appealing to you?

196
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:40,156
It was, was it, you know, to validate your hobby or like?

197
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:42,761
It's just...

198
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:46,244
It was just the conver...

199
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:51,188
Everything was really converging

200
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,130
and all the things that I love.

201
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,271
So I love art.

202
00:09:56,312 --> 00:09:59,015
In a previous life I was a musician,

203
00:09:59,035 --> 00:09:59,915
I was playing music.

204
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:02,357
And so I love the fact that in video games

205
00:10:02,377 --> 00:10:05,080
there's a lot of artists and there's a lot of ways to be creative.

206
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:12,642
I love science. More specifically, psychology, science, but I love all science.

207
00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:18,645
And so there's that in my background. And I love playing games.

208
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:23,987
And so getting in the game industry was where everything is kind of converging.

209
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:30,249
So to me that was kind of, this is where, I don't know, where all the pieces came together.

210
00:10:30,349 --> 00:10:34,110
And I thought, yeah, this is, I guess, this is where I belong, I think, I hope.

211
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:43,257
Yeah, was Ubisoft just looking for, was it kind of a new area for them as far as getting

212
00:10:43,498 --> 00:10:46,040
you know, somebody with a psychology background?

213
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,061
Yes, it was, well that was back in 2008.

214
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,325
And that was new and there were a couple studios that were interested into that.

215
00:10:53,865 --> 00:11:02,030
Ubisoft was interested in enriching people's lives and back then they had some educational,

216
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,272
not really educational, but games that you want to enrich people's lives.

217
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:11,530
all the coach games, you know, my word coach or my SAT coach.

218
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:16,553
And so I was hired to help them understand how people learn

219
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:19,174
and to work on different projects.

220
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:22,636
I was on the think tank, the strategic innovation lab

221
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:24,797
as reporting to the CEO, Yves Guillemot.

222
00:11:25,642 --> 00:11:31,645
So I was working there, but I was also working with the Games for Everyone team,

223
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,427
and I was also working with the editorial team.

224
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:39,210
So I was right at HQ, so it was really cool for me to enter the game industry

225
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,011
at a place where I...

226
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:48,678
I could look at a lot of different relevant things in games and all the different topics

227
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:51,481
and things that people were doing in Ubisoft.

228
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:56,985
So yeah, they were interested in that aspect and I think they're still interested into

229
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:57,246
that.

230
00:11:57,526 --> 00:12:00,048
So yeah, to me it was great.

231
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:01,990
It was really serendipity.

232
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,233
I was at the right moment, at the right place.

233
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:08,035
And I was interested in it.

234
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:17,274
Yeah, we've been kind of dropping the term UX and saying user experience, but we can't

235
00:12:17,314 --> 00:12:22,236
assume that everybody who's listening understands what that is or what that means.

236
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:28,738
So can you explain what that is exactly and how it relates to games?

237
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:31,372
First of all, it's new in the game industry.

238
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:33,575
When I started at Ubisoft,

239
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:35,558
that was not a term that we were using.

240
00:12:35,618 --> 00:12:38,622
We started to use it maybe when I was at LucasArts,

241
00:12:38,642 --> 00:12:39,223
so more in 2012, 2011.

242
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:40,224
User experience is.

243
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:51,093
see it as a mindset. When we design things, and whether it is a video game or

244
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:58,435
an object or an aircraft, whatever it is, we can design it the way we find it the

245
00:12:58,535 --> 00:13:04,157
easiest for engineers or for designers, but we can also shift from that

246
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:07,959
perspective and try to adopt the perspective of the user who doesn't know

247
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,800
what's going on in the back-end, who doesn't necessarily...

248
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,063
know how the thing works and try to adopt that perspective so that we can design the

249
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:22,907
object, the system or the game taking into account the limitations of the human who's

250
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,628
going to use the thing.

251
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:33,013
So it started back in World War II when there were a lot of pilots that were super highly

252
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:36,034
trained who still made some mistakes because when you're...

253
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,817
and the war, you're stressed out, of course.

254
00:13:39,157 --> 00:13:41,980
And they were pressing a button instead of the other

255
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:47,826
because the dashboards in the aircraft

256
00:13:47,846 --> 00:13:50,649
were not consistent, one aircraft from the other.

257
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:54,913
And so you have to always relearn for each aircraft.

258
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:58,116
And of course that was making.

259
00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:05,582
human mistakes easier and so people would die or would crash planes and so this is where they really

260
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:10,465
People really start to shift from all right instead of designing the aircraft in the way

261
00:14:10,505 --> 00:14:12,547
It's it's going to be the easiest for the engineer

262
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:19,972
How about we design it in the way it's going to be easier for humans considering humans flaws because we are we are flawed

263
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:26,627
And so we can make it better for the military.

264
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:30,090
And then it spread from the military, started there.

265
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:36,377
And then it started to gain traction in product design,

266
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:39,100
in health care, and video games.

267
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,681
So video games is pretty new.

268
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,184
It's been less than 10 years.

269
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:49,112
but it's gaining traction here too and the idea is to ensure that you're gonna offer the experience

270
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:54,414
that you want to offer to your players by considering their perspective first.

271
00:14:54,434 --> 00:15:02,457
Yeah, and that whole idea of considering people's perspective is what seems that would make this

272
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:09,380
extremely difficult to figure out because people see things in in different ways, right?

273
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:14,945
Yeah, perception is subjective. We're all different, so we're all floating the same way,

274
00:15:15,826 --> 00:15:23,919
but our perception is different. There's a little game that I often do and I show a picture and I

275
00:15:23,979 --> 00:15:24,440
ask people...

276
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,141
What do you perceive in this picture?

277
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:31,003
And depending on where people are coming from, they see different things.

278
00:15:31,543 --> 00:15:36,945
And this is just to illustrate that our perception is subjective, and it really highly depends

279
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:44,407
on what we care about, our culture, it depends on the games that we play, the conventions

280
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:45,148
that we're used to.

281
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:52,754
And so even if you're a gamer, there's not one gamer, we have gamers and depending on

282
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:55,156
what type of game you're playing, you're going to be used.

283
00:15:58,017 --> 00:16:03,461
you know certain conventions, like if you play a lot of RPGs or playing a lot of FPS,

284
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:08,284
there are specific conventions that you don't find necessarily in puzzle games.

285
00:16:09,104 --> 00:16:16,049
And so it's really important to understand different perspectives and we cannot do that

286
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:21,452
by ourselves because we cannot, it's just something we can't do, adopt someone else's

287
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:22,873
perspective, we're very bad at that.

288
00:16:23,354 --> 00:16:25,655
So we need a methodology so we can...

289
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,578
So that's why we playtest, so that we can verify

290
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:34,541
that the game that you're designing

291
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:40,285
is going to be understood and perceived in the way you want it by the people

292
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:43,567
who are going to play it. And they might have a very different

293
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:47,070
perspective than you have. So that's the basic principle.

294
00:16:48,603 --> 00:16:53,529
Can you talk a little bit about basic methodology

295
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:55,971
for something like this or give an example?

296
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:57,273
Sure.

297
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:01,197
So first of all, it's very broad.

298
00:17:01,998 --> 00:17:04,501
When we talk about UX, a lot of people think UI.

299
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:12,711
Of course, UI is part of the experience and the icons that we're using and the menus and

300
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:14,672
organization and the HUD.

301
00:17:14,812 --> 00:17:19,274
Of course, that's going to be very impactful, but it's not just the UI.

302
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:20,315
It's everything.

303
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:23,897
Let's take an example of what we call affordance.

304
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:31,040
Affordance is when you see something, you see an object and you know how you're going

305
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,762
to be able to use it and that the object is designed to help you interact with it.

306
00:17:35,942 --> 00:17:39,584
So in product design, for example, if you think about, I have a mug just right in front

307
00:17:39,604 --> 00:17:39,804
of me.

308
00:17:40,504 --> 00:17:41,524
That mug has a handle.

309
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:47,586
That handle is an affordance for me to be able to just grab it with three or four fingers

310
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:48,126
and lift it.

311
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:53,988
That's helping me using that object without burning my fingers if there's something warm

312
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:54,208
in it.

313
00:17:55,329 --> 00:18:00,855
In video games, most of the time we don't manipulate physical objects, so the affordances

314
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:04,158
are what we call cognitive affordances or just signifiers.

315
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,904
But the idea is just by looking at something in the game, can I understand what it's for

316
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:11,426
and how I can use it?

317
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:16,671
So for example, if you look at the enemies in Mario,

318
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:20,034
let's say Bowser, everybody knows Bowser,

319
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:21,875
he has spikes on his back.

320
00:18:22,516 --> 00:18:24,858
That's telling you that if you're gonna jump on it,

321
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:27,660
it's probably gonna hurt you, so you should not do that.

322
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,263
This is a cognitive performance explaining to you

323
00:18:31,423 --> 00:18:33,625
how this enemy is working.

324
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:36,868
So we need to help out players

325
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:38,570
because we want the game to be,

326
00:18:40,391 --> 00:18:47,677
first of all fun and also easy to understand and to understand the rules of the world and

327
00:18:47,717 --> 00:18:50,640
what we need to do in an intuitive way.

328
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:56,204
It's through affordance that we can do that a lot because games we don't want to read

329
00:18:56,244 --> 00:18:58,686
a manual before playing a game, we just want to experiment it.

330
00:18:59,187 --> 00:19:04,170
And if we can understand this by looking at something, so it's character design, it's

331
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:08,693
environment design, and yes, it's the UI, but it's not just that.

332
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:13,617
Even the music, sound effect, all of that is going to be important because all of that

333
00:19:13,677 --> 00:19:17,580
is part of the experience and the idea is to ensure that we're going to give the experience

334
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,300
that we want to give.

335
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:23,764
So in video games, what's complicated is we are putting some challenges.

336
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:31,530
in front of players. Unlike other areas like military or product design, we don't want to

337
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:38,215
challenge people using something. But in games, we do want to challenge people in the games.

338
00:19:38,456 --> 00:19:43,339
So what's going to be really important is to start by defining what experience do you want to offer?

339
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,342
Where do you want to challenge players? Let's say, for example, Fortnite.

340
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:52,186
is a game where you're going to challenge players with their twitch skills and combat and building

341
00:19:52,206 --> 00:19:57,570
and coordinating with others. It's not a game where we want to challenge people into perception.

342
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,974
A game like Monument Valley is a game when you challenge people on their perception because you

343
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:08,397
play around with perspective. So it's really important to first define where you want to

344
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:13,401
put a challenge, what experience you want to offer and who are your users, who are the people going

345
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:16,663
to play your game. Because like I said, depending on what they're used to.

346
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:18,961
they might see things differently.

347
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:22,262
And so once you nail that, then you can start.

348
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,383
This is where the methodology starts.

349
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:28,464
And this is where you can try to anticipate problems

350
00:20:28,504 --> 00:20:30,444
that your appliers are gonna have,

351
00:20:30,684 --> 00:20:32,144
and you're gonna have to make trade-offs

352
00:20:32,825 --> 00:20:36,185
and make the right choices so you can offer

353
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:38,286
the experience that you wanna offer to your appliers.

354
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,986
Sorry, it's a bit broad, but it's...

355
00:20:40,026 --> 00:20:40,106
What?

356
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:48,937
sitting here intently listening. It's fascinating. Yeah, I can talk about that forever. So don't feel

357
00:20:48,977 --> 00:20:53,404
free to interrupt me. I'm jumping back into like my college shorthand when I'm taking notes. You're

358
00:20:53,424 --> 00:20:56,849
being like, oh yes, yes, this is like sitting in on a really interesting psychology course.

359
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,731
Yeah, the professor is in.

360
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,815
We're frantically taking notes here.

361
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:06,158
I'm like flashing back, it's weird, it's weird.

362
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:10,822
I did want to ask, so like, when you define your challenge or your users and stuff like

363
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:15,906
that, is there like moments throughout the process where you have to go back and reevaluate

364
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:19,669
after like having some hands-on like playtesting or like looking at how players are actually

365
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:24,013
reacting to your game and be like, okay, we need to change our definitions and adapt to

366
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:24,073
it?

367
00:21:24,937 --> 00:21:29,782
how players are receiving it or do you adapt, like how do you adapt to that on the fly with

368
00:21:29,862 --> 00:21:31,563
UX design or like UX anything?

369
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,725
Yeah, absolutely. So we use what we call design thinking, so it's an iteration cycle.

370
00:21:39,085 --> 00:21:44,068
So you design something, you test it, and depending on how people are using it,

371
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:48,551
is it validating or not, what you're trying to accomplish. If not, you go back to design,

372
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:52,994
and you iterate, and then you retest. So of course we're going to adjust a lot of stuff,

373
00:21:53,154 --> 00:21:59,538
but typically we don't tend to adjust what we thought the game should be about.

374
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:05,801
Because if your game is about combat and building and cooperation,

375
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:09,883
and you see that this is not what we're trying to accomplish,

376
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:12,624
it's rarer than we're going to say,

377
00:22:12,904 --> 00:22:15,585
oh yeah, it's bad that our game is bad at doing that,

378
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,186
but it's great at doing something else.

379
00:22:17,226 --> 00:22:19,787
Let's shift entirely and do that.

380
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:22,108
I mean, it's possible, why not?

381
00:22:22,148 --> 00:22:23,789
But it's typically not what we do,

382
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:26,370
because making games is very, extremely expensive.

383
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:35,915
So we do have a, we're focusing on accomplishing certain goals that are broad goals.

384
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:41,777
But then to get there, yes, we're going to iterate on systems, we're going to iterate

385
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:46,880
on the art, we're going to iterate on the UI, we're going to iterate on all these things

386
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,240
and maybe going to adjust.

387
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,201
We're making some assumptions.

388
00:22:50,942 --> 00:22:56,466
that might be wrong. And so we might have to remove, for example, a feature that we thought

389
00:22:56,546 --> 00:23:01,190
would reinforce such a strange feeling that we want to give, but at the end of the day,

390
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:06,835
this is not what's happening. It's actually removing more than adding anything. So yes,

391
00:23:06,995 --> 00:23:14,402
we adjust the features and systems, but typically we don't adjust the vision that we had for the

392
00:23:14,422 --> 00:23:16,463
game. At least not in my experience.

393
00:23:17,581 --> 00:23:24,827
In one of your GDC talks a few years back, you really focused on these concepts of perception,

394
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:30,571
memory, and attention, which was totally fascinating. We talked a little bit about

395
00:23:30,651 --> 00:23:37,356
perception, but can you talk about how why those three things are important to consider

396
00:23:37,597 --> 00:23:38,878
and how they relate to each other?

397
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:46,221
Absolutely. So when we talk about, I'm just gonna take one step back before, when we talk about UX,

398
00:23:46,261 --> 00:23:54,167
so we want to offer the experience we want to offer to our players, there are two main things that we need to look into to offer great user experience.

399
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:58,230
The first one is usability and the second one is what I call engageability.

400
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:02,253
Usability is making sure that the game can be used.

401
00:24:02,494 --> 00:24:07,257
People understand the objectives, they can manipulate all the things they need to manipulate, understand the systems.

402
00:24:07,717 --> 00:24:09,578
If there's crafting in your game,

403
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:12,900
players understand how to interact with the crafting system

404
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,721
and they are able to craft something.

405
00:24:15,282 --> 00:24:16,342
That's usability.

406
00:24:17,483 --> 00:24:18,704
A game can be usable,

407
00:24:19,044 --> 00:24:20,525
like meaning that people can understand

408
00:24:20,545 --> 00:24:22,125
what they have to do and manipulate

409
00:24:23,186 --> 00:24:24,267
all the features in a game,

410
00:24:25,107 --> 00:24:26,348
but it could still be boring.

411
00:24:26,868 --> 00:24:29,510
And so a game is more than just usability,

412
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,410
it needs to be engaging.

413
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:35,307
But back onto usability, to make a game usable,

414
00:24:35,587 --> 00:24:38,530
we need to take into account the limitations

415
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:39,731
of the human brain.

416
00:24:40,532 --> 00:24:42,373
So we look into mental processes,

417
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,996
and so this is where cognitive science kicks in,

418
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:49,059
because cognitive science is the study of mental processes.

419
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:53,082
And the main mental processes that we know well

420
00:24:53,282 --> 00:24:55,705
and that are really important to make a game usable

421
00:24:56,145 --> 00:24:57,926
are perception, attention, and memory.

422
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:01,837
So we look at the main limitations of these things.

423
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:04,980
The brain is performing for a lot of stuff.

424
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,683
We have great capabilities, but we also have great limitations.

425
00:25:09,723 --> 00:25:13,546
So the one we talked about, perception, is subjective.

426
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,288
And we have a hard time remembering that.

427
00:25:16,488 --> 00:25:18,509
Because for us, what we see, what we hear,

428
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:21,812
everybody should have the same perception of the reality.

429
00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:23,173
But it's not what happens.

430
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:25,714
There's one reality, and there's multiple perceptions.

431
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,517
This is why it's so hard to communicate sometimes.

432
00:25:29,598 --> 00:25:32,221
And then attention and memory are also very important.

433
00:25:32,462 --> 00:25:38,388
Memory is critical because if you learn something, it means that you memorized something new.

434
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:40,870
If you don't memorize it, you don't learn it.

435
00:25:41,531 --> 00:25:44,673
And so playing a video game is a learning experience.

436
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:46,974
There's a lot of things that your player is going to have to learn,

437
00:25:47,394 --> 00:25:50,195
from the controls, to the objective, to the story.

438
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:56,239
And so we need to understand how we can make sure that players are going to memorize

439
00:25:56,379 --> 00:25:58,340
the most important things in your game.

440
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,162
And the problem with memory is that memory is pretty flawed.

441
00:26:02,842 --> 00:26:04,063
I'm sure you've experienced that.

442
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:05,123
You forget about stuff.

443
00:26:05,143 --> 00:26:06,904
Not me. Perfect memory. Perfect memory.

444
00:26:11,881 --> 00:26:13,881
So we have to deal with that.

445
00:26:15,022 --> 00:26:18,444
And so memory is pretty flawed and we have what we call the forgetting curve.

446
00:26:18,904 --> 00:26:24,246
And even if you learn something by heart and that's, you know, let's say today you've learned

447
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:33,611
something entirely by heart, like a series of numbers or words, but then tomorrow maybe

448
00:26:33,651 --> 00:26:38,253
you're only going to remember half of them or even less than that if what you're trying to.

449
00:26:39,215 --> 00:26:40,279
learn was meaningless.

450
00:26:41,327 --> 00:26:45,248
And so we are forgetting stuff as time passes.

451
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:55,033
And that's really important for video games because a video game, we experience that across several days or weeks or hopefully months and years.

452
00:26:55,553 --> 00:26:59,375
And if you play every day, you're less likely to forget about stuff.

453
00:26:59,775 --> 00:27:04,397
But a lot of players, they're going to play a lot, let's say, a game that's complicated.

454
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:06,498
Let's take the example of Red Dead Redemption 2.

455
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,900
You play it, there's a lot of systems to learn and maybe you're going to play every day.

456
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,923
for a couple of weeks and then you go on vacation or you're going on crunch because we're making video games and we crunch.

457
00:27:17,323 --> 00:27:24,767
And so you leave the game for a week or two and when you come back, it feels like you're downgraded

458
00:27:24,787 --> 00:27:29,790
because now you don't remember how to do things and it's taking a long time to get back to it.

459
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,571
Oh, not to get hung up on this or interrupt through this,

460
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:34,772
but like, this is just so striking to me.

461
00:27:34,812 --> 00:27:38,654
Like I forget like where I slotted my fishing rod

462
00:27:38,674 --> 00:27:40,656
and my tool wheel in Animal Crossing.

463
00:27:40,756 --> 00:27:44,017
And I like, like minute to minute.

464
00:27:44,578 --> 00:27:46,219
And like, that's one of the things

465
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:50,201
that's frustrating to me too about RPGs, for example,

466
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:51,601
because you'll return to it.

467
00:27:51,682 --> 00:27:53,142
And there's like, for most of them,

468
00:27:53,202 --> 00:27:54,623
some of them are trying to do this now,

469
00:27:55,103 --> 00:27:57,205
but these are like epically long.

470
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:03,950
you know, stories and then, you know, I'm not playing every single day and then I'll come back and like months later and I

471
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,533
just give up because I was like, what the heck am I even doing?

472
00:28:06,573 --> 00:28:08,594
You might as well start all the way over again.

473
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:09,015
Yeah.

474
00:28:09,395 --> 00:28:14,840
So there was like a moment with what you were describing with kind of forgetting like small elements of something where like I

475
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,682
previously played a lot of Hitman 2. Now I only play some Hitman 2.

476
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,446
And I took a break from that game to play Horizon Zero Dawn. That was Hitman 1, I think.

477
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:25,869
and then I came back to it and I'm like all right I'm gonna go to this level I know really well and

478
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:29,392
I'm gonna go through this way and I go behind this butler and I gotta sneak and open the door

479
00:28:29,412 --> 00:28:34,616
and instead of hitting the open the door button I hit what in Horizon would be the action button

480
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:39,721
and I punched this butler directly in the face because like my memory of the buttons had been

481
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:43,624
overlapped with what I was playing at a different time and it just it went weird it all went bad.

482
00:28:45,445 --> 00:28:46,686
Yeah, that's a great example.

483
00:28:46,706 --> 00:28:51,090
And so as a gamer, we typically play a lot of different games,

484
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,972
and what you're describing is what we call muscle memory.

485
00:28:53,992 --> 00:28:57,255
So in psychology, we call that procedural memories,

486
00:28:57,295 --> 00:29:00,317
the memory of actions, which is a bit different from the memory

487
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:04,701
of facts and knowledge, such as what's

488
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:06,302
the storyline in that game.

489
00:29:06,442 --> 00:29:07,723
That's more facts and knowledge.

490
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:11,152
The buttons that you press is more procedure.

491
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:14,882
And these are two different, completely separate memories,

492
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:15,865
and they work differently.

493
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:18,232
muscle memory is very strong.

494
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,195
And so once you're trained on a game

495
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:24,479
and you have certain buttons laid out,

496
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,262
if you go back to another game, it's a nightmare

497
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:28,704
because you have to relearn.

498
00:29:28,744 --> 00:29:31,607
It's just like if you go from the U.S., you go to London,

499
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:35,531
and you have to look right before crossing,

500
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:36,632
and you're not used to that,

501
00:29:36,732 --> 00:29:38,394
and it's going to take you a while to get used to that.

502
00:29:39,115 --> 00:29:43,536
It's the same principle and there's a lot of games now that they care more about the

503
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:49,458
onboarding, they onboard players better, but not many games think about re-onboarding players

504
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,639
after they left the game for a little while.

505
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:56,160
And that can be okay if you're a paid up front game.

506
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,501
If you're a free to play game, that could mean that players when they get back to it,

507
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:06,423
they forgot about everything and they feel like it's going to be too hard to...

508
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:11,286
get bad at it and they might just quit and play another game.

509
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:18,070
So it's harsh. Yeah, like seriously, like I need a

510
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:24,834
like a re- you know, adjustment or like re-intro every time I turn a

511
00:30:24,854 --> 00:30:26,735
game on or something. I should probably get a brain scan.

512
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:31,518
No, I can assure you your brain is perfectly normal.

513
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:34,680
We all have this problem. Humans are just flawed.

514
00:30:36,187 --> 00:30:40,109
And then memory, so it's perception, how people see things,

515
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:44,272
and then memory, and then that goes into attention.

516
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:46,514
How does that go into UX?

517
00:30:46,854 --> 00:30:49,116
So these elements are not really separated.

518
00:30:49,176 --> 00:30:50,537
We talk about them separately.

519
00:30:51,658 --> 00:30:55,440
But memory is the process of encoding, retaining,

520
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,041
and then recalling information.

521
00:30:57,081 --> 00:30:57,902
So it's all of that.

522
00:30:58,282 --> 00:31:01,044
And to encode information, you need attention.

523
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:07,109
So if you don't pay attention to something, you're not gonna remember it well.

524
00:31:07,689 --> 00:31:09,910
So to pay attention to something, it also needs to stand out.

525
00:31:09,931 --> 00:31:10,611
I'm sorry, what was that?

526
00:31:11,351 --> 00:31:11,592
Which part?

527
00:31:11,612 --> 00:31:12,672
I'm just kidding.

528
00:31:13,053 --> 00:31:14,874
I was pretending like you lost my attention.

529
00:31:14,954 --> 00:31:15,554
Oh my god.

530
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:16,395
I'm sorry.

531
00:31:16,535 --> 00:31:17,095
That's terrible.

532
00:31:17,136 --> 00:31:17,636
Wow.

533
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:19,397
Worm, worm.

534
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:20,998
Good try, good try.

535
00:31:21,018 --> 00:31:22,639
Thank you.

536
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,861
It's difficult times, so we need to laugh.

537
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:26,422
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

538
00:31:26,642 --> 00:31:27,503
So now I lost my...

539
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:30,665
Memory!

540
00:31:30,965 --> 00:31:32,246
Remember me please!

541
00:31:34,547 --> 00:31:38,209
So yeah, you need, so first of all, to pay attention to something, sometimes you need

542
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:39,089
to perceive it.

543
00:31:39,449 --> 00:31:42,011
And so that's why we need stuff to stand out.

544
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:47,353
This is the reason why we have, you know, big flashes in games, or giant exclamation

545
00:31:47,393 --> 00:31:50,355
marks to draw attention, but through perception.

546
00:31:50,415 --> 00:31:54,117
So we draw attention, and once you pay attention to something, then you're going to process

547
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:54,957
things better.

548
00:31:55,377 --> 00:31:59,078
So the better you process something and the more,

549
00:32:00,078 --> 00:32:01,619
the deeper you process something,

550
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:03,299
the more likely you are to remember it.

551
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,001
So this is the reason why in most cases,

552
00:32:07,441 --> 00:32:09,462
learning by doing is more efficient

553
00:32:09,642 --> 00:32:12,363
than learning by reading instructions, for example.

554
00:32:13,022 --> 00:32:17,663
So during the onboarding phase, it's going to be way more efficient if you want people

555
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:24,544
to remember it, to put your players in a situation where they have to do something, they have

556
00:32:24,604 --> 00:32:27,705
to experience the thing you're trying to teach them.

557
00:32:28,025 --> 00:32:32,966
And this is the way we really put Fortnite together, the save the world part.

558
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:35,686
So the more the story, the more the part.

559
00:32:35,706 --> 00:32:37,507
For example, the first time you learn how to build.

560
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:43,898
The pliers are in a situation where they're in a cave and they need to exit the cave.

561
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,874
but there's nothing there to exit the cave.

562
00:32:46,954 --> 00:32:48,174
And this is where we teach them,

563
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:51,035
hey, if you want to exit, you need to build stairs.

564
00:32:51,716 --> 00:32:55,537
And so the idea is if you place players in a situation

565
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:57,438
where they have context,

566
00:32:57,478 --> 00:32:59,799
it means that they can do the things that you teach them,

567
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,599
there's learning by doing,

568
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,460
and on top of that, it's meaningful.

569
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,881
They care about it right now

570
00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:05,861
because they need to get out.

571
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:08,562
This is when people are more likely

572
00:33:08,602 --> 00:33:10,723
to pay attention to what they're doing.

573
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:15,662
and they're more motivated to do it and they're more likely to remember it later on.

574
00:33:16,422 --> 00:33:21,444
So that's the reason why perception, attention and memory all goes together and that's going

575
00:33:21,464 --> 00:33:28,086
to be really critical for your onboarding and for your game usability and the best,

576
00:33:28,246 --> 00:33:32,588
you know, the more you craft it carefully, the better it's going to be for your game

577
00:33:32,668 --> 00:33:34,109
and this is the reason why you have to.

578
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:45,956
determine what are the most important things in your game, what is the most important thing for the experience of the players, because you can't do that for every single feature in your game.

579
00:33:46,016 --> 00:33:49,759
You can't teach everything in your game through that, because otherwise you never ship.

580
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:57,384
And so you have to determine what are the most important things for your game, and also what are the most difficult things to learn.

581
00:33:57,404 --> 00:34:02,427
Like in Fortnite, building is quite difficult. It's new and there's not a lot of games.

582
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:09,737
We'll have buildings, I mean at least back then, and even it's different from building in Minecraft.

583
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:14,925
So we know that's already going to be a feature in the system, it's going to be hard for players to learn.

584
00:34:15,145 --> 00:34:17,048
So we need to pay more attention to that.

585
00:34:17,785 --> 00:34:26,828
system more specifically and maybe the rest, if it's not as crafted carefully, never mind

586
00:34:27,288 --> 00:34:29,709
because we can't do everything perfectly.

587
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:34,430
So if you do that, you determine what is the, this is what I call doing the onboarding plan,

588
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:39,112
defining what are the most important features in your game, things that if players don't

589
00:34:39,152 --> 00:34:41,333
understand how to do that, they're never going to have fun.

590
00:34:42,742 --> 00:34:45,282
And so you can place a lot of effort in that.

591
00:34:46,482 --> 00:34:52,343
And if you do that, then you are more likely to make sure that player is going to remember it.

592
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:58,465
The other trick is also, so that players don't forget, is to have better affordances.

593
00:34:58,605 --> 00:35:01,745
Also, give away information at all times.

594
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:03,566
That's why HUDs are so important.

595
00:35:03,606 --> 00:35:06,366
Because if on the HUD, like on Assassin's Creed, the first...

596
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:14,888
the first of the series, you always have on the HUD all the actions they can do in context.

597
00:35:15,268 --> 00:35:17,709
You don't have to learn about these.

598
00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:25,972
So even if you come back two weeks later, you're not under the forgetting curve because

599
00:35:26,032 --> 00:35:27,732
the information is still on your HUD.

600
00:35:28,052 --> 00:35:32,374
And that's why caring about your HUD and making sure you have the right information for players

601
00:35:33,114 --> 00:35:34,194
and that it's intuitive.

602
00:35:35,503 --> 00:35:37,964
It's a great thing because then when players come back,

603
00:35:38,525 --> 00:35:40,286
they can re-onboard more easily.

604
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:44,949
Alyssa, now that you have taken all these notes,

605
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,271
you've scribbled them all down,

606
00:35:48,452 --> 00:35:54,996
how do you grade the UX in Animal Crossing, the New Horizons?

607
00:35:55,016 --> 00:35:55,737
Scale of 1-10.

608
00:35:55,757 --> 00:35:56,477
Good luck, Alyssa.

609
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:06,086
I don't, for me it's difficult because it's hard to separate it from what I had as a kid

610
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:09,470
and like what's like baked into my mind from so long because like I there's just so much

611
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:13,754
that game that's automatic for me because earlier on I learned these systems and then

612
00:36:13,774 --> 00:36:17,138
carried that forward so like it's hard for me personally to kind of like grade that one.

613
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:24,545
But it's always hard and it's hard for everyone because we care about certain games more than others,

614
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:28,728
certain games have an extra-nostalgia.

615
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:36,195
And so this is the reason why it's really hard as game developers or gamers to grade and to rate any of these games.

616
00:36:36,335 --> 00:36:43,881
This is why we need a methodology so we can detach from our own perspective and use very precise methodology.

617
00:36:44,388 --> 00:36:46,370
to look at elements.

618
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:50,452
So that's why my framework is using the usability elements,

619
00:36:50,732 --> 00:36:52,733
like signs and feedback, are they clear?

620
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:55,035
Do we have good form follows function,

621
00:36:55,095 --> 00:36:56,635
meaning do we have good affordance?

622
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:01,718
Do we minimize the workload for players

623
00:37:01,758 --> 00:37:03,199
when they have to play for things

624
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,740
that they're gonna have to do very often?

625
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,021
So we look at very precise things

626
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:08,602
and same thing for engagement.

627
00:37:08,902 --> 00:37:10,263
Is it motivating?

628
00:37:11,264 --> 00:37:12,404
It's more complicated for engagement

629
00:37:12,424 --> 00:37:13,545
because we don't have a...

630
00:37:14,621 --> 00:37:22,845
enough research on that and it's more fuzzy. But we do have elements like motivation, emotion,

631
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:27,968
you know, game feel and we're looking to game flow and onboarding and all that.

632
00:37:28,148 --> 00:37:31,210
And so this is what we do. We don't... it's hard to...

633
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:38,873
evaluate a game just based on our feelings, even if we're professional.

634
00:37:38,993 --> 00:37:45,355
This is why I highly recommend to try to detach ourselves from our own gut feeling and common

635
00:37:45,415 --> 00:37:49,456
sense because common sense is flawed, because the brain is flawed.

636
00:37:49,676 --> 00:37:50,477
Especially mine, yeah.

637
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:54,331
Well, again, it's not just you.

638
00:37:54,492 --> 00:37:57,213
I can assure you that.

639
00:37:57,273 --> 00:37:58,915
I'm just putting out the self-deprecating stuff.

640
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:01,977
So validate me and yeah.

641
00:38:02,457 --> 00:38:06,700
So like, uh, when you're talking about getting other people's perspectives, I

642
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,382
mean, like you're, you're talking about, you know, different kinds of playtesting.

643
00:38:10,442 --> 00:38:10,663
Right.

644
00:38:11,503 --> 00:38:11,763
Yeah.

645
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:15,725
Yeah, there's a bunch of things that we can anticipate because we have principles that

646
00:38:15,745 --> 00:38:17,506
we use from human-computer interaction.

647
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:23,988
But yeah, we always need to playtest because at the end of the day, we can't anticipate

648
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:24,628
everything.

649
00:38:24,808 --> 00:38:29,110
We have blind spots and we need to playtest with a lot of different people.

650
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:33,612
That's why inclusion and diversity is very important so that we can ensure to uncover

651
00:38:33,692 --> 00:38:34,352
our blind spots.

652
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:41,254
And this is typically the moment, it's both exhilarating and atrocious because you bring

653
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:50,476
over players from your audience and you watch them play and sometimes the things you were

654
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:55,537
expecting to work are working and it's exhilarating and sometimes something that you thought would

655
00:38:55,557 --> 00:39:00,118
be obvious is actually not obvious to someone who doesn't know anything about the system

656
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:02,099
even though they're gamers.

657
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:06,101
And this is when it can be really depressing.

658
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:11,365
Because sometimes, like on Fortnite, there are some elements like,

659
00:39:11,425 --> 00:39:13,267
you know, playdesk after playdesk after playdesk,

660
00:39:13,287 --> 00:39:16,029
that we were iterating on something and it was still not working.

661
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:16,950
We're like, ah!

662
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:20,212
And that's why these rooms are soundproofed.

663
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:24,976
Because sometimes you're really like, why is this not working?

664
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,761
Like whenever I play something in front of a developer

665
00:39:29,062 --> 00:39:30,102
and they're watching me play,

666
00:39:30,362 --> 00:39:32,583
like I know, you know, if you're at a show or something,

667
00:39:33,043 --> 00:39:35,924
like I am super self-conscious too

668
00:39:35,944 --> 00:39:37,824
because I'm just thinking like,

669
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:40,585
I should know where to go and what to do.

670
00:39:41,066 --> 00:39:42,226
And I know that that's what they're thinking,

671
00:39:42,266 --> 00:39:43,166
like, what are you doing?

672
00:39:45,198 --> 00:39:49,759
But that's typically why we don't have developers in the rooms when we play test.

673
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:56,820
Because first of all it's intimidating and second of all you want to be nice to the developer

674
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:01,561
because you know that that person put their heart and soul and sweat and blood in there

675
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:08,323
and you try to figure out things way more carefully than if you were at home.

676
00:40:09,483 --> 00:40:15,328
especially or if you were on the commuting to work and trying a free-to-play game on your phone.

677
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:21,054
This is where really we don't care a lot about any of that thing and so we don't have a lot of time

678
00:40:21,154 --> 00:40:25,718
to ensure that players first of all they understand what they have to do and it's compelling.

679
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:28,279
And then you're, it's done.

680
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:28,339
So.

681
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:33,502
And there's, there's like an amazing amount of like these tiny little details.

682
00:40:33,522 --> 00:40:38,065
You were talking about menus and gestalt principle.

683
00:40:39,026 --> 00:40:39,946
Yeah.

684
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:44,169
And you know, which it, you know, it's about grouping things together.

685
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:44,369
Right.

686
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:44,909
And how your brain.

687
00:40:45,698 --> 00:40:49,501
Yeah, so it's more than that. It's about seeing patterns.

688
00:40:50,702 --> 00:40:53,065
And across all humans we have the same way

689
00:40:53,365 --> 00:40:57,549
of seeing patterns. But the problem is that we have different laws and

690
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:01,052
principles from Gestalt that can help us anticipate how people are

691
00:41:01,072 --> 00:41:03,794
going to see things. But the problem is that in real life

692
00:41:03,874 --> 00:41:06,697
there's all of these laws and principles that are interacting with

693
00:41:06,837 --> 00:41:10,280
one another. But when we take them separately we can clearly anticipate.

694
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,382
So for example if you just see a

695
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:16,351
a block of dots that are equidistant,

696
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,732
you're just going to see a big,

697
00:41:20,592 --> 00:41:21,973
I don't know, like square of dots.

698
00:41:22,553 --> 00:41:28,235
Now, if you remove the center column of these dots,

699
00:41:28,395 --> 00:41:31,016
then you're going to see two blocks of rectangles

700
00:41:32,516 --> 00:41:36,297
because we group things that are close to one another together.

701
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:39,358
So, that's one of the main principle of Geisha,

702
00:41:39,378 --> 00:41:40,858
we call that the law of proximity.

703
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,726
Yeah, and the way that you were applying it was fascinating.

704
00:41:44,746 --> 00:41:48,708
And it had to do with, I think it was a menu in Far Cry

705
00:41:48,768 --> 00:41:53,349
that you used to level up skills and stuff.

706
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,050
And sometimes those things,

707
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:57,711
like I know that's difficult to design at all.

708
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:00,553
But the way that you're explaining it's like,

709
00:42:00,613 --> 00:42:02,875
see how these are close together.

710
00:42:02,935 --> 00:42:04,756
This looks like it's vertical and it's

711
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,558
actually a horizontal progression system.

712
00:42:07,678 --> 00:42:08,599
Yeah.

713
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,600
That and that, I don't know.

714
00:42:10,921 --> 00:42:11,281
Yeah.

715
00:42:11,461 --> 00:42:12,782
It just seems mind-bending to me.

716
00:42:12,802 --> 00:42:15,824
I know. For us, it seems so obvious.

717
00:42:16,385 --> 00:42:18,286
Sometimes we just do things and we're like,

718
00:42:18,346 --> 00:42:20,128
oh, we're going to iterate on that later,

719
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,769
and that later never happens.

720
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,151
That's the reason why we need to anticipate

721
00:42:24,451 --> 00:42:26,513
things and need to use these principles.

722
00:42:27,613 --> 00:42:32,496
to design so that from the beginning it's at least it's following some principles

723
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,077
because we're going to have to iterate anyway.

724
00:42:34,978 --> 00:42:37,960
But there's some principles we can easily apply but we just forget.

725
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,804
And there's a lot of things that are shipped that are violating these basic principles just because

726
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:47,806
to us it's so obvious because we know that the system is working horizontally

727
00:42:48,306 --> 00:42:51,689
and so it's again, the perception is flawed.

728
00:42:51,889 --> 00:42:55,871
So that knowledge is changing the way we perceive the system.

729
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,182
We're kind of running short on time.

730
00:42:58,202 --> 00:42:59,202
Oh, god, already?

731
00:42:59,222 --> 00:43:01,784
I feel like I could keep on going forever.

732
00:43:01,864 --> 00:43:03,405
But we still have time for a few things.

733
00:43:03,705 --> 00:43:05,046
Yeah, I'm going to cut in here.

734
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:05,887
Yeah, go ahead.

735
00:43:06,227 --> 00:43:10,450
I was going to ask, obviously, having a UX researcher or UX

736
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:13,112
designer on your team has a huge payoff,

737
00:43:13,212 --> 00:43:15,434
as the last 40 minutes of conversation can attest.

738
00:43:15,554 --> 00:43:19,557
But what concepts from considering

739
00:43:19,657 --> 00:43:22,339
UX should developers in other disciplines

740
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:24,560
keep in mind to their day-to-day if they don't have someone

741
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,281
like that on their team?

742
00:43:25,994 --> 00:43:29,517
Yeah, well that's basically the information I want to give away in my book.

743
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:31,538
So this is where I summarized everything.

744
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:34,261
What's really important is to have the correct mindset.

745
00:43:34,961 --> 00:43:40,366
And always think about players first and place them at the center of whatever you're doing.

746
00:43:41,087 --> 00:43:46,568
So of course if you can't play this it's going to be difficult because you do need to have that check

747
00:43:47,088 --> 00:43:49,229
because there are many things you can't anticipate.

748
00:43:49,889 --> 00:43:54,110
But at least if you have a better understanding of how the brain works,

749
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:58,411
the main flaws in terms of perception, attention, memory,

750
00:43:58,551 --> 00:44:02,152
and if you understand better how motivation works,

751
00:44:02,592 --> 00:44:05,333
what's going to be important to make it engaging for players,

752
00:44:05,653 --> 00:44:08,394
so things like motivation, emotion, and game flow.

753
00:44:08,974 --> 00:44:10,334
This is just like the...

754
00:44:11,356 --> 00:44:16,140
The basic information that at least if you have that is going to change a bit your mindset

755
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:22,265
and it's going to help you anticipate problems and iterate and find solutions faster.

756
00:44:23,506 --> 00:44:26,348
But of course it's never going to replace a UX designer.

757
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:31,673
These people are really specialized into interaction design and information architecture

758
00:44:32,213 --> 00:44:33,775
so they can help you define systems.

759
00:44:34,295 --> 00:44:38,859
So that's going to be really critical if you have a game with a lot of systems and a heavy UI.

760
00:44:39,951 --> 00:44:46,137
and play testing is always going to be important to help you out. So if you can't play test,

761
00:44:47,198 --> 00:44:53,785
there's a lot of people who can offer these services. I assure you it is worth it.

762
00:44:54,906 --> 00:44:56,608
So I know it's hard to

763
00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:02,631
to invest money in there, but it's a new investment that you will not regret.

764
00:45:03,592 --> 00:45:08,954
But the basic information is on my website, because I know the book is quite extensive.

765
00:45:09,294 --> 00:45:14,717
But this is really the information you need to understand so that you can start shifting

766
00:45:14,737 --> 00:45:20,080
your mindset from, I'm going to design what I want to do, to I want to offer that experience

767
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,882
to that sort of players, and I want to make sure this is really what I'm achieving.

768
00:45:24,542 --> 00:45:27,543
Having that mindset is really key.

769
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:33,396
So like speaking of consulting on these games, can you, I'm interested in hearing

770
00:45:33,416 --> 00:45:33,456
uh

771
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:41,908
What you know, are there what are the common mistakes or if there are or is it just like everything? Uh, you know

772
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:43,170
all the things

773
00:45:44,192 --> 00:45:44,272
um

774
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:50,317
Well, the common mistakes, yeah, it's often times the same thing.

775
00:45:50,517 --> 00:45:57,304
We have that hope that things are going to be okay and I mean it really depends on the games.

776
00:45:58,345 --> 00:46:05,012
But when I work with AAA studios and they are making a game for hardcore gamers,

777
00:46:05,673 --> 00:46:06,514
the typical...

778
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:14,381
caveat here is they always hope that, oh, because it's hardcore gamers, they will understand it.

779
00:46:15,141 --> 00:46:20,064
But this is not true. And hardcore gamers, it's not only your game coming out,

780
00:46:20,384 --> 00:46:26,327
or there's a lot of games that come out, and they're not going to blame it on their skills

781
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:31,850
if they don't understand something, and as well they should. They're just going to say,

782
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:35,391
well, I don't get it, or if they die and they don't understand why.

783
00:46:36,522 --> 00:46:38,783
depending on how motivated they are to play your game,

784
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:42,005
they might not try to figure out your game.

785
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,506
And you can't count on that.

786
00:46:44,006 --> 00:46:46,968
It's really rare that the game has so much hype

787
00:46:47,989 --> 00:46:49,730
that even if it's confusing,

788
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:52,512
players are gonna really work around it

789
00:46:52,632 --> 00:46:55,033
and try to be motivated to figure it out.

790
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:58,235
Or if they do, it's just a very small proportion

791
00:46:58,475 --> 00:46:59,856
of your audience.

792
00:47:00,876 --> 00:47:02,698
So that's one of the main...

793
00:47:04,709 --> 00:47:12,396
flaw that I see from players, from studios that are developing a Harker, a game for Harker gamers.

794
00:47:12,837 --> 00:47:17,781
Yeah, that's interesting too because the way that you, you know, are taking into consideration there

795
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:22,886
are other games that are coming out that, you know, but do you say that because it could like,

796
00:47:23,947 --> 00:47:28,190
you know, they're understanding how one game works that's kind of similar and then...

797
00:47:29,044 --> 00:47:31,845
The UX doesn't apply crossways or?

798
00:47:32,505 --> 00:47:33,226
It's not just that.

799
00:47:33,466 --> 00:47:34,826
So you need to be motivated.

800
00:47:35,026 --> 00:47:38,267
And so for motivation, there's three principles

801
00:47:38,527 --> 00:47:39,608
for intrinsic motivation.

802
00:47:39,628 --> 00:47:41,428
So the motivation of playing your game just

803
00:47:41,989 --> 00:47:44,770
for the pleasure of playing it, not because other people are

804
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:46,650
playing it so you want to be part of their gig.

805
00:47:48,072 --> 00:47:51,395
But it's about competence, autonomy and relatedness.

806
00:47:52,376 --> 00:47:55,900
Competence is about feeling in control and feeling that you're progressing in the game.

807
00:47:56,321 --> 00:48:02,207
If the game is not making players feel competent in playing the game, they're going to quit.

808
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:11,064
And competence is not... I'm not saying that the game should... you should never lose and everything is always great.

809
00:48:11,604 --> 00:48:20,351
You do need challenge. But competence is about if I die, I understand why I died and next time I can come back to it and get better at it.

810
00:48:20,691 --> 00:48:27,756
And this is not happening because the signs and feedback in the game are not clear, because you don't have that good affordances.

811
00:48:28,997 --> 00:48:33,281
Players are just gonna quit. And especially because there are other games out there.

812
00:48:34,982 --> 00:48:37,704
So that's the thing we need to focus on.

813
00:48:37,764 --> 00:48:41,307
It's really important to make sure, this is what the onboarding is all about,

814
00:48:41,387 --> 00:48:44,330
is make sure players are going to feel competent into playing the game

815
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,311
and they feel they can get better and progress.

816
00:48:46,792 --> 00:48:51,175
If they don't feel that, this is when trouble starts.

817
00:48:52,178 --> 00:48:58,303
When you're describing that stuff, I'm thinking of like, you know, these really difficult,

818
00:48:58,343 --> 00:49:06,171
like, Souls-like games that they're popular, they're really popular, you know, especially

819
00:49:06,211 --> 00:49:08,313
considering how difficult they are.

820
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:13,898
It's kind of like, they're popular because you know that you're the one who messed up.

821
00:49:16,348 --> 00:49:19,250
Yeah, but the Souls game, I mean, it's in the contract.

822
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:24,255
You know that you're getting in to suffer and this is typically the type of players

823
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,676
that they're targeting.

824
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:27,798
And so this is usually what I...

825
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:31,802
It's funny because typically Souls games are the ones that come up saying, oh, you know,

826
00:49:31,822 --> 00:49:35,866
with UX, every game is going to be easy and we can lose Souls games, like, ah.

827
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:42,993
And no, if the experience of the game you want to offer is one for people who like to suffer,

828
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:46,157
we're absolutely going to help you accomplish your sadistic goals.

829
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:51,262
But you have to know that your audience is going to be much smaller.

830
00:49:51,282 --> 00:49:57,629
And so to make it work, everything else has to be really well done in terms of UX.

831
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,292
Everything is UX.

832
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,294
Exactly. Everything in life is UX.

833
00:50:03,736 --> 00:50:06,739
Do you have a difficult time turning your UX brain off?

834
00:50:06,939 --> 00:50:08,220
You're just looking at stuff and you're like,

835
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,523
oh, every time you go up to a door

836
00:50:10,863 --> 00:50:12,124
and then it looks like you push it,

837
00:50:12,164 --> 00:50:13,426
but it's an actual pull, you're like...

838
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:18,329
I can't tell you how many times I get mad at things around me, like everything.

839
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:21,992
I'm like, oh, do they expect me to remember that shit?

840
00:50:22,112 --> 00:50:27,036
Or if I see something like elevators or every time I go to a new place.

841
00:50:27,056 --> 00:50:32,160
Well, sometimes it's fun because when I go to a new country, I try to see, can I operate this machine?

842
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:35,802
Can I figure out how to buy a metro ticket?

843
00:50:36,823 --> 00:50:37,604
Oh, yeah, I know.

844
00:50:37,764 --> 00:50:40,406
Oh, yeah. I've gotten lost in a fair share of foreign subways.

845
00:50:43,988 --> 00:50:46,390
But it's fun, it's interesting.

846
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:54,515
But there's also, just to finish about the idea of difficulty, it's also really important

847
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:58,497
to make your game inclusive, which means also it has to be accessible.

848
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:00,959
And it's not because you define it.

849
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,801
Difficulty is really arbitrary.

850
00:51:03,881 --> 00:51:05,843
It depends on how the designers, they

851
00:51:06,143 --> 00:51:09,026
want the game to be difficult. But I

852
00:51:09,046 --> 00:51:12,969
don't see why you should make your game not accessible

853
00:51:13,489 --> 00:51:16,311
to a lot of people just because you can't have

854
00:51:16,371 --> 00:51:19,854
many different options that can alleviate barriers

855
00:51:20,235 --> 00:51:21,055
to enjoy your game.

856
00:51:21,115 --> 00:51:22,316
So that's really important.

857
00:51:22,717 --> 00:51:24,598
And there's a lot of debate around that.

858
00:51:24,678 --> 00:51:27,020
And I really, I just really don't understand

859
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,221
why are we still having the debate today?

860
00:51:29,261 --> 00:51:31,983
Yeah, yeah, I have a difficult time understanding it too.

861
00:51:32,023 --> 00:51:33,084
You just brought up another topic

862
00:51:33,124 --> 00:51:34,945
we could talk another hour about.

863
00:51:34,965 --> 00:51:35,286
I'm sorry.

864
00:51:35,306 --> 00:51:36,447
Oh yeah, I forgot about accessibility.

865
00:51:36,787 --> 00:51:39,589
No, yeah, we didn't need to wrap it up,

866
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:44,292
but let's talk a little bit more about your book.

867
00:51:44,432 --> 00:51:45,773
Gamer's Brain is already out.

868
00:51:45,993 --> 00:51:49,056
Like it's, you know, people are reading it.

869
00:51:49,076 --> 00:51:50,417
You have another one that you said

870
00:51:50,457 --> 00:51:51,798
you just finished up recently.

871
00:51:52,018 --> 00:51:55,639
Yeah, so the new book is called The Psychology of Video Games.

872
00:51:55,719 --> 00:51:57,259
It's really more for a broad audience.

873
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,121
And it's about explaining how video games are made

874
00:52:01,441 --> 00:52:03,181
and what is the impact of video games.

875
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:05,662
So it's the psychology of making games, also

876
00:52:05,702 --> 00:52:07,142
the psychology of playing games.

877
00:52:07,883 --> 00:52:11,004
And the idea is to go through, so first of all, UX,

878
00:52:11,024 --> 00:52:13,604
so where is it coming from, and how psychology

879
00:52:13,745 --> 00:52:16,145
is used to make games, because you have a lot of people.

880
00:52:17,106 --> 00:52:20,391
and the public they don't understand and they feel,

881
00:52:20,511 --> 00:52:21,553
oh, they have psychologists,

882
00:52:21,573 --> 00:52:24,577
they must be trying to manipulate my brain.

883
00:52:24,597 --> 00:52:26,420
And so there's a lot of fear around that.

884
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,264
So I really wanted to explain what this is all about.

885
00:52:30,085 --> 00:52:32,068
And then also explaining a bit better the.

886
00:52:32,926 --> 00:52:38,347
the research around the impact of video games because there's also a lot of great claims

887
00:52:38,387 --> 00:52:38,947
around that.

888
00:52:39,487 --> 00:52:42,848
So you have one side saying, oh, video games are going to save the world and they make

889
00:52:42,928 --> 00:52:43,568
everything better.

890
00:52:44,908 --> 00:52:48,909
Most of the time, these are great claims that are not necessarily backed up by science.

891
00:52:49,489 --> 00:52:55,070
And on the other side, you have, oh my God, video games are killing everybody and everything

892
00:52:55,150 --> 00:53:00,351
is dark and everybody is getting violent and hooked up in games.

893
00:53:00,651 --> 00:53:01,611
And this also...

894
00:53:02,191 --> 00:53:04,733
our great claims are not backed up by science.

895
00:53:04,873 --> 00:53:07,015
So the idea was to look into these things,

896
00:53:07,055 --> 00:53:08,836
look into the positive impact of games.

897
00:53:09,537 --> 00:53:10,858
When is this happening?

898
00:53:10,918 --> 00:53:14,981
What conditions and what can be the negative impact of games?

899
00:53:15,562 --> 00:53:19,205
It's mainly regarding if you're over-consuming games,

900
00:53:19,265 --> 00:53:21,186
of course, that can lead to problems.

901
00:53:22,427 --> 00:53:26,230
But the main issues that we talk about video games as if it was

902
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,973
a big bucket of the same thing.

903
00:53:30,193 --> 00:53:37,639
And we need to stop talking about the great or bad impact of games and start to talk about more specifically

904
00:53:38,419 --> 00:53:47,066
what is bringing something interesting in terms of health or education or cognitive skills

905
00:53:47,406 --> 00:53:50,688
and what are the limitations that we need to be careful about.

906
00:53:50,868 --> 00:53:58,494
And it's mostly about mechanics and it's mostly about specific things and not just video games as a broad.

907
00:53:59,597 --> 00:54:03,201
topics. So this is what I was trying to accomplish in this book and I also

908
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:08,828
finish by talking about ethics and what we need to look into because the game

909
00:54:08,848 --> 00:54:15,036
industry also need to talk about ethics a bit more I think. How do you mean ethics?

910
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:24,680
So thinking, making sure that we are aware that there's no design is neutral.

911
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:29,762
So everything we design is going to influence people to use the design in a way or another.

912
00:54:30,402 --> 00:54:36,684
So when we design games to encourage people to come back.

913
00:54:37,845 --> 00:54:42,976
It's a fair game, especially for free-to-play, we need to have that to make money, so I totally

914
00:54:42,996 --> 00:54:43,417
understand.

915
00:54:43,497 --> 00:54:48,427
But sometimes, for example, we design games that punish disengagement.

916
00:54:49,385 --> 00:54:54,949
And this is where it can be a little bit unethical because then it's not that you're encouraging

917
00:54:54,989 --> 00:54:59,392
people to come back and they're going to be rewarded if they come back, you're going to

918
00:54:59,432 --> 00:55:03,275
be punished if you're not coming back, which is a little bit different.

919
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:08,099
And I think it's important for the game industry to look into these mechanics and define where

920
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:09,340
we should draw the line.

921
00:55:10,581 --> 00:55:18,387
before, because it's already, you know, policymakers and the public is talking about these things,

922
00:55:18,568 --> 00:55:24,473
whether it is loot boxes or retention mechanics, and we need to own that discussion, and we

923
00:55:24,513 --> 00:55:31,279
need to start looking into where's the line, and so that we can address the issue, because

924
00:55:31,299 --> 00:55:34,402
there are some issues, and we should not shy away from addressing them.

925
00:55:35,102 --> 00:55:37,004
And when is the new book coming out?

926
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,283
Ah, it's gonna be in October, so it's not anytime soon, I'm sorry.

927
00:55:41,303 --> 00:55:42,324
That's alright.

928
00:55:42,744 --> 00:55:44,546
But it will be available on newsstands everywhere.

929
00:55:44,566 --> 00:55:46,588
I hope so, yes!

930
00:55:47,709 --> 00:55:52,274
Yeah, if we still have, well, yeah, in October, hopefully, we're gonna be able to be out.

931
00:55:53,074 --> 00:55:55,997
Yeah, it's frustrating, but it is the way it is.

932
00:55:56,257 --> 00:55:58,299
That's a whole nother thing.

933
00:55:58,319 --> 00:55:58,399
Yeah!

934
00:55:59,394 --> 00:56:00,955
But we're all in there together.

935
00:56:02,016 --> 00:56:02,676
Yeah, we are.

936
00:56:03,197 --> 00:56:05,378
And well, thanks so much for joining us.

937
00:56:05,399 --> 00:56:07,160
This was absolutely fascinating.

938
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,222
I'm glad you find that fascinating.

939
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:11,203
As you can see, I can talk about it forever.

940
00:56:11,564 --> 00:56:14,026
Yeah, well, we need to have you on again sometime.

941
00:56:14,046 --> 00:56:15,787
Anytime!

942
00:56:17,288 --> 00:56:19,070
Alright, well, thanks, Doc.

943
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:22,693
And since I have permission to comment...

944
00:56:23,654 --> 00:56:24,814
Thanks, Chris and Lisa.

945
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,997
Yeah, and take care and stay safe.

946
00:56:28,294 --> 00:56:30,555
Yeah, everybody stay safe please.

947
00:56:48,859 --> 00:56:51,039
And just like that, Celia was gone.

948
00:56:54,647 --> 00:56:58,490
Is that how, I guess that's how we'll start the third bit like that?

949
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,452
No, she was, she was excellent.

950
00:57:00,952 --> 00:57:08,039
Uh, like I, uh, I'm still absorbing, uh, all of the information and my

951
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:10,180
practical and applicable information.

952
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,301
It's the best kind.

953
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:16,553
Yeah, that's been the nice thing about our GDC podcast guests so far is they can just talk

954
00:57:16,593 --> 00:57:19,614
about their subject matter forever. And it is incredible to listen to.

955
00:57:19,654 --> 00:57:22,676
Yeah, I know. We like don't have to do anything.

956
00:57:22,696 --> 00:57:27,238
Oh my god, just mm hmm. Every now and then and just podcast podcast itself.

957
00:57:28,098 --> 00:57:29,079
Podcast podcast.

958
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:32,480
Podcast. No tongue twisting. Okay.

959
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,001
Yeah. This segment's gone really well.

960
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:43,036
Yep, back on track. I was looking forward to this one in particular, this conversation in particular,

961
00:57:43,257 --> 00:57:48,501
because getting into more of like the behind the scenes writing about like the game industry and

962
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:53,244
stuff like that, UX was one of those like early question marks, you know, where like, I'm like,

963
00:57:53,264 --> 00:57:56,807
yeah, I know what game design is, I know how programming and art like they just do the typing

964
00:57:56,827 --> 00:58:00,690
and the drawing and then like, but UX is this like mystery one where I'm like, I don't actually know

965
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:01,071
what that is.

966
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:07,375
So like getting to kind of validate everything I've learned about that over the years of

967
00:58:08,256 --> 00:58:11,978
picking things up here and there and just hearing an expert talk about it was a really enlightening

968
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:16,962
way of like all the ways it touches the different aspects of game design and how it goes unnoticed

969
00:58:16,982 --> 00:58:20,525
when it's done so well and yeah and there's you know

970
00:58:21,545 --> 00:58:27,712
a rising interest in it, it seems like, like, you know, like we mentioned earlier, she runs the GDC

971
00:58:27,992 --> 00:58:36,522
UX summit. She's the chair of that. And I remember the first time that we did the summit,

972
00:58:36,802 --> 00:58:40,506
I think it was the first time, pretty sure. But it was just a huge, huge turnout.

973
00:58:41,087 --> 00:58:48,315
So this is something that, you know, is, you know, a newer field, you know, it's not like brand new,

974
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:54,342
but it's something that, you know, people are taking more interest in, and especially if you

975
00:58:54,742 --> 00:59:00,729
are a small studio, you know, you might not be able to, you know, hire somebody like Celia,

976
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:02,050
which by the way, hire Celia.

977
00:59:03,112 --> 00:59:09,100
And you want to try to, you know, obtain that information for yourself if you can.

978
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,201
And it's

979
00:59:13,541 --> 00:59:16,723
I think it'll just make for better video games,

980
00:59:16,783 --> 00:59:18,104
an overall better experience.

981
00:59:18,144 --> 00:59:23,187
Because like I said, you start realizing everything

982
00:59:23,247 --> 00:59:24,148
is user experience.

983
00:59:24,188 --> 00:59:24,468
Yeah.

984
00:59:25,068 --> 00:59:26,949
There is like the, I think it's in the Matrix,

985
00:59:27,009 --> 00:59:28,830
where everything feels back, and it's just

986
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:29,911
like the numbers and the data.

987
00:59:30,511 --> 00:59:31,932
It's like that, but everything's UX.

988
00:59:32,373 --> 00:59:32,833
Yeah.

989
00:59:33,353 --> 00:59:34,034
Exactly.

990
00:59:34,054 --> 00:59:38,116
Yeah, and also, you know.

991
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:42,051
There was, I wish there was more time to talk to her about this stuff,

992
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:44,231
but there's the learning aspect of it.

993
00:59:44,651 --> 00:59:47,412
And when I say learning aspect, it's like, it seems like

994
00:59:48,292 --> 00:59:50,013
90% of it is about learning.

995
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:56,054
She was talking about onboarding and, you know, that's a way of talking

996
00:59:56,134 --> 01:00:01,235
about, you know, the initial learning of, you know, this new system that

997
01:00:01,255 --> 01:00:02,516
you're going to be interacting with.

998
01:00:03,096 --> 01:00:03,416
So that's.

999
01:00:04,156 --> 01:00:14,188
you know, that's fascinating. There's that great analogy with the first stage of Super Mario

1000
01:00:14,228 --> 01:00:18,854
Brothers and I don't know if you saw it but it or I can't even remember like where it was. It's

1001
01:00:18,894 --> 01:00:21,377
somewhere. If someone can find that who's listening. Somewhere online.

1002
01:00:21,557 --> 01:00:28,905
Yeah, but it, you know, that those very first blocks in Super Mario Brothers taught you so many things

1003
01:00:29,346 --> 01:00:35,212
about how the rest of the game works and then it's just like okay. Well, that's you know, that's why

1004
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:36,734
Nintendo is

1005
01:00:37,595 --> 01:00:39,336
Number one in the biz right there. Yeah

1006
01:00:39,617 --> 01:00:43,680
That's the kind of stuff that I'll poke designers about when we talk to designers,

1007
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:46,782
is intuitively teaching people things.

1008
01:00:47,463 --> 01:00:51,786
And I didn't realize that was such a big part of the UX side of game development,

1009
01:00:52,506 --> 01:00:57,890
was just kind of the more data-driven looks at creating things in a readable way.

1010
01:00:59,171 --> 01:01:03,753
Um, we, we brought out ethics, uh, also talked about that for a little bit.

1011
01:01:04,033 --> 01:01:08,855
And if you're interested in looking more on that, um, Celia actually, I think if

1012
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:15,498
you just Googled, uh, Celia Hodent and, um, ethics, you'll turn up her Gama Sutra

1013
01:01:15,518 --> 01:01:20,080
blog, which is like thousands of words, a couple of, like a couple thousand words.

1014
01:01:20,161 --> 01:01:22,141
It's an expanded GDC talk, actually.

1015
01:01:23,102 --> 01:01:32,584
And she talks about the kinds of ethics and, you know, approaching these ethical issues in a scientific way.

1016
01:01:33,384 --> 01:01:42,407
And it, you know, talks about loot boxes also, all of these controversial things and, you know, a game addiction,

1017
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:47,568
which we weren't able to talk about too much, but these are things that...

1018
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,792
It's really interesting that it's at the top of her mind.

1019
01:01:50,812 --> 01:01:55,058
Um, and of course they should be because they're, they're UX based, aren't they?

1020
01:01:55,356 --> 01:02:00,358
Yeah, I was kind of married with earlier on in the conversation, it was mentioned that

1021
01:02:00,378 --> 01:02:05,521
like research, doing like a heavy research into how people think in game development,

1022
01:02:05,561 --> 01:02:09,443
like, outside, it kind of looks like shady, like, oh, they're trying to figure out how to

1023
01:02:09,623 --> 01:02:14,606
best extract money from the free to play. Yeah. But like her article on ethics talks about a lot

1024
01:02:14,946 --> 01:02:18,728
more of that, but in like a good multi layer and multifaceted way.

1025
01:02:18,748 --> 01:02:22,550
Yeah, her entire Gamma Sutra blog is very readable and

1026
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:31,074
knowledgeable and I recommend checking it out. Please don't judge the UX of our website.

1027
01:02:31,234 --> 01:02:35,797
It's uh, what's the word, vintage? Yeah, it's vintage. It's uh, you know, it's the aesthetic

1028
01:02:35,817 --> 01:02:42,121
that counts. Comfortable throwback to uh, yeah, anyway. Simpler time. That was a great

1029
01:02:42,581 --> 01:02:49,084
chat. She's so enthusiastic and I love it. Yes. I'm enthusiastic about Celia's enthusiasm.

1030
01:02:50,284 --> 01:02:53,166
All right, so that's all for this week.

1031
01:02:53,726 --> 01:02:56,568
You know, check us out on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify,

1032
01:02:56,968 --> 01:02:58,890
and should we keep saying YouTube?

1033
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:01,912
I haven't, we haven't uploaded one there

1034
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:02,813
in a little while.

1035
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:04,414
You can check something out on YouTube.

1036
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,555
We'll do it at some point.

1037
01:03:05,575 --> 01:03:06,775
There's other content.

1038
01:03:07,036 --> 01:03:08,236
There is a couple things out on YouTube.

1039
01:03:08,277 --> 01:03:10,578
Yeah, there's plenty of GDC content on YouTube besides us.

1040
01:03:12,439 --> 01:03:15,081
Yeah, you can go to GDC YouTube for other stuff, I guess.

1041
01:03:16,595 --> 01:03:20,597
So if you liked what you heard, uh, like and subscribe, please.
