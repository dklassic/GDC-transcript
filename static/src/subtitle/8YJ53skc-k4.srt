1
00:00:06,312 --> 00:00:08,033
All right, everybody, can I have your attention?

2
00:00:10,055 --> 00:00:12,316
So you are in room 130.

3
00:00:13,217 --> 00:00:16,018
It is 1.30, and I have about 130 slides.

4
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:18,600
So we're going to go really, really fast.

5
00:00:21,302 --> 00:00:24,124
Welcome to Design in Detail, how to subtitle your talk

6
00:00:24,144 --> 00:00:25,304
with an entire paragraph and make

7
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,805
sure you don't forget to mention Halo 3.

8
00:00:28,206 --> 00:00:30,107
Before we start, is anybody thirsty?

9
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:31,108
Can I get you anything?

10
00:00:31,188 --> 00:00:31,288
OK.

11
00:00:33,582 --> 00:00:38,005
I'm going to talk very fast, like I said. Let me tell you first about myself. I am a

12
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:43,369
gameplay design lead at Bungie Studios. I've been there for 11 years. I worked on all three

13
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:52,336
Halos and did the weapon balance for all three Halos. Except for the Halo 1 pistol. That

14
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:58,480
was somebody else and it was at the last minute and they didn't even tell me. So when you

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,643
curse somebody for the battle rifle spread, that's me. There's a face.

16
00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:08,937
and feelings. Last year I was at the Art Institute of Chicago. That's where I grew up. Not at

17
00:01:08,957 --> 00:01:14,220
the Art Institute, but at Chicago. And I saw one of the most famous paintings of all time.

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,121
And I took a picture of it with my iPhone. Does anybody want to guess what this is?

19
00:01:20,303 --> 00:01:25,926
Oh, somebody got it. Good. This is a Sunday afternoon on the island of Ganja. It's by

20
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:32,109
George Zara. And this painting inspired my talk. And it also inspired my very long title.

21
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:36,254
You probably will recognize it better from a little farther back.

22
00:01:37,635 --> 00:01:39,495
What I showed you was the lower right by the monkey.

23
00:01:41,176 --> 00:01:45,177
This painting is not famous for how it looks or what it shows.

24
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:47,818
This is famous because of how it was made.

25
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:53,400
So, Rott lived in the 1800s and he was very interested in how we perceive color.

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,941
Scientists at the time were just discovering that we see.

27
00:01:58,837 --> 00:02:02,900
one color, but what we're actually seeing is a mixture of several different types of

28
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:10,726
color and to demonstrate that fact, he invented the art school of pointillism, which basically

29
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:18,392
takes dots of basic colors and puts them together to produce an image with a huge variety of

30
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:18,753
color.

31
00:02:20,294 --> 00:02:26,098
So, I started thinking, what happens if we take Halo 3, we pointillize it, we break it

32
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:27,640
into these tiny details and then we...

33
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:29,828
Sorry, I'm popping a lot.

34
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:34,332
And then we take just one of those tiny details

35
00:02:34,712 --> 00:02:36,553
and explore it exhaustively.

36
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:41,537
Specifically, the time between shots for the sniper rifle.

37
00:02:42,438 --> 00:02:43,719
So this is my actual talk.

38
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,261
Before we get started, I have a couple caveats.

39
00:02:48,863 --> 00:02:51,765
My opinions do not represent fungi management.

40
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,648
They rarely represent reality.

41
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,771
This is the past as I remember it, and I'm sure that I'm glossing over stuff.

42
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:02,992
In fact, one of the things I want to talk about is how unreliable your brain is, especially your memory.

43
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:07,352
I have some examples from games.

44
00:03:07,872 --> 00:03:12,793
They are all from games that I like, just to avoid controversy, just to avoid fanboys.

45
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:15,614
I'm not ripping on any game that I criticize.

46
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,134
And this talk was really hard to write.

47
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:20,634
Like I said, it's at like 1.30 now.

48
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:23,015
It got to 300 slides at one point.

49
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:31,501
are focusing in on one little detail, you actually have more and more to say. So I'll

50
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:36,203
be presenting the full talk at Sniper IphoneCon 2011.

51
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:42,706
So first we're going to get some context from Halo 2. And what I'm going to show you through

52
00:03:42,726 --> 00:03:48,369
Halo 2 is sort of the four filters that I'm going to look through this detail through.

53
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:52,010
Halo 2 was pretty popular. We released it in 2005.

54
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:59,272
And according to Major Nelson, we were the top live game of 2006 and 2007 and 2008 and 2009.

55
00:04:00,553 --> 00:04:07,479
There was lots of months in there where other games came and went, but if you look at the Uniques for the whole year, it was Halo 2.

56
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:20,591
It's going to shut down in April, and I'm assuming it's going to be the top game of 2010, and then because Live for Xbox wanted to shut down forever.

57
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,771
The sniper rifle will remain balanced the whole time.

58
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:28,133
And what this does is it gives us

59
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:31,194
kind of a practical definition of balance,

60
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:32,935
which is often argued about.

61
00:04:33,095 --> 00:04:35,336
And I'm going to say the only definition of balance

62
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:37,997
that actually matters is that balance is longevity.

63
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:40,238
If it doesn't last, it wasn't balanced.

64
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,060
So we're going to do a little audience participation.

65
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,420
Balance this equation.

66
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,161
And just as soon as you get it, shout it out.

67
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:51,362
That's fast.

68
00:04:51,662 --> 00:04:52,443
You're a programmer, aren't you?

69
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,635
So now, balance this stack of blocks.

70
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:00,176
Anybody?

71
00:05:02,397 --> 00:05:06,158
So my point here is that balance is not a process.

72
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:07,819
It is not something that you do to a game.

73
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:09,299
It is a state of the game.

74
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,941
And so what you're trying to get to get longevity

75
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,782
is a static situation that is balanced.

76
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:19,763
Rule number four of Jenga.

77
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:20,863
Quote it with me.

78
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:24,683
Your turn ends 10 seconds after you stack your block.

79
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:27,684
So even in a game like Jenga, they

80
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:32,065
understand that balance requires lasting, requires longevity.

81
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:35,126
Let's talk about the Halo 2 Crunch.

82
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,547
There's been talks about the Halo 2 Crunch.

83
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:38,407
I'm not going to rehash them.

84
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:40,808
It was less than ideal.

85
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:45,810
My postmortem is, don't try to fix bugs in the tutorial

86
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,931
and balance the weapons at the same time.

87
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,432
Find somebody else to do the tutorial.

88
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:58,067
production is always worried about a repeat of this situation, so they're constantly

89
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:02,269
asking me when I'm going to be done. We kind of have a love-hate relationship.

90
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:09,474
So I invented the balancer's paradox. Balance can't happen until the end. Balance can't

91
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:16,018
wait until the end. You can answer any question with one of these two points. But the problem

92
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:20,241
is that when we did get to the end, you have to resolve the balancer's paradox.

93
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:23,900
the technique that I came up with is to balance in passes.

94
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:29,904
So, what does this mean?

95
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:32,926
It means at the end of each pass through the balance,

96
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,408
the game is static.

97
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:39,451
The game is, it has that longevity to a certain level.

98
00:06:41,732 --> 00:06:42,573
Then you don't backtrack.

99
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,395
Once you achieve balance, don't lose it.

100
00:06:46,636 --> 00:06:49,778
You can try to balance at a finer degree of detail, but...

101
00:06:50,212 --> 00:06:52,714
But don't ever upset the apple cart.

102
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:56,576
Halo 3 had six balance passes, roughly.

103
00:06:56,597 --> 00:06:57,957
I mean, they kind of play together.

104
00:06:57,977 --> 00:07:01,740
But role, flow, strength, limitation, exceptions,

105
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,400
and perceptions.

106
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,562
And don't worry, I'll get to these in a lot more detail.

107
00:07:06,063 --> 00:07:09,745
So after all that stuff about Halo 2's dominated life,

108
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:12,347
Halo 2 was not balanced.

109
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:17,270
We shipped Halo 2, and the designers,

110
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:18,972
after waking up from the coma.

111
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:22,904
I started to play it on live and felt wrong.

112
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:27,868
It was different than how we played it in the office.

113
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:30,090
In a lot of ways, it was broken.

114
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,633
And we sort of looked at each other

115
00:07:33,693 --> 00:07:35,815
and we knew this is not going to have legs.

116
00:07:35,835 --> 00:07:36,795
This is not going to last.

117
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:38,857
How did we know this?

118
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,780
Well, during the development, we had

119
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:44,902
fine-tuned our sense of balance.

120
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:52,847
Malcolm Gladwell lays out in his book, Outliers, the 10,000-hour rule.

121
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:59,013
10,000 hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with a world-class

122
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:00,655
expert on anything.

123
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:06,301
So this means I'm an expert in trying and trying to balance a sniper rifle.

124
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:10,574
Niels Bohr offers an alternative definition.

125
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:12,895
An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that

126
00:08:12,915 --> 00:08:14,216
can be made in a narrow field.

127
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:17,038
And that also means I'm an expert at trying

128
00:08:17,058 --> 00:08:20,360
to balance a sniper rifle and at driving too fast

129
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,000
for conditions.

130
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,061
But don't ask about that.

131
00:08:24,682 --> 00:08:26,943
So in order to establish a sense of balance,

132
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:28,884
you need to understand how your brain works.

133
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:32,086
So I'm going to talk just really briefly about the neuroscience

134
00:08:32,406 --> 00:08:33,167
of intuition.

135
00:08:33,187 --> 00:08:36,548
You have this thing called the orbital frontal cortex.

136
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,020
Easy for me to say.

137
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:43,083
It's called that because it's located behind your eyes,

138
00:08:43,143 --> 00:08:44,463
but we call it the gut.

139
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:48,366
And it goes through a learning process.

140
00:08:48,406 --> 00:08:50,067
What it does is it builds a model of the world,

141
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,689
tries to make predictions and anticipate

142
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:54,369
what's going to happen.

143
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,972
And if it's right, it releases this chemical called dopamine.

144
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:00,873
And that kind of cements the neurons

145
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:02,234
into that configuration.

146
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:05,956
And it does this over and over and over again about everything.

147
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:07,537
Even things that you don't even care about.

148
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:14,437
ordering fast food, like, it tries to predict how long it's going to take before they bring

149
00:09:14,477 --> 00:09:21,562
your money back and you can't turn it off. But you can sort of guide that process and

150
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:26,906
what you're trying to do is you're trying to get the game inside of your head. And that's

151
00:09:26,926 --> 00:09:31,089
what happened to us in Halo 2. We had the game so internalized that when we played it,

152
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:36,133
it was different than the game that was inside of us. And we knew from the way it was different

153
00:09:36,673 --> 00:09:37,954
that we were going to have problems down the road.

154
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:45,652
So back to AO2. Nobody wants a patch. Choosing to patch is hard. Luckily we had networking

155
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:51,595
bugs so we knew we were going to have to have a patch anyway. Choosing what to patch was

156
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:57,217
even harder. Some things, we made melee do a little bit more damage, grenades smaller

157
00:09:57,257 --> 00:10:01,219
radius, we were just trying to make it so that the game didn't degenerate into dual

158
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:06,982
wielding all the time. But choosing what not to patch was our risk of all.

159
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:13,430
and we didn't patch a sniper rifle, and that was like the top of the things that we were going to

160
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,673
change, but we ended up not. It's just, it didn't have as broad an impact as the other changes, and

161
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:24,796
our studio head used to be a test lead, and so he's pretty harsh about stuff like that. So my

162
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:33,161
final theme for this talk is make the hard choices. Don't put them off, don't let them happen by

163
00:10:33,261 --> 00:10:36,963
chance, don't let somebody else do it, make it yourself. What do I mean?

164
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:39,993
When I say hard choices, why are these choices hard?

165
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:41,974
Again, the answer is in your brain.

166
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:44,055
But this time, it's in the neuroscience of reasoning.

167
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:46,417
This thing called the prefrontal, again,

168
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:47,798
easy for me to say cortex.

169
00:10:48,498 --> 00:10:50,419
And I don't know why it's called that.

170
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,481
But I call it the brain.

171
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:57,524
Your brain is a poor tool.

172
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:01,987
It can only handle a very small number of factors.

173
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:03,788
It is easily confused.

174
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,363
It's subject to all kinds of errors and fallacies and biases.

175
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:14,087
You're not going to be able to reason about your game in its entirety.

176
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:19,731
But what you can do is reason on a very small detail scale.

177
00:11:21,192 --> 00:11:33,681
So Radiolab, great podcast slash radio broadcast out of New York, describes this psychological

178
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:34,162
experiment.

179
00:11:35,088 --> 00:11:38,370
where they bring people in, they give them a number to memorize.

180
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,111
Some people get a two-digit number,

181
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:41,632
some people get a 10-digit number.

182
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:44,834
And then they say, OK, we need you to walk down the hall

183
00:11:45,234 --> 00:11:48,095
and go tell this number to our assistant in the other room.

184
00:11:49,896 --> 00:11:51,857
On the way, and it's not clear that's part of the test

185
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,798
because that's how all good psychological tests work,

186
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,640
somebody offers them a snack.

187
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,601
And they can either have an apple or some cake.

188
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:01,402
And what they find is that

189
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:05,413
The people with the short numbers choose apples, because they're thinking,

190
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:08,254
I've got to cut calories, I've got to budge my weight, you know.

191
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:12,715
They're reasoning about their choice.

192
00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:17,997
Whereas the people with longer numbers, and we're not talking the first hundred decimals of pi,

193
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:22,318
we're talking about a ten-digit number, you know, a social security number or something,

194
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:25,999
they choose cake, like by huge margins.

195
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:28,900
That's because their rational brain is full.

196
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:39,600
Ten numbers is all it takes to fill your brain, so don't think you're going to look at a weapon tag with 40 values and understand it all in your head at once.

197
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,201
At least not rationally.

198
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:53,467
So my four themes. Balance is longevity, balance in passes, developers need to balance, and make the hard choices.

199
00:12:54,888 --> 00:12:57,289
We're going to start with Halo 3 paper design.

200
00:12:58,509 --> 00:12:59,770
Are there any producers in the audience?

201
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,510
A couple?

202
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:03,411
Don't worry, I don't bite.

203
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:04,592
This slide is for you.

204
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:07,833
Paper design happens in pre-production.

205
00:13:07,873 --> 00:13:11,915
You need to start before you have 40 artists sitting around

206
00:13:11,935 --> 00:13:12,536
with nothing to do.

207
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,437
And don't exit it too early.

208
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:19,539
That is actually what led to Halo 2 having

209
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:20,319
such a rotten crunch.

210
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:25,161
Every gameplay object needs a paper design.

211
00:13:26,082 --> 00:13:27,963
As a designer, it's your responsibility

212
00:13:28,634 --> 00:13:32,155
be disciplined. And this is going to save you time in the long run.

213
00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:37,596
So this has never been seen outside of Bungie. I think probably most of the current Bungie

214
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:43,937
employees have never seen this. I didn't ask if I could show it, but that's okay. This

215
00:13:43,977 --> 00:13:55,819
is the paper designed for the original sniper—oops, I skipped it. Sorry. This is the paper designed

216
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:57,300
for the first sniper rifle.

217
00:13:58,753 --> 00:14:02,634
You can see it's four lines long, talks about the range,

218
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:07,435
five round clip, which is not what we ended up shipping.

219
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:12,757
It's got a lot of stuff about the flood in it.

220
00:14:13,377 --> 00:14:14,717
So spoilers, sorry about that.

221
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:21,019
And the second trigger actually, we originally

222
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:22,999
planned that the second trigger on the controller

223
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:23,740
was going to control zoom.

224
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:28,706
So some important things to note about that spec.

225
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:30,407
It's pretty flawed.

226
00:14:31,248 --> 00:14:32,849
There's a lot of things that were wrong.

227
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:34,370
It's not five shots.

228
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,231
The contrail is not small or short.

229
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:38,313
There's a lot of mechanics that are unclear.

230
00:14:38,353 --> 00:14:41,775
The zoom is totally, it says to be decided in the spec.

231
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:43,696
Headshots are very vague.

232
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:45,838
And many details are missing.

233
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:47,679
Maximum ammo count, body shot damage.

234
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:49,460
You couldn't hand this off to a programmer

235
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,621
and get anything back.

236
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:51,701
They'd have too many questions.

237
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:56,506
That's okay. It's a paper design. A paper design is about role, which is an abstract concept.

238
00:14:57,587 --> 00:15:01,629
So now let's look at Halo 3's paper design. It's a little bit longer, a little bit more organized.

239
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:03,270
It ought to be. This is the third time we did it.

240
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:10,194
I'm going to break it out on further slides, so you don't need to worry about reading it all,

241
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:13,536
but just kind of get a feel for how big it is and how detailed.

242
00:15:14,216 --> 00:15:17,158
It's still pretty abstract, but the role is even more clear.

243
00:15:17,178 --> 00:15:20,339
There's nothing about fiction in it. There's nothing about enemy characters.

244
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,311
Very little about art.

245
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:30,995
So, the very first line, role, long-range, instant-kill sniper rifle, but reloading

246
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:32,036
makes it difficult to use.

247
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:35,718
And really the only reason why reloading is in there is because there's a covenant sniper

248
00:15:35,798 --> 00:15:37,379
rifle where heat makes it difficult to use.

249
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:41,761
Talks about range, talks about the damage, talks about its limitations.

250
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:43,342
That's it.

251
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,984
Clearly specify the role in your paper design.

252
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:48,745
But let's look even closer.

253
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:54,555
It has a bunch of supporting mechanics, so two zoom levels, a magazine of four shots

254
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:55,595
with a slow reload.

255
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:58,356
It talks about the feeling we want to bring out.

256
00:15:58,636 --> 00:16:02,157
It does massive damage, you know, used good descriptive words like that.

257
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,059
It also points out critical assets.

258
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,599
This is not so a producer can go and make a schedule out of it.

259
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,160
It's so that when you're thinking about the sniper rifle, you have to be thinking about

260
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,101
that special depth animation every single time.

261
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:15,962
You can't do one without the other.

262
00:16:17,297 --> 00:16:18,698
And it's got a couple of little special details,

263
00:16:18,738 --> 00:16:22,340
like there's a delay when you fire your last shot.

264
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:26,323
Really what it should be doing is unzooming and reloading

265
00:16:26,363 --> 00:16:26,983
immediately, right?

266
00:16:27,023 --> 00:16:29,325
But then you're not seeing what happened with your last shot.

267
00:16:29,385 --> 00:16:31,686
So it waits a second, half a second, actually.

268
00:16:34,148 --> 00:16:35,909
Include what is necessary, nothing more.

269
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,891
So how do you develop your sense of balance for paper designs?

270
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:40,892
It can be done.

271
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:42,513
I think I can look at a paper design

272
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:46,576
and have a pretty good idea of how it's going to work.

273
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:53,206
Mostly you're looking for the role and a couple of key factors that are the results of the

274
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:53,487
role.

275
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:56,488
So, you're looking for a sense of depth.

276
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:01,870
You want to balance between simple and complex.

277
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,911
If you make a role that's too simple, people are going to get bored.

278
00:17:05,611 --> 00:17:08,132
If you make a role that's too complex, people are going to get boggled.

279
00:17:10,073 --> 00:17:13,334
So what you want is a barely manageable number of choices.

280
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,175
You want people to look at your weapon.

281
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:20,357
be thinking of all the crazy stuff they can do, but really they don't have to execute on most of that stuff.

282
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:24,659
This is where role comes in, because game theory...

283
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:28,680
sorry, the sniper rifle is sometimes the best weapon.

284
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,962
And game theory tells us that if strategies have the same payoff,

285
00:17:33,742 --> 00:17:37,684
they all have a numerical equivalent payoff, then people are just going to pick randomly.

286
00:17:37,964 --> 00:17:38,364
Doesn't matter.

287
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:44,026
On the other hand, if you have roles, you have asymmetry, and if you have asymmetry, that means...

288
00:17:44,745 --> 00:17:47,647
sometimes you're going to get moved to a certain strategy or another.

289
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,789
And that's sort of the core of depth.

290
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:52,170
So roles require real differences.

291
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,135
And that's why Rock, Paper, Scissors, though it makes a great t-shirt,

292
00:17:59,256 --> 00:18:00,116
is bad game design.

293
00:18:01,237 --> 00:18:03,479
Every choice in Rock, Paper, Scissors has the same payoff.

294
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,640
So you just pick randomly.

295
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:08,963
It's not even really a game. It's gambling.

296
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:18,833
So the sniper rifle is the only very long-range weapon.

297
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:19,794
What does that mean?

298
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:22,356
Well, technically there's a beam rifle,

299
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,677
but those don't appear in the same mission,

300
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:26,959
so for the purposes of argument, let's say there's only one.

301
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,323
It means that for every role, there is one weapon.

302
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:32,924
It's unique.

303
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:39,148
You don't want to add multiple copies of the same role,

304
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:40,750
because you're just going to add complexity.

305
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,011
You're not adding depth.

306
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:47,373
It's really hard to add weapons to Halo because most of the roles are filled, there's a limited

307
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:47,673
number.

308
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:53,038
You kind of have to force a little bit of space in there or rely on AI or something.

309
00:18:53,878 --> 00:18:56,360
And so, so roles must be unique.

310
00:18:57,581 --> 00:19:01,304
Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock, funny joke, not a good game.

311
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:07,289
It's worse than rock, paper, scissors because it's more complicated, but it's not actually

312
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,291
more, it doesn't have more depth.

313
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:14,688
The converse of what I just said is also true. The sniper rifle is a necessary role.

314
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:18,690
So, um, the ratio of weapons to roles needs to be one-to-one as well.

315
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:24,372
If you have a game without certain roles, then you're going to have an incomplete game, and people are going to feel it.

316
00:19:25,973 --> 00:19:29,334
Uh, this is why almost every first-person shooter out there has the same set of weapons.

317
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:34,377
It's not because we're not original, it's because these are the weapons you need to make a game like this.

318
00:19:36,297 --> 00:19:37,058
Roles must be filled.

319
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,440
rock paper, that doesn't even make any sense.

320
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:50,883
I should admit, Halo 1, that close to shipping without a shotgun.

321
00:19:52,263 --> 00:19:53,484
I know.

322
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:54,324
But,

323
00:19:56,805 --> 00:19:59,366
we didn't think that there was a necessary role there,

324
00:19:59,646 --> 00:20:02,146
and we were pretty prominent, so we had to kind of scrounge at the last second.

325
00:20:05,047 --> 00:20:07,068
So, the last way that roles provide depth is, um,

326
00:20:08,737 --> 00:20:10,098
You don't have a crappy sniper rifle.

327
00:20:10,518 --> 00:20:11,958
You want to avoid strict dominance.

328
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:13,939
What is strict dominance?

329
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,620
OK, who is going to pick the health potion?

330
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,361
And who's going to pick the piece of heart?

331
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:21,961
The health potion is single use.

332
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:24,442
It just repunishes your health.

333
00:20:24,782 --> 00:20:26,042
You can go buy it in the store.

334
00:20:26,482 --> 00:20:27,843
The piece of heart is totally unique.

335
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,803
It makes your health bar longer, and you can never buy it.

336
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:33,724
Yeah, everybody picks a piece of heart.

337
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:35,065
Sorry if you didn't.

338
00:20:35,545 --> 00:20:36,465
You were probably eight.

339
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:36,845
It's OK.

340
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,907
So no crappy sniper rifle because you want to avoid strict dominance.

341
00:20:46,008 --> 00:20:49,989
And then you want to practice iterative deletion, which is when you go in and you remove all

342
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:50,969
the dominated strategies.

343
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:54,990
So you remove all the crappy sniper rifles, and then you remove all the strategies that

344
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,751
were only good against these strategies that you just eliminated.

345
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:04,633
So for example, if you have an anti-tank mine, and then you cut the tank, you should also

346
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:05,753
cut the anti-tank mine.

347
00:21:06,113 --> 00:21:08,074
Otherwise, you have a strategy that doesn't dominate anything.

348
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:13,827
So the second way that you develop a sense of balance about paper designs is to look

349
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:17,970
for anticipation. Anticipation is not the right word, but there isn't really a word

350
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,954
maybe in some other language. What you're trying to do is pick between chaos and certainty.

351
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:27,337
If you have a game that's too chaotic, then everybody's just guessing all the time. If

352
00:21:27,357 --> 00:21:32,961
you have a game that's too certain, then it's predetermined. You've got to be careful because

353
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:37,544
certain parts of your audience want a game that's totally chaos because they're not very

354
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:39,205
good at your game and they want a chance to win.

355
00:21:40,027 --> 00:21:43,269
And some elements of your audience want a game that is totally predictable,

356
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:44,830
because they're really good at your game,

357
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:46,812
and they don't want anything to get in the way of them winning.

358
00:21:46,832 --> 00:21:49,134
But you really need to lie in the middle.

359
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:53,897
And that means that balance is probable, but not inevitable, future events.

360
00:21:55,078 --> 00:21:59,802
Maybe one way to think about it is a bad form of anticipation, which is,

361
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:03,404
I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the winner in front of you.

362
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:04,525
You all know this scene, I'm sure.

363
00:22:04,545 --> 00:22:05,326
Vizzini.

364
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:08,888
He's talking to himself in circles, right?

365
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:12,336
And if they were having a sword fight while this happened, he would be doomed.

366
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:21,423
So there's a guy in the audience, David Sterling, who calls this kind of anticipation Yomi,

367
00:22:22,804 --> 00:22:25,026
which is Japanese for reading the mind of your opponent.

368
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:30,990
Yomi comes in layers. Oh no, I'm out of power.

369
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:35,874
We're back on.

370
00:22:38,985 --> 00:22:41,066
So the first layer is, uh, I know what I will do.

371
00:22:41,707 --> 00:22:43,108
Second layer is, I know what he will do.

372
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:47,772
Third layer is, he knows what I will do in reaction to what I know he will do.

373
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:53,697
This works great if you're a professional Street Fighter player, uh, championship, uh, level.

374
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:58,681
It's not so great if you're a frat boy and you're just wanting to play while you have a beer.

375
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:00,923
So for a game like Halo, stop.

376
00:23:01,824 --> 00:23:02,684
Stop at three.

377
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:05,106
In fact, stop at two and a half.

378
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:06,828
Not beers, yummy layers.

379
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:12,688
The sniper rifle has one purpose, if I see you carrying it, I know what you're going to do, I don't have to guess.

380
00:23:13,328 --> 00:23:13,528
Right?

381
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,791
So you want to limit the amount of second guessing.

382
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:19,193
And that helps people anticipate, that helps your balance.

383
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:26,520
Successfully sniping confers no benefits.

384
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,685
How many of you have heard that feedback loops are always good in games?

385
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:34,046
It's not true.

386
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:42,490
If you have a positive feedback loop, you do well, you get rewarded by being able to do well more, you're going to win.

387
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:48,473
You get a killstreak, I mean you've all been on the receiving end of a killstreak, that's not good balance.

388
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:58,939
If you have experience points, I kill an enemy, a Warcraft mob, say,

389
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,322
and I get experience points, that makes me better at killing him, right?

390
00:24:03,762 --> 00:24:04,823
It's great for a single player game.

391
00:24:05,102 --> 00:24:08,885
It's great for a game that's built on investment and progression, but if you're really just

392
00:24:08,965 --> 00:24:13,087
pulling back to balance, positive feedback's going to spin you out of control.

393
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,628
Same thing with negative feedback.

394
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:17,110
So if I do bad, I do worse.

395
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:22,033
That's one of the best new features of modern warfare is if you do bad, they'll let you

396
00:24:22,053 --> 00:24:22,354
do better.

397
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:23,274
Right?

398
00:24:24,595 --> 00:24:27,617
So if I miss with a sniper rifle, now I'm out of ammo, now I don't even have a sniper

399
00:24:27,677 --> 00:24:27,837
rifle.

400
00:24:28,518 --> 00:24:32,700
Or if I miss four times and I'm going to reload, now I can't even fire my weapon.

401
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,401
Feedback loops push you away from balance.

402
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:39,102
They're great for a lot of other systems in games.

403
00:24:39,422 --> 00:24:40,383
They're not great for balance.

404
00:24:42,204 --> 00:24:46,026
So the last thing the rolls do is they let you bite off more

405
00:24:46,046 --> 00:24:46,587
than you can chew.

406
00:24:48,368 --> 00:24:49,909
Sniper rifle is never your only option.

407
00:24:49,949 --> 00:24:51,650
I'm going to start hurrying up here.

408
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:54,751
You want to use multiple gameplay channels

409
00:24:55,852 --> 00:24:58,333
so that you're never relying on just one weapon being balanced.

410
00:24:59,994 --> 00:25:02,396
Sniper rifle takes up a very specific inventory slot.

411
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:03,717
So if you have monolithic.

412
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:11,154
inventories, like cars in a car racing game, those are really hard to balance. You've got to balance every car against every other car.

413
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:17,519
On the other hand, slots are easier. Weapons and Halo only have to be balanced against other weapons, they don't have to be balanced against the Warthog.

414
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,002
Grenades don't have to be balanced against equipment, so use balance groups whenever you can.

415
00:25:23,584 --> 00:25:28,147
A sniper rifle is not in every map, so you can kind of limit the interactions in that way.

416
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:31,169
Hard Choices is about a paper design.

417
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:33,971
Picking the right mechanics.

418
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:39,735
We left off the sniper rifle night vision scope in this paper design because it just

419
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:42,356
wasn't that important to become the right mechanic.

420
00:25:43,136 --> 00:25:47,819
You want to capture the mood, so engage the animation, the imagination, don't use sterile

421
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:48,139
language.

422
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,621
You want to focus on your core before your SPICE.

423
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:53,622
Sniper rifle was done before the overshield.

424
00:25:53,642 --> 00:25:59,785
It should be obvious, but a lot of times you have some little weapon that's kind of tweaky

425
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:02,566
and weird and it's only going to be used in one place, you spend too much time on it.

426
00:26:04,085 --> 00:26:07,468
A very important mentor in my life said, once you're done, cut half.

427
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:10,750
This is always good advice. It never sounds like it, but it is.

428
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,431
If you can't describe the role, cut it.

429
00:26:12,691 --> 00:26:14,973
If you think it's too similar to something else, cut it.

430
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,374
If you can't sell it to the team, cut it.

431
00:26:16,814 --> 00:26:19,856
You're going to want to cut so that you can focus on the things that remain.

432
00:26:21,337 --> 00:26:27,461
So the second pass in the sniper rifle setting is setting up the initial values.

433
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,703
And what you're trying to capture here is the flow.

434
00:26:31,864 --> 00:26:32,525
Again, producers.

435
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,271
This happens really early in production.

436
00:26:35,872 --> 00:26:39,034
As the objects come online, you want to set the tone up front.

437
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,156
You've got to stay ahead of everybody else.

438
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:43,498
And you want to give your designers lots

439
00:26:43,578 --> 00:26:45,520
of space in this stage.

440
00:26:47,621 --> 00:26:49,243
Feedback is not important when you're setting up

441
00:26:49,263 --> 00:26:49,943
the initial values.

442
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,245
In fact, it's best done in private.

443
00:26:52,726 --> 00:26:53,686
You want to do it on your machine.

444
00:26:53,766 --> 00:26:54,987
You don't even want to check it in sometimes.

445
00:26:57,489 --> 00:26:59,931
You guys heard of Mahayachik Sent Mahayi?

446
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:01,809
His book Flow?

447
00:27:02,129 --> 00:27:04,149
Mahayachik sent Mahayachik, Mahayachik sent Mahayachik,

448
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:05,329
that's like Flow right there, right?

449
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:07,930
The problem is he wrote his book in the 70s.

450
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:12,350
It's about that kind of state of consciousness

451
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,251
that you get in when you're really grooving.

452
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:16,451
He wrote it in the 70s, he didn't mention video games in it.

453
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:18,211
So how do we apply it to video games?

454
00:27:19,272 --> 00:27:21,632
Well, there's a lot of research that says

455
00:27:21,712 --> 00:27:25,553
your physical aspect influences your mood,

456
00:27:25,593 --> 00:27:27,753
so smiling makes you happy, laughing makes you happy.

457
00:27:29,876 --> 00:27:37,037
rifle fires with a very specific timing because it makes your fingers happy. If you set up

458
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:41,258
our sniper rifle so it's too slow, your fingers get bored in between shots, they're waiting.

459
00:27:42,238 --> 00:27:46,079
If you set it up so it's too fast, then the shots blur together, you're not really seeing

460
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:52,160
the results of every single shot. So you want to focus on cadence when you're trying to

461
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:57,362
capture flow. Versatility, which is the quality of seeming to be true.

462
00:27:58,614 --> 00:28:02,555
Sniper rifles on a trigger, for weapons, versatility is really easy.

463
00:28:03,636 --> 00:28:05,797
For others it's not so, for other mechanics it's not so easy.

464
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,458
So what you want to do is you want to make sure that the finger movements match the action

465
00:28:09,518 --> 00:28:09,918
in some way.

466
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,959
Shooting on a trigger, punching, it's on a button.

467
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:17,281
You don't want to set it up the opposite because then people can't get comfortable with your

468
00:28:17,301 --> 00:28:20,902
control scheme, they can't enter that flow state.

469
00:28:20,942 --> 00:28:26,564
So if you have punching and kicking on a stick, say, right, like that isn't analogous to the

470
00:28:26,644 --> 00:28:27,384
action that you're taking.

471
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:33,135
Switching inventory on a D-pad, that's not the way you do it in any other interface,

472
00:28:33,395 --> 00:28:33,595
right?

473
00:28:34,036 --> 00:28:38,057
And so people aren't used to that, and they're just never going to learn to do it naturally

474
00:28:38,097 --> 00:28:39,737
without popping up out of flow.

475
00:28:41,338 --> 00:28:42,538
Virtually anything on a stick click.

476
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:47,879
Like I said, we were wanting to put the zoom onto the trigger for a good reason.

477
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:49,400
Nobody gets the stick click.

478
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,741
If you play a lot of Halo, eventually you'll get used to it, but it's not easy.

479
00:28:55,521 --> 00:28:56,542
So you want to play in your spectacle.

480
00:28:56,962 --> 00:28:58,002
The sniper rifle has a...

481
00:28:58,835 --> 00:29:03,236
delay on the sound, the contrail hangs in the air for a really long time. Like I said,

482
00:29:03,257 --> 00:29:11,540
there's a special animation when you get headshots. And the reason for that is if you are in a

483
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,722
flow state, the spectacle keeps you there. It stops you from being distracted from what's

484
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:23,225
going on off your TV. Let me tell you a story from this screenshot. Red guy shoots a blue

485
00:29:23,265 --> 00:29:28,007
glove with a sniper rifle. He misses. Then there's this crazy rickshay insanity.

486
00:29:28,805 --> 00:29:29,865
And the red guy gets in the trail.

487
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:32,286
So how did I tell this story from the screenshot?

488
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:32,746
That's not me.

489
00:29:33,046 --> 00:29:34,046
I'm not the red guy.

490
00:29:34,286 --> 00:29:35,446
I was the blue guy that dodged.

491
00:29:37,147 --> 00:29:37,667
Causality.

492
00:29:39,568 --> 00:29:41,588
Basically, you want to pass the YouTube test.

493
00:29:42,228 --> 00:29:43,869
And the sniper rifle looks really good on YouTube.

494
00:29:44,469 --> 00:29:45,629
There's the giant contrail.

495
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:47,050
There's a special headshot animation.

496
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,570
You want to exaggerate your causality.

497
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,231
You want to delay it, artificially stretch it out.

498
00:29:52,311 --> 00:29:56,792
So you've seen a chain explosion of grenades in Halo.

499
00:29:57,236 --> 00:30:01,260
There's like a 0.1 second delay between when one grenade goes off and the next one goes

500
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,745
off and the next one goes off so that you can see the whole process unfold.

501
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:11,130
It's also one of the reasons why Halo feels a little bit floaty is because we want it

502
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:14,593
to be a little bit slow so you can watch the causality.

503
00:30:15,094 --> 00:30:17,356
It also makes it a really good game for other people to watch.

504
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:24,519
Causality preserves flow because you understand what's happening

505
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:27,001
the whole time, and you can kind of predict it

506
00:30:27,141 --> 00:30:28,522
along with what's happening.

507
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:31,345
So how do you get your sense of balance?

508
00:30:31,545 --> 00:30:34,828
How do you know what initial settings should be?

509
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:36,909
Lower your flow barrier.

510
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,932
So sniper flow is very fragile.

511
00:30:40,232 --> 00:30:41,753
It's really easy to pop out of it.

512
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:43,995
And what you want to be able to do is make yourself

513
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:44,816
easy to entertain.

514
00:30:44,836 --> 00:30:47,558
You've got to train yourself to ignore frame rate problems.

515
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:48,879
You want to ignore bugs and glitches.

516
00:30:50,423 --> 00:30:52,923
You want to practice filling in details with your mind.

517
00:30:52,943 --> 00:30:55,204
You want to use your imagination and see the game

518
00:30:55,264 --> 00:30:56,984
as it's going to be when it's done,

519
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:58,505
not how it is right now.

520
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:00,825
Make mouth noises.

521
00:31:01,446 --> 00:31:02,586
This sounds ridiculous, right?

522
00:31:03,226 --> 00:31:05,987
Don't do it at your desk if you have a shared space.

523
00:31:06,027 --> 00:31:08,987
But pew, pew, pew, that puts you in flow.

524
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:12,108
That gets your whole body connected

525
00:31:12,148 --> 00:31:13,289
with what's going on on the screen.

526
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,250
And then play v-games with an open mind.

527
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,010
The last game we played was Avatar.

528
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,090
Had so much fun.

529
00:31:23,385 --> 00:31:24,366
Does he just meet the game where it is?

530
00:31:24,386 --> 00:31:34,709
On the other hand, sniping flow has a high ceiling, meaning that if you're really in the flow state, you can really get in the flow state.

531
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:37,189
So you want to also raise your flow barrier.

532
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:42,771
You want to never be satisfied. You want to get in a mood where you can get irritated with every single bump.

533
00:31:43,311 --> 00:31:44,472
You've got to unleash your inner critic.

534
00:31:46,732 --> 00:31:50,173
You take the best game to come out last year and you just rip it apart.

535
00:31:51,064 --> 00:31:55,748
point out every flaw, like understand everything that's preventing you from reaching that maximum flow.

536
00:31:57,129 --> 00:31:59,270
And I'm warning you, this is going to wreck your ability to play games for fun.

537
00:31:59,891 --> 00:32:01,332
That's okay, because now you're making them for fun.

538
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:05,395
This is why you're a designer. Those of you in the room that are designers,

539
00:32:05,895 --> 00:32:08,357
I really think this is the essential design skill.

540
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:13,381
Don't expect other disciplines to have it. Programmers are going to see bugs.

541
00:32:13,842 --> 00:32:16,063
Artists are going to see kind of the still frame, the compositions.

542
00:32:17,564 --> 00:32:20,307
Producers are going to see inexplicable delays as you're just like constantly.

543
00:32:21,132 --> 00:32:23,333
doing what looks like nothing over and over again.

544
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,455
But you need to learn how to apply conscious control.

545
00:32:27,475 --> 00:32:29,356
You know when you're having fun,

546
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:30,697
know when you're fooling yourself.

547
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,939
This is really hard to interview for.

548
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,341
One thing that I have noticed is that philosophy majors

549
00:32:37,761 --> 00:32:40,002
tend to have this more often than the general population.

550
00:32:40,022 --> 00:32:43,304
I think it's because in philosophy you're being taught to

551
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,125
analyze your own thoughts and your own opinions

552
00:32:45,145 --> 00:32:46,906
and sort of why you believe what you believe,

553
00:32:47,106 --> 00:32:50,648
and how that helps for controlling your own flow state.

554
00:32:53,566 --> 00:33:01,190
Most sniper rifles aren't fun. I'm sorry. They don't find that flow. Or they had some other goal, like they had a mission, they had a support or something.

555
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:11,976
The reason why, maybe because they're not searching broadly enough. They're doing science. They're making one change at a time.

556
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:17,640
They have a control group and they make a change and then they compare it. You can't do that. You gotta, at this stage, you gotta go drastic.

557
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:23,023
You gotta, let's try a sniper rifle that only fires once every ten minutes. Okay, well it turns out that's not fun, but that's okay because...

558
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:25,433
We're trying everything.

559
00:33:26,554 --> 00:33:28,056
Don't tell the engineers that you're trying all this stuff.

560
00:33:28,076 --> 00:33:29,117
Try to get a tool you can do yourself,

561
00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:30,258
because they'll think you're crazy.

562
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,340
My engineers think I'm crazy.

563
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:36,063
So imagine that you're trying to learn how to drive, right?

564
00:33:36,343 --> 00:33:37,264
But nobody's wanting to teach you.

565
00:33:38,906 --> 00:33:40,067
The accelerator doesn't do anything

566
00:33:40,587 --> 00:33:41,428
until you find the ignition.

567
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,991
The blinkers are pointless unless you're in traffic.

568
00:33:45,011 --> 00:33:45,952
Don't tell me why I said that.

569
00:33:46,012 --> 00:33:46,833
But they're pointless.

570
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:48,715
They don't do anything unless you're in traffic.

571
00:33:49,372 --> 00:33:51,912
And sometimes when you release the emergency brake, you roll down the hill and you crash.

572
00:33:52,412 --> 00:33:55,513
You don't understand why. That's okay. You've got to change in groups.

573
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,154
You've got to change multiple things at once. Don't just,

574
00:33:57,374 --> 00:34:00,315
well, I'm going to iterate on this one number until it's perfect.

575
00:34:00,575 --> 00:34:04,036
Because you're never going to get there because maybe that number doesn't do anything until you change something else.

576
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:10,778
There's this great book, Embracing the Wide Sky. It's by Anne By, Daniel Tammitt.

577
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:14,199
He has Asperger's and he's this numeric genius.

578
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:19,060
He sees prime numbers as petals.

579
00:34:19,845 --> 00:34:21,986
And all of their numbers are these jaggy things.

580
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,268
He literally sees it that way when he looks at it on a page.

581
00:34:27,049 --> 00:34:29,730
And you need to develop that same sense.

582
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:30,691
For me, it's a click.

583
00:34:31,171 --> 00:34:33,012
Like, when I know I've set the right value, it clicks.

584
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:37,015
This picture has nothing to do with anything.

585
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:37,735
I just thought it was awesome.

586
00:34:41,717 --> 00:34:44,219
So once you find these flow knobs, write them down.

587
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:47,861
Four shots per clip, zoom time, total ammo

588
00:34:47,941 --> 00:34:48,741
is enough to.

589
00:34:49,697 --> 00:34:50,637
Fight for an entire counter.

590
00:34:52,098 --> 00:34:53,259
You will want to change these later,

591
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,620
except under extreme circumstances.

592
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:57,942
Remember, once you leave this step, you don't want to backtrack.

593
00:35:00,303 --> 00:35:02,685
So know what you cannot change and then have the discipline not to change it.

594
00:35:02,705 --> 00:35:04,786
Once you find these flow knobs,

595
00:35:05,827 --> 00:35:06,267
crank them up.

596
00:35:06,748 --> 00:35:07,808
Crank them to all the way.

597
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:10,890
Sniper rifle is perfectly accurate.

598
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:12,491
It travels instantly.

599
00:35:12,951 --> 00:35:14,633
It zooms almost instantly.

600
00:35:14,653 --> 00:35:16,614
It always kills with a headshot.

601
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:19,899
don't go halfway with these flow knobs because

602
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,060
the more you loosen them up

603
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,881
the easier and more people are going to reach this flow state.

604
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:28,401
You're also going to notice the things that aren't

605
00:35:29,521 --> 00:35:30,821
allowing you to get in this flow state.

606
00:35:31,622 --> 00:35:35,062
If everything else is loose then the one thing that's tight you're going to notice it really easily.

607
00:35:35,082 --> 00:35:38,943
Alright, so you've got the flowing sniper rifle.

608
00:35:39,523 --> 00:35:40,323
It's fun by itself.

609
00:35:40,943 --> 00:35:42,284
It's probably really powerful.

610
00:35:42,304 --> 00:35:45,284
How do you put it together with other weapons?

611
00:35:45,738 --> 00:35:47,299
This one is for the engineers in the house.

612
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,060
I know you like to fix bugs last.

613
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,801
I know good coding practice is to optimize at the end.

614
00:35:54,061 --> 00:35:56,142
But you need to start doing it earlier,

615
00:35:56,202 --> 00:36:01,304
because it's impossible to balance without a solid build.

616
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,265
Write bug-free code.

617
00:36:04,325 --> 00:36:05,105
That's that easy, right?

618
00:36:07,146 --> 00:36:09,087
You need to fix the gameplay bugs right away.

619
00:36:09,107 --> 00:36:10,828
A lot of times, this isn't a priority.

620
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,729
You've got a bunch of features, probably features I asked for.

621
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:14,429
But.

622
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:20,293
I can't really do my job until there's enough bugs out of the way that I can get a sense

623
00:36:20,313 --> 00:36:22,454
for this balance and optimize.

624
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:28,316
Unless you're going to ship your game at sub-30, don't let your designers play sub-30.

625
00:36:29,096 --> 00:36:32,718
Get a special mode or test map or something where they can run the game.

626
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:37,559
And have good lighting, sounds and effects, and animations as early as you can.

627
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,941
There's this joke we kind of talk about where if we're going into a play test...

628
00:36:42,388 --> 00:36:45,289
we have to make sure that there's light maps, because if there's no light maps, people think

629
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:51,330
the AI is dumb. I don't know why. But it's true. It's like a 15 point difference. People

630
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:56,112
will think your AI is dumb if you don't have good light. And then sometimes placeholder

631
00:36:56,132 --> 00:37:00,613
errors are required. So strength. What does that mean? I'll put the slides up. It's okay.

632
00:37:04,494 --> 00:37:08,895
How does strength help you put all your weapons together? So Glabo, in another book, What

633
00:37:08,915 --> 00:37:09,915
the Dog Saw, talks about...

634
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,877
Why are there 50 kinds of mustard and only one kind of ketchup?

635
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,679
I don't know how he comes up with these topics. It's awesome.

636
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:22,384
So, he says, Heinz ketchup, the taste begins at the tip of the tongue,

637
00:37:22,704 --> 00:37:24,125
where you have sweet and salty receptors.

638
00:37:24,505 --> 00:37:27,688
It moves along the sides where you can taste sour the strongest.

639
00:37:27,968 --> 00:37:31,811
Then it hits the back of the tongue for umami and bitter in one long crescendo.

640
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:36,754
How many other things in the supermarket hit all of the kinds of taste that you can have?

641
00:37:37,435 --> 00:37:37,995
The answer is none.

642
00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:47,508
Heinz Ketchup, it's got all the flavors, they're all really strong flavors, and they're all

643
00:37:47,588 --> 00:37:50,349
perfectly balanced against each other.

644
00:37:50,429 --> 00:37:51,569
Tasters call this amplitude.

645
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:53,730
Halo is like ketchup.

646
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:56,810
It's everywhere.

647
00:37:57,951 --> 00:37:59,591
It's got a lot of flavors.

648
00:38:01,331 --> 00:38:04,892
You've got close range, you've got long range, you've got aiming, you've got running, vehicles,

649
00:38:04,932 --> 00:38:07,213
grenades, melees, just tons of flavors.

650
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:11,073
All of them are very strong, right?

651
00:38:11,913 --> 00:38:14,854
It's okay. It's not overwhelming because they're all the same strong.

652
00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:18,756
Designers call that balance, and it requires strength.

653
00:38:21,357 --> 00:38:25,199
One of the ways you can tell if something is strong is through affordance,

654
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:28,440
which is a visual clue, which is a function of an object.

655
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,902
Heidegger calls this ready to hand, which is a great phrase.

656
00:38:33,563 --> 00:38:35,824
This is where sci-fi games like Halo run into trouble.

657
00:38:36,284 --> 00:38:37,884
What does a proton phase amplifier do?

658
00:38:38,325 --> 00:38:39,525
I don't know. It's not affordant.

659
00:38:40,566 --> 00:38:41,246
You're not giving me a clue.

660
00:38:42,298 --> 00:38:44,480
If you have to explain a strength to people, it's not a strength.

661
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:49,143
Okay, this is a hardcore textbook, and it rocks.

662
00:38:49,723 --> 00:38:52,004
Like, it's dense, and it hurts you when it hits you.

663
00:38:52,024 --> 00:38:52,585
It kind of rocks.

664
00:38:53,345 --> 00:38:58,008
And I think probably there's a couple of the authors of this book in the audience.

665
00:38:59,509 --> 00:39:00,630
Buy it and read it. It's great.

666
00:39:02,211 --> 00:39:03,772
They define competence this way.

667
00:39:04,852 --> 00:39:08,275
It's a condition or quality of effectiveness, ability, sufficiency, or success.

668
00:39:09,207 --> 00:39:13,130
And they show through experimentation that it is a major human motivator.

669
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,672
People want to be competent. They want to show that they're competent.

670
00:39:15,692 --> 00:39:16,753
They want to feel competent.

671
00:39:19,135 --> 00:39:22,497
Sniping starts off hard, but the more you learn, the more competent you get.

672
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:23,999
Why is this important?

673
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,621
Strengths are things that you can get good at,

674
00:39:28,462 --> 00:39:33,326
and competence is an implicit motivator instead of an external motivator.

675
00:39:33,706 --> 00:39:34,247
So what's the difference?

676
00:39:35,848 --> 00:39:36,749
External motivators...

677
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,131
evaporate as soon as they're not there anymore.

678
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:41,011
So if somebody's paying you to play Halo,

679
00:39:41,031 --> 00:39:43,132
as soon as they stop paying you, you'll stop playing.

680
00:39:44,493 --> 00:39:46,794
On the other hand, internal motivation,

681
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:51,656
intrinsic motivation, the more you get of it,

682
00:39:51,676 --> 00:39:52,376
the more you want it.

683
00:39:52,536 --> 00:39:53,817
So the better you get at the sniper rifle,

684
00:39:53,837 --> 00:39:55,257
the more you want to play with the sniper rifle.

685
00:39:55,617 --> 00:39:57,078
And again, balance is longevity.

686
00:39:57,098 --> 00:39:59,339
So this is a great way to make your game have longevity.

687
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,500
There's so many of these screenshots

688
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,941
of Master Chiefs lifting Mordhawks.

689
00:40:04,021 --> 00:40:04,321
It's great.

690
00:40:05,923 --> 00:40:07,284
So how do you recognize strength when you see it?

691
00:40:07,384 --> 00:40:09,445
How do you train yourself to appreciate these strengths?

692
00:40:10,665 --> 00:40:13,206
People hate it when you change the sniper arrow on them.

693
00:40:13,606 --> 00:40:15,747
Just when I was getting good, they say, why?

694
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:16,987
Because it resets their confidence.

695
00:40:20,008 --> 00:40:21,369
But what you're trying to do is you're

696
00:40:21,429 --> 00:40:22,629
trying to prevent optimization.

697
00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:26,991
Brains are lazy, and they will optimize out

698
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:28,971
all of the interesting parts.

699
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:31,272
They won't stop you from thinking.

700
00:40:32,052 --> 00:40:33,773
Some people speculate this is what beginner's luck is.

701
00:40:34,227 --> 00:40:38,631
Like the first time you play darts, you're really focusing and you're calculating all

702
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:40,672
the wind variance and everything.

703
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:43,314
And then as you start to get used to it, your brain gets lazy.

704
00:40:43,334 --> 00:40:44,455
It's like, yeah, whatever, I can do this.

705
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:48,278
And you get worse, right, until you get the muscle memory and you get better again.

706
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,182
So the other reason why you want to change constantly is prevent inertia bias.

707
00:40:53,663 --> 00:40:54,523
That's the way it's always been.

708
00:40:55,984 --> 00:40:56,445
It's perfect.

709
00:40:56,565 --> 00:40:57,846
Why are the designers still making changes?

710
00:40:58,186 --> 00:40:58,847
We have a game to ship.

711
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:02,390
We could call this deadline bias, I guess.

712
00:41:04,773 --> 00:41:07,034
But you want to give them something different with every playtest.

713
00:41:07,054 --> 00:41:09,974
You don't want anybody to get used to the game how it is because it's going to change,

714
00:41:10,114 --> 00:41:10,895
especially in this stage.

715
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:12,815
You also want to change your passes.

716
00:41:13,315 --> 00:41:15,876
Lots of Halo weapons kill in one shot,

717
00:41:17,357 --> 00:41:19,137
and so strength is relative.

718
00:41:20,518 --> 00:41:22,458
It's only strong when it's compared to everything else.

719
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,319
And you'll find that things get weaker as time goes on,

720
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,060
so you want to go through all the weapons and start back at the beginning

721
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,741
and see if the first weapon is still as strong as what you made it.

722
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,045
If you can't make everything strong, you can't have anything strong.

723
00:41:36,886 --> 00:41:38,087
So it's kind of a good rule of thumb.

724
00:41:39,768 --> 00:41:41,008
This guy is really good at Halo.

725
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:43,029
I don't even know what button that is.

726
00:41:46,411 --> 00:41:49,453
Pro players often complain that the guys making decisions

727
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,254
about Halo suck at their own game.

728
00:41:51,914 --> 00:41:52,255
It's true.

729
00:41:53,015 --> 00:41:53,856
I'm not that good at Halo.

730
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:56,497
I'm really not that good at sniping.

731
00:41:57,898 --> 00:41:59,639
I'm not that good at anything in Halo,

732
00:41:59,979 --> 00:42:00,779
except driving a Warthog.

733
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,181
And I'm not that good on purpose.

734
00:42:04,808 --> 00:42:05,769
I like to think it's on purpose.

735
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,111
The problem is dopamine is not specific.

736
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,052
When you get dopamine, it feels good.

737
00:42:11,553 --> 00:42:12,233
Your body's saying,

738
00:42:12,853 --> 00:42:13,714
yes, keep doing that.

739
00:42:15,215 --> 00:42:16,316
Success feels good, too.

740
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:18,077
Success in the game

741
00:42:19,058 --> 00:42:19,838
gives you dopamine

742
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:22,800
just like success at balance in the game

743
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,541
gives you dopamine.

744
00:42:24,662 --> 00:42:24,862
So,

745
00:42:26,003 --> 00:42:26,723
if you're good at the game,

746
00:42:26,743 --> 00:42:27,704
you're going to think it's balance.

747
00:42:28,985 --> 00:42:29,505
And it might not be.

748
00:42:30,766 --> 00:42:32,007
You've got to keep your neurons plastic.

749
00:42:33,408 --> 00:42:34,068
Don't play too much.

750
00:42:35,273 --> 00:42:37,535
This goes back to competence. Competence is a great motivator.

751
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:40,097
If you play too much, you're going to get invested in your competence.

752
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:41,458
You're going to be one of those guys saying,

753
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:42,919
don't change the sniper rifle, it's perfect.

754
00:42:43,919 --> 00:42:45,741
Don't forget your paper designs.

755
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:47,922
You've got to constantly go back to, you know,

756
00:42:47,942 --> 00:42:49,083
what was my original intent here?

757
00:42:50,504 --> 00:42:51,325
And don't specialize.

758
00:42:52,045 --> 00:42:53,486
I love the Warthog, and I think it shows.

759
00:42:54,887 --> 00:42:56,408
It's my baby. It's my favorite.

760
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:00,031
But don't pick favorites if you can help it.

761
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:01,252
You're going to neglect everything else.

762
00:43:01,272 --> 00:43:03,193
You're going to spread yourself out.

763
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,181
So when is this not true?

764
00:43:07,902 --> 00:43:09,123
So when do you want to play a lot?

765
00:43:09,563 --> 00:43:11,364
Remember, you're trying to train your brain.

766
00:43:11,845 --> 00:43:15,607
So spend more time playing what does work than what doesn't

767
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:15,807
work.

768
00:43:16,467 --> 00:43:17,268
It's counterintuitive.

769
00:43:18,749 --> 00:43:19,609
It drives people crazy.

770
00:43:19,649 --> 00:43:21,611
I spend hours and hours driving the Warthog around

771
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:22,251
and it's fine.

772
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:25,053
And then I spend no time driving some other vehicle

773
00:43:25,073 --> 00:43:25,753
that's not fine.

774
00:43:25,913 --> 00:43:26,974
It's because I know it's not fine.

775
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,415
I don't want to imprint on that.

776
00:43:29,876 --> 00:43:32,217
I play a sniper rifle encounter over and over and over again.

777
00:43:32,598 --> 00:43:33,798
Once I know the sniper rifle is good.

778
00:43:34,364 --> 00:43:37,847
Or I find some game where it is good and I play it over and over again, because then I can recognize it.

779
00:43:39,648 --> 00:43:41,069
Once it works, you've got to get it stuck in your head.

780
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:48,556
Did you notice the strength is increasing as we get through these slides?

781
00:43:49,977 --> 00:43:50,658
Hard choices.

782
00:43:50,678 --> 00:43:54,641
Alright, producers, this is your most important slide. After this, you can leave if you want.

783
00:43:56,303 --> 00:43:57,163
This is an actual bug.

784
00:43:58,104 --> 00:44:00,266
Sniper rifle reload is too long. It's bug 12.

785
00:44:02,032 --> 00:44:04,793
We've been working on this game for like three days and somebody's already giving me feedback.

786
00:44:05,293 --> 00:44:08,394
In raid, as a bug, sniper rifle reload is too long.

787
00:44:09,675 --> 00:44:14,717
Don't let people file bugs against balance during this rough stage of balancing.

788
00:44:14,757 --> 00:44:17,518
In fact, don't let people file bugs against balance, period.

789
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:23,080
What'll happen is, you know, your brain likes to optimize, so instead of thinking about what should I do,

790
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,261
you think, what does this bug tracking program tell me I need to do?

791
00:44:27,461 --> 00:44:27,881
Don't do that.

792
00:44:30,746 --> 00:44:33,988
Listen to complaints. I'm not going to tell you don't listen to complaints, but really,

793
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:39,371
you know, they don't have a foundation yet, right? If anybody's going to have enough of

794
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:42,413
the game internalized to make complaints, it's going to be you. And you don't have it

795
00:44:42,693 --> 00:44:48,156
at this stage, so chances are nobody else is going to have it. So don't be reactive.

796
00:44:49,316 --> 00:44:53,899
Don't design by committee, or else you'll all end up shooting each other in a big circle.

797
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,061
Other hard choices.

798
00:45:00,538 --> 00:45:02,619
There are certain things about the sniper rifle that make it strong.

799
00:45:03,479 --> 00:45:05,160
Damage, distance, accuracy.

800
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,861
Once you have these things, write them down.

801
00:45:06,881 --> 00:45:08,401
It's just like fun knobs. You need to write them down,

802
00:45:08,421 --> 00:45:10,282
and then know which ones not to touch later.

803
00:45:10,302 --> 00:45:13,163
Because you don't want to backtrack. You don't want to make things weaker again.

804
00:45:14,224 --> 00:45:15,284
Don't change it once you know.

805
00:45:16,445 --> 00:45:20,387
Then once you have these strength knobs, you want to crank them to 11.

806
00:45:21,327 --> 00:45:22,668
Make everything overpowered.

807
00:45:23,508 --> 00:45:25,349
To sort of paraphrase the Incredibles,

808
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,350
if everything is overpowered, nothing is.

809
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:33,557
So you've got your flow knob set, you've got your strength knob set.

810
00:45:34,758 --> 00:45:35,819
Turn everything else to zero.

811
00:45:36,259 --> 00:45:39,301
If it's not important for flow and it's not important for strength, it's not important.

812
00:45:40,482 --> 00:45:43,584
You need to remove that complexity because it's just going to get in the way.

813
00:45:44,665 --> 00:45:46,947
You don't want to obscure the role that you initially decided on,

814
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:51,350
and anything other than those two are just, they're noise.

815
00:45:54,272 --> 00:45:57,274
We balanced the sniper rifle for most players. We've talked about this before.

816
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,960
Once you have things working in multiplayer,

817
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,600
it's pretty easy to retrofit single player.

818
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:05,521
You can make the AI accommodate in a bunch of different ways.

819
00:46:07,321 --> 00:46:09,662
Again, you cannot make things too powerful.

820
00:46:12,342 --> 00:46:15,583
So moving on, you go to the Polish Pass.

821
00:46:15,983 --> 00:46:17,403
How do you fine tune a sniper rifle?

822
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:21,744
The answer is not by giving it weaknesses.

823
00:46:22,704 --> 00:46:26,045
If you read a game preview, it'll say, oh, don't worry.

824
00:46:26,065 --> 00:46:27,385
The sniper rifle is not too powerful

825
00:46:27,405 --> 00:46:28,425
because it's got some.

826
00:46:29,178 --> 00:46:34,020
huge negative, like your head is ten times bigger when you're using it or something.

827
00:46:35,281 --> 00:46:39,243
You don't want to add weaknesses, right, because we already talked about why you want to make

828
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:43,485
things, everything overpowered. So what you have to do is you have to have limitations

829
00:46:44,265 --> 00:46:45,026
on that strength.

830
00:46:47,187 --> 00:46:50,709
There's been lots of talks about our playtest process. John Hobson gave a great one last

831
00:46:50,749 --> 00:46:56,171
year. It's online. You can look at it. But here's some quick points. Start before things

832
00:46:56,211 --> 00:46:56,471
settle.

833
00:46:56,945 --> 00:47:02,126
you know, somewhere toward late production, do it regularly, schedule, you want to have

834
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:06,467
a really quick build process, can't take longer than a couple of hours, so you can make a

835
00:47:06,507 --> 00:47:09,848
change in the morning, make the build, do the playtest in the afternoon.

836
00:47:11,688 --> 00:47:16,569
And don't tell people what's changed, because you don't want to bias them, you want their

837
00:47:16,589 --> 00:47:17,249
natural reaction.

838
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:23,793
focus groups, I don't like to call it that, but it's sort of a popular name.

839
00:47:23,813 --> 00:47:27,535
You want to get the feedback immediately while it's fresh for people. You actually want to

840
00:47:27,555 --> 00:47:30,817
you don't want to argue with them, right? But you want to kind of let them argue with each other.

841
00:47:31,418 --> 00:47:35,300
And don't spend any time talking about solutions. Get together with your designers

842
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,283
afterward, figure out the solutions. You don't even talk about it in a focus group.

843
00:47:41,744 --> 00:47:42,605
So, limitations.

844
00:47:44,526 --> 00:47:47,268
If your game becomes predictable, it probably

845
00:47:47,388 --> 00:47:48,189
probably means

846
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:54,474
that you need to limit strengths because there's something that's so powerful in so many situations

847
00:47:54,534 --> 00:47:55,574
that people are always using it.

848
00:47:56,335 --> 00:47:59,537
On the other hand, if your game is too random, that probably means your strengths are too

849
00:47:59,717 --> 00:48:04,720
narrow, and whoever happens to be in the right situation for the strength of their weapon

850
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,300
is going to win.

851
00:48:06,221 --> 00:48:07,622
There's nothing really that other people can do.

852
00:48:10,064 --> 00:48:15,267
Game theory tells us that the ratio of people playing a strategy is about the same as the

853
00:48:15,307 --> 00:48:16,428
ratio of their effectiveness.

854
00:48:17,747 --> 00:48:19,008
If you have a lot of people doing one thing,

855
00:48:19,068 --> 00:48:20,308
it probably means it's more effective.

856
00:48:23,889 --> 00:48:24,749
This is a really great slide.

857
00:48:24,789 --> 00:48:25,729
I skipped right past it.

858
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:28,490
Taking team feedback and not giving them

859
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,190
a boop to the face.

860
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:32,191
There are three kinds of feedback.

861
00:48:32,531 --> 00:48:33,872
The first one is very desirable.

862
00:48:33,992 --> 00:48:34,732
It's, I don't like this.

863
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:37,653
Everybody, everybody on your team

864
00:48:37,673 --> 00:48:38,853
should be telling you, I don't like this.

865
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:39,973
This is what I don't like.

866
00:48:39,993 --> 00:48:41,654
Or this is what I like.

867
00:48:41,754 --> 00:48:42,674
Usually, this is what I don't like.

868
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,755
There's an even better kind of feedback, which is thoughtful.

869
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:46,875
I don't like this because.

870
00:48:47,445 --> 00:48:53,069
I don't like this because it feels bad is even better than just I don't like this, but

871
00:48:53,089 --> 00:48:59,974
I don't like this because it makes it too long, the recovery is too long, it takes too

872
00:49:00,014 --> 00:49:04,097
long before I can acquire it and shoot again or whatever, as long as it's thoughtful.

873
00:49:05,117 --> 00:49:08,960
The undesirable feedback is you should change this to this, because they're not telling

874
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:14,624
you, they're telling you what they don't like, they're not prescribing how to fix it.

875
00:49:15,805 --> 00:49:19,908
Most of the people on your team really need to pay attention to what they don't like,

876
00:49:20,328 --> 00:49:22,350
but it's not their job to tell you how to fix it.

877
00:49:24,832 --> 00:49:27,814
And so you should, I mean, listen to them.

878
00:49:27,914 --> 00:49:31,197
Sometimes they have great ideas, but that shouldn't be your primary goal of like,

879
00:49:31,357 --> 00:49:32,418
please tell me how to fix this.

880
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:38,322
Trust their guts, but not necessarily their brains.

881
00:49:40,764 --> 00:49:41,505
What does feedback mean?

882
00:49:41,665 --> 00:49:43,226
What are people trying to tell you when they say they don't like it?

883
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,328
They're saying the game in my head is different than what I'm playing.

884
00:49:46,671 --> 00:49:48,393
So you gotta ask, what's the game in their head?

885
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:50,034
Is that the game that we're making?

886
00:49:50,175 --> 00:49:52,177
Is that the game we decided to make in pre-production?

887
00:49:53,818 --> 00:49:55,219
Even people with the wrong game in their head,

888
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:56,621
maybe they really like some other game,

889
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:58,883
or some other game came out, and they're really enamored with it right now.

890
00:49:59,383 --> 00:50:00,705
Even if they have a different game in their head,

891
00:50:00,745 --> 00:50:02,827
their feedback is still useful, but you gotta understand

892
00:50:03,227 --> 00:50:03,928
where it's coming from.

893
00:50:03,948 --> 00:50:06,370
And then you gotta watch out for development bias.

894
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:09,313
People know that all you have to do is go back to your desk

895
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,015
and change something, and it'll be different.

896
00:50:12,382 --> 00:50:16,826
So, they're much less likely to overcome the barriers to entry and get confident with something.

897
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:18,547
They're more likely to complain.

898
00:50:19,028 --> 00:50:22,330
But once you ship and it's burned onto a disk, people are much less likely.

899
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:23,972
They're much less sensitive.

900
00:50:25,033 --> 00:50:26,614
Much less likely to complain about stuff like that.

901
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:29,516
And I'm going to skip through the types of players.

902
00:50:30,898 --> 00:50:35,822
What you want to do is you want to figure out what kind of people are giving you the feedback.

903
00:50:36,422 --> 00:50:37,843
Figure out kind of what style they are.

904
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:45,400
If they're an optimizer and they're only using one weapon, it's probably overpowered. If they get,

905
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,761
you know, really angry really easily, then watch them, because as soon as they start to simmer,

906
00:50:49,781 --> 00:50:55,082
that's when you know something is disturbing their flow. We've got some guys, it doesn't matter

907
00:50:56,062 --> 00:50:59,703
what game type, it doesn't matter what the state of the balance is, they want to be a sniper,

908
00:50:59,763 --> 00:51:05,584
they want to be the guy that runs around with a shotgun and invisible. Let them role play,

909
00:51:05,744 --> 00:51:08,184
it's great. They're going to be trying the thing that nobody else is trying, because that's

910
00:51:08,204 --> 00:51:09,545
what makes them feel powerful.

911
00:51:11,792 --> 00:51:20,638
We had a guy in Halo 1, called him, not when he was around, your mom, because we would

912
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:23,901
say, hey, is this too hard to learn? Well, I don't know, let's see if your mom can get

913
00:51:23,941 --> 00:51:32,727
it. Yeah. True story. I used to balance easy by playing with my nose and nothing else.

914
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,569
Right? And this guy still couldn't beat it.

915
00:51:39,132 --> 00:51:39,752
Look for griefers.

916
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:46,538
If Nathan Walpole, I mean if Nathan, is having fun sniping, that means somebody else is crying.

917
00:51:48,399 --> 00:51:54,285
And then look for pros. These guys want everything to be perfectly predictable, they don't want anything to get in their way.

918
00:51:54,885 --> 00:52:01,891
And that can help indicate to you when there's too much randomness in your game and when there's not enough.

919
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:07,976
Don't spend all your time in a playtest playing. You want to watch the people that are playing differently than you.

920
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:13,377
But sometimes you need to let your head drive.

921
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,041
Wow, this is really good, but I think I'm going to have to skip it.

922
00:52:19,121 --> 00:52:25,666
Okay, so basically everybody has this thing in their head that tells them,

923
00:52:25,746 --> 00:52:29,008
oh, a million monkeys for a million years, that can make anything.

924
00:52:29,028 --> 00:52:29,829
That makes Shakespeare.

925
00:52:30,289 --> 00:52:31,250
It's totally not true.

926
00:52:32,771 --> 00:52:36,254
The Planck length is 10 to the negative 23 centimeters.

927
00:52:37,215 --> 00:52:38,836
The fastest speed is a speed of light, c.

928
00:52:39,352 --> 00:52:43,354
That means it takes less than 10 to the negative 43 seconds to travel any distance.

929
00:52:44,654 --> 00:52:46,995
There are 10 to 80 particles in the observable universe.

930
00:52:47,395 --> 00:52:50,736
Anything that's not observable means it can't affect us because that means we can't see it.

931
00:52:50,756 --> 00:52:54,297
That means light's not getting here, so we can discard anything that's not observable.

932
00:52:55,518 --> 00:52:57,498
And there's been 10 to the 16th seconds since the Big Bang.

933
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:02,420
So if you take the smallest distance in the fastest time,

934
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,702
times the number of discrete objects in the universe over the lifetime of the universe,

935
00:53:07,112 --> 00:53:09,573
you get 10 to the 139th possible events.

936
00:53:11,435 --> 00:53:15,358
That means 10 to the 139th conceivable trials.

937
00:53:16,939 --> 00:53:20,501
So this laptop has 100 keys, including capitals.

938
00:53:21,842 --> 00:53:24,945
This PowerPoint deck has 21,000 letters, including spaces.

939
00:53:26,326 --> 00:53:29,828
This talk has 10 to the 22,000 possible configurations.

940
00:53:31,049 --> 00:53:34,392
So if every particle in the universe was a monkey,

941
00:53:35,693 --> 00:53:35,773
and

942
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:38,795
Every possible event in the universe was a talk.

943
00:53:40,056 --> 00:53:41,317
And they started at the dawn of time.

944
00:53:43,018 --> 00:53:47,042
There's still only one out of 158 probability of this talk

945
00:53:47,062 --> 00:53:48,463
being created randomly.

946
00:53:49,223 --> 00:53:51,165
My point, don't rely on random changes.

947
00:53:51,465 --> 00:53:53,147
You're going to underestimate how long it's going to take you

948
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:55,229
to figure out anything by just changing things randomly.

949
00:53:55,249 --> 00:53:56,109
It's really tempting.

950
00:53:57,931 --> 00:53:59,232
You want to change physics over math.

951
00:53:59,832 --> 00:54:01,214
Players don't perceive math directly,

952
00:54:01,614 --> 00:54:03,636
so you're better off changing the rate of fire,

953
00:54:03,656 --> 00:54:04,677
which is something they can perceive.

954
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:09,064
than damage per shot. Or you want to fix the base damage, you don't want to add random

955
00:54:09,385 --> 00:54:14,766
variants in there. And again, players don't perceive averages, right? So you want to fix

956
00:54:15,206 --> 00:54:19,127
that instant snapshot, you don't want to fix it by changing it over time. It's really tempting

957
00:54:19,147 --> 00:54:24,308
to say, ah, the sniper rifle's too powerful, but we'll only give it six shots. So it's

958
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:28,429
not actually going to kill a larger percentage of the people. But people don't, they don't

959
00:54:28,449 --> 00:54:31,490
understand that, oh, well, that guy killed me five times, and luckily he can only kill

960
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:32,230
me one more time.

961
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,345
You need to balance what players can see.

962
00:54:37,546 --> 00:54:39,568
Be wary of fairness. It's not balance.

963
00:54:39,588 --> 00:54:44,431
You're going to have a temptation to go into symmetry,

964
00:54:46,432 --> 00:54:48,874
because that's fair, right? But Halo's not fair.

965
00:54:50,035 --> 00:54:50,975
Especially the sniper rifle.

966
00:54:51,596 --> 00:54:53,177
And on a small scale, that's fine.

967
00:54:54,678 --> 00:54:56,439
But you don't want to end up with Tic-Tac-Tie.

968
00:54:56,679 --> 00:54:57,560
That's bad game design.

969
00:54:59,021 --> 00:55:01,002
You want to polish off your edges in this stage.

970
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:04,591
All right, finally, with five minutes to go, we're at the detail.

971
00:55:05,671 --> 00:55:10,033
This is the point in development where we actually made the change from 0.5 to 0.7 seconds.

972
00:55:12,234 --> 00:55:15,215
The sniper rifle is overpowered. It's okay, remember, we made it that way.

973
00:55:15,235 --> 00:55:17,976
The problem is, it was making all the other weapons feel weak.

974
00:55:19,736 --> 00:55:24,618
The optimizers, those guys that, for some reason, they always find the perfect weapon to use,

975
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:31,081
were using it exclusively. The depth was gone. The game was simple. It became Halo colon snipers.

976
00:55:32,627 --> 00:55:37,830
And the role players who refuse to use sniper rifles, because that's not who they imagine themselves as, they're getting creeped.

977
00:55:39,691 --> 00:55:44,795
It's being used at close quarters. That's like directly opposed to the role that we intended in the paper design.

978
00:55:46,136 --> 00:55:54,882
So, it's outside of its role. It's bleeding into the other weapons roles, making them dominated.

979
00:55:56,503 --> 00:55:59,625
And it's contrary to all the effects and the expectations that we're setting.

980
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:03,505
thing has this giant scope on it and if you can use it at point-blank range.

981
00:56:04,946 --> 00:56:07,328
That's not what you'd expect, it's going to be what we call a newbie hammer.

982
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:14,433
And it had no effective counter-strategies, so the sniper could acquire you, zoom in on

983
00:56:14,453 --> 00:56:18,656
you, fire, hit you in the head, before you could even ping him with a battle rifle and

984
00:56:18,696 --> 00:56:19,396
pop him out of zoom.

985
00:56:20,837 --> 00:56:25,981
Even after a body shot, which is sort of a failure case for most snipers, you couldn't

986
00:56:26,181 --> 00:56:28,763
get back into cover, they were able to hit you right away.

987
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:35,701
And most importantly, this goes back to training your sense of balance.

988
00:56:36,221 --> 00:56:40,543
Every time I saw somebody use a sniper rifle, I got nervous. I got upset. I thought I was getting an ulcer.

989
00:56:40,923 --> 00:56:49,426
But really, it's just my neurons were sensing that something was clashing with their representation of the game.

990
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,066
And they weren't giving me dopamine.

991
00:56:53,047 --> 00:56:56,328
My internal model was wrong. My spidey sense was tingling.

992
00:56:56,788 --> 00:57:00,310
I was reaching out with my feelings. You know, all the classic lines.

993
00:57:02,254 --> 00:57:04,696
So use your sense of balance to feel when something is wrong.

994
00:57:04,716 --> 00:57:07,078
Because you're never going to figure it out

995
00:57:07,098 --> 00:57:10,940
by looking at graphs, looking at data.

996
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,042
You're not going to figure it out that way.

997
00:57:15,644 --> 00:57:16,604
So we decided to make a change.

998
00:57:17,485 --> 00:57:19,086
We knew we couldn't touch the strength knobs, right?

999
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,828
We can't change the damage, because that's

1000
00:57:21,848 --> 00:57:23,789
what makes the sniper rifle good,

1001
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:25,451
is that you can kill somebody in a headshot.

1002
00:57:25,471 --> 00:57:27,972
You can kill somebody in two shots to the body.

1003
00:57:28,373 --> 00:57:29,594
We couldn't shorten the range, because that's

1004
00:57:29,614 --> 00:57:31,355
what makes the sniper rifle the sniper rifle.

1005
00:57:31,395 --> 00:57:31,915
That's the rule.

1006
00:57:33,987 --> 00:57:36,528
It's really seductive to add weaknesses at this point.

1007
00:57:36,568 --> 00:57:37,629
I'm going to ask you not to do it.

1008
00:57:37,869 --> 00:57:38,269
Don't do it.

1009
00:57:38,729 --> 00:57:39,410
It'll ruin your game.

1010
00:57:40,951 --> 00:57:43,432
You can't add error to a sniper rifle, right,

1011
00:57:43,712 --> 00:57:44,853
under any circumstances.

1012
00:57:44,893 --> 00:57:47,634
It just makes it so it's not a sniper rifle anymore.

1013
00:57:47,694 --> 00:57:48,695
It's a sniper rifle but.

1014
00:57:51,296 --> 00:57:52,517
We couldn't remove the melee attack.

1015
00:57:53,618 --> 00:57:56,139
Couldn't give it some kind of confident sound

1016
00:57:56,159 --> 00:57:58,000
so everybody always knew where you were when you're sniping.

1017
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,421
We didn't want to make you move slower.

1018
00:58:01,173 --> 00:58:04,274
One of the big problems with adding weaknesses is that people will figure out ways to get

1019
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:04,634
around it.

1020
00:58:09,637 --> 00:58:11,317
So we have to touch the flow knobs.

1021
00:58:11,357 --> 00:58:15,139
Remember, we removed everything that wasn't a strength or a flow knob, and so if we can't

1022
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:18,280
touch the strength knobs, sometimes we have to mess around with the flow knobs.

1023
00:58:22,902 --> 00:58:27,705
Turns out cadence is sort of the most flexible flow knob, especially for the sniper rifle.

1024
00:58:27,745 --> 00:58:30,686
It's the most prominent part of the sniper rifle.

1025
00:58:31,567 --> 00:58:33,748
Flow is that rhythm you get into when you're sniping.

1026
00:58:33,948 --> 00:58:36,128
You know you're, I don't have to be on his head

1027
00:58:36,168 --> 00:58:38,129
until right now, because that's when they can shoot.

1028
00:58:39,169 --> 00:58:42,630
And it has a large impact on strength,

1029
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:45,610
but it's not a strength knob explicitly.

1030
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:48,731
You can make the sniper rifle fire slower,

1031
00:58:48,771 --> 00:58:51,931
and it doesn't actually change the core of the sniper rifle.

1032
00:58:51,991 --> 00:58:53,232
It just changes how effective it is.

1033
00:58:54,952 --> 00:58:56,652
So we're using our rational brain at this point.

1034
00:58:56,732 --> 00:58:58,893
Now, once we've used motion to figure out what's wrong,

1035
00:58:58,913 --> 00:59:01,113
we're using our rational brain to decide how to change.

1036
00:59:03,654 --> 00:59:04,735
And so we're going to limit the strengths.

1037
00:59:05,196 --> 00:59:08,278
We're going to figure out what change fixes the problem, what has the least impact.

1038
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:11,681
We considered changing the shots in the clip, but the problem is that

1039
00:59:12,281 --> 00:59:14,783
three shots is not usually enough to kill two people.

1040
00:59:15,404 --> 00:59:17,045
And what's going to happen is you're going to kill one guy

1041
00:59:17,165 --> 00:59:18,666
and you're really going to feel like you need to reload

1042
00:59:18,686 --> 00:59:20,948
because you only have one shot left, or maybe two.

1043
00:59:21,789 --> 00:59:22,189
Can't miss.

1044
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:25,452
We could have increased the length of the reload,

1045
00:59:26,292 --> 00:59:29,194
but it would have to be increased a lot to fix this problem,

1046
00:59:29,455 --> 00:59:30,936
and that felt like adding a weakness.

1047
00:59:32,624 --> 00:59:35,466
We did play around with changing the time to a full zoom.

1048
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:39,708
After you hit the button until you're fully zoomed,

1049
00:59:40,249 --> 00:59:42,190
it fixes the problem with acquisition speed.

1050
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:43,350
I can stick my head out, and by the time

1051
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:45,192
you finish zooming in, I can run back.

1052
00:59:45,692 --> 00:59:47,073
But it doesn't fix close range use.

1053
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:50,575
And it also encourages people to fire without zooming,

1054
00:59:50,595 --> 00:59:52,616
and that breaks the fantasy of being a sniper.

1055
00:59:54,097 --> 00:59:55,978
We tried making it so you couldn't get headshots

1056
00:59:55,998 --> 00:59:58,559
when you're unzoomed, but that really limits the strength.

1057
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,321
And that only fixes the close range problem.

1058
01:00:01,341 --> 01:00:01,962
It doesn't fix the.

1059
01:00:02,341 --> 01:00:04,682
the long-range acquisition speed problem.

1060
01:00:06,622 --> 01:00:10,363
We thought about limiting the maximum total ammo, but like I said before, that fixes the

1061
01:00:10,403 --> 01:00:13,464
average, it doesn't fix the instant, it doesn't make you feel any better when you get killed

1062
01:00:13,884 --> 01:00:16,085
that eventually the guy's going to run out of ammo.

1063
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:19,866
Hopefully he's not going to run out of ammo before you can kill him and take it back and

1064
01:00:19,926 --> 01:00:20,366
use it yourself.

1065
01:00:21,766 --> 01:00:23,227
So time between shots.

1066
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:30,929
It fixes the acquisition speed, because if you do miss, it takes a while before you can

1067
01:00:30,949 --> 01:00:31,229
shoot again.

1068
01:00:32,665 --> 01:00:36,627
and it fixes the close range because what was happening at close range was people just

1069
01:00:36,987 --> 01:00:40,569
pounding the trigger and shooting it like a shotgun almost, like trying to get as many

1070
01:00:40,589 --> 01:00:44,591
bullets out of it as possible. It's not a negative feedback loop, it prolongs the fight.

1071
01:00:44,611 --> 01:00:48,993
If somebody misses and I run back into cover, the fight is longer, it didn't end quicker.

1072
01:00:49,013 --> 01:00:56,576
So this is the one we chose. It was our choice, we've got to make it carefully. We changed

1073
01:00:56,596 --> 01:00:57,717
from 0.5 to 0.7 seconds. Don't make changes less than 10%.

1074
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:04,916
It's not a hard rule, but it's a good rule of thumb.

1075
01:01:05,197 --> 01:01:06,578
It's not going to have a noticeable effect.

1076
01:01:06,978 --> 01:01:08,259
And you can twiddle these numbers forever,

1077
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,621
and one game it'll work and one game it'll won't work.

1078
01:01:11,182 --> 01:01:12,343
You don't need to get that specific.

1079
01:01:12,603 --> 01:01:13,443
What you're trying to do is you're

1080
01:01:13,463 --> 01:01:15,665
trying to reduce the balance to the point

1081
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:18,067
where it's overcome by noise on the battlefield.

1082
01:01:19,508 --> 01:01:21,410
Try to overshoot and come back.

1083
01:01:22,531 --> 01:01:24,152
You want to make sure that this change actually

1084
01:01:24,192 --> 01:01:25,293
made a difference, right?

1085
01:01:25,453 --> 01:01:27,155
So you make a big change and then come back.

1086
01:01:28,336 --> 01:01:28,756
I'm almost done.

1087
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:30,529
And don't break the flow.

1088
01:01:30,589 --> 01:01:32,910
Anything higher than 0.7, we would have to change something else,

1089
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:34,191
because that just broke the flow too much.

1090
01:01:35,012 --> 01:01:36,112
So verify the change.

1091
01:01:37,033 --> 01:01:38,453
It's still overpowered. That's fine.

1092
01:01:38,493 --> 01:01:39,534
The other weapons don't feel weak.

1093
01:01:39,554 --> 01:01:41,895
The optimizers, they're doing other things now.

1094
01:01:43,476 --> 01:01:44,757
It's not being used at close quarters.

1095
01:01:45,937 --> 01:01:47,778
It's not a predictable outcome at long range.

1096
01:01:48,219 --> 01:01:49,599
Somebody's going to get back in the cover.

1097
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:52,241
And my emotional state is no longer nervous.

1098
01:01:52,301 --> 01:01:55,362
So you use both your brain and your gut to verify change

1099
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:58,264
into the sniper rifle is balanced.

1100
01:02:00,742 --> 01:02:02,184
And I'm gonna skip the very last section.

1101
01:02:02,704 --> 01:02:03,665
So thanks for coming to my talk.

1102
01:02:04,066 --> 01:02:04,246
Thank you.

1103
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:04,446
Thank you.

1104
01:02:04,466 --> 01:02:04,646
Thank you.

1105
01:02:05,728 --> 01:02:07,890
Thank you.

1106
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:09,632
Thank you.

1107
01:02:09,652 --> 01:02:09,852
Thank you.

1108
01:02:09,872 --> 01:02:10,052
Thank you.
