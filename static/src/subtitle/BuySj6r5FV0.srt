1
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:13,331
All right.

2
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:18,914
So this is respecting player fantasies and dating sims, and if you saw a game attached

3
00:00:18,954 --> 00:00:20,414
to this title, no, you didn't.

4
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:25,337
All right.

5
00:00:25,357 --> 00:00:26,037
Let's get started.

6
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:28,738
Who the hell am I?

7
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:37,540
My name is Betty. I'm an Aquarius, I'm single, and I'm always picking the wrong romance choice in a Bioware game.

8
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:44,382
I need to speak my truth. Varric is hot and I should be able to kiss him.

9
00:00:47,222 --> 00:00:48,223
We got a good crowd here today.

10
00:00:49,443 --> 00:00:56,665
So I've worked on quite a few projects. I got my start at Ubisoft where I worked on Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

11
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,160
I've also worked in the indie space.

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,621
I was a writer on Hardspace Shipwrecker.

13
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:14,124
I've been a teacher for Pixels Montreal, which is a program that teaches people to write

14
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:15,164
narratives for games.

15
00:01:15,324 --> 00:01:17,945
It gets their portfolios up.

16
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:20,165
It's a great networking exercise.

17
00:01:20,225 --> 00:01:21,125
It's a really great program.

18
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:25,327
I also contributed to the UBC game writing program online.

19
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:31,843
And then I worked on a game called Lovelink, which you may recognize, but no, you don't.

20
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:38,207
And currently I'm at a studio called Servios, which is located in Los Angeles and makes

21
00:01:38,268 --> 00:01:39,368
very cool VR games.

22
00:01:39,428 --> 00:01:39,849
Check it out.

23
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,770
All right.

24
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,612
Let's get to the talk while you're all here.

25
00:01:45,877 --> 00:01:48,900
So the purpose of this talk is, one,

26
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,845
determining your audience early and respect that audience.

27
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:56,027
You can't change audiences halfway through the game

28
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:59,210
unless your game really resonated with somebody

29
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,391
who wasn't supposed to.

30
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:02,853
I call this the My Little Pony syndrome.

31
00:02:06,124 --> 00:02:09,107
Next is identifying the player fantasy in your characters.

32
00:02:09,887 --> 00:02:12,530
And then how to course correct for a live audience.

33
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,332
For the sake of this talk, we're going to be talking

34
00:02:14,372 --> 00:02:15,613
about a live audience game.

35
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:20,338
And then finally, how to be creative within the genre of

36
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:22,660
this game, because sometimes it feels like everything's

37
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,083
been done, and the thing that you want to do really badly

38
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,945
has already been done, so what's the point anyway?

39
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:29,407
But stay tuned.

40
00:02:31,724 --> 00:02:34,006
All right, so we got a little content warning for this one.

41
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:37,008
Got some minor male nudity, some butts and abs,

42
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,751
as well as discussion of sex and sexuality.

43
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:43,634
So if you don't like that, I'll give you a moment to leave.

44
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:46,436
But I assume that you're all here because you like that.

45
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:54,442
So here's our hypothetical game, all art by me.

46
00:02:54,462 --> 00:02:58,966
There's over 16 endings, you guys.

47
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:03,165
This is hypothetical lover.

48
00:03:04,406 --> 00:03:05,547
So we've determined our game.

49
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:08,889
Next we've got to determine who the audience for this game is going to be.

50
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,595
So I've decided to pick heterosexual women, well predominantly heterosexual women aged

51
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:20,878
18 to 32 with bisexual women and gay men as our secondary audiences.

52
00:03:21,558 --> 00:03:25,041
So we're going to aim to hit this lovely demographic right here.

53
00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:31,683
Um, so we have to research, you know, we, we pick a demographic, we have to research.

54
00:03:31,703 --> 00:03:32,924
What is that demographic into?

55
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:37,589
So I used Google and I found out this is what they're into.

56
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:41,933
I don't know who this guy is.

57
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:43,935
The internet calls him daddy.

58
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,471
Please don't tell me his name.

59
00:03:50,193 --> 00:03:53,535
So there is a level of expectation

60
00:03:53,655 --> 00:03:55,876
of a certain type of physical attractiveness

61
00:03:56,516 --> 00:04:01,499
within the overall consumers of this game type

62
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:04,460
in this particular demographic.

63
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:13,445
So that's my long way of saying, apps, some butts, maybe

64
00:04:13,465 --> 00:04:14,185
a little bit of bulge.

65
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,510
If you're feeling saucy.

66
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:20,972
So we've got our game.

67
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:24,514
We've got our archetype.

68
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:27,076
We have the audience expectation.

69
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:30,037
So let's get moving on to coming up with a character.

70
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:34,920
So this is a heavy hitter.

71
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:47,048
He's very popular.

72
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:49,109
This is Randy.

73
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:55,054
So we're going to take a moment to really think about what

74
00:04:55,074 --> 00:04:56,715
the player fantasy is in here.

75
00:04:57,135 --> 00:05:01,218
What do heterosexual women, bisexual women, gay men,

76
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:05,481
ages 18 to 32, find appealing about the cowboy fantasy?

77
00:05:07,577 --> 00:05:09,059
So how do we find that out?

78
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,821
We've got to research, research, research, research.

79
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:14,243
These are all real book titles.

80
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:17,265
This is what I found when I Googled it.

81
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:22,089
I'm a big fan of branding the Virgin.

82
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:27,854
So based on the cowboy archetype,

83
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:32,818
we're going to have certain expectations of.

84
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:41,499
Being more of an outdoorsy person, rope play, loving horses.

85
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,084
It's a big, big among horse girls, I'm not going to lie.

86
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:51,192
As well as people who like a stoic man who works with his hands and likes to take his shirt off.

87
00:05:52,256 --> 00:05:55,357
You know, a real Matthew McConaughey pre-True Detective type.

88
00:05:57,698 --> 00:06:00,839
And, you know, you can do your research however you want.

89
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,980
You can post a thread on Twitter.

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,361
I use Google.

91
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:05,841
What do women like?

92
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:07,342
What do cowboys do?

93
00:06:07,362 --> 00:06:11,504
It hasn't set me wrong so far.

94
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:14,125
You know, this isn't high school.

95
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,045
You can use Wikipedia.

96
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:23,230
And so once you've gotten kind of a general idea from reading through Grumpy Cowboy and Branding the Virgin

97
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,115
and seeing kind of what the set pieces are, what the general narrative beats are,

98
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:34,218
what your players are going to expect from this character if they pick Randy,

99
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:38,881
then you get to work on Randy and what his story is going to be.

100
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:42,464
So, based on all of this...

101
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,032
Randy's kind to animals.

102
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:48,555
He works with his hands.

103
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:50,497
He's a bit of a service top.

104
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:51,659
He likes some role play.

105
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,182
Some rope play, rather.

106
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:56,565
Though I think he might be into role play as well.

107
00:06:56,605 --> 00:06:59,749
But it's very standard stuff, like sexy nurse.

108
00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:02,492
He doesn't know Dungeons and Dragons very well.

109
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:11,055
Um, so now that we've identified all of these tropes about cowboy characters,

110
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:17,159
um, we need to figure out like, I mean, what he's like to talk to, because yeah,

111
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,703
someone can be into rope play and animals, but like, did they text a lot?

112
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:26,305
Did they, you know, did they get along with their parents?

113
00:07:26,685 --> 00:07:28,766
These are important things that you need to think about when you're coming up

114
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:32,629
with a character for anything, let alone a character for a romance.

115
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:40,549
And once we kind of find what really fascinates us narratively about this character,

116
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:42,289
that's what I like to call the narrative seed.

117
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,790
And I've made a cool little diagram about this.

118
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:51,612
So, the narrative seed kind of, it has two very important things,

119
00:07:51,652 --> 00:07:55,693
which is what excites the writer and what the writer wants to excite the player with.

120
00:07:56,722 --> 00:08:00,325
So, while we start out with a basic idea, a basic design of the character,

121
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:05,110
we need to move forward with what the narrative is going to be and what the narrative is going to be about.

122
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:11,375
In the case of Randy, you know, there are several directions that you could go.

123
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:16,893
You could say that he lives on a ranch, but the ranch is in financial trouble.

124
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:18,694
The bank's trying to take the ranch away.

125
00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:22,999
And now all of this romance that you have is fraught, and it's involved with, you know,

126
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:26,362
we got those money problems, we gotta rustle up some money.

127
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,656
Sometimes it might be about animals, you know.

128
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:36,920
He runs a horse rescue and there's this one horse that's just, you know, it's the

129
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,902
most strong, intense horse he's ever met.

130
00:08:38,942 --> 00:08:40,583
It's just been impossible to get its trust.

131
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,885
But you, player, you have a magic touch with this horse.

132
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:47,228
I call this the horse girl narrative.

133
00:08:49,477 --> 00:08:51,259
You know, you can come up with a number of things.

134
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:56,543
Randy is a staunch environmentalist because he loves the land so much

135
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,384
and he hates oil so much.

136
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:02,507
And there's a big oil field that's being built right next to his ranch

137
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:06,370
that's going to ruin the lives of him and his chickens and all of that.

138
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,252
And then the story becomes about that.

139
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:11,054
So that's your narrative seed

140
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:14,836
and the way that it grows into a beautiful narrative, a beautiful story.

141
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:20,302
So from there, once we figured out what our story is going to be,

142
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:22,183
once we figured out our archetypes for Randy,

143
00:09:22,203 --> 00:09:26,925
we can come up with a bit more of a love profile for Randy.

144
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:28,506
So we figure out what his love language is.

145
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:30,767
He's a quality time and acts of service guy.

146
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:33,708
He likes to spend time looking at the sunset with you.

147
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,729
He's a real fan of sourdough starters, so he likes to bring you bread.

148
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,350
That's his act of service.

149
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:41,711
He doesn't really...

150
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:46,173
He doesn't like to text. He's not a phone guy.

151
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:48,314
It can be really infuriating, because he'll be like,

152
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:49,855
Randy, where are we meeting for dinner?

153
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,022
And he replies in like 10 hours, right before you're supposed to be there.

154
00:09:55,782 --> 00:09:57,163
Randy, be more considerate, please.

155
00:09:58,303 --> 00:10:04,286
Um, he's shy around people, but he's, you know, a lot more active around animals.

156
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:05,226
He's a lot more talkative.

157
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:07,207
He talks to his pigs, his cows, his chickens.

158
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:11,309
Um, and as I said, he loves baked goods.

159
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:12,449
He's a big fan of musicals.

160
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:18,912
As you saw, he loves Oklahoma and he lost his parents at a young age, perhaps to an oil baron.

161
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:24,293
You know, it's our collaborative story.

162
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:24,874
We'll find out.

163
00:10:25,976 --> 00:10:27,118
Maybe they were killed by vampires.

164
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:27,558
I'm not sure.

165
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:36,250
So we release Randy's series as a set of episodes.

166
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,551
We're going to call them episodes for this.

167
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:41,594
We're going to say that it's a season because this is a live service game.

168
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:45,157
And so Randy is performing really well on the first few episodes,

169
00:10:45,217 --> 00:10:49,801
but there seems to be an extreme drop-off around episode 3, episode 4.

170
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:51,662
And there's a problem, you know...

171
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:55,946
That's a flop, that's a problem, because this is a very well-performing character.

172
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:57,508
He's one of our all-stars.

173
00:10:58,008 --> 00:11:00,791
People love Randy, but they don't love this episode of Randy,

174
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:02,472
and we need to find out what the problem is there.

175
00:11:04,815 --> 00:11:08,078
So, this is the real bread and butter here, folks.

176
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:11,200
This is tried and true, tested information.

177
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,382
So if you're going to take notes of one slide, this is the one.

178
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:20,044
So, what players do not want, and you've got to think about yourself as players too,

179
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,927
and even just as consumers of media, what stuff really drives you nuts.

180
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:26,189
And you'll find it there.

181
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,293
So, a character who needs the player to solve all their problems.

182
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:32,314
Players are playing this for their own escape.

183
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:37,098
They're not playing this to feel like they're the therapist to Randy.

184
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:41,609
You know, they want a man who can take care of himself, a person who can take care of

185
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:46,610
themself, a person who's looking after their needs, because as the player, this is their

186
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,651
vacation from their lives.

187
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:53,412
And whatever their life is, if it's messy, stressful, whatever, we've all got stuff going

188
00:11:53,552 --> 00:11:56,553
on and we all play video games to make that a little bit easier.

189
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:01,654
The second thing is very similar to the first thing, but a character who doesn't pay enough

190
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:02,734
attention to the player.

191
00:12:02,774 --> 00:12:05,015
If you feel like you have to chase around a fictional man.

192
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:16,531
The third one, this one's a bit heavier, which is a sexual encounter without player consent.

193
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:19,233
And this is something that used to be a bit more of a problem with older games.

194
00:12:20,294 --> 00:12:25,798
People are getting more aware of this, but basically gating any sexual encounter with,

195
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:29,762
hey, there are butts in this. Warning. If your parents are in the room,

196
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:33,685
they'll probably walk in just the moment that there's a bare ass on your screen.

197
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:39,112
Because people might even be down to like having a sexual fun time with Randy,

198
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:42,497
but they might also be on the bus sitting next to a child.

199
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,565
So having the option to say thanks, but maybe later, very important.

200
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:53,468
Disregard for established canon, you know, if you want to get Reddit really mad.

201
00:12:54,809 --> 00:13:01,612
If you want to get any fan really mad, you know, for example, with Randy, we established that his favorite musical is Oklahoma in episode one.

202
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:07,835
What if in episode five, or problem episode, episode three, he says that Chicago is his favorite?

203
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:11,017
Randy, what is the truth?

204
00:13:13,915 --> 00:13:15,796
Love triangles are an iffy one.

205
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:18,378
Some people love them, some people not a huge fan.

206
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,740
A lot of us who grew up in a certain time period

207
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,341
are tired of having them shoved down our throats.

208
00:13:24,342 --> 00:13:26,664
And so in the case of love triangles,

209
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:29,606
you really got to telegraph that early

210
00:13:30,206 --> 00:13:32,067
because if season two begins and it's like,

211
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:36,751
hello, my name is Paolo and I am your other amour.

212
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:39,332
And you're like, man, I'm just trying to hang out with Randy.

213
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:40,293
Can you go away?

214
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,314
No, I am here for the whole season.

215
00:13:48,058 --> 00:13:53,763
Whereas people who know, you know, they see the book cover with both Randy and Paolo holding

216
00:13:53,843 --> 00:13:54,463
on to the player.

217
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:56,645
It's like, okay, so there's going to be a love interest up in this.

218
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,006
Let me get ready.

219
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:03,410
And then the last one is subverted expectations, which is...

220
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:08,003
Why I joked about vampires, but we'll be bringing it up.

221
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:10,328
So a vampire storyline in a cowboy romance.

222
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:12,752
You got to, you also got to telegraph this.

223
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:15,597
If your cowboy character is suddenly going to have to deal with vampires.

224
00:14:16,427 --> 00:14:21,050
You know, people who are setting themselves up for a nice romantic walk with Matthew McConaughey

225
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:25,713
are not expecting to turn around a corner and find Buffy and Spike standing there.

226
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:30,016
It's not the kind of crossover that people are looking for in this genre.

227
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:34,539
Unless, you know, you're making Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny the dating game.

228
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:42,944
Yeah, so now that we've looked at all of this, I'm going to give us a little bit of a pop

229
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:44,065
quiz with this next slide.

230
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:47,159
So here's the scene.

231
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:01,990
What do you guys think is the cause of the player friction in this sequence?

232
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:07,794
This person in the front here wearing the Wolverine shirt.

233
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,749
I think it says Wolverine.

234
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:10,789
I'm so sorry if it doesn't.

235
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:11,769
Oh, UC Irvine.

236
00:15:11,849 --> 00:15:12,249
I can read!

237
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:14,590
It doesn't feel like something the actual person would say, or like actually move back

238
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:14,930
in real life.

239
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:15,610
It feels like...

240
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:20,271
Okay, Randy's feeling a little out of character.

241
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:26,492
Yeah, I feel like...

242
00:15:26,512 --> 00:15:29,193
It feels like the writer's trying to be considerate.

243
00:15:29,213 --> 00:15:34,674
It feels like the writer's trying to be considerate.

244
00:15:42,313 --> 00:15:46,255
But the way they're going about it is actively part of their dreams of the character.

245
00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:14,550
That's correct. This is an ungated sexual encounter.

246
00:16:15,071 --> 00:16:17,457
So I got a little switchy here.

247
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:25,782
There's going to be so many Barbie dolls smacking against each other.

248
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:35,190
So players didn't, you know, following up on this answer, Randy, as we said,

249
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,551
is someone who's a little bit shy.

250
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:39,954
So giving him a sex scene this early on in the season might feel a little,

251
00:16:39,974 --> 00:16:43,297
a lot of character for players who are looking for a slow burn.

252
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:51,518
Texas man romance. Whereas it's also just like, you know, somebody's on the bus and then 2D butt all

253
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:56,481
over their screen while they're sitting next to, I don't know, a pastor and it's just, it's very alienating.

254
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:03,845
So now we're, now we're in fix-it mode. How do we fix it and do we fix it? Because

255
00:17:04,585 --> 00:17:08,768
these two things are connected. Sometimes if it's just a little bit of blip.

256
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:10,506
You just leave it.

257
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:14,487
But we've got to consider how popular is this character

258
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:15,408
with the fan base.

259
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,809
In the case of Randy, he's one of our top performers.

260
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,610
He's top three, let's say.

261
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,752
And keeping his fan base happy and continuing

262
00:17:24,832 --> 00:17:26,533
is part of what keeps the game going.

263
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:28,954
So we pay more attention to Randy

264
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:31,355
than we would, say, somebody who's less popular.

265
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:34,796
And how do we find out how the fan base is reacting to this?

266
00:17:34,876 --> 00:17:37,698
Well, there's lots of ways to get that feedback.

267
00:17:37,738 --> 00:17:39,058
You can check message boards.

268
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,412
user metrics, feedback, you know, communities, all that sort of thing.

269
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:48,895
And then the next thing you have to think about is how easy is the fix?

270
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:54,718
So if it's, in this case, just one scene of one episode where we put a sensuality gate,

271
00:17:55,499 --> 00:17:59,461
that's an easy fix. That's something that we can get patched in a day, maybe two.

272
00:18:00,741 --> 00:18:04,504
If, as I joked earlier, with Paolo being there for the entire season,

273
00:18:04,564 --> 00:18:07,445
that's not something you can patch. That's just something fans are going to have to live with.

274
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,882
And then, you know, the last thing is, are the fans being reasonable?

275
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:16,945
Because players are very passionate and we appreciate their passion.

276
00:18:17,585 --> 00:18:21,468
But sometimes, you know, they might get a little bit irritated

277
00:18:21,528 --> 00:18:23,729
because a character's wearing the wrong colored boxers.

278
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,831
And it's like, okay guys, we love you.

279
00:18:27,772 --> 00:18:29,333
We respect you. Enough.

280
00:18:33,457 --> 00:18:36,358
With that in mind, how do we stay creative?

281
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:37,999
We're going to pivot to Dino.

282
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,541
He's not a top earner.

283
00:18:49,106 --> 00:18:50,807
But he's unique, and we love him.

284
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:56,770
Dino has a small, very passionate fanbase,

285
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,572
and a writer who he's very passionate about.

286
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:03,194
and who Dino is as a person.

287
00:19:03,214 --> 00:19:05,640
Because, yeah, he is a dino furry,

288
00:19:06,182 --> 00:19:08,087
but he also has a literature degree.

289
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:21,323
And this is a case where we need to, again, look back to who our main audience for this game is.

290
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:26,545
And so in the case of Dino, he's in the game. Hypothetical lover is kind of...

291
00:19:27,345 --> 00:19:33,247
It's for the Facebook crowd, you know? It's for people who aren't your average internet-savvy meme queens.

292
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,208
So that's why Dino isn't doing so popular.

293
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:39,009
I feel like Dino would be pulling more numbers if he was in one of these games.

294
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,213
And, like, this is a perfectly great way to make a dating sim.

295
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:49,115
Don't get me wrong, but there is, you know,

296
00:19:49,996 --> 00:19:53,018
you're giving people what they want on the cover

297
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,319
so they know what to expect.

298
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,181
This is still following all of the lessons

299
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:59,083
that we've learned before, which is that if they buy a game

300
00:19:59,123 --> 00:20:02,166
with a bunch of birds on it, and that

301
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:03,987
means they're cool with kissing birds,

302
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:05,648
or at the very least intrigued.

303
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:11,890
Um, whereas if they buy the game that I've created,

304
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:14,912
Hypothetical Boyfriend, and there's a bird kissing scene,

305
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:18,593
they're like, I was promised hot boys, actually.

306
00:20:19,354 --> 00:20:21,355
I'm not sure where this bird thing came in.

307
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:27,457
Um, and you know, these are, these are all incredibly great,

308
00:20:27,537 --> 00:20:29,198
valid ways of making a dating sim.

309
00:20:29,218 --> 00:20:31,239
These are just all things you have to think about when you're making one.

310
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,322
But once you've gained your player's attention,

311
00:20:35,342 --> 00:20:39,906
the best way to keep it is by being genuine and heartfelt.

312
00:20:39,986 --> 00:20:44,891
So from silly game to more basic game, regardless,

313
00:20:44,931 --> 00:20:47,092
the players are going to love it if you put your effort

314
00:20:47,132 --> 00:20:48,093
and your heart into it.

315
00:20:49,254 --> 00:20:52,557
And that's where we get to the hard truths and the hard truths,

316
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:53,798
which is.

317
00:20:55,015 --> 00:21:01,157
Knowing what your audience wants and catering to it is success, but offering them something

318
00:21:01,197 --> 00:21:02,458
new may open up new interests.

319
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:08,240
So people who previously would have written Dino off have had the game hypothetical boyfriend

320
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,022
for about three months now and they're waiting for the new update of Randy and Joseph and

321
00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:17,184
Adam, but you know, they've never played Dino before.

322
00:21:18,424 --> 00:21:20,485
Well, he isn't a Proust.

323
00:21:21,745 --> 00:21:22,546
And then suddenly...

324
00:21:25,413 --> 00:21:28,254
Suddenly you've got a hardcore Dino fan in the making.

325
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:32,516
So basic designs and archetypes will always be the most popular,

326
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:38,239
which is to say, unfortunately, white, blonde hunks do the highest numbers.

327
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:39,620
I wish that it was different.

328
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:45,063
But fun writing can bring in wary players.

329
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,684
So, like, you know, you'll get the most swipes, the most...

330
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:53,586
engagement with the characters that fit into the archetypes that are the most sexualized,

331
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:55,066
the most kinkified, if you will.

332
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:59,447
But if people are playing it and they're engaging in the community and they hear about this

333
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:03,648
new character who really isn't their type but is super fun, got a really interesting

334
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:07,069
story, really fun story, they might begin engaging with that as well.

335
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:11,430
It's not something that they would be typically into, but fun writing does a lot.

336
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:18,912
And then the final point is basic character archetypes can include gender-bending twists,

337
00:22:19,492 --> 00:22:22,093
but you need to foreshadow it in the promotional material.

338
00:22:22,493 --> 00:22:25,733
This is the vampire storyline in the Randy storyline.

339
00:22:25,894 --> 00:22:31,235
So if you're going to have vampires and cowboys, I love it, we love it, it's a great idea,

340
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:33,135
you've got to include it on a cover.

341
00:22:33,995 --> 00:22:35,835
Or at the very least have Randy be like,

342
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:40,776
oh man, I've been stocking up on garlic and silver, something fierce.

343
00:22:42,022 --> 00:22:46,589
Someone keeps biting my cows, and I don't think it's El Chupacabra.

344
00:22:49,573 --> 00:22:51,615
So as we're getting to the end here, to recap,

345
00:22:52,597 --> 00:22:53,778
one, you've got to find your audience.

346
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:55,901
Two, you've got to find your fantasy.

347
00:22:56,777 --> 00:23:00,361
Three, you've got to know how to fix that fantasy if it's not hitting the right marks.

348
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:07,468
And lastly, have fun and write the romance that only you can share, because everybody's

349
00:23:07,528 --> 00:23:12,654
got a love story in their heart somewhere, and everybody should share it.

350
00:23:13,514 --> 00:23:13,715
Thank you.

351
00:23:24,223 --> 00:23:25,644
I think we're pretty close to time.

352
00:23:25,664 --> 00:23:28,166
I think we've got about five minutes, if I'm checking in.

353
00:23:29,466 --> 00:23:33,028
So I have time for a little bit of answering questions.

354
00:23:33,188 --> 00:23:35,670
But after that, I'll be in the area

355
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,090
if you have additional that you want to ask me.

356
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,032
I think I'm seeing a person over here with a green jacket

357
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,273
that they keep raising their hand.

358
00:23:42,653 --> 00:23:43,454
Oh, wait, do we not use the?

359
00:23:43,474 --> 00:23:44,394
Oh, no, they're sewing.

360
00:23:44,434 --> 00:23:44,955
I'm so sorry.

361
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:46,676
Do we not use this thing?

362
00:23:48,056 --> 00:23:49,417
No.

363
00:23:50,157 --> 00:23:50,337
All right.

364
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:50,578
Yes.

365
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:52,873
Does this thing work? Hello, hi.

366
00:23:52,953 --> 00:23:58,115
Yeah, so I was really curious about the subverting expectations and not hiding it on the cover.

367
00:23:59,736 --> 00:24:03,778
So, I think there was a couple of years ago, there was a game that came out called Doki Doki Literature Club,

368
00:24:04,218 --> 00:24:09,881
and that whole game, like, it hides what it is in like the first 15 minutes,

369
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:15,223
and then, but everyone loves it because like it's, you know, not spoilers, but like it does other stuff after that.

370
00:24:15,243 --> 00:24:16,143
I have a question for you.

371
00:24:16,284 --> 00:24:16,484
Yes.

372
00:24:17,204 --> 00:24:19,985
Did you buy that game because you heard other people talking about the writing?

373
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,151
Yeah?

374
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:22,091
There we go.

375
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:23,352
Ah.

376
00:24:24,894 --> 00:24:27,796
People wouldn't have bought it if they hadn't heard the word of mouth.

377
00:24:28,096 --> 00:24:30,218
The expectations of version is great.

378
00:24:30,258 --> 00:24:30,838
It's a great game.

379
00:24:30,878 --> 00:24:31,399
I've played it.

380
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:36,723
But that's a game that relies heavily on word of mouth and a lot of the topics that

381
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:37,483
we touched on today.

382
00:24:37,604 --> 00:24:39,085
So that's a great example.

383
00:24:39,105 --> 00:24:39,685
Thank you very much.

384
00:24:40,886 --> 00:24:41,266
Over here.

385
00:24:41,286 --> 00:24:42,447
Hey.

386
00:24:43,568 --> 00:24:43,969
Which one?

387
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:46,551
I can, I can.

388
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:47,852
Whichever one of you.

389
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:49,273
Rock, paper, scissors on the microphone.

390
00:24:49,293 --> 00:24:49,873
All right.

391
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:52,426
Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.

392
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:08,330
So I was curious in how you incorporate player choice in the narrative because it seems like

393
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:13,033
you were mostly talking about like a mostly linear narrative with not a lot of branching

394
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:13,454
paths.

395
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:21,400
Like, do you have anything, like, how would you approach, like what kind of choices would

396
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,743
you give the player if you were doing a branching narrative game?

397
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,269
This is a great question.

398
00:25:27,629 --> 00:25:29,551
And my experience in this type of game

399
00:25:29,591 --> 00:25:31,011
does involve branching narrative.

400
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,853
I just didn't cover it much today,

401
00:25:32,873 --> 00:25:35,274
because I was focusing more on player fantasy.

402
00:25:35,754 --> 00:25:37,956
So stuff that I would, you know, conversations

403
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,537
are a great place to include branching.

404
00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:41,958
You know, what do you want to ask Randy about his cows,

405
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,139
his chickens, his horses?

406
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:48,042
How do you want to respond to Randy's great questions

407
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:49,422
and thoughts about life in the universe?

408
00:25:49,463 --> 00:25:50,563
We really want the player to feel

409
00:25:50,603 --> 00:25:52,885
like this is a mutual relationship of getting

410
00:25:52,925 --> 00:25:53,565
to know each other.

411
00:25:54,706 --> 00:25:58,468
Another great place to include player choice is avatar customization,

412
00:25:58,488 --> 00:26:02,330
because everybody wants to be a cute little doll hanging out with these hot boys.

413
00:26:04,692 --> 00:26:08,054
I'm gonna move on to this question, because I'm trying to keep my answers short.

414
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:09,194
Thank you, though.

415
00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:12,156
I was wondering if you had anything to say on, like,

416
00:26:12,216 --> 00:26:15,859
how dating sim elements have been incorporated into different genres,

417
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:20,621
because it seems like it's harder to sell what the fantasy is on the cover

418
00:26:20,802 --> 00:26:23,883
if it's just one element of, like, a broader game.

419
00:26:24,593 --> 00:26:31,422
It can be very difficult because dating sims can be such complex games themselves

420
00:26:31,863 --> 00:26:36,509
that trying to incorporate them as a mini-game is a great place to have scope bloat

421
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:37,971
followed by scope cutting.

422
00:26:38,571 --> 00:26:42,396
And that's why in a lot of games that include romance elements that...

423
00:26:42,857 --> 00:26:46,798
You really want to have a fully realized romantic relationship with a character,

424
00:26:46,878 --> 00:26:49,899
but you're limited to three dates and a sex scene,

425
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:52,820
because that's just what's within the scope.

426
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,781
And so that's something that you need to think about really early on,

427
00:26:56,201 --> 00:26:59,942
and try not to blue-sky, try to red-sky that early on,

428
00:26:59,982 --> 00:27:02,683
and be like, okay, what's the least thing that we can ship,

429
00:27:02,743 --> 00:27:03,783
and are we happy with that?

430
00:27:03,843 --> 00:27:05,864
Because if we're not, let's not include it.

431
00:27:07,257 --> 00:27:08,258
Yes, Kirbycat.

432
00:27:08,398 --> 00:27:09,239
Hello, yes.

433
00:27:10,139 --> 00:27:13,122
My question was outside of writing,

434
00:27:13,262 --> 00:27:15,123
how do you still make,

435
00:27:15,143 --> 00:27:17,405
how do you still enhance archetypes

436
00:27:17,465 --> 00:27:18,566
that are similar to players

437
00:27:18,606 --> 00:27:20,327
but still have your own unique spin on it

438
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:21,608
so you're true to your own fantasy?

439
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,652
For me, it's always about real people.

440
00:27:26,032 --> 00:27:28,514
That's, I mean, and that sounds over simple,

441
00:27:28,554 --> 00:27:32,057
but like everyone can have an idea of what a cowboy is,

442
00:27:32,097 --> 00:27:35,059
but part of the research too is like finding out that like,

443
00:27:35,718 --> 00:27:41,120
Randy really hates mornings because, you know, it reminds him of his parents' death, or he

444
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,061
just likes to sleep in.

445
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:47,643
But, um, that too, one of those two things.

446
00:27:48,423 --> 00:27:50,424
But because he works on a farm, he has to.

447
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:54,706
And then that just creates a better place for human connection because haha, I do that.

448
00:27:58,608 --> 00:27:59,549
Thank you very much.

449
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:04,012
I think that's the last of our questions, and that's great because we're at time.

450
00:28:04,232 --> 00:28:06,534
So thanks so much for coming out today, everybody.
