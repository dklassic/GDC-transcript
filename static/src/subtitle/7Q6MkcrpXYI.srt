00:00:05,614 --> 00:00:34,407
Good evening. It's 5.30, so we should get started. Thank you for coming to the last session of the day. I really do appreciate it. A couple of reminders first. Set your phone to vibrate. You'll be receiving your evaluation over email, so please remember to fill that out. And if you have questions, they'll probably be pushing us out because this is the very end of the day, so there's a wrap-up room or wrap-up corral that's right across there so I can

2
00:00:35,037 --> 00:00:42,985
answer any particular questions that you have. My name is Mia Consolvo and I'm going to be

3
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:50,012
talking about a practical guide to doing ethical player testing. Why should you listen to

4
00:00:50,032 --> 00:00:55,858
me? I've been studying game players for about the past 17 years now. I've been studying

5
00:00:57,627 --> 00:01:00,228
And I've used a variety of methods to do that.

6
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:04,992
I'm mostly interested in who plays, why they play,

7
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:09,515
and how player culture adapts and evolves over time.

8
00:01:10,315 --> 00:01:12,236
And so I've been getting at that

9
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:14,318
mostly from a qualitative perspective,

10
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:16,359
so a lot of observation,

11
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,541
both participant and non-participant observation.

12
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:22,363
I do a lot of interviews and focus groups.

13
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:29,450
And I've done a bit of survey research, but I don't get so much into experiments and big

14
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,251
data analytics.

15
00:01:31,914 --> 00:01:35,256
Over time, I've investigated a number of different things

16
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:36,537
and with respect to players.

17
00:01:36,717 --> 00:01:39,459
So my first book was about cheating in games

18
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:42,221
and how and why people cheated, how they defined it,

19
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,642
what they did or didn't do

20
00:01:43,722 --> 00:01:45,103
according to their own definitions.

21
00:01:45,944 --> 00:01:49,947
I've looked at a casual MMO that was online

22
00:01:49,987 --> 00:01:52,068
for a short period of time called Faunosphere.

23
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:54,770
Most of the players were older women

24
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,533
and so there was an interesting dynamic going on there.

25
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:10,082
And my most recent book is Atari to Zelda, which is about Japanese video games and what happens as they travel to the West, including how Western players take them up and make sense of them.

26
00:02:10,783 --> 00:02:23,433
So I teach at Concordia University, which is in Montreal, and I run the M Lab, where we play games, we study games, we study players, and we try and innovate in better methods for studying play.

27
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,811
So what I want to do during this time is give you,

28
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:30,991
and I wasn't going to include the first point,

29
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:33,432
but the track administrator said,

30
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:35,492
we really want a history of how this evolves.

31
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:36,192
I was like, okay.

32
00:02:36,593 --> 00:02:39,353
So you're going to get a very short, short history of why,

33
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:42,314
for example, universities require researchers

34
00:02:42,474 --> 00:02:44,434
to go through like ethics training

35
00:02:44,494 --> 00:02:46,314
and get ethics approval for their projects.

36
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:48,575
Usually, of course,

37
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:49,955
it's because somebody messed it up for you.

38
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:55,309
I'm going to talk about some important concepts to keep in mind for testing, some questions

39
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,610
to ask yourself when prepping for testing.

40
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,953
I have a short section on VR because it's just becoming more and more of an important

41
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,555
thing to think about and hopefully we'll have about 10 minutes for Q&A at the end.

42
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:11,755
I should point out that this is not a talk about improving your game design through player

43
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:12,195
testing.

44
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:16,558
There are many other people, or you're probably more of an expert there.

45
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:21,882
There was a great talk yesterday about evil data in its relation to play testing and how

46
00:03:21,922 --> 00:03:26,506
to get better data or, you know, like sift through to get really, you know, ask the questions

47
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:27,386
that you really want to ask.

48
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:33,795
Instead, what this talk is about is ensuring that your play testers are getting the best

49
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:35,216
possible experience.

50
00:03:35,856 --> 00:03:40,338
That they don't leave feeling vaguely bad or mistreated.

51
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:44,741
You know, that they didn't, there was something that happened that they definitely didn't

52
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:45,421
sign up for.

53
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:49,206
And so, you know, they're happy, they're engaged,

54
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:52,870
and so they are giving you the best possible data

55
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:53,551
to work with.

56
00:03:54,092 --> 00:03:56,475
And also, if you're hoping to work with them again,

57
00:03:56,856 --> 00:03:59,499
that they are willing to come back and test again

58
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,241
and not just, you know, run screaming

59
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,503
and telling everybody, you know,

60
00:04:02,523 --> 00:04:03,685
what a horrible experience it was.

61
00:04:05,637 --> 00:04:08,418
So a caveat, it would be easy if this were a list,

62
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:09,999
just a simple list of do's and don'ts.

63
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,181
Instead, most researchers will say that

64
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:16,122
thinking about ethics with your research

65
00:04:16,642 --> 00:04:19,224
is like a series of questions that you have to ask yourself.

66
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:22,225
And sometimes there may be a definitive answer,

67
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:25,187
but many times it's really not that there's

68
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:26,487
one right or wrong answer,

69
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,288
but it's that you've considered it

70
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:30,930
and what are the consequences of going one way or another.

71
00:04:33,782 --> 00:04:36,003
These are some guidelines for you to consider,

72
00:04:36,564 --> 00:04:40,006
some hard-won knowledge that other people have found.

73
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:44,429
So a brief, very brief history of human subjects research.

74
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:46,370
I'm just gonna talk about two studies,

75
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,931
and you may have heard of them already.

76
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:52,014
Or I will if this will advance.

77
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:53,155
Okay.

78
00:04:54,324 --> 00:04:55,505
And these are from social science.

79
00:04:56,246 --> 00:04:58,528
Medical research has its own outliers

80
00:04:58,568 --> 00:05:00,029
in terms of very bad practices.

81
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,571
But in social science in 1961,

82
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:05,775
Stanley Milgram did a famous experiment

83
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:09,378
where he was interested in how obedient people

84
00:05:09,438 --> 00:05:11,340
would be to figures of authority.

85
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:16,057
And so he recruited folks and said, you know, I'm going to,

86
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:21,521
you pick a piece of paper and you can be either the tester or the testee.

87
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:25,603
And conveniently everybody was the tester.

88
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:27,044
They didn't know it.

89
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:31,967
The testee was just somebody who was in on the study, but the testers were told,

90
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:32,027
um,

91
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:35,567
You're gonna be watching them

92
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:37,169
and they're gonna be trying to,

93
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:40,552
it's this test to improve their memory.

94
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:41,513
They're gonna hear words,

95
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,134
they have to repeat them in sequence.

96
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:46,197
And we're trying to see if shocks,

97
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:48,660
if pain will increase their ability

98
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,902
to engage in memory recaller.

99
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:52,803
You know, increasingly motivate them.

100
00:05:53,764 --> 00:05:55,945
And over time there were more and more words

101
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:58,547
and the shocks got stronger and stronger.

102
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:02,129
And Milgram actually thought that most people would drop out,

103
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:03,750
like they would refuse to do this,

104
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,891
like that they would refuse to engage in the shocks.

105
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,872
Now, of course, these people did not know that the shocks were not real.

106
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:12,953
The people who were being shocked were actors.

107
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:20,594
But disturbingly, they found that many, many people were perfectly fine going along and

108
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,095
shocking people more and more.

109
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:23,675
I mean, these people were like screaming.

110
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:28,436
One guy was like banging on the wall, you know, in apparent distress.

111
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:32,797
And so they said, you know, wow, like, this is really showing us some interesting things

112
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:34,857
about how obedient people are to authority.

113
00:06:36,306 --> 00:06:41,068
This is important as we go along, but also another important element is that the people

114
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:45,270
were being deceived, but they didn't know, you know, of course, that, you know, these

115
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:49,052
other people were not really being shocked, which may cause you some psychological distress

116
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:49,873
that carries over.

117
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:54,755
But also, the people who were doing the shocks were not really told that they could withdraw

118
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:55,415
from the study.

119
00:06:55,755 --> 00:07:00,319
There were four prompts, like if they were being reluctant, the person who was watching

120
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:04,001
them said, you must continue, and then it's really vital that you continue.

121
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:07,604
And there were four going up to like, it's absolutely imperative that you continue this

122
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:07,964
study.

123
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:12,948
So even if these testers felt uncomfortable, it was a situation they mostly felt like they

124
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:14,108
could not escape from.

125
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:20,918
The second experiment is the Stanford Prison Experiment, which happened ten years later.

126
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,883
Philip Zimbardo ran it, and he was curious about the psychological effects of becoming

127
00:07:25,983 --> 00:07:27,504
a prisoner or a prison guard.

128
00:07:27,885 --> 00:07:32,249
He didn't know if it was the situation or, you know, individual psychological traits

129
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,990
within people.

130
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,390
that would lead to problems in prisons.

131
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:38,312
And so he recruited a group of college students

132
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,073
and they were randomly assigned to be a prisoner

133
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:42,353
or a prison guard.

134
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,054
And it was set up to be a two week experiment.

135
00:07:46,114 --> 00:07:48,475
They set up a mock prison in the basement

136
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:50,136
of a university lab on campus.

137
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:56,231
The prisoners, interestingly, they were not told exactly how this would start, but they

138
00:07:56,271 --> 00:08:01,257
were arrested at their homes one day, driven to prison, they were processed, given a jumpsuit,

139
00:08:01,938 --> 00:08:04,781
and they were given a number and told, you know, like, you're not going to be referred

140
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:07,424
to by your name, now you're this number for the duration.

141
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:11,930
And if you're familiar with it, you know that things quickly went downhill.

142
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,312
The prison guards wore reflective glasses so you couldn't see their eyes.

143
00:08:16,652 --> 00:08:21,936
They were told it was perfectly fine to psychologically harass the prisoners.

144
00:08:22,456 --> 00:08:25,298
They quickly and readily fell into this role.

145
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:31,181
The prisoners also fell into their roles, where some of them, the ones who tried to

146
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:34,103
fight back, were harassed and further abused.

147
00:08:34,743 --> 00:08:37,305
Many of them just fell into silence and depression.

148
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,068
Some of them actually had breakdowns and had to leave early.

149
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:47,054
Another important element, the subjects were told that they could not leave voluntarily.

150
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:50,277
And Zimbardo himself was not a neutral observer.

151
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:51,899
He couldn't really step back and see.

152
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,341
He was playing the role of the prisoner's superintendent.

153
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:59,627
It was actually his girlfriend at the time who was a graduate student who stepped in

154
00:08:59,667 --> 00:08:59,967
and said,

155
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:00,608
Hey.

156
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:02,980
This is kind of problematic.

157
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,161
I think you should really look at what's going on here.

158
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:08,322
And they shut down the experiment after six days.

159
00:09:09,303 --> 00:09:12,184
Also, another important element that led to further review

160
00:09:12,244 --> 00:09:14,906
by universities is the fact that they never actually

161
00:09:15,006 --> 00:09:17,567
talked to the people involved, like the subjects,

162
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:19,688
until almost a year later to see like,

163
00:09:19,728 --> 00:09:21,309
hey, how are you feeling, are you okay?

164
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:24,530
Is anything going on that might have caused you distress

165
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,431
ongoing after this?

166
00:09:27,263 --> 00:09:32,006
So those are the types of things that led to universities saying to researchers,

167
00:09:32,086 --> 00:09:35,888
hey, you know, we're going to have some protocols and guidelines if you're doing

168
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:41,270
any federally funded research. And actually, if you're a researcher in the U.S. or Canada,

169
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,552
even if you're not doing funded research, because your university accepts funds,

170
00:09:46,073 --> 00:09:48,194
you have to, you know, get ethics approval.

171
00:09:48,994 --> 00:09:53,276
Obviously, you may not have to do this, but many of the standards still apply for, you

172
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:57,637
know, like what are the principles and best practices for engaging in research.

173
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:04,320
And one of the big major ones that I'm going to start talking about is consent, you know,

174
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,900
what it is that people are agreeing to.

175
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:12,843
And so in the Canadian guidelines, they talk about consent has to be free, informed, and

176
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:13,463
ongoing.

177
00:10:13,943 --> 00:10:15,324
And by free, they mean voluntary.

178
00:10:15,864 --> 00:10:18,445
So I'm going to go through each of those three categories of consent.

179
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:24,086
So voluntary obviously means no undue influence or coercion.

180
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:27,088
The easiest example of this is, you know,

181
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:30,110
if you force somebody to play your game,

182
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,072
you know, I force somebody to participate

183
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:33,633
in a research experiment with me,

184
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:35,754
you know, maybe I threaten them,

185
00:10:35,774 --> 00:10:37,315
you're gonna fail my class if you don't.

186
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:40,238
Maybe you say you're gonna be fired if you don't do this.

187
00:10:40,818 --> 00:10:43,660
Obviously that is, you know, they cannot give their consent.

188
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:46,242
You know,

189
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,151
A little in a more of a gray area is undue influence.

190
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,371
And so one of the things to consider is,

191
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:55,012
is there a power relationship going on

192
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:57,052
between the investigator, you know,

193
00:10:57,152 --> 00:10:59,833
you who's setting up the test and potential participants.

194
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,553
Now it doesn't mean that you should never,

195
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:06,474
like it's never okay if you find somebody

196
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:07,974
who you're in a power relationship with,

197
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:10,575
just that you should be thinking about, you know,

198
00:11:11,035 --> 00:11:13,755
is there some way that I might be, you know,

199
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:14,535
unconsciously.

200
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,773
coercing them or convincing them to do something.

201
00:11:18,073 --> 00:11:21,618
Are they really free to say, no, I don't wanna do it?

202
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,182
If you're not sure if it's a power relationship,

203
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:26,584
think about, do they trust me?

204
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:29,708
And am I really pulling on that trust

205
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:31,310
to kind of get them to agree?

206
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,491
Participants should know, obviously with informed consent,

207
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:39,233
what's expected of them during the test.

208
00:11:39,774 --> 00:11:42,057
Now this does not mean that you have to tell them

209
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:44,500
every single thing about what's going to happen,

210
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,624
every element of information involved in your game,

211
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:50,487
but that they should have some general idea

212
00:11:50,507 --> 00:11:52,209
of what they're signing up for.

213
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,394
So, you know, what's the game? What are you asking them to do?

214
00:11:56,815 --> 00:12:00,138
You know, are you asking them to test like the first few levels?

215
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:07,226
Are you asking them to go through the entire game? Is it characters that you know, you're asking them to like react to like you're

216
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:09,669
Is there a character that they prefer?

217
00:12:10,242 --> 00:12:12,644
Is the storyline believable, you know, whatever.

218
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:14,825
Now it may be the case that, you know,

219
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:17,026
there's something that you don't want

220
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:18,167
to specifically tell them.

221
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:20,148
You know, how long is it gonna take you

222
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:21,089
to get through this level?

223
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:22,990
Because once you tell people something,

224
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,731
then they're unconsciously thinking of that.

225
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:27,773
But you can frame it in a more general way, right?

226
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:29,054
So at least they have some idea.

227
00:12:29,954 --> 00:12:30,835
They should also know, like,

228
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,956
how long they're going to be there, roughly.

229
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:34,757
You know, is this a 30 minute test?

230
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:36,018
Is it a two hour test?

231
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,299
What's gonna, you know,

232
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:41,166
How much time do they really need to budget?

233
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:43,888
How will they be observed and recorded?

234
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:46,510
I'll get into this in more detail,

235
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,652
but just, you know, like, what are the elements involved

236
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:50,974
in what you're doing in terms of watching them?

237
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:53,416
And also that it's okay to change their minds.

238
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:54,977
So at this stage, you know,

239
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:56,618
after you've explained what's going on,

240
00:12:56,938 --> 00:12:57,879
maybe they're gonna say like,

241
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,420
oh, it's a survival horror game.

242
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,321
I really don't like those.

243
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:01,042
This is not for me.

244
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,884
Okay, you know, it's fine for you to back out.

245
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:09,610
They should also be told what some of the risks are,

246
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:12,572
and if there are any potential benefits involved.

247
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:14,794
I'll get into this in more detail.

248
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,477
Also, that they're under no obligation to participate,

249
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:21,039
and again, that they're free to withdraw at any time.

250
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,062
And so it's really in terms of you're being open

251
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:28,225
and honest about saying, hey, if you're really not into this,

252
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:30,007
maybe this is not for you.

253
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:35,568
And I should also know, you know, like what's going to happen, like if you're recording their data,

254
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:41,332
are you going to identify them in any way? Like if there's a video camera, you know,

255
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:46,156
are you recording their face, their facial expressions, and is this something that you're

256
00:13:46,176 --> 00:13:50,499
going to keep, or are you going to like maybe gray out or blur out their face or something?

257
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,015
There should be obviously some contact information

258
00:13:56,075 --> 00:13:57,980
so they can ask you later if they have any questions

259
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,682
or concerns.

260
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,371
You should talk about how you're gonna actually use the data.

261
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:06,915
And so, like, is this something that it's just you who's looking at personally?

262
00:14:07,436 --> 00:14:09,937
Is it a member, you know, is it, like, your team?

263
00:14:10,357 --> 00:14:11,998
Is it everybody from the studio?

264
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:15,340
Are you going to use it, oh, in a GDC presentation?

265
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:21,184
You know, and you may not know immediately, like, how far you will take it, but, you know,

266
00:14:21,204 --> 00:14:24,906
you should think about that and say, like, it may be used in these particular spaces.

267
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:28,928
Maybe you're going to have blog posts or something about, you know, like, testing and what's

268
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:29,328
going on.

269
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,104
You should have information about any payments or incentives.

270
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:37,849
And also, you should give them a reasonable amount of time

271
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:40,311
to go through this so that they don't feel rushed.

272
00:14:40,652 --> 00:14:42,053
And they can also ask questions.

273
00:14:42,974 --> 00:14:45,557
And these things can all be things

274
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:48,861
that you can either print out so they can read quietly,

275
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:51,003
or you can explain it to them verbally.

276
00:14:51,363 --> 00:14:51,964
Either way is fine.

277
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,300
Consent also has to be ongoing.

278
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,301
What this means is just that it's not enough

279
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:02,841
to get somebody to say like, are you okay with this?

280
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:03,702
I've explained everything.

281
00:15:03,722 --> 00:15:06,162
They're like, yup, and then it's over.

282
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:09,123
Then you're in prisoner territory.

283
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:10,943
It's like they said yes once,

284
00:15:11,383 --> 00:15:12,924
and then no matter how horrible it was,

285
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:14,924
it was like, oh, well, you signed up for it, too bad.

286
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:19,305
People should feel like they have the opportunity

287
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:21,045
to leave at any time.

288
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:25,709
And if, you know, for whatever reason, maybe they don't like the experience, maybe they're

289
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:26,269
feeling sick.

290
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,512
You know, if they're not having a good time, they're not giving you good data.

291
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:35,496
And so you need to think about like how, what are the different ways that you could like

292
00:15:36,556 --> 00:15:37,517
remind people.

293
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:40,820
during the play session, you know, it's okay.

294
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,100
Like, we're gonna take a break now.

295
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:45,362
If you need to go now, that's cool, whatever.

296
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:47,784
If you have multiple aspects of the test,

297
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:49,425
are there things that maybe,

298
00:15:49,705 --> 00:15:51,486
if people are uncomfortable with one aspect,

299
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:53,567
you know, that you could omit that for them,

300
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:55,468
but have them do others?

301
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:58,470
Or maybe you need people to complete the whole experience

302
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,051
and just be up front with people and say,

303
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:02,412
like, if you're not comfortable with everything,

304
00:16:02,432 --> 00:16:04,213
then this isn't for you.

305
00:16:07,225 --> 00:16:09,870
So again, they should be told that they can stop,

306
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,773
not just leave, but stop at any time.

307
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:14,157
And the environment should support this.

308
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:19,214
So it's one thing to say this, and you know, you may not have control over where you're

309
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:19,994
doing the testing.

310
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:24,296
You know, maybe it's in a room down a corridor with no windows, and you know, you're sitting

311
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:24,997
in front of the door.

312
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:28,158
And I mean, that's like a very, you know, tough thing to do.

313
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:32,140
Like people are already, as those experiments show, kind of obedient to authority.

314
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,862
Like my students, you know, if I sit at the front of the room and the door is near me,

315
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:40,424
it's very difficult for them to like get up in the middle of class and walk out, right?

316
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:41,825
Like that's not a cool thing to do.

317
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:43,346
They don't want to draw attention.

318
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,248
And that's another way that the environment

319
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:48,829
can unwittingly shape people's expectations.

320
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,831
So if it's possible for you to think about this

321
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:54,092
and alter the environment so that people feel comfortable,

322
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:55,593
that's one thing you can do.

323
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:58,475
If it's not, then it may be a case

324
00:16:58,515 --> 00:17:00,176
of just reminding people more frequently.

325
00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:02,737
And there should be multiple ways to withdraw.

326
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:05,799
So maybe they can tell you, or maybe,

327
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,320
like I said, it's a break,

328
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,641
and they just kind of disappear.

329
00:17:12,302 --> 00:17:13,762
So you can use incentives.

330
00:17:16,143 --> 00:17:17,424
You may already use incentives.

331
00:17:18,824 --> 00:17:21,245
Probably for most testing,

332
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:23,346
and I've found this with testing,

333
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:27,608
playing the game is often incentive enough for most people.

334
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:30,869
I ran a study where people were playing games

335
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:32,010
that had already been released,

336
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,291
the Walking Dead series from

337
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,032
Telltale and also Dragon Age Inquisition.

338
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:42,396
We asked them to come in for three to six sessions of 90 minutes each,

339
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:46,718
and we didn't have any dropouts, and we didn't offer any compensation.

340
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:49,520
They just kept showing up because they enjoyed playing the game.

341
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:53,802
The one thing to think about in terms of ethics is, you know,

342
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:56,664
if you're offering very large incentives,

343
00:17:57,165 --> 00:18:01,667
because then it becomes about people just signing up for the money

344
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:04,549
or whatever the swag is that you're offering them.

345
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:14,215
So deception, you know, I mentioned you should be up front in telling people what it is that

346
00:18:14,295 --> 00:18:19,283
you're asking them to do, but, you know, is it ever okay to deceive people?

347
00:18:19,783 --> 00:18:21,466
Is it ever ethical to deceive people?

348
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:25,612
Yes, it can be.

349
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,874
You know, if, as I said,

350
00:18:28,014 --> 00:18:30,215
there are things that you're trying to measure

351
00:18:30,255 --> 00:18:32,477
and if you told people exactly what it was,

352
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:34,238
you know, that's obviously gonna,

353
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:36,480
it might change how they react.

354
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,201
But the big thing just to think about is

355
00:18:39,462 --> 00:18:41,963
what's the risk involved in the deception?

356
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:44,225
And does the benefit of the deception

357
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:46,286
outweigh any potential risks?

358
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:50,170
Okay, so this is where you're in the balancing act of,

359
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,071
you know, are you just doing this

360
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:53,912
because you didn't really think it through,

361
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:57,614
or, you know, is there like something really important

362
00:18:57,634 --> 00:18:59,314
that you need to get from players,

363
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:01,335
and if you told them ahead of time, you know,

364
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:02,136
it would not work.

365
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:04,437
Also, another thing to keep in mind is,

366
00:19:04,837 --> 00:19:06,378
you know, you've been working with this game,

367
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,999
you're close to it, you know it so intently.

368
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,221
People coming in may have no idea,

369
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:14,202
really, like, what it is about.

370
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,819
And so for them, many surprises are going to be magnified.

371
00:19:24,876 --> 00:19:26,537
Probably the majority of the time,

372
00:19:28,177 --> 00:19:31,059
the testing that you do under university rules

373
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,859
would qualify as minimal risk.

374
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,142
The university speak for defining minimal risk

375
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:41,483
is probability and magnitude of possible harms

376
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:43,624
implied by participation in the study

377
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,945
is no greater than those encountered by participants

378
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:48,006
in those aspects of their everyday life

379
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:49,467
that relate to the research.

380
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:53,948
It's amazing how convoluted universities can make.

381
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:55,293
You know, simple statements.

382
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:58,374
So if this is something that people would probably do

383
00:19:58,514 --> 00:20:01,836
in their everyday life, then it's minimal risk, right?

384
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:05,818
So if your game is rated, you are targeting it like

385
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:08,019
E for everyone or T for teen, it's probably something

386
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,620
that they would do in their everyday life,

387
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:12,882
and so you would be qualified as minimal risk.

388
00:20:15,243 --> 00:20:17,605
There are a few times when you go beyond minimal risk.

389
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:22,649
Minimal risk doesn't mean that you have to ignore all of this, but just that, you know,

390
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:23,670
the stakes are a little lower.

391
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:28,314
If you're beyond it, then you do have to think a little bit more carefully, you know, and

392
00:20:28,334 --> 00:20:31,096
you might want to consider some of the resources I suggest at the end.

393
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:37,201
Beyond minimal risk can happen when suddenly you're involving vulnerable populations, which

394
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:38,162
is how we talk about them.

395
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:43,266
So children, those people with diminished capacity, so people with, like, cognitive

396
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:44,908
impairments, you know, where consent

397
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,570
Maybe something that you have to really think about

398
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,711
how they can understand that.

399
00:20:49,551 --> 00:20:51,033
And also indigenous peoples.

400
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:55,436
So indigenous peoples in Canada have this very bad history

401
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:57,317
of being exploited and abused.

402
00:20:57,697 --> 00:20:59,659
They were tested on by different people

403
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,640
just as like a convenient population

404
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,721
to see what would happen.

405
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:06,263
And so now they get extra protection as a result.

406
00:21:06,984 --> 00:21:09,025
I just wanna talk a little bit more about children though,

407
00:21:09,105 --> 00:21:11,307
cause that's probably the population you would deal with.

408
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:16,004
So obviously with kids, it's not just the child,

409
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:18,267
but their parent or their guardian

410
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:19,589
who would need to consent.

411
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,053
But also think about the age range you're including and why.

412
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:26,438
Because kids aren't necessarily an amorphous group.

413
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:33,101
A 7, a 10, and a 13-year-old are all going to be really different in terms of what they

414
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:38,682
understand, how they think about the world, how they can communicate back to you, what

415
00:21:38,762 --> 00:21:42,424
elements of the game they might think are interesting or exciting or scary.

416
00:21:43,024 --> 00:21:50,666
And so, you know, think carefully about how to, you know, which age ranges you want to

417
00:21:50,706 --> 00:21:51,046
include.

418
00:21:53,427 --> 00:21:53,587
And... .

419
00:21:54,539 --> 00:22:00,481
I would say this is a common recommendation for researching with children.

420
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:02,922
I would say it would apply to anybody.

421
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:10,504
As the prior experiments have shown, adults are sometimes uncomfortable with saying, no,

422
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:11,904
I feel uncomfortable doing this.

423
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:13,345
Kids are even more so.

424
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:15,805
So are there ways that with nonverbals you can...

425
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:18,067
Figure out like they're not having a good time.

426
00:22:18,747 --> 00:22:20,548
You know, are they closed off?

427
00:22:20,768 --> 00:22:22,529
You know, they started laughing, now they're not.

428
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,790
They're looking down, their body language is closed up.

429
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:27,332
You know, that can be a way that a kid is signaling

430
00:22:27,812 --> 00:22:28,913
they're not comfortable anymore.

431
00:22:30,622 --> 00:22:35,163
I'm not going to talk any more about children, but if you do research or play testing with

432
00:22:35,223 --> 00:22:38,724
kids, I would say check out this talk from The Vault.

433
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:45,806
In 2014, Gareth Griffiths talked about testing Skylanders with kids of different ages, and

434
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:48,747
he's got some really good information about how to do that.

435
00:22:56,734 --> 00:23:02,925
So you've identified who you want to test with and what you

436
00:23:02,945 --> 00:23:03,546
want to collect.

437
00:23:04,027 --> 00:23:06,271
Now you want to think about how you're going to store this.

438
00:23:07,393 --> 00:23:08,455
How are you collecting your data?

439
00:23:09,202 --> 00:23:11,122
You know, are you audio, video recording?

440
00:23:11,342 --> 00:23:12,223
Are you going beyond that?

441
00:23:12,263 --> 00:23:13,243
Are you just taking notes?

442
00:23:13,883 --> 00:23:15,043
But how are you storing it?

443
00:23:16,364 --> 00:23:18,625
Is this gonna be secure in any way?

444
00:23:18,645 --> 00:23:22,146
Does every member of the team have access to it?

445
00:23:22,466 --> 00:23:24,326
Which can be fine, but you just need to know

446
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:25,987
how far you want it to get out.

447
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:28,948
How are you identifying participants?

448
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,628
You know, are you using their names

449
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,369
or are you taking off their names

450
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:34,270
and then assigning a pseudonym?

451
00:23:35,334 --> 00:23:36,675
Again, what are you doing with the data?

452
00:23:37,156 --> 00:23:39,539
And also what happens to the data when the study is over,

453
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,142
when your play tests are done, when the game is released?

454
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:43,844
If you're like me and you're a Packwright,

455
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:45,306
you tend to just hang on to everything.

456
00:23:45,326 --> 00:23:47,749
You're like, oh, I don't know when I could possibly need this

457
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:48,509
again, but I might.

458
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:52,775
But it might be better just to erase it and get rid of it

459
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,917
so that you don't worry about it getting out anywhere.

460
00:23:58,635 --> 00:24:01,237
And related to that, how are you gonna identify these people?

461
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:04,160
There are different levels of control that you can have.

462
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,682
So you could keep people anonymous.

463
00:24:07,422 --> 00:24:09,244
This usually works with online surveys

464
00:24:09,264 --> 00:24:11,006
where you don't even know who these people are.

465
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:12,887
But maybe people come through

466
00:24:12,927 --> 00:24:15,209
who never physically identify themselves to you,

467
00:24:15,229 --> 00:24:17,912
and you've got this data that you just,

468
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:19,613
is literally unlabeled.

469
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:24,866
More commonly, you know who these people are, and then you have the choice of saying, you

470
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:28,207
know, we're going to keep this information confidential, like your personal name and,

471
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:32,568
you know, address, or we're going to identify you.

472
00:24:32,908 --> 00:24:35,909
A lot of times people offer them the choice, like, do you want to be identified or not?

473
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,429
Chances are you're not using this outside of your studio, so it's not going to make

474
00:24:39,469 --> 00:24:39,869
a difference.

475
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:44,831
But if you did want to use it, you know, in public-facing materials, this is something

476
00:24:44,871 --> 00:24:46,651
like to ask people, are you okay with this?

477
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:50,445
So VR.

478
00:24:52,966 --> 00:24:58,931
There's a study that came out last year talking about research ethics in VR testing that said,

479
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:03,775
you know, VR poses risks that are novel, that go beyond the risks of traditional psychological

480
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:08,198
experiments in isolated environments, and go beyond risks of existing media technology

481
00:25:08,238 --> 00:25:08,958
for the general public.

482
00:25:10,063 --> 00:25:17,125
Even though VR feels pretty new, there have been waves of interest in VR and some researchers

483
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:18,786
have been studying VR for quite a while.

484
00:25:19,206 --> 00:25:23,647
And so there are a few studies that we can draw on to kind of get a sense of how people

485
00:25:23,687 --> 00:25:27,068
might react with VR systems.

486
00:25:27,088 --> 00:25:29,589
In 2002, there was a study of the virtual pit.

487
00:25:30,502 --> 00:25:33,545
So they had subjects put on a head-mounted display and stand on a ledge.

488
00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:36,507
They were asked to lean over and drop a bean bag into a pit.

489
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:40,910
Now in reality, they were standing on a wooden platform that was an inch and a half off the

490
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,713
ground and they were told this, like they knew it as they were getting on it.

491
00:25:45,274 --> 00:25:50,317
But still, even though they cognitively knew this was going on, their bodies felt that

492
00:25:50,377 --> 00:25:52,359
it was a real situation, that they were really

493
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:58,003
They were actually standing over a pit, and so their heart rate increased, their sweating increased,

494
00:25:58,063 --> 00:25:59,664
some of them felt very uncomfortable.

495
00:26:00,284 --> 00:26:06,168
So even as they knew in their brains, this is just a test, this is not real,

496
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:08,090
their bodies reacted like it was real.

497
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,851
Remember the Milgram experiment with the shocks

498
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:12,812
that I told you about.

499
00:26:13,193 --> 00:26:16,015
Somebody redid this experiment in VR in 2006,

500
00:26:17,036 --> 00:26:18,577
but what they did was they asked people

501
00:26:18,637 --> 00:26:21,240
to administer shocks to a virtual human.

502
00:26:22,701 --> 00:26:25,243
So they had some people who saw the virtual human,

503
00:26:25,303 --> 00:26:28,446
some that were just, it was a text communication,

504
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:33,971
but the testers knew that this was a fake person, right?

505
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:36,953
And so, but they were told, well, we're seeing how,

506
00:26:37,193 --> 00:26:40,555
This is how the application of pain applies to learning with virtual humans.

507
00:26:40,655 --> 00:26:43,717
I don't know how that would apply, but this is what they were told.

508
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:47,979
And interestingly, again, even though they knew that it was fake,

509
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:53,382
they reacted bodily as if this person was real.

510
00:26:54,243 --> 00:26:56,684
So two people, you know, they had to read words,

511
00:26:57,124 --> 00:27:01,047
and then the virtual human had to repeat them back, and if they got them wrong, they shocked them.

512
00:27:01,727 --> 00:27:04,228
Two participants emphasized correct answers, you know, like,

513
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:07,610
These are the, you know, they're like reading them out, kind of like hint, hint.

514
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:12,051
And, you know, asked, when asked about it later, they were, said they were trying to help her.

515
00:27:13,491 --> 00:27:16,592
Eight repeated the question after receiving no response.

516
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:20,534
So the virtual human's quiet, and they're like, hey, come on, come on, let's go, let's go,

517
00:27:20,614 --> 00:27:21,694
even though they knew she was fake.

518
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:24,835
They showed increasing frustration with wrong answers.

519
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:31,569
The researchers concluded people behaved in a way that only made sense if they were

520
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:34,656
responding to the virtual character as if she were real.

521
00:27:35,563 --> 00:27:40,066
They said humans respond realistically at a subjective level, so they were like justifying

522
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:41,307
it verbally afterwards.

523
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:44,789
Physiologically, you know, they could tell their heart rate increased.

524
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:46,510
They were increasingly uncomfortable.

525
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:51,613
By the way, they also kept going up with the shocks even though they said that they really

526
00:27:51,673 --> 00:27:52,254
felt bad.

527
00:27:52,534 --> 00:27:55,196
They felt bad in doing this to a virtual person.

528
00:27:55,856 --> 00:27:59,879
And behaviorally as well, like their physical body, they could tell that they were uncomfortable

529
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:00,359
doing this.

530
00:28:02,482 --> 00:28:05,727
So they said this could be evidence that, again,

531
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:08,230
we are obedient to authority figures.

532
00:28:09,793 --> 00:28:11,395
Also, it may be a matter of participants

533
00:28:11,435 --> 00:28:13,398
being willing to put up with their own discomfort

534
00:28:13,438 --> 00:28:15,141
for the sake of honoring their agreement

535
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:16,683
to be a participant in the experiment.

536
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:18,870
And I just want to underline here,

537
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,990
for the sake of honoring their agreement

538
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,671
to be a participant in the experiment.

539
00:28:23,171 --> 00:28:25,672
So we already know, you know, like people want to help you,

540
00:28:25,692 --> 00:28:27,633
you know, there's other research that they'll,

541
00:28:28,013 --> 00:28:30,614
you know, make themselves uncomfortable with VR.

542
00:28:30,714 --> 00:28:32,354
Even again, they felt, you know,

543
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:34,175
fair amounts of distress,

544
00:28:34,475 --> 00:28:36,015
and they put aside their own distress

545
00:28:36,096 --> 00:28:37,856
because they really wanted to help people.

546
00:28:38,236 --> 00:28:39,377
The question is, you know,

547
00:28:39,477 --> 00:28:40,877
are you really getting good data

548
00:28:40,937 --> 00:28:43,118
if people are uncomfortable with the experience,

549
00:28:43,178 --> 00:28:44,398
if they're not having a good time?

550
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:48,024
On the positive side of things,

551
00:28:48,104 --> 00:28:50,285
Nikki and Jeremy Bailenson have studied

552
00:28:50,305 --> 00:28:51,645
what they call the Proteus Effect,

553
00:28:51,725 --> 00:28:53,946
putting people in VR and for example,

554
00:28:54,146 --> 00:28:57,027
giving them an avatar that's taller than themselves

555
00:28:57,147 --> 00:28:59,768
or better looking and asking them to negotiate.

556
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:01,569
And they find that they're more confident

557
00:29:01,629 --> 00:29:02,910
and able to better negotiate.

558
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,471
And that actually this ability carries through

559
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:08,452
after the VR is over.

560
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:11,153
They don't know how long it lasts after the VR,

561
00:29:11,173 --> 00:29:13,453
but it did last after they continued,

562
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:15,134
after they ended the testing.

563
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,904
So what this means is with VR,

564
00:29:20,585 --> 00:29:21,805
there's a bit of a tautology.

565
00:29:22,226 --> 00:29:24,207
Like the central, the one thing we say

566
00:29:24,247 --> 00:29:25,488
is do no harm to people.

567
00:29:26,188 --> 00:29:28,410
But even though we know a little bit of what's out there,

568
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,571
you know, and researchers will say

569
00:29:30,932 --> 00:29:32,473
there should be no foreseeable harms

570
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:33,654
with the research that you're doing,

571
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:35,635
we don't know what necessarily

572
00:29:35,695 --> 00:29:37,616
the foreseeable harms are with VR.

573
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:39,298
People are reacting differently

574
00:29:39,358 --> 00:29:41,819
than they do with standard research.

575
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,665
And so with VR, it's more about, again,

576
00:29:46,705 --> 00:29:49,088
carefully considering, like having a statement

577
00:29:49,128 --> 00:29:51,370
to tell people, you know, immersive VR

578
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,333
can have lasting behavioral influences.

579
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,716
Some of these risks may presently be unknown.

580
00:29:55,776 --> 00:29:57,077
It's just being honest with people,

581
00:29:57,117 --> 00:29:58,819
like we really don't know what might happen.

582
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,181
Like, that's the truth.

583
00:30:02,153 --> 00:30:05,475
Also telling people that they may have powerful emotional

584
00:30:05,535 --> 00:30:08,056
responses to game content, whether or not

585
00:30:08,096 --> 00:30:09,036
they believe it's real.

586
00:30:09,817 --> 00:30:13,599
It may be one thing to say, oh, I'm used to scary games,

587
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,500
but it's another when you are in the scary game

588
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,682
and we know that people's bodies react powerfully

589
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:21,843
even when their brain is telling them it's fake,

590
00:30:21,883 --> 00:30:23,284
it's fake, it's fake.

591
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:25,065
Torture in the virtual environment

592
00:30:25,205 --> 00:30:28,987
is still torture if you're perceiving it as such.

593
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,942
Also with VR, there's the chance that you're getting a lot more data.

594
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:42,685
Suddenly it's not just a video recording, but maybe it's eye movements, bodily movements,

595
00:30:42,725 --> 00:30:46,887
you know, you're tracking their kinetics over space and time, and so, you know, you need

596
00:30:46,907 --> 00:30:51,789
to think about what, it's fine to collect that data, but how are you storing it and

597
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:52,809
how long are you keeping it?

598
00:30:53,730 --> 00:31:00,032
And what might you reasonably erase at the end so that, you know, people keep their privacy.

599
00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:07,918
And also just beyond testing, thinking about doing game development in VR, we don't know

600
00:31:07,938 --> 00:31:11,060
the psychological impacts of long-term immersion in VR.

601
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,463
I mean, the games that you see now are fairly short experiences.

602
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:16,904
Obviously, testing is a pretty short experience.

603
00:31:17,745 --> 00:31:18,345
But you know, like...

604
00:31:19,226 --> 00:31:39,537
It's still an open question in terms of what long-term exposure might be, and also like what is the potential for abusive avatars, you know, that look like their users, not just when a person is in the virtual space with their avatar, but if they have ownership of an avatar, you know, is there the possibility that somebody might be able to take it or copy it and exploit it?

605
00:31:44,395 --> 00:31:45,216
So that's the background.

606
00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:48,320
So now you want to create a protocol for playtesting.

607
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,503
And I'm just going to go through here with a game or

608
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:55,067
two that I've created with some questions based on all

609
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:58,411
of this to kind of guide, like thinking about my thought

610
00:31:58,431 --> 00:32:01,594
processes as we went through, and also some additional ones,

611
00:32:01,634 --> 00:32:04,177
like for imaginary features that we would add.

612
00:32:05,495 --> 00:32:10,499
So in 2010, I was part of the Gambit Game Lab at MIT.

613
00:32:10,939 --> 00:32:14,181
We had a group making Exa, Isla the Wisekind, which was just

614
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:16,182
a puzzle game that was on Facebook.

615
00:32:17,023 --> 00:32:18,263
And this is what it looked like.

616
00:32:19,344 --> 00:32:22,746
And just so you know, when I put up this screenshot, I

617
00:32:22,786 --> 00:32:25,768
realized that at the bottom were, remember the old

618
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:27,810
Facebook games where you had the faces of all of your

619
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,990
friends that you were playing with?

620
00:32:29,511 --> 00:32:31,492
And I had all the faces of all the friends I was playing

621
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,274
with, and I was like, oh, I didn't ask them if their faces

622
00:32:34,314 --> 00:32:34,954
could be up there.

623
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:38,724
So I have cropped that, that's why the aspect looks a little off.

624
00:32:39,164 --> 00:32:43,107
So yeah, didn't want their faces necessarily associated with it.

625
00:32:44,268 --> 00:32:45,529
So what was I testing for?

626
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:50,575
So with this game, you know, we did a couple play tests over the course of the summer that

627
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:51,416
we were making the game.

628
00:32:52,056 --> 00:32:56,220
And at first, you know, it was do players understand what to do in the first level?

629
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,882
Because as you saw, it's a puzzle game.

630
00:32:57,922 --> 00:33:01,085
You twist tiles so that your little avatar can make their way through.

631
00:33:01,505 --> 00:33:04,668
You can make puzzles for other players and share them.

632
00:33:04,688 --> 00:33:07,531
And it's timed however long, you know, it takes.

633
00:33:07,631 --> 00:33:10,474
And so you can beat people's times and share other puzzles.

634
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,791
So do they understand what to do?

635
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:15,472
Do the instructions make sense?

636
00:33:16,132 --> 00:33:18,454
And how long are players taking to get to the end of

637
00:33:18,474 --> 00:33:18,854
the level?

638
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,355
Because at first, the first few levels we created for

639
00:33:21,415 --> 00:33:23,757
people so that they would kind of learn how to do it.

640
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,612
So with recruitment, we could ask,

641
00:33:28,812 --> 00:33:29,914
so who's the player base?

642
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:32,396
How can I recruit people from that group

643
00:33:32,436 --> 00:33:35,819
without exploiting any trust or power relationships?

644
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:38,742
We were lucky that Gambit had a reputation

645
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:41,184
for doing play tests regularly over the summer.

646
00:33:41,905 --> 00:33:43,807
So we had a good pool of people who were happy

647
00:33:43,867 --> 00:33:47,290
to sign up and attend just for the pleasure

648
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,631
of playing the games.

649
00:33:49,297 --> 00:33:53,379
In terms of incentives and rewards, there was the playing of the games, and then each

650
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:55,200
team with a game usually had cookies.

651
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,742
Sometimes we would compete with each other for better cookies or chocolate or that kind

652
00:33:58,782 --> 00:33:59,062
of thing.

653
00:34:00,223 --> 00:34:04,065
And so we didn't have a relationship we were necessarily exploiting.

654
00:34:05,026 --> 00:34:06,967
And where was I asking them to playtest?

655
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:11,670
So these were labs with several doors.

656
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,411
It was easy to get in and out of them.

657
00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:14,551
People moved freely.

658
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:18,233
There was no way to really kind of trap people in a particular space.

659
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:23,565
How will I handle obtaining consent?

660
00:34:24,786 --> 00:34:27,786
So with Gambit at the time, there was a blanket consent

661
00:34:27,826 --> 00:34:30,387
that people would fill out when they came in

662
00:34:31,147 --> 00:34:31,908
to test the games.

663
00:34:33,248 --> 00:34:35,669
If I'm doing other testing of other games,

664
00:34:35,729 --> 00:34:37,769
then I can have a sheet of paper

665
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:39,070
with all of the information on it

666
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,450
to hand out as people start.

667
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,771
That's usually the way that I like to do it

668
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,111
rather than verbally explain it

669
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:46,072
because then people can just kind of take their time

670
00:34:46,092 --> 00:34:46,852
and think through it.

671
00:34:47,974 --> 00:34:51,537
And how do I ensure testers feel comfortable enough to leave if they really want to quit?

672
00:34:52,517 --> 00:34:58,221
You know, we did have people observing, people playing EXA, but they tried not to be really

673
00:34:58,321 --> 00:34:58,881
intrusive.

674
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:00,202
They were sort of standing back.

675
00:35:00,522 --> 00:35:04,285
But we would tell people a couple times, you know, like, you can leave whenever you want.

676
00:35:04,325 --> 00:35:08,508
There's also in this game, like, once you solve a puzzle, they're fairly quick.

677
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:13,151
It's not like you're, the game itself makes it difficult to just sort of get up and leave.

678
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:19,805
Deception, is there anything in the game I want to be a surprise to testers?

679
00:35:21,348 --> 00:35:24,052
There was nothing here that really stood out.

680
00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:29,121
Is there a way to let testers know there's some material that they might be really bothered

681
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:29,362
by?

682
00:35:30,283 --> 00:35:38,526
In this game, no. There's another game that I'm working on on my own, where, as the geek of all geeks, I'm making a game about being a department chair at a university.

683
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:46,568
And, you know, there are multiple problems that you encounter, and, you know, one of those problems could be dealing with sexual harassment.

684
00:35:47,148 --> 00:35:58,012
You know, and I want players—I don't necessarily want to tell them in advance, like, every single problem that the player character will go through, but I might, you know, say in the consent form, like,

685
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:01,095
As an administrator, you deal with multiple problems.

686
00:36:01,155 --> 00:36:04,458
These could include sexual harassment, student complaints,

687
00:36:04,718 --> 00:36:05,959
shrinking budgets, whatever.

688
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,722
You know, let me know if you have any questions about this.

689
00:36:08,762 --> 00:36:10,604
So if somebody came up to me and said, hey,

690
00:36:10,644 --> 00:36:11,485
what do you mean by this?

691
00:36:11,945 --> 00:36:14,408
I could tell them, like, here's what the scenario is.

692
00:36:14,428 --> 00:36:15,569
Are you OK with that?

693
00:36:16,229 --> 00:36:19,893
Because really you don't know when people are coming and what their backgrounds are, right?

694
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:24,798
Like you don't know in their history what kinds of bad experiences they've had

695
00:36:25,198 --> 00:36:28,441
or maybe that, you know, their friends and family have had that they've been a party to.

696
00:36:28,922 --> 00:36:30,884
Maybe they just had an incredibly bad day.

697
00:36:31,244 --> 00:36:33,847
You know, why make them feel worse by, you know,

698
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:40,173
springing something on them. But in that way, by sort of generally alluding to a situation,

699
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:46,160
I'm not informing everybody, you know, of what's coming, but the person who might have a problem

700
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,685
with it, you know, then can talk with me and I can give them more information. So that's where

701
00:36:50,745 --> 00:36:52,747
the, you know, is the surprise really worth it or not.

702
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,408
Now if I were doing a VR version of this,

703
00:36:59,028 --> 00:37:03,030
and this is just gathered from playtesters,

704
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,591
playtesting groups who are working with VR now,

705
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:08,813
but having a kill switch so that everything

706
00:37:08,873 --> 00:37:10,814
quickly turns off so that people,

707
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:12,355
if they're uncomfortable and upset,

708
00:37:12,395 --> 00:37:13,996
can get out of the situation,

709
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,197
especially with VR because there are so many parts involved.

710
00:37:17,257 --> 00:37:19,138
It's not just as simple as taking

711
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:20,359
your hand off the mouse, right?

712
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:23,561
Having a protective bubble around people's avatars.

713
00:37:24,487 --> 00:37:29,130
Whether it's because they're playing with other people or even potentially with NPCs.

714
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:34,013
So remember the virtual human, people felt bad about hurting the virtual human.

715
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:38,236
So it may be the case that they feel bad about being attacked by an NPC.

716
00:37:39,797 --> 00:37:44,360
And again, protected populations, which I can deal with in the Q&A if you're interested.

717
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:50,092
So it might be useful if you're doing VR research

718
00:37:50,932 --> 00:37:53,713
to find information for people,

719
00:37:54,213 --> 00:37:56,454
like if you're dealing with certain issues

720
00:37:56,514 --> 00:37:58,795
or certain problems that you know,

721
00:37:58,835 --> 00:38:01,756
like sexual harassment or racism or whatever,

722
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:05,117
like to have information available for your testers

723
00:38:05,177 --> 00:38:07,298
to know like if you're bothered by this,

724
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:08,698
here are some people that you can talk to.

725
00:38:11,913 --> 00:38:15,370
So other questions I would ask as I was doing my play test.

726
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:16,677
So how am I recording?

727
00:38:17,825 --> 00:38:21,847
With both games, I wasn't actually recording any gameplay.

728
00:38:21,987 --> 00:38:24,007
I was simply standing behind people,

729
00:38:24,628 --> 00:38:26,288
watching them, taking notes.

730
00:38:26,668 --> 00:38:28,349
And then I would also ask people to fill out

731
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:30,669
a brief questionnaire at the very end,

732
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,710
asking them about specific elements of the game.

733
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,851
Because of this, there was no identifiable information

734
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:38,192
like linked back to people.

735
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:40,833
What we would usually do is say like,

736
00:38:41,313 --> 00:38:44,294
tester, one who sat in this chair, female.

737
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,441
You know, and maybe ask people for like an age range so that we could, you know,

738
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:53,302
kind of get the data and sort of understand maybe how it broke down.

739
00:38:55,203 --> 00:38:59,545
So I did not share that with anyone. Uh, so I didn't need to worry about that.

740
00:38:59,565 --> 00:39:02,546
Uh, again, we kept the data,

741
00:39:02,626 --> 00:39:06,148
we created a Google spreadsheet with it and then at the end of the project got

742
00:39:06,188 --> 00:39:08,769
rid of it and yeah, it's gone.

743
00:39:11,296 --> 00:39:12,997
Now if we were doing a multi-play test,

744
00:39:13,898 --> 00:39:15,498
you know, there are questions to ask.

745
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:17,600
So do players, you know, like in terms of

746
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,101
what am I testing for suddenly,

747
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:21,162
if you've got players not just by themselves

748
00:39:21,222 --> 00:39:23,703
but maybe competing or collaborating with other players,

749
00:39:24,704 --> 00:39:26,585
do players understand how they can interact

750
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:27,366
with other players?

751
00:39:27,786 --> 00:39:30,127
Do instructions, do the instructions

752
00:39:30,147 --> 00:39:31,248
I'm giving them make sense?

753
00:39:32,068 --> 00:39:33,769
Maybe you're testing out harassment tools

754
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,931
and so you're thinking about are they using them,

755
00:39:36,371 --> 00:39:38,412
you know, and what kinds of toxicity am I seeing?

756
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:45,112
Just a note here, based on some research that I found

757
00:39:45,232 --> 00:39:49,375
about harassment, a lot of times when you ask people

758
00:39:49,796 --> 00:39:51,597
about harassment, and you're saying,

759
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:53,779
have you been harassed, they will say no.

760
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,761
That doesn't mean that they weren't harassed.

761
00:39:57,682 --> 00:39:59,723
Sometimes, especially with teens,

762
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:03,706
they don't see what I would see as harassment

763
00:40:03,787 --> 00:40:06,048
as harassment, they would term it drama.

764
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:09,936
So if I say, have you been harassed, they're going to say no, but it doesn't mean that

765
00:40:09,956 --> 00:40:11,437
there weren't problematic behaviors.

766
00:40:12,097 --> 00:40:16,620
So it could be the case that you just ask generally, are there interactions that bothered

767
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:16,880
you?

768
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,581
You know, were there negative things that happened?

769
00:40:19,022 --> 00:40:23,605
You can also ask, you know, as a way to kind of offload, did you notice negative comments

770
00:40:23,725 --> 00:40:29,248
about others in the game, which is usually an easier way to get at it, right?

771
00:40:29,308 --> 00:40:33,831
Because people are usually much more willing to say, oh, I noticed this directed at so

772
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:36,553
and so, rather than like I was harassed.

773
00:40:36,883 --> 00:40:37,964
They don't want to be that person.

774
00:40:40,866 --> 00:40:44,769
So putting it all together, if you want to do a consent form,

775
00:40:45,649 --> 00:40:48,231
this is just some language that would distill it down.

776
00:40:50,092 --> 00:40:52,394
And there's slide after slide.

777
00:40:52,434 --> 00:40:53,695
I'm just going to read them through quickly.

778
00:40:53,715 --> 00:40:57,558
So I understand I've been asked to participate

779
00:40:57,598 --> 00:41:00,800
in playtesting of X Isle of the Wise Kind by Mia Consolvo.

780
00:41:02,067 --> 00:41:05,750
And these are the kinds of consent forms that I would have to give to the university to show.

781
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:09,974
I have been informed that the purpose of the playtesting is to determine

782
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:13,337
whatever it is that I'm testing for at the time.

783
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,683
I understand I am being asked to play a game that isn't finished for about 30 minutes.

784
00:41:22,184 --> 00:41:25,027
I understand that the computer is video recording my gameplay.

785
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:28,570
I am being observed by someone while I play who is taking written notes.

786
00:41:29,202 --> 00:41:30,622
Obviously at the time we weren't doing that,

787
00:41:30,682 --> 00:41:32,123
but that's something else that you would add.

788
00:41:33,844 --> 00:41:36,005
I understand that I am free to withdraw my consent

789
00:41:36,065 --> 00:41:38,106
and discontinue my participation at any time

790
00:41:38,146 --> 00:41:39,467
without negative consequences.

791
00:41:42,288 --> 00:41:44,109
Going to risk, there might be certain risks.

792
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,571
These risks include feeling frustration or anger

793
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:49,632
while playing or hearing other players saying

794
00:41:49,712 --> 00:41:51,833
negative things during gameplay, which might upset me.

795
00:41:55,475 --> 00:41:56,896
This would depend on, you know,

796
00:41:57,757 --> 00:41:59,818
Which way you're going with the data, but I understand that my

797
00:41:59,858 --> 00:42:01,479
participation in the study is.

798
00:42:01,499 --> 00:42:04,761
And you can also offer people here the choice, so they could

799
00:42:04,801 --> 00:42:06,381
circle the one that they want it to be.

800
00:42:06,842 --> 00:42:09,443
You know, confidential, the researcher will know but will

801
00:42:09,463 --> 00:42:11,864
not disclose, or non-confidential, my identity

802
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,325
will be revealed in study results.

803
00:42:13,385 --> 00:42:15,486
So sometimes you can say, pick the one that you're

804
00:42:15,526 --> 00:42:16,166
comfortable with.

805
00:42:18,807 --> 00:42:22,009
And then, I've carefully studied the above and understand this

806
00:42:22,049 --> 00:42:24,430
agreement, I freely consent and voluntarily agree to

807
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,430
participate in this study.

808
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:39,324
Some additional resources for U.S.-based developers, the guidelines, the Belmont report, and some

809
00:42:39,364 --> 00:42:42,230
other training modules are at these URLs.

810
00:42:45,783 --> 00:42:47,824
And then for Canadian-based developers,

811
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:49,444
there's another website.

812
00:42:49,864 --> 00:42:51,605
And for European-based developers,

813
00:42:51,845 --> 00:42:52,925
there's a third website.

814
00:42:53,565 --> 00:42:55,646
European researchers usually have

815
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,826
slightly different guidelines to think about.

816
00:42:57,926 --> 00:43:00,867
There are stronger protections for privacy

817
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:04,148
with people working in a European context.

818
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,968
There's also slightly different guidelines in terms of,

819
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:09,489
they may not, universities may not always

820
00:43:09,529 --> 00:43:11,289
make such a heavy hand in terms of like,

821
00:43:13,276 --> 00:43:16,920
Asking about these matters, they may just rely more on researchers who are doing their

822
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,260
own work.

823
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,405
But depending on which context you're in, it can be useful to see kind of what the standards

824
00:43:22,585 --> 00:43:22,665
are.

825
00:43:24,475 --> 00:43:28,938
And then again, if you're interested in VR-based testing,

826
00:43:29,378 --> 00:43:31,340
this is what I was drawing a lot of the material

827
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,121
from this study from last year.

828
00:43:33,901 --> 00:43:35,863
Real virtuality, a code of ethical conduct,

829
00:43:35,923 --> 00:43:37,844
recommendations for good scientific practice

830
00:43:38,004 --> 00:43:39,645
and the consumers of VR technology.

831
00:43:40,246 --> 00:43:43,188
It's an open source site, so you can read the whole article.

832
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:45,169
And it's also got lots of good links

833
00:43:45,249 --> 00:43:48,171
to other research, other player-based research using

834
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:50,373
VR that goes back 10, 15 years or more.

835
00:43:53,649 --> 00:43:58,365
And that's it. We have plenty of time for questions so we have a mic here if you would

836
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,572
like to come up and ask. Thank you.

837
00:44:04,669 --> 00:44:11,014
Hi there. My name is James. So I have a question regarding recruiting for, recruiting the

838
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:18,280
testers and when does it go from targeting a type of tester to almost like discrimination. Do

839
00:44:18,461 --> 00:44:23,125
you have to worry about, for example, like sometimes I just want beginner players, right, so

840
00:44:23,145 --> 00:44:28,789
you can target that. But then let's say I want disabled players. Is that more, or sometimes

841
00:44:28,829 --> 00:44:30,071
let's say female players.

842
00:44:30,691 --> 00:44:35,013
When do you start getting into discrimination?

843
00:44:36,914 --> 00:44:39,935
Well what is the goal of your targeting, I guess?

844
00:44:41,255 --> 00:44:42,616
Why are you targeting particular...

845
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:47,418
Maybe for disabled players is to test certain accessibility features, let's say.

846
00:44:47,738 --> 00:44:47,938
Right.

847
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:54,681
Okay, in that case, like when we were at Gamba we had a game that was made for visually impaired

848
00:44:54,721 --> 00:44:54,961
people.

849
00:44:55,502 --> 00:44:56,623
And so that was what they did.

850
00:44:56,683 --> 00:44:58,744
They were looking specifically for blind people.

851
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:02,287
So it's looking for your primary demographic at that point.

852
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:05,790
So it's acceptable to do that.

853
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:09,813
The question would just be not who you're including,

854
00:45:09,853 --> 00:45:12,916
but if you're excluding people from your study,

855
00:45:13,116 --> 00:45:14,437
why are you excluding them?

856
00:45:14,717 --> 00:45:16,639
And it may be perfectly acceptable to say,

857
00:45:16,799 --> 00:45:19,221
I'm just interested in this one segment right now,

858
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:21,823
but to understand why you're doing that.

859
00:45:23,029 --> 00:45:26,892
So like newbies, maybe that's really important to say, I

860
00:45:26,912 --> 00:45:29,675
really need to understand how people who are new to games or

861
00:45:29,715 --> 00:45:31,416
this particular genre understand it.

862
00:45:31,757 --> 00:45:34,639
Because experienced players, they're going to go through it

863
00:45:34,659 --> 00:45:35,260
too fast.

864
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,761
That's not the goal of your research.

865
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:38,343
So yeah, that's perfectly fine.

866
00:45:38,543 --> 00:45:38,983
All right, thank you.

867
00:45:47,962 --> 00:45:53,963
So in the context of games that are taking high amount of risk to physically or more

868
00:45:54,003 --> 00:46:00,685
so psychologically affect a player's mental capability, is there additional legal obligations

869
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:06,266
that you should look into, like following up with a therapist afterwards, things like

870
00:46:06,286 --> 00:46:10,427
that, in the context if there is a psychological breakdown during the testing?

871
00:46:11,528 --> 00:46:12,488
That's a good question.

872
00:46:13,608 --> 00:46:16,789
Especially if you're dealing with the protected populations.

873
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:25,972
So, like, yes. Like I mentioned, you know, kids are one. Also, like, I've had a couple of

874
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:31,334
conversations with people at the conference here about pregnant women with VR because of

875
00:46:31,394 --> 00:46:35,815
problems with, like, motion sickness. Like, that can be problematic so that the large

876
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:39,436
studios will regularly ask women, like, are you pregnant or you think you're pregnant

877
00:46:39,456 --> 00:46:43,437
because you shouldn't, you know, we don't want to test with you if you're pregnant while

878
00:46:43,457 --> 00:46:45,298
playing because there could be an implication.

879
00:46:47,528 --> 00:46:53,872
Without knowing the details, it's hard to say for sure. One thing that's possible is to

880
00:46:54,092 --> 00:46:59,556
consult with somebody if you have like a university nearby, like with a psychology department or

881
00:46:59,596 --> 00:47:04,099
there's always an ethics board at the university to say like, hey, is this something that we

882
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:10,144
should think about? And if you give them the details, they'd be more able to say with

883
00:47:10,184 --> 00:47:10,644
certainty.

884
00:47:19,243 --> 00:47:19,885
No other questions?

885
00:47:22,634 --> 00:47:24,139
Okay. Thank you all for coming.

886
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:24,941
Have a good night.
