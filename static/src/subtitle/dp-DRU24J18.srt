1
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:10,081
My name is Frank Sepaldi. I kind of lead two lives, I think. There's sort of a commercial

2
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:16,625
aspect and a charity aspect. Both of them have kind of similar color schemes to their logos,

3
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:23,448
now that I'm looking at it. So I produce and direct games at a studio called Digital Eclipse,

4
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:26,010
and we're mainly known for making

5
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,412
re-releases of classic games, usually in compilation form.

6
00:00:30,432 --> 00:00:33,034
We like to think of ourselves as attempting

7
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,535
to be the sort of criterion collection of games

8
00:00:35,575 --> 00:00:38,417
to sort of contextualize titles and add bonus features, things

9
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:38,777
like that.

10
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:42,800
I also run a charity called the Video Game History Foundation.

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,061
Gamehistory.org.

12
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:45,841
Don't look right now.

13
00:00:47,642 --> 00:00:49,603
And I will talk a little bit more about that later.

14
00:00:51,164 --> 00:00:53,626
Question I know that's on everyone's mind right now,

15
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:54,666
what's up with my forehead?

16
00:00:57,484 --> 00:01:01,288
I have a cat and that's Tony.

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,496
That's Tony in his very, very expensive bed with the heating pad we put in for his comfort

18
00:01:07,556 --> 00:01:10,841
decided this morning of my talk to attack my forehead.

19
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:10,901
So...

20
00:01:13,194 --> 00:01:13,614
That's why.

21
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:16,135
All right, just a brief summary.

22
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:17,936
Here's kind of what we're talking about today.

23
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:20,558
I'm going to give you, I did a talk three years ago,

24
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:22,639
and I'll recap that real quick for you,

25
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:25,200
because this is a quasi-sequel to it.

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,901
I'm going to tell you about who it is

27
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,102
that actually plays and buys classic games.

28
00:01:30,282 --> 00:01:34,284
I think we've identified the sort of three targets of that.

29
00:01:35,104 --> 00:01:36,825
The duties of the classic game publisher,

30
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:38,646
meaning like in the commercial industry,

31
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,627
what is it we should be providing this audience?

32
00:01:41,628 --> 00:01:43,089
I'm going to tell you a little dirty secret.

33
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:44,090
Doctors hate them.

34
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:48,874
You might not know, or you might if you work with me.

35
00:01:49,754 --> 00:01:52,637
Some inspiring words, some terrifying words, and then some hopeful words.

36
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:57,861
So three years ago I gave a talk called It's Just Emulation.

37
00:01:58,542 --> 00:01:59,843
Like I said, this is kind of the sequel.

38
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:05,227
If you haven't seen it on the vault and you're watching this right now on the vault, maybe

39
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:06,088
go watch that instead.

40
00:02:06,128 --> 00:02:07,329
If you're in the room, don't leave.

41
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:08,790
I'll recap it real quick.

42
00:02:11,268 --> 00:02:16,691
The gist of it, essentially, is that old movies, old comics,

43
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:20,814
old books, old everything, music, for the most part,

44
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:24,676
if it has even minor commercial potential, is available.

45
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:25,676
You can buy it legally.

46
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,258
When it comes to games, that's really dire.

47
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,142
This is a similar slide to the last one.

48
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:38,167
Just very, very few of our notable video games from the past are available commercially.

49
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:43,191
I illustrated this with a comparison if you were there or if you watched it on the vault

50
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:48,296
by comparing Disney's DuckTales for the Nintendo Entertainment System to a John Candy movie

51
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:49,076
called Uncle Buck.

52
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:57,381
Uncle Buck is available on like 30,000 digital services from startups you've never heard of and all the ones you have also

53
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:58,181
It's even on

54
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:00,603
video game console

55
00:03:00,803 --> 00:03:04,385
Services right like like on the PlayStation in the Xbox you could buy Uncle Buck

56
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:09,488
Disney's Ducktales had, at the time, been out of print since 1989.

57
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:15,331
And I think it's because we largely demonized as an industry the notion of emulation.

58
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:23,156
Back in 1997, when emulation kind of became a viable technology on the internet, the industry

59
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:26,579
basically freaked out and went after it legally.

60
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:32,242
Nintendo put some text on their website calling it the greatest threat to date to the intellectual

61
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:33,743
property of video game developers.

62
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:38,165
You know, a few, like Kinectix got taken to court by Sony.

63
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,387
Unsuccessfully, I might add.

64
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:45,789
No video game emulator challenged in court has ever been ruled illegal.

65
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:46,969
Emulation's fine.

66
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:52,212
But despite that, to this day, that's a screencap from Nintendo.com that's still there.

67
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:58,815
But because we demonized it instead of embracing it, I argued that emulation...

68
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:03,435
Instead of becoming the tool that we used as an industry,

69
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:07,875
because it is the best tool for keeping older games in print

70
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:10,176
in a cost effective and accurate way,

71
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:13,896
instead of embracing that, we demonized it.

72
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:17,397
And because of that, I think two things happened.

73
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,857
I think old games kind of became

74
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,558
the domain of the pirates, right?

75
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:23,218
So people started thinking of games

76
00:04:23,258 --> 00:04:25,398
the way we thought of MP3s in the Napster days, right?

77
00:04:25,418 --> 00:04:27,099
Where it's like music's just free now, who cares?

78
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:28,419
And...

79
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:35,023
We also, I think, by not getting ahead of it and getting these games back in print through

80
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:38,445
emulation, I think for a lot of games it's kind of too late now.

81
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,447
I think a lot of the legal rights are just never going to be cleared up for a lot of

82
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:41,647
games.

83
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:47,231
And while, yeah, it is a means of piracy, like I said, it's just the best tool we have.

84
00:04:47,772 --> 00:04:50,173
I liken it to film even, right?

85
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:50,954
So filmâ€¦

86
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:55,925
When a company wants to re-release a film,

87
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:58,146
they basically just have to digitize it the once.

88
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:01,808
And once you have a digital copy of a film,

89
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:04,029
you just convert it to different video codecs.

90
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,431
We've all heard that term in this room, codecs, right?

91
00:05:08,572 --> 00:05:10,993
But we don't seem to understand that there

92
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:13,015
is an equivalent of that with video games.

93
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:14,696
And ultimately, I don't really see

94
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:17,237
the difference between a video codec and a game emulator.

95
00:05:17,257 --> 00:05:18,798
And if we were to think of it that way,

96
00:05:18,858 --> 00:05:20,939
perhaps we could stop the bleeding.

97
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:22,220
We could get things back in print.

98
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,581
Like I said, I think the damage has largely been done, but I do think we can stop the

99
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:30,562
bleeding a little bit if we embrace the emulator loudly and proudly.

100
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:31,602
Emulation's the king.

101
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:36,463
I recommended at the time that we start taking open source emulation as an industry a little

102
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:37,263
more seriously.

103
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:42,924
I pointed out that MAME, which used to stand for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator, I forget

104
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:47,705
what it stands for now, but it is essentially a video codec for video game machines.

105
00:05:48,005 --> 00:05:55,667
And I suggest that we start taking that a little more seriously, especially now that it is open source and most of its components are available to use commercially.

106
00:05:56,447 --> 00:06:02,869
What I didn't mention at the time was that while we're at it, maybe we should be contributing back to this fantastic resource instead of just taking from it.

107
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:08,230
We all caught up? Good? Getting your chronogens? Let's go three years in the future to today.

108
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,071
What's been happening these last three years since that talk?

109
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:14,141
Hey, someone did it!

110
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:16,602
A company actually did embrace open source emulation.

111
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:18,903
This is Sony's PlayStation Classic.

112
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:22,365
It uses an emulator called PCSX,

113
00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:24,485
specifically the re-armed branch of it.

114
00:06:25,006 --> 00:06:25,706
To me, this is huge.

115
00:06:25,746 --> 00:06:28,347
It meant Sony was admitting that an emulator

116
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,988
written by the community was good enough, right?

117
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:34,229
Like this is Sony saying, hey, this is good enough

118
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:38,631
that this has the godfather blessing, right?

119
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:42,653
This is a real PlayStation game, this open source emulator.

120
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:46,977
So yay, good, right? Well, it didn't really work out that well.

121
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:52,103
The product had a lot of issues, which is a shame.

122
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:56,188
It's just that this particular emulator I don't think was the right tool for this job.

123
00:06:56,608 --> 00:06:58,130
And they also, I don't think, like...

124
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:04,212
fixed it, you know, because it didn't entirely support all of these games and they also made

125
00:07:04,232 --> 00:07:09,476
some weird decisions in terms of like putting PAL games on an NTSC console, stuff like that.

126
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:15,662
So that kind of sucked because it, on the one hand, it was, you know, yay, we're acknowledging

127
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:21,126
this community of authors is doing work that is good enough to sell, but at the same time

128
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:25,931
where it sort of took a hit, I think, because of public perception of this product.

129
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:30,254
Nintendo sold you Super Mario Bros. again, and again.

130
00:07:30,614 --> 00:07:32,535
Actually three times in the last three years.

131
00:07:35,197 --> 00:07:36,458
Oh my god, Sonic Mania.

132
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:37,699
You guys play Sonic Mania?

133
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,741
Oh my god, that game blew me away.

134
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:44,748
doesn't directly have anything to do with emulation,

135
00:07:44,808 --> 00:07:47,571
but it would not have been possible without emulation.

136
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:50,073
The core team of this game actually

137
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:54,076
got their start modifying original Sonic the Hedgehog

138
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:56,999
games using, you know.

139
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,763
emulators and easily available ROM files for these original games. That's how they reverse

140
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:09,750
engineered the system and that's how they basically were able to copy Yuji Naka's

141
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,554
Sonic engine and make new things with it is because they had access to these open tools

142
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:18,838
and to the ROMs themselves. They could stumble into those and learn and get inspired.

143
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:25,021
Amazing! I don't think that's likely to happen anymore because easy access to ROM files was

144
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:28,663
also taken away from us recently, the last three years, actually just a few months ago.

145
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:36,467
You guys probably saw this story, right? Like Nintendo successfully won a suit against

146
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:43,551
Love ROMs and it caused this ripple effect on the internet where a lot of...

147
00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:45,892
I have a question already, sure.

148
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:50,639
But it looks like it, the quote,

149
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:53,161
quains does not mean they'll actually hurt it.

150
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:55,783
It's more like sending it in two.

151
00:08:57,338 --> 00:09:00,939
Okay, so the statement from the audience was that it was more of an intimidation message.

152
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:05,421
Yeah, I think that's true. Like, they didn't actually win $12 million from these guys.

153
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:10,083
It was settled out of court. But the point being that this caused a really unfortunate ripple

154
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:17,165
effect where, yeah, a lot of the commercially viable product you can't find online anymore,

155
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:21,987
which is fine, of course. Yeah, that's your property. You know, go after that. But...

156
00:09:22,825 --> 00:09:26,326
It also meant that every other video game ever made that had nothing to do with Nintendo

157
00:09:26,386 --> 00:09:28,927
is kind of hard to find now, so that was really unfortunate.

158
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:32,128
Nintendo's Boogeyman Tex is still up there.

159
00:09:32,748 --> 00:09:35,989
In fact, we're about to celebrate the 20-year anniversary of...

160
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:37,709
Any day now.

161
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,771
We couldn't substantiate it quite to the exact date because the Wayback Machine didn't scrape

162
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:42,871
down.

163
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:44,431
you know, daily back then or anything.

164
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:46,232
But actually, I noticed something

165
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,152
when I took the screen cap.

166
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:50,252
So this is 20 years ago.

167
00:09:50,553 --> 00:09:53,033
The introduction of video game emulators

168
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,194
represents the greatest threat to date, blah, blah, blah.

169
00:09:55,314 --> 00:09:56,054
Everything's terrible.

170
00:09:56,754 --> 00:10:00,055
Sometime around 2006, they actually, oh,

171
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:00,595
I don't have it here.

172
00:10:00,615 --> 00:10:03,255
But sometimes around 2006, they added the text,

173
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:07,456
emulators used to play illegal copies of Nintendo games.

174
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:09,917
So they actually added that text right around when they

175
00:10:09,937 --> 00:10:11,237
launched an emulator service.

176
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:11,717
So that's cute.

177
00:10:14,318 --> 00:10:15,639
This is kind of an interesting thing.

178
00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:18,061
This hasn't come out yet, but this is AntStream.

179
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:23,645
This is a company that's building, you know, like a, basically like the notion of a video

180
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:25,126
codec that you deploy to, right?

181
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:28,888
This is a platform for classic games, sort of your Netflix for games play.

182
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,430
I think these guys are out of the UK.

183
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,771
You can tell because Speedball 2 is the game up front.

184
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:42,797
And as for me, actually, something I said three years ago was that I felt that the only

185
00:10:43,698 --> 00:10:49,921
path toward accuracy, toward doing these games justice, was to do a one-to-one copy of a

186
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:50,502
game, right?

187
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:53,043
That it should be warts and all exactly as it was.

188
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:56,707
and some products over the last three years have caused me to start rethinking that.

189
00:10:57,227 --> 00:11:01,632
Do you guys know this? Wonder Boy the Dragon's Trap? This is by Lizard Cube. This was a

190
00:11:02,232 --> 00:11:06,857
remastering of Wonder Boy 3 the Dragon's Trap on the Master System.

191
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:14,483
And it did a really good job of translating that old game and giving it modern flourishes,

192
00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:17,005
you know, beyond the HD graphics and stuff like that.

193
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:22,329
I think an even better example, no comment on the game itself, but Night Trap 25th Anniversary

194
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:22,609
and all that.

195
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:22,890
But, yeah.

196
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,530
I'll leave it at that.

197
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:23,730
Thank you.

198
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,971
Thank you.

199
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:24,231
Thanks.

200
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:24,391
Bye.

201
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:29,876
added so many quality of life features that it is like undeniably a better game than you

202
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:32,538
could have played on the Sega CD or whatever back in the day.

203
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:38,303
It's not only better now, I think it might even be reflecting artistic intent of the

204
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,165
original more than the original did.

205
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:42,927
So I've been thinking a lot about that lately.

206
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:47,771
As for Digital Eclipse, we released a few more products, including bringing DuckTales

207
00:11:47,811 --> 00:11:48,352
back in print.

208
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:51,575
That was actually complete coincidence

209
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:53,777
that that was the game that I chose three years ago

210
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:55,339
and that it ended up being our next project.

211
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,680
So you're welcome.

212
00:11:59,163 --> 00:12:01,525
Thank you, one person who clapped for DuckTales.

213
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:06,040
We also expanded our scope at Digital Eclipse quite a bit,

214
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,661
and we started working on these deluxe anniversary packages.

215
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:10,682
So Street Fighter 30th was a collection

216
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:13,563
focused on the original mainline Street Fighter arcade games.

217
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:16,004
SNK 40th came out last year.

218
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:18,184
It's what I like to call a playable documentary

219
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:22,586
about what I think was a strange and wonderful little developer

220
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:23,466
called SNK in the 1980s.

221
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:26,167
This is sort of a snapshot of what

222
00:12:26,227 --> 00:12:28,808
they were before the Neo Geo system was

223
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:29,469
introduced in the 1990s.

224
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:30,009
And they pivoted.

225
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:36,734
that way entirely. We're going to get back to that later. But these last three years,

226
00:12:36,774 --> 00:12:43,080
we started thinking a lot about who buys this stuff, right? Who is the consumer of a classic

227
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:50,146
game re-release? And I think we can basically narrow it down to three main groups. Of course,

228
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:54,871
we're missing some here. You have your casual player, right? This is someone who...

229
00:12:56,254 --> 00:12:58,595
you know, just sees the game on the store and is like, oh,

230
00:12:58,675 --> 00:13:00,136
cool, Metal Slug or whatever, right?

231
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:02,417
Like, this is someone who probably has a kid.

232
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:02,757
I don't know.

233
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,899
And this is just sort of the impulse purchase,

234
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:09,260
slight nostalgia kind of person, right?

235
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,801
Your next tier up is your sort of collector type, right?

236
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:18,464
This is someone who probably identifies as a retro gamer,

237
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:18,724
right?

238
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:21,145
Like, probably still has shelves full of old cartridge

239
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:21,725
games and stuff.

240
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:24,826
And they kind of almost, in a lot of ways,

241
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:25,066
I think.

242
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:29,168
vote with their dollar toward the idea of old games being around.

243
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:31,249
So that's sort of the second tier market.

244
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,991
Your third market's kind of strange.

245
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:36,792
This is your really hardcore market.

246
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:42,835
So this is the kind of consumer that is...

247
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:47,557
Thank you for laughing.

248
00:13:47,597 --> 00:13:48,898
I thought it was funny too.

249
00:13:54,407 --> 00:13:59,152
This is your consumer who just knows way too much about this stuff, and it just wants more right?

250
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:01,794
It's like no, I already have access to these games

251
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:06,559
I know how to use maim if you're just selling me the ROM again like I'm not giving you eight bucks for this arcade game

252
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:10,823
That I've barely heard of I can just play it for free, and it's it's just as good as your emulator

253
00:14:11,503 --> 00:14:13,305
I probably is actually main, but we'll get to that

254
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:18,650
So you know these three audiences, I think

255
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:24,800
I think one and two can graduate forward, right?

256
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,803
I think that a casual type can become a retro gamer,

257
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:29,384
can become a hardcore weirdo,

258
00:14:30,706 --> 00:14:32,407
but I don't think there's a backwards.

259
00:14:32,768 --> 00:14:35,550
And I also think that groups one and two, no matter what,

260
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:40,255
are capped by their personal nostalgia, right?

261
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:41,616
For things that they grew up with.

262
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:44,098
Whereas I think number three,

263
00:14:44,539 --> 00:14:46,300
I think is a much more sustainable audience.

264
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,502
I think that's an audience that you can grow.

265
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:50,624
I think that's an audience that you can educate

266
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:52,246
on wanting this kind of product.

267
00:14:52,286 --> 00:14:54,848
And that's the kind of hardcore audience

268
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:56,089
that we targeted Digital Eclipse.

269
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:57,671
And I think that's what we should all be targeting.

270
00:14:57,811 --> 00:15:01,213
in this industry because it applies to every possible consumer.

271
00:15:02,054 --> 00:15:04,796
But let me tell you about group number three, the hardcore.

272
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:06,617
The hardcore play hard. All right.

273
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:10,059
Like like we can do so many things

274
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:13,581
without the industry interacting with us at all.

275
00:15:13,601 --> 00:15:14,562
I mean, we can download.

276
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:15,943
Every game ever, right?

277
00:15:15,963 --> 00:15:18,686
Like it's super easy to just go download a mame set

278
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:22,229
and you have all of arcade history in front of you playable.

279
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,271
We have emulators on our computers.

280
00:15:24,311 --> 00:15:26,473
We can, if we want a really terrible experience,

281
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,454
we can have, you know, touch screen,

282
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:31,297
like PlayStation emulators on our phones and stuff.

283
00:15:32,978 --> 00:15:34,259
we don't even need emulation, right?

284
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:38,520
We're in an era now where we can use our original hardware

285
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:41,281
and we can load entire system libraries

286
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,502
on one single cartridge and just Tannel Surf

287
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:45,723
every Sega Genesis game ever made easily.

288
00:15:46,223 --> 00:15:48,504
And while we're in that original hardware,

289
00:15:48,524 --> 00:15:50,485
we're like enhancing it, right?

290
00:15:50,505 --> 00:15:53,246
This is the MSU-1 core.

291
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,086
It's a demonstration of it on the Super Nintendo.

292
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:58,207
This is actually, this is Arthur Bew,

293
00:15:59,348 --> 00:16:02,411
basically created a hardware add-on for the Super Nintendo

294
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:07,316
to add full motion video and CD quality audio,

295
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:08,017
stuff like that.

296
00:16:08,637 --> 00:16:10,960
So people have made the definitive Chrono Trigger

297
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,421
that has the PlayStation features

298
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:14,003
without the load times and stuff like that.

299
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:15,484
Oh, we're playing on like.

300
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,027
beautiful RGB professional monitors from the 80s

301
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:21,649
and the most perfect display possible.

302
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,553
People, because of this hobby, are figuring out

303
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:30,096
how to hack old consumer CRTs to get the best picture out

304
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:30,397
of them.

305
00:16:30,777 --> 00:16:32,979
No one's died yet, but my god, please be careful.

306
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,604
We're like building arcade machines and we have been since the 90s that has everything on it.

307
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:46,270
You know, there's even like new hardware being created to play these games in an accurate way

308
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,313
in HD. This is the Mega SG, which actually mine just shipped this morning. That's how

309
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:53,456
new this is. I just got the alert this morning. This is a, a, a

310
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,759
Basically, it's Sega Genesis natively inside,

311
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,560
spitting out 1080p clean picture.

312
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,462
And they do this through what's called an FPGA,

313
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,564
a Field Programmable Gate Array.

314
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:05,024
Is that right?

315
00:17:05,064 --> 00:17:06,025
Yeah.

316
00:17:06,145 --> 00:17:08,507
And the idea being that it's not even software emulation

317
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,227
at this point.

318
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:12,710
It is a chip that reconfigures itself to be a Sega,

319
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,692
so it's just hyper-accurate.

320
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:17,273
And we're even getting into open source now.

321
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,535
This is a build of what's called the Mr. Project.

322
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:20,376
Has anyone heard of this?

323
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:23,519
Yeah, yeah, I see a couple enthusiasts for the mister.

324
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,885
So this is like an open source FPGA retro console using off the shelf parts that are

325
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:30,366
like fairly affordable.

326
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:34,251
So you know, we don't, we don't need, we don't even need, we don't need emulators, we don't

327
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:35,412
even need the original consoles.

328
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:38,395
We have, we can build hardware that replicates the hardware.

329
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:40,296
without anyone, right?

330
00:17:40,697 --> 00:17:42,698
And we don't even need the commercial games.

331
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,120
We can translate games that no one bothered to translate,

332
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,201
and in these cases, damn well should have,

333
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:50,103
and we can play through them.

334
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:51,263
We don't need to wait for,

335
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:53,065
we don't need to yell at Reggie Fils-AimÃ©

336
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:55,766
to translate Mother 3, just do it, who cares, right?

337
00:17:56,527 --> 00:17:58,768
Not even translations, we're modifying games, right?

338
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:01,850
Like TecmoBowl.org, these guys for 12 years

339
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:04,232
have been upgrading Tecmo Bowl.

340
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:09,154
Uh, not only have they been upgrading the NFL rosters, they're like adding new NFL teams

341
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:09,975
as they're created.

342
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:11,456
They're like adding new NFL rules.

343
00:18:11,476 --> 00:18:13,116
They are maintaining Tecmo Bowl.

344
00:18:13,136 --> 00:18:15,317
We don't need whatever Tecmo is right now.

345
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:16,398
I don't even know if Tecmo exists.

346
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,220
But you know, we don't need the industry to like do things like that.

347
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,281
We're doing it on our own.

348
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:24,262
Uh, the middle picture, like we're.

349
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:28,543
We're basically correcting mistakes of the past even, like remastering in a sense.

350
00:18:28,603 --> 00:18:32,985
So like when Donkey Kong Country was ported to the Game Boy Advance, you remember the

351
00:18:33,005 --> 00:18:34,925
thing didn't have any backlight on it, right?

352
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:38,846
So people had to alter the color palette so you could actually see the damn thing.

353
00:18:39,426 --> 00:18:44,308
But you know, because we don't play on the actual thing anymore, people are fixing the

354
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:44,808
games, right?

355
00:18:44,828 --> 00:18:46,248
To run on modern platforms.

356
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:49,490
They're modifying the games to add or replace content.

357
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:54,291
This is Rollchon, which replaces Mega Man with his sister in the game, which is super

358
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:54,571
cool.

359
00:18:54,951 --> 00:18:58,513
Yes, I tried to get that in Mega Man Legacy Collection, but the author didn't reply to

360
00:18:58,533 --> 00:18:58,593
me.

361
00:18:58,613 --> 00:18:59,393
I think they didn't believe me.

362
00:19:01,392 --> 00:19:03,853
But we don't even need human-authored stuff anymore.

363
00:19:04,054 --> 00:19:07,395
We're building randomizers that modify and change

364
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:09,996
the game in a perfectly playable way every time.

365
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,197
And this is getting huge.

366
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:16,380
We are building the tools now also to start

367
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,560
reverse engineering games.

368
00:19:18,341 --> 00:19:20,382
and figuring out how they work and tinkering with them.

369
00:19:20,402 --> 00:19:23,284
So this is a disassembly of the original Super Mario Brothers

370
00:19:23,884 --> 00:19:26,226
with commented code, which is awesome.

371
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:29,148
And people are like taking that and porting that to C

372
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:31,430
and are and are figuring out how these games work

373
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,370
and the mysteries behind them.

374
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,931
And they're finding.

375
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:36,974
bugs in like Super Mario Brothers and fixing them because it turns out there was like a

376
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:41,578
copy paste error that caused the spiny balls to behave in a way that they weren't meant

377
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,901
to and we're discovering that with all these emulator tools.

378
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:48,344
And again, this is not something the industry provides.

379
00:19:48,664 --> 00:19:51,707
We can't replicate a lot of this in the commercial industry.

380
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:56,451
I can't make anything look as good as one of those CRT monitors as my beautiful Sony

381
00:19:56,471 --> 00:19:56,811
PVM 2530.

382
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:57,952
That's how I roll, by the way.

383
00:20:01,095 --> 00:20:02,815
We can't we can't eliminate input lag.

384
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:06,736
OK, that that's the thing that will be chasing that forever.

385
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:11,358
It's in the world of software emulation versus these original pieces

386
00:20:11,398 --> 00:20:12,898
of hardware running on a CRT.

387
00:20:12,918 --> 00:20:16,779
There's nothing preventing your your button press

388
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:19,440
from from immediately reflecting on the screen.

389
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,981
But but with modern hardware, that's just inherent.

390
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:25,362
We can't defy the laws of physics, so we can't give you an experience like that.

391
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:28,103
We can't clear up the legal issues for most games.

392
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:29,463
Like we're never going to see like

393
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:34,307
Home Alone on the Super Nintendo, like, ever again, right? Like, based on the Tim Allen show.

394
00:20:34,387 --> 00:20:38,011
Like, that's just never gonna happen. I don't know why that one.

395
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,977
We can't provide infinite variety. We can't give you every game ever made, right? We can't do it

396
00:20:43,997 --> 00:20:52,144
for literally free, you know? Like, so, well, what can we do, right? I think there's a lot we can do.

397
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:56,907
I think we can curate these experiences that we're giving to people.

398
00:20:56,927 --> 00:20:59,871
I think this is actually maybe the most important.

399
00:20:59,911 --> 00:21:03,516
Because we're the commercial industry, because we're working with the rights holders, we

400
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:07,642
can theoretically provide behind-the-scenes access to help contextualize these things.

401
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:12,864
Or, you know, we can talk to the original authors to sort of ask them their intent and

402
00:21:12,924 --> 00:21:14,484
restore the games to their liking.

403
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:17,445
We can put out titles that no one's seen before.

404
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:21,206
Previously on Released Works, Nintendo did that with Star Fox 2, which was so cool.

405
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,947
They put it on their SNES Classic.

406
00:21:24,687 --> 00:21:25,969
We can offer new play modes for the games.

407
00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:28,332
I mean, they're already doing that, too, but we can sort of author them,

408
00:21:29,474 --> 00:21:31,757
you know, with perhaps the original creators. Right.

409
00:21:32,397 --> 00:21:34,700
We can offer thoughtful improvements to the games.

410
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:38,345
We can we can do all kinds of stuff that people can't necessarily

411
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:41,509
do in the community as a commercial industry.

412
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:41,729
And.

413
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,031
We should be.

414
00:21:43,411 --> 00:21:44,833
Like, we're getting paid for this, right?

415
00:21:44,873 --> 00:21:45,834
Like, this is our jobs.

416
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:47,937
We should be providing a better experience

417
00:21:47,957 --> 00:21:49,999
than people can get for free if they happen

418
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:51,040
to be pirates or whatever.

419
00:21:52,181 --> 00:21:53,583
And a lot of companies, not just us,

420
00:21:53,843 --> 00:21:56,666
are doing things like this to enhance their experiences,

421
00:21:56,706 --> 00:21:57,407
like M2.

422
00:21:58,188 --> 00:21:59,049
M2's out of Japan.

423
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,931
Oh my god, I have a crush on M2.

424
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:04,114
These guys are amazing.

425
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:07,455
The list of cool stuff they've done is really long.

426
00:22:08,475 --> 00:22:11,716
The most recent one is Phantasy Star.

427
00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:13,216
I forget what they called it,

428
00:22:13,236 --> 00:22:15,077
but it was the Phantasy Star remake on the Switch.

429
00:22:16,557 --> 00:22:19,678
And this release just did an amazing job

430
00:22:20,478 --> 00:22:22,338
of modernizing this game.

431
00:22:22,378 --> 00:22:26,119
This is a classic RPG with random encounters on the map.

432
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:28,860
So they, because we don't play like that anymore,

433
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,420
you know, we don't,

434
00:22:30,554 --> 00:22:34,897
have one cartridge that we play for a month and like, you know, like they reduce the random

435
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:40,080
encounter rate and they increase the experience you get. So you play it a lot less, but you're

436
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:46,805
getting the exact same experience, just less of it. They, they modernized it without actually

437
00:22:46,905 --> 00:22:51,288
modifying. They just tweaked it, right? They let you speed the game up because the walking

438
00:22:51,308 --> 00:22:55,551
speed was a little bit slow. They added this auto mapping feature and these stupid first

439
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:59,674
person dungeons that no one likes anymore. Well, they have their fans, I guess, just

440
00:22:59,714 --> 00:22:59,955
not me.

441
00:23:00,663 --> 00:23:00,785
Um...

442
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:06,770
But, you know, and what I like about this is that I am a Fantasy Star fan.

443
00:23:06,871 --> 00:23:09,252
I've played through Fantasy Star actually multiple times.

444
00:23:09,632 --> 00:23:11,814
I've worked on one of the translation patches for it actually.

445
00:23:12,794 --> 00:23:18,438
But I know as a Fantasy Star fan, having played through this, that to me they didn't really

446
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:19,339
change the game.

447
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:20,179
You know what I mean?

448
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,821
Like, they in a way I think translated it.

449
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,723
Like they translated it for modern audiences and I thought that was really cool.

450
00:23:26,443 --> 00:23:28,665
I mentioned Wonder Boy the Dragon's Trap earlier.

451
00:23:30,446 --> 00:23:34,952
Something I really liked about it, other than, you know, kind of did the same stuff as Phantasy

452
00:23:34,972 --> 00:23:40,359
Star where Lizardcube updated the game to be a little more accessible to modern players.

453
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:44,224
They upped the frame rate from 30 to 60, which means I'll never go back to the original.

454
00:23:46,274 --> 00:23:52,280
But what I like that they did is that typically when you get like an HD remaster of a game,

455
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,283
I think the notion is like, no, those old graphics, those are done.

456
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:58,385
This is what it's supposed to look like, right?

457
00:23:58,406 --> 00:23:59,166
And I hate that.

458
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:04,952
But what LizardCube did instead was like almost an artistic remix, like a reimagining, not

459
00:24:04,972 --> 00:24:07,114
a remastering of the graphics.

460
00:24:07,134 --> 00:24:08,095
And I thought that was great.

461
00:24:09,937 --> 00:24:12,779
Double Fine does really cool stuff with the LucasArts adventure games.

462
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,583
I think these projects are phenomenal because the teams have actual direct access to a lot of the

463
00:24:17,643 --> 00:24:22,507
core staff who worked on these games, including Tim Schafer, who runs a studio, was the director

464
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:27,992
of Full Throttle. But even the art directors and things like that, they have a lot of direct access

465
00:24:28,012 --> 00:24:33,317
so they can ask, what were these ambiguous pixels supposed to be and get an answer and can draw the

466
00:24:33,497 --> 00:24:36,700
art appropriately. Excuse me one second.

467
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,912
I just spilled water down my chin.

468
00:24:41,952 --> 00:24:42,352
That was great.

469
00:24:44,173 --> 00:24:46,034
Our latest was SNK 40th.

470
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:49,597
Unlike these guys above, we don't really

471
00:24:49,637 --> 00:24:51,758
get the opportunity to focus on one game at a time,

472
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,319
but we tend to make packages.

473
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,340
This one in particular, like I said,

474
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,922
was a snapshot of what this company was in the 80s,

475
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,564
instead of a remastering of a game.

476
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:04,446
So we approached things a little bit differently than M2 or Lizard

477
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:05,467
Cube or Double Fine.

478
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,133
So our goals with the project.

479
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:16,030
Unlike Mega Man, Street Fighter, Disney, these weren't IP that had an instant commercial

480
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:16,471
appeal.

481
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:21,055
So, it was kind of our job, I thought, to sort of make people care about this stuff,

482
00:25:21,775 --> 00:25:25,819
which isn't impossible because SNK does have really hardcore fans.

483
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:32,364
They just tend to be fans of the 90s and more current SNK content, not the 80s stuff.

484
00:25:32,424 --> 00:25:37,048
But this gave us an opportunity to say, hey, SNK fans, here's the roots of this company.

485
00:25:38,895 --> 00:25:45,402
We also, it was our duty, we thought to sort of alter the gameplay of some of these games

486
00:25:45,442 --> 00:25:50,907
to modernize it in a way that was more understandable and to reinterpret the controls, which I'll

487
00:25:50,927 --> 00:25:51,748
get to in a minute.

488
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,712
But first I got a video up here somewhere.

489
00:25:55,832 --> 00:25:56,393
There we go.

490
00:25:58,094 --> 00:25:58,415
All right.

491
00:26:03,252 --> 00:26:09,602
So this is a demonstration of what we're kind of known for our extra material in these games,

492
00:26:09,642 --> 00:26:13,628
right? We do a little bit more in the games. We kind of give you the original packaging artwork

493
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:16,112
and things like that. And in SNK's case,

494
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:19,976
They made like 60 games in the 80s.

495
00:26:21,277 --> 00:26:24,278
We'd still be working on this project if we did all 60 games.

496
00:26:24,578 --> 00:26:25,859
So we kind of curated the collection.

497
00:26:25,899 --> 00:26:29,861
But but I wanted to at least show what all the other games were. Right.

498
00:26:29,901 --> 00:26:33,043
So this is actually a complete list of every game that SNK game

499
00:26:33,163 --> 00:26:34,723
that SNK had done in the 80s.

500
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:36,504
And for each one of these,

501
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:41,667
if if art exists, we put it in there like it literally exists in the world.

502
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:46,069
You can, of course, do your zooming and stuff and and and and go in on there.

503
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:50,501
We got the screen test of the games, but each one of these also has a little bit of a history

504
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:53,550
lesson and it kind of comes across as like...

505
00:26:54,742 --> 00:26:57,944
an interactive art book about the history of SNK.

506
00:26:58,345 --> 00:27:01,326
And this was our way of capturing that

507
00:27:01,366 --> 00:27:04,168
because a lot of this history has just never been talked

508
00:27:04,228 --> 00:27:05,729
about even by SNK.

509
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,111
A lot of these guys are not getting any younger.

510
00:27:09,552 --> 00:27:13,534
And so we wanted to sort of educate the consumer

511
00:27:13,614 --> 00:27:15,195
on what this company was and give you

512
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:18,637
the definitive package, like here was SNK in the 80s.

513
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:22,380
So that was our approach with the museum content.

514
00:27:25,128 --> 00:27:28,589
But we also added a feature that...

515
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:31,209
Oh wait, that is the same video.

516
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:32,549
That is not what we want to do.

517
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,750
Excuse me a moment, folks.

518
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:51,593
Okay, so this is sort of the game selection menu.

519
00:27:53,670 --> 00:28:02,095
So another thing we did with this collection is that for all the titles in here, like POW,

520
00:28:02,235 --> 00:28:05,136
for example, we included all the regional versions of it.

521
00:28:05,637 --> 00:28:09,359
And we included the home console version as well, if there was one, which I think is really

522
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:10,339
important actually, because it...

523
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,842
tells you a little bit more about that game to know how they approached a home version of it.

524
00:28:17,882 --> 00:28:22,924
Like in SNK's case, most of their home versions actually added features that the arcade games

525
00:28:22,944 --> 00:28:28,746
didn't have, made them a little more RPG-like even. And even internally, this was a little

526
00:28:28,766 --> 00:28:32,307
bit of a struggle because I think that a lot of companies are like, oh, why would you do the

527
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:36,849
inferior version of the game, right? But for us, it's like, no, we're historians, right? We're

528
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:40,970
trying to explain what your company was and we should include all of that stuff.

529
00:28:42,191 --> 00:28:45,176
Luckily, they went for it.

530
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:48,300
But a feature that we added...

531
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:52,890
I don't think it's crazy to say that people like watching people play video games.

532
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,292
Have we proven that out yet?

533
00:28:56,513 --> 00:28:59,375
So we wanted to make these games as accessible as we could.

534
00:28:59,395 --> 00:29:03,559
We didn't want to just throw you in an 80s arcade and say, good luck, kid, right?

535
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:08,423
Like we wanted you to be able to access this content without being good at old video games.

536
00:29:08,864 --> 00:29:11,546
And so if you want, you can just watch the games.

537
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:17,568
So this is a playthrough, it's actually a fairly tool-assisted playthrough of me being

538
00:29:17,628 --> 00:29:20,909
more awesome than I actually am at playing these games.

539
00:29:21,389 --> 00:29:23,529
But like a movie, you can scrub through it, right?

540
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:27,110
And you can go in there, you can pause, you can frame advance, you can frame rewind.

541
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,911
It's all pixel perfect because this isn't a video, it's actually a button playback of

542
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:32,411
the movie.

543
00:29:33,311 --> 00:29:38,633
So every frame, or maybe three frames, we're capturing basically a save state and then

544
00:29:38,673 --> 00:29:41,393
the button presses that come after it, and that's how we're able to scrub through it

545
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:41,733
like that.

546
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:42,727
Um...

547
00:29:43,928 --> 00:29:45,348
And because we did it that way,

548
00:29:46,548 --> 00:29:48,709
you don't have to just watch it forever.

549
00:29:48,729 --> 00:29:49,729
You don't have to be passive.

550
00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:51,510
You can actually just start playing

551
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,210
because that's just a save state, right?

552
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,891
So, to us, this was a way of letting you

553
00:29:57,051 --> 00:29:59,751
just flip through the game like it was a book

554
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:01,612
and access whatever content you want to.

555
00:30:01,672 --> 00:30:06,893
And that was a fairly low-tech-ish way.

556
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:10,094
I say low-tech and Adam, the programmer,

557
00:30:10,114 --> 00:30:11,854
is probably screaming if he's watching this.

558
00:30:14,515 --> 00:30:19,338
But, you know, it was our way of letting you access these parts of the game without having

559
00:30:19,378 --> 00:30:21,980
to heavily modify a binary file, right?

560
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:27,484
But I think what was maybe the most important thing we did was reinterpreting some of the

561
00:30:27,524 --> 00:30:32,527
original arcade controls so that they made sense, not just to a modern player, but to

562
00:30:32,547 --> 00:30:34,308
a modern player on a modern controller.

563
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,871
This is a rotary joystick.

564
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:38,891
It's called the loop lever.

565
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,332
SNK was known for this in the 80s.

566
00:30:41,932 --> 00:30:44,493
So just imagine this on an arcade machine.

567
00:30:46,114 --> 00:30:47,654
You tilt it like normal to move.

568
00:30:47,754 --> 00:30:48,635
It's a joystick, right?

569
00:30:48,655 --> 00:30:51,536
But you actually rotate the stick to aim.

570
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:54,997
So, you know, here's Ikari Warriors, for example.

571
00:30:55,917 --> 00:30:57,118
There's only two buttons in the game.

572
00:30:57,878 --> 00:31:00,439
And you would, and they were nice enough

573
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,059
to do a left and right hand configuration,

574
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:02,540
which is kind of cool.

575
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,525
But you would tilt to move your character around and you would twist to aim your gun

576
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:09,526
and fire at people.

577
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:13,830
And so playing Ikari Warriors, you know, is supposed to kind of look like this, right?

578
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:19,856
Like you're able to sort of muscle memory your way in the original arcade game to be

579
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:22,739
able to, you know, fire three o'clock and then point straight back up.

580
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:30,552
Typically when this game has been re-released in the past, the way that that's been accomplished

581
00:31:30,632 --> 00:31:35,794
is to sort of map rotate clockwise and rotate counterclockwise to buttons and it just doesn't

582
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:36,374
work that well.

583
00:31:36,454 --> 00:31:41,316
It doesn't feel like Ikari Warriors anymore and I actually think that the reason that

584
00:31:41,356 --> 00:31:46,117
fans don't talk about these games is because the only access we have had to them traditionally

585
00:31:46,177 --> 00:31:50,099
is through means like MAME where they don't play the way they're supposed to so they're

586
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:50,299
not fun.

587
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:57,034
So for our game, it may sound simple on paper,

588
00:31:57,074 --> 00:31:59,075
but we made it essentially a twin-stick shooter.

589
00:31:59,435 --> 00:32:03,097
So we're emulating the game just as it is on one layer,

590
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:04,977
but there's an abstraction layer above it.

591
00:32:06,918 --> 00:32:09,119
So for example, if the player points straight down

592
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:11,960
on the R stick, our abstraction layer

593
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,741
will tell the game, hey, change your game state

594
00:32:15,222 --> 00:32:16,862
so that the player is pointing straight down.

595
00:32:17,783 --> 00:32:20,404
There's no point straight down function

596
00:32:20,444 --> 00:32:21,684
in the original game, which is why

597
00:32:21,704 --> 00:32:23,045
we had to sort of interrupt the game.

598
00:32:23,805 --> 00:32:24,486
to tell it that.

599
00:32:25,227 --> 00:32:28,189
So essentially, we, I think, made Ikari Warriors

600
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:31,673
playable for the first time since its arcade origins.

601
00:32:32,153 --> 00:32:33,274
So that makes sense, right?

602
00:32:33,394 --> 00:32:33,895
Easy to do.

603
00:32:34,675 --> 00:32:35,896
Hydrate's actually a good idea.

604
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:37,918
If you guys need to hydrate, I think I do.

605
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,142
All right, simple enough.

606
00:32:42,683 --> 00:32:43,363
What about the sequels?

607
00:32:43,383 --> 00:32:45,385
Ikari Warriors 3, The Rescue.

608
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:47,187
Not a very good game.

609
00:32:49,087 --> 00:32:52,151
But it's not our job as historians to judge.

610
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:55,134
It's our historians to report accurately.

611
00:32:55,655 --> 00:32:59,120
OK, so that's another rotary stick game, another rotary one.

612
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,601
So moving kind of looks like this.

613
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:02,924
You can aim where you want as you move

614
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:04,386
and keep pointing in that direction.

615
00:33:05,207 --> 00:33:06,048
You've got a punch button.

616
00:33:07,427 --> 00:33:09,149
and you got a kick button, right?

617
00:33:09,869 --> 00:33:11,351
And then again, it's a rotary game.

618
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:12,972
And what the game encouraged you to do

619
00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:15,034
were like roundhouse kicks, right?

620
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,797
So using our existing setup, yeah, it kind of works.

621
00:33:17,817 --> 00:33:19,419
It doesn't feel that great, but you know,

622
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:20,860
you kick and you rotate the R stick

623
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,841
and you can do a roundhouse.

624
00:33:22,922 --> 00:33:24,283
In the arcade, much easier, right?

625
00:33:24,343 --> 00:33:25,745
Because you have one finger over here

626
00:33:25,805 --> 00:33:27,086
and you have a hand on the joystick.

627
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:28,267
So it's just a simple motion.

628
00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:31,391
But wait, there's three buttons, right?

629
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:35,256
So we no longer have our, uh, are just two buttons on the back.

630
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:39,202
We have a jump button and with the jump button, you can jump kick.

631
00:33:39,803 --> 00:33:42,026
So, uh, again, this doesn't work.

632
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:43,348
So, okay.

633
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:43,949
Um,

634
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:51,193
And what we did here was we basically combined the pointing with the R-stick with the moving

635
00:33:52,173 --> 00:33:56,455
and then put the three buttons on the face so that he now points where you walk like

636
00:33:56,475 --> 00:33:57,815
you would expect in most games.

637
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,556
So that works pretty well.

638
00:33:59,716 --> 00:34:04,118
And because of that, you can actually now do the main move that the game expects you

639
00:34:04,158 --> 00:34:06,899
to do, which is a jumping roundhouse kick, right?

640
00:34:06,939 --> 00:34:08,399
Which of course you couldn't do.

641
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:16,524
uh, actually, sorry, I skipped ahead, um, which you couldn't do, uh, if you had thumbs

642
00:34:16,584 --> 00:34:19,785
on two sticks and had to, like, press two buttons at the same, like, it just doesn't

643
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:20,006
work.

644
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:25,388
Um, game had another move, backhand, right, and that one is actually a jump punch.

645
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:29,831
So, uh, jump punch on this controller, I didn't like the thumb movement.

646
00:34:30,511 --> 00:34:31,992
that was required to do that.

647
00:34:32,012 --> 00:34:34,514
I like the player to be able to just rest their thumb

648
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:35,275
on kick and jump.

649
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,517
And in the arcade game, again, we're thinking about

650
00:34:38,657 --> 00:34:40,518
how is the player playing this in the arcade game?

651
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:42,379
If you think back to the way it was laid out,

652
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,040
you'd have your hand on the joystick

653
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:45,682
and you'd have three fingers on three buttons,

654
00:34:45,702 --> 00:34:47,063
so you could instantly do any of that.

655
00:34:47,343 --> 00:34:49,044
You can't do that if your thumb's just resting

656
00:34:49,184 --> 00:34:52,846
on jump and kick, so we added a backhand button.

657
00:34:52,887 --> 00:34:55,909
We just combined punch and jump into one button, so.

658
00:34:56,709 --> 00:34:57,550
Hooray, right?

659
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,731
We solved all the problems.

660
00:34:59,372 --> 00:35:02,495
Oh, turns out that actually strafing is like a valid thing

661
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:04,658
to do in this game, and we just took that away

662
00:35:04,718 --> 00:35:08,502
by combining the aiming and the moving into one stick.

663
00:35:09,082 --> 00:35:11,145
So this doesn't work anymore, right?

664
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,510
But we don't want to take away the ability to jump kick,

665
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,292
because that's actually the main move in the game.

666
00:35:18,153 --> 00:35:22,978
So what we went back and did was added an optional aim, right?

667
00:35:23,098 --> 00:35:25,400
So as you're tilting the left stick,

668
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,342
he's moving and pointing in the way you're going.

669
00:35:27,642 --> 00:35:29,584
And if you happen to hit the R stick,

670
00:35:29,684 --> 00:35:31,847
he's then pointing wherever you're pointing that one.

671
00:35:32,187 --> 00:35:33,448
And then if you let go of the R stick,

672
00:35:33,468 --> 00:35:35,170
he just snaps back into the position

673
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,191
that he was with the L stick.

674
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:40,112
Can you guys see the problem here already?

675
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,112
Like if you're shooting this gun, right?

676
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:45,094
Like now your thumb is on the R-stick

677
00:35:45,874 --> 00:35:47,514
and how are you gonna point that

678
00:35:47,614 --> 00:35:50,176
and like curve your finger to shoot, right?

679
00:35:50,556 --> 00:35:53,277
So, okay, well we just added punch again.

680
00:35:53,297 --> 00:35:54,977
Like it's another button

681
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:56,798
so you could easily shoot the gun.

682
00:35:57,718 --> 00:36:01,139
Wait, no, there's actually a secondary fire, which is throw your weapon.

683
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:03,079
So let's just do backhand again.

684
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,921
Like it looks really complicated, but I'd like to think it works.

685
00:36:09,221 --> 00:36:12,621
And that's just the level of thinking that I think you have to do

686
00:36:12,701 --> 00:36:16,162
to interpret these arcade games to play on controllers.

687
00:36:16,202 --> 00:36:17,682
They were never meant to play on.

688
00:36:18,282 --> 00:36:21,823
And if you were to play this game on MAME, you know, you could theoretically

689
00:36:21,923 --> 00:36:23,883
maybe get close to that setup on MAME.

690
00:36:24,384 --> 00:36:26,545
Or you can even on MAME, like, people

691
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:28,767
have made new rotary controllers you can hook up to MAME,

692
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:29,268
which is cool.

693
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:33,251
But unless you know that's how the game functioned,

694
00:36:33,311 --> 00:36:34,872
unless you know that, you don't know

695
00:36:34,912 --> 00:36:36,973
to configure the game that way, right?

696
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:40,176
And it's not MAME's job to sort of interpret.

697
00:36:40,296 --> 00:36:44,759
It's MAME's job to sort of be a binary equation, right?

698
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,164
And so last time around, three years ago,

699
00:36:50,224 --> 00:36:51,925
I said we should maybe start using.

700
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:54,530
MAME, because it's a solid emulator.

701
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,632
It's got a lot of systems supported, it's open source.

702
00:36:57,032 --> 00:36:58,053
I don't think anyone's done that yet,

703
00:36:58,093 --> 00:36:59,073
that actually includes us.

704
00:36:59,274 --> 00:37:01,735
We haven't used MAME, the emulator, yet.

705
00:37:03,316 --> 00:37:05,157
But here's the thing, we're all using MAME.

706
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:07,839
Every emulator author.

707
00:37:09,117 --> 00:37:11,419
in the commercial industry is using MAME.

708
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:14,562
And I don't mean the executable emulator.

709
00:37:14,582 --> 00:37:16,363
I mean the MAME project.

710
00:37:16,423 --> 00:37:18,886
MAME is a documentation project.

711
00:37:19,006 --> 00:37:21,448
They document how these games and systems worked

712
00:37:21,748 --> 00:37:24,131
and put that information in an accessible place

713
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:25,152
for people to reference.

714
00:37:26,653 --> 00:37:28,735
We're not doing this every time we do one of these collections.

715
00:37:28,755 --> 00:37:33,979
You know, we're not getting the original PCBs and like tracing the circuits and like,

716
00:37:34,179 --> 00:37:38,162
you know, like figuring out what the chips were and getting their specs and looking that up.

717
00:37:38,302 --> 00:37:43,486
And, you know, I mean, there's a little bit of that, but, but where we start is the MAME GitHub,

718
00:37:43,546 --> 00:37:47,710
right? Like, of course we would, why would we look at the physical object to figure that out

719
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:52,313
when someone's already done that? We've all done that. And the reason we do that is it's simple.

720
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:54,375
I mean, I'd like to think of MAME as the Wikipedia.

721
00:37:55,016 --> 00:38:00,961
of game hardware reference, right? Like that's just how it is. And other emulators too, of course.

722
00:38:01,001 --> 00:38:05,404
I'm kind of shorthanding MAME. There's plenty of documentation and amazing work outside of MAME,

723
00:38:05,444 --> 00:38:10,348
of course. But we've all been using it and we all have been from the beginning.

724
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:17,823
And I think we should stop doing this nudge wink thing we've

725
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:22,526
been doing in this industry forever when it comes to stuff

726
00:38:22,546 --> 00:38:26,048
like this, when it comes to MAME or other forms of easily

727
00:38:26,068 --> 00:38:27,469
available hardware documentation.

728
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,731
This is volunteer work that we've

729
00:38:30,751 --> 00:38:35,313
been exploiting for decades, and like in secrecy,

730
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:36,294
like we're ashamed of it.

731
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:37,975
But I don't.

732
00:38:38,922 --> 00:38:41,964
I don't see where the shame is in referencing the MAME project.

733
00:38:42,004 --> 00:38:47,767
This is, you know, it's, again, it's the Wikipedia, we're not ashamed of referencing Wikipedia.

734
00:38:47,907 --> 00:38:51,469
Why are we ashamed of looking at open source emulation as reference?

735
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:56,912
I think we should be proud and boastful and we should be thanking MAME in the credits

736
00:38:56,952 --> 00:38:59,154
and I'm calling everyone out, including myself when I say that.

737
00:38:59,974 --> 00:39:02,996
Alright, Wikipedia of hardware reference.

738
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,380
That should be your starting point, not your primary source.

739
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:15,863
When I was an editor at websites, if a journalist was just citing Wikipedia as a reference,

740
00:39:15,903 --> 00:39:18,443
I'm going to kick that back and say, no, do your research.

741
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,484
So same thing with MAME.

742
00:39:20,604 --> 00:39:24,385
It's only as good as the contributions that have been made to it.

743
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:25,966
I mean, sometimes it's wrong.

744
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:30,547
So we actually found quite a few things that were wrong when we accessed the original boards

745
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:32,227
for the games in SNK 40th.

746
00:39:34,694 --> 00:39:37,236
I really should probably report this stuff to someone over there.

747
00:39:37,316 --> 00:39:38,297
But I mean, here it is now.

748
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:40,899
These are some of the things we found.

749
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:43,240
And yeah, in this case, yeah, we're

750
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,623
hooking up the original board in our makeshift lab in the back.

751
00:39:48,284 --> 00:39:51,466
But I mean, we don't always have boards.

752
00:39:51,907 --> 00:39:57,649
You know, like, really, we might be provided ROM files from the client, but, you know,

753
00:39:58,609 --> 00:40:03,631
how likely do you think it is that 20 plus arcade games we had English and US boards

754
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:04,011
sent us?

755
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:06,171
It's not possible in this project.

756
00:40:06,952 --> 00:40:12,013
So we have to sort of rely on things like YouTube videos of actual cabinets, which is

757
00:40:12,073 --> 00:40:13,294
okay to do and it should be done.

758
00:40:13,754 --> 00:40:17,255
Like if you're doing one of these projects and you don't have the original hardware,

759
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:19,916
you should at least seek out video of the original hardware.

760
00:40:19,936 --> 00:40:21,436
It often exists, sometimes it doesn't.

761
00:40:23,517 --> 00:40:26,679
But it's not just that MAME is quote-unquote wrong and accurate sometimes.

762
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:31,781
Sometimes when it's right, it's not necessarily right.

763
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:33,141
So this is Street Smart.

764
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:35,042
It's a fighting game from SNK.

765
00:40:36,783 --> 00:40:41,225
On the left are the actual RGB values that the game spits out internally.

766
00:40:42,145 --> 00:40:46,887
And so MAME being a sort of like, you know, binary interpretation of the game says, okay,

767
00:40:46,907 --> 00:40:48,128
that's the colors of the game.

768
00:40:49,048 --> 00:40:50,469
I mean, look at that.

769
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:53,332
Do we really think the game is supposed to look like that?

770
00:40:53,352 --> 00:40:59,477
I think that, I don't know, maybe the artist had a busted monitor or something, but clearly

771
00:40:59,517 --> 00:41:00,998
the game is not supposed to look like that.

772
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:08,485
So we adjusted the RGB curve to compensate for that and to reflect what I think would

773
00:41:08,505 --> 00:41:12,488
have happened in a real life scenario, which would be an arcade operator boosting the gamma

774
00:41:12,508 --> 00:41:15,731
to try to make up for this very, very dark game they just got in.

775
00:41:17,646 --> 00:41:20,538
And this kind of goes to what I was saying earlier, the game code...

776
00:41:21,611 --> 00:41:28,032
is binary. But game playing is human and subjective, and I think that as authors of this kind of

777
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:34,214
work we should be empathetic, I guess would be the word, toward how a player would actually

778
00:41:34,254 --> 00:41:39,695
have played this game, and what the author's artistic intent was, right? And the sort of

779
00:41:39,775 --> 00:41:45,056
environment that the game would have been in, and the context that's needed to understand

780
00:41:45,096 --> 00:41:50,178
it even. And, you know, like the rotary dial stuff, it's like, do we need to actually reinterpret

781
00:41:50,198 --> 00:41:51,278
it and re-translate?

782
00:41:52,818 --> 00:41:58,259
in a human accessible way rather than a binary way how to actually play these games.

783
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,180
And it's that sort of human interaction that drives everything we do.

784
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,241
I like to say that we don't make games necessarily or game compilations.

785
00:42:09,301 --> 00:42:13,782
We make documentaries you play with a controller or if you prefer we make like coffee table

786
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,622
books you play on a video game platform.

787
00:42:16,883 --> 00:42:17,023
And...

788
00:42:17,903 --> 00:42:19,924
you know, of course the games are playable because it's about games.

789
00:42:19,944 --> 00:42:20,984
It's on a gameplay platform.

790
00:42:21,024 --> 00:42:22,825
So the games to me are like feature two.

791
00:42:23,346 --> 00:42:27,568
But this notion of capturing that history and giving you the fan

792
00:42:28,388 --> 00:42:33,310
this this hardcore product to to to really experience and appreciate this.

793
00:42:33,431 --> 00:42:34,311
That's the product.

794
00:42:34,811 --> 00:42:36,812
But we've barely started as an industry.

795
00:42:36,832 --> 00:42:39,053
There's so much more we could be doing.

796
00:42:39,073 --> 00:42:40,754
I mean, I'm just blue skying here, right?

797
00:42:40,774 --> 00:42:42,595
But like, just think about it like we have.

798
00:42:43,215 --> 00:42:48,338
complete access to what's on the screen, what's being shown and played at you, and the player

799
00:42:48,578 --> 00:42:50,779
can manipulate things with the controller.

800
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:52,699
What can we do with that?

801
00:42:52,759 --> 00:42:58,462
We can step backward and forward through the development process and show you early versions

802
00:42:58,562 --> 00:43:01,343
of it and let you see why decisions were made.

803
00:43:01,363 --> 00:43:02,123
We can...

804
00:43:03,924 --> 00:43:07,448
I don't know, put the game source code in there, let you tweak it and compile it in

805
00:43:07,488 --> 00:43:10,592
the game and like, like see what what adjusting it would do.

806
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:14,917
Right. We can we can, you know, like you earlier, we can improve the hardware

807
00:43:16,058 --> 00:43:19,582
that the games ran on to compensate for some of its flaws.

808
00:43:19,622 --> 00:43:22,345
Actually, M2 has done that beautifully with the 3D releases on the 3DS.

809
00:43:24,507 --> 00:43:27,748
We can make a game about the making of the game, right?

810
00:43:27,788 --> 00:43:32,150
Like we can make like a visual novel or an RPG about making these games.

811
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:35,051
There's this really wonderful book called Understanding Comics.

812
00:43:35,191 --> 00:43:36,131
Do you guys know this book?

813
00:43:36,652 --> 00:43:42,274
Yeah, Understanding Comics is a comic book that explains the art of comic books as a comic book,

814
00:43:42,314 --> 00:43:44,915
and it works beautifully to illustrate why comics work.

815
00:43:45,035 --> 00:43:50,198
work. So what's understanding games in these terms, right? I don't know, we could slow down

816
00:43:50,278 --> 00:43:54,780
time and like annotate game functions as they happen to help you understand what you're seeing

817
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:54,960
here.

818
00:43:56,557 --> 00:44:00,359
We can let people mess with our virtual machines themselves,

819
00:44:00,379 --> 00:44:02,921
like let them turn off graphic layers

820
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:05,122
to see what's behind there, which they're already doing

821
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,323
in the amateur emulator world,

822
00:44:07,343 --> 00:44:08,744
but we can unlock that for them

823
00:44:08,824 --> 00:44:11,005
in a consumer-facing way, right?

824
00:44:11,045 --> 00:44:15,908
We can give them tile viewers and asset viewers

825
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:17,469
to look at how the game was made.

826
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:21,011
We can make new cuts of these games

827
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:23,412
that combine the best features of each SKU

828
00:44:23,492 --> 00:44:24,753
into a master version.

829
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:26,533
But put the original in there if you do that.

830
00:44:27,794 --> 00:44:29,895
But I mean, the possibilities are endless, right?

831
00:44:29,915 --> 00:44:35,697
We're just starting to think about how to do all these things using these source materials

832
00:44:35,737 --> 00:44:36,757
to bring this stuff back.

833
00:44:38,257 --> 00:44:42,559
But we can't do any of that stuff if that stuff is lost.

834
00:44:45,802 --> 00:44:51,428
Usually when we talk about game preservation, I think the notion that people have is taking

835
00:44:51,468 --> 00:44:55,312
the binary data, making sure it's online or safe or accessible.

836
00:44:56,834 --> 00:45:00,818
And usually what I say to that is like, no, the pirates took care of it.

837
00:45:00,858 --> 00:45:01,339
We're fine.

838
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:02,400
You can download this stuff.

839
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,241
But, you know, we...

840
00:45:04,584 --> 00:45:05,744
That's not actually reality.

841
00:45:05,764 --> 00:45:08,125
We've already actually lost even binary data

842
00:45:08,145 --> 00:45:09,546
for some important games.

843
00:45:10,427 --> 00:45:13,008
This is a photograph of an advertisement

844
00:45:13,228 --> 00:45:16,630
of SNK's very first game, the Mikan Kit series.

845
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:19,172
These were brick-breaking games in the late 70s.

846
00:45:19,972 --> 00:45:20,172
Actually, 1978.

847
00:45:20,672 --> 00:45:24,274
This is the game that SNK 40th anniversary

848
00:45:24,314 --> 00:45:26,496
got the 40-year anniversary from.

849
00:45:27,514 --> 00:45:28,234
We don't have it.

850
00:45:28,454 --> 00:45:29,035
No one has it.

851
00:45:29,055 --> 00:45:29,655
They're not available.

852
00:45:29,675 --> 00:45:30,156
They're not in Maine.

853
00:45:30,196 --> 00:45:31,537
We don't even know how many they made.

854
00:45:32,017 --> 00:45:33,358
They made between three and six.

855
00:45:33,518 --> 00:45:34,039
We don't know.

856
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:37,321
And we don't even have people to ask anymore

857
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:38,842
that were around back then.

858
00:45:38,942 --> 00:45:42,445
So even with this commercial support

859
00:45:42,485 --> 00:45:46,128
of making this historical interactive document

860
00:45:46,728 --> 00:45:48,910
to preserve what this company was and its roots,

861
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,231
we don't have its actual roots.

862
00:45:50,551 --> 00:45:51,432
They seem to be gone.

863
00:45:54,077 --> 00:45:58,418
We actually had to send someone on a special mission to the, I believe it's pronounced,

864
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:03,840
Diet Library in Tokyo, because they had an extensive archive of literature, including

865
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,141
trade magazines for the coin-op industry.

866
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:10,442
Ads like this is just all we have now for the Micon Kids series.

867
00:46:10,462 --> 00:46:15,644
We don't even have player testament as to how these games played, what the features

868
00:46:15,704 --> 00:46:16,104
were.

869
00:46:16,164 --> 00:46:17,164
What does that ship do?

870
00:46:17,224 --> 00:46:17,625
We don't know.

871
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:23,293
We don't know what the ship does in this game and all we can do is sort of extract as much

872
00:46:23,373 --> 00:46:26,518
Detail as we can and try to preserve that while we can

873
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:31,666
And it's just like we got at least these photo guys like it's like the yet. There's like a Sasquatch

874
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:32,908
You know what I mean? It's like that shouldn't

875
00:46:33,529 --> 00:46:36,090
B for video games, like looking at these mysterious things.

876
00:46:37,331 --> 00:46:41,414
We actually managed to find one of the three to six Micon kit

877
00:46:41,474 --> 00:46:43,195
boards for us to look at.

878
00:46:43,736 --> 00:46:46,298
And it was through, actually, an arcade rental company

879
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:48,879
in rural Japan called Takai Shokai.

880
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,021
One of our developers, Brandon Sheffield,

881
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,743
had to travel like eight hours on public transit

882
00:46:53,783 --> 00:46:54,804
to go to this place.

883
00:46:56,705 --> 00:46:59,147
And he's been running this arcade business

884
00:46:59,167 --> 00:47:01,669
since the 70s, and he happened to have one of the Micon kits.

885
00:47:03,609 --> 00:47:08,013
So he was able to hook it up for us and Brandon was able to play the game to fill in some

886
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,394
details for our museum feature.

887
00:47:09,975 --> 00:47:14,139
Unfortunately it was too late in the product for us to actually dump the ROMs with him

888
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:17,242
and put it in the product, but at least we know where one is.

889
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:21,205
Maybe if more people buy the game we can do a patch or something.

890
00:47:23,121 --> 00:47:26,083
But it's not just these ancient, like, crusty arcanoid clones.

891
00:47:26,123 --> 00:47:30,346
Like, Yosaku is a game that even Take-san doesn't have.

892
00:47:30,366 --> 00:47:33,268
And this is a tree chopping game that...

893
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,624
From all accounts, it was actually really popular in Japan in the 70s, and in fact,

894
00:47:39,605 --> 00:47:46,713
when you look up the game now, the results you typically get are an unauthorized clone

895
00:47:46,913 --> 00:47:52,219
of this original game that was made for a home console, but the originalâ€”and it was

896
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,223
super popular, that cloneâ€”but the original game that was cloned, we can't find it.

897
00:47:56,803 --> 00:48:00,945
Like, we've heard rumors that sometimes this arcade here

898
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,846
might swap it in for one of the machines once in a while,

899
00:48:03,906 --> 00:48:05,106
but we tried.

900
00:48:05,166 --> 00:48:07,867
We have communications to the Game Preservation Society

901
00:48:07,907 --> 00:48:09,688
in Japan, we know a lot of the collectors out there.

902
00:48:09,728 --> 00:48:10,868
We can't find Yosaku.

903
00:48:11,369 --> 00:48:14,010
Yosaku might actually be gone, and if it exists still,

904
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:15,770
it's probably not digitized,

905
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:18,131
it's probably literally rotting on a board

906
00:48:18,371 --> 00:48:19,532
and dying right now.

907
00:48:20,512 --> 00:48:22,533
But it's not just the games themselves, even the material.

908
00:48:23,453 --> 00:48:27,834
surrounding the games is becoming incredibly difficult to find, again, even on a commercial

909
00:48:27,874 --> 00:48:31,476
project where we're paid to do it and have access to people.

910
00:48:31,516 --> 00:48:32,896
We can't find some of this stuff.

911
00:48:33,797 --> 00:48:37,778
Luckily, we were really fortunate to find a guy, Yoshino-san.

912
00:48:38,098 --> 00:48:42,019
Yoshino-san worked at SNK in the 80s and was like a super fanboy for the company.

913
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:46,241
He actually got his start, I think, because he wrote a fanzine about SNK in like, 84.

914
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:49,382
So they hired him to be the communications guy.

915
00:48:49,662 --> 00:48:51,022
So he made his fanzine official.

916
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:54,306
Because he was such a fan, he kept a lot of this stuff.

917
00:48:54,506 --> 00:48:58,110
And for these two games in particular, World Wars and Mahjong Classroom...

918
00:48:59,574 --> 00:49:03,257
This is the only physical thing we have for these games.

919
00:49:03,297 --> 00:49:04,218
We have the game ROMs.

920
00:49:04,478 --> 00:49:06,559
Well, actually, not for Mojave Classroom.

921
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:07,300
That game's not dumb.

922
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,621
But for World Wars, we have the game ROMs and stuff.

923
00:49:09,922 --> 00:49:10,722
But this is the first time.

924
00:49:11,103 --> 00:49:13,664
This is the only thing we know of that has the logo

925
00:49:13,744 --> 00:49:15,546
and what passes for its key art.

926
00:49:16,947 --> 00:49:19,729
And we were just so fortunate not only to find him,

927
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:23,912
but that SNK is a company that not only acknowledges

928
00:49:23,972 --> 00:49:25,993
its past employees and allows us to talk to them,

929
00:49:26,013 --> 00:49:26,474
but actually.

930
00:49:27,433 --> 00:49:32,314
paid him. Like, SNK paid Yoshino-san, as a consultant, to work with us, to answer our

931
00:49:32,374 --> 00:49:38,095
questions, to actually scan his materials, which, I mean, like, that should be a standing

932
00:49:38,135 --> 00:49:43,916
ovation, but we're running low on time. Thank you again, SNK. And it's not just the materials,

933
00:49:43,976 --> 00:49:48,017
it's the memories, right? So this is a game called Tangram Q. It's a simplistic-looking

934
00:49:48,037 --> 00:49:48,697
Tangram game.

935
00:49:50,998 --> 00:49:53,820
You know, like making the shape out of the shapes is Tangrams, right?

936
00:49:54,621 --> 00:49:58,244
There's another one that's lost. We couldn't find the ROM. We couldn't find a board anywhere.

937
00:49:58,304 --> 00:50:03,428
But it turns out we didn't know this until we had access to Yoshino-san. The game wasn't released, right? So like that's

938
00:50:04,108 --> 00:50:10,433
information that doesn't... like you can't Google Tangram. I mean, maybe you can now, but you couldn't Google Tangram Q to find out,

939
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:13,196
oh, it doesn't exist. We don't have to hunt for it. Like it didn't come out.

940
00:50:13,656 --> 00:50:17,139
Like we didn't know that until we happened to have access to that one guy.

941
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,040
And you know, game preservation is kind of like that right now.

942
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:25,362
Um, even on past products, uh, like going back to Disney afternoon collection that

943
00:50:25,382 --> 00:50:30,823
we did, uh, Capcom and Disney didn't have a ton of material for the games and,

944
00:50:30,963 --> 00:50:33,964
and this, this beautiful box art that was produced for these games.

945
00:50:34,804 --> 00:50:36,125
Uh, Capcom doesn't have it.

946
00:50:36,165 --> 00:50:36,985
Disney doesn't have it.

947
00:50:37,365 --> 00:50:38,985
Or if they did, they, I don't know, they might have it.

948
00:50:39,026 --> 00:50:40,406
They, they weren't very communicative.

949
00:50:40,846 --> 00:50:47,970
Um, the only reason that we have this stuff is because I personally happen to have connections

950
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:50,571
to the like video game art collector world.

951
00:50:51,152 --> 00:50:56,554
And I happen to be friends with this guy, Bronte, is what he goes by in Canada, who

952
00:50:56,694 --> 00:51:02,277
happens to have purchased out the files of a marketing company that closed because he

953
00:51:02,297 --> 00:51:03,338
cares about this stuff.

954
00:51:03,398 --> 00:51:05,319
And that's the only reason we have this art.

955
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,321
And that's, that's, to me, that's scary.

956
00:51:11,113 --> 00:51:14,676
But scariest to me of all is source, right?

957
00:51:15,977 --> 00:51:17,518
How many of you guys here work on games?

958
00:51:18,398 --> 00:51:18,779
Raise your hands.

959
00:51:18,819 --> 00:51:19,679
OK, keep your hands up.

960
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,641
How many of I asked you?

961
00:51:22,141 --> 00:51:25,704
OK, so keep your hands up if you worked on a game that shipped

962
00:51:25,884 --> 00:51:27,485
five or more years ago, let's say.

963
00:51:28,706 --> 00:51:31,909
Franz, I know you did.

964
00:51:32,169 --> 00:51:34,350
OK, games five or more years ago.

965
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:37,593
How many of you feel right now, if I asked you to,

966
00:51:37,653 --> 00:51:39,154
you can get that source and compile that game?

967
00:51:40,762 --> 00:51:41,584
Okay, few of you.

968
00:51:42,326 --> 00:51:43,569
The few of you that are left,

969
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:46,716
how confident are you that 20 years from now,

970
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:48,700
someone could not only locate that,

971
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,705
but they could compile it and build it and it's right?

972
00:51:52,311 --> 00:51:53,211
Literally none of you.

973
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:55,652
Literally zero people, right?

974
00:51:57,373 --> 00:51:59,934
And OK, let's make that even scarier.

975
00:52:00,394 --> 00:52:02,054
Digital Eclipse, the current incarnation,

976
00:52:02,094 --> 00:52:03,095
we've done these four products.

977
00:52:03,115 --> 00:52:05,575
50-ish classic arcade games.

978
00:52:06,016 --> 00:52:08,536
Out of those 50, how many would you

979
00:52:08,596 --> 00:52:10,497
suppose we had source access to?

980
00:52:11,758 --> 00:52:13,118
Zero is the correct answer.

981
00:52:13,138 --> 00:52:14,398
Did I tell you that?

982
00:52:17,779 --> 00:52:18,199
Zero.

983
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,282
I'm not shaming companies when I say

984
00:52:22,302 --> 00:52:23,623
that it's just the reality.

985
00:52:23,663 --> 00:52:25,605
We didn't hold onto a lot of this source code.

986
00:52:27,467 --> 00:52:28,407
And that's terrifying.

987
00:52:28,868 --> 00:52:31,550
So, I'm speaking at a developers conference,

988
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:32,631
ask developers what we can do.

989
00:52:32,671 --> 00:52:35,593
I'm gonna sort of bring back some wisdom from GDC's past.

990
00:52:35,633 --> 00:52:38,035
These are my pals, Lane Nooney and Jason Scott.

991
00:52:38,636 --> 00:52:40,918
I'm gonna let you figure out the order of operations here,

992
00:52:40,978 --> 00:52:41,899
but you're gonna steal from work

993
00:52:41,919 --> 00:52:43,000
and you're gonna put it in a box.

994
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,761
You can do the box at work or you can do it at home.

995
00:52:44,821 --> 00:52:46,502
I don't care, just do both of those things.

996
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:50,625
But don't forget that that material has to go somewhere,

997
00:52:50,665 --> 00:52:52,646
because if it's in your house forever

998
00:52:52,746 --> 00:52:56,289
and you get hit by a bus, just put it somewhere.

999
00:52:56,669 --> 00:52:57,850
There's a lot of places to put your stuff.

1000
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,992
This list is nowhere near complete, obviously,

1001
00:53:02,092 --> 00:53:04,634
but these, for my money, are the best potential homes

1002
00:53:05,534 --> 00:53:06,915
for video game material.

1003
00:53:06,995 --> 00:53:10,237
So the Strong Museum of Play in Rochester, New York.

1004
00:53:11,138 --> 00:53:14,400
What I love about them is that they have a library in-house.

1005
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,921
They have full-time librarians.

1006
00:53:16,281 --> 00:53:17,902
and they are actively collecting

1007
00:53:18,363 --> 00:53:19,924
video game development material.

1008
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:22,025
So for example, Jordan Mechner,

1009
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:24,147
who did Karateka, Prince of Persia, Last Express,

1010
00:53:25,568 --> 00:53:27,530
he donated all of his materials to The Strong.

1011
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:29,251
And as a researcher, you can, and I have,

1012
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:31,112
you can make an appointment with the library

1013
00:53:31,132 --> 00:53:32,734
and they'll bring out Jordan's material

1014
00:53:32,774 --> 00:53:34,715
and you can go through his design notes

1015
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:38,018
and the video that he shot to rotoscope things.

1016
00:53:38,098 --> 00:53:41,801
Like you can access those materials and it's wonderful.

1017
00:53:41,821 --> 00:53:43,662
I really recommend that as an option.

1018
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,404
The National Video Game Museum, Frisco, Texas.

1019
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:51,068
They don't have a library yet, but these guys have been collecting this sort of ephemeral material

1020
00:53:51,529 --> 00:53:53,310
longer than anybody, like since the 90s.

1021
00:53:54,471 --> 00:53:59,555
And they've been, they're in what they call their sort of 1.0 phase of the museum right now,

1022
00:53:59,575 --> 00:54:01,357
which is more of a public-facing display.

1023
00:54:02,397 --> 00:54:04,779
But their expansion plans, should they raise enough money,

1024
00:54:05,139 --> 00:54:06,479
include opening a library.

1025
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,700
So that's going to be a really viable option

1026
00:54:09,141 --> 00:54:09,901
when that happens.

1027
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:11,922
The Internet Archive, if you don't give a damn,

1028
00:54:13,223 --> 00:54:14,623
if you're like, I don't care who has this,

1029
00:54:14,663 --> 00:54:16,864
just put it out there, that's your option right there.

1030
00:54:17,645 --> 00:54:19,225
Just pop it on the Internet Archive.

1031
00:54:19,425 --> 00:54:21,266
If you own the intellectual property, cool,

1032
00:54:21,346 --> 00:54:21,827
just put it there.

1033
00:54:22,007 --> 00:54:24,268
If you don't own it, I'm not a cop.

1034
00:54:25,168 --> 00:54:25,908
Put it on the internet.

1035
00:54:29,617 --> 00:54:30,717
Put it on the internet archive.

1036
00:54:30,757 --> 00:54:31,978
If you don't want to deal with it yourself,

1037
00:54:32,038 --> 00:54:34,639
find Jason Scott, who will do it for you.

1038
00:54:34,759 --> 00:54:37,920
And he'll do free PR to promote how amazing you are for putting

1039
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:38,861
this material online.

1040
00:54:39,581 --> 00:54:41,242
Library of Congress is one we never talk about.

1041
00:54:42,482 --> 00:54:45,644
But they do have a video game archive in Culpeper, Virginia,

1042
00:54:45,684 --> 00:54:47,645
kind of remote, not the normal archive.

1043
00:54:47,685 --> 00:54:48,865
It's where their films are.

1044
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:53,587
And they, believe it or not, could be a viable option.

1045
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,081
They do seek material like this,

1046
00:54:58,262 --> 00:55:01,724
but they don't do a lot of outreach about it.

1047
00:55:01,944 --> 00:55:03,665
And I mean, this is the Library of Congress.

1048
00:55:03,685 --> 00:55:05,206
Their job is to take things, keep it safe.

1049
00:55:05,286 --> 00:55:06,847
And I've talked to them about it,

1050
00:55:06,867 --> 00:55:08,268
and they're like, yeah, we'll take source code.

1051
00:55:08,288 --> 00:55:09,029
We'll keep it safe.

1052
00:55:09,549 --> 00:55:11,610
I don't know that they necessarily have the infrastructure

1053
00:55:12,671 --> 00:55:15,453
to maintain source code or anything like that,

1054
00:55:15,493 --> 00:55:17,174
but I think that's something we could work toward.

1055
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:19,235
I mean, I don't know, let's use our federal dollars

1056
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:20,216
for a source repo.

1057
00:55:21,157 --> 00:55:21,537
Why not?

1058
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,500
And finally, there's us, the Video Game History Foundation.

1059
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,861
This is my baby.

1060
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:28,522
So we're the newest of the bunch.

1061
00:55:28,842 --> 00:55:32,925
We just celebrated our two-year anniversary this week, I think.

1062
00:55:36,528 --> 00:55:37,808
So we're a 501c3.

1063
00:55:37,828 --> 00:55:40,971
We're just across the bridge in Emeryville, just down the street

1064
00:55:40,991 --> 00:55:41,471
from Pixar.

1065
00:55:44,814 --> 00:55:47,156
We are actually going to open a library there this year.

1066
00:55:47,176 --> 00:55:48,056
I haven't announced that.

1067
00:55:48,076 --> 00:55:48,717
I guess I just did.

1068
00:55:50,158 --> 00:55:52,520
But we're going to open by appointment.

1069
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,062
I can't be a librarian 9 to 5.

1070
00:55:55,362 --> 00:55:58,145
But we're going to have a video game history reference

1071
00:55:58,165 --> 00:55:58,485
library.

1072
00:55:58,505 --> 00:56:00,707
I think it might be the first dedicated one.

1073
00:56:00,727 --> 00:56:01,748
That's all it's for.

1074
00:56:02,828 --> 00:56:03,509
So we're doing that.

1075
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:07,352
If I'm wrong, if there's another video game

1076
00:56:07,913 --> 00:56:10,675
library for referencing this stuff, let me know.

1077
00:56:10,715 --> 00:56:11,215
I've got to visit.

1078
00:56:12,982 --> 00:56:15,243
I like to say we fill in the gaps with the other institutions.

1079
00:56:15,263 --> 00:56:16,904
Like we don't have to maintain a public museum.

1080
00:56:16,944 --> 00:56:21,026
I don't have to use my money for rent on a large space or conservation

1081
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,768
of really crazy rare materials, things like that.

1082
00:56:23,808 --> 00:56:25,709
So we can be really flexible with our time and money.

1083
00:56:26,709 --> 00:56:27,790
But I think.

1084
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:32,054
One of our best functions in the world

1085
00:56:32,154 --> 00:56:34,156
is to sort of provide an impartial voice

1086
00:56:34,417 --> 00:56:35,858
if you have materials like this.

1087
00:56:36,819 --> 00:56:39,282
So if you have your video game development material,

1088
00:56:39,322 --> 00:56:41,304
you don't know exactly where you want it to go,

1089
00:56:41,344 --> 00:56:42,285
but you want it to go somewhere,

1090
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:44,107
I'll go through your options with you

1091
00:56:44,127 --> 00:56:46,169
and I'll tell you the pros and cons of each.

1092
00:56:46,189 --> 00:56:46,930
They're mostly pros,

1093
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,072
but you know, I'll help you find the right home.

1094
00:56:50,934 --> 00:56:56,577
But I think our best place in the world is I want to work toward source material

1095
00:56:56,797 --> 00:56:58,357
being an educational resource.

1096
00:56:59,238 --> 00:57:01,779
I think the industry sees this stuff as a trade secret.

1097
00:57:01,879 --> 00:57:03,279
I think it's an educational tool.

1098
00:57:03,299 --> 00:57:06,521
I don't think there's a better way to understand a video game than to go back

1099
00:57:06,561 --> 00:57:09,282
to its source and to study it, maybe even rebuild it, right?

1100
00:57:10,603 --> 00:57:13,624
I want to live in a world where historians like me don't have to like reverse

1101
00:57:13,684 --> 00:57:14,784
engineer binaries.

1102
00:57:14,804 --> 00:57:15,565
This is stupid.

1103
00:57:17,363 --> 00:57:20,064
Like, if that source exists, why am I going out of my way

1104
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:23,205
to circumvent that when the real thing exists?

1105
00:57:23,245 --> 00:57:24,826
It's kind of a new concept, I think.

1106
00:57:25,686 --> 00:57:27,687
Source code is an educational resource,

1107
00:57:28,147 --> 00:57:28,807
at least for games.

1108
00:57:28,827 --> 00:57:30,408
I don't think the traditional library system

1109
00:57:30,428 --> 00:57:32,448
really has language for that or tools yet,

1110
00:57:32,588 --> 00:57:34,629
but it's something we're trying to figure out.

1111
00:57:35,609 --> 00:57:36,910
But we're making it up as we go.

1112
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:39,891
It's all brand new, figuring it out as we go.

1113
00:57:40,031 --> 00:57:42,592
But maybe we should figure it out together.

1114
00:57:44,432 --> 00:57:45,613
So if you're interested.

1115
00:57:47,591 --> 00:57:48,953
Let's get in touch, let's figure this out.

1116
00:57:48,993 --> 00:57:51,155
Let's figure out how to get our source material safe

1117
00:57:52,017 --> 00:57:55,861
and accessible and figure out where your comfort level is

1118
00:57:55,941 --> 00:57:57,083
on access, things like that.

1119
00:57:57,143 --> 00:57:57,984
Let's figure this out

1120
00:57:58,024 --> 00:58:00,407
because it's only gonna get harder as we go.

1121
00:58:02,189 --> 00:58:02,950
And that's it.

1122
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:03,631
Thank you, GDC.

1123
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:13,812
I think I have time for literally one question,

1124
00:58:13,852 --> 00:58:15,032
and there's one person at a mic.

1125
00:58:15,132 --> 00:58:18,454
But before we get to that, I think two doors down,

1126
00:58:18,494 --> 00:58:18,894
is that right?

1127
00:58:19,314 --> 00:58:22,576
Yeah, two doors down, there's a sort of congregating meeting

1128
00:58:22,716 --> 00:58:23,816
area where I will be.

1129
00:58:24,056 --> 00:58:27,458
So let's go hang out there and solve all these problems

1130
00:58:27,498 --> 00:58:28,318
immediately today.

1131
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:29,499
Yes, sir.

1132
00:58:30,279 --> 00:58:32,780
Do you know Showtime, Eric Chung?

1133
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:36,642
He's the guy who preserves a bunch of arcade games,

1134
00:58:37,282 --> 00:58:39,423
and he's part of the main community.

1135
00:58:40,399 --> 00:58:45,244
He has extensive network with the arcade network and game preservation.

1136
00:58:45,644 --> 00:58:51,690
And he's also the founder and CEO of XR Arcadia, a new arcade platform

1137
00:58:52,531 --> 00:58:56,255
that will be available worldwide and hope.

1138
00:58:56,915 --> 00:59:00,259
And what do you think of the new arcade platform?

1139
00:59:00,339 --> 00:59:02,220
Is it worth preserving its history?

1140
00:59:03,542 --> 00:59:04,603
No, no, of course it is.

1141
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:08,463
So the question was, do I know Eric Showtime?

1142
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,624
He's in Japan, and he's an arcade board collector.

1143
00:59:10,665 --> 00:59:14,208
He has extensive connections to other arcade collectors.

1144
00:59:14,228 --> 00:59:14,928
He can find things.

1145
00:59:14,948 --> 00:59:15,509
Yeah, I know Eric.

1146
00:59:16,229 --> 00:59:17,410
Not personally, but I know a lot of him.

1147
00:59:18,731 --> 00:59:22,475
And do I think his new venture is worth preserving?

1148
00:59:22,615 --> 00:59:23,255
Yes, of course.

1149
00:59:23,656 --> 00:59:24,476
So yes.

1150
00:59:26,662 --> 00:59:28,223
I think that's...can we do one more?

1151
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:29,664
Yeah, one more. Yes.

1152
00:59:29,985 --> 00:59:31,546
I'll make this as quick as I can.

1153
00:59:32,206 --> 00:59:34,468
We're at the point where we have official remasters

1154
00:59:34,508 --> 00:59:36,490
of games. What do we have to do to get to

1155
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:37,531
remixing?

1156
00:59:38,312 --> 00:59:40,614
Ooh, okay. So the question was, we have official

1157
00:59:40,674 --> 00:59:42,555
remasters of games. What do we need

1158
00:59:42,575 --> 00:59:44,557
to do to get to official remixing?

1159
00:59:47,115 --> 00:59:49,696
What, something that Sega did that I really love

1160
00:59:49,756 --> 00:59:52,656
is that they did a collection of Sega Genesis stuff

1161
00:59:52,716 --> 00:59:54,597
on Steam and they actually allow users

1162
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:57,937
to submit modifications to Sega Genesis ROMs,

1163
00:59:58,317 --> 00:59:58,978
which is really cool.

1164
00:59:58,998 --> 01:00:00,758
So like there's already a sense of,

1165
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:03,618
you know, it's not Sega making remix games, right?

1166
01:00:03,638 --> 01:00:06,459
But they're blessing remix games

1167
01:00:07,099 --> 01:00:08,819
as being allowed on their platform.

1168
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,140
I'd argue we're already there.

1169
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,040
I think that Wonder Boy the Dragon's Trap is a remix.

1170
01:00:13,769 --> 01:00:17,534
Uh, I think, I think the, at least artistically like the, the actual art,

1171
01:00:17,955 --> 01:00:19,337
uh, it is a remix of the art.

1172
01:00:20,037 --> 01:00:23,642
Um, but what I'm really interested in, and I brought this up very briefly

1173
01:00:23,702 --> 01:00:27,807
earlier, I'm interested in remixing different versions of the game into

1174
01:00:27,887 --> 01:00:29,630
like the definitive version of something.

1175
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:31,512
So like the example I like to use is Zelda 2.

1176
01:00:32,513 --> 01:00:36,995
So Zelda 2 originally was a disc game. It was on the Famicom disc system

1177
01:00:37,395 --> 01:00:40,577
So it used the enhanced audio capabilities of that system

1178
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:44,819
When it was brought to cartridge, you know, we don't have that enhanced audio chip anymore

1179
01:00:44,859 --> 01:00:49,141
So they couldn't include that but they added a new quality of life features

1180
01:00:49,161 --> 01:00:53,923
They had to do tiles so that the dungeons varied more so like there's no definitive Zelda 2

1181
01:00:54,043 --> 01:00:59,405
I would love us to start mixing things to make the actual definitive versions of these games

1182
01:00:59,983 --> 01:01:01,188
We're actually out of time, we're over,

1183
01:01:01,289 --> 01:01:03,438
but two doors down, I'm gonna go hang out there.

1184
01:01:03,479 --> 01:01:04,885
Thank you guys so much, this was great.
