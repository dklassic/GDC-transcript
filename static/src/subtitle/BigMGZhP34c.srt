1
00:00:04,888 --> 00:00:06,530
Okay, so sorry about the technical issues.

2
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:13,415
My name is Daniel Olsen, I'm a freelance composer, and I've been working on Year Walk and Device 6.

3
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:15,937
So that's what I'm going to talk about today.

4
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:23,643
First, I started making music back in 1995 on the Amiga, Commodore Amiga.

5
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,313
That's when I also started making games with my friend.

6
00:00:31,653 --> 00:00:36,457
So I drew pixel art in Deluxe Paint. I don't know if anyone ever used that.

7
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:41,081
And I also started doing chiptunes in Protracker.

8
00:00:44,904 --> 00:00:53,732
In 2001, I started my first real job in the game industry at Massive Entertainment.

9
00:00:54,987 --> 00:01:02,710
Before I moved on to a bunch of other companies, and every company I worked at I tried to pitch

10
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:11,234
my music, but it didn't always go that well, until I ended up at Southend, which was a

11
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:14,715
small company, and they, as they grew, they gave me a bigger...

12
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:19,559
possibilities to grow as a composer and sound designer.

13
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,601
And my last project there was Ilo Milo,

14
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:26,382
where I worked full-time with only music and sound.

15
00:01:28,703 --> 00:01:30,444
Six years ago I moved to California

16
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,605
and left the game industry.

17
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:37,046
I worked for PlayStation R&D for a while

18
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:39,668
and created sound effects libraries.

19
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:42,668
Music and art for in-house projects.

20
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:47,892
But it was only for a short time before I left and started working in the tech space.

21
00:01:47,912 --> 00:01:50,174
Because that's what pays the bills.

22
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:55,659
But I really started missing working with games.

23
00:01:55,839 --> 00:02:01,024
So in 2012 I contacted Simogo that I used to work with before at Southend.

24
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:06,223
And they actually started their work on their fourth game.

25
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:09,785
And they actually talked about contacting me

26
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:11,346
about making the music.

27
00:02:11,706 --> 00:02:15,828
So that was really lucky.

28
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:20,471
So I ended up working on their fourth game, which

29
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:21,171
was Year Walk.

30
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:24,633
I don't know if anyone here played it.

31
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:28,015
OK, a few of you.

32
00:02:29,096 --> 00:02:29,416
It's a.

33
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:36,811
For those of you who haven't played it, it's a first-person 2D mystery horror game based

34
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:42,074
on an old Swedish myth called Year Walking.

35
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:50,759
And people run out in the middle of the night around Christmas to get a glimpse into the

36
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:52,840
future and they see all these weird creatures.

37
00:02:54,402 --> 00:03:02,669
So the whole game is based about you running around in a dark forest and experience all these strange things.

38
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,914
The other game is Device 6. I don't know if anyone played that here.

39
00:03:08,934 --> 00:03:11,276
Okay, same people I guess.

40
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:15,239
It's quite different.

41
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:21,919
An interactive mystery novel where your text is your map and your narrator.

42
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:33,148
And it's heavily influenced by 60s spy movies and general weird things.

43
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:34,849
It's quite lovely.

44
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:37,911
So...

45
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,414
Both these two games have been really...

46
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,421
Both of these two games got a lot of praise for how engaging they were in narrative, both

47
00:03:59,701 --> 00:04:01,021
in design and audio.

48
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:06,802
And for this to happen, there was a lot of pieces that had to fit together, and the audio

49
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:07,342
was one of them.

50
00:04:08,323 --> 00:04:13,244
And that's what I'm going to try and explain how we went about and did that.

51
00:04:16,785 --> 00:04:17,285
Okay, next one.

52
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:21,287
So how do you make music engaging?

53
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,487
How do you engage the player?

54
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:28,490
And how do you make a scene in a game engaging?

55
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,532
I'll try to answer how we try to solve these three things.

56
00:04:34,353 --> 00:04:37,094
I think, first of all, music can...

57
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,056
You can have a really beautiful track that's really great by itself,

58
00:04:41,436 --> 00:04:45,958
but it won't necessarily make a scene better if you add it.

59
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:50,228
Also, if you have a track that's perfect for one scene,

60
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:54,210
it might make another scene really weird because it won't fit,

61
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,431
even though they're very similar.

62
00:04:56,471 --> 00:05:01,975
So basically what it comes down to is how and when you use what track.

63
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:05,077
So basically you need the right song for the right moment.

64
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:19,410
What I like to do, because I'm not a schooled musician, so I find my own ways to figure

65
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,471
out music styles.

66
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:28,059
So what I like to do is kind of like an actor and get into a role before starting working

67
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:28,559
on something.

68
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:30,582
So what I do is...

69
00:05:32,404 --> 00:05:34,064
I find a lot of references for music.

70
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:41,928
For Device 6 and Year Walk, I had Simon and Jonas helping me putting together a playlist.

71
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:46,450
And then we... I would listen to that for weeks. I would not listen to anything else.

72
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:56,334
Because for me, when I sit down and write music, I think you make like hundreds of decisions, small decisions all the time.

73
00:05:57,408 --> 00:06:04,032
And you will unconsciously just pick the solutions that are closest in your memory.

74
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:10,436
So if you have been listening to a certain style of music, you're going to make a decision based on what you've been listening on.

75
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:16,360
I don't know if this is true, but I think it works for me at least.

76
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:22,824
So, then you have to write the song.

77
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:24,164
I don't think...

78
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,694
There's any right or wrong way to write music.

79
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:29,597
You can do orchestral.

80
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:31,640
You can do...

81
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,285
Uh, one more.

82
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:43,117
You can do orchestral or analog, like here I have some bananas hooked up through wires.

83
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,661
Or this crazy guy, Savi Lozano down here.

84
00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:52,105
He can play music on anything.

85
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:59,331
My point is that it doesn't matter how you make the music, but the music has to be emotional somehow.

86
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,053
For me, music is all about emotions.

87
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:09,791
So music that makes you feel one way or another is doing something right,

88
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:14,234
and a track that doesn't make you feel anything is pretty useless for me.

89
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:17,176
So I made this pretty little chart for you,

90
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:22,661
and what I'm trying to say is that any emotion is good,

91
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:25,002
but the guy on the right, you want to stay away from that.

92
00:07:25,623 --> 00:07:29,386
Because if you don't feel anything when you're writing the music,

93
00:07:29,926 --> 00:07:33,048
chances are that no one else is going to feel anything when they listen to it.

94
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:52,097
So, it's not enough to just have a perfect track when you're trying to create an emotional

95
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:52,878
scene in a game.

96
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:57,441
You also need to consider some other factors.

97
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:06,193
And that's the pace of the game, character, camera movement, what's going on, and are

98
00:08:06,213 --> 00:08:11,455
there other sounds like ambient noises, people talking, or whatever it could be.

99
00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:23,079
And the goal for me is to try and draw the player in and make them feel connected to

100
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,760
the experience.

101
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,201
And if the music doesn't fit well with the game, the player will feel disconnected.

102
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:35,495
So what you want is to create a unified, coherent experience

103
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:40,179
where the result is much larger than the individual pieces.

104
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,882
And that's not just the music and the sounds working together.

105
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:47,224
That's everything, the entire narrative.

106
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:04,125
So it doesn't matter how brilliant your music is by itself.

107
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:09,669
You can't create magic if your music doesn't work together with the other elements.

108
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:13,011
So how do you do that?

109
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:15,733
This is by far the hardest thing.

110
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:18,835
I mean, at least for me when I work on music.

111
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:20,196
Because I usually just...

112
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,969
start writing and then after a while I realized, oh, I'm writing this kind of music.

113
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:39,535
So I have an example here for Year Walk where I wrote a piece that we all really liked.

114
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:45,513
And I think I intended for it to be in the menu, but it was even too intense for the menu.

115
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:50,399
So, I'm going to play this in three versions.

116
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:53,503
This is the original version.

117
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:37,104
Okay, yeah, so the game is really, really slow.

118
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:43,646
And it actually worked really well without any music at all, but it was extremely scary.

119
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:50,407
But adding this music just made it really weird, because all of a sudden it didn't feel connected to it.

120
00:10:51,388 --> 00:11:01,090
So what I tried to do was make it slower and try and consider more the pace of the game and how delicate it was.

121
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,390
So we're going to play the next tier.

122
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:36,207
So this still didn't work. It was too intense for the game.

123
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:41,752
Like every little footstep mattered in the audio experience.

124
00:11:42,713 --> 00:11:44,995
So what I finally tried to do was...

125
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,604
record this piece without any metronome at all, just to try and get a more natural flow to it,

126
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:56,145
more like a wind or maybe someone breathing or something.

127
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:58,487
And it turned out like this.

128
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:44,026
Okay, so that finally worked, and we really felt like that enhanced the entire experience.

129
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:46,488
And we're quite happy about it.

130
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:56,116
But it can be quite a process and kind of hard, because you tend to get attached to music that you write,

131
00:12:56,136 --> 00:12:59,019
and you have to remove all the stuff that you like.

132
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:03,142
But then in the end, it makes everything better, so it's better for everyone.

133
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:09,181
So, and then there's another thing that I've been thinking about.

134
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:14,463
In most successful audio projects I've been working on,

135
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:21,007
I noticed I've been doing this, or we have been doing this,

136
00:13:21,787 --> 00:13:30,612
and in most, after realizing this, I also noticed that most games that I admire, they also do this.

137
00:13:31,672 --> 00:13:32,553
So what it is, is that,

138
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,691
a way to connect the player to the music.

139
00:13:38,672 --> 00:13:46,355
So my idea is this, that if you are at a restaurant with a friend and you're talking to each other,

140
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:50,977
you're having a good time, and your favorite song starts playing, you might not notice

141
00:13:51,057 --> 00:13:55,739
because you're so into the conversation and the drinks and everything.

142
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,320
But then if your friend would say,

143
00:13:58,681 --> 00:13:59,862
Oh, I love this song.

144
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:05,428
Then you would notice, and then you would probably pay more attention to the music.

145
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:11,735
And this is something that we did in both Year Walk and Device 6.

146
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:14,038
I don't know if we did it.

147
00:14:14,824 --> 00:14:16,965
consciously or subconsciously. We did it anyway.

148
00:14:17,945 --> 00:14:19,366
On the title screen, our ear walk,

149
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:24,648
you have to tap for the logo to appear. And every tap you do

150
00:14:25,048 --> 00:14:28,510
plays one note in the theme song. And we have parts where

151
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,071
there's this woman singing in the forest

152
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:33,252
and you have to find her.

153
00:14:34,693 --> 00:14:36,556
by listening to her voice.

154
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:43,265
And in device 6, the entire game starts with mentioning a radio,

155
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:45,528
and you will hear the music playing from the radio,

156
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:49,834
and Anna is talking about how she hates that music.

157
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:57,557
I think these things make the player aware that, oh, it's music.

158
00:14:57,638 --> 00:15:00,480
And even if you don't do this, again, throughout the whole game,

159
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,944
I think subconsciously people notice and feel a little bit more attached to the music.

160
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:15,070
And Zelda is a really good example of this.

161
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,812
Every game there's something with music.

162
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:21,635
And I think Nintendo in general is really good at doing this.

163
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:31,194
So, here's one more thing.

164
00:15:31,214 --> 00:15:38,557
We did this in both Year Walk and Devise 6.

165
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:46,501
We tried to blur the line between sound effects and music,

166
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:51,803
so the player shouldn't necessarily know if it's music playing or if it's...

167
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:57,157
a sound effect, and we did this by

168
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,569
Simon Fleser from Simogo, he can handle all the sound effects.

169
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:10,532
But he asked me to compose some sound effects with the instruments that I write the music with.

170
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:16,615
And then I handed them off to him and he would maybe change them or just use them as they were.

171
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,717
Here's one example from device 6.

172
00:16:21,137 --> 00:16:24,359
If you listen after the analog sounds in the background.

173
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:17,860
Okay, so I took those sounds and I stripped them out, and I handed them over to Simon.

174
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:28,043
And he took these and he tweaked them, and used them for transitions and other effects,

175
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:34,085
and mixed them with his own sounds.

176
00:17:34,425 --> 00:17:35,226
It was quite effectful.

177
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:39,227
And also here's some examples of bleeps and bloops that I made.

178
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:52,228
I think you can hear most of these in the game actually.

179
00:17:53,870 --> 00:18:00,096
So yeah, that's one way we try to bridge sound effects and music and bring them together

180
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:02,898
to get more of a coherent audio experience.

181
00:18:05,497 --> 00:18:10,821
Another thing I notice I've been doing in almost every project is audio collages.

182
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:15,764
So pretty early on, when you have some music and you have some sound effects,

183
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:24,489
just put it together, like edit it together and try and get a feel for how the audio will sound like.

184
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:29,393
And you will notice pretty quickly if it sounds like a game you want to play or not.

185
00:18:30,094 --> 00:18:31,515
And then you can make some decisions from that.

186
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:37,641
Here's an early collage from Year Walk before we had any sound effects in it.

187
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:51,133
This is an early version of the music too.

188
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:20,615
So from this, what stayed was the footsteps.

189
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:25,536
Although Simon spent I don't know how many hours tweaking those footsteps to perfection.

190
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:29,137
But the breath didn't make it and the scream didn't make it either.

191
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:33,198
Here's another one from device six that Simon put together.

192
00:19:36,204 --> 00:19:41,048
For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.

193
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,413
The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by federal employment,

194
00:19:47,914 --> 00:19:54,479
project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.

195
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,924
Yet in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should,

196
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:09,823
We must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive...

197
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:16,326
So this one is more of a conceptual piece, but when we heard it, I think all of us got goosebumps actually.

198
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:21,148
Because it really encapsulated what we wanted to achieve with the audio.

199
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:25,830
And I mean, it doesn't take a lot of time either, so it's really worth doing.

200
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:32,263
So is there anything else you can do to make your music fit better?

201
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:38,508
Something I always do is that I try to make a lot of contrast between the songs.

202
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:43,651
Even though all the music are in the same universe and the same world,

203
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:46,053
it doesn't mean that they have to sound all the same.

204
00:20:47,434 --> 00:20:51,256
And, I mean, these are my personal opinions, of course.

205
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:55,740
But I try to make as wide a range of emotions as possible.

206
00:20:57,436 --> 00:21:03,541
And I think it's more important that the music fits well with the scenes in the game than on a separate soundtrack.

207
00:21:04,842 --> 00:21:07,865
So that's something I usually think about.

208
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:14,971
And it's also really important to let go of your ego and listen to what other people think, because they're usually right.

209
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:25,940
And even if you get some gnarly feedback, it's a good chance for you to just improve on your work, because usually it will end up much better.

210
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:33,257
And in the end, it's not your own personal creation that matters,

211
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:35,559
it's the game as a whole that is important.

212
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,425
And if the game is excellent, people will think your music is excellent too.

213
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:50,113
Another thing that happens in almost every project is that I...

214
00:21:51,138 --> 00:21:57,324
I set up all these boundaries and I write music and then I can't write anymore because

215
00:21:57,765 --> 00:21:59,206
I feel like I don't have any more ideas.

216
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:05,052
And I usually notice this because whatever I write will sound like a really bad copy

217
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:06,273
of what I wrote previously.

218
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:16,709
So what I tried to do then is to challenge myself and challenge the boundaries that I have.

219
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:24,811
And I always think about a GDC talk from 2011 by Yoshio Sakamoto,

220
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:32,773
who made WarioWare and Rhythm Heaven, two of my favorite game franchises.

221
00:22:33,373 --> 00:22:34,593
So he says something like this.

222
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:40,982
I tell all my artists, composers, and sound guys to pull down their pants, underpants, and expose themselves.

223
00:22:43,123 --> 00:22:53,128
Of course he meant this metaphorically, but I think what he was trying to say is that they can't be afraid of exposing themselves in their work.

224
00:22:53,508 --> 00:22:56,109
Because if they're holding something back, it will show.

225
00:22:56,129 --> 00:22:59,631
And you can't be afraid to just go all in.

226
00:23:00,442 --> 00:23:04,805
And if you do that, you will just make better stuff.

227
00:23:06,006 --> 00:23:12,170
So I try to think of this when I get stuck, and I try to challenge the boundaries that I already set up,

228
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,453
and see if I can stretch the concept further.

229
00:23:17,173 --> 00:23:19,975
And don't worry about limitations or anything, I just...

230
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:25,772
just go ahead and do stuff that I shouldn't be allowed to do,

231
00:23:26,312 --> 00:23:27,512
according to my own rules.

232
00:23:28,293 --> 00:23:32,133
And a lot of times I realize that I haven't been playing the entire field.

233
00:23:33,174 --> 00:23:36,014
The concept was much bigger than I originally thought.

234
00:23:36,614 --> 00:23:42,536
And other times it will just create ideas for more music.

235
00:23:43,176 --> 00:23:46,837
So in this I'm going to play an example of a song where I...

236
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,011
I tried to challenge Simogo.

237
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:56,434
I didn't think they were going to like this because I thought it was too extreme and too

238
00:23:57,154 --> 00:23:57,935
outside the concept.

239
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:52,237
If you play the game, you will feel like this is not outside the concept.

240
00:24:52,397 --> 00:24:59,781
But at the time when I wrote it, I felt like it was definitely in the outskirts of what the concept would allow.

241
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:02,863
But Simogo loved it, and I liked it too.

242
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:06,385
And it ended up in the game, and it was all good.

243
00:25:08,846 --> 00:25:10,087
So, a little summary.

244
00:25:12,748 --> 00:25:14,649
Pay attention to the pacing of the game.

245
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:19,902
It's not important how you create the music, but it should make you feel something.

246
00:25:20,844 --> 00:25:29,734
Remind the player that the music is present, and don't forget that audio implementation is a really expressive tool.

247
00:25:29,754 --> 00:25:34,119
Oh, I guess I forgot to mention that.

248
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,722
Okay, just really quickly.

249
00:25:39,642 --> 00:25:44,983
How you implement the audio is crucial to the entire experience.

250
00:25:45,203 --> 00:25:47,624
And this is something that Simon Fleser is so good at.

251
00:25:48,184 --> 00:25:51,985
And the reason why EarWalk and Device 6 both turn out so well.

252
00:25:54,665 --> 00:26:00,206
If you think of the music and the sound effects like the chords and the melodies of a song,

253
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:06,624
The audio implementation would be the rhythm.

254
00:26:08,004 --> 00:26:16,647
And I would hand over songs to him and he would flip them backwards and pitch them up and down and layer them on top of each other.

255
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:20,629
And just create these really cool things.

256
00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:26,131
So, if you're not doing the implementation yourself...

257
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:31,680
Make sure you work really closely with the person that's doing it, and you have a tight connection.

258
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,963
Because that can really elevate something that is okay to something that is excellent.

259
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:41,586
Okay, next point is create contrast between songs.

260
00:26:42,506 --> 00:26:45,648
Don't play it safe. If you get stuck, try to challenge yourself.

261
00:26:47,469 --> 00:26:48,150
And that's all.

262
00:27:01,658 --> 00:27:03,339
I don't know if there's time for any questions.

263
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:04,580
I think we ran over time.

264
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,042
We're a little over, but we can take two questions, if there's two quick questions.

265
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:14,405
Hi, thanks for the presentation.

266
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:18,928
One of your points was creating contrast between your songs within a project.

267
00:27:19,989 --> 00:27:27,653
What elements do you focus on to maintain cohesion across all of the songs for a game?

268
00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:38,802
What I focus on to contain a coherent sound between songs, even though I try to make them different,

269
00:27:39,602 --> 00:27:46,907
is usually just sound design. I try to keep similar instruments, or if I have a certain theme,

270
00:27:47,287 --> 00:27:52,511
I try to make that go through. Or like in the VI case, I had these background noises,

271
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:54,052
I would add them in or something like that.

272
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,274
So you keep open to the idea of...

273
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:01,582
of tempo and rhythm and genre and all that sort of thing

274
00:28:01,622 --> 00:28:06,606
and just try and keep a sound palette to use across your songs,

275
00:28:06,646 --> 00:28:08,047
like the same types of sounds?

276
00:28:09,468 --> 00:28:14,091
Yeah, so if I use the same sounds between songs differently,

277
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:18,915
I always start, I create one song and then I,

278
00:28:20,016 --> 00:28:21,677
for the next song I continue with those sounds

279
00:28:21,737 --> 00:28:23,218
and then I just add on and add on

280
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,321
until I have a big library of sounds.

281
00:28:27,507 --> 00:28:27,767
Thank you.

282
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:28,348
Thank you.

283
00:28:30,949 --> 00:28:33,950
Hey, on one of your slides you had a bullet point that said

284
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,932
shortest frame of reference, and I wasn't sure if I missed it

285
00:28:37,012 --> 00:28:40,814
or you glossed over it and I was curious what that meant.

286
00:28:41,214 --> 00:28:43,535
The shortest frame of reference I was referring to

287
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:48,858
when I would listen to music, the playlists,

288
00:28:50,198 --> 00:28:55,361
and when I write music, what would be closest in my memory.

289
00:28:57,971 --> 00:28:58,231
Thank you.

290
00:29:01,556 --> 00:29:02,537
Alright, thank you very much.
