1
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:16,255
My name is Alana Cole and I'm a producer at Sledgehammer Games in Melbourne, Australia.

2
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:21,298
And I'm actually in Melbourne, Australia right now, which is not where I imagined I would be

3
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:27,262
while giving the GDC presentation. It's been a strange year for all of us and I'm sure a lot

4
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:31,825
of these presentations that we're listening to at GDC are talking about that strange year.

5
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:33,692
And this one is no different.

6
00:00:34,713 --> 00:00:38,836
So today I'm going to be talking to you about maintaining Sledgehammer Games' studio culture

7
00:00:39,197 --> 00:00:41,979
during some really rapid team growth that we've gone through,

8
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,064
which happened to coincide with a global pandemic and working from home.

9
00:00:47,544 --> 00:00:50,107
So there was a lot of change going on in our studio all at once,

10
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:53,429
and we, I think, did a very good job of handling it

11
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,292
and maintaining our studio culture throughout that process.

12
00:00:57,338 --> 00:01:01,520
So today I'm going to be going through some of the ways that we did that and some of the lessons

13
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:09,203
we've learned that you can apply to your own teams. But first a little bit about me. So like I said

14
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:14,025
I'm a producer at Sledgehammer Games. I'm a few other things as well. I'm also the founding

15
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:19,647
director of Represent Me, which is a charity based on inclusive representation of people in

16
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:21,968
games, in the games industry as well.

17
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:29,682
I write books and papers about a whole range of topics, including inclusivity and diversity

18
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:30,242
in games.

19
00:01:30,262 --> 00:01:37,589
It's me holding slash biting on a book that came out last year that I was a co-author

20
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:37,809
for.

21
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,912
I'm also the mum of several beautiful rats.

22
00:01:42,072 --> 00:01:44,715
There's a photo of three of them there.

23
00:01:45,696 --> 00:01:46,316
Rats are lovely.

24
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:49,433
In the past I've done a few other things as well.

25
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:55,054
So I've been studio support for an indie studio doing a whole bunch of different things.

26
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:59,976
So anything from recruitment to HR through to production.

27
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:04,177
I've also been a university lecturer for game design.

28
00:02:04,637 --> 00:02:10,039
So I taught introductory game design and also introductory and intermediate narrative design

29
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:10,519
during that.

30
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:13,680
I actually have my doctorate in creative writing.

31
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:18,784
So writing is where I came from, and then I kind of transitioned into production just

32
00:02:18,824 --> 00:02:25,048
because of the level of organization I already had in my life and experience I had managing

33
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:29,911
teams through acting as a director in my own business.

34
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,313
So I've kind of got a diverse background.

35
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,034
I think a lot of people in games do.

36
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:39,845
I found this has put me in good stead when helping to lead a team.

37
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:43,427
I have a lot of different hats I can wear and a lot of different skills I can use.

38
00:02:44,507 --> 00:02:47,728
You'll see different parts of this presentation where those come through.

39
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:55,771
So when I first joined Sledgehammer Games in Melbourne, the Melbourne team itself was

40
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:57,531
a team of seven people.

41
00:02:57,691 --> 00:02:58,572
I was the seventh person.

42
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:06,621
Um, and when I joined the team, the studio that we were in, um, was

43
00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:09,823
basically a small corporate office.

44
00:03:10,763 --> 00:03:15,626
Um, we couldn't really fit any more than 10 people in it comfortably.

45
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:17,907
I think it was really warm in the summer.

46
00:03:18,127 --> 00:03:19,988
Obviously Australian summers are warm already.

47
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:24,010
Um, but for the longest time, we couldn't even work out how to open a window in

48
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:29,273
that office and the air conditioner didn't cope with our servers and our equipment.

49
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,532
So some choice photos from that studio, you can see here on the left hand side.

50
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:37,953
So we had...

51
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:41,894
Let me just quickly explain some of what's going on here.

52
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:47,457
So for starters, I was the first non-engineer to join.

53
00:03:47,697 --> 00:03:51,518
For some reason, the guys who were already in there, the engineers who were in there,

54
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,080
had a collection of plastic cutlery just sitting on top of their fridge.

55
00:03:57,546 --> 00:04:03,249
Because they would go across the road to the food court to get like Chinese food or whatever and they would give them like

56
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:07,611
Plastic forks and stuff and they just come back and kind of put them on top of the fridge

57
00:04:09,592 --> 00:04:11,734
They also had this couch, this really lovely couch

58
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:15,255
I'm pretty sure they found it on the side of the road and then brought it into the studio

59
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:23,280
One of the first things I did when I joined was get rid of this couch and those original guys still haven't forgiven me yet

60
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:32,115
And then the last thing is this situation with the bin and the garbage bag.

61
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:37,898
So basically, like I said, the air conditioner was not really coping with all of our equipment in this office.

62
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:42,381
And so the air conditioner that was in the server room would leak.

63
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,103
And so they came up with this fantastic contraption.

64
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:53,442
where they taped a garbage bag to the wall where the drips would fall and then use that to kind of

65
00:04:53,702 --> 00:05:00,465
funnel the water into this bin so that it wouldn't go on the ground. They also had like that yellow

66
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:06,588
cable you can see is a sensor that was connected to a raspberry pi so you could tell when the water

67
00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:14,573
was getting full. You can see how close that is to our equipment so if that was to overflow,

68
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:16,053
which it did do occasionally.

69
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:23,711
It could cause problems. So that was the before. That was when we were seven people.

70
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:31,955
So now we are at about 130 people and hiring more every week at the moment in Melbourne.

71
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:39,758
Our overall team is at like 350 or something now across multiple locations. But our Melbourne

72
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:45,221
studio is going to be moving in to this beautiful studio you can see on the right hand side.

73
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:49,152
It's in construction at the moment with the final fit out.

74
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:52,293
The building's done, but the inside fit out is still happening.

75
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:56,594
And basically, as soon as we are COVID safe to move back into studio,

76
00:05:56,614 --> 00:06:00,156
this is the beautiful place where we'll be occupying.

77
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:03,997
So you can see there's like lovely plants and like, you know,

78
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:06,618
no couch that you'd be scared to sit on.

79
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:09,959
It's a bit of an upgrade.

80
00:06:11,146 --> 00:06:19,403
And so this is in the space of like 18 months, we've gone from this kind of very small corporate office to this amazing big studio.

81
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:21,066
And, you know, we have.

82
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,914
Go on more than 10 times the size in terms of the number of people in our studio as well.

83
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:33,741
So it's a lot of change and a lot of growth in a very short time, most of which we had to coordinate and organize while we were working from home.

84
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:40,727
So whilst the stories of that beautiful corporate office and some of its strange.

85
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:50,036
Idiosyncrasies will follow us as urban myths and lore that we'll tell to our new employees as they join us.

86
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:55,140
Hopefully we won't end up with a strange pile of plastic cutlery on our new fridge.

87
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:04,909
We have a lot of these in-jokes, a lot of this lore that we chat about and talk about,

88
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,513
and for me that's a massive part of our studio culture.

89
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:16,203
So our studio culture is what I think the best studio culture I've ever experienced in a workplace.

90
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,146
And there's a bunch of reasons why that's the case.

91
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:23,410
And it's a really conscious choice from studio leadership to get it to that state.

92
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:31,839
And so if you're looking to try and either improve or kind of start a studio and create a culture.

93
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:35,428
There's some really key steps that you should follow, right?

94
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,309
So you need to start with your goal.

95
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:40,290
You need to work out what it is that you actually want to achieve

96
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,610
with the culture of your studio.

97
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,131
Then you need to ask yourselves how you achieve that.

98
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:47,151
So you need actionable steps.

99
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:50,532
You can't just say, oh, I want our studio culture to be fun

100
00:07:50,892 --> 00:07:54,593
or inclusive or relaxed or flexible.

101
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:58,154
You need to actively think about what you're going to do

102
00:07:58,234 --> 00:07:59,675
to achieve that as step two.

103
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,603
Then you need to make a commitment to those actions.

104
00:08:03,003 --> 00:08:04,125
You need to commit as a team.

105
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:05,767
You need to write it down.

106
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:09,673
You need to explain and transparently share with your team what you're trying to do.

107
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:13,938
Make that commitment publicly and within your team.

108
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,922
And make it really clear that that is what you're trying to do.

109
00:08:18,182 --> 00:08:21,242
You need to learn from any mistakes you make because it won't be perfect.

110
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,943
You won't just wake up one day and be like,

111
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,724
ah, it's exactly what we asked for. It's exactly what we were planning.

112
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:31,545
So whatever mistakes are made, you need to listen, learn from those,

113
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:35,406
and grow from that and create new commitments as a result of that.

114
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:39,367
And lastly, you need to remember the job's never done.

115
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:43,508
It's not like we have a fantastic studio culture at Sledgehammer

116
00:08:43,548 --> 00:08:45,228
and we've said great, let's just.

117
00:08:47,212 --> 00:08:51,335
Mark that off as done and put that over there and then get on with something else.

118
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:56,418
The work that is involved in creating studio culture is really important

119
00:08:56,978 --> 00:08:58,720
and we have to kind of keep maintaining that.

120
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:09,547
Cool, so there are kind of a bunch of different values that we use to explain and explore our

121
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:13,770
studio culture and come up with the different kind of actions that we want to take as part of that.

122
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:17,023
So all of these are on our website.

123
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:19,185
They're also given to all of our new employees

124
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:20,386
as soon as they join the team.

125
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:23,888
And they are designed to kind of guide us

126
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:25,189
in the direction that we want to go.

127
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,832
So we want to cultivate greatness in our team.

128
00:09:29,712 --> 00:09:31,273
So make sure that they have an environment

129
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,935
where they can all thrive and do their very best.

130
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:36,857
We want to empower every single person

131
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:38,638
on our team to be a game maker.

132
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:40,119
So no matter where they are,

133
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:41,480
we want to empower them to

134
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:45,450
have an input and have a say in what our game looks like.

135
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:51,858
We want everybody to feel like they're empowered to innovate and change and do

136
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:57,304
new and interesting things. We don't want to be following the trends, we want to be making the trends.

137
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:00,859
We want to give people the space to fail and grow.

138
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,641
So this goes back to what I was saying before about if you make mistakes,

139
00:10:04,722 --> 00:10:06,403
making sure that you learn from them.

140
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:10,805
Um, we want our team to know that making a mistake is not the end of the world.

141
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:11,966
Everyone makes mistakes.

142
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:16,749
Uh, and we want them to know that we encourage them to grow from that and,

143
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:20,792
and learn from those mistakes and never feel like they are, you know, in

144
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,653
trouble for doing something wrong.

145
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:28,291
We want to make everyone feel like they're a builder, like they're creating something.

146
00:10:28,312 --> 00:10:31,977
They're creating an amazing team, they're creating amazing games.

147
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:36,845
We're kind of working together to build something amazing together.

148
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:40,487
We want to be open, honest and transparent.

149
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,788
And this one's really, really, really important to us.

150
00:10:43,388 --> 00:10:46,410
Obviously, they all are, but this one is, you know,

151
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:50,573
we hear this kind of talked about in internal communication all the time.

152
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:54,735
You know, we're always trying to tell the team what's going on,

153
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,617
even if we don't have the whole story yet,

154
00:10:56,977 --> 00:10:59,418
just to make sure people don't feel like we're hiding anything,

155
00:10:59,498 --> 00:11:02,500
that, you know, a bunch of conversations are happening behind closed doors.

156
00:11:04,323 --> 00:11:06,324
And we are an actions over words studio.

157
00:11:07,424 --> 00:11:10,785
And this is particularly important for things like diversity and inclusivity.

158
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:18,648
We don't just say the things, we don't just, you know, make our profile picture rainbow coloured during Pride Month.

159
00:11:19,148 --> 00:11:26,231
We do a lot of work to back that up, both internally inside our studio and also externally with our community.

160
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:29,072
So these are the studio values that guide us.

161
00:11:30,728 --> 00:11:35,052
And kind of what we've done from there is figure out what that actually kind of means, right?

162
00:11:35,072 --> 00:11:38,214
So it's not just about, okay, great, you're a game maker.

163
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:43,759
It's about actively seeking feedback on our games from everybody, no matter which department they're in.

164
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:47,421
And we explain this to ourselves and we explain this to our team.

165
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:52,866
Um, we, yeah, like I, like I kind of already said, we make sure we have a safe

166
00:11:52,906 --> 00:11:56,108
environment to make mistakes and we don't keep secrets.

167
00:11:56,308 --> 00:12:00,590
We make sure people know what we know and also know if we can't

168
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,831
tell them something yet and why.

169
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:04,372
We try to be as honest about all of that as we can.

170
00:12:06,854 --> 00:12:09,495
But remember how I said, we need to do more than just have a goal.

171
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:12,877
We need to have the actions in place that we're going to take to reach that goal.

172
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:20,537
So these are some of the actions we take to achieve these handful of values that I've just kind of pulled out as examples.

173
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:26,301
So for getting feedback from everybody, we do daily play tests with the entire team.

174
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:27,222
Everyone's welcome.

175
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:28,583
Everyone can give feedback.

176
00:12:29,144 --> 00:12:32,307
Everyone can play the game that we're working on throughout the year as well.

177
00:12:32,387 --> 00:12:37,591
And just kind of say whatever, give our feedback to the right people anytime.

178
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,973
But we have dedicated play test periods for that as well.

179
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,967
We have feedback channels that people can use on Slack via email.

180
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:47,573
We make sure everyone knows the right people to talk to.

181
00:12:47,653 --> 00:12:50,880
If they do have something they want to share, we kind of open as

182
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,163
many feedback channels as we can.

183
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,347
For Fail and Grow, we share stories about our mistakes.

184
00:12:57,587 --> 00:12:58,248
We don't hide them.

185
00:12:58,408 --> 00:13:00,349
We don't pretend that we're perfect.

186
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:03,771
And that goes for leadership, not just people

187
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,073
who are on the team and making our game on the ground.

188
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:08,715
Leadership talks about their mistakes as well.

189
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:10,436
We talk about silly things that we've done

190
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:13,618
and what we learned from it, both in this studio

191
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:15,579
and in previous studios throughout our careers.

192
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,821
That's a really important part of making people feel

193
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,262
like they're safe to make mistakes,

194
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,464
that everyone's made mistakes

195
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:23,645
and this is what we got out of it.

196
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:26,936
We never call someone out for failing and learning.

197
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:31,500
You know, if someone made a mistake and failed, we never, you know, call them out for it.

198
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,881
We never embarrass them for it.

199
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:37,224
We always make sure that people feel like they know they can grow and learn from that mistake.

200
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:38,305
And we empower them to do that.

201
00:13:38,345 --> 00:13:41,428
We help them with what that looks like and what those steps are.

202
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:50,533
In terms of this open, honest and transparent, we have fortnightly Q&As with our studio leadership team.

203
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:58,877
So our studio head and our COO jump in a Slack channel, we have a form that we can use to send in questions, and they will answer whatever questions our team has.

204
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:00,858
Sometimes they're silly, sometimes they're serious.

205
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:13,405
It's usually somewhere in between and we kind of have that forum as a regular opportunity for people to hear open, honest and transparent feedback from studio leadership.

206
00:14:14,926 --> 00:14:24,352
And we also have like a lot of jokes and informal chats and that comes back to what I said originally about our culture that we have a really fun and an open culture at Sledgehammer.

207
00:14:25,352 --> 00:14:30,255
And these sorts of jokes and informal chats create this approachability with our leadership team.

208
00:14:31,314 --> 00:14:40,238
So they aren't just kind of sitting over there in their ivory tower when no one is kind of scared to talk to them because they're really relaxed and fun and silly.

209
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:47,582
And that's a really important part of how we kind of create this transparency and openness in our culture.

210
00:14:50,832 --> 00:14:53,373
So all of that is all well and good in terms of our plan,

211
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:57,514
but I also just had a chat with some people on our team about what

212
00:14:58,214 --> 00:15:02,956
they like about our studio culture. And this can be a really good check-in for

213
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:06,677
figuring out what it is you want to maintain in your studio.

214
00:15:07,077 --> 00:15:10,398
So if you ask your team, hey what do you like about our studio culture currently,

215
00:15:10,698 --> 00:15:13,199
what don't you like, this can be a really good way of

216
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,721
knowing what they value and then kind of trying to figure out how you've

217
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:18,601
cultivated that.

218
00:15:19,181 --> 00:15:24,706
And what you can keep doing to create a positive culture for your team.

219
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:29,730
So some of the callouts people had was that were inclusive, that no one has an ego,

220
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:32,813
and I think that was probably the one that was called out the most.

221
00:15:34,094 --> 00:15:37,177
No matter what level people are in the in the organization,

222
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:39,859
no one's got an ego, everyone's happy to have a chat.

223
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:42,181
Everyone's willing to help.

224
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:47,651
Which is a really important one, particularly given how many new people we have joining us.

225
00:15:48,271 --> 00:15:52,794
It's really important that everyone is willing to help each other and build this team up.

226
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:58,578
That we all have passion for our work, that we all respect each other, and that no one takes

227
00:15:58,618 --> 00:16:03,801
themselves too seriously. And that calls back to this kind of joking and informal aspect of our

228
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:09,685
culture as well. Because as you can see, we take ourselves very seriously. We obviously

229
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:14,361
look very formal and put together during every meeting that we do.

230
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:22,547
I will explain the unicorns.

231
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:27,672
So the big thing I think is this kind of jokey and informal culture, it doesn't work for

232
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:31,034
every studio ever, it doesn't work for every workplace, but it really works for us.

233
00:16:31,964 --> 00:16:33,166
And so that's the big thing, right?

234
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:37,492
It's making sure that you work out what it is that your studio should have and

235
00:16:37,532 --> 00:16:41,618
what you want it to have, what your team wants it to have, and you create and

236
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:43,340
cultivate a culture that works for them.

237
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:52,016
And so one of the big things that we think about a lot when we talk about our studio culture is about the fact that we have multiple locations.

238
00:16:52,636 --> 00:17:00,582
So even before work from home, we obviously were in Foster City and also in Melbourne, Foster City in the US and Melbourne, Australia.

239
00:17:01,743 --> 00:17:04,345
We're expanding and have additional locations happening as well.

240
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:14,273
And then when work from home happened and COVID happened, we ended up being, you know, one studio with 300 locations because we're all working from home.

241
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:22,730
And so these are some of the tips that we have kind of figured out for creating a positive culture while working from multiple locations.

242
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:29,995
And while you're working from home, while your team is split across various houses, this might be useful to you as well.

243
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,357
So number one is that communication is key.

244
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:38,131
Pretty much all of our issues can be solved with frequent communication between locations,

245
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,271
between team members.

246
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,553
The kind of biggest complaints and concerns I've had when I've run retrospectives with

247
00:17:44,573 --> 00:17:48,974
my teams is that people were finding out things too late or they weren't finding things out

248
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:49,315
at all.

249
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:54,636
And it's literally just because communication channels weren't, you know, open enough or

250
00:17:54,676 --> 00:17:59,618
people weren't sure who to share things with or people weren't sure which individuals were

251
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:01,038
working on which parts of the game.

252
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:09,205
So just creating communication channels, transparency on who is the right people to tell different bits of information,

253
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:16,111
and just making sure that that is really open and that there's lots of opportunities to talk with each other.

254
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:20,634
And not just about work, but to also talk with each other about other things, you know.

255
00:18:22,015 --> 00:18:26,516
Really important and useful information tends to come through informal chats. It's that stuff that

256
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:31,497
you do in the studio where you get a coffee and stand in the kitchen and have a quick conversation

257
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:37,719
without finding opportunities to do that while working from home or working in multiple locations.

258
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:43,200
You miss a whole bunch of really important informal chats and

259
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,480
knowledge transfer. So finding opportunities to do that as well.

260
00:18:48,382 --> 00:18:57,305
Being proactive, so making sure you actively reach out to people and ask questions and solve problems, share what's going on with you.

261
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:03,507
Again, there's none of that kind of informal observation that we can do when we're in studio.

262
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:11,410
So it's really important that you're reaching out when you have an issue, you're reaching out when there's something going on, or you're reaching out to ask if people have problems.

263
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:17,352
Because you can't just like see someone frustrated in the studio, you don't see people at all.

264
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:26,238
Setting yourself up for success, so making sure that you know when you're going to have access

265
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:30,779
to other people. If there's multiple time zones involved it's incredibly important to think about

266
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:36,240
this because sometimes you don't have certain people accessible. They're asleep or they're

267
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:42,762
you know off hours and so rather than creating a culture where people feel like they need to

268
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:47,943
be available all the time, like as if I need to be available at 4am because Fossil City started work

269
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:48,123
then.

270
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:54,385
We're trying to create this culture where you set yourself up for success. So people in Melbourne make

271
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:59,487
sure that we have all the information that we need to finish our day before people start leaving work

272
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:05,549
and then Foster City is in the same boat where they you know make sure that they have their tasks

273
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:09,931
set up for tomorrow so they're not waiting around for half the day until Melbourne's come online.

274
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:13,192
And so this is about kind of

275
00:20:14,443 --> 00:20:18,366
Having that communication when you can have it and then setting yourself up for independent work

276
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:22,789
when you can't and making sure that during that disconnected time it's actually a positive

277
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:26,812
because you aren't in a whole bunch of meetings you can like have a solid block to get a whole

278
00:20:26,832 --> 00:20:33,637
bunch of work done. So thinking about how you can use that time effectively. And also scheduling

279
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:39,822
your phone notifications. Work-life balance is so important to our mental health and to avoiding

280
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:42,904
burnout so make sure that your phone notifications aren't always on.

281
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:48,435
While you're working from home, it is so, so easy to just start working 12-hour days

282
00:20:48,535 --> 00:20:51,537
because your office is right there next to your bed.

283
00:20:52,557 --> 00:20:58,001
So making sure that you only have notifications for Slack or work email on during your working

284
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:01,403
hours so that you're not tempted to just constantly be working.

285
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:06,825
Don't fall into the trap of responding to people from different time zones at a silly time.

286
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:11,607
Um, and like at work as well, like at Sledgehammer, we have flexible working hours.

287
00:21:12,127 --> 00:21:15,729
So even without time zones involved, you might find yourself.

288
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:22,537
You know, I work from 7 till 3 or 7 till 4 most days because I like to get up early and connect

289
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:28,383
more with the US. But then sometimes people will book meetings or want to message me at like 4 or

290
00:21:28,463 --> 00:21:34,650
5 or 6 in the afternoon because they work kind of a later start to a later end.

291
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:41,873
And so I need to be really careful not to accidentally extend my workday by still responding to those people as the day drags on.

292
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:48,016
So, yeah, that's that's an important part of creating that work life balance while in multiple locations.

293
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:59,862
Adapting to change. So some of the ways that we have found adapting to change works quite well for our team.

294
00:22:00,082 --> 00:22:02,183
And you can take these these tips on board.

295
00:22:03,084 --> 00:22:03,724
Being flexible.

296
00:22:04,853 --> 00:22:09,417
Being flexible is really valuable anyway, because even when there's not whole studio change,

297
00:22:09,597 --> 00:22:13,561
there's often individual change. People's lives are moving around and changing all the time.

298
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:19,947
And so creating flexibility so people know that they have space for those changes is really,

299
00:22:19,987 --> 00:22:24,471
really important to making them feel valued and like really important parts of the team.

300
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:28,057
So allow people to make space in their lives.

301
00:22:29,138 --> 00:22:30,880
Flexible hours are really important.

302
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,524
I think they are a really easy way to fully empower your team

303
00:22:35,624 --> 00:22:38,206
to get their work done when they can

304
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:40,088
and when it makes sense to them

305
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:42,270
without feeling like they can't, you know,

306
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:44,772
take their kid to school, right?

307
00:22:44,832 --> 00:22:46,874
So we make sure that we have the opportunity

308
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:50,618
for our team members to do whatever it is they need to do.

309
00:22:50,818 --> 00:22:51,518
Go to appointments.

310
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:56,986
Yeah, do like have commitments with their children, whether it be, you know, parent

311
00:22:57,026 --> 00:22:58,288
teacher interviews or whatever.

312
00:22:58,308 --> 00:23:04,915
Have you know, an electrician come by without it being a big deal, like creating space for

313
00:23:04,975 --> 00:23:08,358
people to have their life around their work.

314
00:23:09,407 --> 00:23:12,830
And that also comes back to what I was saying before about flexible working hours.

315
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:29,481
So like when you start when you finish provided you can kind of meet all of your expectations for attending meetings and speaking with people and kind of have that core set of hours in the middle of the day starting a bit earlier or starting a bit later and ending later or whatever it is that works for our individuals.

316
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:36,604
We pretty much support anything that we can manage to. So I highly recommend that. We have

317
00:23:37,204 --> 00:23:41,546
only positives to say about it in terms of productivity. Getting people to sit down

318
00:23:41,606 --> 00:23:48,228
between nine to five and be in their chair for that whole time doesn't work for us and

319
00:23:48,268 --> 00:23:49,449
doesn't work for a lot of people.

320
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:56,126
Encourage and model self-care. Self-care is really, really important.

321
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:01,429
Self-care is anything from, you know, going for a walk halfway through the day

322
00:24:01,469 --> 00:24:03,231
because you really need to get away from your screen

323
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:07,433
to having a mental health day off because your mental health is

324
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:12,276
is having a hard time. And it can also be difficult decisions. It can be,

325
00:24:12,396 --> 00:24:16,379
you know, any number of life-related decisions that you need to do

326
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,060
to better yourself and look after yourself.

327
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:24,648
And leadership should not only be encouraging their team to look after themselves in these ways,

328
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:26,869
they need to model that behavior as well.

329
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:35,452
So telling people that they can take a mental health day doesn't do as much as actively taking a mental health day and telling people you've done that.

330
00:24:36,193 --> 00:24:39,614
So leadership should be paving the way for that, making that explicit.

331
00:24:40,738 --> 00:24:43,999
Making sure that you're modeling work-life balance as well.

332
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:46,080
Telling people, hey, don't work overtime,

333
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,561
don't, you know, don't burn yourself out

334
00:24:48,941 --> 00:24:50,782
while you're also working overtime

335
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:51,882
and burning yourself out.

336
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:54,583
It's noticed, it's obvious, and it's silly.

337
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:57,785
So you need to kind of model the behavior

338
00:24:57,805 --> 00:24:58,825
that you want to see in your team.

339
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,980
I have a condition called fibromyalgia.

340
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,162
If you aren't familiar with it, there's a whole bunch of different symptoms related

341
00:25:07,202 --> 00:25:07,502
to it.

342
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,104
Basically, it's a nervous system condition.

343
00:25:10,584 --> 00:25:15,507
But one thing that I tend to find is that I get pretty bad fatigue on days where my

344
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:16,707
fibro is flaring up.

345
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:19,529
And so I'll model taking afternoon naps.

346
00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:23,191
I will actively say in, we have like a Slack channel for when you're not going to be at

347
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:27,213
the computer for a while, I'll ping in there and say, hey, going to be out for an hour

348
00:25:27,273 --> 00:25:28,133
taking an afternoon nap.

349
00:25:28,753 --> 00:25:35,275
And people respond really positively to that. No one is thinking, oh, what a lazy person. They know

350
00:25:35,315 --> 00:25:39,075
I'm going to come back. They know I'm going to get my job done. But they also know I'm looking

351
00:25:39,115 --> 00:25:43,956
after myself. And it encourages them to look after themselves, too. And overall, it just creates a

352
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:50,978
happier and healthier team. Make sure you don't undervalue your studio support. During periods

353
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:55,038
of change, especially, studio support is vitally important.

354
00:25:55,997 --> 00:25:59,698
Producers are the ones that make sure that everyone stays on track, that everyone has

355
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:04,160
a person they can quickly talk to if they need something, if they're overworked and

356
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,580
not able to get through as much.

357
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,641
HR is obviously vitally important for everyone's wellbeing, making sure they're okay.

358
00:26:11,302 --> 00:26:14,523
Operations has been invaluable while we've been working from home.

359
00:26:15,183 --> 00:26:17,203
They've been organizing care packages for people.

360
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:21,591
Making sure that people feel kind of commended and supported when they achieve things.

361
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:25,693
Organizing overtime meals or things like that if people need it.

362
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:30,615
Making sure that the work that people do isn't going unnoticed.

363
00:26:30,635 --> 00:26:36,738
Because obviously if people are in studio and a couple of periods of overtime happen,

364
00:26:36,758 --> 00:26:39,279
you can literally see it. You can see them in the studio.

365
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,981
So Operations has been really good at making sure that none of that just slips under the radar while we're at home.

366
00:26:46,493 --> 00:26:53,456
IT technicians, gosh if anybody pays attention to how work from home happens when a studio

367
00:26:53,496 --> 00:26:58,458
suddenly has to move all of their stuff from the studio to people's houses, IT technicians

368
00:26:58,518 --> 00:27:01,359
are vitally important for that process.

369
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,522
The amount of hardware and technology that we've had to move around and plug in and figure

370
00:27:07,602 --> 00:27:13,344
out how it runs and have tutorials for how to set it up on your home network, they have

371
00:27:13,384 --> 00:27:15,005
been so important for that.

372
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:21,954
recruitment as well. Like I've said, we've expanded, we've hired over 100 people in the last year.

373
00:27:22,794 --> 00:27:27,055
The only way that we can do that is recruitment and our actual, dedicated recruiters.

374
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:33,856
Obviously a lot of people, a lot of studios don't have all of these different individual roles,

375
00:27:34,136 --> 00:27:37,977
but you have people who are serving these roles, so make sure you don't undervalue them,

376
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:42,798
particularly during periods of change, during work from home, during COVID.

377
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:49,677
These people are incredibly important to making sure the studio runs and works and are just as

378
00:27:49,717 --> 00:27:55,561
valuable as any person who is like hands-on touching the code in the game. I think sometimes

379
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:58,363
different studios can forget that. They forget that, you know,

380
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:03,167
these people are developers just like anybody else. This is important development work.

381
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:09,112
And the last tip I have for adapting to change is to make time for fun.

382
00:28:10,224 --> 00:28:15,907
So it's really hard to create time to have social interaction when you're all kind of

383
00:28:16,107 --> 00:28:17,608
stressed about some sort of change.

384
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:23,171
Studio-wide jokes and fun can ease that stress so easily.

385
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:28,414
So I've got a couple of things on the side here that you might have been looking at throughout

386
00:28:28,434 --> 00:28:30,555
this slide thinking, dear God, is she going to explain those?

387
00:28:31,534 --> 00:28:42,057
The first one. So this is a weird little thing that started happening during our studio meetings when we first went to working from home because of COVID.

388
00:28:42,977 --> 00:28:56,740
So this is our lovely, lovely employee Adam. For some reason, when he started talking during studio meetings, we all started complimenting him on how great his microphone setup was. Made him sound like, you know, kind of this

389
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:07,948
radio announcer, kind of chill jazz kind of announcer voice. I don't know. You start to

390
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:12,752
kind of lose your mind a little bit when you've been working from home for a while. And so because

391
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:18,177
his microphone setup was so nice and his voice was sounding so good, he decided to start reading

392
00:29:18,237 --> 00:29:19,999
poetry at the end of our studio meetings.

393
00:29:21,474 --> 00:29:25,254
And then he would take requests, so we would send in our poems that we wanted to have read.

394
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:32,376
And our studio art manager, Nathan, made this beautiful banner that went on the slides,

395
00:29:32,436 --> 00:29:38,137
so it actually became a segment during these studio meetings. And like I said, we're expanding

396
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:42,998
this whole time, so we have new people joining, and this is just part of the studio meeting for

397
00:29:43,018 --> 00:29:46,259
them. They get to this slide, and it's suddenly poetry time, and they're like,

398
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:49,326
Okay, I guess this happens.

399
00:29:50,027 --> 00:29:53,148
Um, and it really, I think, creates an environment.

400
00:29:53,188 --> 00:29:55,609
It shows them who we are and what we value.

401
00:29:55,689 --> 00:29:59,210
And it's apparently poetry at the end of our studio meetings.

402
00:29:59,391 --> 00:30:00,731
It's having a laugh.

403
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:01,872
It's being a bit silly.

404
00:30:01,892 --> 00:30:07,174
Uh, and so then this, this other photo is our studio GM.

405
00:30:07,434 --> 00:30:08,074
Uh, that's Greg.

406
00:30:08,094 --> 00:30:12,376
That's Greg holding a photo of himself who is holding a photo of himself.

407
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:13,476
Um.

408
00:30:15,771 --> 00:30:21,435
I really wish I could explain this one, but parts of it aren't really clear even to me

409
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:23,116
and I've been here for the whole process.

410
00:30:25,018 --> 00:30:30,902
But at one point, one of our principal engineers, Andrew, decided it would be a cool idea to

411
00:30:31,482 --> 00:30:38,687
pay an artist to photoshop Greg and then put that photoshop onto a tea towel and then send

412
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:41,349
that tea towel to every single person in the studio.

413
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:42,910
I still have mine.

414
00:30:45,758 --> 00:30:52,162
And then Greg kind of had a photo of him holding up the tea towel that went around

415
00:30:52,402 --> 00:30:54,844
because it was his face, so it was holding up a photo of his own face.

416
00:30:55,785 --> 00:31:01,989
And then we had this other Photoshop made that also got sent around in some care packages that

417
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:06,292
said, you know, I'll be seeing you at happy hour, encouraging people to come to one of our social

418
00:31:07,173 --> 00:31:13,657
Zoom happy hours. And so then there was a Photoshop made of that holding the tea towel because

419
00:31:14,938 --> 00:31:17,399
I don't know, memes kind of have a life of their own.

420
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:19,139
When you start to explain them, they don't make any sense.

421
00:31:19,219 --> 00:31:23,540
Anyway, this is him holding the meme of the meme holding the tea towel.

422
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,881
It's make room for fun is the main thing.

423
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:35,444
So we try to create a lot of kind of space for our team.

424
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:42,464
So, we had, this was our team kind of before we went to work from home, it's fairly early on,

425
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:47,608
there's like eight of us out for lunch, I've forgotten what that's like. And then we also

426
00:31:47,648 --> 00:31:56,334
have kind of a team photo that we took of all of us hanging out on a Zoom call. We create kind of

427
00:31:56,454 --> 00:32:02,558
all sorts of forums for casual conversations, for chats, for learning, for creating, you know,

428
00:32:03,098 --> 00:32:03,939
relationships with people.

429
00:32:05,532 --> 00:32:09,157
Some of these spaces that we create to learn are kind of formal listen

430
00:32:09,197 --> 00:32:10,479
and learning sessions that we have.

431
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:13,843
So we'll actually have a scheduled session where people can come and learn

432
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:16,026
and have like a lecture style chat.

433
00:32:17,107 --> 00:32:19,971
Um, and then we also have a whole bunch of Slack channels where you're welcome

434
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:22,133
to ask questions and learn with each other.

435
00:32:23,481 --> 00:32:26,483
We also have lots of opportunities for casual conversation.

436
00:32:26,563 --> 00:32:28,104
So sometimes that's hangouts.

437
00:32:28,204 --> 00:32:29,786
It's like the happy hour I just mentioned.

438
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:35,170
Um, sometimes it's studio channels, like ones for hobbies and pets and memes.

439
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:39,953
Um, the meme channel is noisy and full of nonsense.

440
00:32:40,654 --> 00:32:45,217
Um, you know, in our hobbies channel, we have someone who is incredibly good

441
00:32:45,237 --> 00:32:49,440
at archery and shares photos of how many bullseyes he got this day

442
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,021
when he went out to do archery.

443
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:51,141
So.

444
00:32:51,524 --> 00:32:53,345
We have a whole range of things.

445
00:32:55,346 --> 00:33:00,788
We assign people buddies formally, so we don't just solely rely on forming organic friendships.

446
00:33:01,028 --> 00:33:04,929
This is especially important now that we're working from home, but it was really important

447
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:06,110
even when we were in studio.

448
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:12,973
Making sure somebody is there that you can call on and talk to and know will be able

449
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:15,934
to introduce you to someone or knows who to talk to about such and such.

450
00:33:16,634 --> 00:33:19,695
Having that kind of formalized channel is super important.

451
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:24,251
And letting people in on the jokes is so important.

452
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:27,813
So I'm talking about how we have all these lovely casual conversations,

453
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:30,515
these casual chats and jokes.

454
00:33:31,115 --> 00:33:33,877
But when new people are joining and the team is growing,

455
00:33:34,478 --> 00:33:36,880
it's really important that you let them in on that.

456
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,843
So for instance, we had a period of time during one of our studio meetings

457
00:33:42,263 --> 00:33:43,524
where we mentioned that...

458
00:33:44,385 --> 00:33:48,547
Lovely bucket, garbage bag, air conditioner situation.

459
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:52,990
And we took time out of that meeting to actively explain to anybody who wanted to

460
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:57,833
stick around and find out what that story was. And so we let people in on that lore.

461
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:02,576
So it's the same thing with the unicorns, right? You've seen the unicorn in the bottom corner of

462
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:09,320
my slides. You've seen the unicorn hats. There's even a unicorn hat hiding in that

463
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:12,882
Zoom photo up there on the side.

464
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:21,115
I wish I could explain with a lot of these jokes they start with I'm not really sure

465
00:34:21,135 --> 00:34:21,976
but um

466
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:26,235
When work from home started, we started sending each other weird gifts.

467
00:34:26,675 --> 00:34:28,416
And often they wouldn't get signatures on them.

468
00:34:28,436 --> 00:34:30,957
They would just arrive and you'd be like, okay, cool.

469
00:34:31,017 --> 00:34:32,178
A weird gift from work.

470
00:34:32,298 --> 00:34:33,279
I'm not sure who did this.

471
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,321
Um, and one of the main ones we thoroughly enjoyed doing was the unicorn hat.

472
00:34:39,181 --> 00:34:42,983
Um, and so a unicorn hat would appear in someone's mail and then they would.

473
00:34:43,003 --> 00:34:47,465
I have photos of it in, you know, our next zoom meeting, they

474
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:48,446
would be wearing it or something.

475
00:34:49,994 --> 00:34:51,875
I got a unicorn onesie, it's lovely.

476
00:34:52,135 --> 00:34:52,695
I still have it.

477
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,916
It's in my, it's in my wardrobe.

478
00:34:54,756 --> 00:34:59,979
Um, and it kind of escalated to the point where we sent unicorn hats to the COO and

479
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:04,741
the studio head in Foster City, because this was mostly a Melbourne thing where we

480
00:35:04,761 --> 00:35:05,922
were just sending each other unicorns.

481
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:10,724
Um, and so we kind of got them in on it and they wore theirs at a studio meeting.

482
00:35:10,884 --> 00:35:12,465
So that was one of the photos you saw earlier.

483
00:35:14,342 --> 00:35:20,108
It got to the point where we even had, um, this is our unicorn shirt hat, uh, hat shirt rather.

484
00:35:20,128 --> 00:35:26,175
Uh, so, you know, it kind of became part of the law, but obviously every new person who

485
00:35:26,215 --> 00:35:30,059
joins sees all these unicorns and it's like, I don't understand what's happening.

486
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:35,082
And even though it doesn't really make that much sense, even when you know the story,

487
00:35:35,702 --> 00:35:38,764
it's super important that we're like, oh, okay, let me tell you the story.

488
00:35:38,824 --> 00:35:40,425
So it all started with this unicorn hat.

489
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:41,626
I don't know.

490
00:35:41,726 --> 00:35:44,508
And it makes them feel like they're part of the culture, they're part of the stories.

491
00:35:45,468 --> 00:35:50,932
They're not joining some sort of strange cult and they don't know kind of what it is that's

492
00:35:50,952 --> 00:35:51,272
going on.

493
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:53,773
So bring people in, let them laugh with you.

494
00:35:56,609 --> 00:35:57,349
So that's it, right?

495
00:35:57,409 --> 00:35:59,810
Like I've gone through a whole bunch of different tips

496
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,490
that work for us.

497
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,971
They're pretty general because they are, you know,

498
00:36:05,051 --> 00:36:07,091
things that we've applied and things that we've used.

499
00:36:07,492 --> 00:36:08,992
I'm not saying that you need to go out

500
00:36:09,032 --> 00:36:11,432
and get everybody a unicorn hat in your studio,

501
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:15,193
but finding those similar sorts of channels,

502
00:36:15,253 --> 00:36:17,174
the ways to create informal conversation,

503
00:36:17,194 --> 00:36:18,914
the ways to create approachability,

504
00:36:20,154 --> 00:36:22,315
figuring out what it is your team values,

505
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:24,756
and then actively thinking about the actions

506
00:36:24,796 --> 00:36:26,116
you can take to achieve that.

507
00:36:27,176 --> 00:36:28,657
That's the main takeaway here for me.

508
00:36:30,217 --> 00:36:36,940
So here I'm in chat, I'm able to answer any questions that you have as a result of all of the things that we've talked about.

509
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,883
Just as a reminder, I've got key topics we covered up on the screen so if there's anything in these areas that you want to chat about.

510
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:50,448
Feel free to message in the chat. I'm here to help. And I'm also here on social media, Twitter.

511
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:55,053
You can see my Twitter handle down in the bottom corner as well. If there's any other questions

512
00:36:55,073 --> 00:36:58,857
that you would like to ask, anything that you want to come and chat to me about, that's the

513
00:36:58,877 --> 00:37:05,263
best way to find me. But otherwise, I hope you had a lovely time hearing about our studio culture and

514
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:05,683
learning.

515
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:09,807
Kind of from our lessons and things that we've experienced throughout this.

516
00:37:11,528 --> 00:37:17,414
Both kind of the rapid change of hiring a bunch of people and the rapid change of working from

517
00:37:17,474 --> 00:37:22,818
home all of a sudden because of a global pandemic. And I hope that there's something in that that you

518
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:25,501
can take back to your own teams as well. Thanks.
