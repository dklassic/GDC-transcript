1
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,073
Hello everyone. So I'm Zach. This is Drew. You can introduce yourself.

2
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:13,875
Yeah, my name is Drew Messenger Michaels. I have a podcast called Everybody's Talking at Once.

3
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:17,477
Zach has been on a couple of times and he didn't want to just do a talk so I'm here

4
00:00:17,877 --> 00:00:20,839
pretty much just as someone Zach enjoys talking to about his games.

5
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:25,061
So he's gonna introduce, I'm gonna back off the mic a little there, he's gonna introduce

6
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:28,903
the games that he's made over the last 10 years or so and then I'm gonna ask him a

7
00:00:28,943 --> 00:00:30,504
bunch of questions that you probably

8
00:00:30,724 --> 00:00:34,186
didn't have time to prepare because you didn't read the entire Zach-like book.

9
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,932
that recently got kick-started.

10
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:40,901
Yeah, I'm hopefully gonna get some good stuff out of you.

11
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:43,527
So, despite what it may look like, I'm in charge here.

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,431
I'm here as a provocateur, but you're in charge.

13
00:00:47,571 --> 00:00:49,712
Last year they assigned me a provocateur, but this year I

14
00:00:49,752 --> 00:00:50,412
got to bring my own.

15
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,393
OK, so we're just going to blast through this, because I

16
00:00:52,413 --> 00:00:53,553
think the discussion is what's really interesting.

17
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,014
So who here has played Zachtronics games?

18
00:00:56,574 --> 00:00:57,194
Or who hasn't?

19
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:58,295
Maybe that's the better question.

20
00:00:58,795 --> 00:01:01,196
OK, so I'll be really quick, because there's not that many

21
00:01:01,236 --> 00:01:01,656
people here.

22
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:04,017
So we're going to talk about three games mainly today.

23
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:06,337
Shenzhen I-O is the first one.

24
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:06,898
So these are the.

25
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:12,341
So from a historical standpoint of Zachtronics, we were a privately owned company, we did

26
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:15,664
indie stuff, it kind of was like whatever, blah.

27
00:01:16,044 --> 00:01:20,868
I went to work at Valve for ten months, and then after that I came back to Zachtronics

28
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:24,130
and we sold Zachtronics to another company, and that was like new Zachtronics.

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,632
And so these three games are like the new Zachtronics games.

30
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:29,854
So Shenzhen I.O. is the first one.

31
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,039
I'm just gonna show the trailer really quickly

32
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:33,960
and describe what's going on.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,420
So this is a game about, you build circuit boards

34
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:38,501
and you write code into them

35
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:40,802
and you have to build products.

36
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:43,123
You can see at the bottom

37
00:01:43,143 --> 00:01:45,043
there's like little timeline graphy things.

38
00:01:45,123 --> 00:01:46,484
Those are the inputs and outputs

39
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:48,384
to this like machine that you're constructing.

40
00:01:48,724 --> 00:01:50,345
So it's definitely like a programming game.

41
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:53,386
And there's like cool parts that you can integrate with.

42
00:01:53,926 --> 00:01:58,350
There's like a screen on the side and you can see like in this case if this was our trailer actually that we

43
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,694
We built like a circuit like the puzzle if you solve the puzzle it will light up the screen in that way

44
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:07,317
So it's like somewhere in between like a simulation and a puzzle and stuff like that

45
00:02:10,117 --> 00:02:11,598
These are just some other puzzles for it,

46
00:02:11,618 --> 00:02:12,538
just showing off the nature of it.

47
00:02:12,938 --> 00:02:14,459
The game is sort of infamous, I guess,

48
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,399
because just like TIS 100,

49
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:16,719
which is a game we did before it,

50
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,000
it has lots of documentation.

51
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,500
Like you actually have to read a manual

52
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,420
in order to play this game.

53
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:23,361
It also has a solitary game, just because.

54
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:27,142
Opus Magnum, second game that we're gonna talk about.

55
00:02:27,762 --> 00:02:28,643
Here's the trailer for this.

56
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:32,031
This is kind of a throwback to like Spacechem

57
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:33,072
or some of my older games.

58
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,776
You build a machine with inputs in the form of

59
00:02:37,077 --> 00:02:39,800
like little marbles and then outputs in the form of

60
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,822
like groups of marbles and you have to build a machine

61
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:43,423
that turns those inputs into those outputs.

62
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:44,585
So again, same formula.

63
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:46,146
I'm gonna skip some of this trailer.

64
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,850
But there's an optimization aspect to it.

65
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,712
I guess that's the primary draw of the game.

66
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:54,954
But yeah, it's about optimizing.

67
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,175
You see that now.

68
00:02:56,195 --> 00:02:57,216
That's a smaller solution.

69
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:58,638
There's an infinite number of possible

70
00:02:58,658 --> 00:02:59,759
solutions you can build.

71
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:03,202
Opus Magnum was kind of famous because it had a GIF exporter

72
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:04,203
in it that worked really well.

73
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:06,365
And I think that helped it blow up on the

74
00:03:06,405 --> 00:03:07,345
internet when it came out.

75
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:09,347
It's definitely our most successful game to date.

76
00:03:10,809 --> 00:03:12,109
It's like a fucking jewelry add-on.

77
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:13,310
Embrace Beauty is my favorite.

78
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,851
I still feel kind of gooey about writing that.

79
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:17,972
But yeah, but you can build all these cool things.

80
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:20,373
It's cool because there's a real aesthetic component to it

81
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:22,154
that is, oh, it's the Embrace Infinity.

82
00:03:22,194 --> 00:03:23,735
That's out of a Diamond commercial.

83
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:26,456
Yeah, so yeah, whatever.

84
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:26,996
Opus Magnum.

85
00:03:27,056 --> 00:03:28,397
It also has a Solitaire game in it.

86
00:03:29,597 --> 00:03:31,318
And then Exopunks is our most recent game.

87
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:34,460
Here's our kick-ass trailer.

88
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,421
This is like a 90s alternate universe hacking game.

89
00:03:39,037 --> 00:03:39,897
Okay, come on.

90
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:44,699
It's kind of cyberpunk-y.

91
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:46,959
It also has a manual in the form of a zine.

92
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:49,500
Actually, two zine issues that we sold

93
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,420
as fancy printed zines.

94
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:53,521
In it, you also write assembly code,

95
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,062
and then all the puzzles are little networks

96
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,442
that you have to accomplish things within.

97
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:01,103
So maybe you have to go find a file and bring it back.

98
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:03,223
There's one you have to hack a highway sign

99
00:04:03,263 --> 00:04:04,884
with counter-cultural messages.

100
00:04:05,724 --> 00:04:06,644
like wake up sheeple.

101
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:08,885
There's also like a game console you can program.

102
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:10,466
There's also multiplayer modes, blah blah blah,

103
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:11,426
but it's all about programming.

104
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:13,407
And they're all little scenarios.

105
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:15,228
Like here's a scenario where you have to

106
00:04:16,128 --> 00:04:17,429
like repair part of your body.

107
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:19,330
Like it's like fixing something like in the heart

108
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,990
and like the puzzle is designed after

109
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:23,191
like vaguely how your heart works

110
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:24,272
and what regulates your heartbeat.

111
00:04:26,337 --> 00:04:27,177
There's some zine pages.

112
00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:28,339
There's also a solitaire game.

113
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,564
And then there's also a second arcade bonus mini game thing.

114
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:35,005
And that's the end of this.

115
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,288
So now you guys know everything about all of our games.

116
00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:38,249
So that's cool.

117
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:38,889
Thanks for coming.

118
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,831
Yeah.

119
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:45,776
So I did a book, which is a bunch of game design sketches.

120
00:04:46,357 --> 00:04:48,158
and stuff, and some of you guys might have heard of it.

121
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:50,601
I'm gonna use this for reference,

122
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:53,103
because this has all of my sketches in it,

123
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:55,925
and so this talk is kind of based off a talk I gave at NYU,

124
00:04:57,647 --> 00:04:59,328
where I brought out a couple of documents

125
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:00,309
and showed them off.

126
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:02,251
Like now we have access to all of the documents

127
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,173
in the archive, so I'm just gonna use this for reference

128
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:06,234
once I put this into the right mode.

129
00:05:06,935 --> 00:05:08,677
Okay, yeah, okay, cool, so we're good.

130
00:05:08,697 --> 00:05:10,058
So we can get started, I think.

131
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:11,719
And then just when stuff comes up,

132
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,700
I'll just flip to it up there.

133
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,881
Yeah, I mean, so let's get started here.

134
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:19,624
For anybody who doesn't know, your process for designing a puzzle begins on paper.

135
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:20,324
Yeah. Right.

136
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:23,346
So you you make yourself a worksheet that essentially expresses

137
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:24,727
the system of the game you're working on,

138
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,328
and then you create each puzzle on one of those worksheets.

139
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,410
Yeah. So first of all, why do you do that?

140
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,130
Besides the general love of paperwork.

141
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,652
Yeah, I like paperwork, I guess, which is fair to say,

142
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:37,732
which is like a weird personal quirk.

143
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:41,134
It helps me organize my thoughts, which is kinda nice.

144
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,395
I mean, I guess like, okay,

145
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:44,236
so first you need to capture the ideas, right?

146
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:45,777
And so being able to capture is important,

147
00:05:45,797 --> 00:05:46,937
but like everything can do that, right?

148
00:05:46,957 --> 00:05:48,538
Like if you're like drawing on like a tablet

149
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,799
or like going into OneNote, that captures the information.

150
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,921
But I really like paper forms

151
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:55,722
because they give you like a format, right?

152
00:05:55,742 --> 00:05:57,603
So like, I'll pull up a picture, obviously.

153
00:05:57,643 --> 00:05:59,164
That's why we're all here, to look at these pictures.

154
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:01,585
Let's find a good one.

155
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,938
152 is the stamper in the shipyards in Infinifactory.

156
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:10,200
Is that a good one?

157
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,500
Yeah.

158
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,420
Start simpler than that maybe.

159
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:12,421
So these are fine.

160
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:13,562
So here's a good example.

161
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:14,562
This is for Infinifactory,

162
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,403
which is a game that I didn't introduce.

163
00:06:18,384 --> 00:06:19,785
I mean, like, obviously it's super crude,

164
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:21,506
but there are places to write specific things.

165
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:23,286
And it seems stupid, but like this kind of,

166
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:25,287
it forces, it allows you to create a process

167
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:27,208
that like forces your mind into that process.

168
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:29,550
And so now when I'm trying to come up with 40 of these,

169
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,330
which is difficult,

170
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,591
it's difficult to come up with a bunch of puzzles

171
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:31,971
all at once.

172
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:39,154
It's really clear what needs to be filled out and then afterwards you have like a physical record and so like with Opus Magnum

173
00:06:39,174 --> 00:06:41,495
I pinned up all of the puzzles on the wall in our conference room

174
00:06:41,855 --> 00:06:45,356
And then you could look and see like okay. Where like where is the game to say me?

175
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:49,778
Where is like where is there where's something missing where there too many puzzles like and then we can

176
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:51,118
You can do it visually.

177
00:06:51,138 --> 00:06:53,019
And I think that's a big part of our design process

178
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:55,580
in general, is creating things that when somebody looks

179
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,441
at the game state, they can visually figure out

180
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:00,481
what's going on in the game.

181
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:02,202
They can read what's going on in the game.

182
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,962
And in the same way, we've created a process

183
00:07:03,982 --> 00:07:05,703
where we can text up on the wall and just visually,

184
00:07:05,723 --> 00:07:06,623
without even having to think about it,

185
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:09,084
you can quickly assess where you're at with all your stuff.

186
00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:11,325
Right, it also probably makes it easier to figure out

187
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,586
like difficulty curves, which I imagine is really hard

188
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:14,306
with your games.

189
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:16,607
Usually we have to test those.

190
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:17,668
Well, I would hope so, yeah.

191
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:19,489
But that's probably one of the more interesting things

192
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,270
about your paper process is there is,

193
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,651
I think it's fair to say, a longer than normal period

194
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:24,931
during which you've designed the puzzle,

195
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:26,652
but no one has played it, or at least very,

196
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:27,712
very few people have played it.

197
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:30,754
It's not like a valve style iterative process

198
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:31,994
where you prototype something and then you get

199
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:33,775
a bunch of notes and then you iterate on it

200
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:34,776
within the game engine.

201
00:07:34,796 --> 00:07:36,637
It's more like you're iterating on paper.

202
00:07:36,817 --> 00:07:37,537
Yeah. Yeah.

203
00:07:38,282 --> 00:07:39,122
So that seems very different.

204
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:41,624
And is that just because paper is higher resolution than any

205
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:42,685
screen we've come up with so far?

206
00:07:42,725 --> 00:07:43,266
Yeah, that's true.

207
00:07:43,426 --> 00:07:44,066
That's also true.

208
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:44,947
Yeah, I don't know.

209
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,809
I guess it's kind of hard to defend the paper thing as a

210
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:49,170
thing that, I don't want to come out and say, you should

211
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,032
use paper as a design tool, but it's.

212
00:07:51,112 --> 00:07:52,493
I'm also not trying to talk you out of it.

213
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:56,035
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so yeah, okay

214
00:07:56,075 --> 00:08:00,937
So the other thing that I think this book and like these drawings show is that Zachtronics puzzles more than most puzzles

215
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:02,578
I think are always story beats

216
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:08,781
They can especially in these last three games. They convey something about the world or the characters. They move things forward

217
00:08:09,642 --> 00:08:13,004
I think you'd be sad if we didn't mention cool dad. Oh, yeah

218
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:17,986
We'll get to cool the bigs and or wedge of the Zachtronics universe. Yeah. Yeah

219
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:19,287
but I think

220
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:24,168
It's interesting to think of these not just as puzzles or as escalations of a single challenge,

221
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:25,329
but as expressions of a system.

222
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:28,910
That's part of why the forum thing makes sense, is Zachtronics games, more than most games,

223
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,891
rely on the player understanding what the pitch is, what the actual sense of the world

224
00:08:33,031 --> 00:08:33,131
is.

225
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:34,011
Yeah, definitely.

226
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:36,032
We can talk about that process a little bit.

227
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:40,633
So how do you decide what is going to be a toothy enough concept for a Zachtronics game?

228
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,014
Like, alchemy worked, but submarines and harvesting cultivated.

229
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:43,874
Oh, so starting at the beginning.

230
00:08:43,954 --> 00:08:44,294
Yeah, yeah.

231
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:44,614
Um...

232
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:49,957
Yeah, okay, so I guess I should explain the framework, kind of.

233
00:08:50,737 --> 00:08:54,359
So with Shenzhen I.O., we sort of started developing a process

234
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:55,960
for making these kinds of puzzle games.

235
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,001
And so, I guess, if most of you have played these games,

236
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,783
you kind of understand that the puzzles are not random.

237
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:03,804
They're connected together.

238
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,265
Each puzzle is intended to be like a small story.

239
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,586
And so this is something we've really doubled down on.

240
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:11,356
Do you know what page that's on?

241
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:11,697
Which one?

242
00:09:11,937 --> 00:09:13,398
Just like the list of pitches.

243
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:15,220
Oh yeah, there's a, let's see here, 258.

244
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:19,263
There's a bunch of, I think they're Opus Magnum ones.

245
00:09:19,383 --> 00:09:21,305
OK, yeah.

246
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:24,107
So we've actually gotten kind of locked into this process

247
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,108
now, for better or worse.

248
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:27,190
So our writer, Matthew.

249
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,912
When we come up with a pitch for a game, which we'll come back to in a second,

250
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:31,432
how do we start the first concept?

251
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:33,453
But when we actually figure out what we're making,

252
00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:36,155
like, okay, this is a game about alchemy, and you're going to build machines that do alchemy,

253
00:09:36,755 --> 00:09:39,656
we sort of started coming up with ideas for what the world is like.

254
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:42,118
It's kind of like a bullshit fantasy kind of thing.

255
00:09:42,138 --> 00:09:42,978
You know, everybody loves that.

256
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:47,420
And then I basically tasked our writer, Matthew,

257
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,242
with coming up with a list of pitches for puzzles in the game.

258
00:09:51,262 --> 00:09:52,503
And so we call them puzzle pitches.

259
00:09:53,063 --> 00:09:55,585
And each one of them is like a small little narrative thing.

260
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:57,006
And you can see some of here.

261
00:09:57,026 --> 00:09:58,728
I guess I shouldn't leave too much text on screen for too

262
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:00,270
long, because then it's going to distract you guys.

263
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,033
But the idea of.

264
00:10:03,057 --> 00:10:06,458
Well, so one of the opening puzzles in Opus Magnum is you turn lead into gold, which is

265
00:10:06,498 --> 00:10:08,399
supposed to be in real life alchemy.

266
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,661
That's like the ultimate expression of the art, but the whole joke is in this world,

267
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:12,301
that's passé.

268
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:13,182
Yeah, exactly.

269
00:10:13,242 --> 00:10:16,204
And so that's actually one of the, I think that's like one of the first real puzzle you

270
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:17,324
do is turn lead into gold.

271
00:10:17,444 --> 00:10:20,226
And so that's interesting because that one didn't come straight from Matthew.

272
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:25,548
That was like, oh, it turns out in our engine it's actually really easy to create gold from

273
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:26,589
lead and then so.

274
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:31,028
Like, we should create a pitch that captures that thing and then shove that to the front.

275
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:33,452
Some of these are more like, I would have never even thought of them.

276
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:36,586
I'm trying to think of what's a good one.

277
00:10:36,606 --> 00:10:38,567
There's one about like a stamina potion.

278
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,728
That's one of the classics for Opus Magnum.

279
00:10:41,368 --> 00:10:43,429
It's a stamina potion for an heir who,

280
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:45,190
or somebody, a member of the family

281
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,151
who was having difficulty creating an heir, maybe,

282
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:48,972
and stamina potion.

283
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:51,153
And so I would have never thought of that for a puzzle.

284
00:10:51,253 --> 00:10:52,554
Like, that's not where you come from

285
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:54,535
when you're like, oh, okay, how can I challenge people

286
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:57,216
to combine two inputs together with blah, blah, blah?

287
00:10:57,236 --> 00:10:59,277
No, and so Matthew came up with that one.

288
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,980
And then basically hand it off to me,

289
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,841
and that's where it's my job as the puzzle designer

290
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,383
to come up with, okay, what's a molecule

291
00:11:06,403 --> 00:11:07,904
that kind of evokes this thing?

292
00:11:07,924 --> 00:11:10,967
While in Opus Magnum, it's all about fake molecules,

293
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:12,008
there's no real system there.

294
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:15,632
So I was creating something that,

295
00:11:15,672 --> 00:11:17,433
how do I, like a visual language, I guess?

296
00:11:17,473 --> 00:11:19,055
Like a visual language that doesn't really map

297
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:20,956
to anything real, but something so that everything

298
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:22,338
feels real within the system,

299
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:25,601
and then map that into this puzzle.

300
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:28,863
Yeah, you're hitting the secret sauce and this might lead us to the way things get started.

301
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:32,665
But you said, I mean the exact thing you said to me one time was that you'd be in a worse

302
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:36,168
position if you were smarter, which I think is your self-effacing way of saying.

303
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:40,150
What you meant was that you have a quality, a personality quality that your audience doesn't

304
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,332
necessarily share, which is that you want things to be simpler.

305
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:45,554
When you learn about a concept or you start thinking about alchemy or you're looking at

306
00:11:45,594 --> 00:11:49,656
integrated circuits or something, your brain always wants to come up with the version that's

307
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:51,678
going to make more intuitive sense and be easier to manipulate.

308
00:11:52,118 --> 00:11:53,961
And you can see in sort of the user created levels

309
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:54,662
for some of these games,

310
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:56,705
that that's not necessarily an instinct

311
00:11:56,745 --> 00:11:58,528
that everybody who's into this kind of stuff would share.

312
00:11:58,568 --> 00:12:00,190
They want it to be a really complicated math problem

313
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:00,651
or something.

314
00:12:00,951 --> 00:12:02,694
You always want to sort of abstract it down

315
00:12:03,114 --> 00:12:05,758
to where it's gonna be repeatable and a game, essentially.

316
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:06,059
Yeah.

317
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,340
So is it fair to say that that's sort of when you know

318
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,241
that this is gonna be a Zachtronics game or could be,

319
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:13,262
is when you're able to abstract things down,

320
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:15,802
boil them to their essence like that a little bit?

321
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:16,743
Yeah, I mean I think that's,

322
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:18,023
I mean really, I mean it's,

323
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:21,384
I guess this is almost more of like a production question,

324
00:12:21,404 --> 00:12:22,604
which is like how do you know,

325
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:24,665
or how do we know when we want to make a game?

326
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:27,626
And like, we have lots of game ideas, right?

327
00:12:27,686 --> 00:12:29,826
And so it's not just like pick any game idea

328
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:31,667
and then proceed to like burn a year making it.

329
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:34,208
We have to kind of evaluate concepts and see what that,

330
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:35,368
and a lot of times it probably comes down

331
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,088
to just the confidence.

332
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:38,771
like that, it's like, I think like, okay,

333
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,332
we're gonna make a game about alchemy,

334
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:42,875
so I'm on the line to make like, a bunch of puzzles

335
00:12:42,935 --> 00:12:44,737
that are like, little like, molecules,

336
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:45,938
and that like, have enough mechanics.

337
00:12:46,038 --> 00:12:48,020
And at some point, like, in your soul,

338
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,562
it feels like, it's like, yeah,

339
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:50,903
we could probably do this, right?

340
00:12:50,923 --> 00:12:53,045
And I think for me, a part of that is figuring out

341
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:54,547
like, a simplified model of how it works.

342
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,249
I guess with alchemy, it's not real, so it's easy.

343
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:58,111
But like, with Shenzhen I.O., it was like, okay, what,

344
00:12:58,551 --> 00:12:59,152
like, what is...

345
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:02,288
a way in which players can connect things

346
00:13:02,308 --> 00:13:03,829
that look and feel like microcontrollers

347
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:05,729
without being as complicated as microcontrollers,

348
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:06,749
the idea to make it a simulation

349
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:08,209
would have never crossed my mind.

350
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,410
It's just like coming up with a simple version of it.

351
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,370
Definitely.

352
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:12,610
Yeah, and that'll allow, I mean,

353
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,871
is now the time to talk about Cool Dad,

354
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:16,371
because I think it's probably,

355
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:18,312
for anybody who hasn't played Shenzhen IO,

356
00:13:18,852 --> 00:13:19,812
Cool Dad originally was an idea

357
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:20,732
for a game you didn't release,

358
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:22,493
correct me if I'm wrong, the second Golden Age,

359
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:24,053
which is something you kind of chopped up for parts

360
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:25,633
and bits and ended up in a bunch of other games.

361
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,914
But 217, I think, is Cool Dad.

362
00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:32,716
This is, so, you know, we talked about it like really briefly when Zach was introducing the games,

363
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:34,997
but in Shenzhen IO, you're making stuff.

364
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:39,639
Very often you're making the kinds of simple electronic junk that a lot of us buy

365
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,440
and use briefly and never think about again.

366
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:47,083
In this case, there is a musical, you know, artist named Cool Dad

367
00:13:47,163 --> 00:13:51,465
who wants a bunch of light-up vape pens that will change color in sync with each other for a concert.

368
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:51,846
Yeah.

369
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:53,406
So you're creating that mechanism.

370
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:53,666
Yeah.

371
00:13:53,987 --> 00:13:54,207
Yeah.

372
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,409
So like we could, you want to talk about the creation of this puzzle?

373
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:57,049
Yes, exactly.

374
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:00,532
So like how did, like did this begin with Cool Dad being extremely funny, which I would

375
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:04,275
agree that he is, or did this begin with the idea of synchronizing lights, or is that not

376
00:14:04,295 --> 00:14:04,915
even a relevant distinction?

377
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:08,238
I think like probably the way to trace this puzzle is that it started off in A Game We

378
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:11,360
Never Made, Second Golden Age, and then it became...

379
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,762
Oh god, okay so it started off in this game, Sengen Age, where it was just a character,

380
00:14:15,782 --> 00:14:21,287
so it was just part of the story, and then from there we didn't make that game, and then

381
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:25,810
I don't even remember how it came into Shenzhen, I just love that idea, right?

382
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:31,455
I just remember that and loved it, and we sort of like worked it into the story somehow,

383
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:34,938
and then at some point I probably pitched like an idea for...

384
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,139
like what it could be physically,

385
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,740
like that it lights up, right?

386
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,500
And so there's like that,

387
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,261
like this kind of weaving together,

388
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,782
like things that I could imagine being plausible

389
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:45,883
in the world, like the mechanical system

390
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:46,744
that we've created, right?

391
00:14:46,764 --> 00:14:48,364
Like you can't just make anything with circuits.

392
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:50,145
Like it has to be something that's like a circuit,

393
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:52,506
like a problem that could be solved with circuit boards.

394
00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:54,667
So there's like a mechanical part that I'm bringing,

395
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,788
and then there's the narrative part

396
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:57,108
of like Matthew having to write something

397
00:14:57,148 --> 00:14:58,709
that he can live with and make work.

398
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,392
And then they just kind of circle around each other and push back and forth.

399
00:15:02,472 --> 00:15:05,075
And so the light-up RGB...

400
00:15:05,095 --> 00:15:07,217
The specifics of the puzzle is that you have an RGB LED

401
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:09,039
and you have to sequence the different...

402
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:11,961
You turn on red and green and blue and now it's white.

403
00:15:12,221 --> 00:15:15,865
Or you can turn on red and green and make yellow and that kind of thing.

404
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:19,628
And so that's definitely a mechanics-side thing that pushed in.

405
00:15:19,688 --> 00:15:22,711
But it was taking this story element from a previous game and it...

406
00:15:23,992 --> 00:15:26,234
It was never, at no point, I guess a lot of puzzles

407
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:28,116
are built, I mean I guess there's a lot of ways

408
00:15:28,156 --> 00:15:29,977
in which our puzzles are different from other puzzles,

409
00:15:30,017 --> 00:15:31,858
but there was never a solution in mind.

410
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,220
There wasn't even like a, oh I want players

411
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,842
to learn how to do this specific kind of thing.

412
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:39,524
It was just like, well, you know, like one common thing

413
00:15:39,544 --> 00:15:41,766
in electronics is modulating things with PWM,

414
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:42,907
which is like an electronics thing,

415
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:45,609
that like that would be a cool idea for a puzzle.

416
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:48,371
Like it's not like, like that's not like, oh God.

417
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:51,614
Like a lot of puzzle games that are really mechanical

418
00:15:51,654 --> 00:15:52,814
seem to be that like it's.

419
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:56,998
like they have an idea for a way that mechanics

420
00:15:57,018 --> 00:15:58,539
could be used together just in the game,

421
00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:00,059
not like in the universe of the game,

422
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,140
but in the game itself.

423
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,580
And it's like, oh, I'm gonna make a puzzle

424
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,741
that scratches that itch, that uses that,

425
00:16:04,981 --> 00:16:06,462
this thing I figured out as a designer.

426
00:16:06,942 --> 00:16:08,483
For us, that's never part of it, right?

427
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:10,564
It's just like, well, PWM is real in real life,

428
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:12,204
so we could make a puzzle about that.

429
00:16:12,644 --> 00:16:15,205
And then, like, Cool Dad is a character

430
00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:16,466
who's real in this universe,

431
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:17,986
and so we can synthesize those together.

432
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:19,307
But at no point is it ever about

433
00:16:19,487 --> 00:16:20,628
how players will perceive it.

434
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:21,728
It's just like, let's make something

435
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:22,728
that's real within the game.

436
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,549
Yeah, nor is it- Which is kind of crazy, I guess?

437
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:25,170
I don't know.

438
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,510
Well, I think traditional puzzle design,

439
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,071
at least, you know, like, you know,

440
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:29,352
small C conservative puzzle design,

441
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:30,973
says you make a working system

442
00:16:30,993 --> 00:16:32,293
and then you slowly take away parts.

443
00:16:32,593 --> 00:16:33,454
Yeah. And then you challenge

444
00:16:33,474 --> 00:16:35,475
the player to put those parts back in the proper place.

445
00:16:35,515 --> 00:16:37,016
And it usually is like the proper place,

446
00:16:37,056 --> 00:16:38,196
as though there's only one. Yeah.

447
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:39,217
I get the sense that you don't think

448
00:16:39,257 --> 00:16:40,297
about puzzles that way at all.

449
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:42,518
It is more like what makes sense within this universe,

450
00:16:42,538 --> 00:16:44,019
or maybe even just the universe.

451
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:46,280
Yeah. And if it's a valid problem,

452
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,021
then any solution someone's gonna come up with

453
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,762
that works within the system is by nature,

454
00:16:49,862 --> 00:16:51,003
by its nature, a valid solution.

455
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:52,023
Yeah, exactly.

456
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:52,623
Yeah.

457
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:55,764
So that's, I think, for a lot of people who design puzzles, bonkers.

458
00:16:55,784 --> 00:16:57,184
Is that fair to say?

459
00:16:57,204 --> 00:16:57,784
That would be my phrase, yeah.

460
00:16:57,824 --> 00:16:58,805
Anybody who designs puzzles?

461
00:16:59,105 --> 00:16:59,585
I guess.

462
00:16:59,705 --> 00:17:00,545
I don't even know, right?

463
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:03,346
I mean, I've never, like, and that's something that I've been wrestling with a little bit,

464
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:04,566
is like, are these even puzzles?

465
00:17:04,786 --> 00:17:06,067
Like does that even matter?

466
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:06,427
Right, right.

467
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:06,767
I don't know.

468
00:17:06,787 --> 00:17:07,547
I don't care, I guess.

469
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:08,047
I don't know.

470
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:08,147
Yeah.

471
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:09,147
Well, it's intuitive to you.

472
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:09,647
Yeah, yeah.

473
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:10,728
That's what's really interesting about it.

474
00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:13,668
I think you've said before that you've, you know, you've tried, in fact, in the book,

475
00:17:13,688 --> 00:17:15,809
there are a few just like nonograms, like Sudoku-style.

476
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,909
Yeah.

477
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:16,770
Oh yeah, yeah.

478
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:17,430
That you made.

479
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:17,931
They're bad.

480
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,512
I mean, they're not your best.

481
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,856
They're not bad, but they're not Shenzhen IO level interesting.

482
00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:26,158
Partly because they're not narrativized.

483
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:27,979
Partly because they're not your lane.

484
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,863
And partly I think because, especially with these last three games, there's always an

485
00:17:31,923 --> 00:17:35,005
insistence on a connection to the physical world of the game.

486
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:39,509
With Alchemy, with Opus Magnum, you're always making a thing that makes sense in the world.

487
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:42,432
The stamina potion makes perfect sense in the context of these great houses.

488
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:45,514
the cool dad vape pens or something that you can picture.

489
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:47,696
And that's a thing that almost exists, right?

490
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:49,737
Like, you know, color-changing vape pens are not, you know,

491
00:17:50,078 --> 00:17:50,738
all that out there.

492
00:17:51,219 --> 00:17:52,520
And even in Exapunks, you know, I mean,

493
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,641
it is one of the Zachtronics coding games,

494
00:17:55,182 --> 00:17:57,303
but it's sort of in the wrapper of one of the Zachtronics,

495
00:17:57,323 --> 00:17:59,165
I think what you've referred to as the gluing spheres

496
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:00,346
together games, right?

497
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:01,426
Like, it looks physical.

498
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:02,848
Because the Exas, the little, you know,

499
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:05,430
executable dudes who are deploying the viruses,

500
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,791
they move around in space so you can see when it breaks.

501
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:09,832
Right, so like, do you want to talk about that for a quick second?

502
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:10,992
Let's talk about that, yeah. I'm gonna flip back.

503
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:15,353
So this is one of our, I don't really know what the theme of this talk is, unfortunately, sorry.

504
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:17,874
It's why are Zachtronics puzzles the way they are, right?

505
00:18:17,914 --> 00:18:19,014
Or what do we do, yeah.

506
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:22,035
So this is something that's super important at Zachtronics.

507
00:18:22,355 --> 00:18:24,696
And I'm gonna show you, oh it's probably gonna start at the beginning

508
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:26,316
because I don't know how to use PowerPoint.

509
00:18:26,677 --> 00:18:28,157
Come on. No one does.

510
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:29,677
Okay, so we're gonna look at this.

511
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:34,859
So this is a game about building circuit boards and writing code.

512
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:35,679
And...

513
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:40,685
The thing I want to draw your attention to are the bevels on the sides of the chips,

514
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:43,729
and that they're physical, right?

515
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:46,773
Like it would have been really easy to make this game where they were just like symbolic

516
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:52,019
kind of rectangles, but we tried really, really, really hard to make them look extremely physical.

517
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,741
And this is one thing that I'm not really sure

518
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:55,443
even how this resonates with our players

519
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:56,685
or if it drives our success,

520
00:18:56,745 --> 00:18:59,047
but everything in the game is supposed to look like

521
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:01,410
you could just physically pick it up off the board

522
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,432
and throw it or something, right?

523
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:06,436
And it's like the Hearthstone does this pretty well, right?

524
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:07,857
Everything feels really physical.

525
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:12,202
A lot of people who make programming games and things like ours

526
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:13,484
don't do this at all.

527
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:17,088
And I like to think that this definitely makes the screenshots of our games pop more.

528
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:21,373
And like the chip on the right, we actually have a shader running to make the LCD.

529
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:25,098
There's a whole engine in Shenzhen I.O. that lets you make custom LCD screens.

530
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,680
and it actually does like a shader to layer it,

531
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,241
to make it look like you can kind of like

532
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:30,302
see the light shining through it,

533
00:19:30,322 --> 00:19:31,803
and to make it really feel physical.

534
00:19:32,263 --> 00:19:33,524
And I think this is kind of one of those things

535
00:19:33,544 --> 00:19:35,165
that maybe it's just taste and it's impossible

536
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:36,286
to tell like if it matters,

537
00:19:36,386 --> 00:19:38,948
but like all of our games are designed to be super physical.

538
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:42,151
Opus Magnum is a bit more abstract, right?

539
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:43,792
Because your alchemy table goes infinitely

540
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:44,833
in every direction and stuff.

541
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:45,653
Yeah, but it doesn't matter.

542
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:47,375
Like it's still, I guess I don't really have a,

543
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:48,776
the Solitaire game evokes the same idea.

544
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,557
The same stuff that everything is really physical

545
00:19:50,677 --> 00:19:51,118
and like really.

546
00:19:51,158 --> 00:19:53,680
You see where the marbles would actually like slot in.

547
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,321
Yeah, exactly. And like in contrast with Spacechem.

548
00:19:57,581 --> 00:19:59,922
I was gonna say, that is something Spacechem does not have at all.

549
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:03,864
Yeah, Spacechem just sort of has circles, everything looks very flat, they're floating,

550
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:07,165
there's nothing like the isometric view, for example, in Exopunks.

551
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:12,007
Exactly. And so this was a game that was sort of looking like we were maybe kind of worried

552
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:15,929
that it could be too symbolic and too abstract, and then I was playing Mega Man Battle Network

553
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,170
for weird 90s game reference or whatever.

554
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,210
It's 2000s.

555
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:21,892
And I was like, oh, we should totally

556
00:20:21,912 --> 00:20:23,794
do this as like chunky isometric platforms.

557
00:20:24,274 --> 00:20:25,435
And I don't know.

558
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:25,875
I think it works.

559
00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:27,116
I think it takes a game that would otherwise

560
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:28,537
look way more boring and like kind of.

561
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:30,084
pops it up a little bit.

562
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:35,408
Yeah, what I think, and I'm sorry if this is disappointing to anybody in the room, but

563
00:20:35,448 --> 00:20:38,810
one of the interesting things about Zachtronics puzzles is it's not possible, I don't think,

564
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,973
to talk about the puzzle design and why it works without also talking about things like

565
00:20:42,013 --> 00:20:42,853
story and art direction.

566
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:47,016
I don't think you think of those things as necessarily separate things, and maybe this

567
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:49,278
is a good time to talk about the process of creating a game.

568
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:51,380
I think for you, lately, the last three games anyway,

569
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,283
has involved primary research. You're saying you were playing Mega Man Battle Network,

570
00:20:55,683 --> 00:20:58,525
you were looking into actual hacker zines, you know, 2600 and that.

571
00:20:58,545 --> 00:21:02,869
Well that's just a personal, that's just me. It's not very often I get to put my actual

572
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:04,750
like history into our games.

573
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,112
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well I mean if you want to talk a little bit about your hacker history

574
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:07,652
maybe that's relevant.

575
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:11,475
Oh yeah, I was never a hacker but I used to read 2600 in high school and I was like obsessed

576
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:12,196
with it.

577
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:13,177
You aspired to be a hacker.

578
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:15,198
I do, yeah, that's the correct term probably.

579
00:21:15,218 --> 00:21:16,820
Yeah, I really, really wanted to be a hacker.

580
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,762
And I'm not, and never was, but,

581
00:21:19,943 --> 00:21:21,724
and I don't even know what that means, but.

582
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:25,387
But when we made ExoPunks, that was totally like

583
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:27,089
a chance to indulge that fantasy.

584
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,131
And there's, I mean, primary research is of course,

585
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:30,912
again, harder in something like Opus Magnum

586
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:32,133
where you're making it up, right?

587
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:34,155
It's a fantasy world to a certain degree.

588
00:21:34,175 --> 00:21:34,896
I think it's all made up.

589
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:38,137
Yeah, well sure, well okay, yeah, alchemy is entirely made up, but there's a history

590
00:21:38,157 --> 00:21:40,118
of people thinking about alchemy and there's also like you said...

591
00:21:40,138 --> 00:21:43,659
Oh, that's true, yeah, it is actually kind of based, I mean like, we tried to base it

592
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:49,061
off of like alchemy, which is unfortunately not a science and hard to, you know, to base

593
00:21:49,081 --> 00:21:49,361
stuff off of.

594
00:21:49,381 --> 00:21:53,683
That is unfortunate, I agree, yeah, but I guess what I'm trying to get at is you try

595
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:55,003
to make it as real as is possible.

596
00:21:55,043 --> 00:21:57,764
With Shenzhen, it's extremely real, right?

597
00:21:57,964 --> 00:22:01,365
You could have the puzzles in Shenzhen I.O. look like diagrams or something.

598
00:22:01,665 --> 00:22:03,327
And all the same visual information would be there,

599
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:05,628
they would arguably be just as readable.

600
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:06,989
But the aesthetic of that game,

601
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:08,410
where you feel like you're in a place,

602
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,092
I do think, I mean I'd be curious to hear

603
00:22:11,152 --> 00:22:12,773
what folks in the room think actually when we get to Q&A,

604
00:22:12,813 --> 00:22:15,835
but whether or not it makes it sort of easier to get into,

605
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,336
I think it definitely makes it more believable.

606
00:22:17,777 --> 00:22:18,337
And yeah, yeah.

607
00:22:18,377 --> 00:22:20,959
Yeah, so we have like the manual for Shingen.io

608
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:23,381
is filled with these data sheets like this,

609
00:22:23,401 --> 00:22:25,402
or like this, I keep forgetting the screen over there.

610
00:22:26,582 --> 00:22:31,264
And these are absolutely based off of what real data sheets look like like we printed out a bunch of real data sheets from a

611
00:22:31,304 --> 00:22:36,605
Bunch of companies and then sort of like synthesize that internally and use that like it use that to create these new things

612
00:22:36,805 --> 00:22:39,906
So the game could look like that right, but it does yeah, I think that's pretty pointed

613
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:42,986
Yeah, totally and and so we there's a funny anecdote

614
00:22:43,026 --> 00:22:48,368
I guess that we we sold like a thousand binders like like custom binders that held the data sheets in it and somebody

615
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:52,710
one of our like somebody that is like a a friend of like somebody who works at

616
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,751
the studio but also as a tronics fan bought one of these and they had it

617
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,692
sitting out at home and is his wife found it

618
00:22:58,132 --> 00:22:58,973
and was like oh

619
00:22:59,393 --> 00:23:02,854
are we are we moving to china what is what is this for you know because it has

620
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:05,856
like a fake like employment letter at the beginning of the creation for

621
00:23:05,936 --> 00:23:10,118
immigration forms and yeah i i i there's like an unfilled immigration form in the

622
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,439
beginning which is great right because i mean because that's that's a good

623
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:15,060
example of like you know that these manuals are not just utilitarian it'll

624
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,641
just teach you how to play the game you just flipped the one that's relevant to

625
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:17,742
your

626
00:23:17,782 --> 00:23:18,823
puzzle, they're roleplay.

627
00:23:18,843 --> 00:23:23,988
I mean, the immigration form is your D&D character sheet within this electronics world.

628
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:26,350
The first five pages of it are just storytelling.

629
00:23:28,052 --> 00:23:28,953
And they're storytelling throughout.

630
00:23:28,993 --> 00:23:33,157
I mean, this is probably the most integrated and true in Exapunks, where instead of a manual,

631
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:34,559
which you have with TIS-100 or Shenzhen I.O.,

632
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,683
you have zines. And these zines, you know, like some of it actually gives you practical

633
00:23:39,703 --> 00:23:42,346
information that you need in order to solve some of the puzzles, you know, unless you're

634
00:23:42,366 --> 00:23:46,009
just incredibly intuitive or you looked it up on Reddit or something. But it also has

635
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,373
a bunch of information about how these hackers relate to each other, there's recipes in it,

636
00:23:49,573 --> 00:23:53,036
and that stuff is absolutely not strictly necessary to solve any given puzzle, but it's

637
00:23:53,176 --> 00:23:57,620
100% necessary to get into the spirit. I think maybe that's more important than people realize

638
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,282
when you're dealing with super abstract puzzles.

639
00:23:59,822 --> 00:24:03,245
I guess? We don't know. We don't have any data on any of this stuff, right?

640
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:08,389
So we're not able to fork the universe and make boring X-O-Punks and fun X-O-Punks and see how they do.

641
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:12,351
You don't A-B test where it's just frictionless cubes in a blank room?

642
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:14,373
Yeah. I think it's important to me, right?

643
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:19,236
And this is how I am able to make these games, is by doing all this stuff.

644
00:24:19,256 --> 00:24:24,380
If we didn't have the story coming before everything I do, I don't know if I would even know what to do.

645
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,381
So talk to me about the primary research, for example, in Exapunks.

646
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:29,522
Like what does that process look like and why is it important to you?

647
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:32,723
Because you wanted to be a hacker, but I think it was important to you not to just remember

648
00:24:32,783 --> 00:24:36,505
what it felt like to want to be a hacker in the 90s, but to actually look at primary sources

649
00:24:36,585 --> 00:24:38,786
about people who were or wanted to be hackers in the 90s.

650
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:45,311
I think the real danger that we talk about internally is not misremembering it ourselves,

651
00:24:45,492 --> 00:24:49,356
but copying the way that other people think that they remembered it, which is weird.

652
00:24:49,376 --> 00:24:52,158
Like there's lots, like if you think of like the 90s, right, there's like a zillion games

653
00:24:52,198 --> 00:24:56,203
about the 90s out there now, and like they have a lot of stuff in common, like, you remember

654
00:24:56,243 --> 00:24:56,843
floppy disks?

655
00:24:57,464 --> 00:25:02,447
You bet yeah, do you remember the internet like you remember dial-up sounds like there you go

656
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:07,610
It's the 90s right and and for us like we also remember floppy disks and dial-up sounds and stuff

657
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,411
But we don't want to make a game

658
00:25:08,431 --> 00:25:09,411
That's just that right

659
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:13,814
And we want to like sort of put our own spin on it and one thing cool that we found especially useful with xapunks

660
00:25:13,874 --> 00:25:15,675
And now I guess we're like addicted to it is

661
00:25:16,275 --> 00:25:20,178
We went back and found a bunch of like 90s cyber culture documentation

662
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:23,240
So like I have like a stack this big of like wired magazines from the 90s

663
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,622
about an eBay you can buy it on eBay it turns out I guess it's like an ad for

664
00:25:27,682 --> 00:25:31,944
eBay buy old game you know all old stuff to use as reference materials on eBay

665
00:25:32,204 --> 00:25:37,027
yeah we have a copy of the wired style guide which tells you how to write like

666
00:25:37,107 --> 00:25:41,149
wired writers and like what cool words to use and like you know when it's like

667
00:25:41,189 --> 00:25:43,170
the I bond you can call like the

668
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,951
The internet, the information superhighway can be shortened to Ibon.

669
00:25:47,051 --> 00:25:47,991
Everyone will know what you mean.

670
00:25:48,031 --> 00:25:48,631
Yeah, exactly.

671
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:50,511
It's totally allowed, possibly encouraged.

672
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:53,032
You should make up words and they should have at least three hyphens in them because it

673
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,773
has to be like CompuGlobal, HyperMeganet.

674
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,613
Exactly, yeah.

675
00:25:56,653 --> 00:25:57,433
So we found that.

676
00:25:57,493 --> 00:26:04,975
We found too much Timothy Leary, Mondo cyberculture stuff that was actually useless it turns out.

677
00:26:06,176 --> 00:26:09,038
Maybe in a second order way because Steve Jobs was obsessed with it or whatever.

678
00:26:09,078 --> 00:26:10,559
But that comes later, right?

679
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:11,700
It's not the 90s.

680
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:17,025
So I think that comes, again, it comes through really clearly in Xapunks because a lot of

681
00:26:17,085 --> 00:26:19,787
the levels are real hacks or they're based on real hacks.

682
00:26:19,988 --> 00:26:22,169
Whether it's brute forcing a credit card or I wrote down the page number for SnacksNet

683
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:24,031
which is an Xapunks spoiler so I don't know if we...

684
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:25,012
We're going to talk about SnacksNet.

685
00:26:25,032 --> 00:26:25,292
All right.

686
00:26:25,312 --> 00:26:25,913
Let's talk about SnacksNet.

687
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:26,073
That is 341.

688
00:26:26,113 --> 00:26:26,473
So, that's 341.

689
00:26:26,573 --> 00:26:27,274
I'm going to do a countdown to 3, 2, 1. 3, 2, 1.

690
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:27,854
3. One.

691
00:26:27,874 --> 00:26:27,934
Two.

692
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:28,014
One.

693
00:26:28,035 --> 00:26:28,095
Two.

694
00:26:28,115 --> 00:26:28,175
One.

695
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:28,255
Two.

696
00:26:28,275 --> 00:26:28,335
One.

697
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:28,415
Two.

698
00:26:28,435 --> 00:26:28,555
One.

699
00:26:28,575 --> 00:26:28,675
Three.

700
00:26:28,695 --> 00:26:28,815
Three.

701
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:28,935
Three.

702
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:29,075
Three.

703
00:26:29,095 --> 00:26:29,196
Three.

704
00:26:29,216 --> 00:26:29,296
Left.

705
00:26:29,316 --> 00:26:29,396
Left.

706
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:29,516
Right.

707
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:29,676
Left.

708
00:26:29,716 --> 00:26:29,876
Left.

709
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:30,056
Right.

710
00:26:30,076 --> 00:26:30,417
Left.

711
00:26:30,557 --> 00:26:30,757
Left.

712
00:26:30,777 --> 00:26:31,137
Right.

713
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:31,237
Left.

714
00:26:31,277 --> 00:26:31,397
Right.

715
00:26:34,621 --> 00:26:37,282
Anybody here deeply sad about getting spoiled on X-Files?

716
00:26:37,302 --> 00:26:39,564
I think anybody here who cares deeply

717
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:41,204
has probably played it, so that's all right.

718
00:26:42,005 --> 00:26:44,566
So this is a really good level,

719
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,967
really good puzzle in its own right,

720
00:26:46,507 --> 00:26:48,788
but it's also a really big turning point in the story.

721
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:52,790
And it's also based on one of the more famous hacks

722
00:26:53,031 --> 00:26:53,611
in the real world.

723
00:26:53,631 --> 00:26:54,671
Do you wanna talk a little bit about that?

724
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:55,192
Yeah, I'll explain it.

725
00:26:55,232 --> 00:26:56,793
So who knows what Stuxnet is?

726
00:26:57,513 --> 00:27:00,696
So Stuxnet was a virus that got into everybody's computer,

727
00:27:00,716 --> 00:27:02,357
or worm, I guess technically not a virus,

728
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:04,920
but it got into everybody's computers like early 2000s

729
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,882
or somewhere in there, 2000, maybe not, maybe later,

730
00:27:06,902 --> 00:27:07,182
I don't know.

731
00:27:08,523 --> 00:27:11,205
And it turned out later that it was actually designed

732
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:15,429
by a government or something to specifically disable

733
00:27:15,449 --> 00:27:17,611
an Iranian nuclear centrifuge facility.

734
00:27:18,212 --> 00:27:18,892
And everybody's like, what?

735
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:20,353
That's kind of weird.

736
00:27:20,693 --> 00:27:23,074
And so when we were going through historic hacks,

737
00:27:23,134 --> 00:27:24,694
we were like, OK, we want to make a puzzle where

738
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:26,835
you have to write a virus that disables

739
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,416
a nuclear centrifuge.

740
00:27:28,676 --> 00:27:30,517
And that was kind of just a thing on its own.

741
00:27:30,537 --> 00:27:32,177
And we're like, OK, how do we fit that into the story?

742
00:27:32,578 --> 00:27:33,998
And so we had a bunch of other elements

743
00:27:34,098 --> 00:27:36,359
that we just kind of wove together and made that viable.

744
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:39,020
In the case of Exopunks, there's a convenience store

745
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,922
that is rapidly spreading and also has some sort of reality

746
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:43,402
is fake.

747
00:27:43,882 --> 00:27:45,223
cult thing going on.

748
00:27:45,303 --> 00:27:45,623
Deaf cult.

749
00:27:45,643 --> 00:27:49,526
Deaf cult, yeah, where they, um, and so this is just kind of synthesized from like stuff

750
00:27:49,546 --> 00:27:52,528
that we felt was kind of in the air, like, you know, it just seems kind of 90s, like

751
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:56,731
deaf cults, you know, tied to companies, convenience stores and stuff.

752
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:57,131
Right, right.

753
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:58,992
No, it's just kind of 90s, right?

754
00:27:59,032 --> 00:27:59,493
Like, it's...

755
00:27:59,813 --> 00:28:03,255
There was no convenience store deaf cult as far as I'm aware, but convenience stores and

756
00:28:03,295 --> 00:28:05,917
deaf cults are two of the most 90s things imaginable, so it makes sense to stick with

757
00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:06,017
that.

758
00:28:06,077 --> 00:28:08,880
them together. Yeah and so and then we were able to tie it in with like other

759
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,182
points in the story like there's a character who works there and then we're

760
00:28:11,202 --> 00:28:15,366
like okay like she can uncover this kind of thing and like yeah yeah yeah. Can you

761
00:28:15,406 --> 00:28:17,929
walk me through like the puzzle itself like what was interesting about the

762
00:28:17,969 --> 00:28:21,292
nuclear centrifuge thing from a puzzle design perspective? Turns out nothing. This is

763
00:28:21,352 --> 00:28:25,316
actually a really tough one. So I looked up documentation for nuclear centrifuges

764
00:28:25,376 --> 00:28:27,799
and tried to find out like there's actually like a huge

765
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,982
Does that sound worrying? I don't know.

766
00:28:31,262 --> 00:28:33,564
There's some murmuring.

767
00:28:33,824 --> 00:28:35,125
You know we're on camera, right?

768
00:28:35,145 --> 00:28:36,447
Yeah, it's okay.

769
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:40,270
So, well, I'll explain it for any feds listening.

770
00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:43,012
So, there's actually like,

771
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:45,575
so I was trying to figure out like, okay, what actually happened in this hack.

772
00:28:45,595 --> 00:28:47,176
So first place Wikipedia, right?

773
00:28:47,196 --> 00:28:47,937
Do some research there.

774
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:49,398
not a lot of information.

775
00:28:49,418 --> 00:28:52,159
I guess there's actually a fair amount of information,

776
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:54,079
but I found a report that was put together

777
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,800
by a security agency or something,

778
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,841
and they were talking about this is exactly what happened

779
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,082
during this hack, and this is exactly how it was supposed to work.

780
00:29:00,182 --> 00:29:02,103
It turned out they were doing two different things.

781
00:29:02,463 --> 00:29:04,143
The main thing they were doing is they were spinning up

782
00:29:04,403 --> 00:29:05,984
the centrifuges to...

783
00:29:06,364 --> 00:29:07,325
It turns out that there's like a...

784
00:29:07,785 --> 00:29:10,146
the unstable speed for the centrifuges,

785
00:29:10,186 --> 00:29:11,406
that in order to get it up to speed,

786
00:29:11,426 --> 00:29:13,287
you have to bring up the speed,

787
00:29:13,327 --> 00:29:15,148
and you have to take it through the zone where it's unstable,

788
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,008
and the solution they had, which was just to do it,

789
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,729
to get through that zone as quickly as possible,

790
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,070
but hypothetically, you could bring it down into that zone,

791
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,231
and then it would vibrate a little too much,

792
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:24,651
and then the metal would expand,

793
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:26,052
and then if you slowed it back down,

794
00:29:26,252 --> 00:29:28,413
the metal would contract, and somehow it would cause it

795
00:29:28,453 --> 00:29:31,534
to jam and then get destroyed.

796
00:29:31,554 --> 00:29:32,634
It was actually really ineffective.

797
00:29:32,654 --> 00:29:34,175
I don't think it really slowed them down at all.

798
00:29:34,195 --> 00:29:34,995
I think it was a failure.

799
00:29:36,365 --> 00:29:39,127
but create chaos it's well i don't actually don't think it really i think

800
00:29:39,147 --> 00:29:41,989
we have a chaos in the general public i think that's like the real take away of

801
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:44,991
some stuff that which is that which is kind of interesting from from a

802
00:29:45,352 --> 00:29:48,834
accident perspective anyway it's as much about what it makes reality appear to be

803
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,356
as the actual effect of the hack because a lot of the hacks you're doing in

804
00:29:51,396 --> 00:29:55,059
exopunks are stupid yeah they're making all the copiers go off at once at the

805
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:58,181
copy place or ordering a pizza you didn't pay for or like you know dumb

806
00:29:58,201 --> 00:30:02,024
stuff yeah so this one's arguably less dumb uh... so turning it into a puzzle so

807
00:30:02,064 --> 00:30:04,246
obviously like the only way to do this is like you have to like

808
00:30:04,987 --> 00:30:10,073
We're kind of stuck reflecting this reality, so we're going to have centrifuges in it,

809
00:30:10,114 --> 00:30:13,798
and then you'll increase the speed, and then hold it at a point, and then wait for it to

810
00:30:13,818 --> 00:30:16,021
shake itself to death, and then bring it back down.

811
00:30:16,101 --> 00:30:18,324
And that was the first version of the puzzle we made, and it was terrible.

812
00:30:18,344 --> 00:30:19,866
It was actually one of the worst puzzles in the game.

813
00:30:19,926 --> 00:30:21,168
It just didn't work within the system.

814
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:23,771
It's a sort of like real-time control aspect.

815
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:26,193
Like a lot of, I don't want to say it's a complaint we get,

816
00:30:26,253 --> 00:30:28,756
but a lot of our puzzles, especially like Shunshin.io

817
00:30:28,956 --> 00:30:31,859
and Exapunks, they're not like feedback systems.

818
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:33,701
It's not like, there's not like a puzzle like,

819
00:30:33,761 --> 00:30:35,663
oh, drive the car around or whatever.

820
00:30:35,723 --> 00:30:37,605
And the reason why is it's really hard to telegraph

821
00:30:37,645 --> 00:30:39,687
like what you have to do, how close you are to solving it.

822
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:41,309
If the puzzle just has like,

823
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:42,931
these are your inputs, these are your outputs.

824
00:30:43,351 --> 00:30:45,352
It's kind of limited, but it makes it really clear,

825
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:46,753
and it makes it really approachable.

826
00:30:47,194 --> 00:30:48,134
If there was a thing where it was like,

827
00:30:48,154 --> 00:30:49,655
drive this car around this simulation,

828
00:30:49,956 --> 00:30:51,937
you'd have to figure out not only how to drive the car

829
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:53,118
and how to write code that does that,

830
00:30:53,138 --> 00:30:54,299
and how to do a good job at that,

831
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,639
which is basically they all just turned down,

832
00:30:55,659 --> 00:30:57,521
they turned into writing AIs or something.

833
00:30:58,381 --> 00:30:59,702
But you'd also have to figure out,

834
00:30:59,742 --> 00:31:02,444
okay, what are the physics of this car simulation?

835
00:31:02,464 --> 00:31:04,946
And then you'd have to write a test framework

836
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:06,987
so you could directly control the car or something.

837
00:31:07,007 --> 00:31:08,208
And it was just like, no, that's just gonna,

838
00:31:08,648 --> 00:31:10,470
that's gonna get away from the point of these games, which is.

839
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:15,192
You're supposed to know what you're doing when you're supposed to write the code to do the thing that you know that you have to do.

840
00:31:15,392 --> 00:31:16,612
Yeah.

841
00:31:17,473 --> 00:31:23,875
So, again, this became a sort of feedback-based simulation where you have to get it up there and get it shaking and then bring it back.

842
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:24,736
And it didn't work at all.

843
00:31:24,776 --> 00:31:27,677
And so we ended up, this was one of the puzzles that we kind of scrapped the entire thing

844
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,138
and then made a new version of the puzzle that was just like,

845
00:31:30,158 --> 00:31:32,319
Oh God, we just need anything that'll work in this case.

846
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:36,021
So maybe that's a bad example, but we ended up making a puzzle that was better.

847
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,562
and had a gimmick, and this is actually maybe

848
00:31:38,682 --> 00:31:40,384
one of the rare examples of the kind of puzzle design

849
00:31:40,404 --> 00:31:41,344
where it's like, okay, what's something

850
00:31:41,364 --> 00:31:42,745
that would be mechanically interesting,

851
00:31:43,025 --> 00:31:45,187
and how can I make that agree enough

852
00:31:45,287 --> 00:31:46,888
with the subject material that I'm comfortable with it?

853
00:31:47,148 --> 00:31:48,749
So this would be one of the points where I compromise

854
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:50,210
and just make a bullshit puzzle,

855
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,131
and then try to integrate it better.

856
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:54,072
But it's kind of an interesting puzzle.

857
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,733
It's unlike a lot of other puzzles in the game,

858
00:31:55,773 --> 00:31:57,475
because it was designed from that kind of mechanics.

859
00:31:57,795 --> 00:31:59,036
And sneakily, this is, I think,

860
00:31:59,076 --> 00:32:00,416
the other bit of your secret sauce,

861
00:32:00,457 --> 00:32:02,478
which is that you base this stuff on the real world,

862
00:32:02,498 --> 00:32:03,799
you try to ground it as much as possible,

863
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:05,560
but you're not beholden to making it a copy

864
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,340
of the real world in any way.

865
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:06,681
Yeah.

866
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:08,942
And another good example, I mean, in TIS-100,

867
00:32:08,962 --> 00:32:11,323
you were changing the way the language worked right up

868
00:32:11,383 --> 00:32:12,524
until the game came out.

869
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,184
In all of these.

870
00:32:13,284 --> 00:32:14,265
Right, which is not something you

871
00:32:14,305 --> 00:32:16,166
could do if you were basing this on real assembly

872
00:32:16,346 --> 00:32:16,966
or something like that.

873
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:19,568
That's something people say often,

874
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:22,450
like, oh, why don't you use JavaScript or real assembly?

875
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,251
It'd be great if I could learn real arm assembly.

876
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:26,372
It's like, no, it wouldn't be great.

877
00:32:26,472 --> 00:32:27,433
Like, that would not be the same.

878
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:30,174
Yeah, Shenzhen IO is a good example of that.

879
00:32:30,234 --> 00:32:32,476
That we had the sleeping behavior work one way,

880
00:32:32,736 --> 00:32:33,997
and it just kept confusing people.

881
00:32:34,277 --> 00:32:35,958
And so instead of trying to teach them harder,

882
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:37,339
we just made it easier to use.

883
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:37,719
Right.

884
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:41,221
And there's a lot of these kind of factors

885
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:42,002
that push back and forth.

886
00:32:42,022 --> 00:32:43,923
Like, we can make something that's more realistic,

887
00:32:44,323 --> 00:32:46,104
but we can also say, OK, we're just

888
00:32:46,124 --> 00:32:48,005
going to stop and just make something

889
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:49,026
that we can actually do.

890
00:32:49,746 --> 00:32:52,008
Or with puzzles, we want to do something

891
00:32:52,028 --> 00:32:53,209
that's informed by reality, or we just

892
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:54,730
want to make something that's mechanically sound.

893
00:32:55,459 --> 00:33:00,003
Yeah. How do you know when you've pushed it too far or not far enough as far as it being reality?

894
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:03,286
Is it just instinct? Or is it seeing people have a bad time?

895
00:33:03,686 --> 00:33:07,449
You can't... Okay, yeah, so when somebody's playing your game and having a bad time, you know you're fucked up.

896
00:33:07,629 --> 00:33:09,631
Sure. That's like the only objective measurement.

897
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:12,453
And I don't even mean having a bad time, because people don't have a good time with our games anyway,

898
00:33:12,494 --> 00:33:17,678
and they're notoriously difficult to playtest because people don't feel good about, like, our games in the short run.

899
00:33:17,698 --> 00:33:21,161
Was it in Finifactory, where your wife was testing a puzzle and it took her eight hours to realize,

900
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:22,022
oh, this is impossible?

901
00:33:22,122 --> 00:33:23,042
Yeah, yeah.

902
00:33:23,182 --> 00:33:24,203
I didn't accept that it was.

903
00:33:24,223 --> 00:33:25,204
I was like, it's not impossible.

904
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:25,824
Keep trying.

905
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,326
And yeah, she was a good sport about it.

906
00:33:28,786 --> 00:33:31,448
We've definitely had people who we were, oh, god.

907
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,910
OK, so SpaceChem had just come out.

908
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,793
And we were at a really low cost festival,

909
00:33:37,853 --> 00:33:39,073
like a local festival thing.

910
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,035
And we had set up SpaceChem on a computer.

911
00:33:41,055 --> 00:33:42,396
It was at a local school.

912
00:33:42,956 --> 00:33:45,898
And somebody came by and played it for five minutes.

913
00:33:45,938 --> 00:33:47,499
And they just kind of, and just walked away.

914
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,181
That's a common reaction to our games.

915
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:51,841
That sound.

916
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:53,521
Yeah, it's kind of disgust.

917
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:56,602
I mean, we have like Opus Magnum is set up in the IGF pavilion

918
00:33:57,082 --> 00:33:58,602
and it's just like, people are just going to walk up

919
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:00,003
and just be like, what is this?

920
00:34:00,683 --> 00:34:03,743
Well, OK, so let's talk a little bit about tutorials.

921
00:34:03,983 --> 00:34:05,944
What do you think of as the bumpy funnel?

922
00:34:06,184 --> 00:34:07,284
Oh, yeah, yeah.

923
00:34:07,824 --> 00:34:08,444
Because you, I think.

924
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:10,085
I don't always call it the bumpy funnel.

925
00:34:11,145 --> 00:34:12,605
I can cite my sources and show my work.

926
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:13,405
It's the best I got.

927
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:15,526
But it's like you, I think.

928
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:19,228
There's a little bit of chaos in what order Zachtronics puzzles are in.

929
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:22,211
It's impossible for it to be a gentle difficulty curve in sort of a traditional way.

930
00:34:22,511 --> 00:34:25,333
That's why some of the more recent ones you can pick the order you do them in to a certain

931
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:25,814
degree, right?

932
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:26,534
At least in chunks.

933
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:30,237
But I think you've said you're really careful about, let's say, the first four or the first

934
00:34:30,317 --> 00:34:32,639
five puzzles to make sure that people get on boarded.

935
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,261
The care drops dramatically over the course of the game.

936
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:40,145
The first puzzle has to work perfectly with most people and the next puzzle they have

937
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:40,926
to not get lost.

938
00:34:40,986 --> 00:34:43,728
And by the time you're halfway in, who cares if you complete the game or not?

939
00:34:44,302 --> 00:34:45,303
A lot of people don't.

940
00:34:45,423 --> 00:34:49,167
A lot of people don't, but some people do, and trying to balance for what's the right

941
00:34:49,228 --> 00:34:49,488
level.

942
00:34:49,648 --> 00:34:52,832
We can't just have a difficulty setting to make sure that everybody can find their difficulty

943
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:53,472
and get through.

944
00:34:53,513 --> 00:34:54,434
It's a puzzle game.

945
00:34:54,954 --> 00:34:57,818
If it's too easy, people complain that it's not, there's not enough there.

946
00:34:57,958 --> 00:35:00,040
If it's too hard, people will just stop playing.

947
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,323
It's unclear if you even have to beat a puzzle game to like...

948
00:35:03,024 --> 00:35:06,627
play it, right? Like feeding it is necessary? I don't know, it's like a philosophical thing.

949
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:09,250
I don't really know the answer to. I mean the more there's a story, the more it feels

950
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:14,295
like you maybe need to. Yeah. Because there's resolution. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we can, yeah,

951
00:35:14,316 --> 00:35:17,359
that's definitely a thing to think about too, is how it ties in with the story. But, yeah.

952
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:19,961
What was the original question? Well, how do you make tutorials? Oh yeah, how do you

953
00:35:19,982 --> 00:35:25,087
make tutorials? Yeah. Bumpy funnels. So, yeah, so, like I'm

954
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,601
Hypothetically, when you're doing it, there's the idea of a concept map or whatever,

955
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:33,384
in education stuff, where you start with something that you teach people first,

956
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:35,166
and you build out from there, and if you try to, like,

957
00:35:35,386 --> 00:35:37,047
I was just talking to Matthew about this yesterday,

958
00:35:37,247 --> 00:35:40,770
if you try to just jump all the way to something on the outside of this concept web,

959
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:43,993
they're not going to have the dependencies necessary to understand that.

960
00:35:44,354 --> 00:35:47,596
And this is a theory in real education, not whatever we're doing here.

961
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:54,689
that you need to figure out basically a dependency map

962
00:35:54,949 --> 00:35:57,010
of which concepts are dependent on other ones.

963
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,771
And so hypothetically, if we were really good at this,

964
00:35:58,811 --> 00:36:00,572
we could figure that out and test it

965
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:02,893
and figure out what concepts do people have to learn

966
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:03,894
before they learn other ones.

967
00:36:03,934 --> 00:36:06,876
Our games are kind of like an educational space

968
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,597
in that they have lots of concepts that work together

969
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:10,458
in emergent ways and they build on top of each other.

970
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:13,699
And I'm not smart enough to build that map, right?

971
00:36:16,117 --> 00:36:17,718
we sort of end up solving it the bad way,

972
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,358
which is that we kind of put somebody in the game,

973
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:20,518
we see where they get confused,

974
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:21,919
and then we either try to better,

975
00:36:22,499 --> 00:36:25,439
we try to create it so that they either understand it

976
00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:26,720
because we've simplified it to the point

977
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,720
where it's intuitive enough,

978
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,701
or they can learn what's going on with a tutorial.

979
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:34,121
A common thing we do in our games now

980
00:36:34,221 --> 00:36:36,402
is the first stage will be not,

981
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:38,522
so some people will suggest that they would love

982
00:36:38,542 --> 00:36:40,883
to see more half-completed puzzles in our games,

983
00:36:40,943 --> 00:36:41,843
where it's half-completed

984
00:36:41,863 --> 00:36:42,903
and you have to figure out what's missing.

985
00:36:42,963 --> 00:36:44,224
I will never make a puzzle like that.

986
00:36:44,524 --> 00:36:45,764
Well, the first puzzle is often.

987
00:36:46,124 --> 00:36:49,089
Well, the first part, no, it's that there is a solution to one puzzle over here,

988
00:36:49,189 --> 00:36:50,791
and then there is another puzzle over here.

989
00:36:50,871 --> 00:36:51,913
And it's hugely different, right?

990
00:36:51,953 --> 00:36:53,915
Because you see a fully working example here,

991
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:58,822
and then you have a space to do your own while it's still on screen at the same time.

992
00:37:00,152 --> 00:37:02,412
So Opus Magnum, the tutorial is a bunch of these.

993
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:06,914
Our other games, there's just like one of them and then you have to just like fuck off and read the manual, I guess.

994
00:37:07,054 --> 00:37:08,074
But that's... sorry.

995
00:37:08,094 --> 00:37:11,335
In Opus Magnum, you're cramming for your exam.

996
00:37:11,415 --> 00:37:12,036
Yeah, exactly.

997
00:37:12,056 --> 00:37:16,097
So it makes sense that there's a bunch of sort of guided exercises before you get set loose as a professional.

998
00:37:16,157 --> 00:37:18,298
It's funny you say it makes sense that that's the case.

999
00:37:18,398 --> 00:37:20,398
Like, obviously the story Conceit came after.

1000
00:37:20,899 --> 00:37:21,119
Sure.

1001
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:21,579
Right?

1002
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:25,702
But we want it to feel like it's obviously that way because of the story.

1003
00:37:25,782 --> 00:37:26,162
Yeah, yeah.

1004
00:37:26,402 --> 00:37:26,562
Yeah.

1005
00:37:26,882 --> 00:37:34,607
Well, you talked as well about how when you approach tutorials, the story beats are almost like the character becomes an analog for the player, in the sense of like in Opus Magnum,

1006
00:37:34,988 --> 00:37:37,770
Anateus is impatient with the fact that he has to go through a tutorial.

1007
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,050
That's your players all day.

1008
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,251
Yeah.

1009
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:46,535
In Infinifactory, the people you're seeing dead all around are the people who wash out before they get very far into the game, right?

1010
00:37:46,575 --> 00:37:47,056
That kind of stuff.

1011
00:37:47,076 --> 00:37:47,436
Exactly.

1012
00:37:47,937 --> 00:37:54,547
I think games work really well when like the, or at least our puzzle games work really well when like the player is in a similar space.

1013
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:56,730
I think that's why so many games start with like characters with amnesia.

1014
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:57,191
Yeah.

1015
00:37:57,591 --> 00:38:01,177
It's because like the player also doesn't know what happened prior to the game starting.

1016
00:38:01,217 --> 00:38:02,639
And also wants to know what the hell is going on.

1017
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:11,722
Yeah, exactly. And so, yeah, that's like a little story trick, is like, like, like, physically aligning, like, the mental state of the characters with the players that are on the same boat.

1018
00:38:11,762 --> 00:38:19,425
That, like, our players really wanted to skip people. We saw people complaining about wanting to skip the Opus Magnum tutorial, and it's like, oh, cool, we wrote the right story to go with it. You're totally in Anditeus.

1019
00:38:19,805 --> 00:38:24,727
Yeah, like, wanting to skip, there's a lot of layers to wanting to skip a tutorial in which the protagonist is complaining about wanting to skip.

1020
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:25,407
Yeah.

1021
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:26,007
Yeah, all right.

1022
00:38:26,288 --> 00:38:27,869
Should we put up an early puzzle while we're talking about this?

1023
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:28,329
Yeah, sure.

1024
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:32,652
Maybe like 264 is I think calcification and bonding in Opus Magnum.

1025
00:38:32,932 --> 00:38:33,173
Okay.

1026
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:34,634
Which one?

1027
00:38:34,894 --> 00:38:37,496
Maybe, oh, maybe I got the wrong page number.

1028
00:38:37,956 --> 00:38:39,657
Or maybe it's an early sketch of that concept.

1029
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:42,099
Is it the final, like the final exam puzzle?

1030
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:42,599
Yeah.

1031
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,180
This one?

1032
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,061
Yeah, there you go.

1033
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:44,201
Okay.

1034
00:38:45,177 --> 00:38:49,157
Yeah, so this is super simple, but it really sets you up for everything that comes after.

1035
00:38:49,177 --> 00:38:49,678
Yeah.

1036
00:38:49,998 --> 00:38:51,218
Yeah.

1037
00:38:51,898 --> 00:38:52,238
What about it?

1038
00:38:52,478 --> 00:38:56,239
What about, yeah, well I guess this is a good example of how you can teach somebody this

1039
00:38:56,259 --> 00:38:58,800
kind of system, because like you said, it's not the same as teaching someone fractions

1040
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,980
or biology or something like that.

1041
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,161
I think you've actually one time compared it to the Neil Stevenson book, like Anathem,

1042
00:39:03,181 --> 00:39:06,121
is that what it's called, where the monks have to learn an infinite amount of useless

1043
00:39:06,141 --> 00:39:06,621
information.

1044
00:39:06,642 --> 00:39:08,862
Oh, well that's me shitting on our games, yeah.

1045
00:39:08,962 --> 00:39:11,203
You do that a lot though, even though people like your games.

1046
00:39:11,263 --> 00:39:11,543
Yeah.

1047
00:39:11,563 --> 00:39:12,783
They're demonstrably pretty good.

1048
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:14,303
Good.

1049
00:39:14,343 --> 00:39:14,463
Like.

1050
00:39:15,223 --> 00:39:18,124
building those maps for what is essentially fake knowledge but now it's

1051
00:39:18,144 --> 00:39:20,885
gonna be useful to you within the fictional world that you're in yes

1052
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:23,705
something you guys have gotten much better like yeah space can i think it's

1053
00:39:23,725 --> 00:39:26,426
uh... you know this is i think it's fair to say space and i have the world's

1054
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:29,827
best tutorial no it's terrible okay well this is the the bumpy following it was

1055
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,087
talking about so uh...

1056
00:39:31,407 --> 00:39:34,188
so it's based on had no idea how to like teach people how to play a game like

1057
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:34,668
space camp

1058
00:39:35,268 --> 00:39:35,548
and

1059
00:39:36,128 --> 00:39:39,849
we we built a bunch of screens of text with pictures and like when you start a

1060
00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:43,170
puzzle it's like here's a full screen of text please read this understand it

1061
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,030
look at the pictures get it and then play the

1062
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:50,073
game. And it doesn't work. Surprise! And a way that you could also build tutorials, which

1063
00:39:50,133 --> 00:39:54,756
also, spoiler alert, does not work, is that you can walk people through a process and

1064
00:39:54,776 --> 00:39:59,359
you say, hey, you have no free will, like you have to... Oh, I'm gonna tell the kitten

1065
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:03,401
carousel story. It's fun. So, we'll get to that. So, what a lot of tutorials try to do

1066
00:40:03,461 --> 00:40:04,342
is they'll say that...

1067
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:10,525
like you, like, don't do anything, now click here, now click here, now click here, now click here,

1068
00:40:10,605 --> 00:40:13,787
and they kind of explain why you're doing it, but they're really just telling you click here,

1069
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:16,808
just click where we tell you to, and now you know how to do it. You're like, what, no,

1070
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:19,610
I just was telling, clicking where you told me to, and... Even if you're reading it,

1071
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,851
there's some part of your brain that's not interpreting... Exactly. The actual information.

1072
00:40:22,992 --> 00:40:25,733
So this is like a totally bogus pop-sci thing.

1073
00:40:25,753 --> 00:40:29,116
I'm going to mention a study that was done that has nothing to do with this, and then

1074
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:30,416
I'm going to draw a comparison.

1075
00:40:30,456 --> 00:40:33,298
Because I drew a comparison from a study, it's going to make it sound authoritative,

1076
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:36,620
but you shouldn't listen—you shouldn't take it that way, because that's not how these

1077
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:37,081
things work.

1078
00:40:37,141 --> 00:40:38,202
But I'm going to do it anyway.

1079
00:40:38,222 --> 00:40:40,583
We're going to illustrate how not to gather knowledge.

1080
00:40:40,623 --> 00:40:41,764
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1081
00:40:41,804 --> 00:40:44,666
Well, so in a way, this is a metaphor for how we gather knowledge.

1082
00:40:45,226 --> 00:40:47,609
So, we'll come back to that too, don't let me forget that.

1083
00:40:47,629 --> 00:40:47,949
I will not.

1084
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:53,095
So, there's a study that was done by a moral scientist in the 1960s called the kitten carousel.

1085
00:40:53,135 --> 00:40:54,377
Has anybody heard of the kitten carousel?

1086
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:56,379
If I had internet, I guess I'd pull up a picture.

1087
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,384
Yeah, so, and I'm totally probably getting it wrong, so that doesn't even matter, right?

1088
00:41:00,464 --> 00:41:01,485
Because it still works even if it's wrong.

1089
00:41:01,505 --> 00:41:02,066
It's just adding layers, yeah.

1090
00:41:02,086 --> 00:41:02,346
It's all good.

1091
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:02,466
So, um.

1092
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:02,627
So, um.

1093
00:41:02,647 --> 00:41:02,747
So, um.

1094
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:02,867
So, um.

1095
00:41:02,887 --> 00:41:02,987
So, um.

1096
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:03,107
So, um.

1097
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:03,227
So, um.

1098
00:41:03,247 --> 00:41:03,347
So, um.

1099
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:03,468
So, um.

1100
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:03,588
So, um.

1101
00:41:03,608 --> 00:41:03,708
So, um.

1102
00:41:04,412 --> 00:41:08,534
Kitten carousels, you take two kittens who were born in the dark and have never seen

1103
00:41:08,594 --> 00:41:12,096
light and therefore their eyes don't know what's going on, and then you take them out

1104
00:41:12,176 --> 00:41:15,337
of the darkness for like half an hour once a day, because it's the 60s and you can get

1105
00:41:15,377 --> 00:41:21,039
away with this shit, and you put them in this like carousel configuration where, so there's,

1106
00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:23,100
I'm gonna just kind of pantomime this.

1107
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,881
So there's like a...

1108
00:41:26,222 --> 00:41:28,623
like a cylinder, and there's like black and white stripes

1109
00:41:28,783 --> 00:41:30,945
on the cylinder, so there's like a visual pattern.

1110
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:32,325
And you put the two kittens in it,

1111
00:41:32,385 --> 00:41:33,866
and you put them on this little carousel thing.

1112
00:41:34,126 --> 00:41:36,368
And so one of the kittens can walk and walk around,

1113
00:41:36,468 --> 00:41:38,029
and when it walks, it'll pull the other cat

1114
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:39,089
the opposite direction.

1115
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:40,530
And because it's like a cylinder,

1116
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,211
the cats will see the same thing,

1117
00:41:42,511 --> 00:41:44,972
but one cat is walking and one cat is being shuffled.

1118
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:47,554
And the cat that walks will develop

1119
00:41:47,594 --> 00:41:49,515
like a functional visual cortex system,

1120
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:50,976
and the cat that is just dragged along

1121
00:41:51,016 --> 00:41:52,737
but sees the same visual input will not.

1122
00:41:53,737 --> 00:41:57,206
And so this, now science metaphor time is over.

1123
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:06,453
If you have a tutorial where you're just telling people where to click,

1124
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:09,395
and you're showing them what happens when they click,

1125
00:42:09,415 --> 00:42:12,298
and you're telling them to click it, it's not the same as somebody thinking,

1126
00:42:12,398 --> 00:42:13,759
OK, what am I trying to do?

1127
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,600
And then they click it and see the reaction.

1128
00:42:16,421 --> 00:42:17,962
Like you need that feedback loop.

1129
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:20,945
Just getting like a one-sided feedback loop where it's not a feedback loop,

1130
00:42:20,965 --> 00:42:23,967
it's just stuff coming at you, is not the same as try something,

1131
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:24,808
see what happens.

1132
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:27,210
It changes your model as you do that.

1133
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,631
The possibility of screwing up, I think, is actually really important, too.

1134
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:30,632
But not even screwing up.

1135
00:42:30,752 --> 00:42:32,814
And ideally, you want it to be that you can't screw up,

1136
00:42:32,874 --> 00:42:35,976
but you have the autonomy to take the steps, right?

1137
00:42:36,016 --> 00:42:37,918
Like, that little kitten's locked into that little thing.

1138
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:40,800
It's not going to walk out of the science experiment and live a normal kitten life.

1139
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,341
I thought science metaphor time was over, but okay, yeah.

1140
00:42:42,361 --> 00:42:43,061
It's locked in, yeah.

1141
00:42:43,142 --> 00:42:43,622
No, it's...

1142
00:42:44,102 --> 00:42:44,202
You...

1143
00:42:44,943 --> 00:42:46,184
And so this is the bumpy funnel.

1144
00:42:46,244 --> 00:42:49,786
And we got this from taking a scientific research paper,

1145
00:42:49,806 --> 00:42:51,467
at least this time from a games department,

1146
00:42:51,747 --> 00:42:54,428
and then interpreting it into a way that made us feel good

1147
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:56,089
and was not necessarily true.

1148
00:42:56,189 --> 00:42:58,791
But the way we design tutorials is a bumpy funnel,

1149
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:02,313
where you create environments where players

1150
00:43:02,353 --> 00:43:04,614
can learn on their own, but you're trying to funnel them

1151
00:43:04,674 --> 00:43:05,275
towards a goal.

1152
00:43:05,315 --> 00:43:07,696
And so they're just kind of doing literally random stuff.

1153
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:09,377
If you've ever seen somebody playtest your game,

1154
00:43:09,397 --> 00:43:10,798
they will just try random stuff because they

1155
00:43:10,818 --> 00:43:11,698
have no idea what's going on.

1156
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:13,800
But you've constructed this funnel.

1157
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,262
in a way that they're kind of like working their way towards the end stochastically,

1158
00:43:17,322 --> 00:43:18,442
whether they want to or not.

1159
00:43:19,003 --> 00:43:20,824
And that's how we design tutorials.

1160
00:43:20,904 --> 00:43:26,427
So create these experiences, these like, and it's a lot like in a platformer or whatever,

1161
00:43:26,487 --> 00:43:29,028
like you have that first level in a platformer, you're walking down a hallway and you can

1162
00:43:29,048 --> 00:43:31,970
only go right and there's a wall on the left and then it's like, there's like a little

1163
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,092
obstacle and like there's a sign on the wall that says like press A to jump and then they

1164
00:43:35,132 --> 00:43:36,152
figure out you jump over it.

1165
00:43:36,172 --> 00:43:37,393
Like that's great because it's a platformer.

1166
00:43:37,433 --> 00:43:38,994
Everybody's played platformer at this point, right?

1167
00:43:39,314 --> 00:43:39,994
But like.

1168
00:43:40,755 --> 00:43:42,375
We do the same thing with our games,

1169
00:43:42,435 --> 00:43:44,536
but it's just different because it's not necessarily

1170
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:46,236
a thing that somebody knows how to play or whatever.

1171
00:43:46,316 --> 00:43:47,636
And they may not even know what they're looking at,

1172
00:43:47,696 --> 00:43:48,196
initially, right?

1173
00:43:48,216 --> 00:43:49,417
The first time you look at an alchemy table

1174
00:43:49,437 --> 00:43:51,737
in Opus Magnum, what factually are you looking at, right?

1175
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:53,398
The game has to explain that to you in a way that,

1176
00:43:53,818 --> 00:43:55,318
at least at this point in game history,

1177
00:43:55,338 --> 00:43:57,899
people don't need platformers explained to them, generally.

1178
00:43:58,039 --> 00:43:59,699
Yeah, and that's one of the hard parts.

1179
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:01,920
We actually had to, one of the hardest levels

1180
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,440
in Opus Magnum design was the first one,

1181
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,380
where we're just trying to explain

1182
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,460
what the hell's going on.

1183
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,041
Because the idea that they're inputs

1184
00:44:07,141 --> 00:44:08,821
and you're gonna transform them into outputs

1185
00:44:09,361 --> 00:44:10,161
is like...

1186
00:44:10,842 --> 00:44:17,106
Like that's that's hard to explain weirdly like platformers are easy. Yeah, they are so so you were saying the kitten carousel

1187
00:44:17,146 --> 00:44:24,451
Yeah, for how you gather knowledge. Yeah, so it doesn't like it doesn't matter if I got the kitten carousel thing right or not

1188
00:44:24,691 --> 00:44:29,874
Mmm, right because I'm not actually talking about the development of visual cortexes, but I'm using it as like a metaphor for something

1189
00:44:29,894 --> 00:44:34,878
So it's a story right and the stories have you know, the ability to like convey information or whatever and so like

1190
00:44:35,578 --> 00:44:40,642
Like, yeah, I'm by no means an authority on the development of feline visual systems,

1191
00:44:41,022 --> 00:44:45,165
but it worked as a story to convey this idea, and it worked as inspiration.

1192
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:48,728
It feeds into the process, right?

1193
00:44:48,788 --> 00:44:50,309
And everything in our games is like that.

1194
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:53,812
I'll read about something on Wikipedia, not be an expert in it, not understand it, and

1195
00:44:53,832 --> 00:44:54,692
then make a game about it.

1196
00:44:55,733 --> 00:44:59,717
In the same sense that the goal of this talk is not to explain visual cortex development.

1197
00:44:59,737 --> 00:45:03,361
The goal of a Zachtronics game is not to teach you about the thing it's ostensibly about.

1198
00:45:03,401 --> 00:45:03,641
Yeah.

1199
00:45:03,922 --> 00:45:07,045
And in the same way that this talk is not meant to teach you how to make games, right?

1200
00:45:07,145 --> 00:45:11,830
It's just like this is information that you will then take and turn into maybe something

1201
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:12,310
useful to you.

1202
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:12,951
Yeah.

1203
00:45:12,971 --> 00:45:16,292
This might slightly be a talk about how not to make games or how not to make puzzles,

1204
00:45:16,312 --> 00:45:20,454
which is to say don't just, you know, don't take the top ten ways to make a good puzzle

1205
00:45:20,655 --> 00:45:25,537
and sort of copy paste them and, you know, even if they're not working for you or someone

1206
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,779
is not having the reaction you wanted them to, stick with it because, oh, this is how

1207
00:45:28,819 --> 00:45:30,019
it's done, this is best practice.

1208
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,240
Maybe don't do that.

1209
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,261
Maybe, yeah, I mean, you're not giving advice.

1210
00:45:33,301 --> 00:45:34,862
I can't, yeah, I don't give advice anymore.

1211
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:35,282
That's fair.

1212
00:45:35,302 --> 00:45:38,043
When did you stop giving advice and, you know, why?

1213
00:45:38,183 --> 00:45:38,844
It was gradual.

1214
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:39,404
Okay, that's fair.

1215
00:45:39,424 --> 00:45:40,024
It's because I'm full of shit.

1216
00:45:40,044 --> 00:45:40,665
I don't know.

1217
00:45:41,402 --> 00:45:45,588
I don't think, yeah, I don't think advice is like,

1218
00:45:46,089 --> 00:45:47,732
my situations are different than anybody else's.

1219
00:45:47,872 --> 00:45:49,655
So I gave a talk that was kind of like this,

1220
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,658
but more like spiritual than like technical,

1221
00:45:51,758 --> 00:45:53,281
if we can call this technical last year.

1222
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:55,404
And some of the feedback I got was they're like.

1223
00:45:56,158 --> 00:45:58,778
you know, like you should pick better people to interview

1224
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:01,779
than Zach because like he's clearly been successful.

1225
00:46:01,879 --> 00:46:02,879
And so like, you can't, you know,

1226
00:46:02,979 --> 00:46:04,460
you put this guy up there just saying like,

1227
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,940
just do your thing and like,

1228
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,941
don't try to like worry about being successful.

1229
00:46:08,961 --> 00:46:10,541
But it's like, I've already been successful.

1230
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,121
And so like it's survivorship by.

1231
00:46:12,161 --> 00:46:12,822
Yeah, exactly.

1232
00:46:12,882 --> 00:46:14,282
Like, and it's true, right?

1233
00:46:14,342 --> 00:46:16,702
And it's just like, I, yeah, I don't like, we got lucky.

1234
00:46:16,903 --> 00:46:17,963
Like I think a lot of people get lucky.

1235
00:46:18,243 --> 00:46:21,285
Yeah, like I don't know, but I'm not qualified to give anybody advice.

1236
00:46:21,305 --> 00:46:21,545
That's fair.

1237
00:46:21,565 --> 00:46:25,307
Yeah, I was trying to draw out the patterns between the games that you would say were

1238
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:29,750
either creative or commercial failures and the ones that are successes in one or both

1239
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:30,551
of those ways, right?

1240
00:46:30,611 --> 00:46:34,093
I think there are patterns, but that's not to say that's a formula that other people

1241
00:46:34,113 --> 00:46:34,413
can follow.

1242
00:46:34,453 --> 00:46:34,553
Yeah.

1243
00:46:35,234 --> 00:46:37,356
Can we talk about a late puzzle real quick?

1244
00:46:37,476 --> 00:46:40,539
So as things, how long do we want to leave for other people's questions?

1245
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:41,961
We're going to do questions.

1246
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:43,843
We're going to do a lot of them, but they're going to be really fast.

1247
00:46:44,203 --> 00:46:45,024
So there's a question.

1248
00:46:45,084 --> 00:46:45,604
Lightning round.

1249
00:46:45,664 --> 00:46:47,787
So think of your question, think of how to say it quickly.

1250
00:46:48,067 --> 00:46:49,388
Yeah, we'll get to that.

1251
00:46:49,428 --> 00:46:50,589
I'll explain the rules later.

1252
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,231
But yeah, we'll do one more thing.

1253
00:46:52,251 --> 00:46:55,194
Where are we right now?

1254
00:46:55,214 --> 00:46:55,394
Let's see. 282.

1255
00:46:55,434 --> 00:46:55,514
Yeah, 282.

1256
00:46:55,554 --> 00:46:55,635
Yeah, 282.

1257
00:46:55,675 --> 00:46:55,775
Yeah, 282.

1258
00:46:55,815 --> 00:46:55,975
Yeah, 282.

1259
00:46:56,015 --> 00:46:56,115
Yeah, 282.

1260
00:46:56,155 --> 00:46:56,275
Yeah, 282.

1261
00:46:56,315 --> 00:46:56,495
Yeah, 282.

1262
00:46:56,536 --> 00:46:56,676
Yeah, 282.

1263
00:46:56,716 --> 00:46:56,796
Yeah, 282.

1264
00:46:56,836 --> 00:46:56,936
Yeah, 282.

1265
00:46:56,976 --> 00:46:57,096
Yeah, 282.

1266
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:01,849
So you talk in the book a little bit about how often the puzzle that you think is going

1267
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:05,851
to be the last puzzle ends up being too hard to be the last puzzle.

1268
00:47:06,311 --> 00:47:06,731
Oh yeah.

1269
00:47:06,931 --> 00:47:07,712
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1270
00:47:07,932 --> 00:47:11,153
So we have a theory which is that the last puzzle in your game should not be the hardest.

1271
00:47:11,173 --> 00:47:13,054
The last anything in your game should not be the hardest.

1272
00:47:13,734 --> 00:47:20,017
And then, because sometimes people go and do this and it sucks because the last level is really hard and you just can't...

1273
00:47:20,317 --> 00:47:21,658
The last Spacechem level is pretty absurd.

1274
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:24,279
Yeah, the last Spacechem puzzle is really hard, that's kind of bad.

1275
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,340
I don't know how many people get to that and then don't complete it.

1276
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,622
It's actually a couple levels before that I've seen a lot of people complete, but nobody gets to the end of the game anyway.

1277
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:32,703
It's like how the dropout rate in grad school is really low.

1278
00:47:32,923 --> 00:47:35,924
Not because grad school is easy, but because if you're there, you're in it anyway.

1279
00:47:36,084 --> 00:47:44,348
Exactly, yeah. And so I did an escape room for the first time, and we got like all the way through, and then we got stuck on like the very last thing.

1280
00:47:44,368 --> 00:47:47,929
And it was clearly like a little difficulty tick up, and it like, we felt kind of cheated.

1281
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:50,510
It's like we came all the way, like we should be able to finish.

1282
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:50,870
Yeah.

1283
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:58,053
Right? And so, yeah, in general we try not to make the last puzzle the hardest, but at the same time, like, there's a really like strong instinct too, and I think we do it all the time.

1284
00:47:58,754 --> 00:47:59,554
We try not to.

1285
00:47:59,594 --> 00:48:03,197
You've started making the next to last puzzle super hard and then there's a gimme, not a

1286
00:48:03,237 --> 00:48:05,259
gimme, but like a, you call it a cinematic puzzle.

1287
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,221
I don't think we, I want to do that, but I don't think we pull it off.

1288
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:12,845
Like the last level in Opus Magnum I think is harder than the second to last one because

1289
00:48:12,865 --> 00:48:13,965
like I can't help myself.

1290
00:48:13,986 --> 00:48:17,728
Like it's, you just want to make a puzzle that's like wow at the end and that often

1291
00:48:17,748 --> 00:48:18,189
means harder.

1292
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:22,685
definitely the space marine game like that from years ago kind of does a good

1293
00:48:22,705 --> 00:48:23,566
job of this that like

1294
00:48:23,887 --> 00:48:27,291
the the final boss battle is almost like a quick time thing which I'm sure

1295
00:48:27,311 --> 00:48:28,152
pissed off a lot of people

1296
00:48:28,412 --> 00:48:31,236
but it was kind of a relief after like having to slog through it all that it's

1297
00:48:31,256 --> 00:48:33,278
just like oh it's just over thank god you know yeah yeah

1298
00:48:33,979 --> 00:48:34,740
That's kind of a nice thing.

1299
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,323
Yeah, other developers have embraced, like the Tomorrow Corporation games usually break

1300
00:48:38,403 --> 00:48:40,765
out of the conceit of the game for the last moment or something.

1301
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:42,967
It's usually not even a puzzle per se, it's just some stuff.

1302
00:48:43,107 --> 00:48:43,327
Yeah.

1303
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:43,867
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1304
00:48:44,528 --> 00:48:48,211
So, I mean, I feel like you've gotten better at that kind of pacing stuff, both at the

1305
00:48:48,231 --> 00:48:48,872
beginning and at the end.

1306
00:48:48,932 --> 00:48:52,094
The middle is probably still chaos, but it probably can be chaos because the whole idea

1307
00:48:52,134 --> 00:48:53,255
is being literate in the system.

1308
00:48:53,736 --> 00:48:55,497
You still divide them into chunks in a smart way.

1309
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:57,810
I mean, do you feel like you've gotten better at that?

1310
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:59,232
I think the testing is the real thing.

1311
00:48:59,332 --> 00:49:01,614
So we collect lots of metrics for all of our puzzles,

1312
00:49:01,754 --> 00:49:05,277
and so we know how hard they are, basically.

1313
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,478
And I talk about this all the time.

1314
00:49:06,558 --> 00:49:07,879
It's super important.

1315
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:10,461
I've built a metric system for a friend.

1316
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:14,485
And yeah, it's super useful.

1317
00:49:14,645 --> 00:49:15,906
You don't know what's going on in your game,

1318
00:49:15,926 --> 00:49:16,747
especially if you're making a puzzle.

1319
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:18,168
I can't imagine making a puzzle game

1320
00:49:18,468 --> 00:49:20,210
and then not having, collecting all the data

1321
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,612
about people trying stuff, not being able to solve it,

1322
00:49:22,672 --> 00:49:23,613
et cetera, stuff like that.

1323
00:49:24,573 --> 00:49:29,215
I guess people probably do it because Indies are not the best about like collecting metrics

1324
00:49:29,235 --> 00:49:29,635
from their games.

1325
00:49:29,655 --> 00:49:31,636
Yeah, we've alluded to this but I don't want to leave it unsaid too.

1326
00:49:31,676 --> 00:49:35,158
Your games have sort of an opt-in hard mode in the sense that some people care about the

1327
00:49:35,198 --> 00:49:37,258
heuristics and the histograms and some people don't.

1328
00:49:37,939 --> 00:49:41,500
That was one of the things with Opus Magnum is we actually, we wanted to make it easier

1329
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,941
to beat the game and then you could just go deeper with optimizing it and I think it worked

1330
00:49:44,961 --> 00:49:45,221
really well.

1331
00:49:45,261 --> 00:49:46,062
It made it really accessible.

1332
00:49:46,422 --> 00:49:48,903
We tried to do the same thing with Xpunks but I think it was kind of harder.

1333
00:49:49,043 --> 00:49:50,463
Like assembly programming is probably harder.

1334
00:49:50,603 --> 00:49:51,104
Is harder, yeah.

1335
00:49:51,124 --> 00:49:54,005
I mean Xpunks again is dressed up like a spatial puzzle but it really

1336
00:49:54,165 --> 00:49:56,346
is an assembly programming game when you get right down to it.

1337
00:49:57,206 --> 00:50:02,629
So last question, I think, before we go on to other people.

1338
00:50:02,649 --> 00:50:03,029
Is that good?

1339
00:50:03,049 --> 00:50:03,569
Leave that amount of time.

1340
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:08,331
So there are a few things that you have prototyped and tried to do as Actronics games that so

1341
00:50:08,352 --> 00:50:10,593
far you have not been able to do as Actronics games.

1342
00:50:11,153 --> 00:50:11,993
One thing is open world.

1343
00:50:12,153 --> 00:50:15,675
In the book you talk about a couple of things where you tried to create an open world game

1344
00:50:15,755 --> 00:50:16,475
and it didn't happen.

1345
00:50:17,236 --> 00:50:18,336
Project Typhoon you talk about.

1346
00:50:18,356 --> 00:50:18,436
Yeah.

1347
00:50:18,456 --> 00:50:18,536
Yeah.

1348
00:50:18,556 --> 00:50:18,636
Yeah.

1349
00:50:18,656 --> 00:50:18,736
Yeah.

1350
00:50:18,756 --> 00:50:18,836
Yeah.

1351
00:50:18,856 --> 00:50:18,957
Yeah.

1352
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:20,438
Oh yeah, I guess this'll, if you got the book,

1353
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:21,158
you'll find out about this.

1354
00:50:21,178 --> 00:50:22,860
There's stuff in the book we've never talked about before,

1355
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:23,720
but we can talk about it here.

1356
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:23,941
Yeah.

1357
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:25,102
Yeah, well these are unreleased games,

1358
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,002
and you talk about like, you know,

1359
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,844
you get requests from people, you know,

1360
00:50:27,904 --> 00:50:30,286
to fan remake your games that you never finished

1361
00:50:30,386 --> 00:50:31,927
or something, and you always say no,

1362
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,168
because you might do something with it later.

1363
00:50:33,709 --> 00:50:35,090
But I guess I'm interested in like,

1364
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:38,733
there's open world, and there is synchronous multiplayer,

1365
00:50:39,113 --> 00:50:41,595
are two things that have sort of never quite happened

1366
00:50:41,635 --> 00:50:42,276
in Zachtronics games.

1367
00:50:42,296 --> 00:50:43,417
You have asynchronous multiplayer,

1368
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,958
both with the histograms and with the hacker battles

1369
00:50:45,298 --> 00:50:45,939
in Exapunks.

1370
00:50:46,479 --> 00:50:49,744
But do you have a sense of what it is about those things that don't quite work?

1371
00:50:50,184 --> 00:50:52,808
Oh, well the open world... So we tried to make an open world game.

1372
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:57,414
We ended up making Opus Magnum, but we tried to make like an open world exploration game.

1373
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:57,735
Yeah.

1374
00:50:58,155 --> 00:50:59,778
And it just didn't... I didn't have it in me.

1375
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,823
It was kind of... I don't know. It started off like it was kind of...

1376
00:51:04,324 --> 00:51:06,705
It seemed like a cool idea, and then when it actually came to make it, it's just like,

1377
00:51:06,725 --> 00:51:11,788
oh god, there's nothing here, we have to reconstruct all these, like, crafting trees and, like, nonsense, and, like...

1378
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:17,111
Our games are fake, but to me, they're real, and, like, that's really important to me on a personal level,

1379
00:51:17,131 --> 00:51:20,853
but, like, I need to make something that I can believe in, and, like, crafting is not a thing I can believe in.

1380
00:51:21,034 --> 00:51:21,394
It's like the...

1381
00:51:22,094 --> 00:51:24,376
Our games are also fake, but they require real effort.

1382
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,657
Crafting is fake rewards with fake effort.

1383
00:51:27,038 --> 00:51:29,099
And that's where I draw the line, apparently.

1384
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,281
Everything is fake rewards, I guess,

1385
00:51:31,361 --> 00:51:34,023
but fake effort is not acceptable.

1386
00:51:34,123 --> 00:51:36,204
Yeah, your games do involve real effort.

1387
00:51:36,224 --> 00:51:37,405
They reproduce doing it,

1388
00:51:37,465 --> 00:51:39,667
like it's doing a job that is hopefully more interesting

1389
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:42,109
and more involved in a narrative than one's job,

1390
00:51:42,509 --> 00:51:43,590
I mean, not hopefully, hopefully.

1391
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:45,211
Hopefully everyone in this room has a great job.

1392
00:51:45,551 --> 00:51:47,132
But in general, people who are coming to games

1393
00:51:47,373 --> 00:51:48,553
are expecting a little bit more

1394
00:51:48,573 --> 00:51:50,054
of a narrativized, bounded,

1395
00:51:50,555 --> 00:51:55,979
Rewards, you know, yeah, well structured. Yeah, well structured exactly life is not well structured. Yeah, and it is a reward structure

1396
00:51:55,999 --> 00:51:57,740
I mean like I like in my personal life

1397
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:02,384
I will rail against games with that are like trying to just hook people and be addictive with these but like our games are that

1398
00:52:02,464 --> 00:52:04,285
Like our games are addictive there

1399
00:52:04,325 --> 00:52:10,230
They present you with little bite-sized problems that are like clearly defined and you don't have to go to meetings and whatever

1400
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:14,093
They don't use any of the Skinner boxy extension stuff with like random roles. It's like there are no loot boxes

1401
00:52:14,113 --> 00:52:16,635
And it's a nice game, but we're still like hooking people. It's still bullshit

1402
00:52:17,115 --> 00:52:18,655
I still feel bad about it, right?

1403
00:52:18,695 --> 00:52:20,735
But like, you gotta do what you gotta do.

1404
00:52:20,796 --> 00:52:22,116
Is fun inherently sinister?

1405
00:52:22,176 --> 00:52:23,316
Is that like the question you're-

1406
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:24,696
I don't know.

1407
00:52:24,736 --> 00:52:25,697
We don't have time for that.

1408
00:52:25,717 --> 00:52:26,457
Okay, we don't, we don't.

1409
00:52:26,717 --> 00:52:29,597
All right, I'll leave it at is fun inherently sinister.

1410
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:31,138
Do people have questions?

1411
00:52:31,478 --> 00:52:32,358
I'm imagining people do.

1412
00:52:32,378 --> 00:52:33,098
So you wanna talk about rules?

1413
00:52:33,118 --> 00:52:35,218
So the rules for questions is you have to be,

1414
00:52:35,439 --> 00:52:37,339
like your question has to be one sentence.

1415
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:39,739
Are you ever gonna make a game

1416
00:52:39,759 --> 00:52:40,880
that doesn't have solitaire in it?

1417
00:52:42,108 --> 00:52:42,929
Oh, probably not.

1418
00:52:43,049 --> 00:52:44,370
Okay, so the solitaire thing is weird.

1419
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:47,232
I really get a kick out of making solitaire games,

1420
00:52:47,272 --> 00:52:47,752
apparently.

1421
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:51,194
We have a bunch of games planned as potential games,

1422
00:52:51,555 --> 00:52:53,476
and I have solitaire games designed for all of them.

1423
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:57,911
It's kind of, okay, so I've discovered that mini,

1424
00:52:57,971 --> 00:52:59,911
especially when somebody else is funding

1425
00:52:59,931 --> 00:53:00,932
the development of your games,

1426
00:53:00,972 --> 00:53:02,372
that mini games are a really great way

1427
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:04,353
to do little experiments that,

1428
00:53:05,274 --> 00:53:07,154
into how to do other kinds of games.

1429
00:53:07,234 --> 00:53:09,475
I've actually learned a lot about making solitaire games,

1430
00:53:09,535 --> 00:53:11,016
and I've learned a lot about puzzles

1431
00:53:11,076 --> 00:53:14,438
in a sort of indirect way by making these solitaire games.

1432
00:53:14,878 --> 00:53:16,178
And you could just slip a mini game,

1433
00:53:16,198 --> 00:53:17,019
it's like a game jam.

1434
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:17,779
I don't do game jams,

1435
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,380
I can't really motivate myself to do game jams,

1436
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,721
but I can totally ship a solitaire game

1437
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:22,461
in one of our games,

1438
00:53:22,521 --> 00:53:23,821
and it's like a little game jam for me.

1439
00:53:25,616 --> 00:53:27,679
If puzzle games are about finding a solution,

1440
00:53:27,699 --> 00:53:31,023
the solution to a problem, and design

1441
00:53:31,063 --> 00:53:35,508
is about creating something that can solve a problem

1442
00:53:35,528 --> 00:53:37,010
and then iterating on it to make it better,

1443
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:39,794
are your games design games rather than?

1444
00:53:40,294 --> 00:53:40,674
puzzle games.

1445
00:53:40,754 --> 00:53:41,255
Absolutely.

1446
00:53:41,575 --> 00:53:45,296
The only reason I consider, like I would even use the word puzzle in describing it is that

1447
00:53:45,317 --> 00:53:49,418
there's like a, there's like a specific thing you're trying to do, which with a design is

1448
00:53:49,499 --> 00:53:51,399
often not even that true, right?

1449
00:53:51,419 --> 00:53:52,940
Like design is often more abstract.

1450
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,782
When you're designing a game, you certainly don't know what you're designing often.

1451
00:53:56,182 --> 00:54:00,104
And so like they're, they're laser focused in the way that like a puzzle is a like laser

1452
00:54:00,144 --> 00:54:01,064
focused scenario.

1453
00:54:01,084 --> 00:54:01,124
So.

1454
00:54:03,392 --> 00:54:07,635
For Opus Magnum, did you have all the verbs and mechanics before you started writing all the puzzles,

1455
00:54:07,695 --> 00:54:10,477
or did some come out of the process of creating those puzzles?

1456
00:54:11,017 --> 00:54:13,799
Both. Like the basic—here, I'll—I have a sketch in here really quickly.

1457
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:14,379
Um, the—

1458
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,641
Oh god, there's too much stuff in here.

1459
00:54:18,199 --> 00:54:18,900
It's a beefy book.

1460
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:19,260
Yeah.

1461
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:19,701
Yeah.

1462
00:54:19,901 --> 00:54:21,063
This is sounding like an ad.

1463
00:54:21,343 --> 00:54:22,505
So OK, so I did this skit.

1464
00:54:22,565 --> 00:54:23,386
We're not here to show the book.

1465
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,569
It's just a wealth of stuff for this talk.

1466
00:54:25,649 --> 00:54:28,813
So when I went to a Starbucks by myself one day when we were

1467
00:54:28,853 --> 00:54:30,696
starting work on Opus Magnum, I'm just like, what is this

1468
00:54:30,736 --> 00:54:31,357
game about?

1469
00:54:31,397 --> 00:54:33,660
And I just started drawing little things like this to try

1470
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,461
to figure out what are.

1471
00:54:35,202 --> 00:54:36,163
It doesn't even look like the game.

1472
00:54:36,203 --> 00:54:36,944
I don't even know what it is.

1473
00:54:37,004 --> 00:54:40,008
But it was just the beginning of a process of brainstorming

1474
00:54:40,468 --> 00:54:42,530
what the verbs are and what happens.

1475
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:45,934
And so there was an initial attempt.

1476
00:54:46,155 --> 00:54:49,138
I sort of initially proposed stuff internally.

1477
00:54:49,258 --> 00:54:51,080
And then we kind of start trying to build that.

1478
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:54,064
And at some point, there's going to be a narrative.

1479
00:54:54,704 --> 00:54:57,909
thing, but you can kind of do the narrative thing independently, like, cause it's, there

1480
00:54:57,929 --> 00:55:01,814
was, like, there's an important step that we didn't talk about, which is there's a moment

1481
00:55:02,254 --> 00:55:05,539
in the project where I will talk to Matthew, and I will say, I need you to go come up with

1482
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:06,961
a bunch of content ideas.

1483
00:55:07,441 --> 00:55:09,584
Here is what we can and can't do in a puzzle.

1484
00:55:10,045 --> 00:55:14,386
And so this is super hard in Exapunks because it's like, okay, all of the tropes you imagine

1485
00:55:14,406 --> 00:55:15,727
about hacking, we can't really do.

1486
00:55:15,927 --> 00:55:20,409
We can't do a puzzle where it's merely like you need to go find information and hack into

1487
00:55:20,449 --> 00:55:21,069
a system.

1488
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:22,690
The game doesn't really facilitate that.

1489
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,490
We need to show everything from the get-go.

1490
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:26,651
And so we can't do that that often.

1491
00:55:26,671 --> 00:55:30,913
The verbs are that you can manipulate devices that are connected to the network or move

1492
00:55:31,033 --> 00:55:32,534
files around as records.

1493
00:55:32,574 --> 00:55:33,374
And we have to sort of like...

1494
00:55:33,754 --> 00:55:37,057
come up with that interface, and it's like we go for a walk and we talk about it,

1495
00:55:37,397 --> 00:55:40,479
and that's like a really important point because after that we can just branch off and do our thing.

1496
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:47,484
And so with Opus Magnum, the contract was that a puzzle is where you make a product.

1497
00:55:47,905 --> 00:55:52,428
You don't make a process in a puzzle. Like, you will make a process as part of it,

1498
00:55:52,468 --> 00:55:55,450
but like the narrative contract is that like it has to be like,

1499
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:59,853
I need like a vial of this chemical or whatever, and that's like the interface point.

1500
00:56:00,214 --> 00:56:03,076
And so like we have to figure out stuff to get to that point.

1501
00:56:05,149 --> 00:56:08,482
Uh, so I don't believe you actually ever explained how you come up with the initial concept.

1502
00:56:09,342 --> 00:56:12,645
Oh, OK, so it's, I have a lot of ideas,

1503
00:56:12,885 --> 00:56:15,007
and then I sort of have a list of those ideas,

1504
00:56:15,087 --> 00:56:16,508
and other people come up with ideas,

1505
00:56:16,608 --> 00:56:18,509
and then we sort of keep them together and try to,

1506
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:21,572
like, I don't know, it's kind of like skimming

1507
00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:23,934
some kind of nasty soup, and you just see what floats

1508
00:56:23,974 --> 00:56:25,555
to the top and starts to congeal,

1509
00:56:25,675 --> 00:56:28,337
and at some point we'll have something that congeals,

1510
00:56:28,417 --> 00:56:30,799
and it's like, OK, I believe in this enough,

1511
00:56:30,819 --> 00:56:33,201
I can imagine making puzzles for this,

1512
00:56:33,361 --> 00:56:34,502
and then we kind of go ahead on it.

1513
00:56:35,362 --> 00:56:36,023
It's hard.

1514
00:56:36,043 --> 00:56:37,444
I mean, like, everybody has ideas, right?

1515
00:56:37,524 --> 00:56:39,865
Ideas are the things that are worthless and dime a dozen.

1516
00:56:39,905 --> 00:56:42,266
And you just collect all your ideas and just say, OK,

1517
00:56:42,286 --> 00:56:43,187
we have to do something.

1518
00:56:43,247 --> 00:56:44,047
So what's the best one?

1519
00:56:44,428 --> 00:56:46,569
Oh, when Typhoon turned out to be a disaster

1520
00:56:46,629 --> 00:56:48,370
and we needed a project, we're like, oh, god,

1521
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:50,531
we need to make a game right now, and it needs to be good.

1522
00:56:50,551 --> 00:56:51,552
What do we have?

1523
00:56:51,592 --> 00:56:52,552
It's like, well, we've got this idea from 2013

1524
00:56:52,612 --> 00:56:55,354
where we're going to make a space chem sequel about alchemy.

1525
00:56:55,594 --> 00:56:56,654
And it's like, yeah, we could do that.

1526
00:56:56,835 --> 00:56:59,316
And it was at the top of the list.

1527
00:56:59,376 --> 00:57:00,377
It had floated to the top.

1528
00:57:01,297 --> 00:57:02,438
And so we scooped it off and made it.

1529
00:57:03,807 --> 00:57:07,968
I was wondering if you could maybe name a game that you like made by someone else that

1530
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:11,369
wasn't commercially successful and what you thought maybe didn't work for it.

1531
00:57:11,909 --> 00:57:12,809
Oh, that's tough.

1532
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:13,710
Sorry.

1533
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:14,490
It's always the game.

1534
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:17,531
And so all the games that have failed have failed because no one wanted to play the game.

1535
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:21,172
I think that's kind of the thing.

1536
00:57:21,232 --> 00:57:22,392
It's probably not PR.

1537
00:57:22,412 --> 00:57:25,453
Do you have any games that you really like that people don't like to play?

1538
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:26,392
I don't like games.

1539
00:57:26,692 --> 00:57:28,714
Yeah, he did say he doesn't play games.

1540
00:57:28,734 --> 00:57:29,215
Sorry.

1541
00:57:29,255 --> 00:57:29,875
Make them instead.

1542
00:57:31,196 --> 00:57:35,420
When analyzing difficulty curves in your games, which other metrics beyond completion rates

1543
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,561
do you find useful?

1544
00:57:36,781 --> 00:57:38,323
The big one is something we call bounce.

1545
00:57:38,343 --> 00:57:39,404
I wish I had a chart of it.

1546
00:57:39,784 --> 00:57:43,948
We call it bounce, which is how many people will open the puzzle and then never solve

1547
00:57:44,008 --> 00:57:44,048
it.

1548
00:57:44,788 --> 00:57:48,470
And so that means they either skipped it, which is often not a thing that you can do in our games,

1549
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:53,112
or they fired up the puzzle, they're like, fuck this, and then they like uninstalled the game, and that was the end.

1550
00:57:53,192 --> 00:57:56,093
And that's, it turns out we actually, in Infinifactory, we did a survey

1551
00:57:56,493 --> 00:58:00,034
where we asked people at the end of, during early access at the end of puzzles,

1552
00:58:00,274 --> 00:58:02,235
who beat puzzles, like how hard was this puzzle.

1553
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:04,874
Do you think it was too easy, too hard, or just right?

1554
00:58:05,454 --> 00:58:10,078
And we took that data and we looked at that alongside the more objective measure of who

1555
00:58:10,138 --> 00:58:11,799
uninstalled the game after getting to a puzzle.

1556
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:18,304
And they kind of tracked enough that we feel kind of comfortable saying that when a puzzle

1557
00:58:18,384 --> 00:58:20,145
— when somebody doesn't beat a puzzle, it was too hard.

1558
00:58:20,305 --> 00:58:24,808
Which seems obvious, but the survey was only people who beat it, and so it was even people

1559
00:58:25,128 --> 00:58:27,050
who beat the puzzle were like, no, this was too hard.

1560
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:29,732
Which is a good indicator that your puzzle is too hard.

1561
00:58:30,412 --> 00:58:33,375
Like if somebody doesn't beat it and says it's too hard, of course it was too hard, right?

1562
00:58:33,395 --> 00:58:36,999
But if somebody beats it and says it was too hard, that's like, well, we're on the wrong track.

1563
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:40,141
If a group of people complaining that, no, the puzzles take two hours, said it was too hard,

1564
00:58:40,182 --> 00:58:40,862
then it's probably too hard.

1565
00:58:40,942 --> 00:58:41,363
Exactly.

1566
00:58:41,383 --> 00:58:41,723
Yeah.

1567
00:58:43,064 --> 00:58:47,709
What was the most craziest solution you've seen, maybe, that surprised you to any of the puzzles?

1568
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:52,203
none of them really. So the funny thing is that when you see a bunch of what everybody's

1569
00:58:52,243 --> 00:58:56,247
doing none of them are that surprising. People ask Opus Magnum, I don't think I've ever been

1570
00:58:56,267 --> 00:59:00,471
surprised by anything. Okay, I take that back. Somebody hacked our save files so they could

1571
00:59:00,611 --> 00:59:05,315
overlap a bunch of glyphs and they make these incredible solutions where they're just pulling

1572
00:59:05,355 --> 00:59:07,117
stuff out and it's instantly being bonded.

1573
00:59:08,779 --> 00:59:12,421
it's just like a magician, like this molecule just appears out of nowhere and you're like

1574
00:59:12,441 --> 00:59:13,241
how did that happen?

1575
00:59:13,321 --> 00:59:16,843
And it was, that was cool and that surprised me and then I had to go in and like delete

1576
00:59:16,883 --> 00:59:20,546
all of his leaderboard entries because he had leaderboards turned on and his friends

1577
00:59:20,586 --> 00:59:21,346
were complaining.

1578
00:59:21,826 --> 00:59:23,067
So, yeah.

1579
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:29,351
I was wondering if you had any other puzzle design takeaways from your escape room experience?

1580
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:33,801
I don't want to badmouth escape rooms.

1581
00:59:34,621 --> 00:59:37,142
I don't want to answer that question.

1582
00:59:37,322 --> 00:59:38,483
Do you like escape rooms?

1583
00:59:39,883 --> 00:59:41,184
Oh, okay.

1584
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:45,065
I don't dislike...

1585
00:59:45,085 --> 00:59:46,726
I've only done one, so I don't know.

1586
00:59:46,806 --> 00:59:48,406
And it was fun, because I like puzzles.

1587
00:59:48,446 --> 00:59:50,307
I like feeling smart like anybody else, you know?

1588
00:59:50,367 --> 00:59:51,407
And so puzzles are good at that.

1589
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:56,723
There was a mechanical contraption at the end,

1590
00:59:56,803 --> 00:59:58,124
an electromechanical contraption.

1591
00:59:58,144 --> 01:00:00,344
And as somebody who built electromechanical contraptions

1592
01:00:00,384 --> 01:00:02,664
in college, it was amateur and disappointing

1593
01:00:02,704 --> 01:00:04,505
because it didn't have any fucking feedback.

1594
01:00:04,765 --> 01:00:06,765
And you can't build your own custom interface

1595
01:00:06,785 --> 01:00:07,845
that has no feedback.

1596
01:00:08,565 --> 01:00:09,886
And the rest of the puzzles were great.

1597
01:00:09,926 --> 01:00:11,546
They were on paper, we could solve them.

1598
01:00:11,766 --> 01:00:13,906
And then there's this mystery box with buttons

1599
01:00:13,966 --> 01:00:16,507
and it's just like, don't do that.

1600
01:00:17,307 --> 01:00:18,547
I don't know, that's not professional.

1601
01:00:18,567 --> 01:00:20,647
That's just somebody who had a bad time at the end.

1602
01:00:24,227 --> 01:00:27,929
In one sentence, when will you make a truly mobile game at last?

1603
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:28,570
Never.

1604
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:29,330
Why?

1605
01:00:29,431 --> 01:00:31,252
We've actually pulled all of our mobile games.

1606
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:32,093
They didn't sell well.

1607
01:00:32,113 --> 01:00:32,973
They're a bitch to support.

1608
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:36,716
The people who run the platforms want to, like, get rid of old games and just, like,

1609
01:00:36,776 --> 01:00:38,077
send them to the depths of hell.

1610
01:00:38,497 --> 01:00:39,918
Like, no.

1611
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,119
Buy a PC.

1612
01:00:43,601 --> 01:00:47,084
How do you clearly convey the abstraction of your game right at the outset?

1613
01:00:47,484 --> 01:00:47,984
Can you say that again?

1614
01:00:48,164 --> 01:00:51,787
How do you clearly convey the abstraction, the system that the game is using, to a new

1615
01:00:51,847 --> 01:00:52,708
player from the beginning?

1616
01:00:54,198 --> 01:00:54,859
I don't know.

1617
01:00:54,879 --> 01:00:57,141
What do you mean?

1618
01:00:57,381 --> 01:00:58,542
Can you rephrase your question?

1619
01:00:58,582 --> 01:00:58,863
Sure.

1620
01:00:58,923 --> 01:01:02,286
So you're introducing them to a system.

1621
01:01:02,446 --> 01:01:02,646
Yeah.

1622
01:01:03,207 --> 01:01:05,009
Verbs, nouns, predicates.

1623
01:01:05,689 --> 01:01:08,712
How do you let them know what that language is?

1624
01:01:08,732 --> 01:01:12,977
I mean, literally manuals for three out of five of them,

1625
01:01:13,057 --> 01:01:13,317
right?

1626
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:17,820
Those opening puzzles where you see a solution and then come up with your own right next to it though,

1627
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,421
I think we're a pretty great tool for that, right?

1628
01:01:19,441 --> 01:01:21,181
Because you see a machine that works and then you...

1629
01:01:21,281 --> 01:01:22,181
Well, not as well as you want.

1630
01:01:22,241 --> 01:01:24,662
It's actually really confusing to show somebody a machine that works and be like,

1631
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:25,122
here you go.

1632
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:26,382
They're just like, what the hell is this?

1633
01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:28,623
Like, it kind of doesn't solve it.

1634
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:32,543
Like, I'd say that's probably one of the bigger problems with our games not being broadly accessible,

1635
01:01:32,864 --> 01:01:35,244
is that like, it's complicated.

1636
01:01:35,264 --> 01:01:36,824
It's not everybody's...

1637
01:01:37,184 --> 01:01:38,325
I don't know how people understand.

1638
01:01:38,385 --> 01:01:40,905
Like, we just make the games, right?

1639
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:48,643
Hi, each time I listen to the Zachtronics podcast, I think maybe it'd be great if you made a game about revision control.

1640
01:01:50,272 --> 01:01:51,253
That would be impossible.

1641
01:01:52,393 --> 01:01:53,993
I'm OK with taking technical topics,

1642
01:01:54,033 --> 01:01:56,254
but version control is terrible to teach people.

1643
01:01:58,295 --> 01:01:58,815
So it's 10.01.

1644
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:01,196
Technically, this talk ends at 10,

1645
01:02:01,236 --> 01:02:03,777
but I've been told that we can run over a little bit.

1646
01:02:04,457 --> 01:02:06,418
So we'll take two more questions,

1647
01:02:06,538 --> 01:02:07,338
and then we're going to stop.

1648
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:09,439
But then we have swag, so if you want swag, don't leave.

1649
01:02:10,219 --> 01:02:11,799
So what kind of metrics have you found

1650
01:02:11,859 --> 01:02:14,760
to be most useful to decide how to balance

1651
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,601
or how to decide what are good?

1652
01:02:16,985 --> 01:02:18,667
So the bounce rate is the big one.

1653
01:02:18,807 --> 01:02:20,308
That like puzzles that are like...

1654
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:21,769
So the cool thing about bounce rate

1655
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:24,110
is that it's in like the progress of the game.

1656
01:02:24,371 --> 01:02:25,892
So if you see like bounce rate is like this

1657
01:02:25,952 --> 01:02:28,133
and then it spikes and then it goes back down,

1658
01:02:28,914 --> 01:02:30,635
it means that everybody who got to this part of the game,

1659
01:02:31,075 --> 01:02:32,436
like a lot of people got stuck here,

1660
01:02:32,717 --> 01:02:33,977
but then the people who got stuck here

1661
01:02:34,078 --> 01:02:35,218
were okay with the rest of it.

1662
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:36,759
And so it probably means there's something wrong

1663
01:02:36,779 --> 01:02:37,980
with this puzzle with the big spike.

1664
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:41,162
And so we actually just, it's like, it's not the same as like an interest curve necessarily

1665
01:02:41,182 --> 01:02:44,645
because you don't want people bailing on your game really, but like, we just try to like

1666
01:02:44,685 --> 01:02:45,505
squish those down.

1667
01:02:45,645 --> 01:02:48,988
And so often we'll just like replace a puzzle with a new puzzle that is not as hard.

1668
01:02:50,028 --> 01:02:50,228
Thanks.

1669
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:51,629
Last question.

1670
01:02:51,649 --> 01:02:54,011
Hi.

1671
01:02:54,431 --> 01:02:58,534
How do you, how do you design a puzzle with multiple solutions if you don't know what

1672
01:02:58,634 --> 01:02:59,655
all the solutions are?

1673
01:03:00,355 --> 01:03:01,556
That's how you do it.

1674
01:03:01,896 --> 01:03:05,719
If you don't know what any solution is, there's probably a lot of solutions in it.

1675
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:13,207
You do occasionally in early access tweak a puzzle once you see the solutions and it's either way too easy or way too hard or way too broken.

1676
01:03:13,227 --> 01:03:15,609
But that's not about the number of solutions, right?

1677
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:20,272
It's really a result of the systems we build.

1678
01:03:20,312 --> 01:03:23,094
They're fundamentally open-ended systems, right?

1679
01:03:23,114 --> 01:03:24,956
And that's why I think our games aren't really puzzles.

1680
01:03:25,356 --> 01:03:30,320
The nature of a true puzzle is that it has one solution and you can use logic and stuff to get to that solution.

1681
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,402
We just build systems of tools and then say, build something that does this.

1682
01:03:35,063 --> 01:03:37,403
Right? And so it's just fundamentally different.

1683
01:03:38,304 --> 01:03:39,764
And I think that's what enables it.

1684
01:03:40,204 --> 01:03:44,345
So if you were to try to build a game with tools and open-ended puzzle,

1685
01:03:44,425 --> 01:03:47,406
not an open-ended puzzle, but just like tools and tasks,

1686
01:03:47,466 --> 01:03:50,786
you would end up with a game where there are probably lots of different solutions to stuff,

1687
01:03:50,826 --> 01:03:52,507
as long as you don't add too many constraints.

1688
01:03:52,827 --> 01:03:54,647
I've worked with people who made other games that were like...

1689
01:03:55,007 --> 01:03:57,248
I worked with the PrimeMover guys, which is another Zach-like.

1690
01:03:57,808 --> 01:03:59,368
And one of the things they had early on

1691
01:03:59,388 --> 01:04:01,629
were a lot of squares that were closed off.

1692
01:04:01,769 --> 01:04:03,029
And so that was the suggestion I gave them,

1693
01:04:03,069 --> 01:04:04,049
is just get rid of that.

1694
01:04:04,069 --> 01:04:05,489
The game's already hard because you already

1695
01:04:05,529 --> 01:04:09,070
have to think about how to apply these tools to solve a task.

1696
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:11,070
Get rid of the extra constraints,

1697
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:12,030
and it'll be more open-ended.

1698
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:13,511
A lot of people in Shenzhen I.O. actually

1699
01:04:13,551 --> 01:04:15,031
didn't like the circuit boards, which

1700
01:04:15,091 --> 01:04:17,391
is why Opus Magnum is completely infinite in size.

1701
01:04:17,411 --> 01:04:19,892
It was like the circuit boards made it

1702
01:04:19,992 --> 01:04:22,292
so that if you had an idea for a solution,

1703
01:04:22,332 --> 01:04:23,712
you might not be able to build it.

1704
01:04:23,972 --> 01:04:26,233
And that kind of sucks in a game that's supposedly open-ended.

1705
01:04:26,813 --> 01:04:30,016
It's the same reason why Xapunks lets you build nearly as many Xs as you want.

1706
01:04:30,276 --> 01:04:32,458
And now it lets you write as many lines of code as you want.

1707
01:04:33,259 --> 01:04:33,860
Just period.

1708
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:36,842
As someone who's terrible at it, I ran into the line limitation many times.

1709
01:04:36,902 --> 01:04:38,584
And that was never even meant to be a difficulty thing.

1710
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:42,768
That was because you can write a 10,000 line program that's very fast.

1711
01:04:43,128 --> 01:04:43,328
Yeah.

1712
01:04:43,388 --> 01:04:43,569
Yeah.

1713
01:04:43,909 --> 01:04:44,409
So, yeah.

1714
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:45,771
Okay, so that's all for questions.

1715
01:04:46,992 --> 01:04:47,272
Thank you.

1716
01:04:47,292 --> 01:04:47,813
Thanks.

1717
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:48,033
Thanks.
