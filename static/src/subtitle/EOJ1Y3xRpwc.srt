1
00:00:05,226 --> 00:00:07,787
So that talk is about Forerunner.

2
00:00:08,027 --> 00:00:10,208
And as you know, Forerunner is about knight, viking,

3
00:00:10,248 --> 00:00:10,849
and samurais.

4
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:13,550
And in the team, we have that ritual,

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,232
thanks to an old guy that is, every time we

6
00:00:17,272 --> 00:00:19,633
meet new persons, we like to know who they are.

7
00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:23,135
So before starting, I'm going to ask you a quick question.

8
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:27,737
It's who among you think they are samurai like that guy?

9
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,298
Not that many.

10
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:33,700
Who thinks are knights?

11
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:36,356
Yeah, we're a few.

12
00:00:36,576 --> 00:00:38,237
It's because we're the good guy who always wins.

13
00:00:38,357 --> 00:00:38,717
It's OK.

14
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:41,658
So I think all the rest is Vikings, right?

15
00:00:41,698 --> 00:00:42,818
You are Vikings, all of them.

16
00:00:43,758 --> 00:00:44,839
Usually you're louder than that.

17
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:45,359
That's OK.

18
00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:51,601
OK, so who are we, except he's a samurai and I'm a knight?

19
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:54,081
So my name is Romain Campos-Oyola.

20
00:00:54,482 --> 00:00:56,702
I'm a currently creative director on For Honor.

21
00:00:57,362 --> 00:00:59,183
During production, I was game director.

22
00:00:59,363 --> 00:01:01,724
And it's been 12 years now that I'm at Ubisoft.

23
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:04,965
And I'm the one on top.

24
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:08,842
And I'm Damien Quiquen, I'm the game director on Forner,

25
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:12,903
and I worked previously on the multiplayer of Assassin's Creed

26
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:14,263
as the game director as well.

27
00:01:14,743 --> 00:01:17,544
I will let Romain do the first part of the presentation,

28
00:01:17,604 --> 00:01:18,564
then jump back.

29
00:01:19,244 --> 00:01:19,644
Thank you.

30
00:01:20,725 --> 00:01:22,385
So why this talk?

31
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:24,285
Why this talk today?

32
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:25,366
What are we to say?

33
00:01:26,506 --> 00:01:29,687
Well, before the start, before the launch of the game,

34
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:31,667
we were at that game.

35
00:01:32,094 --> 00:01:37,056
We had a really successful open beta, second biggest open beta in Ubisoft history.

36
00:01:38,397 --> 00:01:43,319
We were at the game being played at Clueless Gamer just before the Super Bowl.

37
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:45,059
So it was huge.

38
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:45,620
It was cool.

39
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,362
We had an amazing first day, had a big team party, went drunk.

40
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:55,043
And a month and a half later, wake up, big hangover.

41
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:57,865
And that's the story.

42
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:02,370
And we're like, what?

43
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:03,991
What happened?

44
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:04,732
Really?

45
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,814
So why is that?

46
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:08,795
What happened there?

47
00:02:09,615 --> 00:02:12,477
Even if we have so many years of experience and all that

48
00:02:12,897 --> 00:02:13,438
stuff around.

49
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,199
The thing is, we knew how to ship games.

50
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,321
Even multiplayer games, et cetera, as you see, worked on

51
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:20,582
the multiplayer of Assassin's Creed.

52
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:21,623
I worked on Ghost Recon.

53
00:02:21,943 --> 00:02:23,644
We knew what it meant to ship a multiplayer game.

54
00:02:24,184 --> 00:02:27,367
But we did not knew what it meant to be a platform and not

55
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:28,307
only ship a platform.

56
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,715
but also support it after launch.

57
00:02:31,576 --> 00:02:33,857
And looking back at that last year,

58
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:36,779
we can say that we learned it the real, real hard way.

59
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,041
So quickly, the first chapter, I'm

60
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:42,622
going to tell you just quickly what Forerunner is,

61
00:02:42,702 --> 00:02:43,443
in case you don't know.

62
00:02:44,543 --> 00:02:48,706
Then I'm going to go into what we did well before launch.

63
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:51,708
Because hopefully, we did a couple of things right

64
00:02:52,468 --> 00:02:55,290
that were really, really helpful just after launch,

65
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,430
when the shit hit the fan.

66
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:03,632
Then I'm going to handle the speech to Damien that's going to explain to you when she hit

67
00:03:03,652 --> 00:03:11,555
the fan what went wrong and in order to fix it, how we reshaped the team and the way we

68
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:12,435
built the game.

69
00:03:13,255 --> 00:03:20,218
And then he's going to finish on what it means for us to be a platform in terms of retention

70
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:21,678
and sustainability.

71
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:25,280
So first, what is Forerunner?

72
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,780
So Forerunner is a new IP.

73
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:30,200
It's made at Ubisoft Montreal, mainly.

74
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,203
And it's a PVP multiplayer game, and it's about sword,

75
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:38,125
and knight vikings, and samurai fighting.

76
00:03:46,832 --> 00:03:48,893
The world fears us.

77
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,376
We are the favorite of the gods.

78
00:03:52,956 --> 00:03:54,978
We plunder new lands.

79
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:56,499
We raid.

80
00:03:57,098 --> 00:03:58,258
And we grow strong.

81
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:04,161
We live for battle, ready to die in glory.

82
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:08,323
Cast away from our land, we are rebuilding.

83
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:13,406
Our hearts are strong, our devotion absolute,

84
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:16,227
and our skill is beyond question.

85
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:19,149
We will be remembered.

86
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,291
We are the guardians of our people.

87
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:24,592
We stand strong.

88
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:35,805
When we defend the weak, we are immortal.

89
00:05:26,863 --> 00:05:27,444
So that's the game.

90
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:30,906
That's the most important part for us.

91
00:05:31,753 --> 00:05:34,314
since the beginning is that Forerunner was meant

92
00:05:34,454 --> 00:05:35,495
to be a game as a service.

93
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:39,537
It was meant to be an offer that will continue to grow

94
00:05:39,717 --> 00:05:42,258
and that we will continue to support after launch.

95
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:43,859
What does it mean?

96
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:47,081
It means that, what does it change for us?

97
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:50,442
Previously, when we were working for a game during three,

98
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,604
five years, then we shipped that game, and it's done.

99
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:55,525
And we go to the next one.

100
00:05:55,545 --> 00:05:58,687
Yes, we continue, we deliver the DLC, maybe one or two patch.

101
00:05:58,707 --> 00:06:00,368
But mainly, the team.

102
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:04,158
and most of the people switch to the next project.

103
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,559
Now it's not the same thing for us.

104
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,840
It's like opening an amusement park.

105
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,622
The first day of the release, it's

106
00:06:11,842 --> 00:06:14,023
actually the day where everything starts.

107
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:17,725
And so now when you work on Forerunner,

108
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:20,487
you don't work on what's coming next.

109
00:06:20,987 --> 00:06:22,648
You're not working on the next project.

110
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:26,090
You are still working on the same project,

111
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,052
making it grow, adding content, new character.

112
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:34,068
fixing, improving the game, listening to the community,

113
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:37,289
and just making it grow and be bigger for the years to come.

114
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,231
And that has been a major shift for us

115
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:42,252
in terms of the way we build the game.

116
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:47,314
So before launch, where did we start?

117
00:06:47,594 --> 00:06:48,994
So that was our launch.

118
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:52,236
We had a massive open beta, more than one million players

119
00:06:52,276 --> 00:06:52,916
on the first day.

120
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:55,057
That's comparable to an Assassin's Creed

121
00:06:55,817 --> 00:06:56,958
that we released in February.

122
00:06:57,378 --> 00:06:58,138
And we are a fighting game.

123
00:07:00,188 --> 00:07:03,030
We are number four all-time NPD in terms of fighting game.

124
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:07,471
And so far, we've reached a little bit over 7.5 million

125
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:07,811
players.

126
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:12,053
So before launching, what did we learn?

127
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:16,475
First, we did a lot of life periods.

128
00:07:16,955 --> 00:07:19,956
We started one year and a half before launching the game.

129
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,938
And we learned a couple of stuff on that part.

130
00:07:24,078 --> 00:07:24,818
It helped us.

131
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:30,308
shape the team, and shape our process in order to be ready for the big day.

132
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:34,169
And remember, we are a new IP.

133
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:35,950
Nobody knew us.

134
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:42,071
And that was a really, really powerful tool to start to build a community.

135
00:07:44,512 --> 00:07:46,432
So let's start with live periods.

136
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:54,995
So we did our first live period just after our reveal at E3, one year and a half.

137
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,502
before launching the game.

138
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:01,126
And basically, when we do live period on the project,

139
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,829
we either do them for production purpose

140
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:07,232
in order to test elements, see how things behave,

141
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:09,774
or we do them for a marketing reason.

142
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:14,618
That first one was really for production purpose.

143
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:17,280
So it was just to test.

144
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,588
the core gameplay of the game.

145
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:23,850
Before that, we were doing some play tests and so on.

146
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,590
We had the non-sat E3.

147
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,952
We had like 2,000 or 3,000 people playing the game.

148
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:31,673
But we wanted to see with real players

149
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:33,934
how that core premise of the game,

150
00:08:33,954 --> 00:08:36,235
because we have a new experience, how does it behave.

151
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:42,537
So that's why only one target, PC, small audience, NDA,

152
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:43,858
so non-disclosure agreement.

153
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,559
You can't speak about anything there.

154
00:08:47,107 --> 00:08:48,928
short period of time, just three days,

155
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:51,788
because we don't want to test the tail,

156
00:08:51,808 --> 00:08:52,868
the long tail of the experience.

157
00:08:52,888 --> 00:08:54,909
We just want to test the accessibility,

158
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:55,609
the immediate fun.

159
00:08:57,729 --> 00:09:01,410
Then, second one, like eight months after,

160
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,851
again, production-oriented,

161
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:06,971
and it's to test and validate

162
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:09,152
the core progression loops of the game.

163
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,633
How the characters progress over time,

164
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:16,553
the foundation of the economic system in the game.

165
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:20,400
So again, small target, NDA, et cetera.

166
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:25,764
But then we take that same build with a few tweaks,

167
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:31,009
and we turn it into our first marketing live period.

168
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,190
It's our first closed alpha.

169
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,772
For us, it's our first load test.

170
00:09:36,613 --> 00:09:38,975
But it's a tool that is used by the marketing

171
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:42,078
in order to start to push the game to audience.

172
00:09:42,478 --> 00:09:45,460
And for the first time, we don't have any NDA.

173
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:50,342
You can stream whatever content you see in that build.

174
00:09:50,942 --> 00:09:53,344
And you're going to see after, that was really important.

175
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:57,628
And then we use that same build, and we

176
00:09:57,668 --> 00:10:00,710
go with new territories, Russia, Japan.

177
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,152
And again, purely marketing purpose,

178
00:10:03,432 --> 00:10:05,234
just to get known on those territories.

179
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:08,677
Then our first closed beta.

180
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:12,760
Here, we are giving the whole game.

181
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:15,322
That's for the first time at Ubisoft.

182
00:10:15,642 --> 00:10:16,383
All the characters.

183
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:20,420
All the game modes, everything is in that build.

184
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,102
And the goal of that build, it's balancing and polish.

185
00:10:25,322 --> 00:10:26,562
And of course, it's under NDA.

186
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:32,244
But then we are doing a closed beta and an open beta.

187
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:35,666
And here the goal is to be ready for launch.

188
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:39,287
It's to drive the momentum, drive the pre-order,

189
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:41,768
in order to have the biggest launch as we can.

190
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,690
So here the main message is not that we

191
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,750
did the law of life periods.

192
00:10:47,326 --> 00:10:50,167
The main thing is that each life period is different.

193
00:10:51,508 --> 00:10:53,589
And you need to think of them as different tools

194
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:56,830
with different objectives, and so different KPI to track.

195
00:10:59,612 --> 00:11:03,153
Second thing is, how did this life period help us?

196
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:05,254
What did it change for us?

197
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:09,456
For that, I'm going to take the example of fight balancing

198
00:11:09,717 --> 00:11:10,217
in Fortnum.

199
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:14,899
So early on.

200
00:11:15,963 --> 00:11:18,283
The process was based on team culture.

201
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:21,964
We were doing play tests to validate accessibility,

202
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:25,965
but the real balancing was mainly on two things.

203
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:29,625
First, every Friday, and that's still true today in the team,

204
00:11:30,345 --> 00:11:31,366
we have a play session.

205
00:11:31,646 --> 00:11:36,207
So everybody stop working, download the build,

206
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:36,967
play the game.

207
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,587
And then we grab beers and we discuss.

208
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,787
And that's true for the whole team.

209
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:43,308
Even still today, that is still true.

210
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:46,464
And the other thing that we were doing,

211
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:49,085
it's we have regular team tournaments.

212
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:50,786
Every time we have a big milestone,

213
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:55,269
we grab all the team, and during one day, everybody plays.

214
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,571
We have big breakfast in the morning,

215
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:00,772
then we bring food in the afternoon, et cetera.

216
00:12:00,912 --> 00:12:02,913
And we celebrate the game, and everybody played the game.

217
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:05,375
Here, the goal, it's not only team building.

218
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:10,057
Also, it was helping us to see how the game was played

219
00:12:10,518 --> 00:12:11,938
when people were playing it to win.

220
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,998
And remember, those guys are good former players.

221
00:12:15,098 --> 00:12:18,739
I mean, some were working on the game since one, two, three years.

222
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,880
So they knew it.

223
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,040
They knew how to play it.

224
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:25,922
Then we have our first private pre-alpha.

225
00:12:28,003 --> 00:12:31,404
And after just two days, some of our best guys

226
00:12:31,944 --> 00:12:35,525
got there, got pretty rough time against players,

227
00:12:36,186 --> 00:12:36,866
like really rough.

228
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:38,566
That picture was taken at my desk.

229
00:12:39,187 --> 00:12:40,647
And all the people that you can see.

230
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:44,239
are people that lost against that player.

231
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,881
And the guy playing that actually managed to beat him

232
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:50,443
was one of our lead testers and one of our best players.

233
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:52,765
So we're like, oh, that's cool.

234
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,626
People are getting really good at our game.

235
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,186
It's awesome.

236
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:57,788
Yeah, but we might have a small issue.

237
00:12:58,888 --> 00:13:01,850
Because we are clearly not the best player of that game.

238
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,731
So what do we do?

239
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:07,694
And also for us, the problem is even more difficult.

240
00:13:07,774 --> 00:13:09,655
Because remember, we're not only a 1v1 game.

241
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,582
We are also balancing for 4v4.

242
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:19,427
So one of the first things we started to do

243
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,889
is collect data.

244
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,811
Data everywhere, woo!

245
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:26,333
But how and why?

246
00:13:27,494 --> 00:13:30,237
First, we are collecting data for 1v1.

247
00:13:30,457 --> 00:13:32,919
So we are creating the fight matrix

248
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,321
and comparing all the matchups in order

249
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:37,643
to have an idea of the power of each character

250
00:13:37,843 --> 00:13:38,564
in a dual scenario.

251
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:41,856
Also, we were doing the same thing in 4v4.

252
00:13:42,216 --> 00:13:43,557
So we were collecting the win rates.

253
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:47,120
But also, for the pick rate, and we

254
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,282
were tracking the pick rates over time.

255
00:13:50,142 --> 00:13:52,084
And here, it's interesting because when

256
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:54,125
you see a character having a huge bump,

257
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,048
so yes, when it's released, there is a huge bump.

258
00:13:58,348 --> 00:14:01,650
But then, when the character has a bump, there's two reasons.

259
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:04,632
Either we release a cool outfit, and everybody

260
00:14:04,672 --> 00:14:06,534
thinks its character looks really cool.

261
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:07,755
And usually, it's not that.

262
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,552
It's because people think the character is the flavor of the month and is maybe too strong.

263
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:17,353
And so we need to take a look, a more deeper look at how that character is played.

264
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:25,715
And for that, we are tracking in detail amongst all the players, and then we can add filter

265
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:34,438
on skill, et cetera, what type of moves, what move is being used, and how much each move

266
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:38,079
is contributing to the overall damage dealt by that character.

267
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,750
And here for us, what is interesting,

268
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,051
what we're looking for, it's that type of moves.

269
00:14:43,831 --> 00:14:47,872
Moves that are not used a lot, but deals a ton of damage.

270
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:49,153
And why is that interesting?

271
00:14:49,193 --> 00:14:50,593
It's because that move is really safe.

272
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,214
It's really hard to block for the opponent,

273
00:14:53,254 --> 00:14:54,254
so it's always landing.

274
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:55,455
So that's why it's dealing damage.

275
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:59,016
So either it's by design, or you might have a problem.

276
00:15:01,477 --> 00:15:05,278
But also, doing live period helped us understand

277
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,159
the type of tools that we would need in order

278
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:08,879
to operate the game.

279
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:11,944
And basically, we developed two things,

280
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:15,006
what we call Live Updates and Cloud Server Updates.

281
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:20,091
So Live Updates, it's normal patch, if I can say.

282
00:15:20,771 --> 00:15:22,593
The detail is that it's only data.

283
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:25,095
There's no code involved.

284
00:15:25,795 --> 00:15:28,017
That means that there is no first-party submission

285
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:28,478
console.

286
00:15:29,418 --> 00:15:32,181
So we can push that patch really fast.

287
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,763
The second one is the Cloud Server Update.

288
00:15:35,203 --> 00:15:38,126
And here, we only update data on our side.

289
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:39,167
And the same thing.

290
00:15:39,587 --> 00:15:41,529
Of course, no first party submission.

291
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:43,650
And it's even faster to deploy.

292
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:47,713
And those are the two main tools that we are now using in

293
00:15:47,753 --> 00:15:48,774
order to balance the game.

294
00:15:50,696 --> 00:15:53,418
Live updates for game mode and fighters.

295
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:57,781
Cloud server updates for economy and progression.

296
00:15:58,902 --> 00:16:03,065
And so we went from first live period, that character is way

297
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:05,767
too strong, we can patch him next time we're

298
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:06,768
live in eight months.

299
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:11,003
To today, when we have issues with a character,

300
00:16:12,164 --> 00:16:13,745
next week, the thing is fixed.

301
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:17,127
Here again, the important thing is

302
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:20,810
we were able to do that because we started early.

303
00:16:23,312 --> 00:16:25,073
At first, we didn't add an architecture

304
00:16:25,113 --> 00:16:27,414
where everything was data-driven for the character.

305
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:30,497
But that's where we figured it.

306
00:16:30,937 --> 00:16:33,899
And that's where we figured that we needed that agility in order

307
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,920
to be able to support the game after a while.

308
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:40,063
Last thing, community.

309
00:16:40,523 --> 00:16:43,766
So again, new IP, nobody knew us.

310
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:48,170
So what was our strategy?

311
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,553
Our strategy was to be end on, to convince with the game,

312
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:56,076
and to convince a core, and then have that core grow,

313
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,999
and infect other people, and eventually lead to consumer.

314
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,461
So that's the All-Splash strategy.

315
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,943
And we started that at the announcement.

316
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:06,385
E3 2015.

317
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:11,960
ends on stage, four players versus four players,

318
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,962
live on stage, then on the booth, you could play the game.

319
00:17:18,043 --> 00:17:20,944
And just after that, for people that were not

320
00:17:21,004 --> 00:17:25,426
able to go at E3, but were invested in the game,

321
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:30,148
they were able to play from home with our first closed pre-alpha.

322
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:33,170
And what was good for the community here

323
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,212
is that they had the experience, and done.

324
00:17:37,783 --> 00:17:41,185
and they were able to be part of something bigger early on.

325
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,207
And they were able to discuss with us

326
00:17:43,787 --> 00:17:47,610
and feel that their feedback was actually building the game.

327
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,151
And for us, that was really useful

328
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:54,656
because we were having those discussions with those guys.

329
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:57,117
Then, 2016, the goal was to build on that core

330
00:17:57,498 --> 00:17:59,619
and not only bring the press on board,

331
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,982
but also bring all the friends of those guys.

332
00:18:04,523 --> 00:18:07,405
So first, since we were doing constant live periods.

333
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:09,408
We always add new content.

334
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:12,830
So when you would go into a show to see Forerunner,

335
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,071
there was always something new, a new character,

336
00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:17,433
a new game mode, a new map, always something new to see.

337
00:18:18,593 --> 00:18:20,755
And also, we were doing the live periods.

338
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:25,457
So just as an example, our first closed alpha,

339
00:18:25,817 --> 00:18:29,900
it was more than 300 times bigger than Gamescom.

340
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,802
At Gamescom, you have 10,000 players playing the game

341
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:34,482
for 20 minutes.

342
00:18:34,723 --> 00:18:36,464
So that's an average of 200k minutes.

343
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:43,390
Whereas that first Close Alpha, it was 237k players.

344
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:46,452
But more importantly, remember, we

345
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,534
said there was no NDA on that Close Alpha.

346
00:18:49,534 --> 00:18:53,017
So with that Close Alpha, we generated more than 65 million

347
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:54,919
views on Twitch and YouTube.

348
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:59,042
That's a much bigger reach than any Gamescom or trade show

349
00:18:59,062 --> 00:18:59,582
that you can do.

350
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:06,628
And also to reach the friends of the community of those early

351
00:19:06,668 --> 00:19:07,448
deliver in the game.

352
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,760
We were doing a referral program.

353
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,722
So basically, when you were invited into a live period

354
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:16,203
of For Honor, even if it wasn't the NDA,

355
00:19:16,744 --> 00:19:18,745
you could bring five of your friends with you.

356
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:23,627
And eventually, more than 50% of the people

357
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:26,889
that played in a live period, even during the open beta,

358
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:29,991
were people that got invited by their friends.

359
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:33,813
The last part.

360
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:38,872
2017 reached the consumers through the open beta, of course,

361
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:44,654
and continuing to build on the momentum of Twitch and YouTube and the streamers and so on.

362
00:19:46,674 --> 00:19:51,735
So, what did we learn? How did we get there?

363
00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:53,895
The main thing is we started early.

364
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:59,377
And because that's early starts and starting to operate the game before launch,

365
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:02,717
because we're not a AAA, we can't do early access and this kind of thing.

366
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:05,650
We were able not only to adapt our tools,

367
00:20:06,531 --> 00:20:09,173
but also to build a community of players

368
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:11,895
that would prove to be very valuable after that.

369
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:16,038
And then, as I mentioned, we launched the game.

370
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,720
And everything went, eh, I was going to tell you about that.

371
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,142
Thank you, Romain.

372
00:20:23,443 --> 00:20:26,565
You always give me the easy tasks, the easy things to do.

373
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,868
So what went wrong on Forerunner?

374
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:32,129
So as Romain said.

375
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:35,703
We built an amusement park thanks to all those life

376
00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:37,564
periods and were really happy.

377
00:20:38,985 --> 00:20:40,786
We had pretty good reviews at the launch,

378
00:20:40,886 --> 00:20:42,467
so team was really happy.

379
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,048
Everything was going well.

380
00:20:44,628 --> 00:20:47,050
Then after a few days, a few weeks,

381
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,392
we saw that we had some issues in our amusement park.

382
00:20:51,353 --> 00:20:52,153
What were those?

383
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:56,656
So we had connectivity issues in our 4v4 game modes.

384
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,798
So Dominion, for example, that is the most popular game

385
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:01,038
mode on the game.

386
00:21:01,914 --> 00:21:04,415
We had balancing issues, even with all the things

387
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:06,236
we learned before launch.

388
00:21:07,356 --> 00:21:10,597
And we had also some economics and progression values

389
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:13,778
that we had to adapt that weren't working as intended.

390
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:17,640
And it's something that clearly impacted

391
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,380
the whole momentum of the game.

392
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,521
So we saw the sales dropping after a few weeks,

393
00:21:22,701 --> 00:21:24,222
even if we had an amazing launch.

394
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,443
Usually, press was pretty negative at that time.

395
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:33,316
and was using anything to do bad press.

396
00:21:33,717 --> 00:21:36,098
And the community was really frustrated

397
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:40,900
at the point of threatening to do a blackout event

398
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,621
where nobody would play the game during that day

399
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:46,702
to tell us how frustrated they were about the game.

400
00:21:46,762 --> 00:21:51,104
So basically, this super nice ice flat

401
00:21:51,164 --> 00:21:53,425
we've built during two years and a half,

402
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:57,627
well, oil burns and everything went bad.

403
00:21:58,157 --> 00:21:59,197
in just a few days.

404
00:22:00,338 --> 00:22:01,818
So how did that happen?

405
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:05,560
And what did we learn from it?

406
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:13,884
So first, and this one is a very obvious sentence, I can tell, but you will see how it makes

407
00:22:13,944 --> 00:22:15,025
sense in our case.

408
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,405
So you don't know what you don't know.

409
00:22:16,726 --> 00:22:20,687
So there is an unpredictability factor on what is going on.

410
00:22:21,388 --> 00:22:26,010
You need to be ready to adapt your whole production process as soon as you're live because everything

411
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:26,490
changes.

412
00:22:27,418 --> 00:22:30,399
And the communication needs are not the same anymore

413
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,040
when you're live.

414
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,741
So everything we've built before launch

415
00:22:33,841 --> 00:22:35,522
wasn't really working after launch.

416
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:38,023
So you don't know what you don't know.

417
00:22:39,323 --> 00:22:42,925
Before launch, your players and the feedback

418
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,186
you receive on your game are mostly

419
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:47,787
focused on novelty, on discovery of your game,

420
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:49,448
on the cool factor of your game.

421
00:22:49,928 --> 00:22:54,270
And they're not really focused on what is wrong,

422
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,851
or at least they don't give it to you with the right intensity.

423
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,145
While after launch, the context is really changing.

424
00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:03,668
And small problems might become bigger.

425
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:05,169
And in fact, they will.

426
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,911
And I will tell you a very good example for us.

427
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,513
The connectivity, of course.

428
00:23:11,574 --> 00:23:15,778
So do you really think we spent five or six years on a game,

429
00:23:16,398 --> 00:23:19,260
built a new core gameplay, an amazing 4v4 fighting game

430
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,042
to have connectivity issues at launch?

431
00:23:21,302 --> 00:23:21,942
Of course not.

432
00:23:22,122 --> 00:23:24,364
That's why we started super early on our life period,

433
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,246
because we wanted to be ready at launch.

434
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:32,424
And our approach was, when we started building the game

435
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:35,046
many years ago, was to say, we'll

436
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:37,047
go through a peer-to-peer network model,

437
00:23:38,028 --> 00:23:41,210
but a different type of peer-to-peer network model,

438
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,492
what we call the mesh peer-to-peer network model.

439
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:47,315
So it means that each player is speaking to each player,

440
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:49,616
sending information to each player.

441
00:23:50,117 --> 00:23:52,098
And you don't have a host, so you

442
00:23:52,138 --> 00:23:53,199
don't have an intermediary.

443
00:23:53,873 --> 00:23:57,975
So this helped us to have the lowest latency possible,

444
00:23:58,015 --> 00:23:59,876
which is what you want to have in a fighting game.

445
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:03,158
And on top of that, For Honor was

446
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:05,940
built around having a deterministic simulation.

447
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,962
So I won't go too technical, but the idea

448
00:24:09,002 --> 00:24:12,424
here is that there is no randomness in a game session.

449
00:24:12,624 --> 00:24:16,146
Whatever you do as a player will always have the same outcome.

450
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:21,110
So it meant that we only had to send the inputs of the player.

451
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:24,812
We didn't have to send their location, their animation,

452
00:24:24,912 --> 00:24:26,533
or things like that that you usually

453
00:24:26,593 --> 00:24:29,995
do with other type of systems.

454
00:24:30,515 --> 00:24:32,036
Here we just had to send the input,

455
00:24:32,076 --> 00:24:34,097
so it meant a lower bandwidth usage.

456
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:38,679
So we're like, yes, we found the secret formula,

457
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:41,901
and that's how we will do a reactive mini-gameplay.

458
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:44,882
And we're like, OK, we have one year and a half.

459
00:24:45,423 --> 00:24:47,803
to test it, to see if it works, to polish it,

460
00:24:48,163 --> 00:24:49,324
and to make it right.

461
00:24:50,264 --> 00:24:52,064
So we started one year and a half before.

462
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,224
We didn't fight some issues on connectivity,

463
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:56,085
things like that, but things that we

464
00:24:56,105 --> 00:24:57,425
were fixing along the way.

465
00:24:57,925 --> 00:25:01,566
So we were clearly seeing that the connectivity was getting

466
00:25:01,606 --> 00:25:03,746
better between each life period.

467
00:25:04,126 --> 00:25:06,607
And we're like, OK, it's like when the game crashes

468
00:25:06,647 --> 00:25:08,247
and things like that, things we can handle,

469
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:09,027
things we can fix.

470
00:25:10,387 --> 00:25:11,007
We fix it.

471
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:12,568
When we launch, in fact,

472
00:25:13,327 --> 00:25:15,247
Just before we launched in the open beta,

473
00:25:15,587 --> 00:25:17,028
connectivity is pretty good.

474
00:25:17,748 --> 00:25:20,049
We launched, and after that, we start

475
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:23,731
seeing a decrease of stability in our matches

476
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:26,152
and connectivity quality in the 4v4 game mode.

477
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,093
And we don't have a clue, or clueless, or like,

478
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:30,933
we don't know what's going on.

479
00:25:32,494 --> 00:25:35,055
And to start understanding what's going on,

480
00:25:35,255 --> 00:25:38,736
we need to put some new tracking in place in the game,

481
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:40,657
and then we dig.

482
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,909
And we discover issues, we discover bugs, and we fix them.

483
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:46,790
And we fix more than 100 bugs within the first weeks,

484
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,970
within the first month.

485
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,191
And the more we fix things, each time we say, OK,

486
00:25:51,211 --> 00:25:53,211
that's the bug that's making everything bad.

487
00:25:53,611 --> 00:25:55,692
As soon as we fix it, everything will be good again.

488
00:25:56,272 --> 00:25:58,993
And the more we fix those, the more we discover other issues

489
00:25:59,013 --> 00:25:59,653
and things like that.

490
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,133
And the more we see that the rates of improvement

491
00:26:03,294 --> 00:26:06,774
we go through will never reach the quality we

492
00:26:06,794 --> 00:26:08,875
want to reach with the game.

493
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:10,975
And we have kind of a glass ceiling.

494
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:15,031
where we never managed to have the connectivity we want to have.

495
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:24,336
And this is because the choice we made, where with Mesh Peer-to-Peer, the weakest link impacts

496
00:26:24,476 --> 00:26:25,557
everybody in the game session.

497
00:26:25,957 --> 00:26:28,799
And I won't go into the details of how it works and all.

498
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:36,522
In fact, we did it a few days ago at Amazon game session, but basically that's the issue.

499
00:26:37,143 --> 00:26:40,765
So in the end, we had to change the online architecture of Honor.

500
00:26:41,296 --> 00:26:42,077
while we were alive.

501
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:46,360
And we moved to the dedicated servers with Amazon Game Lift.

502
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,743
So when I say small problems might become bigger

503
00:26:50,903 --> 00:26:52,764
or will become bigger, in our case,

504
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:55,947
it meant changing the whole online infrastructure

505
00:26:55,987 --> 00:26:56,387
of the game.

506
00:26:56,827 --> 00:26:59,109
So it's like eight months of work,

507
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:01,210
full team dedicated to only do that.

508
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:03,332
So it was huge for us.

509
00:27:03,993 --> 00:27:06,054
So really pay attention to those.

510
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:09,029
Then, second thing we learned is that you

511
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:11,411
need to be ready to adapt your whole production process.

512
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:15,434
Because as soon as you're live, your velocity

513
00:27:15,494 --> 00:27:16,975
is not the same anymore.

514
00:27:17,576 --> 00:27:17,856
Why?

515
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:20,278
Because you have constant emergencies,

516
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:22,280
things that are burning on the live,

517
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,741
things that are not working on the game.

518
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:26,043
The team gets constantly interrupted

519
00:27:26,523 --> 00:27:29,025
by things that are more urgent that weren't

520
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,186
existing the day before.

521
00:27:31,387 --> 00:27:33,229
You have way more frequent milestones.

522
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:36,591
Because as Roman said, patch balancing, it's next week.

523
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:40,358
Another live update will be three weeks after, et cetera.

524
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:43,181
So you're constantly shipping new things.

525
00:27:43,722 --> 00:27:45,463
So the team gets always interrupted.

526
00:27:45,944 --> 00:27:48,446
And then you have all these branches, management.

527
00:27:49,046 --> 00:27:53,451
And on top of that, what we thought candidly is that, oh,

528
00:27:53,511 --> 00:27:54,351
now the game is out.

529
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:55,653
You have less things to test.

530
00:27:55,773 --> 00:27:57,634
So QA should be easier to manage.

531
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:01,637
And in fact, the more you go, the more things you do,

532
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:04,198
and the more new things might impact old things,

533
00:28:04,338 --> 00:28:06,359
and the more also the QA is exploding,

534
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:08,860
and the more QA is taking more time to test everything

535
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,740
every time you want to ship something.

536
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:13,781
So in the end, it's impacting directly the team,

537
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:17,843
their morale and their fatigue, because by doing the same job

538
00:28:17,903 --> 00:28:21,124
as they were doing before, they have worse results,

539
00:28:21,384 --> 00:28:22,705
they are less efficient than before.

540
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:25,506
So it's really something that you need to take into account.

541
00:28:26,282 --> 00:28:29,404
And the other side of the coin is that before launch,

542
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:33,227
we're only focused on doing one thing, which was doing the game

543
00:28:33,448 --> 00:28:34,148
and shipping the game.

544
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:35,790
Yes, we did live play, et cetera,

545
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,592
but everything was stored, making the games,

546
00:28:38,632 --> 00:28:39,252
and shipping it.

547
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:41,835
Well, when you are live, you still

548
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:44,197
do the same thing, which is, for example, the season pass

549
00:28:44,237 --> 00:28:44,637
content.

550
00:28:45,177 --> 00:28:47,639
But on top of that, you have all the live operations,

551
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,000
as I just described.

552
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:52,203
And also, you have to take into account what the players want

553
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:53,264
the game to go.

554
00:28:54,585 --> 00:28:59,508
So in our case, it meant a lot of bugs, a lot of updates,

555
00:28:59,908 --> 00:29:02,149
more than 5,000 new content.

556
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:05,470
On the season pass, it was six new heroes, six new maps,

557
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,871
which is half of what we shipped the game with.

558
00:29:08,532 --> 00:29:11,853
So on top of that, to build that, one new game mode,

559
00:29:11,873 --> 00:29:15,955
new game mode variations, and also many, many improvements

560
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:18,716
based on player feedback, events, things like that.

561
00:29:19,056 --> 00:29:20,337
So a huge amount of work.

562
00:29:22,018 --> 00:29:23,838
And one of the examples that I.

563
00:29:24,187 --> 00:29:25,948
can take here is the balancing.

564
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:29,309
So what did it meant to improve the balancing

565
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:32,210
on the live operation side while taking player feedback

566
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:32,750
into account?

567
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:37,232
So as I said, balancing was one of the core focus of the team

568
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:39,013
after we shipped, because that was

569
00:29:39,113 --> 00:29:41,934
one of the biggest discussion we have with our community.

570
00:29:42,754 --> 00:29:44,975
So we're still doing live operations

571
00:29:45,115 --> 00:29:47,516
as we did before launching the game that we called Public

572
00:29:47,556 --> 00:29:47,896
Tests.

573
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,631
And we identified those as very cool, great tools,

574
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:58,173
but to identify early exploits and bugs,

575
00:29:58,913 --> 00:30:01,533
but not that good to balance really well our game.

576
00:30:02,554 --> 00:30:05,474
And that's where we were like, OK, we

577
00:30:05,494 --> 00:30:07,775
had this discussion with some of our players

578
00:30:07,795 --> 00:30:09,615
before launching the game, and we

579
00:30:09,635 --> 00:30:12,676
need to have an ongoing conversation with them.

580
00:30:13,476 --> 00:30:15,097
And that's where we started to do

581
00:30:15,177 --> 00:30:16,637
what we call community workshop.

582
00:30:16,918 --> 00:30:19,500
where we invite some key players of the game,

583
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,002
so some players of the games, on site

584
00:30:22,562 --> 00:30:24,183
at the Ubisoft Montreal studio,

585
00:30:24,564 --> 00:30:26,045
and we spend a whole week with them

586
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:28,206
where they play new content

587
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,307
that will ship a few months after.

588
00:30:30,968 --> 00:30:33,870
And here, this allowed us to have super early

589
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,412
qualitative feedback, and to have that dialogue with them,

590
00:30:37,472 --> 00:30:38,993
and to understand what was working

591
00:30:39,314 --> 00:30:40,414
and what was not working,

592
00:30:40,915 --> 00:30:43,156
but on top of all, why,

593
00:30:43,616 --> 00:30:45,638
and what was their usage of the game.

594
00:30:46,402 --> 00:30:48,643
And then we put in place a private Discord channel

595
00:30:48,703 --> 00:30:50,764
with the same players and some others

596
00:30:51,244 --> 00:30:53,305
to always be able to continue the discussion.

597
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:56,866
So we were still inviting them every three months,

598
00:30:56,926 --> 00:30:59,387
but we could still continue the discussion in between.

599
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:05,469
Here, the important element, if I can interrupt you,

600
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:08,550
is that our design team is.

601
00:31:09,423 --> 00:31:13,506
on that discord. All of our game designers are on that discord and they are constantly

602
00:31:13,566 --> 00:31:17,448
exchanging with those guys because they have the same level of knowledge of where we are

603
00:31:17,889 --> 00:31:22,392
at a certain point, what character we're developing, etc. And so when you have a question in terms

604
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:27,135
of balancing or if we add two friends on that move, etc., we can have that discussion in

605
00:31:27,175 --> 00:31:31,658
real time with any player in our community. And that is a powerful tool for us at the

606
00:31:31,678 --> 00:31:36,921
moment. And that's for the balancing for the top players. But then you have another side

607
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:38,022
of the community that are...

608
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:40,294
playing more casually with your game.

609
00:31:40,314 --> 00:31:43,377
And we were having the feedback from those

610
00:31:43,497 --> 00:31:45,598
for community channels.

611
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:49,001
And here, it's more to identify the player frustrations,

612
00:31:49,061 --> 00:31:51,923
the broad sortiment, et cetera, and to also take that

613
00:31:51,984 --> 00:31:53,405
into account into our balancing.

614
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:55,667
Because if you only balance the game for the top players,

615
00:31:56,007 --> 00:31:58,969
that might not work for everybody else.

616
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,972
And that's where it led us to this extra step

617
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:07,236
that we call a RIFT, Rapid Iterative Fight Test.

618
00:32:08,097 --> 00:32:13,739
And those are private builds that we do within a few days

619
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:16,820
and that we ship to our player so that they can play at home

620
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,861
and they can test whatever we want or need them to test.

621
00:32:22,282 --> 00:32:25,603
And this was super helpful also to continue the discussion

622
00:32:25,783 --> 00:32:28,244
and to identify other problematics

623
00:32:28,544 --> 00:32:30,984
and to iterate faster.

624
00:32:32,365 --> 00:32:35,626
So production velocity is not the same in live.

625
00:32:37,126 --> 00:32:37,286
And.

626
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:41,742
On top of that, you have to produce a wider variety

627
00:32:41,882 --> 00:32:44,304
of content that are on different timelines.

628
00:32:44,344 --> 00:32:45,985
So you have to ship stuff next week.

629
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,587
You have to build stuff that will be shipped in three

630
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:49,387
months, et cetera.

631
00:32:50,128 --> 00:32:52,570
So you know that your team will be impacted by that.

632
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:57,233
And you need to preserve your team, because the live part

633
00:32:57,313 --> 00:32:58,394
will be super rough.

634
00:32:59,055 --> 00:33:02,517
And what we did, not right away, but by learning that,

635
00:33:02,677 --> 00:33:04,178
what we did after a few months.

636
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:08,465
was we were removing one of the big pressure to the team,

637
00:33:08,685 --> 00:33:12,748
where we decided, OK, we still have deadlines internally.

638
00:33:13,328 --> 00:33:16,390
But now, for everything that is new feature, new improvement,

639
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,332
the community is not aware about,

640
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:20,593
we're not giving any public deadline.

641
00:33:21,053 --> 00:33:23,415
We can still discuss with the community and say it exists.

642
00:33:23,895 --> 00:33:25,936
But we're not giving a public deadline.

643
00:33:26,217 --> 00:33:27,918
Those will be shipped when it's ready.

644
00:33:28,918 --> 00:33:30,519
So remove pressure for the team.

645
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,662
And we also decided to save some time.

646
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,140
to give some time within the plannings

647
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,421
just to manage emergencies.

648
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:41,981
So we were giving a bigger buffer of time,

649
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:43,621
basically, to ship the same content

650
00:33:43,661 --> 00:33:47,742
so that we could handle emergencies or things

651
00:33:47,782 --> 00:33:48,823
that were going wrong.

652
00:33:50,883 --> 00:33:53,243
Last part is the communication.

653
00:33:54,444 --> 00:34:00,105
So before you launch the game, your players are your fans,

654
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,065
your early adopters.

655
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:05,471
But as soon as they pay for your game,

656
00:34:06,271 --> 00:34:07,512
the mindset is changing.

657
00:34:07,752 --> 00:34:08,933
They become your customers.

658
00:34:09,693 --> 00:34:11,134
And on top of that, as I just said,

659
00:34:11,214 --> 00:34:12,595
we're removing public deadline.

660
00:34:13,515 --> 00:34:18,738
So how could we make that Oistplatz strategy green again?

661
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:21,380
How could we convince again our players?

662
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,263
Because one of the thing that was super curious

663
00:34:26,923 --> 00:34:28,704
after a few weeks after launching the game

664
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:31,706
is that the team was crunching as hell.

665
00:34:32,082 --> 00:34:33,643
They shipped the game, they were tired,

666
00:34:33,783 --> 00:34:37,486
but they were still crunching to fix the issues, day and night.

667
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:40,408
And you were going on Reddit or on the forums,

668
00:34:40,728 --> 00:34:44,390
and the only thing you were reading is, team is on vacation,

669
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:49,153
they left the game, Ubisoft made their money, fuckers,

670
00:34:49,274 --> 00:34:50,714
blah, blah, blah.

671
00:34:51,515 --> 00:34:53,636
And so you're like, what's going on?

672
00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:54,357
We're working.

673
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:57,824
a lot and they don't see that.

674
00:34:57,984 --> 00:35:02,105
And that's where we decided to switch our communication

675
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:05,506
strategy, say, OK, we need to be way more transparent.

676
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:07,966
We need to tell them what we're doing, what's going on here.

677
00:35:08,547 --> 00:35:10,607
And we need also to show them early progress.

678
00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:14,168
So even if things are not ready, even if things are not

679
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:18,189
ready to be shown, we need to share more with our players.

680
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:21,490
And here we decided to go back to the core,

681
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,610
to the core community, to go back to the roots.

682
00:35:24,286 --> 00:35:27,228
and start a discussion with them.

683
00:35:27,889 --> 00:35:31,551
And that's where we put in place what we call the Warriors Den.

684
00:35:31,872 --> 00:35:34,914
It's a weekly live stream we do on Twitch,

685
00:35:35,054 --> 00:35:36,615
on all the channels, YouTube, et cetera,

686
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:41,559
where every week, Roman, me, some other key people

687
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,640
of the team, we go in front of a camera

688
00:35:44,441 --> 00:35:48,264
and we answer live player requests, questions,

689
00:35:49,905 --> 00:35:50,545
things that.

690
00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:56,632
they care about. We acknowledge the problem, say, yeah, we're aware of that bug, the team is on it.

691
00:35:57,052 --> 00:36:01,556
We explain our strategy, where we want to go. Sometimes we say, yes, we agree with you,

692
00:36:01,636 --> 00:36:06,799
that would be cool to do that, but we won't be doing it for the next X month because that's our

693
00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:13,084
priorities, that's our focus. And so we explain them our approach, basically, and where we want

694
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:19,408
to go with the game. And we also have a direct exchange with our community.

695
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,392
Because we don't have any more public deadline,

696
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:25,293
that's also a good way how we use public test,

697
00:36:25,773 --> 00:36:28,814
is to show progress of what we're working on,

698
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,414
the big feature we were working on,

699
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:33,335
while also being able to iterate with the players

700
00:36:33,536 --> 00:36:34,556
on those big things.

701
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:38,337
And on top of that, we had the community workshop,

702
00:36:38,617 --> 00:36:39,698
as I told before.

703
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:43,679
And we have also part of the team that is available online.

704
00:36:44,088 --> 00:36:49,053
So we have people where it's their job, but us as well, Romain, me, etc,

705
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:50,434
we're reachable through Twitter.

706
00:36:50,754 --> 00:36:55,839
And we spend one to two hours per day to do some community support stuff,

707
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,801
to answer our players, etc.

708
00:36:58,202 --> 00:37:02,806
Basically to be reachable and to have always that contact with their reality.

709
00:37:04,768 --> 00:37:05,509
And then it's something.

710
00:37:06,397 --> 00:37:07,698
Again, we tried to spread.

711
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:11,200
So we were trying to reach out to the inactive players,

712
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,223
so players who left after launch because things were as good

713
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:16,444
as they were supposed to.

714
00:37:17,264 --> 00:37:18,225
Same thing for the press.

715
00:37:18,645 --> 00:37:21,167
And that's where we started doing new seasons

716
00:37:21,327 --> 00:37:23,448
with new content, doing big streams,

717
00:37:24,749 --> 00:37:27,131
also having extra reward weekends.

718
00:37:27,531 --> 00:37:30,493
And I will show you some of those and in-game events.

719
00:37:31,301 --> 00:37:34,884
We're in the end to find new ways to acquire new players

720
00:37:35,064 --> 00:37:38,126
with Free Weekends, which is a strategy that a lot

721
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,627
of multiplayer games are using.

722
00:37:40,368 --> 00:37:43,770
And we released, I think it's last week, so very recently,

723
00:37:44,171 --> 00:37:47,273
the starter edition, which is a lower entry price point

724
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:51,396
of our game so that more players can come in and have fun

725
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:51,716
with us.

726
00:37:53,298 --> 00:37:55,279
And so with all of those efforts,

727
00:37:55,579 --> 00:37:59,923
we went from a blackout, a community that

728
00:37:59,983 --> 00:38:00,983
wanted to do a blackout.

729
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:03,697
to a community that has to do a whiteout.

730
00:38:03,877 --> 00:38:05,498
I don't know if that word exists.

731
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:09,101
But at least they wanted to celebrate the efforts, et

732
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:12,283
cetera, and they wanted to all play together the same day

733
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:16,065
and be happy about where the game was going.

734
00:38:16,905 --> 00:38:21,468
So after several months of work, we

735
00:38:21,648 --> 00:38:24,670
released the dedicated servers a few weeks ago.

736
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:28,373
So now connectivity on 4v4 game modes is under control.

737
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,054
Same thing for the balancing.

738
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:30,814
Balancing is in.

739
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:33,661
Continuous work, it will never be finished.

740
00:38:33,921 --> 00:38:36,023
Always continuous discussion with our players.

741
00:38:36,484 --> 00:38:37,805
It's true with all fighting games.

742
00:38:37,885 --> 00:38:40,587
But it's something where we have now the good tools to react

743
00:38:41,007 --> 00:38:42,589
and also to identify the problems.

744
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:44,891
And the progression in economy is

745
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:48,514
something we fixed throughout the first year

746
00:38:48,574 --> 00:38:51,577
of the life period, thanks to our server updates.

747
00:38:52,878 --> 00:38:54,879
So we're back on track.

748
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,382
The amusement park is working again.

749
00:38:58,562 --> 00:39:00,763
But as I just said, to do all of that,

750
00:39:01,123 --> 00:39:03,064
it took us almost a year.

751
00:39:04,485 --> 00:39:09,227
And so how did we stay alive during that full year

752
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:14,170
with things that we knew that would take eight months

753
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,010
to be fixed?

754
00:39:16,171 --> 00:39:17,711
First, we retained our players.

755
00:39:17,871 --> 00:39:19,832
So we had more than one million players

756
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:23,194
every month of the game, even if we were not selling the game

757
00:39:23,214 --> 00:39:25,435
during quite a big time.

758
00:39:26,037 --> 00:39:30,820
So we kept our players into the game, and at the same time,

759
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,941
we stayed sustainable.

760
00:39:33,601 --> 00:39:37,003
And what I mean by that is that to ship all of that content

761
00:39:37,323 --> 00:39:38,903
were hundreds on the dev team.

762
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,565
And hundreds, when you don't say a lot of games,

763
00:39:43,706 --> 00:39:45,487
well, to be game as a service, you

764
00:39:45,507 --> 00:39:48,988
need to have extra revenue always coming

765
00:39:49,008 --> 00:39:52,470
in to support the post-launch and to support the team working

766
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,110
on the post-launch.

767
00:39:54,964 --> 00:39:58,667
And for our business model, and I won't go into too much details

768
00:39:59,347 --> 00:40:02,870
because we don't have time, but basically the idea behind For Honor

769
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:06,552
was to say we want to have a balance sources of income.

770
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:08,734
So we want to have incomes from the season pass,

771
00:40:08,794 --> 00:40:13,137
from the sales of the game, and also from monetization.

772
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:18,561
Always by keeping in mind that we wanted the players

773
00:40:18,621 --> 00:40:20,082
to be happy about our model.

774
00:40:20,282 --> 00:40:22,483
So we don't want it to feel as a constraint.

775
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:26,540
We wanted it to be something also that was cool for the players.

776
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:34,586
And so what have we done is that we put in place strong pillars and strong rules.

777
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:41,891
So some of them were, for example, everything, every content that is match-made is always

778
00:40:41,931 --> 00:40:42,612
given for free.

779
00:40:42,772 --> 00:40:47,475
So maps, modes, events, all of that, always given for free to the players.

780
00:40:48,076 --> 00:40:50,057
Season pass, of course, something we sell.

781
00:40:50,629 --> 00:40:52,970
But we don't sell the content of the season pass.

782
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:55,312
We sell the early access of that content.

783
00:40:56,233 --> 00:40:58,975
Because everything that is in the season pass

784
00:40:59,676 --> 00:41:02,698
is also unlockable after launch when you just play the game.

785
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:07,302
And the third pillar is having a single currency.

786
00:41:08,523 --> 00:41:12,726
So everything, the same currency that you earn by playing

787
00:41:12,947 --> 00:41:14,488
is the same currency that you can buy.

788
00:41:14,728 --> 00:41:17,971
So you don't have a hard currency and a soft currency,

789
00:41:18,011 --> 00:41:18,271
et cetera.

790
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:20,877
did we have those three pillars?

791
00:41:21,517 --> 00:41:23,798
First, this way we never split our player base.

792
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:26,320
Whatever content you bought, you didn't bought,

793
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,981
you can always play with everyone within your game.

794
00:41:29,561 --> 00:41:31,903
And there is no content that is behind the paywall

795
00:41:31,963 --> 00:41:34,244
because you can unlock everything through the currency

796
00:41:34,704 --> 00:41:36,105
you unlock just by playing the game.

797
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:40,643
And when I mean anything, it's new heroes, of course.

798
00:41:41,204 --> 00:41:45,586
It's also all the RPG elements of our game, so loot,

799
00:41:45,646 --> 00:41:46,646
crafting, things like that.

800
00:41:47,066 --> 00:41:50,107
But it's also all the cool cosmetic things

801
00:41:50,147 --> 00:41:51,788
we're shipping every week.

802
00:41:54,229 --> 00:41:55,150
Like that outfit.

803
00:42:01,132 --> 00:42:04,714
And it's true for exhibitions.

804
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,841
Very peaceful game and for emotes.

805
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:29,430
It's something we ship every week.

806
00:42:29,571 --> 00:42:31,432
Every week we ship new content to the game.

807
00:42:31,472 --> 00:42:33,273
It's something you can unlock just by playing

808
00:42:33,493 --> 00:42:37,757
or if you want to support the game by investing more in it.

809
00:42:38,676 --> 00:42:42,819
And so thanks to this aspect, we were sustainable.

810
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:46,181
And we could work on the game, fix the issues,

811
00:42:46,221 --> 00:42:48,923
but also bring a lot of new things into the game.

812
00:42:49,563 --> 00:42:52,065
So how did we kept the player inside the game?

813
00:42:52,705 --> 00:42:54,126
So it's a two-side thing.

814
00:42:54,346 --> 00:42:56,828
First part is we've created a routine.

815
00:42:57,628 --> 00:43:01,030
So you have reasons to come back to the game every day.

816
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,164
because you have the daily orders,

817
00:43:03,364 --> 00:43:06,446
and those are the main income for the currency of the game.

818
00:43:06,646 --> 00:43:08,147
So it's something you want to do every day.

819
00:43:08,247 --> 00:43:09,808
Even if it's just for 10 minutes,

820
00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:13,051
you will come every day to get your steal.

821
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:15,212
Then every week, we had new content,

822
00:43:15,312 --> 00:43:18,094
but we were also doing what we call community orders,

823
00:43:18,534 --> 00:43:22,897
so small events where you also earn more rewards.

824
00:43:23,651 --> 00:43:26,413
And then at each season, so every three months,

825
00:43:26,794 --> 00:43:29,296
we're changing the meta of the game with new heroes,

826
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:30,056
new maps.

827
00:43:30,196 --> 00:43:32,538
This is where we're also introducing new game modes,

828
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:35,821
new gear, new content, new progression content,

829
00:43:35,861 --> 00:43:36,522
and things like that.

830
00:43:37,142 --> 00:43:40,725
And all of that is wrapped around this idea

831
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:42,347
that we have inside our game.

832
00:43:42,847 --> 00:43:44,068
That is the faction war.

833
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:47,531
So when you play For Honor, you need to select a faction.

834
00:43:48,011 --> 00:43:50,133
And then everything you do inside the game,

835
00:43:50,213 --> 00:43:52,695
so every matches, every duels, everything.

836
00:43:53,722 --> 00:43:58,505
counts toward your faction and toward the win of your faction

837
00:43:58,785 --> 00:44:00,226
throughout that season.

838
00:44:02,347 --> 00:44:05,229
And this routine was also true outside of the game

839
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:09,251
by the online availability every day, by the weekly live streams

840
00:44:09,492 --> 00:44:12,834
and blog posts, and also by the big streams

841
00:44:13,594 --> 00:44:16,656
and reveal of new content for each new season.

842
00:44:17,736 --> 00:44:20,838
And by doing that and by progressing

843
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:21,819
during that first year.

844
00:44:22,755 --> 00:44:25,855
We also understood some things that, in fact, our job

845
00:44:26,055 --> 00:44:29,116
was evolving from game developer to entertainers.

846
00:44:29,816 --> 00:44:33,077
And that's a huge part today of our work on Forerunner,

847
00:44:33,197 --> 00:44:35,958
is how can we entertain our community?

848
00:44:37,038 --> 00:44:41,179
And what I mean by entertaining is by breaking that routine.

849
00:44:41,399 --> 00:44:43,839
So it's by introducing surprises,

850
00:44:43,919 --> 00:44:45,039
by changing something.

851
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,580
So new game modes are awesome.

852
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,960
For example, there is a game mode

853
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,601
that is called Dance of Death that we release like that.

854
00:44:50,741 --> 00:44:51,741
We further announcing it.

855
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:54,309
was there only for a few days, then we removed it.

856
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:56,991
Then the committee asked us to keep it inside the game,

857
00:44:57,091 --> 00:44:58,352
but that was not the purpose.

858
00:44:58,772 --> 00:45:00,673
And it's something we reintroduce sometimes

859
00:45:01,594 --> 00:45:03,655
where we feel it's a good time.

860
00:45:04,055 --> 00:45:06,537
Then we have extra rewards weekends.

861
00:45:07,197 --> 00:45:10,900
And the biggest example of that are seasonal events.

862
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,602
So I'll show you what is a seasonal event with a trailer

863
00:45:14,642 --> 00:45:17,644
that you will see that is really different from the first

864
00:45:17,664 --> 00:45:18,585
trailer that we show you.

865
00:45:20,803 --> 00:45:29,826
Welcome to the feast of the otherworld, where ghoulish delights have been unfurled for your pleasure to devour.

866
00:45:30,606 --> 00:45:42,929
In this frightening, ungodly hour, skeleton hordes are on their way, their gravest fury on display, for it is the creepiest time of year.

867
00:45:43,269 --> 00:45:47,850
You guessed it, that's right, Halloween is here!

868
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:49,930
Howling werewolves to delight.

869
00:45:50,752 --> 00:45:52,856
Blue flames burning from the King of Knights.

870
00:45:52,956 --> 00:45:55,060
In this place you will find

871
00:45:55,401 --> 00:45:57,384
Viking voodoo and their kind,

872
00:45:57,645 --> 00:45:59,709
samurai demons and zombie...

873
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:08,465
of his lands. Make sure you tiptoe and watch your back, for the end of Skeleton March will

874
00:46:08,505 --> 00:46:14,969
surely attack. So come along, join the feast, with the rest of the beasts of the world is

875
00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:16,269
waiting for you. Boo!

876
00:46:26,913 --> 00:46:29,714
So here, as you can see, it's a really different tone,

877
00:46:30,234 --> 00:46:31,275
different marketing.

878
00:46:31,515 --> 00:46:34,355
It's the team that has fun with their game.

879
00:46:34,956 --> 00:46:39,817
And so what a game mode is, what an event is in Forerunner,

880
00:46:39,977 --> 00:46:41,257
it's an exclusive game mode.

881
00:46:41,437 --> 00:46:44,278
We altered the game as well, so we don't have skeleton.

882
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:47,699
We're more not a realistic, but a grounded world,

883
00:46:47,759 --> 00:46:49,019
if I can say that.

884
00:46:49,419 --> 00:46:52,240
So skeletons are not part of Forerunner's DNA at all.

885
00:46:52,697 --> 00:46:54,318
But for an Halloween event, why not?

886
00:46:54,418 --> 00:46:55,038
Let's have fun.

887
00:46:55,618 --> 00:46:57,798
And we have also some exclusive content

888
00:46:57,998 --> 00:47:01,699
that's only here for a week or two weeks

889
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:04,920
to also celebrate that event.

890
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,441
And what is cool with those, by making this entertainment,

891
00:47:10,501 --> 00:47:12,421
is that players have fun, and it's something

892
00:47:12,461 --> 00:47:13,722
we can clearly see in the data.

893
00:47:14,102 --> 00:47:16,342
So for example, during Halloween event,

894
00:47:16,382 --> 00:47:18,963
we have 20% more play time during that moment.

895
00:47:19,693 --> 00:47:23,116
to just enjoy the new mood of the game.

896
00:47:23,596 --> 00:47:25,438
And it's also something we discovered,

897
00:47:25,478 --> 00:47:29,902
something that the team had a lot of fun to work on.

898
00:47:30,503 --> 00:47:33,045
And when you have that routine of the life that is hard,

899
00:47:33,305 --> 00:47:36,087
something hard, always a constant pressure, et cetera,

900
00:47:36,388 --> 00:47:38,710
when they can put skeletons or silly things like that

901
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:42,553
in their game, they can have fun with their game

902
00:47:42,853 --> 00:47:45,756
and enjoy that part also of the work.

903
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,816
And what is funny is that it's something that also

904
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:51,356
moved outside of the game.

905
00:47:51,897 --> 00:47:54,658
So this idea of entertaining players

906
00:47:54,998 --> 00:47:57,880
has also spread out to, for example, the Warriors' Den.

907
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,201
At the beginning, the Warriors' Den

908
00:48:00,261 --> 00:48:02,962
was very informational, acknowledging problems.

909
00:48:03,002 --> 00:48:04,583
Yes, yes, we love you.

910
00:48:04,663 --> 00:48:06,604
Yes, we want to do a good game, et cetera, et cetera.

911
00:48:07,104 --> 00:48:08,445
But then it become crazier.

912
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,066
We were disguising ourselves.

913
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:11,686
And it became a show on its own.

914
00:48:12,387 --> 00:48:14,808
And now we know that we have some players that

915
00:48:14,868 --> 00:48:15,868
come to the Warriors' Den.

916
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,302
not to have information on the game,

917
00:48:18,322 --> 00:48:22,604
but just to have fun with us, which is also a key part of that.

918
00:48:23,264 --> 00:48:27,227
And it's something that reached way more views

919
00:48:27,247 --> 00:48:29,568
that we thought we would reach with that, because it

920
00:48:29,628 --> 00:48:32,390
was something that was supposed only to be within us

921
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:34,071
and our core community.

922
00:48:35,151 --> 00:48:39,414
So platform learning is to be a game as a service,

923
00:48:40,475 --> 00:48:43,796
you need to constantly entertain your community.

924
00:48:44,336 --> 00:48:47,419
And this comes with a mix of routine and a mix of surprises.

925
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,841
And to be able to do so, you need

926
00:48:50,881 --> 00:48:53,183
to have extra revenue to support the team that

927
00:48:53,423 --> 00:48:54,444
works on that content.

928
00:48:55,765 --> 00:49:01,069
And so to close that talk, if I can go back

929
00:49:01,169 --> 00:49:03,952
to what Romain was saying, is that at the beginning,

930
00:49:03,992 --> 00:49:05,993
we knew how to ship games, but we didn't

931
00:49:06,033 --> 00:49:07,274
knew how to be a platform.

932
00:49:08,355 --> 00:49:11,878
And in fact, what it means is that being a game as a service,

933
00:49:12,138 --> 00:49:13,279
it's like running a marathon.

934
00:49:14,678 --> 00:49:17,460
But it's a different type of marathon.

935
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,621
It's a marathon where you remove the finish line.

936
00:49:20,702 --> 00:49:23,503
So it can get really hard at one point.

937
00:49:24,004 --> 00:49:27,005
So if we could go back in time and speak to ourself

938
00:49:27,085 --> 00:49:30,987
before we launch the game, we'd say, yes, it's

939
00:49:31,048 --> 00:49:33,689
cool to start early to identify the problem and all.

940
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:36,370
But pay attention to the small ones

941
00:49:36,471 --> 00:49:39,932
because they might explode in your face after you launch.

942
00:49:40,753 --> 00:49:42,694
You need to preserve your team now and not

943
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:43,915
when you launch the game.

944
00:49:45,055 --> 00:49:48,736
by also doing no public deadline after launch

945
00:49:49,036 --> 00:49:51,116
and also don't rush in new content.

946
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:52,256
So it's one of the things,

947
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,497
we couldn't went into details here,

948
00:49:55,597 --> 00:49:58,417
but at the beginning, because things were going wrong,

949
00:49:58,858 --> 00:50:00,378
we're rushing a lot of new content

950
00:50:00,478 --> 00:50:02,078
and we're making new problems.

951
00:50:02,118 --> 00:50:04,139
So also don't rush new content, don't panic,

952
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:05,819
preserve your team.

953
00:50:06,479 --> 00:50:09,680
Work with your community, the soonest the better.

954
00:50:10,389 --> 00:50:13,710
Be transparent, surely progress, we're here to help,

955
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:15,011
we're here to enjoy your game.

956
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:18,733
And on top of all, be patient, because victories

957
00:50:18,773 --> 00:50:20,573
comes with a delay, so never give up.

958
00:50:21,133 --> 00:50:23,675
Now Forno is in a much better state than before,

959
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:28,216
and so yes, it's worth it to fight for that.

960
00:50:29,057 --> 00:50:31,898
So if you want to know more about what's going on next,

961
00:50:32,258 --> 00:50:33,819
you still have the Wazen every week.

962
00:50:34,379 --> 00:50:36,020
You can reach out to us.

963
00:50:36,987 --> 00:50:40,930
And normally we did it pretty quick so we can have a huge amount of questions.

964
00:50:50,978 --> 00:50:51,279
Thank you.

965
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:55,502
So if you have any questions, if you don't, we can go and grab a beer.

966
00:50:56,042 --> 00:50:57,383
But if you do, we're here for that.

967
00:50:57,403 --> 00:51:00,466
No questions?

968
00:51:00,486 --> 00:51:01,567
Perfect.

969
00:51:02,327 --> 00:51:02,988
Cool. Thank you.
