1
00:00:07,949 --> 00:00:09,610
Wow, look at all these people here, this is amazing.

2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,311
I thought I was up against a clay talk,

3
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,153
so I figured nobody would be here this morning.

4
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:15,374
So, in fact, I was thinking of just popping over there,

5
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:17,275
if you guys have a minute, I'll be right back.

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:19,877
Yeah, all right, get going.

7
00:00:20,357 --> 00:00:23,019
Okay, hi, I'm Kim, I'm just gonna flip my screen,

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,961
because it's being grumpy here, there we go.

9
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:27,862
Top secret AI notes here that you can't know about,

10
00:00:27,882 --> 00:00:29,123
so they're up here now.

11
00:00:31,206 --> 00:00:34,650
So a lot of you may know me as ZanyTomato, that is my online handle all over the place

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,633
on Twitter and my Gmail account as well.

13
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:40,456
So if you want to look me up, that is me, except on YouTube.

14
00:00:40,836 --> 00:00:44,400
So whatever content is there, ZanyTomato is not me, just putting that out there.

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,043
I've been making games basically my entire life.

16
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:53,149
I think I made my very first game when I was about, I don't know, six years old, so early

17
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:53,770
80s sometime.

18
00:00:54,965 --> 00:01:01,907
And since then I've become incredibly fascinated by how it is we make games and how we as people react to games.

19
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:07,128
So my background is more specifically in how human perception works in games.

20
00:01:07,588 --> 00:01:13,409
I have a PhD in computer science specializing in software engineering and AI and I also have an undergraduate degree in cognitive science,

21
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:16,689
which is basically an interdisciplinary study of the mind.

22
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:21,810
So if you like, I pay attention to how people think in games and that's what I'm always interested in when I'm making games.

23
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:26,551
Most recently I've been working on a little game called Rockets Rockets Rockets.

24
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:29,155
It's a game about rockets.

25
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:33,482
I'm going to talk about it a little bit more in a moment, but just picture rockets and

26
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:34,604
you're probably getting pretty close.

27
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:37,128
But we're here today to talk about AI.

28
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:42,548
So one of the big applications about how the brain works and how we perceive situations

29
00:01:42,648 --> 00:01:45,290
is of course in how we perceive other intelligences.

30
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:49,493
And so I spent a lot of time working in AI systems, big and small.

31
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:54,717
Today we're not going to talk about academic AI, which is a very kind of big, huge, unwieldy

32
00:01:54,777 --> 00:01:57,840
beast that doesn't tend to parcel up and fit nicely into games.

33
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,603
Instead, I'm going to focus on some of the work that I've done around smaller systems.

34
00:02:01,983 --> 00:02:05,306
And essentially what this is, it's a very short talk, so I'm going to try to give you

35
00:02:05,707 --> 00:02:09,530
as much as I can a dense overview of some of the key tips that I have learned

36
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:11,913
through about ten plus years of working in AI.

37
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:16,477
So we're all game developers in this room.

38
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,720
In some capacity we contribute to the wonderful thing that is video games.

39
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:22,883
And as game developers we have one job.

40
00:02:24,147 --> 00:02:25,969
That job is to create an experience.

41
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:30,412
And everything else that we do is in support of that experience.

42
00:02:30,832 --> 00:02:34,114
We should have never, at any point, we should never deviate

43
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,916
from supporting that core experience.

44
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:38,698
And AI is, of course, no exception.

45
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,160
It, too, must be made to support this experience.

46
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,922
It is not about having super clever AI.

47
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:46,463
It's about what does it bring to the game that you're making?

48
00:02:46,784 --> 00:02:50,006
What problems for you does it solve that you otherwise

49
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:52,848
wouldn't be able to solve through simpler means?

50
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:55,899
And I say this as a lifelong AI developer.

51
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,761
I really like AI and I like all the complicated problems.

52
00:02:58,802 --> 00:03:01,724
But it turns out, simple is usually better.

53
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:06,502
So good AI adds a lot to a game.

54
00:03:06,602 --> 00:03:09,042
It can take a game world, it can enhance it,

55
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:12,023
it can bring to life a single player experience in ways

56
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:13,523
that otherwise you might not be able to.

57
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:16,444
It can be a great companion, an awesome component.

58
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:18,845
It can contribute to the wonderful depth that

59
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:20,785
is the visuals of the world, the animation,

60
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:23,666
all sorts of different ways does AI impact our world.

61
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:27,573
There's been some really, really interesting and clever examples

62
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:29,233
throughout the history of games.

63
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:32,195
Half-Life 2 had some really interesting stuff, and as well,

64
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:36,378
its counterpart, the original, had a combination of scripting and AI

65
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:39,760
that was used cleverly to avoid interrupting gameplay.

66
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,801
Very well-tweaked, well-integrated with storyline and player,

67
00:03:43,082 --> 00:03:44,022
enhanced the experience.

68
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:47,504
Not perfect, but nothing I'm going to show today, including my own game,

69
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:48,525
is anywhere near perfect.

70
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:52,207
Thief was all, sorry about the low res image, it was all I could afford.

71
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,308
Thief is also a really great example.

72
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:58,452
It showed AI actors that responded very realistically

73
00:03:58,652 --> 00:03:59,853
to light and to sound.

74
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:05,900
They had actors that voiced the current state, so they were giving feedback constantly to the players.

75
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,801
Neat, interesting system.

76
00:04:08,822 --> 00:04:13,505
Sims is another, kind of a different variation on using AI, but here you see

77
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:18,208
clever abstractions being used to represent core human-like behaviors.

78
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:22,270
And as all of us being humans in this room, it's something that we can respond to very well.

79
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,072
It's something that we inherently understand, being human.

80
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:28,995
Bad AI. Bad AI, no cookie. Get it?

81
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,602
Yeah, it's only going to get worse from here, hang on.

82
00:04:32,823 --> 00:04:34,725
Bad AI, of course, is a threat to flow and immersion.

83
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:38,129
It breaks the very thing that we are setting out to do with our games,

84
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:40,732
to create that experience, to support that core experience.

85
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,675
It's a distraction, right? It's the, hey guys, listen!

86
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:45,197
Through the entire game.

87
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,388
Now, we all have our war stories, right?

88
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:51,809
You know, there's the Dead Rising, right?

89
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:54,230
Where you've got the, you give a survivor a weapon.

90
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:54,730
It's a zombie game.

91
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,651
You give a survivor a weapon.

92
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:56,811
And they're like, man, brilliant.

93
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:58,992
I was running for my life, but allow me to stop and fight

94
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:01,353
every single thing on the way now, because that makes sense.

95
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:04,094
Or StarCraft, you know, you've got your troops clogging up

96
00:05:04,134 --> 00:05:07,235
choke points, Mario Kart, some of the crazy rubber banding.

97
00:05:07,435 --> 00:05:10,276
You know, again, none of these things are necessarily wrong.

98
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:12,277
It's just in their execution, they're

99
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:14,578
breaking what is supposed to be the core part of the game.

100
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,656
Now sometimes it's funny.

101
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:22,700
For those of you who aren't familiar with the basket trick, you can find a basket at

102
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,502
your favorite local shop in Skyrim and you can pick it up and you can put it on the head

103
00:05:26,522 --> 00:05:29,504
of the shopkeeper and then you can proceed to rob them blindly.

104
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:32,946
And that's basically what they'll do.

105
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:35,011
So hilarious, right?

106
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:36,372
I mean, it's pretty funny.

107
00:05:36,772 --> 00:05:37,873
But it's not really canon.

108
00:05:38,473 --> 00:05:40,494
It's not really in support of this wonderful rich world

109
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:41,334
that they have developed.

110
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:43,315
And sure, we can have some fun with it.

111
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,136
But the fun has a limit.

112
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:48,038
One of my personal favorite games,

113
00:05:48,758 --> 00:05:51,519
when I was in university, I spent my time on the 007

114
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,980
speedrunning this game.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,341
That was just what I did for relaxing.

116
00:05:56,682 --> 00:05:58,903
And nothing was more painful than the Natalia level.

117
00:05:59,383 --> 00:06:01,864
Trying to shepherd her to the end of that level

118
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:02,465
was just great.

119
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:08,553
I'm finally, finally wrapping up the therapy from that.

120
00:06:09,074 --> 00:06:09,855
Very, very difficult.

121
00:06:11,057 --> 00:06:12,519
And it's still, interestingly,

122
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,642
still one of my top 10 games of all time.

123
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:21,620
So what I want to do today is I want to frame AI in a particular way.

124
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,862
I want to frame it as a perception problem.

125
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:28,124
It is how we perceive AI in the world that actually

126
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:29,485
governs the quality of the app.

127
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:33,388
Not how complicated it is behind the scenes, not all the clever tricks

128
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:37,090
that we have done, not how it might hold up against Deep Blue

129
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,891
or whatever the current best chess engine is, et cetera,

130
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,252
not how well it does on Jeopardy.

131
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:45,295
All we care about is how the player perceives it in the moment.

132
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:46,916
That's what we're trying to control.

133
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:51,245
It is our job as game developers to manage that perception.

134
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,727
But before we do that, we need to know a little bit

135
00:06:55,807 --> 00:06:56,827
about how the brain works.

136
00:06:57,767 --> 00:06:59,327
So let's segue a little bit into the brain.

137
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:02,748
There are a ton of things you actually need to know,

138
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:05,149
but I'm trying to pull out a few salient elements that I

139
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:08,150
think you want to keep in mind when you are creating AIs.

140
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:12,725
The first is that brains are incredibly stubborn.

141
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:17,887
We are not, at the best of times, very good at fighting our natural tendencies.

142
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:21,168
Have you ever tried to break a habit? Have you ever tried to quit smoking?

143
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:24,389
Or, you know, whatever, say um too much while you're talking?

144
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,151
All of these things are incredibly difficult to do.

145
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:29,772
We're worse when we're in a flow state,

146
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:31,632
which is hopefully where our players are going to be.

147
00:07:34,693 --> 00:07:37,275
Our brains are hardwired to find patterns.

148
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:38,835
We can't help it.

149
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,394
As a culture, we talk about stereotypes as being an incredibly negative thing, but there's

150
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:45,835
a flip side, there's a positive.

151
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:51,140
Stereotypes are what allow us to efficiently navigate our world, to deal with the onslaught

152
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,843
of information that is always being fired at us at any given moment, especially in today's

153
00:07:54,903 --> 00:07:55,483
modern time.

154
00:07:57,045 --> 00:08:01,388
Unfortunately, it means we suck when it comes to random at small scales, because we're so

155
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:06,333
intense, intensely bound to finding a pattern, that we will find it in even the smallest

156
00:08:06,393 --> 00:08:06,533
thing.

157
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,148
Now you can actually embed some form of personality in repetition, etc.

158
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:14,689
But generally it's set as a flag.

159
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,469
Something is going wrong when there is repetition.

160
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:18,930
There are some things that we tend to repeat.

161
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,750
You know, if you come over here and you punch me in the head,

162
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,671
I'll probably say ow.

163
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:23,151
Then maybe a few other things.

164
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:25,332
And if you come back later and you punch me in the head again,

165
00:08:25,352 --> 00:08:28,013
I will probably say ow and then WTF.

166
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:30,413
But the ow part is consistent.

167
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:31,714
It's OK that I repeat that.

168
00:08:32,014 --> 00:08:36,095
But very rarely are there those kinds of gems that you can repeat.

169
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:38,796
And that includes visuals and all sorts of things.

170
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:42,148
And that's because things stand out if they don't fit.

171
00:08:42,968 --> 00:08:47,690
Our entire brains really are giant pattern matching systems,

172
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,811
which means that they are very good at policing when something

173
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:51,791
doesn't fit a pattern.

174
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:53,972
Everything that our brain wants to do

175
00:08:54,052 --> 00:08:55,732
is to take a look at everything around us

176
00:08:56,332 --> 00:08:57,533
and fit it into a pattern.

177
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:02,094
If you guys grew up watching Sesame Street,

178
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:04,415
this was one of our earliest victories, right?

179
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:05,595
You guys, come on, sing it with me.

180
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:08,436
One of these things is not like the other.

181
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:08,937
That's all I know.

182
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,311
We anthropomorphize.

183
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:17,514
Brains attribute human-like behavior no matter what.

184
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,557
They also attribute intelligent behavior, too.

185
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:21,778
Interesting.

186
00:09:21,818 --> 00:09:23,319
If brains are automatically going

187
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:24,840
to attribute intelligent behavior,

188
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,582
maybe as AI developers, we should just get out

189
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:28,563
of the way of the brain.

190
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:33,046
There are also storytellers.

191
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:34,947
By the way, for those of you who didn't go to the Clay Talk,

192
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,809
it's about Invisible Link, but that's a hat from Don't Starve.

193
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:45,515
So games will, games, bigger brain, brains will take the most flawed input and they will weave it into some narrative.

194
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:49,777
Our brains do not work like our memory in our computers.

195
00:09:50,217 --> 00:09:54,818
We do not have discretized memory slots into which we fit different components.

196
00:09:55,118 --> 00:09:56,079
It's nothing like that.

197
00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:57,039
It is really...

198
00:09:57,979 --> 00:10:01,842
A schema, a series of schema for weaving together narratives.

199
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:07,406
If you've ever looked at any of those self-help books for improving your memory, and they

200
00:10:07,446 --> 00:10:11,208
talk about taking different objects and weaving them into a story, that's why.

201
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:13,510
You're leveraging what your brain naturally does.

202
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:16,392
Scary thought.

203
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:21,775
They're so good at weaving narrative, and our brains are so afraid of holding contradictions

204
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:25,558
and cognitive dissonance and all of those crazy things, that our brains will actually

205
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:27,079
unconsciously shift our memories.

206
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:31,681
So whatever we perceive at reality at any given moment

207
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:36,068
is only the reality that your brain has decided to show you in that moment.

208
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:39,773
So sit and think on that when you're falling asleep tonight, it's disturbing.

209
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:41,877
Speaking of disturbing!

210
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:45,662
So, a lot of you have probably heard of the uncanny valley.

211
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:51,383
The uncanny valley is when we start to get something that is lifelike enough, but not

212
00:10:51,463 --> 00:10:51,944
quite enough.

213
00:10:52,364 --> 00:10:56,745
It's looking more and more real, enough that our brains are starting to put expectations

214
00:10:56,825 --> 00:11:00,406
on just how real that should go, and yet it's not quite there.

215
00:11:00,646 --> 00:11:05,228
And so, other systems in our brain are going, whoa, something weird going on, I should avoid

216
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:05,488
that.

217
00:11:06,556 --> 00:11:09,337
As game developers, this means that as you increase fidelity,

218
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:12,298
you increase your responsibility to uphold that fidelity.

219
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,158
This means different things in different aspects of games.

220
00:11:15,178 --> 00:11:18,219
But in particular, in AI, the more you model,

221
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,720
the more likely something will stand out

222
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
as artificial to your brain.

223
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:30,203
You guys seen this before?

224
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,923
It's great, right?

225
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:33,004
It's still funny to me.

226
00:11:33,104 --> 00:11:34,244
I just, I always love this.

227
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:36,125
So what the heck's going on here?

228
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:45,919
So good, right? So good, so good. So this is creepy Watson if you weren't familiar with the

229
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,884
So Watson is, of course, behaving strangely.

230
00:11:52,424 --> 00:11:54,385
If even if you were to flip the camera around

231
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:57,387
and he looked like this, that would be more believable

232
00:11:57,427 --> 00:11:59,689
because now there was an opportunity to weave a narrative

233
00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:01,870
around how he was getting to where he was going.

234
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,051
But he's not, right?

235
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:05,112
He's just doing all of these crazy, creepy things.

236
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:06,433
He's teleporting around the room.

237
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:09,714
It breaks our expectation because our brains

238
00:12:09,755 --> 00:12:11,456
are trying desperately to weave a narrative

239
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:12,816
and the only one that they end up with.

240
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,637
That dramatic music will kill that.

241
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:17,298
The only one that they end up with is, of course,

242
00:12:17,498 --> 00:12:18,379
this creepy character.

243
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,679
We can't resolve it.

244
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,201
So that's a great example of the fidelity

245
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:26,382
that we were set to expect, given the world, et cetera.

246
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:28,062
I mean, he even turns his head to follow,

247
00:12:28,463 --> 00:12:30,784
is messing with our brains and setting our expectations

248
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,825
too high that this current demo is not delivering on.

249
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:37,146
So really, a suggestion of behavior

250
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:38,947
is much better than a complex model.

251
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:41,468
Brains will assume that the complexity is there.

252
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:45,010
Most of you have probably played Pac-Man or at least seen it.

253
00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:50,358
For years, massively complex behaviors were attributed to the four ghosts.

254
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:51,420
What is it? Inky, Blinky...

255
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,842
something in Clyde, inky blinky slinky, I don't know, whatever, four ghosts, them, there.

256
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,644
And it turned out that on the grid, each ghost really had a home spot, and the

257
00:13:00,704 --> 00:13:04,566
home spot was a corner set out from the actual map that you as a player could

258
00:13:04,606 --> 00:13:05,046
traverse.

259
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:08,728
And then it had little behaviors for switching between chasing and evading,

260
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,128
etc.

261
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:13,850
But really, when you boil it down, it was an incredibly simple series of

262
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:18,993
of steps that were driving this, that gave rise to what otherwise seemed like

263
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,273
highly complex behavior.

264
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:21,814
You don't need to do a lot.

265
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,422
But it's very important that this be consistent with the player's mental model.

266
00:13:26,862 --> 00:13:28,904
Now, you aren't in control of your player,

267
00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:33,267
but you are nonetheless setting them up to be receptive to the world

268
00:13:33,307 --> 00:13:36,489
that you are trying to create believability in.

269
00:13:36,969 --> 00:13:39,511
You are the one that is in charge of mitigating the distance that

270
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:42,273
sits between them and their screen in such a way

271
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,734
that they are able to get pulled in.

272
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:47,456
And nothing, at least very little, is going to interrupt that.

273
00:13:50,642 --> 00:13:55,004
So Steambirds is a game where you're flying around and you're trying to maneuver yourself

274
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:56,465
such that you can shoot down your opponent.

275
00:13:56,725 --> 00:14:00,387
And the AI in this one, this was written by Andy Moore, it's like right there.

276
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:05,429
The AI in this one again is another great example of a very straightforward, simple

277
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:05,809
system.

278
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,931
And yet it was perceived as very, very complex and he tells a really great story, which I'm

279
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,592
going to bastardize since he's sitting in the front row.

280
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:19,315
where he had a class that was assigned this game to deconstruct the AI.

281
00:14:19,335 --> 00:14:22,338
And these poor students were working on it, and working on it, and working on it.

282
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:23,999
And I'm like, just this AI, man.

283
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,840
Like, how?

284
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,661
How did this work?

285
00:14:25,701 --> 00:14:26,341
This is incredible.

286
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:26,782
I can't.

287
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:28,163
We can't seem to figure this out.

288
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,426
And so the professor did the only thing that a professor would do,

289
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:33,388
invited Andy in to talk to the class.

290
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:36,471
And as Andy was taking a closer look at the AI,

291
00:14:36,531 --> 00:14:38,773
he realized that he had transposed the x and y coordinates.

292
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:45,426
He said, oops.

293
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:48,368
But why did this work?

294
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:51,511
Because it fit the player's mental model.

295
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:55,333
Even though it was actually a typo, undocumented feature,

296
00:14:56,374 --> 00:14:58,075
it worked with your expectation of how

297
00:14:58,115 --> 00:14:59,096
the game was supposed to work.

298
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:03,039
Contrast that with my recent game of Dragon Age Inquisition,

299
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:04,019
which I love, by the way.

300
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:04,980
I don't mean to slight the game.

301
00:15:07,142 --> 00:15:08,883
This doesn't fit with my mental model.

302
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:11,004
I don't know about you guys, but chest surfing

303
00:15:11,124 --> 00:15:13,266
is not usually present in these sorts of worlds.

304
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,921
One thing that I think Dragon Age does get very right,

305
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:19,402
they get a lot of things right, but in particular relevant to chests,

306
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:23,823
is most games historically just, you know, leave chests out in the middle of the wilderness,

307
00:15:24,064 --> 00:15:26,965
unattended. They at least assign somebody to guard it.

308
00:15:26,985 --> 00:15:28,485
It's kind of, I mean...

309
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,546
Yeah, anyway.

310
00:15:32,086 --> 00:15:32,506
You get my point.

311
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:33,907
So work with the brain.

312
00:15:34,907 --> 00:15:36,348
Do less, get more.

313
00:15:36,628 --> 00:15:38,248
Less is more, less is more, less is more.

314
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:41,008
So let's come back to AI as a perception problem.

315
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:42,689
What does this mean for us?

316
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:44,750
Distill your AI needs.

317
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,531
What are the broad sweeping behaviors that you need?

318
00:15:48,311 --> 00:15:51,232
Start simple, resist complicating.

319
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:52,133
I say resist.

320
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:55,414
Complication in and of itself or more complex systems

321
00:15:55,774 --> 00:15:58,575
isn't necessarily bad and may be right for you

322
00:15:58,615 --> 00:15:59,656
depending upon the game.

323
00:16:00,456 --> 00:16:02,937
But resist the urge to just jump into something more complex.

324
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:03,777
Start simple.

325
00:16:04,758 --> 00:16:05,178
Use the brain.

326
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,059
I'm wearing Star Wars shoes by the way,

327
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:08,099
just I hope you appreciate it.

328
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:15,837
So let's take you through an example. This is what I did. I did a bunch of different things on Rockets, Rockets, Rockets.

329
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:18,678
One of the things that I did was I wrote the AI for it.

330
00:16:19,238 --> 00:16:23,019
If you are not familiar with the game, it is dogfighting meets figure skating in space.

331
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:26,700
If that wasn't clear, it is a fast-paced game of rocket tag.

332
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,461
I grew up in the 80s, as I alluded to earlier, so this is very much for me, and I won't speak

333
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:35,202
for the rest of the team, but it's very much a tribute to those games that I grew up playing.

334
00:16:35,642 --> 00:16:41,264
I like colorful games, I loved Tron when I was a kid, I like things that challenge me,

335
00:16:41,324 --> 00:16:46,985
that are worthy of my time to spend with my friends, or even just the little bit of actual

336
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:49,226
gaming time that I get these days to spend it on something.

337
00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:51,206
So I was trying to go for that.

338
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:52,826
It's a couch-based multiplayer game.

339
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:55,257
It is very fast.

340
00:16:55,697 --> 00:16:57,878
It has a lot of momentum, you just push in the direction that you go,

341
00:16:57,898 --> 00:16:59,858
but there's a little bit of momentum that you need to counteract,

342
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:00,799
so it takes a bit of learning.

343
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,180
It's very close dogfighting, you're bumping into things.

344
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,301
I'm going to show you a quick little video of it.

345
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:10,262
Let's see if this works.

346
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,012
Dogfighting means figure skating in space, told you.

347
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:28,294
And this is Stanley.

348
00:17:28,454 --> 00:17:29,515
This is the AI that I wrote.

349
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,618
So Stanley Parable is one of my all-time favorite games, and I was playing it a lot when I was

350
00:17:33,658 --> 00:17:37,260
working on the AI, and I decided to name the AI Stanley.

351
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,462
So if you haven't bought Stanley Parable, if you haven't met Davey Written, he's amazing,

352
00:17:40,802 --> 00:17:41,923
go buy that, go meet Davey.

353
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:43,244
Fantastic.

354
00:17:43,824 --> 00:17:44,925
So I set myself three rules.

355
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:46,526
I said, always have a working brain.

356
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:51,874
All behavior must be controller-based, so effectively think of that like I wrote a controller API,

357
00:17:51,955 --> 00:17:55,856
so that anything that the player had to do, which naturally would be done through the controller,

358
00:17:56,277 --> 00:17:57,197
Stanley did as well.

359
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,778
And respect the player. I was not going to pander.

360
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:03,320
As well, it's a lot easier to make your AI easier later.

361
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,582
It's incredibly hard to write legitimately challenging AI.

362
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:09,163
So here are the steps that I did.

363
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:11,524
First step, watch people play.

364
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,421
This is something that I think is often overlooked, but you need to know how humans play if you're going to make something that looks like a human.

365
00:18:19,795 --> 00:18:22,036
And I wasn't just trying to get a sense of how people played,

366
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:27,919
I was also very interested in how other people might expect another human to play or not play.

367
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:32,821
And I started to form from this a general idea of what an AI opponent would look like.

368
00:18:33,402 --> 00:18:35,663
Now bear in mind this was a very early iteration of the game,

369
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:37,543
there were lots of different things that were wrong with it,

370
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,565
but it doesn't invalidate the step of spending time with your game

371
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:42,546
to figure out how humans are interacting with it.

372
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:46,688
I defined some broad behaviors that were happening on the screen.

373
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:51,451
avoiding, if that was a little bit confusing, it's just sort of like going the other direction.

374
00:18:51,491 --> 00:18:54,775
But you know, chasing, evading, just kind of looping around, ramming in.

375
00:18:57,118 --> 00:18:58,459
And I started stupid.

376
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:03,200
don't get me wrong, I really want, I had all these grandiose plans for this incredibly

377
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,021
complex system

378
00:19:05,141 --> 00:19:07,542
and I really really wanted to do something complex but I started

379
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:11,984
stupid. I wanted to give the brain the best chance to weave its own narrative.

380
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:17,087
I wanted to see first what it did before I stepped up and went no no no no no no

381
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,047
AI engineer, I got this

382
00:19:18,428 --> 00:19:19,408
and got in the way of the brain.

383
00:19:19,988 --> 00:19:22,950
You can obscure intelligent behaviors

384
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,191
that are naturally emerging if you go complex too fast.

385
00:19:29,273 --> 00:19:30,954
This is the very first version of Stanley.

386
00:19:31,874 --> 00:19:32,894
It just follows the player.

387
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:35,536
When I pushed this build, my teammates were like,

388
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:37,036
whoa, how long have you been working on this?

389
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:37,676
This is great.

390
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:38,897
I was like, yeah, I'm on to something.

391
00:19:39,797 --> 00:19:40,158
Excellent.

392
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:40,938
Excellent.

393
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:43,719
Got a little more complicated.

394
00:19:43,939 --> 00:19:44,940
Just don't worry.

395
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:51,571
I then took that and I started studying it for appropriate and inappropriate behaviors.

396
00:19:51,971 --> 00:19:56,753
I didn't care that my algorithm was stupid, I cared that I created a simple model free

397
00:19:56,773 --> 00:20:01,615
of confounding factors, that I could see what then went into creating an intelligent component.

398
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:05,837
And there were all sorts of things that I noticed that were going crazy.

399
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,471
I'm just going to go through a couple of them.

400
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:10,631
You can go back through the slides later and take a boo at that.

401
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,832
So one of the big important things is intelligent randomness.

402
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:16,933
I mentioned earlier that the brain detects patterns like that.

403
00:20:17,553 --> 00:20:19,353
We're always on the lookout for patterns,

404
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,434
which means that you want to use things like normal curves,

405
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:24,754
not uniform distributions, because, you know,

406
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:28,135
generally things in life are the result of multiple contributing factors.

407
00:20:28,515 --> 00:20:29,715
And if you think about rolling dice,

408
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:32,676
there are a lot of different combinations that add up to the same values,

409
00:20:32,716 --> 00:20:33,996
which gives you a bell curve.

410
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:36,897
So your randomness should be more natural just in doing that.

411
00:20:37,677 --> 00:20:40,539
But also you need to ask yourself that just because something was awesome once

412
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,721
does not mean it'll be awesome the second time.

413
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:44,662
The second time the player's brain might go,

414
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:46,884
wait a minute, seen this before.

415
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:47,524
Bullshit.

416
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:48,985
How am I allowed to swear?

417
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:50,026
Sorry.

418
00:20:53,028 --> 00:20:55,210
Now, I caught myself not taking my own advice.

419
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,731
I wish I had been to this talk before I started this.

420
00:20:58,672 --> 00:21:00,193
This is really just for past Kim.

421
00:21:00,954 --> 00:21:02,875
I haven't worked out the details of how that's going to work, but...

422
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:04,436
So I went complex.

423
00:21:05,362 --> 00:21:08,484
I actually started with a navmesh and I was screwing around with it for way too long.

424
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:10,605
It was getting really ticked off and I couldn't make it work.

425
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,846
It's just, the behavior was unnatural.

426
00:21:13,286 --> 00:21:14,847
Stanley wasn't behaving like the humans.

427
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:17,568
I'm like, oh man, maybe all these years of AI, I don't know what I'm doing.

428
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:18,068
Damn it.

429
00:21:18,128 --> 00:21:19,549
I'm gonna take away my PhD.

430
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:22,431
And so I said, screw it.

431
00:21:23,232 --> 00:21:23,772
Toss everything.

432
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:24,673
Nuke and pave, baby.

433
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:25,253
Nuke and pave.

434
00:21:25,273 --> 00:21:28,596
So I took it all out, and I switched to raycasts.

435
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:29,476
That's it.

436
00:21:29,536 --> 00:21:32,959
This is my top secret reveal of all of GDC.

437
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:35,380
That's all Stanley's navigation is.

438
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:37,602
It's just raycasts.

439
00:21:37,982 --> 00:21:39,523
Now why did the raycasts look like this?

440
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,004
Well, I thought about humans again.

441
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:42,365
What do humans do?

442
00:21:42,405 --> 00:21:44,827
We tend to navigate on the basis of what is in front of us.

443
00:21:45,147 --> 00:21:49,450
We make bigger, broader, farther reaching judgments

444
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,791
on the basis of what's farther out.

445
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,781
and less so about here. I mean, we really only need to fit ourselves around things.

446
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:56,142
We don't need to be like,

447
00:21:56,202 --> 00:21:58,062
Whoa, there's a wall way over there!

448
00:21:59,023 --> 00:22:00,884
And also because the game was fast-paced,

449
00:22:00,924 --> 00:22:03,305
people were naturally looping around and bumping into things,

450
00:22:03,345 --> 00:22:05,205
and so I wanted Stanley to do that too.

451
00:22:05,645 --> 00:22:08,006
Because if he was too perfect, people would, uh...

452
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:10,688
Bullshit. Sorry, I already said it once.

453
00:22:14,712 --> 00:22:16,593
The game also has a very natural dance that emerges.

454
00:22:16,613 --> 00:22:19,434
You're swooping in, you're swooping out, you're swooping all over the place.

455
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:21,754
I wanted to take advantage of that.

456
00:22:22,214 --> 00:22:25,435
It's very easy to do repetitious things in AI.

457
00:22:25,495 --> 00:22:28,396
So I started out with an algorithm just that had him doing loops.

458
00:22:28,476 --> 00:22:29,897
So I mean, I slightly lie.

459
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:32,238
It's Raycast plus some behavior patterns, right?

460
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:34,998
I have a hierarchical state machine driving all this under the hood.

461
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:40,129
But I was able to hide those things in the natural repetition of the game.

462
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:42,851
And because I had studied the game in the way so many people played,

463
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:44,752
I knew that this was going to work.

464
00:22:46,514 --> 00:22:47,254
And then I iterated.

465
00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:49,796
It's my favorite slide, by the way. Isn't that cool?

466
00:22:50,056 --> 00:22:50,697
I really like that.

467
00:22:51,758 --> 00:22:52,778
And it seemed to work.

468
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,060
The game is currently on Steam Early Access,

469
00:22:56,261 --> 00:22:57,142
if you want to give it a try.

470
00:22:57,742 --> 00:23:00,064
It seems to have passed the rocket Turing test.

471
00:23:00,104 --> 00:23:02,786
Yes, I know that's a Turing machine, not the Turing test,

472
00:23:02,806 --> 00:23:04,807
but I was just so proud of the slide that I left in it.

473
00:23:06,537 --> 00:23:07,238
I do know the difference.

474
00:23:07,598 --> 00:23:09,499
Catch me in that wrap-up room if you want to talk about it.

475
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,523
People thought that they were playing humans again and again and again and again.

476
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:17,245
And holy cow, that doesn't feel really good.

477
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:20,907
And just to wrap up, I'm going to share some quotes.

478
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:26,011
Really enjoying online multiplayer, but I'd like to be able to choose who I'm playing.

479
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:31,054
The game is local multiplayer only and only ever has been.

480
00:23:32,175 --> 00:23:36,117
So this is a game, oh my god, time passes, crazy fight.

481
00:23:36,337 --> 00:23:37,938
Wow, this AI is actually a worthy opponent.

482
00:23:38,078 --> 00:23:38,659
It can't talk.

483
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:42,101
Various Let's Play videos have some incarnation of this.

484
00:23:42,981 --> 00:23:45,123
Various descriptions of complex hunting, evasive, responsive,

485
00:23:45,143 --> 00:23:47,204
and vindictive behaviors that I never wrote.

486
00:23:49,605 --> 00:23:50,626
Great AI update.

487
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,571
Wow, this AI, thank you.

488
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,206
And my personal favorite.

489
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:06,947
A lot of variations of that one.

490
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:07,947
So he's challenging.

491
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:08,727
He's definitely challenging.

492
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:10,388
OK, rapid fire wrap up.

493
00:24:10,628 --> 00:24:11,708
Support the core experience.

494
00:24:11,808 --> 00:24:13,848
Watch people play and get in their heads.

495
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:17,449
Identify broad behaviors, not intricate, detailed ones

496
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:19,469
that are probably going to collapse on closer inspection

497
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:21,290
by this smart little brain thing anyway.

498
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,370
Start simple.

499
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,270
Resist complicating the AI.

500
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,691
Figure out what your brain and your players' brains

501
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:28,811
give you for free and work with that.

502
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:30,712
Try going simpler before you go complex.

503
00:24:31,072 --> 00:24:35,554
Remember, once an AI has done something stupid, it is incredibly hard to overcome that bias,

504
00:24:36,054 --> 00:24:39,196
commit to something simple, easy to do a good job, something complex, easy to screw up.

505
00:24:40,216 --> 00:24:40,457
Thank you.
