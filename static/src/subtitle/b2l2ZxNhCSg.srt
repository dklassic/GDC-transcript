1
00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:07,377
Hello, can you hear me?

2
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:09,498
Excellent.

3
00:00:09,698 --> 00:00:10,978
I can't see any of you.

4
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:12,019
This is awesome.

5
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:14,479
I'd like to congratulate all of you

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,920
for finding the secret talk.

7
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:22,922
I feel like the Foo Fighters at South by Southwest,

8
00:00:23,062 --> 00:00:24,443
the secret show that no one knows about.

9
00:00:24,643 --> 00:00:25,643
Congratulations again.

10
00:00:27,224 --> 00:00:28,484
What I want to talk about is sort

11
00:00:28,504 --> 00:00:30,925
of an interesting question I hear come up a lot, which is,

12
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:34,246
why do people play massive multiplayer games alone?

13
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:34,547
I mean.

14
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:38,696
if you think about it, they're in the title right. The title of the genre is Massively

15
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:43,158
Multiplayer Games. It seems like people who aren't playing Massively Multiplayer Games,

16
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:48,480
say Massively Multiplayer, are missing the point somehow. They're like, it'd be like

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,441
playing a first person shooter game without picking up any guns, just throwing flowers

18
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:56,383
at the bad guys or something. Is there something wrong with these people?

19
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:01,159
Now this is something I've been thinking about for a long time because, well, I've been making

20
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,140
Massive Multiplayer Games for a long time.

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,401
I've also been talking about them, writing about them, thinking about them, playing them.

22
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,802
And one of the things I'd like to point out is that I noticed a long time ago that even

23
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:15,323
though everybody said that you should be playing Massive Multiplayer Games with other people,

24
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:17,664
I was always trying to find ways to play them by myself.

25
00:01:18,284 --> 00:01:23,386
So it's always something that I've seen as a play pattern inside of these spaces.

26
00:01:23,546 --> 00:01:24,486
Now, you know, personally...

27
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:29,517
A lot of people who follow me and have known me over the years know that I like to talk

28
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:35,580
about various game design issues that sort of permeate the MMO sphere entirely, such

29
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,921
as should we have permadeath?

30
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:38,782
The answer to that is no, by the way.

31
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:41,644
Should we have virtual economies?

32
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:43,685
Should they be sandboxes or theme parks?

33
00:01:44,025 --> 00:01:46,326
Are classes and levels destroying the genre?

34
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:50,609
Well, one of the things that started showing up relatively recently, and I've certainly

35
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:53,730
seen it on our boards, and I've started seeing it on the boards of our competitors...

36
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:58,313
is people asking on our boards, can I solo in this game?

37
00:01:59,594 --> 00:02:02,116
Now, these are massively multiplayer message boards,

38
00:02:02,216 --> 00:02:02,456
right?

39
00:02:02,516 --> 00:02:04,157
And so they don't actually say it this nicely.

40
00:02:04,177 --> 00:02:06,298
They more along phrase it something like,

41
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:09,720
do I have to really group up with a bunch of mouth-breathing,

42
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,401
knuckle-dragging idiots in order to do

43
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:14,122
the most basic, stupid, banal tasks in your stupid game?

44
00:02:15,123 --> 00:02:15,343
Yeah.

45
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:17,624
Why is this an interesting question?

46
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:22,387
This is an interesting question because the answer used to be,

47
00:02:23,498 --> 00:02:26,219
No, you can't solo. You have to play with other people.

48
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,682
You really couldn't do much of anything in EverQuest unless you grouped up.

49
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:35,444
If you tried to, like, play Yuoso, you'd be assassinated when you left the city gates.

50
00:02:35,644 --> 00:02:38,105
Shadowbane was a worthless game if you played solo.

51
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,487
But since then, the answer has become yes.

52
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:45,109
Games like World of Warcraft and Free Realms and City Heroes,

53
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:49,351
which I consider one of the principal games that did this early on,

54
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:51,452
all took the stance that...

55
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:54,538
you should be able to play most of the game by yourself.

56
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:55,758
Not all of the game.

57
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:57,459
There's still stuff we reserve for groups.

58
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,261
But you should be able to do a whole bunch of the game

59
00:03:00,301 --> 00:03:00,941
by yourself.

60
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:03,003
And I think this is interesting because this

61
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:07,065
is a full revolution of game design canon.

62
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:08,646
It is something where we've all collectively

63
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:11,508
changed our mind and said, whoa, we were wrong before.

64
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,451
Now, there are still some zealots that say, hey,

65
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:17,971
we make multiplayer games.

66
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:21,859
And people who play multiplayer games by themselves are doing it wrong.

67
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:26,582
And they sort of have this attitude that people who play by themselves are psychos or weirdos,

68
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:26,902
you know.

69
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:28,703
You know, he kept to himself.

70
00:03:29,683 --> 00:03:31,224
He didn't bug anybody and he freaked out.

71
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,506
But one of the things that we have to keep in mind when we talk about the loners and

72
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:38,188
think about the loners is that the loner is also a heroic archetype.

73
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:40,350
Right?

74
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,793
People don't imagine being a serial killer, but they certainly imagine being Batman or

75
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:46,613
the Lone Ranger.

76
00:03:47,462 --> 00:03:49,663
And more to the point, if you really think about it,

77
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:54,085
being a loner is an inherently social thing.

78
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:57,046
You can't be a loner in a single-player game

79
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:00,088
because you're not setting yourself apart from somebody.

80
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,888
In order to be a loner, you basically

81
00:04:01,948 --> 00:04:04,269
have to have a group of people that you're being standoffish

82
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:05,510
and kind of ignoring.

83
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:10,272
So being a loner, there are people

84
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:12,453
who want to sort of be the loner inside of the game environment,

85
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:15,034
because, well, to them, that is part of the heroic fantasy.

86
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,721
Anyway, I don't want people to think for a second

87
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:24,123
that we should be making just solely massively single player

88
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:24,504
games.

89
00:04:25,444 --> 00:04:27,646
At the end of the day, our unique selling proposition

90
00:04:27,806 --> 00:04:28,806
is still social.

91
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:29,807
It's still massive.

92
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:31,328
It's the things that we do well.

93
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:34,590
You know, raids are what WoW does

94
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,712
that you can't do inside of, say, a Baldur's Gate or Diablo

95
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:42,014
or one of these single player or lightly multiplayer RPGs.

96
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:44,916
Similarly, EVE Online.

97
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,417
There's a whole bunch of things that you

98
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:47,678
can do in a space game.

99
00:04:48,738 --> 00:04:52,981
if you don't have to worry about the massive technical problems and social problems that

100
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:55,282
being a massively multiplayer game brings to the fore.

101
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:57,764
But this is what excites the imagination, right?

102
00:04:58,084 --> 00:05:00,445
This is the stuff that gets in Slashdot and Wired Magazine.

103
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:02,246
The really big epic fights.

104
00:05:02,787 --> 00:05:05,408
That's what the genre does really well and we have to embrace that.

105
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,932
Similarly the City Siege games, like your Dark Age of Camelot, your Warhammer, your

106
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:12,493
Shadowbane.

107
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:18,617
These are things that excite the imagination about the possibility of the genre, the idea

108
00:05:18,677 --> 00:05:23,141
that there are lots of people that are somehow working together or working against each other

109
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:24,122
for a common cause.

110
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:29,827
And these are our unique selling proposition, and we have to concentrate on this stuff because

111
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:33,750
in order to get this stuff to work, we have to kind of back off on this stuff.

112
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,134
We have to back off on the cloth sims and on the animations and on the getting every

113
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:39,875
lock of hair exactly perfect.

114
00:05:40,522 --> 00:05:43,183
We will never be able to do as good with, for example,

115
00:05:43,283 --> 00:05:46,985
our avatar art as the guys who are only drawing two avatars.

116
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:51,267
We will never do as good as the guys doing environments

117
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:53,868
when they only have to design an environment

118
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:55,209
the size of a pizza hut, and we're

119
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:58,050
trying to make an entire continent run in our engine.

120
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,931
We have to arrest our selling proposition.

121
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:05,493
So how do people who solo, people who play by themselves,

122
00:06:06,014 --> 00:06:07,654
people who are loners fit into this?

123
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:09,495
So.

124
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:12,789
It's worth just thinking about.

125
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:14,490
And I think it's worth thinking about what

126
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,271
we could consider one of the original massively multiplayer

127
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,832
environments, which is the city.

128
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:24,653
It's in New York City, one of the largest cities in the world.

129
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:28,175
And it's got, I don't know how many.

130
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:30,836
I probably should have done the research.

131
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:32,036
9, 12 million, whatever.

132
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:33,317
It's got a lot of people in there.

133
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:36,778
The fascinating thing about New York City

134
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:38,138
is that even though it is.

135
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:41,548
definitely a place that is bustling with humanity.

136
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,790
There are a couple of things that we should notice as we think about

137
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,192
loaners inside of massive multiplayer spaces.

138
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:53,798
The first is that oddly enough, Manhattan has the largest percentage

139
00:06:53,898 --> 00:06:57,781
of single individual dwellings of any city in the world.

140
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:03,125
That's Manhattan rent prices, guys.

141
00:07:04,346 --> 00:07:04,526
Right?

142
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:06,708
They are paying a lot of money to live by themselves.

143
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:11,405
a lot of people are choosing to live in New York City and still be solo.

144
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:18,391
The other thing that's interesting about the big cities is that, well, people who are strangers

145
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:24,297
coming into these cities find them alienating, find them overwhelming, find it hard for them

146
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:25,778
to get a handle on what's going on.

147
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:32,645
And so the thing to think about is, and this is a Mark Twain quote from some years ago.

148
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:39,029
A domed and steepled solitude where the stranger is lonely in the midst of a million of his race.

149
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:46,032
This Mark Twain guy said this like a hundred years ago before skyscrapers and taxi cabs

150
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:49,674
and all of the stuff that makes New York City what it is today.

151
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:52,316
Even then it was seen as an alien hostile place.

152
00:07:54,237 --> 00:07:58,419
And we have this sort of mentality and I think it's sort of funneled by TV where if you watch

153
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:01,500
say CSI New York you think that New York City is a death trap, right?

154
00:08:03,638 --> 00:08:05,819
you think that is a scary and alien place,

155
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,420
where there aren't communities.

156
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,040
And sort of the myth of America,

157
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,021
real America versus fake America or something like that,

158
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:15,702
is that people who live in the country

159
00:08:15,782 --> 00:08:17,323
are more social and more civic minded.

160
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,023
But sociologists have found that's actually not true.

161
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:23,064
They've actually found that people who live inside of cities

162
00:08:23,124 --> 00:08:24,145
tend to be more social.

163
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:26,145
They tend to be more civic minded.

164
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:28,546
They tend to have stronger social friends

165
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:29,606
and they tend to be less likely

166
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:30,947
to describe themselves as the country.

167
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:34,836
and part of this reason is because inside of the uh... the cities

168
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:36,697
is easier for them to find

169
00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:40,439
other people that share their belief systems it's it's easier for them to

170
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,260
find groups from the belong to new york city is full of

171
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,402
thousands and thousands of little circle social circles whereas you know podunk

172
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:50,444
usa may only have one or two and if you don't fit in

173
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:51,544
you don't fit in

174
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:55,026
so anyway i was a fun digression

175
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:58,688
let's go back to uh... our loaners and talk about

176
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,269
uh... how they need to fit into our social games

177
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,989
One of the things I want to keep in mind is that a lot of people

178
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:07,509
see loners, people playing by themselves

179
00:09:07,609 --> 00:09:09,930
inside of a massive multiplayer games as an aberration.

180
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,070
But it's really not.

181
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,751
There are a lot of different reasons

182
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:16,232
why people are playing alone inside of your social space.

183
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:18,932
Some of these are actually healthy reasons.

184
00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:20,193
People are choosing to play that way.

185
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,533
Some of these are broken design states

186
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:24,594
that designers need to be taking more seriously.

187
00:09:24,974 --> 00:09:27,034
And each of these have different design challenges

188
00:09:27,054 --> 00:09:28,015
that they're going to present to you.

189
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,112
So what I did is I helpfully made the list of 10 different kinds of loaners.

190
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:39,315
Every time I see this slide, I initially think I wrote 10 different kinds of losers,

191
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:41,356
but that's not what I wrote.

192
00:09:42,257 --> 00:09:43,478
Because loaners are not losers.

193
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:46,439
A lot of these people are loaners for good reasons, for valid reasons,

194
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,280
and sometimes unfortunate reasons you need to fix,

195
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,702
but sometimes because they're happier that way.

196
00:09:53,022 --> 00:09:55,143
You know, the one that we spend the most time talking about...

197
00:09:57,114 --> 00:09:59,655
is the person who logged in for the first time.

198
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:03,615
This is the person who's just bought your game,

199
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:06,036
has just come into the space, knows nothing about anything,

200
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:07,296
doesn't know the social conventions,

201
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:09,357
doesn't have any friends, doesn't

202
00:10:09,397 --> 00:10:11,837
have any clue what's going on, doesn't even know where fun is.

203
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:14,498
And as you may know, we spent a ton of time

204
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:17,478
trying to figure out how to get them into the game,

205
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:20,719
into a social circle, because the theory is once they're

206
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:21,859
into a social circle, they're going

207
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,980
to be more invested, more interested in what's going on.

208
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,520
Now, a lot of times our tabula rasa player.

209
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:30,713
is going to be, he's going to have come in with friends,

210
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:33,314
but that friend might have washed out, right?

211
00:10:33,514 --> 00:10:35,115
He came in with a friend, but that friend,

212
00:10:36,495 --> 00:10:37,516
the game wasn't for him.

213
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:39,796
Or that friend isn't getting on for another two days

214
00:10:39,876 --> 00:10:41,977
because the pre-order is backed up.

215
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:44,378
Or that friend logged into a different server by mistake.

216
00:10:44,738 --> 00:10:47,359
And this guy is riding solo until that comes along.

217
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,721
Now, our first instinct as game designers,

218
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:53,142
especially the more social engineering types,

219
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:55,422
is to try to jam these people with other people

220
00:10:55,482 --> 00:10:56,423
as quickly as possible.

221
00:10:57,226 --> 00:10:58,347
There are some pitfalls to that.

222
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:03,029
One is overstimulation.

223
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:05,271
You have to be really, really wary of this.

224
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:10,774
So a lot of people, MMOs are incredibly complicated things.

225
00:11:10,814 --> 00:11:16,537
I mean, the interfaces on even our simple ones are incredibly labyrinthine.

226
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:20,920
As a result of it, it's really hard for people to learn how to play these games.

227
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,941
And some people really do not like to learn.

228
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:28,375
to interact with other people until they've actually figured out what's going on, how

229
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:32,677
their class works, how their GUI works, how to get out of town, things like that.

230
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:39,460
And so if you think back to Asheron's Call back in the day, they had a fealty system

231
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:45,022
where basically the high level players would get an experience bonus for every experience

232
00:11:45,062 --> 00:11:49,705
point that a low level player earned if that low level player had declared fealty to them.

233
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:54,134
and the end result was that higher level players would basically camp Newby Town

234
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:56,736
and recruit low level players as soon as they came in the door.

235
00:11:57,056 --> 00:12:00,698
Of course, what this was to low level players was an instantaneous sales pitch

236
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:01,979
of, hey, come in,

237
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,822
sign up for me, you know me, I want you to sign up for me, right?

238
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:12,506
A lot of people, and Sherry Granere, who is one of the experts on women

239
00:12:12,686 --> 00:12:14,387
in game design, points out that's a lot of

240
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:16,208
women players in particular.

241
00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:20,246
uh... don't like to learn with any social pressure they want actually to

242
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:20,786
be able to

243
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:25,167
get a handle on the game before having this kind of pressure put on them

244
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:28,348
uh... to prove that they're good to prove that they're wrong proof they have

245
00:12:28,408 --> 00:12:28,728
skills

246
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:31,069
they would actually rather learn in a vacuum

247
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:35,110
uh... and then uh... sort of once they're ready to join a social group

248
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,550
once they feel they have their footing

249
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,951
then actually start looking for the social circles

250
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:41,772
and so is you that you as the designer you want to encourage them to get in the

251
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:44,252
social circles but you have to also leave them some space

252
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,431
so that they can actually get a handle on things.

253
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:54,274
One of the corollaries of the New Kid in Town problem is the

254
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:55,034
Hollow Earth problem.

255
00:12:55,054 --> 00:12:57,896
This is an old MUD term, which describes what happens in our

256
00:12:58,316 --> 00:13:00,277
class and level-based MMOs.

257
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:03,538
When you have a game where there's a content progression,

258
00:13:03,578 --> 00:13:06,420
and you do level 1 to 10 content, and then you're done

259
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,701
with that zone, you go to 10 and 20 content, and then you're

260
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,962
done with that zone, what happens is that people who

261
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:12,162
come in late to the game.

262
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:16,437
are going to find, even if they want people to group with,

263
00:13:16,477 --> 00:13:17,998
they might find that there aren't any there.

264
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,240
As an example, if you log into Cataclysm today

265
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,202
in World of Warcraft and start up a Worgen or a,

266
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:27,123
what was the other one, a Goblin today,

267
00:13:27,504 --> 00:13:29,885
you're gonna find that Newby Town in those areas

268
00:13:29,945 --> 00:13:33,387
is a lot less crowded than it was in November and December

269
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:36,309
when that game, when the expansion pack actually launched.

270
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,150
Most of those people have sort of graduated

271
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,331
to the higher level content,

272
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:41,612
and if you crave that social interactivity,

273
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,022
uh... it's just not there to be had and this is over design problem that all

274
00:13:46,062 --> 00:13:47,002
these level based games

275
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:48,403
uh... have to have

276
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:53,326
and even if you do get to max level you might find that

277
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:57,128
the end game has gotten incredibly cliquish even if you want to get into a

278
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,869
social circle

279
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:01,811
it's very hard for you to do so because you have to basically earned other uh...

280
00:14:02,432 --> 00:14:06,975
uh... you have to earn your spot in a guild and and and earn uh... prove that

281
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:07,915
you earn a spot

282
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:11,177
in the raid in the battleground in the arena fight in the uh...

283
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:14,563
the strike force for your territorial control game.

284
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:18,745
And it may be that those spots are very limited and hard to actually come by.

285
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,190
The second group is probably the group that I'm most like.

286
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:31,153
They basically see other people as a tragedy, right?

287
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:32,794
They see them as like a joke.

288
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:37,657
For them, they wouldn't want to group with anybody in the barrens, but they think they're

289
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,538
good clean fun anyway, right?

290
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,062
These are the people who like to slow down for car crashes.

291
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:44,845
This is probably my category as well.

292
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:48,848
They see other people as content.

293
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:51,670
And one of the things I want to stress

294
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:56,174
is this is way more pervasive than most people casually

295
00:14:56,234 --> 00:14:56,814
think it is.

296
00:14:58,015 --> 00:15:01,078
So very recently, a media studies group did a study

297
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:05,942
and found that 90% of the readers on most mailing lists

298
00:15:06,082 --> 00:15:08,925
and message boards never post.

299
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:11,235
Right?

300
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:14,217
They go to the message boards, and they read things on the message boards,

301
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:15,298
and they never bother to post.

302
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,000
And some of them still log in daily.

303
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,823
It's just that they're just absorbing the content that other people bring

304
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:21,363
to the table.

305
00:15:21,744 --> 00:15:24,046
They find the value in actually watching this,

306
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:27,168
but they don't necessarily feel they have to post in order to get

307
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,830
the value outside of this community.

308
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,751
And I want to stress, this is not new.

309
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:34,294
These numbers were also being thrown around back in the Usenet days

310
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,376
when all the alt groups were around.

311
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:42,166
And if these people find value in lurking,

312
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:43,527
who are we to tell them they're wrong?

313
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:51,152
But the thing about the concept of other people are content

314
00:15:51,293 --> 00:15:54,495
is that it really puts an onus on you as the designer

315
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:58,157
to be sure that you have a social critical mass,

316
00:15:58,197 --> 00:16:00,999
that you be sure that the space feels full and crowded

317
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:01,540
and interesting.

318
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,542
So this is how casinos used to be designed.

319
00:16:05,622 --> 00:16:08,044
The trend of how to design casinos.

320
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:11,396
was to make them bigger, more grandiose, more palatial,

321
00:16:11,577 --> 00:16:12,617
with the high ceilings.

322
00:16:12,657 --> 00:16:15,460
And we want this to be a temple of opulence.

323
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,222
And this is the Aladdin, I believe.

324
00:16:18,923 --> 00:16:21,064
You can't go there anymore because it failed

325
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:22,465
and has been destroyed.

326
00:16:24,947 --> 00:16:28,030
This guy, his name is Bill Friedman.

327
00:16:28,891 --> 00:16:32,634
He is a famed maverick casino designer.

328
00:16:33,855 --> 00:16:35,116
And he basically did some research

329
00:16:35,176 --> 00:16:36,657
and found that a whole bunch of people

330
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:37,818
would stay at the Aladdin.

331
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,112
and then go gamble someplace else.

332
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:44,095
And what he found was that the reason why

333
00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:47,397
is that these are very lonely and desperate places to gamble.

334
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:50,760
And if you think about playing a slot machine for hours on end,

335
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:52,601
it is a grind.

336
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:55,844
It is a lonely, soul-sucking experience.

337
00:16:58,246 --> 00:17:00,768
However, if you play it in a room like this,

338
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:05,611
where the ceilings are low and the areas have alcoves that

339
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:06,792
sort of keep people together.

340
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:09,658
there is always content going on around you.

341
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,440
Right? You always feel like there's something going on around you.

342
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,781
And while you're hitting that button on that slot machine,

343
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,962
you know, you're going to see people winning over there.

344
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:20,343
There's always going to be the sound of somebody winning around you.

345
00:17:20,363 --> 00:17:22,444
There's going to be people fighting or getting drunk or,

346
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:25,745
you know, there's going to be like cute waitresses nearby.

347
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:29,207
There's always something going on when you get more people closer together.

348
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:32,428
And this is true of any social space. For example.

349
00:17:33,989 --> 00:17:38,693
If I was having this talk right now in a room that only had 50 chairs, this would feel like

350
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:42,617
a very cozy and dynamic and standing room only talk.

351
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:48,341
But instead, we're having it in this very, very large room, and you guys are all feeling

352
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:50,784
sorry for me for being the last talk of GDC.

353
00:17:53,286 --> 00:17:56,228
And that's okay if we're just giving talk, if we're teaching classes.

354
00:17:56,248 --> 00:18:00,692
But if you are in the business of, for example, running a club, running a bar.

355
00:18:01,418 --> 00:18:04,021
You know, you want to prove that your space is the IT space.

356
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:06,944
And part of that is being sure that the place feels like it's hopping,

357
00:18:06,984 --> 00:18:08,425
feels like it's crowded and it's coming in.

358
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:11,889
But we don't necessarily design our MMOs for people watching.

359
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:14,951
We don't necessarily design it so that there are lots of people interacting.

360
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:18,755
We try, you know, lots of designers still think it's important to have really big,

361
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:23,059
super big worlds so that people get really spread out and those populations get diffused.

362
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,703
And that really, really fights with what the social needs of the space are.

363
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:39,109
Now, sometimes your new kid in town comes in and it's famously said that all babies

364
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:40,409
are born sociopaths.

365
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:43,110
They don't know anything about anything.

366
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,991
They don't know what's right or wrong and they have to be taught that by their parents,

367
00:18:46,031 --> 00:18:50,553
by their teacher, by their clergy, by their boy scout troop, whatever.

368
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:55,514
Much can be said the same for massively multiplayer game players.

369
00:18:55,855 --> 00:18:59,676
They come into an environment and every environment has different rules for what is right, what

370
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:00,176
is wrong.

371
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:01,357
So for example...

372
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:05,364
What's correct in Quake is different than what's correct in Ultima Online, which is

373
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:07,646
different than the social mores of World of Warcraft.

374
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:09,527
And this can even be different per server.

375
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:13,809
What's acceptable on a role-playing server is completely different than what's acceptable

376
00:19:13,949 --> 00:19:17,211
on a PvP server, and most of this is based on social convention.

377
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:23,874
Now, players have to learn these rules in order to fit in, and most people will actually

378
00:19:23,915 --> 00:19:24,335
try to.

379
00:19:24,735 --> 00:19:26,056
Sometimes they don't want to.

380
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:27,657
Sometimes they don't bother to learn.

381
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:29,958
Sometimes it's funny, right?

382
00:19:30,678 --> 00:19:30,858
So...

383
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:36,419
if you ever want to kill an entire weekend, you can go to lamebook.com and see about the

384
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:41,223
people who just do not understand what is appropriate or inappropriate to post on Facebook.

385
00:19:42,624 --> 00:19:47,928
And on Facebook, that's funny because you actually have control over your social circle.

386
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:50,751
But in MMO, you don't necessarily have control over your social circle.

387
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:51,892
It's a wide open landscape.

388
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:59,478
And as a result of this, the power shifts and the people who are sociopaths can actually

389
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:00,098
do the griefing.

390
00:20:02,142 --> 00:20:04,143
Now, Raf Koster, who's sitting right over there,

391
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,584
said this some time ago on his blog,

392
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:10,045
where he pointed out that basically the more indirect

393
00:20:10,145 --> 00:20:11,986
your communication is with the people

394
00:20:12,026 --> 00:20:14,527
that you're talking to, the more anonymous you become,

395
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:16,968
the less inhibited that you are in your social behavior.

396
00:20:17,368 --> 00:20:18,908
And he came to an interesting conclusion,

397
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:21,789
which is something for the game designer to take to heart,

398
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:24,250
which is that it may be that the right way

399
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,991
to solve griefing inside of your environment.

400
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:29,586
is to increase empathy, not necessarily punish people.

401
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:32,307
Get people to recognize that the person at the other end

402
00:20:32,347 --> 00:20:38,171
of that mud, connection wire, is actually a real person,

403
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:41,052
as opposed to a nameless, faceless person they can abuse.

404
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:44,074
And this is something that we see in real life as well.

405
00:20:44,254 --> 00:20:46,035
We have a ton of studies that talk about

406
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:48,917
how even the smallest nods can get people

407
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:51,498
to actually care more about other people

408
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:52,699
and want them to do them correctly.

409
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:54,160
You are more likely.

410
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:58,248
to be rude in traffic if you make eye contact with the guy you're about to cut off.

411
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:02,851
You're more likely to give money to a bum if he manages to catch your eye.

412
00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:08,375
That being said, some people never learn

413
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:12,058
and you should not be afraid of expelling them from your environment

414
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:16,801
if at the first sign that they prove that they cannot be salvaged.

415
00:21:19,203 --> 00:21:20,343
So on to loaner type four.

416
00:21:23,219 --> 00:21:25,901
Some people are playing under unique conditions.

417
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:28,844
Sometimes they're playing at lunch.

418
00:21:28,864 --> 00:21:29,904
They're playing at their desk.

419
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:33,487
Sometimes they're playing at home while their wife and kid

420
00:21:33,507 --> 00:21:34,668
are asleep next to their desk.

421
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:36,670
Sometimes this is the only way they play,

422
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,851
and sometimes this is only how they play some of the day.

423
00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:41,674
These people are playing under unique constraints.

424
00:21:41,754 --> 00:21:43,555
And this is a good excuse why you always

425
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:46,558
need to have some level of solo content in your game,

426
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:47,758
some stuff for these people to do.

427
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,220
These people can't commit.

428
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:54,593
to playing in a dungeon for 45 minutes because their lunch break might end then.

429
00:21:55,174 --> 00:21:59,477
If your dungeon can't be done in 45 minutes, they'd have to abandon you and leave you there.

430
00:21:59,897 --> 00:22:06,441
They might not be able to put on voice chat, for example, because they can't talk and wake up the kid,

431
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:09,484
or it's just too embarrassing to put on the headset while they're at the office.

432
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:12,386
So these people might want to do group content,

433
00:22:12,426 --> 00:22:15,228
they just are in a position where they cannot for some part of their day,

434
00:22:15,288 --> 00:22:16,468
but they still want to play their game.

435
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:20,045
It behooves you as the designer to give them the social content

436
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:23,526
that they need, or the solo content that they need and want

437
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:27,468
so that they can play when they have the availability to do so.

438
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,450
Good news.

439
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,611
We're hitting the mass market.

440
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,032
And we're hitting the mass market in a big way.

441
00:22:40,885 --> 00:22:45,626
The bad news is that means, that does not mean that we get to stop making games for

442
00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:49,507
pimply-faced nerds and other people that just want to keep to themselves.

443
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:56,088
If you get the mass market, well, depending on what study you choose to believe, between

444
00:22:56,128 --> 00:22:59,949
25 and 50 percent of the general population is considered introverts.

445
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:04,830
You're still going to be getting a whole lot of people who would prefer to keep to themselves

446
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,630
or even if they do want to group up with other people.

447
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,323
would rather not be the ones who initiate the contact, for whom talking to the pretty

448
00:23:12,343 --> 00:23:16,245
girl at the end of the bar is scary and terrifying to them, right?

449
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:21,669
And in fact, despite the fact that playing video games is bigger than it has ever been

450
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:27,753
in the history of time, according to the Center for Disease Control, and yes, the fact that

451
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:31,675
the CDC is doing studies on gaming should tell you what the government thinks about

452
00:23:31,715 --> 00:23:36,378
our industry in general, studies of the CDC have shown that

453
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:39,245
gamers are still more likely to be introverted.

454
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:40,846
Right?

455
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:42,986
And there are some dangers.

456
00:23:43,026 --> 00:23:44,426
They've also, like other studies,

457
00:23:44,446 --> 00:23:46,987
have shown that introverts are more likely to be depressed

458
00:23:47,027 --> 00:23:49,407
and more likely to have social problems, clearly.

459
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:52,928
But they also found that the people who play these games

460
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:58,369
actually see video games, online video games, MMOs,

461
00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:01,810
social games, as a way of getting the social food

462
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,850
that they need, the social play that they need.

463
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,770
They see it as sort of a.

464
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:07,728
a surrogate for social interactions inside the real world.

465
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:10,629
For them, it's easier to have these interactions inside the game.

466
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:12,770
And that's okay.

467
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,451
In that respect, we're actually doing a service to these people.

468
00:24:16,751 --> 00:24:20,793
But at the same time, we have to keep in mind what our mechanics are forcing these people

469
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:21,213
to do.

470
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:26,516
Even if I'm an introvert inside of your game space, that does not mean I want to go out

471
00:24:26,536 --> 00:24:27,176
and recruit people.

472
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:28,036
Don't make me.

473
00:24:29,197 --> 00:24:34,319
I do not want to ask 30 strangers if they want to help me kill something in Vampire

474
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:34,659
Wars.

475
00:24:35,152 --> 00:24:39,076
Why? I'm an introvert. I don't like asking people for anything.

476
00:24:44,981 --> 00:24:48,184
There are people that like to do that. There are people that like to reach out and you

477
00:24:48,204 --> 00:24:52,829
can actually give them a lot of the impetus, a lot of the push, a lot of the control in

478
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:57,053
actually doing things like building groups, running the dungeons. Give extroverts the

479
00:24:57,093 --> 00:24:59,735
tools to do so and allow the introverts to pass off.

480
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:04,470
the control over these responsibilities to the extroverts, and the extroverts will have

481
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,372
fun doing it, and the introverts will be relieved they don't have to.

482
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:14,518
Even little things, like if I'm an introvert and I want to find a guild, give me a way

483
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:15,879
to advertise passively.

484
00:25:16,219 --> 00:25:20,562
Give me a way that I can reach out to people in a way that it doesn't feel like I'm rejected

485
00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:21,483
if I don't succeed.

486
00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:28,648
Now, this is an interesting design challenge.

487
00:25:29,591 --> 00:25:31,412
All the time inside of our social spaces,

488
00:25:32,193 --> 00:25:33,974
our social circles disintegrate.

489
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:38,377
This might be that the friend that you play with all the time

490
00:25:38,658 --> 00:25:40,199
has decided to stop playing the game,

491
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:43,161
or your guild has just collapsed because of guild drama

492
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:43,841
or something else.

493
00:25:44,162 --> 00:25:45,743
And suddenly, you had a social circle,

494
00:25:46,263 --> 00:25:47,584
and it used to do social things.

495
00:25:47,604 --> 00:25:48,465
You used to do the raids.

496
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:49,385
You used to do the dungeons.

497
00:25:49,405 --> 00:25:51,047
You used to do the territorial control.

498
00:25:51,387 --> 00:25:54,849
And that entire social structure has utterly disappeared.

499
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,951
This is a broken game state.

500
00:25:58,717 --> 00:26:04,361
and if you think about it like this guy has just gotten dumped by his social circle

501
00:26:06,122 --> 00:26:10,045
and you think about all the emotions that you had going on inside of you the last time you got dumped

502
00:26:10,805 --> 00:26:14,107
you can understand that this is scary and what is your job as the game designer?

503
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:19,551
Your job as a game designer is to set up the rebound relationship as fast as you freaking can

504
00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:21,692
and get them back and play the game that you want to

505
00:26:22,052 --> 00:26:24,454
because these people don't necessarily want to play your solo game

506
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:27,656
they're happy playing the raid game, they're happy playing the territorial control

507
00:26:27,972 --> 00:26:29,594
before that was all jerked out from under them.

508
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,562
One of the things that our games don't do well enough is

509
00:26:39,982 --> 00:26:41,704
have redundant social groups.

510
00:26:42,384 --> 00:26:45,407
So sociologists in the field of social networking

511
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:49,390
have this concept of weak ties and strong ties. And if you think about your

512
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,011
real life,

513
00:26:50,972 --> 00:26:54,915
your life is primarily defined by your strong ties. This is your wife,

514
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:55,896
your kids, your parents.

515
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,412
the people you go to work with every day.

516
00:26:59,012 --> 00:27:01,114
If you go to church, it might be the people that you see at church.

517
00:27:01,575 --> 00:27:04,297
And your weak ties are your more distant relationships, right?

518
00:27:05,258 --> 00:27:08,161
These are the guy that you worked with three jobs ago

519
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:09,642
and the kid that you went to high school with.

520
00:27:10,043 --> 00:27:13,766
Facebook, if you think about it, is primarily a way of collecting these weak ties.

521
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:16,749
What sociologists found is that, you know,

522
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:20,212
strong ties sort of govern our day-to-day lives and our day-to-day interactions.

523
00:27:20,652 --> 00:27:23,095
Weak lives is what we turn to when chaos strikes.

524
00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:27,616
When you lose your job and all of your co-workers are also now scrambling and finding your jobs,

525
00:27:27,976 --> 00:27:30,837
that's when you're going to go to the guy that you went to high school with.

526
00:27:30,877 --> 00:27:33,538
That's when you're going to go to the guy you worked with two jobs ago

527
00:27:33,898 --> 00:27:35,819
and see if he has any leads on another job.

528
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:39,921
That's sort of, these weak ties act as sort of a social safety net

529
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:43,842
for individuals that allow them to actually get into the next thing.

530
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:46,864
MMOs aren't designed that way.

531
00:27:46,944 --> 00:27:49,145
We generally encourage people to...

532
00:27:49,764 --> 00:27:51,805
get into a guild as soon as possible,

533
00:27:51,825 --> 00:27:53,585
and then these guilds become very solid,

534
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:55,146
and they become very insular.

535
00:27:55,746 --> 00:27:57,727
And they don't interact with other guilds very often.

536
00:27:57,767 --> 00:28:00,128
In fact, very often there's intense competition

537
00:28:00,168 --> 00:28:00,908
between the guilds.

538
00:28:01,188 --> 00:28:02,488
And so when that guild dissolves,

539
00:28:03,189 --> 00:28:06,330
it becomes something of a nightmare situation,

540
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,850
and there's a very real risk

541
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,271
that players wash out of the game.

542
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:11,371
I don't have the answer for this,

543
00:28:11,411 --> 00:28:12,572
but this seems like a great place

544
00:28:12,592 --> 00:28:14,632
for an enterprising designer to find a solution

545
00:28:14,853 --> 00:28:15,653
that we can all steal.

546
00:28:24,284 --> 00:28:30,629
Now your kid who just got off the bus, he gets all the way to level 50, he's maxed out,

547
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,572
he's there because he's heard about your unique selling position, he's heard about the territorial

548
00:28:34,592 --> 00:28:38,496
control and the raiding and the battlegrounds and all the stuff that's in game, he really

549
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:39,577
wants to be in an arena team.

550
00:28:40,377 --> 00:28:43,600
But he's got this problem, he doesn't know if he's good enough.

551
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,582
And very often he may be right, right?

552
00:28:46,922 --> 00:28:48,063
A lot of these games are hard.

553
00:28:48,699 --> 00:28:51,321
And in-game is really hard on purpose,

554
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:52,802
because we're trying to create challenges that

555
00:28:52,822 --> 00:28:54,824
can keep you coming back over and over again,

556
00:28:54,884 --> 00:28:58,506
keep you engaged, and actually be a challenge.

557
00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:01,509
But that also means that it can be very hard, again,

558
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:02,890
to get into that mean girls clique,

559
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,731
to actually get into a social circle

560
00:29:04,751 --> 00:29:06,492
where you can actually prove that you belong

561
00:29:06,752 --> 00:29:07,853
and where you can be a contributor.

562
00:29:10,335 --> 00:29:13,598
Jonathan Baron famously described it as glory and shame.

563
00:29:13,858 --> 00:29:15,459
We have Tom Cruise representing glory.

564
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:18,161
We have Bill Buckner representing shame.

565
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:20,286
uh... i'm a red sox fan

566
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:21,167
uh...

567
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:26,528
what john said is that glory is the reason why people play the most they

568
00:29:26,568 --> 00:29:29,749
want to be the guy that plants the flag on top of the tower they want to be the

569
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:33,090
guy that lands that final death blow when they're only three eyes left in the

570
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:33,350
raid

571
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,410
that's what they envision their head

572
00:29:35,711 --> 00:29:38,991
and shame is the reason why they don't they're afraid of letting everybody down

573
00:29:39,852 --> 00:29:41,732
right there afraid of being the person

574
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:45,613
uh... who waste half an hour of everybody's lives because they just

575
00:29:45,633 --> 00:29:46,653
couldn't get the job done

576
00:29:47,484 --> 00:29:52,888
And very often it's because they don't understand that there might be low impact roles that

577
00:29:52,908 --> 00:29:53,548
they can take.

578
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:58,972
And one of the things that John Baron did in his game, which was a long time ago, it

579
00:29:58,992 --> 00:30:02,915
was called BattleTech, was they basically had cannon fodder roles.

580
00:30:04,216 --> 00:30:09,480
The idea was you needed a stream of newbies for whatever their game design was that you

581
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,242
would send out on the battlefield and you would tell them, yeah, you're going to go

582
00:30:12,282 --> 00:30:14,884
out there, you're going to really far, you're going to take a few pot shots, then you're

583
00:30:14,904 --> 00:30:15,344
going to die.

584
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,276
It's OK.

585
00:30:16,296 --> 00:30:16,876
You want to come back.

586
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:18,197
You want to go out there and do it again.

587
00:30:18,757 --> 00:30:21,458
And these low-level, low-skill players could come in,

588
00:30:21,518 --> 00:30:23,099
feel like they're contributing immediately

589
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:26,241
to this in-game activity, and gain some comfort

590
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:28,422
with the social structure, gain some comfort with the GUI,

591
00:30:28,442 --> 00:30:30,563
gain some comfort and understanding of what

592
00:30:30,903 --> 00:30:33,965
is going on at all around them, and gradually work their way

593
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:37,766
up the hierarchy of whatever they had, guilds or clans

594
00:30:37,807 --> 00:30:38,427
or whatever it was.

595
00:30:40,028 --> 00:30:41,909
Finding ways so that players can actually

596
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:48,874
contribute to a guild in a way that is not going to induce shame is, I think, something

597
00:30:48,894 --> 00:30:54,276
that is very important to getting people who don't want to be loners into a social circle.

598
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:59,299
And you know, one of those things to keep in mind is to keep in mind how hard it is

599
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:02,980
to actually learn how to play some of these roles.

600
00:31:04,341 --> 00:31:06,922
Who here has ever played a tank?

601
00:31:08,983 --> 00:31:09,383
A tank.

602
00:31:09,704 --> 00:31:10,844
And inside of Massive…

603
00:31:10,904 --> 00:31:11,845
In WoW or in…

604
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,424
It's hard, isn't it?

605
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:16,106
And it's a binary switch.

606
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:17,747
You either know how to do it or you don't.

607
00:31:17,847 --> 00:31:20,128
And when you don't, there is a lot of death,

608
00:31:20,268 --> 00:31:22,329
and there is a lot of carnage, and there

609
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:24,931
is a lot of people who are really, really mad at you

610
00:31:24,991 --> 00:31:26,932
because you suck and you're terrible.

611
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:28,253
Right?

612
00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:33,856
You learning how to tank is asking four other people

613
00:31:34,156 --> 00:31:36,317
to die over and over and over again

614
00:31:36,377 --> 00:31:37,818
until you can figure this shit out.

615
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,420
That is an enormous social pressure.

616
00:31:42,076 --> 00:31:48,020
And it's an incredible barrier for getting good tanks inside of your Trinity-based role-playing game.

617
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,964
Some people just want to play by themselves.

618
00:31:54,584 --> 00:31:55,305
And not all the time.

619
00:31:56,365 --> 00:31:59,367
I actually used to play Star Wars Galaxies. I was a Master Crafter.

620
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:04,371
My biggest pet peeve for that game was that I couldn't stop...

621
00:32:05,371 --> 00:32:08,513
I couldn't log into my account without people bugging me for pants.

622
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:15,465
As soon as I logged in, they would see me come in, and it would just be an endless span

623
00:32:15,505 --> 00:32:19,626
of tells, why haven't I made you your pants yet?

624
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:22,467
It was very, very frustrating.

625
00:32:23,047 --> 00:32:26,748
Some people just want to get away from their responsibilities, even their online responsibilities,

626
00:32:26,768 --> 00:32:29,149
but they still want to play this game.

627
00:32:31,069 --> 00:32:31,729
And that's okay.

628
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:39,071
Being by yourself from time to time, even in little bite-sized chunks, can be very,

629
00:32:39,111 --> 00:32:39,612
very healthy.

630
00:32:39,975 --> 00:32:44,917
There's been some research done that found that some people prefer having a commute to

631
00:32:44,957 --> 00:32:45,817
not having a commute.

632
00:32:47,937 --> 00:32:48,858
That's crazy, right?

633
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:54,879
Well, now if you think about it, that's 20 minutes that you have that you aren't being

634
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:57,960
bothered by your boss, you aren't being bothered by your wife, you aren't being bothered by

635
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,541
your job responsibilities, you aren't, you know, being bothered by your kid.

636
00:33:01,961 --> 00:33:05,022
It is that small period of alone time that you have that you can...

637
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:09,402
laugh or cry or crank ACDC on the radio or pick your nose or whatever the hell it is

638
00:33:09,422 --> 00:33:10,943
you like to do when you're by yourself.

639
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:20,351
And so giving people a way to play along, giving people a way to escape, to jump to

640
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:21,993
alts, to do other things

641
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:25,355
is something I think is actually very valuable and something I think that

642
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:25,636
people

643
00:33:26,156 --> 00:33:28,118
sometimes understate the value of.

644
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:35,220
And some people are loners because, well, they think that other people are idiots.

645
00:33:37,361 --> 00:33:42,784
I admit being somewhat sympathetic to this point of view, but these people, they may

646
00:33:42,824 --> 00:33:46,325
even like the idea of taking part in the raids, but they, oh, geez.

647
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:47,926
I was in a raid once.

648
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:51,948
It took us 45 minutes to actually get everybody in the same place and get started and get

649
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:52,749
going and whatnot.

650
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:59,156
If these people, this is a possibly slightly broken player state.

651
00:33:59,556 --> 00:34:02,617
If they want to raid, you want to get them in there, and you need to find ways to knock

652
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:05,198
down these social barriers so that they can actually get into the game.

653
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:14,542
A lot of these people have been scared off by guild drama.

654
00:34:14,562 --> 00:34:18,063
A lot of these people have been scared off by incompatible guilds.

655
00:34:20,344 --> 00:34:23,585
Somebody once described being in a rock band as...

656
00:34:24,386 --> 00:34:32,868
like being married to four other people. Being in a raiding guild is having, is like being

657
00:34:32,908 --> 00:34:40,389
married to about 40 other people. And it only takes, you know, finding your way into a bad

658
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:45,550
guild to sort of color your relationship for the whole game, right? If you find yourself

659
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,331
into the, uh, leetspeakcooldude guild.

660
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:57,165
Your idea of what that game is going to be is going to be entirely different than if you actually stumble into the guild that likes to quote Shakespeare.

661
00:34:57,285 --> 00:34:58,485
And yes, I have found that guild.

662
00:34:58,545 --> 00:34:59,686
And it was weird.

663
00:35:04,027 --> 00:35:08,749
So actually finding, you know, you can never make guild drama go away.

664
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:17,152
But one of the things you can do is do what you can in order to help people find compatible guilds, find guilds of people like them, find servers of people like them.

665
00:35:17,772 --> 00:35:18,532
Right. So.

666
00:35:19,561 --> 00:35:24,262
Back in Ultima Online, one of the things that they had was they had a guild full of people

667
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:30,683
who liked to play elves, which pissed off the people who were also role-playing, who

668
00:35:30,723 --> 00:35:33,984
believed very firmly that elves did not belong in the Ultima universe.

669
00:35:34,824 --> 00:35:38,725
But these people who played elves all found themselves and they went off and played by

670
00:35:38,765 --> 00:35:42,146
themselves and that's actually part of the magic of the internet, is that it's easy for

671
00:35:42,186 --> 00:35:43,846
like-minded people to find each other.

672
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:49,240
And our games, with all of our server divisions,

673
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,801
often put in arbitrary barriers that

674
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:54,102
make it too hard for you to find the right circle of friends.

675
00:35:56,243 --> 00:35:58,183
Your game is infinitely stickier if you can

676
00:35:58,203 --> 00:35:59,444
get them someplace compatible.

677
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:03,506
Just a side note about voice chat.

678
00:36:05,286 --> 00:36:08,668
On the balance, voice chat is good for the social in your MMO,

679
00:36:09,348 --> 00:36:12,009
but voice chat is also a commitment.

680
00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:14,930
When you start talking, you reduce your own anonymity

681
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:15,510
to other people.

682
00:36:16,272 --> 00:36:20,654
So I've noticed when I've played raids, the people who

683
00:36:21,575 --> 00:36:26,158
refuse to turn on voice chat are very frequently the people

684
00:36:26,198 --> 00:36:27,158
who wash out of the guild.

685
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:29,900
Because it's just a way that they haven't signed into your

686
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,621
game experience.

687
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:33,923
Yeah, sometimes there are also guys pretending to be girls,

688
00:36:34,003 --> 00:36:36,404
and girls who don't want people to know that they're

689
00:36:36,424 --> 00:36:37,805
actually girls and stuff like that.

690
00:36:37,885 --> 00:36:40,747
But sort of the retention inside the guild is much

691
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:43,869
stronger once they actually commit to other people by

692
00:36:43,949 --> 00:36:44,910
turning on their microphone.

693
00:36:47,662 --> 00:36:49,783
And some people just won't play your game by themselves.

694
00:36:51,183 --> 00:36:51,943
And that's OK.

695
00:36:53,204 --> 00:36:56,325
I saw a study of World of Warcraft data.

696
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,545
Somebody had analyzed the armory and found

697
00:36:58,565 --> 00:37:01,546
that a huge percentage of players in the armory

698
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:03,987
had reached level 70.

699
00:37:05,528 --> 00:37:07,168
This was back when level 70 was max.

700
00:37:07,888 --> 00:37:13,470
But had no raid gear, no dungeon gear, and had no PVP gear on.

701
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,711
Which is to say, they went from 1 to 70 playing by themselves.

702
00:37:17,884 --> 00:37:19,665
and if that's the game that they want to play

703
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:23,506
okay

704
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:26,247
is important to remember that there's a clear difference between between being

705
00:37:26,307 --> 00:37:27,548
alone and being lonely

706
00:37:27,568 --> 00:37:32,110
and i think we all kind of we know that but one of these is a lot healthier than

707
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:32,450
the other

708
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:36,551
uh... in this book which is good

709
00:37:37,192 --> 00:37:37,272
uh...

710
00:37:38,352 --> 00:37:41,493
being lonely is actually vaguely not good for you

711
00:37:41,873 --> 00:37:42,534
right it is

712
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:45,115
been known to call psychological problems

713
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:49,914
It has been known to cause physiological problems, like high blood pressure.

714
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:55,736
On the other hand, almost any psychologist can tell you that having some alone time,

715
00:37:55,996 --> 00:38:01,198
choosing to be alone, can be actually very healthy for your mental state of being.

716
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:07,441
I found this interesting.

717
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:11,443
This is how a hotel did some research on the kind of people that play their games.

718
00:38:15,268 --> 00:38:18,071
19% of them is in a group that they classify as the loner.

719
00:38:18,952 --> 00:38:21,014
Now, I don't know if you're familiar with Habbo Hotel,

720
00:38:21,114 --> 00:38:22,855
but at the time that these metrics were done,

721
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:25,758
Habbo Hotel was a purely social game.

722
00:38:26,578 --> 00:38:27,860
There weren't any game mechanics.

723
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,920
There weren't any rats to kill.

724
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:31,383
It wasn't like that, right?

725
00:38:31,423 --> 00:38:32,684
It was a social space.

726
00:38:33,184 --> 00:38:35,766
And yet, even in this space, 19% of the population

727
00:38:36,087 --> 00:38:38,569
was just preferred to stay by themselves

728
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:39,350
and do their own thing.

729
00:38:44,437 --> 00:38:53,944
So anyway, wrapping down, one of the things I think that you should all take away is that

730
00:38:54,104 --> 00:39:01,229
even if we posit, which I think is important that we do, that the in-game stuff, the massive

731
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:05,091
stuff inside of our games is the unique selling proposition and is the stuff that we should

732
00:39:05,131 --> 00:39:08,874
polish and really deliver and really, you know, that's what we need to compete with

733
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:11,335
each other on and that's what we need to compete against the single players on.

734
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:15,397
Alone is the default state of the Massley multiplayer.

735
00:39:16,177 --> 00:39:18,999
And this is both on the macro level of the first time they

736
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:19,999
log in, they're alone.

737
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,321
And they're alone until they actually find a social circle

738
00:39:23,341 --> 00:39:23,822
to run with.

739
00:39:24,182 --> 00:39:26,803
And even once they do that, every day that they log in,

740
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:29,725
they are alone until they actually find someone to run

741
00:39:29,765 --> 00:39:31,626
their dungeon with, until they find somebody to get in a

742
00:39:31,646 --> 00:39:32,326
battleground with.

743
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:35,388
And the game needs to understand that and recognize

744
00:39:35,408 --> 00:39:38,850
that and offer them the single player gameplay, the solo

745
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,892
gameplay that can act as the backbone of their experience.

746
00:39:42,395 --> 00:39:43,776
even if they want to socialize.

747
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:47,978
Consider the bar.

748
00:39:48,498 --> 00:39:51,379
This is probably one of the oldest multiplayer environments

749
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:52,800
in human history.

750
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,081
Bars have now become incredibly sophisticated

751
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:58,422
in offering excuses for you to come to their bars

752
00:39:58,802 --> 00:40:00,143
and interact with other people.

753
00:40:00,803 --> 00:40:04,125
Speed dating, book clubs, Super Bowl watch parties.

754
00:40:04,965 --> 00:40:06,906
They don't force you to take part in these activities.

755
00:40:07,466 --> 00:40:09,467
If you want to come and watch trivia happen,

756
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:11,408
they're more than happy to take your money and serve you

757
00:40:11,448 --> 00:40:11,708
drinks.

758
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,941
But these environments are richer because of that.

759
00:40:16,021 --> 00:40:18,903
And they're hoping that you'll come in and actually find

760
00:40:18,923 --> 00:40:21,765
people and come back on a weekly basis for the trivia.

761
00:40:22,025 --> 00:40:23,786
They're hoping that you find a social clique that you want

762
00:40:23,806 --> 00:40:24,947
to associate with that bar.

763
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,811
We build little communities.

764
00:40:32,712 --> 00:40:34,073
And it's very important that we do that.

765
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:36,494
We're trying to create strong social ties.

766
00:40:36,514 --> 00:40:39,496
We're trying to find the extroverts and the evangelists

767
00:40:39,516 --> 00:40:40,957
that can actually encourage people to come

768
00:40:40,977 --> 00:40:41,798
into this game space.

769
00:40:42,218 --> 00:40:44,799
We want our gameplay to be richer because other people are there.

770
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:50,240
But one of the things that we have to acknowledge as Massive Multiplayer Designers is that our

771
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,301
magic, our secret sauce, this stuff, the raids, this is hardcore stuff.

772
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:56,121
This is hardcore gameplay.

773
00:40:56,801 --> 00:41:01,862
Even a basic raid is incredibly hard for players to grasp and get comfortable with.

774
00:41:02,582 --> 00:41:06,023
You know, this gameplay in EVE is hardcore gameplay.

775
00:41:06,443 --> 00:41:08,423
You have to figure out how to get the solo player.

776
00:41:08,874 --> 00:41:11,496
in a position where they want to take part in this, where they feel comfortable with

777
00:41:11,516 --> 00:41:13,777
the social circles, where they feel like they can be contributors.

778
00:41:16,399 --> 00:41:20,823
You know, this, crazy hardcore, and man, I hope you have a good machine to run most of

779
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:27,028
these games, because, you know, it is an entirely different game than what you're going to learn

780
00:41:27,048 --> 00:41:27,828
when you play Solo.

781
00:41:28,629 --> 00:41:29,349
And that's okay.

782
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,752
You just have to figure out how to walk people to the conclusion that playing these games

783
00:41:32,812 --> 00:41:33,293
is okay.

784
00:41:34,634 --> 00:41:38,397
You know, people start any game that they play as casual.

785
00:41:39,256 --> 00:41:46,502
And this is true of whether or not it's Bejeweled or Puzzle Pirates or World of Warcraft and Star Wars The Old Republic.

786
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:49,164
They start casual and uncommitted to your game space.

787
00:41:49,204 --> 00:41:51,986
And as they do, they get more and more deeper into the game.

788
00:41:52,366 --> 00:41:59,792
They're going to get closer and closer to the hardcore experience and the different activities inside these games are going to be tailored more and more to these different people.

789
00:42:00,573 --> 00:42:08,839
You notice then the massive multiplayer charts that has this progression of what's going on inside the game, it becomes more and more about grouping.

790
00:42:10,013 --> 00:42:16,537
And it becomes more and more about coaxing people out of their loner shell and getting them into these higher level in-game experiences.

791
00:42:24,182 --> 00:42:25,383
But it's hard, right?

792
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:30,927
Actually getting people from casual to interested and interested to committed, and especially going down to hardcore.

793
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:36,110
You know, if hardcore is massively multiplayer game experience, you have to overcome a whole bunch of social problems.

794
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,952
You have to overcome a whole bunch of...

795
00:42:38,268 --> 00:42:41,170
you know, shyness, cliquishness, distrust, fear of commitment.

796
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:46,013
You have to overcome all of these issues to get these people to actually go down the ladder

797
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:46,753
and play those games.

798
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:48,334
And you know what?

799
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:49,996
It may be that you don't want to.

800
00:42:50,176 --> 00:42:54,198
It may be that they're happy to stay at that casual level, that interested level, and not

801
00:42:54,258 --> 00:42:55,239
go further down the ladder.

802
00:42:58,761 --> 00:43:01,243
But at the end of the day, being lonely is a problem that you have to solve.

803
00:43:01,783 --> 00:43:03,284
But not being alone, right?

804
00:43:03,685 --> 00:43:04,845
Being alone can be healthy.

805
00:43:04,865 --> 00:43:06,707
If people choose to be alone, they're not lonely.

806
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:07,567
That's okay.

807
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,060
people of all walks of life value being alone.

808
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:14,903
But if you're actually in a massive multiplayer environment,

809
00:43:15,664 --> 00:43:19,207
the irony of being lonely is inescapable.

810
00:43:20,668 --> 00:43:21,748
That's all I have for you today.

811
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:22,669
Thanks for coming out.

812
00:43:23,129 --> 00:43:25,271
And I'll take any questions you have.

813
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:34,578
Thank you.

814
00:43:34,618 --> 00:43:35,438
Any questions at all?

815
00:43:39,774 --> 00:43:41,516
There's a microphone back there, I think.

816
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,683
You were talking about the weak ties problem.

817
00:43:50,623 --> 00:43:55,688
That made me think of a system in Dark Age of Camelot where you could combine guilds into alliances,

818
00:43:56,168 --> 00:44:02,093
and a system in Final Fantasy XI where you could have multiple guilds link pearls in your inventory

819
00:44:02,133 --> 00:44:06,657
and decide whether you wanted to be in a guild or not in a guild, moment to moment.

820
00:44:06,968 --> 00:44:12,191
The guild leader could revoke your link pearl, but you could carry very many of them.

821
00:44:12,231 --> 00:44:19,514
Do you think there's a reason we've gotten away from those more complicated multi-guild connection systems?

822
00:44:20,895 --> 00:44:25,357
So the question was that there have been games that have experimented with that sort of thing,

823
00:44:25,397 --> 00:44:30,900
such as allowing people to have multiple guild affiliations, or having guilds join into alliances.

824
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,941
And is there a reason why people have gone away from them?

825
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:37,411
I think that in many cases it's because the game designs have kind of gotten away from

826
00:44:37,431 --> 00:44:39,853
them because they don't understand what's important about them.

827
00:44:40,273 --> 00:44:45,416
So Shadowbane had alliances, for example, and that provided that social safety net.

828
00:44:45,456 --> 00:44:49,919
If your guild collapsed, you would often jump to someone else in your alliances.

829
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:55,842
But you know, when you have... in Shadowbane, we didn't design the alliances for that reason.

830
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:59,605
I mean, actually, right now, I'm trying to remember if they were informal or not.

831
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:00,985
They were codified into the experience.

832
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:06,389
you know we put the alliances in because we didn't have factions the way that

833
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:08,511
for example World of Warcraft has factions

834
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:12,253
uh... and as a result of that we need to create sides

835
00:45:12,814 --> 00:45:14,235
uh... dynamically on the fly

836
00:45:15,936 --> 00:45:17,237
you know similarly uh...

837
00:45:18,037 --> 00:45:22,500
Marine 59 which I also worked on had guilds and secret societies

838
00:45:23,241 --> 00:45:23,481
right

839
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:24,722
uh... and

840
00:45:25,903 --> 00:45:28,044
I put it in specifically for this reason

841
00:45:28,665 --> 00:45:30,566
uh... but the secret society was kind of

842
00:45:31,036 --> 00:45:34,857
weird and you could really do anything with the secret society because it wasn't a secret

843
00:45:34,897 --> 00:45:40,559
anymore and you know more to the point you know one of the things I've seen talked about

844
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:45,641
is having two guild affiliations that presents a you know really simple gooey issues like

845
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:50,762
okay how do you send tell to your second guild right you know how do you interface with both

846
00:45:50,822 --> 00:45:55,284
guilds and so I think it's a lot of how do you make it simple enough that people can

847
00:45:55,344 --> 00:45:56,024
actually understand.

848
00:45:57,518 --> 00:46:01,979
and interface with it without mucking up what is already an incredibly complicated user interface.

849
00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:03,980
Thanks.

850
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,621
Any more questions?

851
00:46:09,742 --> 00:46:10,622
We have one more question.

852
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:14,003
This may be simple, this may be not.

853
00:46:14,644 --> 00:46:18,865
EVE Online specifically has a guild or corporation history.

854
00:46:19,965 --> 00:46:22,646
Do you think something like that is more of a good thing or more of a bad thing?

855
00:46:22,686 --> 00:46:25,707
I know in EVE Online, if you're trying to, if you're...

856
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:30,265
if you've pissed off your alliance or whatever, and you didn't do it for the benefit of somebody

857
00:46:30,306 --> 00:46:35,869
else, it can be really hard to move on to somebody else's corporation or alliance because

858
00:46:35,909 --> 00:46:40,851
of those prior standings and because those are just written in stone on your character.

859
00:46:42,372 --> 00:46:51,717
I think it's a very good thing in your classic server-based MMO, because it really helps

860
00:46:51,757 --> 00:46:55,760
to address the problem of sociopaths.

861
00:46:56,851 --> 00:47:00,454
uh... you know once you realize that you'll have a black mark on your record

862
00:47:00,494 --> 00:47:02,575
for as long as you keep this character around

863
00:47:03,016 --> 00:47:04,577
people actually start to

864
00:47:04,997 --> 00:47:06,639
play nicer really fast

865
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,583
uh... the question is always is it impossible for you to hit the reset

866
00:47:11,603 --> 00:47:11,863
button

867
00:47:12,183 --> 00:47:15,286
i don't know how well it works in eve to be honest i haven't played eve very deeply

868
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:19,749
uh... but you know cautiously i'm in favor of people having a history

869
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,472
to deal with the problem of uh... sociopathy

870
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:27,110
So, not so much a question but a comment.

871
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:30,651
I think one of the issues when we start talking about soloing versus grouping,

872
00:47:31,171 --> 00:47:32,671
especially reading the blogs,

873
00:47:32,691 --> 00:47:35,532
you know, there tends to be people that fall into each category.

874
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:39,273
One of the big issues about people who like to group is, you know,

875
00:47:39,293 --> 00:47:43,013
they feel like the pendulum has kind of swung toward the soloers.

876
00:47:43,573 --> 00:47:45,894
I know personally in one game I play with my girlfriend,

877
00:47:46,334 --> 00:47:49,435
it annoys me to no end when I go do the signature quest and,

878
00:47:49,595 --> 00:47:51,415
oh, no, sorry, it's solo only.

879
00:47:51,855 --> 00:47:53,035
You have to break your group.

880
00:47:53,507 --> 00:47:57,388
And I think, you know, that's one of the things that a lot of people who like to group find annoying,

881
00:47:57,428 --> 00:48:01,989
where, you know, our games kind of really so much cater to the solo that it becomes,

882
00:48:02,189 --> 00:48:04,310
well, the default assumption is obviously people are going to solo.

883
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:08,951
So, especially when we want to tell a story, we're going to do the feature quest that, you know,

884
00:48:08,971 --> 00:48:10,051
we have to go through solo.

885
00:48:10,411 --> 00:48:13,292
And especially if you've built a character where I'm going to, you know,

886
00:48:13,612 --> 00:48:15,653
especially when I play my girlfriend, I'm always going to be playing with her.

887
00:48:15,933 --> 00:48:19,674
So I build a character so that we kind of build our strengths and weaknesses together.

888
00:48:20,074 --> 00:48:21,394
Now, all of a sudden, we have to separate.

889
00:48:21,534 --> 00:48:22,355
Now we feel like, you know.

890
00:48:22,891 --> 00:48:24,492
incomplete and it gets really frustrating.

891
00:48:26,213 --> 00:48:28,395
So the answer I would give to that is that

892
00:48:30,676 --> 00:48:33,418
splitting groups is almost always bad.

893
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:37,801
You know, you don't want to force people to play solo because

894
00:48:38,361 --> 00:48:42,604
even if you ascribe to the fact that people should be able to solo most of the time,

895
00:48:42,904 --> 00:48:45,846
there is such social pressure regarding

896
00:48:46,206 --> 00:48:49,508
getting a group together, getting the group on the same step of the quest, getting the group

897
00:48:50,554 --> 00:48:54,235
uh... you know started the same time on the same step of the instance and and

898
00:48:54,295 --> 00:48:56,576
you know how everyone having the quest before they get the door

899
00:48:56,997 --> 00:49:00,138
you doing any group contents really hard so anytime you make them break off from

900
00:49:00,158 --> 00:49:00,518
each other

901
00:49:00,878 --> 00:49:04,820
you risk them getting their experiences out of sync again and you you increase

902
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,981
the chance that they won't form back together again

903
00:49:07,701 --> 00:49:07,881
uh...

904
00:49:09,062 --> 00:49:10,903
do i think that it's uh...

905
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:13,684
bad to have solo only content

906
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:16,685
uh... no i think that having solo only contents ok

907
00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:21,712
I just think you have to be wary of, if you put it on the critical path that a group might

908
00:49:21,772 --> 00:49:23,653
run into and therefore be forced to splinter.

909
00:49:24,454 --> 00:49:25,995
Some designs, it might be unavoidable.

910
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:28,417
Anybody have anything?

911
00:49:28,437 --> 00:49:29,818
We have another question.

912
00:49:30,798 --> 00:49:37,243
So, how do you feel the random dungeon finder, which basically lets you come together as

913
00:49:37,283 --> 00:49:41,266
a loner with potentially other loners that break apart, do you think it helps that or

914
00:49:41,306 --> 00:49:45,048
do you think it just makes it more okay to be a loner in the game?

915
00:49:46,146 --> 00:49:49,429
I think that it creates some very odd behavior.

916
00:49:49,449 --> 00:49:54,013
I think it has many good points.

917
00:49:55,414 --> 00:49:58,977
I think one of the problems that I have with the Dungeon Finder

918
00:49:59,698 --> 00:50:05,362
is that it creates a very odd sense of lack of empathy

919
00:50:06,283 --> 00:50:09,426
for the other people in your group, because you know that you'll never see them again.

920
00:50:10,947 --> 00:50:13,850
You know, before you had the cross-server stuff.

921
00:50:14,427 --> 00:50:17,728
uh... union you pissed off the tank if you need another part tank

922
00:50:18,488 --> 00:50:22,049
uh... that you know there was enough of things go around

923
00:50:22,609 --> 00:50:25,330
uh... so you really don't piss this guy off but now people

924
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:28,111
feel like they can be jerks to the tanks with impunity

925
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,091
uh...

926
00:50:29,831 --> 00:50:33,312
i also think that also makes the strong tie weak tie problem worse

927
00:50:33,332 --> 00:50:35,853
uh... because again

928
00:50:37,056 --> 00:50:41,338
a lot of times if your guild would fall apart, you would say, hey, I did some dungeons with

929
00:50:41,378 --> 00:50:45,599
this guy, he was fairly competent, maybe his guild doesn't suck. And now you don't have

930
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:50,001
that sort of social network that's sort of in the background. That being said, playing

931
00:50:50,021 --> 00:50:54,683
from the, as the experience of the loner who likes to run bugs, and because I play healers

932
00:50:54,743 --> 00:50:59,685
mostly and therefore high valued, man, it's a lot easier to get groups. And so if you

933
00:50:59,725 --> 00:51:04,067
can put up with that psychology, it might be the right decision for your game.

934
00:51:07,477 --> 00:51:08,017
Anything else?

935
00:51:09,998 --> 00:51:11,538
I'd like to thank you for coming to this talk,

936
00:51:11,598 --> 00:51:12,879
and thanks for coming to GDC.

937
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,219
And I guess we'll see everybody next year.

938
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,981
Oh, everybody should have a white piece of paper.

939
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:23,062
If you could just pick them up and circle the word excellent

940
00:51:24,022 --> 00:51:25,642
and give them to the person by the door.

941
00:51:26,263 --> 00:51:26,903
Thank you very much.
