1
00:00:00,509 --> 00:00:04,352
Hey everyone, this is Chris Graft, editor-in-chief of Gamasutra.

2
00:00:05,393 --> 00:00:11,278
Doing something a little bit different in this special episode of GDC Podcast.

3
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:15,562
We're talking to Lars Ducey. He's co-founder of Level Up Labs,

4
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:21,767
which made the successful RPG-slash-tower-defense hybrid Defender's Quest.

5
00:00:22,428 --> 00:00:25,791
He also did some work with Valve on its Steam Labs experiments.

6
00:00:27,172 --> 00:00:34,359
In this episode, we talk less about game development and design here, and more about our experience

7
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,025
as Texans amid the brutal winter storm that left people without access to heat, power,

8
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:45,149
and in many cases even food for days.

9
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,553
So you can feel free to skip on past this episode if that doesn't necessarily interest you.

10
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:57,116
We're going to get back to the purely game development related content yet this month.

11
00:00:57,696 --> 00:01:02,038
But I encourage you to listen and stick around.

12
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,761
We do talk a little bit about systems and our reliance on them,

13
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:09,862
and we talk a little bit about Lars's...

14
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:17,764
experience making a game about power grids and energy and all of that stuff

15
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:25,266
which is obviously relevant. So one last thing if you'd like to help people who

16
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:30,548
are continuing to need help in Texas there are a variety of mutual aid groups

17
00:01:30,588 --> 00:01:38,010
to donate to and that includes Mutual Aid Houston, Mutual Aid Austin, DFW Mutual Aid,

18
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,990
Feed the people, Dallas.

19
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:44,012
You can also Google Mutual Aid Texas to find more.

20
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:51,315
And there are people who are still going to be having issues for a while now,

21
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:56,877
even though we are now back to normal, beautiful Texas weather.

22
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,198
So, thanks for listening.

23
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:01,058
We'll be back in a sec.

24
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:31,999
Okay, so we are we're here with Lars, not Duckett, but Ducey. Lars and I were kind of tweeting back

25
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:38,404
and forth amid everything that was going on in Texas, so the reason that I decided to have him

26
00:02:38,644 --> 00:02:44,189
on this this show is because I just feel like we both had a lot to say.

27
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:53,932
I think that it's difficult to convey what happened over the past week and what is still

28
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:54,653
ongoing.

29
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:58,914
It's difficult to convey the severity of the issue.

30
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:06,896
It really is kind of like, and I don't blame people for not...

31
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:12,278
Like just for context, we were both without power, heat, all of that for quite some time.

32
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:15,059
And people we know still to some degree aren't.

33
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:20,860
Yeah, yeah. We're going to get into the specifics of our situations.

34
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,521
But it's just something that...

35
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:28,663
I don't, I don't blame people for not totally absorbing or understanding the

36
00:03:28,703 --> 00:03:32,445
severity of what happened here and is happening over the past week.

37
00:03:32,725 --> 00:03:34,325
It's just difficult to convey.

38
00:03:34,385 --> 00:03:39,868
So I thought that maybe, you know, using this venue, um, to talk about some game

39
00:03:39,908 --> 00:03:45,410
developer related stuff, you know, with a game developer like Lars, um, but also.

40
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:47,211
Just talk about,

41
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:54,455
This happened and maybe people can gain a better understanding of the situation down here by

42
00:03:54,576 --> 00:04:02,501
listening to us rattle on about it. Yeah it's so weird like my first game dev project professionally

43
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:10,126
was an educational game called Super Energy Apocalypse in which you as the leaders of the

44
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:16,670
post-apocalyptic republic of New Texas have to like balance your energy grid so it doesn't death

45
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,050
spiral.

46
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:24,014
And like, it was like funded by an educational, not educational, sorry, but a nonprofit, nonpartisan,

47
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:27,617
like environmental research group called Houston Advanced Research Center. So like right in Houston.

48
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:32,700
And like, so like, I have a lot of background knowledge about natural gas and coal,

49
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,663
and wind and solar and all that. And then this happens like 15 years later,

50
00:04:38,724 --> 00:04:42,946
after I'm doing all kinds of other stuff. And it's like, it's like really kind of eerie to me.

51
00:04:43,892 --> 00:05:01,861
That's wild. I didn't even realize that, you know, from having you on. I know from, you know, from your games and from working at, you know, working for Valve on different Steam projects, I didn't know about the, what's the name of...

52
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:12,146
It's called Super Energy Apocalypse and most of you probably can't play it anymore because it was a Flash game. It's still up on Kongregate. It's free. Probably got played more than any other game I ever made, even like the ones that did well on Steam.

53
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:13,727
You know, which is hilarious.

54
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:18,930
But it was like, yeah, like I went and I did all the research on different kinds of energy

55
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,393
generation and so like, you know, it does little things like when the wind stops blowing

56
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:27,896
the turbines turn off, you know, like nuclear produces nuclear waste, like, you know, what

57
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:31,438
is the relative cost versus the relative emissions of natural gas versus coal?

58
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:34,440
Like I had to crunch all those numbers, probably badly because I was like 20.

59
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,041
But you know.

60
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:40,247
Like, I still retain a little bit of that, but it's like so weird now.

61
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:45,996
Also, another background fact about me is I'm Norwegian, like a passport holder, it's my first language.

62
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:51,325
Um, and it's so weird being in Texas being this damn cold.

63
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,101
Like, I feel like it's kind of like a, finally a chance to use my degree kind of situation.

64
00:05:58,121 --> 00:06:02,443
Because like, if you have Norwegian relatives, they'll just like make you all these sweaters

65
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:02,943
and stuff.

66
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,184
And you're like, that's great, I love it, it's so beautiful, you work so hard, I live

67
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:07,804
in Texas.

68
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:10,665
And I'm like, today the prophecy is fulfilled.

69
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:18,830
You open up the treasure chest of sweaters that you've been saving up this whole time.

70
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,933
Yeah, seriously. I also have a Russian friend from my church. She's Russian.

71
00:06:26,774 --> 00:06:31,036
Her son's grown up now, so she's like, here's all these ski bibs I can't use anymore. You have

72
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:34,558
these for them? It's like, yeah, I might go visit my relatives in Norway one day. So we'll put the

73
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:38,040
kids in those. It's like, we used those. I'm so glad we had this stuff.

74
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,962
Where are you exactly in Texas?

75
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,985
Don't need your address or even like,

76
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:43,967
where are you in general in Texas?

77
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:45,308
I'm in the Brazos Valley.

78
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:46,950
I'm in central Texas, right?

79
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:47,751
Okay.

80
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:50,314
You know, so there's a Texas triangle between,

81
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:53,197
I always embarrass myself and get one of the cities wrong,

82
00:06:53,237 --> 00:06:54,098
but it's like Austin,

83
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:58,288
Dallas and Houston and San Antonio.

84
00:06:58,308 --> 00:07:00,851
I forget which one is the one that's supposed to be the western edge of it.

85
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:02,372
I think it's either Austin or San Antonio.

86
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:03,013
Right.

87
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:05,135
But I don't know which one's it's Austin is closer.

88
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:05,335
Okay.

89
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,035
I know geography.

90
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:08,618
So we're like in the middle of that triangle.

91
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:08,978
Right.

92
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:13,042
And you know, we're close to Texas A&M university, you know, and there's

93
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:16,906
like a big medical hub here and, um, that's where I am and you're in Austin.

94
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:17,126
Right.

95
00:07:17,643 --> 00:07:20,325
Yeah, yeah. I'm in, um, Austin suburbs.

96
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:29,269
I've been down here for going on seven years and, uh, it wasn't quite like my

97
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:33,631
relatives are sending it from, from Norway or sending me sweaters, but like,

98
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:40,955
I felt like, you know, I, I spent about like 33 years or something like that in,

99
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:43,636
um, in Indiana, Northern Indiana.

100
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:50,683
So I felt like a total badass when I found my ice scraper.

101
00:07:51,564 --> 00:07:54,287
And like, because I had to, the roads are terrible.

102
00:07:54,327 --> 00:08:01,295
This is like, of course, there's zero infrastructure for clearing roads at all.

103
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,636
And that's something like...

104
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:05,279
Zero, as in nothing.

105
00:08:05,713 --> 00:08:10,274
And this is something that, like, I think we'll get into, like, how many heads should

106
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:11,975
roll about this probably in a minute.

107
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:16,817
But, like, just a perspective for people, and I say this as someone who, like, you've

108
00:08:16,837 --> 00:08:20,198
lived in Indiana where it presumably gets cold, and you've lived here.

109
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:21,598
I'm a Norwegian.

110
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:23,359
I'm a pathetic excuse for a Norwegian.

111
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:27,140
Like, I speak the language, but, like, I mostly only went there in the summer.

112
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,922
You know, like, I've not had to endure, like, a black Norwegian winter where the sun does

113
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:33,342
not come up, right?

114
00:08:33,902 --> 00:08:34,203
You know?

115
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:34,263
Um...

116
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,543
But I have any kind of absorbed bioosmosis experience at all with winter weather.

117
00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:45,846
And I think people like Canadians and people in the North are like,

118
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:48,247
Oh, Texas can't handle a little snow, huh?

119
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:52,529
It's like, it was five degrees Fahrenheit, which is...

120
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,351
Like, sub-freezing by a lot.

121
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:58,472
In Texas, parts of Mexico were snowing.

122
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:03,594
Like, this is the equivalent of 105 degrees Fahrenheit in Oslo.

123
00:09:04,054 --> 00:09:08,596
Like, now I think they're probably, when all is said and done, and cooler heads have prevailed,

124
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:11,958
and we're done dunking on each other on Twitter and actually looking at the information,

125
00:09:12,478 --> 00:09:15,339
we're gonna find, like, what was the actual cause of this,

126
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,900
and probably we should have done better preparing, but it's like...

127
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,901
This was kind of unprecedented.

128
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:22,922
But I also want to talk about the fact that like unprecedented...

129
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:24,362
Pardon my French.

130
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:26,503
Unprecedented shit is happening all the time now.

131
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:28,783
Like, just before this,

132
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:31,304
like, I had two 500 year floods in my area.

133
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:31,964
Just locally.

134
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:34,805
You know, Hurricane Harvey came a couple years ago

135
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,905
and like whacked my brother's apartment to death

136
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:38,706
in Houston and I had some friends

137
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:40,066
had to evacuate and stay locally.

138
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:40,806
Like, that was awful.

139
00:09:41,387 --> 00:09:46,330
and then, you know, and like the amount of water that was dumped on Houston was ridiculous.

140
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:49,793
And then like, we're in the middle of a global pandemic already, right?

141
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:53,115
Yeah, that's the other thing. It's a disaster within a disaster.

142
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,858
Yeah, I mean, let's talk about our personal experiences here.

143
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:56,078
Okay.

144
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:59,760
I think you've had it worse than I have. I've had power.

145
00:10:01,682 --> 00:10:04,744
Like my like I had three days of really bad stuff

146
00:10:05,244 --> 00:10:08,667
Yeah, and what that looked like for me is probably easy mode compared to you and some other stories

147
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:12,650
I've had from friends and relatives. Yeah, we had let's let's go. Let's go to

148
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,113
So I want to just return to where you said like

149
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:22,076
You know people from Norway or for that matter people from northern, Indiana

150
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:27,120
Or like anywhere in the Midwest that gets way colder than than this

151
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,281
I mean we're talking about like

152
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:36,564
Double digit negative winch only type stuff and negative Fahrenheit right yeah, yeah Fahrenheit. Yeah yeah, so like

153
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:41,165
Super cold yeah, and it's it didn't get that cold

154
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:46,027
It did get down to like five seven degrees like where where I am, but it's kind of like

155
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,568
I can handle that.

156
00:10:48,668 --> 00:10:55,310
So I was dismissive about it on Twitter because I get annoyed with...

157
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:00,731
Because I saw at the beginning of the pandemic people hoarding stuff from grocery stores,

158
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:02,372
for example, that they don't need.

159
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:10,074
And my feeling is that you're leaving your neighbor in the lurch if you're taking more

160
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:10,754
than your share.

161
00:11:10,774 --> 00:11:12,414
So, you know.

162
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:18,036
It was, to me, that was overdoing it.

163
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:20,996
Like, why are you panicking to that extent?

164
00:11:21,577 --> 00:11:23,557
Like, it's, you know, it'll be fine.

165
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:26,418
Oh, I have a lot to say about prepper culture

166
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:27,338
because I know some preppers.

167
00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:29,758
But, yeah, we'll get to that in a sec.

168
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:30,099
Go ahead.

169
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:34,780
Yeah, and like, so, you know, like a day later,

170
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,941
so our power went out like right at midnight on Sunday

171
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:40,421
and it,

172
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:45,243
stayed off for

173
00:11:45,943 --> 00:11:51,187
The coldest part of all this it was out for 36 hours straight. Yeah, so oh my gosh

174
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:55,289
Yeah, and we're lucky and like and this is one thing

175
00:11:55,329 --> 00:12:02,734
What's what's cool about like Texans that I see them tweeting about this almost everybody is like I had no water for this amount of time

176
00:12:02,774 --> 00:12:08,417
I know heat and power for this amount of time and it's always couching and I'm one of the lucky ones

177
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:11,800
I always see people saying that and that's how I feel like

178
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:30,899
Yeah, like the fact that we were having a podcast about this and I was able to like tweet live tweet the thing because I never lost cell service and I had rolling blackouts like I had four hours of power a day on the good days, like two hours on the bad days and they were like eat like it was one hour at a time spread out evenly so it was like big dark periods but like

179
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,702
Some of my direct relatives, I'm talking like brothers, sisters-in-laws and stuff like that.

180
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,325
Some of them didn't get power back until yesterday and some of them still don't have water.

181
00:12:41,665 --> 00:12:46,328
And they went 52, 72 hours without anything. It was insane.

182
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:53,092
And then you just think of all the homeless, all poor people and stuff,

183
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:55,333
and the counties that have really...

184
00:12:56,754 --> 00:13:01,961
One thing that really impressed upon me was the importance of my local utility.

185
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:06,007
Like, there's all this hoopla going on with ERCOT, which is, for those who don't know,

186
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:09,191
that's like the managing entity for the whole Texas grid.

187
00:13:09,611 --> 00:13:12,195
But your local utility has, like, how...

188
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,636
How good they are at getting it down power lines.

189
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:18,617
So like, dealing with just infrastructure damage versus rationing, right?

190
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:20,618
And then their rationing strategy too.

191
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:22,598
Like, they were able to...

192
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:26,300
Like, it's kind of like a video game to like keep a grid up, right?

193
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,340
It's like, you gotta keep your people...

194
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,741
You gotta give them enough power to like get them through this crisis.

195
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:32,842
But you also gotta like manage the strain on the grid.

196
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:34,642
And like, everyone's pissed at you because...

197
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:38,803
You're rationing their energy, but you have to do it right or everyone's gonna get screwed.

198
00:13:39,324 --> 00:13:43,245
And they were able to give us a couple hours of juice a day, evenly spaced,

199
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:47,626
communicate with us when it was happening through the local, like, news station and stuff,

200
00:13:48,186 --> 00:13:51,247
and everyone was, like, giving them all this flack because they were mad it was happening at all,

201
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:54,248
but then I hear about these other stories, like, where you were and other places,

202
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,469
and it's like, maybe they had it harder there, but, like, man.

203
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:03,713
They did a bang up job and maybe they have good circumstances too, but I'm so grateful for my local utility.

204
00:14:03,773 --> 00:14:08,637
So if anyone here listening works for BTU Utilities in the Brazos Valley...

205
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:11,887
I am super grateful for all of your hard work.

206
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:16,888
Like we talk about frontline essential workers, that's them out freezing their asses off to

207
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:18,948
literally keep their friends and neighbors alive.

208
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:22,769
It's kind of like, oh wow, everything does run on electricity.

209
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:27,110
So we have obviously like, you know, a power outage.

210
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,131
It's like lights off, yeah, you lose your Wi-Fi.

211
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:32,211
Like obviously that kind of thing.

212
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,492
It's like, okay, I can deal with that.

213
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:37,074
We've got gas, you know, our house is heated with gas.

214
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:41,437
Well, our furnace is activated by electricity.

215
00:14:41,497 --> 00:14:42,498
And it runs on people.

216
00:14:42,558 --> 00:14:43,459
Yeah.

217
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:46,101
And then it's like, okay, but we still have water.

218
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:49,784
Well, the water plant runs on electricity.

219
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:50,144
Right.

220
00:14:50,164 --> 00:14:51,465
It's like, now you don't have water.

221
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:52,546
You don't have, you know.

222
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:53,046
Exactly.

223
00:14:53,386 --> 00:14:56,749
Yeah, and all this stuff just dominoes and.

224
00:14:57,469 --> 00:14:59,630
My thermostat is digital, right?

225
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:00,051
Yeah.

226
00:15:00,071 --> 00:15:03,072
Which means they're telling me, like they're doing good communication, right?

227
00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:07,655
They're like, guys, everyone, shut off your heat so when the power comes back on,

228
00:15:07,715 --> 00:15:10,516
it doesn't instantly get shut off from the instant load.

229
00:15:10,816 --> 00:15:14,639
And I'm like, when the lights go back on for my one hour, like, my, my, my,

230
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:15,899
hello?

231
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,860
Did it happen again?

232
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,021
Oh, it's just my screensaver.

233
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:19,661
Oh my God.

234
00:15:20,362 --> 00:15:21,102
I've got PTSD.

235
00:15:21,242 --> 00:15:22,423
Oh my gosh.

236
00:15:23,063 --> 00:15:23,884
That's awful.

237
00:15:26,296 --> 00:15:26,596
Okay.

238
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:28,819
I was like, no, I was just picturing you.

239
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:29,640
Oh man.

240
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,221
We're keeping that.

241
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:31,942
That's that's so awful.

242
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:32,864
Yeah.

243
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:33,424
That's okay.

244
00:15:33,464 --> 00:15:34,445
That's, that's hilarious though.

245
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:36,127
That's, that's the kind of humor we need to get.

246
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:39,591
I'm, I'm, I'm moving my mouse right now to make sure that, you know, I don't get

247
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:41,513
freaked out and wake my computer back up.

248
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,845
Yeah, so anyway, so, um, what was I saying?

249
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,746
Yeah, so like, I have this digital thermometer, right?

250
00:15:46,806 --> 00:15:52,250
And so like, the utility is telling me it's essential that I wait 15 minutes before I turn my heat on

251
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:56,432
when I get my rationed hour of power for, you know, the next, like, 10 hour block.

252
00:15:56,792 --> 00:16:00,935
And I can't do it because my, because the power showed off while I had the heat on

253
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:03,997
and I can't change the thermometer setting because it's digital!

254
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:06,918
I have to like, run like a ninja when the light comes on to go,

255
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,699
Okay, okay, system, heat, off, done!

256
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,141
Yeah, yeah. Oh, geez.

257
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,963
And, like, that's impressive that you even got that communication.

258
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,343
So, we were...

259
00:16:17,484 --> 00:16:18,525
Okay, let's...

260
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,065
So much to talk about.

261
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,006
We're going back. Yeah, it's like...

262
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:23,047
For my household...

263
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:24,488
And I've got kids, you know.

264
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:25,628
Me too, yeah.

265
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:26,549
Yeah, and...

266
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:29,050
So, 36 hours of that.

267
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:29,590
We're...

268
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:36,054
Like, luckily we have a gas range, so we can boil water.

269
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:39,397
I was like the whole water thing,

270
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:42,700
it started like we got a handle on staying warm

271
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:50,286
and our town tweeted out the amount of water

272
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:53,329
is like make sure that you have two gallons of water

273
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,613
per person for over the next 30,

274
00:16:57,693 --> 00:16:58,454
like for the next 36 hours.

275
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:05,621
Yeah, and boil it. And I was thinking like, what? Because at that point our water

276
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:08,724
hadn't already gone out. It must have at that point just been draining out of the

277
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:14,430
rest of our pipes, but we were collecting the dripping with pots and bowls and

278
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:20,917
stuff. And I saw that 36 hours and I was like, what are they getting at here?

279
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:30,467
It's like, certainly they're just not gonna turn off, you know, turn off the water because people need that to drink and live.

280
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:35,311
And they did. And we, like, we resorted to...

281
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,253
So we went from level one...

282
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:49,121
water gatherer, water gatherer people who like, okay, we can get like these drippings in pots and pans and we can boil them.

283
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:54,303
And then we can we can use those and then once those were done

284
00:17:55,023 --> 00:18:00,946
like my wife Anna, she became like a level 100 water farmer out back

285
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:07,549
collecting like, like we drank the the roof water. I know that it's like last resort stuff

286
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:09,030
but like what else are you gonna do?

287
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,112
So we're drinking the roof water and boiling it.

288
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:16,654
I am scooping snow.

289
00:18:16,674 --> 00:18:25,819
I took a five-gallon paint bucket and went to the backyard and filled our bathtub with snow

290
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,761
so that we would have that reserved there.

291
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:34,944
And we would use that to flush toilets mainly.

292
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:38,907
Yeah, we didn't drink out of the bathtub,

293
00:18:39,948 --> 00:18:46,994
but we did drink some boiled snow and roof water.

294
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:48,715
And you were filtering that too,

295
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:50,077
so you would boil it and then filter it

296
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:51,097
through paper towels, you'd said?

297
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,480
Yes, yeah, yeah, we had a strainer

298
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,082
and then we would just put a couple layers

299
00:18:56,122 --> 00:19:00,726
of paper towel down and just run that baby through.

300
00:19:00,746 --> 00:19:03,989
Yeah, I'm really impressed that

301
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:06,210
But we never lost our water.

302
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,771
They did give us a notice that we might lose water.

303
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:11,912
And I want to make sure, maybe not now,

304
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:17,013
but talk about the issue of panic prepping versus making

305
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,074
sure that you can take care of yourself

306
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:20,295
so you can also take care of other people,

307
00:19:20,795 --> 00:19:23,316
because I think that's a distinction that

308
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:24,716
is really important.

309
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:27,558
Go ahead and talk about it.

310
00:19:27,598 --> 00:19:29,119
Give me your thoughts on that.

311
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:31,961
So an example, you get a notice that you're about to lose water.

312
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:34,522
What does everybody do? They go fill up their bathtub, right?

313
00:19:34,683 --> 00:19:36,624
And then the act of everyone filling up their bathtub

314
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:37,845
puts strain on the water system

315
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,386
and causes it to crash down for everyone, right?

316
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:41,567
It's like everyone doing a run on the store

317
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:44,569
and panic buying all the toilet paper.

318
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:46,711
Yeah, our water people said specifically,

319
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:47,471
do not do that.

320
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:48,512
Right, right, right.

321
00:19:48,612 --> 00:19:50,453
And so, that is where...

322
00:19:51,594 --> 00:19:56,457
like planning ahead matters because I did fill up my bathtub because but I did it early.

323
00:19:56,477 --> 00:19:57,337
I did it.

324
00:19:57,477 --> 00:20:02,080
But that's the trick with all these things is you have to prepare before it's obvious

325
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,722
there's a crisis when you might still be embarrassed for preparing, right?

326
00:20:07,302 --> 00:20:11,444
Because like if I go to Walmart, not not now, but if I go to Walmart like three days ago,

327
00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:15,226
and I just buy a bunch of stuff, I'm not being a strain on anybody.

328
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:19,548
If I do it right when they're like, I mean, Walmart just makes a bunch of money and then

329
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:20,509
they order new stuff, right?

330
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:27,333
You know, if I do it right when there's a crisis, then I'm doing like damaging hoarding

331
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:32,496
because other people need that stuff and I'm causing a crisis by causing a run on the stores.

332
00:20:33,116 --> 00:20:36,758
And also like, also when people do runs on stores, they buy all the wrong stuff.

333
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:41,141
Like they just, they just like buy all the ketchup and all kinds of weird things, you

334
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:45,023
know, they just like, they're just like, you know, it's because they're panicking, right?

335
00:20:46,524 --> 00:20:51,225
It's like, um, and so like even something like filling up your tub, you can do it the right way or the wrong way.

336
00:20:51,545 --> 00:20:55,006
And I'm so impressed by your resourcefulness because we never lost water, you know.

337
00:20:55,506 --> 00:21:00,307
The prep work that we did though was, um, try to do...

338
00:21:00,787 --> 00:21:06,829
I always try to do the smallest amount of prep work I can that is going to be useful no matter what.

339
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:13,050
So, for instance, I have a Berkey filter. If you don't know what those are, they're like really top of the line water filter-like.

340
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,251
Brita's like level 1, this is like level 100.

341
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:21,353
Big aluminum or whatever cylinders, these big filters, they use them all over the world.

342
00:21:22,093 --> 00:21:27,516
Like, NGOs use them throughout every kind of devastated country with no safe water supply,

343
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:27,796
right?

344
00:21:28,276 --> 00:21:32,858
And they're just gravity fed filters, no moving parts, no electrical parts, no nothing, you

345
00:21:32,898 --> 00:21:33,078
know?

346
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:37,720
And you just put water in the top, it doesn't matter how awful and brackish it is.

347
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,102
They love to do this test with food coloring in the top and then it comes out all clear.

348
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:49,865
So if you just order one of those after a crisis is over and not about to start, and just have one in your garage,

349
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:56,567
then, like, I wish I could have shipped you mine, you know, by jumping into my time machine and giving it to you.

350
00:21:56,587 --> 00:21:57,687
Your life would have been a lot easier.

351
00:21:57,707 --> 00:22:01,048
Because I certainly didn't wind up having to use it this time, but I'm glad I had it.

352
00:22:01,068 --> 00:22:04,649
Because I live next to a creek, and when it's freezing cold, it's snowing.

353
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:06,950
Usually we prepare for a drought, not like...

354
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,231
Freezing to death.

355
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:12,615
But like I could have poured brackish water from my creek that is probably full of every

356
00:22:12,655 --> 00:22:17,420
kind of amoeba and drain chemical possible and had fresh water.

357
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:23,727
But like filling up your bathtub the minute you know your water is about to go off in

358
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:26,029
ten minutes is going to cause your water to go off in two minutes.

359
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:27,044
Yeah, yeah.

360
00:22:27,524 --> 00:22:30,107
It's all, it's all the same resources that, that we're pulling from.

361
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:35,111
And, uh, yeah, I I'm, I'm taking, I'm taking notes on, on the filter too.

362
00:22:35,191 --> 00:22:39,454
And it's funny that, you know, so like my dad was, my dad was older.

363
00:22:39,474 --> 00:22:45,819
Um, like he, he was born in 1930 and anybody who lived through the great

364
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:51,164
depression has these, uh, different, you know, quirks like hoarding.

365
00:22:51,184 --> 00:22:53,546
It's like keeping, keeping everything.

366
00:22:53,566 --> 00:22:55,808
My mom grew up in Norway.

367
00:22:56,448 --> 00:23:02,712
Post-war without electricity. Mm-hmm. Yeah, like hardcore. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, my mom was

368
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:08,295
Born in the Philippines and they were the most abject poverty

369
00:23:08,335 --> 00:23:11,857
So she also has these right, you know these resourceful

370
00:23:12,778 --> 00:23:15,680
like cells in her body that you know are

371
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:22,884
Thinking about when you have nothing and then your your brain start like even through like one week of this, you know

372
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:24,845
like just a week

373
00:23:25,325 --> 00:23:32,991
Your brain already by the end of it is adjusting to like when you're hearing the snow melting right now and dripping away.

374
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:37,135
It's like, we're wasting, like that's wasteful.

375
00:23:37,195 --> 00:23:38,516
Right, right, right, right, yeah.

376
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:40,137
We should be collecting that water.

377
00:23:40,689 --> 00:23:44,853
Like, like I had filled up, like I had filled up my tub, you know, before I thought there

378
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:47,835
would be a crisis, before there was any notice, you know, because it's just a game.

379
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:49,857
I'm not, I'm not trying to tub shame you, by the way.

380
00:23:49,877 --> 00:23:52,880
No, no, no, I understand, I understand it, but like, like, I'm afraid to drain the tub

381
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,080
now.

382
00:23:53,741 --> 00:23:57,584
Like, I'm like, I'm like, if I, if I, if I drain it, I might need that water.

383
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:59,866
I'm just like, I've got the filter, but like, I don't want to drink creek water.

384
00:24:01,447 --> 00:24:01,808
You know?

385
00:24:02,748 --> 00:24:05,469
And it's like, I'm afraid now, you know?

386
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:07,370
And it was so funny because we had,

387
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,772
we were so blessed with the intermittent power,

388
00:24:10,812 --> 00:24:12,673
the rationed four hours of power a day,

389
00:24:12,713 --> 00:24:14,634
that when the lights came on, we had like,

390
00:24:15,194 --> 00:24:16,014
at first we didn't know what to do,

391
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,315
but we got a little dance.

392
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:18,436
I was like, okay, charge the phones.

393
00:24:18,696 --> 00:24:19,636
All right, turn off the furnace.

394
00:24:19,896 --> 00:24:22,358
Okay, everybody, like, you know, it's like.

395
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:25,199
That feeling when the power comes back on.

396
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:26,720
So ours was out for 36, it was on for six.

397
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,342
And then it was off for like 14 or 15 more hours.

398
00:24:32,742 --> 00:24:32,962
Right.

399
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:38,003
And then it finally came back on and stayed.

400
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,504
Oh, so the first time the power came back on,

401
00:24:43,444 --> 00:24:46,505
all that was about at like four in the morning, I think.

402
00:24:47,045 --> 00:24:50,485
And our fire alarms all went off.

403
00:24:50,765 --> 00:24:54,306
So, yeah, it was just like, what the heck is going on?

404
00:24:54,366 --> 00:24:55,727
And we couldn't get them to shut off.

405
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:59,691
So we like I had to get on my ladder and then just

406
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:05,036
like uninstall all of them because there was nothing that that we could do and

407
00:25:05,056 --> 00:25:10,923
I was looking around and smelling for smoke and it's like okay, this is definitely a false alarm and

408
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:16,449
It wasn't the carbon monoxide alarm because it's a different like right alarm. It says carbon monoxide

409
00:25:16,817 --> 00:25:18,457
Oh, the carbon monoxide is such a thing though.

410
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:20,978
It's because you're like, I should get in my car and like shut the garage door.

411
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:22,159
It's so sad.

412
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:25,980
It's so sad because like you see people hospitalized or even die every time

413
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,961
something like this happens, because, you know, like some someone got carbon

414
00:25:29,981 --> 00:25:34,263
monoxide from poisoning from charcoal, like using charcoal inside.

415
00:25:34,923 --> 00:25:38,804
And and yes, of course, like people use generators in a closed garage

416
00:25:38,864 --> 00:25:40,165
and it just poisons the whole house.

417
00:25:41,325 --> 00:25:44,367
Right, and you can't tell that it's happening, you just get sleepy and die.

418
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:48,030
I have a fireplace too and I kicked myself.

419
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,152
This is where prepping is all about, like smart prepping, not crazy prepping.

420
00:25:52,172 --> 00:25:53,113
It's all about thinking ahead.

421
00:25:54,134 --> 00:26:00,758
Half the things I did, the real resource is family and friends and communication because

422
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:06,041
half the stuff I did is not because I'm smart, it's because someone told me offhand a couple

423
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:07,302
days before this all went down.

424
00:26:08,864 --> 00:26:12,726
I'm kicking myself about my fireplace because I've got a fireplace and I couldn't figure

425
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:16,127
out, like it took me forever to figure out that I could actually burn logs in it.

426
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:20,009
And my Norwegian mom had given me a gift of these beautiful decorative birch logs.

427
00:26:20,069 --> 00:26:21,089
But they're like, they'll burn.

428
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:22,470
And I have like 10 of them.

429
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,331
I'm like, we could burn that wood.

430
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:30,153
I was sure this fireplace wouldn't set my attic on fire because six years ago we had

431
00:26:30,753 --> 00:26:32,054
So, we're going to look at our dryer vent.

432
00:26:32,074 --> 00:26:36,056
And what's funny is the people who fix dryer vents are the same people who sweep chimneys.

433
00:26:36,336 --> 00:26:42,119
Chimney sweeps, re-specialized and re-trained in dryer vents when all the fireplace work

434
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:42,539
dried up.

435
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:45,240
Like, they mostly do dryer vents, but they still do fireplaces.

436
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,541
And we had them come out for a dryer vent six years ago.

437
00:26:47,561 --> 00:26:49,862
And it's like, oh, you've got a nice fireplace here.

438
00:26:49,882 --> 00:26:50,922
I'm like, yeah, it's Texas.

439
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:51,983
We'll never use it.

440
00:26:52,423 --> 00:26:56,945
And he's like, yeah, well, if you ever do want to use it, you should get me by to inspect

441
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:59,766
it so you don't set your attic on fire based on how your insulation's done.

442
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,888
And so like I'm there with my fireplace and I'm like, do I risk it?

443
00:27:07,288 --> 00:27:12,270
I'm like, power's rationed, we've got heat, we'll do it if we're about to die, but no.

444
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,051
Yeah, yeah. Oh, I smoked a chicken on the coldest night.

445
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:23,152
Like we needed, I don't know, we needed food for a couple of days.

446
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:27,414
For those who don't know, Chris Graft is an amazing barbecue grill master.

447
00:27:27,754 --> 00:27:29,134
He's the best, I'm told.

448
00:27:30,014 --> 00:27:31,935
Well, I mean, I'm not bad.

449
00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:34,697
He's as amazing as he is modest.

450
00:27:35,257 --> 00:27:36,398
Folks, it is a treat.

451
00:27:36,678 --> 00:27:37,378
Yeah, it's true.

452
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:41,081
So I smoked this chicken and I have...

453
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:43,042
He smokes chicken the way he smokes noobs.

454
00:27:43,402 --> 00:27:45,443
I don't know about that.

455
00:27:45,983 --> 00:27:47,044
Lars, what are you talking about?

456
00:27:49,052 --> 00:27:56,277
But it gave me like, you know, it was like it was at that point I checked and it was like 14 degrees on its way down to seven.

457
00:27:56,297 --> 00:27:59,659
And yeah, I sat I sat out there with the chicken.

458
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,301
I didn't want to go back inside and outside because I'm letting like what remains of the heat.

459
00:28:04,842 --> 00:28:18,400
And luckily our house, even after the first 36 hours, it got down to 50 inside, which

460
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,304
is impressive that it was able to maintain that.

461
00:28:21,604 --> 00:28:22,726
That the insulation was good enough?

462
00:28:23,146 --> 00:28:29,528
Yeah, so like we and we just dressed like, you know, at night, we just dressed like winter, right?

463
00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:34,509
They say they say heat your body, not the room, you know, like, I mean, I mean, I slept in like

464
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:41,451
long underwear, PJ pants, and like sweatpants and like a shirt and undershirt, a jacket, another

465
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,452
jacket and a hat.

466
00:28:42,672 --> 00:28:51,477
Yeah, exactly. Me too. It was like I was going out to the grocery store during an Indiana winter, and I just slept like that.

467
00:28:51,857 --> 00:29:00,642
Yeah, and like my mom was saying, I mean my mom, who grew up in Norway where it gets this cold and power had not been brought to her rural village yet, so that was just how life was.

468
00:29:01,003 --> 00:29:06,706
She's like, wear a hat, son. You need to wear a hat, because most of your energy gets lost through your head.

469
00:29:07,066 --> 00:29:09,608
Like all these little survival tips from the old country.

470
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:11,007
It's so true.

471
00:29:11,147 --> 00:29:17,010
Like, uh, yeah, I put a hat on and like, I got warm and, and I know this stuff,

472
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:22,393
but you know, I only like re-appreciated it when this past week happened.

473
00:29:22,413 --> 00:29:24,994
Like my life didn't depend on it until now.

474
00:29:25,074 --> 00:29:25,314
Yeah.

475
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:25,635
Yeah.

476
00:29:25,655 --> 00:29:28,636
And I, I'm like telling him, Hey, everyone try the hat.

477
00:29:29,036 --> 00:29:29,236
Try it.

478
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,157
Go get a hat.

479
00:29:30,357 --> 00:29:31,138
It really works.

480
00:29:31,898 --> 00:29:32,158
Yeah.

481
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:38,622
So like if we're talking about, um, like systems and, and things like that, you

482
00:29:38,642 --> 00:29:43,605
know, you talked about the game that you designed, uh, is there, um, have you

483
00:29:43,645 --> 00:29:49,229
even had any chance to kind of think about and analyze, uh, what happened,

484
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:55,873
uh, as, as far as like the Texas grid, uh, goes in anything or anything like that?

485
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:57,314
Yeah.

486
00:29:57,454 --> 00:30:00,756
Has your game design head kind of automatically went there?

487
00:30:01,656 --> 00:30:05,798
I mean, there's a whole genre of games that are all about balancing power grids, right?

488
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:06,919
You know, and...

489
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,260
Like Balance of Power.

490
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,361
Yeah.

491
00:30:11,162 --> 00:30:16,665
So, like, there was this really fun Flash game, like, tower defense game called the

492
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:18,967
Space Game, which is all just about building a power grid.

493
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:24,010
More recently on Steam, there's a game called Mindustry.

494
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:27,880
Which has, okay, okay, that's just my screensaver again.

495
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,821
Can you hear me, Chris?

496
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:31,302
Yeah.

497
00:30:31,342 --> 00:30:32,923
How many times is this going to happen?

498
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,045
I think it is literally PTSD.

499
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:36,265
I think I'm not abusing the term.

500
00:30:36,285 --> 00:30:39,347
No, you're, yeah, no, you're, that is what's happening to you.

501
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:43,230
I can, I can, I'm not, you're not even on video or anything.

502
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,250
It's palpable.

503
00:30:44,611 --> 00:30:45,011
Yeah.

504
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,051
Your panic is palpable.

505
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:52,856
Yeah, so anyway, yeah, so like, Mindustry, I haven't played Vectoria, but I assume it has, and of course my game had it.

506
00:30:52,996 --> 00:31:00,346
So, the thing about energy grid games is they're all about death spirals, right? Like, cascading failure.

507
00:31:00,706 --> 00:31:05,192
Something goes wrong which causes something else to go wrong, and then something else you weren't even paying attention to, and like...

508
00:31:06,045 --> 00:31:09,510
Like, and taking for granted goes around too, and then you're just screwed.

509
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,956
So in Energy Apocalypse, it's this like really simple one-screen tower defense game

510
00:31:14,356 --> 00:31:16,980
where you build, like, a power grid, right?

511
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,786
So, you mine coal out of the ground, and then you burn it in coal power plants.

512
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,847
And the coal power plants give you energy, but they also create emissions.

513
00:31:25,287 --> 00:31:33,709
And then the shtick of the game is that I just take all negative externalities and just arbitrarily reify them as mutant alien zombies.

514
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:40,571
And the rule is, they're invading Earth and they're terraforming it, and everything that is bad for us in terms of pollution is good for them.

515
00:31:41,271 --> 00:31:44,131
And so, the more you pollute, the stronger the enemy gets.

516
00:31:44,832 --> 00:31:48,415
And so, like, you're burning all this energy and stuff, and you've got lots of energy,

517
00:31:48,715 --> 00:31:51,137
and then your defenses are powered by your materials.

518
00:31:51,678 --> 00:31:55,561
So you have floodlights that use energy, and you have Tesla coils that use energy,

519
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:58,744
you have guns that use metal that you mine out of the ground,

520
00:31:58,764 --> 00:32:02,987
you have flamethrowers that use oil or gas, whatever's available, right?

521
00:32:03,448 --> 00:32:07,732
And so, as you're going through the game, you know, it's night,

522
00:32:08,032 --> 00:32:10,334
and so your solar panels stop working, because it's night.

523
00:32:10,914 --> 00:32:14,416
You know, or the wind stops blowing and your wind turbines don't work anymore.

524
00:32:15,056 --> 00:32:21,080
And, um, or you run out of coal and your coal fire plant, which is just like amazing for generating energy, stops working.

525
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:29,844
And then, um, you build a couple of units so that you can, like, defend yourself and you used up all your metal and your gun stopped working.

526
00:32:30,345 --> 00:32:33,046
Right? And you have these, like, cascading failure on cascading failure.

527
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:37,669
And so typically, like, you're doing pretty good until you stop paying attention to something. It goes down.

528
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:40,751
And then, like, you can't get back up.

529
00:32:41,351 --> 00:32:44,614
And, like, the challenge is, like, not falling so far down the slope.

530
00:32:45,814 --> 00:32:51,599
And there's also this inherent trade-off between efficiency and redundancy, right?

531
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:55,361
Like, an efficient system is one that has no waste.

532
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:58,684
And usually, super-efficient systems, like, run to the wire.

533
00:32:58,724 --> 00:33:01,326
Like, to use a metaphor, like, um...

534
00:33:02,726 --> 00:33:09,950
just like an Olympic athlete, right? Has like 0% body fat, you know, they're just made completely for running, say, right?

535
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:14,272
It's super efficient, you know, because that's what it takes to get that extra bit of performance.

536
00:33:14,832 --> 00:33:21,135
Um, but if they get the flu they're gonna just like die, because they have no body fat. They have no reserves, right? And

537
00:33:22,732 --> 00:33:26,714
Then there's also just mismanagement, which is neither efficient nor redundant.

538
00:33:26,774 --> 00:33:27,734
It's just bad.

539
00:33:27,754 --> 00:33:28,615
Yeah.

540
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:30,475
It's, it's interesting.

541
00:33:30,495 --> 00:33:34,137
Like, you know, when you're talking about cascading failures and mismanagement,

542
00:33:34,197 --> 00:33:39,479
it's interesting emerging from the past few days, uh, when, you know, you're

543
00:33:39,499 --> 00:33:44,801
conserving your cell phone, uh, power, you're, um, you don't have any access

544
00:33:44,841 --> 00:33:48,223
to like TV or, you know, your laptop.

545
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:48,343
So.

546
00:33:48,783 --> 00:33:55,027
You're basically kind of in the dark about a lot of things and emerging from it and then seeing the way that you know

547
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:56,728
uh, you know

548
00:33:57,388 --> 00:34:02,371
people like politicians, for example, uh, the things that they're talking about like

549
00:34:03,131 --> 00:34:05,793
uh, whereas there's now this, you know,

550
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:13,217
The people are like our governor is using this as an energy, right like pitting fossil fuels against uh,

551
00:34:13,697 --> 00:34:15,979
against renewable energy like windmills and

552
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:25,146
There was at one point at the beginning of it, somebody mentioned windmills.

553
00:34:25,507 --> 00:34:27,348
This was on Monday.

554
00:34:27,368 --> 00:34:28,950
It's like, well, it's because of the windmills.

555
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,252
And I was like, what? I didn't know what they were talking about.

556
00:34:32,593 --> 00:34:40,739
And you emerge from this and it's like, people are using this as a debate point about different kinds of energy.

557
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,561
This is what you all were talking about,

558
00:34:43,602 --> 00:34:45,323
like when we're trying to figure out

559
00:34:45,523 --> 00:34:48,265
the roof water situation.

560
00:34:48,285 --> 00:34:50,807
And those things need to be talked about,

561
00:34:51,207 --> 00:34:52,648
and they need to be considered within

562
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:55,430
the overall power grid and tech and stuff.

563
00:34:55,930 --> 00:35:01,834
But to see the discourse around that's happening

564
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:03,455
where people in tech,

565
00:35:03,515 --> 00:35:05,517
while people in Texas are suffering,

566
00:35:06,157 --> 00:35:07,538
is, it grosses me out.

567
00:35:08,103 --> 00:35:15,753
Yeah, it did me too, you know, and it's like it's a little weird for me because like on the one hand, like a lot of my family is really conservative, right?

568
00:35:15,953 --> 00:35:22,522
And the other hand, I'm also Norwegian and the Norwegian side is like a little more liberal, but like not in the way Americans expect at all.

569
00:35:22,962 --> 00:35:25,105
Like Norwegians can be pretty provincial and not.

570
00:35:26,187 --> 00:35:28,269
part of America's idea of what liberal means.

571
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:35,397
But then also, my entire game dev Twitter feed and friends are all really far left.

572
00:35:35,837 --> 00:35:37,859
And so I feel conflicted because...

573
00:35:39,496 --> 00:35:43,339
I log on, just check in what's going on, and everyone's having this big...

574
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,240
It seems...

575
00:35:44,781 --> 00:35:48,324
The impression I get, which is probably false, is that everyone has these strong opinions.

576
00:35:48,384 --> 00:35:52,987
And of course, yeah, Abbott and Cruz going to frickin' Cancun and all that nonsense.

577
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:55,710
I'm not a fan of our state leadership by any means.

578
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:01,734
But I feel like everyone's really busy making sure they score enough political points while

579
00:36:01,775 --> 00:36:04,717
we're fucking freezing, and so are all our friends and family.

580
00:36:05,438 --> 00:36:14,628
And like, and I see, and the really thing that like saddens me is when people who should know better are like, really like happy about it.

581
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:15,830
Like that makes me...

582
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:23,178
That was weird because I saw that also, and the only reason like the terrible stuff that people are saying about like, you know...

583
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:29,041
But basically what we're talking about is, you know, Texas is and has been a red state.

584
00:36:29,081 --> 00:36:35,183
There is Republican leadership and there are some people that are just like, well, that's

585
00:36:35,503 --> 00:36:36,404
that's what you get.

586
00:36:36,424 --> 00:36:38,604
And it's kind of like, oh, OK.

587
00:36:39,485 --> 00:36:43,810
We got this back in Hurricane Harvey as well, was it's like, well, you believe in climate

588
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,370
change now?

589
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:49,596
And it's like, thanks, my brother might be drowning, but good for you for being correct

590
00:36:49,736 --> 00:36:50,277
on the internet.

591
00:36:50,697 --> 00:36:51,018
Yeah.

592
00:36:51,098 --> 00:36:56,243
And then, like, it's weird for me too, because like I said, like growing up in Indiana, no

593
00:36:56,303 --> 00:36:57,204
one talks about Indiana.

594
00:36:57,685 --> 00:36:58,665
No one talks about Indiana.

595
00:36:58,985 --> 00:37:01,546
And then, like, when I come to Texas,

596
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:09,607
like, Texas is the central point for, like, politics and climate and, you know,

597
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:15,729
this being, it's just weird to log on and, like, see, you know, people that,

598
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:19,470
you know, aren't having the experience that we're all having,

599
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,450
have such strong opinions about it.

600
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,891
So it's a new thing to me.

601
00:37:25,932 --> 00:37:30,423
You want to know something hilarious? In Norway we literally have a catchphrase that's like decades old called

602
00:37:30,463 --> 00:37:34,894
That thing is totally Texas. Or in Norwegian it goes, det er is sikkert Texas, ja.

603
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,492
It's a very self-assured kind of braggy person.

604
00:37:38,512 --> 00:37:42,575
Texas has great PR in terms of getting lots of it, whether all of it is positive or not.

605
00:37:59,687 --> 00:38:03,888
But I think what people are reacting to on the internet is this, you know, very braggadocious,

606
00:38:03,928 --> 00:38:06,029
like, larger than life Texas attitude.

607
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:10,050
I mean, I know people who have said things like, let the Yankees freeze in the dark whenever,

608
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:14,852
you know, someone's like, well, if you want green energy, then, you know, coal and natural

609
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,793
gas is what keeps you warm at night.

610
00:38:16,853 --> 00:38:17,973
You know, it's so weird.

611
00:38:18,053 --> 00:38:21,434
One thing that does bug me about Abbott talking about like windmills and stuff.

612
00:38:21,494 --> 00:38:23,855
One thing I think a lot of people are surprised to know.

613
00:38:24,675 --> 00:38:29,657
is that Texas in many ways like is this world that contains multitudes and contradictions

614
00:38:30,217 --> 00:38:38,040
like it is oil and gas capital of the United States and the world but you might also wonder like

615
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:41,403
Lars is a Norwegian in Texas.

616
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:42,523
That's kind of weird.

617
00:38:43,223 --> 00:38:44,164
It's not super weird.

618
00:38:44,184 --> 00:38:45,364
Like, this isn't the reason I'm here.

619
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:47,645
You know, it's just because my mom married my dad.

620
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,085
But there's a lot of Norwegians in Texas, actually.

621
00:38:50,105 --> 00:38:53,006
They're all in Houston, because Norway is also

622
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:54,487
oil and gas producer of the world,

623
00:38:54,907 --> 00:38:58,628
and like Texas, a leader in green energy, which is so weird.

624
00:38:58,928 --> 00:39:00,829
No one thinks of Texas as a leader in green energy.

625
00:39:01,209 --> 00:39:05,330
But like, if you look at charts of wind, and solar,

626
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,451
and nuclear.

627
00:39:08,271 --> 00:39:10,192
It's like we're really, really up there.

628
00:39:10,413 --> 00:39:12,974
And that's why I feel kind of angry about people...

629
00:39:14,175 --> 00:39:19,279
I do feel resentful, like the whole, like, ragging on windmills, because everything went down.

630
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:20,159
Everything went down.

631
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:22,901
And I do want to underscore this point, and this point is really important.

632
00:39:23,442 --> 00:39:35,990
I really wish, in the wake of any crisis, everyone would just shut up for 72 hours and not have an opinion, not proclaim themselves an expert on whatever domain just happened, and just, like, look for some evidence.

633
00:39:36,031 --> 00:39:40,654
Like, I am all in favor of heads rolling. Like, yes, let the heads roll.

634
00:39:41,354 --> 00:39:48,161
But the problem is that a stopped clock, i.e. read, you know, idiot politician, can be right two times a day.

635
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:49,402
Just like a stopped clock.

636
00:39:49,922 --> 00:39:53,185
And when we just like go off and like instantly it's like, oh, I know what the reason is.

637
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:57,049
It's the thing that I'm all, it's my dead horse that I'm beating is the reason.

638
00:39:57,589 --> 00:40:01,371
It's like, you're gonna be wrong sometimes, and when you're wrong, that politician is

639
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:05,973
gonna love it, and he's never gonna shut up about it for six months, and the only thing

640
00:40:06,013 --> 00:40:10,735
that matters, which is making sure that we take care of human beings and that this crisis

641
00:40:10,755 --> 00:40:14,037
doesn't happen again, is gonna get lost in all that, you know?

642
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:19,159
There was one take I've read in the last 72 hours from someone who actually provided a

643
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:22,081
bunch of evidence for what went wrong, and he might be wrong.

644
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:27,282
I don't know if his account is going to check out, but he said, here's the data I have.

645
00:40:27,702 --> 00:40:28,903
I've tried to be fair about this.

646
00:40:29,603 --> 00:40:35,824
And my conclusion is that there was a problem in Texas, but we might have this problem nationwide.

647
00:40:36,424 --> 00:40:39,725
And the fact that Texas has an isolated grid, and this is something a lot of people are

648
00:40:39,745 --> 00:40:42,486
dogging on, oh, those Texans hate that federal regulation.

649
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:44,446
And federal regulation would have saved them.

650
00:40:44,466 --> 00:40:45,086
Maybe, maybe.

651
00:40:45,406 --> 00:40:47,727
Like, that could, I'm 100% willing to believe that.

652
00:40:48,347 --> 00:40:52,249
But another thing that's equally possible is that the grid being isolated kept

653
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:55,049
Oklahoma and Louisiana and neighboring states from going down too.

654
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:55,890
Right.

655
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,310
I hadn't thought about that.

656
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:57,610
Yeah.

657
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:01,292
For, for like listeners that haven't picked up on this yet, like the power

658
00:41:01,312 --> 00:41:06,373
grid from Texas, it is, it's ice, it's its own, it's isolated from, from

659
00:41:06,493 --> 00:41:11,455
everything else and nearby States that have got, that had just as bad, um,

660
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:17,537
icing and things like that ended up faring so much better than, than we did.

661
00:41:17,877 --> 00:41:24,442
Right, and so the conclusion is, okay, like you look at a map, Texas is like as black and dark as North Korea is on a nighttime map, right?

662
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:28,626
And so everyone's like, okay, well Texas screwed the pooch, it's all their fault, their infrastructure sucks.

663
00:41:29,346 --> 00:41:38,173
Um, you know, and maybe it is, you know, but like, I'm not an expert in, you know, power grid engineering, despite the fact that I made a Flash game 12 years ago.

664
00:41:40,354 --> 00:41:47,037
I really wish, you can wait 72 hours, the truth can wait that long and then we'll figure

665
00:41:47,057 --> 00:41:52,099
out who's really to blame and then we can have all the righteous fury we want because

666
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:56,701
then we'll actually be directed in a positive, useful direction to actually solve a problem

667
00:41:56,741 --> 00:41:59,503
rather than just score a bunch of little red hearts on Twitter.

668
00:41:59,823 --> 00:42:00,883
I like the little red hearts.

669
00:42:01,503 --> 00:42:03,484
They're so addictive, I love them.

670
00:42:03,545 --> 00:42:04,785
And they just erode my soul.

671
00:42:06,206 --> 00:42:08,807
So there's a couple other things I want to talk about.

672
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:14,310
So, again with the cascading, like, you know, failure.

673
00:42:15,381 --> 00:42:26,812
Apparently, like I was reading a really good article today on Texas Monthly about what has happened and it's a really good, clear, like, telling of what happened.

674
00:42:26,832 --> 00:42:31,977
And it's kind of what you're talking about. It's a step back looking at things in very near hindsight.

675
00:42:32,938 --> 00:42:38,363
And it's called, like, the title is The Texas Blackout is the Story of a Disaster Foretold.

676
00:42:38,964 --> 00:42:49,529
So, you know, with the benefit of hindsight, it talks about why this happened, why the systems failed, and how close we actually were to going total blackout.

677
00:42:49,989 --> 00:42:58,453
So, like, we were able to maintain, you know, some levels of energy at different places in the state, but apparently...

678
00:42:59,093 --> 00:43:02,294
Something happens like where everything is gone.

679
00:43:02,514 --> 00:43:08,036
And once everything is gone, there is a really complicated way that they have to

680
00:43:08,176 --> 00:43:14,578
use like diesel generators to start different plants across the state.

681
00:43:15,198 --> 00:43:20,119
And it sounds like you're hand cranking like an old timey car, except

682
00:43:20,279 --> 00:43:21,980
multiplied by like a trillion.

683
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:31,584
Yeah, I've been kind of a, sort of like keeping at an arm's length from, but morbidly interested

684
00:43:31,684 --> 00:43:37,526
in what's called collapse porn, you know, which is just like post-apocalyptic literature,

685
00:43:37,626 --> 00:43:42,848
right, and fiction, and non-fiction accounts of like what happened in Argentina and Venezuela,

686
00:43:42,908 --> 00:43:48,130
like, and stuff like that, and prepper culture, who have these doomsday obsessions, and like...

687
00:43:48,770 --> 00:44:01,884
Here's kind of where I'm at, like when I tell people I do some light prepping, like you get that pushback. It's like, oh, you're one of those people who hoards the toilet paper. And I'm like, like, there's this kind of person who's never

688
00:44:02,697 --> 00:44:07,442
It's a game that's been through a crisis before, who doesn't really get it, and they think that it's about selfishness.

689
00:44:07,763 --> 00:44:09,565
And it can be, because there's certainly people who like,

690
00:44:09,585 --> 00:44:13,430
F you, got mine, gonna get my bunker, gonna shoot anyone who knocks on the door.

691
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,152
Right? Those people certainly exist.

692
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:18,716
And they have weird fantasy books that I've read that are disturbing.

693
00:44:18,736 --> 00:44:19,297
But, um...

694
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,784
There's another school of thought that's like, do you have a fire extinguisher in your house?

695
00:44:25,384 --> 00:44:27,766
That's the most likely crisis that's going to happen to you.

696
00:44:28,507 --> 00:44:31,470
And do you know where it is? Do you have a drill to go get it?

697
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:34,072
If I say fire right now, will you know?

698
00:44:34,092 --> 00:44:37,655
And like when I said that in some chat room or someone, like someone immediately pointed,

699
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,137
it's like, that happened to me. There was a fire.

700
00:44:39,737 --> 00:44:41,059
I didn't know what a fire extinguisher was.

701
00:44:41,499 --> 00:44:42,200
I almost died.

702
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:47,465
And you build general survival skills, like you don't have to plan for the zombie apocalypse.

703
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:48,547
Like I have a Berkey filter.

704
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:50,829
I built that in case the water was shut off.

705
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:57,436
I never anticipated a blizzard in Texas, but now I can filter water if I have to for the

706
00:44:57,476 --> 00:44:58,477
cost of a hundred bucks.

707
00:44:58,677 --> 00:45:03,740
I like, and this is, this is obvious, but like it, it, this past week really drove

708
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:09,902
the point home, like how reliant we are on systems and how there is like a single

709
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:12,683
node of failure that shuts everything down.

710
00:45:12,764 --> 00:45:17,986
And then you get the, you know, the cascading failure that you were talking about.

711
00:45:18,587 --> 00:45:22,069
Yeah, and some people say, like, if you get too much into the, if you drink too much of

712
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:26,771
the pepper Kool-Aid, um, the problem is, like, you start preparing for the complete breakdown

713
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:32,755
of society and it takes on this very, like, anarchist kind of everyone out for themselves

714
00:45:32,815 --> 00:45:37,297
mentality where it's like raiders are going to come and, like, eat your flesh and stuff

715
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:40,279
and, and, like, people are going to shoot you and so you got to shoot first.

716
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:42,120
You know, but the other perspective is it's like.

717
00:45:44,862 --> 00:45:47,244
like society doesn't have to be this fragile.

718
00:45:47,284 --> 00:45:50,925
Like we can build a better society that is a little better.

719
00:45:51,105 --> 00:45:54,067
And then at the same time, we can stop waiting for...

720
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:56,708
I really hate this one attitude I have.

721
00:45:57,449 --> 00:45:59,410
I see a lot among otherwise enlightened liberals

722
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,310
that I look up to is when they're like,

723
00:46:01,671 --> 00:46:03,652
it's not worth taking any personal measures.

724
00:46:03,752 --> 00:46:06,093
We just have to like take over the government

725
00:46:06,253 --> 00:46:07,834
and make a perfect society.

726
00:46:07,874 --> 00:46:08,254
And it's like...

727
00:46:08,914 --> 00:46:13,256
I'm not going to feel bad that I'm not going to wait for a perfect society to emerge.

728
00:46:13,816 --> 00:46:18,257
I don't think it's selfish to take care of my family so that I am not a burden on everyone else,

729
00:46:18,657 --> 00:46:21,098
so that I can have some overflow to help my neighbor, right?

730
00:46:21,518 --> 00:46:25,460
It's like if my neighbor is freezing and I'm not in the middle of dying,

731
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,861
I have a warm house she can stay in, right?

732
00:46:28,321 --> 00:46:28,541
You know?

733
00:46:29,891 --> 00:46:36,236
And I think if we focus a little more on the local aspect of government and just society

734
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:40,179
and just helping each other out, I mean I think the term of art is mutual aid,

735
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:48,466
then we can build a more robust, to use the Silicon Valley fancy pants term, anti-fragile society.

736
00:46:50,103 --> 00:46:51,463
Yeah, absolutely.

737
00:46:51,723 --> 00:46:55,645
And that's, it's funny because that's the last point that I wanted to talk

738
00:46:55,685 --> 00:47:00,927
about, about how kind people in my experience during this have been like,

739
00:47:00,947 --> 00:47:07,849
I, like we have local restaurants that are already completely, you know, um,

740
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:14,552
hammered by the pandemic and not being able to, you know, uh, you know, run

741
00:47:14,592 --> 00:47:16,953
business as usual, they're giving away food.

742
00:47:17,493 --> 00:47:22,056
Like, in one of the, so down here we have P. Terry's,

743
00:47:22,296 --> 00:47:24,157
which is like a fast food place.

744
00:47:25,078 --> 00:47:28,701
And there's one that is pretty close to us

745
00:47:29,281 --> 00:47:32,323
and they got a shipment of food.

746
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:37,206
And there was just like, and this was sad,

747
00:47:37,366 --> 00:47:40,008
like there was like a line of cars

748
00:47:41,009 --> 00:47:45,352
just like a couple miles long or whatever.

749
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:46,673
There were a lot of cars.

750
00:47:47,273 --> 00:47:48,614
Going through this fast food

751
00:47:49,435 --> 00:47:51,917
fast food drive-thru and all of those

752
00:47:52,317 --> 00:47:58,923
Represent. I'm just like these aren't people there. You're not gonna wait like, you know hours in line

753
00:47:59,363 --> 00:48:04,887
Because you just want you know a taco like these people must not have food like there

754
00:48:04,968 --> 00:48:08,090
Yeah, there are people who are desperate to get to get food

755
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,252
And one of the things that I read is that,

756
00:48:10,632 --> 00:48:13,494
or actually like that Anna told me,

757
00:48:13,614 --> 00:48:16,416
my wife said that she saw that people

758
00:48:16,696 --> 00:48:18,557
were paying for the people behind them.

759
00:48:18,977 --> 00:48:21,899
Like, and just like going down the line like that.

760
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,641
There's that kind of thing we have,

761
00:48:23,761 --> 00:48:27,583
like people who are offering up,

762
00:48:27,883 --> 00:48:30,545
like, you know, somebody's out of medicine for their kids,

763
00:48:30,865 --> 00:48:32,747
you know, and they're sick and, you know,

764
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,328
you can't go to the pharmacy, but they need it.

765
00:48:35,548 --> 00:48:36,909
Post that on the Facebook group and it's like,

766
00:48:36,949 --> 00:48:37,470
where are you?

767
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:38,250
I'm bringing it there.

768
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:39,491
Do you need anything else?

769
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,052
That type of thing.

770
00:48:41,632 --> 00:48:45,035
And nobody is asking if you voted for Ted Cruz or not

771
00:48:45,275 --> 00:48:47,356
before they extend some help.

772
00:48:48,591 --> 00:48:49,933
We'll deal with that afterwards.

773
00:48:50,154 --> 00:48:52,497
For now, we'll go get you fed.

774
00:48:53,278 --> 00:48:56,963
You know, I'm thankful that, you know, you and your family

775
00:48:57,163 --> 00:49:00,128
and sounds like your community are on the other side of this.

776
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,773
And yeah, I'm just.

777
00:49:05,394 --> 00:49:08,116
Hopefully we all learn something from this.

778
00:49:08,356 --> 00:49:10,397
Just I think we should just close with the fact that this isn't over.

779
00:49:10,497 --> 00:49:13,599
A lot of people that you're not hearing from have it much worse because of survivorship

780
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:15,900
bias because they can't tell you how bad it is.

781
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:20,603
The damage, even once the temperatures are back up and the power is back on and the water

782
00:49:20,623 --> 00:49:23,604
is back on for everyone, the lingering damage is going to last.

783
00:49:24,525 --> 00:49:28,929
I agree with that and everyone out there take care.

784
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:35,815
We'll go back to our regularly scheduled 100% game developer centric conversations next

785
00:49:35,855 --> 00:49:39,338
time and thanks for hanging out with us.

786
00:49:39,379 --> 00:49:39,719
Take care.

787
00:49:39,739 --> 00:49:41,120
Definitely going to play Frostpunk now.

788
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:41,420
Oh yeah.

789
00:49:42,261 --> 00:49:42,541
Oh yeah.
