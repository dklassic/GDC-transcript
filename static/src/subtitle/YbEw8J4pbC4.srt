1
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:06,615
Are we live?

2
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:07,175
Yes, we are live.

3
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:09,555
Thank you everybody for coming.

4
00:00:09,555 --> 00:00:14,036
I just want to remind everybody to check your spam

5
00:00:14,036 --> 00:00:17,617
folder when you get home for the evaluation to fill it out.

6
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:20,157
Otherwise, you will probably not be able to send any

7
00:00:20,157 --> 00:00:21,658
comments in.

8
00:00:21,658 --> 00:00:24,058
I will try to leave about 20 minutes at the end for

9
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:24,878
questions and answers.

10
00:00:24,878 --> 00:00:29,179
In fact, I'm going to speed through a lot of things here

11
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:30,399
just so we do have time at the end.

12
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:35,564
This presentation has got a lot of details in it, and I'm not

13
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:37,965
going to try to cover all of them in detail.

14
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:40,005
So I'm hoping that will inspire your questions.

15
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:40,725
All right.

16
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:44,806
By the way, my title there is a joke.

17
00:00:44,806 --> 00:00:48,587
It was given to me by somebody else, and I didn't care what

18
00:00:48,587 --> 00:00:50,768
my title was, so I've always kept it.

19
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:53,808
Just for your information.

20
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:57,009
And I'm going to preface this by saying that

21
00:00:57,788 --> 00:01:02,531
I will try to give you a feel of the arcade industry, because most of you were not around

22
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:05,412
in the early 1980s to 1985 to really know what it was like.

23
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:09,814
And I also want to preface this by saying it's been 26 years since I've worked on Gauntlet,

24
00:01:09,814 --> 00:01:12,836
so I've forgotten a lot of things.

25
00:01:12,836 --> 00:01:17,998
And more so than that, when I left Atari, I left all my notes behind, so I had a hard

26
00:01:17,998 --> 00:01:20,720
time trying to resurrect everything here.

27
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,482
So anything that I say is wrong or I omitted is probably unintentional.

28
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:31,079
And just to give you some feedback, some history, I

29
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,360
joined Atari in February 1978.

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,305
And after getting in trouble with many of my employers for

31
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,888
doing games and other things on the side, which I shouldn't

32
00:01:39,888 --> 00:01:42,271
have been doing, but I won't go into all the stories now.

33
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:45,214
Atari was located in Sunnyvale, right across from

34
00:01:45,214 --> 00:01:48,418
where I was working at Control Beta, before we moved to

35
00:01:48,418 --> 00:01:49,639
Milpitas a few years later.

36
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:56,134
And just for your information, I listed some of the games I had done, including Super Breakout,

37
00:01:56,134 --> 00:02:02,177
Asteroids, Centipede, Video Pinball, Millipede, Gauntlet and Gauntlet 2, and Steel Talon,

38
00:02:02,177 --> 00:02:02,937
Xybots, etc.

39
00:02:02,937 --> 00:02:05,618
I've also done VCS cartridges.

40
00:02:05,618 --> 00:02:07,559
That was an on-the-side, by the way.

41
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:10,861
My boss did not know about that when I released it.

42
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:15,103
In fact, he caught me the day I was making a patch to the ROMs after they found a bug

43
00:02:15,103 --> 00:02:16,884
and he asked me, what are you doing?

44
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:18,425
Getting in trouble again?

45
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:26,309
Anyway, I left Atari in 1992 to go to EA, the other evil

46
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:27,430
empire, I guess.

47
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,471
But I was there for about 18 months before I decided.

48
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:33,072
I went there to do consumer games, and I didn't do any

49
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:33,552
consumer games.

50
00:02:33,552 --> 00:02:35,672
They wanted me to do coin-op stuff before they finally

51
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:37,113
decided coin-op was not going to work.

52
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:38,894
I could have told them that.

53
00:02:38,894 --> 00:02:43,615
But anyway, after that I left to do consumer games as I

54
00:02:43,615 --> 00:02:47,817
intended, and I included N64 titles of Wayne Gretzky, San

55
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:49,477
Francisco Rush, Rush 2, Rush 2049.

56
00:02:49,973 --> 00:02:52,575
which was also on the Dreamcast, by the way, and Dr.

57
00:02:52,575 --> 00:02:54,276
Mito, which was on three different consoles.

58
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:59,459
And I was actually the last Atari engineer out the door in

59
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:00,980
Milpitas when they shut us down.

60
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,621
So unfortunately, I had to see it all come and go over the

61
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:04,622
entire many years.

62
00:03:04,622 --> 00:03:08,404
Just to give you some interesting information on the

63
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:13,767
Coin-Omp industry, this is a really different industry

64
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:15,128
that you're probably used to.

65
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,442
Because you can do a game, but we actually put it on field test.

66
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:22,044
And if it doesn't get enough quarters, it's as good as dead.

67
00:03:22,044 --> 00:03:26,926
And consider that, it is a pure test of your game.

68
00:03:26,926 --> 00:03:30,888
There's no marketing hype, no promotion, no nothing.

69
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:34,110
And quite honestly, I suspect about 60% of our games

70
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,631
didn't even make it past field test.

71
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:39,152
And even those that did, I would probably

72
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:43,174
guess 10% of them were probably hits and sufficient sales

73
00:03:43,174 --> 00:03:44,915
numbers to actually make it profitable.

74
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:48,593
And quite honestly, some of mine did not succeed either.

75
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:52,034
In fact, I even killed a few, and some I couldn't kill no

76
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:53,834
matter what I tried to do.

77
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,774
Marketing went, oh, just try this.

78
00:03:55,774 --> 00:03:57,515
Oh, just try that.

79
00:03:57,515 --> 00:03:58,095
Doesn't help.

80
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:00,915
And I have this motto of what you see on your first fail

81
00:04:00,915 --> 00:04:03,856
test, unless there's something really bad, is pretty much

82
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:04,936
what you're going to get.

83
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:06,697
But nobody ever listened to me.

84
00:04:10,754 --> 00:04:13,635
The industry is really different than the consumer

85
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:14,255
industry.

86
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,515
We sell to distributors.

87
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:17,836
And there's usually one or two per general area.

88
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:21,277
And the distributors turn around and sell to the

89
00:04:21,277 --> 00:04:24,998
operators, people that actually have the arcades or

90
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,698
send the games around to their street locations.

91
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:28,859
And the operators collect all the money.

92
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:32,480
And the distributors are there just to finance the operators,

93
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,781
to fix the games, and provide whatever services we don't

94
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:37,541
provide to the operators.

95
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:44,776
And for the record, neither Atari nor I got any drop of the coin box.

96
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:49,220
So all those quarters put in, thank you, but I didn't get any of them.

97
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,061
So just think about that.

98
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:56,866
The industry had changed dramatically when I joined in 78, because a hit game like Super

99
00:04:56,866 --> 00:05:01,470
Breakout was maybe 10,000 units, and that was a really good game.

100
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,634
And then by 1979, things like Space Invaders and Asteroids came around.

101
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:09,176
Space Invaders, I heard numbers like 300,000.

102
00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:14,873
I mean, it was so bad in Japan, there was a national shortage of yen because all the

103
00:05:14,873 --> 00:05:16,473
games were basically taken up.

104
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:20,535
Can you imagine all the quarters in the US being in video games and you couldn't get

105
00:05:20,535 --> 00:05:21,815
quarters to do your laundry?

106
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:23,576
That's how bad it was.

107
00:05:23,576 --> 00:05:28,077
In 1981, there was Centipede, again, about 65,000 units.

108
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,458
Asteroids, I think, was about 70,000.

109
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:34,899
Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man probably sold in the 90,000 to 100,000 units each.

110
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:35,259
And then...

111
00:05:38,432 --> 00:05:42,575
1983 came along and the Atari Consumer collapsed.

112
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,077
And I won't go into the details of that, but it did

113
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:46,839
affect the coin-op industry.

114
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:49,761
We were like three buildings, and they were

115
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:50,521
out of 34 at Atari.

116
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:53,724
So that shows you the difference between the coin-op

117
00:05:53,724 --> 00:05:55,765
industry versus the consumer industry at Atari.

118
00:05:57,451 --> 00:06:02,313
But because of that, in 1984, Atari was split into two companies, Atari Inc. and Atari Games.

119
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:06,736
So people have come, oh yes, I played Atari's, they're talking about a VCS.

120
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:11,819
I had nothing to do with this, folks. I'm not even in the same company.

121
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,540
Or the Atari 800 or the ST or whatever.

122
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,602
But we actually had our first layoffs in 1984 because our industry really hit the skids.

123
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:20,183
And what happened here...

124
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:23,463
was that basically we oversaturated the market.

125
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:28,627
We sold games to every arcade, operators put games

126
00:06:28,627 --> 00:06:31,569
into doctors' and dentists' office

127
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,590
simply because they could.

128
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,332
And then there were games everywhere,

129
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:38,113
and there was no place to put new games.

130
00:06:38,113 --> 00:06:42,196
So we actually, the market really collapsed in 84 for us,

131
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:44,358
and we had our first layoffs.

132
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:47,300
And because of the layoffs and everything else,

133
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,402
Atari was actually sold, or 51% of it was sold to Namco.

134
00:06:50,906 --> 00:06:54,109
in 1985. Now, in 1978, most of the business was arcades. We had street locations, but

135
00:06:54,109 --> 00:07:05,178
by 1983, the street locations were really the majority of the sales. You could probably

136
00:07:05,178 --> 00:07:09,202
sell 20,000 maybe to an arcade, but the rest of it, the extra 70,000, 80,000 had to go

137
00:07:09,202 --> 00:07:17,348
to street locations. And the street locations, by 1985,

138
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,354
Basically, you didn't sell anything into them.

139
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:22,355
It was all used games.

140
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:25,117
And the reason for that is the straight operators actually

141
00:07:25,117 --> 00:07:28,379
split the earnings from the game with the location.

142
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:31,461
So if you earned $100 a week, the operator would get $50, and

143
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:34,243
the guy who owned the location would get $50.

144
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:37,986
So it was very hard to get a return on investment for a

145
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:40,347
game that you probably paid $2,500 for.

146
00:07:40,347 --> 00:07:41,068
Just do the math.

147
00:07:41,068 --> 00:07:42,709
It takes a long time to get a return on

148
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:43,650
investment with that.

149
00:07:46,028 --> 00:07:48,290
A lot of people have asked me how did some of these game

150
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,211
ideas come about.

151
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:53,114
And there are primarily three ways.

152
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:55,736
We had brainstorming sessions once a year where we got

153
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:58,999
together and just talked about whatever ideas we

154
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:00,340
could come up with.

155
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,243
And generally, I did not find them very useful.

156
00:08:03,243 --> 00:08:05,925
But one game did come out of that.

157
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:08,387
I had a new hire, and I wanted to give her a project.

158
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,409
And so I picked a game called Bug Shooter and

159
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:11,430
turned it into Centipede.

160
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:15,889
But that's one of the only game ideas I ever got out of the brainstorming session.

161
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:18,452
Managers also had ideas that would come to me and say,

162
00:08:18,452 --> 00:08:22,976
you know, I had this idea for a game, and that's how Asteroids came about.

163
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:25,278
There's a lot of rains, and they'd say, I got this idea for a game.

164
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:31,363
And a lot of times we come up with our own ideas, and that's how Gauntlet came about.

165
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:35,227
I'm going to explain a little bit later where the ideas came about.

166
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,524
You know, Xibots, for example, was a game that I was thinking about Doom, and I said,

167
00:08:41,524 --> 00:08:45,908
you know, we don't have bitmap hardware, but I bet you I can do a first-person shooter

168
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:47,530
like that using just stamps.

169
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,692
And so that's how Xibots came about.

170
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:52,775
It was just a proof to myself I could do a game like that using stamp hardware.

171
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:56,118
So that's some idea where the games came from.

172
00:08:56,118 --> 00:09:01,203
Now about Gauntlet, you know, my son had been playing DD for a long time.

173
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,563
And he wanted me to do a D&D game.

174
00:09:03,563 --> 00:09:05,524
For the life of me, I couldn't figure out how to do it.

175
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:07,864
So I'd been thinking about it for a year.

176
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:10,465
I thought, how can I do a D&D game?

177
00:09:10,465 --> 00:09:13,806
And then I played Dandy on the Atari 800.

178
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:17,368
And sort of the bells went off and said, ah, I know how I can

179
00:09:17,368 --> 00:09:17,628
do it.

180
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:21,129
So we actually started a design in September 30 of 1983.

181
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:26,651
So this is when Robin Ziegler and I actually did a design

182
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:27,691
for Gauntlet.

183
00:09:29,505 --> 00:09:33,107
For those of you who are not familiar, Dandy, this is what Dandy looked like.

184
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:37,069
The players, you had up to four players, and usually the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, and you'll

185
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:41,212
see on the screen in there, it's a one-player game and one is sitting right in the middle.

186
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:46,335
The nice thing about it, the great idea I got out of this game was the monster generators,

187
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,796
and I thought that was really interesting.

188
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:51,938
It had keys and doors and treasure, which would happen with any D&D game anyway.

189
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:53,359
Here was actually the first game design document.

190
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:01,332
that we did.

191
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:03,052
I won't pull it out.

192
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:04,953
It's actually quite large.

193
00:10:04,953 --> 00:10:11,334
It has very interesting pictures of all the play fields,

194
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:14,434
standard D&D pieces or kits you use to gather and build

195
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:14,694
play fields.

196
00:10:14,694 --> 00:10:17,935
But the important thing to look at this was the data on that.

197
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,455
We actually did a design.

198
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:22,936
And about a couple months later, we actually

199
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:24,096
had a marketing review.

200
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:27,217
And they sort of said, yeah, yeah, go ahead, do it.

201
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:38,870
This was our first proof that we could do characters, and this was actually dated January

202
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,871
of 1984, just prior to that review.

203
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:46,515
This particular, it was in color, but I no longer had access to the original artwork.

204
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:49,838
This was a Xerox copy of a Xerox copy that I had done long ago.

205
00:10:49,838 --> 00:10:52,980
But it was just our first proof of concept.

206
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,584
So you can see already what the characters looked like back in basically 83 and early 84.

207
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:04,512
These in particular ones were medium res, and I'll get into that more later, because

208
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:07,034
the game was actually not a medium res game at all.

209
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:12,439
One thing you do realize when you look this over is the names of the games change.

210
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:19,805
So if I refer to the Hulk sometime in here, it's really the Warrior, or the same with

211
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:20,426
the Valkyrie.

212
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:25,690
It was in the Amazon, so I'll probably intertwine those two in the game.

213
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,392
And I can't tell you why the names changed.

214
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:30,879
I can't even for the life of me think why it changed.

215
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,201
But somehow, somewhere along the line, they did change.

216
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:40,365
Now the coin-op industry itself in 1985 was in a tough boat because everything was 25

217
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:41,626
cents per play.

218
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:50,252
Now you expected to play 90 to 2 minutes, 3 minutes at tops, but there was extremely

219
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,453
large resistances.

220
00:11:51,453 --> 00:11:54,595
You put a game out of 50 cent play, man, that was a kiss of death.

221
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:56,556
That would kill a game so fast.

222
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,447
And the dollar coin, of course, had been tried, and that had failed miserably.

223
00:12:00,447 --> 00:12:05,692
Everybody had hoped that the dollar coin had induced multiple plays and it would work,

224
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,134
but it did not work.

225
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:11,137
So the question came out of how do you get extra earnings out of a game,

226
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:15,221
because as the game hardware got more expensive, you need to make more money, etc., etc.

227
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:18,304
So how are we going to do this?

228
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:18,624
Well...

229
00:12:19,356 --> 00:12:23,319
here this game came along and sort of, you know, Eureka, everything works.

230
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:26,681
Not only that, I can get four players to play at the same time.

231
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:30,184
So basically, they're playing for a dollar for two minutes.

232
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:33,326
Now that's four times better than any other game out there,

233
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:36,548
except games like Ripoff and stuff where you get two players simultaneous.

234
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:42,212
But this is a really revolutionary idea that sort of hit home for me.

235
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:46,541
And there's some other really good parts of it too, because players can come and go at

236
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,643
any time, so you're basically always planning four players playing.

237
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:53,827
You don't have this one player and then a few players die off and then you have to wait

238
00:12:53,827 --> 00:12:56,409
for everybody to die off before you join in.

239
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,511
That's no longer necessary.

240
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,314
And there was no dead time at the start of a game, where you usually bring up the game

241
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,977
very slowly, sort of saying, this is how to do this, this is how to do that.

242
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:07,598
You don't have to do that anymore.

243
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:12,302
People can hop right in and, you know, if you don't know by now, then you'll die soon

244
00:13:12,302 --> 00:13:12,622
enough.

245
00:13:14,482 --> 00:13:17,844
or everybody will tell you how to do it, which is usually what happens.

246
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:25,689
And what really was interesting in this game, players put in more than one coin at a time,

247
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:28,510
and that was really unusual for the time.

248
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:35,474
Now we had a lot of problems with design issues up front, partly because of the differences

249
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:39,457
of opinion between myself and Robin Ziegler.

250
00:13:39,457 --> 00:13:42,678
We went through, of course, the horizontal-vertical monitor, which way do you want to do it.

251
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:47,887
There were a lot of reasons, and I won't go into all the details here, whether we should

252
00:13:47,887 --> 00:13:50,249
do interlaced video or non-interlaced video.

253
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:54,112
Everything at this point was non-interlaced video.

254
00:13:54,112 --> 00:13:57,655
I have a real problem with interlaced video when you're standing this close to a monitor

255
00:13:57,655 --> 00:14:00,057
because the flicker just drives me nuts.

256
00:14:00,057 --> 00:14:03,559
So I really did not want to do interlaced video, but it would make things look a little

257
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:03,820
better.

258
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,913
Medium res was coming into Vogue at the time, and there was really a large push to do it,

259
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:15,258
but operators are really sensitive to money, and to add a medium res game you're adding

260
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:21,862
about $300 to the hardware, plus another, well at least $300 to the hardware, and additional

261
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:22,943
ROMs and stuff like that.

262
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:28,627
Also at this time they were just coming into 25 inch monitors.

263
00:14:28,627 --> 00:14:32,309
The 19 inch was standard, and 25 inch monitors were $100.

264
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:36,190
and reliability was not there yet.

265
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,892
So all the way through the project, right up to the first

266
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:42,714
field test, it was supposed to be a 25 inch monitor, but the

267
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:45,315
game actually shipped with a 19 inch.

268
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:47,176
We had other things coming along, like the personal

269
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:48,377
memory device.

270
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:50,378
Marketing was saying, here, we want to sell

271
00:14:50,378 --> 00:14:52,019
these to every player.

272
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:53,560
They can get customization.

273
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,242
They can plug it into the game.

274
00:14:56,242 --> 00:14:59,224
And I took one look at that and said, no way, man.

275
00:14:59,224 --> 00:15:01,745
First time bubble gum, sticking in the hole.

276
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:04,873
PMD is deader than tornado.

277
00:15:04,873 --> 00:15:08,814
Besides, who's going to pay $10 for something that not

278
00:15:08,814 --> 00:15:10,114
every game in the world has?

279
00:15:10,114 --> 00:15:13,575
Because unless everybody has it, nobody's going to do it.

280
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:15,196
So that one died.

281
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:19,917
And I actually had a large fight with my boss over that,

282
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:21,717
because he really wanted to push it.

283
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:26,838
Now, in those days, I'd been doing 6502 programming all the

284
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:27,859
way up till late 1984.

285
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:32,940
So this was my first time I'd actually done C programming.

286
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:40,187
using a processor other than a 6502. It wasn't new to Atari, but it was new to me. And we

287
00:15:40,187 --> 00:15:47,269
were using a VAX mainframe to do all our cross-compiles and our X-Terminals or our VT-100s for our

288
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:50,530
terminals at that point. And that was actually new to me, too.

289
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:56,831
The strange thing was, you know, people say, oh, I've got this 8 MHz processor, and that's

290
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:01,972
so much better than my 1 MHz 6502. No, it's not. It's eight cycles per instruction, buddy.

291
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:09,616
and a 68010. It's basically the same speed as a 6502. All you've got is bigger registers.

292
00:16:09,616 --> 00:16:14,979
You don't really have anything much better. This is where I get hit with the old megahertz

293
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:21,564
syndrome. Oh, I've got more megahertz. Nope. 6502 is one cycle for a lot of instructions,

294
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:25,026
guy. I can still run circles around you if you do 8-bit or math.

295
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:29,930
We used the Greenhills compiler at that time.

296
00:16:30,138 --> 00:16:35,542
I don't think for this project, but later on I actually wrote a post compiler that would

297
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:40,285
take the Green Hills output and basically delete about 20 percent of the instructions

298
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:45,889
because we always ran at 60 hertz, and if we didn't run at 60 hertz, boy, your reputation

299
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:46,709
was shot.

300
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:50,012
So we wanted to get everything we could out of it.

301
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:56,116
And really a 1 megahertz processor is not a lot of horsepower when you want to do things

302
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:56,556
at 60 hertz.

303
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:59,418
It basically gives you 16 milliseconds to do everything.

304
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:06,793
Now, Gauntlet had a lot of motion objects, so I didn't want to spend a lot of time basically

305
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:07,554
moving things around.

306
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:13,257
But standard resolution games at that time were 320 by 240 pixels.

307
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:18,139
That's not a lot compared to what you're probably used to now.

308
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:21,181
We'd actually graduated up to 56 motion objects.

309
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:23,562
That's 56 objects total.

310
00:17:23,562 --> 00:17:27,825
So if it wasn't on your scan line, still counted, buddy.

311
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:29,528
even though it wasn't being drawn.

312
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:30,348
It could only draw 56.

313
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:33,411
We actually had three layers of graphics.

314
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:38,915
We had the alphanumerics on top, we had a play field on the bottom, and sprites that

315
00:17:38,915 --> 00:17:39,856
could run in between.

316
00:17:39,856 --> 00:17:43,018
So those are our sprites or motion objects in between.

317
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:47,642
So those are how we did everything in our game up to that time, and even for a long

318
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:48,483
time thereafter.

319
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:51,685
And all our color was using color palettes.

320
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:55,468
We no longer had, we did not have a 16-bit or a 32-bit color space.

321
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:57,370
It was all color palettes.

322
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,084
Well, the system, whoops, this was too far.

323
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:09,028
System 1 board was the board of choice about 1984.

324
00:18:09,028 --> 00:18:11,991
It was a new system they were putting together.

325
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:15,254
And it had a 6502 that was running about twice the speed

326
00:18:15,254 --> 00:18:17,436
of what the Gauntlet finally showed up with.

327
00:18:17,436 --> 00:18:20,239
Standard resolution, the 56 motion, I'll be saying,

328
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:22,721
alphanumeric play field, scrolling play field,

329
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:26,125
color palettes that I just mentioned, and everything else.

330
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:32,159
It had an extensive audio system that far beyond what I'd been used to before.

331
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:37,043
It had a separate processor to run it, and you had a FM synthesis.

332
00:18:37,043 --> 00:18:42,208
We had a Poky chip, which was the same chip that used the audio for the Atari 800, 400,

333
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,589
if you're familiar with that.

334
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:47,732
And it was primarily there not only for sound effects, but it was for security, because

335
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:50,795
anybody who wanted to copy our game, they had to go find our custom chip.

336
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:54,317
And so often what they do is they go and get by an 800, tear it apart, and just pull out

337
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:55,919
the chip just to copy our board.

338
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,754
I showed you how desperate they were.

339
00:18:59,754 --> 00:19:02,556
And we actually had a speech chip for the first time.

340
00:19:02,556 --> 00:19:03,997
So this is the very first time that I actually

341
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:04,718
had a speech chip.

342
00:19:04,718 --> 00:19:07,940
And this is, again, as I said, by far the most elaborate

343
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,581
hardware that we had.

344
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:15,265
Again, when we get to Gauntlet hardware, it's pretty much

345
00:19:15,265 --> 00:19:19,208
the same, but I wanted to do 1,000 motion objects.

346
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:24,251
So I wanted to add a lot more to it, which meant we needed

347
00:19:24,251 --> 00:19:26,433
to add a lot to the hardware board.

348
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:35,220
To give you some idea, I'll get into more of this later, the design hardware was huge.

349
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:41,464
The system one board is a 18 inch by 18 inch motherboard with a 10 by 18 inch cartridge

350
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:46,126
board where you put all your EPROMs and game-specific stuff.

351
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:50,789
And so it was going to be huge.

352
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,811
But our final board actually came out considerably smaller, and I'll explain why.

353
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:56,272
But this is a system one board.

354
00:19:57,147 --> 00:20:01,130
So it's about 28, that's almost 28 by 20 inches.

355
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,712
And we need to expand that, and we needed to actually

356
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:06,334
mount it on the inside of a cabinet, which was going to be

357
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:06,795
a real trick.

358
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:09,417
We didn't know how to do that.

359
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,779
But this is the final gauntlet board.

360
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:15,081
It's less than 21 inches long and about 11 and 1

361
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:15,722
1⁄2 inches tall.

362
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:18,004
And as you see, it's tightly packed.

363
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:20,686
And the way we did that is we went to a four-layer board.

364
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,707
And this is the first time.

365
00:20:24,902 --> 00:20:30,485
Atari had even considered it. I got a lot of flack for suggesting it, because the price

366
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:36,167
for a blank PC board was almost twice what a two-layer board was, but we didn't have

367
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:40,969
any other way. There were other problems, too. Our CAD system couldn't lay it out.

368
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:45,291
I mean, you were trying to put two traces between pins on an IC, and it's like, we

369
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:49,573
don't have software to do that. So they eventually had to resolve that.

370
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:54,095
We also had our manufacturing facility had auto-insertion.

371
00:20:54,596 --> 00:21:00,101
tools. And the out-insertion wouldn't work in some places on the board, because we actually

372
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:04,965
had to get smaller resistors and things to actually fit. So there were a lot of manufacturing

373
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:10,550
problems with this, too. But once we resolved those, all our boards after Gauntlet were

374
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:15,514
done as four-layer boards. So we sort of pioneered that as far as manufacturing goes.

375
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:21,216
As I mentioned, we started this in 1983,

376
00:21:21,216 --> 00:21:24,797
but the game didn't actually come out until October of 1985.

377
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:27,038
So of course, what happened?

378
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:29,759
Well, there were layoffs, and we lost Robin Ziegler.

379
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,620
My hardware engineer was supposed to do my hardware,

380
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,820
got stuck on Temple of Doom.

381
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,381
And for all of 84, I basically had no hardware engineer.

382
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,262
And then they asked me to do a game in between.

383
00:21:41,262 --> 00:21:43,323
Of course, I couldn't do Gauntlet.

384
00:21:43,323 --> 00:21:45,663
So I ended up doing Road Runner as a video disc game.

385
00:21:45,663 --> 00:21:47,604
But come late 84, they said.

386
00:21:48,812 --> 00:21:53,374
Well, after many field tests, by the way, it was not bad enough to kill it, not good

387
00:21:53,374 --> 00:21:54,255
enough to ship it.

388
00:21:54,255 --> 00:21:57,316
They said, we want you to convert it to system one.

389
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,217
And I said, no way.

390
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:59,697
Get somebody else to do that.

391
00:21:59,697 --> 00:22:01,018
I have another game in mind.

392
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:04,519
And so that's when I went and started work on Gauntlet.

393
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:09,262
So if you see the Roadrunner Visitor Disk game, that's a real rare thing.

394
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:12,383
There's probably somebody with a copy of the disk.

395
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:14,764
It actually had real Chuck Jones cartoons, by the way.

396
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:21,189
So in February of 1985, we actually started Gauntlet

397
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:21,449
again.

398
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:24,912
At that point, Pat McCarthy was the engineer, and he

399
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:26,774
actually started designing the board.

400
00:22:26,774 --> 00:22:31,158
And Bob Flanagan joined me as the other software engineer.

401
00:22:31,158 --> 00:22:34,040
And I took over as project leader from Chris Downen in

402
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,400
March of 85.

403
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,902
So here's the development team.

404
00:22:35,902 --> 00:22:38,544
So you'll notice there's about two programmers.

405
00:22:38,544 --> 00:22:44,649
I've got four artists, four or five artists, one engineer,

406
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:46,070
one technician, part-time.

407
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:49,843
And I had three audio people working on the game, also part

408
00:22:49,843 --> 00:22:50,043
time.

409
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:54,166
So this would be a fairly large project for

410
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,027
CoinUp at that time.

411
00:22:55,027 --> 00:22:56,648
And as you mentioned, or I may have mentioned, the game, or

412
00:22:56,648 --> 00:23:00,130
if you noticed on that first slide I showed you, the game

413
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,913
name actually has changed quite a bit.

414
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:06,515
It was originally called Dungeons.

415
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:10,578
And if you actually go and look at the source code,

416
00:23:10,578 --> 00:23:14,080
you'll find it's in a folder called DND.

417
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:17,943
Unfortunately, in April of 85, we did the name search,

418
00:23:17,943 --> 00:23:21,546
and lawyers came back and said, you can't use Dungeons.

419
00:23:21,546 --> 00:23:24,308
So for a few weeks, I madly pulled out game ideas.

420
00:23:24,308 --> 00:23:27,170
But I don't remember who suggested Gauntlet, but that

421
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,693
was finally decided on May of 1985.

422
00:23:30,693 --> 00:23:33,255
And I don't have the list of the game names that we

423
00:23:33,255 --> 00:23:35,737
actually looked at at that time.

424
00:23:35,737 --> 00:23:38,038
But Gauntlet really stuck out to me, because you can run the

425
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:39,259
Gauntlet, et cetera, et cetera.

426
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:42,001
So it seemed like a really good choice of games, and

427
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:43,563
pretty much that's what the game play was.

428
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:46,851
You're doing the whole time is running the gauntlet.

429
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:50,153
Of course, marketing had their problems.

430
00:23:50,153 --> 00:23:56,577
I always have fun dealing with marketing.

431
00:23:56,577 --> 00:24:00,559
First thing, they come up and say, can you get four players

432
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:00,959
to play together?

433
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:01,580
I said, sure, no problem.

434
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,062
Of course, you're never sure, but it certainly worked for

435
00:24:05,062 --> 00:24:05,642
the engineers.

436
00:24:05,642 --> 00:24:07,123
And so I don't see why not.

437
00:24:07,123 --> 00:24:08,644
They had other problems, too.

438
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:12,466
They said, well, would one or two players play if there was

439
00:24:12,466 --> 00:24:12,667
enough.

440
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:15,249
if you don't have enough for four.

441
00:24:15,249 --> 00:24:17,630
Come up with lots of things to worry about.

442
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,653
One thing I did worry about was quite legit, was we have

443
00:24:21,653 --> 00:24:22,653
coin mechs.

444
00:24:22,653 --> 00:24:24,534
And coin mechs jam often.

445
00:24:24,534 --> 00:24:26,936
They're often problematic.

446
00:24:26,936 --> 00:24:30,298
And we actually stuck two coin doors on the game to have

447
00:24:30,298 --> 00:24:32,579
four coin mechs, one per player, because that was the

448
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:35,181
only way we could figure out it to equitably.

449
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,541
distribute the coins, because we talked about inserting coins and then deciding who gets

450
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:43,801
the coins, and it's like, no.

451
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:44,561
Let's keep it simple.

452
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:47,162
If you stick it in your coin slot, it's yours.

453
00:24:47,162 --> 00:24:51,603
If your coin slot's broken, well, you play a three-player game.

454
00:24:51,603 --> 00:24:55,183
But it took me a long time to get that through.

455
00:24:55,183 --> 00:25:01,825
Now the actual game itself is actually laid out in a 1024x1024 pixel world.

456
00:25:02,447 --> 00:25:08,469
and that's actually the size of the scrolling playfield that's the RAM for underneath.

457
00:25:08,469 --> 00:25:12,370
So the scrolling registers that we had, I could scroll through that whole universe and

458
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:17,252
actually I could even wrap around so I could, you could see part of the top and the bottom

459
00:25:17,252 --> 00:25:24,934
and left and right and so on. The game was set up so that I would force the players that

460
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:28,755
they couldn't walk off screen and that's for obvious reasons. If you walk off screen you're

461
00:25:28,755 --> 00:25:30,396
going to get lost and you can't get back on.

462
00:25:30,773 --> 00:25:31,934
That's not fair to the player.

463
00:25:31,934 --> 00:25:33,895
So I'd always stop the players at the edge of the screen.

464
00:25:33,895 --> 00:25:37,236
And I'd always make sure the scrolling was such that you'd

465
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:38,977
try to be as fair as possible, depending

466
00:25:38,977 --> 00:25:39,817
where the players are.

467
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:41,958
So if one guy wants to run off, then he scrolls everybody

468
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,079
over, and everybody says, no, no, no.

469
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:43,699
Stop screwing with us.

470
00:25:43,699 --> 00:25:44,339
Come over here.

471
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:46,500
So it's part of the competitive, cooperative

472
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:46,940
aspect of the game.

473
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,781
The collision algorithm is rather problematic.

474
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:51,202
Again, I couldn't do collision on 1,000 objects moving.

475
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:03,639
Basically, I only moved the objects that were visible

476
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:04,559
that everybody could see.

477
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,121
I do not move objects that were off the screen.

478
00:26:07,121 --> 00:26:09,882
But I didn't have the compute power to do

479
00:26:09,882 --> 00:26:11,103
all those at 60 hertz.

480
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:14,245
So I came up with this elaborate, not so elaborate,

481
00:26:14,245 --> 00:26:17,727
this simple method to break the world into 16 by 16 grids.

482
00:26:17,727 --> 00:26:21,470
Now, all the characters are really 24 by 24 pixels large.

483
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,891
So there's always some overlap.

484
00:26:23,891 --> 00:26:26,733
It's OK to have shoulders overlapping or weapons

485
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:27,333
overlapping.

486
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:27,794
That's fine.

487
00:26:28,592 --> 00:26:31,714
But basically it's a 16 by 16 grid, and everybody belongs to

488
00:26:31,714 --> 00:26:33,315
one of the grids.

489
00:26:33,315 --> 00:26:36,356
So that if you want to move, you only need to check, let's

490
00:26:36,356 --> 00:26:38,977
say you want to move right or diagonal, upper right, you

491
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:41,319
only need to check a couple neighbors.

492
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:45,541
You only need to worry about a few things.

493
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:50,703
The walls were also part of the grid so that you could

494
00:26:50,703 --> 00:26:52,504
check against walls as well.

495
00:26:54,722 --> 00:26:57,663
I also had a method in there for sliding.

496
00:26:57,663 --> 00:27:00,704
So if you wanted to move diagonal left, but there was

497
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:03,624
something in the way, you would just turn around and it

498
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:04,965
would actually slide up there.

499
00:27:04,965 --> 00:27:07,505
So whether it's a wall or another player, you'll see

500
00:27:07,505 --> 00:27:09,326
everything slide in that direction.

501
00:27:09,326 --> 00:27:12,086
Shots were a little different.

502
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:14,727
And yeah, you can check with that.

503
00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:18,028
But once the object moved more than eight or so pixels, you'd

504
00:27:18,028 --> 00:27:20,328
reassign it to the off the center of the grid.

505
00:27:20,328 --> 00:27:23,149
You'd assign it to the next grid if it were available.

506
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:23,989
If it were not available.

507
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:31,787
that you wouldn't move. So every now and then you see gaps where things do this, and that's

508
00:27:31,787 --> 00:27:35,750
the reason for that.

509
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:41,975
There are times in the game where shots could actually go through diagonals, slots in the

510
00:27:41,975 --> 00:27:47,060
wall. Now, some shots are wider than others, so you couldn't shoot through them, so that

511
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:52,184
was quite intentional, and I made it such that it would differentiate the players that

512
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:52,284
way.

513
00:27:53,587 --> 00:27:58,628
The real problem with the hardware was the fact that I only had 56 motion objects that

514
00:27:58,628 --> 00:28:02,389
I had to display per line. So I needed to figure out how to make sure I got the right

515
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:09,570
56. And the idea was to come up with what we call starting link pointers. And so here

516
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:14,331
was, for every eight scan lines, I had a pointer that would say, here's the first object I

517
00:28:14,331 --> 00:28:18,753
want you to look at. And all the objects were linked together. And it was through this grid

518
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:20,633
process that I'd link everything together.

519
00:28:23,974 --> 00:28:28,558
We also did something very different with this particular hardware, and I'll go ahead

520
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,861
and mention it now, because, as I mentioned earlier, if a motion object was not visible

521
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:36,964
or a portion was not visible, it still counted as a motion object drawn.

522
00:28:36,964 --> 00:28:41,168
And I wanted to better that, and the engineer came up with an idea to

523
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,282
sort of do a look ahead, look and say,

524
00:28:44,282 --> 00:28:46,763
oh, that object's a little low, he's not being drawn.

525
00:28:46,763 --> 00:28:49,144
Count it as a half cycle, go to the next object.

526
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,806
So you could actually do more than 56 motion objects

527
00:28:52,806 --> 00:28:54,406
per scan line using that method.

528
00:28:54,406 --> 00:28:57,768
And that was one of the nice features of Gauntlet,

529
00:28:57,768 --> 00:29:00,529
because if you've ever seen it every now and then,

530
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:03,671
you'll see things twinkle when there's full of ghosts

531
00:29:03,671 --> 00:29:06,612
or something on the screen, and that's the reason why.

532
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:08,853
It's just I can't display more than 56.

533
00:29:08,853 --> 00:29:10,314
But there are times when it does happen.

534
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:16,812
And so the starting link pointer and this grid, collision grid, are all totally linked.

535
00:29:16,812 --> 00:29:23,577
So I had exactly the objects that would be visible in that set of things for that particular

536
00:29:23,577 --> 00:29:25,078
set of eight scan lines.

537
00:29:26,146 --> 00:29:29,927
And also the slips were linked to the scrolling play field.

538
00:29:29,927 --> 00:29:32,908
So if I scroll the play field up and down, they'd be tied to

539
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:33,949
the real play field.

540
00:29:33,949 --> 00:29:36,770
Normal starting link pointers, you'd have to redo every scan

541
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,271
line's link pointers.

542
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:39,371
And I did not have to do that.

543
00:29:39,371 --> 00:29:40,872
It was all saving.

544
00:29:40,872 --> 00:29:43,292
It's very easy to do in hardware, just add the scroll

545
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:45,033
counter to the position.

546
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:50,735
But for the processor side, it was a real saving for me.

547
00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:57,821
Now, enemy movement was kind of very simplistic.

548
00:29:57,821 --> 00:30:00,584
Basically, you walk to the closest player next to him.

549
00:30:00,584 --> 00:30:04,687
And that was for a lot of strategic reasons.

550
00:30:04,687 --> 00:30:06,949
Some guy to act as a decoy, so everybody comes to him.

551
00:30:06,949 --> 00:30:09,691
Well, he goes around and shoots them.

552
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:11,512
And that, I think, came from Dandy.

553
00:30:11,512 --> 00:30:16,196
And I thought that was a very, very nice aspect of the game.

554
00:30:16,196 --> 00:30:17,777
Allows for very cooperative play.

555
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:26,046
Now, controls I thought were fairly simple.

556
00:30:26,046 --> 00:30:28,347
And I don't know where I came up with these, if they came

557
00:30:28,347 --> 00:30:31,528
from Dandy or if they came from some other game.

558
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:34,789
But basically, you either move or you can shoot.

559
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:36,970
And since I did not want to do a Robotron controls where you

560
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,951
have double joysticks, I wanted to keep it real simple.

561
00:30:39,912 --> 00:30:41,852
If you're shooting, you don't move.

562
00:30:41,852 --> 00:30:43,293
So you can use the joystick to tell you

563
00:30:43,293 --> 00:30:44,633
where you're shooting.

564
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:46,374
Otherwise, you take the hand off the shot button.

565
00:30:46,374 --> 00:30:47,474
You can move away.

566
00:30:47,474 --> 00:30:50,535
So either stand and shoot, or you get to move.

567
00:30:50,535 --> 00:30:53,316
It's a nice strategic choice, because you have to decide to

568
00:30:53,316 --> 00:30:54,196
do one or the other.

569
00:30:54,196 --> 00:30:55,777
And there are certainly reasons for doing so.

570
00:30:55,777 --> 00:30:58,457
And of course, magic was the extra button, which was sort

571
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:00,218
of the super zapper, as it were, if you're

572
00:31:00,218 --> 00:31:00,698
familiar with Tempest.

573
00:31:00,698 --> 00:31:02,039
We did have a maze editor to deal with all of this stuff.

574
00:31:08,735 --> 00:31:10,717
And all of the levels were created.

575
00:31:10,717 --> 00:31:13,921
And I went on a six-week sabbatical right after the

576
00:31:13,921 --> 00:31:15,122
first field test.

577
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:17,745
Atari had this wonderful plan for sabbaticals, so I took six

578
00:31:17,745 --> 00:31:19,807
weeks off and took off to Alaska, where

579
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:21,429
I couldn't be reached.

580
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:25,753
So Bob Flanagan took over and dealt with the field tests,

581
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:27,895
and as well as getting all these levels together.

582
00:31:27,895 --> 00:31:29,597
And we actually had 100 levels built up.

583
00:31:31,702 --> 00:31:35,624
And I actually had to compress the levels because I didn't have all the extra ROMs.

584
00:31:35,624 --> 00:31:37,065
It was a very simple algorithm.

585
00:31:37,065 --> 00:31:41,027
But there was somebody who called himself the Orange Elf

586
00:31:41,027 --> 00:31:44,288
at one point who sent me a bunch of brand new compressed levels.

587
00:31:44,288 --> 00:31:49,250
So he had actually disassembled the code, figured out the algorithm,

588
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,812
built his own levels and reprogrammed the EPROMs

589
00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:55,433
and had his own gauntlet game with his own set of levels.

590
00:31:55,433 --> 00:31:57,154
I thought that was kind of interesting.

591
00:31:59,573 --> 00:32:02,817
One of the marketing problems that they had was that there's no end to this game.

592
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:05,520
And I was saying, well, you know, what are you going to do?

593
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,164
And I was going to say, well, I'm not going to kill their quarters.

594
00:32:09,164 --> 00:32:10,846
This guy may have put five, ten bucks in.

595
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,548
I'm not going to sell him. Sorry, thank you.

596
00:32:12,548 --> 00:32:15,391
That's going to really piss a few people off.

597
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:19,116
So I had a real problem telling marketing, well, this is the way it's going to be.

598
00:32:22,355 --> 00:32:24,757
But it was an interesting way to recycle levels.

599
00:32:24,757 --> 00:32:27,319
The first seven levels were just a teaching level to get

600
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:27,580
you through.

601
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:31,443
And after eight levels and beyond, they were what appeared

602
00:32:31,443 --> 00:32:32,785
to be random, they were not random.

603
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,907
I had a prime number of levels.

604
00:32:34,907 --> 00:32:37,049
I picked some arbitrary starting level.

605
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:41,073
I picked some arbitrary number of random number between that

606
00:32:41,073 --> 00:32:42,514
and the number of levels remaining.

607
00:32:42,901 --> 00:32:47,146
and I increment the level number by that number and that guarantees you you can play all the levels.

608
00:32:47,146 --> 00:32:51,632
Now when you get through them all, what I do is start doing is start horizontal flipping, vertical flipping,

609
00:32:51,632 --> 00:32:55,697
so they don't quite look the same, they look similar but not quite the same.

610
00:32:55,697 --> 00:32:57,499
So it was a good way of doing that.

611
00:32:58,568 --> 00:33:02,571
There were high scores in this game, and I do not remember how they worked, whether it

612
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:02,931
was per coin.

613
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:06,834
Because I remember we had large discussions of, well, people are just going to buy their

614
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:09,876
way on to the high score table by putting more coins in and doing this.

615
00:33:09,876 --> 00:33:14,980
And I thought I did it on a per coin basis, but I don't remember.

616
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,682
And so somebody will certainly correct me, I'm sure, at some point.

617
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:24,126
I don't remember who suggested the Dungeon Master.

618
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,021
I wish I knew.

619
00:33:28,021 --> 00:33:31,662
I don't even have a list of all the phrases we had together at one point either, but I

620
00:33:31,662 --> 00:33:38,605
do know Earl Vickers actually contracted Ernie to do all the voice for us.

621
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:40,306
Now he's apparently well known.

622
00:33:40,306 --> 00:33:42,627
He's done Hardware Wars and a bunch of other titles.

623
00:33:42,627 --> 00:33:46,048
I don't know them, but a lot of people say, oh yeah, yeah, I know him.

624
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:47,488
He did a lot of stuff.

625
00:33:47,488 --> 00:33:51,170
But he actually did the voices on Gauntlet, just for your information.

626
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,511
We have a security problem in CoinUp because you publish a

627
00:33:57,511 --> 00:33:59,512
game, the first time it earns a lot of money, people go in

628
00:33:59,512 --> 00:34:02,794
and say, I'll turn around, sell them for half the price,

629
00:34:02,794 --> 00:34:05,595
and just copy the board as is.

630
00:34:05,595 --> 00:34:07,636
And unfortunately, that happened.

631
00:34:07,636 --> 00:34:11,618
They did that on Gauntlet, despite our security purposes.

632
00:34:11,618 --> 00:34:14,779
As I mentioned earlier, they went out and ripped off old

633
00:34:14,779 --> 00:34:17,701
400s and 800s and pulled out the Pokey chip, found a way

634
00:34:17,701 --> 00:34:22,603
around our Slapchick, which is our security chip, and it was

635
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:23,443
just unfortunate.

636
00:34:24,617 --> 00:34:28,399
Now, for your information, I've been called into a lot of cases where we actually went

637
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,362
and tried to sue these people, and it was a very interesting story.

638
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:37,026
In Centipede, for example, I went to look at the experts' deposition on some game that

639
00:34:37,026 --> 00:34:40,988
was copied of Centipede, and the guy said, well, basically, the art looked different

640
00:34:40,988 --> 00:34:42,690
so therefore it's a different game.

641
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:46,753
And I dumped the ROMs for their game and my game, and except for a few places, the game

642
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:47,573
ROMs are identical.

643
00:34:47,573 --> 00:34:48,874
He just changed the art ROMs.

644
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:53,145
I don't even know if he even changed the Atari logo on the bottom.

645
00:34:53,145 --> 00:34:53,725
He probably did.

646
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:57,747
He probably changed the copyright Atari on the bottom of the screen that was in text.

647
00:34:57,747 --> 00:35:00,388
So that's probably all he did to the game.

648
00:35:00,388 --> 00:35:03,469
So I would have loved to have gone into court and talked to this guy.

649
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:07,450
A lot of times in the past we'd actually done software security.

650
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:12,592
And if you remember Tempest, there's some, something got through that should not have.

651
00:35:12,592 --> 00:35:15,754
So if you play to get to a certain score, it'll give you 20 free credits.

652
00:35:15,754 --> 00:35:18,254
And that's our software security.

653
00:35:19,426 --> 00:35:22,868
So it got broken and got shipped with it.

654
00:35:22,868 --> 00:35:24,009
As I mentioned already, we had problems with 1925-inch

655
00:35:24,009 --> 00:35:24,209
monitors.

656
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:29,052
There's a real problem with the game because operators had

657
00:35:29,052 --> 00:35:34,876
never seen a game before that didn't have a trackplex or a

658
00:35:34,876 --> 00:35:36,236
plexiglass in front of the monitor.

659
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:38,298
And they're, oh, man, what are we going to do?

660
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:42,551
And basically I told them I didn't want it, because there was always glare.

661
00:35:42,551 --> 00:35:45,032
Every time you put a trackplex down, there's always glare.

662
00:35:45,032 --> 00:35:49,113
And if you've got something that's blocking your corner screen, your player is, it's just not fun.

663
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:53,235
So I really had to force them not to put in a trackplex.

664
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:56,757
And actually operators later came and said, we still want one.

665
00:35:56,757 --> 00:36:03,740
So we actually sold them a kit with eight screws and a piece of plexiglass and said, here, go ahead and do it.

666
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,280
So Mom did, apparently.

667
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,742
There were actually five patents issued by Gauntlet.

668
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:12,340
Some of them doing with the cooperative multiplayer

669
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,101
cooperative play.

670
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:14,302
Some with the collision algorithm.

671
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:15,783
Some with the slips.

672
00:36:15,783 --> 00:36:19,305
And also with the look ahead dealing with the motion object

673
00:36:19,305 --> 00:36:20,225
circuit.

674
00:36:20,225 --> 00:36:21,326
I won't go into any detail.

675
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:24,428
I see I'm running out of time right now.

676
00:36:24,428 --> 00:36:25,649
We often do focus groups.

677
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:31,373
And I really find them almost worthless.

678
00:36:31,373 --> 00:36:33,614
The only thing I really take out of focus group is when

679
00:36:33,614 --> 00:36:36,396
they ask, compare this to your favorite game.

680
00:36:36,396 --> 00:36:37,336
I look at that.

681
00:36:37,336 --> 00:36:39,258
Or the other thing I'll look at is if they come in and

682
00:36:39,258 --> 00:36:39,378
they're.

683
00:36:39,607 --> 00:36:41,828
Oh, oh, oh, oh, let me see this.

684
00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:43,449
OK, that's good.

685
00:36:43,449 --> 00:36:45,230
Rest of it I can throw away.

686
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,453
Now here's a sample, examples I pull off a focus group.

687
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:49,573
The first one here is for asteroids.

688
00:36:49,573 --> 00:36:51,935
They didn't even spell my name right, the game name right.

689
00:36:51,935 --> 00:36:54,237
It shows you what they know.

690
00:36:54,237 --> 00:36:57,179
And they actually rated asteroids less than Lunar

691
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:00,861
Lander, and excuse me, about the same as Lunar Lander, but

692
00:37:00,861 --> 00:37:01,702
less than Starship.

693
00:37:01,702 --> 00:37:03,583
I don't even remember Starship.

694
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:04,304
That shows you where they're going.

695
00:37:09,138 --> 00:37:13,320
And the results actually came back positive on Gauntlet.

696
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,280
I could have told them that.

697
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,383
The one thing that did come out of the focus group is they wanted something to, because

698
00:37:19,383 --> 00:37:22,724
I don't think I had the first seven levels in to teach them how all the different things

699
00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:25,806
work, and so that was the one thing that came out of the focus group for Gauntlet.

700
00:37:25,806 --> 00:37:29,327
I think it was about the only thing that I got out of Gauntlet.

701
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:34,270
Player survey is something we've never done, or hardly ever done for games, and we actually

702
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:38,111
went out on our first field test and we asked the players, what do you think of this game?

703
00:37:38,697 --> 00:37:41,238
And basically, and I'll quote this.

704
00:37:41,238 --> 00:37:44,400
This is actually a quote from the response was,

705
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,100
from the marketing says,

706
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,383
the player ratings were almost as high as possible.

707
00:37:49,383 --> 00:37:51,925
So, you know, and even players admitted

708
00:37:51,925 --> 00:37:53,826
putting up to $50 in the game at one session.

709
00:37:53,826 --> 00:37:56,367
I don't believe that.

710
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:58,729
I still don't believe that.

711
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:02,731
But it just, it was not worth anything to me,

712
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:04,172
but it was interesting.

713
00:38:04,172 --> 00:38:05,953
I guess it was reassuring to marketing

714
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:06,733
more than anything else.

715
00:38:08,457 --> 00:38:12,179
Field tests are, as I mentioned, are really different now.

716
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:15,060
The way they work is we have an agreement with the operator that says,

717
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,261
you keep our game secret, don't tell anybody.

718
00:38:18,261 --> 00:38:21,102
We get the, you know, you can keep all the earnings,

719
00:38:21,102 --> 00:38:24,323
but tell us how much the game earned and how much everybody,

720
00:38:24,323 --> 00:38:29,545
every other game in your arcade earned so we have some idea.

721
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:31,506
And I put Gauntlet out in June of 85.

722
00:38:32,548 --> 00:38:34,608
I went out a few days later to check on it.

723
00:38:34,608 --> 00:38:36,589
I walk in and here's David Rosen talking

724
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:42,550
to some other executive at Sega and three Japanese engineers

725
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:42,990
photographing the game.

726
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,110
Oops.

727
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:49,071
So this is the only game I've ever pulled from a field test,

728
00:38:49,071 --> 00:38:51,611
just for security reasons.

729
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:52,392
So I had to pull it.

730
00:38:52,392 --> 00:38:54,932
And so we didn't do any business with that arcade

731
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:58,913
afterwards, but there was so much buzz in the industry.

732
00:38:58,913 --> 00:39:01,113
Normal field tests usually steal earnings

733
00:39:01,113 --> 00:39:02,393
from other games in the arcade.

734
00:39:02,613 --> 00:39:05,254
that did not happen with Gauntlet, and I'll show you that in a minute.

735
00:39:05,254 --> 00:39:10,757
But some of the other numbers up here, if you remember me talking earlier in the flash

736
00:39:10,757 --> 00:39:15,959
forward saying this is one of the highest-earning games I'd ever seen, and I still think that's

737
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:21,982
true, but we had a field test in San Mateo that earned $15,000 in 16 weeks, and these

738
00:39:21,982 --> 00:39:25,843
guys I'm sure paid about $3,000 for the game, so it's pretty good ROI.

739
00:39:27,176 --> 00:39:32,557
There was actually one guy came up to me in the AMOA in October of 85 and said,

740
00:39:32,557 --> 00:39:35,138
oh, shake your hand.

741
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:37,298
My game made $3,500 the first week.

742
00:39:37,298 --> 00:39:38,838
I was like, holy crap.

743
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:41,219
I started doing the math.

744
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:46,560
That means there's four players in the game, 24 hours a day.

745
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,780
It's like, oh my god.

746
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,320
You know, two minutes per quarter.

747
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,041
I couldn't believe it.

748
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:56,118
I still don't believe it to this day either.

749
00:39:56,118 --> 00:39:59,120
Here's a typical field test report that we get.

750
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,124
If you notice on the right hand side, this is our primary

751
00:40:04,124 --> 00:40:05,105
test arcade, by the way.

752
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:08,447
This is the arcade that we almost always put our field

753
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,808
test units on.

754
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:15,673
If you notice, in late September, the whole arcade

755
00:40:15,673 --> 00:40:18,075
was making $4,500 that week.

756
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:21,422
Well, if the gauntlet was putting in, it made $5,700.

757
00:40:21,422 --> 00:40:22,262
So it jumped up by $1,200.

758
00:40:22,262 --> 00:40:27,184
And if you look at gauntlet, it was $1,136 the first week.

759
00:40:27,184 --> 00:40:31,826
If you look at the closest game next to it, it was $186.

760
00:40:31,826 --> 00:40:37,528
So that was a typical arcade game earned in those days, in 1985.

761
00:40:37,528 --> 00:40:41,129
Again, as I said, you probably paid $2,500 to $3,000 for a

762
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:41,790
game.

763
00:40:44,605 --> 00:40:48,168
We have very interesting things. I know I'm running out of time here, so I'm sorry.

764
00:40:48,168 --> 00:40:53,772
But these are really interesting things. We actually have to test our games for FCC regulations.

765
00:40:53,772 --> 00:40:56,614
We had an anechoic chamber. This is not a picture of ours, by the way.

766
00:40:57,271 --> 00:40:59,854
with a round table in the middle of it, so you put a game there and just rotate it.

767
00:40:59,854 --> 00:41:05,520
But it was really interesting to go in there, shut the door, you saw no light, it was pitch

768
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,421
black.

769
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:12,067
You stand there for a few seconds, and you start hearing sounds like molecules hitting

770
00:41:12,067 --> 00:41:14,209
your ear and your heartbeat.

771
00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:16,492
You can hear your heartbeat.

772
00:41:16,492 --> 00:41:18,114
A lot of people really get freaked out.

773
00:41:18,114 --> 00:41:19,095
I thought it was really cool.

774
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,784
But it was really interesting because we have four layer boards.

775
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:27,650
Our board was pretty quiet because normally you have two layer boards,

776
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,773
every trace on that board is basically an antenna.

777
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:33,098
So if you're sending a signal down, you've got this nice broadcast everywhere.

778
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:35,983
But on four-layer boards, you have this power and ground

779
00:41:35,983 --> 00:41:36,823
planes shielding it.

780
00:41:36,823 --> 00:41:38,785
So it actually became fairly quiet.

781
00:41:38,785 --> 00:41:41,587
And so that's why everybody went to four-layer boards.

782
00:41:41,587 --> 00:41:43,909
But this gives you some information on the pricing.

783
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:47,492
Because normally what we do is we, most of our games are

784
00:41:47,492 --> 00:41:49,193
like $19.95 around that time.

785
00:41:49,193 --> 00:41:52,556
But there was a big, all the distributors came and said,

786
00:41:52,556 --> 00:41:54,538
oh, no, no, give it to us at $2,000.

787
00:41:54,538 --> 00:41:56,880
We'll sell five times as many.

788
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,841
I didn't believe them for a minute.

789
00:41:58,841 --> 00:42:01,283
But our final price point was $22.95 to the

790
00:42:01,283 --> 00:42:02,784
distributors in the US.

791
00:42:03,674 --> 00:42:06,815
Now when it went out, of course, every operator in the world

792
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,756
wanted to have one right away.

793
00:42:08,756 --> 00:42:10,317
And we only built 100 a day.

794
00:42:10,317 --> 00:42:13,058
So distributors were asking premium.

795
00:42:13,058 --> 00:42:16,239
So I'm sure they were getting big bucks from some operators

796
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,340
to get the first few games.

797
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,781
And that's what I heard anyway.

798
00:42:19,781 --> 00:42:22,802
I don't know what the actual operators paid for it.

799
00:42:22,802 --> 00:42:23,982
We did ship games.

800
00:42:23,982 --> 00:42:27,584
In early October, as I said, we actually shipped games to

801
00:42:27,584 --> 00:42:29,024
Japan in 85 as well.

802
00:42:29,024 --> 00:42:31,385
And these are our domestic numbers.

803
00:42:32,055 --> 00:42:35,197
And I look back at him now and look at the earnings and say,

804
00:42:35,197 --> 00:42:38,099
God, that game should have sold a lot more.

805
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:40,201
I still don't know why it didn't sell more.

806
00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:43,823
And maybe the handwriting was on the wall, and I just didn't

807
00:42:43,823 --> 00:42:45,064
want to see it.

808
00:42:45,064 --> 00:42:46,465
But Coin Op Esdre was definitely in

809
00:42:46,465 --> 00:42:47,326
decline at that point.

810
00:42:47,326 --> 00:42:51,008
And this gives you some comparison to what some of the

811
00:42:51,008 --> 00:42:52,590
other games were selling.

812
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:55,091
Temple of Doom, we had about 2,800 units.

813
00:42:55,091 --> 00:42:55,992
Super Sprint, 2,250 units.

814
00:42:55,992 --> 00:42:58,214
That was a medium res, I believe.

815
00:42:58,214 --> 00:43:00,375
So the prices were a little higher on that.

816
00:43:01,893 --> 00:43:06,797
And I can go into the rest of it, but we did two different languages for this.

817
00:43:06,797 --> 00:43:10,701
But I've run out of time, so at this point I'd like to open it up for questions.

818
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:16,847
And I'd like everybody, because this session is being recorded, to come to the microphones

819
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:18,989
so that everybody can hear your questions.

820
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:21,611
If you need ideas, I can give you plenty.

821
00:43:21,611 --> 00:43:22,192
Fire away.

822
00:43:22,192 --> 00:43:22,432
Go ahead.

823
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:33,134
Yeah, there was at some point, somebody figured out how to live forever in Gauntlet 1.

824
00:43:33,134 --> 00:43:39,058
There was a trick you could pull off in like level 8, and then they released several patches,

825
00:43:39,058 --> 00:43:44,282
patches to kind of reduce the ability to playing forever.

826
00:43:44,282 --> 00:43:48,025
Were you involved in any of that? Do you remember anything about...

827
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,907
Oh, yes, I remember that very well.

828
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:57,692
Now, I had done Asteroids, so, and I won't go into the Lower King story, but I got shit

829
00:43:57,692 --> 00:44:01,074
for, you know, leaving a version out that could play forever.

830
00:44:01,074 --> 00:44:05,156
And I found people that could play forever on Centipede, practically, too.

831
00:44:05,156 --> 00:44:08,197
So you'd think I'd have learned, but I didn't.

832
00:44:08,197 --> 00:44:11,379
Yes, it was firstly reported in Japan, seriously.

833
00:44:11,898 --> 00:44:16,422
Because Japan has a different culture, so when one person comes up and is playing the game,

834
00:44:16,422 --> 00:44:18,404
in the U.S. you just walk up, drop your coins and play.

835
00:44:18,404 --> 00:44:20,646
In Japan they can walk up and say, may I join you?

836
00:44:20,646 --> 00:44:23,408
And the guy says, no, people don't take offense.

837
00:44:23,408 --> 00:44:27,732
So the guy would play it as a single player game, and he could play forever.

838
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:32,256
It was found that if you played the Hulk or the Wizard, you could play forever.

839
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:36,900
And yes, I did create a patch for it by reducing the amount of food for one player and two player games.

840
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,642
For three and four I kept all the food out there.

841
00:44:39,272 --> 00:44:41,873
And I eventually dropped the amount of food as the game went on.

842
00:44:41,873 --> 00:44:45,755
If the guys kept playing and playing and playing, you know, I'd still start dropping food.

843
00:44:45,755 --> 00:44:50,037
Yes, I released the ROMs, but I can't tell you how effective it was

844
00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:51,277
or how many people actually got it.

845
00:44:51,277 --> 00:44:54,759
But I can tell you for asteroids, when I released the fix for asteroids,

846
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:59,000
the operators put it in, immediately took it back out.

847
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,162
They never used it because they found out the people couldn't play forever

848
00:45:02,162 --> 00:45:05,283
and they couldn't lurk, they wouldn't play the game.

849
00:45:05,283 --> 00:45:07,764
So there's actually incentive for it.

850
00:45:07,764 --> 00:45:07,984
Yes?

851
00:45:09,148 --> 00:45:15,374
Yes, I actually had a question about the effort you put into security to your games.

852
00:45:15,374 --> 00:45:20,659
And you also mentioned that you've been an expert witness in copyright lawsuits and things like that.

853
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:23,902
It's a big challenge for our industry how to deal with that.

854
00:45:23,902 --> 00:45:31,369
And as a programmer, I work with programmers that have to spend so much of their time worrying about patents,

855
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:34,232
worrying about, you know, how to make sure that they're protected.

856
00:45:34,848 --> 00:45:37,069
And I just wondered if you had any perspective on the current

857
00:45:37,069 --> 00:45:39,291
industry as a patent owner and as a programmer.

858
00:45:39,291 --> 00:45:40,211
Well, I have mixed feelings about patents.

859
00:45:40,211 --> 00:45:44,474
I can see why they're necessary.

860
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:48,016
And I think the companies have certainly gotten overboard

861
00:45:48,016 --> 00:45:51,579
with them, because everybody's creating patents now.

862
00:45:51,579 --> 00:45:54,360
It's basically become a corporate strategy to get

863
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,002
patents and sue everybody.

864
00:45:57,002 --> 00:46:01,225
It really hurts the industry in the long run.

865
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:02,966
I don't like it.

866
00:46:03,606 --> 00:46:06,307
gives the power to the big companies, and I don't like that either.

867
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:10,728
But, you know, I see why it's necessary, and I don't have a good solution for it.

868
00:46:10,728 --> 00:46:17,909
Copying is a different matter, because people will copy stuff, leave your name in it,

869
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:23,270
they don't, you know, leave your own copyright message, they don't care,

870
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,631
as long as they get the sales for it.

871
00:46:25,631 --> 00:46:27,451
And that, you know, that's something really different.

872
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,512
And that, you know, I really object to.

873
00:46:30,133 --> 00:46:31,574
So I'm not sure I answered your question.

874
00:46:31,574 --> 00:46:34,714
And yes, I spend a lot of time dealing with this stuff.

875
00:46:34,714 --> 00:46:37,715
And there's really no good solution.

876
00:46:37,715 --> 00:46:42,116
I did things, for example, on Dreamcast for Rush 2049 that

877
00:46:42,116 --> 00:46:45,657
I could actually tell when people ripped off the CD.

878
00:46:45,657 --> 00:46:48,457
And when you played, actually, you'd go to the Seg website

879
00:46:48,457 --> 00:46:49,858
and play it.

880
00:46:49,858 --> 00:46:56,319
I actually recorded the people that had ripped the CD off.

881
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,680
So I would have actually, I could have known who they were.

882
00:47:00,573 --> 00:47:04,194
Unfortunately, the software for the guys who ripped it off, my

883
00:47:04,194 --> 00:47:06,935
co-programmer disabled it to test something and didn't

884
00:47:06,935 --> 00:47:10,757
re-enable it when he checked in his code.

885
00:47:10,757 --> 00:47:12,077
So it shipped without it.

886
00:47:12,077 --> 00:47:14,698
Otherwise, I could have detected everybody who played

887
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:18,360
the game and had a ripped off CD for Rush 249 and the

888
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,020
Dreamcast.

889
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:19,440
Thank you.

890
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:19,520
Yes.

891
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,242
Yeah, I was just wondering if you had any interesting

892
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:26,683
anecdotes about developing Centipede.

893
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:32,111
Something we never heard before, or a tidbit.

894
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:32,432
Thanks.

895
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:36,254
I have anecdotes about lightscapes.

896
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:36,515
Oops.

897
00:47:36,515 --> 00:47:40,458
It's the anecdote about centipede.

898
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:40,918
Oh, man.

899
00:47:40,918 --> 00:47:44,441
I don't really have many, but I'll give you one example.

900
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:49,325
You can usually tell when you have a hit in engineering,

901
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:51,786
when 5 or 6 o'clock rolls around, and people come up

902
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:53,448
and say, are you going home soon?

903
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,404
read into it that I'd like to play your game, get lost.

904
00:47:58,404 --> 00:48:03,886
And that happened certainly to Asteroids, Centipede, and Gauntlet.

905
00:48:03,886 --> 00:48:08,448
But rarely to the other games that just did so-so.

906
00:48:08,448 --> 00:48:08,528
Yes.

907
00:48:08,528 --> 00:48:14,651
First of all, I just wanted to thank you for making, I think, one of the greatest games

908
00:48:14,651 --> 00:48:15,351
of all time.

909
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:15,911
I mean, really.

910
00:48:15,911 --> 00:48:17,892
I mean that's incredible.

911
00:48:17,892 --> 00:48:17,972
No.

912
00:48:17,972 --> 00:48:18,212
Um.

913
00:48:18,212 --> 00:48:18,532
Thank you.

914
00:48:18,532 --> 00:48:18,973
Thank you.

915
00:48:18,973 --> 00:48:19,453
Thank you.

916
00:48:19,453 --> 00:48:19,713
Thank you.

917
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:20,273
Thank you.

918
00:48:21,475 --> 00:48:27,740
I just want to tell you, I remember being an 11-year-old kid and my parents had taken

919
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:33,044
me on a trip to Switzerland and I'd seen this gauntlet game, it was magical, and my parents

920
00:48:33,044 --> 00:48:37,667
could not understand why their son didn't want to go skiing or go outside but kept going

921
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:42,992
back indoors to this pizza shop, and it's because of you.

922
00:48:42,992 --> 00:48:47,615
But my question is, I remember ports for the Commodore 64, I think there was an Apple port.

923
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:52,114
Can you speak a little bit to, you know, your involvement in porting across various systems?

924
00:48:52,114 --> 00:48:59,415
All right, this slide says that I had nothing to do with consumer versions.

925
00:48:59,415 --> 00:49:05,997
And some of that is intentional, I think, by the other team, because I'm a very stickler

926
00:49:05,997 --> 00:49:09,918
for details and I give them shit about anything that's wrong.

927
00:49:10,995 --> 00:49:20,199
Early on in Atari days, you know, I would see like an asteroid, you know, they'd ship asteroids and I'd go look and I'd say,

928
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:23,940
holy crap, they ruined my game, how did they do this?

929
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,321
And so, you know, I gave them shit.

930
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:30,062
And eventually we got to actually review stuff.

931
00:49:30,062 --> 00:49:32,543
But, no, I did not have them do a lot of consumer stuff.

932
00:49:32,543 --> 00:49:33,943
And I don't have anything to do with it.

933
00:49:33,943 --> 00:49:34,604
Yes?

934
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:35,724
How large was the game?

935
00:49:35,724 --> 00:49:37,445
How much space did it take up?

936
00:49:37,445 --> 00:49:39,685
What was your audio compression like and so on?

937
00:49:41,493 --> 00:49:42,173
Just a second.

938
00:49:42,173 --> 00:49:45,176
I have this cheat sheet.

939
00:49:45,176 --> 00:49:48,319
I have the memory map for Gauntlet.

940
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,441
EEPROMs.

941
00:49:51,441 --> 00:49:55,705
Oh, and a 512 byte EEPROM was non-volatile.

942
00:49:55,705 --> 00:49:58,948
That was for the operating system, I think.

943
00:49:58,948 --> 00:50:01,070
Let's see.

944
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:01,470
Oh, man.

945
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:02,171
176 K words?

946
00:50:02,171 --> 00:50:02,251
Wow.

947
00:50:08,817 --> 00:50:12,319
32k bytes for the OS and 16k bytes for Slapstick.

948
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,880
That can't be the program ROM.

949
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,341
It wasn't that big.

950
00:50:16,341 --> 00:50:18,923
So I'd have to say I don't know without actually getting in

951
00:50:18,923 --> 00:50:20,644
and trying to figure that out.

952
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:22,465
I could probably look.

953
00:50:22,465 --> 00:50:25,027
I could probably go up and look at the picture.

954
00:50:25,027 --> 00:50:25,907
We'll count the EEPROMs.

955
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:37,595
I don't remember if they're 27, 128's or 256's.

956
00:50:37,595 --> 00:50:38,315
So I can't tell you.

957
00:50:38,315 --> 00:50:40,376
But I'd look at that picture.

958
00:50:40,376 --> 00:50:42,977
Go to the archives and start counting EEPROMs.

959
00:50:42,977 --> 00:50:45,578
And I don't know if they're 27, 256's or not.

960
00:50:45,578 --> 00:50:47,058
So it might be about a megabyte.

961
00:50:47,058 --> 00:50:50,500
Well, some of those are graphics.

962
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,580
So the motion object, play field, and alphanumeric.

963
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,541
So there's play field graphics.

964
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:58,983
There's also motion object graphics.

965
00:50:58,983 --> 00:51:00,843
There's alphanumeric graphics.

966
00:51:00,843 --> 00:51:03,584
And there's a program ROM.

967
00:51:03,584 --> 00:51:03,825
And so.

968
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:12,103
Oh boy, I got somebody telling me I need to, I got six minutes, okay.

969
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:16,105
But basically that, not all of it is program ROM there.

970
00:51:16,105 --> 00:51:18,586
So I can't tell you how much is the program.

971
00:51:18,586 --> 00:51:22,288
I'd have to go back and actually take a look at the schematic,

972
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:25,470
which I actually do have here, and try to figure it out.

973
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:28,191
So, at this point I'm going to have to say I'm sorry, I don't know.

974
00:51:28,191 --> 00:51:28,391
Yes?

975
00:51:28,391 --> 00:51:28,951
Two questions.

976
00:51:28,951 --> 00:51:34,354
So, less than 10% of your games really were successful.

977
00:51:34,495 --> 00:51:36,337
How many did you make?

978
00:51:36,337 --> 00:51:39,379
And two, why did so many units go to Ireland?

979
00:51:39,379 --> 00:51:41,720
I'm sorry, what was the second question?

980
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:47,344
Why, you said 7,500 units or round were shipped to the states and there were like 20, there

981
00:51:47,344 --> 00:51:48,405
we go.

982
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:55,089
You said 7,850 units were sent to the US, 1,500 kits mostly for Japan and 2,250 went

983
00:51:55,089 --> 00:51:55,630
to Ireland.

984
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:56,110
Why Ireland?

985
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:02,534
I can't tell you if all those, you know, we did ship to Europe, so we do have games

986
00:52:02,534 --> 00:52:03,235
sold to Europe.

987
00:52:04,765 --> 00:52:09,026
And I cannot tell you if those Ireland games got shipped to the U.S.

988
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:13,988
I cannot also tell you if the games were built in Ireland because our Milpitas factory was

989
00:52:13,988 --> 00:52:19,330
maxed out at 100 games and we needed another 50 or 100, you know, 25 or whatever in Ireland

990
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:22,751
to be shipped back to the East Coast simply to get all the orders in.

991
00:52:22,751 --> 00:52:31,194
And I can tell you that the initial U.S. release was 10,000 and I think Ireland was supposed

992
00:52:31,194 --> 00:52:31,594
to be 500 to 1,000.

993
00:52:32,487 --> 00:52:37,709
But if you add the two numbers together, it does look like

994
00:52:37,709 --> 00:52:42,170
they did try to ramp both of them up just to get all the

995
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:42,911
production in.

996
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:43,851
How many games did I do?

997
00:52:43,851 --> 00:52:48,672
I think I did 12 coin-op games in my years, from 78 to 92 or

998
00:52:48,672 --> 00:52:52,694
so, how many of those were really hits?

999
00:52:52,694 --> 00:52:55,414
I'd say three of them were really monster hits.

1000
00:52:55,414 --> 00:52:57,415
It would be Asteroid, Centipede, and Gauntlet.

1001
00:52:57,415 --> 00:53:01,496
All the others were good for the time.

1002
00:53:01,496 --> 00:53:02,057
Some of them.

1003
00:53:02,795 --> 00:53:06,158
or so-so, didn't do as well as I'd like.

1004
00:53:06,158 --> 00:53:06,238
Yes.

1005
00:53:06,238 --> 00:53:06,698
So thanks for Gauntlet.

1006
00:53:06,698 --> 00:53:13,944
So Gauntlet, to my knowledge, is one of the first, if not

1007
00:53:13,944 --> 00:53:19,989
the first, digital game to have differentiated

1008
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:23,732
gameplay in which the multiple players couldn't

1009
00:53:23,732 --> 00:53:25,133
do all of the same things.

1010
00:53:26,056 --> 00:53:33,980
Can you speak about both the process by which you determined what the balance would be between

1011
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:40,883
the four different classes, and separately, do you have any data as to which classes were

1012
00:53:40,883 --> 00:53:43,304
played more or less?

1013
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:46,066
Because not every game had four players at all times.

1014
00:53:46,066 --> 00:53:48,447
I'll answer the second question.

1015
00:53:48,447 --> 00:53:53,269
I thought the Hulk and the Wizard were the most powerful characters, but other people

1016
00:53:53,269 --> 00:53:55,030
said that the Elf can also be.

1017
00:53:56,028 --> 00:53:58,852
used to play the hame whole time.

1018
00:53:58,852 --> 00:54:00,675
No one I've, and I cannot tell you,

1019
00:54:00,675 --> 00:54:03,139
I have not seen anybody do the elf,

1020
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:06,804
but I've seen people do the hulk and the wizard

1021
00:54:06,804 --> 00:54:10,410
and play for as long as they need to.

1022
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:14,918
As far as the balance goes, I can tell you that Valkyrie was supposed to be in equal

1023
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:15,398
balance.

1024
00:54:15,398 --> 00:54:19,321
I know the wizard was supposed to be all magic and basically took lots of damage if he got

1025
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:24,065
hit, so he was supposed to be the guy in reserve, you know, who sort of hung in the back.

1026
00:54:24,065 --> 00:54:28,268
And the elf was the greedy bastard who ran around and grabbed all the food and treasure.

1027
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:31,070
So if you wanted a high score, you grabbed the elf.

1028
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:35,674
And the Hulk was the guy who could sit there and take the damage, and he was the guy who

1029
00:54:35,674 --> 00:54:38,476
shoved out in front to take care of all the stuff.

1030
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:40,097
So that was pretty much it.

1031
00:54:40,812 --> 00:54:43,434
how the four characters came about.

1032
00:54:43,434 --> 00:54:46,076
I cannot tell you why I picked those particular four,

1033
00:54:46,076 --> 00:54:49,498
but I did balance, tried to balance it as such from that.

1034
00:54:49,498 --> 00:54:51,480
And I'd like to preface it somewhat else

1035
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,482
that you can thank me all you want for these games,

1036
00:54:54,482 --> 00:54:59,526
but guys, I was doing this because I like doing games.

1037
00:54:59,526 --> 00:55:02,047
I was doing this for me too.

1038
00:55:02,047 --> 00:55:03,829
And there was another reason too,

1039
00:55:03,829 --> 00:55:04,969
and I didn't get to that slide,

1040
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:07,651
and that is Atari had a bonus program,

1041
00:55:07,651 --> 00:55:08,872
and this is something that,

1042
00:55:09,998 --> 00:55:12,240
Unfortunately, I wish all companies had done.

1043
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,302
So what they did is actually rewarded us for games

1044
00:55:15,302 --> 00:55:18,263
that actually sold and made profit for the company.

1045
00:55:18,263 --> 00:55:20,565
So we actually had a piece of the profits.

1046
00:55:20,565 --> 00:55:23,867
And the company actually distributed it to the team.

1047
00:55:23,867 --> 00:55:25,948
And they actually allowed the team to distribute

1048
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:27,549
which people got what.

1049
00:55:27,549 --> 00:55:30,871
For students that are coming.

1050
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:32,652
Wait a minute, just hold one sec.

1051
00:55:32,652 --> 00:55:34,653
Do we have time for more questions?

1052
00:55:34,653 --> 00:55:36,054
Yes, yes.

1053
00:55:36,054 --> 00:55:37,875
Okay, excellent, good.

1054
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:38,495
Fire away.

1055
00:55:38,915 --> 00:55:41,616
For students that are trying to come into this industry,

1056
00:55:41,616 --> 00:55:43,356
what do you think is the biggest takeaway

1057
00:55:43,356 --> 00:55:48,998
or the most important thing that they should learn

1058
00:55:48,998 --> 00:55:50,998
from the early era, the golden age of arcade

1059
00:55:50,998 --> 00:55:52,599
and early video games?

1060
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,459
Oops.

1061
00:55:53,459 --> 00:55:56,000
There it is.

1062
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,720
I ran off the screen.

1063
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,161
How do you do that?

1064
00:56:00,161 --> 00:56:05,983
So PowerPoint has a wrap around the screen of death?

1065
00:56:05,983 --> 00:56:06,543
Well, anyway.

1066
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:12,568
I'm not sure I can answer the question, because the industry

1067
00:56:12,568 --> 00:56:16,309
has certainly changed a lot since 78 days, because we had

1068
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:19,770
a lot of phrases sort of covered up the summary.

1069
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:22,811
People would say, you could play the game with one beer

1070
00:56:22,811 --> 00:56:24,472
in your hand, that kind of stuff.

1071
00:56:24,472 --> 00:56:27,133
Easy to learn, hard to master.

1072
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,734
That was the classic one.

1073
00:56:29,734 --> 00:56:33,535
And for me, what you wanted to do is create a game where

1074
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:37,156
people walked up, looked at it, and said, I know what to do.

1075
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,461
You don't have to read the rules, give them instruction.

1076
00:56:40,461 --> 00:56:43,582
And for an arcade game, that's absolutely necessary.

1077
00:56:43,582 --> 00:56:45,843
Because there is no instruction booklet, folks.

1078
00:56:45,843 --> 00:56:47,943
There's no manual that says, here's a help manual.

1079
00:56:47,943 --> 00:56:48,423
Read it all.

1080
00:56:48,423 --> 00:56:50,304
You just put it up, put your quarter in.

1081
00:56:50,304 --> 00:56:53,005
If you didn't figure it out, and you didn't think you could

1082
00:56:53,005 --> 00:56:54,545
figure it out, you just walked away.

1083
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:58,766
But most, excuse me, all great games, people would walk up,

1084
00:56:58,766 --> 00:57:02,047
take one look, and say, I know what to do.

1085
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:02,727
It's a shooter.

1086
00:57:02,727 --> 00:57:04,868
Whack the shit out of anything that moves.

1087
00:57:04,868 --> 00:57:06,568
Or come on, that's the way it works.

1088
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:11,753
And if you didn't get that initial thing, then.

1089
00:57:12,497 --> 00:57:14,098
you know, you really didn't get their money,

1090
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:14,998
you didn't get their interest,

1091
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:15,938
and so you couldn't get their money.

1092
00:57:15,938 --> 00:57:19,560
The other part of it was you had to make sure

1093
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,180
that it had strategic, you know,

1094
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,541
it had, in my opinion, my games,

1095
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:24,341
I always wanted to make sure

1096
00:57:24,341 --> 00:57:26,922
that it appeared to be lots of strategies,

1097
00:57:26,922 --> 00:57:28,302
whether it's Asteroid Centipede or,

1098
00:57:28,302 --> 00:57:29,783
there'd be many different things,

1099
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:31,423
like how can I do this?

1100
00:57:31,423 --> 00:57:34,124
Should I, you know, do this, or should I do that?

1101
00:57:34,124 --> 00:57:36,225
And so you want to put in coins to try different strategies,

1102
00:57:36,225 --> 00:57:37,685
find out ones that work.

1103
00:57:37,685 --> 00:57:40,106
And those are the, to me, I have the great games

1104
00:57:40,106 --> 00:57:40,947
that have different strategies.

1105
00:57:42,555 --> 00:57:44,396
So I hope I answered their question that well.

1106
00:57:44,396 --> 00:57:44,456
Yes?

1107
00:57:44,456 --> 00:57:45,577
Hi, thanks for the great talk and the great game.

1108
00:57:45,577 --> 00:57:47,699
Can you say a little bit about the process

1109
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:49,020
of designing the game?

1110
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:54,485
And then, because we test all the time.

1111
00:57:54,485 --> 00:57:59,969
And I don't know if you were able to even do that back then.

1112
00:57:59,969 --> 00:58:02,451
Like, how often did you play the game

1113
00:58:02,451 --> 00:58:04,533
to see how it worked and change it and test it?

1114
00:58:04,533 --> 00:58:06,975
Or did you just make a whole design document

1115
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:07,855
and then go from there?

1116
00:58:07,855 --> 00:58:08,456
What was it like?

1117
00:58:09,478 --> 00:58:10,979
How did I decide?

1118
00:58:10,979 --> 00:58:12,301
Well, let me give you a little story.

1119
00:58:12,301 --> 00:58:15,164
When I had my first game at Atari, it was Super Breakout.

1120
00:58:15,164 --> 00:58:18,688
And I remember going home, falling asleep at night, and

1121
00:58:18,688 --> 00:58:23,773
playing Progressive Breakout in my sleep.

1122
00:58:23,773 --> 00:58:25,495
So yes, I played the game a lot.

1123
00:58:25,495 --> 00:58:26,897
And I remember, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1124
00:58:26,897 --> 00:58:28,799
It's like, oh, god damn, I died.

1125
00:58:32,295 --> 00:58:36,316
And after a few years of this, I no longer played the games in my sleep.

1126
00:58:36,316 --> 00:58:38,417
But yes, we do play a lot of the games.

1127
00:58:38,417 --> 00:58:42,759
A lot of times it's, you know, testing this particular feature that I stuck in or, you

1128
00:58:42,759 --> 00:58:45,281
know, just making sure I didn't break anything.

1129
00:58:45,281 --> 00:58:48,862
And yes, we do play it in the lab just before we send it out in field test.

1130
00:58:48,862 --> 00:58:51,423
And by the way, yes, we still had bugs.

1131
00:58:51,423 --> 00:58:55,625
And in coin-op games, you basically, sorry, that's it.

1132
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:56,346
It shipped.

1133
00:58:56,346 --> 00:58:57,546
It's got the bugs.

1134
00:58:57,546 --> 00:58:58,367
It's too late.

1135
00:58:58,367 --> 00:58:59,547
And that's the way it is.

1136
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:05,948
One more question. I'm sorry. Fire away.

1137
00:59:05,948 --> 00:59:11,611
You mentioned that you believe that the Hulk and the Wizard were the most powerful classes.

1138
00:59:11,611 --> 00:59:15,373
Did you ever consider or wish you had considered nerfing them?

1139
00:59:15,373 --> 00:59:16,874
I'm sorry, doing what with it?

1140
00:59:16,874 --> 00:59:17,094
Nerf...

1141
00:59:17,094 --> 00:59:25,939
I didn't hear the question, so I didn't know what the joke was.

1142
00:59:25,939 --> 00:59:32,642
Did you consider making the Hulk and the Wizard weaker?

1143
00:59:34,385 --> 00:59:37,107
You know, I don't have any regrets over that.

1144
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:39,909
It's OK to have different characters for different

1145
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,571
things, especially on Gauntlet 2, where you could pick

1146
00:59:42,571 --> 00:59:45,193
whatever character you wanted to be in any position.

1147
00:59:45,193 --> 00:59:48,416
And that was one of the great parts about Gauntlet 2, and I

1148
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:50,637
wish I'd have done that in Gauntlet, is to let you pick

1149
00:59:50,637 --> 00:59:51,598
your character.

1150
00:59:51,598 --> 00:59:55,341
So thank you very much, folks.

1151
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:55,961
I appreciate it.
