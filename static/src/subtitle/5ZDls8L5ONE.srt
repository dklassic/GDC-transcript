00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:07,445
Hi, I'm Jeff Hester. I'm an artist at Harmonix.

2
00:00:08,386 --> 00:00:10,389
And welcome to the talk, Maximizing Critique,

3
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,231
Improving Communication for Everyone Involved

4
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:13,673
in Critical Feedback.

5
00:00:15,174 --> 00:00:16,936
Conversations that involve critical feedback

6
00:00:17,177 --> 00:00:20,220
are part of our everyday lives as video game developers.

7
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:23,784
This talk is in the art track, and I'm an artist,

8
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:25,206
and most examples we'll be using are art.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,363
But the top things I'll be covering are

10
00:00:28,383 --> 00:00:30,766
relevant across all disciplines

11
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:32,849
and in between all disciplines.

12
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:34,792
The conversations that we have that involve

13
00:00:34,812 --> 00:00:37,956
giving each other feedback happen all over

14
00:00:38,097 --> 00:00:39,599
and everyone in all of our companies.

15
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:45,669
One thing we can do as artists is,

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,772
we often have come from a background in art school

17
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:50,493
where these kinds of conversations have been

18
00:00:50,673 --> 00:00:52,714
a really integral part of our education.

19
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:56,837
And I hope that the talk today is gonna give some,

20
00:00:57,118 --> 00:00:58,418
even for artists, some fresh insight

21
00:00:58,438 --> 00:01:00,180
on some strategies we can do to improve

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,061
the ways we give and receive critical feedback,

23
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,323
or at least articulate what we already

24
00:01:04,343 --> 00:01:05,363
might be doing intuitively,

25
00:01:05,684 --> 00:01:06,544
having come through art school.

26
00:01:07,765 --> 00:01:09,346
But one thing we can also do, those of us who are artists

27
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:11,608
who have this background, is we can really use

28
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:14,750
that background to be leaders in our own companies

29
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,052
and helping to change company culture

30
00:01:18,092 --> 00:01:20,433
and improve this kind of dialogue across

31
00:01:20,573 --> 00:01:21,994
and in between all disciplines.

32
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:25,897
So hopefully I'll be giving you some fuel

33
00:01:26,057 --> 00:01:29,159
and some strategies you can do to do that.

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,381
When conversations that involve critical feedback go well,

35
00:01:33,883 --> 00:01:36,588
our products get better, we increase efficiency,

36
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,090
we increase team cohesion,

37
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:40,174
but when those conversations go poorly.

38
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,977
then they result in wasted work,

39
00:01:44,557 --> 00:01:45,718
adrift in creative vision,

40
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:48,220
and just really bad team morale.

41
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,842
And by badly, I don't mean what we normally think of

42
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:51,522
as just bad.

43
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:52,863
You know, I don't mean somebody saying,

44
00:01:52,884 --> 00:01:53,804
you know, that sucks.

45
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:55,525
We know that's bad feedback.

46
00:01:55,826 --> 00:01:57,267
But I mean, there's often a lot of times

47
00:01:57,287 --> 00:01:58,568
that feedback is just okay,

48
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:00,189
or it's neutral,

49
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:04,412
and it's not being as effective and actionable as it can be.

50
00:02:04,432 --> 00:02:06,233
And we're gonna talk about that a lot today.

51
00:02:06,474 --> 00:02:08,395
How do we take feedback that's all right

52
00:02:08,735 --> 00:02:09,496
and make it awesome?

53
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:13,800
So my background interest in this goes pretty far back.

54
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:16,385
Before I worked in video games.

55
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,835
I taught for a long time, for more than 10 years, in China and in the Rhode Island School

56
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:25,956
of Design and at the New York Academy.

57
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:29,759
I've also taught a lot of workshops at places like the Metropolitan Museum, Fisher-Price,

58
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:30,960
Turbine and Harmonics.

59
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,003
During this time of teaching I became really interested in the idea of critical feedback

60
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:39,366
and group critiques and how it is that we give feedback, when is it effective and when

61
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:39,786
is it not.

62
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:41,067
A lot of that came out of...

63
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:43,909
my own challenges to do it well, and when it went bad,

64
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:46,710
when it went well, and trying to take those moments

65
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:49,492
and find out what it was about them that was either good or bad.

66
00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:52,533
And about seven years ago, I was fortunate enough

67
00:02:52,874 --> 00:02:53,974
to start working at Harmonix,

68
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:56,996
which is an awesome company.

69
00:02:58,869 --> 00:03:00,009
I can't say enough great things about it.

70
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,691
And one of the great things about Harmonics

71
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,593
is it has an amazing culture of critical feedback,

72
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:06,574
especially in the art department.

73
00:03:07,194 --> 00:03:09,316
And I found that the work and thoughts

74
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:12,778
that I'd done as an artist and as a teacher before that

75
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:15,840
really fit in really well and it was great

76
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,282
to experience that at Harmonics.

77
00:03:18,442 --> 00:03:20,583
While there I've worked on Rock Band 3,

78
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:24,266
I've been on lots of research and development teams,

79
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:25,907
especially leading up to Fantasia

80
00:03:25,927 --> 00:03:26,967
where I was the lead environment artist.

81
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:33,249
And most recently, I'm now currently working on the Harmonix Music Visualizer, Harmonix Music VR.

82
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,110
So, while I was teaching, one of the things I would often talk about with students is this word, crit.

83
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,450
What the hell does that mean?

84
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:45,511
And I would say to them, especially when they're freshmen, we say, okay, we're going to have a crit today.

85
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:47,872
We talk about that, but what is that? And the freshmen often didn't know.

86
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:50,752
They often didn't know, does it mean criticize, or does it mean critique?

87
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:52,953
And there's a big difference between those two things.

88
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:54,773
And we start to talk about it. What is the difference?

89
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:56,453
What is the difference between criticize and critique?

90
00:03:56,673 --> 00:03:57,173
Criticize.

91
00:03:58,623 --> 00:03:59,864
is much more superficial.

92
00:04:00,084 --> 00:04:01,105
It's your initial response.

93
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:02,405
It's the first response, you might say.

94
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:04,807
It often tends to be more about personal preference.

95
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:06,388
It often tends to be very judgmental.

96
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:07,449
It's not.

97
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:09,190
It's just what happens to come out.

98
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,051
And it's much more on the surface.

99
00:04:11,071 --> 00:04:13,813
Whereas critique is about taking something apart,

100
00:04:14,394 --> 00:04:16,255
analyzing it, looking at it from all levels,

101
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:18,016
looking inside of it, understanding how it works.

102
00:04:18,637 --> 00:04:19,877
And that might lead to judgment,

103
00:04:19,897 --> 00:04:20,758
it might lead to assessment,

104
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,659
in terms of is it working well or is it not working well.

105
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:26,201
But that assessment is not the main part of critique.

106
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:28,842
The main part of critique is the analysis.

107
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:30,403
So critique is more objective.

108
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:33,265
It's analytical, it's reflective, it's deeper.

109
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:35,006
It's going into the surface of something,

110
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,087
understanding what it is.

111
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:39,408
And often, when feedback is not as helpful

112
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,969
or as actionable as it can be,

113
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:43,151
it's because it's living on that realm

114
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:45,412
of just being something that someone is just criticizing.

115
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,473
But when it becomes much more actionable,

116
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:48,993
it's heading into being more critique.

117
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:51,073
One of the unique things about this talk today

118
00:04:51,093 --> 00:04:53,274
is I'm not going to just focus on how we are more effective

119
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:54,634
in giving feedback, but I'm also going to talk

120
00:04:54,654 --> 00:04:56,575
about a lot of strategies for how we can receive

121
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:58,055
feedback more effectively.

122
00:04:58,075 --> 00:05:00,575
You know, often, any bit of feedback you get,

123
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:03,176
it might be this nasty old lump of coal,

124
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,156
but you don't have to leave it that way.

125
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:06,597
Just because it came that way,

126
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:08,797
there are ways you can take that nasty lump of coal

127
00:05:08,997 --> 00:05:10,018
and turn it into a diamond.

128
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:11,538
And I'm going to try to give you some strategies

129
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:13,198
to help start thinking about ways to do that.

130
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:16,621
Often when we think about feedback, we think about it being a one-way street.

131
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:18,222
The giver going right to the receiver.

132
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:20,244
And one thing that's really problematic with this

133
00:05:20,464 --> 00:05:23,867
is often people think that I don't need to think about the person who's receiving this feedback.

134
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:26,429
It's their fault if they can't understand it.

135
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:27,810
They need to have a tough skin.

136
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,552
And you know what? That's bullshit.

137
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,775
You know, because feedback is, these feedback loops

138
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:36,516
are moments when we can really have a deep conversation

139
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:38,917
and build community in our companies.

140
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:42,439
And if we're not thinking about it as a two-way street,

141
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:44,700
if we're thinking about it just as a one-way loop

142
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,920
and we're not really caring about the person

143
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,862
who's receiving it, then we're missing a huge opportunity

144
00:05:49,102 --> 00:05:50,742
to build relationships in the company

145
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:52,403
and build our whole,

146
00:05:53,564 --> 00:05:54,404
creative environment.

147
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:56,126
But when we start to think of it as a two-way street,

148
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:57,908
you're going to start to think about it empathically.

149
00:05:58,288 --> 00:05:59,329
If you're giving feedback, how are you

150
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:00,430
thinking about how it's going to be received

151
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,231
from the person receiving it?

152
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:03,733
If you're receiving feedback, how

153
00:06:03,773 --> 00:06:05,955
are you thinking about it from the person who's giving it?

154
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:08,217
Are you going to assume it's the best intentions?

155
00:06:08,437 --> 00:06:11,200
Or are you not going to assume it's the best intentions?

156
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,282
So we need to have empathy on both ends of this

157
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:16,204
and see it as a two-way dialogue that we're really working

158
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:17,626
together toward a common good.

159
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,350
Before I get to a few strategies,

160
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:23,671
goals are one of the most important things

161
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:25,492
we can think about when we're giving critical feedback.

162
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:27,673
If you remember nothing else I talked about today,

163
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:29,434
none of the specific strategies I'm gonna go over,

164
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,255
just remember this, if you have a goal,

165
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:34,036
if you articulated your goal,

166
00:06:34,236 --> 00:06:34,936
when you're about to start giving

167
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:35,876
or receiving critical feedback,

168
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:37,597
right away you're gonna start heading more

169
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:39,978
into a form of critique, rather than just criticizing.

170
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:41,539
Because having that goal is gonna help you

171
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:43,259
be dugging under the surface of what you're doing.

172
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,260
I'm gonna give you a few examples of the kinds of goals

173
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,281
that I was keeping in mind when I'm designing

174
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:48,561
the strategies we'll talk about today.

175
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:51,968
The first one is align your work with the art direction.

176
00:06:51,988 --> 00:06:54,669
This is a great default goal to have.

177
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,231
You know, if you're not sure what goal to have,

178
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:57,231
just think about this one,

179
00:06:57,431 --> 00:06:59,633
because right away you're gonna start giving a context.

180
00:06:59,813 --> 00:07:01,774
You're gonna be contextualizing the feedback you give,

181
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,636
and giving it some sort of larger reason for being

182
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,158
is gonna help it be much more relevant

183
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:07,038
and much more actionable.

184
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,500
Leave room for creative problem solving.

185
00:07:09,781 --> 00:07:12,163
This is a great goal for helping that two-way dialogue.

186
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:14,305
If you're leaving room for the person you're giving feedback

187
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,406
to solve the problem creatively,

188
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:18,628
then you're already inviting them into the problem.

189
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:19,910
You're thinking of it more as a dialogue

190
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,251
rather than a one-way street.

191
00:07:22,786 --> 00:07:24,247
Encourage team spirit and cohesion.

192
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:25,868
Keep that in mind with critical feedback,

193
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:27,630
and things will really be helping

194
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,073
to make sure your feedback is being effectively received.

195
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:33,234
And developing a desire for feedback.

196
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:35,496
This is true of both receiving and giving feedback.

197
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:38,418
It helps us to embrace it as a wonderful act,

198
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:39,939
not this moment we have to fear.

199
00:07:44,343 --> 00:07:46,705
pillows at RISD that people would sit on, it was like, you know,

200
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:51,470
crit happens. It was just, just, just furthering this culture that crit was bad.

201
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,693
Oh, crit, it happens. And no, crit doesn't, yeah, yeah,

202
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:59,098
crit happens. It's awesome. It's this wonderful moment of

203
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:02,181
of working together, sharing. It's a great time, not something

204
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:05,624
to be avoided or, or not look forward to.

205
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,671
and becoming a valuable team member.

206
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:09,331
Going in with that kind of goal also

207
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:11,232
will really help to right away

208
00:08:11,252 --> 00:08:13,433
get, you'll start to find your own strategies.

209
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:15,034
Your own strategies will intuitively rise up

210
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:16,554
if you're keeping some of these goals in mind

211
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:18,655
or if you're just having a goal in general

212
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:19,715
that you have in mind.

213
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:21,296
So let's get down to it.

214
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:22,577
Let's start talking about some strategies.

215
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,338
Some first, some strategies for giving feedback.

216
00:08:25,378 --> 00:08:26,638
I'll talk about two of them today.

217
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:31,640
The first one is define problems before solving them, right?

218
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,060
That's very often the first thing we say is we start to presenting a solution.

219
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,441
Make that red or move that over there.

220
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:42,462
Those are solutions and it becomes they're not as actionable as they could be if you define the problems.

221
00:08:42,482 --> 00:08:45,363
Let's look at an example of that in action.

222
00:08:45,383 --> 00:08:49,204
Let's look at the development of the early Rock Band 1 head style.

223
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:53,905
This Rock Band 1 head style went through a major course correction or change in its style.

224
00:08:55,991 --> 00:09:05,179
If we look at the earlier version, we can think about or imagine some of the less effective solution-based feedback that could have been said about this.

225
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:08,221
For example, it might be said, the head should be more anatomically correct.

226
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,510
What's wrong with that?

227
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:12,671
That's not going to hurt anybody's feelings.

228
00:09:13,131 --> 00:09:14,832
Is that bad feedback?

229
00:09:15,332 --> 00:09:16,733
It's not effective feedback.

230
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:20,235
It's not effective feedback because it's presenting the solution to the problem,

231
00:09:20,515 --> 00:09:22,516
not presenting the problem itself.

232
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,276
As an artist, what are you going to do with this?

233
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:25,757
Well, I can make it anatomically correct.

234
00:09:26,017 --> 00:09:27,038
But how? In what way?

235
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:28,638
There are a lot of ways to make something anatomically correct.

236
00:09:28,898 --> 00:09:30,179
I don't know because I don't know what the goal is.

237
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:31,640
I don't know what problem I'm really trying to solve.

238
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,161
Another example, add more hard edges.

239
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,621
Yeah, OK.

240
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,002
I could do that.

241
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:40,323
I could start slapping in some RDA, but I don't know why.

242
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:41,443
I don't know what problem I'm trying to solve.

243
00:09:41,743 --> 00:09:42,823
So these are solutions being presented.

244
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:43,544
What's the problem?

245
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:47,345
What's a good way of rephrasing this as more problem-focused feedback?

246
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:50,566
We need to create heads that are more anatomically correct,

247
00:09:50,726 --> 00:09:54,367
but still united by a common, iconic style that fits the rock band world.

248
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,628
How can we do that?

249
00:09:57,588 --> 00:09:59,529
Now, let's make a couple comments about this.

250
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:01,310
One, it's longer.

251
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:03,882
Yeah, it's longer.

252
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:04,483
Though, so you might...

253
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,344
I gotta...

254
00:10:05,744 --> 00:10:07,546
It's a lot more efficient for me to say the other stuff.

255
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:08,447
You know, the other stuff is shorter.

256
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:09,308
I want to be right to the point.

257
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:10,108
I want to be direct.

258
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:10,789
You know what?

259
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:11,890
Yeah, you'll be efficient.

260
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,811
You'll be direct right now.

261
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:13,732
But then,

262
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:16,495
you might be not as efficient when the artist doesn't really have a clear goal

263
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,916
and you have to go through a lot more iterations

264
00:10:18,156 --> 00:10:18,977
and it's a lot unclear.

265
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:21,159
So sometimes, effective feedback is longer.

266
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:21,379
It's just...

267
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,760
Just part of it comes with it.

268
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,202
But the overall process becomes much more efficient

269
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:27,243
and much more, it works better.

270
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:29,885
We is a great word to use.

271
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:31,566
You know, want to incorporate the things,

272
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:33,307
make people brought into a common problem,

273
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:35,269
relating it to the art style as it's done here,

274
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:36,590
bringing it to the common rock band world,

275
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,391
and ending with this question, how can we do that?

276
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,153
An invitation to come in and solve this together.

277
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,414
This is something we're all working on.

278
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:44,795
It really helps to improve that feedback.

279
00:10:45,316 --> 00:10:50,963
And in this case those kinds of dialogues really produced this wonderful wonderful head that became this great icon

280
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:55,369
For rock band itself and really helped the whole brand

281
00:10:57,005 --> 00:11:01,086
Another strategy, describe reasoning behind the judgments.

282
00:11:01,987 --> 00:11:05,008
Often we just present, in the same way we often just present a solution to the problem,

283
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:06,488
rather than describing the problem,

284
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:11,109
it's often common for us to just tell, say our judgment,

285
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,070
you know, I don't like that, that's too red, that's too hot, that's too...

286
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,931
Instead of spending some time asking ourselves what is underneath that judgment,

287
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:21,692
and that might be reasons, it might be by describing the experience that's underneath it.

288
00:11:23,006 --> 00:11:24,426
And let's look at some examples to get at this.

289
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,727
We'll look at a few different iterations

290
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:29,908
of the Rock Band 4 main menu screen.

291
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:33,589
This is one of the first early iterations of this.

292
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:35,850
And let's look at some examples

293
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,110
of judgment-focused feedback.

294
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,771
So, feedback is focusing on judgment.

295
00:11:39,851 --> 00:11:42,211
So, someone might say, composition sucks.

296
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:45,087
Well, we can all agree that's bad feedback, right?

297
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:46,787
Obviously, that's not going to be effective at making someone work.

298
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,388
It's going to be really effective at pissing somebody off

299
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,829
and really messing the whole, you know,

300
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:52,829
communication up and messing your relationship up.

301
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:53,749
It's not going to be effective.

302
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:54,509
However, look at this.

303
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,830
The composition is weak.

304
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,170
Well, that's not so bad, right?

305
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,691
That's not really maybe going to hurt my feelings.

306
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:00,791
It might hurt my feelings a little bit.

307
00:12:00,811 --> 00:12:02,051
I don't fully, if so, feel attacked.

308
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:03,292
But you know what?

309
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:05,592
It might not be so bad, but it's still not effective.

310
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:08,053
It's still not effective because it's being presented as a judgment.

311
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:10,734
The underlying experience or reasons behind that judgment

312
00:12:10,794 --> 00:12:11,774
aren't being expressed.

313
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:14,878
Why did you compose the band that way?

314
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:18,401
This is a great example of focusing on the artist rather than the art.

315
00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:19,162
Right?

316
00:12:20,183 --> 00:12:21,103
Every once in a while we need to do this.

317
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:22,384
Every once in a while you have to ask, you know,

318
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:23,585
why did you do this? What's going on here?

319
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:24,806
But be really careful about that.

320
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:26,828
If it can be rephrased in a way that's not focusing on the artist,

321
00:12:26,848 --> 00:12:27,549
but focusing on the art,

322
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:28,790
it's probably going to be more helpful.

323
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,312
The other thing about this, in addition to focusing on the artist,

324
00:12:31,512 --> 00:12:32,513
is it's also a judgment.

325
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:33,534
It's kind of a veiled judgment.

326
00:12:33,594 --> 00:12:34,514
You know, you really...

327
00:12:36,136 --> 00:12:37,938
You really fucked this up. You screwed this up.

328
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:39,780
You know, what's wrong with you?

329
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,703
This is a judgment. Not only a judgment about the art, but now it's a judgment about the artist.

330
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:45,485
You know, and that's not gonna, it's not as effective as it could be.

331
00:12:45,846 --> 00:12:49,690
So, all of these bits of feedback are various levels.

332
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,892
Some are more benign, some are really more harsh.

333
00:12:52,252 --> 00:12:55,736
But what they all share in common is that they're all judgment being presented in different ways.

334
00:12:56,216 --> 00:12:58,337
So how can that become much more effective?

335
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,278
How can it become much more actionable?

336
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:01,259
The same kinds of ideas.

337
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,800
Well, one thing you could do is you

338
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,742
could describe the experience that led to that judgment.

339
00:13:06,182 --> 00:13:07,543
So for example, I might look at this and say,

340
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:11,045
gosh, my eyes just wander all around this thing.

341
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:14,827
I have no sense of primary or secondary focal point.

342
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:18,389
And then my eyes just get locked on that white light

343
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:19,150
shape on his shirt.

344
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,070
It's like a prison.

345
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:20,991
It's locked.

346
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:22,332
And my eyes can't get away from that.

347
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:24,233
And what's happening there is

348
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,177
I'm describing my experience.

349
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:29,067
I'm describing my experience that led to the judgment.

350
00:13:29,705 --> 00:13:30,805
There's a little bit of an irony here, right?

351
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:33,245
On one hand, we want to be more objective and good feedback,

352
00:13:33,506 --> 00:13:34,746
but here I'm using subjectivity.

353
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:35,686
I'm using my experience.

354
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:36,846
But I'm doing it very differently.

355
00:13:37,707 --> 00:13:40,007
I'm not using my personal preference

356
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:40,987
in terms of subjectivity.

357
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:42,688
I'm just saying, I like chocolate.

358
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:43,608
I don't like vanilla.

359
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,088
Not that kind of subjectivity.

360
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:48,929
I'm using my experience to help get at an objective issue

361
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:49,489
in the work.

362
00:13:49,969 --> 00:13:51,270
I'm describing my experience.

363
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,870
And by describing my experience, we

364
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:53,470
start to get at things.

365
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,371
Another thing starts to come out here.

366
00:13:55,731 --> 00:13:57,551
You can start to see now there's some criteria

367
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,432
that the artist can hold on to, right?

368
00:14:00,332 --> 00:14:01,553
primary and secondary focal points.

369
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:04,175
That just is kind of bubbled up by describing experience, right?

370
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:06,057
Because now we have something now the artist can hold on to.

371
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:09,820
It's, oh, I see, now I understand the kind of experience I need to create

372
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:11,141
by working on this composition.

373
00:14:11,382 --> 00:14:13,203
And so now, as I go back into it to improve it,

374
00:14:13,464 --> 00:14:16,086
now I'm excited, because now, not only do I see the problem

375
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,007
because I understand it, but I understand that the real thing I want to do

376
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:18,988
is create an experience.

377
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:20,709
and I understand what kind of experience I want to create,

378
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:21,609
I'm going to dive back into it,

379
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:23,190
and oh, I'm really excited to get to work.

380
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,070
And here's the next iteration,

381
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,691
you can see now we've got some nice primary,

382
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:27,591
secondary focal points,

383
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:29,471
I can see the guitar player,

384
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:30,292
then leading back into,

385
00:14:30,632 --> 00:14:31,872
my eyes are really led around,

386
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:33,753
from the red to back into the blue,

387
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:34,713
starting to get some of that,

388
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:36,053
but we can also do another round now,

389
00:14:36,994 --> 00:14:39,054
of iteration,

390
00:14:39,314 --> 00:14:42,095
and another round of judgment-focused feedback.

391
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:44,496
So let's see, what was another judgment we can place now,

392
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:45,716
on this, you could say,

393
00:14:47,557 --> 00:14:48,717
that's a poor use of camera angle.

394
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:50,600
Another example of judgment,

395
00:14:51,361 --> 00:14:54,125
not really bad, it's not going to really hurt my feelings that you said that.

396
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,669
So this isn't about necessarily hurting feelings, it's not about critique

397
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,256
that is often obviously bad, but it's about often critical feedback that's not

398
00:15:02,876 --> 00:15:05,360
as effective and actionable as it could be. Because how is this actionable?

399
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:07,403
Well, I guess I could change the camera angle.

400
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:10,486
But I'm not really—what do you mean by camera angle?

401
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:12,587
I'm not sure what—I could start playing around with it,

402
00:15:12,627 --> 00:15:13,687
randomly putting camera angles in,

403
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:16,048
but I'm not sure because I don't know what the problem is you're trying to solve.

404
00:15:16,468 --> 00:15:17,348
Right? And I don't know—

405
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:19,749
I don't know exactly where this judgment came from.

406
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,030
So, maybe we could rephrase that

407
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,211
and make it some more effective reason-focused feedback.

408
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:25,671
So, instead of focusing, in this case,

409
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:27,071
on the experience that led to the judgment,

410
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,292
you could focus on the reasons that led to that judgment.

411
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:30,032
So maybe you want to say,

412
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:32,173
you know, the composition as a whole

413
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:34,534
should feel more as energetic as the characters.

414
00:15:35,554 --> 00:15:36,834
Adding tilt to the camera might help.

415
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:38,235
What are some other ideas?

416
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:40,329
Let's dissect that a little bit.

417
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:42,450
So it begins with the reason behind the judgment, right?

418
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,651
And it takes something internal to it.

419
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:46,731
Now we have a criteria we can use

420
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:47,952
as the artist goes into it.

421
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:48,652
They have this criteria.

422
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:50,293
They want to make things energetic, right?

423
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:53,214
It does present a solution here, right?

424
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:55,014
Which is something I suggested earlier not to do.

425
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,915
Adding some kilt to the camera might help.

426
00:15:57,195 --> 00:15:58,495
But the difference here now is this being,

427
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,496
the solution is being presented as an option,

428
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:01,356
as an example.

429
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:03,097
You know, adding some kilt to the camera might help,

430
00:16:03,157 --> 00:16:03,537
or some others.

431
00:16:03,957 --> 00:16:06,378
Incorporate people, bring them into this discussion, right?

432
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:08,741
Well, we can't always do that.

433
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:10,542
We can't always do this, right?

434
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:12,042
There's oftentimes in the production pipeline,

435
00:16:12,062 --> 00:16:13,922
we just don't have time for group discussions.

436
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:15,683
We're really busy, we gotta get this done,

437
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:17,663
this is due tomorrow, it has to happen.

438
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,084
I'm the art director, I know what this needs to happen,

439
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,164
I've been working on this for years,

440
00:16:21,404 --> 00:16:22,464
here's what needs to happen to solve this.

441
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:23,705
What do you do in that case?

442
00:16:24,045 --> 00:16:24,625
Do you just tell them?

443
00:16:24,805 --> 00:16:26,765
You need to tilt the camera angle, do it that way?

444
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:28,066
That's an option.

445
00:16:28,246 --> 00:16:29,606
Another option, which is kind of in the middle,

446
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:31,607
which is I think much more effective and actionable,

447
00:16:32,187 --> 00:16:34,607
is to offer reasoned, focused feedback

448
00:16:35,248 --> 00:16:35,728
that still

449
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:37,848
has the reasons behind it.

450
00:16:38,469 --> 00:16:41,051
So the composition as a whole needs to feel more energetic.

451
00:16:41,351 --> 00:16:42,652
Adding some tilt to the camera will help.

452
00:16:43,313 --> 00:16:45,595
So, don't just say add tilt to the camera,

453
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:47,036
but why does that camera need to be there?

454
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:48,137
What's the reason behind that?

455
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:50,199
So that way the artist has that criteria

456
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,821
that they'll know when they're fixing it,

457
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:52,902
when it's going to be good.

458
00:16:52,982 --> 00:16:54,583
What are they trying to achieve by doing this?

459
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:55,964
So they have the sense of it,

460
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,286
and they can feel empowered then,

461
00:16:57,326 --> 00:16:58,987
even if they're not empowered to...

462
00:16:59,848 --> 00:17:01,269
to come up with their own solution,

463
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:02,869
they're at least empowered to understand

464
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:04,810
whether the solution they're doing is right or not,

465
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,351
because they understand the criteria that's underneath it.

466
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:10,453
And in this case, we ended up with this awesome composition

467
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:13,194
on the Rock Band 4 main menu screen.

468
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:16,035
So those are a couple strategies for giving feedback.

469
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,436
Defining problems rather than solving them.

470
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:21,038
Describing reasons rather than just the judgments,

471
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:23,319
or also giving the experience behind the judgments.

472
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,360
And they're fairly simple, they're fairly basic.

473
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:29,241
But if these things are so basic and simple,

474
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:31,982
Why do I always screw this up?

475
00:17:33,143 --> 00:17:35,144
I've been thinking about this a lot as a teacher,

476
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:37,785
as an artist for a number of years, a video game company.

477
00:17:37,805 --> 00:17:39,746
I'm engaged in critical feedback every day.

478
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:43,388
I still, to this day, often judgments come out,

479
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:44,509
solutions come out.

480
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:46,270
Why is this so hard?

481
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,031
Why is this deceptively simple and actually fairly difficult

482
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:49,291
to do?

483
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:51,412
It's because it actually involves two steps.

484
00:17:52,373 --> 00:17:54,934
First, we have to recognize where our first response is,

485
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:57,836
as our intuitive gut response, and stop it.

486
00:17:58,664 --> 00:18:01,206
or catch stuff that's coming out of our mouth and add on to it.

487
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:03,068
So first we have to recognize our first response,

488
00:18:03,368 --> 00:18:05,490
and then we have to reflect and rephrase.

489
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,293
So we have to catch what that is, and we have to think about it,

490
00:18:08,313 --> 00:18:09,594
and we have to rephrase it to become more effective.

491
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:10,555
That makes it really difficult.

492
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:11,897
It's also the case...

493
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:13,872
when we're receiving feedback.

494
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:15,133
When we're receiving feedback,

495
00:18:15,153 --> 00:18:16,434
we'll go into some strategies for that now,

496
00:18:16,674 --> 00:18:19,156
we also have to often stop ourselves

497
00:18:19,176 --> 00:18:20,097
from our initial response,

498
00:18:20,117 --> 00:18:21,337
which is tending to be pretty defensive.

499
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:23,179
Oh, oh, I already thought about that.

500
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:24,340
Oh, being defensive.

501
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,421
And putting that first response down

502
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:29,063
and then going into the receiving of the feedback.

503
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:31,345
Here's some strategies that can help us do that.

504
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:34,066
The first is to ask questions that encourage critics

505
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:35,988
to define the problems or describe the reasons.

506
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:37,148
So basically, this is the same strategy

507
00:18:37,168 --> 00:18:38,529
as I talked about before, but in this case,

508
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:39,610
you're on the receiving end of it.

509
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,291
So when the person giving you feedback

510
00:18:41,731 --> 00:18:44,033
isn't phrasing their feedback as defining problems,

511
00:18:44,073 --> 00:18:46,434
or they're not phrasing it as describing the reasons,

512
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,555
then what you can do is take that feedback,

513
00:18:48,575 --> 00:18:50,957
that raw lump of coal, and you can start asking questions

514
00:18:50,977 --> 00:18:52,778
to turn it into the diamond that's hidden inside of it.

515
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,379
So look at an example of that.

516
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:57,247
This is a monkey.

517
00:18:57,807 --> 00:18:58,627
I love this monkey.

518
00:18:59,328 --> 00:19:00,748
This is a monkey from Disney Fantasia,

519
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:02,609
Music Evolved, from one of our scenes.

520
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:05,811
It was awesome concept art by Gianna Ruggiero.

521
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,811
And I loved it.

522
00:19:06,951 --> 00:19:08,692
I loved this monkey, and Gianna loved it,

523
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:09,993
and we were really happy with it.

524
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:11,714
But unfortunately, it wasn't fitting in

525
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,555
to some larger narrative and art direction issues,

526
00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:15,356
and so it needed to be changed.

527
00:19:15,396 --> 00:19:17,056
And that was a little bit unclear for a while.

528
00:19:17,096 --> 00:19:20,998
And there was some poorly phrased solution-focused feedback,

529
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,859
such as, make the monkey older.

530
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,862
Now if we all imagine ourselves as Gianna,

531
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:27,243
we get that, we make the monkey older.

532
00:19:27,263 --> 00:19:28,044
So, oh, yeah.

533
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:29,065
Okay.

534
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:30,606
I can make the monkey older.

535
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:32,688
But what, what, how?

536
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:33,248
How old?

537
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:34,009
I don't know.

538
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:34,470
Why?

539
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,190
What's going on?

540
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,151
You know, it's unclear.

541
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:36,632
Right?

542
00:19:36,652 --> 00:19:37,172
So how could that be?

543
00:19:37,432 --> 00:19:40,015
What could you do if you're in Gianna's position?

544
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:42,497
We could start to ask questions to reveal the problem

545
00:19:42,737 --> 00:19:43,778
underneath that solution.

546
00:19:43,978 --> 00:19:45,079
What, what are the, what are we?

547
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:48,691
How would an older monkey fit into this scene more successfully?

548
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,853
What is it about age that's important here?

549
00:19:51,593 --> 00:19:52,414
Why an older monkey?

550
00:19:52,714 --> 00:19:53,315
Or just simply,

551
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:55,717
what problem are you trying to solve with that solution?

552
00:19:55,757 --> 00:19:56,978
Just ask it, right?

553
00:19:56,998 --> 00:20:01,201
Let's look at an example of some poorly phrased judgment-focused feedback

554
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:03,023
that could have also been about the same

555
00:20:03,643 --> 00:20:04,244
awesome monkey.

556
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:06,366
The monkey's too goofy.

557
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:08,948
Yeah.

558
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:11,270
Monkeys are goofy.

559
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:14,632
What's wrong with that?

560
00:20:15,527 --> 00:20:17,309
So, you know, okay, that's my first response,

561
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,111
if I hear that, if I'm Gianna, I hear,

562
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:22,075
yeah, I'm a monkey, so, ooh, I'm gonna stop that.

563
00:20:22,616 --> 00:20:24,117
That's not helpful, right?

564
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:26,300
So obviously this bit of poorly-faced feedback

565
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,902
has some, it's as lump as coal,

566
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:29,023
what's the diamond inside?

567
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:30,124
How can I get that out?

568
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:31,226
I can start asking some questions.

569
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:33,528
You know, okay, so let's ask some questions

570
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:35,330
to reveal what's behind the judgment.

571
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:38,192
What feelings do you think the monkey should evoke?

572
00:20:38,652 --> 00:20:41,093
What kind of feelings should people have when they're looking at this monkey?

573
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,314
If they don't want to make him feel goofy, what kind of feelings should be there?

574
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,254
So we asked these kinds of questions, we got to the issue,

575
00:20:47,474 --> 00:20:50,575
and the real issue turned out to be...

576
00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:55,196
We asked these questions, the poorly phrased feedback was transformed

577
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,237
through our asking of questions, and finding out that really we need a monkey

578
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:03,158
that fits into a narrative based on sadness, isolation, and an attempt to connect.

579
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:05,904
Oh, okay.

580
00:21:06,424 --> 00:21:09,205
Now we can start to think, now I understand why those issues are,

581
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:10,886
now we understand there are problems trying to be solved.

582
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,907
Okay, so we've taken that poorly phrased feedback,

583
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,127
we've asked some questions, and we've transformed it

584
00:21:16,387 --> 00:21:18,828
into something that's really helpful, and now we can dive into it,

585
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,969
and we end up with this awesome, awesome monkey

586
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,110
that has this amazing sense of empathy,

587
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,591
that you're lost in space, you can't get to this monkey,

588
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:27,671
you're trying to help the monkey.

589
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:30,772
It was... I love this monkey.

590
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:35,420
I love both versions of the monkey, but the second version of the monkey was obviously

591
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,022
the most relevant one because it was appropriate for what we needed.

592
00:21:38,762 --> 00:21:41,724
Another strategy for receiving feedback is frame the critique.

593
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:46,467
Let's look at an example of the development of a scene, also from Disney, from Fantasia

594
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:47,868
Music Evolved, called The Haven.

595
00:21:48,628 --> 00:21:55,172
In this case, the art lead David Barilena and Don Rivers, the cinematographer and lighting

596
00:21:55,192 --> 00:21:59,115
designer, knew that we had to make this scene to be much more iconic.

597
00:21:59,155 --> 00:22:00,916
We needed to make it different from all the other scenes.

598
00:22:01,556 --> 00:22:03,579
We had to find a way to give it its own identity,

599
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:06,462
and we had to do this really late in the production process.

600
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:07,804
Everything had already been made.

601
00:22:07,984 --> 00:22:09,086
We couldn't change any assets.

602
00:22:09,266 --> 00:22:11,229
So they did a great job of framing that critique

603
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:12,170
when they brought it to the group,

604
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,212
so they'd get the feedback that wouldn't be off base,

605
00:22:14,252 --> 00:22:16,676
wouldn't be feedback that was taken away from those things.

606
00:22:16,716 --> 00:22:18,398
So it's just by framing the critique.

607
00:22:18,998 --> 00:22:20,219
you know, the things I just mentioned.

608
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:21,880
We need to give this scene an iconic look

609
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:23,662
using the elements that already exist.

610
00:22:23,682 --> 00:22:25,223
So right away, you're not going to start getting feedback of,

611
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,764
oh, change the trees, let's get some new trees.

612
00:22:26,824 --> 00:22:28,085
That's not an option, so let's not waste our time

613
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:28,825
getting that kind of feedback.

614
00:22:29,045 --> 00:22:31,287
Let's frame the critique to get the feedback

615
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:32,047
that's most effective.

616
00:22:33,468 --> 00:22:34,529
And it ends up with this awesome,

617
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,571
really iconic looking, beautiful, beautiful scene.

618
00:22:40,747 --> 00:22:42,348
Third strategy for receiving feedback,

619
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:44,350
look for themes in the feedback.

620
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,532
So this is a great one if you can't ask questions.

621
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:49,233
Maybe somebody walked by your desk

622
00:22:49,273 --> 00:22:50,894
and dropped a bomb on you and walked away.

623
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,035
You can ask them some questions.

624
00:22:52,055 --> 00:22:53,716
Or maybe it came from the client or whoever.

625
00:22:53,896 --> 00:22:55,357
But for some reason, you're not in the position

626
00:22:55,377 --> 00:22:56,118
where you can ask questions.

627
00:22:56,278 --> 00:22:57,839
You're not in the position where you can frame the feedback

628
00:22:57,859 --> 00:22:58,559
before it happens.

629
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,941
So this is a great strategy in those situations.

630
00:23:01,261 --> 00:23:02,982
And so we'll look at another scene from Disney Fantasia,

631
00:23:03,243 --> 00:23:04,523
Music Evolved, the nation scene.

632
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:06,285
This scene, I'll go back one.

633
00:23:06,445 --> 00:23:08,706
This was a beautiful work of concept art.

634
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:13,609
But once we got it into the roughed out, grey boxy version of itself,

635
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,431
we realized there were some problems.

636
00:23:16,151 --> 00:23:17,872
And unfortunately we realized those problems after

637
00:23:18,332 --> 00:23:20,514
the animation of the dragon coming from this mountain was already there.

638
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:22,735
So the mountain was locked in place, which was a problem.

639
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:24,256
So we started getting all this feedback,

640
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,277
when it was like, move the volcano back,

641
00:23:27,618 --> 00:23:29,239
the area between the city and the mountains is boring,

642
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,361
make the background trees smaller.

643
00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:33,903
add some flying creatures in the forest.

644
00:23:34,483 --> 00:23:36,184
And you know, we tried some of these things, some we couldn't do.

645
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:39,487
We couldn't move the mountain because we didn't have time to redo the animation on the dragon.

646
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:42,069
And we tried some of these others. We were playing with these details.

647
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:43,550
But finally what we realized we needed to do

648
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,232
was we needed to take all that feedback and put it in a bucket

649
00:23:47,032 --> 00:23:48,674
and look at it, across it,

650
00:23:49,374 --> 00:23:51,156
and say, what is common with all of this?

651
00:23:51,356 --> 00:23:53,938
What are we being told in all these bits of feedback?

652
00:23:54,138 --> 00:23:57,320
And what we were being told in all of those was the common theme.

653
00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:01,532
And the common theme was the space feels shallow, it lacks excitement.

654
00:24:01,832 --> 00:24:03,814
And so we started thinking, well, what can we do? How can we change that?

655
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:06,077
We came up with the idea, we can't change depth because we can't move that mountain,

656
00:24:06,297 --> 00:24:08,620
but we can't change it in Z, but we can change it in Y.

657
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:13,405
Let's just drop the floor, and suddenly we can have this big, vast space that feels vast,

658
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,487
you can see through it now, so it feels like it's deeper,

659
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,369
even though it's not deeper, you can see back through there.

660
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,653
And also now we can put the dragon on this ledge

661
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:22,934
that feels floating in space,

662
00:24:22,954 --> 00:24:24,255
we don't really understand its depth anymore.

663
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:25,697
So it solved a lot of bunch of problems.

664
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:27,959
But we didn't get there until we looked at the themes

665
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:28,960
running across all that critique

666
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,341
and started to deal with them as a group

667
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:32,242
rather than trying to deal with each bit of feedback

668
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:34,004
one on one, one on one on its own.

669
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:41,084
So, let's just kind of recap the strategies I've talked about over the last 20 minutes.

670
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:46,271
First, were strategies for giving feedback and describing the problem rather than solving it,

671
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:49,094
and describing reasons or experience that lead to judgments.

672
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,801
and also strategies for receiving feedback.

673
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:55,564
Asking questions, focusing the critique,

674
00:24:55,684 --> 00:24:56,505
looking for themes.

675
00:24:57,085 --> 00:24:58,767
One other thing I'll add to one of these

676
00:24:58,787 --> 00:25:00,288
is when you describe reasons or experience,

677
00:25:00,468 --> 00:25:01,649
or when you ask people to describe

678
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,370
the reasons or experience,

679
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,771
it also helps to reveal sometimes

680
00:25:04,032 --> 00:25:06,034
if something someone has said is purely personal.

681
00:25:06,294 --> 00:25:07,275
Let me give a quick example of that.

682
00:25:07,735 --> 00:25:09,557
Say you've got a horror game,

683
00:25:10,358 --> 00:25:12,139
and so feedback somebody gives you is,

684
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,162
you know, I really don't like that character.

685
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:17,651
Or, that character's really not good.

686
00:25:17,671 --> 00:25:21,355
And you say, well, that character makes me feel bad.

687
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:24,118
And you say, well, tell me about the experience

688
00:25:24,138 --> 00:25:27,242
you're having with that character that led to that judgment.

689
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:30,205
Oh, gosh, every time I see her, she scares the hell out of me.

690
00:25:31,202 --> 00:25:33,723
Well, so obviously it's a case where, that's good!

691
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:36,325
You want that character to scale the hell out of you, right?

692
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:38,626
And this is just an obvious and simple example

693
00:25:38,887 --> 00:25:40,568
of what often can happen, which is sometimes

694
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:41,989
someone gives you a piece of judgment,

695
00:25:42,189 --> 00:25:43,029
or they give you something,

696
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:45,171
and they think it might be criticism,

697
00:25:45,391 --> 00:25:46,451
but once you start to dig underneath it,

698
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:48,653
you find actually it's not, it might be awesome.

699
00:25:48,913 --> 00:25:50,574
And it's a great example of times

700
00:25:50,594 --> 00:25:51,975
where when you're receiving feedback,

701
00:25:52,355 --> 00:25:54,016
don't immediately react to it.

702
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:58,204
dig underneath it to find out what's really there because it might actually be awesome.

703
00:25:58,244 --> 00:25:59,666
It might be that it's great.

704
00:26:00,147 --> 00:26:01,969
Same thing too, when somebody says something really nice to you,

705
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,012
oh, I love that red you've used.

706
00:26:04,392 --> 00:26:07,356
In that case, my initial feedback is, my initial response is to go,

707
00:26:07,697 --> 00:26:09,059
oh, thank you. That's great.

708
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:12,190
But instead, that's still a lump of coal.

709
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,811
Because I can't do it, it's not actionable yet.

710
00:26:14,411 --> 00:26:15,792
So you say, I love that red you use.

711
00:26:15,812 --> 00:26:17,312
Oh, what is it about the red that you love?

712
00:26:17,612 --> 00:26:18,273
How is it functioning?

713
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:20,594
You ask some questions, dig underneath both the good feedback

714
00:26:20,674 --> 00:26:22,315
and the difficult feedback to really get

715
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:24,696
the stuff underneath it, and it becomes much more actionable.

716
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:29,338
Takeaways that I think would be helpful for today,

717
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:32,439
the things I would hope that you could take away from this brief

718
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:33,600
chat about critique.

719
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,541
First, clearly define your goals.

720
00:26:36,547 --> 00:26:40,830
If you understand what you're doing, it will really help to make what you're saying deeper and not just so much on the surface.

721
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,392
Focus on critique and not just criticizing.

722
00:26:43,552 --> 00:26:47,294
So take things apart, examine them, don't just have comments that go on the surface.

723
00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:50,136
Remember that all criticism is potential critique.

724
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:51,717
The examples I was just giving.

725
00:26:51,938 --> 00:26:53,859
Even if someone says a nice thing to you, it makes you feel good.

726
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,641
Even if somebody... it all can be potentially good.

727
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:59,883
And you want to try to find the information underneath it and make it actionable.

728
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:03,252
and then recognize, reflect, and rephrase.

729
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:05,673
Try to stop yourself from saying what initially you might say,

730
00:27:05,953 --> 00:27:07,053
think about how it's going to be effective,

731
00:27:07,253 --> 00:27:09,074
and think about how rephrasing it in some effective ways.

732
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:11,895
And remember that our first reactions are often really

733
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:14,436
poorly phrased and not as helpful as they could be.

734
00:27:16,387 --> 00:27:18,449
So those are some of my ideas for critique.

735
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:20,151
And I've been thinking about this a long time,

736
00:27:20,231 --> 00:27:21,712
and I love thinking about this kind of stuff.

737
00:27:21,952 --> 00:27:22,953
I still struggle with it.

738
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,918
And I am mostly interested in the conversation itself.

739
00:27:27,518 --> 00:27:29,440
And I just, as an invitation, please,

740
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:31,883
if any of you are also interested in thinking about this,

741
00:27:32,703 --> 00:27:34,524
shoot me some emails, hang out afterwards,

742
00:27:34,564 --> 00:27:35,544
I would love to hear your stories,

743
00:27:35,584 --> 00:27:36,745
I'd love to hear your strategies.

744
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:38,205
You know, these are some strategies I've come up with,

745
00:27:38,225 --> 00:27:39,066
there's lots of others.

746
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:42,007
And we'll have a few minutes for questions,

747
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,527
but also afterwards, if you don't feel like

748
00:27:43,547 --> 00:27:44,707
doing questions, you just want to have a chat,

749
00:27:44,948 --> 00:27:45,808
I'll be in the wrap-up room,

750
00:27:45,828 --> 00:27:47,628
because I'd really like this to be the beginning

751
00:27:47,949 --> 00:27:49,149
of a larger conversation about this.

752
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:51,010
I think it's something that is really important

753
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,711
for our industry to really focus on,

754
00:27:53,871 --> 00:27:55,171
and many of us do it great,

755
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:57,512
but it'd be great if all of us could do it even better,

756
00:27:57,952 --> 00:27:59,432
and especially across disciplines.

757
00:27:59,592 --> 00:28:01,273
I think finding ways to make this interdisciplinary

758
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:02,333
would be really awesome.

759
00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:03,494
Thank you all very much.

760
00:28:03,514 --> 00:28:09,739
Applause

761
00:28:14,843 --> 00:28:20,147
So, how do you deal with a lead or an art director that says the dreaded three words,

762
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:24,130
I don't know, to any of your questions?

763
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,811
First of all, that's an awesome art director.

764
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:31,092
As an aside, it is, because they're not going to lie.

765
00:28:31,452 --> 00:28:31,672
Right?

766
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:35,013
As an aside, I've had a doctor for many, many years.

767
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:37,714
One of the things I love about my doctor, Dr. Stephen Scott,

768
00:28:37,754 --> 00:28:39,235
if anybody happens to live in Providence, Rhode Island

769
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:40,675
and wants to find a physician.

770
00:28:40,695 --> 00:28:42,116
The thing I love about Stephen Scott

771
00:28:42,496 --> 00:28:43,996
is that he will always say,

772
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:45,917
I don't know, gosh, I'm going to look into that.

773
00:28:46,137 --> 00:28:46,537
Instead of...

774
00:28:47,423 --> 00:28:49,644
making some bullshit up.

775
00:28:50,844 --> 00:28:52,264
So that's the first thing.

776
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:54,065
I don't know the context, but in general,

777
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:55,866
someone saying I don't know is often a great thing,

778
00:28:55,886 --> 00:28:57,106
that they're willing to say that.

779
00:28:57,906 --> 00:28:59,407
What's the context you're thinking of in particular

780
00:28:59,427 --> 00:29:00,227
when someone said I don't know?

781
00:29:00,247 --> 00:29:02,828
Like if you have, if they give you feedback

782
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,328
and you ask a leading question as to,

783
00:29:04,428 --> 00:29:05,509
oh, why do you feel that way?

784
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:07,069
And they say, I don't know, full stop.

785
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:09,990
Like there's no constructive feedback whatsoever

786
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,691
beyond the, you know, that's it.

787
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:14,171
Maybe ask another question.

788
00:29:14,632 --> 00:29:16,653
I mean, obviously, it's not going to be.

789
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:18,095
Also, another way you can say is,

790
00:29:18,555 --> 00:29:21,117
you know, it's really good just to say,

791
00:29:21,137 --> 00:29:23,559
well, I don't know your relationship with the art director,

792
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:25,561
but somebody say, gosh, you know,

793
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:27,202
that's, it's not really helpful for me.

794
00:29:27,242 --> 00:29:28,443
One thing that would be really helpful for me

795
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,605
is if I could understand some of the stuff underneath this.

796
00:29:30,905 --> 00:29:32,446
Or, you know, just kind of finding ways

797
00:29:32,486 --> 00:29:33,888
to kind of keep that conversation going.

798
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:35,607
Is that helpful?

799
00:29:35,867 --> 00:29:36,307
A little bit.

800
00:29:36,647 --> 00:29:38,789
Yeah, but yeah, I think the other thing you can do

801
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:39,589
is find the other strategies.

802
00:29:39,629 --> 00:29:40,830
You can start to dissect it yourself.

803
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:41,890
So if they gave you something,

804
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,171
and you ask them what made you feel that way,

805
00:29:43,191 --> 00:29:44,092
and they just say, I don't know,

806
00:29:44,572 --> 00:29:45,292
you can take that feedback

807
00:29:45,332 --> 00:29:47,253
and try to put yourself in that position.

808
00:29:47,274 --> 00:29:48,754
It's like, okay, if this is the case,

809
00:29:48,774 --> 00:29:50,756
you know, like looking at one of the examples I said,

810
00:29:50,776 --> 00:29:52,176
if the camera angle needs to change,

811
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:53,977
start saying, well, what is it about it

812
00:29:53,997 --> 00:29:55,899
that might make that camera need to change?

813
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:56,979
You try to get inside of it,

814
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:59,641
and you can try to imagine what the underlying reasons are.

815
00:29:59,661 --> 00:30:00,881
Okay, cool, thanks.

816
00:30:02,255 --> 00:30:02,416
Yeah.

817
00:30:02,716 --> 00:30:04,058
Hi.

818
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:12,473
Do you have any tips for stimulating a team to give more critique?

819
00:30:12,674 --> 00:30:14,818
Because I have a team that...

820
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,190
they're all friends and

821
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,271
they have good relationships

822
00:30:21,951 --> 00:30:25,913
they're not very comfortable critiquing each other

823
00:30:26,653 --> 00:30:27,273
yes, I do

824
00:30:28,313 --> 00:30:31,694
yeah, and there's an essay I wrote that was in a book that almost got published

825
00:30:31,714 --> 00:30:32,995
I'm going to try to find a way to self-publish it

826
00:30:33,015 --> 00:30:34,575
there's a whole

827
00:30:36,436 --> 00:30:40,277
bunch about how to do group critiques in ways, but I'll give you one thing that can be really helpful

828
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:43,378
and that is often people go into a critique and they think they have to judge

829
00:30:44,189 --> 00:30:45,149
and that's not true.

830
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,752
In fact, judgment, we know this from playtesting, right?

831
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:50,094
Playtesters give us their experience

832
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:51,155
and that's what helps us understand

833
00:30:51,175 --> 00:30:51,936
whether the game is working.

834
00:30:52,257 --> 00:30:53,858
And you can think of critique as the same way.

835
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:56,921
Think of critique as a time to be playtesting

836
00:30:57,101 --> 00:30:58,323
the artwork or whatever it is.

837
00:30:58,543 --> 00:30:59,704
So you can put people in front and say,

838
00:31:00,104 --> 00:31:02,767
let's all just talk about how we experience this work.

839
00:31:03,087 --> 00:31:06,668
So if it's a bunch of people, instead of them feeling like they have to judge each other,

840
00:31:06,968 --> 00:31:10,669
take that out of the equation, right? This isn't about judging, it's about describing.

841
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:15,471
So we sit in front of a worker of art and say, okay, where are your eyes looking when you look

842
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:19,752
at this? Or, that's a leading question, or you can start to say, let's go around and everyone

843
00:31:19,772 --> 00:31:23,413
starts to just describe an experience they're having when they play through this level.

844
00:31:23,773 --> 00:31:24,933
What's an experience you had?

845
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,234
And then people start to describe their experiences.

846
00:31:27,494 --> 00:31:29,935
And by describing experiences then, you can start to say,

847
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:31,695
oh, that was the experience we wanted to have,

848
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:33,016
or that wasn't the experience we wanted to have.

849
00:31:33,276 --> 00:31:34,877
And then you can start to find out what the problems are.

850
00:31:35,037 --> 00:31:38,098
So you kind of bubble it up from organic experience,

851
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:39,578
rather than thinking you have to judge.

852
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:41,499
And that's one thing I, when I taught,

853
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:43,079
that's how I always did all my critiques.

854
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:43,699
I would just say, okay.

855
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,821
We're not going to judge at all.

856
00:31:46,342 --> 00:31:47,483
And students are like, what?

857
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,164
Thank God.

858
00:31:48,725 --> 00:31:50,627
But then they think that it wasn't going to be real critique.

859
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:52,189
But that's what real critique is, actually.

860
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:54,451
Real critique is the taking apart and analyzing.

861
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,720
Is that helpful?

862
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,601
Yeah, I love it.

863
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,362
Thank you.

864
00:31:58,962 --> 00:31:59,062
Yeah.

865
00:31:59,323 --> 00:32:02,805
Yeah, actually, I tend to find that a lot of the ways

866
00:32:02,845 --> 00:32:04,586
to really break loose on the critiquing

867
00:32:04,707 --> 00:32:07,389
is to create a third party separate thing

868
00:32:07,409 --> 00:32:08,469
that you're doing first.

869
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,552
So for example, if we're approaching a project,

870
00:32:11,572 --> 00:32:13,693
to look at other people's versions of the projects,

871
00:32:14,394 --> 00:32:15,614
and where all of you are able to feel

872
00:32:15,635 --> 00:32:17,596
like you're safe to talk to each other

873
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:19,457
because it's not somebody who's in the room,

874
00:32:19,978 --> 00:32:21,499
you're already getting the language going.

875
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:27,331
So as the language gets going and then you ultimately come back around to work that you're doing or you're a little bit later in the project

876
00:32:28,051 --> 00:32:32,814
People tend to feel a little more comfortable critiquing each other because they feel like they've been in the presence of hearing critiquing

877
00:32:32,854 --> 00:32:38,837
That is a great point. Yeah, establishing a culture and which and this one thing that harmonics does so well

878
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:45,940
I just love working at this company because harmonics also has this great culture of giving critique and and we all have the dialogue for

879
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,881
It we all are used to talking about each other's work

880
00:32:48,142 --> 00:32:51,163
And if you're in a situation where that may not exist,

881
00:32:51,183 --> 00:32:52,643
this may relate to the previous question too,

882
00:32:52,983 --> 00:32:55,084
then part of what you can do, this is a great example,

883
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:57,464
is find ways to instill dialogues about critique

884
00:32:57,765 --> 00:32:59,465
about something that's different.

885
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:00,545
Bring in some other games,

886
00:33:00,585 --> 00:33:01,886
have a discussion about another game.

887
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,207
Bring in anything that you can start having,

888
00:33:05,407 --> 00:33:08,128
just practicing the muscles of critical feedback.

889
00:33:08,348 --> 00:33:09,988
It really does seem to be a factor,

890
00:33:10,128 --> 00:33:12,409
is the more that people are just kind of used to

891
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:14,890
feeling like they can start talking to each other

892
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,330
with negative language that...

893
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,372
at least they would think would be negative,

894
00:33:18,772 --> 00:33:20,834
and actually be something that just spurs further

895
00:33:20,894 --> 00:33:23,176
conversation, I tend to find it's very effective.

896
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:23,937
That's wonderful.

897
00:33:23,977 --> 00:33:24,778
Thank you for sharing that.

898
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:30,182
So my question relates to some issues I've seen.

899
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:32,965
Within our company, we do a lot of feedbacks on game designs.

900
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,287
A lot of times we're doing this, well, we still

901
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:36,808
don't have prototypes that you can play with.

902
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:38,550
So we're just talking about, do you

903
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,411
think this would be fun?

904
00:33:39,431 --> 00:33:40,272
Do you think it would be fun?

905
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:40,732
Good point, yes.

906
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:44,796
In those kind of situations, we had a number of times run into a lot of problems.

907
00:33:45,777 --> 00:33:51,202
One of them is, you know, if you're just coming to a meeting and you get presented with it,

908
00:33:51,302 --> 00:33:54,125
I've noticed some people, they don't like to give critique because they're like,

909
00:33:54,205 --> 00:33:57,168
I'm still thinking about it, I don't know, I've got to really think.

910
00:33:58,229 --> 00:34:01,232
And so sometimes we'll say, okay, well, we sent out the material ahead of time.

911
00:34:01,652 --> 00:34:03,654
But when we did that, what we noticed is,

912
00:34:03,894 --> 00:34:06,096
just the speed at which you can think through and iterate

913
00:34:06,116 --> 00:34:07,838
through stuff, for better or worse,

914
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:09,039
just slows down a little bit.

915
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,163
A second issue we ran into is, at least in situations

916
00:34:13,183 --> 00:34:16,166
like these, invariably, there's something

917
00:34:16,206 --> 00:34:17,467
that is subjective, right?

918
00:34:17,687 --> 00:34:19,389
I just think this game play is fun.

919
00:34:20,009 --> 00:34:21,731
I just think that game play is not fun.

920
00:34:22,411 --> 00:34:27,977
And so, you know, it's like how do you address these kind of things where fundamentally it is a subjective?

921
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:30,040
Yeah, I think those are both great points.

922
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:35,305
I'll start with the second one first, and the second one is that in this case, it's someone who just doesn't have practice

923
00:34:35,566 --> 00:34:40,211
explaining their subjectivity. And because that's just not the, when you say, I don't, I just don't like it,

924
00:34:40,771 --> 00:34:44,115
there's always some sort of experience underneath there that's leading to that.

925
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:46,596
subjective reaction, right?

926
00:34:46,956 --> 00:34:48,176
And some people just aren't good and don't

927
00:34:48,196 --> 00:34:49,596
have a lot of practice at explaining

928
00:34:49,616 --> 00:34:50,617
what that is underneath there.

929
00:34:50,997 --> 00:34:52,577
And that's where it just takes someone

930
00:34:52,597 --> 00:34:56,478
who's got a talented facilitator to start to say, OK,

931
00:34:57,018 --> 00:34:58,518
what is it about that you don't like?

932
00:34:59,459 --> 00:35:00,039
What experience?

933
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:00,379
Describe.

934
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:01,719
You can just pull it back and say, well,

935
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:03,519
describe the experience that you're having of it for me,

936
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,080
or finding ways to ask questions that start to get at that.

937
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,680
So I think there always are ways.

938
00:35:08,381 --> 00:35:09,641
This idea of I just don't like it.

939
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:11,744
there's always something underneath it.

940
00:35:11,764 --> 00:35:13,027
There's a reason you don't like it.

941
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:15,371
You just may not be able to articulate it yet.

942
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:17,436
You may need some help articulating it.

943
00:35:17,796 --> 00:35:19,460
And that's just a skill building exercise

944
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,865
and good facilitators can kind of help with that.

945
00:35:22,825 --> 00:35:26,349
Your other point about giving things ahead or people not being ready, I think it's always

946
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:31,393
helpful if somebody isn't ready to give feedback, not to force it, because then that's a recipe

947
00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:31,934
for bullshit.

948
00:35:31,994 --> 00:35:35,437
Because that's when, and I would always say this to my students, if you don't know what

949
00:35:35,457 --> 00:35:38,740
you're going to say, slapping words on it because you feel like you have to say something

950
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,281
is the worst thing you can do.

951
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:43,662
Because that's the definition, the definition of bullshit.

952
00:35:44,303 --> 00:35:46,343
Language that is not connected to reality.

953
00:35:46,723 --> 00:35:49,284
Just language for the sake of language.

954
00:35:49,804 --> 00:35:56,907
And so that ability to say, I'm having some feelings

955
00:35:56,927 --> 00:35:58,287
about this here and I can't articulate them yet.

956
00:35:58,387 --> 00:35:58,787
Give me some time.

957
00:35:59,187 --> 00:36:00,468
So if you have to articulate the meaning,

958
00:36:00,488 --> 00:36:02,428
that's when a good facilitator also can help.

959
00:36:02,488 --> 00:36:04,809
OK, let me help you articulate it and start asking questions

960
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,470
to try to get at what that is.

961
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,251
And so those are a couple thoughts.

962
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:11,131
Was that helpful?

963
00:36:11,512 --> 00:36:12,052
Did I address your...

964
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:12,352
Yeah.

965
00:36:12,693 --> 00:36:12,833
Yes.

966
00:36:14,154 --> 00:36:18,317
The strategies that you posted, do you feel they have to be tailored based on the experience

967
00:36:18,357 --> 00:36:22,921
level of an individual if you're providing feedback to a junior artist or a senior artist,

968
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:26,303
or do you think it's abstract enough that it could work for anyone's experience level?

969
00:36:26,343 --> 00:36:28,585
I think they're abstract enough to be universal.

970
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:31,407
This idea of simply, you know...

971
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:34,393
presenting the problem rather than just giving someone

972
00:36:34,413 --> 00:36:37,014
a solution, that works across all levels.

973
00:36:37,054 --> 00:36:38,535
And when I was a teacher, I was fortunate enough

974
00:36:38,555 --> 00:36:39,496
to teach all levels.

975
00:36:39,536 --> 00:36:41,397
I taught freshmen all the way up to graduate students.

976
00:36:41,977 --> 00:36:44,539
And I did the same stuff with everybody.

977
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:49,301
And there are different levels of depth of discussion

978
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:50,922
we could have at different levels,

979
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,384
but the strategies underneath that were the same.

980
00:36:54,164 --> 00:36:54,765
Was that helpful?

981
00:36:54,985 --> 00:36:55,105
Yeah.

982
00:36:55,585 --> 00:36:55,725
Yeah.

983
00:36:57,842 --> 00:37:00,705
Ryan Locke from Abertay University in Scotland.

984
00:37:01,145 --> 00:37:05,950
I'd be really interested in some advice from yourself based on the discussion we just had.

985
00:37:06,651 --> 00:37:11,756
I'm really fascinated by this area in particular because I work in computer arts mostly

986
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:18,763
and I deal with students across multiple disciplines, whether it's concept design, 3D graphics or design, illustration.

987
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:20,825
There are quite a lot of things going on there.

988
00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:24,448
And one of my main objectives with my third year group

989
00:37:24,468 --> 00:37:26,650
in particular, so this is the year

990
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,072
before they do their final year, is

991
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,214
to develop a community of critique,

992
00:37:31,355 --> 00:37:33,256
because it's me versus a lot of students.

993
00:37:33,717 --> 00:37:37,620
Often I'm the single point for critique or feedback,

994
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,663
and I'm not always available or I'm busy.

995
00:37:41,564 --> 00:37:43,346
There's probably a lot of other issues

996
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,068
there in terms of other classes and how busy they are,

997
00:37:46,128 --> 00:37:46,709
blah, blah, blah, blah.

998
00:37:47,389 --> 00:37:53,615
But that idea of fostering a community or preparing students for industry or even outside,

999
00:37:53,635 --> 00:37:58,459
well it doesn't have to be industry, but do you have any advice in terms of your experience

1000
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:03,424
in education and how you might help foster a better community of critique in students?

1001
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:09,937
Yeah, I think part of it has to do with getting out of this idea that critique is bad.

1002
00:38:10,378 --> 00:38:11,839
It's something to be avoided.

1003
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,761
It's so ironic.

1004
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:19,107
Some place like RISD values itself on the fact that it's a great place to learn critique,

1005
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:19,587
and it is.

1006
00:38:19,607 --> 00:38:22,470
I mean, RISD is an amazing school for learning critical thought.

1007
00:38:23,111 --> 00:38:24,092
It's the core of what they do.

1008
00:38:24,632 --> 00:38:25,773
But then they'll go and do weird things,

1009
00:38:25,793 --> 00:38:28,754
like they'll have this Crit Happens pillow that you sit on,

1010
00:38:28,794 --> 00:38:31,795
like making like, oh, there's mixed messages there, right?

1011
00:38:31,835 --> 00:38:33,996
Sending like, oh, it's this bad thing we should avoid,

1012
00:38:34,276 --> 00:38:36,337
you know, but then we're seeing,

1013
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:39,158
and so that part of that is just distilling that culture

1014
00:38:39,198 --> 00:38:42,039
that this is a wonderful moment for us

1015
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,700
to be together and work together.

1016
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,760
It's about being a community

1017
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,101
and working toward a common goal.

1018
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:49,662
So getting the culture right is really helpful.

1019
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:53,985
And then also making it so that you teach people the process rather than just giving

1020
00:38:54,005 --> 00:38:54,346
it to them.

1021
00:38:54,906 --> 00:38:57,227
So you're not in a situation where the teachers need it.

1022
00:38:57,428 --> 00:39:01,210
In an ideal world, you want to be teaching these students so they can go off in small

1023
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,512
individual groups and do it themselves.

1024
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:05,633
And when I was a teacher, that's what I would always focus on doing.

1025
00:39:05,873 --> 00:39:09,476
And so I would give them these strategies, and I would never run critiques where it was

1026
00:39:09,576 --> 00:39:10,696
me and them.

1027
00:39:11,257 --> 00:39:12,138
I would never run critiques.

1028
00:39:12,158 --> 00:39:13,859
We're like, okay, I'm gonna teach you how to critique

1029
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:15,061
by showing you how to do it.

1030
00:39:15,081 --> 00:39:18,384
Because that's baloney, right?

1031
00:39:18,404 --> 00:39:19,465
That you just can't do, because that,

1032
00:39:19,905 --> 00:39:21,787
then you gotta learn by doing, right?

1033
00:39:21,807 --> 00:39:22,788
It's like virtual reality.

1034
00:39:22,808 --> 00:39:23,889
You gotta be in it to get it, right?

1035
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,433
So coming up with strategies of ways of,

1036
00:39:29,095 --> 00:39:30,997
this essay I wrote has a lot of these in it too.

1037
00:39:31,037 --> 00:39:31,857
I'll try to find a way to make.

1038
00:39:32,378 --> 00:39:39,061
Yeah, I'll try to find a way to get this out and and but but the one of the strategies was you know going around

1039
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:41,482
Is having everyone first describe?

1040
00:39:42,282 --> 00:39:48,305
Objective thing about what they saw you know it's red. It's plaster. It's you know it's big. It's five inches tall

1041
00:39:48,525 --> 00:39:50,706
It's that you know just something objective, so we start talking

1042
00:39:51,526 --> 00:39:52,967
No judgment, no deep thought.

1043
00:39:53,147 --> 00:39:54,747
We're just getting words to come out of our mouth.

1044
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:55,507
We're kind of getting warmed up.

1045
00:39:55,787 --> 00:39:58,908
And then doing some rounds where you start to now describe your experience.

1046
00:39:59,308 --> 00:40:00,769
Oh gosh, it feels like it's going to fall to me.

1047
00:40:01,189 --> 00:40:02,589
Oh, it makes me scared.

1048
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:03,209
Whatever.

1049
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:04,690
Now you describe your experience.

1050
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,930
It's just going around and just starting people...

1051
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:10,011
So you come up with a formula.

1052
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:11,272
First you do this, then you do this.

1053
00:40:11,472 --> 00:40:13,592
And now we go around and everyone starts to describe

1054
00:40:13,612 --> 00:40:16,753
a way in which they think it's not living up to its potential.

1055
00:40:16,773 --> 00:40:17,113
Or something.

1056
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:17,853
So there's a strategy.

1057
00:40:18,314 --> 00:40:20,776
and then say, okay guys, now you know steps one, two, three

1058
00:40:20,796 --> 00:40:22,879
of this process, now use a small group,

1059
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:23,900
go over and do it there,

1060
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,301
and use a small group to do it over there.

1061
00:40:25,321 --> 00:40:27,103
So, okay.

1062
00:40:28,215 --> 00:40:29,236
Is that 5 or is we're done.

1063
00:40:30,718 --> 00:40:31,879
And so.

1064
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,861
Was that somewhat helpful?

1065
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:35,002
Yeah, no, I was fine.

1066
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:36,863
I do some things already,

1067
00:40:36,883 --> 00:40:39,005
but like you've given me a lot of great ideas,

1068
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:39,966
which is so important.

1069
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:44,570
And I was wondering if I could maybe just grab 2 minutes with you after you can grab as many minutes with me as you'd like.

1070
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,112
I'll be in the wrap up room afterwards.

1071
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,894
I would love to talk with you more than anyone else that would like to have more talking.

1072
00:40:48,934 --> 00:40:50,095
Yeah, that would be wonderful so much.

1073
00:40:50,275 --> 00:40:50,476
Sure.

1074
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:51,757
Hi.

1075
00:40:53,198 --> 00:40:53,318
Hi.

1076
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:57,638
I'm a 3D artist that is on a team of predominantly 2D artists.

1077
00:40:58,338 --> 00:41:01,761
And trying to get really good constructive feedback can be rather difficult.

1078
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:07,125
I often find myself kind of talking about my process and going through what I'm doing and how I'm doing it.

1079
00:41:07,646 --> 00:41:12,069
I often don't find that feedback that I kind of need coming back my way.

1080
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,754
So I guess in terms of your experience, how would you facilitate that conversation when...

1081
00:41:18,992 --> 00:41:23,236
that there's that kind of disconnect between like what you're trying to, the problems you're trying to solve and like

1082
00:41:23,777 --> 00:41:30,443
people's experience like that process. That's rough. Yeah, I think just really thinking through the strategy of like framing the critique

1083
00:41:30,763 --> 00:41:34,787
and really kind of starting to think through like what are the experiences that you can try to frame?

1084
00:41:34,847 --> 00:41:39,591
You know, just asking people how they're experiencing something or what they have, but you can kind of

1085
00:41:40,312 --> 00:41:41,913
you find a way to kind of frame it.

1086
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,054
So you're not just putting it in front of them,

1087
00:41:43,074 --> 00:41:43,955
because they're going to be looking at it

1088
00:41:43,975 --> 00:41:44,656
from their point of view,

1089
00:41:44,676 --> 00:41:45,817
but you need to kind of get them to look at it

1090
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:46,958
from your point of view, right?

1091
00:41:47,259 --> 00:41:48,240
And so you can start to, you know,

1092
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,201
think of yourself as a teacher.

1093
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:51,042
Like, you're going to be a 3D design teacher.

1094
00:41:51,062 --> 00:41:52,324
What are the principles of 3D design

1095
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:53,004
that are important here?

1096
00:41:53,779 --> 00:41:56,841
and if they don't understand them, kind of helping them understand what they are

1097
00:41:57,121 --> 00:41:59,363
and then asking them if they're relevant to what's there.

1098
00:41:59,423 --> 00:42:02,685
But the underlying strategy there is trying to find some ways to kind of frame the critique.

1099
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:05,107
That's kind of what I would go about it, but you're in a rough position.

1100
00:42:05,127 --> 00:42:07,649
Yeah, I often do that, but I find that it's often one-sided.

1101
00:42:07,669 --> 00:42:09,770
And I feel like I'm kind of just leading the critique

1102
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:13,853
and it doesn't feel quite as back and forth as I would like.

1103
00:42:13,873 --> 00:42:16,795
Yeah, well, framing it is getting it going, but once it's framed well enough,

1104
00:42:16,855 --> 00:42:20,038
then hopefully they can start coming out.

1105
00:42:20,158 --> 00:42:21,519
But yeah, you're in a rough position with that.

1106
00:42:22,266 --> 00:42:25,529
Sorry, I may think of some other ideas.

1107
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,991
Well, I appreciate it.

1108
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:27,651
Thank you.

1109
00:42:27,691 --> 00:42:29,053
I'm a 3D artist, too, so I understand.

1110
00:42:29,073 --> 00:42:31,175
So if you're not thinking three-dimensionally

1111
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:32,116
and you don't have the ability, it's

1112
00:42:32,156 --> 00:42:34,638
hard to be in that mindset if you don't.

1113
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:37,661
But creating some mock-ups or creating some prototypes

1114
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:39,223
that get at the three-dimensionality

1115
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:41,605
and having them experience that might be helpful.

1116
00:42:41,745 --> 00:42:41,985
I don't know.

1117
00:42:42,005 --> 00:42:43,767
I'm just trying to throw some stuff out.

1118
00:42:43,807 --> 00:42:44,007
Awesome.

1119
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:44,448
Thank you.

1120
00:42:46,957 --> 00:42:48,598
I think this will be the last question.

1121
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:51,000
Hi, Aleem. I'm an effects artist.

1122
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:58,345
I was wondering on your insight or your thoughts in the process of cross-disciplinary critiquing

1123
00:42:58,965 --> 00:43:01,627
with, like, say, designers or programmers or whoever,

1124
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:04,629
in regards to assets that aren't quite done,

1125
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,952
I feel like in our industry we have a lot of, like,

1126
00:43:09,492 --> 00:43:12,754
to show an asset for critique is almost to take it to final.

1127
00:43:13,548 --> 00:43:16,149
uh... and what challenges that brings to the

1128
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,351
the emotional critiquing state

1129
00:43:18,871 --> 00:43:19,731
uh... and if you've ever

1130
00:43:20,492 --> 00:43:23,613
run into that or actually solve that in any way or have insight

1131
00:43:23,633 --> 00:43:26,215
yeah that's a really rough one too because you have people who aren't artists

1132
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:29,056
they're looking at what's there and when people are artists are looking beyond it

1133
00:43:29,076 --> 00:43:29,497
they know

1134
00:43:29,517 --> 00:43:31,137
okay this is an unfinished asset

1135
00:43:31,418 --> 00:43:34,059
i know where it's going i can imagine it being done but someone who's not an artist

1136
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:35,240
is gonna see what's there

1137
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,641
and i think that's where framing can be really helpful too

1138
00:43:37,961 --> 00:43:40,703
if you kind of maybe have an image along with it okay

1139
00:43:40,923 --> 00:43:42,484
here's what this will look like in the end

1140
00:43:43,524 --> 00:43:44,665
And here's what it looks like now.

1141
00:43:44,745 --> 00:43:46,847
And so we're not really looking for feedback

1142
00:43:46,907 --> 00:43:49,909
about the materials, because the materials will get to there.

1143
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:55,434
We're not looking for feedback about these specific aspects

1144
00:43:55,454 --> 00:43:56,675
of the effects, because they will get there.

1145
00:43:56,915 --> 00:43:59,277
But we are looking for feedback about x, y, and z.

1146
00:43:59,357 --> 00:44:01,438
So if you have some image that allows

1147
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:03,180
them to get in their mind what it will look like,

1148
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,641
that they can superimpose onto it,

1149
00:44:05,141 --> 00:44:06,542
then that might help to frame it.

1150
00:44:06,822 --> 00:44:07,623
Is that helpful?

1151
00:44:08,484 --> 00:44:08,864
OK, great.

1152
00:44:09,264 --> 00:44:10,265
Thank you all so much.

1153
00:44:10,325 --> 00:44:12,247
I'll be here for a few minutes, and then over there.

1154
00:44:12,267 --> 00:44:12,747
Thank you.
