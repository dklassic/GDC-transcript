1
00:00:03,619 --> 00:00:06,421
Okay everybody, looks like we're ready to get started.

2
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:09,603
And thank you, nice to see I got a full house here.

3
00:00:10,584 --> 00:00:13,526
I don't see, I see a few of you standing up

4
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:15,968
and actually usually there are empty spaces

5
00:00:16,028 --> 00:00:18,970
but I think we've got everything full.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,193
So welcome, this is Game Designer's View

7
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:23,714
of Neuroscience VR.

8
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:24,234
And I will...

9
00:00:28,357 --> 00:00:35,901
I'm going to be talking about quite a range here, but I want to start out with a disclaimer right at the beginning that I am a game designer.

10
00:00:35,982 --> 00:00:44,226
I've actually been making games professionally since 1980, so a long time in this field.

11
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:49,007
been interested in science, as a lot of game designers are all that time.

12
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:52,928
And I was working for big companies.

13
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:57,269
I was one of the first employees at places like LucasArts and DreamWorks Interactive.

14
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:01,170
But then from 96 or so up until

15
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,731
about four years ago, I was a freelance designer and producer.

16
00:01:05,411 --> 00:01:09,192
And as I did that freelance work, I got more and more interested in what was

17
00:01:09,272 --> 00:01:11,032
for a while called serious games.

18
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:19,239
specifically working with games on the medical side and games that either work as treatment

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,384
or therapy for medical conditions or games that are designed to train doctors and caregivers

20
00:01:24,464 --> 00:01:26,987
and that was an area that got really interesting to me.

21
00:01:27,507 --> 00:01:32,011
Then four years ago, I got an offer to come to Google and work as their chief game designer

22
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:37,175
and couldn't pass that up and spent the last four years doing that, but wasn't able to

23
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:41,958
really work on the kinds of projects that get out in people's hands.

24
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:45,541
And meanwhile, I felt that neuroscience in particular

25
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:50,344
was making wonderful strides and coming together with games and I just wanted to be part of

26
00:01:50,384 --> 00:01:52,905
that again so I've dived back into that end of it.

27
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:55,086
And I'm hoping to inspire some of you.

28
00:01:55,807 --> 00:02:02,070
Just out of curiosity, how many people here have already worked with medical neuroscience

29
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:05,112
projects on your side of things?

30
00:02:05,932 --> 00:02:06,473
Not too many.

31
00:02:06,513 --> 00:02:08,454
How many of you are professional game developers?

32
00:02:09,593 --> 00:02:14,556
Okay, so about the ratio I expected mostly on the game side and obviously a lot of hands.

33
00:02:14,616 --> 00:02:20,019
It didn't go up of all the different niches of technology and video and media and everything

34
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:21,199
that we've got going on here.

35
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,540
So anyway.

36
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,583
I will be speaking about this from a game designer's point of view and I think I'm reasonably

37
00:02:28,623 --> 00:02:34,408
well informed but any of you that are actual neuroscientists can talk rings around me so

38
00:02:34,808 --> 00:02:40,433
my apologies on that level if I don't have everything together for you.

39
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:45,037
But I'll be talking today about why I think neuroscience matters, why it's such an exciting

40
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:45,938
field at the time.

41
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,984
I'll be going into three areas specifically, motion in VR and how you move through spaces

42
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:54,025
with VR and how that relates to neuroscience.

43
00:02:54,686 --> 00:02:59,070
The whole thing about immersion and presence, and I'm not going to dive too deeply into

44
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,012
any one of these just for time issues.

45
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:07,757
But a lot of people bandy about words like, you know, VR gives you a sense of immersion

46
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:12,419
and presence without ever really talking about what does that mean and why does it give us

47
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:13,499
that kind of immersion.

48
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:19,061
And finally, and the area that I'm most interested in is what does this mean for emotions and

49
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:24,863
feelings that are able to be evoked by VR and how is that actually affecting our brains

50
00:03:24,923 --> 00:03:25,643
and what can we do?

51
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:28,545
as developers to learn and take advantage.

52
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:32,408
Then the final thing will be to sort of wrap that up to talk a little bit about some of

53
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:38,713
the future, both of some entertainment possibilities and also these health applications that I

54
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:40,754
think are really interesting crossover.

55
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:45,478
So in this process I'm going to try to

56
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,704
you know, give you a sense of what I know is really a fact, what is being inferred from

57
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:57,988
facts and what is pure speculation. I may not always get that right, so when we go to

58
00:03:58,028 --> 00:04:02,692
the Q&A, please feel free to ask, you know, when you said X, did you really mean that

59
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:08,037
this has been proven and tested or is that just your wild ass speculation? And sadly,

60
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:11,320
in some cases, it will be the third, but hopefully that will be inspiring too.

61
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:18,430
My view of all this, in fact, having a long history in the games industry, I think is

62
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,911
relevant for a number of reasons.

63
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:22,512
I've seen new technologies come and go.

64
00:04:22,572 --> 00:04:24,273
I've seen new evolutions.

65
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:28,495
The first games that I played on a computer were text-based.

66
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:33,117
In fact, the very first ones were paper-based before there were even video screens.

67
00:04:33,677 --> 00:04:35,418
And I've seen the evolution first

68
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:40,803
to video screens where we used them to display more text but you didn't have to actually

69
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:46,348
worry about whether you were running out of ink, to of course graphics and animation and

70
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:52,933
then we had revolutions like CD-ROM and suddenly a hundredfold increase in storage, then things

71
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:57,917
like video and being able to have full, what we called full motion video, the idea that

72
00:04:57,957 --> 00:05:00,480
you could actually do, you know, amazing, you know, about

73
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,663
five frame a second video clips that looked absolutely terrible.

74
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:09,726
But all the different things we've gone through to get to the latest revolutions in virtual

75
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:13,789
reality, which are both new and actually very old as I'll get into.

76
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,533
But an analogy that I found useful that I like to look at is that each time you get

77
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:22,316
one of these new technologies, it's like you're going through a mountain pass and there's

78
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:23,377
a sense of excitement.

79
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:24,437
Is this going to open out?

80
00:05:24,838 --> 00:05:27,880
Is it going to be just a little cul-de-sac and you're going to have to backtrack?

81
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,921
There's going to be a whole new continent.

82
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:35,191
And you really don't know until you get out there and you start experimenting with it.

83
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:37,635
One of the things that everyone is nervous about...

84
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:43,355
is that both of those might be right and that you're going out there and you end up getting

85
00:05:43,455 --> 00:05:48,057
stuck on this little precipice with no way to get into this huge area that you see opening

86
00:05:48,157 --> 00:05:52,360
up and all of your competitors are out there and they said, oh yeah, we figured out exactly

87
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,461
how to use VR and monetize it and we're making lots of money.

88
00:05:55,481 --> 00:06:00,284
I don't think anybody's quite at that point yet, but all of us are waiting to see who's

89
00:06:00,304 --> 00:06:03,446
going to find their way down to these open valleys potentially.

90
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:05,908
entire new continents to explore.

91
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:13,297
And I really think, personally I'm a strong believer, I think VR, AR, mixed reality, whatever

92
00:06:13,337 --> 00:06:17,983
you want to call it, all of these things are already really exciting and are going to get

93
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:22,308
much bigger in the near future and I'll hopefully be able to tell you some of the reasons why.

94
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:25,870
But along that way, it is easy to get stuck.

95
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:29,172
And part of why I think getting down to science,

96
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:31,754
I think neuroscience is critical with VR,

97
00:06:32,274 --> 00:06:35,036
I've often used evolution and an understanding

98
00:06:35,176 --> 00:06:38,598
of what we as humans are evolved to perceive

99
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:41,600
and to appreciate to guide me

100
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,081
into new forms of entertainment.

101
00:06:43,181 --> 00:06:45,143
Because I think if you get down to the fundamentals,

102
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:50,085
of who we are as human beings and what makes us excited, what makes us engaged.

103
00:06:50,505 --> 00:06:53,747
That's the basis of entertainment, it's the basis of learning,

104
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:57,448
it's the basis of a lot of what these technologies are intended to do.

105
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:03,526
So hopefully neuroscience can help us find this right path and get down from these little

106
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:06,887
precipice and out into the rich farmlands below.

107
00:07:07,487 --> 00:07:09,348
It's in some ways kind of like a compass.

108
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:13,609
It doesn't always tell us exactly how to get somewhere, but it can point the right direction,

109
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:15,470
give you some tantalizing hints.

110
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:21,572
And I'm not going to be giving you a lot of turnkey solutions to things, but in some cases

111
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:27,294
hopefully I will be intriguing you with areas that you can look into on your own more.

112
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:32,175
and get into a little bit more depth because there's a very wide range of things to cover

113
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:37,176
so I don't have the time to get into a lot of depth for any one thing.

114
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:44,638
Just to give you a sense though, I'm not going to spend too much time on this particular

115
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:50,139
aspect of it, but I would like to give you a sort of historical sense of where VR fits

116
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:54,480
in this sort of larger scale of human evolution and technology.

117
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:55,900
So...

118
00:07:56,962 --> 00:08:02,487
I love this cave painting. This is a cave painting from, I believe, around 20,000 years ago, but

119
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:06,231
there are cave paintings going back as far as 40,000 years, and of course,

120
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:09,114
as people explore, they may find even older ones.

121
00:08:09,514 --> 00:08:13,938
I find it amazing that this is a 20,000 year old piece of art, and

122
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:20,402
try as I might, I couldn't draw anything with the best tools that was even close to as realistic

123
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:26,826
a bison as that is. It's hard to see in this particular flat picture here, but the artist

124
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:33,490
who was clearly doing this by torchlight with pigments that had been made Lord knows how,

125
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,411
actually used some of the contours of the rock.

126
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:41,457
to evoke almost a 3D sense of this bison.

127
00:08:41,597 --> 00:08:44,240
At one point, I knew the actual name of it.

128
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,625
It's an extinct relative of the aurochs,

129
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:51,008
I think, that were roaming Europe at the time

130
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:52,550
that this was made.

131
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:56,714
So it's amazing that for at least 40,000 years,

132
00:08:57,155 --> 00:09:00,758
our ancestors have been struggling with this problem of,

133
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:04,042
I saw something and I want to describe it to you.

134
00:09:04,102 --> 00:09:06,604
In fact, no, I want you to be able to see what I saw.

135
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:08,886
And maybe it's not even that I saw something,

136
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:11,809
but I had a vision, I had something I imagined,

137
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,992
something that came to me while I was sleeping.

138
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:15,874
I would like to share that with you.

139
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:22,421
And we've had this quest now for tens of thousands of years of how to improve our technology to do that.

140
00:09:22,821 --> 00:09:36,271
Some of the stuff going back thousands of years, the camera obscura, the Romans were into this, of using a sort of pinhole camera to be able to get this beautiful view of essentially a live action camera of what was going on around you.

141
00:09:37,032 --> 00:09:44,257
In the Middle Ages, they really started to get into shadow plays and projecting a light onto a wall.

142
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:48,380
and using your hands to make shadows and do animation.

143
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,043
There's been an interest in doing that for a long time.

144
00:09:52,904 --> 00:09:57,947
In fact, the next couple of slides I'm going to show you are the pictures that I took at

145
00:09:57,967 --> 00:10:02,631
a museum in Girona, Spain, near Barcelona, Museum of Cinema.

146
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:05,873
I'm curious, has anyone been to the Museum of Cinema in Girona?

147
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:07,615
Just one or two hands.

148
00:10:07,655 --> 00:10:07,875
I would...

149
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:09,317
Highly recommend it.

150
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:11,359
There are game conferences in Barcelona,

151
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:13,742
which is how I got out there, if you have a reason to get out there.

152
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:17,086
It was great because I thought it was going to be just about movie making,

153
00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:20,851
but they got into all this information about the predecessors,

154
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,575
including things like the magic lantern that you see here.

155
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:31,492
that was from roughly 200 to 100 years ago where they would start with originally a very

156
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:34,095
bright flame and then they used electric lights.

157
00:10:34,436 --> 00:10:38,902
It was essentially some of the first slide projectors, but it was a way to show images

158
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:40,504
and project them against the wall.

159
00:10:41,803 --> 00:10:48,985
And like many other technologies, it was first something that you would, you know, it was expensive and difficult to do, so you would come to a public performance,

160
00:10:49,385 --> 00:10:54,266
and then wealthy people were able to afford these very beautifully made versions of it at home,

161
00:10:54,626 --> 00:11:00,548
and then they started to make less expensive, maybe less fancy, but more accessible versions for the home.

162
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:03,809
It was a huge thing around the late 1800s.

163
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:07,549
And moved on, of course, to the...

164
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:13,336
early film cameras. Same kind of evolution of stuff where you'd have to go to the theater,

165
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:18,260
and then wealthy people were able to afford their own cameras. Eventually, it became something where

166
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:24,265
people could afford them. Of course, now we carry around a whole film studio in our pocket.

167
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:31,771
I love the scene in the Back to the Future movie where he comes in with his 1985 camera,

168
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:36,495
and Doc Brown is amazed that he's got this whole television studio on his shoulder.

169
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:41,418
Now, we have something much more sophisticated that we stick in our pocket and give it another

170
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:47,003
30 years and it will be either on our glasses or possibly embedded in our skulls at that

171
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,424
point.

172
00:11:48,464 --> 00:11:53,468
That kind of process of always wanting to have better ways of showing a higher resolution,

173
00:11:53,868 --> 00:11:58,572
more realistic images, and make it more accessible so that we can have it every day has been

174
00:11:58,912 --> 00:12:00,233
going on for a long time.

175
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:03,821
Going into the 20th century, same kind of thing.

176
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:07,242
VR started to get involved earlier than a lot of people have seen.

177
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:11,464
There have been wonderful talks at other VR conferences about some of the early stuff

178
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:14,426
from going back to the 1950s and even earlier.

179
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:21,029
I love this sensorama thing, just really trying to engage all the different senses.

180
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:25,171
The military with heads-up displays has been working on this for quite a while.

181
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:34,494
I saw my first virtual reality demo in the mid-80s, I think around 1985, when Jaron Lanier,

182
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:39,615
who actually was popularizing the term virtual reality, came to give us a demo when I was

183
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:40,995
working at LucasArts.

184
00:12:41,015 --> 00:12:42,976
It was actually Lucasfilm Games at the time.

185
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:47,457
He had a company called VPL, which stood for Visual Programming Language.

186
00:12:47,597 --> 00:12:53,018
He was really excited because they had invented this visual language where you could use images

187
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:53,678
to program.

188
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,907
And almost as an afterthought, he had created something called the data glove that you could

189
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:03,815
put on and had sensors and you could manipulate the images on the screen by gesturing with

190
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:04,376
your hand.

191
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:06,940
And one of the things that kept happening is that he would

192
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:10,269
be showing us the screen and moving stuff.

193
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,952
And he was so excited about this visual programming language.

194
00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:16,434
And we were all focused on the glove and this idea

195
00:13:16,474 --> 00:13:18,436
that you're reaching into the screen

196
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:20,097
and you can actually kind of engage

197
00:13:20,157 --> 00:13:24,081
with what was then even at that point being called cyberspace.

198
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:27,023
And in fact, David Fox, who just walked in here,

199
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:28,365
was at that very same demo.

200
00:13:29,946 --> 00:13:35,670
But these were early stages, like a lot of things, it was promised to be this wonderful

201
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,572
new thing that was going to be around the corner in just a few years and took a lot

202
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:41,393
longer than people thought.

203
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:47,217
The Virtual Boy that Nintendo did was yet another precipice out there that was really

204
00:13:47,237 --> 00:13:51,880
an interesting experiment, but it was just not good enough and way too cumbersome to

205
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,242
be mass-market in the way that it could be successful.

206
00:13:56,815 --> 00:14:03,702
But a lot of what we can do, I think, is a common thread in all of these things is what's

207
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:08,407
going on with our eyes, with our brains, how do we perceive these things?

208
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:10,289
What is it about these images?

209
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:15,855
Going back to those earliest cave paintings, there are still things, we think of that as

210
00:14:16,215 --> 00:14:17,297
a picture of a bison.

211
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:23,861
Ultimately, what you're seeing are photons from an image that's projected from my computer

212
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:28,424
of a picture that was taken of a painting that was done of this bison.

213
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:34,088
There are so many levels between the reality of what that person saw 20,000 years ago and

214
00:14:34,148 --> 00:14:35,349
what you just saw now.

215
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:36,069
And yet, coming

216
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,312
I'm getting chills just thinking about this.

217
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:41,613
That wasn't just a thought that they had.

218
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:47,037
That was a real animal that was alive 20,000 years ago that through this long chain of

219
00:14:47,117 --> 00:14:51,440
technology and humanity has been brought to the present.

220
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,923
You are perceiving it in your brain in many ways through a whole bunch of tricks to trick

221
00:14:56,943 --> 00:15:00,986
your eye into thinking that that image you see, those photons, are like the real photons

222
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:03,208
you get off of that animal itself.

223
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:07,736
So if we can understand how our eyes and brains work,

224
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:10,158
we can also understand all the shortcuts

225
00:15:10,398 --> 00:15:11,699
that our nervous system does,

226
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,341
because it can't afford to take in everything

227
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:17,023
that's around us and process it all at once.

228
00:15:17,443 --> 00:15:19,205
We're dealing with this now when we've got,

229
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:21,106
you know, the phones in particular.

230
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,870
are just going flat out trying to do a great 3D display,

231
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,452
much less being able to scan the world around them.

232
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:30,355
We're just at the edges of them being able to start

233
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,857
to do that a little bit, so we have to get selective.

234
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:35,559
And understanding what's going on inside people's

235
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,343
visual systems, their brains, their vestibular systems

236
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:42,185
and balance is really helpful because we don't need

237
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:43,687
to give all that information.

238
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,269
We can give just the pieces that are necessary.

239
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,181
So the first of these areas that I'm going to get into is motion.

240
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:56,542
And one of the first things that comes up with VR, of course,

241
00:15:56,782 --> 00:15:59,063
is that idea of potential motion sickness.

242
00:15:59,903 --> 00:16:02,723
This is something that's been around for quite a while as well.

243
00:16:02,803 --> 00:16:05,844
I've got the picture of the boat in a storm out there because, of course,

244
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:08,625
there's a connection to seasickness, car sickness.

245
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:12,166
And again, thinking of it from an evolutionary point of view,

246
00:16:13,086 --> 00:16:17,172
If you are moving around in a world and you see things in that world,

247
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:23,060
there's a one-to-one correspondence with how your head is moving and what your eyes are seeing.

248
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,362
And over history...

249
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:36,607
If there was a problem, if there was a mismatch, let's sort of get into the vestibular system that's able to sense how your head is moving and therefore keep a sense of your orientation.

250
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:43,534
If there was a mismatch between what the semicircular canals in your inner ear.

251
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:47,879
we're sensing that, you know, it's really interesting that I'm sure many of you have

252
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:55,667
seen this, but there are those three semicircular canals that are oriented like the three mutually

253
00:16:55,727 --> 00:17:01,994
perpendicular areas of pitch, yaw, and roll so that they can sense within your head as

254
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:04,076
you move your head, rotate it in any direction.

255
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:12,152
If that was not matching up with what you saw for millennia, for millions of years really,

256
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:18,676
that usually meant that you had maybe eaten a poison mushroom or maybe that leftover haunch

257
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:23,159
from the kill from a week ago had kind of turned a little green and you were hungry

258
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:24,000
and you ate it anyway.

259
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,923
And poison in your system sometimes interfered with what you saw compared to what you were

260
00:17:29,943 --> 00:17:30,744
actually sensing.

261
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:35,046
And the best response to realizing you were poisoned

262
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:37,847
was to try and purge your system of those poisons,

263
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:41,869
which is why we get nauseous when we have things like motion sickness,

264
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:45,910
from whether it's sea sickness, car sickness, or now VR sickness.

265
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,791
So, it's useful understanding that.

266
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:50,812
It doesn't do much for the people that actually experience it,

267
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:53,933
but we have learned quite a bit of how to minimize those things.

268
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,535
And sadly, just as with sea sickness, car sickness,

269
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:59,675
there are some people that are really sensitive

270
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:04,357
and can never read a book and be in a car, for example.

271
00:18:05,215 --> 00:18:07,656
I think we're always, and this is just my conjecture here,

272
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:10,057
but I think we're always going to have some people

273
00:18:10,117 --> 00:18:13,238
at one end of that spectrum who just have trouble with that

274
00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:15,198
and are gonna have trouble with a lot of VR

275
00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:17,119
if they move too swiftly.

276
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:19,440
But there are things that we can do to help.

277
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,021
I'm gonna talk about how the brain tries to match

278
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:26,802
the motion of your head with the visual system.

279
00:18:27,202 --> 00:18:29,203
I'll get into some more of the details of that later.

280
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,864
But the bottom line is that if there's a mismatch,

281
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:33,044
there's a problem.

282
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:39,164
And unfortunately, there are dozens, if not thousands, of ways that there can be mismatches,

283
00:18:39,224 --> 00:18:40,366
so we're working on that.

284
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:44,194
And you don't want that sense that you're being poisoned.

285
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:47,668
Those of you working in developing VR,

286
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,350
something that's happened universally

287
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,731
with every team I've talked to is pretty quickly

288
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,772
everyone finds the one person on their team

289
00:18:54,812 --> 00:18:57,113
that is most sensitive to VR motion sickness

290
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:59,615
and that poor person becomes the guinea pig

291
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:00,855
for all of the new demos.

292
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,237
And it's a really simple system.

293
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:05,378
I frankly don't think we're gonna have a better system

294
00:19:05,398 --> 00:19:06,979
than that for a long time to come.

295
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:08,660
So those of you that are,

296
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,941
anybody here who is that person on your team?

297
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:12,642
Oh yeah, I see some,

298
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:19,447
poor, poor schlubs there that are doing that and happily are committed enough to keep coming

299
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:25,052
here so more power to you. And hopefully there will be some reason for hope as we can figure

300
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:28,916
out ways to minimize that. But this will be an issue that we're going to have to deal

301
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:33,200
with as we move forward. So how can we minimize it?

302
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:38,879
Turns out obviously one of the biggest mismatches, I say obviously but we only found this out

303
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:43,583
empirically through trying stuff, is that having a really high frame rate is critically

304
00:19:43,643 --> 00:19:44,143
important.

305
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:47,426
90 frames a second is being held out.

306
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,748
It turns out that

307
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:59,697
You can certainly get up to 120 frames a second before it starts to get to the point where I don't think there's a whole lot of necessity to go much faster than that.

308
00:20:00,618 --> 00:20:10,826
The ability of us to perceive stuff happening faster than 120 frames a second is, it is there, but now we're getting down to a pretty tiny percentage of the population.

309
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:17,574
And yet, this is really an interesting point because frame rate, of course, is governed

310
00:20:17,654 --> 00:20:20,177
heavily by how much you're doing in each frame.

311
00:20:20,237 --> 00:20:24,682
The more processing you do, the harder it is to keep up, you know, the faster a processor

312
00:20:24,702 --> 00:20:25,783
you need to be able to do that.

313
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,587
And so almost everything else that we have in VR...

314
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,188
is fighting against that frame rate problem.

315
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:32,988
There's this constant temptation to say,

316
00:20:33,028 --> 00:20:35,308
well, we can make the visual field bigger,

317
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:36,829
we can come into higher resolution,

318
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,149
we could do better quality graphics,

319
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:41,070
we could just live with a little bit

320
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,270
of a less of a frame rate.

321
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,550
And sometimes that's actually a reasonable trade off.

322
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,771
If you're not moving people through that space,

323
00:20:48,091 --> 00:20:50,752
you can get away with a little bit slower frame rate.

324
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:53,552
But in general, that's gonna be a critical thing.

325
00:20:54,372 --> 00:21:01,915
and closely coupled with that, is sensing where your head is and what your vision is looking at at any given time.

326
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:11,540
It's been thrown around many times that 20 milliseconds motion to photon is kind of the minimum that you want,

327
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,920
or rather the maximum that you want.

328
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,701
If it's faster than that, it's even better.

329
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:20,183
And what that would mean is that you need less than 20 milliseconds between the time you're turning your head

330
00:21:20,644 --> 00:21:23,566
and the time you're actually seeing the visual system respond.

331
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:25,968
20 milliseconds is actually pushing it.

332
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:29,931
That's the area where it's comfortable for a lot of people, but not everyone.

333
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:34,034
It's really hard, again, to get much faster than that, particularly with the kinds of

334
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:37,016
systems that we have that were not designed for this in the first place.

335
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:42,781
Meaning that the kind of visuals we have on our phones and TVs and everything were not

336
00:21:42,841 --> 00:21:44,562
originally set up for VR.

337
00:21:44,602 --> 00:21:50,026
They were set up for watching a screen passively and not having a screen that's moving.

338
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:54,888
So getting all those visual cues right is really difficult.

339
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:57,610
You don't need to get every single visual cue right, of course,

340
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,732
and I'll talk a little bit about some of the shortcuts.

341
00:22:00,293 --> 00:22:01,674
How am I doing on time?

342
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,415
Yeah, I won't have much time for that.

343
00:22:03,995 --> 00:22:06,477
Minimizing acceleration has been really critical

344
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:08,359
because of course your inner ear,

345
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,945
tells acceleration if you're moving at a constant speed, it has trouble telling that.

346
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:20,652
Pilots in planes go through a process where they're shown that if they are very gradually

347
00:22:20,712 --> 00:22:24,957
moved into different planes, they actually don't sense it and they can even be hanging

348
00:22:24,997 --> 00:22:30,263
upside down and not realize it if they don't have the visual cues to help them understand

349
00:22:30,323 --> 00:22:30,443
that.

350
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:33,276
But there are some creative solutions.

351
00:22:33,316 --> 00:22:38,419
I'll talk about one particular one that I think is a great example of using understanding

352
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:43,822
of the brain to help use some shortcuts so that we don't have to do quite as much processing

353
00:22:44,142 --> 00:22:46,083
and we can make it more comfortable for a lot of people.

354
00:22:47,172 --> 00:22:51,713
So some of the stuff that we found, having a constant speed certainly helps.

355
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:58,515
It's interesting, Chris Pruitt, who was just in here earlier in the room, gave a talk a

356
00:22:58,555 --> 00:23:02,876
couple of years ago where he talked about how we've had, as game developers, to unlearn

357
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:03,456
certain things.

358
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:09,697
That smooth acceleration into a certain speed and deceleration was the gold standard for

359
00:23:09,737 --> 00:23:10,437
a long time.

360
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:12,899
And then we hit VR and it turns out that no,

361
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:15,640
going from a dead stop to a constant speed

362
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,862
and back to a dead stop is much better

363
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:20,103
because nobody really does that in real life.

364
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:21,944
So it doesn't set off that sense

365
00:23:21,964 --> 00:23:23,545
that there's something wrong in your brain

366
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:24,826
that, wait a minute, something's weird.

367
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:26,126
Because of course it's weird,

368
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:29,168
just like the other solution of teleportation.

369
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,573
We aren't used to what teleporting is like.

370
00:23:33,154 --> 00:23:35,296
If an alien race that can teleport showed up,

371
00:23:35,636 --> 00:23:38,340
came in and saw our VR, they might be horrified

372
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,262
because we get teleportation all wrong

373
00:23:40,282 --> 00:23:41,624
and it doesn't feel that way.

374
00:23:41,944 --> 00:23:43,866
But luckily, we're not one of those aliens

375
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:44,787
so we're okay there.

376
00:23:45,428 --> 00:23:50,731
But those are things that work. The other thing that I mentioned is curves. This is from a game that we did at Google

377
00:23:51,511 --> 00:23:55,113
called Zushi. And yes, Google actually does make some games internally.

378
00:23:55,513 --> 00:24:01,916
This was a game, a VR game, where you're on a raft moving down a stream. And we did that on purpose because

379
00:24:02,296 --> 00:24:05,718
it's slow and it lets you see where you're about to turn and curve.

380
00:24:06,018 --> 00:24:09,400
And it did have acceleration as you move around those curves. You're getting, you know,

381
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,901
acceleration around the curve, but we found for most people, as long as the speed was

382
00:24:13,981 --> 00:24:17,843
slow and they could see where they were going and anticipate that they'd have that curve,

383
00:24:18,163 --> 00:24:19,063
it wasn't so bad.

384
00:24:19,463 --> 00:24:23,564
Much like somebody in a car, if you're driving, you're much less likely to get car sick than

385
00:24:23,584 --> 00:24:26,705
if you're a passenger and if you're looking at a book or something and you're not seeing

386
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:27,565
the world around you.

387
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,907
Or with seasickness, if you're down in the hold and you're not able to see the horizon,

388
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:34,848
you don't get the right visual cues.

389
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:39,229
The cues are that nothing is moving and yet your inner ear is telling you you are moving.

390
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,124
So matching those things up really can help.

391
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:48,012
Now, back in the movie industry, I'm sure most of you are familiar with this little bit,

392
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:55,416
I have very strong memories of being in a theater in 1977 and seeing that first Star Wars movie.

393
00:24:55,716 --> 00:24:59,758
In this moment where it zooms down and bounces up, you can hear the audience go,

394
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:02,980
whoa, because there's enough of a sense with this huge screen

395
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,022
that you're actually kind of on a roller coaster ride.

396
00:25:06,522 --> 00:25:10,744
They did it again in the Battle of Hoth in Empire Strikes Back where there's a

397
00:25:11,104 --> 00:25:14,005
a quick moment where the snow speeders do a similar kind of maneuver.

398
00:25:14,565 --> 00:25:18,046
But in general, people don't get movie sick.

399
00:25:18,086 --> 00:25:24,587
There are some people, actually, shaky cams and having that move around can really disturb some people.

400
00:25:24,927 --> 00:25:26,648
But a lot of this doesn't bother people.

401
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:29,588
And it's a really interesting clue.

402
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:33,729
When you see, well, why is it that we haven't had so much of a problem with films?

403
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:36,530
And you look for the cases where it is a problem.

404
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,130
So one of the areas where it does come to be a problem

405
00:25:39,631 --> 00:25:42,985
is in IMAX films, suddenly people get motion sickness again.

406
00:25:43,864 --> 00:25:48,405
The interesting thing there is understanding about the way your visual system works.

407
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:55,107
You've got what's called the foveal area that is about two degrees left and right, up and

408
00:25:55,147 --> 00:25:56,487
down, the very center.

409
00:25:56,547 --> 00:26:01,668
So when you're looking at something, you're focusing, your eyes are focusing the image

410
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:06,229
on a particular part of your retina that essentially is for high-resolution viewing.

411
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:10,790
The rest of your retina has a lot of rods and cones that can pick up visual images,

412
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,371
but that's what we call our peripheral vision.

413
00:26:14,092 --> 00:26:18,479
And even though our brain tricks us into thinking it's a nice continuum, it's not.

414
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,443
Those two areas work quite differently.

415
00:26:21,084 --> 00:26:25,732
And if you can take advantage of that, you can actually shortcut a lot of these things

416
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,035
and can be very helpful.

417
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:34,812
So what happens is in an IMAX film or other cases where you sit really close to a screen,

418
00:26:35,112 --> 00:26:39,296
your peripheral vision actually sees all of this motion and it's starting, you know, it

419
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:43,980
turns out that your peripheral vision is connected to a lot of your systems that give you a sense

420
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,861
of orientation.

421
00:26:45,681 --> 00:26:50,305
Partly because if you are focused on, for example, you're stalking an antelope.

422
00:26:51,114 --> 00:26:55,876
You may have your foveal vision aimed right at that antelope, but as you're moving along,

423
00:26:56,336 --> 00:27:00,658
your peripheral vision is telling you the way your body is moving and matching that

424
00:27:00,718 --> 00:27:02,599
up with what your inner ear is saying.

425
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:08,341
So if you have motion in your peripheral vision, your brain is processing that.

426
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:15,024
So one of the things that has come up is if you can, you know, there's some really interesting

427
00:27:15,084 --> 00:27:20,206
experiments of processing an image that you see only in the foveal area that you're looking

428
00:27:20,326 --> 00:27:25,928
at and having the peripheral vision, you know, not being as high resolution, not requiring

429
00:27:25,968 --> 00:27:27,169
as much processing power.

430
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:31,031
It's necessary to have eye tracking and I'll talk about that in a bit.

431
00:27:31,971 --> 00:27:36,176
But one of the shortcuts that people have found is that if you blur or even black out

432
00:27:36,957 --> 00:27:41,943
your peripheral vision and still move the foveal vision, you get an interesting effect.

433
00:27:42,783 --> 00:27:48,350
This is why something like Star Wars was okay, but IMAX can be a problem to people.

434
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,353
What this is called is tunneling locomotion.

435
00:27:51,874 --> 00:27:55,935
Actually, coincidentally, at this very moment, there are some Google Earth people in one

436
00:27:55,955 --> 00:27:59,337
of the other talks, and you're going to get at least a little sense of Google Earth.

437
00:27:59,777 --> 00:28:02,878
This is a brief clip of tunneling in Google Earth.

438
00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:09,481
What they do is, in order to move you, they bring in this grid into your peripheral vision.

439
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,984
and you still see a moving image in the center,

440
00:28:13,004 --> 00:28:14,986
and you're going to have to take my word for it

441
00:28:15,006 --> 00:28:18,029
because you really need to be in VR to get that full sense of this.

442
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:21,072
But oddly enough, even though this looks really strange,

443
00:28:21,292 --> 00:28:23,434
in VR it actually feels quite comfortable.

444
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:25,977
If you're looking, for one thing,

445
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:28,620
as the rest of the peripheral vision goes away,

446
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,445
you naturally are drawn to look directly at the area in your foveal view there that's

447
00:28:34,485 --> 00:28:35,967
directly ahead of you on the screen.

448
00:28:36,547 --> 00:28:40,491
And it turns out that this eliminates a lot of the kind of motion sickness people get

449
00:28:40,571 --> 00:28:45,015
from that acceleration and deceleration, because that is apparently being picked up by your

450
00:28:45,035 --> 00:28:48,919
peripheral vision, and when it's not there to disconcert your peripheral vision, it's

451
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:52,662
okay, and you can still keep people oriented with the motion that they're going through.

452
00:28:53,282 --> 00:28:55,784
Here's a game that I have to say I haven't played.

453
00:28:55,804 --> 00:28:59,686
I just found this online called Sub Level Zero that does a similar thing.

454
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:06,390
There are other VR demos and games out there that use this tunneling locomotion.

455
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:10,453
I bring it up not to say that everybody needs to do this, but just to point out that it's

456
00:29:10,473 --> 00:29:14,996
a really interesting, clever way that not only deals with the problem of

457
00:29:15,956 --> 00:29:17,838
motion sickness and VR sickness here,

458
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:20,681
but it also means you don't have to process all that stuff.

459
00:29:20,721 --> 00:29:22,603
You're just graying it out and that gives you

460
00:29:22,623 --> 00:29:25,586
a lot more cycles to work on the area

461
00:29:25,626 --> 00:29:27,288
that you're showing in the center of the screen,

462
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:28,309
which can be very handy.

463
00:29:28,629 --> 00:29:30,311
You can keep up a very high frame rate

464
00:29:30,371 --> 00:29:31,553
in the areas that you do show.

465
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,122
This is likely to be coming to mobile in the future.

466
00:29:36,703 --> 00:29:39,785
And where eye tracking, as I said, is really interesting.

467
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:43,188
Right now, the foveal view is done by sort of brute forcing,

468
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:46,130
saying the only thing to look at is this one thing right in front of you.

469
00:29:46,731 --> 00:29:50,774
But wouldn't it be great if we could get to the point where wherever you happen to look,

470
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:55,738
that's the only area we render in high resolution, and the rest of it we don't have to bother.

471
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:59,561
And, in fact, with eye tracking rigs that are out there, there will probably be demos.

472
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:01,903
I haven't had a chance to see what's being demoed here.

473
00:30:02,325 --> 00:30:04,946
today, but I've seen it at a lot of other VR conferences.

474
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:11,046
There are eye trackers that providentially you need to be really close to somebody's

475
00:30:11,266 --> 00:30:16,848
eye and of course with VR headsets and AR headsets for that matter, we now have a reason

476
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:20,989
to mount a camera that can look at somebody's eye and see the motions of their pupil.

477
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:25,931
It's not perfect yet, but it works really well already and as these things become more

478
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:30,512
commercially available, I'm expecting that it's going to become built into all systems,

479
00:30:31,152 --> 00:30:32,773
certainly on head-mounted VR.

480
00:30:33,752 --> 00:30:38,541
But even on your phone, there's some interesting stuff going on in the announcements about...

481
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,900
the new iPhones and facial recognition.

482
00:30:42,721 --> 00:30:47,585
I've read some interesting stuff about using those forward-facing cameras to actually track

483
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:48,766
people's eyes there too.

484
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:52,829
So hopefully even with mobile we'll be seeing this in the near future.

485
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:58,214
I don't have, that's speculation again on my part, but it's nice not having to work

486
00:30:58,234 --> 00:31:02,798
for Google and worry about having it be front page news if I even hinted something like

487
00:31:02,818 --> 00:31:03,018
that.

488
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:07,001
I see some of my fellow Googlers are smiling ruefully at that one.

489
00:31:08,562 --> 00:31:12,923
So the trick is, and I only covered this one area here,

490
00:31:13,363 --> 00:31:16,764
but if you learn about the ways that the eye and the brain interact,

491
00:31:17,204 --> 00:31:21,166
you can actually get little cues, little clues really,

492
00:31:21,526 --> 00:31:24,507
that you can use to then ferret out these systems

493
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:28,088
and find ways that you can take shortcuts that can make the VR quality better.

494
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:30,868
So that's all I'm going to say about the motion side.

495
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,722
But motion is an important part of the sense of immersion

496
00:31:35,882 --> 00:31:36,842
that we get in VR.

497
00:31:37,202 --> 00:31:39,384
That word, immersion, gives you this sense

498
00:31:39,644 --> 00:31:41,245
of this nice warm bath.

499
00:31:41,645 --> 00:31:43,946
And certainly, VR is pretty amazing

500
00:31:44,907 --> 00:31:48,008
when it gets everything right of how

501
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:49,689
you feel that you're actually in the moment.

502
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:50,550
It's just.

503
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:57,096
It's almost indescribable and the nice thing is this is one of the few areas where everyone

504
00:31:57,136 --> 00:31:59,359
has had that experience and knows what it's like.

505
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,824
But the trick is there's a whole lot that you have to get right.

506
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:08,650
There are entire talks given to even just single elements of this, certainly this whole

507
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,491
range of things.

508
00:32:09,912 --> 00:32:11,514
I've listed some of the more common.

509
00:32:11,954 --> 00:32:15,136
areas that you need to get right. I've talked about getting the frame rate and the head

510
00:32:15,176 --> 00:32:19,278
tracking right, but that's only the beginning of the puzzle. There are so many other things

511
00:32:19,318 --> 00:32:24,181
that you need to do to try and recreate what we see with our eyes that it frankly at this

512
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:28,544
point with the processors, with the screens and everything we have, it is impossible to

513
00:32:28,604 --> 00:32:33,486
get really close to what our eyes and brains are capable of seeing. Happily though it feels

514
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:37,889
that we've gotten just good enough in the last few years that it starts to be a convincing

515
00:32:39,694 --> 00:32:43,855
simulation of that. One of the things that isn't even on this list that I've seen some

516
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:49,378
interesting first steps on is the fact that your eye works a bit like a camera and that

517
00:32:49,418 --> 00:32:53,100
you focus with muscles in your eye changing the shape of your eye and

518
00:32:54,841 --> 00:32:59,904
of the lens in your eye to focus, as a camera does, close and far away.

519
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:03,205
So if you hold your finger close to your eye, you focus on it,

520
00:33:03,245 --> 00:33:05,027
and everything else in the background is blurred.

521
00:33:05,087 --> 00:33:08,168
And likewise, if you look in the distance, you can hold your finger up,

522
00:33:08,228 --> 00:33:09,129
and that's kind of blurry.

523
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:13,311
It's because the lens in your eye is actually stretching and changing shape.

524
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:25,077
In current systems that are out there now, they can't account for that, but there will be systems coming in the fairly near future that will be able to actually, even with one eye closed, be able to give you a sense of depth.

525
00:33:25,477 --> 00:33:35,202
But right now, one of the miscues that we're getting is that things don't actually change depth of field when you're looking at them through a screen.

526
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,323
You're looking at this screen that's right in front of your eyes.

527
00:33:37,904 --> 00:33:40,566
and you can kind of fake it with some cases,

528
00:33:40,646 --> 00:33:43,408
but it actually doesn't quite do a full job there.

529
00:33:43,808 --> 00:33:45,970
So some part of your brain is saying,

530
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,311
there's something not right here,

531
00:33:47,351 --> 00:33:49,953
and if you're one of those unlucky people who raised your hand,

532
00:33:50,013 --> 00:33:51,934
it's probably making you feel a little bit ill.

533
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:53,896
So there's a lot to get right.

534
00:33:55,918 --> 00:33:58,159
If anybody here worked on this, don't raise your hand.

535
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:00,641
I'm sorry I brought this up because I found this online.

536
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:02,822
I thought it was a great example of what not to do.

537
00:34:03,702 --> 00:34:05,884
And I don't want to hit these people too hard because it's

538
00:34:05,904 --> 00:34:09,285
a language teaching program and they really weren't working so

539
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:10,446
much on VR visuals.

540
00:34:10,886 --> 00:34:13,408
But some of those things I had on that list before are just

541
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:14,308
broken here.

542
00:34:15,229 --> 00:34:18,611
For example, in the foreground, you've got a kind of blurred

543
00:34:20,312 --> 00:34:26,980
table and a crystal clear sharp bell that just really irritates me because it feels like that, you know,

544
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,508
if that, why is that so clear when the rest of it is is blurry and the blurriness is consistent. It should actually be

545
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:39,175
sharper, closer up, and a little blurrier in the distance or vice versa depending on where the depth of field is.

546
00:34:40,216 --> 00:34:47,523
The worst thing about this, in my opinion though, is that the interface that they have is floating there in space in front of you.

547
00:34:47,803 --> 00:34:50,365
And it turns out that this is a bad thing for a lot of reasons.

548
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:56,050
For one reason, your eyes are focusing on it and they're converging on this image.

549
00:34:56,531 --> 00:35:00,194
And even though that may be shown left and right in slightly different places,

550
00:35:00,614 --> 00:35:04,678
so that your eyes can say, yes, this is about two feet in front of me.

551
00:35:05,946 --> 00:35:11,189
It is almost certainly being done without any perspective change in the two eyes.

552
00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:14,771
And if it were a real thing, you'd have a different view from your right eye and your

553
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:17,412
left eye, particularly something that's only a few feet away.

554
00:35:17,693 --> 00:35:20,774
You see a little bit more of the edges of something on the right side with your right

555
00:35:20,874 --> 00:35:21,935
eye, left side, left eye.

556
00:35:22,835 --> 00:35:27,057
And in a lot of shortcuts people use like this for interface, they don't do that.

557
00:35:27,537 --> 00:35:33,679
So it's really a mistake to sort of violate that sense of presence by breaking any of

558
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:34,239
these rules.

559
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:39,980
And digetic interface is the term that's been brought up to actually put it into the world.

560
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,741
So in a case like this, you could just as easily put that interface.

561
00:35:44,302 --> 00:35:49,427
on what look like some plaques that are part of the 3D world and that are situated in that

562
00:35:49,707 --> 00:35:56,474
3D world that your eye converges on properly and it makes it a lot easier for someone to

563
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:56,914
perceive.

564
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:01,339
It's harder, it's a lot more processing to actually put those up correctly, but this

565
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:06,284
is one of the things that you, I think, should not take too many shortcuts with or it's really

566
00:36:06,324 --> 00:36:08,226
going to be irritating to the people.

567
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:11,591
And again, study the way the visual system works.

568
00:36:11,631 --> 00:36:14,034
There's a lot more than I can go into in just this hour.

569
00:36:14,514 --> 00:36:19,659
But another thing, another great lesson that turns out to be true of VR as it was

570
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:21,260
of other things is that less is more.

571
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,003
You don't actually have to get everything right.

572
00:36:24,403 --> 00:36:28,527
You can actually cut a lot of corners as long as you're very minimal about what you do.

573
00:36:28,567 --> 00:36:30,328
And I'll talk about some examples.

574
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:33,411
But first I want to remind everybody when you do get it right,

575
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:35,092
It's pretty amazing.

576
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:40,875
This is one of the first VR images I saw in the modern VR world that really convinced

577
00:36:43,696 --> 00:36:43,996
me.

578
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:50,559
I saw one of the early Valve tag rooms before they even announced what the Vive was.

579
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,681
It was just a life-changing experience for me.

580
00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:56,862
In particular, I remember

581
00:36:57,442 --> 00:36:59,864
when I was told, okay, pick up the controller.

582
00:37:00,465 --> 00:37:03,067
And I said, well, I can't see the controller.

583
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:04,708
So sure you can, look over your shoulder.

584
00:37:04,748 --> 00:37:07,871
And there on a virtual table was a virtual controller.

585
00:37:08,371 --> 00:37:09,873
And I remember reaching over thinking,

586
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:12,174
I thought I saw a table when I came into the room,

587
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:13,796
not really believing it,

588
00:37:14,156 --> 00:37:16,398
and feeling an actual controller

589
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:20,701
exactly where this virtual eye told me it would be.

590
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:22,703
And feeling that in my hand

591
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:25,886
was one of the most amazing moments I've had.

592
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:30,112
when VR gets this right, it's amazing.

593
00:37:30,152 --> 00:37:31,732
And it wasn't very high resolution.

594
00:37:32,212 --> 00:37:33,833
It was really just a simple trick

595
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:37,194
of combining that haptic feedback

596
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:38,455
of what I could feel in my hand

597
00:37:38,515 --> 00:37:40,195
with what my visual system told me,

598
00:37:40,576 --> 00:37:42,917
and it was exactly where it was supposed to be.

599
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:45,237
That's really a part of the critical thing,

600
00:37:45,257 --> 00:37:47,638
and part of what I think is the magic of VR,

601
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,499
and what we're really aiming for here.

602
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,840
So go for that feeling.

603
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,842
I've had a lot of people say, yeah, VR isn't ready yet.

604
00:37:53,862 --> 00:37:55,163
You know, we need another 20 years.

605
00:37:55,723 --> 00:37:58,065
No, I think you have that kind of experience.

606
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:00,727
And how many people here experiencing

607
00:38:00,787 --> 00:38:04,030
VR had at some point that amazing, whoa,

608
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,031
this is way more real than I thought it would be?

609
00:38:06,071 --> 00:38:06,792
Can I see hands?

610
00:38:06,832 --> 00:38:07,012
Yeah.

611
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:08,093
Look at how many hands.

612
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:10,294
Virtually everybody in the room is here

613
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:11,555
because they had that moment.

614
00:38:12,016 --> 00:38:12,936
Believe in it, folks.

615
00:38:13,317 --> 00:38:17,859
You can fool some of the people some of the time, or even all of the time, but there's a lot of us here.

616
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:25,102
And I've had that experience with every person I've brought in to VR with some very, very few exceptions.

617
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:32,566
And often it turns out that they have a wandering eye or some other problem that they can't focus and get that full sense of VR.

618
00:38:33,566 --> 00:38:39,549
Okay, next thing I want to cover though, what I think is the most important thing, is sense of emotion.

619
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,451
Anybody want to call out what this movie is?

620
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:46,451
Creature from the Black Lagoon, a classic.

621
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:50,875
What was really interesting about this is that it was one of the first movies that was

622
00:38:50,915 --> 00:38:56,480
done in 3D on a large scale with those awful little red and green things back in the 1950s,

623
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:57,001
I believe.

624
00:38:57,662 --> 00:39:02,166
And what they did is what a whole bunch of people with modern VR are doing, which are

625
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,689
saying, hey, we can scare people with this stuff.

626
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:08,692
And it turns out that VR is really good at scaring people.

627
00:39:09,493 --> 00:39:14,516
I don't know if you've seen maybe first hand or maybe the videos of people who were put

628
00:39:14,556 --> 00:39:19,420
into some kind of horror game and took their thousand dollar headset and threw it against

629
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,643
the wall before they realized, oh gee, sorry I was just so scared I had to get it off my

630
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:25,904
head as quickly as possible.

631
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,245
So probably not a great thing to do.

632
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:35,210
Cinema, as with some of these other things I've mentioned, has been experimenting with these things.

633
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,950
They're great as a place to learn from.

634
00:39:37,851 --> 00:39:42,752
My friend Hal Barwood, who is a film director and writer before he got into the games industry,

635
00:39:43,092 --> 00:39:47,514
had all sorts of interesting stories like this, including one about 3D sound

636
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:49,895
and how when they started to first do surround sound,

637
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:55,416
they found that people were about three times as likely to jump from the exact same sound

638
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,297
played behind them as in front of them.

639
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:02,319
Again, from an evolutionary standpoint, it makes perfect sense why we are hardwired to

640
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:06,240
be a lot more scared of stuff that's creeping up behind us than stuff that we can see in

641
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,601
front of us.

642
00:40:07,681 --> 00:40:13,203
With the 3D stuff, of course, all the way up even to frustratingly movies that are coming

643
00:40:13,323 --> 00:40:19,365
out this very week, there's stuff being thrown at your face to kind of, oh no.

644
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:24,787
That may work the very first time you've seen it, but please don't keep doing that.

645
00:40:25,027 --> 00:40:26,808
It gets very thin very quickly.

646
00:40:27,962 --> 00:40:33,265
you end up with something that will look as dated as our little monster here does very

647
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:33,685
quickly.

648
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:40,689
So, really what I'm saying is that VR and emotion in VR is a good servant and a bad

649
00:40:40,749 --> 00:40:41,290
master.

650
00:40:43,011 --> 00:40:47,433
You can go from that warm sense of immersion I was showing you.

651
00:40:48,174 --> 00:40:50,937
to really scary horror very quickly.

652
00:40:51,998 --> 00:40:54,961
This is actually, if you have that ability to

653
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:58,225
defocus your eyes or cross them to make a 3D image,

654
00:40:58,545 --> 00:41:02,750
when this girl sort of pops out in 3D, even just looking at the screen,

655
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,071
it's a little bit disturbing.

656
00:41:04,752 --> 00:41:09,477
But why is it so disturbing? Why is horror in VR so strong?

657
00:41:11,607 --> 00:41:14,728
This is one of those areas where there's some very clear brain science behind it.

658
00:41:15,288 --> 00:41:19,209
At the very bottom center of this, there's the amygdala called out.

659
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,250
And the amygdala is a very old part of the brain.

660
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,871
It's present in fish and reptile brains.

661
00:41:24,931 --> 00:41:28,352
In fact, it's much larger in proportion to the entire brain.

662
00:41:28,872 --> 00:41:32,195
in a lot of our ancestors and our relatives like that.

663
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:38,561
Our cerebral cortex, all that big gray matter where you do a lot of your critical thinking,

664
00:41:38,861 --> 00:41:41,784
is a relatively recent addition compared to the amygdala.

665
00:41:42,244 --> 00:41:46,188
And what the amygdala can handle are some very basic functions.

666
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:50,150
Fear is one of the primary things among them.

667
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,611
It also handles anger and aggression.

668
00:41:52,671 --> 00:41:56,053
And those two together give you the famous fight or flight

669
00:41:56,233 --> 00:41:58,754
that you need when you're under a threat

670
00:41:59,134 --> 00:42:01,575
to be able to decide almost instantly,

671
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:03,296
should I run away from this thing?

672
00:42:03,336 --> 00:42:04,076
Should I fight it?

673
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:07,137
And that is so much built into our DNA.

674
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:14,963
that it's the first thing that comes up before we do any kind of extra processing on that.

675
00:42:15,023 --> 00:42:20,307
One of the things that the amygdala also controls that is also just as deep and just as important

676
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:26,311
for propagation and evolution is arousal and intimacy.

677
00:42:26,351 --> 00:42:32,396
This is also part of our brain that gets activated in romance and when somebody is close to us

678
00:42:32,456 --> 00:42:33,937
physically or emotionally.

679
00:42:35,246 --> 00:42:38,910
A lot of that is mediated by the amygdala.

680
00:42:39,711 --> 00:42:45,998
Now in video games, the fight or flight stuff, aggression, fear, we're really good at that

681
00:42:46,058 --> 00:42:46,618
sort of thing.

682
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:51,864
The sort of softer emotions like empathy and love, we're not quite so good at that.

683
00:42:52,104 --> 00:42:53,666
We're still working on that piece.

684
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:59,932
And I'm really excited because for a long time, I've worked for several companies,

685
00:43:00,493 --> 00:43:03,776
LucasArts and DreamWorks in particular, where there were a lot of movie people.

686
00:43:04,157 --> 00:43:08,361
And they were sometimes even a little smug about the fact that movies were so much better

687
00:43:08,641 --> 00:43:12,125
at empathy, at love, at romance, and that sort of thing.

688
00:43:13,101 --> 00:43:16,683
This is something that's gone back a long time, but one of the reasons that they're

689
00:43:16,703 --> 00:43:20,484
good at it is because we feel that sense of intimacy.

690
00:43:20,744 --> 00:43:25,527
In fact, the very word brings forth the idea of being close to somebody, physically actually

691
00:43:25,587 --> 00:43:26,207
close to them.

692
00:43:26,627 --> 00:43:30,249
This goes way back again to film days, about a hundred years ago.

693
00:43:32,494 --> 00:43:36,617
the director, D.W. Griffith, was pitching to some people.

694
00:43:36,637 --> 00:43:40,801
He had Mary Pickford, who was one of the first It girls,

695
00:43:40,881 --> 00:43:44,324
one of the first actresses that was famous

696
00:43:44,384 --> 00:43:47,106
because she was so pretty and had that sense of presence

697
00:43:47,206 --> 00:43:49,068
on screen that came through.

698
00:43:49,528 --> 00:43:51,530
And he was gonna do something called close-ups

699
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:55,333
where her face could be 50 feet tall on the screen.

700
00:43:55,814 --> 00:44:00,077
And he didn't put it this way, of course, but the idea is to trick your brain into thinking

701
00:44:00,397 --> 00:44:04,200
not that she's 50 feet tall, but that she's normal size and she's really close to you.

702
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:12,766
And it turns out that movie executives haven't changed at all in the last hundred years,

703
00:44:12,806 --> 00:44:17,449
and that what he was told is, you know, Mr. Griffith, you know, I'm horrified at this.

704
00:44:17,909 --> 00:44:21,092
When we hired Miss Pickford, we paid for the entire actress.

705
00:44:21,252 --> 00:44:23,974
I want to see the entire actress on that screen.

706
00:44:24,654 --> 00:44:27,716
But he was able to convince them that close-ups actually are a good thing.

707
00:44:27,756 --> 00:44:32,298
And of course, they're one of the ways that movies have been able to give us that sense

708
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:35,920
of intimacy and leapfrog what we don't really get in games.

709
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:42,264
I mean, having even a full-screen game with a face close-up doesn't quite have

710
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,305
that same sense as when you're in a movie theater.

711
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:52,113
But with VR, you can be every bit as close, and in fact even closer, and it's even better

712
00:44:52,533 --> 00:44:58,475
than a movie screen or even a 3D projection because it's tricking more of your senses,

713
00:44:58,835 --> 00:45:01,377
and as you turn your head, you can tell that this character

714
00:45:01,793 --> 00:45:04,854
or this person or this hedgehog is right there next to you.

715
00:45:05,354 --> 00:45:09,295
Some of the Oculus people a few years ago gave a great talk about how they actually

716
00:45:09,335 --> 00:45:14,997
ran into trouble with this because I'm sure a lot of people here have seen Henry the Oculus

717
00:45:15,097 --> 00:45:15,857
movie that they did.

718
00:45:16,298 --> 00:45:18,118
He's a sad little hedgehog.

719
00:45:18,178 --> 00:45:20,319
It's his birthday and all of his friends have abandoned him.

720
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:23,141
He doesn't have many friends because he's so spiny.

721
00:45:23,661 --> 00:45:25,883
And you really feel sorry for the guy.

722
00:45:25,943 --> 00:45:28,745
And part of that, I'm convinced, and now it's conjecture,

723
00:45:28,765 --> 00:45:31,147
but I think it's based on good inference from the way

724
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,529
that your brain works, is because you are physically

725
00:45:34,769 --> 00:45:37,251
right there in the room with him, and he's right next to you.

726
00:45:37,511 --> 00:45:40,273
And you get that sense of empathy and caring about him,

727
00:45:40,373 --> 00:45:41,254
partly because of that.

728
00:45:41,594 --> 00:45:43,095
And also partly because of something else.

729
00:45:43,135 --> 00:45:44,416
He looks you right in the eye.

730
00:45:44,717 --> 00:45:46,158
And he can tell when you look at him,

731
00:45:46,598 --> 00:45:47,959
not so much from where your eyes are,

732
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:49,780
but just from the way your whole head is pointing.

733
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,541
in the camera and they found that people responded really well

734
00:45:53,902 --> 00:45:57,783
when you look at him directly and he would smile and wave at you and his eyes

735
00:45:57,823 --> 00:45:58,403
would get big.

736
00:45:58,763 --> 00:46:02,324
So they put a lot of that in there. They didn't stop to think that the story they

737
00:46:02,364 --> 00:46:05,145
did is about him being sad and lonely because he has no friends.

738
00:46:05,745 --> 00:46:08,806
Hi, how are you doing? Yeah, it's so awful. Everyone I care about

739
00:46:09,226 --> 00:46:12,247
hates me. Hi, how are you doing? It's like, oh, wow, I guess I'm

740
00:46:12,867 --> 00:46:13,187
a real...

741
00:46:13,587 --> 00:46:15,809
pariah here and he doesn't like me for some reason.

742
00:46:16,169 --> 00:46:22,552
So they actually had a bit of a misconnect between their script and the emotional connection

743
00:46:22,892 --> 00:46:24,573
of both that proximity and gaze.

744
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:28,856
And gaze is, we haven't experimented with a lot in VR.

745
00:46:29,216 --> 00:46:31,377
As we get into eye tracking, expect we'll do more.

746
00:46:31,877 --> 00:46:34,139
In film, it's been done all over the place.

747
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:37,721
Actors are famous for their smoldering looks.

748
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:40,863
And it really affects you emotionally.

749
00:46:40,883 --> 00:46:42,285
And again, you look at this close up,

750
00:46:42,865 --> 00:46:45,648
when Leonardo DiCaprio or Kate Winslet

751
00:46:45,968 --> 00:46:47,229
are right there in front of you,

752
00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:48,490
you can see them close up,

753
00:46:48,971 --> 00:46:50,272
and it affects you emotionally.

754
00:46:51,126 --> 00:46:53,287
Well, this works really well in VR.

755
00:46:53,668 --> 00:46:56,289
And in terms of shortcuts, you don't need an actor.

756
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:57,650
You don't need full resolution.

757
00:46:58,791 --> 00:47:00,692
Google has something called Spotlight Stories

758
00:47:00,752 --> 00:47:02,313
that I'm still very fond of.

759
00:47:02,394 --> 00:47:03,814
And when I was working for them, I

760
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,536
would try and promote it because a lot of people

761
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:06,716
weren't that familiar with them.

762
00:47:07,097 --> 00:47:09,358
How many people here have seen Spotlight Stories

763
00:47:09,438 --> 00:47:10,259
and played around with them?

764
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:11,499
That's not bad.

765
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:13,780
You see, I'm up to about a third of the room.

766
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,921
I think two years ago I would get one or two hands that would go up.

767
00:47:17,262 --> 00:47:20,743
I strongly recommend, I'm going to mention a few more of them in the next few minutes.

768
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:28,206
This particular one is called Pearl, and it was the first movie made for VR that was nominated

769
00:47:28,286 --> 00:47:29,046
for an Oscar.

770
00:47:29,326 --> 00:47:32,448
Unfortunately, it didn't win this year, but it did win an Emmy this year.

771
00:47:33,357 --> 00:47:36,180
I'd really recommend you check it out on whatever VR system you have.

772
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:42,186
It's available on quite a wide range and certainly on Daydream and the less expensive ones, as

773
00:47:42,246 --> 00:47:43,548
well as on Vive.

774
00:47:43,628 --> 00:47:44,989
And it's really effective.

775
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:49,554
Part of the reason it's effective, it's a very short, it's like a five minute, almost

776
00:47:49,594 --> 00:47:52,357
like the Pixar shorts you see before they're full features.

777
00:47:52,978 --> 00:47:55,320
And as you can see, not very high resolution.

778
00:47:55,621 --> 00:47:56,902
There's no dialogue in it.

779
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:58,043
So quite simple.

780
00:47:58,423 --> 00:48:02,187
But it's shot almost entirely from the passenger seat of a car.

781
00:48:02,628 --> 00:48:07,292
So you get, this is a full 360 view and of course when it's actually in VR, you're seeing

782
00:48:07,312 --> 00:48:10,596
a much narrower field of view so everyone seems much closer.

783
00:48:11,036 --> 00:48:15,721
And you get that sense of physical intimacy which I believe is triggering your amygdala.

784
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:19,345
is making you feel like these people are right there in the car with you.

785
00:48:19,666 --> 00:48:21,829
You could reach out and touch them and vice versa.

786
00:48:22,129 --> 00:48:24,232
And that I think is triggering a sense of empathy.

787
00:48:24,733 --> 00:48:25,694
I found myself

788
00:48:26,648 --> 00:48:29,909
watching this in VR, it's extremely emotionally engaging.

789
00:48:30,269 --> 00:48:32,450
And when I've seen it on YouTube on a flat screen,

790
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:34,191
it doesn't have that same effect.

791
00:48:34,231 --> 00:48:35,552
And then I go back into VR,

792
00:48:35,732 --> 00:48:37,893
and I actually find myself moved to tears again.

793
00:48:38,493 --> 00:48:40,674
So I would recommend that you check that out.

794
00:48:40,694 --> 00:48:45,036
Of course, your mileage may vary about what really hits you.

795
00:48:45,196 --> 00:48:48,257
So for emotion, I would recommend watch out

796
00:48:48,698 --> 00:48:49,758
with fear and aggression.

797
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:52,699
Yes, you can get really strong with VR very easily,

798
00:48:52,759 --> 00:48:54,260
but you can overdo it very easily.

799
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:54,760
Let's not.

800
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,203
be the laughingstock of the future and overdo it.

801
00:48:59,223 --> 00:49:05,908
I really think there's a lot of room for emotion and empathy and even romance in games that

802
00:49:05,928 --> 00:49:07,869
we can do in VR films.

803
00:49:08,129 --> 00:49:10,351
I'll get into some speculation on that in a moment.

804
00:49:11,071 --> 00:49:14,473
But realize that VR is building on very old biology.

805
00:49:14,513 --> 00:49:17,956
This is talking about stuff that in some cases is many millions of years old.

806
00:49:18,336 --> 00:49:22,079
The amygdala was formed, as far as scientists can tell,

807
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,063
hundreds of millions of years ago by our very, very distant ancestors.

808
00:49:27,363 --> 00:49:31,306
You can use this to explore some really new approaches that we've never been able to do before.

809
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:33,288
What are some of those things?

810
00:49:33,328 --> 00:49:34,889
Well, let me speculate on a few of them.

811
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:36,550
In terms of movies,

812
00:49:37,692 --> 00:49:40,053
Again, I'll hit some of the spotlight stories.

813
00:49:40,413 --> 00:49:42,954
There are two that I would also strongly recommend you look at.

814
00:49:43,054 --> 00:49:47,696
Special Delivery and The Simpsons did a 600th episode in VR.

815
00:49:48,136 --> 00:49:50,917
What's interesting about both of these is that both of these are comedy.

816
00:49:51,297 --> 00:49:55,059
Special Delivery was done by Aardman Studios who do the Wallace and Gromit films.

817
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,561
They both use a 360 view, all the spotlight stories do.

818
00:50:01,544 --> 00:50:04,026
to give you the ability to look anywhere around you.

819
00:50:04,426 --> 00:50:06,047
But they've built a bunch of Easter eggs

820
00:50:06,107 --> 00:50:07,909
and little stories that pop up.

821
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:09,891
And in special delivery, in fact,

822
00:50:09,951 --> 00:50:13,614
it's about a night watchman who thinks there's a burglar.

823
00:50:13,654 --> 00:50:16,336
And it turns out it's Christmas Eve and it's Santa Claus.

824
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:17,597
Sorry for the spoiler there.

825
00:50:18,118 --> 00:50:20,980
But the point is that he's tracking Santa

826
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,582
all through this courtyard.

827
00:50:22,622 --> 00:50:25,264
And you're in the center of the courtyard rotating around,

828
00:50:25,624 --> 00:50:26,905
looking into the rear windows.

829
00:50:27,086 --> 00:50:28,827
It was actually kind of Hitchcock-inspired

830
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:29,528
in a couple of ways.

831
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:31,910
of all these different apartments.

832
00:50:32,411 --> 00:50:34,332
But if you look away from the night watchman,

833
00:50:34,653 --> 00:50:36,354
they basically go into a pause loop

834
00:50:36,455 --> 00:50:38,476
and there are other little stories that you can uncover

835
00:50:38,517 --> 00:50:41,219
just by looking at them without needing any gaze

836
00:50:41,259 --> 00:50:42,801
but just seeing which way your head is turned.

837
00:50:43,201 --> 00:50:45,563
And some of those play out over several episodes

838
00:50:45,603 --> 00:50:47,906
so that even in the couple of minutes that this story runs

839
00:50:48,266 --> 00:50:51,907
If you go back and look at a woman, she's feeding some pigeons, and that's great.

840
00:50:52,307 --> 00:50:56,768
You go away, you look at her again, there are so many pigeons that she gets scared and runs inside her house.

841
00:50:57,248 --> 00:51:00,308
The third time you look at her, the pigeons have formed a little pyramid,

842
00:51:00,548 --> 00:51:05,709
and the one on top is trying to open the doorknob, and she's inside peeping out in horror at this,

843
00:51:06,149 --> 00:51:08,610
because they want to get all the breadcrumbs right away.

844
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:13,191
So that kind of thing of building in Easter eggs, I think, is really great.

845
00:51:15,087 --> 00:51:19,307
And the fact that it's up to you, that there's interactivity and that you get to choose where to look.

846
00:51:19,587 --> 00:51:21,708
But another thing that's come up is sort of a negative lesson.

847
00:51:21,988 --> 00:51:25,248
People don't like to stand up and rotate for very long periods of time.

848
00:51:25,808 --> 00:51:31,569
So I really think that we're going to be seeing a lot of 180 degree seated VR, where you sit down

849
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:35,670
and you can turn your head and see stuff happening all around you it seems,

850
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:38,371
but you don't need to be constantly looking behind you.

851
00:51:39,131 --> 00:51:43,152
It really is distracting, it's exhausting to try and do it too much.

852
00:51:43,632 --> 00:51:45,394
And that in turn will make it easier.

853
00:51:45,454 --> 00:51:47,055
We won't have to render quite as much.

854
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:50,679
It will be much easier to shoot it when you don't have to worry about hiding the cameras

855
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:54,062
completely because of course with regular film you can do that because they're only

856
00:51:54,122 --> 00:51:54,983
pointing one way.

857
00:51:55,403 --> 00:52:00,168
Here's a way of compromising between that wide field of view of VR but not 360.

858
00:52:00,548 --> 00:52:02,670
So I think we're going to see quite a bit of that.

859
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:04,192
It's easier to shoot it.

860
00:52:04,232 --> 00:52:05,493
It's easier to light it that way.

861
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,462
The interactivity can come through the gaze.

862
00:52:08,502 --> 00:52:12,826
You can tell which way people are looking, at least at first with the way their heads

863
00:52:12,866 --> 00:52:17,511
are pointed, and soon with their actual eyes, with eye tracking.

864
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:21,315
This could be a shared reality where we're all seeing the same thing, or it could be

865
00:52:21,335 --> 00:52:22,376
essentially single player.

866
00:52:23,617 --> 00:52:30,781
You know, your own particular preferences are either for Kate Winslet or for Leonardo DiCaprio.

867
00:52:31,061 --> 00:52:36,824
You could see it only from the point of view that you want to see and not have to, as we do now in movies, see both points of view of that.

868
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:41,026
Or you could have something that's meant to be essentially a single-player experience,

869
00:52:41,306 --> 00:52:44,428
that everyone gets a different experience each time that they view it.

870
00:52:44,908 --> 00:52:48,650
But in general, there's going to be strong replay value, so you can shoot these things once.

871
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:52,651
and have people come back and watch them over and over again to catch all the bits they missed.

872
00:52:52,691 --> 00:52:58,814
With that Simpsons episode, there's one point where I look up and I realize that they've done a little gag on the Sistine Chapel

873
00:52:59,114 --> 00:53:02,415
and painted on the roof above me is a little Easter egg.

874
00:53:04,016 --> 00:53:08,738
It's also the monetization side that if you imagine these kinds of VR movies happening,

875
00:53:09,158 --> 00:53:13,780
you can do ads or product placement in real time so that in the world around you,

876
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,522
there can be actual real time ads that are changed every time somebody sees it.

877
00:53:18,923 --> 00:53:23,627
Okay. Games as Medicine, this is an area that I've been working a lot in. I know not a lot

878
00:53:23,647 --> 00:53:28,652
of people are in it at the moment. I'm going to talk about some stuff that is not VR for

879
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:33,157
a moment. Just in the last week there have been a couple of announcements. Paratherapeutics

880
00:53:33,477 --> 00:53:41,645
got FDA approval for an app that will help treat substance addiction. It's used in conjunction

881
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:42,265
with therapy.

882
00:53:44,482 --> 00:53:48,265
There's another company called Akili that I'll mention in a moment, but what's exciting

883
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:52,309
about them is that they're in the process of trying to get FDA approval for the first

884
00:53:52,349 --> 00:53:56,732
time of actually being able to prescribe the game on the same level as pharmaceuticals,

885
00:53:57,133 --> 00:54:01,877
which opens up a $300 billion annual market where you can actually have a doctor say,

886
00:54:02,057 --> 00:54:05,680
yes, you need to play this game, and here's a prescription for it.

887
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,281
Really exciting area.

888
00:54:07,301 --> 00:54:09,002
They're hoping to get approval.

889
00:54:09,383 --> 00:54:12,986
It's in double-blind testing, so they won't know until later this year.

890
00:54:13,646 --> 00:54:17,807
Play to Prevent was a project I worked on very briefly with some people at Yale.

891
00:54:18,327 --> 00:54:21,228
It's a game, a 2D game, and you see it pictured here.

892
00:54:21,828 --> 00:54:24,609
Jesse Schell's Schell Games Studio did the work on that.

893
00:54:25,249 --> 00:54:29,251
It's this great game to teach kids, teenagers, about risky behavior

894
00:54:29,651 --> 00:54:35,172
and has actually now been found in their own study to actually lower the amount of risky behavior

895
00:54:35,492 --> 00:54:39,914
by teaching them through the gameplay that it's not such a great idea to get drunk

896
00:54:40,274 --> 00:54:43,115
and go out and have sexual encounters, for example.

897
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:49,884
NeuroRacer was another project I got involved with that was started about 10 years ago here

898
00:54:49,904 --> 00:54:57,167
at UCSF that was to treat aging adults who are less able to pay attention to signs as

899
00:54:57,207 --> 00:54:58,568
they're driving as they get older.

900
00:54:58,908 --> 00:55:03,871
And they found that through game therapy they were able to bring them back to the level

901
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:08,873
of about a 30-year-old, even if they were 70 when they start this process, in terms

902
00:55:08,913 --> 00:55:12,015
of being able to perceive signs and still control a car.

903
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:17,398
and process this and that became the basis of this Evo game that is the one that I mentioned

904
00:55:17,418 --> 00:55:19,780
that's currently being reviewed by the FDA.

905
00:55:20,801 --> 00:55:23,923
I really think we're going to be seeing a lot more of this if they get the approval

906
00:55:24,023 --> 00:55:27,066
and it opens up this part of this $300 billion a year market.

907
00:55:27,386 --> 00:55:30,328
There will obviously be a pretty quick gold rush to this.

908
00:55:30,808 --> 00:55:32,970
It's tough though because in order to get approval

909
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:37,272
You need to make a game, high quality game, as you can see the graphics in this are great.

910
00:55:37,312 --> 00:55:40,574
There's a lot of ex-LucasArts people who were behind this to begin with.

911
00:55:40,974 --> 00:55:46,117
So they drew heavily on the game side, but they also drew just as heavily on neuroscientists and doctors

912
00:55:46,497 --> 00:55:47,918
to make sure that the medicine worked.

913
00:55:49,865 --> 00:55:52,707
And what you're going to see though is that you're going to need to put a team together,

914
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:59,370
make a game, and then freeze it and test it for sometimes a year or two years, and then

915
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:00,371
be able to release it.

916
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:04,272
So all those people you hired have to stick around for those couple of years before you

917
00:56:04,312 --> 00:56:06,734
even know whether you're going to get the approval to release it.

918
00:56:07,074 --> 00:56:11,356
It's not an easy path, but it can be a really lucrative one, and it can be one where games

919
00:56:11,416 --> 00:56:15,758
are actually helping people in a really direct, obvious, scientifically provable way.

920
00:56:15,818 --> 00:56:17,199
So I'm very excited about that.

921
00:56:17,879 --> 00:56:20,022
A lot of possibilities with that in VR.

922
00:56:20,102 --> 00:56:21,984
Some of them have already started to happen.

923
00:56:22,885 --> 00:56:27,209
We've seen phobia treatment in VR since some of the very early headsets.

924
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:34,117
Woman on top there is an arachnophobe and seeing VR spiders was just as scary to her

925
00:56:34,177 --> 00:56:36,519
as seeing real spiders, but much safer.

926
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,362
Fear of flying, for example, also.

927
00:56:40,183 --> 00:56:44,966
They used to take people into airplanes and then get them off, but after 9-11 it became

928
00:56:45,006 --> 00:56:48,428
much harder to bring people into an airport and get on an airplane and get off.

929
00:56:48,888 --> 00:56:53,531
You can do that with virtual planes, and if somebody gets nervous or has a panic attack

930
00:56:53,631 --> 00:56:57,033
in the midst of a takeoff, bang, they shut the simulation down.

931
00:56:57,073 --> 00:57:00,615
You don't have to worry about the fact that you're actually in a plane and you can't stop.

932
00:57:02,093 --> 00:57:05,756
Post-traumatic stress disorder has been treated successfully with VR.

933
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:10,641
Acute pain remediation, as you're seeing in the bottom slide there, turns out that VR's

934
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:14,705
sense of immersion can take people out of their bodies and take them away from that

935
00:57:14,785 --> 00:57:16,887
feeling of pain that they're in the midst of.

936
00:57:17,627 --> 00:57:19,729
It's great for training doctors and caregivers.

937
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,371
There's a company in Chicago.

938
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:27,095
That's teaching people to care for people with macular degeneration where you get this

939
00:57:27,435 --> 00:57:33,721
sort of black, I talked about the fovea, their foveas are obscured by this essentially gray

940
00:57:33,781 --> 00:57:35,083
cloud as it breaks down.

941
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,546
In the training, you actually have to go through having a dinner.

942
00:57:38,927 --> 00:57:42,287
with some people, and wherever you look, there's this big gray cloud.

943
00:57:42,387 --> 00:57:46,248
So you get to experience very much like what the patients that you're going to be dealing

944
00:57:46,288 --> 00:57:50,209
with have to deal with every day, and you suddenly understand how much harder it is

945
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:52,570
to be able to just get stuff out of the corner of your eye.

946
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:59,211
Mirror therapy after a stroke is being done, where if someone's right side is functional

947
00:57:59,251 --> 00:58:00,271
and the left side is not.

948
00:58:00,652 --> 00:58:05,633
If in VR, they see their left side functioning, it turns out that it grows some neural connections

949
00:58:05,693 --> 00:58:08,533
and can regrow some of the connections that are broken by the stroke.

950
00:58:09,995 --> 00:58:16,020
Asperger's, if you look at eye tracking, people who are on the autism spectrum often have

951
00:58:16,061 --> 00:58:21,326
trouble knowing where to look, what cues to get to what emotion somebody may be experiencing.

952
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:24,949
Now you can tell whether they're looking at somebody's face or not, or even whether they're

953
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:28,453
looking at the right part of somebody's face, and there's some interesting training going

954
00:58:28,533 --> 00:58:28,833
on there.

955
00:58:29,874 --> 00:58:35,938
There's even room, there's now more speculation, but I've seen some early suggestions that

956
00:58:36,018 --> 00:58:42,281
VR may both diagnose and possibly even treat some aspects of depression, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's.

957
00:58:42,742 --> 00:58:44,183
So really exciting stuff.

958
00:58:45,323 --> 00:58:47,264
But really the future is in your hands.

959
00:58:47,805 --> 00:58:49,486
A lot of that stuff, that last stuff,

960
00:58:49,566 --> 00:58:51,547
is very heavily on the speculative side.

961
00:58:51,927 --> 00:58:55,488
And yet it is inferred because of some very promising

962
00:58:55,629 --> 00:58:57,509
early research that I've seen.

963
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:00,511
So I'm urging you to get out there, try these things.

964
00:59:00,611 --> 00:59:02,432
Whether you are looking for neuroscience

965
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:05,193
to inform your games and make your entertainment better,

966
00:59:05,613 --> 00:59:07,654
or use your entertainment to make neuroscience

967
00:59:07,955 --> 00:59:10,336
more effective in treating people and helping people.

968
00:59:10,796 --> 00:59:15,299
Both of those are really exciting areas, and I'm going to leave it at that.

969
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:21,424
I've got time for just maybe one or two questions, so if people will line up at the microphones,

970
00:59:21,484 --> 00:59:27,648
and also don't forget when you get your responses, your request for responses, to do a rating

971
00:59:27,688 --> 00:59:29,450
of the talk, and I'll leave it at that.

972
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:30,190
Thank you very much.

973
00:59:37,042 --> 00:59:40,243
Yes, I have a neuroscience question for you, which has always puzzled me.

974
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,364
You know the expression, looks can kill.

975
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:46,666
So we know that we can give out a certain kind of energy from our eyes.

976
00:59:47,026 --> 00:59:50,507
I mean, without changing any other part of our face, I can look at you in a way that

977
00:59:50,567 --> 00:59:53,048
is devastating, and I can look at you in a place that is loving.

978
00:59:53,468 --> 00:59:58,810
Do we know what's actually happening physically inside the eye when those changes are happening?

979
01:00:01,492 --> 01:00:04,935
I am not a neuroscientist, so this is a very layman's understanding of this.

980
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:08,499
The one thing about that that I can say is that it is...

981
01:00:10,052 --> 01:00:13,674
easy for us to think that we're getting it just from someone's eyes, but there are a

982
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:17,677
lot of interesting studies that suggest we may be reading body language and a lot of

983
01:00:17,717 --> 01:00:19,058
other things subconsciously.

984
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:21,460
So I would question that assumption.

985
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:27,584
There was a famous, again it comes to the film side, a famous thing where a, I believe

986
01:00:27,604 --> 01:00:31,787
it was a Russian filmmaker, cut between people's close up staring.

987
01:00:31,807 --> 01:00:34,369
Eisenstein, Serge, yeah, Eisenstein.

988
01:00:34,509 --> 01:00:35,430
And that was a case where.

989
01:00:36,351 --> 01:00:37,611
depending on how you were primed,

990
01:00:37,631 --> 01:00:39,212
you read a totally different expression

991
01:00:39,572 --> 01:00:41,153
into that exact same image.

992
01:00:41,994 --> 01:00:43,775
My guess would be that it may actually

993
01:00:43,815 --> 01:00:45,376
be more complex than...

994
01:00:45,696 --> 01:00:48,077
We focus on people's eyes for many reasons,

995
01:00:48,157 --> 01:00:49,818
in particular because it's really

996
01:00:49,878 --> 01:00:51,579
critical to know what that other person

997
01:00:51,759 --> 01:00:52,920
is looking at on you.

998
01:00:53,881 --> 01:00:55,902
I'm guessing, and this is again

999
01:00:55,982 --> 01:00:57,282
a layman's sense,

1000
01:00:57,343 --> 01:00:59,684
that it's probably, if I'm looking at you

1001
01:00:59,724 --> 01:01:01,945
like this, or I'm looking at you like that,

1002
01:01:02,594 --> 01:01:06,875
then my body language may be telling you a lot more than my eyes actually are.

1003
01:01:07,255 --> 01:01:11,357
And yet, I don't know, it may be micro muscles around the eyes,

1004
01:01:11,737 --> 01:01:17,238
it may be the way that your pupils grow or your pupils get bigger the more attentive you are.

1005
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:21,580
So if I'm looking at you casually, it may actually not be,

1006
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:25,401
my pupils are very small. If my pupils get bigger.

1007
01:01:26,161 --> 01:01:28,863
you can pick up on the fact that I'm interested in what's going on.

1008
01:01:28,923 --> 01:01:33,066
It's actually a reason why romantic settings are often dim,

1009
01:01:33,126 --> 01:01:35,067
because your pupils get bigger when it's darker,

1010
01:01:35,368 --> 01:01:36,889
and it makes you feel like you're more,

1011
01:01:37,129 --> 01:01:39,150
you actually have more attention of the other person.

1012
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:40,311
So that's about the extent to which I know.

1013
01:01:40,331 --> 01:01:42,933
I was just thinking in terms of replicating or evoking an emotion in VR,

1014
01:01:42,973 --> 01:01:44,594
that that could be an important thing to know about.

1015
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:46,135
It's an interesting thing to explore,

1016
01:01:46,155 --> 01:01:48,777
and that's partly why I think eye tracking is going to be so critical.

1017
01:01:49,177 --> 01:01:50,699
But we'll have to experiment.

1018
01:01:51,799 --> 01:01:56,200
And one more question, I think I'll go out in the hall if people have more stuff to follow up on.

1019
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:14,304
Yeah, I had a question. So I run an immersive audio company and last year we had a, we worked on a horror VR game and our audio programmer actually had PTSD from having to work inside of, he couldn't, he had to eventually, he said no, no more changes.

1020
01:02:15,604 --> 01:02:16,384
It is how it is.

1021
01:02:16,744 --> 01:02:19,445
And so we run a, we're out of Tempe, Arizona,

1022
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:22,606
and we run a VR for Good organization now.

1023
01:02:23,146 --> 01:02:27,347
And so I'm just wondering, what is the, yeah, it's a.

1024
01:02:27,367 --> 01:02:28,607
Trying to make up for what you've done.

1025
01:02:28,627 --> 01:02:31,728
Exactly, yes, yes, we're in repentance right now.

1026
01:02:32,268 --> 01:02:35,809
But I just wanted to know, what is the discussion

1027
01:02:35,849 --> 01:02:39,510
that's happening, like we're talking about this right now,

1028
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:40,810
but what about developers?

1029
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:44,411
I know just reading The Brain by David Eagleman.

1030
01:02:45,331 --> 01:02:49,613
He talks about how our brain really functions almost as like a peripheral device

1031
01:02:50,294 --> 01:02:53,576
that can take outside information and start to interpret it.

1032
01:02:54,296 --> 01:02:57,998
What is, my big question is, what is happening, what is going to happen

1033
01:02:58,118 --> 01:03:01,440
once we start taking this incredibly immersive tool,

1034
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:05,582
hooking it up to our brain, and feeding it content that,

1035
01:03:06,163 --> 01:03:07,503
that in the beginning it's, it's...

1036
01:03:08,892 --> 01:03:12,953
We kind of have this friendly, innocent approach to like,

1037
01:03:12,973 --> 01:03:15,293
let's try to scare somebody, but what kind of effect

1038
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,514
is that going to have on people?

1039
01:03:17,054 --> 01:03:19,775
And are we having this discussion amongst developers?

1040
01:03:20,015 --> 01:03:24,356
Yeah, so the good news is I have heard that discussion going

1041
01:03:24,576 --> 01:03:26,337
on in a number of areas.

1042
01:03:29,498 --> 01:03:34,501
A bit scary part is the fact that it is a little bit of Wild West out there, and there's

1043
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:41,465
nothing to stop people from trying things that may be too scary or too jarring for the

1044
01:03:41,525 --> 01:03:41,866
public.

1045
01:03:42,546 --> 01:03:46,509
But, of course, that's always been the case with books, movies, a lot of other areas.

1046
01:03:46,529 --> 01:03:51,272
I'm not forgiving it, but I also don't think it should be banned or regulated, because

1047
01:03:51,332 --> 01:03:55,615
I think we need to let people be able to experience that and make their own decisions.

1048
01:03:55,635 --> 01:03:58,456
I often use an example of pastry chefs.

1049
01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:03,480
in that if you do nothing but eat exquisite desserts,

1050
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:05,521
it's really terrible for your health,

1051
01:04:05,581 --> 01:04:08,383
but the solution is not to ban desserts.

1052
01:04:08,823 --> 01:04:11,425
It's to use it in moderation and to use common sense

1053
01:04:11,825 --> 01:04:15,227
and to be responsible both as creators and as consumers.

1054
01:04:15,767 --> 01:04:19,229
And that's unfortunately the best I can say about it at the moment.

1055
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:23,732
But part of what I've actually been drawn to this partly because I do want to see what

1056
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:29,195
positive things, what undeniably scientifically proven positive results we can get from this.

1057
01:04:29,535 --> 01:04:33,438
Because that does help counterbalance the fact that like any tool, I have that, you

1058
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:35,419
know, good servant, bad master thing.

1059
01:04:35,819 --> 01:04:37,940
You have to really be careful about how you use it.

1060
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,941
And I think we need to be responsible.

1061
01:04:40,362 --> 01:04:42,002
I know I'm not the only one bringing this up.

1062
01:04:42,022 --> 01:04:46,405
I've heard at a number of other VR conferences people talking about responsible use of that

1063
01:04:46,445 --> 01:04:48,005
emotional connection in VR.

1064
01:04:48,806 --> 01:04:51,947
But beyond that, I think there's so much we're still experimenting with.

1065
01:04:52,668 --> 01:04:56,630
We will have to try our way through that, and I'm encouraged by the fact that there

1066
01:04:56,750 --> 01:05:01,852
are a lot of reputable scientists and universities that are exploring a lot of this stuff, and

1067
01:05:01,912 --> 01:05:04,033
the faster we can get that information, the better.

1068
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:09,284
So is there a resource that, because I totally agree with you, is there a resource that we

1069
01:05:09,344 --> 01:05:14,769
can go to in order to learn more about things that we should be thinking about?

1070
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,590
I don't know of any central resource.

1071
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:21,554
I actually have people at another conference, somebody came up in questions and said,

1072
01:05:22,195 --> 01:05:24,597
maybe we should start a central repository.

1073
01:05:24,977 --> 01:05:26,618
And somebody else said, well, yes, but who do you,

1074
01:05:26,858 --> 01:05:28,360
how do you regulate what gets into it

1075
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:30,641
and verify whether it's some crackpot thing that,

1076
01:05:31,002 --> 01:05:32,803
you know, it's chemtrails that are, you know,

1077
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:34,704
seeping into our VR systems.

1078
01:05:36,606 --> 01:05:37,887
And that's a tough problem.

1079
01:05:38,287 --> 01:05:40,149
And it's not really my area of expertise.

1080
01:05:40,189 --> 01:05:41,870
So I'm going to dodge that for now,

1081
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:45,112
but I would happily support efforts along those lines.

1082
01:05:45,152 --> 01:05:48,295
And I hope that we will have some better ways

1083
01:05:48,335 --> 01:05:49,976
of being able to measure that in the near future.

1084
01:05:50,116 --> 01:05:50,657
Okay, thank you.

1085
01:05:50,937 --> 01:05:51,197
Thank you.

1086
01:05:51,471 --> 01:05:55,396
And I'm going to head outside now so they can clear the room and I think we've got lunch

1087
01:05:55,436 --> 01:05:56,137
coming up next.

1088
01:05:56,157 --> 01:05:56,658
But thank you very much.

1089
01:05:56,678 --> 01:05:56,938
Thank you.

1090
01:05:56,958 --> 01:05:57,238
Thank you.
