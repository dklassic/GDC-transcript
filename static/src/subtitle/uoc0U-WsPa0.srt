1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,320
My name is Jason Weiser and for the last four years I've been teaching a crazy

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,080
pants course at Tufts University called game design which is actually tabletop

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,880
game design, alternate reality game design, game testing, introduction to the

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,560
Unity game engine and C-sharp programming, intro to 3d art and

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,600
animation, intro to 2d art and UI, intro to audio for games, paper prototyping,

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,760
level design including rational game design and encounter building, VR tools

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,960
and considerations, team building and communication, digital game prototyping,

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,360
pipeline development, modes of team management, marketing, industry networking

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,920
and more. This past fall I described this course to the excellent Mr. Ian Schreiber

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,160
who's on the board of the education summit and his response boiled down to

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,880
this course of yours breaks all the rules I know for game education. I always

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,200
tell people to learn one thing at a time otherwise you're going to end up

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,040
frustrated with a doom project and yet you just mash it all together and go. In

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,200
my head I can't imagine how this could possibly work. Do you ever get any decent

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,040
quality games out of the class or is it 100% train wrecks and learning by

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,800
failure? I'm not doing a particularly good Ian imitation but in other words

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:27,480
who would ever want to take this circus and who would ever want to teach it? And

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,520
I said to him actually all the projects succeed as engaging and playable

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,160
prototypes and many are really original and some have gone on to be published on

20
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,880
the steam and the app stores and then last month he asked me to deliver a talk

21
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,520
where I proved this can work in front of hundreds of people and in fact we got a

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,520
couple hundred of you. So here we are. Thank you for being here. I should

23
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,640
mention a couple of things. Please turn off your audio devices and when you get

24
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,880
your eval thingy please fill out the eval thingy. So a bit of background. I'm

25
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,120
an animator and game design and educator. I animate for games and museums and

26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,800
robots and television and I'm the creative director of Yaya play games

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,360
where I design stuff with my daughter including the award-winning card game

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:19,080
Monsters in the Elevator and for the last 25 years I've been teaching. In

29
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,760
hindsight I can see that my early teaching career courses had a scope

30
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,760
problem. I started in Teach for America at a Baltimore school for students who

31
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,640
had dropped out and asked to return and being serious about education for the

32
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,800
first time many wanted as much as I could give them. So I taught

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,400
international dance and art alongside creative writing and literature and I

34
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,320
thought my job was to pack my courses to the limits of what they could manage.

35
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,880
When my classes got a reputation as the most demanding in the department the

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:55,880
department gave me the top students and this did not incline me to reduce scope.

37
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,920
And then at the Art Institutes my students were entirely dedicated to the

38
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,280
fields of games and animation and wanted everything I had to offer and my goal in

39
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,160
every course no matter how introductory was to maximize their portfolio output.

40
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,760
So in a just 10 week intro to 3D modeling course we would create full

41
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,440
portfolio ready photographic room interiors and two full high detailed

42
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,400
characters in an intro course. My students did not sleep. One student at

43
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,800
that time described my teaching style and this is a metaphor there was no

44
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,000
touching involved that I would grab them by the ears place my foot on their face

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,600
and knowledge. This approach seemed to be validated at Pixar Animation Studios

46
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,560
where I taught a workshop for the layout team in summer of 2005. I built a crazy

47
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,760
in-depth course and they tirelessly devoured everything I gave so eventually

48
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,960
I had to pry their fingers off the keyboards to get them to take a break.

49
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:03,400
I thought this is how to teach the subjects of animation and games. You

50
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,160
stuff the students until they burst.

51
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,440
But I changed priorities around 2011 when I started teaching at other

52
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,720
colleges where the students had many interests beyond my subjects. They did

53
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,360
not want everything I could give them so intro to 3D became more of a minimum

54
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,720
viable product to show competency. Just one hard surface and one organic object

55
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,560
and we animated using industry rigs and my classes no longer took over their

56
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,080
lives. The goals of my courses switched from massive portfolio content to

57
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,000
concept mastery and confidence building with small scoped projects so they felt

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,040
empowered to take the concepts further outside of the course if they chose. And

59
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,400
then Tufts happened. I casually emailed a friend in the Tufts computer science

60
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,400
department asking what are you folks doing with games and he invited me to

61
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,360
pitch the department. Now usually when I design curriculum for new game

62
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,560
development programs I follow a somewhat typical model with five or six courses.

63
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,920
There is tabletop game design to learn mechanics and how to organize humans

64
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,120
into playful experiences and level design where we learn a digital game

65
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,760
engine like Unity, a course on game environment arts, a course on programming

66
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,120
and prototyping their first small original digital game and then a

67
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,440
capstone semester or two on team production. And as mentioned in Ian's feedback

68
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:37,080
each topic is taught on its own to grow skills in that one area. So I suggested

69
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,960
this to my friend at Tufts, a multi-course curriculum in games in

70
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,760
their computer science department and he said how about you just try one class

71
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,720
and since it was for the computer science department they would expect it

72
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,480
to include a lot of programming. So I thought that's four game courses

73
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,840
stuffed into one class and that's already crazy so why not make it the

74
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,960
full five. In my interview with the CS department chair I did not emphasize

75
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,760
that my course would be five semesters of traditional game design education in

76
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,880
one term. I promised to teach her students how to think and plan before

77
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,320
they code and that they would experience a team software development pipeline and

78
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,360
she said yes. But it was made clear to me that this was an experiment and if the

79
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,000
course was not a big hit with the students it would not be repeated. This

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
crazy class had to work the first time and personally having spent a few years

81
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,360
making manageable courses after a decade of crazy scoped ones I wanted my

82
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,800
students to leave this course feeling fulfilled and happy and not burned out.

83
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,320
To do this I asked for teaching assistants to offer coding labs and a

84
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,640
flexible classroom that allowed us to move tables to switch between group work

85
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,680
and play testing and lecture. I built every single assignment around teamwork

86
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,320
to support student motivation and creativity but also to give every

87
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:06,080
student a net to catch them with each other and supportive lessons in

88
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,740
improving their teamwork. It wasn't just okay you know how to be teams because

89
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,320
you're humans. We would teach them how to work with each other. I built a robust

90
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,760
course website which offers clear expectations and resources, a detailed

91
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,120
weekly schedule and homework reminders, lecture notes, assignment rubrics,

92
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,880
tutorial videos to review the tools at their own pace, examples from past

93
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,960
students and sources for further learning. This site allows students to

94
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,840
see the full scope of the course and so feel some control over their experience.

95
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,560
This is at madwomb.com slash tufts. You are all welcome to take whatever you

96
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:51,200
want. Finally I used what I call stacking theory to structure the lessons.

97
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,400
Stacking theory understands that students only learn one thing well at a

98
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,600
time but proposes that if students only learn, whoops, proposes that if students

99
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,880
are exposed to more things in the same class meeting without deadline pressure

100
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:13,120
they can get curious and begin to absorb these others. Here is how the core topics

101
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,480
are stacked in this course. The class meets once a week for three hours. We

102
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,920
discuss and practice the one critical topic for that week's homework and you

103
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,760
can see the stars and introduce two to three other ideas or tool sets that will

104
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,560
be important later. So for example a month before anyone will need to make

105
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:38,320
anything in 3D for homework we start learning basic modeling and texturing. By

106
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,040
the time these concepts are needed for homework they have been explored

107
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,160
multiple times with room for confidence building success and opportunities for

108
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,040
wrong turns to be corrected which reduces stress and frustration. By the

109
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,920
time we reach final game production after midterms we've experienced most of

110
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,440
the tools needed to accomplish it. This is a high-level summary but we're about

111
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:11,280
to go into this in detail. So imagine with me a student, Samantha. Two weeks

112
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,320
before the term begins she gets a welcome email asking to share about

113
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,120
games she loves and because most of her classmates have not played modern board

114
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,280
games links to Wil Wheaton's tabletop show so they don't think we are just

115
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:28,440
talking about Candyland and Monopoly. The first six weeks focus on tabletop games

116
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,560
and the students work in two week teams. On day one we distinguish between

117
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,240
mechanics and story to focus on mechanics. Samantha forms a team with

118
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,000
three other students and designs a tabletop game inspired by weird boards

119
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and toys. They read from Jesse Schell's Art of Game Design and meet outside of

120
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,640
class to work on their game. Week two we practice playtesting their games to find

121
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,920
the fun and discuss radical revision to refocus around that fun. They meet outside

122
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,360
of class again to revise mechanics and story. One of my favorite examples of

123
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,960
this lesson interpreted this Tree of Life game board as an asymmetrical

124
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,720
combat between a computer antivirus and an invading AI and having used these

125
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,120
boards now for many many years it's amazing how we never get sick of what

126
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,040
they create as I'm sure many of you have discovered in your classes. Week three

127
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,160
Samantha forms a second two-week team and they are asked to disrupt an existing

128
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,440
game into something new and we get disruptions of everything from chess

129
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,600
and sorry to Uno and Duck Duck Goose. One of my favorite examples of this was

130
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,440
Sand Wizard of Catan. The desert is placed at the center when a player rolls

131
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,120
seven the robber does not move instead the player chooses one of the hexes

132
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:52,920
around the desert and flips the number disk so the desert spreads. At home

133
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,240
Samantha and her team read J. McGonigal's Reality is Broken and then we spend an

134
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,120
hour of week four brainstorming and presenting an alternate reality game to

135
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:10,040
solve a misery. With three hours of class time a week we take one hour on software

136
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,000
tools so weeks three and four they follow me in tutorials for Unity 3D and

137
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,420
2D projects where she learns to use scripting and physics and feedback to

138
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,360
make basic platformers and collection games. Week four she makes Rollaball the

139
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,200
Unity tutorial at home. My three TA start running code labs a few times a week so

140
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,080
Samantha can get help and learn more Unity tools. Week five Samantha forms her

141
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,880
third team to make a final tabletop project based on the routines of a

142
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,200
workplace and we get games about window washers and airline traffic controllers

143
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,200
and way too many baristas. Here you can see what was handed in just a couple

144
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,280
weeks ago of the current class the window washing game an asymmetrical game

145
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,600
where you're either the window washer trying to clean the windows or the

146
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,200
robber trying to hide the evidence of their past crimes and you're trying to

147
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:10,120
clean to catch them. Also week five I teach the basics of 3D Maya to Unity

148
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,320
pipeline and week six we learn about making Unity builds and VR tools and then

149
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,440
Sam's team gets one week until week seven to turn their workplace game

150
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:28,180
digital with a stated zero expectation of success. The point of that one week is

151
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,040
to just get in as much as they can and make as many mistakes as possible. A

152
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,060
previous class actually asked for this lesson to make a lot of mistakes on an

153
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,120
original game before the final project and it's been amazing in the years

154
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,520
since we've done this. Week seven Samantha's team shows off their first

155
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,600
original digital game and I'm always impressed by how much they actually get

156
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,460
working. Sam then gets a review of all design topics covered so far and is

157
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,420
encouraged to think of new ways to move and interact and to get playful with

158
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,400
visuals and premise. She then gets 30 minutes of walking around brainstorming

159
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,720
with her classmates with some silent reflection occasionally in that time.

160
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,880
Then everyone gets a white note card to write down their final idea and Sam

161
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,680
chooses a colored sticky note for the main production role she plans to

162
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:27,400
fulfill on the final project. Code, art, audio, or project management. Everyone

163
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:33,680
participates in design so these are just the production roles outside of design

164
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:41,680
concerns. Then Sam gets 45 seconds to stand up and pitch her idea to the class.

165
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,700
She tapes the white card with her idea to the wall and when all who want to

166
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,280
pitch have done so everyone votes with their colored sticky notes for the

167
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,440
project they want to make. This is the system the MIT game lab uses for the

168
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,200
global game jam and it's stolen wholeheartedly from them. In a class of

169
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,880
40 students we get around 30 pitches and make about eight games. I rebalance roles

170
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,480
if needed to make sure every group has programmers and artists and in this way

171
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,320
final teams are decided. If Sam's idea was chosen I remind her to expect it

172
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,400
will change dramatically in the process of iteration and testing and revision so

173
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:28,160
I advise let it go and trust the process and her new team. The teams then get in

174
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,280
the second half of the semester one week to draft a design doc and paper

175
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,280
prototypes for user stories and then one week to get as much of the game working

176
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,840
in Unity as they can. Two more weeks to complete a working prototype and then

177
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,400
three weeks to build that out to a fuller game with multiple levels and

178
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,160
more polished art and audio. We play test every week and significantly adjust the

179
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:58,680
game plan at least a few times per team. And during this latter half of the

180
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,440
semester Sam gets lessons in basic Photoshop and user interface and audio

181
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,480
composition and three weeks of level design. For two weeks at the very end we

182
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,240
discuss marketing and Sam and her team prepare a trailer and website while

183
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:17,320
still polishing their game. On the final week Sam and her team show off their

184
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,760
game to guests, eat pizza and then stand in front of everyone to present their

185
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,560
trailer and website and talk about their experiences making this game with each

186
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:35,000
other. This course stands on many shoulders. The game testing methodology

187
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,200
comes from the MIT game lab via Firehose Games along with the week 7 system for

188
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,840
choosing final teams. The first lesson in playful mechanics with bags of toys and

189
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,960
weird boards comes from Paul Skydema's design workshop at GDC back in 2003. I

190
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,160
owe Jenna Hofstein for our aspirational theory of game marketing. A level design

191
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,720
lesson on encounter building comes from Forrest Dowling of The Molasses Flood.

192
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,840
And the other is Ubisoft's concrete solution to difficulty curves called

193
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,920
rational game design which I learned from Alexis Jolie de Sautel and which we

194
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,280
use for tutorializing. We get our peer evaluation system from the executive MBA

195
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:22,240
program at Boston University. Jesse Schell's art of game design helps us

196
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,360
rethink mechanics and prototyping and Dr. McGonigal's reality is broken gives us

197
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,680
alternate reality games, our favorite definition of games, voluntary engagement

198
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,560
and unnecessary obstacles and our working definition of fun. What she calls

199
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,360
flow, a feeling like we can always make progress with every turn and what she

200
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:48,240
calls fear, frequent opportunities for accomplishment and excitement. We

201
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,920
discuss game success through this rubric. Clarity, do players know what to do?

202
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:01,120
Innovation, what new gameplay mechanics can stimulate interest? Immersion, is the

203
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,040
setting art and music compelling to imply story? Flow, does the player feel

204
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,920
constantly productive? And Fiero, are there multiple victory moments for the

205
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,280
players? We tell the students this scale is to evaluate the strength of the games

206
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,280
but their grade is as much for collaboration, experimentation and

207
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,080
risk-taking in design as it is about the games being successful as games. All the

208
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,240
tabletop games before midterms are just pass-fail. This takes the pressure off to

209
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,920
succeed in any specific way and helps them to have fun with each other which

210
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,960
is a lot of the goal in that first half. They're learning how to be teammates as

211
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,120
well as learning about games. There's still a lot I'm asking them to do, meet

212
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,520
with their teams outside of class each week, deliver a play testable game each

213
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,280
week, learn a large amount of content in multiple disciplines, strive for their

214
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,840
own definition of excellence but the mood every week is light and excited. The

215
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:58,360
students feel they can do it. We hold them accountable in four main ways

216
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,920
especially talking about them as teams. Each week we play their games for verbal

217
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:09,000
and typed feedback according to the rubric. They weekly post task divisions

218
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,200
in the beginning of the week to show an equal share production per member, there

219
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,600
were at least their intention of that equal share. After midterms each student

220
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,800
submits a weekly personal progress reports, one paragraph of screenshots,

221
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,320
what they agreed to take on that week, what they actually completed with no

222
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,720
penalty if it's different, who helped them, who they helped and links to

223
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,480
tutorials that they used. Three times a semester each student fills out a peer

224
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,120
evaluation form, that one from Boston University, where they discuss their

225
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,200
teammates contributions to productivity and morale and divide a pool of points

226
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,360
unevenly between their teammates. All of these evaluations are required but only

227
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,800
the very last one handed in on the very last day of class actually affects their

228
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:04,760
teammates grades, about 20% of the grade. To connect my students to the industry

229
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,920
each is expected to attend an off-campus networking event and write about it. I

230
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,520
maintain a website list of the large number of game industry events in the

231
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,240
Boston area at madwomb.com and they always find these experiences inspiring.

232
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,760
To further engage them with the industry just this year I added video lectures by

233
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,360
prominent game designers. Some are my personal heroes, some I actively disagree

234
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,000
with but it gets other voices into the room than my own and gets my students

235
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,520
thinking about who makes the games they love and to imagine themselves up there

236
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,280
inspiring others and you'll see that on the website at the bottom of each week, a

237
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:47,680
different link. I've taught this course nine times at Tufts and Harvard in the

238
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,480
last four years. I've seen it build students confidence and their ability to

239
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,480
create and work well with others and while they work hard I don't see them

240
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,680
burn out and everyone stays positively engaged about the term. I am so proud of

241
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,360
what our students create in this course. The games are always playable, often

242
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,540
beautiful and frequently downright weird. Here's a small sample of the 40 final

243
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,280
project games made in the course at Tufts. You can see the rest are linked

244
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,480
from the course website, every single one made in the course and I'd like to

245
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:27,040
briefly talk about one game. Displaced is one of my all-time favorites, created the

246
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,200
very first semester I taught this course and I love it in part because I was dead

247
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,200
sure it would not work. The original pitch was for a game where the player

248
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,680
gets worse at playing the game the more they play it. This sounded terrible to me.

249
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,800
Players want to grow in mastery, this would yield poor flow and Fiero but they

250
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,400
stuck to their guns and made an amazing platformer about self-doubt and

251
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,360
isolation and empathy where we play a blob accidentally absorbing junk

252
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,760
streams around the level growing in size and weight as they absorb it so we move

253
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,880
slower and jump less high to avoid the many red monsters and death traps. The

254
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,720
mechanic and theme work so well together and the levels were tuned with

255
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:17,200
exceptional care. I tell every class since then about this game to let them

256
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:25,460
know to always listen to my advice except when they shouldn't. And I think I

257
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,200
have enough time to actually show you the trailer for that game.

258
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:55,240
Oh, you can't see anything. Hmm. Now it got complicated. If I do this. Nope.

259
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:01,160
Sorry, I don't know how to do that. I can show it to you after if you want to come up.

260
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:10,200
So I will simply resume. The first time I taught this course at Tufts after final

261
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,840
day presentations dozens of students lined up to thank us. In course

262
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,360
evaluations multiple students said it was one of their favorite experiences

263
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,080
in college. They loved the teamwork and the chance to push themselves in new

264
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,400
directions. The course offers them massive amounts of flow and Fiero. They

265
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,400
feel able to be productive each week and feel their efforts rewarded in play

266
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,960
testing. We include in this course much of what makes game development such an

267
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,440
amazing and ridiculous experience. They are hungry for every bit of it and it is

268
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:46,720
such a joy to serve as the teacher of this crazy pants circus of a course. And

269
00:22:46,720 --> 00:23:00,600
I will take any questions. I wonder if while I take questions if maybe someone

270
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,840
can come up and figure out how to get the trailer to be visible on that

271
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:10,880
screen because it is really fun. I have a question. My question relates to what

272
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,400
experience level are your students coming in at because I have a sort of

273
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:21,120
intro survey class and at week five I'm still trying to teach them how to unzip

274
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,920
a file. So I'm just wondering are they more advanced in sort of their technical

275
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:33,160
skills or are they fully freshmen? Yeah so at Tufts I'm teaching in the CS

276
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,160
department. They are very they're already programmers. They may not know C sharp

277
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,520
and they certainly need to have explained to them how Unity doesn't have

278
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,560
them create one big wall of code to run their game that they're doing smaller

279
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,040
bits of code that are associated with objects. So we try to catch where they're

280
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,120
likely to get tripped up and stuck but we're not teaching them a lot of the

281
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,000
basics of the tech. Interestingly about a quarter of the class this semester for

282
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,800
the first time now that Tufts has absorbed the School of the Museum of

283
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Fine Arts a quarter of the class is from the SMFA and there are students there

284
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:14,720
who are not particularly technologically strong. They are metal welders. They are

285
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,360
artists in a variety of fields now excited to try this new thing and we've

286
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,880
had to adjust our thinking in some ways to make sure that they have what they

287
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,000
need. Fortunately they're avid oh that is the other one. Fortunately they're avid

288
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,520
YouTube watchers and so creating something of a flipped classroom

289
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,720
paradigm where I'll show something in class but then record a video of it and

290
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,000
send that to them so they could try it again at home as many times they need to

291
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,320
to get it helps. At Harvard it's a huge variety of students but I usually have

292
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,240
at least a couple who are technologically strong who can carry

293
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,840
the programming side. I'm encouraging really weird and strange and wild art

294
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,560
make bottle caps to stop motion with lint. Try things that anybody can do with

295
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,200
their cell phone. You don't have to be good at Photoshop. I just showed them

296
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,280
enough to cut things out so they're usually able to move forward with that

297
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:14,800
and everybody does really well when it comes to design. Did that answer?

298
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Hi. Oh. Okay.

299
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
The AV just trolled us.

300
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
It's fine.

301
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Thank you very much. Please continue.

302
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Yeah. Thank you very much for the talk.

303
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Just a question that might be either not really relevant or a longer conversation.

304
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:50,800
So I teach in a university in Toronto and not the University of Toronto

305
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,800
but I teach in a university in Toronto and one of the thing is we have a little bit

306
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,800
more flexibility like the three classes not one but not too much and one of the

307
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:06,800
thing I struggle with is coming from something who came from art school first

308
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,800
is the idea is the structure of the way the class is organized where there is an

309
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:16,800
hour and a half lecture and then two hour lab and it's really yeah it's really

310
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,800
hard to sort of have the flexibility of for example having an hour of like a

311
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:30,800
technical thing and I'm just wondering if you had any thought or experience in

312
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:36,800
like how to use your structure because I'm very much a big fan of sort of the

313
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,800
experimental motivation thing because I also teach 3D and I do that a lot but is

314
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,800
there a way to sort of mitigate that structure in a way that I can still do

315
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:56,800
that lecture and then lab but still have it more flexible more sure yeah are you

316
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,800
saying that the school is requiring you to follow that structure yeah that's the

317
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,800
structure of the class okay I would hope or assume that that's in order for the

318
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,800
students to feel like they have a reliable sense of how the class is going

319
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:12,800
to go it's also university thing I think so I try not to talk for more than

320
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:19,800
usually about 10 minutes before I have the students do something who's a

321
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,800
gardener gardeners the multiple intelligences are you familiar with that

322
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,800
that idea it's something they drilled into us and teach for America the idea

323
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,800
of that there are different ways to learn in different ways to be smart and

324
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,800
there's kinesthetic and bodily and there's an understanding of nature it's

325
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,800
not just being able to function in a lecture hall so getting the students up

326
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,800
and moving getting them using rhythm getting them interacting with each other

327
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,800
because of the interpersonal versus the interpersonal makes a big difference

328
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,800
there are a lot of ways to get them to interact with each other and sometimes

329
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,800
it's just discuss this idea and come up with an idea I'm also a volunteer here

330
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,800
as a CA I've been doing that for 18 years and I got to run a breakout

331
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:04,800
session last night where the the way that I handled the get to know you part

332
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,800
the icebreaker is I just ran one of these lessons a five-minute version I

333
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:13,800
had them try to come up with a game that was based on the routines of a workplace

334
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,800
and it got them thinking and got them playing we only had one or two ideas

335
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,800
that were shareable they just went off in other conversations but the they get

336
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,800
so much more out of talking to each other often than listening to me so I

337
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,800
just talk enough to give them the core ideas and then try to get them running

338
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,800
so I would hope that in that lecture scenario there's the opportunity to have

339
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,800
them turn to each other even if there isn't the idea that they are going to go

340
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,800
off and do their own thing but I would advise trying to break it up yeah an

341
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,800
hour for this of the teacher talking to me is pretty deadly yeah hi great talk

342
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:55,800
very much I run a program at a small college in upstate New York and I run

343
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,800
into a lot of the same issues that you kind of fit have all this content to fit

344
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:05,800
into so many courses but I was wondering if you could you I saw you had peer

345
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,800
evaluations towards the later end and what do you like I have my particular

346
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,800
methodologies of how to deal with problem teams or like the one student

347
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:21,800
that's you know or everyone is like gang and so how do you deal with intergroup

348
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:28,800
intra group conflicts in this sort of course so one thing that we do is we

349
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,800
talk in the very beginning of the semester about what we're here for and

350
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,800
I'm certainly fortunate that I'm teaching at the moment at Tufts and at

351
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Harvard and I've got students who for the most part are are very much there to

352
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:44,800
learn and have self-selected out some of the the issues that we sometimes see but

353
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,800
we certainly get conflicts and we certainly get students who are making

354
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,800
wrong choices artists have a tendency to not want to hand in their stuff each

355
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,800
week it's their precious they don't want to let it release and it's hard to get

356
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,800
them to put in zero drafts crap drafts of the work just so we can get things

357
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,800
functioning in the game I have a lesson that talks about that acknowledges that

358
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,800
feeling and hopefully helps them get past it a little bit so we do a lesson

359
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
on I messages where we talk about how to speak to each other if you're

360
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:20,800
struggling about something we do a lesson on how do we optimize each other

361
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,800
talking to each other about the ways in which we can feel best treated and

362
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,800
hopefully establishing there for some ground rules in these lessons in these

363
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,800
teams for what we're expecting from each other we have another lesson when I'm

364
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:40,800
able to fit into the semester of playing witch hunt mafia just had experienced

365
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,800
the triangulation and that can be fun the first semester we did this and the

366
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,800
department chair who had approved the class came down and played with us she

367
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:53,800
was a witch and I make myself very available to the students I'm checking

368
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,800
in they are reporting on each other with these peer evaluations the peer

369
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:04,800
evaluations ask for main questions what is this student doing well in terms of

370
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,800
productivity what do you wish they were doing better or more of how is the

371
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,800
student doing in terms of contributing to team morale what do you wish they're

372
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,800
doing more of and then I give them some concrete numbers rate their

373
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,800
productivity and the morale each in a score of one to ten all of which is just

374
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,800
to help narrow them into a sense of how is this person doing they do that for

375
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,800
all their teammates and they get a pool of numbers that is if they've got three

376
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,800
teammates it's 30 points and they have to decide unevenly who gets what and it's

377
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,800
just to help them make a judgment call it's just so they don't take the cop out

378
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:41,800
of you all get tens and it helps them just to make concrete to put into words

379
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,800
what they are feeling what they're thinking so they don't let it go and I

380
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,800
also tell them early on that the stakes for these conversations in this class

381
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,800
are so low they're gonna go out to the world they're gonna have a job they care

382
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,800
about and having this conversation with the manager or co-worker is gonna feel

383
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,800
like it's the end of the world do it here mess up these relationships it's

384
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,800
okay we can take it it's only one semester I'll help you through it and

385
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,800
ask them to try to have those conversations the evaluations are

386
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:12,800
anonymous but I encourage them I see them and if I really need to I'll talk

387
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,800
to a student not with the specific of who said what's but help them to

388
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,800
understand how they might be being perceived but it's also meant to be an

389
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,800
opportunity for them to talk to each other so they will hopefully take that

390
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,800
and go okay I'm ready to have a conversation and hopefully use the I

391
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:32,800
message system to get behind the person's possible defensiveness I think

392
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,800
you have time we are at time I will stay as long as you want because I am

393
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,800
delighted to meet you all thank you so much for being here
