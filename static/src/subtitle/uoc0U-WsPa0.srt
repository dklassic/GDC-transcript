1
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,802
My name is Jason Weiser, and for the last four years,

2
00:00:09,063 --> 00:00:13,707
I've been teaching a crazy pants course at Tufts University called Game Design,

3
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:19,452
which is actually tabletop game design, alternate reality game design,

4
00:00:19,592 --> 00:00:23,076
game testing, introduction to the Unity game engine and C-sharp programming,

5
00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:26,999
intro to 3D art and animation, intro to 2D art and UI,

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,244
intro to audio for games, paper prototyping, level design, including rational game design.

7
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:38,406
And encounter building, VR tools and considerations, team building and communication, digital game

8
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:42,451
prototyping, pipeline development, modes of team management, marketing, industry networking,

9
00:00:43,012 --> 00:00:43,432
and more.

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,901
This past fall, I described this course to the excellent Mr. Ian Schreiber, who's on

11
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:55,821
the board of the Education Summit, and his response boiled down to, this course of yours

12
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:58,162
breaks all the rules I know for game education.

13
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:02,863
I always tell people to learn one thing at a time, otherwise you're going to end up frustrated

14
00:01:02,883 --> 00:01:05,903
with a doomed project, and yet you just mash it all together and go.

15
00:01:06,543 --> 00:01:08,864
In my head, I can't imagine how this could possibly work.

16
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:13,765
Do you ever get any decent quality games out of the class, or is it 100% train wrecks and

17
00:01:13,785 --> 00:01:14,465
learning by failure?

18
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:19,989
I'm not doing a particularly good Ian imitation, but in other words,

19
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:23,892
who would ever want to take this circus and who would ever want to teach it?

20
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:32,072
And I said to him, actually, all the projects succeed as engaging and playable prototypes,

21
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:35,634
and many are really original, and some have gone on to be published on the Steam and the

22
00:01:35,714 --> 00:01:36,094
App Stores.

23
00:01:36,754 --> 00:01:40,335
And then last month, he asked me to deliver a talk where I prove this can work in front

24
00:01:40,355 --> 00:01:41,155
of hundreds of people.

25
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:43,716
And, in fact, we got a couple hundred of you.

26
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:44,596
So here we are.

27
00:01:45,817 --> 00:01:46,577
Thank you for being here.

28
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:49,678
I should mention a couple of things.

29
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:52,239
Please turn off your audio devices.

30
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:56,680
And when you get your eval thingy, please fill out the eval thingy.

31
00:01:58,866 --> 00:02:01,950
So a bit of background, I'm an animator and game designer and educator.

32
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,314
I animate for games and museums and robots and television.

33
00:02:06,936 --> 00:02:10,420
And I'm the creative director of Yaya Play Games, where I design stuff with my daughter,

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,543
including the award-winning card game Monsters in the Elevator.

35
00:02:16,707 --> 00:02:18,629
And for the last 25 years, I've been teaching.

36
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:24,375
In hindsight, I can see that my early teaching career courses had a scope problem.

37
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:28,982
I started in Teach for America at a Baltimore school for students who had dropped out and

38
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:30,143
asked to return.

39
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:35,498
And being serious about education for the first time, many wanted as much as I could

40
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:35,859
give them.

41
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:40,801
So I taught international dance and art alongside creative writing and literature.

42
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:45,503
And I thought my job was to pack my courses to the limit of what they could manage.

43
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:50,426
When my classes got a reputation as the most demanding in the department, the department

44
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:51,486
gave me the top students.

45
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:54,008
And this did not incline me to reduce scope.

46
00:02:57,296 --> 00:03:01,757
And then at the Art Institutes, my students were entirely dedicated to the fields of games

47
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:04,157
and animation and wanted everything I had to offer.

48
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:09,879
And my goal in every course, no matter how introductory, was to maximize their portfolio

49
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:10,319
output.

50
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,900
So, in a just 10-week intro to 3D modeling course, we would create full portfolio-ready

51
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,301
photographic room interiors and two full high-detailed characters in an intro course.

52
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:24,207
My students did not sleep.

53
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:29,933
One student at that time described my teaching style, and this is a metaphor, there was no

54
00:03:29,994 --> 00:03:35,220
touching involved, that I would grab them by the ears, place my foot on their face,

55
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,601
and knowledge!

56
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:43,779
This approach seemed to be validated at Pixar Animation Studios,

57
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:46,420
where I taught a workshop for the layout team in summer of 2005.

58
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,601
I built a crazy in-depth course,

59
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:52,642
and they tirelessly devoured everything I gave.

60
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:55,864
So eventually I had to pry their fingers off the keyboards

61
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:56,864
to get them to take a break.

62
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:02,867
I thought, this is how to teach the subjects of animation and games.

63
00:04:03,387 --> 00:04:05,228
You stuff the students until they burst.

64
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,322
But I changed priorities around 2011 when I started teaching at other colleges where

65
00:04:14,342 --> 00:04:16,842
the students had many interests beyond my subjects.

66
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:19,443
They did not want everything I could give them.

67
00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:24,824
So Intro to 3D became more of a minimum viable product to show competency.

68
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,805
Just one hard surface and one organic object.

69
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:33,007
And we animated using industry rigs, and my classes no longer took over their lives.

70
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:39,188
The goals of my courses switched from massive portfolio content to concept mastery and confidence

71
00:04:39,248 --> 00:04:41,129
building with small scoped projects.

72
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:45,970
So they felt empowered to take the concepts further outside of the course if they chose.

73
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:49,891
And then Tufts happened.

74
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:55,633
I casually emailed a friend in the Tufts computer science department asking, what are you folks

75
00:04:55,673 --> 00:04:56,313
doing with games?

76
00:04:59,744 --> 00:05:01,328
And he invited me to pitch the department.

77
00:05:03,492 --> 00:05:06,398
Now usually when I design curriculum for new game development programs,

78
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,845
I follow a somewhat typical model with five or six courses.

79
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:15,295
There is tabletop game design to learn mechanics and how to organize humans into playful experiences.

80
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:20,977
And level design where we learn a digital game engine like Unity, a course on game environment

81
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:26,059
art, a course on programming and prototyping, their first small original digital game, and

82
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,520
then a capstone semester or two on team production.

83
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,122
And as mentioned in Ian's feedback, each topic is taught on its own to grow skills in that

84
00:05:34,282 --> 00:05:34,822
one area.

85
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:40,288
I suggested this to my friend at Tufts, a multi-course curriculum in games in their

86
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:44,010
computer science department, and he said, how about you just try one class?

87
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,292
And since it was for the computer science department, they would expect it to include

88
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:49,072
a lot of programming.

89
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:56,455
So I thought, that's four game courses stuffed into one class, and that's already crazy,

90
00:05:56,915 --> 00:05:58,436
so why not make it the full five?

91
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:05,199
In my interview with the CS department chair, I did not emphasize that my course would be

92
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:08,380
five semesters of traditional game design education in one term.

93
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,741
I promised to teach her students how to think and plan before they code, and that they would

94
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:16,261
experience a team software development pipeline.

95
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:17,461
And she said yes.

96
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:23,222
But it was made clear to me that this was an experiment, and if the course was not a

97
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:25,523
big hit with the students, it would not be repeated.

98
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:28,443
This crazy class had to work the first time.

99
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:32,771
And personally, having spent a few years making manageable courses

100
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:35,876
after a decade of crazy scoped ones, I wanted my students

101
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:40,302
to leave this course feeling fulfilled and happy and not burned out.

102
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:47,535
To do this, I asked for teaching assistance to offer coding labs and a flexible classroom

103
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:52,377
that allowed us to move tables to switch between group work and play testing and lecture.

104
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:57,959
I built every single assignment around teamwork to support student motivation and creativity,

105
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,941
but also to give every student a net to catch them.

106
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:07,370
with each other and supportive lessons in improving their teamwork.

107
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,982
It wasn't just, okay, you know how to be teams because you're humans. We would teach them how to work with each other.

108
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,963
I built a robust course website which offers clear expectations and resources, a detailed

109
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:25,146
weekly schedule and homework reminders, lecture notes, assignment rubrics, tutorial videos

110
00:07:25,186 --> 00:07:29,548
to review the tools at their own pace, examples from past students, and sources for further

111
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:29,868
learning.

112
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:35,912
This site allows students to see the full scope of the course and so feel some control

113
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:37,012
over their experience.

114
00:07:37,553 --> 00:07:39,754
This is at madwomb.com slash tufts.

115
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:41,855
You are all welcome to take whatever you want.

116
00:07:45,305 --> 00:07:50,027
Finally, I used what I call stacking theory to structure the lessons.

117
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:56,991
Stacking theory understands that students only learn one thing well at a time,

118
00:07:57,451 --> 00:08:03,554
but proposes that if students only learn, oops, proposes that if students are exposed

119
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:07,176
to more things in the same class meeting without deadline pressure,

120
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:10,958
they can get curious and begin to absorb these others.

121
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,540
Here is how the core topics are stacked in this course.

122
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:18,998
The class meets once a week for three hours.

123
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:21,660
We discuss and practice the one critical topic

124
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,921
for that week's homework, and you can see the stars,

125
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:27,603
and introduce two to three other ideas or tool sets

126
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:28,684
that will be important later.

127
00:08:28,804 --> 00:08:31,346
So for example, a month before anyone will need

128
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,307
to make anything in 3D for homework,

129
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,728
we start learning basic modeling and texturing.

130
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,391
By the time these concepts are needed for homework,

131
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:42,032
they have been explored multiple times

132
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:43,693
with room for confidence building success.

133
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:47,104
and opportunities for wrong turns to be corrected,

134
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:49,325
which reduces stress and frustration.

135
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:53,346
By the time we reach final game production after midterms,

136
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:56,668
we've experienced most of the tools needed to accomplish it.

137
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:00,109
This is a high-level summary,

138
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:01,610
but we're about to go into this in detail.

139
00:09:07,532 --> 00:09:09,613
So imagine with me a student, Samantha.

140
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:15,791
Two weeks before the term begins, she gets a welcome email asking to share about games

141
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:19,915
she loves and, because most of her classmates have not played modern board games, links

142
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:23,478
to Wil Wheaton's tabletop show so they don't think we are just talking about Candyland

143
00:09:23,518 --> 00:09:24,078
and Monopoly.

144
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,185
The first six weeks focus on tabletop games and the students work in two-week teams.

145
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:36,188
On day one, we distinguish between mechanics and story to focus on mechanics.

146
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:41,732
Samantha forms a team with three other students and designs a tabletop game inspired by weird

147
00:09:41,772 --> 00:09:42,633
boards and toys.

148
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:47,216
They read from Jesse Schell's Art of Game Design and meet outside of class to work on

149
00:09:47,257 --> 00:09:47,677
their game.

150
00:09:50,219 --> 00:09:55,023
Week two, we practice playtesting their games to find the fun and discuss radical revision

151
00:09:55,063 --> 00:09:56,664
to refocus around that fun.

152
00:09:57,324 --> 00:10:00,347
They meet outside of class again to revise mechanics and story.

153
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,134
One of my favorite examples of this lesson

154
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:05,837
interpreted this Tree of Life game board

155
00:10:06,057 --> 00:10:09,059
as an asymmetrical combat between a computer antivirus

156
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,560
and an invading AI.

157
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:13,363
And having used these boards now for many, many years,

158
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,645
it's amazing how we never get sick of what they create,

159
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,528
as I'm sure many of you have discovered in your classes.

160
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,092
Week three, Samantha forms a second two-week team,

161
00:10:25,532 --> 00:10:27,533
and they are asked to disrupt an existing game

162
00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:28,334
into something new.

163
00:10:28,774 --> 00:10:30,075
And we get disruptions of everything

164
00:10:30,115 --> 00:10:32,517
from chess and sari to uno and duck-duck goose.

165
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:35,959
One of my favorite examples of this was Sand Wizard of Catan.

166
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:38,200
The desert is placed at the center.

167
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:41,422
When a player rolls seven, the robber does not move.

168
00:10:42,043 --> 00:10:44,264
Instead, the player chooses one of the hexes

169
00:10:44,284 --> 00:10:46,385
around the desert and flips the number disk

170
00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:47,906
so the desert spreads.

171
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:57,741
At home, Samantha and her team read J. McGonigal's Reality is Broken, and then we spend an hour

172
00:10:57,801 --> 00:11:03,507
of week four brainstorming and presenting an alternate reality game to solve a misery.

173
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:10,550
With three hours of class time a week, we take one hour on software tools.

174
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,834
So weeks three and four, they follow me in tutorials for Unity 3D and 2D projects,

175
00:11:16,214 --> 00:11:19,357
where she learns to use scripting and physics and feedback

176
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,879
to make basic platformers and collection games.

177
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:25,862
Week four, she makes Rollaball, the Unity tutorial at home.

178
00:11:26,383 --> 00:11:29,085
My three TAs start running Codelabs a few times a week,

179
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:31,907
so Samantha can get help and learn more Unity tools.

180
00:11:33,415 --> 00:11:39,056
Week five, Samantha forms her third team to make a final tabletop project based on the

181
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:40,517
routines of a workplace.

182
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:46,218
And we get games about window washers and airline traffic controllers and way too many

183
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:46,759
baristas.

184
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:53,160
Here you can see what was handed in just a couple weeks ago of the current class, the

185
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:57,542
window washing game, an asymmetrical game where you're either the window washer trying

186
00:11:57,562 --> 00:12:01,263
to clean the windows or the robber trying to hide the evidence of their past crimes

187
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,123
and you're trying to clean to catch them.

188
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:10,705
Also week five, I teach the basics of 3D Maya to Unity pipeline.

189
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:14,707
And week six, we learn about making Unity builds and VR tools.

190
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:21,470
And then Sam's team gets one week, until week seven, to turn their workplace game digital.

191
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,911
With a stated zero expectation of success.

192
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:31,321
The point of that one week is to just get in as much as they can and make as many mistakes

193
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:31,961
as possible.

194
00:12:32,341 --> 00:12:38,084
A previous class actually asked for this lesson, to make a lot of mistakes on an original game

195
00:12:38,284 --> 00:12:39,685
before the final project.

196
00:12:40,906 --> 00:12:42,827
And it's been amazing in the years since we've done this.

197
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:49,971
Week seven, Samantha's team shows off their first original digital game, and I'm always

198
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:52,012
impressed by how much they actually get working.

199
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:58,422
Sam then gets a review of all design topics covered so far and is encouraged to think

200
00:12:58,462 --> 00:13:02,485
of new ways to move and interact and to get playful with visuals and premise.

201
00:13:03,406 --> 00:13:08,349
She then gets 30 minutes of walking around brainstorming with her classmates with some

202
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:10,671
silent reflection occasionally in that time.

203
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:15,971
Then everyone gets a white note card to write down their final idea,

204
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:20,193
and Sam chooses a colored sticky note for the main production role

205
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:22,314
she plans to fulfill on the final project.

206
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:26,196
Code, art, audio, or project management.

207
00:13:27,017 --> 00:13:28,878
Everyone participates in design.

208
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:34,641
So these are just the production roles outside of design concerns.

209
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:41,935
Then Sam gets 45 seconds to stand up and pitch her idea to the class.

210
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:47,218
She tapes the white card with her idea to the wall, and when all who want to pitch have

211
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:51,200
done so, everyone votes with their colored sticky notes for the project they want to

212
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,420
make.

213
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:57,344
This is the system the MIT Game Lab uses for the Global Game Jam, and it's stolen wholeheartedly

214
00:13:57,384 --> 00:13:57,644
from them.

215
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:03,100
In a class of 40 students, we get around 30 pitches and make about 8 games.

216
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:08,143
I rebalance roles if needed to make sure every group has programmers and artists, and in

217
00:14:08,183 --> 00:14:10,344
this way, final teams are decided.

218
00:14:11,124 --> 00:14:15,767
If Sam's idea was chosen, I remind her to expect it will change dramatically in the

219
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:21,069
process of iteration and testing and revision, so I advise let it go and trust the process

220
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,790
and her new team.

221
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,570
The teams then get, in the second half of the semester,

222
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,011
one week to draft a design doc and paper prototypes

223
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:35,812
for user stories, and then one week

224
00:14:35,852 --> 00:14:38,473
to get as much of the game working in Unity as they can,

225
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,974
two more weeks to complete a working prototype,

226
00:14:42,694 --> 00:14:44,274
and then three weeks to build that out

227
00:14:44,354 --> 00:14:46,655
to a fuller game with multiple levels and more

228
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:47,795
polished art and audio.

229
00:14:48,315 --> 00:14:51,496
We play test every week and significantly adjust the game

230
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:53,377
plan at least a few times per team.

231
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,306
And during this latter half of the semester,

232
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:01,186
Sam gets lessons in basic Photoshop,

233
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:03,167
and user interface, and audio composition,

234
00:15:03,547 --> 00:15:04,987
and three weeks of level design.

235
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,428
For two weeks, at the very end, we discuss marketing,

236
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:11,168
and Sam and her team prepare a trailer and website

237
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:12,509
while still polishing their game.

238
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:16,810
On the final week, Sam and her team

239
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,590
show off their game to guests, eat pizza,

240
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,230
and then stand in front of everyone

241
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,771
to present their trailer and website

242
00:15:22,831 --> 00:15:24,291
and talk about their experiences

243
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:25,932
making this game with each other.

244
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,940
This course stands on many shoulders.

245
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,622
The game testing methodology comes from the MIT Game Lab

246
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:39,124
via Firehose Games, along with the Week 7 system

247
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:40,245
for choosing final teams.

248
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:42,827
The first lesson in playful mechanics

249
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:44,568
with bags of toys and weird boards

250
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:48,851
comes from Paul Skydema's design workshop at GDC back in 2003.

251
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:52,193
I owe Jenna Hofstein for our aspirational theory

252
00:15:52,313 --> 00:15:53,074
of game marketing.

253
00:15:53,574 --> 00:15:55,796
A level design lesson on encounter building

254
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:58,818
comes from Forrest Dowling of The Molasses Flood.

255
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:05,699
And the other is Ubisoft's concrete solution to difficulty curves called Rational Game

256
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:11,185
Design, which I learned from Alexis Jolie-Desautels, and which we use for tutorializing.

257
00:16:12,026 --> 00:16:16,991
We get our peer evaluation system from the Executive MBA program at Boston University.

258
00:16:19,473 --> 00:16:24,355
Jesse Schell's art of game design helps us rethink mechanics and prototyping, and Dr.

259
00:16:24,395 --> 00:16:29,236
McGonigal's Reality is Broken gives us alternate reality games, our favorite definition of

260
00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:33,997
games, voluntary engagement and unnecessary obstacles, and our working definition of fun.

261
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:40,139
What she calls flow, a feeling like we can always make progress with every turn, and

262
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:44,080
what she calls Fiero, frequent opportunities for accomplishment and excitement.

263
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:50,954
We discuss game success through this rubric.

264
00:16:52,276 --> 00:16:54,618
Clarity, do players know what to do?

265
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:59,022
Innovation, what new gameplay mechanics can stimulate interest?

266
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:04,548
Immersion, is the setting, art, and music compelling to imply story?

267
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:08,010
Flow, does the player feel constantly productive?

268
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,373
And Fiero, are there multiple victory moments for the players?

269
00:17:11,193 --> 00:17:12,855
We tell the students, this scale is

270
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:14,537
to evaluate the strength of the games.

271
00:17:15,137 --> 00:17:18,241
But their grade is as much for collaboration, experimentation,

272
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:20,563
and risk taking in design as it is about the games

273
00:17:20,603 --> 00:17:22,125
being successful as games.

274
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:25,668
All the tabletop games before midterms are just pass fail.

275
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,829
This takes the pressure off to succeed in any specific way

276
00:17:29,189 --> 00:17:30,789
and helps them to have fun with each other,

277
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:32,970
which is a lot of the goal in that first half.

278
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,850
They're learning how to be teammates,

279
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,390
as well as learning about games.

280
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,711
There's still a lot I'm asking them to do.

281
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:41,911
Meet with their teams outside of class each week,

282
00:17:41,971 --> 00:17:43,912
deliver a play-testable game each week,

283
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:46,732
learn a large amount of content in multiple disciplines,

284
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:49,273
strive for their own definition of excellence,

285
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:52,493
but the mood every week is light and excited.

286
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,233
The students feel they can do it.

287
00:17:56,201 --> 00:18:01,382
We hold them accountable in four main ways, especially talking about them as teams.

288
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:06,103
Each week we play their games for verbal and typed feedback according to the rubric.

289
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:13,405
They weekly post task divisions in the beginning of the week to show an equal share production

290
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:16,325
per member, or at least their intention of that equal share.

291
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:22,807
After midterms, each student submits a weekly personal progress report, one paragraph of

292
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:25,127
what they agreed to take on that week.

293
00:18:26,012 --> 00:18:32,198
what they actually completed, with no penalty if it's different, who helped them, who they

294
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:34,941
helped, and links to tutorials that they used.

295
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:40,446
Three times a semester, each student fills out a peer evaluation form, that one from

296
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:45,591
Boston University, where they discuss their teammates' contributions to productivity and

297
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:50,096
morale and divide a pool of points unevenly between their teammates.

298
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:54,401
All of these evaluations are required, but only the very last one,

299
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,262
handed in on the very last day of class,

300
00:18:56,822 --> 00:18:58,703
actually affects their teammates' grades,

301
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:00,704
about 20% of the grade.

302
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,887
To connect my students to the industry,

303
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:08,028
each is expected to attend an off-campus networking event

304
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:08,789
and write about it.

305
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:12,411
I maintain a website list of the large number of game industry events

306
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,592
in the Boston area at madwomb.com,

307
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,333
and they always find these experiences inspiring.

308
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:21,158
To further engage him with the industry, just this year,

309
00:19:21,178 --> 00:19:23,979
I added video lectures by prominent game designers.

310
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:27,640
Some are my personal heroes, some I actively disagree with,

311
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,681
but it gets other voices into the room than my own

312
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:33,422
and gets my students thinking about who makes the games

313
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:35,663
they love and to imagine themselves up there,

314
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:36,703
inspiring others.

315
00:19:37,904 --> 00:19:39,624
And you'll see that on the website at the bottom

316
00:19:39,644 --> 00:19:41,085
of each week, a different link.

317
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:48,587
I've taught this course nine times at Tufts and Harvard in the last four years.

318
00:19:49,828 --> 00:19:53,971
I've seen it build students' confidence and their ability to create and work well with

319
00:19:54,031 --> 00:20:00,096
others and while they work hard, I don't see them burn out and everyone stays positively

320
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:01,257
engaged throughout the term.

321
00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:04,120
I am so proud of what our students create in this course.

322
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,543
The games are always playable, often beautiful, and frequently downright weird.

323
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:13,451
Here's a small sample of the 40 final project games made in the course at Tufts.

324
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:16,234
You can see the rest are linked from the course website,

325
00:20:16,274 --> 00:20:17,515
every single one made in the course.

326
00:20:18,096 --> 00:20:20,037
And I'd like to briefly talk about one game.

327
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:26,564
Displaced is one of my all-time favorites,

328
00:20:26,764 --> 00:20:29,286
created the very first semester I taught this course.

329
00:20:30,247 --> 00:20:33,570
And I love it in part because I was dead sure it would not work.

330
00:20:34,627 --> 00:20:39,792
The original pitch was for a game where the player gets worse at playing the game the

331
00:20:39,832 --> 00:20:40,493
more they play it.

332
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:43,376
This sounded terrible to me.

333
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,350
Players want to grow in mastery.

334
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:51,871
This would yield poor flow in Fiero, but they stuck to their guns and made an amazing platformer

335
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:58,173
about self-doubt and isolation and empathy, where we play a blob accidentally absorbing

336
00:20:58,253 --> 00:21:03,435
junk strewn around the level, growing in size and weight as they absorb it, so we move slower

337
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:06,616
and jump less high to avoid the many red monsters and death traps.

338
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:10,622
The mechanic and theme work so well together,

339
00:21:10,742 --> 00:21:12,803
and the levels were tuned with exceptional care.

340
00:21:13,164 --> 00:21:16,425
I tell every class since then about this game

341
00:21:16,886 --> 00:21:19,347
to let them know to always listen to my advice,

342
00:21:19,867 --> 00:21:20,828
except when they shouldn't.

343
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,451
And I think I have enough time to actually show you

344
00:21:27,471 --> 00:21:28,332
the trailer for that game.

345
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,380
Oh, you can't see anything.

346
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:43,222
Hmm.

347
00:21:44,482 --> 00:21:45,403
Now it got complicated.

348
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:50,026
If I do this...

349
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:54,330
Nope.

350
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:55,450
Sorry.

351
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,012
I don't know how to do that.

352
00:21:58,713 --> 00:21:59,914
I can show it to you after if you want to come up.

353
00:22:02,095 --> 00:22:03,016
So I will simply resume.

354
00:22:07,189 --> 00:22:11,998
The first time I taught this course at Tufts, after final day presentations, dozens of students

355
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:12,959
lined up to thank us.

356
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:17,547
In course evaluations, multiple students said it was one of their favorite experiences in

357
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:17,908
college.

358
00:22:18,563 --> 00:22:21,724
They love the teamwork and the chance to push themselves in new directions.

359
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:25,005
The course offers them massive amounts of flow and Fiero.

360
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:28,005
They feel able to be productive each week and

361
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:29,966
feel their efforts rewarded in play testing.

362
00:22:30,606 --> 00:22:35,668
We include in this course much of what makes game development such an amazing and

363
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:36,788
ridiculous experience.

364
00:22:37,368 --> 00:22:38,708
They are hungry for every bit of it.

365
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:43,410
And it is such a joy to serve as a teacher of this crazy pants circus of a course.

366
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:48,624
And I will take any questions.

367
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:53,769
I wonder if while I take questions, if maybe someone can come up and figure out how to

368
00:22:53,829 --> 00:22:59,694
get the trailer to be visible on that screen.

369
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:00,554
Because it is really fun.

370
00:23:00,574 --> 00:23:00,775
Thank you.

371
00:23:00,795 --> 00:23:01,055
Thank you.

372
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:01,295
Thank you.

373
00:23:01,335 --> 00:23:01,535
Thank you.

374
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:01,755
Thank you.

375
00:23:01,775 --> 00:23:01,976
Thank you.

376
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:02,316
Thank you.

377
00:23:02,336 --> 00:23:02,556
Thank you.

378
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:02,816
Thank you.

379
00:23:02,836 --> 00:23:03,077
Thank you.

380
00:23:03,097 --> 00:23:04,137
Thank you.

381
00:23:04,157 --> 00:23:04,378
Thank you.

382
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:07,063
I have a question.

383
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:12,565
My question relates to what experience level are your

384
00:23:12,585 --> 00:23:13,625
students coming in at?

385
00:23:13,645 --> 00:23:16,986
Because I have a sort of intro survey class.

386
00:23:17,286 --> 00:23:20,507
And at week five, I'm still trying to teach them how to

387
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:22,048
unzip a file.

388
00:23:23,008 --> 00:23:26,430
So I'm just wondering, are they more advanced in sort of

389
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,450
their technical skills?

390
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,611
Or are they fully freshman?

391
00:23:31,823 --> 00:23:33,764
So at Tufts I'm teaching in the CS department.

392
00:23:34,644 --> 00:23:36,925
They are very, they're already programmers.

393
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:38,285
They may not know C sharp,

394
00:23:38,845 --> 00:23:41,266
and they certainly need to have explained to them

395
00:23:41,506 --> 00:23:45,907
how Unity doesn't have them create one big wall of code

396
00:23:45,947 --> 00:23:48,268
to run their game, that they're doing smaller bits of code

397
00:23:48,308 --> 00:23:49,488
that are associated with objects.

398
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:53,310
So we try to catch where they're likely to get tripped up

399
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,850
and stuck, but we're not teaching them

400
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,011
a lot of the basics of the tech.

401
00:23:57,511 --> 00:23:58,151
Interestingly.

402
00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:02,972
About a quarter of the class this semester for the first time now that Tufts has absorbed

403
00:24:03,012 --> 00:24:07,336
the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, a quarter of the class is from the SMFA.

404
00:24:07,816 --> 00:24:13,001
And there are students there who are not particularly technologically strong.

405
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:14,442
They are metal welders.

406
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:18,745
They are artists in a variety of fields now excited to try this new thing.

407
00:24:19,246 --> 00:24:23,009
And we've had to adjust our thinking in some ways to make sure that they have what they

408
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:23,249
need.

409
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,912
Fortunately, their avid—oh, that was the audio.

410
00:24:28,062 --> 00:24:30,243
Fortunately, they're avid YouTube watchers.

411
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:34,525
And so creating something of a flipped classroom paradigm,

412
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:35,805
where I'll show something in class,

413
00:24:36,286 --> 00:24:38,647
but then record a video of it and send that to them

414
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,628
so they could try it again at home as many times

415
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:42,348
they need to to get it, helps.

416
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:45,810
At Harvard, it's a huge variety of students,

417
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,171
but I usually have at least a couple

418
00:24:47,251 --> 00:24:49,012
who are technologically strong who can

419
00:24:49,092 --> 00:24:50,312
carry the programming side.

420
00:24:51,313 --> 00:24:54,474
I'm encouraging really weird and wild art.

421
00:24:55,757 --> 00:25:00,778
Make bottle caps, do stop motion with lint, try things that anybody can do with their

422
00:25:00,818 --> 00:25:01,258
cell phone.

423
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:02,738
You don't have to be good at Photoshop.

424
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:04,179
I just showed them enough to cut things out.

425
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:09,100
So they're usually able to move forward with that, and everybody does really well when

426
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,820
it comes to design.

427
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:12,921
Did that answer?

428
00:25:12,941 --> 00:25:15,401
Hi.

429
00:25:15,821 --> 00:25:18,202
Oh, okay.

430
00:25:18,502 --> 00:25:19,462
Thank you for coming.

431
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:28,435
The AV just trolled us.

432
00:25:28,815 --> 00:25:29,295
It's fine.

433
00:25:31,415 --> 00:25:32,096
Thank you very much.

434
00:25:32,596 --> 00:25:33,356
Please, continue.

435
00:25:33,556 --> 00:25:35,197
Yeah, thank you very much for the talk.

436
00:25:36,277 --> 00:25:41,659
Just a question that might be either not really relevant

437
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,439
or a longer conversation.

438
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,821
So I teach in a university in Toronto,

439
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:51,422
and not the University of Toronto,

440
00:25:51,442 --> 00:25:52,862
but I teach in a university in Toronto.

441
00:25:54,183 --> 00:25:57,084
And one of the things is we have a little bit more flexibility,

442
00:25:57,124 --> 00:26:00,546
like the three classes, not one, but not too much.

443
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:06,648
And one of the things I struggle with is coming from something who came from art school first,

444
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:11,991
is the idea, is the structure of the way the class is organized,

445
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:14,972
where there is an hour and a half lecture and then two hour lab.

446
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:18,974
And it's really, yeah, it's really hard to sort of...

447
00:26:19,914 --> 00:26:24,215
have the flexibility of, for example, having an hour of like a technical thing.

448
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:34,498
And I'm just wondering if you had any thought or experience in like how to use your structure

449
00:26:34,638 --> 00:26:40,420
because I'm very much a big fan of sort of the experimental motivation thing because I

450
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,241
also teach 3D and I do that a lot. But is there a way to sort of...

451
00:26:45,862 --> 00:26:49,885
Medicate that structure in a way that I can still do that

452
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:55,089
lecture and then lab, but still have it more flexible more

453
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,994
Sure. Yeah, are you saying that the school is requiring you to follow that structure? Yeah, that's the structure of the class

454
00:27:01,115 --> 00:27:01,355
Okay

455
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:06,659
I would hope or assume that that's in order for the students to feel like they have a reliable sense of how the class is

456
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:06,939
Gonna go

457
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:16,562
So I try not to talk for more than usually about 10 minutes before I have the students

458
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:17,183
do something.

459
00:27:19,724 --> 00:27:20,624
Who's a gardener?

460
00:27:20,784 --> 00:27:22,625
Gardener is the multiple intelligences.

461
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:24,886
Are you familiar with that idea?

462
00:27:24,906 --> 00:27:28,328
It's something they drilled into us in Teach for America, the idea that there are different

463
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:30,929
ways to learn and different ways to be smart.

464
00:27:31,836 --> 00:27:35,779
And there's kinesthetic and bodily, and there's an understanding of nature.

465
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,960
It's not just being able to function in a lecture hall.

466
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,182
So getting the students up and moving, getting them using rhythm,

467
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,523
getting them interacting with each other because of the interpersonal

468
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:45,725
versus the intrapersonal makes a big difference.

469
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:49,167
There are a lot of ways to get them to interact with each other.

470
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:52,609
And sometimes it's just discuss this idea and come up with an idea.

471
00:27:54,574 --> 00:27:58,836
I'm also a volunteer here as a CA, I've been doing that for 18 years, and I got to run

472
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:05,218
a breakout session last night where the way that I handled the get to know you part, the

473
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:09,079
icebreaker, is I just ran one of these lessons, a five minute version.

474
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:13,960
I had them try to come up with a game that was based on the routines of a workplace.

475
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,818
And it got them thinking, it got them playing.

476
00:28:17,878 --> 00:28:20,460
We only had one or two ideas that were shareable.

477
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,961
They just went off in other conversations.

478
00:28:23,042 --> 00:28:25,664
But they get so much more out of talking to each other

479
00:28:25,724 --> 00:28:26,665
often than listening to me.

480
00:28:27,726 --> 00:28:29,988
So I just talk enough to give them the core ideas

481
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,209
and then try to get them running.

482
00:28:31,249 --> 00:28:33,731
So I would hope that in that lecture scenario,

483
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:36,293
there's the opportunity to have them turn to each other,

484
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:39,155
even if there isn't the idea that they are gonna go off

485
00:28:39,195 --> 00:28:39,856
and do their own thing.

486
00:28:41,926 --> 00:28:43,868
But I would advise trying to break it up.

487
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:47,011
Yeah, an hour for this of the teacher talking to me is pretty deadly.

488
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:47,331
Yeah.

489
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:54,260
Hi. Great talk. Thank you very much. I run a program at a small college in upstate New York.

490
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:00,425
And I run into a lot of the same issues that you kind of fit. You have all this content to fit into

491
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:08,091
so many courses. But I was wondering if you could, I saw you had peer evaluations towards the later

492
00:29:08,232 --> 00:29:13,276
end. And what do you, like I have my particular methodologies of how to deal with

493
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:18,139
So, I'm going to give you a little bit of a heads up on this.

494
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:25,523
I'm going to give you a little bit of a heads up on this.

495
00:29:27,524 --> 00:29:31,427
So, one thing that we do is we talk in the very beginning of the semester about what

496
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:32,087
we're here for.

497
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:36,350
And I'm certainly fortunate that I'm teaching at the moment at Tufts and at Harvard, and

498
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,453
I've got students who, for the most part, are very much there to learn and have self-selected

499
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:46,883
I have a lesson that talks about that, acknowledges that feeling and hopefully helps them get

500
00:29:46,903 --> 00:29:47,443
past it a little bit.

501
00:30:09,702 --> 00:30:13,730
So we do a lesson on iMessages where we talk about how to speak to each other if you're

502
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,672
struggling about something.

503
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:20,683
We do a lesson on how do we optimize each other.

504
00:30:21,162 --> 00:30:24,865
I'm going to be talking to each other about the ways in which we can feel best treated

505
00:30:25,805 --> 00:30:30,810
and hopefully establishing therefore some ground rules in these lessons, in these teams

506
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,751
for what we're expecting from each other.

507
00:30:33,892 --> 00:30:38,576
We have another lesson when I'm able to fit it into the semester of playing Witch Hunt

508
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:39,177
Mafia.

509
00:30:39,717 --> 00:30:42,840
Just to experience the triangulation and that can be fun.

510
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,063
The first semester we did this and the department chair who had approved the class came down

511
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:46,603
and played with us.

512
00:30:47,144 --> 00:30:47,644
She was a witch.

513
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:53,339
And I make myself very available to the students.

514
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:54,259
I'm checking in.

515
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,023
They are reporting on each other with these peer evaluations.

516
00:30:59,103 --> 00:31:01,786
The peer evaluations ask four main questions.

517
00:31:03,387 --> 00:31:05,569
What is this student doing well in terms of productivity?

518
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:07,711
What do you wish they were doing better or more of?

519
00:31:08,612 --> 00:31:09,873
How is this student doing in terms

520
00:31:09,913 --> 00:31:11,134
of contributing to team morale?

521
00:31:11,534 --> 00:31:12,675
What do you wish they were doing more of?

522
00:31:13,175 --> 00:31:14,677
And then I give them some concrete numbers.

523
00:31:15,297 --> 00:31:17,799
Rate their productivity and their morale,

524
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:18,620
each in a score of 1 to 10.

525
00:31:19,362 --> 00:31:21,683
All of which is just to help narrow them into a sense of,

526
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:22,864
how is this person doing?

527
00:31:23,144 --> 00:31:24,324
They do that for all their teammates,

528
00:31:25,065 --> 00:31:27,006
and they get a pool of numbers.

529
00:31:27,526 --> 00:31:30,207
That is, if they've got three teammates, it's 30 points,

530
00:31:30,407 --> 00:31:32,308
and they have to decide unevenly who gets what.

531
00:31:33,008 --> 00:31:35,069
And it's just to help them make a judgment call.

532
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:36,930
It's just so they don't take the cop out of,

533
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:37,830
ah, you all get 10s.

534
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:41,012
And it helps them just to make concrete,

535
00:31:41,112 --> 00:31:42,832
to put into words what they are feeling,

536
00:31:42,852 --> 00:31:44,473
what they're thinking, so they don't let it go.

537
00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:47,854
And I also tell them early on that the stakes

538
00:31:48,597 --> 00:31:49,118
for this class.

539
00:32:19,141 --> 00:32:22,022
But it's also meant to be an opportunity for them to talk to each other.

540
00:32:22,923 --> 00:32:25,645
So they will hopefully take that and go, OK, I'm ready to have a conversation.

541
00:32:26,025 --> 00:32:30,368
And hopefully use the iMessage system to get behind the person's possible defensiveness.

542
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:33,890
I think, are you out of time?

543
00:32:35,891 --> 00:32:39,614
We are at time. I will stay as long as you want, because I am delighted to meet you all.

544
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:41,075
Thank you so much for being here.
