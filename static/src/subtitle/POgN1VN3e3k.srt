1
00:00:01,708 --> 00:00:01,849
You

2
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:06,092
So welcome to Everything's on Fire and No One Knows What to Do.

3
00:00:06,592 --> 00:00:09,773
This panel was born largely out of the same ideas that Tom was expressing,

4
00:00:09,813 --> 00:00:14,135
the idea that we often feel as game writers, especially if we're working at a smaller company

5
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:17,816
or working on our own stuff, that we struggle alone and we fight alone.

6
00:00:17,956 --> 00:00:21,918
And I wanted to go into some of the challenges that we can face as game writers together

7
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:25,579
to give you some hope that maybe when you're going through something similar

8
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:28,720
to the things we're describing here, you will know you're not alone

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,181
and everything is on fire, but it's going to be okay.

10
00:00:32,453 --> 00:00:33,594
So we'll start with some introductions.

11
00:00:34,594 --> 00:00:34,834
Gavin.

12
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:36,075
Hello.

13
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:38,976
So I'm Gavin Jurgens-Fury.

14
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:41,777
I'm a lead writer at InXile Entertainment.

15
00:00:42,197 --> 00:00:44,398
My past projects include Diablo III,

16
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:46,779
Torment Tides of Numenera, Wasteland III,

17
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,120
which we're working on right now, and Horizon Zero Dawn.

18
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:56,875
Hi there. My name is Colin McComb. I'm the creative lead for Torment Tides of Numenera. I

19
00:00:56,915 --> 00:01:01,979
have also worked on Planescape Torment, Fallout 2, and Wasteland 2 as well as some other

20
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,943
games for my own company. I'm Leanne Taylor-Giles. I've been in the industry for 10

21
00:01:07,283 --> 00:01:11,467
years and I have a masters in branching dialogue systems that you can read if you would

22
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:14,790
like to. I'm Chris Avalone and I'm very old.

23
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:21,191
I recently worked on Prey, I was part of the System Shock reboot, and also I'm working

24
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:24,714
with the FTL guys, Subset Games, on Into the Breach.

25
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:30,598
I'm George Zaitz, writer and lead designer at InXile Entertainment.

26
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:34,060
Just finished up Torment Tides of Numenera, now working on Wasteland 3.

27
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,903
I worked at a bunch of other RPGs at Obsidian, and then a bunch of MMOs before that.

28
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,674
So we all, between us, have a lot of experience

29
00:01:42,714 --> 00:01:44,235
and a lot of experience in different fields

30
00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:46,876
ranging from tabletop, indie, mid-tier, AAA.

31
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:48,677
Basically, if you have a question afterward,

32
00:01:49,197 --> 00:01:51,098
we're gonna have the Q&A at the standing mics

33
00:01:51,218 --> 00:01:52,238
in either of the aisles there.

34
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,800
We will also be at the wrap-up room after the panel

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,660
if you would like to come and ask us something in person.

36
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:57,221
Please do.

37
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:02,778
Okay, so just a quick question for the audience.

38
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:04,860
We know how many of you are here for the first time,

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,102
but I would like to get a gauge of how many people

40
00:02:07,122 --> 00:02:08,503
have been in the industry for how long

41
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,205
so we can tailor our approach.

42
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:13,347
So who's been in the industry for one to five years?

43
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:14,128
Hands up.

44
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:15,369
Great.

45
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:16,370
Five to 10.

46
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:18,091
Nice.

47
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:18,772
10 to 15.

48
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:19,032
Ooh, 15 plus.

49
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,600
Very nice.

50
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:25,122
Okay, so we have a broad range

51
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:27,324
and we can talk about it from many different angles.

52
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:30,667
We're going to start off with identifying

53
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:32,349
some games writing related terms

54
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,431
that we find are very important

55
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:36,793
when we're communicating to other departments especially.

56
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,375
So not just between writers, which is always a delight,

57
00:02:39,996 --> 00:02:40,977
but when we need to talk to people

58
00:02:41,017 --> 00:02:42,518
who maybe have a different understanding

59
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,080
of how they express story.

60
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,961
We'll start with Colin.

61
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:50,937
Sure. So my big thing is collaborative storytelling.

62
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:54,220
We are just one part of a team.

63
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:56,642
I mean, obviously we're the most important part of a team.

64
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:57,623
But.

65
00:02:59,628 --> 00:03:04,813
What we do, we can only do with the help of the programmers,

66
00:03:04,873 --> 00:03:06,335
with the artists, with QA.

67
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:09,598
And it is our job to bring them into the story,

68
00:03:09,638 --> 00:03:11,520
to make them feel like they own it with us,

69
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,504
so that they feel empowered, so they feel some ownership,

70
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:18,067
and so that they want to be a part of the project,

71
00:03:18,107 --> 00:03:19,808
and so that they love it as much as we do.

72
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,570
Because, God, I love.

73
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:25,241
Personally, I love stories. I love writing stories. I love telling stories.

74
00:03:25,341 --> 00:03:29,447
And I want all of these people to feel that same sort of love for this thing as I do.

75
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:32,431
There is nothing more disheartening than talking to somebody and they're like,

76
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:34,394
Eh, it's a paycheck.

77
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:36,357
You're like, Oh, but this is my baby.

78
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:39,887
So, it's important to bring people in.

79
00:03:39,947 --> 00:03:41,828
It's important to have them discuss the game with you.

80
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:44,008
It's important to have them provide their feedback.

81
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:46,889
And it's important that they feel that they are a part

82
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:48,349
of this process with you.

83
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,310
If they are not involved,

84
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,690
we might as well just be writing novels.

85
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,511
And that's a lot less fun.

86
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:55,931
Thank you.

87
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:57,252
Kevin?

88
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:01,212
So the term I wanted to discuss today,

89
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:03,173
sorry, I'm trying to master this microphone.

90
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:04,733
I don't think I have it figured out yet.

91
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:12,959
is uh, so every single place I've worked at except in exile someone has cornered me right around the first day or so and

92
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:19,987
Pushed me into a corner and said I don't like game story. I don't like writing. Was it Colin? Yeah, it's generally Colin

93
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:23,264
He follows me everywhere.

94
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:24,145
Usually at night.

95
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:26,046
I'm out front of his door.

96
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:28,368
And so what people usually mean in this case

97
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:29,708
is that they don't like cinematics.

98
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:31,890
And I think because you guys are here,

99
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,492
you know that there's more to game writing than cinematics.

100
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:37,294
So a lot of the time, what I try to establish on a team

101
00:04:37,314 --> 00:04:38,375
that I've come into, that there's

102
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:40,496
a difference between cinematics and game writing.

103
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:42,838
And what I like to say that game writing is

104
00:04:42,878 --> 00:04:43,779
is sort of a bridge.

105
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:46,440
It's a bridge between what the designers intended

106
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,182
and what stories the players are telling themselves.

107
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:52,275
As writers, we're there to empower the players,

108
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:54,576
to make them feel like their choices have meaning,

109
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:56,657
even though the designers have something

110
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:58,498
very definite in mind for what the writers,

111
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:00,099
or what the players will experience.

112
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,461
Great, I'm gonna take that a step further.

113
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:05,942
The term that I would like to define is emergent narrative,

114
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:07,843
which has several different meanings

115
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:08,984
depending on who you talk to.

116
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:12,086
My favorite is that 50% of the story

117
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,506
is told in the player's head.

118
00:05:14,324 --> 00:05:18,247
So part of writing for games is leaving those silences where the player can talk to themselves

119
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:22,091
without even realizing and say, oh, that's what this means, this is what it means to me.

120
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:26,314
Because they're going to tell themselves a far more personal story than we can ever tell them

121
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:27,795
since we're writing for a mass audience.

122
00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:30,878
And that was one of my favorite things about working on Tides of Numenera

123
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:33,200
was the ability to have that ambiguity

124
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,483
and present the players with the option to interpret what was going on.

125
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:37,984
and react accordingly.

126
00:05:38,445 --> 00:05:41,088
So remembering that the player is telling the story with you

127
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,031
even though you're far apart in time or in space,

128
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:45,873
they're still a part of that story

129
00:05:45,994 --> 00:05:48,376
and what they create out of what you have given them

130
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:50,158
is very, very exciting.

131
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:56,613
So in my ever increasing effort to make sure Leanne never invites me on the panels again,

132
00:05:57,674 --> 00:06:01,656
when I initially got this question, I went through a range of emotions, much like dialogue

133
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:02,236
responses.

134
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:06,578
I went from the angry, well, there's terms I never like to hear, like the word impossible.

135
00:06:06,878 --> 00:06:09,799
If you ever tell me the word impossible, I'm going to kill you until you quantify it.

136
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,880
Also the word sorry offends me.

137
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,762
And also, we need to be on the same page when I ask for something by the end of the day,

138
00:06:15,782 --> 00:06:18,423
I need to confirm with you what end of the day means.

139
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:24,338
But from a narrative standpoint, I like to invent a term when talking with QA,

140
00:06:24,398 --> 00:06:29,201
because I feel quality assurance has been trained never to report a story-based bug.

141
00:06:29,882 --> 00:06:32,564
They always treat it as a deep priority suggestion or,

142
00:06:32,944 --> 00:06:34,865
man, you know, this is kind of confusing to me,

143
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:37,808
but I'm kind of afraid to bring it up because story is kind of nebulous.

144
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:39,629
For me, a narrative bug.

145
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,750
is a very, very real thing.

146
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,932
If there is some story point you don't get,

147
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:46,233
if you don't understand how a character

148
00:06:46,293 --> 00:06:47,614
arrived at a certain location,

149
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:49,696
even how you as a player got to a location,

150
00:06:50,096 --> 00:06:52,037
and it's never explained anywhere else in the game,

151
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,940
those are things that QA should be trained to write up,

152
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,661
along with really bad VO lines

153
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:00,223
that the QA department will laugh about consistently.

154
00:07:00,663 --> 00:07:02,725
Walk through your QA department, listen,

155
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,286
see where your bad VO is,

156
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:05,887
and either delete it or get it re-recorded.

157
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:14,554
So the term, I guess it's less of a term and it's more of a distinction, is story versus setting.

158
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:18,516
And I probably don't really need to define these for this room, but I'll kind of give my shorthand.

159
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:23,559
Story is the plot. It's the sequence of events with a beginning, a middle, and an end.

160
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:26,141
It's usually driven by the player or it's about the player.

161
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:30,463
The setting, on the other hand, is the backdrop. It's the place and the time.

162
00:07:30,763 --> 00:07:32,484
It's all the details about the world.

163
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:36,266
It's basically the stuff that would be there even if the player didn't exist.

164
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:43,752
And as writers we need setting because it helps us to create a coherent and consistent game

165
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:49,776
But the important point to keep in mind is just because you have a setting doesn't mean you have a story

166
00:07:50,357 --> 00:07:55,881
And that's a distinction that has been lost on a number of teams that I've worked on not so much the teams with these guys

167
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:59,303
But sometimes in the MMO space that's been that's been misunderstood

168
00:07:59,323 --> 00:08:01,325
Fantastic

169
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,590
So we're going to jump into the first question,

170
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,512
which is relevant to that, so the setting versus the story.

171
00:08:08,193 --> 00:08:10,194
How do you balance input from other disciplines

172
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:11,575
with the story requirements?

173
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:14,697
Go ahead.

174
00:08:14,717 --> 00:08:17,458
Wow, that bleeds directly from what I was saying earlier.

175
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,100
So as Chris was saying about QA,

176
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,122
we want to request input from other departments.

177
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,083
We want to make sure, as I said,

178
00:08:25,103 --> 00:08:26,644
that they are feeling ownership of this

179
00:08:26,704 --> 00:08:29,626
because they have perspectives on the story that,

180
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:33,908
We don't have, you're all writers here,

181
00:08:33,968 --> 00:08:37,350
we all know what it is to get too close to a story.

182
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:43,274
It is almost impossible to have a good overview of it

183
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:44,915
when you're down in the weeds and you're writing

184
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:47,076
because you're just seeing tree, tree, tree,

185
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:49,618
and somebody who is new to it is seeing forest.

186
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:51,238
Or trash.

187
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:52,179
Or trash, yeah.

188
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,580
Or a fire.

189
00:08:56,027 --> 00:09:01,212
So what we want is we want to get their input. We want people to come in and say, okay, so

190
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:07,078
here's what I think this is. Here's a cool idea that I have. Artists, for instance, George

191
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:12,203
said this in an interview just the other day, artists can provide us with insights into

192
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:15,366
characters and ideas that we never knew that we were lacking.

193
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:22,449
We can just say, okay, make something cool and new and they will create something that is so

194
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,991
awesome and neat that we're going to like, oh, you know what, we're going to reorient this

195
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:33,074
entire level to make something really cool about this. We want input from other teams. At the

196
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:33,714
same time...

197
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:41,179
At the same time, we don't want them to feel so much ownership that they're pushing us out and

198
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:44,381
they're like, you just put the words on the page, writer boy.

199
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:47,123
You just take the script to the dialogue pass and that's how it gets written.

200
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:53,308
Exactly. So basically, you know, we want to get their input, but then you've got to filter it and

201
00:09:53,348 --> 00:09:56,570
decide, okay, does this actually match with the themes of the game? Does this match with what

202
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:02,074
we're trying to do? And is this going to be a valuable piece of input moving forward? And it's

203
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:05,356
your job as writers to figure out where their input plugs in.

204
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:13,439
Exactly. It is a question of picking your battles, which is something that I think a lot of writers struggle with at first when they get into game writing.

205
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:18,501
You have to decide what is crucial to the story. You have to decide what's crucial to the game.

206
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:28,664
And you have to be willing and aware that when you shut someone down, you are stopping them possibly from ever coming to you with an idea again, and you will possibly lose something very precious.

207
00:10:29,577 --> 00:10:31,920
So I would say, once again, pick your battles.

208
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,025
Make sure that if you're going to tell someone that their

209
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:39,809
idea won't work, and I would advise against that, tell them

210
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,933
why, make them feel part ownership of the project, make

211
00:10:42,953 --> 00:10:43,594
them understand it.

212
00:10:43,634 --> 00:10:45,997
It's an education, or it's an educating moment.

213
00:10:46,873 --> 00:10:48,034
And it can be an ego thing.

214
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:49,656
If you've worked really hard on an idea

215
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:50,877
and someone comes in and says, you know,

216
00:10:50,977 --> 00:10:51,877
I don't understand it.

217
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,539
And you try to explain it to them

218
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:54,599
and they still don't get it,

219
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,521
that's the point where you need to say, okay,

220
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,783
but this person is representative of my audience

221
00:10:58,863 --> 00:11:00,864
just as I am representative of my own audience.

222
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:02,305
Things that resonate with me

223
00:11:02,325 --> 00:11:04,227
won't necessarily resonate with everyone else.

224
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:05,988
And so finding that medium between

225
00:11:06,388 --> 00:11:08,790
what they are looking for in the story that you're telling

226
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,292
and how you're telling the story is a delicate balance.

227
00:11:11,717 --> 00:11:16,041
Although, I would add that I did get input from somebody once and they're like, well,

228
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:20,525
you know what, I don't like the direction this story's going and here's some ideas that

229
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:21,165
I would have to fix.

230
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:24,929
It's like, well, that's good, but this is a philosophical RPG, not a...

231
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:29,012
Yeah, we used to have the three critique rule, like it's okay if one person brings it up,

232
00:11:29,032 --> 00:11:32,676
it's good to digest that, but then it takes two more people to bring up the same subject

233
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:34,737
and you're like, yeah, that's definitely got to change.

234
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:38,354
Fantastic. Okay.

235
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:40,676
Our next question is, how do you stay flexible

236
00:11:40,736 --> 00:11:42,297
but still do your work when gameplay

237
00:11:42,357 --> 00:11:44,259
and level design decisions are yet to be made

238
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,180
or keep changing?

239
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,741
George, would you like to start off?

240
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:53,751
Sure. So in my opinion, flexibility can really be a mindset. Think of, especially when you're

241
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:58,534
writing a story, think of everything that you're writing as early on in the project as not

242
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:04,998
complete. So when you're actually, this is a little goofy, but almost think of a story like a

243
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:09,721
sculpture. That is at least what I do when I'm coming up with a story for a game. Initially

244
00:12:09,741 --> 00:12:12,923
you've got a big block of stone. It's completely shapeless. It can be anything.

245
00:12:14,144 --> 00:12:18,107
Then, as you're starting to write the initial drafts of the story, it's kind of taking shape,

246
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,070
and you can kind of see what it's going to be, but you've still got a lot of wiggle room,

247
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,213
so when new ideas come up, you can still go in a number of different directions.

248
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:28,717
And it's only toward the very end of the project, when you've basically got, like, David in

249
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:35,342
front of you, and you've got a fully formed statue, that it's very difficult to make significant

250
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:36,243
changes at that point.

251
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:41,964
Now, having said all that, also, don't be afraid to push back,

252
00:12:42,104 --> 00:12:46,745
especially late in the project, against changes that you feel are too extreme.

253
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:52,807
But do it in the language of the producers, which means do it in terms of time estimates.

254
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:56,467
If you think somebody, you're close to the end of a project, and someone says,

255
00:12:56,987 --> 00:12:59,428
oh man, we really want to completely change the beginning of the game.

256
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:01,828
At that point, instead of...

257
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:08,090
going crazy, sit down and figure out exactly what the impacts of that is going to be in

258
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:08,911
terms of days.

259
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,832
So okay, we have to rewrite these 20 dialogues, that's 80 days.

260
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:14,813
We have to change these levels, that's another 20.

261
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:19,615
Whatever it is, and then get, say it's 100 days it's going to take to do this, to make

262
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:21,435
this change, bring that to the producer.

263
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:25,077
they will so appreciate that you've done it in terms that they can understand.

264
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:26,637
You may get the answer of,

265
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:28,238
well, okay, 100 extra days,

266
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:29,498
we can do that, it's in the budget,

267
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:33,640
but at least you will have a reasonable amount of time to do

268
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,901
the thing that you need to do to make the change and

269
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,902
the producer will expect a reasonable outcome from you.

270
00:13:39,522 --> 00:13:40,983
On the other hand, they might say, oh my God,

271
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:42,984
we can't take 100 extra days,

272
00:13:43,084 --> 00:13:44,825
and then you might even not have to make the change.

273
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:48,066
So push back, but do it in the language of the producers.

274
00:13:48,806 --> 00:13:51,728
Numbers are really helpful when you're working with something that is normally

275
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:53,890
quantitative versus qualitative.

276
00:13:54,511 --> 00:13:57,933
If you can put it in terms that, as George has said very well, that producers can

277
00:13:57,953 --> 00:14:01,456
understand, then you're going to have a lot more support to say, we need to do

278
00:14:01,516 --> 00:14:05,600
this X amount of work, because people can look at writing and say, oh, but you just

279
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,440
need to redo the script.

280
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:07,561
That's five minutes.

281
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:08,702
You know, it's going to be fine.

282
00:14:09,203 --> 00:14:10,704
It's just the time it takes to type it in.

283
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:12,065
That's it, it's really just,

284
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:13,746
I mean, you don't have to search the letters out

285
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,808
individually and put them on the screen.

286
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:17,289
You're not making a ransom note here.

287
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,571
So they tend to think of it in terms of that

288
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:22,033
and they don't tend to think of it in terms of,

289
00:14:22,113 --> 00:14:24,675
oh well, if I had to redo my level from the start,

290
00:14:25,055 --> 00:14:27,397
okay, that's three months worth of work, right?

291
00:14:27,477 --> 00:14:30,179
So having that ability to talk to producers

292
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:32,160
is an excellent skill, I'm glad that George raised it.

293
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:34,943
And Chris, would you like to answer?

294
00:14:35,203 --> 00:14:37,625
Oh yeah, so yeah, I'd be the third person to say that,

295
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:39,627
you know, metrics will win a lot of arguments for you

296
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,489
with production and getting the game done on time.

297
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,612
However, I've often found that when level design

298
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:47,694
and system design is still in flux,

299
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:49,935
there's still a number of core elements

300
00:14:49,995 --> 00:14:51,156
I can always still count on.

301
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:54,659
So I gear a lot of my writing efforts to making sure

302
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:56,961
that at least the writing is supporting that,

303
00:14:56,981 --> 00:14:58,442
and that's very unlikely to change.

304
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:03,164
What George was saying about pushback when certain things are in flux,

305
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:07,065
I think it's also important to ask why things are changing.

306
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:12,066
Because sometimes I've been on projects where people have been looking at it too long

307
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:15,546
and they start getting bored with it and they feel it has to change

308
00:15:16,027 --> 00:15:19,187
before a player has ever seen the gameplay experience at all.

309
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:21,368
And that's the absolute wrong thing to do.

310
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:26,432
That's when you bring a focus test in to show them that people are really excited about what they're doing

311
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,796
and show them these things don't need to change simply for the sake of boredom.

312
00:15:30,617 --> 00:15:31,958
But to actually get some helpful advice,

313
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:37,664
when doing writing for RPGs especially, what I try and do is create

314
00:15:38,385 --> 00:15:41,629
critical paths and quest lines that involve floating NPCs.

315
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:44,010
And these are NPCs that you can move to

316
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,171
just about any map, anywhere, and the quest will still work.

317
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:48,911
So even if the level design is changing,

318
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:50,692
even if systems might be different,

319
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:52,573
you can place these NPCs anywhere

320
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:54,753
and still maintain a coherent quest line.

321
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:58,235
Yeah, removing the narrative from the actual level flow

322
00:15:58,295 --> 00:15:59,235
can sometimes be helpful.

323
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:01,956
Reintegrating it is also very useful though.

324
00:16:01,996 --> 00:16:03,256
You need to have consistency

325
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:04,297
between the narrative and the level.

326
00:16:04,357 --> 00:16:06,257
Otherwise, that's complicated.

327
00:16:10,227 --> 00:16:11,147
We'll move on to the next one.

328
00:16:11,227 --> 00:16:14,390
So what do you do when the game's story gets re-scoped

329
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,711
during the latter part of production

330
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,472
and how do you integrate the necessary changes

331
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:19,073
continuing on from the same theme?

332
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:21,234
Well, as Chris was saying,

333
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:25,057
it's very useful to develop a critical path document

334
00:16:25,758 --> 00:16:28,439
with the floating NPCs who can move places

335
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,482
because chances are good your game will get re-scoped.

336
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:40,748
we're all very ambitious storytellers. And ambition is frequently the enemy of reality.

337
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:47,831
So you need to, if you have a critical path document with your flow chart and you're

338
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:52,694
essentially figuring out what it is that you need to accomplish in the story, you can start

339
00:16:52,774 --> 00:16:57,416
pushing things toward the front because your game will get re-scoped unless you have done

340
00:16:57,476 --> 00:17:00,558
just such a masterful job of early production.

341
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:04,212
which, you know, if you have, please introduce me to your producer.

342
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:11,575
But this is actually a good opportunity for you because it allows you to re-examine the

343
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:15,836
story, it allows you to re-examine the structure of the whole thing, and you can start re-pacing

344
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:22,159
and you can start re-scoping and pushing everything into a more compact, more easily digestible

345
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:26,480
story because, let's face it, we are writers and we tend to write long.

346
00:17:28,732 --> 00:17:30,456
Sometimes edits make a script so much better

347
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:32,000
and you didn't even know that you needed to do that.

348
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,105
I actually like re-scoping for that reason.

349
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:35,067
Sometimes it allows you to go,

350
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,711
oh, I didn't need that to begin with.

351
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:42,518
Chris, did you have something to say on the?

352
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:43,958
Yeah, with rescoping.

353
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:46,279
So it's a lot of what we discussed before,

354
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,920
but generally whenever doing narrative work for a game,

355
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,680
I usually prioritize everything into A, critical path,

356
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:53,921
B, this would be nice to have,

357
00:17:53,961 --> 00:17:56,662
and the player would certainly probably slightly miss it

358
00:17:56,682 --> 00:17:57,282
if it wasn't there,

359
00:17:57,322 --> 00:17:59,163
and C, priority is just like gravy stuff

360
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:00,223
that the player would probably love,

361
00:18:00,263 --> 00:18:01,683
but they wouldn't miss it if it wasn't there.

362
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:06,864
So I break all the tasks into those elements and then as things need to get downscoped

363
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:13,686
I drop the C elements and then the B elements, hopefully not the B elements, but I keep that priority system in mind.

364
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:21,448
When re-scoping I also ask why it's being re-scoped because I need to understand

365
00:18:22,408 --> 00:18:28,069
what material has already been done, what I can count on, and what I shouldn't drop from the story

366
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,530
that actually is already done and I can make use of.

367
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,210
Go to Beadaholique.com for all of your beading supply needs!

368
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,651
Generally, whenever anything's being re-scoped,

369
00:18:35,372 --> 00:18:38,093
in addition to that floating NPC idea I mentioned before,

370
00:18:38,673 --> 00:18:40,113
about halfway through production,

371
00:18:40,193 --> 00:18:45,015
writers aren't blind to the fact that environment art

372
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:46,596
might not be getting done, for example.

373
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:48,497
So I actually start making a secret list

374
00:18:49,097 --> 00:18:50,598
of all the environments that we already have done

375
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:52,958
for the game and how we can change them slightly

376
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:55,519
and still maintain new gameplay spaces.

377
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,200
Like, hey, we can still use Rome,

378
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,741
but it'll be Rome at night.

379
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:00,381
That'll help you, won't it?

380
00:19:01,298 --> 00:19:02,439
And the story goes on.

381
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:06,181
But yeah, that's just a few techniques I use.

382
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:09,003
Yeah, some of the story stuff is actually pretty easy

383
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:09,924
to adjust as well.

384
00:19:10,004 --> 00:19:12,125
And you can throw little bits of dialogue in.

385
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:16,308
It's important to know what bits of the story

386
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:18,189
are important to be delivered when.

387
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,031
And so if you can just move that

388
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:24,013
or even just quickly adjust a small bit of dialogue,

389
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:27,215
that really helps in the whole re-scope process.

390
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,356
But Chris's process is actually better.

391
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,390
But he did raise a really good point that you need to know

392
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,892
why it's being re-scoped because you need to tailor

393
00:19:34,932 --> 00:19:37,913
the story to what the re-scoping needs.

394
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:39,254
There is nothing better than like,

395
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:40,435
oh, environment art's behind.

396
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:42,736
Like, okay, well I can fix this if they do 50 new levels.

397
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:44,718
And they're like, that doesn't help us at all.

398
00:19:45,278 --> 00:19:46,519
But you can put an amazing story in there.

399
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:47,159
There's so much space.

400
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:54,118
But in terms of that, we are normally talking with producers when we're talking about re-scoping.

401
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:59,405
And it's very important to have a producer who understands the needs of narrative versus the needs of other departments.

402
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:04,492
And so I think we all have an opinion on what qualities writers need in their producers.

403
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:07,656
Casual murder.

404
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:15,863
Well, okay, so I've had a lot of producers and I think I've been lucky in that I've had pretty

405
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:22,245
much all good ones. But I can say there's been a few that were absolutely stellar and I think the

406
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:31,287
thing that made them stand apart was a shared passion. They are the ones that get mad on your

407
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:31,827
behalf.

408
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,542
So if I, and an understanding of design does help too.

409
00:20:36,622 --> 00:20:41,464
So if you are out there and looking to be a writer's

410
00:20:41,504 --> 00:20:46,866
producer, care about what they have, definitely give them

411
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:48,067
feedback on the story.

412
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:49,807
And that doesn't necessarily mean.

413
00:20:51,188 --> 00:20:54,190
stop them from brainstorming, for example.

414
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,852
But definitely if they're seeking feedback,

415
00:20:55,872 --> 00:20:56,612
get them feedback.

416
00:20:56,652 --> 00:20:59,114
If they have design questions, get them answers.

417
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,096
Get passionate on their behalf

418
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:02,437
and help them solve the problems

419
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:04,018
that are stopping them from moving forward.

420
00:21:06,503 --> 00:21:10,505
So I'm going to answer this one from a couple of different perspectives.

421
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:14,688
The first perspective is from an indie, a small team.

422
00:21:15,528 --> 00:21:19,611
What you want most from a producer there is flexibility and range.

423
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:22,092
You want somebody who knows how to do art.

424
00:21:22,132 --> 00:21:24,514
You want somebody who knows how to do programming.

425
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:27,996
You want somebody who knows how to do sound, so that they are able to reach out and get

426
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:32,599
into each discipline and communicate with people effectively and step in to fill the

427
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:33,699
gaps that are necessary.

428
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,043
If you're talking a larger scale game, though, what you need is somebody who understands

429
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:46,968
scope, budget, and basically all the metrics that go into keeping a game on time and on

430
00:21:47,048 --> 00:21:51,250
track. Somebody who knows how to communicate both with upper management and with the

431
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:57,154
lower ranks, that is crucial. Because if there is a blockage in any one of those things,

432
00:21:57,695 --> 00:21:58,635
you're headed down.

433
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,742
And as Chris said, being able to put things by priority

434
00:22:02,762 --> 00:22:05,364
and having a producer who understands writing priority

435
00:22:05,404 --> 00:22:07,346
as opposed to level up priority

436
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:09,347
makes a really big difference when you're able to say,

437
00:22:09,407 --> 00:22:11,109
okay, but I really, really, really need to do

438
00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:13,310
this conversation that seems like it's not important at all

439
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,372
because otherwise the whole narrative falls down.

440
00:22:15,832 --> 00:22:16,773
Having a producer who goes,

441
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:18,154
okay, we're gonna make this work

442
00:22:18,695 --> 00:22:20,036
and being a person who fights for you

443
00:22:20,056 --> 00:22:21,917
and advocates for the things that you want to do

444
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:24,359
with the story versus the creative direction

445
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:26,521
and everything like that, they're normally a mediator.

446
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,142
if they're working with you and for you,

447
00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:32,124
they're mediating between all the other inputs

448
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:33,165
that are coming in, and in fact,

449
00:22:33,205 --> 00:22:35,786
they're helping you talk to the other departments as well.

450
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:38,368
And I wanted to say that saying it's a person

451
00:22:38,408 --> 00:22:40,729
who gets mad on your behalf is a really excellent way

452
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:42,730
to look at the best producers that I've worked with.

453
00:22:43,171 --> 00:22:44,732
They're the ones who allow me to sit in the room

454
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:47,353
and be the cool, calm, quiet, collected writer

455
00:22:47,373 --> 00:22:49,054
who's like, oh yes, I see what you're doing there.

456
00:22:49,074 --> 00:22:51,315
And they're the one who's going, no, this is unacceptable,

457
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:52,916
we're not doing this, it's a waste of time.

458
00:22:52,976 --> 00:22:53,837
And I just get to sit there and go,

459
00:22:53,857 --> 00:22:55,098
hee hee hee, this is fantastic.

460
00:22:55,858 --> 00:23:00,703
So, having someone who can fight for you, and there's a bit of an assumption that writers

461
00:23:00,723 --> 00:23:03,826
tend to be dramatic, whether that's true or not.

462
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:10,231
So being able to be calm and collected is a real privilege when working with a good

463
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:10,772
producer.

464
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:15,556
It tends to get your point across much more frequently than it might otherwise.

465
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:22,273
What qualities do writers need in their producers?

466
00:23:22,513 --> 00:23:24,635
Oh, I'm part of this question too?

467
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:26,617
Wow, I'm going to be really undermining.

468
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:29,460
I actually don't like it when a producer gets emotional.

469
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,783
I actually like it when they firmly defend a position

470
00:23:32,823 --> 00:23:34,105
and they use metrics to defend it,

471
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:38,569
because I've often found that if a producer gets too emotional about something,

472
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:41,051
sometimes people are afraid to bring up problems with them

473
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:42,233
because they're afraid of the reaction.

474
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:46,615
So, whenever I work with producers, I'm always like,

475
00:23:46,655 --> 00:23:48,516
you know what, just pretend like you're in Dragnet

476
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:51,717
and just, you know, be the guy who just wants the facts

477
00:23:52,177 --> 00:23:53,658
and spout some facts back to me,

478
00:23:53,678 --> 00:23:56,459
and I'll reach a compromise that will usually involve me

479
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:57,240
cutting my work.

480
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,600
And I will understand that

481
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,921
because you're not being emotional right now.

482
00:24:02,857 --> 00:24:04,938
So I'm going to say ability to know your people.

483
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,381
A good producer, at least in my opinion,

484
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:11,343
has an ability to know each writer's strengths, weaknesses,

485
00:24:11,403 --> 00:24:13,064
and what they need to do their best work.

486
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:16,947
And probably the best producer I've ever worked with,

487
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:19,709
a guy named Kevin Saunders, who just about all of us know,

488
00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:20,590
or I think all of us know.

489
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:27,111
He, on the first project I worked with him on, made it his business to observe me and

490
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:29,632
figure out what he could do to make me my most productive.

491
00:24:29,832 --> 00:24:32,432
And one of the things about me is I am super distractible.

492
00:24:32,992 --> 00:24:36,793
So if I'm sitting in a room, there's like a bunch of people talking, yeah, it's like

493
00:24:36,813 --> 00:24:37,013
that.

494
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:38,233
I just lost.

495
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:42,914
So, and people coming in and out, lots of noise, I will get very little done.

496
00:24:43,895 --> 00:24:48,816
So he observed that about me, and then he, behind the scenes, worked to get me my own

497
00:24:48,836 --> 00:24:49,716
little private office.

498
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,237
And it was not like some spectacular office,

499
00:24:52,297 --> 00:24:54,438
but I loved it because I could shut the door

500
00:24:54,778 --> 00:24:57,679
and I could focus and I got so much done.

501
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,801
According to Kevin's metrics, my productivity doubled

502
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:03,182
just as a result of that one change.

503
00:25:04,222 --> 00:25:07,044
So, and I am certain that that game,

504
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:08,844
the writing on that game would not have gotten done

505
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:10,145
and certainly would not have gotten done

506
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:12,726
at that quality level if he had not done that.

507
00:25:13,226 --> 00:25:15,107
So that's a big argument for producers

508
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:17,028
who can understand their people

509
00:25:17,128 --> 00:25:19,269
and know what is gonna make them do their best work.

510
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:21,832
That's an excellent segue, George,

511
00:25:21,872 --> 00:25:23,573
in terms of getting to know new people.

512
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:25,754
How do you go about mentoring new writers?

513
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:30,116
What's the best way to instruct a veteran writer

514
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,657
to mentor a new writer?

515
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:33,437
You want me or Chris first?

516
00:25:33,738 --> 00:25:34,198
Yeah, you can go.

517
00:25:34,238 --> 00:25:34,338
Me?

518
00:25:34,438 --> 00:25:35,438
OK.

519
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:38,780
So a couple of people on this panel

520
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,281
will know these things about me.

521
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:43,242
So the first thing I would do is,

522
00:25:46,175 --> 00:25:50,719
make sure that you are giving writers a lot of feedback.

523
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:54,583
In the initial dialogues that are coming in,

524
00:25:54,724 --> 00:25:56,726
when you've got a new writer that you've hired on,

525
00:25:57,246 --> 00:25:59,588
make sure that you're giving a ton of feedback.

526
00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:02,652
What I will do, actually Gavin experienced this from me,

527
00:26:04,493 --> 00:26:06,315
I mean, he knows what I'm talking about.

528
00:26:06,836 --> 00:26:08,718
The first couple dialogues that come in,

529
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:11,481
I will read every word, I will read every single node,

530
00:26:12,142 --> 00:26:13,843
and I will give feedback, if necessary,

531
00:26:13,944 --> 00:26:15,505
on every single note of dialogue.

532
00:26:15,585 --> 00:26:18,909
I'm somewhat notorious for my multi-page reviews

533
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:20,391
of people's dialogues.

534
00:26:21,691 --> 00:26:26,113
But it's really important on those first few dialogues that come in,

535
00:26:26,713 --> 00:26:29,814
because it sort of sets the standard for the rest of the person's work.

536
00:26:29,874 --> 00:26:33,435
So like if you can get them to that level of quality that you need very early on,

537
00:26:34,215 --> 00:26:35,436
then they're going to continue with that.

538
00:26:35,476 --> 00:26:39,757
And then I'll dial it back once the writer knows or has a pretty good sense of what they need to do.

539
00:26:40,077 --> 00:26:43,738
I'll dial it back a little bit, although I still do try to read just about everything that comes in.

540
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:49,222
Another thing to keep in mind is try to stagger the introduction of new writers.

541
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:53,065
So if you have any control over how many people are coming on the project,

542
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:57,048
six writers at once, like if you're trying to review dialogues in depth

543
00:26:57,068 --> 00:26:59,549
from six different new writers on a project, you're going to die.

544
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:04,313
So what you want to do instead is try to get one or two dialogues at a time,

545
00:27:04,593 --> 00:27:07,395
or one or two writers at a time, review their dialogues in detail,

546
00:27:07,755 --> 00:27:12,239
and then once those guys are up to speed, then bring in another one or two writers after that,

547
00:27:12,879 --> 00:27:13,800
which will help you out a lot.

548
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:19,032
I used to do postmortems for my managers without their knowledge.

549
00:27:20,593 --> 00:27:24,317
And I would take those things to heart and go, you know what, if I'm ever in that position,

550
00:27:24,357 --> 00:27:26,219
I will not do any of these things.

551
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:32,685
One favorite thing was a fun technique called give a person a lack of expectations and then

552
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:34,307
also give them negative reinforcement.

553
00:27:34,587 --> 00:27:34,787
So

554
00:27:35,007 --> 00:27:39,070
But what I like to do with new writers is quite clearly lay out the expectations that

555
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,230
I have for them for the position.

556
00:27:41,511 --> 00:27:45,954
Also I try and make sure there's already a standards guide and a style guide set up for

557
00:27:45,994 --> 00:27:46,974
writing for the project.

558
00:27:47,495 --> 00:27:51,797
And then Carbine actually had a really cool technique for bringing in their new level

559
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:55,639
designers and world builders where they'd give them a series of very small, simple tasks.

560
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,301
Here's how you implement a small dialogue into the game.

561
00:27:58,341 --> 00:28:00,123
Here's how you implement an inventory item.

562
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:02,044
Here's how you write the description for it.

563
00:28:02,444 --> 00:28:04,005
And these are all very small tasks,

564
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:06,487
but it helped build up the person's knowledge

565
00:28:06,507 --> 00:28:08,769
of the pipeline in terms of how to get narrative

566
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:09,389
into the game.

567
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:15,153
For veteran writers that are mentoring new writers,

568
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:21,242
We had an unusual system where sometimes veteran writers would forget

569
00:28:21,402 --> 00:28:24,025
that they were once new writers, and then they would never want

570
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:25,947
to accept new writers or give them a chance

571
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:28,950
because they couldn't see how that person could ever possibly get

572
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:31,473
to their level, which is a bunch of crap.

573
00:28:32,214 --> 00:28:35,197
So what I like to do is like when you assign someone

574
00:28:35,217 --> 00:28:37,619
to a mentorship position, you remind them that, look,

575
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,342
You know what, you got to the level you were by taking it in stages, so please approach it in the same way with the new writer here.

576
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:51,224
And also, don't be afraid to think you might be insulting them by giving them too much information.

577
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:57,366
Give them everything that you think is even the most basic technique about narrative design,

578
00:28:57,806 --> 00:28:59,687
and make sure you're explaining to them thoroughly.

579
00:29:02,988 --> 00:29:05,310
why you're telling them about this particular technique.

580
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,252
And then I also tell the new writers that, hey, you know what?

581
00:29:08,272 --> 00:29:09,253
They might cross the line.

582
00:29:09,273 --> 00:29:10,754
They might be over-explaining stuff.

583
00:29:10,774 --> 00:29:12,816
But they're doing it in your best interest.

584
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:15,057
And what George was saying about feedback,

585
00:29:16,158 --> 00:29:19,441
generally I try and give feedback very, very rapidly at the outset.

586
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:22,583
And then I start backing off over the course of the project

587
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:24,944
once I see that one particular narrative element

588
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:27,986
or aesthetic is actually, seems pretty solid.

589
00:29:28,427 --> 00:29:29,968
Like it might be like a daily review,

590
00:29:30,008 --> 00:29:31,829
then a weekly review, then a monthly review,

591
00:29:31,949 --> 00:29:33,850
until I feel I can count on that person

592
00:29:34,211 --> 00:29:35,432
to deliver to expectations.

593
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:37,960
And actually, Chris just reminded me, I got another one.

594
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,182
Early on in the project, if you can have some example dialogues

595
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:45,023
that you can give to new writers at exactly the level of quality

596
00:29:45,043 --> 00:29:47,184
that you want them to be, that is super helpful.

597
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:49,845
Because a lot of other writers will, writers are very good at sort

598
00:29:49,865 --> 00:29:51,626
of hitting the mark that you give them early on.

599
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,986
Yeah, actually examples are better

600
00:29:53,046 --> 00:29:54,507
than technical standards documents.

601
00:29:54,547 --> 00:29:55,427
Ideally, you want to have both.

602
00:29:58,204 --> 00:30:02,128
I think it's very important to have that feedback very early on as you say.

603
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:06,912
It can be pretty confronting if you're a new writer coming into a studio to get pages and pages of feedback.

604
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:12,277
But in the end, it's a fine balance between relearning your ego at the beginning of a project

605
00:30:12,337 --> 00:30:15,540
versus eventually coming to the place where you can fight the battles that you want to fight.

606
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,243
And that's what I enjoy about mentoring writers is seeing them at the beginning and saying,

607
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:19,363
OK,

608
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,362
here are the things that need to change and here is why.

609
00:30:22,382 --> 00:30:23,943
I'm not gonna tell you how to change them,

610
00:30:24,003 --> 00:30:25,764
but I want you to change them and come back to me.

611
00:30:26,164 --> 00:30:28,605
And then tell me why you think we needed to do that.

612
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:31,086
And tell me what you think this brought to your writing

613
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:33,868
so that they can start examining their own process

614
00:30:33,988 --> 00:30:37,010
and then they can turn that inward the whole time.

615
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,351
And as both George and Chris have said,

616
00:30:39,391 --> 00:30:40,632
then you move forward and give feedback

617
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,813
less and less frequently until you get to the point

618
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:44,054
where you're mentoring someone and you say,

619
00:30:44,394 --> 00:30:45,915
I think this should change and they say no.

620
00:30:45,935 --> 00:30:47,235
And you go, okay.

621
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:49,257
And that's a wonderful moment.

622
00:30:51,594 --> 00:30:52,996
You guys have anything?

623
00:30:53,216 --> 00:30:54,498
Okay.

624
00:30:54,518 --> 00:30:57,402
And then we'll move on to a very similar question.

625
00:30:57,442 --> 00:30:58,924
A new writer is assigned to your project,

626
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:00,967
but the first question they have is to question

627
00:31:00,987 --> 00:31:02,009
the premise of the game.

628
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,471
How do you mitigate this?

629
00:31:04,292 --> 00:31:04,973
We all wanna jump in?

630
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:09,487
So you may have gathered that I enjoy getting feedback

631
00:31:09,507 --> 00:31:10,127
from other people.

632
00:31:11,188 --> 00:31:13,769
So I would say you want to gather the feedback

633
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:14,689
from these new writers.

634
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:16,970
You listen carefully to them, and you

635
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,371
try and figure out what it is exactly that they

636
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:20,252
are trying to tell you.

637
00:31:21,932 --> 00:31:24,173
But on the other hand, Stephen King

638
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:27,915
once said, if you give 10 people a piece of work

639
00:31:27,975 --> 00:31:29,896
and they all comment on the same thing,

640
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:33,738
you know you've got a problem with that thing. But if they all comment on ten different things

641
00:31:33,998 --> 00:31:38,621
then you're probably good to go. So the important thing is to listen carefully. You get their

642
00:31:38,641 --> 00:31:43,364
feedback because a new set of eyes is always useful. It's always going to help you hone

643
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:49,608
what the message of your story is or what it is you're trying to convey. At the same

644
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:56,012
time if this new writer is unwilling to see the direction of the game and the game is

645
00:31:56,092 --> 00:31:59,254
already well into production and they are unable to get on board.

646
00:32:00,162 --> 00:32:01,824
then you've got to get your producer involved

647
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:03,507
and you've got to start talking to the producer

648
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:04,288
and it's a sad thing.

649
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,351
This game has fundamental flaws.

650
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,372
That's right.

651
00:32:08,234 --> 00:32:09,175
Please identify them.

652
00:32:09,315 --> 00:32:10,917
Okay, those are not flaws, those are intentional.

653
00:32:11,578 --> 00:32:12,239
Will not fix.

654
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,432
Do you guys hear a spaceship outside?

655
00:32:15,592 --> 00:32:17,534
Yeah, there's a...

656
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:18,715
It's just building to a crescendo.

657
00:32:18,775 --> 00:32:19,916
I think it landed, we're good.

658
00:32:20,496 --> 00:32:21,077
Okay, good.

659
00:32:21,457 --> 00:32:23,359
But no, bringing on new writers is always fun,

660
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,159
it's always exciting.

661
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:26,421
And when new writers, you know,

662
00:32:27,242 --> 00:32:28,783
I would hope that they would question, you know,

663
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:29,784
the premise of the game,

664
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,946
because it's in questioning that we learn.

665
00:32:32,647 --> 00:32:34,408
And if they are not questioning,

666
00:32:34,508 --> 00:32:36,490
then they're just collecting a paycheck.

667
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,633
And I want people to be involved in the process and invested.

668
00:32:40,046 --> 00:32:41,527
And if they're not actually asking questions,

669
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:43,387
that doesn't mean they're not asking them to themselves.

670
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:46,048
So it's always better to expose the questions they have

671
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:47,549
and then you can work with them to solve it,

672
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:50,170
rather than letting them go and work on their own

673
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,511
and then perhaps being uncomfortable.

674
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:55,072
Or even worse, going and working on their own

675
00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:56,172
and not actually getting the game.

676
00:32:56,853 --> 00:32:57,033
Yes.

677
00:32:59,774 --> 00:33:02,075
Okay, you're asked to write for an existing franchise.

678
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:03,515
How do you go about inheriting it

679
00:33:03,555 --> 00:33:05,536
and how do you do justice while retaining your own voice?

680
00:33:05,556 --> 00:33:07,757
So, flip side, you're the new writer.

681
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:09,983
Chris?

682
00:33:11,304 --> 00:33:13,845
So we had this challenge with the System Shock reboot

683
00:33:13,905 --> 00:33:15,846
and then other franchises I've worked with,

684
00:33:15,866 --> 00:33:17,627
whether it's like South Park or Star Wars.

685
00:33:18,948 --> 00:33:22,690
So the process we used with System Shock was, first off,

686
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,371
put away your preconceived notions

687
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:27,692
for where you think it should go instinctually.

688
00:33:27,753 --> 00:33:29,553
Just shelve that for a little while.

689
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:36,529
The best way to approach it we found was just go talk to the original creators, see what

690
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:39,730
their intentions were for the project, what they were thinking about the time during the

691
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:45,052
creation of the project, get their feedback, go through all their podcasts or any sort

692
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:49,314
of let's plays they may have done, get a sense for any commentary they had about the original

693
00:33:49,354 --> 00:33:52,275
game, try and figure out if there's any ways you can incorporate any of that.

694
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:56,757
And even though System Shock isn't the best example for this,

695
00:33:57,477 --> 00:34:00,820
Star Wars was where you basically want to make sure you know as much

696
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,481
as possible about the franchise just

697
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,763
so you know what's already been done within the confines

698
00:34:05,783 --> 00:34:06,363
of that franchise.

699
00:34:06,383 --> 00:34:09,465
And you're not just recycling some theme or some quest

700
00:34:09,485 --> 00:34:12,627
or even some storyline that, you know, maybe Dark Horse may have used

701
00:34:12,647 --> 00:34:14,048
or another video game may have used.

702
00:34:14,088 --> 00:34:17,390
It's important that you know as much as possible about that franchise.

703
00:34:19,171 --> 00:34:27,573
During that process, my experience has been that you're going to be left with a lot of questions and a lot of thoughts and a lot of inspiration for where you think things should go.

704
00:34:27,713 --> 00:34:34,995
And that's the moment you sort of find your voice in the franchise after you've established what the foundation is and what the parameters for the game is.

705
00:34:36,955 --> 00:34:38,356
Man, I don't know how to follow all that.

706
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:45,933
Well, I'd say the only thing I could possibly add is definitely look for where you fit within

707
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:46,634
the franchise.

708
00:34:47,174 --> 00:34:48,255
You were talking about Star Wars.

709
00:34:48,495 --> 00:34:51,617
I did a lot of Blizzard stuff.

710
00:34:52,578 --> 00:34:57,000
And you want to have an idea of what your style is, and you want to be able to apply

711
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,782
that style to whatever it is you're working on.

712
00:35:00,302 --> 00:35:05,165
Because as writers and as creators, you need to stay passionate to do your best work.

713
00:35:05,245 --> 00:35:08,508
And if you feel like you have no voice of your own, you're fucked.

714
00:35:09,028 --> 00:35:10,691
You really are, because everything you turn out

715
00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:11,433
is gonna be garbage.

716
00:35:12,274 --> 00:35:14,980
So take your style, find out where it fits,

717
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,603
find the story you wanna tell,

718
00:35:16,683 --> 00:35:18,747
find the way you wanna tell it, and have fun.

719
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:19,749
Have lots of fun.

720
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,322
I would say it's important to find the voice of the project

721
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:25,263
and then as you say, see how your style fits in.

722
00:35:25,763 --> 00:35:27,705
So I have found it very valuable to look at things

723
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,586
that I enjoy, see the voice that they've written

724
00:35:29,686 --> 00:35:32,348
and replicate that, see that it doesn't really work

725
00:35:32,368 --> 00:35:34,909
because it's not my style, and then merge the two together.

726
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,911
I actually really enjoy working on established properties

727
00:35:37,951 --> 00:35:40,493
for that reason, that the challenge of finding the voice

728
00:35:40,553 --> 00:35:42,554
and how to contribute to it in a way that is new

729
00:35:42,614 --> 00:35:43,875
yet at the same time consistent

730
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,596
is something that I personally really enjoy.

731
00:35:46,035 --> 00:35:48,236
And sometimes that research can get pretty specific.

732
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:50,817
Like I didn't realize exactly how many vowels George Lucas

733
00:35:50,937 --> 00:35:53,699
uses when actually describing planets or characters.

734
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:56,140
And embarrassingly enough, I was halfway through

735
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,502
Knights of Republic 2 before I realized

736
00:35:58,542 --> 00:35:59,742
Wookiee is spelled with two E's.

737
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:02,604
And I'm like, George, really, all those vowels, man.

738
00:36:02,624 --> 00:36:03,705
Will you just reign it in?

739
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,746
But you have to adhere to it.

740
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,827
Dooku, God, what a name.

741
00:36:08,127 --> 00:36:08,287
Dooku.

742
00:36:08,947 --> 00:36:11,349
Naming things.

743
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:12,810
Naming things is a skill.

744
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:13,550
Yes.

745
00:36:14,811 --> 00:36:15,291
I don't have it.

746
00:36:15,563 --> 00:36:17,564
Does the Wookiee language even have K's in it?

747
00:36:17,644 --> 00:36:18,244
Anybody know?

748
00:36:18,284 --> 00:36:19,245
Oh, that's a good question.

749
00:36:19,265 --> 00:36:20,986
Now we're going deep, now we're going deep.

750
00:36:21,006 --> 00:36:22,107
I'm gonna be worried about this all day.

751
00:36:22,127 --> 00:36:23,368
But did they call themselves that

752
00:36:23,408 --> 00:36:24,568
or did someone else call them that?

753
00:36:24,608 --> 00:36:25,809
Like you never hear Chewie go,

754
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:26,990
rawr, krr, krr, krr.

755
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:27,410
It's true.

756
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:27,810
No, you don't.

757
00:36:28,731 --> 00:36:29,291
Oh no.

758
00:36:30,012 --> 00:36:30,972
He does roll his R's.

759
00:36:31,793 --> 00:36:33,294
The name of their planet is a hairball.

760
00:36:38,957 --> 00:36:40,758
Bit of a segue when it comes to fixing bugs.

761
00:36:41,238 --> 00:36:43,219
What's the best skill a writer for a game can cultivate,

762
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:43,460
George?

763
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:46,528
I would say attention to detail.

764
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:50,790
You as the writer of the game, and actually Chris was talking a little bit

765
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:55,093
about narrative bugs earlier, you as the writer of the game are

766
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:59,275
in the absolute best position to find inconsistencies in the narrative,

767
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,377
problems with character voices, information flow that's bad.

768
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:04,638
If you go down a certain path, you don't get the same information.

769
00:37:04,738 --> 00:37:08,000
All that stuff, QA, as much as we want them to find it,

770
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,201
is probably not going to find that stuff.

771
00:37:10,821 --> 00:37:13,283
So if you have, to the extent that you have,

772
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:15,565
the attention to detail and the fortitude

773
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:18,448
to go through the entire, all of your work,

774
00:37:18,568 --> 00:37:21,050
read through your stuff, play your game,

775
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,531
pay attention to those narrative bugs,

776
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:25,254
because chances are nobody else is gonna find that stuff.

777
00:37:25,574 --> 00:37:26,855
You really need to think of yourself,

778
00:37:26,975 --> 00:37:27,936
not only as the writer,

779
00:37:27,976 --> 00:37:30,358
but also as the continuity director on your game.

780
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,142
So I'm not actually supposed to be answering

781
00:37:35,182 --> 00:37:37,264
this part of the question, but I'm going to very quickly.

782
00:37:37,444 --> 00:37:37,805
How dare you.

783
00:37:38,607 --> 00:37:43,371
when you are testing your dialogues, make sure you are testing for the suboptimal path of

784
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:47,895
going through the dialogue because you know how your dialogue is going to flow. You know

785
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:51,418
exactly what you want the player to get out of it. So you're going to be like, yeah, okay,

786
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:56,482
test, test, test, yep, it works as designed. But a lot of players are not going to follow

787
00:37:56,522 --> 00:37:57,323
your optimal path.

788
00:37:58,374 --> 00:38:01,337
and you need to follow suboptimal paths through your

789
00:38:01,377 --> 00:38:04,180
dialogues and through your stories to make sure those

790
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,943
stories still make sense if followed in that way because if

791
00:38:06,983 --> 00:38:09,466
they don't, you've got a big game bug.

792
00:38:11,025 --> 00:38:17,932
I'd say be excited. Be very excited by fixing bugs. And if that sounds strange, I really

793
00:38:17,972 --> 00:38:23,178
do believe that. They're like little crunchy treats, honestly, because they always come

794
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:30,626
near the end. Fixing them does a tangible, gives you tangible progress. It feels great

795
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,167
to squash a bug finally.

796
00:38:32,608 --> 00:38:36,430
and then occasionally comes back and you can crush it again and it just feels wonderful

797
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:41,493
and you can say thank you QA person, thank you for finding this bug, I feel good about

798
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:41,613
it.

799
00:38:42,014 --> 00:38:45,316
Plus you get a big list of things in Jira and you can tick them off and you get these

800
00:38:45,336 --> 00:38:46,236
tiny packets of success.

801
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:46,677
I love that.

802
00:38:47,097 --> 00:38:47,597
It's so good.

803
00:38:47,897 --> 00:38:50,759
Because you work on a game for so long, you know, you work on it for two or three years

804
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:54,261
and you're like okay I think this is good and with bugs you can just go yes, I win.

805
00:38:54,937 --> 00:38:57,758
I do, however, like a will not fix in its right place.

806
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:01,079
Working as intended.

807
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:06,822
On that note, we'll open up for audience Q&A.

808
00:39:06,902 --> 00:39:07,743
Oh, wow.

809
00:39:08,283 --> 00:39:08,483
Yeah.

810
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:13,645
We've got two mics, obviously, in each aisle.

811
00:39:13,705 --> 00:39:16,287
So if you're talking like that, you can take the green light

812
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:16,867
off.

813
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:17,427
Don't be shy.

814
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:31,636
Hello, uh, thank you for starting us off so strong. Two questions, one, um, how do you guys

815
00:39:31,896 --> 00:39:37,622
go about, uh, when you're early on in a project and you have the fortune to be actually on a

816
00:39:37,662 --> 00:39:42,567
project early in a narrative capacity and they're still settling a lot of the gameplay stuff.

817
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:48,012
How much, there's some questions about how much setting work you do versus how much story work you do.

818
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:55,098
Like, literally, if you're still doing prototype work, and you don't even know exactly what the game's going to be,

819
00:39:55,518 --> 00:40:00,543
but you're still working on the sides, like, how far do you think it's good to go with setting stuff?

820
00:40:01,263 --> 00:40:05,187
The other question I have is, have you ever been to the Golden Gate Tap Room?

821
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:10,341
you know why i have a very good plan that doesn't look like a tap room is a

822
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:13,965
great place for writers to meet and say that i have around union square

823
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:15,026
something like that you know

824
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:16,307
to create place

825
00:40:16,787 --> 00:40:19,069
the public service and i appreciate that

826
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:22,746
In terms of establishing setting,

827
00:40:22,826 --> 00:40:24,708
if you happen to be on a project very early,

828
00:40:24,728 --> 00:40:27,130
you normally have quite a small team, which I enjoy.

829
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,772
And for me, the way that I go about creating the setting

830
00:40:29,812 --> 00:40:31,813
is I go and I talk to each of the people on the team

831
00:40:31,873 --> 00:40:34,235
about what is important for them in this game.

832
00:40:34,715 --> 00:40:35,896
So what do they wanna say?

833
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,097
What do they wanna experience?

834
00:40:37,137 --> 00:40:38,618
What do they want the player to experience?

835
00:40:38,759 --> 00:40:40,760
And then I look at all of those and see where they connect.

836
00:40:41,421 --> 00:40:42,581
And that's where I start with setting.

837
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:50,435
So most of the projects I've worked on have been in established settings. So like

838
00:40:50,755 --> 00:40:54,978
Planescape, Planescape Torment, obviously we had the whole Planescape campaign setting to

839
00:40:55,018 --> 00:41:00,061
work on. Fallout, we had the world of Fallout. Wasteland, we had Wasteland 1 to work on.

840
00:41:01,141 --> 00:41:06,705
Torment Tides of Numenera, we had the Numenera campaign setting. So when the setting is

841
00:41:06,805 --> 00:41:11,928
prebuilt for you, you can focus mainly on the story. If you are building both the world and

842
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:13,289
the story at the same time.

843
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:19,992
then I would say you probably want the setting to inform the story rather than the other way around.

844
00:41:22,473 --> 00:41:26,415
Yeah, making sure that you have a setting that's very versatile is really important

845
00:41:26,455 --> 00:41:31,117
because you potentially are creating a new IP and you want to be able to create lots of stories in the setting.

846
00:41:31,137 --> 00:41:35,398
So creating a setting around a story is generally not a great idea. I agree with Colin.

847
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:39,760
I can add nothing else except request next question.

848
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:40,860
I agree.

849
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,421
Thank you.

850
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:42,221
Thanks.

851
00:41:44,218 --> 00:41:51,104
Hi. I have a quick question about skipping dialogue, because nobody likes to read things.

852
00:41:51,865 --> 00:41:55,568
So how do you guys deal with skipping dialogue, especially for things like tutorials?

853
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:59,232
Like the ability to skip dialogue?

854
00:41:59,252 --> 00:42:07,059
Well, if a player skips dialogue, right, and it causes some inconsistencies in story because they just never read what you intended.

855
00:42:09,132 --> 00:42:11,273
It does really vary from game to game, of course.

856
00:42:12,214 --> 00:42:15,696
I think you have to know as a writer what kind of game you're writing.

857
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:21,260
Some games are much more action-oriented, and so if you have long dialogue that the

858
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,242
player isn't picking up almost automatically, you've written too much.

859
00:42:24,262 --> 00:42:28,665
I mean, luckily with Torment we had, what was it, a 500 character limit?

860
00:42:28,825 --> 00:42:29,646
People who love to read.

861
00:42:29,706 --> 00:42:32,168
Oh yeah, we had to make different nodes if we wanted to keep talking.

862
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:36,074
So, I mean, that was a glorious project for a writer to work on.

863
00:42:36,274 --> 00:42:43,100
But definitely I'd say, and feel free to jump in guys, know the kind of game you're writing

864
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,784
for and don't try to overwrite because players naturally, and you when you're testing, will

865
00:42:47,824 --> 00:42:49,085
want to skip right through that shit.

866
00:42:49,786 --> 00:42:53,529
And back to what Colin said before about testing the least optimal path, you can also test

867
00:42:53,629 --> 00:42:54,430
the optimal path.

868
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:57,973
So the number one choice in a dialogue, you can just go through one, one, one, one, okay,

869
00:42:58,013 --> 00:42:59,014
what did I get out of that?

870
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,523
some of the tutorialization should be coming through gameplay anyway so some of that is

871
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:11,089
going to be on the systems designers to make sure that that is communicated properly. But if

872
00:43:11,129 --> 00:43:16,793
players are going to be skipping dialogue, then there's not a lot you can do about it except to

873
00:43:16,874 --> 00:43:22,238
try to build in proper tutorialization just throughout the game. So as to reinforce these

874
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:23,159
points that you're trying to hit.

875
00:43:23,805 --> 00:43:28,227
The other thing that you can do if you're playing a game that has a journal is you can lean on the journal.

876
00:43:28,287 --> 00:43:28,987
We do that a lot.

877
00:43:29,367 --> 00:43:34,609
So if players, if you put something important in a dialogue, always make sure it's in the journal too.

878
00:43:34,629 --> 00:43:38,271
Because even if you've got a player who's reading through everything carefully,

879
00:43:38,411 --> 00:43:40,772
something could happen, the cat jumps on the keyboard, whatever it is,

880
00:43:40,812 --> 00:43:43,473
and they somehow miss whatever that critical line is.

881
00:43:43,933 --> 00:43:46,935
So lean on the journal so the player can always go back to the critical stuff.

882
00:43:47,954 --> 00:43:49,975
After watching numerous Let's Plays of my games

883
00:43:50,035 --> 00:43:51,595
and seeing people skip through everything,

884
00:43:52,075 --> 00:43:54,155
I realized that the gameplay choice that you should support.

885
00:43:55,316 --> 00:43:57,436
And also I find tutorials very offensive.

886
00:43:57,696 --> 00:44:00,517
So I always suggest that if you have to do a tutorial,

887
00:44:00,577 --> 00:44:04,118
either you do Half-Life 2's excellent silent tutorial,

888
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:05,818
where they set up a lot of stuff visually,

889
00:44:05,858 --> 00:44:07,758
how to teach you to do certain things in the environment.

890
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:10,119
And also, if you don't have that available,

891
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:12,159
then have the tutorial level something separate.

892
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:13,420
You can play off the main menus.

893
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,520
They can always go back to it

894
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,300
if they are genuinely confused about the game.

895
00:44:17,378 --> 00:44:20,821
Let me add one more thing, because that's an excellent point.

896
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:26,026
Like Legend of Zelda, for instance, Twilight Princess, you're constantly redoing these

897
00:44:26,086 --> 00:44:27,087
things over and over again.

898
00:44:27,127 --> 00:44:30,189
Every time you get a new item, it's like, bam, you've got to go practice this thing

899
00:44:30,229 --> 00:44:30,990
multiple times.

900
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,712
And then when you finally run into the boss, you've mastered it.

901
00:44:34,233 --> 00:44:40,198
So it's really just a question of constantly reiterating through gameplay, because if they're

902
00:44:40,218 --> 00:44:42,380
skipping words, then you don't want to throw more words at them.

903
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:44,222
Thanks, guys.

904
00:44:44,442 --> 00:44:44,662
Thank you.

905
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:50,954
Um, when it comes to designing sort of branching narratives, um, how would you, do you have any

906
00:44:50,974 --> 00:44:59,280
advice around, um, balancing kind of meaningful decisions and branching paths with sort of fear of

907
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:04,523
missing out? And like players who would just create save files after save files after save files

908
00:45:04,564 --> 00:45:05,264
to see everything.

909
00:45:06,572 --> 00:45:07,752
Players are very smart.

910
00:45:08,012 --> 00:45:09,273
They're going to realize pretty quickly

911
00:45:09,313 --> 00:45:11,114
if their choices don't mean anything.

912
00:45:11,694 --> 00:45:13,315
So knowing what endings you can have

913
00:45:13,355 --> 00:45:15,275
that are actually going to affect something later

914
00:45:15,315 --> 00:45:16,956
in the game is the starting point for me.

915
00:45:16,996 --> 00:45:18,137
I need to know where I'm going

916
00:45:18,177 --> 00:45:19,797
so that I can take the player on a journey

917
00:45:20,157 --> 00:45:21,798
rather than designing from the beginning

918
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:23,199
and going, oh, that would be so cool.

919
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:25,120
Wait, I can't do it, and neither can the player.

920
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:32,343
Two things. One is try to be strategic about the choices that you offer to players.

921
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:37,286
So make sure that the choices you do offer have a lot of reactivity.

922
00:45:37,646 --> 00:45:41,708
So if that means, like, based on your budget, if that means you can only afford to do, like,

923
00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:46,331
four big choices in the game, figure out what those four choices are, but pay the heck off on them.

924
00:45:46,371 --> 00:45:48,572
Like, really pay off as much as you possibly can.

925
00:45:48,592 --> 00:45:51,734
Have a lot of things that react to whatever each of those choices is.

926
00:45:52,594 --> 00:45:57,298
The other thing is make sure as players are playing through your game, draw attention to the fact that,

927
00:45:57,738 --> 00:46:02,841
oh, this was, this is happening because you made that choice. Like literally you can say in a dialogue,

928
00:46:03,182 --> 00:46:07,204
well, because you killed that guy, now I'm after you, right? Whatever it is, like draw attention to that,

929
00:46:07,244 --> 00:46:11,067
because a lot of times players won't even realize that they've had a choice that they've made

930
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:16,111
that actually has a big impact on the game, unless you're drawing attention to it multiple times.

931
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:20,153
And that's more likely to get them to come back and play through it again and see your different choices.

932
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:21,660
There's three things you can do.

933
00:46:21,861 --> 00:46:23,503
Usually a narrative, even if it branches,

934
00:46:23,543 --> 00:46:25,305
always comes back to a certain choke point.

935
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:26,947
And you don't want to do that too frequently,

936
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:29,470
but use those choke points to your advantage.

937
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,652
Like that's the moment you can use all the reactivity

938
00:46:31,672 --> 00:46:34,075
that George is describing in a very efficient way.

939
00:46:34,095 --> 00:46:35,958
Two other things you can do is one is,

940
00:46:36,018 --> 00:46:38,621
if you can ever have the reactivity be systemic,

941
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:41,144
but still narrative involved.

942
00:46:42,045 --> 00:46:44,106
One thing we did with the original Planescape Torment is,

943
00:46:44,807 --> 00:46:46,909
no matter what player response you would choose,

944
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:47,930
it would affect your alignment.

945
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,633
That's a really easy thing on the narrative side to juggle,

946
00:46:51,673 --> 00:46:53,334
but yet still have a big consequence

947
00:46:53,354 --> 00:46:54,095
at the end of the game,

948
00:46:54,415 --> 00:46:56,697
in terms of what your final alignment is for your character.

949
00:46:58,118 --> 00:47:02,120
And also, like in the original design for the Tyranny RPG,

950
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,321
we took that one step farther and said,

951
00:47:04,341 --> 00:47:06,202
you know what, no matter what you do in the world,

952
00:47:06,342 --> 00:47:07,742
it's gonna increment this counter

953
00:47:07,902 --> 00:47:09,343
as you become more and more famous,

954
00:47:09,763 --> 00:47:11,464
and then the storyline will come to you.

955
00:47:11,844 --> 00:47:13,365
And that was a really easy thing to do.

956
00:47:13,385 --> 00:47:17,346
Next question.

957
00:47:17,426 --> 00:47:17,566
Hi.

958
00:47:18,109 --> 00:47:21,810
I'm going to preface this by saying that this talk is my favorite eight letter word, producer,

959
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:28,151
because I'm a producer and I'm from an indie company and we've never actually hired a dedicated

960
00:47:28,231 --> 00:47:33,592
writer, you know, small startup company. And my question for you is what are your tips

961
00:47:33,692 --> 00:47:38,293
for someone in a production role that has never actually brought on a dedicated writer?

962
00:47:38,593 --> 00:47:42,574
So we're bringing on a first writer, what are your tips for working with that person?

963
00:47:44,754 --> 00:47:45,414
Lots of whips.

964
00:47:47,605 --> 00:47:49,907
That's a bad producer.

965
00:47:50,548 --> 00:47:52,789
I guess depending on the writer's style.

966
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:55,552
First off, if you're bringing on a new writer

967
00:47:56,092 --> 00:47:58,214
and you have not actually made the hiring decision yet,

968
00:47:58,614 --> 00:47:59,835
make sure you like their writing.

969
00:48:02,477 --> 00:48:04,558
It seems like an important step, but sometimes it is missed.

970
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:06,740
Yeah, some people miss that.

971
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,042
And they're like, oh man, the writing on this sucks.

972
00:48:09,082 --> 00:48:10,323
Yeah, that's my fault, I'm sorry.

973
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:12,685
This guy is so experienced, but he's an asshole.

974
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,906
Also, watch out for that, yes.

975
00:48:15,464 --> 00:48:19,038
Wait, so I'm sorry, you're going to become a narrative producer? Is that what you said?

976
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:21,426
I'm just a general producer. I'm not that fancy.

977
00:48:21,788 --> 00:48:21,928
Okay.

978
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:27,020
I would actually say no whips because I found the worst producers are the ones that

979
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,821
They think their sole job is to go around and beat the numbers and tasks

980
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:32,722
Estimates out of you rather than trying to help you

981
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:38,764
So I think the first question you should always ask with any sort of task or project is if someone's having trouble or you're uncertain

982
00:48:38,784 --> 00:48:39,404
about something

983
00:48:40,124 --> 00:48:45,306
see what it is you can do to help them because then they will what they will be more forthcoming with information for you and

984
00:48:45,826 --> 00:48:50,287
And that's important because usually when you're starting out a project, you don't have any

985
00:48:50,387 --> 00:48:54,509
metrics to work with. So the more data you can start getting from people and the more free

986
00:48:54,549 --> 00:48:58,810
that data flow is, then you can start establishing your own pipelines and task estimates.

987
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:02,551
You're like, oh, you know what, they say that companion will be done in three weeks, but

988
00:49:03,431 --> 00:49:06,372
really, you know, after doing the first one, we discover that's more like five or six weeks

989
00:49:06,392 --> 00:49:09,973
to do it. So now let's make that part of our estimates and realize maybe these other two

990
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,354
companions aren't important and we'll move it off to a sequel or a DLC.

991
00:49:13,154 --> 00:49:16,496
And generally I find that's a better way to approach it.

992
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,617
Show how you're making yourself useful and helpful,

993
00:49:19,097 --> 00:49:20,738
and you're there to help them out with their tasks.

994
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:23,540
I'm going to take in what George said before,

995
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,181
exactly saying getting to know your people,

996
00:49:25,241 --> 00:49:26,782
hiring process is a process.

997
00:49:27,222 --> 00:49:29,363
So getting to know your writer even after you've hired them,

998
00:49:29,803 --> 00:49:30,724
that's really the best thing.

999
00:49:31,224 --> 00:49:33,525
If you were able to find a gathering of writers

1000
00:49:33,585 --> 00:49:34,226
of some kind,

1001
00:49:34,786 --> 00:49:35,926
Oh, where might one be?

1002
00:49:35,946 --> 00:49:37,527
You should probably maybe show up

1003
00:49:37,587 --> 00:49:38,828
and like talk to a bunch of writers

1004
00:49:38,888 --> 00:49:40,569
and just see who you get along with really well.

1005
00:49:40,729 --> 00:49:41,870
Like that's super critical.

1006
00:49:43,163 --> 00:49:45,605
any of the in exile people from the New Orleans studio by any

1007
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:48,986
chance? There are some here but they're at the VR summit. I'm

1008
00:49:49,006 --> 00:49:53,088
from Louisiana. Talk to me afterward. Thank you.

1009
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:56,082
I think one more?

1010
00:49:56,262 --> 00:49:57,123
All right.

1011
00:49:57,163 --> 00:50:00,125
So you mentioned being your own continuity.

1012
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:01,586
Come hang out with us after a minute.

1013
00:50:01,806 --> 00:50:03,907
You mentioned being your own continuity director

1014
00:50:04,247 --> 00:50:06,289
because QA won't find all the continuity bugs

1015
00:50:06,329 --> 00:50:07,189
that might exist.

1016
00:50:07,569 --> 00:50:09,651
How do you think you can help QA to get better

1017
00:50:09,991 --> 00:50:10,952
at finding those things?

1018
00:50:10,972 --> 00:50:12,473
Because obviously as big games get bigger,

1019
00:50:12,813 --> 00:50:14,114
you can't do it all yourself, right?

1020
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:18,036
So how we can help QA find the story bugs

1021
00:50:18,096 --> 00:50:19,517
that they might not know to look for?

1022
00:50:19,577 --> 00:50:20,117
Is that the question?

1023
00:50:20,137 --> 00:50:20,598
Exactly, yeah.

1024
00:50:21,003 --> 00:50:23,604
Okay, so having a short summary of the game

1025
00:50:23,984 --> 00:50:25,565
would be incredibly helpful, I imagine.

1026
00:50:25,905 --> 00:50:27,465
The main thing being you start off with a summary

1027
00:50:27,485 --> 00:50:29,166
and then you write the game and at the end you go,

1028
00:50:29,186 --> 00:50:31,287
where's my summary and does it still match?

1029
00:50:32,067 --> 00:50:33,127
So I would recommend that.

1030
00:50:33,787 --> 00:50:35,828
One thing we would give is we'd make sure

1031
00:50:35,848 --> 00:50:38,349
that QA had a list of all the different ways

1032
00:50:38,429 --> 00:50:40,449
every single quest could play out.

1033
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:42,070
And the reason for that is because sometimes

1034
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:43,450
quests could play out.

1035
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:47,471
incorrectly, but it seemed like they were correct to a player.

1036
00:50:47,531 --> 00:50:48,911
So we make sure that we always specced out,

1037
00:50:49,271 --> 00:50:51,612
here's actually how this quest flow is supposed to go.

1038
00:50:51,672 --> 00:50:54,612
So if any stages are missing from it, that's a bug.

1039
00:50:55,572 --> 00:51:00,213
The biggest thing, in my opinion, is just make sure that you have at least a couple QA people

1040
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:04,354
who are actually reading the dialogue and actually paying attention to the narrative.

1041
00:51:04,374 --> 00:51:05,954
Because I can't tell you how many times there's like,

1042
00:51:06,294 --> 00:51:08,555
QA people have been playing the game for months and I'm like,

1043
00:51:08,835 --> 00:51:10,555
what did you think of such and such a dialogue?

1044
00:51:10,575 --> 00:51:11,315
They're like, uh...

1045
00:51:11,995 --> 00:51:14,117
and because they're just going through it really fast.

1046
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:17,499
So have a few people who are assigned

1047
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:18,619
to actually play through the narrative

1048
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,320
and make sure they understand what's going on,

1049
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:21,961
make sure they're looking at the dialogues,

1050
00:51:22,301 --> 00:51:24,502
understanding what is being written here.

1051
00:51:25,023 --> 00:51:27,964
And if they're confused at any point, write it up.

1052
00:51:28,064 --> 00:51:29,605
Even if they're like, oh man,

1053
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:30,986
I'm sure there's something I'm just missing,

1054
00:51:31,026 --> 00:51:31,827
write it up anyway.

1055
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,987
Because if they're confused,

1056
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:35,188
that means a thousand other people are gonna be confused.

1057
00:51:35,209 --> 00:51:35,289
True.

1058
00:51:35,309 --> 00:51:35,389
Yes?

1059
00:51:35,449 --> 00:51:38,230
Don't forget to mention the door manager.

1060
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:38,390
Thanks.

1061
00:51:39,587 --> 00:51:41,030
Okay, that's it for us.

1062
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:42,892
As you can see, we're gonna be in the wrap-up room,

1063
00:51:42,912 --> 00:51:44,595
which is actually just outside in the overlook.

1064
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:47,019
And we would like to mention that tomorrow

1065
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:48,862
is the launch of Torment, Tides of Numenera,

1066
00:51:48,962 --> 00:51:50,103
on which we were all writers.

1067
00:51:50,123 --> 00:51:51,906
So take a look.
