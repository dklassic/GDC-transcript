You know, you can take an arrow in the knee and still be an adventurer.

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,232
Hello! Since you may not have been able to hear me yelling it across the mountaintops,

3
00:00:18,232 --> 00:00:24,135
did you know you can take an arrow in the knee and still be an adventurer? It's true!

4
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:28,778
Even so, we have some difficult things to discuss about the ways disability is included

5
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:35,261
in games, from how we rarely see it to how when we do it can be quite heavily stigmatised.

6
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:39,783
I'm Cherry Thompson, I'm a games accessibility consultant and I live with various disabilities

7
00:00:39,783 --> 00:00:40,383
myself.

8
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:45,732
I'm looking forward to my session this year where we'll take a look at why representation

9
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:52,058
can be so impactful to players and how we might actively change stigma. I'll be drawing on both

10
00:00:52,058 --> 00:00:58,283
personal and community experience with a number of practical examples of the pits we can clumsily

11
00:00:58,283 --> 00:01:03,928
fall into as games developers. But maybe more importantly I'll lead you through some ideas

12
00:01:03,928 --> 00:01:06,730
for how we can be more likely to get it right in the future.

13
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,232
The talk will be highly informative for narrative designers, writers and artists,

14
00:01:12,232 --> 00:01:17,394
but I believe it's an important area for learning for developers of all disciplines,

15
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:19,275
regardless of genre or platform.

16
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:24,457
So come join me, for you can take an arrow to the knee and still be an adventurer.
