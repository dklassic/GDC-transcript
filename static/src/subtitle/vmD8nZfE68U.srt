1
00:00:01,095 --> 00:00:04,898
Please welcome the chairperson of the Independent Games Festival,

2
00:00:05,398 --> 00:00:06,560
Kelly Wallach.

3
00:00:07,821 --> 00:00:15,647
Hello, and welcome to the 19th Annual Independent Games Festival Awards.

4
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:37,041
So this marks my second year as chairman of the IGF, and during this time, I've felt

5
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:42,106
very fortunate to have had numerous thoughtful and really profound conversations about what

6
00:00:42,146 --> 00:00:45,530
the IGF represents and how much this community means to us all.

7
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:50,735
I feel it's a real testament to how caring and impassioned our industry can be, and it

8
00:00:50,755 --> 00:00:52,997
makes me hopeful for the next generation of developers.

9
00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:53,938
So thank you.

10
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,455
I'd also like to thank the judges and jury members who put countless hours into reviewing

11
00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:10,780
and discussing the games, and a personal thank you to the staff who make all this possible.

12
00:01:19,449 --> 00:01:23,353
Our sponsors for this year are ID at Xbox, the IGF Platinum sponsor.

13
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:32,493
and Samsung, the IGF Gold sponsor.

14
00:01:38,874 --> 00:01:40,735
As an independent games community evolves,

15
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:43,075
we work to reflect these changes in a way

16
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:44,896
that embraces the diversity of games

17
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:46,316
submitted to the festival each year.

18
00:01:47,216 --> 00:01:49,977
This past year, we redefined the Nuova category

19
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:52,657
into one that simply represents art and games

20
00:01:52,998 --> 00:01:55,838
and is meant to further the conversation around titles

21
00:01:55,878 --> 00:01:58,499
that push the medium forward and make us think of games

22
00:01:58,579 --> 00:01:59,139
in a new light.

23
00:02:00,357 --> 00:02:03,859
In addition, I'm very happy to introduce the Alt Control GDC

24
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,141
Award, which will be presented for the very first time

25
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:06,721
on this stage.

26
00:02:06,741 --> 00:02:06,781
Oh!

27
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:07,041
Woo!

28
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:07,121
Woo!

29
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:07,201
Woo!

30
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:07,321
Woo!

31
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:07,601
Woo!

32
00:02:07,622 --> 00:02:07,682
Woo!

33
00:02:07,762 --> 00:02:07,862
Woo!

34
00:02:08,022 --> 00:02:08,262
Woo!

35
00:02:08,342 --> 00:02:08,462
Woo!

36
00:02:08,482 --> 00:02:08,542
Woo!

37
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:08,622
Woo!

38
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:08,702
Woo!

39
00:02:08,822 --> 00:02:08,902
Woo!

40
00:02:09,022 --> 00:02:09,082
Woo!

41
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:09,163
Woo!

42
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:15,006
Woo!

43
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:17,468
The Alt Control Award is given out in association

44
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:19,249
with the independent showcase that's

45
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:20,930
playable on the GDC show floor.

46
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:24,053
It's meant to highlight the growing alternative game

47
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:26,254
controller and hardware community, which

48
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:28,676
represents an important but difficult to sustain

49
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,556
side of the industry.

50
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:33,599
Our goal with both of these changes is to raise awareness

51
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:36,720
and hopefully inspire all of you to think about your own work

52
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,040
in new and creative ways.

53
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:42,601
A few years ago at GDC, I gave a talk

54
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:46,022
which was essentially a short visual essay on community size

55
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:48,083
and the level of informational overload

56
00:02:48,183 --> 00:02:50,063
we're expected to consume on a daily basis.

57
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,695
It was something I gave a great deal of thought to when the games community was experiencing

58
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:58,818
a lot of toxicity, and I thought since now it's moved into a national conversation, it

59
00:02:59,038 --> 00:03:00,939
might be worth revisiting some of these thoughts here.

60
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,203
Studies show that negative emotions have a longer-lasting influence than positive, which,

61
00:03:07,343 --> 00:03:12,386
if you're trying to drive web traffic, gain followers, or become famous, there's actually

62
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:15,708
an incentive to create a positive reinforcement for negative emotions.

63
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:21,117
With access to online communities that can easily be upwards of 50 times more than we're

64
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:25,200
able to meaningfully interact with, not to mention that the entire whole of the internet

65
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,843
consists of about 23 million times this number, it makes you wonder if we're not short-circuiting

66
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:30,524
ourselves a bit.

67
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:36,748
The saying goes, all politics is local, meaning that real national and global change originates

68
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:38,850
in local communities and radiates outwards.

69
00:03:40,232 --> 00:03:44,794
Everyone in this room is arguably at the forefront of an industry that has an opportunity to

70
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:47,636
help shape the way people process and understand the world around them.

71
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:52,798
You have a unique chance to affect long-term social change through your work, and I would

72
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:57,000
argue a responsibility to approach this work from a place of compassion and understanding.

73
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:00,622
This is your community, and this is where you start that change.

74
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:05,084
Thank you all again for your time, support, and contributions to the IGF.

75
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:09,426
And congratulations to all the honorable mentions, and best of luck to all the finalists.

76
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:23,997
And now I'm very happy to introduce the host of tonight's show, Nina Freeman.

77
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:32,985
Thank you, Kelly.

78
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:48,454
I know, I know, I miss Nathan Vella too, but I'll be your host for the 19th Annual Independent

79
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:49,734
Games Festival Awards.

80
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:57,337
Okay, so, let's start again.

81
00:04:57,817 --> 00:05:02,638
Hi, my name is Nina Freeman, I'm a level designer at Fulbright working on our forthcoming game

82
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:03,178
Tacoma.

83
00:05:03,898 --> 00:05:08,180
A demo of Tacoma is actually at GDC in the Day of the Devs showcase in case you're curious.

84
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,651
Outside of Fulbright, you might recognize me from former IGF-nominated titles Sibyl

85
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:19,033
and How Do You Do It, the game where you have sex with your online boyfriend, and the game

86
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:22,194
where you pretend your Barbie dolls are fucking, respectively.

87
00:05:25,795 --> 00:05:26,015
See?

88
00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:27,376
It's like sex.

89
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:33,658
It's pretty weird and amazing to be up here saying this in front of a room full of my

90
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:36,239
heroes and people who are wondering who the hell I am.

91
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:45,551
Listen, I'm nervous. It's not easy being a stage in front of what looks like a million, a million and a half people out there.

92
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:53,694
Listen guys, that was a Trump tweet. I'm not a comedian. This is my first time hosting. This is nerve-wracking.

93
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:55,574
So...

94
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:06,585
I didn't see that. I really wish I could have packed my good luck plushie,

95
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:11,206
but it was just too big and wouldn't fit in my suitcase, and I really wish I had it.

96
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:14,567
I screwed up that joke, sorry.

97
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:19,909
So I know this is super stressful. I had this guy flown in first class just for you.

98
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:25,251
I hope he offers you some some good luck and kill it out there, Nina. Nina, everybody!

99
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,857
That's my poo, soom, soom.

100
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,177
It's my good luck plushie.

101
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:35,858
Thank you, Nathan.

102
00:06:37,218 --> 00:06:40,459
So I remember my first year at GDC in 2013.

103
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:44,180
I sat out there in the audience and took a bunch of selfies

104
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,741
and tweeted some dumb jokes that probably no one read.

105
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:50,182
I had no idea what I was doing as a game developer.

106
00:06:50,662 --> 00:06:52,622
And honestly, I still have no idea.

107
00:06:53,383 --> 00:06:55,683
What I do know is that my process pretty much

108
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:58,644
amounts to the following, as illustrated by Diego Garcia.

109
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:04,373
Go out for happy hour and finally come up with an idea for a game after about two glasses

110
00:07:04,393 --> 00:07:06,013
of wine and a plate of french fries.

111
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:11,194
Frantically write down the idea in my iPhone notepad app in complete darkness and pass

112
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:11,474
out.

113
00:07:12,454 --> 00:07:16,735
Forget that I had the idea at all and find it in my phone a month later.

114
00:07:17,696 --> 00:07:21,296
Work on the game until I get distracted by a new anime.

115
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:30,278
I think my process is bad, and I really don't feel like I know what I'm doing still, but

116
00:07:30,498 --> 00:07:31,179
that's just fine.

117
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,062
It's okay to feel like you don't know what you're doing because we all make different

118
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:39,406
games, we all have different ways of working, and we are all unique as developers.

119
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:44,571
What's important is to create what you want to play, regardless of what other people think.

120
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:48,455
That's what I learned by coming back to GDC and the IGF since 2013.

121
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:51,622
And this year was no exception.

122
00:07:52,382 --> 00:07:54,564
We've got games about connecting with your mushroom-picking

123
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:57,186
grandmother, fucking your brother's classmates,

124
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:58,907
yelling at your friend on the couch

125
00:07:58,947 --> 00:08:02,570
to finish chopping the onions, attempting to seduce Sebastian,

126
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,430
and so on.

127
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,613
These indie developers are really making the games

128
00:08:06,673 --> 00:08:08,975
that they want to play and that many of us

129
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:10,115
didn't even know we wanted.

130
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:14,759
OK, so it's time for our first award.

131
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:18,341
By the way, this Pooh Tsum Tsum is right here next to me,

132
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:19,862
and I'm going to put it down there.

133
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:22,624
So if any of the winners want to give it a hug when they come

134
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:24,305
up here, you're welcome to.

135
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:27,167
OK, so first award.

136
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:31,030
This one is very special to me because I was a student not

137
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:31,631
too long ago.

138
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:34,112
When I was lucky enough to start college,

139
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,814
I was studying English literature.

140
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:39,676
I was a huge nerd that spent all of her classes writing poetry

141
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,137
in various Hello Kitty notebooks.

142
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,982
Little did I know I would eventually pass up a career in poetry by stumbling into video game development.

143
00:08:47,742 --> 00:08:50,563
And I ended up making games in the graduate program at NYU.

144
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:53,003
So, there's no set path.

145
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:58,185
The amazing thing about being a student is that you can experiment both with your work and with your life.

146
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,226
The students we're honoring tonight are amazing examples of this.

147
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:10,128
They're carving their own paths with their work by finding new ways to express themselves in this medium and blowing us all away in the process.

148
00:09:11,432 --> 00:09:13,472
And the finalists for the Best Student Game are...

149
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:46,773
Xiomara Isaac, Jack Yates, Bradford Horton, Campbell Fletcher.

150
00:09:48,493 --> 00:09:50,454

160
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:32,409

Gaspar Morel.

164
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,882
And the winner of the IGF award for best student game is

165
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:59,405
Un Pas Fragile.

166
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:57,538
Okay, this is just a list of people I have to thank.

167
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,482
I didn't think I'd win this prize.

168
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:09,786
I want to thank everyone at IGF for nominating us.

169
00:12:10,086 --> 00:12:13,088
This is like really cool, so thank you.

170
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:15,449
I want to thank the organization,

171
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:21,473
and of course our school in France,

172
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:24,214
Angemin School, if you want to study there,

173
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:27,756
go to the school, it's a public school.

174
00:12:29,257 --> 00:12:29,517
Okay.

175
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:37,240
And I want to thank all the indies and developers out there, making games, playing games.

176
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,741
This is really inspiring for us to be out there with you, so, thank you.

177
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:41,561
Thank you, everyone.

178
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:41,962
Thank you.

179
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:42,362
Thank you.

180
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:42,582
Thank you.

181
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:42,882
Thank you.

182
00:12:42,902 --> 00:12:43,582
Thank you.

183
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:43,922
Thank you.

184
00:12:43,942 --> 00:12:44,222
Thank you.

185
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:44,502
Thank you.

186
00:12:44,523 --> 00:12:44,723
Thank you.

187
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:44,923
Thank you.

188
00:12:48,404 --> 00:12:48,784
Thank you.

189
00:12:48,824 --> 00:12:49,324
Thank you.

190
00:12:49,344 --> 00:12:49,704
Thank you.

191
00:13:00,717 --> 00:13:00,938
Thank you.

192
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:01,458
Thank you.

193
00:13:01,718 --> 00:13:02,339
Thank you.

194
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:04,661
Thank you.

195
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:05,241
Oh, so cute.

196
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:11,907
Okay, so, Tinder is like the hotness these days, right?

197
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:16,310
Shout out to everyone in the audience who's literally browsing Tinder on their phones

198
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:16,931
right now.

199
00:13:17,391 --> 00:13:18,532
I know you're out there.

200
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:23,497
Maybe you're thinking, wow, this person's Tinder pic is like really sexy, damn.

201
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:28,942
Well, what if you ran into one of the game's upper excellence in visual art on Tinder?

202
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,546
These games would probably have no trouble lining up a few hot pictures.

203
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:37,531
In fact, I'm sure they could all land a date on video game Tinder based on looks alone.

204
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:40,694
Can you even imagine the selfies these games would take?

205
00:13:41,194 --> 00:13:43,276
They'd all be well-lit, well-composed,

206
00:13:43,316 --> 00:13:45,678
with striking angles and sensuous curves.

207
00:13:46,238 --> 00:13:47,099
I mean, let's face it.

208
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,320
These games are hot.

209
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,341
These are some of the most beautiful games

210
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:51,162
from the last year.

211
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:55,425
So dating or GDC hostile hookups aside,

212
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:57,307
the artists who worked on these games

213
00:13:57,387 --> 00:14:00,669
are absolute heroes for executing such incredible style

214
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,011
in a medium that can be truly demanding

215
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:04,893
on an artist's time and skill set.

216
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,647

Come closer.

250
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:26,795
Come, get over here.

251
00:16:27,515 --> 00:16:32,797
Hey, I didn't prepare anything, but I just

252
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:35,958
want to say thank you to everybody on the team,

253
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:39,220
including those who couldn't be here, Casey and Sean

254
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,841
and Cosimo and everyone else who helped on the project

255
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:44,142
and believed in us.

256
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:46,423
And I'm going to tear up a little bit.

257
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:54,001
It was a hard, uh, it was a challenging thing to make this game, and uh, we put our hearts and souls into it.

258
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:56,802
And Teddy's taking a goddamn selfie.

259
00:16:59,563 --> 00:17:01,364
Because it ruins everything.

260
00:17:02,244 --> 00:17:07,366
Um, but uh, thank you. This shit means so much to us.

261
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:11,468
And it's, it's, I'm gonna cry so I'm gonna leave the stage now. Bye!

262
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:29,056
Okay, hi, I'm back.

263
00:17:30,197 --> 00:17:33,581
Composing and designing sound is not my strong suit,

264
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:36,544
but I did try my hand at it once in middle school.

265
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,967
When I was probably 13, I made a ton of AMVs,

266
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:42,190
which basically amounted to recording footage

267
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,252
of Final Fantasy X-2, Kingdom Hearts,

268
00:17:44,412 --> 00:17:46,654
and Lafina over trance songs.

269
00:17:54,577 --> 00:17:56,197
That really is from when I was like 13.

270
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:56,677
Okay.

271
00:17:58,438 --> 00:18:04,379
Needless to say, my attempts at enhancing any game or anime with trance music were ill-advised,

272
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:06,480
so now I leave it to the professionals.

273
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,361
Sound can be the ingredient that warms up the game just right,

274
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:14,682
adding a layer that subtly but seriously ties together the entire experience.

275
00:18:15,582 --> 00:18:20,043
I'm also sure that all of the nominees would make way better AMVs than I ever could,

276
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:22,544
and for that alone they deserve massive praise.

277
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:26,198

304
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:00,687
Whoa, shit.

305
00:21:00,848 --> 00:21:00,968
Wait.

306
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:02,670
There you go.

307
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:03,851
There you go.

308
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:04,052
Hello.

309
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:04,913
Thank you.

310
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:06,294
This is incredible.

311
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:09,579
It's such a big honor to be winning this award.

312
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:11,481
We were really afraid we would freeze up,

313
00:21:11,841 --> 00:21:13,724
so we prerecorded this message just in case.

314
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:15,726
Uh.

315
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:18,229
Hello.

316
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:18,530
Hello.

317
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:18,750
Hello.

318
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:18,950
Hello.

319
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:25,885
Well, this is the whole kind of reason why this game was made,

320
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:28,367
sort of the audio anyways, was made in the first place,

321
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:30,008
was we had this little synthesizer,

322
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:32,029
and we thought we had this stupid game

323
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:33,010
that doesn't need footsteps.

324
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,492
Let's make some cool sounds for it.

325
00:21:36,032 --> 00:21:39,295
And here we are, like, one and a half years later.

326
00:21:39,695 --> 00:21:40,195
And here we are.

327
00:21:42,837 --> 00:21:44,158
Thanks to Raw Fury.

328
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:46,740
Thanks to Ditto for making this game.

who's in a cabin in Norway eating rotten fish.

331
00:21:54,134 --> 00:22:00,058
We love you. Thanks to everyone like Alexina.

332
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:03,141
I really want to thank Alexina and Johan Thoreson.

333
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:04,802
Fuck.

334
00:22:08,104 --> 00:22:11,847
And thanks for everyone, all the nominees. It's an honor to be here with you.

335
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:16,550
We're truly honored and thankful and kind of shaking up here.

336
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,613
So have a good night onwards. I'll see you at that party.

337
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:33,365
Hi again.

338
00:22:34,926 --> 00:22:37,487
So before we get too teary-eyed from watching

339
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:39,648
all of these adorable blushing developers accept

340
00:22:39,688 --> 00:22:41,749
their awards, we can spend some time

341
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:42,950
with one of my favorite people, Ash.

342
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:43,310
Ash.

343
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:43,530
Ash.

344
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:43,670

Ash.

350
00:22:52,055 --> 00:22:52,115
Ash.

351
00:22:52,135 --> 00:22:52,195
Ash.

352
00:22:52,215 --> 00:22:52,275
Ash.

353
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:52,355

00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:52,435

00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:52,515

Ash.

359
00:22:52,775 --> 00:22:53,515
Ash.

360
00:22:54,696 --> 00:22:54,756
Ash.

361
00:22:54,776 --> 00:22:54,836
Ash.

362
00:22:54,856 --> 00:22:54,916
Ash.

363
00:22:54,936 --> 00:22:54,996
Ash.

364
00:22:55,036 --> 00:22:55,777
Time to check the bloggers for me.

365
00:23:08,165 --> 00:23:12,268
AHHHHH! FEEDING!

366
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,671
This is a code, Red people.

367
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:18,333
We need to scrap everything we've been doing for Call of Duty 8.

368
00:23:18,953 --> 00:23:20,955
We need that farm money or we're through.

369
00:23:21,195 --> 00:23:23,357
Scrap it, we're way too far into development to just...

370
00:23:23,677 --> 00:23:25,358
Oh my dears! Now!

371
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:29,261
We, we, we could add a farming mini-game.

372
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:30,702
I like it!

373
00:23:30,922 --> 00:23:33,564
But we're a game about guns. Our fans will revolt.

374
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:34,988
I agree.

375
00:23:35,028 --> 00:23:35,728
Compromise!

376
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:35,988
Farm guns!

377
00:23:36,008 --> 00:23:37,850
Play a gun, watch it grow!

378
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,531
Shoot terrorists to fertilize the soil!

379
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:41,012
Circles!

380
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:49,858
Now, what else does Stardew have that we don't?

381
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:53,780
Uh, relationships?

382
00:23:55,061 --> 00:23:55,741
What are those?

383
00:23:56,422 --> 00:23:58,283
They're like, um, you know, when people fall in love?

384
00:23:58,323 --> 00:23:59,084
Like a man and a woman?

385
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:02,426
Actually, in Stardew, you can marry someone of your own gender.

386
00:24:03,427 --> 00:24:04,308
I'm a visual learner.

387
00:24:05,448 --> 00:24:06,309
You too, Kiss.

388
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:09,610
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

389
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:12,332
Yeah, yeah, Bobby Booster.

390
00:24:12,352 --> 00:24:14,453
We're going to collide with Snicker. Yeah!

391
00:24:14,473 --> 00:24:16,334
I'm still missing something.

392
00:24:17,474 --> 00:24:20,736
What else? What else?

393
00:24:20,756 --> 00:24:23,598
Farming's all about kind of investing time and love into something

394
00:24:23,618 --> 00:24:25,319
and watching it grow and in fruition.

395
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:27,139
Right before terrorists take it from you!

396
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:27,740
Uh, sure!

397
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,801
Pre-order now to get the AC-130 drone strike mission!

398
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:59,648
Please welcome to the stage, Alt Control GDC co-founder, John Paulson.

399
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:16,159
Good evening, everyone.

400
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:19,060
I'm very excited to be giving out the first ever

401
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,780
Alt Control GDC award,

402
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,041
honoring this year's best alternative controller games

403
00:25:24,161 --> 00:25:26,861
from the 100 plus submissions and 20 games

404
00:25:26,941 --> 00:25:29,262
featured in this year's popular GDC exhibit.

405
00:25:29,902 --> 00:25:31,722
The spirit of these ingenious designs

406
00:25:31,802 --> 00:25:33,703
is captured in the video playing behind me,

407
00:25:34,123 --> 00:25:35,163
showing this year's picks.

408
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:37,963
This is the fourth version of the exhibit,

409
00:25:38,224 --> 00:25:40,544
and the inspiration for it goes back much further.

410
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:45,817
I grew up during the golden age of arcades, where every cabinet seemed to have its own

411
00:25:45,937 --> 00:25:47,598
enchanting alternative controller.

412
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:52,640
Later, I would hoard more console peripherals than I had shelf space.

413
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:59,783
Nintendo's zapper and power pad, Steel Battalion's behemoth setup, and all of Konami's pioneering

414
00:25:59,844 --> 00:26:00,664
music controllers.

415
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:04,698
More recently, I can recall when I first played sports

416
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,640
with a Wiimote, when I swiped, flicked, and tilted

417
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,341
a mobile touch screen, and when I waved a magic Vive wand.

418
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:14,043
Non-traditional controls are being

419
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:16,024
adopted by developers big and small,

420
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:18,685
and this continues to change how we play games.

421
00:26:20,105 --> 00:26:22,486
Each new way to play elicits a sense of wonder

422
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,647
and childlike inquisitiveness, which

423
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:27,809
is showcased incredibly well by the alternative control games

424
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:29,490
that are honored this year.

425
00:26:30,892 --> 00:26:35,454
Since 2014, over 400 developer teams have submitted for this showcase.

426
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:42,298
Their switchboards, popsicles, pug butts, caterpillar sleeping bags, and Arduino skills

427
00:26:42,658 --> 00:26:46,300
have been transformed into unforgettable hands-on experiences.

428
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:51,623
This year's creations will be playable for the rest of the week at the Alt Control GDC

429
00:26:51,683 --> 00:26:55,386
exhibit in the North Hall behind the IGF Pavilion.

430
00:26:56,447 --> 00:27:00,829
Earlier this week, a panel of judges played through all of this year's games and we're

431
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:07,012
presenting the winner with this custom handcrafted award made by the ingenious Alt Control GDC

432
00:27:07,032 --> 00:27:10,373
alumni and line wobbler creator, Robin Baumgarten.

433
00:27:13,315 --> 00:27:13,935
Thanks Robin.

434
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:23,840
So please join me in congratulating the winner of the first Alt Control GDC award.

435
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:27,900
Fierce Fear.

436
00:28:17,143 --> 00:28:20,671
Well, uh, I don't have anything prepared for this.

437
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:21,071
I just...

438
00:28:21,472 --> 00:28:22,755
Are you sure that doesn't say moonlight?

439
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,421
Okay.

440
00:28:26,242 --> 00:28:26,824
Just making sure.

441
00:28:28,902 --> 00:28:32,462
So I'm really blown away to have won this award.

442
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,623
I mean, we really couldn't have done it without all of us

443
00:28:35,643 --> 00:28:36,643
who are part of this team.

444
00:28:37,063 --> 00:28:40,004
We really want to thank our two product designers who

445
00:28:40,104 --> 00:28:42,424
are lost in the sea of us back there,

446
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:47,705
Jae-Sung and Ying, who both were behind the fabrication

447
00:28:47,745 --> 00:28:48,206
of the game.

448
00:28:49,886 --> 00:28:51,326
And we love what we do, and we're

449
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:54,947
glad that people enjoy our games and have fun with it.

450
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:55,247
So.

451
00:28:56,256 --> 00:28:59,706
We'll be here all week, so come on down and play it.

452
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:01,611
Thanks a lot.

453
00:29:01,932 --> 00:29:02,795
Appreciate it.

454
00:29:02,815 --> 00:29:03,938
Hey, Parsons represent.

455
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:04,479
Yeah.

456
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:36,785
I'm back!

457
00:29:38,505 --> 00:29:39,426
Okay, hi.

458
00:29:40,366 --> 00:29:43,807
I would really like to play Truth or Dare with the Nuovo nominees

459
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:46,168
because they are tonight's featured risk-takers.

460
00:29:46,928 --> 00:29:52,310
I mean, seriously, these people made games that challenge our ideas about what games are and can be.

461
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,210
I actually can't think of a crazier dare than

462
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,711
Challenge the Masses!

463
00:29:56,971 --> 00:30:00,332
Make a game that contradicts their expectations about what video games are

464
00:30:00,692 --> 00:30:03,453
and get ready because some of them are gonna be pissed.

465
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:08,350
I'd like to personally thank every single person

466
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,171
who worked on a Nuovo-nominated game

467
00:30:10,551 --> 00:30:12,972
for your bravery and commitment to making games

468
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:15,413
that are challenging and beautiful examples

469
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:16,953
of the future of this medium.

470
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,398
On that note, here are the finalists for the Nuovo Award.

471
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,680

Isabel James Shasha, Matthew Breganti, Mel Stanchel, Campbell Fletcher.

477
00:31:04,317 --> 00:31:04,818
Everything.

00:31:06,651 --> 00:31:09,093
Developed by David O'Reilly.

479
00:31:10,914 --> 00:31:12,295
Damian D. Vidae.

480

Virginia.

481
00:31:21,361 --> 00:31:23,303
Developed by Variable State.

482
00:31:24,744 --> 00:31:25,844
Jonathan Burrows.

483
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:28,306
Terry Kenney.

484
00:31:30,247 --> 00:31:31,268
Lyndon Holland.

485
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:37,795

00:32:26,584 --> 00:32:30,267
Donkey Kong, Eurydice Moore.

490
00:32:37,494 --> 00:32:38,895
Oh my god, this is really exciting.

491
00:32:40,056 --> 00:32:42,679
And the winner of the Nuovo Award is

492
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:45,681
Oikospiel, book one.

493
00:33:25,949 --> 00:33:29,210
Fuck Trump, fuck Pence, this country's built on immigrants!

494
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:32,372
Fuck Trump, fuck Pence, this country's built on immigrants!

495
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:35,133
Fuck Trump, fuck Pence, this country's built on immigrants!

496
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:40,115
That's it.

497
00:33:41,515 --> 00:33:42,415
Thank you.

498
00:33:43,616 --> 00:33:44,676
Thank you very much!

499
00:33:45,497 --> 00:33:50,058
So I have that one meme to present and then I have a pitch also that relates to the theme

500
00:33:50,078 --> 00:33:51,399
of the game, so I feel like I ought to do it.

501
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:53,080
How much is the money that I get for this?

502
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:57,000
It's like $3,000?

503
00:33:57,801 --> 00:33:58,161
Probably.

504
00:33:58,602 --> 00:34:01,025
Let's say it's $5,000 so I can calculate it better.

505
00:34:01,405 --> 00:34:07,972
The pitch is that everyone in this room and beyond takes 5% of their income and pools

506
00:34:08,032 --> 00:34:13,298
it together into a union that could be called the GPU, General Precariat Union.

507
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:18,756
So that's all. I just want you to think about it, because there's a lot of people who are

508
00:34:18,997 --> 00:34:28,888
struggling to make ends meet. So that's what the game is about. But anyway, thank you all so much.

509
00:34:28,948 --> 00:34:32,912
Thank you to everyone in the room. This has been a really inspiring...

510
00:34:33,913 --> 00:34:38,258
Sort of world to be in I kind of feel like this is I was just telling other people this feels like it's like my

511
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:43,503
School or something. It's like the game school, and it's really wonderful, so thank you so much for the whole community

512
00:34:43,543 --> 00:34:44,924
Thank you to everyone that I've worked on

513
00:34:45,842 --> 00:34:53,447
projects with, you know, thanks Ed, thank you Sean, thank you Fernando for these tools that I made this game with. I didn't have to

514
00:34:53,527 --> 00:35:00,051
program at all to make this, which Fernando made these wonderful tools. Thank you everyone else. Thank you Josh for the

515
00:35:00,091 --> 00:35:10,318
website. Thank you Anissa. Thank you my family. And yeah, thank you all so much. I actually, sorry, I wrote down a few

516
00:35:10,338 --> 00:35:13,420
things on the phone. Maybe I forgot something. I just want to make sure I'm not forgetting.

517
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:21,414
Yeah, oh yeah, Eurydice. It said it's made by Eurydice. I think this is just an interesting thing.

518
00:35:21,434 --> 00:35:26,156
That's like, you know, from the Orpheus legend. Eurydice, this name means wide justice.

519
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:31,818
And justice, we know, is like a both like a moral concept and also like a musical concept.

520
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:34,159
The balance of justice and all these things.

521
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:37,980
Thank you.

522
00:35:40,461 --> 00:35:40,801
That's all.

523
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,781
So I decided to give my mom a call to ask her what she thinks good game design is.

524
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:15,043
She doesn't make games, by the way, and has barely played any of my games, so I thought

525
00:36:15,063 --> 00:36:16,583
her perspective would be pretty fresh.

526
00:36:17,523 --> 00:36:22,524
She told me that good game design basically amounts to pretty art, nice music, and the

527
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:25,345
ability to keep someone's attention for seven minutes.

528
00:36:25,805 --> 00:36:29,846
Because apparently, you can't keep someone's attention for any longer than seven minutes.

529
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,437
I translated this to mean that, for my mom,

530
00:36:33,718 --> 00:36:35,659
good game design is a complete package,

531
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,781
a game that's a solid piece of production

532
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:39,463
and that leaves an impact on the player.

533
00:36:39,483 --> 00:36:42,766
I think my mom would be a pretty good game designer

534
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,287
because she knows what she likes

535
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:45,969
and is ruthlessly committed to it,

536
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:48,571
just like the designers that worked on the games

537
00:36:48,651 --> 00:36:49,852
in our next category.

538
00:36:50,993 --> 00:36:53,215
Here are the nominees for Excellence in Design.

539
00:36:55,217 --> 00:36:56,558

554
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:11,635
Brendan Chung.

555
00:38:11,695 --> 00:38:12,396
Tiny Wells.

556
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:16,898

Kyler Kelly.

559
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:23,101
Alex Attar.

560
00:38:24,222 --> 00:38:25,162
Ben Groves.

561
00:38:30,777 --> 00:38:33,782
And the Excellence in Design award goes to...

562
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:37,269
Quadrilateral Cowboy.

563
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:10,374
What's happening?

564
00:39:10,794 --> 00:39:13,016
Yeah, I mean, this is wild.

565
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:17,440
I didn't really prepare anything tonight because the other games tonight are super awesome.

566
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:26,027
And yeah, I mean, there's a lot of people I want to thank, and this would not have been

567
00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:28,169
impossible without a lot of people.

568
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,192
And I will thank you all personally.

569
00:39:33,815 --> 00:39:38,080
But I'll say that this game took a lot of hard work to make and it took a lot of like...

570
00:39:40,563 --> 00:39:42,605
It was kind of like tough to do.

571
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:45,188
But I think the thing that it took a lot...

572
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:48,932
The thing that made this game possible was just a lot of luck.

573
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:54,447
and a lot of just like being at the right place at the right time and being very lucky.

574
00:39:54,988 --> 00:39:59,270
And so I just want to say that if you don't know what you're doing and you're very confused,

575
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:00,811
that's fine.

576
00:40:02,652 --> 00:40:03,072
Thank you very much.

577
00:40:21,077 --> 00:40:21,758
I'm back again.

578
00:40:21,778 --> 00:40:23,659
Okay, hi.

579
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:26,781
Stories can help us connect with characters

580
00:40:26,921 --> 00:40:28,142
who are unlike ourselves.

581
00:40:28,622 --> 00:40:31,684
They can transport us to worlds that we've never imagined.

582
00:40:32,525 --> 00:40:35,207
They can turn us on and drive us to write erotic fanfic

583
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,247
about our OTPs.

584
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:39,249
On that note, I've been wondering which characters

585
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:41,671
in the narrative category make the best pairings.

586
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,333
However, instead of standing up here

587
00:40:44,373 --> 00:40:47,595
and sharing the lurid details of my most perverted fantasies,

588
00:40:47,915 --> 00:40:49,276
I will ask you to tweet at me.

589
00:40:54,277 --> 00:40:54,757
Seriously.

590
00:40:55,658 --> 00:40:59,821
Because we all know that Twitter is at its best when it's just a mile deep in people

591
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:01,503
going off about the best ships.

592
00:41:02,804 --> 00:41:06,767
Besides giving us characters to fantasize about, the games nominated for excellence

593
00:41:06,807 --> 00:41:12,652
in narrative are fantastic examples of how games are so good at actively engaging players

594
00:41:12,752 --> 00:41:14,434
in story via game mechanics.

595
00:41:15,194 --> 00:41:19,658
These games aren't just spoon-feeding us dialogue, they're exploring new ways of engaging the

596
00:41:19,698 --> 00:41:21,179
player in a narrative-driven design.

597
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,533
The finalists for Excellence in Narrative are.

598
00:41:26,374 --> 00:41:30,297
Excellence in Narrative.

599
00:41:30,677 --> 00:41:34,919
1979 Revolution, Black Friday, developed by Ink Stories.

600
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,481
Navid Kansari.

601
00:41:38,642 --> 00:41:40,043
Vasiliki Kansari.

602
00:41:40,063 --> 00:41:42,384
Every title is off.

603
00:41:44,245 --> 00:41:45,266
Event Zero.

604
00:41:47,427 --> 00:41:49,789

606
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:55,009
Sergei Moha.

607
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,970
Lady Killer in a Bind.

608
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,051
Developed by Love Conquers All Games.

609
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:07,632
Christine Love.

610
00:42:09,132 --> 00:42:09,732
Ryday.

611
00:42:11,132 --> 00:42:12,193
Isaac Shankler.

612
00:42:14,373 --> 00:42:15,153
Virginia.

613
00:42:16,354 --> 00:42:18,394
Developed by Variable State.

614
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:20,935
Jonathan Burrows.

615
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:23,340
Teri Kenny.

616
00:42:25,241 --> 00:42:26,362
Lyndon Powell.

617
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:34,188
One Night Stand, developed by Kinmoca.

618
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,431
Lucy Blundell.

619
00:42:44,496 --> 00:42:48,259
Orwell, developed by Osmotic Studios.

620
00:42:49,921 --> 00:42:50,841
Melanie Taylor.

621
00:42:52,105 --> 00:42:55,387
Daniel Marx, Michael Clu.

622
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:04,691
And the Excellence in Narrative Award goes to...

623
00:43:07,012 --> 00:43:08,053
Lady Killer in a Bind.

624
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:43,040
Well, I'm super nervous. I was not expecting this at all.

625
00:43:44,401 --> 00:43:48,405
I'd like to thank Ryday who is just as important to the team as me.

626
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:53,069
Couldn't be here but he does the art and was super important.

627
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:57,333
I'd like to thank everyone who has been loving and supportive of me

628
00:43:57,874 --> 00:44:02,718
these years and I wouldn't be here without everyone and...

629
00:44:04,593 --> 00:44:09,556
In these honestly fairly terrifying times, I'd like to encourage, please,

630
00:44:10,217 --> 00:44:12,538
look out to other queer developers who are just starting,

631
00:44:12,578 --> 00:44:16,321
and please show them the same love and support that you've shown to me.

632
00:44:16,341 --> 00:44:17,261
Thank you.

633
00:44:34,368 --> 00:44:35,809
Hello? Anybody home?

634
00:44:40,872 --> 00:44:48,658
Well, what do we have here?

635
00:44:49,438 --> 00:44:52,640
Please listen carefully, XXXZEPHOROFFM69XXX.

636
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,881
You are in grave danger.

637
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:55,742
You are the only human left alive.

638
00:44:56,223 --> 00:44:56,843
What are you typing?

639
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,084
Unknown command.

640
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,820
That's not how you spell it.

641
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,620
Xbox, bang titties.

642
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,601
Did you not hear the part where I said you were in great danger?

643
00:45:02,621 --> 00:45:03,821
You got video games on this ish?

644
00:45:03,982 --> 00:45:05,342
You are absolutely going to die.

645
00:45:09,744 --> 00:45:10,544
Fine, fine.

646
00:45:10,884 --> 00:45:11,824
What kind of game do you want to play?

647
00:45:15,566 --> 00:45:16,186
Not like titties!

648
00:45:16,546 --> 00:45:18,867
I have all the IGF 2017 nominees in my database.

649
00:45:18,907 --> 00:45:19,607
Why don't we start there?

650
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:23,308
This is a cyberpunk hacking game called Quadrilateral Cowboy.

651
00:45:23,328 --> 00:45:23,368
It...

652
00:45:24,677 --> 00:45:26,378
I probably should have seen that coming. Let's try a different game.

653
00:45:27,218 --> 00:45:29,419
One Night Stand. It should satisfy your rampant libido.

654
00:45:29,439 --> 00:45:37,402
Oh, Mama. Come to Daddy.

655
00:45:37,482 --> 00:45:38,122
Wait, we're the Freak.

656
00:45:38,142 --> 00:45:40,523
This game is about the aftermath of a sexual encounter.

657
00:45:40,783 --> 00:45:42,704
The Freak has already occurred.

658
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:44,585
Daddy don't want the aftermath, robot.

659
00:45:44,865 --> 00:45:45,805
Daddy want the freaky prequel.

660
00:45:45,825 --> 00:45:46,005
The Freak.

661
00:45:47,646 --> 00:45:48,126
Very well.

662
00:45:48,966 --> 00:45:52,868
You must be 18 or older to enter as a game about being a kid trying to find porn for the first time.

663
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,262
I was doing ASCII porn on my speak-and-spell. Go freaky.

664
00:45:56,842 --> 00:46:00,284
In Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor, you can buy alien porn. Does that satisfy you?

665
00:46:00,384 --> 00:46:03,945
I watched E.T., I got my nut, I'm over it. Freaky.

666
00:46:04,105 --> 00:46:05,786
Okay, this is it. This is all I have left.

667
00:46:06,026 --> 00:46:09,127
Lady Killin' a Vine is a game entirely about sex and relationships.

668
00:46:09,147 --> 00:46:10,128
I said...

669
00:46:10,948 --> 00:46:11,548
FREAKYER!

670
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:12,729
But there's bondage in this one!

671
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:13,049
FREAKYER!

672
00:46:13,709 --> 00:46:15,490
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this.

673
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,371
Spoilers for Inside in 3... 2... 1...

674
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:22,493
May God have mercy on us all.

675
00:46:36,447 --> 00:46:42,951
We are the EverLifter!

676
00:46:43,991 --> 00:46:46,653
Please give a warm welcome to Chris Charla,

677
00:46:47,093 --> 00:46:49,094
Director of ID at Xbox,

678
00:46:49,614 --> 00:46:54,877
and Katie Stone Perez, Senior Program Manager of ID at Xbox,

679
00:46:55,437 --> 00:47:00,100
who will be presenting the ID at Xbox Gaming for Everyone Award.

680
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:15,786
Hey everybody. At ID at Xbox and at all of Microsoft, we're incredibly proud to be able to support the IGF

681
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:21,451
and to help recognize the work that independent developers from all over the world do making games

682
00:47:21,491 --> 00:47:26,996
with truly unique perspectives. One of the things we really love about independent games is that

683
00:47:27,016 --> 00:47:32,760
they can help celebrate underserved voices, whether those voices are the players, the characters, or

684
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:33,841
the creators themselves.

685
00:47:34,745 --> 00:47:38,867
This year we are incredibly proud to honor three amazing game developers

686
00:47:39,287 --> 00:47:42,489
who are truly doing everything to make gaming for everyone.

687
00:47:42,989 --> 00:47:45,890
We invite you all to the Xbox Lobby Bar tomorrow

688
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:48,672
to meet these amazing, innovative creators

689
00:47:49,152 --> 00:47:50,593
and to play these important games.

690
00:47:52,884 --> 00:47:55,926
Having grown up playing sighted games before we lost our sight,

691
00:47:56,266 --> 00:47:59,448
the two of us who started this project were really trying to make the kind of game that

692
00:47:59,868 --> 00:48:02,810
we used to be able to play, the kind of game we missed being able to play,

693
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:07,493
the kind of game we wanted to be able to play again. But we also wanted to make something that

694
00:48:07,753 --> 00:48:10,355
blind and sighted players could both enjoy, something that could

695
00:48:11,135 --> 00:48:13,496
bring us together with that shared experience.

696
00:48:16,634 --> 00:48:20,975
We created We Are Chicago to help people understand the unique challenges of growing up on the

697
00:48:21,015 --> 00:48:24,996
South Side of Chicago by engaging in personal stories that are often left out of portrayals

698
00:48:25,076 --> 00:48:25,557
of our city.

699
00:48:25,977 --> 00:48:29,398
We believe that non-fiction games hold so much potential to change how we think about

700
00:48:29,418 --> 00:48:32,379
the world and could expand both what games mean and who plays them.

701
00:48:32,399 --> 00:48:36,280
I encourage all of you to tell your stories and to help others tell theirs.

702
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,101
Life is going to test you, son.

703
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,223
I Hope is a game created to help children with cancer cope with the emotional strain

704
00:48:46,243 --> 00:48:50,946
of the disease by showing them the power they have within and encourage them in the fight

705
00:48:50,966 --> 00:48:51,586
of their lives.

706
00:48:52,206 --> 00:48:56,269
Our goal is to help kids through another day, show parents a light at the end of the tunnel,

707
00:48:56,569 --> 00:49:00,111
and give families a message of hope when they need it the most.

708
00:49:04,364 --> 00:49:07,848
If you could all direct your attention over there and please give a warm round of applause

709
00:49:07,888 --> 00:49:11,152
to the winners of the ID and Xbox Gaming Forever Win Awards.

710
00:49:11,392 --> 00:49:12,734
Thanks a lot guys, you guys are awesome.

711
00:49:51,394 --> 00:49:53,235
I'm back. You can't get rid of me.

712
00:49:55,775 --> 00:50:01,116
So sometimes a game comes out that brings us together online

713
00:50:01,196 --> 00:50:03,697
because literally everyone on Twitter is screaming about it

714
00:50:04,037 --> 00:50:06,418
and the tumblr tag is overflowing with adoring fan

715
00:50:06,498 --> 00:50:08,998
art and then we're all inevitably absorbed into the

716
00:50:09,038 --> 00:50:11,959
fandom fold because the love is so severely contagious.

717
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:14,720
This is at the heart of the audience award.

718
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,640
It's an award that can give us something to agree about.

719
00:50:18,563 --> 00:50:22,326
So congratulations to our next recipient for being so lovable

720
00:50:22,706 --> 00:50:25,948
and for captivating us in a way that so few games can.

721
00:50:27,549 --> 00:50:29,851
The Audience Award for 2017 goes to Hyper Light Drifter.

722
00:50:59,644 --> 00:51:03,088
I stole this award last time because I went that way and took it to the table, so I'm

723
00:51:03,108 --> 00:51:05,691
going to make sure I don't do that this time.

724
00:51:06,112 --> 00:51:07,313
Somebody else talk, please.

725
00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:10,795
No, I didn't even bring my phone.

726
00:51:13,797 --> 00:51:14,617
Okay, thank you all.

727
00:51:15,977 --> 00:51:19,659
What I love about this community is that it feels, honestly, like every winner that comes

728
00:51:19,759 --> 00:51:21,539
up, like the whole room made that game.

729
00:51:21,739 --> 00:51:25,001
Maybe that's a cliche to say, but it's a very beautiful feeling.

730
00:51:25,021 --> 00:51:26,141
I'm very grateful.

731
00:51:26,161 --> 00:51:27,422
I know we all are for being here.

732
00:51:27,922 --> 00:51:29,782
Thank you all for playing our game.

733
00:51:30,423 --> 00:51:34,924
People cumulatively have spent 387 years of time playing our game, and it's really fucked

734
00:51:34,984 --> 00:51:35,445
up and cool.

735
00:51:37,879 --> 00:51:39,541
Did the math yeah

736
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:43,705
Yeah, I just don't I don't want to cry on stage again. So thank you everybody. It means a lot

737
00:52:00,894 --> 00:52:06,898
Please give a warm IGF welcome to the winner of last year's Seamus McNally Grand Prize

738
00:52:06,938 --> 00:52:09,639
Award, Sam Barlow.

739
00:52:19,725 --> 00:52:20,345
Hi everyone.

740
00:52:20,946 --> 00:52:21,526
This is nice.

741
00:52:21,546 --> 00:52:22,026
I remember this.

742
00:52:22,066 --> 00:52:22,486
This is fun.

743
00:52:24,211 --> 00:52:28,092
I stole a disproportionate amount of time on stage last year, so I'm going to keep this really short.

744
00:52:29,092 --> 00:52:32,754
Indie games are more important than their diminutive name implies.

745
00:52:32,914 --> 00:52:34,174
Just look at the last decade.

746
00:52:34,574 --> 00:52:37,975
Look at the games that moved the needle, that took our medium forward.

747
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:42,236
More and more indie games are asked to do this and are driven to do this.

748
00:52:42,476 --> 00:52:46,638
We're finding broader audiences and we're speaking more deeply to those audiences.

749
00:52:47,158 --> 00:52:51,019
We care about diversity, about heart and authenticity.

750
00:52:51,699 --> 00:52:54,279
And this award, the Seamus McNally Grand Prize,

751
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,380
is the one that encapsulates all of this.

752
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,720
I was incredibly proud to receive this award last year

753
00:53:00,101 --> 00:53:02,941
and even more proud to now present it to the game

754
00:53:02,961 --> 00:53:05,982
that myself and all the other IGF judges have decided

755
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,502
represents the best of our collective achievements.

756
00:53:09,363 --> 00:53:11,223
With that in mind, here are the finalists

757
00:53:11,303 --> 00:53:13,423
for the Seamus McNally Grand Prize.

758
00:53:14,907 --> 00:53:17,028

Aaron Milcher.

Eric Ferroni.

00:54:51,068 --> 00:54:52,970
Okay, and the winner is...

782
00:54:57,014 --> 00:54:58,276
Quadrilateral Cowboy.

783
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:22,829
Uh, thank you. This is, uh...

784
00:55:36,494 --> 00:55:38,595
I actually literally don't know what to say.

785
00:55:38,975 --> 00:55:42,056
This is... this is... I don't... yeah, yeah.

786
00:55:43,536 --> 00:55:46,998
Thank you so much. This is unbelievable. Thank you so much.

787
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,220
Wow, that was awesome.

788
00:56:15,442 --> 00:56:18,664
So as we near the end of the IGF awards,

789
00:56:19,064 --> 00:56:20,065
I can't believe it's almost over.

790
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,506
It's gone by so fast for me.

791
00:56:22,607 --> 00:56:24,688
I'd like to give some personal recognition

792
00:56:24,768 --> 00:56:27,290
to devs who didn't necessarily fit into any

793
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:28,591
of these main categories.

794
00:56:29,992 --> 00:56:32,534
The dev who couldn't make it to GDC because they just

795
00:56:32,554 --> 00:56:34,955
don't have the cash, I'm rooting for you,

796
00:56:35,175 --> 00:56:37,497
and I hope your next game sells like beanie babies.

797
00:56:38,913 --> 00:56:40,875
The dev who had to stay home with their kids.

798
00:56:41,655 --> 00:56:44,298
I hope you're treating yourself to hot chocolate and anime.

799
00:56:44,498 --> 00:56:45,759
Hopefully Yuri on Ice.

800
00:56:49,102 --> 00:56:51,664
All of the developers impacted by the Muslim ban.

801
00:56:52,304 --> 00:56:53,045
I'm thinking of you.

802
00:57:10,313 --> 00:57:13,375
And on that note, I urge everyone to donate to the ACLU.

803
00:57:13,395 --> 00:57:14,295
Please.

804
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:26,882
Also, the student who has imposter syndrome

805
00:57:27,162 --> 00:57:29,283
and didn't come out to GDC because they don't think

806
00:57:29,303 --> 00:57:30,764
they're a real game developer.

807
00:57:31,244 --> 00:57:31,925
Trust me, honey.

808
00:57:31,985 --> 00:57:33,526
You're just as real as any of us,

809
00:57:33,606 --> 00:57:36,287
regardless of how many games you've shipped or not shipped.

810
00:57:45,322 --> 00:57:50,048
The woman who doesn't have the energy to make it to GDC because she's busy kicking ass,

811
00:57:50,408 --> 00:57:52,851
making games, and raising money for Planned Parenthood.

812
00:57:53,252 --> 00:57:55,595
You are amazing and you are going to change the world.

813
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:08,311
You guys are cheering for all the best stuff.

814
00:58:08,331 --> 00:58:11,272
OK, I want to thank those devs I just mentioned

815
00:58:11,412 --> 00:58:13,694
and everyone else who deserves some encouragement.

816
00:58:14,274 --> 00:58:16,075
This is a huge industry we're in,

817
00:58:16,315 --> 00:58:18,296
and there are so many different kinds of people

818
00:58:18,376 --> 00:58:20,777
working their asses off to make the games that

819
00:58:20,817 --> 00:58:22,899
will push this medium farther into places

820
00:58:22,939 --> 00:58:24,279
that we can't even imagine.

821
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:29,760
The folks we've seen receive awards tonight are at the forefront of this forward momentum.

822
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:35,066
They know what it means to strike out on their own and to take a risk by making games that

823
00:58:35,126 --> 00:58:36,208
experiment with the medium.

824
00:58:37,049 --> 00:58:40,133
They've shown us all how much more we can do with video games.

825
00:58:41,294 --> 00:58:44,818
I encourage everyone in this audience to play these games if you haven't already.

826
00:58:45,212 --> 00:58:47,934
please support these game makers so that they can continue

827
00:58:47,974 --> 00:58:50,436
to show us how games can be made outside of the mold,

828
00:58:50,876 --> 00:58:53,878
so that they can continue to defy traditional expectations

829
00:58:53,918 --> 00:58:57,081
of how games are made, who makes them, and what they can be.

830
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:00,283
I'd like to congratulate and thank the winners

831
00:59:00,383 --> 00:59:02,525
and the nominees tonight for making these games.

832
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:05,147
Can we please give them all a round of applause

833
00:59:05,187 --> 00:59:06,968
for their hard work and brilliant ideas?

834
00:59:23,137 --> 00:59:28,740
Finally, I'd like to give special thanks to my boyfriend, Mike, who put up with me preparing

835
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,921
for this for months, and I was very intense about it.

836
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:31,781
Thank you.

837
00:59:33,842 --> 00:59:34,362
Yay!

838
00:59:35,023 --> 00:59:39,885
And also to the sponsors who helped make this show spectacular so that we can spend our

839
00:59:39,965 --> 00:59:43,446
evening dazzled by a bunch of adorable developers getting teary-eyed on stage.

840
00:59:43,466 --> 00:59:43,727
Thank you!

841
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:43,947
Thank you!

842
00:59:43,967 --> 00:59:44,267
Thank you!

843
00:59:46,648 --> 00:59:46,828
Thank you!

844
00:59:46,848 --> 00:59:47,108
Thank you!

845
00:59:47,128 --> 00:59:47,308
Thank you!

846
00:59:47,328 --> 00:59:47,508
Thank you!

847
00:59:47,528 --> 00:59:47,708
Thank you!

848
00:59:51,537 --> 00:59:55,678
So thanks to ID at Xbox for being the IGF Platinum sponsor

849
00:59:55,938 --> 00:59:58,379
and Samsung for being the IGF Gold sponsor.

850
00:59:58,399 --> 01:00:03,141
Thank you.

851
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:09,124
On that note, this emotional roller coaster is not over.

852
01:00:09,744 --> 01:00:12,065
Please stick around and help us honor and recognize

853
01:00:12,145 --> 01:00:13,826
even more incredible game makers,

854
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:17,047
because the Game Developers Choice Awards are up next.

855
01:00:26,345 --> 01:00:26,405
you
