1
00:00:06,431 --> 00:00:06,991
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:11,053
If you could please turn off any mobile phones and noisemakers

3
00:00:11,073 --> 00:00:12,274
before we get started, that'd be great.

4
00:00:13,354 --> 00:00:15,435
But I think it's time to get into my talk, which

5
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:16,756
is architecture for level design.

6
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:18,797
I'm Claire Hosking.

7
00:00:19,077 --> 00:00:20,277
I've got a master's of architecture

8
00:00:20,297 --> 00:00:21,878
and a bachelor's of design in architecture.

9
00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:24,019
I've written for Polygon in the past,

10
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:26,680
and I make my own games based on procedural architecture

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,261
and that kind of thing.

12
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:32,982
So what I'm going to talk to you today is about how level designers, how architectural

13
00:00:33,022 --> 00:00:37,163
design can help level designers achieve their intended mood and add depth to their levels.

14
00:00:37,423 --> 00:00:40,283
And since I don't know what kind of activities you want to put in your game, I'm going to

15
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:43,644
presume that it's not going to be combat necessarily or puzzles or story pickups.

16
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:46,264
I'm just going to focus on making individual spaces worthwhile.

17
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:53,425
So the first thing I was thinking about when making this talk is what would be most useful

18
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:55,526
to you because architecture covers a lot of different things.

19
00:00:56,945 --> 00:00:58,365
So what I really want to focus on

20
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:00,626
is the kind of geometry and layout design

21
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,407
that level designers do, and how you

22
00:01:02,427 --> 00:01:04,948
can use that to kind of emphasize and accentuate

23
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:11,231
materials and all those later stages of the design process.

24
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:15,793
Whoops, wrong button.

25
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:19,294
So basic considerations.

26
00:01:19,765 --> 00:01:23,227
One of the great qualities that brings mood to space

27
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:25,829
and to cities is the typology of cities.

28
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:30,213
The typology of cities is the layout of the city

29
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:32,715
and the pattern that it adopts in response

30
00:01:32,815 --> 00:01:36,317
to all the considerations that people have around them.

31
00:01:36,398 --> 00:01:39,660
So the weather, the topology, all of that kind of thing.

32
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:42,362
But all of these things tend to relate

33
00:01:42,462 --> 00:01:45,645
to some basic considerations about space, circulation,

34
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:47,946
psychological comfort, and visual interest.

35
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:54,818
So this is from a 1979 study by urbanist William H. White

36
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:56,099
called the Street Life Project.

37
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,521
They went out and studied and mapped

38
00:01:58,561 --> 00:01:59,802
how people use public space.

39
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:01,804
And they produced an excellent documentary

40
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:03,605
called The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces,

41
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,407
which I'd really recommend watching

42
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:06,628
if you ever want to create a city

43
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,548
as part of your level design.

44
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:10,772
And what they found is that when people are standing or sitting,

45
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:12,573
they tend to pull back towards the edge of spaces.

46
00:02:13,014 --> 00:02:14,636
They like to put their back against something safe,

47
00:02:14,856 --> 00:02:16,498
and they like to look outwards towards a vista.

48
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:19,621
And interestingly, the most interesting vista for them

49
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,582
to watch is other people.

50
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:22,384
And we also know that when people

51
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:24,586
want to go between two places, they go in a straight line.

52
00:02:25,307 --> 00:02:27,289
So one of the most successful urban spaces

53
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,451
has a main direct route between two parts.

54
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:31,692
which has people all walking along it,

55
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:34,034
and then at the edges it has somewhere for people to sit,

56
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,035
and then behind that it has a defined edge,

57
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:37,795
and people will come there and sit there

58
00:02:37,835 --> 00:02:38,836
and watch the world go by.

59
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:40,837
And if it's a less linear space,

60
00:02:41,217 --> 00:02:42,778
say more of a plaza or a park,

61
00:02:43,678 --> 00:02:45,779
you can put other activities as central focus,

62
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:47,300
like a fountain or an ice cream cart

63
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,281
or a ball game, et cetera.

64
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:50,462
And people will take the focus

65
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:51,522
if there's something for them to do.

66
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:55,244
And this typology tends to repeat itself at all levels.

67
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:58,202
A room is organized around a focus.

68
00:02:58,482 --> 00:02:59,984
Those rooms organized around a focus.

69
00:03:00,324 --> 00:03:03,126
Houses cluster around a street or a square.

70
00:03:03,927 --> 00:03:06,409
And plazas and cities kind of organized

71
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:07,349
around the center of the city.

72
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,312
And you can break up all of those

73
00:03:10,512 --> 00:03:12,794
into small units of implied rooms and that kind of thing.

74
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,936
So if you're looking to make passively interesting space

75
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:18,398
in a game that functions like real spaces do, you can use this.

76
00:03:18,718 --> 00:03:21,420
And so if the player is a spectator, they go to the edge.

77
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,102
And if they're a traveler or an activator,

78
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:23,822
they go to the center.

79
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:27,013
Architects tend to summarize these factors

80
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,014
into the idea of positive and negative space.

81
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:34,635
So positive space is this well-defined space

82
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,416
that has an organizing focal point.

83
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:39,437
And negative space tends to be leftover space, ill-defined,

84
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:42,397
often concave space with no real organizing

85
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:43,378
focal point or axis.

86
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:46,458
And roughly, people feel comfortable in positive space,

87
00:03:46,798 --> 00:03:48,659
and they tend to move on and feel a bit uncomfortable

88
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:49,319
in negative space.

89
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,079
So this also works in video games.

90
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:55,180
So here's a good example from The Walking Dead,

91
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,541
where negative space is used to kind of disconcert the player.

92
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:01,242
It's not just the emptiness and the abandoned cars

93
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,443
and the sickly green tinge, like the art direction, that's

94
00:04:03,503 --> 00:04:05,064
producing the sense of desolateness here.

95
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:07,985
There's this amorphous, ill-defined space

96
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:10,646
of the suburbs that creates a sense of unease

97
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:12,146
and that you want to move along from.

98
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:14,407
And the urban design has no direction to it.

99
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:16,928
And that's perfect, because this is a particular part

100
00:04:16,948 --> 00:04:18,089
in this game where the player doesn't

101
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:18,709
know where they should go.

102
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:21,951
And so this is kind of showing you

103
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:26,175
that it's like the layout itself creates the mood.

104
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:27,777
It's not just the accoutrements of home,

105
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:29,058
which already feel very familiar.

106
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,123
It's kind of the space that you move through

107
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:35,385
that's able to set a lot of the tone.

108
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:37,948
So in order to do this.

109
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:43,563
William talked a little bit about how architects use the idea of a party,

110
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,824
which is a diagram that shows the organization of space.

111
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:48,724
And it can show just the physical layout of space,

112
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:51,305
but it can also express kind of the tonal layout of space,

113
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,966
and what approach you'll be using.

114
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:57,467
So this is by Peter Zumthor.

115
00:04:57,507 --> 00:05:00,007
It's the party for the thermal baths at Vals,

116
00:05:00,787 --> 00:05:04,528
which is generally regarded as a modern masterpiece of mood and tone.

117
00:05:06,364 --> 00:05:08,525
So it establishes the original diagram,

118
00:05:08,565 --> 00:05:10,006
establishes the sense of heaviness

119
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:11,127
that he's trying to achieve, which

120
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:13,968
translates into these rooms that are designed

121
00:05:14,328 --> 00:05:16,729
as solid blocks that have been inserted into the plan,

122
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,830
and then smaller spaces carved out of them.

123
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,352
So the layout itself has a solidity to it

124
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:25,353
that is then reinforced by the way

125
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:26,474
the materials have been treated.

126
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,155
And the layout itself allows the materials

127
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:28,975
to be treated like that.

128
00:05:32,974 --> 00:05:36,296
So party helps you consider if you want the qualities of space

129
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:39,359
to be like boxy, or amalgamations, or iconic,

130
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,600
or woven, or folded, or piled up,

131
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,562
and the way that affects the way the player interacts

132
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:46,844
with the world and the qualities of space and play.

133
00:05:47,924 --> 00:05:52,207
So architecture creates meaning through atmosphere

134
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:54,929
rather than symbolism, as I was talking before about the focus

135
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:59,172
of the domestic qualities.

136
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:03,485
It's not so much about, like, you

137
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:05,546
can see that the houses have gabled roofs

138
00:06:05,586 --> 00:06:06,226
and that kind of thing.

139
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:11,448
It's more about the geometry, the material, the texture,

140
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:13,749
creating quite a domestic space that

141
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:15,389
sets the necessary tone for the audience,

142
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,830
like if that was something you wanted to achieve.

143
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:22,372
So here's a really good example.

144
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:25,037
This is also by Peter Zontor, who

145
00:06:25,137 --> 00:06:26,539
is a well-known architect.

146
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,743
He's won the Pritzker Prize, which

147
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:30,746
is like the big, you're a great architect prize.

148
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,070
It's a lifetime award for your work.

149
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,392
He's also one of my favorite architects.

150
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,426
And so this is Brutaclaus Field Chapel.

151
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:43,349
This is a chapel for shepherds.

152
00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:44,329
It's in the middle of a field.

153
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,473
There's no way that you can put priests in it, or put bells,

154
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:52,574
or any of that kind of thing to tell you what it's for.

155
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:57,097
So how does Zumthor use space, and design,

156
00:06:57,457 --> 00:07:00,038
and that kind of thing to create something

157
00:07:00,078 --> 00:07:02,460
that feels suitably sacred and draw people to it?

158
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:06,634
So firstly, rather than create a steeple and a pitched roof

159
00:07:06,654 --> 00:07:09,457
with a cross on top, it uses this warm and mysterious form

160
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:10,158
to attract people.

161
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,081
I think this was something that Journey understood really well,

162
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:15,743
is it's one thing to make it really clear where

163
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:17,704
your player has to go, but it's another thing

164
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:18,725
to make it really inviting.

165
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:22,749
And in order to get people to go somewhere, as an architect,

166
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:24,410
I can't use horror or urgency.

167
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,473
I can't damsel their loved ones or give people fetch quests.

168
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:33,597
So, Zunto chooses a strategy that's much more about sneak peeks and arousing curiosity about

169
00:07:33,617 --> 00:07:36,659
what's up there and how the next corner might change your perceptions.

170
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:42,158
So this curiosity here is created

171
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:44,399
by the tapered corners, which show the mass

172
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:45,939
and make it obvious that there's something in there,

173
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,079
inviting us to circle around.

174
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,240
It's very relative, but in our culture,

175
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,561
this kind of simple unit with shallow angles

176
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:53,322
can have a kind of arcane connotations.

177
00:07:54,222 --> 00:07:56,463
You can see this used in other chapels,

178
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:59,364
but also video games that are trying to go for something

179
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:00,544
that feels quite otherworldly.

180
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,058
In the Rothko Chapel, it's used to kind of generate this platonic ideal of worship that

181
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:11,262
is transcendent across different religions.

182
00:08:12,977 --> 00:08:15,558
And so yeah, these geometries kind of hint at otherworldliness.

183
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:19,200
So similarly, it leaves off decorative detail.

184
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,481
And while detail is used a lot in games to do environmental storytelling

185
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:25,663
and to clue players into what era and class your world is set in,

186
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:30,325
leaving it off, likewise, creates the ambiguity and the mystery here

187
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,287
that's drawing you towards it, because you don't know how modern or ancient it might be,

188
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,608
what culture or group it belongs to just yet.

189
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,380
And likewise, the soft indents and texture

190
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,561
are beautifully human scaled.

191
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:45,668
And that kind of plays into having left all that off

192
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,151
and having used quite simple forms.

193
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:48,092
It allows that to shine.

194
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:55,823
Rather than use a more traditional church or cathedral

195
00:08:55,843 --> 00:08:58,404
door, some use almost this sci-fi door.

196
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:01,126
And in a nice piece of attention directing,

197
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:03,347
rather than using the red flashing light where

198
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:05,068
the detail shows you where the door is,

199
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:07,449
the door is actually pointing you towards the detail.

200
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,071
Because this is not about knowing

201
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:12,272
where the next place to go is.

202
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:16,294
It's about taking in each point along your journey.

203
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:22,266
And so, so far, it's used kind of the position, the color,

204
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:23,787
the shaping, the formal arrangement

205
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:27,512
of the dots on the outside to express that there's

206
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:28,012
something here.

207
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:29,153
It contains something.

208
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:30,515
And that it's Christian.

209
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,720
And it's within the next step is that you step inside.

210
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,203
And it's full of stars.

211
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:42,759
This is probably, these are all the little holes

212
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,002
that are left over when you build something out of concrete.

213
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:47,863
You have to put ties through

214
00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:49,344
between both sides of the formwork.

215
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:52,006
And Zumthor has chosen to leave them open

216
00:09:52,227 --> 00:09:55,689
to create this kind of, this sense of infinite space

217
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,532
and like deep kind of meaningfulness.

218
00:10:00,673 --> 00:10:02,755
It's probably the most literally holy chapel in the world.

219
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:07,725
Sorry.

220
00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:14,710
And as you can see, there's not a whole lot of traditional Christian tribal

221
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,190
civilism.

222
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,471
No boats, no fish, no doves.

223
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:21,215
Instead, the architecture itself points directly at the sky.

224
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:26,158
The sloping fluted walls carry the eye upwards, and the dark starry interior suggests an endless

225
00:10:26,238 --> 00:10:26,639
universe.

226
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:32,703
And you can see the thick, heavy walls and poured iron covering on the floor, which you

227
00:10:32,723 --> 00:10:33,404
might be able to see there.

228
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:40,000
create this sense of meditative weightiness that settles the space and encourages you to dwell.

229
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:45,148
So the form making itself accentuates all these materials that have come in

230
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:47,972
and it creates an experience for the player all on its own.

231
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:55,412
So the carved space cannot be taken from one vantage point.

232
00:10:55,452 --> 00:10:56,892
It's impossible to stand back and find

233
00:10:57,013 --> 00:10:58,553
one position where the whole space is framed.

234
00:10:58,593 --> 00:10:59,613
It pushes you too close.

235
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:01,333
So you have to actively construct

236
00:11:01,373 --> 00:11:02,954
a mental image of the space, and it can only

237
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:03,814
exist inside your head.

238
00:11:04,274 --> 00:11:06,554
And this itself kind of gestures towards the ephemeral

239
00:11:07,174 --> 00:11:10,215
and the idea of something that exists

240
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:10,935
on a different plane.

241
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:14,396
And so, yeah, so this is how architecture

242
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,356
can create a sense of space without necessarily all

243
00:11:16,396 --> 00:11:17,896
the symbolism.

244
00:11:20,377 --> 00:11:22,558
And there are games that do this really well, too.

245
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,079
So for instance, if you look at the way

246
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,200
that the idea of home is portrayed in Last of Us

247
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,662
and Soma, you might notice the first level layouts.

248
00:11:30,742 --> 00:11:32,342
I've only got the Last of Us here, unfortunately.

249
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:35,704
You might notice that the first level layouts are rectilinear,

250
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,005
not much interpenetration or variation in the volumes.

251
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,446
Pretty clean, simple, familiar, generic.

252
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:43,933
But importantly, that sense of order is echoed

253
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:45,475
in the way the architecture is constructed.

254
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:48,038
We have these solid joints, simple cornices,

255
00:11:48,178 --> 00:11:49,720
simple skirtings, all very matte.

256
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,743
So thematically, it establishes a locus of order

257
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:55,046
that acts as a contrast to the oncoming disorder,

258
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:57,148
which will be characterized by a very different

259
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:58,890
set of tectonics, that of encrustation.

260
00:12:01,107 --> 00:12:04,189
And so here, you can see that both the level layouts

261
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,813
and the world itself become these very melded layers

262
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,575
of material, these knobbly surfaces, this rust and dirt

263
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:12,556
and moss and mold.

264
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:15,698
And so at the same time that the level layouts become

265
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:21,723
less rectilinear, it's used to kind of highlight this art.

266
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:24,290
And so this is a great example where

267
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,651
the construction of the architecture

268
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:28,673
echoes the level design, how the mood is established

269
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:31,436
both in organizing principle and material expression

270
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:33,957
of the space in a way that has storytelling purpose.

271
00:12:35,298 --> 00:12:37,500
So creating specific characters in a space.

272
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:40,555
Here, two things have to evolve at once.

273
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:42,977
Since the way you shape a space can emphasize materials,

274
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:45,699
and simultaneously, the perception of material qualities,

275
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:48,041
that is weight, sturdiness, complexity, et cetera,

276
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:51,784
influences the perception of shape and scale and proportion,

277
00:12:51,824 --> 00:12:53,665
the kinds of things that you have control over

278
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:54,546
in shaping your levels.

279
00:12:56,467 --> 00:13:03,894
So this is an example by Zaha Hadid of how the layout of the space is helping to highlight

280
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:05,215
the tonal qualities of material.

281
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:12,021
Hadid is also a Pritzker Prize winner, also a major worldwide architect, also a favorite

282
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:12,321
of mine.

283
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:18,287
She mainly works in digital architecture, she does a lot of procedural stuff, and works

284
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:22,190
a lot in concrete, not so much in steel, which is why this one is kind of interesting.

285
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,520
So here to create an appropriate atmosphere

286
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,761
for the activity of diving, she's

287
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:33,822
designed a set of boards that kind of fill you

288
00:13:33,842 --> 00:13:35,643
with the feeling of lightness even before you step off

289
00:13:35,663 --> 00:13:36,003
the edge.

290
00:13:36,664 --> 00:13:38,304
Level design-wise, it's been separated

291
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:40,926
into these individual podiums, like creating a journey that

292
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:43,267
requires you to step out onto these suspended stairways.

293
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:47,189
And it's not like traditional diving boards, which

294
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:49,450
are joined into this central column,

295
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,651
and you don't get to actually step out and experience

296
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:52,091
that space.

297
00:13:54,143 --> 00:13:58,085
The space has also been cleared of other distracting elements and the ceiling is quite high and

298
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,648
the walls are without many right angles so it creates this sense of smoothness.

299
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:05,993
Moreover, the same level of layout sensibility

300
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:07,474
is echoed in the way the materials

301
00:14:07,494 --> 00:14:08,414
have been treated and shaped.

302
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:11,496
So the steel forms, these light, fine railings,

303
00:14:11,556 --> 00:14:15,158
you can see their return in these curved details that

304
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:16,359
are set apart from the platform.

305
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:19,341
The concrete has been shaped to these very plastic forms.

306
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:21,822
So the mood of the layout and the mood of the materials

307
00:14:21,882 --> 00:14:23,863
and the way they meet each other all have this sensibility.

308
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:28,426
And the choice that Zaha has made has allowed this to occur.

309
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:33,656
So there are games that do this really well, where the spatial qualities create tone and

310
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:34,737
emphasize materiality.

311
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:41,421
The first two Bioshock games, where the construction details are these chunky pieces really solidly

312
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:42,101
welded together.

313
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:46,124
And if you look at the level maps, you can see chunky spaces with heavy-duty connections

314
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:46,584
between them.

315
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:51,147
And this makes sense, because it's a heavy place, weighed down by a lot of atmospheric

316
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:51,427
pressure.

317
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:55,530
So yeah, it's the actual layout of the space and how you move through it.

318
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:59,192
And you can't just reskin this and expect it to work really well in all fictions.

319
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:05,817
So Bioshock Infinite takes a similar sensibility, but again, it still feels weighty even though

320
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:06,777
it's meant to be in the sky.

321
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:14,763
So in architecture, you would look more for...

322
00:15:15,857 --> 00:15:19,138
using details and material rather than narrative fiction.

323
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:20,458
It will just create a sense of lightness.

324
00:15:20,558 --> 00:15:22,739
So this is the Holman House by Durback-Lockjackers,

325
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,480
which there are details like there are reflective mirrors

326
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,180
on the columns.

327
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:31,082
The lights seem to fall from the sky

328
00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:32,102
through holes in the ceiling.

329
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:34,603
And the windows continue down past the edge of the floor.

330
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,023
So there's a sense that the whole building

331
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,604
is floating even when you're in it.

332
00:15:39,044 --> 00:15:43,327
There are games that do this well, so Mirror's Edge is trying to create a really light feeling

333
00:15:44,087 --> 00:15:45,428
that you're traversing things.

334
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:48,370
And they aren't very well...

335
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,431
Sorry, I'm talking too fast.

336
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:54,695
They're not welded together, but sit apart, sharply defined.

337
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:57,738
The space around you almost seems free floating.

338
00:15:58,578 --> 00:16:00,941
Subtracted, boxy elements insert themselves

339
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,742
into your path and fragment space.

340
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:05,425
Steel is used not just because it's visually light,

341
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:09,068
but it creates these fences that are blades jutting up

342
00:16:09,108 --> 00:16:09,629
into the level.

343
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:11,971
And that moves the camera up and down very quickly

344
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:13,913
and enhances that sense that you're up in the air

345
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,054
and you're kind of floating around.

346
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,560
So this geometry fragments and incises the space.

347
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,084
And you can see that the art direction has this fineness,

348
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:22,286
this sharpness to every join.

349
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:25,251
And that these level design choices allow that to be shown.

350
00:16:27,271 --> 00:16:32,093
You can talk about that it's not just a visual metaphor.

351
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:34,674
It's the difference between the player working their way

352
00:16:34,714 --> 00:16:36,395
from mass to mass to mass to mass

353
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:38,555
versus hopping around a fragment in space.

354
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:41,697
I know obviously the Shock Games are shooters

355
00:16:41,757 --> 00:16:43,097
and Mirror's Edge is a traversal game

356
00:16:43,117 --> 00:16:45,218
and Olympic diving is something totally different altogether

357
00:16:46,258 --> 00:16:47,959
but I still think it's worth considering

358
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:50,200
how you adapt these principles from one game to another.

359
00:16:56,992 --> 00:17:01,633
One of the last things I want to talk about is that, for me,

360
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:03,494
the consideration of architecture in games

361
00:17:03,554 --> 00:17:07,575
isn't about does your door work the way a real door does.

362
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:13,136
It's a question of does, because real architecture doesn't look

363
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:14,497
very realistic always either.

364
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:22,576
It's a question for me of space and material, not necessarily realism.

365
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:27,482
Sometimes it feels like games aim for a kind of solidity, like a need to fight the virtualness.

366
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:35,310
But for me, it's a question more about consistency, and that's kind of what we're trying to do here.

367
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:36,292
I think a big part of what's...

368
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:43,295
makes architecture captivating is that by compositing disparate materials with the same tonal goal,

369
00:17:43,575 --> 00:17:46,996
you kind of reveal the truth about the universe and its latent possibilities.

370
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:53,479
And I think that's true of games as well, because when you show how all these different layers can achieve the same thing,

371
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:57,821
you kind of tell something about the space that you're creating and the kind of vision that you have.

372
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:01,502
And so when I say detail, I don't mean something out of Detail Magazine.

373
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:03,724
It's not whether it's familiar.

374
00:18:04,164 --> 00:18:05,985
It's like, is the massing doing something

375
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:08,067
besides separating one bit of content from another?

376
00:18:08,528 --> 00:18:10,269
How do you think about the way you're using mass?

377
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:12,671
Is it a solid wall with holes punched in?

378
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:14,633
A dividing plane that's been thickened in places?

379
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:15,974
A frame within a space?

380
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:17,155
What metaphor do you use

381
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:20,878
to kind of express what you're trying to achieve

382
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:21,399
at that level?

383
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,101
I want you to use form the way that I use form,

384
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:26,743
to create identity, to emphasize material,

385
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:28,365
and to create a coherent whole

386
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:29,526
that has a distinct atmosphere.

387
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:30,286
Thank you.

388
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,701
All right, cool.

389
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,141
Questions?

390
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:50,605
Hi.

391
00:18:51,406 --> 00:18:53,667
I was wondering how you feel about repetition

392
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:58,510
in the architecture in games, such as modular levels, level

393
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,232
design, and using the same concrete texture

394
00:19:01,252 --> 00:19:03,073
for every piece of concrete in one game.

395
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:09,628
I have interesting feelings about that because I work a lot in procedural design.

396
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:14,072
So for me, like, repetition is, yeah, it's a device that you can use within that

397
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:15,954
and that's like one parameter that you can set.

398
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:21,019
And it gives, it can be used for familiarity or, like, as you,

399
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:24,062
as I'm sure you're criticizing more that it can be used for boredom

400
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,184
and like, it can cause boredom and that kind of thing.

401
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,497
or yeah.

402
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:36,081
But yeah, I'm wondering how you think it can be used usefully, like to the best advantage?

403
00:19:38,162 --> 00:19:38,882
Yeah, for sure.

404
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:42,893
It depends what you're trying to create.

405
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,214
If you want something to constantly echo something

406
00:19:45,254 --> 00:19:49,195
throughout your game, then it can do that.

407
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,196
If you think about cities that have really consistent

408
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:56,597
architecture, where it's often everywhere throughout,

409
00:19:57,877 --> 00:20:00,578
it creates a sense that the people in that world

410
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,179
had a particular material that they had to use.

411
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:06,720
and that they evolved to use that in a particular way

412
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,801
and that they've gone about it and just done it everywhere.

413
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:13,043
If you go to Santorini, it's really like the Greek island.

414
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:13,923
It's very like that.

415
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:15,744
Every house is constructed in the same way

416
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:17,985
because they only had limited options.

417
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:21,306
So that's kind of, to me, that's what they would say

418
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:22,646
architecturally about a world.

419
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:24,327
But yeah.

420
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:25,307
Thank you.

421
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:25,828
No worries.

422
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:31,176
Hi.

423
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:31,757
Hi, Dean.

424
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:32,377
Thanks for your talk.

425
00:20:33,738 --> 00:20:38,641
You were saying you want to apply consistency and so forth.

426
00:20:38,681 --> 00:20:42,624
So you're saying that normally in video games right now,

427
00:20:44,005 --> 00:20:46,907
would you think that we're a bit limited in our way of thinking

428
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:49,269
of designing in terms of architecture,

429
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:54,853
that we should apply more of the current architectural field

430
00:20:54,893 --> 00:20:55,673
towards game design?

431
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:57,447
I'm not sure about that.

432
00:20:57,688 --> 00:20:59,929
It was more that I'd never heard it expressed in this way.

433
00:21:00,189 --> 00:21:02,391
I can definitely see it happening in games.

434
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:05,073
So I don't know if people are limited,

435
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,996
but I don't know if there's the design emphasis on that.

436
00:21:09,096 --> 00:21:11,497
Because there's very much, particularly in games that

437
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:17,882
have a very strong tradition of level design

438
00:21:18,563 --> 00:21:21,184
for particular purposes, that's less experiential.

439
00:21:21,665 --> 00:21:24,327
So maybe for more experiential games, this is more relevant.

440
00:21:24,707 --> 00:21:24,887
Yeah.

441
00:21:25,977 --> 00:21:28,078
Okay, something to think about. Thanks.

442
00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:28,558
Of course.

443
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,081
Hi, you mentioned the documentary about city planning earlier?

444
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:37,402
Oh, The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces.

445
00:21:37,723 --> 00:21:38,463
Thank you very much.

446
00:21:38,523 --> 00:21:40,964
Yeah, it's really, really good. You should watch it.

447
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:44,826
Anybody else?

448
00:21:46,707 --> 00:21:46,767
No?

449
00:21:46,787 --> 00:21:46,887
Okay.

450
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:51,389
So, we'll move on to the next topic.

451
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:52,630
Okay, what do I do? Oh, okay.

452
00:21:54,777 --> 00:21:56,463
All right, everyone, 4.40 is the next talk.

453
00:21:56,503 --> 00:21:57,347
Thank you very much for coming.
