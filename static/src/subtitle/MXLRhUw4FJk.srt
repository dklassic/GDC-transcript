1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:11,057
Hi, my name is Rami Ismail, I'm one half of Dutch independent studio Vlambeer. And today I want to

2
00:00:11,097 --> 00:00:16,583
talk about the nuclear throne and performative development but in hindsight we gave a talk

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,567
about the in progress back at GDC San Francisco a year and a half ago.

4
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:26,669
This is about everything we learned since. So if you're interested in like the middle part,

5
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:30,712
how we felt in the middle of this, go check out that talk. If you're here, you have access to

6
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:37,658
the vault. It's there. I'm not going to double up on that. Just by show of hands real quick, I

7
00:00:37,698 --> 00:00:42,402
have about a five minute intro and I have a 25 minute talk. Who here wants me to go through

8
00:00:42,422 --> 00:00:47,085
the five minute intro and who is okay with just believing that I'm probably okay to stand

9
00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:47,706
here on the stage?

10
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:56,066
There's two people. I will personally give you the intro after my talk is over. So this

11
00:00:56,106 --> 00:01:05,210
part I'm skipping. Really cool. There's a joke there. Really good joke. I tend to tell a joke

12
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:11,453
here as well. This I'm still very proud of, to be honest. And this is Nuclear Throne.

13
00:01:13,093 --> 00:01:17,035
So we're talking about Nuclear Throne. So what is Nuclear Throne? Nuclear Throne is a

14
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:22,718
roguelike. It's a top-down action roguelike. If you play indie games, you might easily

15
00:01:22,738 --> 00:01:25,620
describe it, even though I don't like describing games as combinations of other games, you

16
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:32,624
might easily describe it as Binding of Isaac meets Hotline Miami. So there's a lot of

17
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:36,306
shooting, a lot of explosions, and it's procedurally generated. It's really hard.

18
00:01:38,128 --> 00:01:40,410
And we've created over the past two and a half years.

19
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:45,395
And one of the things we did while making Nuclear Throne was we live streamed development.

20
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:50,661
And at first we just called it live streaming development, but as we went we realized that

21
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:54,444
we were doing a bit more than just live streaming development, so we came up with a term for

22
00:01:54,484 --> 00:01:55,085
it, as you do.

23
00:01:55,485 --> 00:02:00,130
We called it performative development, and it's development as content.

24
00:02:01,332 --> 00:02:06,014
So it's not development as a process, it's also development itself as content to be consumed.

25
00:02:06,074 --> 00:02:09,195
So other people can watch your development, they can engage with it.

26
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:13,476
They can chat with you, they can watch you code, they can watch you make art, they can

27
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:14,537
watch you make music.

28
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:18,978
And it's kind of a radically transparent way of making a video game.

29
00:02:19,118 --> 00:02:21,839
It's not really something that has been done a lot.

30
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:29,988
So, performative development comes down to live streaming with, live stream development with the

31
00:02:30,088 --> 00:02:36,112
knowledge that you have an audience and sort of making sure that audience is engaged. So

32
00:02:36,152 --> 00:02:43,737
Nuclear Throne was made over a period of two and a half years. We started back in February 2013

33
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:47,539
and it was part of the MoJam bundle.

34
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:57,880
Mojang Bundle 2. Mojang, Minecraft, decided to do a charity stream where they asked a number

35
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,424
of independent developers to livestream development of a game they would make from start to finish

36
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:09,867
during a, I think, 72-hour period. And then at the end, everybody who bought the bundle

37
00:03:10,328 --> 00:03:15,971
would get those games DRM-free. They raised over $500,000, which was awesome. All of that

38
00:03:16,011 --> 00:03:18,533
money went straight to charity, which was also awesome.

39
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:23,858
But the interesting part was that we were asked to live stream this development.

40
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,599
And we had never really live streamed before.

41
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:27,360
So we said, sure, why not?

42
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:31,443
After Mojam was done, it was known as Wasteland Kings.

43
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,444
And we eventually had to change the name

44
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:38,807
because the Wasteland series was being kick-started and there was some legal dispute there.

45
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:43,630
It wasn't bad, there were no lawyers involved, just a friendly email from Byron Fargo who was like,

46
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:43,690
OK.

47
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,702
We're doing Wasteland. I was like, what is Wasteland? I hadn't heard of Wasteland. Anyway, I

48
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:53,223
Googled it and it turned out that Wasteland was made before I was born, so I gave up on

49
00:03:53,283 --> 00:04:00,225
arguing about it. So at the time we were working on a game called Luftrausers and when that

50
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:04,687
released we realized that we were still having a lot of fun making this funny, weird little

51
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:10,289
roguelike game that was Wasteland Kings. So we decided to pick it up again with a new

52
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:14,510
title. We decided to, in the spirit of Mojam, keep live streaming.

53
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:16,599
So we're going to live stream development.

54
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,981
And one of the reasons we did that was because when we were

55
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:23,444
doing the original version of Wasteland Kings, JW, my

56
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:25,706
co-founder, was really, really sick.

57
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,229
He was having sort of a fever.

58
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,411
And the thing that really kept him motivated and sort of

59
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:36,995
like alive was the chat, which was just super nice and super

60
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:38,936
enthusiastic and super friendly.

61
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:40,377
So he was like, I like this.

62
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,158
Let's keep doing this.

63
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,674
So we kept doing it. In August we picked up on the project again full time and then in

64
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:50,297
October we launched on Steam Early Access. But when we launched on Steam Early Access

65
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:54,920
we promised two things. We promised a live stream every Tuesday and every Thursday from

66
00:04:55,181 --> 00:05:00,625
1pm Central European time to 6pm Central European time and an update to the game every weekend

67
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:06,570
until it was done. So we would develop things on the stream and then the same weekend you

68
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,014
could go and play them. So this is what it looked like when we started.

69
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:18,392
I couldn't find a higher quality screen shot because we streamed in horrible quality.

70
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:20,753
So this is the best we have.

71
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:23,234
As you can see, we have IRC open.

72
00:05:23,894 --> 00:05:25,195
The chat is on the screen.

73
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:26,855
Everything else is on the screen as well.

74
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:32,317
And I think Paul Feer, our artist there, is dancing in front of a giant stack of beer

75
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:32,678
crates.

76
00:05:34,298 --> 00:05:35,398
So we were very professional.

77
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:40,238
We didn't really have an example to follow.

78
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:42,099
Nobody really had live stream development before us.

79
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:42,879
We were like, you know what?

80
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:43,559
We're going to do this.

81
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,880
We're going to do two live streams a week.

82
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,941
Two live streams a week, and every live stream is going to

83
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:47,501
be two people.

84
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:48,382
We had a team of six.

85
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:53,824
We had me as a programmer and marketing business, JW as a

86
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:55,005
prototyper and programmer.

87
00:05:55,385 --> 00:05:56,946
We had Paul Veer for art.

88
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:58,787
We had Yukio Kalio for music.

89
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:00,067
We had Jonas Turner for sound effects.

90
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:02,349
And we had a young kid by the name of Justin Chan who was

91
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:03,829
doing all the promotional arts.

92
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,991
And we said, every stream is going to be two people.

93
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:11,494
And then every month, everybody has to stream about three times.

94
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:13,575
Right? That's about what that comes down to.

95
00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:21,161
It turns out that live streaming is hard.

96
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:24,644
It's really hard.

97
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:28,307
But, I mean, this looked fun.

98
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:31,550
So we basically said, okay, we're going to set ourselves some goals.

99
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,252
We're going to try this. We've promised it when we launched.

100
00:06:34,332 --> 00:06:35,953
So I guess we should probably do it.

101
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:39,462
So we had a bunch of goals.

102
00:06:40,343 --> 00:06:41,884
The first goal was to engage the community,

103
00:06:42,325 --> 00:06:44,926
keep them interested in the game, even if not a lot was happening.

104
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:47,348
And we wanted to create this feedback loop

105
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:49,830
where we would put out a version, see how people were responding to it,

106
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,391
and then update the game based on that.

107
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:52,452
It was our vision.

108
00:06:52,832 --> 00:06:53,893
We very strictly said,

109
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:55,634
you do not get ownership of the game.

110
00:06:56,435 --> 00:06:57,956
You do not get to tell us what we do.

111
00:06:58,036 --> 00:06:59,137
We're going to choose what we do.

112
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,998
You get to watch, you get to give us feedback.

113
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:02,179
We'll take your feedback into account.

114
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:03,040
But if we disagree,

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,321
sorry, this is our game, right?

116
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:10,832
And most importantly, we've always been very much about transparency and trying to show

117
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:12,513
people how games actually get made.

118
00:07:12,813 --> 00:07:17,537
We feel that we've tried to be way too perfect as an industry and it's time to show the humans

119
00:07:17,597 --> 00:07:20,679
and the mistakes and the interesting little things that happen during development.

120
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,043
So transparency was a core issue and a core hope.

121
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:26,864
And we hoped...

122
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:31,054
that it would lower our community management load, that we would have to work less on our

123
00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:35,177
community because our community would be educated and well aware of all the issues we were facing

124
00:07:35,217 --> 00:07:36,758
and they would be able to communicate on our behalf.

125
00:07:37,518 --> 00:07:38,479
So yeah, live streaming is hard.

126
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,443
It turns out that organizing six schedules of which four are freelance and part-time

127
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:45,023
is not easy.

128
00:07:46,284 --> 00:07:49,386
It also turned out nobody gave a damn about our stream.

129
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:54,277
It turned out that all the quality of everything we did was horrible.

130
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:55,837
The audio was terrible.

131
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:56,998
The video was terrible.

132
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:59,179
And we are horrible casters.

133
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,182
We have no presentation skills and nobody of us dares to stare at a camera without feeling

134
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:06,623
embarrassed or grinning at it.

135
00:08:07,763 --> 00:08:12,166
And then on top of that, you know what's really hard?

136
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:14,867
Talking while doing something.

137
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:20,731
It's really easy to just talk and it's really easy to do something, but doing both at the

138
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,812
same time, it doesn't work.

139
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:25,753
I can barely make this gesture with my arms while I'm talking right now.

140
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:27,254
It's really hard.

141
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:32,076
But the people that watched the stream, they loved it.

142
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:33,816
They were super into it.

143
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:35,277
They were asking questions.

144
00:08:35,317 --> 00:08:37,058
They were having fun.

145
00:08:37,098 --> 00:08:37,878
They were making jokes.

146
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:39,739
They were coming up with horrible ideas.

147
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,260
It was a great time.

148
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:47,655
And we saw that we were teaching people stuff, which was awesome.

149
00:08:47,915 --> 00:08:50,998
We added a laser rifle to the game because people asked,

150
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:53,840
and then it turned out that the bullets go through the wall

151
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,701
because we had a program collision.

152
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:58,083
And the moment we explained that as a programmer,

153
00:08:58,123 --> 00:09:01,746
you might have to program collision, just the entire chat lost it.

154
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:03,467
It was beautiful. They were like,

155
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:05,169
wait, you have to program that? We're like...

156
00:09:09,572 --> 00:09:11,634
They're like, oh, now we get what games take so long to make.

157
00:09:11,674 --> 00:09:12,755
We're like, yeah, yeah.

158
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:20,025
Anyway, after two and a half years of streaming, we did 98 updates to the game. We had 250

159
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:25,029
episodes of the live stream and NuclearStone's dev stream ended right before the game got

160
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:30,934
launched. At that point our channel had 15,000 followers, we had 1,200 subscribers and each

161
00:09:30,954 --> 00:09:31,394
of them paid $12.99.

162
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:36,959
Those 1299 actually gave them a copy of the game.

163
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:42,240
We were the first and as far as I know only studio to ever sell a game through subscriptions

164
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,701
on Twitch and I think since then Twitch has said that you should probably not do that.

165
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:52,782
We just didn't ask for permission because it was an API hack.

166
00:09:56,883 --> 00:09:58,323
I got a few angry phone calls that day.

167
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:05,045
But they were very supportive. Twitch likes it when you experiment with their stuff, they

168
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:13,732
just might ask you not to do it again. Also, we made $31 in ad revenue. I checked this morning.

169
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:17,235
Since we opened our channel in 2013, we became rich.

170
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:24,902
More importantly, we found ourselves an amazing community.

171
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:31,006
The Twitch streamers and the YouTube streamers, many of them ended up streaming our game because

172
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:34,309
the people that were in our channel were also in their channels.

173
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,833
So they would just recommend our game just because they were watching our stream.

174
00:10:39,313 --> 00:10:42,396
And because they were watching the development, they also felt very tied into the game.

175
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:46,540
They felt very tied to the development of the game in a way that a lot of developers

176
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,382
can only get through Kickstarter if they update it properly.

177
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:53,789
There are other such things where people are very closely involved with development.

178
00:10:54,629 --> 00:11:00,912
One YouTube creator, Sleep Cycles, made 588 episodes, and each of them are 30 minutes

179
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:01,192
long.

180
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:05,114
I think at a time that he streamed Nuclear Throne, you can explore all of No Man's Sky.

181
00:11:08,055 --> 00:11:14,338
On launch day, every single one of them streamed the game, except for one.

182
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,259
Most of them streamed that day.

183
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,037
And it was funny because that was the largest spike we've ever seen in development.

184
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:25,359
By far the largest spike in development.

185
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:27,321
You want to know what the second largest spike in development was?

186
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:32,265
A YouTube caster, Twitch streamer, North and Lion, made an episode about the game

187
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,906
and it just blew our sales off the roof.

188
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:38,130
So, we made a game on Twitch.

189
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:42,733
And making a game on Twitch, you learn a lot about how you make a game for Twitch.

190
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:45,776
So, here's what we learned.

191
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:49,459
Your game does not matter.

192
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:52,935
Twitch is not about games.

193
00:11:53,856 --> 00:11:55,857
Twitch looks like it's about games.

194
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:57,518
Twitch says it's about games.

195
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:58,920
Twitch is about the casters.

196
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,201
Twitch is about the personalities.

197
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:01,982
It's about the people.

198
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,664
They use the game as a vehicle to talk.

199
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,087
They use the game as a vehicle to connect to people.

200
00:12:08,907 --> 00:12:11,810
Your game, not the star of the show, not even close.

201
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:15,933
If you are making a game and you want it to be on Twitch,

202
00:12:15,973 --> 00:12:17,914
you know what the number one most important thing

203
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:18,375
is you can do?

204
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:21,357
Make sure that you can talk while playing it.

205
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:26,979
If you make a game that is so over the top that you are constantly revving at 100% with

206
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:31,502
your brain, all the Twitch streamer will be able to say is, uh, or holy shit.

207
00:12:32,683 --> 00:12:34,544
Depending on their audience, that might be enough.

208
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:37,566
For most Twitch streamers, not enough.

209
00:12:38,907 --> 00:12:43,791
So you want to create moments of pause, moments of breathing, moments where people can communicate

210
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:46,953
about what they're doing, their high-level strategy, their low-level strategy, where

211
00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:50,055
they can make a joke, where they can talk, where they can talk about their day.

212
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:51,596
That's your number one thing.

213
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:58,236
For Nuclear Throne, in fact, when we first started the game, there was a mutation screen

214
00:12:58,476 --> 00:12:59,176
that you could use.

215
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:02,839
And one of the interesting things about that screen was that it was very snappy.

216
00:13:04,632 --> 00:13:07,833
You clear a level, mutation screen come up, you click your mutation and you go.

217
00:13:07,873 --> 00:13:11,075
And when the game just came out, when it first hit early access, you know what everybody did?

218
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:12,435
They read the screen.

219
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:14,957
And they would talk about the options they would pick.

220
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,738
Now after three months, you know what happened?

221
00:13:17,178 --> 00:13:19,979
Everybody knew which option they wanted to pick as soon as they saw it.

222
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,581
They would get four randomized power-ups that they could pick from,

223
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,941
and they're like, that one is the best one.

224
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,622
So they didn't talk anymore. You know what happened?

225
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:27,243
They ran out of breath.

226
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:29,044
It was hard to talk.

227
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:32,045
So we added an effect that made it take a bit longer.

228
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:34,883
And now they had a little bit of time to talk again.

229
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,927
So you can optimize your game for Twitch.

230
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:40,748
And the most important thing when you optimize your game for

231
00:13:40,768 --> 00:13:41,749
Twitch, communication.

232
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:45,111
This should be true for every game ever, is

233
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,312
communicate your design.

234
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:48,294
Make sure your declarative layer explains what's

235
00:13:48,314 --> 00:13:50,516
happening in the system, that between two states of your

236
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:52,277
game, people know what changed.

237
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:52,917
That makes sense.

238
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:56,080
Make your game in such a way that it communicates, that it

239
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,821
communicates the important things that are happening.

240
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:00,664
For Twitch, you have to consider that normally the

241
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:02,485
feedback loop that we have is game and player.

242
00:14:03,323 --> 00:14:06,966
You go from game through the visuals or the sound or whatever to the player's brain.

243
00:14:06,986 --> 00:14:09,988
The player's brain creates an input based on that and then the game continues.

244
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:13,671
For Twitch, you don't only have to explain this loop, you have to explain the loop that

245
00:14:13,731 --> 00:14:17,894
is somebody is watching this player who already understands your game.

246
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:20,135
You also have to explain your game to them.

247
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:24,919
Your game needs to be a constant tutorial for whoever is watching.

248
00:14:26,195 --> 00:14:29,376
And if you do that, you can make a game that's interesting to watch,

249
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,757
because you know what the alternative is?

250
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:34,358
The chat will be asking all the time, what is happening?

251
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:36,179
You know what Twitch streamers don't want to do?

252
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:40,041
Talk about what is happening all the time, because that's not what they do.

253
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:42,722
So you want to give clear feedback.

254
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:45,684
You want to have text prompts for whatever is necessary.

255
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:49,425
You want to make sure that there are clear indicators of what mode somebody is playing.

256
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:50,266
We have a daily mode.

257
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:52,987
The number one request we got after we implemented this,

258
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:54,628
is please put something on screen.

259
00:14:56,036 --> 00:14:58,118
So that the audience knows we're playing dailies.

260
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:01,401
Because now every time somebody comes into our stream,

261
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:02,441
they ask, is this the daily?

262
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:04,403
And that was it.

263
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,004
Every single person would ask that.

264
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:07,145
So we added that.

265
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,428
Customization of where text goes, where does the HUD go,

266
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:11,529
where does all that stuff go.

267
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:13,311
Like, make sure that there's space for people

268
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:14,272
to kind of customize that.

269
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:20,917
Now, you could also completely mess it up, which is awesome.

270
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:22,719
Here's some really good ways to mess it up.

271
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:24,480
Not allowing windowed mode.

272
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:28,473
They hate it because a lot of them stream through window mode.

273
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:36,418
If you can do it, allow people to output audio over a different output device.

274
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:39,600
Not just the speakers. Allow them to output over whatever.

275
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,203
Because a lot of streaming applications will allow you to select where the audio comes from,

276
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:46,144
and not everybody wants it over the speakers all the time.

277
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:50,587
If you have a game, check whether it works on the second screen.

278
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:54,547
I just drag it to the second screen, see if it still renders.

279
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:55,408
A lot of games don't.

280
00:15:55,948 --> 00:15:57,389
That's a good way to never get streamers.

281
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,892
Most importantly, you know what sounds really clever?

282
00:16:01,652 --> 00:16:05,956
Putting a message in the game saying to follow you on Twitch or on Twitter.

283
00:16:06,456 --> 00:16:07,657
You know what you should not do?

284
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:09,318
That thing.

285
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,040
You know why not?

286
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,981
Because that's up to the streamer.

287
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:16,664
If somebody joins a stream and they're watching it

288
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:19,426
and there's a message to follow somebody else, what do you think they do?

289
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:23,547
You're going to get either confused, which pisses off the

290
00:16:23,587 --> 00:16:26,289
streamer, or they're going to get annoyed because they want to

291
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:29,491
follow that streamer and not you. Either way, not good. Don't

292
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:35,695
do it. So, those are the most important things we learned

293
00:16:35,715 --> 00:16:38,597
about developing a game. Here's what we learned about streaming.

294
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,819
If you are a developer and you want a live stream development,

295
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,782
which could be fun, here are some things you should think

296
00:16:46,802 --> 00:16:46,982
about.

297
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:54,393
Don't broadcast potato quality. Everybody who laughed at this joke has spent too much time on

298
00:16:54,433 --> 00:17:01,276
Twitch or at least some time at Twitch. Potato is just a word they use for bad. I don't understand

299
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:07,497
it, don't ask me. It's just a word you use. If you want to stream on Twitch, please, please,

300
00:17:07,597 --> 00:17:17,120
please invest in a camera, okay? A webcam. We bought a Logitech C920. Is that product

301
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,041
placement? Is that bad? I'm sorry.

302
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:25,292
We brought an unnamed brand C920 and a snowball of a microphone

303
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:30,257
manufacturer that is named after a color that is blue. And we

304
00:17:30,297 --> 00:17:33,640
searched for good light. Good light in the office. And then we

305
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:38,045
set everything up. Altogether it was about $300. The difference

306
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:41,208
between the stream before that and after that is absurd.

307
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:47,913
Also, nobody hated us in the chat anymore, which was nice. And we lowered, in our case, we

308
00:17:47,973 --> 00:17:52,638
lowered the amount of streamers per episode to just one streamer because now they would be

309
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:59,363
less tired, which also was good. Now, if you are the one streaming, here's a really awkward

310
00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:01,345
pro tip. Watch your own VODs.

311
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:06,640
So when you record a live stream, Twitch saves an archived version.

312
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,762
It's called a VOD, or video on demand.

313
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:10,384
Watch it.

314
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:14,869
It's really awkward, and it will probably kind of make you very embarrassed for yourself,

315
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,715
and depending on how well you can deal with that, you might cry at it, like I did.

316
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:27,635
Watch them. Do you feel you're engaging? Like are you interested in your own stuff? I wasn't.

317
00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:33,778
Is your speaking tempo okay? Like I like this as a public speaking tempo on a stage. But on

318
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:36,759
Twitch you kind of have to do this because otherwise people just get bored. You have to speak

319
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:40,661
faster, you have to like kind of keep going and not stop talking because people kind of get

320
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:47,185
weirded out by that. Are you allowing awkward pauses? Like a pause like this is good. A pause

321
00:18:47,205 --> 00:18:49,886
that isn't clear is bad.

322
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:55,639
Right? There's a difference. Make sure that you're not making awkward pauses. Like, keep

323
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,823
track of that. Are you reacting to the chat? Twitch also saves your chat, so you can read

324
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:03,025
your chat as you're watching your VOD. Okay.

325
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:07,031
You can watch your chat as you're watching your VOD, which is super useful because you

326
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:08,673
can see if you're answering the chat.

327
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:09,613
Are they entertained?

328
00:19:10,154 --> 00:19:11,095
What are they laughing at?

329
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:12,036
What are they responding to?

330
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:13,076
Is your video quality good?

331
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:13,677
Is your light good?

332
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:14,578
Is there no lag?

333
00:19:14,698 --> 00:19:15,499
Is the audio good?

334
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,200
Is your white balance good?

335
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,782
White balance is a really weird one.

336
00:19:19,582 --> 00:19:21,224
Just check if your white balance is okay.

337
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:22,785
Read the chat.

338
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:24,166
Just very carefully read the chat.

339
00:19:25,135 --> 00:19:27,776
Now, I asked a bunch of other streamers.

340
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:35,259
I asked William Chair, I asked Sky, I asked a number of big Twitch streamers,

341
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,200
what's the biggest thing that led to your success?

342
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,761
And they all give the same answer, it's follow a schedule.

343
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:42,342
It's just be consistent.

344
00:19:42,562 --> 00:19:45,703
Just every day stream, every two day stream, every three day stream,

345
00:19:45,723 --> 00:19:49,244
but do it consistently so that people know when to show up.

346
00:19:49,344 --> 00:19:51,965
And when you tell them what the schedule is, you know what you do.

347
00:19:53,482 --> 00:19:58,067
You follow it. You know what the most annoying thing is? Sitting down for your favorite Twitch

348
00:19:58,087 --> 00:20:06,274
show, turning it on, and nothing happens. That's really annoying. So, the biggest challenge

349
00:20:06,294 --> 00:20:09,898
to doing a good Twitch show is the fact that you have to learn to just drop everything

350
00:20:10,478 --> 00:20:16,063
when the show starts and do the show. Whatever you're doing, with, you know, reasonable exceptions.

351
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:23,511
And then be yourself. Be genuine. Like talk about what excites you and it will attract people like

352
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:27,993
you that are excited about the same stuff. And don't create too much of an act. Because if you

353
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:39,417
do create an act, you have to stick with it. Which isn't great. But also, don't be too much of

354
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:46,820
yourself. Like please keep like a healthy mental barrier between the hordes of the Internet. And

355
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:55,287
And your own sanity, please. You can use a persona. You can create some distance. Make sure it

356
00:20:55,367 --> 00:21:01,450
comes naturally. Right? And think about this. Personas on Twitch very often include a

357
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,972
healthy amount of exaggeration and a healthy amount of bravure. So you can use those. Just

358
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:12,034
make sure that you keep a bit of a buffer. Which... Internet.

359
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:15,305
So community building takes time from both ends.

360
00:21:15,325 --> 00:21:17,407
I think I just got the five minute sign, which is great.

361
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:20,669
So building a community takes time from both ends.

362
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:23,311
So invest proper time. Make sure you invest time.

363
00:21:23,331 --> 00:21:24,631
This is not going to be done in one week.

364
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:25,612
It's not going to be done in a month.

365
00:21:25,672 --> 00:21:28,214
It's going to take you at least half a year before you have a good user base.

366
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:34,399
And when you have a community, don't waste your time. Be there when you say it. Reward people

367
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:39,784
that are there very often. Be considerate, be thoughtful, respond to inquiries about your day.

368
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:43,747
Offer good content. Don't do a shitty show where you're hungover from whatever you were

369
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:52,474
doing the day before. It helps if you don't drink. Oh, and moderate your fucking chat.

370
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,286
Seriously, have moderators. Pick good moderators.

371
00:21:57,326 --> 00:21:59,207
You know what will really push people away?

372
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:00,268
Assholes.

373
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:02,930
Get them out of your chat.

374
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,073
Like, if you're worried about their sale, fuck that sale.

375
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:10,235
They're not worth the hurt in the community.

376
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,997
Keep your community good. Keep it healthy.

377
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:14,638
Keep it positive. Keep it supportive.

378
00:22:14,678 --> 00:22:16,880
Keep it something good so that people want to come back.

379
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,941
So that your community, when it spreads out,

380
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:20,963
when it grows big, when it reaches other things,

381
00:22:21,303 --> 00:22:23,164
your community is not that poisonous piece of...

382
00:22:24,196 --> 00:22:29,038
How much can a poisonous piece of crap that a lot of other games create?

383
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:30,839
Keep a positive community.

384
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:34,160
Make your moderators careful, by the way.

385
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,240
It's easy to mod somebody.

386
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,722
It's really hard to unmod somebody without hurting a lot of feelings.

387
00:22:40,502 --> 00:22:41,223
So reward their time.

388
00:22:41,363 --> 00:22:42,723
Keep track of other people playing your game.

389
00:22:42,743 --> 00:22:43,644
Somebody's streaming your game?

390
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:44,684
Go into their chat.

391
00:22:44,704 --> 00:22:45,084
Talk to them.

392
00:22:45,104 --> 00:22:46,205
You know what the nicest thing is?

393
00:22:46,245 --> 00:22:48,926
When a developer of the game you're streaming is in your chat.

394
00:22:49,946 --> 00:22:50,346
They love it.

395
00:22:51,374 --> 00:22:56,199
Viewers love it, the streamers love it, do it. Just go hang out. You get a lot of requests,

396
00:22:56,239 --> 00:23:01,083
Steam keys, small modifications to the game, usually like little technical glitches. Sometimes

397
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:04,787
they ask for a special build, which you might or might not do. Stuff like that.

398
00:23:05,963 --> 00:23:10,428
But most of all, just have fun. Just go hang out in other streams. If you enjoy a stream, say hi,

399
00:23:10,648 --> 00:23:14,252
talk to them for half an hour. And then the people from there might show up for your stream

400
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:18,257
next time. Most importantly, you need to understand Twitch culture. And Twitch culture,

401
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:25,666
who here was at GDC Europe or was in the industry in 2010? Okay. So, I'm going to talk about

402
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:29,564
For those of you who remember the Indie scene in 2010, it was kind of different.

403
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:32,526
It felt like more of a frontier, it was kind of new.

404
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:38,652
Nobody really knew what was happening, every hero that you had was your age,

405
00:23:39,053 --> 00:23:41,715
because nobody really started before that.

406
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:44,758
It was kind of a frontier.

407
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,702
Twitch in 2014, just two years ago, was exactly like that.

408
00:23:48,722 --> 00:23:51,264
You know the biggest difference between how Indie grew and how Twitch grew?

409
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:54,133
Twitch is a multi-million dollar corporation.

410
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:55,574
It's kind of a giveaway, right?

411
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:56,374
Like, they're huge.

412
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:59,275
The Indie scene didn't have support structure,

413
00:23:59,315 --> 00:23:59,915
stuff like that.

414
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:01,616
Twitch offers all of that.

415
00:24:01,676 --> 00:24:03,556
It offers events, it offers support,

416
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:06,137
it offers goals, goals so important.

417
00:24:06,197 --> 00:24:07,538
Twitch streamers know what they want.

418
00:24:07,618 --> 00:24:08,718
You know what a Twitch streamer wants?

419
00:24:09,638 --> 00:24:10,118
A sub button.

420
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:13,379
A way for people to subscribe to their channel

421
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:13,899
and pay money.

422
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,580
That's your goal.

423
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,380
If you start streaming on Twitch, you want a sub button.

424
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,283
That's it. And you know when you have the sub button, what is your goal?

425
00:24:19,683 --> 00:24:21,223
As many subscribers as possible.

426
00:24:21,863 --> 00:24:23,244
If you're an indie developer, what is your goal?

427
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,905
I don't know, like, SOS make games about mosh pits and, like,

428
00:24:27,145 --> 00:24:28,685
kicking people in the groin or something.

429
00:24:29,345 --> 00:24:32,006
And then, Piero doesn't do that.

430
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:35,027
He makes really pretty games about, like, the moon and stuff.

431
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:38,408
Like, everybody has their own goals and nobody knows what they're doing.

432
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:41,148
So, what is your goal? Like, you have to figure that out on your own.

433
00:24:41,228 --> 00:24:42,709
Twitch streamers don't need to do that,

434
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:45,609
they just need to figure out what personality, what voice to use to get there.

435
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:46,390
So...

436
00:24:47,802 --> 00:24:52,769
Twitch is this personality driven thing with clear goals, where games are not the star

437
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:53,550
but the vehicle.

438
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:58,035
So to work on Twitch, you need to understand that, and you need to just be a genuine part

439
00:24:58,075 --> 00:24:58,215
of it.

440
00:24:59,142 --> 00:25:02,845
You just need to be part of that. And it's not scary to be part of that. They're not that

441
00:25:02,905 --> 00:25:06,527
different. They don't bite. It's just a radically different culture and if you want to be part

442
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:10,530
of it, you kind of have to go and understand it. So it means that you have to understand

443
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,633
what a host, what hosting is. You have to understand what rating is, which sounds really

444
00:25:14,673 --> 00:25:18,635
scary and basically means you send a lot of people to somebody else's chat, but usually it's

445
00:25:18,675 --> 00:25:24,699
a positive thing. The modes, the events, hanging out in other streams, stuff like that. It

446
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:26,641
understands, understanding the language.

447
00:25:27,597 --> 00:25:31,002
Now the final big tip that I have is this is a tip my brother gave, my younger brother

448
00:25:31,022 --> 00:25:35,749
Saif. He watched my stream for a few weeks and he said, why don't you ask people to subscribe?

449
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:40,737
I don't know.

450
00:25:42,511 --> 00:25:43,612
You want to know the biggest secret?

451
00:25:43,992 --> 00:25:46,714
It's by far the most impactful thing anybody has ever said.

452
00:25:47,394 --> 00:25:48,415
Just ask people.

453
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:51,737
Like, we're so, we like to be so humble that we don't go to,

454
00:25:51,977 --> 00:25:53,057
we always laugh at people going,

455
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,338
oh, please follow or subscribe.

456
00:25:54,378 --> 00:25:56,219
It's like, ha, oh, that joke, please,

457
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,480
please follow or subscribe.

458
00:25:57,981 --> 00:25:58,461
Say it.

459
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,263
It's like you have this big hallway

460
00:26:02,363 --> 00:26:04,044
and at the end is the end of the stream

461
00:26:04,384 --> 00:26:06,526
and you put a button that's follow or subscribe

462
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:08,727
right there in the corner, right at the start.

463
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:10,448
We would call that bad level design.

464
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:15,045
Right? Unless it's a secret button, but it's not. You want people to press that button.

465
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:19,389
Well, you know where you put the button? Every 10 steps in that hallway until somebody

466
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:26,356
presses it, and then you move it away. Stream, same thing. Just say it. Say it. Please. It's

467
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:32,483
really hard. I know. It hurts your honor. Follow or subscribe. That's it. All you need to do.

468
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:35,025
So here's a call to action. Do you have questions?

469
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:42,752
I'll take one or two because he is doing like a, that probably means no questions.

470
00:26:42,772 --> 00:26:43,032
Yeah.

471
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:47,394
Do you find there was a significant shift in quality depending on whether you screen

472
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:55,098
the development of your game or whether you didn't and reviewed it again?

473
00:26:55,118 --> 00:26:55,778
The quality of what?

474
00:26:57,402 --> 00:27:00,823
Yeah, Nuclear Throne would have never been nearly as good as it is now without the streams.

475
00:27:00,903 --> 00:27:03,824
Like, the biggest thing is like a lot of indies are really bad at playtesting.

476
00:27:04,464 --> 00:27:06,405
You know what's a horrifying way to playtest your game?

477
00:27:06,565 --> 00:27:09,465
Watching a stream where thousands of other people are watching,

478
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:12,946
where you don't want to say hi because you're embarrassed for what is happening on the screen.

479
00:27:13,387 --> 00:27:14,567
Like, you will fix that shit.

480
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:17,748
Like, no question about it, because you don't want to be in that situation again.

481
00:27:18,628 --> 00:27:24,210
Nuclear Throne would have never been what it is without Sleep Cycles, who did 580 episodes,

482
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:28,031
without Best Nap, who did so many episodes about the game. It was huge.

483
00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:49,453
So the first thing you do is you make a Twitch channel and you start streaming.

484
00:27:49,893 --> 00:27:51,214
And that was the first thing we did as well.

485
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:52,914
We started with streaming, right, on Mojam.

486
00:27:52,994 --> 00:27:56,316
And then from there we just started hanging out in other streams and we started meeting

487
00:27:56,356 --> 00:27:56,616
people.

488
00:27:57,197 --> 00:27:58,617
It was honestly completely organic.

489
00:27:58,697 --> 00:28:00,678
It was not very intentional.

490
00:28:00,698 --> 00:28:05,020
It was just a thing that we did where we just liked people streaming games we liked.

491
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,961
So we started saying hi and then people started saying hi and then at events like this, it

492
00:28:06,981 --> 00:28:09,102
turns out some of them would be here and we just say like, hey, we, we, I was in your

493
00:28:09,123 --> 00:28:09,283
chat.

494
00:28:09,303 --> 00:28:09,523
A huge fan.

495
00:28:09,543 --> 00:28:09,703
And then.

496
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:09,803
Yeah.

497
00:28:09,823 --> 00:28:10,263
We had a great time.

498
00:28:10,283 --> 00:28:10,663
It was a lot of fun.

499
00:28:10,683 --> 00:28:12,064
We're not going to get into that in the next couple of days.

500
00:28:12,084 --> 00:28:12,764
But yeah, it was a lot of fun.

501
00:28:12,784 --> 00:28:13,705
And we'll see you guys in the next video.

502
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:14,065
I'll see you guys.

503
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:14,145
Bye.

504
00:28:14,165 --> 00:28:14,225
Bye.

505
00:28:14,245 --> 00:28:14,305
Bye.

506
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:14,405
Bye.

507
00:28:14,445 --> 00:28:14,505
Bye.

508
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:14,585
Bye.

509
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:14,665
Bye.

510
00:28:14,685 --> 00:28:14,745
Bye.

511
00:28:14,765 --> 00:28:14,825
Bye.

512
00:28:14,845 --> 00:28:14,925
Bye.

513
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:15,005
Bye.

514
00:28:15,025 --> 00:28:15,086
Bye.

515
00:28:15,106 --> 00:28:15,186
Bye.

516
00:28:15,206 --> 00:28:15,266
Bye.

517
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:15,346
Bye.

518
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:15,466
Bye.

519
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:15,546
Bye.

520
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:15,646
Bye.

521
00:28:15,686 --> 00:28:15,746
Bye.

522
00:28:15,766 --> 00:28:15,846
Bye.

523
00:28:15,886 --> 00:28:15,946
Bye.

524
00:28:16,137 --> 00:28:20,359
You meet people. It's honestly no different networking. There's one really nice tip.

525
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,820
You know where you can find Twitch people? At the Twitch booth.

526
00:28:24,821 --> 00:28:28,643
Because, as I said, Twitch is a multi-million dollar company that has giant booths.

527
00:28:28,703 --> 00:28:31,944
If you're at Gamescom, just walk over. Hang out a bit, say hi.

528
00:28:31,984 --> 00:28:35,326
If you recognize anybody because you've been watching Twitch because you want to be part of Twitch,

529
00:28:36,246 --> 00:28:37,567
then you might recognize people and just say,

530
00:28:37,587 --> 00:28:38,888
Hi, I'm a game developer. I like your work.

531
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:42,771
Make sure that you do like their work, by the way. If you want to know how you can really piss

532
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:46,633
off a Twitch streamer, it is by emailing them that you really like their tone and then also

533
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:51,136
saying please don't swear too much while their gig is swearing continuously. That will piss

534
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:55,979
off people. Don't do that. Don't be that person. Don't do mass emails. Like Twitch is about

535
00:28:56,019 --> 00:29:02,003
personality, so think about that. Is this really the, like, yeah, that was it? If you have

536
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,385
any other questions, he's doing it with two hands. That's very impressive.

537
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:08,770
If you have any other questions, I'm going to be right here for the two people that really

538
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:14,480
wanted the intro. Feel free to find me there and I'll give you the intro. Thanks so much.
