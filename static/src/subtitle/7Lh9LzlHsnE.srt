00:00:04,186 --> 00:00:12,032
My name is Liz Ryerson. I am a game designer, composer of music, visual artist, and critic.

2
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:16,855
I did the music for Dysphoria, which you might have played. I did a game called Problematic.

3
00:00:16,855 --> 00:00:26,142
I write stuff about games on my blog, and yeah, I have some art, actually, that is going to be sold at the Wild Rumpus party tonight.

4
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:26,963
Anyway, um...

5
00:00:27,852 --> 00:00:30,474
This talk is about kind of conveying ideas through abstraction.

6
00:00:30,474 --> 00:00:31,575
So let's get started.

7
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:33,676
This, by the way, is a screenshot from an Atari 800 game.

8
00:00:33,676 --> 00:00:37,719
It's like a sort of a homebrew Polish game, in case you're wondering.

9
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,441
So the history of video games is kind of a history of expression

10
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,823
defined by technological limitations.

11
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:58,055
In hindsight, it's easy to look back fondly on the old days of games and forget all the

12
00:00:58,055 --> 00:01:02,197
mind-numbing efforts that went into even making these games run.

13
00:01:02,197 --> 00:01:08,559
Back then, games were constantly engaged in a struggle to make any sort of basic sense

14
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:13,260
of the language of game design and try to make it look or feel like something kind of

15
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,802
tangible and interesting within the strict limitations that were imposed on them.

16
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:22,003
And I think a lot of, like, older games carry this very strongly, for better or for worse.

17
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:29,032
Now of course we choose the limits, oh, sorry.

18
00:01:29,032 --> 00:01:37,276
And we can do pretty much whatever we want within our own limitations

19
00:01:37,276 --> 00:01:40,137
and what kind of context we're working in.

20
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:45,259
But I think there's a thing where we sort of see this gaminess,

21
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:49,781
this kind of expression defined by the limits of this technology

22
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:52,623
as kind of a prison that we need to escape from.

23
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:59,586
like as something that needs to be kind of transcended in order to like realize our ideas

24
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,927
or in order for games to be taken more seriously.

25
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:08,370
Games like Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, whatever, we think of these games as approaching

26
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:14,053
a kind of like representational realism or kind of like a documentary realism or as speaking

27
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:18,735
at the very least speaking to our reality in some more kind of real or tangible way

28
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:20,756
even if you know we don't like them or whatever.

29
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:27,640
But we forget that there are thousands and thousands and millions of tiny little details

30
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,282
from many different sources that go into the construction of building these realities.

31
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:39,186
In actuality, game worlds in Call of Duty or GTA are no less abstract in some ways than

32
00:02:39,186 --> 00:02:39,926
Mario or Tetris.

33
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:48,351
They are way, way more detailed and convincing facsimiles of something more resembling our

34
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:49,151
own reality.

35
00:02:52,859 --> 00:03:02,563
A lot of the ideas that we see in games are not really new, instead they're sort of retellings of retellings of retellings.

36
00:03:02,563 --> 00:03:11,726
Maybe this area in the newest Call of Duty game was inspired by the original Alien film or a Superman comic,

37
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:17,288
or maybe it's cribbed from other games like Bioshock or Half-Life or something like that.

38
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:22,076
And I think increasingly, games have been so reflective of themselves

39
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:25,938
that they've stopped being able to acknowledge how constructed the worlds in them are.

40
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:32,022
Because we've seen an idea or a gameplay concept so many times before we start to see it

41
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:33,463
as being part of our reality.

42
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:39,157
And then as a culture, we're kind of unable to accept that these are abstractions,

43
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:43,258
because when you see these kind of images saturated everywhere around you,

44
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:47,760
it's easy to feel like they're current and relevant and kind of speak to you in some way.

45
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,461
And that's kind of the scary thing.

46
00:03:49,461 --> 00:03:53,922
When you put something out into the world, it can affect other people in a really powerful way

47
00:03:53,922 --> 00:03:56,663
that you probably never even considered.

48
00:03:56,663 --> 00:03:57,043
And...

49
00:03:58,003 --> 00:04:01,165
people start to internalize it and it becomes part of the way that we

50
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:04,648
construct like the reality around us outside of a game

51
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:07,351
and I think games do this in a really really powerful way

52
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:11,094
but the kind of weird paradox here is

53
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:15,457
that while game worlds are like feel increasingly real and sort of powerful

54
00:04:15,457 --> 00:04:16,779
almost hyper real

55
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,623
uh... there's still kind of like an undeniable fakeness to it like you know

56
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:24,265
the uncanny valley that kind of stuff

57
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:25,866
and it doesn't ever really go away

58
00:04:28,387 --> 00:04:31,808
But I don't think this is actually really a bad thing at all.

59
00:04:31,808 --> 00:04:38,871
I think, like, contrary to popular belief, their fakeness provides us a different way

60
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:45,733
of looking at our reality and looking at ourselves, and realizing ideas or feelings that we can't

61
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:49,915
fully experience in our own reality through the language of this machine.

62
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:54,837
We just have to understand that it's a machine, and this is the language that it's speaking

63
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,497
in, and it is not our own reality.

64
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:05,167
And, you know, games can put us outsiders kind of might fear games because they're kind

65
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:09,570
of an unknown or they put people into this, like, trance-like state.

66
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:17,096
But it can just as easily be kind of a dreaming or meditative or contemplative or playful

67
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:23,081
state as kind of like a violent, angry, control-obsessed one that, like, the cliched image of video

68
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:23,682
games is.

69
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:23,922
Okay.

70
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:24,002
Okay.

71
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:24,162
Okay.

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,304
So the disclaimer is this talk is not about how to kind of realize more abstract design

73
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:34,625
ideas through AAA.

74
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,126
I don't have experience with that.

75
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:41,430
I am here to tell you about kind of smaller, more independent things and talk about ideas

76
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,652
that you might not have realized, but I can't help with that.

77
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:47,133
I think this is more intended to be inspirational.

78
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:56,533
and kind of communicating with fellow game designers

79
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:58,695
or people thinking about games,

80
00:05:58,695 --> 00:06:02,018
or just curious and wanna be introduced to new things.

81
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:03,600
I'm also, you know, this is like,

82
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,342
I'm not gonna be up, get up here and like shit talk AAA

83
00:06:06,342 --> 00:06:10,206
because I don't have time to, and it's not really worth it.

84
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:12,588
Like, you all are probably intimately familiar

85
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:14,109
with all the problems of AAA,

86
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:16,332
so I don't really need to talk about that.

87
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,732
So this is a game, sorry the screenshot is quite big so it takes up the...

88
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:25,535
This game's called Strange Climbing by Strangethink.

89
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:30,197
He actually has a game downstairs at the Mild Rumpus, kind of like an art gallery game.

90
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:34,099
But I like this game because it's kind of a procedural first-person climber

91
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:38,662
where your goal is just to make it to the top of this weird structure.

92
00:06:38,662 --> 00:06:41,163
And it's generated, obviously.

93
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:50,387
But I find it interesting how the mechanics of the game are so integrated into the actual structure itself.

94
00:06:50,387 --> 00:06:59,391
Like, the geometry kind of serves both an aesthetic purpose of just being like this weird structure

95
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:04,373
and kind of like the mood of that is like a very distinctive thing.

96
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:10,135
And also like a gameplay purpose where all those kind of jagged edges are like things that you have to interact with

97
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:11,655
and potentially like assess.

98
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:14,538
whether you're able to jump further up.

99
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:20,204
And I actually really like this game because it's very simple but it's very challenging at the same time.

100
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:25,209
And it's all just doing it within this one little structure and the jump key.

101
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:31,209
In a way, I think it's kind of applying the same principle.

102
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:35,215
I saw this when I was in film class,

103
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:39,000
this documentary about this architect, Louis Kahn,

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,422
who sort of wanted his buildings

105
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:42,325
to not hide their raw materials.

106
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:43,246
This is a big kind of.

107
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:48,950
If you saw Robert Yang's talk about level design yesterday, he sort of talks about this, you know,

108
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:57,124
philosophy of more modern architecture is buildings not hiding their materials and stuff like that.

109
00:07:58,205 --> 00:08:04,231
And I think that game by Strangethink is very similar, in that it's completely computer-generated

110
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:09,536
and unreal, but it's still beautiful in a way, even though you can see that it's not

111
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:11,658
like a real structure.

112
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:16,723
It's not hiding the sort of algorithms and whatever that created it in the structure,

113
00:08:16,723 --> 00:08:18,044
it's kind of embracing it.

114
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:24,869
So I don't think that like, you know, not hiding your parts

115
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:27,310
means like, like a lack of polish.

116
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,951
And that's one thing that I want to talk about.

117
00:08:28,951 --> 00:08:33,094
Like, you know, it was a concern when I submitted my talk

118
00:08:33,094 --> 00:08:34,996
that I should talk about this.

119
00:08:34,996 --> 00:08:39,679
Like, I think that polish is kind of a loaded term

120
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,020
or at least a kind of a construction

121
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,341
in a lot of game circles,

122
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:46,043
because we kind of do have, you know,

123
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:48,325
established standards of what polish means.

124
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:51,146
that have come out of industry practices,

125
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:53,648
what it means visually and sound-wise

126
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:56,249
in terms of the design,

127
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:59,411
and what is accessible, what it communicates clearly,

128
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:01,152
what it means to communicate.

129
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:04,754
And usually, or at least often,

130
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:06,835
it's equated to a level of detail

131
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:10,397
or a level of this looks like it's actually

132
00:09:10,397 --> 00:09:14,479
something that was designed and intentionally made.

133
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:21,759
Or it can just mean more shiny and commercial looking.

134
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,261
But I think the point is that constructions are kind of,

135
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:27,902
this is a construction kind of defined

136
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,562
by the culture of games.

137
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:32,123
And it doesn't really necessarily speak to

138
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:34,624
how well the content of the games is conveyed

139
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:38,166
or tell you about what's inside the game.

140
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,687
In fact, there really is kind of no approach

141
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:44,628
that's necessarily better for work across the board.

142
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:48,013
it completely is dependent on what you're kind of trying to express.

143
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:51,279
And there are a lot of kind of range of emotions and ideas

144
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,085
that aren't expressed through this kind of AAA idea,

145
00:09:55,085 --> 00:09:59,351
or even like a more commercial indie idea of what polish means.

146
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:05,743
And I think if you look at something like Polish in kind of a more progressive light,

147
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:11,185
and you look at it as being a reflection of how well a game realizes its ideas,

148
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:13,586
it's more subjective, but it's not arbitrary.

149
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:17,047
Like, there is definitely a difference between things that are kind of like

150
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:24,450
one-off experiments and things that effectively kind of use a particular style or idea to realize their ideas.

151
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,190
And we're going to look at some of those.

152
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:34,120
So this is a game, it looks like a YouTube window, but it's actually a game by Steven Lovell, aka InkRipara,

153
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:41,290
who is probably the most interesting, no, without a doubt, in my opinion, the most interesting game designer who's working today.

154
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:45,896
And I'd say this game is very polished.

155
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,416
It was for like a Ludum Dare.

156
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,497
But like essentially you open it up

157
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:52,537
and it's like this YouTube window

158
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:53,758
and you're actually playing the game

159
00:10:53,758 --> 00:10:55,098
that's inside the window,

160
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:56,978
but it's a finite length that like 210

161
00:10:56,978 --> 00:10:58,299
that it's saying, you know,

162
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,339
that's as long as the game is.

163
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:03,020
And there's a narration over top with this guy,

164
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,980
like boring narration.

165
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,780
This guy is talking about,

166
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,601
yeah, this game is okay, I guess.

167
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,952
And like, and then like random like gay porn windows pop up and

168
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:15,973
you have to like click them out. And then like people like try

169
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:18,534
to message you on messenger and you're trying to like click that

170
00:11:18,534 --> 00:11:21,195
out while you're controlling the thing. And sometimes the cat

171
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:24,137
just jumps on the dude's keyboard and like screws you up

172
00:11:24,137 --> 00:11:25,437
just like and you die.

173
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:32,143
And like so this game is only two minutes long. It's kind of a joke game

174
00:11:32,143 --> 00:11:38,749
But the way that it's presented is really like really effective because you open it up, and it's like what what why am I in?

175
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:43,994
A YouTube window like what is this it has this purpose the presentation has this purpose of sort of

176
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:48,498
defamiliarizing you with your kind of relationship with games and

177
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:49,639
you know

178
00:11:50,891 --> 00:11:52,552
putting it in a different context.

179
00:11:52,552 --> 00:11:55,234
And I think for this purpose, it's like a joke.

180
00:11:55,234 --> 00:11:56,935
It's not really trying to communicate something

181
00:11:56,935 --> 00:12:00,797
narrative-wise, but it does it really, really effectively

182
00:12:00,797 --> 00:12:02,458
and really powerfully, which is why I think

183
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,819
it's a really interesting game.

184
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:06,860
Also, there's this other game by him

185
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,122
that looks, again, completely different.

186
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:12,584
Let's see if I can open it up in, okay, that's another game.

187
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:15,105
Let's see if I can open it up in a window here.

188
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,824
It's called The Terrible Whiteness of Appalachian Nights.

189
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,386
And I'm not going to play very far into it.

190
00:12:23,386 --> 00:12:29,930
But it has this sort of ASCII art style.

191
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:35,534
And it's incredibly disturbing.

192
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:53,852
As you can probably tell, it uses this kind of weird, like, old computer monitor kind of font to make, to kind of, you know, give off a particular feeling of weirdness and disorientation.

193
00:12:53,852 --> 00:12:59,196
It's really well reflected by the audio, and I think the audio really does the strongest work in this game.

194
00:12:59,196 --> 00:12:59,896
But, I'm going to skip all this.

195
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,612
Essentially all you do in this game is wander around and you're this like, ASCII character

196
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:09,793
and this crazy, weird, frantic music plays in the background.

197
00:13:09,793 --> 00:13:14,735
And you're this like, housewife who's aimlessly wandering around her house, kind of periodically

198
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:20,916
checking up on members of her family, and basically all she does is sleep.

199
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:24,658
And most of it you're just kind of wandering around frantically.

200
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:31,324
just like checking on your family members and uh, I don't know, the- this- the music

201
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:32,867
and stuff is just like...

202
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:37,892
There's almost kind of like a dissociative approach to the...

203
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:41,793
Like the visuals is almost like kind of reflecting the dissociation of the character.

204
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:47,335
That there's something like really disturbing sort of going on under the surface.

205
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:51,956
And that everything kind of in her life has been abstracted to these symbols

206
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:56,597
that she just doesn't know how to control or do anything with anymore.

207
00:13:56,937 --> 00:14:02,820
And this all kind of builds up to a really bizarre, not safe for work moment at the end

208
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,723
that I don't really know what it means, but kind of reflects the mood of the game.

209
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:12,225
So I guess the point that I wanted to get across here is that this game uses that kind

210
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:19,549
of style to, you know, that we associate with very kind of older games that don't have that

211
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:25,903
didn't have the graphical capabilities to realize much and it embraces it as kind of

212
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:29,085
a reflection of the narrative themes of the game.

213
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:33,747
Another game sort of indirect contrast by him is called Slave of God.

214
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,728
I'll show you a video here.

215
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:38,149
It's like a really bizarre.

216
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:42,911
game where you're in a dance club and you're just like wandering around and dancing with people.

217
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:46,755
Essentially it looks like, um, like being on drugs.

218
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:51,079
Um, but like, you know, when people say like, oh this looks like being on drugs,

219
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:53,882
no this game like literally looks like being on drugs.

220
00:14:54,282 --> 00:15:01,367
It like has this all these like bizarre shader effects, but um it like kind of

221
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,789
captures this feeling way more

222
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:14,615
Directly and sort of powerfully than other any other games that I've seen that sort of oh goodness. Well you get the idea anyway

223
00:15:14,615 --> 00:15:15,035
um and

224
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:20,368
I don't know, it's really effective in a kind of a way that's hard to convey.

225
00:15:20,368 --> 00:15:27,816
But the point is that these games, while they're all very different, kind of really effectively

226
00:15:27,816 --> 00:15:30,639
convey what they're setting out to capture.

227
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,082
And they use all the tools of games to do this.

228
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:38,406
They use the visuals, they use the design, they use the interface, they use the audio,

229
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:39,307
as you've seen.

230
00:15:39,307 --> 00:15:39,708
Like...

231
00:15:40,008 --> 00:15:42,389
which is a really overlooked component, by the way,

232
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:44,970
as someone who's like a composer and sound designer

233
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,692
of like conveying sort of narrative

234
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:52,414
or ideas that you want to convey in a game.

235
00:15:52,414 --> 00:15:57,117
And I think this is why I find his work really interesting.

236
00:15:57,117 --> 00:16:01,739
It's all completely based on what idea he's trying to realize

237
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:06,741
and the visuals and everything are kind of just all in service

238
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:08,262
to whatever idea he's trying to realize.

239
00:16:08,262 --> 00:16:09,563
And that's why I think he's...

240
00:16:09,945 --> 00:16:13,486
like probably the most interesting game designer working in games right now.

241
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:19,828
So this is another designer who's a little less well known.

242
00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:21,968
His name is Pedro Paiva.

243
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:22,868
I think that's how you pronounce it.

244
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:23,608
He's Brazilian.

245
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:27,089
This game's called Carro Crescia.

246
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:30,110
And like literally, it runs even faster than this.

247
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,491
This just animated GIF is slowed down because, you know, I blew it up and everything.

248
00:16:35,051 --> 00:16:39,873
But, um, it's a short game and basically all you can do is, like, you can't cross the road

249
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:44,154
because there's too many cars, like, and you're just like, your character's frowning, and

250
00:16:44,154 --> 00:16:49,196
then you go into, like, the car god, like, um, garage here and then they just tell you

251
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:51,756
you don't have a car so you can't do anything.

252
00:16:51,756 --> 00:16:52,016
And like...

253
00:16:54,307 --> 00:16:59,489
And that's all it is, it's like this really, like, weird, sarcastic commentary about cars,

254
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:02,830
and like, why you need a car for everything, and like,

255
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:07,732
it just conveys it in this kind of like weird, like, bootleg game-looking style,

256
00:17:07,732 --> 00:17:13,334
where, you know, it just seems like this kind of like weird amateurish thing,

257
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:17,455
but it reflects kind of the weird tone of the game, and, um...

258
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:22,436
the kind of anarchic sort of ideas that he is trying to get across.

259
00:17:22,436 --> 00:17:26,637
His games are almost kind of like I describe as being like anti-games.

260
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:29,177
So if I can get this to run, this is another game of his.

261
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:33,858
It's like a compilation of, it seems like some kind of compilation of arcade games.

262
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:36,299
This one's called Mel Gibson the Hedgehog.

263
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,499
See, I don't speak Spanish, but...

264
00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:42,180
You open the game and it does this.

265
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,360
Sometimes it just randomly crashes, I don't know.

266
00:17:45,817 --> 00:17:49,580
But these are all like broken arcade games, basically.

267
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,604
And this is like, as you can tell, this is, I don't know if you guys are Sonic fans, but

268
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:59,749
this is the Green Hill Zone music.

269
00:17:59,749 --> 00:18:03,252
Oh no, I died.

270
00:18:03,252 --> 00:18:06,515
And here's another game that I like a lot.

271
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:12,218
Yeah, every game does this when you hit start and sometimes it just crashes.

272
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:15,880
And you're like this little frenzy thing running around.

273
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,883
I don't know actually what the goal in this game is.

274
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:29,510
Most of the other ones have goals, but I like what happens when you die.

275
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,252
Anyway, that's called VHS Maluko.

276
00:18:32,252 --> 00:18:34,754
And it's sort of a compilation of like...

277
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:42,483
really weird, anti-game, sarcastic takes on old arcade games.

278
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:49,667
And the games are hardly playable, but there's an undeniable artistic sensibility that runs

279
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:53,589
through his games of this kind of anarchist, like...

280
00:18:55,489 --> 00:19:01,632
you know, uh, like, idea of, like, the game's, the game mechanics are dishonest, and they're

281
00:19:01,632 --> 00:19:06,275
kind of disingenuous, and, and we need to kind of destroy them or melt them.

282
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:10,677
And actually, it's something that he talks about, like, called melting video games, and

283
00:19:10,677 --> 00:19:15,059
he says, um, from his Patreon, it's, uh, when I talk about melting video games, I'm thinking

284
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:21,826
of corroding the borders that maintains the most diverse part of people away from the inside community.

285
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:23,308
He's not a native English speaker, so...

286
00:19:23,308 --> 00:19:26,471
And the inside people stuck in.

287
00:19:26,471 --> 00:19:31,456
I love video games, but I hate the mainstream culture around it.

288
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:35,080
And I think, like, the...

289
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,460
You know, the...

290
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,290
The reaction that a lot of people would have is,

291
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,891
oh, these games look amateurish.

292
00:19:39,891 --> 00:19:41,653
But if you play them, you realize

293
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:44,455
that there's something very different about these games.

294
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:50,220
They are very simple, and they are very abstract

295
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,381
and broken looking.

296
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:53,983
But there's kind of a philosophy or sensibility

297
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,326
that's reflected in the design and in the way

298
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:58,768
that it's presented.

299
00:19:58,768 --> 00:20:01,530
And I think that's something that we need to understand

300
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,631
is very intentional.

301
00:20:02,631 --> 00:20:03,652
And it's something that

302
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:13,700
is using this kind of idea of glitch or like brokenness as part of its philosophy rather than just doing it as a trend or whatever.

303
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,742
So I think it's really important to make that distinction.

304
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:20,585
And it's, yeah, it's not just done because it's easy to do.

305
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:25,469
I mean, it might be easy to do and that's a good reason to do something,

306
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:27,631
but that's not the only reason to do something.

307
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:30,493
Or really, the best reason to do something.

308
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:38,096
So, like, abstraction is not just about glitch or looking weird in 8-bit.

309
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:44,865
There are plenty of, like, I think horror games are really the best at kind of realizing

310
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:50,372
abstraction, you know, embracing abstraction and using that in kind of the game mechanics,

311
00:20:50,372 --> 00:20:51,514
you know, reflecting what...

312
00:20:52,254 --> 00:20:57,620
They want to get across and which is usually a feeling of like terror or disorientation. This game is called nevermind

313
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,043
It just had a kickstarter recently

314
00:21:00,043 --> 00:21:04,447
And like this is the main area that you are outside where there's this like bizarre

315
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:07,491
models of the 3d house that are like stacked

316
00:21:07,491 --> 00:21:12,396
Like 3d models of a house that are just stacked up on top of each other in a really surreal way and when you play

317
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:12,937
It it's like

318
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:20,762
obviously intended to reflect this kind of idea that the house is a terrifying place

319
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:27,106
and it's like building up on your sort of the characters or your sort of like anxieties about

320
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:33,871
being in the house and you see that it's a very like easy visual metaphor that kind of reflects

321
00:21:33,871 --> 00:21:38,033
what the game is trying to get across. Something that we understand intuitively but might not

322
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:41,836
necessarily be able to explain. I think like horror games do that really well.

323
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:46,519
Like I said, these visuals are very, quote unquote, polished in the conventional sense,

324
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:52,664
but it's still doing something very weird with the form that is different and abstract

325
00:21:52,664 --> 00:21:58,528
and not real in like the representational realism sense.

326
00:21:58,528 --> 00:22:05,714
This is a shot from Silent Hill 4, and you have this character who's like wandering around

327
00:22:05,714 --> 00:22:06,795
with you in your apartment.

328
00:22:06,795 --> 00:22:08,336
She's pretty nice.

329
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:11,698
But she just gets kind of...

330
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:15,862
beaten up throughout the game, especially if you play badly.

331
00:22:15,862 --> 00:22:17,623
And sometimes at the end of the game,

332
00:22:17,623 --> 00:22:20,866
she'll just be in bandages and just bruised all over.

333
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:23,868
But there's this room where you just sort of randomly

334
00:22:23,868 --> 00:22:26,911
enter into, and a huge version of her head

335
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:30,734
just stares at you, and its eyes are sort of twitching.

336
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:34,017
And it's this really odd moment that

337
00:22:34,017 --> 00:22:37,980
isn't necessarily explained in the plot or the story

338
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,041
or anything.

339
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,803
But I think it kind of.

340
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:46,272
is something that the Silent Hill games in particular are really good at doing.

341
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:54,237
Reflecting the themes of the games in a very kind of surreal way

342
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:58,500
that's hard to really verbally express why it works or what it's saying.

343
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,123
But it has this incredibly strong impact on you when you're playing.

344
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:06,885
And it's not just an impact of being scared.

345
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:10,127
It's also like, what is this? Why am I experiencing this?

346
00:23:10,968 --> 00:23:18,713
it kind of pressures you to think about your relationship with the game in a way that you might not normally do so.

347
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:29,135
moment that I think about a lot is in Silent Hill 2, where it's towards the end of the

348
00:23:29,135 --> 00:23:32,338
game. I think they do this in several Silent Hill games, but like, you're in this sort

349
00:23:32,338 --> 00:23:37,682
of hotel and your character is kind of, without spoiling too much, like your character's kind

350
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:41,986
of psychological world is falling apart and you know, you have like very clear maps and

351
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:44,608
layouts in the game, but um...

352
00:23:45,528 --> 00:23:48,830
And at this point, it starts raining inside the hotel,

353
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,792
which is already like, what is this doing?

354
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:54,454
And you open a door and you go to a completely other side

355
00:23:54,454 --> 00:23:56,235
of the hotel in a completely different room,

356
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:58,917
and all the doors just start connecting with each other

357
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:01,779
in this really bizarre way, unpredictable way.

358
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:04,281
And it's something that games like,

359
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:07,162
it's almost arbitrary what door that you enter into

360
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:09,264
where it leads you in a game, right?

361
00:24:09,264 --> 00:24:10,805
Like, it's just anything,

362
00:24:10,805 --> 00:24:12,366
it's something that you can change easily.

363
00:24:14,548 --> 00:24:21,513
But it's using this in a way to kind of reflect the mood of the game

364
00:24:21,513 --> 00:24:25,136
and kind of defamiliarize your relationship with the space

365
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:31,841
and say that this is kind of a psychological world, this is not really a real world.

366
00:24:31,841 --> 00:24:38,366
And I think it's something that games are incredibly good at doing.

367
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:43,289
So another game that's one of my favorite games is called Yume Nikki.

368
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:47,170
It's a free Japanese game, RPG Maker game.

369
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,871
And it's another game sort of about dreams.

370
00:24:48,871 --> 00:24:52,093
Let's see if I can show you a video quickly.

371
00:24:52,093 --> 00:24:55,714
And you sort of, you're this little girl,

372
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:59,516
and you wander around this kind of weird surreal world.

373
00:24:59,516 --> 00:25:01,677
Let's skip ahead so that I can...

374
00:25:01,677 --> 00:25:06,299
And you enter from your apartment, you enter into this...

375
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:07,780
I don't know. Okay.

376
00:25:08,836 --> 00:25:13,878
You enter into this like bizarre hallway of doors and the doors kind of send you through

377
00:25:13,878 --> 00:25:20,200
to these very surreal worlds which the further that you go into it the more kind of the less

378
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,102
abstract they become and the more kind of reflective of something that this girl might

379
00:25:25,102 --> 00:25:32,885
be experiencing you actually see like and you're actually able to extrapolate some narrative

380
00:25:32,885 --> 00:25:33,285
from it.

381
00:25:33,627 --> 00:25:39,675
but it's a very kind of non-linear narrative that isn't really, like, something that you can explicitly define.

382
00:25:39,675 --> 00:25:41,678
But I think, like, this game has a huge following.

383
00:25:41,678 --> 00:25:44,481
People have tried to just kind of interpret the plot.

384
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:46,884
There's a lot of, like, discussion about it.

385
00:25:46,884 --> 00:25:48,306
And it's all because this kind of...

386
00:25:48,987 --> 00:25:55,291
just curiosity of exploring this game and like all the these bizarre symbols what they mean and

387
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:59,674
and what your relationship with them is because it's something that's just so different from

388
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:03,697
from what other games try to do because really like you have these objects that you can use to

389
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:07,600
do certain things but really basically all you do is wander around and there isn't really any

390
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,883
sort of direction that you're guided towards so that

391
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:17,307
kind of allows you to have your own relationship with the game and experience it in a different

392
00:26:17,307 --> 00:26:24,212
way than something is like, yeah, she just got the frog power and now she can turn into

393
00:26:24,212 --> 00:26:26,434
a frog.

394
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:29,756
But yeah, let's exit out of that.

395
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:37,022
I think in a way, a game like Yume Nikki is kind of a metaphor for all games because we

396
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:41,690
We enter into these doors, we enter into these digital spaces not knowing what's going to come out.

397
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:46,712
We know it's not real, we know it's going to like change us in some way,

398
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:50,634
and we're going to have some certain interaction with it, but it's kind of mysterious.

399
00:26:50,634 --> 00:26:57,717
It's almost like we're kind of injecting ourselves with something without really knowing what is going to happen.

400
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:14,688
But these doors, like, through their kind of weird abstract machine language and, like, these kind of array of symbols, tell us something about ourselves and tell us something about the way that we experience the world.

401
00:27:14,688 --> 00:27:17,710
And I think that's tremendously beautiful and powerful.

402
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,191
Games are in basically dreams.

403
00:27:29,054 --> 00:27:34,017
So before I continue on my last thing, I just want to mention a few games by women, because

404
00:27:34,017 --> 00:27:38,280
I didn't do that in this talk, and I feel really bad about that, but there are some

405
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,943
games that I also think that you should really check out.

406
00:27:42,943 --> 00:27:47,847
Some games by Lilith, who made this game called Crip Worlds, which I'm biased because I did

407
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:51,549
like the sound effects and the music for it, but she has another game called, what is it

408
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:51,830
called?

409
00:27:52,714 --> 00:28:07,073
Oneiric Gardens? I don't know how to... Oneiric Gardens? I don't know how to pronounce it, but it's like this kind of anthology of different weird 3D spaces that kind of seems like old PlayStation 1 games and kind of reinterpreting it.

410
00:28:07,073 --> 00:28:11,158
Another game that's interesting that was almost in the IGF but not quite nominated is called Curtain.

411
00:28:11,478 --> 00:28:18,005
by Laura Dreamfield. It has this really kind of bizarre lo-fi style and it's kind of more of a narrative game.

412
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:24,032
That one's definitely worth checking out. And also, one of the games that's in the Nuovo this year is called Tetragedon Games.

413
00:28:24,032 --> 00:28:30,939
I think those games are tremendously, like, really, really cool and kind of use this, like, cheesy...

414
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:41,606
90s kind of net art AOL kind of old flash movie style to kind of get at their own aesthetic

415
00:28:41,606 --> 00:28:46,470
thing. So those are all worth checking out. But this is a game called Judith which is

416
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:54,255
also by Ingrapar and Terry Kavanaugh who is somewhere at the conference. And it's a game

417
00:28:54,255 --> 00:28:58,558
that I keep coming back to because I had a real relationship with like Wolfenstein 3D

418
00:28:58,558 --> 00:28:59,318
when I grew up.

419
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,805
that sort of, like, there's a sort of disturbingness to that game that's never really kind of put to the surface,

420
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:11,331
but you sort of, it's sort of implied at in some of the level design, and some of the other things like that.

421
00:29:11,331 --> 00:29:16,257
And so I kind of just like imagined and extrapolated based on that. I've written some articles about it that are...

422
00:29:16,937 --> 00:29:19,278
worth checking out if you're interested in that.

423
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:21,718
But the thing that I like about Judith is it takes this

424
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,439
like raycaster 3D style, you know,

425
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:26,520
essentially 2D, 3D style,

426
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,461
and it kind of owns it and uses

427
00:29:30,461 --> 00:29:33,362
and brings that disturbingness to the surface

428
00:29:33,362 --> 00:29:36,082
as part of the narrative theme, which is about this,

429
00:29:36,082 --> 00:29:39,183
it's essentially about the story of Bluebeard

430
00:29:39,183 --> 00:29:40,824
and it's about this woman finding out

431
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:42,584
that her husband is actually this horrible guy

432
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:44,505
who's doing all these horrible things.

433
00:29:45,465 --> 00:29:54,347
And there's another aspect to the narrative, but essentially, like, it's about this woman wandering around, kind of experiencing things passively.

434
00:29:54,347 --> 00:30:07,510
And I think that it's an interesting kind of gender metaphor in there, along with Yume Nikki, about, like, the ways that women are kind of taught to interact with the world through, like, kind of passively and observation.

435
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:14,821
you know, rather than this kind of traditional masculine view of how we approach games,

436
00:30:14,821 --> 00:30:18,327
where it's about interacting and sort of controlling and manipulating systems.

437
00:30:18,327 --> 00:30:20,210
But anyway, that's just something I thought about.

438
00:30:22,795 --> 00:30:28,037
With the history that we create, we sort of leave traces of the past behind.

439
00:30:28,037 --> 00:30:32,238
Ideas or styles that we might have thought were dead keep popping up again in different contexts.

440
00:30:32,238 --> 00:30:35,940
There is kind of an eeriness to the old that never quite goes away.

441
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,980
It's almost like a ghost.

442
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:43,182
It's almost as if it is still calling out to us to be kind of exhumed and re-explored

443
00:30:43,182 --> 00:30:44,583
with all that we know now.

444
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:48,084
Conventional wisdom in games.

445
00:30:49,352 --> 00:30:53,374
says that the legacy of a lot of old forgotten games

446
00:30:53,374 --> 00:30:57,155
was that they were stepping stones or they were the results of technological

447
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,136
struggles or dead ends

448
00:30:59,136 --> 00:31:02,397
or sometimes even just like embarrassments like we wanna bury them

449
00:31:02,397 --> 00:31:04,317
in the ground and forget about them like

450
00:31:04,317 --> 00:31:08,339
the ET story, the famous story about ET

451
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:11,920
being buried in like a

452
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,800
I don't know it's like a

453
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:21,085
under concrete in Arizona. There was a documentary about them digging it up. We've sort of inevitably

454
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:25,265
thrown them out for more polished or easy to play or easy to look at games. In many

455
00:31:25,265 --> 00:31:31,067
ways, of course, we have improved the craft of games exponentially, design wise and game

456
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:38,789
play wise. A game as singularly industry defining as Mario was so huge because it was a huge

457
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:43,150
improvement over what came before and Mario 3 is a huge improvement over Mario.

458
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:49,194
We built that language, we know what works well, we know what feels better and smoother

459
00:31:49,194 --> 00:31:55,139
to the player, but in other ways I still think we're left wanting for something more.

460
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:59,982
I know there's a lot of attitudes around game culture now that like to kind of assert that

461
00:31:59,982 --> 00:32:00,603
games are bad.

462
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,482
games are all about like Mario and Doom and Pac-Man and that's like games culture

463
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:07,444
and that's what like gamers are and that's

464
00:32:07,444 --> 00:32:09,685
that's that that gamer culture but that

465
00:32:09,685 --> 00:32:11,746
that whole thing is a construction like

466
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:15,629
weird art experimental games have always existed

467
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:18,051
even before Mario and we need to

468
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:22,554
realize that like as part of the industry we need to realize

469
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:26,496
part of the history of this medium and respect it and not just like

470
00:32:27,197 --> 00:32:33,342
you know, go with the Kool-Aid token narrative that everyone kind of just blindly accepts.

471
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:38,005
Here are some very strange games from the 80s. This one's called Microsurgeon.

472
00:32:38,005 --> 00:32:42,909
It's for the Intellivision. You're kind of controlling this thing and you're like shooting this bacteria.

473
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:45,712
It came out in 1982, which is three years before Mario.

474
00:32:45,712 --> 00:32:52,357
This game's called Deus Ex Machina. It's a Spectrum game. It's one of the first, like, art experiment games.

475
00:32:52,357 --> 00:32:56,280
There's actually voiceover narration through the whole thing. It's because it was on a cassette, like...

476
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,842
ZX Spectrum had sort of a cassette player.

477
00:32:59,842 --> 00:33:03,323
And yeah, it was a kind of interesting, ambitious game,

478
00:33:03,323 --> 00:33:06,124
even though it was kind of, you know, had its own problems.

479
00:33:06,124 --> 00:33:10,866
This game's called Go to Hell for the ZX Spectrum.

480
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:14,168
The same guy did another game called Soft and Cuddly,

481
00:33:14,168 --> 00:33:16,108
which is also equally weird.

482
00:33:16,108 --> 00:33:17,569
But this came out the same year as Mario,

483
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:20,270
and it's just as bizarre as any, like,

484
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,931
random weird indie game that you're gonna find online.

485
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:25,252
Probably even more bizarre, to be honest.

486
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:31,453
In spite of the technological limitations of these games,

487
00:33:31,453 --> 00:33:34,615
they still speak to us,

488
00:33:34,615 --> 00:33:41,920
and there's still something that makes us able to see something about them in the present.

489
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:49,086
Their unapologetic abstractness reveals something natural and intrinsic about the form of games.

490
00:33:50,286 --> 00:33:55,552
I don't know, I just think that it's important to realize that this kind of experimentation has always been around.

491
00:33:55,552 --> 00:34:02,480
But I believe that we need to start embracing abstractness as a virtue rather than a shortcoming.

492
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,007
If we're really interested in expanding the form of games, we should be leaving no stone unturned.

493
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:10,149
And of course that doesn't mean that all games have to look like...

494
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,557
weird 8-bit punk games or whatever, but at the very least we can be open to the ideas

495
00:34:15,557 --> 00:34:20,044
that are in these games and respect them and take inspiration from them even when they're

496
00:34:20,044 --> 00:34:22,969
broken and, you know, they have design weaknesses.

497
00:34:24,742 --> 00:34:25,963
Games are dreams.

498
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:29,265
Their gaminess, quote unquote, is a central part

499
00:34:29,265 --> 00:34:29,986
of this dream.

500
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:31,887
It's the source of their power.

501
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:33,488
It's their light.

502
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,471
And I believe that we do ourselves a huge disservice

503
00:34:36,471 --> 00:34:38,652
to this medium the more that we spend trying

504
00:34:38,652 --> 00:34:41,935
to tame this abstractness, this gaminess,

505
00:34:41,935 --> 00:34:44,097
in order to build something more predictable

506
00:34:44,097 --> 00:34:45,858
and representational and known,

507
00:34:45,858 --> 00:34:49,821
instead of sincerely trying to explore something new

508
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,103
and unknown that might tell us something different

509
00:34:52,103 --> 00:34:54,064
about ourselves and the world around us.

510
00:34:54,365 --> 00:34:54,765
Thank you.

511
00:34:54,765 --> 00:35:09,380
I'm sorry, I went a little bit over time.

512
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,723
I don't know if there's any time for questions.

513
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:17,133
I do have time. If you want to ask a few questions, go up to

514
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:23,019
the mic. I have a question. That was awesome. I really liked

515
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:26,603
how you made game art topics very fun and approachable. My

516
00:35:26,603 --> 00:35:30,187
question is can you give us the 30 second summary of your take

517
00:35:30,187 --> 00:35:32,169
on the wolf 3D aesthetic?

518
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:39,134
you said you had a whole thing you wrote about the eeriness.

519
00:35:39,134 --> 00:35:44,216
Yeah. I think there's sort of a the game is about something

520
00:35:44,216 --> 00:35:48,278
that's very kind of real like representational. It's about

521
00:35:48,278 --> 00:35:51,159
sort of like World War II. But then there's this kind of

522
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:51,720
bizarre.

523
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,921
gaminess about it where you have to collect all this treasure and there's

524
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:58,202
like no way that you could carry all this treasure and they're just like

525
00:35:58,202 --> 00:36:02,723
turkey dinners lying on the floor and I think it kind of it kind of toes the

526
00:36:02,723 --> 00:36:07,405
line between having some sort of like realistic art and then having this like

527
00:36:07,405 --> 00:36:10,926
weird gaminess that is actually kind of disturbing and I don't know if it's

528
00:36:10,926 --> 00:36:16,047
intentional but it's just something that I've always kind of thought about and

529
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:19,611
had weird dreams about and things like that.

530
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:21,293
So I don't know, that's just my personal.

531
00:36:21,293 --> 00:36:22,514
It's like a little grotesque, right?

532
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,996
Yeah, it is a little grotesque.

533
00:36:23,996 --> 00:36:26,899
And that can be really kind of bad,

534
00:36:26,899 --> 00:36:27,960
and that can be a good thing,

535
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,823
and I don't really know which way to take it with that game,

536
00:36:30,823 --> 00:36:33,806
but I think it's interesting for me to think about

537
00:36:33,806 --> 00:36:35,908
and look at as an illustration of other things anyway.

538
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:39,590
you felt like that other game you were comparing it with was

539
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:44,493
similar in that sense? It uses the same sort of ray caster

540
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,875
format but it brings that disturbingness to the surface as

541
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:52,137
part of the theme of the game as the narrative. I see those two

542
00:36:52,137 --> 00:36:55,419
things as being related just because of the kind of style.

543
00:36:55,419 --> 00:36:57,180
It's the same thing with like the game itself.

544
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,361
the game terrible whiteness of Appalachian nights. There are a

545
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:03,823
lot of old games that have that ASCII art but this is using it

546
00:37:03,823 --> 00:37:07,404
in a different way and reappropriating it for something

547
00:37:07,404 --> 00:37:13,987
that was always kind of there but never really kind of called

548
00:37:13,987 --> 00:37:14,907
attention to. No problem.

549
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:17,024
I have a question.

550
00:37:17,024 --> 00:37:18,906
Sure.

551
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:23,092
If we compare game development with art,

552
00:37:23,092 --> 00:37:30,702
and if we see the path that the classic visual art followed

553
00:37:30,702 --> 00:37:31,363
from some.

554
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:39,211
primitive forms, then to realism, and then to some surrealism, some abstract art.

555
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:48,239
Do you think that game development will follow the same path? And now we are seeing that it

556
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:51,363
turns from some realism to some more

557
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:59,085
abstract forms. I think there's some universal patterns but it's also not probably going to

558
00:37:59,085 --> 00:38:04,306
happen in exactly the same way. But I also think it's kind of happening with a lot of indie games

559
00:38:04,306 --> 00:38:10,548
and experimental games. It's always been around. It's just like it being sort of popularized and

560
00:38:10,548 --> 00:38:15,089
understood it might take a while because games are tremendously complicated. There's a lot of

561
00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:17,569
things that go into understanding and interacting with games.

562
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:25,372
newer generations of people are able to deal with navigating all these technological interfaces

563
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:30,954
and stuff because they grow up with it. It's so intuitive and central to their part of life. So I

564
00:38:30,954 --> 00:38:35,136
think that the culture and literacy around games is definitely going to develop and that's going

565
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:40,318
to result in more weird abstract things. But yeah. No problem. Okay. I have to take it to the

566
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,018
wrap-up room. So I'm sorry. But I would ‑‑

567
00:38:49,983 --> 00:38:57,616
Thank you. If any questions, feel free to come up to me later. I hope you have a good rest of

568
00:38:57,616 --> 00:39:01,062
your day. Come to Lost Levels 1 p.m.
