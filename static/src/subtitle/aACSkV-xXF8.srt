1
00:00:06,558 --> 00:00:07,879
All right, let's get started.

2
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:11,581
Hello and happy Friday of GDC.

3
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:15,103
I have to say, I'm so glad that this talk is on a Friday

4
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:17,504
because after a wild week, you know,

5
00:00:17,604 --> 00:00:19,745
I think we all need to decompress a little bit.

6
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:21,766
So I think the timing was great.

7
00:00:21,846 --> 00:00:23,187
And thank you all for being here

8
00:00:23,247 --> 00:00:25,468
because it's still kind of early

9
00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:27,469
and the GDC parties go all night.

10
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:29,070
So I'm honored that you're even here.

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,291
Thank you so, so much for coming.

12
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:33,573
I've been asked to remind you to make sure

13
00:00:33,593 --> 00:00:35,374
you fill out your surveys and turn your phones off.

14
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:36,174
So.

15
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,765
This is Meditation for Devs,

16
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,308
Maintaining Your Sanity for Crunch and Beyond.

17
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:43,491
So, let's get started.

18
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:45,393
I'm Amanda Gardner,

19
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:49,077
and that really encapsulates my insane life.

20
00:00:49,798 --> 00:00:52,001
I am a yoga and meditation teacher.

21
00:00:52,722 --> 00:00:54,464
I'm a mindfulness speaker.

22
00:00:54,684 --> 00:00:56,827
I travel around the country talking about mindfulness.

23
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:59,688
I also am the co-founder of The Deep End Games,

24
00:01:00,148 --> 00:01:02,769
where I wrote Perception, which came out last year.

25
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:05,310
It is a first-person thriller

26
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,970
about a blind woman exploring a haunted mansion

27
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,431
using echolocation the way a bat sees,

28
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:13,652
and it's out on PS4 and Xbox One, Steam,

29
00:01:13,852 --> 00:01:15,452
and it just came out on Switch this fall.

30
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:17,393
I'm also a mom of four.

31
00:01:18,573 --> 00:01:21,054
I have two babies and two bigger kids,

32
00:01:21,754 --> 00:01:24,615
and so my life, I really need the meditation

33
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:25,555
and the mindfulness.

34
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:29,157
But a couple of years ago, my life was completely different.

35
00:01:29,497 --> 00:01:33,458
I was an English teacher in my hometown for about over 10 years.

36
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:35,539
I only had two kids.

37
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,599
That's our Smash Brothers Halloween.

38
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,000
We thought we were pretty cool.

39
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,000
I still think we're pretty cool.

40
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:46,882
And I spent some time as a stay-at-home mom, and my husband was a really cool AAA veteran.

41
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:49,503
That was my only link to the industry.

42
00:01:49,563 --> 00:01:53,104
My husband was the lead designer on Bioshock and the design director on Bioshock Infinite,

43
00:01:53,124 --> 00:01:53,664
Bill Gardner.

44
00:01:53,724 --> 00:01:54,324
Some of you know him.

45
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:57,663
How did I get here?

46
00:01:58,884 --> 00:02:01,087
Things got really interesting when Irrational closed.

47
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:04,571
Bill decided that we were going to make a game from our basement.

48
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:05,892
And I said, OK.

49
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:12,680
So a year ago today, we had one game in Crunch, a toddler,

50
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:14,041
a newborn.

51
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,538
And we both got mono.

52
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:17,939
Like, we're adults.

53
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:19,560
Like, how do adults even get mono?

54
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,161
We got mono.

55
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:23,023
And it's because we were so run down,

56
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,566
our bodies were just like a garbage fire.

57
00:02:26,586 --> 00:02:27,087
It was pretty.

58
00:02:28,172 --> 00:02:32,313
pretty brutal. And we just shut down. Like our brains weren't working right. We

59
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,654
couldn't take care of ourselves. We couldn't take care of our kids. And our

60
00:02:34,714 --> 00:02:40,577
game was in crunch. And it was us in our basement. And so I sort of

61
00:02:40,637 --> 00:02:45,139
learned to resuscitate us. And that's what this is about. If I can impart any

62
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,780
of what I learned to you, then it'll be worth it for me.

63
00:02:50,397 --> 00:02:52,859
I really want to teach you to be present and relaxed.

64
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:55,540
And in Crunch and beyond in life,

65
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,421
these are sort of the two things

66
00:02:57,461 --> 00:03:00,823
that can really make or break development.

67
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:05,565
So when you're present at work,

68
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:08,847
you make less mistakes, less iteration.

69
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:10,728
You're not multitasking, you're unitasking,

70
00:03:10,788 --> 00:03:11,848
and you are in the now.

71
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:15,850
We actually spend 80% of our headspace

72
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,231
in the past and in the future.

73
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,300
If you checked in with your brain, say, every hour or so,

74
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,021
80% of the time, you'd be dwelling on something

75
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,002
that already happened and thinking about rewriting it,

76
00:03:25,502 --> 00:03:27,203
or you would be perseverating on something

77
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:29,604
that's going to happen or probably never going to happen

78
00:03:29,964 --> 00:03:30,845
when you really think about it.

79
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:34,167
Only 20% of the time are we really here,

80
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:35,607
where we are right now.

81
00:03:35,947 --> 00:03:38,209
And so with these tactics, I'd love to teach you

82
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,989
to expand your 20%.

83
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:41,630
Hey, even if you can get it to 30%,

84
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:43,191
it's an improvement, right?

85
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:45,902
And be relaxed.

86
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:48,504
Bill and I really shut down, our bodies shut down

87
00:03:48,564 --> 00:03:52,367
because we were constantly crunching on something,

88
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:55,008
whether it was the babies and not sleeping

89
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:57,050
or eating poorly because we couldn't even

90
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,431
take care of ourselves.

91
00:03:59,131 --> 00:04:00,892
When you get your body to cooperate,

92
00:04:01,393 --> 00:04:03,634
it's much, much easier to be relaxed

93
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:05,295
and be intentional with what you do.

94
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:09,544
So a lot of my slides have JP Sears memes,

95
00:04:09,664 --> 00:04:12,065
and I know that he makes fun of mindfulness and meditation,

96
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,426
but he's so funny, and I feel like it brings some levity

97
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:15,287
to the presentation.

98
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:18,549
And if you've never seen his spiritual AF videos,

99
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:19,429
they're so funny.

100
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,932
So the easiest way to become present

101
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:27,074
is to notice your own body.

102
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,495
What's really funny is that we spend all day up in our heads,

103
00:04:30,816 --> 00:04:33,337
and we don't notice our bodies until they hurt.

104
00:04:33,657 --> 00:04:34,098
Think about it.

105
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:35,478
You have angles.

106
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:38,179
You have probably not even thought about your ankles

107
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:39,180
unless they're bothering you.

108
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,320
So if you can sort of,

109
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,521
the first thing that mindfulness experts say

110
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:44,602
can get you into the present moment like this

111
00:04:44,902 --> 00:04:46,683
is to just notice your own body.

112
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:48,103
So put your feet on the floor,

113
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:49,844
and this is, what's great about all these tips

114
00:04:49,884 --> 00:04:51,184
is these are sort of designed

115
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:52,645
for you to be able to do at your desk

116
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:53,585
or at work without people.

117
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:56,166
I'm not having you sit on your desk in lotus position

118
00:04:56,206 --> 00:04:57,667
and you know, floating.

119
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,307
You know, I'll meditate and destroy you.

120
00:04:59,608 --> 00:05:01,568
No, it's gonna be much, much more.

121
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:07,868
accessible. So put your feet on the floor, feel your toes, feel your feet, and start

122
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:12,689
to scan upward. Notice your legs, you know, notice your butt in your

123
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:17,191
seat, in the back, in your chair. Notice if you're holding tension anywhere. Like

124
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:21,913
for me, I hold tension like in my chest and behind my shoulders. And scan all the

125
00:05:21,953 --> 00:05:25,094
way up. Do you have any discomfort? Do you need a drink? Do you have a headache? You

126
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:27,234
know, and just notice your body.

127
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:33,607
The next thing to do if you find yourself holding a lot of pressure is to take a breath

128
00:05:33,987 --> 00:05:38,215
and imagine your breath being directed into that spot where you're holding tension.

129
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:41,101
So for me it's right here and I imagine taking that breath.

130
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:45,033
and just sort of making some room around the tension.

131
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:47,955
And you can sort of imagine that tension loosening up

132
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,137
and getting a little bit more open.

133
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:53,258
And that's kind of like the intro level,

134
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,261
easiest sort of meditation, mindfulness trick.

135
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:00,102
The next one does also have to do with breath.

136
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:03,625
And it's funny, we most of the time breathe wrong.

137
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:05,646
And I know that that sounds a little bit ridiculous,

138
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:07,827
but we breathe in a very shallow manner.

139
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:10,929
And a lot of times when you see people take a deep breath,

140
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:11,129
they go.

141
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:15,403
and suck in and that's actually the opposite of what you should be doing

142
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:18,824
because imagine your lungs are like balloons and they inflate and your

143
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:23,485
diaphragm goes down so when you inhale really inhale you want to imagine

144
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:27,347
bringing the breath out and down and really breathing deep and then when you

145
00:06:27,407 --> 00:06:32,448
exhale you should feel it contract and suck in. So another thing that

146
00:06:32,488 --> 00:06:33,548
mindfulness experts say

147
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,445
other than being in your body is being in your breath.

148
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:37,585
Noticing your breath.

149
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:40,327
You don't have to even change your breath to be mindful.

150
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:41,548
Just notice that it's there.

151
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:43,069
Bring your attention to it.

152
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:44,870
Suddenly you're grounded in your body

153
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:45,931
and you're in the present moment.

154
00:06:46,211 --> 00:06:47,993
But what's really awesome about breath work

155
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:49,614
is that it can change your energy.

156
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:51,015
It can bring your energy up

157
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:52,296
and it can bring your energy down.

158
00:06:52,796 --> 00:06:55,998
If you're on hour 16 at the office

159
00:06:56,218 --> 00:06:58,200
and you can't drink another Red Bull,

160
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,641
let me just suggest this.

161
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,942
So if everybody can put their hand on their abdomen

162
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:03,443
so that you can feel it move in and out.

163
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:06,576
You're going to take a three-part breath in.

164
00:07:06,756 --> 00:07:09,838
It's going to be inhale one third, inhale two thirds,

165
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:12,100
inhale all the way, and one exhale.

166
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,900
So everybody with me.

167
00:07:15,242 --> 00:07:15,863
And then exhale.

168
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:17,784
One more time, inhale.

169
00:07:20,046 --> 00:07:20,346
Exhale.

170
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:23,848
And what that does, and it brings this really richly

171
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:27,112
oxygenated blood right to your brain, and it wakes you up.

172
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:29,575
It's almost instantaneous, and it's really, really awesome.

173
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:30,716
If you do this for a few minutes,

174
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:34,400
you could be towards the end of the day on a Friday

175
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,242
during crunch doing pushups on your desk.

176
00:07:36,282 --> 00:07:36,843
It's awesome.

177
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:38,525
That's an exaggeration.

178
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:44,644
What's also cool about this tri-part breath is that it can also be used to chill out and bring your energy down.

179
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:49,826
So say you get a message from your producer and it's just, okay, period.

180
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:51,727
And that period makes you like, oh god.

181
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:54,708
Here's how to use your breath to calm a little bit.

182
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:59,530
So you're going to take a one-part inhale and then a three-part exhale.

183
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:10,941
And when you do that, you can honestly feel those nice, juicy, good serotonin and melatonin

184
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:13,702
and oxytocin, all the good chemicals that make you chill out.

185
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:16,963
You can feel them start to just flow.

186
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:20,244
So taking a couple minutes and doing that kind of breath, and it doesn't have to be

187
00:08:20,304 --> 00:08:21,004
super loud.

188
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:22,525
People don't need to know you're doing it.

189
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:23,945
It doesn't have to be like Lamaze breath.

190
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:29,587
It can just be quiet nose or mouth breathing is perfectly fine for that.

191
00:08:31,556 --> 00:08:34,117
Okay, when you're at the office,

192
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:35,658
it's often hard to be present,

193
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:36,738
because if you're in crunch,

194
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:39,139
things may just blend together.

195
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,180
I mean, how many crunch veterans do we have here?

196
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,481
Like, days blended to weeks, which blend into months.

197
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:46,662
And at this point, like, I'm from New England,

198
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:48,543
like, I'm in Boston, like, it's still snowy.

199
00:08:48,563 --> 00:08:50,263
I don't know what month it is, it's just brutal.

200
00:08:51,654 --> 00:08:54,396
So take in things that you've never noticed before.

201
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:57,098
This helps the neuroplasticity in your brain.

202
00:08:57,318 --> 00:08:59,140
And that means that your brain isn't static,

203
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,002
it can change, and it doesn't get stuck.

204
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:04,084
So if, you know, walking by like,

205
00:09:04,204 --> 00:09:05,425
oh, I never noticed that, you know,

206
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,568
our environment artist, her desk smells like oranges

207
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:11,009
because she eats clementines every day.

208
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:12,991
Or, oh, I never noticed that poster

209
00:09:13,431 --> 00:09:14,912
behind the bathroom door.

210
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,773
You know, just try to take in new details

211
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:19,095
to make it feel fresh, because it's not, right?

212
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,512
Take different routes.

213
00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:22,673
I can't say enough about this.

214
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:25,356
What scientists say really, really, really helps our brain

215
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:26,717
is make things different.

216
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:28,840
If you're stuck in a routine that you can't change

217
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,603
that routine, change little things within the routine.

218
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:33,505
Eat different kinds of breakfasts.

219
00:09:34,772 --> 00:09:36,212
Drive a different way to work.

220
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:38,654
Sit somewhere else if you can.

221
00:09:39,654 --> 00:09:40,715
Hang out with new people.

222
00:09:40,795 --> 00:09:43,476
Make an effort to talk to different people at lunchtime.

223
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:47,358
I personally diffuse a lot of essential oils,

224
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:49,299
and that really changes my mood.

225
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,300
Citrus wakes you up.

226
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,561
Florals help you chill.

227
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:55,522
And woodsy smells help you focus.

228
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:57,763
So that's something that if you want to talk about me later,

229
00:09:57,783 --> 00:09:59,444
you can email me and I can give you specifics.

230
00:09:59,544 --> 00:10:03,446
Or we can talk about it in the overflow room across the hall.

231
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:08,352
whatever you do, try to do whatever you can to keep it fresh.

232
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:14,433
Introductory mindfulness. A lot of people when they say,

233
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:19,094
oh, you meditate? I try it. I can't. I try to explain. It's a practice.

234
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:24,615
As a yoga teacher, the first time I did yoga, I couldn't get on my hands and get into crow.

235
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:28,856
It's because I try a little bit more every time and I balance a little bit more every time.

236
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:33,156
I get a little bit better every time. It's the same with practicing meditation.

237
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,617
I don't expect you to be able to.

238
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:37,142
hold your attention on one thing for 20 minutes.

239
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:39,186
I don't think I've ever done that in my life on anything,

240
00:10:39,227 --> 00:10:40,249
but then again, I have four kids.

241
00:10:41,277 --> 00:10:48,163
The first thing that I really found to be helpful is an exercise, you can either call

242
00:10:48,223 --> 00:10:52,307
it leaves on a stream or like cars on a highway, whichever is more calming to you, I'll take

243
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:52,667
the leaves.

244
00:10:53,728 --> 00:10:58,472
But if you just observe your thoughts, just watch them, you don't even have to clear your

245
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:03,136
mind, you just literally watch your thoughts and if they get stuck, if you get stuck on

246
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:05,358
like one thing and you can't stop thinking about it.

247
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:09,103
pull it out of the stream, redirect to the stream.

248
00:11:09,363 --> 00:11:11,884
So I say, if your thoughts are leaves

249
00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:13,325
on the stream of consciousness,

250
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,585
and they get stuck on a branch,

251
00:11:15,845 --> 00:11:17,426
you pull the branch out, right?

252
00:11:17,826 --> 00:11:19,567
Or if there's cars on the highway,

253
00:11:19,587 --> 00:11:22,368
and you get a little traffic, pull that car over.

254
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:26,009
So literally, all you need to do to start meditating

255
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:31,451
is take a minute, 60 seconds, and watch your thoughts.

256
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:33,971
Observe them, and if they get stuck, pull it out.

257
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:34,292
That's it.

258
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:39,194
And there's a great app called Headspace that sort of has this watch your thoughts

259
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:40,536
ness about it.

260
00:11:40,556 --> 00:11:41,157
And it's really good.

261
00:11:41,197 --> 00:11:44,120
And you can customize the time that you meditate.

262
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,902
And you can add a little bit more every day.

263
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:46,863
Maybe challenge yourself.

264
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:51,168
It takes 21 days to make a habit and 40 days to make a lifelong habit.

265
00:11:51,469 --> 00:11:53,791
So if you want to try just increments of...

266
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:55,963
30 seconds every day.

267
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:57,824
See, just see what works for you.

268
00:11:58,845 --> 00:11:59,746
The silent witness.

269
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:01,748
So there's something about observing your own thoughts

270
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:04,091
and sort of perceiving them as not your own

271
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,233
that's really, really good for your brain.

272
00:12:07,388 --> 00:12:12,150
If you can say that that's my ego, that is my monkey mind, that is my chatter, I am the

273
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,551
silent witness, that's who I really am.

274
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:18,712
And it's kind of a Buddhist thing, it's kind of a yogi thing, but it really, really helps

275
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:19,492
you calm down.

276
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:22,293
It helps you realize that that's just the chatter of your brain.

277
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,214
That's what your brain does.

278
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:26,775
Your brain makes ridiculous scenarios, and that's okay.

279
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:27,615
That's not you.

280
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:31,957
And the silent witness, there's a lot of reading you can do about it, but it really does help

281
00:12:31,997 --> 00:12:35,338
you detach from those little paranoias that everybody has.

282
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:37,283
Correct the puppy.

283
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,144
So I explain teaching mindfulness like this.

284
00:12:40,464 --> 00:12:42,404
So imagine in your mind a cute little puppy.

285
00:12:42,424 --> 00:12:43,424
It can be any kind of puppy.

286
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:45,065
I personally picture a Welsh Corgi.

287
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:48,025
So when you're teaching a puppy how to sit,

288
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:49,906
you put it down, you say sit,

289
00:12:50,346 --> 00:12:51,126
and then it'll look at you

290
00:12:51,226 --> 00:12:52,586
and it'll get up like a second later.

291
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:55,347
You don't go, what an asshole puppy are you?

292
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:57,967
No, you like take the puppy and go, no, no, no, no, honey.

293
00:12:58,207 --> 00:12:59,308
And you redirect the puppy

294
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,288
and it'll sit for another second longer.

295
00:13:01,568 --> 00:13:02,948
And then when it gets up, you just.

296
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:04,235
No, honey, right there.

297
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:06,377
That's how you train your brain

298
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:08,118
with mindfulness and meditation,

299
00:13:08,398 --> 00:13:10,580
in little increments and without judgment.

300
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,841
Just correct the puppy.

301
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:12,822
Like, no, no, no, no, no.

302
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:14,203
Puppy doesn't know how to sit yet.

303
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:15,484
Let me teach it how to sit.

304
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:17,285
Your brain doesn't know how to sit yet.

305
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:18,666
Teach your brain how to sit.

306
00:13:18,987 --> 00:13:19,607
Be like the puppy.

307
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,800
How to relax and still be productive.

308
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,540
So a lot of people think that like,

309
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,781
oh, I can't relax at work, I won't be productive.

310
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:28,101
That's actually not true.

311
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:30,622
When you multitask, you don't do things as well

312
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:32,582
or as thoroughly, and you're going to need

313
00:13:32,802 --> 00:13:34,102
so much more iteration.

314
00:13:35,503 --> 00:13:38,724
And oddly enough, your relaxation can start first thing.

315
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:41,644
They say the first 17 seconds of your day

316
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,925
sets the tone for your entire day.

317
00:13:44,145 --> 00:13:46,546
And I read this really great book called The Slight Edge,

318
00:13:46,846 --> 00:13:48,006
which implies that

319
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:51,808
Every micro decision you make either brings your life

320
00:13:51,868 --> 00:13:53,369
in an upswing or a downswing,

321
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:55,609
and eventually it takes off exponentially.

322
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,190
Things are either gonna get drastically better for you

323
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,291
because these little decisions add up,

324
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:02,131
or things are gonna go downhill to the point

325
00:14:02,151 --> 00:14:03,312
where you're like, oh my God, what's happening?

326
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:05,532
I know how both of those work.

327
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:08,073
So in the first 17 seconds of your day,

328
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,053
if you wake up and go.

329
00:14:10,155 --> 00:14:11,196
I got a deadline.

330
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:14,658
That's probably gonna start you on the downward spiral

331
00:14:14,698 --> 00:14:15,158
of your day.

332
00:14:15,598 --> 00:14:18,380
And what mindfulness experts and scientists have found

333
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,441
in their research is that gratitude is the number one thing

334
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,402
that makes people happy.

335
00:14:22,722 --> 00:14:25,604
So if you can try to wake up and just be thankful

336
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:26,844
for like one or two things.

337
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:29,266
I am so thankful that there was ice cream

338
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,547
in the freezer last night because I totally needed that.

339
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:33,148
Or like, oh, I'm so grateful for my mom

340
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:35,109
for watching the kids later so that I can actually

341
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:35,869
get out of the house.

342
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:40,158
a tiny fraction of your day and be thankful for something

343
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:43,060
and your day will start out on the right foot.

344
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,941
It'll be much better.

345
00:14:45,512 --> 00:14:47,854
So apps, I've already talked about Headspace,

346
00:14:48,094 --> 00:14:51,636
but my favorite meditation app is Ananda, Deepak Chopra's app.

347
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:55,018
There is a small subscription fee, but it's 100% worth it.

348
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:56,418
It's a great, great app.

349
00:14:56,778 --> 00:14:59,960
So Ananda, Deepak Chopra comes on,

350
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,921
and he's got this great, relaxing voice.

351
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:02,462
It's amazing.

352
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:04,863
He talks a little bit about a theme of the day

353
00:15:04,923 --> 00:15:06,804
or something to think about, like, oh, your creativity

354
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:08,705
and where it could bring you, just some nice stuff.

355
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:10,046
And then he gives you a mantra.

356
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,299
And then in a few minutes, because it's customizable however long you want, he rings a bell and

357
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:14,639
it's over.

358
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:15,080
And that's it.

359
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,860
It's very simple.

360
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:21,725
And now a lot of you may be a little bit skeptical about mantras and think that it's too hippy

361
00:15:21,765 --> 00:15:22,025
dippy.

362
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:24,067
Let me tell you, which I love, by the way.

363
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:24,608
I mean, look at me.

364
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:29,850
But let me tell you the science behind why mantras actually work for meditation

365
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:35,512
So imagine that cute little puppy is right next to you, and it's pawing at you, and it wants your attention

366
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:37,812
That's your monkey mind. That's your ego

367
00:15:37,872 --> 00:15:43,654
It always wants to distract you right but imagine you have some treats in your hand and when you drop a treat to the dog

368
00:15:44,015 --> 00:15:50,097
It quiets for just a little bit and you get just a moment to relax, and then it starts at you again

369
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,096
and then you drop another little treat.

370
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:55,477
That is what doing mantra meditation does.

371
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:57,538
The mantra, essentially, it's like throwing,

372
00:15:57,558 --> 00:16:00,520
you know, juggling balls to your monkey mind

373
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,481
and having it juggle while the rest of your brain relaxes.

374
00:16:03,842 --> 00:16:07,563
So I use Sanskrit mantras because I do a lot of yoga

375
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:09,905
and that's the kind that Deepak Chopra does in his app.

376
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:12,786
My favorite mantra is Sohum.

377
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,187
It just means I am.

378
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,788
And it really helps me sort of center myself.

379
00:16:16,848 --> 00:16:17,469
It's really nice.

380
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:19,450
So I inhale so.

381
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:25,031
and exhale hum. Mentally. I'm not even saying it. I can do this at my desk. Again, nobody

382
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:28,734
knows. I used to write for Huffington Post and I wrote this article called, I meditate

383
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:32,996
at the grocery store and nobody even knows. Because I have these kids with me 24-7 and

384
00:16:33,016 --> 00:16:38,900
I just put them in the cart, give them a banana, and I just meditate. It's glorious. Anyway,

385
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,441
those are mantras. They're great.

386
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:42,026
And you should try it.

387
00:16:42,427 --> 00:16:45,588
So how to relax on a chemical or cellular level.

388
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:46,629
This is interesting.

389
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:50,331
So in my research, I found a lot about cortisol.

390
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:52,532
And cortisol is what our adrenals fire

391
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,833
when we are in trouble.

392
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,974
Now, these were originally evolved

393
00:16:57,054 --> 00:16:59,996
for when we encountered a bear.

394
00:17:00,356 --> 00:17:01,596
And the cortisol would fire,

395
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:04,178
and we would either punch the bear in the snoot or run away.

396
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:06,739
Now, that same reaction happens

397
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:09,580
when your lead comes up to you and says,

398
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,721
can we talk at three?

399
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,602
It still fires as though there's a bear.

400
00:17:14,122 --> 00:17:17,205
That's not good for us, especially when we are in crunch

401
00:17:17,545 --> 00:17:19,186
and we are working long hours,

402
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:21,969
our cortisol is firing up like Annie Oakley,

403
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:23,130
just shooting, shooting, shooting.

404
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,211
And that causes adrenal fatigue,

405
00:17:25,231 --> 00:17:27,773
which is really, really, really, it makes you run down.

406
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:29,874
It makes you unhappy, it makes you miserable.

407
00:17:29,894 --> 00:17:30,835
It's really, really difficult.

408
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:32,677
And why cortisol is bad for you

409
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:35,079
is it constricts your blood vessels really tight

410
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,621
because it's trying to get you ready for a fight,

411
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:39,204
but your heart has to be so pumped,

412
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:40,825
so much harder to get the blood through

413
00:17:40,866 --> 00:17:42,527
because your veins are like this.

414
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:43,729
Cortisol is bad.

415
00:17:43,749 --> 00:17:46,472
We want to sort of use it only when we really need it.

416
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,364
Cortisol also tells your body, don't digest that food

417
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:52,507
because you're going to be in a big fight with the bear.

418
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,569
And that's why you often hang on to extra weight

419
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:55,210
when you're stressed.

420
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,814
So a way to fight cortisol is with adaptogens.

421
00:17:59,154 --> 00:18:00,896
And these are just herbs or mushrooms.

422
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,059
You can find them, they're natural supplements

423
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,561
and they give you a little bit of time.

424
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:08,806
between stimulus and response on a chemical level,

425
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:10,969
so that you're not just shooting at every little thing

426
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:11,891
that might make you stress.

427
00:18:11,951 --> 00:18:13,433
Hell, watch the news and watch what happens

428
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:14,094
to your cortisol.

429
00:18:14,114 --> 00:18:15,115
Boom, boom, boom.

430
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:16,898
So I take ashwagandha.

431
00:18:16,938 --> 00:18:17,559
It's my favorite.

432
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,343
I also take cordyceps and reishi mushrooms.

433
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,661
Antioxidants are great for another reason,

434
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:24,943
but I want to make sure that I keep this talk tight

435
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,284
and get to everything that I can.

436
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:30,128
But basically, the space between stimulus and response

437
00:18:30,188 --> 00:18:31,829
is really the key to everything in life.

438
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,312
The ability to be able to have that moment to reason

439
00:18:35,392 --> 00:18:37,034
and realize that you should not panic,

440
00:18:37,294 --> 00:18:39,656
or you should not say something hasty or do something hasty,

441
00:18:39,956 --> 00:18:40,517
it's amazing.

442
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:43,540
And with adaptogens, that happens to your body

443
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,300
on a chemical level.

444
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,083
And with meditation, it happens on a mental level.

445
00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:49,306
It's like adding memory.

446
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:51,068
Your thoughts have more room to run around

447
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:53,931
and you have more time to reason things out.

448
00:18:55,372 --> 00:18:58,015
All right, how to relax on a physical level.

449
00:18:58,115 --> 00:18:58,756
So yoga.

450
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:00,718
I'm not telling everybody out there

451
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:02,660
to get into downward dog with me, okay?

452
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:07,839
There are types of yoga that a lot of people don't know about that are unbelievably helpful

453
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:09,141
for game devs in particular.

454
00:19:10,222 --> 00:19:13,104
Restorative yoga looks like a nap sesh.

455
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:17,088
You get on the floor with a bunch of pillows and blankets and they put you in these weird

456
00:19:17,128 --> 00:19:17,649
positions.

457
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:24,716
But what those positions are designed for is a lymphatic system rinse, a rinse of your

458
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:32,376
sympathetic nervous system, your parasympathetic nervous system, your pineal gland, the poses

459
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:37,659
are meant to sort of stimulate certain responses in your body and to get rid of stress.

460
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,642
So it's not just, I lied down for an hour with a pillow and it was awesome.

461
00:19:41,922 --> 00:19:43,083
It's very strategic.

462
00:19:43,363 --> 00:19:47,485
If you can find a yoga studio that does restorative yoga, it's 90 minutes of like a cuddle sesh

463
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:48,306
that's just amazing.

464
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,067
Yoga Nidra.

465
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:51,808
Everybody write this one down.

466
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:56,746
This helps you get into a sleep state without being asleep,

467
00:19:56,826 --> 00:19:59,228
and you can do this if you can't sleep at night,

468
00:19:59,288 --> 00:20:00,428
if you're coming home from the office

469
00:20:00,468 --> 00:20:02,109
and you want more quality sleep,

470
00:20:02,189 --> 00:20:04,691
but physically can't get it because of time constraints,

471
00:20:05,211 --> 00:20:08,553
or if you need a 20-minute boost and cannot nap at the office.

472
00:20:08,953 --> 00:20:09,634
Yoga Nidra.

473
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:12,916
So let me just explain your brainwaves.

474
00:20:12,936 --> 00:20:15,097
So when you're awake, you have alpha waves and beta waves.

475
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:17,592
And those are, they're great, they help keep you awake,

476
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:19,212
and that's how you think when you're awake.

477
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:22,153
But the problem is they create little toxins in your brain

478
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:25,774
that only sleep, which is, sorry,

479
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:28,014
delta and theta waves can clean away.

480
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:29,795
It's like a janitorial crew comes in at night

481
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:30,915
and cleans those away.

482
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:34,796
And you have 110, 90 minute to 110 sleep cycles at night,

483
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:35,857
and that's what it does.

484
00:20:36,077 --> 00:20:36,917
It cleans everything out.

485
00:20:37,197 --> 00:20:38,357
But if you're not getting enough sleep,

486
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:40,278
you're not getting rid of the toxins.

487
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:44,353
Yoga nidra, it's like a guided meditation.

488
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:48,435
It actually can put your brain into the theta and delta waves

489
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,656
so that you can clear away some of those toxins

490
00:20:50,956 --> 00:20:52,337
without getting a full night's sleep.

491
00:20:52,397 --> 00:20:55,058
A lot of yogis only sleep four hours a night.

492
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:59,381
A lot of the time where my babies were keeping me up

493
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:00,761
at night, I would do some yoga nidra,

494
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:02,923
and it would really help reset my body

495
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:05,484
because I physically couldn't get the amount of sleep

496
00:21:05,524 --> 00:21:06,324
that my body needed.

497
00:21:07,863 --> 00:21:09,564
So I already talked about the depth of sleep.

498
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:11,126
Don't hit snooze.

499
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:12,967
I just found this out like a month ago,

500
00:21:13,027 --> 00:21:14,148
and it was completely shocking.

501
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:19,833
So as I mentioned, you have those 90 to 110 minute

502
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:24,717
sleep cycles, and it takes your body two hours naturally

503
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,038
to rise out of sleep.

504
00:21:27,363 --> 00:21:29,265
and to wake you up properly.

505
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:32,768
When you hit snooze, your body instantly resets

506
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:34,810
to a 90 to 110 minute cycle,

507
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,892
and say you wake up 10 minutes later,

508
00:21:37,252 --> 00:21:39,935
it can take up to four hours for your body

509
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:42,638
to get back to the level of energy

510
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,700
that you would have had if you just woke up

511
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,480
without the snooze.

512
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:47,222
So snooze is super detrimental

513
00:21:47,262 --> 00:21:49,344
to your health and your energy.

514
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,656
Lastly, I'm going to go pretty quickly through this one because I feel like I may not be

515
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:56,278
people's favorite person anymore.

516
00:21:57,339 --> 00:22:02,726
So I love this because JP Sears, if you can't see the picture, he's got a turkey made out

517
00:22:02,786 --> 00:22:05,449
of tofu and like celery and a carrot and it's really funny.

518
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:09,404
Part of the reason why Bill's body and my body was run down

519
00:22:09,444 --> 00:22:10,945
is because we were eating horrible things.

520
00:22:10,985 --> 00:22:12,466
Because in crunch, a lot of the time,

521
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:14,488
you just eat whatever's available.

522
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:16,811
A lot of times studios will just bring in a bunch of food

523
00:22:16,831 --> 00:22:18,753
and you just eat what's there and it's really, really easy.

524
00:22:19,053 --> 00:22:20,574
And Bill and I had so much aches and pains.

525
00:22:20,614 --> 00:22:22,016
I actually had chronic back pain.

526
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:23,998
I was at a chiropractor three times a week.

527
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,540
And what I ended up, you know,

528
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,102
after a number of doctor's visits.

529
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:31,231
I realized that my body was just inflamed

530
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,132
by all of the things that I was consuming.

531
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:36,855
Now, this is not me saying you need to cut these things

532
00:22:36,915 --> 00:22:39,297
to be happy, I'm saying if you can reduce

533
00:22:39,578 --> 00:22:41,159
or even eliminate some of these things,

534
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:43,201
your body's gonna be more cooperative.

535
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:47,364
When you're in crunch, you are go, go, go, go, go,

536
00:22:47,404 --> 00:22:48,745
and you need your body to keep you up.

537
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:51,287
You need your body to be able to sleep when you want,

538
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:53,910
to be able to bike to work when you want,

539
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,571
which is obviously great because it helps.

540
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,671
get you a little exercise.

541
00:22:56,691 --> 00:22:58,231
Your body needs to keep up with your mind.

542
00:22:58,531 --> 00:23:00,451
And so these are the things that cause inflammation

543
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:01,872
in your body and your diet, and I'm sorry.

544
00:23:01,892 --> 00:23:08,413
Yeah, so meat, dairy, sugar, caffeine, and alcohol.

545
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,514
So I actually became vegan

546
00:23:10,574 --> 00:23:12,915
and it completely changed my health entirely.

547
00:23:13,355 --> 00:23:15,035
It's not as expensive as people say

548
00:23:15,075 --> 00:23:18,576
if you use a lot of things like beans and lentils and rice.

549
00:23:19,824 --> 00:23:21,666
And it's actually remarkably delicious

550
00:23:21,806 --> 00:23:23,187
if you find the right cookbooks and whatnot.

551
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:24,888
I'm happy, happy, happy to talk to anybody

552
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,689
who's considering it.

553
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:29,412
We can talk across the hall, or you can just email me

554
00:23:29,432 --> 00:23:30,613
because I'm really passionate about it.

555
00:23:30,673 --> 00:23:32,054
And yes, there is good vegan cheese,

556
00:23:32,094 --> 00:23:33,995
but most of it is terrible.

557
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,858
So, pocket meditations.

558
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:41,442
So here I'm going to give you a couple of really short

559
00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:45,687
meditations that you can just try to remember and do on the

560
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:49,671
go. These are not things that you need to be in a quiet

561
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:50,252
place for.

562
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:52,694
These are things that you can sort of just visualize

563
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:53,295
anywhere.

564
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:59,661
Okay, so I think I'm going to start with sensory meditation is great because you can actually

565
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:02,443
do it while you're eating and it makes eating more enjoyable.

566
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:09,207
So the way my yoga teacher taught this to us, she gave everybody a small piece of gourmet

567
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:09,968
dark chocolate.

568
00:24:10,568 --> 00:24:11,048
It was vegan.

569
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:12,409
And it was really good.

570
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:14,270
So she had us look at it.

571
00:24:15,011 --> 00:24:15,471
She had us.

572
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:17,706
open the paper and listen to the crinkles.

573
00:24:17,966 --> 00:24:19,428
She had us smell the chocolate.

574
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:20,969
She had us use all of our senses.

575
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:22,090
And then by the time we were eating it,

576
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,131
we were like, oh my God,

577
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:24,373
this is the best thing I've ever eaten.

578
00:24:24,693 --> 00:24:26,194
But if you can do things

579
00:24:26,535 --> 00:24:28,297
and try to incorporate all your senses,

580
00:24:28,557 --> 00:24:29,978
that is a form of meditation.

581
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:32,841
And it's actually really great for your mind

582
00:24:32,941 --> 00:24:34,323
to engage in all your senses.

583
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:36,124
So go get some chocolate after, right?

584
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:37,426
Even though I just told you don't eat sugar.

585
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,362
So the guided meditations.

586
00:24:43,722 --> 00:24:45,663
Go on YouTube, type in guided meditations.

587
00:24:45,923 --> 00:24:49,325
There are so many amazing visual guided meditations

588
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:51,426
and these are nice if you can close your eyes,

589
00:24:51,747 --> 00:24:53,227
but it's just somebody walking you

590
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:54,268
through something mentally,

591
00:24:54,608 --> 00:24:56,970
and it's just sort of like a really peaceful little story

592
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,991
that can totally help you calm down, deescalate,

593
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:03,193
pop in your earbuds and just take five minutes

594
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:06,035
and listen to a really beautiful guided visualization.

595
00:25:07,431 --> 00:25:08,411
The golden bucket.

596
00:25:08,551 --> 00:25:11,052
So this one is really nice when you've got something

597
00:25:11,072 --> 00:25:12,152
that's troubling you.

598
00:25:12,672 --> 00:25:14,392
So I think we're gonna do it right now

599
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:15,552
because we have a little bit of time.

600
00:25:15,592 --> 00:25:18,173
So everybody, if you'd like to, close your eyes

601
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,673
and I'll lead you through it a little bit.

602
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:24,174
So imagine you're at your favorite place on Earth.

603
00:25:24,754 --> 00:25:27,874
Say it's the camp you used to go to as a child

604
00:25:27,954 --> 00:25:31,595
or a bench in your backyard or at your favorite beach.

605
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:35,016
And there's a golden bucket next to you

606
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:36,796
and it's illuminated from the bottom.

607
00:25:37,547 --> 00:25:40,428
And you have this instinct to put all your worries in there.

608
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:44,331
So imagine that your worries are heavy, heavy chains

609
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:45,812
inside your chest or your mind,

610
00:25:46,092 --> 00:25:47,473
and you start to just pull them out

611
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:48,553
and drop them into the bucket.

612
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:51,115
So, you know, your cat's been a little sick.

613
00:25:51,195 --> 00:25:52,376
Put that worry in the bucket.

614
00:25:53,196 --> 00:25:56,298
You have a really, really, really big milestone coming up.

615
00:25:56,378 --> 00:25:57,279
Drop it in the bucket.

616
00:25:57,739 --> 00:26:00,301
You have had a strained relationship with your mother.

617
00:26:00,361 --> 00:26:01,782
Take it out, put it in the bucket.

618
00:26:02,262 --> 00:26:05,324
And just slowly, one by one, imagine giving away.

619
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,619
all of the things that are burdening you.

620
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,281
And start to imagine your body to just feel physically lighter.

621
00:26:14,102 --> 00:26:16,683
And after a moment, you feel a hand on your shoulder,

622
00:26:17,223 --> 00:26:19,244
and a stranger says, I'll take this now.

623
00:26:19,724 --> 00:26:22,105
And somebody just picks up the bucket and walks away with it.

624
00:26:23,046 --> 00:26:23,546
Open your eyes.

625
00:26:24,186 --> 00:26:25,567
It's the kind of thing that just helps

626
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:27,468
make you feel a little bit lighter when

627
00:26:27,488 --> 00:26:28,408
things are weighing you down.

628
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:33,976
Another really great visualization when you have a little bit of a toxic workplace is

629
00:26:34,016 --> 00:26:35,816
the breathe in gold meditation.

630
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:39,937
So a lot of times when you're crunched, things can get contentious.

631
00:26:40,237 --> 00:26:44,198
And people who you really loved before crunch may not be your favorite people during crunch

632
00:26:44,218 --> 00:26:47,659
because you see them 24-7 and they are really, really getting on your nerves.

633
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,139
And also gossip is a thing.

634
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:54,540
The number one thing I say is be the light, be the person in the office who doesn't gossip

635
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,160
because

636
00:26:55,653 --> 00:26:57,394
then people, it'll have a ripple effect.

637
00:26:57,594 --> 00:26:59,294
And I just read this book, Judgment Detox,

638
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:00,694
and it's really, really helpful for that.

639
00:27:01,115 --> 00:27:02,955
But this is nice if you have a work environment

640
00:27:02,975 --> 00:27:03,875
that's slightly unpleasant.

641
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:05,795
It's a really great guided visualization.

642
00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:09,616
So you imagine that you're breathing in this gold liquid

643
00:27:09,676 --> 00:27:10,676
and filling your lungs with it,

644
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:13,437
and when you exhale, it's diffusing through the room

645
00:27:13,537 --> 00:27:14,817
and calming everybody down.

646
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:17,218
Even if it's not affecting other people,

647
00:27:17,478 --> 00:27:19,318
if you can imagine them being calmer

648
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,918
and imagine yourself being calmer,

649
00:27:21,218 --> 00:27:23,979
it's actually a really, really nice exercise.

650
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,002
The rainbow elevator is fun, and I think I do have time to do it.

651
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:29,402
Very cool.

652
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:33,925
So there's sort of a guided meditation

653
00:27:33,965 --> 00:27:37,706
that goes through all the colors, and it goes up your spine.

654
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,628
And I actually think that we probably don't have time,

655
00:27:41,648 --> 00:27:46,271
but I do have time for one or two questions, if anybody has them.

656
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,492
I should probably go to this page.

657
00:27:49,452 --> 00:27:50,133
Recommended.

658
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:52,174
reading or listening.

659
00:27:53,054 --> 00:27:56,096
These are books, so I found that it really helped me

660
00:27:56,436 --> 00:27:57,896
to listen to audio books,

661
00:27:57,956 --> 00:28:00,197
because then it was sort of spare time

662
00:28:00,237 --> 00:28:01,658
that was wasted in my day.

663
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:03,759
So these are really, really, really good.

664
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:06,040
The Power of Now is literally

665
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,440
about present moment awareness.

666
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:09,321
The Universe Has Your Back,

667
00:28:09,441 --> 00:28:11,602
it's a little bit on the woo-woo side,

668
00:28:11,642 --> 00:28:13,903
but it really, really, really just makes you happy.

669
00:28:13,963 --> 00:28:14,483
It's wonderful.

670
00:28:14,924 --> 00:28:15,984
The Four Agreements.

671
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:20,197
I love the advice Don Miguel Ruiz gives in this.

672
00:28:20,717 --> 00:28:22,858
One of the agreements is don't take anything personally

673
00:28:22,878 --> 00:28:24,359
because it's not about you, chances are.

674
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:27,341
And also, yeah, that's kind of the big one.

675
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:30,082
The slight edge was the one where your life goes up or down.

676
00:28:30,862 --> 00:28:34,884
The desire map is amazing because she sort of talks to you

677
00:28:34,904 --> 00:28:36,785
about reverse engineering your goals.

678
00:28:37,045 --> 00:28:38,566
Like, oh, I want to have five ship titles

679
00:28:38,606 --> 00:28:39,627
by the time I'm 35.

680
00:28:39,687 --> 00:28:40,747
Well, okay, why?

681
00:28:41,271 --> 00:28:42,631
because it'll make me feel accomplished.

682
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,512
Well, what else can you do to feel accomplished?

683
00:28:44,532 --> 00:28:46,853
And you sort of go backwards, Desire Map,

684
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:47,673
really, really good book.

685
00:28:48,434 --> 00:28:50,414
How Not to Die, this is about diet.

686
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:52,335
Fascinating.

687
00:28:52,995 --> 00:28:54,796
The Five Second Rule by Mel Robbins

688
00:28:54,856 --> 00:28:56,236
talks about how you can talk yourself

689
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,457
into doing anything by counting backwards from five.

690
00:28:58,797 --> 00:29:00,858
It's fascinating, and she's a Boston girl like me.

691
00:29:01,178 --> 00:29:01,458
Love it.

692
00:29:01,718 --> 00:29:04,760
And The Way of the Seal is sort of like a cool zen book

693
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,240
by a guy who was a Navy SEAL,

694
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,361
and it's about mental toughness, and it's awesome.

695
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,350
So one minute left.

696
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,531
Do we have a question?

697
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:12,151
Anyone?

698
00:29:12,171 --> 00:29:14,352
Hi.

699
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:18,894
Hi.

700
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:19,414
Hi.

701
00:29:20,534 --> 00:29:23,075
When I get back from GDC, I'm going

702
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,796
to be doing more waking up and working out on time.

703
00:29:25,836 --> 00:29:29,558
But I kind of had an idea of having one day to sleep in.

704
00:29:29,638 --> 00:29:30,998
Do you think this is conducive?

705
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:33,259
Or do you think maybe I should just still get up and maybe

706
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:34,220
be lazy but awake?

707
00:29:35,142 --> 00:29:38,324
So I think those are good things for you in different ways.

708
00:29:38,384 --> 00:29:40,305
You need the sleep and you also need the exercise.

709
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,327
So I mean, whatever serves your body,

710
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,228
try it the way you set up for a week,

711
00:29:44,448 --> 00:29:46,229
but if you feel like your body's run down,

712
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:48,030
maybe one more day of the sleep.

713
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:52,253
Just pay attention to what your body's telling you.

714
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,654
We are remarkably intuitive,

715
00:29:55,074 --> 00:29:56,335
but we don't pay attention to it enough.

716
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,056
So yeah, listen to your body, definitely.

717
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:58,737
Okay, thank you.

718
00:29:58,757 --> 00:29:59,097
Anymore?

719
00:29:59,117 --> 00:30:00,318
I think we got time for like one.

720
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:01,799
No?

721
00:30:02,872 --> 00:30:04,213
Please, please, please stay in touch

722
00:30:04,233 --> 00:30:05,793
because I love talking about this stuff.

723
00:30:06,093 --> 00:30:06,853
I'm on Twitter.

724
00:30:07,774 --> 00:30:08,854
You can email me.

725
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:10,234
There's the timer.

726
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,835
And I'll be probably across the way

727
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:14,376
in the little overlook, totally.

728
00:30:14,636 --> 00:30:16,196
Is it the overlook like the hotel, really?

729
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,957
Or overwatch or whatever it is, across the way.

730
00:30:18,977 --> 00:30:20,198
Either way, it's cool.

731
00:30:20,738 --> 00:30:22,318
If anybody has questions or wanna chat,

732
00:30:22,598 --> 00:30:23,659
please, please, please stay in touch.

733
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:24,859
I don't even care if you email me

734
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:26,439
about vegan cheese or essential oils.

735
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,920
It's all good, okay?

736
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Please fill out your surveys.

737
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,641
I hope you guys took something away from this.

738
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,100
Enjoy the rest of your GDC and your trip home.

739
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:34,146
Thank you.
