1
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:05,760
We good to go?

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,102
All right, guys.

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:08,923
Hi, everybody.

4
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:11,165
Hi.

5
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:14,287
So my name is Shadi Safadi.

6
00:00:15,468 --> 00:00:18,111
I'm founder of OnePixel Brush, which is a concept studio.

7
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,213
We just do concept art, high-end concept art,

8
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:22,514
I think some of the best concept artists that we have.

9
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:26,338
And these guys on our team are from all over the world.

10
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:30,257
They all work remotely, and they all do just amazing, outstanding work.

11
00:00:30,437 --> 00:00:33,758
And this has been an experiment the last couple years.

12
00:00:34,398 --> 00:00:37,820
I left Naughty Dog, one of the greatest game studios that exists,

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,341
to start my own company and kind of learn the ropes of managing people.

14
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:44,762
And since I'm a concept artist, too, and I'm kind of on both ends,

15
00:00:45,823 --> 00:00:46,483
I'm in the middle now.

16
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:49,464
I train people, but I also have art directors above me.

17
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:50,965
So I'm going to talk a little bit about...

18
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:52,646
What it's like being an art director,

19
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:54,628
kind of when you know both jobs

20
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:55,828
and you're getting used to one,

21
00:00:55,868 --> 00:00:56,829
but you already know the other.

22
00:00:57,549 --> 00:00:59,731
So, some of what I'm gonna talk about is just like

23
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:02,653
the personal hearts and minds stuff of being an artist,

24
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,275
because that's not really talked about too much.

25
00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:06,796
It's a big factor, I think.

26
00:01:08,757 --> 00:01:10,358
Quickly though, before I start,

27
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,360
who here, raise your hand if you are an art director?

28
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:15,782
Okay.

29
00:01:16,302 --> 00:01:17,883
Raise your hand if you're an artist.

30
00:01:19,224 --> 00:01:20,085
3D, okay.

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,060
Raise your hand if you're a concept artist.

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,281
Or aspiring concept artist.

33
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:25,781
Cool.

34
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:27,682
Alright, cool. You can aspire.

35
00:01:27,702 --> 00:01:30,622
I'm only asking because I'm gonna...

36
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:33,243
This is... I'm gonna come at everything from a concept perspective.

37
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,123
And I'm also gonna come at everything from a...

38
00:01:35,584 --> 00:01:37,444
Sort of brass tacks perspective.

39
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:38,364
Because I don't...

40
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:42,285
Everything I do was dependent on this company even running.

41
00:01:42,345 --> 00:01:44,386
If any of this stuff didn't work, I wouldn't have a company.

42
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:45,406
You know what I mean?

43
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:47,407
And some of our clients are...

44
00:01:48,747 --> 00:01:51,387
the biggest game studios in the world and it surprises me

45
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:54,908
that infinity word calls and is like hey can you guys do all our concepts for a

46
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,248
new you know new IP

47
00:01:56,828 --> 00:02:01,009
I'm like well damn we must be pretty good because the infinity word called us

48
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:03,750
but uh... you know we're always struggling to get better every day and

49
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,510
I'm gonna kind of do more of a free form thing I'm not gonna go through slides

50
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,171
one at a time I'm just gonna kind of have conversation and pull up

51
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:11,711
images to discuss

52
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:13,351
and I'll stop probably like

53
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:17,352
ten fifteen minutes before the end so you guys can ask questions and we can get into some stuff

54
00:02:19,294 --> 00:02:24,982
Okay, here's the first thing I want to talk about, and I've talked about this on a Gumroad

55
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:30,230
tutorial series, and this is what I like to call, let's see here, I'm going to use Photoshop

56
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,516
too, this is what I like to call the law of increasing awesomeness.

57
00:02:36,477 --> 00:02:41,499
And this has been a really important thing, I think, in watching talent grow.

58
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:46,180
Because if this wasn't possible, again, this company would not be possible.

59
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,000
Because I couldn't take people who were young and who had a lot of

60
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:54,942
skill that you can kind of see and make them pro-concept artists if there weren't roads.

61
00:02:55,242 --> 00:03:00,443
And basically what it says is, you can kind of wander up this road, right?

62
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:03,083
This was a dig at Art Institute, sorry guys.

63
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:06,485
I went to Art Center, so we got to bang them.

64
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:09,968
So, no matter where you're starting,

65
00:03:09,988 --> 00:03:12,550
you're kind of moving up this mountain, right?

66
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,791
In your artistic growth, in your career.

67
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:17,973
And there are so many roads to go up.

68
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:20,535
You know, there's so many ways to get up here

69
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:22,877
to what we would call, you know, Art God.

70
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,098
Now, an Art God is an...

71
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,700
I have some personal Art Gods, I'm sure you guys do too,

72
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,661
and they're not necessarily better.

73
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:33,262
uh... best artist in the world but they are to you you know you don't know

74
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:34,843
anyone better let's say so whoever those

75
00:03:35,143 --> 00:03:37,044
people that we can't even imagine someone better

76
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:40,165
and and later i'll talk about finding the right art gods to because

77
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:42,186
again this art god could be here

78
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:44,667
the kind of art god that works on avatar

79
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:47,628
and the kind of art god that works on world of warcraft is a completely

80
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:48,068
different one

81
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:49,869
you know what i mean

82
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:51,449
everything i'm telling you

83
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,550
is biased

84
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:57,241
and determined by my personal taste.

85
00:03:57,902 --> 00:03:59,862
And that's something that we don't really talk about too much, right?

86
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:01,603
Because we say these are some truisms of art.

87
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:03,403
And we all kind of say the same truisms,

88
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:07,024
but mine are all gearing towards what my own personal taste is.

89
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:08,804
And I get to, right?

90
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:10,305
And you get to. Everyone gets to.

91
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:12,605
That's your career path. You should follow your taste.

92
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:16,926
Um, and, uh, oh, I'm sweetly tethering Wi-Fi off my phone.

93
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:17,587
I'm so excited.

94
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:19,007
Okay, so I have some Internet.

95
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:22,208
Um, so this is the style of stuff that I push my guys to do,

96
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:22,928
because I like it.

97
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:24,508
It's grounded.

98
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:28,085
It's realistic, and it's grounded.

99
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:29,326
And it's realistic.

100
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:31,970
And it's grounded, and it's realistic.

101
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:34,413
I like grounded and realistic.

102
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:37,897
So Oblivion, not Pacific Rim.

103
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:39,199
You know what I'm saying?

104
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:42,644
although I enjoyed Pacific Rim more than I enjoyed Oblivion.

105
00:04:42,664 --> 00:04:43,284
Do you know what I'm saying?

106
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:44,765
Like I thought it was a more fun movie.

107
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:45,486
I liked it better.

108
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:49,829
But that super classy, like Oblivion, you're like,

109
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,491
how is everything so slick?

110
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:52,431
I can't even believe it.

111
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:54,193
That's what I personally like.

112
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,635
So that's what I tell every one of my guys to do.

113
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:58,416
And that's what I hire people who have,

114
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:00,017
who I feel like have that aesthetic.

115
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:01,939
So you should know everything I'm saying

116
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:02,739
is filtered through,

117
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,721
do you want your work to look like this?

118
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:07,329
And if you don't, you want it to look like something else,

119
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,250
then maybe some of this applies, but not all of it.

120
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,850
You know what I'm saying?

121
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,231
Because everything I'm going to say, I'm going to say dogmatically,

122
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,091
as if that's the truth.

123
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:14,191
It is the truth for this.

124
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:15,851
But it's not the truth for every style.

125
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:18,712
It's the truth for what I like.

126
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:22,473
So, that's just a rough idea of kind of like,

127
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:25,073
what we, how we put stuff together.

128
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:26,574
Now, back to this thing.

129
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,635
The reason this is important is because...

130
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,756
I have seen people, I personally know people, who have graduated school with a portfolio

131
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:39,260
that just looks like a normal graduation from college art school portfolio.

132
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:41,523
It's just, it's just dog shit, you know, it's okay.

133
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,115
And it's not that bad.

134
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,816
It's not that bad, but you're talking about

135
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,676
the people who do concept art professionally

136
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:48,757
for the top companies in the world.

137
00:05:49,197 --> 00:05:51,918
It's only like, I don't know, 200 people, right?

138
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,538
I mean, how many people are at that high level?

139
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:55,079
The names that you know, how many concept artists

140
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:56,419
can you name that are amazing?

141
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,519
There's only like a handful.

142
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,620
So all those guys didn't get there

143
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,841
just through drawing mileage.

144
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,861
You know, they didn't just do figure drawings.

145
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:04,702
Some of them did, like Wes Burt, that guy.

146
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:06,142
How many of you guys know Wes Burt?

147
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:12,457
Amazing. I mean, OK, so there are those anomalies, those people that have been doing this every day.

148
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:15,258
And if you want to be that guy, just go for it.

149
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:16,779
Like, I'm going to cheer you on all the way.

150
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,900
But what I'm going to try to tell you about is there's a shortcut.

151
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,261
Because here's the road I went up. Well, not me, Maché.

152
00:06:25,621 --> 00:06:26,942
You guys know who Maché Cusciere is?

153
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:32,163
I always bring him up every talk I have because he's one of the best.

154
00:06:32,823 --> 00:06:34,124
Let's see if he pulls up on here.

155
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:37,005
Oh, you know what? I made folders.

156
00:06:37,705 --> 00:06:47,667
because I planned. The best. All right. Here's, here's some of

157
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:57,169
Miche's stuff. And you're like, shut up, dude. And then he did

158
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:02,291
this, too. What are you even talking about? Just shut your

159
00:07:02,311 --> 00:07:02,831
mouth. What?

160
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,882
comic book style and you can just also do awesome illustration

161
00:07:07,582 --> 00:07:09,963
and it's like super beautiful and like

162
00:07:10,484 --> 00:07:13,885
beautifully painted and photos but you can't quite tell where the photos were

163
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:14,225
used

164
00:07:14,665 --> 00:07:17,407
and some photo in the background and some overpainting

165
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:21,229
it's all about the subtleties with him. He like knows how to hide his tracks

166
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:26,651
like a mofo. I'm keeping it clean even though you put a profanity in the

167
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:27,632
description of this talk

168
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:28,992
which offended me.

169
00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:31,086
even though I wrote it and sent it to you.

170
00:07:32,307 --> 00:07:35,368
This, you know, it's like he's really good at,

171
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,028
in my opinion, he's one of the best.

172
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:38,489
And he can do really grounded stuff too.

173
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,470
So when he started at Naughty Dog,

174
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,111
we were all kind of like following him.

175
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:45,871
And he was like up here.

176
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:48,512
And we would all, we were all like right here.

177
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:49,933
We're like, oh, there's Mache, let's go.

178
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:52,714
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

179
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:54,074
But we had no will of our own.

180
00:07:54,094 --> 00:07:55,275
We had no mind of our own.

181
00:07:55,735 --> 00:07:57,055
Because I don't give a shit.

182
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:58,856
He's up there, we're down here, let's go.

183
00:07:59,952 --> 00:08:00,253
Okay?

184
00:08:00,793 --> 00:08:04,656
And if you have that attitude, you get better so much faster because what I see a lot of

185
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:08,660
artists doing is they graduate and they have a lot of, they have their own way of doing

186
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,541
things, right?

187
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:12,063
And they feel like art is an exploration, right?

188
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:14,333
And art can be an exploration.

189
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:19,055
You can just kind of go, uh, uh, uh, and stop here,

190
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:20,636
and there's an avalanche, and you fall down,

191
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:21,816
and then you start climbing again.

192
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:23,237
If you don't know where you're going,

193
00:08:23,257 --> 00:08:24,758
you can just explore for your whole life,

194
00:08:24,798 --> 00:08:26,739
for your whole career, and no one will fault you for it.

195
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,440
And if you're Wes Burt, for example,

196
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,680
that guy's been drawing, he just went,

197
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,401
yeah, and I'm getting up here.

198
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:32,582
Screw you guys.

199
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,183
He didn't need any shortcuts, and I admire that.

200
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,944
That's if you have the time.

201
00:08:37,324 --> 00:08:40,025
But the thing I want to just point out

202
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:41,906
is that we're gonna die, all of us, really soon.

203
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:46,410
So you don't have forever. You have like a limited amount of time.

204
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,513
And if you want to be a superstar, then just might as well go up the way this other guy's going.

205
00:08:50,793 --> 00:08:54,536
The hard part about it is, it's gonna mean giving up some stuff that you might hold dear,

206
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:56,117
and things you might truly love about art.

207
00:08:56,517 --> 00:09:00,641
And I honestly have to say, some of the stuff that has changed in concept art is so hard to swallow

208
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:03,223
that it makes art... it can make art not fun anymore.

209
00:09:03,783 --> 00:09:05,043
Because maybe you like drawing, you know?

210
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:10,224
And not drawing just makes it so like, I don't want to build 3D or use models that I found.

211
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:11,224
You know, that's gross to me.

212
00:09:11,665 --> 00:09:12,705
Yeah, it's tough sometimes.

213
00:09:12,805 --> 00:09:17,006
But we watch Mache, and he would go up here, and we'd be like, oh, there's Mache.

214
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:17,506
Cool.

215
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:20,066
And now, since I started a company, I stopped.

216
00:09:20,446 --> 00:09:22,567
I'm not very good at art anymore, because I haven't done it in like two years.

217
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:23,407
All right?

218
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:25,247
So I've made a camp right here, base camp.

219
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:29,968
And I tell people very clearly how to come up this way, because I know that way.

220
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:32,229
And then I tell them, Mache went that way.

221
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:32,289
Go.

222
00:09:33,588 --> 00:09:37,830
And I can look at them from binoculars, but my team is going to get better than me.

223
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,051
There's no way around it.

224
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:43,093
They're going to get better than me, and in two more years, if I don't keep doing art,

225
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,974
eventually they're going to be like, I'm going to say some art direction stuff,

226
00:09:46,014 --> 00:09:48,975
and my best guys are going to be like, all right, dude, like, all right, whatever.

227
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:51,016
You're in charge, I guess, but I have to listen to you.

228
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:51,536
Right?

229
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:54,578
And all of you know art directors like that, because that's what happened.

230
00:09:54,638 --> 00:09:55,098
I can tell.

231
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:56,219
I can see it happening to me.

232
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,540
You can't be Kobe and Phil Jackson.

233
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:04,329
it's impossible. You have to stop playing in order to coach. So this is what I decided

234
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:10,092
to do because I enjoy it. Now, our team is about 10 guys from all over the world and

235
00:10:10,452 --> 00:10:15,375
it's worked. I've seen it work. I've seen guys go from like terrible to amazing. So

236
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:20,558
let me give you an example of someone, not one of my team, but a guy named John Sweeney.

237
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:27,862
He works at Naughty Dog, all right? And he gave me this idea to have folders on our computer

238
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:34,046
are called great artistry. Right? In our Dropbox. So, in great artistry, we have the best work

239
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:37,987
that any person has done, like a wall of fame. And then we have another folder called great

240
00:10:38,127 --> 00:10:43,228
shardistry. You know what sharding is? Because that's what this work looks like. And it's

241
00:10:43,348 --> 00:10:49,330
all of our work that was the worst, just most abysmal stuff. Okay? Now, I'm going to show

242
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,130
you some of John's barely just graduated. And I called him right before to ask him permission

243
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,431
to do this. Some of his just graduating work. And some of you might look at this and be

244
00:10:56,451 --> 00:10:58,572
like, that's not that bad. You're an asshole. Well, it is so

245
00:11:00,154 --> 00:11:07,877
Okay, so it was this kind of thing, and this kind of thing, which is like rendered, not photo reference, like hand-painted.

246
00:11:08,457 --> 00:11:12,599
Like I said, there's a huge market for that, there's a lot of people that do that, there's a lot of games that do that.

247
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:15,960
You saw what my taste is, right? So that's why I don't want this.

248
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:22,463
But he wanted to work at Naughty Dog, okay? And he was doing stuff, you know, graduating school,

249
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:25,844
that looked like that, or like this, you know?

250
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:29,345
Like, it's aight, it's aight, but it's kinda gross.

251
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,491
It's like, hard to look at.

252
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:33,633
Because he's not using photo reference.

253
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:36,515
He's not loving what's there in plumes of smoke.

254
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:41,920
Like if you were to Google, like, you know, terrible tragedies are great for video game

255
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,443
reference, but if you Google any wars and you go online, you'll find amazing photos

256
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:50,126
of like war-torn areas with people running and what the smoke really looks like and the

257
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:52,468
subtleties of the smoke and the layers and little bits of smoke.

258
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:53,869
That's what's beautiful.

259
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,410
But that's like another level.

260
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:58,353
In three months, I watched him go from that.

261
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:04,772
to someone who, this was his art test.

262
00:12:07,753 --> 00:12:08,733
Probably three to four months.

263
00:12:09,273 --> 00:12:11,554
And the way he did it was he listened to everything

264
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:14,775
that Eitan, another artist there, and me had told him.

265
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:16,475
And he sent us work for constant feedback.

266
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:18,416
And when we told him what to do, he didn't argue.

267
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:19,396
He just did it.

268
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,756
He's like, oh, really, that's the way you do it?

269
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:21,697
Okay, I'm starting over.

270
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:25,338
Now this took him a few weeks, actually.

271
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:26,618
Like, so much time.

272
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:27,538
Because there's a lot of people

273
00:12:27,558 --> 00:12:29,119
that take the Naughty Dog Art Test and fail it.

274
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,232
And then, you know, like more recently he did this one.

275
00:12:33,392 --> 00:12:34,372
This is one of his more recent.

276
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:35,633
He's gotten even better.

277
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:38,255
This is one of his more recent paintings.

278
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:45,721
And he really likes, his personal thing is that Rainbow Six sort of...

279
00:12:47,864 --> 00:12:50,446
Just badass espionage style. That's kind of his thing.

280
00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:54,249
But he went on to get a job there because he changed up his whole style.

281
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:56,190
He started using photo reference in different ways.

282
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,992
He started, and this is probably partly from screen grabs,

283
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:02,094
he just, he added so many things to his technique.

284
00:13:02,995 --> 00:13:04,876
And he leveled up a million-fold.

285
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:08,819
Another thing is I wanted to show is examples off of our site.

286
00:13:10,561 --> 00:13:15,645
And it might be for some of you hard to see the difference. You might be like, well, I don't really see how that one is better than this one or whatnot.

287
00:13:16,306 --> 00:13:20,890
This is how this is one of my concepts. This is not how I would concept nowadays, but this is all hand painted.

288
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:32,119
Right, the plane is hand painted. The there's no photo reference used. I probably had photos to look at right to draw from, but I didn't actually have any photos in there and the reason.

289
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,822
This doesn't work is because now with.

290
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:41,316
A couple different things, the way you use photos and blend them, the way you use textures

291
00:13:41,376 --> 00:13:44,979
and blend them so that nothing looks too photo-y but everything doesn't look hand-painted at

292
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:47,502
the same time, it looks so much more slick and pro.

293
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:48,763
Same with characters.

294
00:13:49,564 --> 00:13:53,368
This is one of our guys that did characters that I couldn't use, right?

295
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:55,951
Because he's doing a dude, like why are you pan-painting a dude?

296
00:13:56,271 --> 00:14:00,395
Instead, he started finding a picture of a posed dude and like working it into the design.

297
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:04,909
Now, some of you might be like, well, some of the artistry goes away when you do that,

298
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:06,211
when you find the photo, right?

299
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,414
But what is concept art about?

300
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:10,417
What's that?

301
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:12,120
Idea, right?

302
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,021
It's about good idea.

303
00:14:13,282 --> 00:14:15,105
But we're artists, so we like the art of it, too.

304
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:16,887
But that doesn't mean the good idea...

305
00:14:17,675 --> 00:14:19,877
You might miss out on a few things in the painting department,

306
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:21,759
but you get to express so much more.

307
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,342
Like, you would have never drawn this, you know?

308
00:14:24,802 --> 00:14:26,184
You wouldn't have sketched this out.

309
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:27,505
This had to be found.

310
00:14:28,046 --> 00:14:28,987
You couldn't have come up with it.

311
00:14:29,307 --> 00:14:32,510
And if you had an idea for a flashlight that had holograms that you could push,

312
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,251
that's a cool idea.

313
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:35,313
If you had to draw it out, you probably wouldn't...

314
00:14:35,393 --> 00:14:38,076
It'd take you a long time to realize that this probably took four hours.

315
00:14:41,285 --> 00:14:44,806
And the main reason is, where the profanity was in the description of this talk,

316
00:14:45,126 --> 00:14:48,687
it's about the freaking modelers and the 3D artists.

317
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:50,907
Because you're not doing it for you, you're doing it for someone else.

318
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:55,129
So I'm surprised, honestly, how far concept art has come as a field,

319
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:58,750
where we just get to loose-breast shit and everyone's like,

320
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,350
oh, cool, I'm like, oh, wow.

321
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,231
Like, so many people give us so much credit for being so inspirational

322
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:08,432
that they forget that they could have Google-searched something almost as, like, better.

323
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:13,842
So, you know, and piggybacking off of some stuff Rob said in his talk earlier,

324
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:16,925
which was so true, that reality is not the be-all, end-all.

325
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:18,566
You have to plus it.

326
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:20,388
Um...

327
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:28,935
All right, so I'm gonna talk about, show you this thing.

328
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:32,879
This is something I made for some future Gumroad talks

329
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,801
that we're doing.

330
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:36,983
It's called the Four Zones of Awesomeness.

331
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:41,765
And I'll put this online on our website, you can get a copy of it.

332
00:15:43,346 --> 00:15:48,807
And what I tried to do was outline the categories as I saw it, based on training these guys

333
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:53,869
from beginning to end, as I saw it, what are the zones of area that can be improved on,

334
00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:54,429
right?

335
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:56,230
What are the zones of areas that can be worked on?

336
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,410
And I broke it down.

337
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,810
Now, this is not going to stay like this.

338
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,531
This is going to constantly change as the industry changes.

339
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:06,173
But I will talk about each one of these things briefly, and then I'll go into a little more

340
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:07,053
detail on each one.

341
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,051
So cheatiness, do you use photo reference

342
00:16:11,272 --> 00:16:13,713
and 3D to steal colors, get poses exactly right,

343
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:15,554
or put outright photographs in your shot

344
00:16:15,614 --> 00:16:16,675
as an actual part of your painting,

345
00:16:17,135 --> 00:16:18,556
and then hide your tracks expertly

346
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:20,337
so no one will ever know, like a boss?

347
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:21,218
Good.

348
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:24,520
Okay, and this is gonna refer to

349
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:28,583
all the different ways in which you can cheat.

350
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,264
And in this one, you're kinda cherry picking.

351
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:34,686
And part of art directing my team, I've noticed,

352
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:37,408
Because I was telling them over lunch today, we had a disaster.

353
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:39,449
Just last night, I was about to give an art direction talk.

354
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,912
One of our directors I work with was pissed off at some stuff we delivered.

355
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:44,333
And I was like, god damn it.

356
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:45,794
I can't give this talk anymore.

357
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:47,395
But it was the reason was,

358
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:51,438
it's because we approached something with the wrong cheating technique, I think.

359
00:16:51,818 --> 00:16:54,560
And I told my guy what to do, and I helped coach him,

360
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,922
but I coached him in the wrong direction.

361
00:16:57,202 --> 00:16:58,563
But here's all the ways you can cheat.

362
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:00,424
Let's talk about them real quick as an overview,

363
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:01,765
just so you know what's possible.

364
00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:03,826
One of them, the most egregious, is Google Earth.

365
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:11,350
Did you guys know that you can fly around cities in Google Earth?

366
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,692
And like if you're doing a city shot with Batman or something, you can like just find

367
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:17,812
the shot in the city and you have most of the city kind of done.

368
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:22,074
You know what I mean?

369
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,975
Or you could just use it to find a nice composition.

370
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:28,456
Or have a good 3D perspective of a city.

371
00:17:28,476 --> 00:17:30,697
If you were going to do like a Batman or something, posed on a roof.

372
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:33,047
and you wanted to just have something to get you going?

373
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:34,388
Granted, you were going to replace all this.

374
00:17:34,648 --> 00:17:35,909
But you got Windows for scale.

375
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:37,870
Even if you replace all these textures, do you know what I mean?

376
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:39,852
And imagine how useful that is.

377
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,773
I mean, what a shame to have this

378
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:44,534
and not even use it just to give you a rough idea.

379
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:46,536
You have this 3D library

380
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:53,720
of stuff that just exists in real cities,

381
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,122
3D modeled for you with textures all over the world for you to fly around.

382
00:17:57,883 --> 00:17:58,303
Think about it.

383
00:17:59,604 --> 00:18:00,224
We use that sometimes.

384
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:01,860
That's Google Earth.

385
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,361
3D Daz.

386
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:03,301
I don't have that pulled up.

387
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:04,082
Do you guys know Daz?

388
00:18:04,102 --> 00:18:04,703
Anyone know Daz?

389
00:18:05,763 --> 00:18:07,565
Let me show you the power of Daz real quick.

390
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:13,570
So for one of our paintings, we had this.

391
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:17,073
This is a recent one we did for Ultima Underworld.

392
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:20,356
They just met their Kickstarter, so congrats to them.

393
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:26,021
Legendary game designers.

394
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:29,020
they commissioned us to do this piece.

395
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,821
Now, this piece I'm gonna talk about in and out.

396
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:33,342
I'm gonna have like three or four pieces

397
00:18:33,382 --> 00:18:35,043
that I keep going back to and discussing

398
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:37,044
because each one has so many parts

399
00:18:37,764 --> 00:18:40,125
of what we do in the cheatiness department

400
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:41,426
and the design department.

401
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:46,088
But yeah, this was the basic final.

402
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:53,665
And in some ways, I have to say, in some ways, that piece, probably the most elaborate we've ever done,

403
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:55,385
was a financial disaster.

404
00:18:55,965 --> 00:18:59,006
And that's why it's such a good case study, because we're going to talk about all the things in it

405
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,326
that worked and didn't work.

406
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:01,966
We almost took every road

407
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:05,607
and came back to final. And we made it what I thought was good, but

408
00:19:06,127 --> 00:19:08,408
it was, uh, we, it hurt us.

409
00:19:08,868 --> 00:19:10,908
And we learned a lot from it, so it was mainly a learning experience.

410
00:19:11,428 --> 00:19:12,468
But, Daz.

411
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:15,789
Ta-da!

412
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,910
This is how artists block out.

413
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,012
complicated scenes with lots of characters at our studio.

414
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:25,454
Just figure it out like this.

415
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,195
Even put basic lights in there.

416
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:32,257
So Modo, if you're into concept art, and you don't know Modo or you don't know 3D software,

417
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:35,299
I would say that's the number one skill you need to have after Photoshop.

418
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,061
I can't even imagine starting now and not having any 3D.

419
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:40,822
It's like, you almost can't.

420
00:19:41,062 --> 00:19:43,664
For us, again, based on my taste, you saw what I like.

421
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,605
Based on my taste, you can't do any of that work without 3D knowledge.

422
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:50,839
And especially because like this, he could move the camera anywhere he wants.

423
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:52,260
So we could try out a bunch of different things.

424
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:54,722
And these models, we didn't even make them.

425
00:19:54,742 --> 00:19:55,763
We just found them online.

426
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:56,244
They're free.

427
00:19:56,304 --> 00:19:57,304
Daz has a library.

428
00:19:57,324 --> 00:19:58,245
You just get one.

429
00:19:58,725 --> 00:20:00,167
And if you need to buy one, you just buy one.

430
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:01,107
They're like, whatever, $30.

431
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:05,226
You could buy an armored dude for 30 bucks and use that as a start to design your character.

432
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:09,729
And then you have a 3D guy that you can pose however you want and then start painting on top of him.

433
00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:11,390
While you're drawing him from scratch.

434
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,892
In four hours, you could change the design to whatever you want, but now you get to focus on the design.

435
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:19,334
You don't have to worry about getting the drawing right. You get to focus on the design.

436
00:20:19,675 --> 00:20:20,955
And it's gonna look so slick.

437
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:25,118
I'll show you another example of some Daz looking stuff.

438
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:26,619
What we got here?

439
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:31,402
Here's some other zombies we did.

440
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:35,453
And it started with Daz, just kind of like figuring out the basic poses.

441
00:20:36,554 --> 00:20:38,436
And this was a top-down three-quarter game, Deadline.

442
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:43,341
And we ended up using these as a base and then painting on top of them.

443
00:20:45,903 --> 00:20:48,266
This guy went nuts with them. We'll talk about this guy a little bit more.

444
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,483
But having that 3D base let him spend so much time

445
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:55,244
on other stuff, so much time.

446
00:20:55,264 --> 00:20:56,584
Because you kind of have the same amount of time.

447
00:20:56,604 --> 00:20:59,005
You got like a day maybe to get a character done.

448
00:20:59,346 --> 00:21:00,446
So get the drawing and pose,

449
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:02,007
and it's done in like 20 minutes.

450
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,428
Okay, well now you have seven hours and 40 minutes

451
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:05,849
to work on Juice.

452
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:08,190
We'll talk about what Juice is in a minute.

453
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:09,731
But to Juice it.

454
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,451
Juice it!

455
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:13,132
Okay?

456
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:16,434
So that's Daz's model,

457
00:21:16,454 --> 00:21:17,995
and you can see kind of how powerful that is.

458
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,390
What else we got here? 3D perspective.

459
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,491
Again, using 3D to get our perspective right

460
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,412
is something we also always do,

461
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:28,673
especially for anything with architecture.

462
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:30,813
So again, where the 3D comes in,

463
00:21:31,153 --> 00:21:31,913
we have this painting

464
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:34,554
that you saw on the website there.

465
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,996
This is an impossible thing to, you know,

466
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:41,176
stuff, space stuff especially,

467
00:21:41,476 --> 00:21:42,577
you definitely need 3D for.

468
00:21:43,057 --> 00:21:45,157
And that was our initial 3D blockout for that.

469
00:21:47,054 --> 00:21:48,295
And I'll reference this a couple times,

470
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:50,277
because how we use 3D for this painting

471
00:21:50,317 --> 00:21:52,158
is how we use 3D for, like, quite a bit of stuff.

472
00:21:55,321 --> 00:21:56,021
What else we got here?

473
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:06,250
Put one of those copies of that up here.

474
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:08,972
So that's 3D for perspective.

475
00:22:09,032 --> 00:22:10,533
Now you kind of don't have perspective

476
00:22:10,553 --> 00:22:11,674
to worry about anymore, right?

477
00:22:11,894 --> 00:22:13,555
Your perspective is all sorted in 3D.

478
00:22:14,096 --> 00:22:16,378
Now, is it not important to have perspective knowledge?

479
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:20,944
right? If you're in school or you're learning perspective, well, yeah, it is, and it's nice, but

480
00:22:21,604 --> 00:22:24,766
I don't know why you would use it anymore.

481
00:22:25,747 --> 00:22:29,990
I mean, there probably is a use for it, and maybe I know some perspective stuff I'm taking for granted, like, I'm not aware

482
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,631
of how perspective enters into my knowledge of

483
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:34,192
drawing and painting, but, like,

484
00:22:34,793 --> 00:22:37,314
man, if you can build a 3D model, now you're not spending time,

485
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:43,138
I mean, certainly, like, learning perspective, 3-point and, like, doing all that is a fun exercise, but it's, it's kind of like

486
00:22:43,498 --> 00:22:45,139
learning pottery if you're going to do concept art.

487
00:22:45,945 --> 00:22:48,808
That's kind of a bold statement. That's too strong of a statement. I'll take that back.

488
00:22:49,108 --> 00:22:51,210
I rescind. Perspective is important.

489
00:22:54,994 --> 00:22:56,976
So, that's pretty darn handy.

490
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,317
What else we got here?

491
00:22:59,018 --> 00:23:04,123
3D lighting. So that covers that. You saw that before. He even did some 3D, some lights in that 3D scene.

492
00:23:04,543 --> 00:23:04,983
And this thing.

493
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:10,569
That helped to kind of illuminate the scene. And the lights, of course, are part of the composition.

494
00:23:11,595 --> 00:23:13,775
You know, you start to see different shapes of stuff.

495
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,776
You put the light where you want to silhouette the characters,

496
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:17,857
where you want to leave the eye.

497
00:23:18,237 --> 00:23:20,438
And it's not too figured out in the lighting department, of course.

498
00:23:20,478 --> 00:23:22,219
It's still pretty, you know, rough mock-up.

499
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:25,980
Photo for environment.

500
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,541
What that means is finding a photo for an environment.

501
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:34,683
Because, again, one of the ways in which you run up this hill,

502
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:36,484
run up this thing,

503
00:23:37,424 --> 00:23:39,305
is if someone gave you an environment painting to work on.

504
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:43,117
You know, a lot of people in school...

505
00:23:43,877 --> 00:23:44,758
Oh, God, so bright.

506
00:23:44,778 --> 00:23:48,339
A lot of people in school would probably start with...

507
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,460
Well, how would you start?

508
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:53,782
Blocking your shapes, right?

509
00:23:54,322 --> 00:23:54,962
Hell yeah.

510
00:23:56,123 --> 00:23:57,704
Hell yeah, that's blocking them shapes.

511
00:23:59,244 --> 00:23:59,685
F key.

512
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,126
Yeah, you get the silhouette right, right?

513
00:24:03,186 --> 00:24:04,567
You kind of start off by, like...

514
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:06,428
This is a little bit too big,

515
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,828
because my computer is the worst.

516
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:09,549
What's the best laptop, guys?

517
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:10,530
Because I just can't find one.

518
00:24:12,972 --> 00:24:13,573
Tell me after.

519
00:24:15,614 --> 00:24:16,375
This is brand new.

520
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:18,897
It's a brand new $700 laptop.

521
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:23,200
Okay, so you block in some shapes.

522
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:29,685
So someone said, okay, we want you to do this fervent mountain Shangri-La, like this Ireland

523
00:24:29,745 --> 00:24:34,829
type landscape that's like super fantastical, and with incredible rock formations and all

524
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:36,030
kinds of zany stuff.

525
00:24:36,371 --> 00:24:40,754
So you might, you might get in there and start like messing around with some shapes.

526
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:47,005
You know, you paint them in like you do.

527
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:48,946
You know, you erase them out like you do.

528
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:50,846
And you start kind of developing some stuff.

529
00:24:50,886 --> 00:24:54,367
And you might have a, what's his name?

530
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:55,907
Stick Salesman.

531
00:24:59,968 --> 00:25:00,869
You guys seen that site?

532
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:03,389
The Adventures of Stick Salesman?

533
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,970
It's all a bunch of concept art

534
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,710
that has this guy holding a stick in it.

535
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:10,531
From all over, just random concept art.

536
00:25:11,191 --> 00:25:12,712
Look it up, Adventures of Stick Salesman.

537
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:13,872
It's really good.

538
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:18,876
Okay, so, you know, you come up with, like, an awesome rough thing.

539
00:25:20,637 --> 00:25:23,739
Right? Which is, which could be cool. It's a great way to start, you know?

540
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:25,479
And it's a great way to kind of get a rough idea.

541
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,161
But let's say you started fleshing it out from here,

542
00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:33,584
kind of to that level. And again, depending on how much mileage you had, you'd do this better.

543
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:37,105
Like, if you had drawn thousands of mountains, lots and lots of rocks,

544
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:39,767
you would have more of a sense of how they could be formed.

545
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:43,248
Right? But if you hadn't drawn a lot of rocks, you'd do classic, um...

546
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,252
You do classic, let me do a concept art, more concept art tropes.

547
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:53,277
You have rocks going this way, and then you have rocks going this way.

548
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:56,239
I'm like, that's not geologically feasible.

549
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,582
Rocks grow a certain way, you can't just have rocks going all different ways.

550
00:26:01,283 --> 00:26:02,964
The sediment layers on, right?

551
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:05,446
The sediment layers on, and then it lifts the rock up.

552
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:05,926
How dare you?

553
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:13,852
So we had a lot of conversations about what's geologically reasonable in our, at our company.

554
00:26:14,337 --> 00:26:15,598
So you'd have rocks going different ways.

555
00:26:15,978 --> 00:26:17,960
So, if you had left it at that,

556
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,301
you would kind of be limited at a certain point.

557
00:26:20,982 --> 00:26:23,724
Because, especially when you got into starting to texture it

558
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:25,325
and add all the little bits and pieces,

559
00:26:26,026 --> 00:26:26,646
you would kind of,

560
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:29,308
and especially what your knowledge of geology is,

561
00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:30,589
and I know that's a weird thing to think about

562
00:26:30,609 --> 00:26:31,950
when you're a concept artist drawing rocks,

563
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,412
but like, if you want the rocks to feel far away,

564
00:26:34,452 --> 00:26:35,512
like they're the right scale,

565
00:26:35,993 --> 00:26:37,974
ah, so much cool NDA stuff I can't show you.

566
00:26:38,494 --> 00:26:38,955
Damn it.

567
00:26:39,455 --> 00:26:41,377
But if you wanted to draw rocks that were the right scale,

568
00:26:43,098 --> 00:26:43,978
you would need something.

569
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:48,278
And you had sent me, like, something that was loose like that.

570
00:26:48,318 --> 00:26:50,159
So let's say you fleshed that out and it was a little more painterly.

571
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:54,100
And I looked up online and I found, I don't know...

572
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:57,242
I looked up this place, the Faroe Islands.

573
00:26:57,922 --> 00:26:58,602
I'd be like, you're fired.

574
00:27:00,623 --> 00:27:01,503
What do I need you for?

575
00:27:02,084 --> 00:27:03,204
You joking? Like, look at that.

576
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:06,025
How hard would this be to, like, change a few shapes on?

577
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:11,147
So maybe you started with that, but then maybe you went in later.

578
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:14,665
or you had this as an inspiration, and you could do it a lot of different ways, you know,

579
00:27:14,705 --> 00:27:17,906
you could start with the sketch and then you could simplify that out a little bit to kind

580
00:27:17,946 --> 00:27:18,407
of match it.

581
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,687
Or you could go vice versa, do you know what I mean?

582
00:27:21,047 --> 00:27:27,350
But if you have the incredible things that exist in the world, like this, this is called

583
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,231
Tindholmer, and it's in the Faroe Islands, which is a random island chain.

584
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:34,072
I mean, what the hell are you talking about, nature?

585
00:27:35,893 --> 00:27:40,315
And it's so much more, it's so much more beautiful and nuanced.

586
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:43,229
than that initial thing.

587
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,351
Like, that's cool, but we've seen that, right?

588
00:27:45,851 --> 00:27:46,391
We've seen that.

589
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:49,493
And again, we're working with the couple of top studios

590
00:27:49,513 --> 00:27:50,354
and there's 200 people.

591
00:27:50,414 --> 00:27:51,995
So how are you gonna get them?

592
00:27:53,316 --> 00:27:53,976
How are you gonna get them?

593
00:27:54,336 --> 00:27:56,197
You're gonna go in there like a crazy person

594
00:27:58,459 --> 00:28:00,020
and have an actual passion

595
00:28:01,341 --> 00:28:03,762
for the fact that this goes down like that.

596
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,083
You're like, oh, that's cool.

597
00:28:06,804 --> 00:28:09,366
If you've ever looked at something so miniscule and stupid,

598
00:28:09,426 --> 00:28:10,767
like the fact that this drops off,

599
00:28:11,939 --> 00:28:15,440
and gone like, oh, that's kind of cool how it does that.

600
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,401
Then you're a crazy person, right?

601
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:19,981
And that's how you know you've reached, you're getting up,

602
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:21,962
you have your sights on those top 200 people

603
00:28:22,422 --> 00:28:23,883
because they're all insane, right?

604
00:28:24,143 --> 00:28:27,564
They have a love for these fucking, I love it.

605
00:28:27,904 --> 00:28:28,764
Like, I love that.

606
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:29,964
Everyone has a different thing.

607
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:31,085
I don't care about tech stuff.

608
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,686
But one of my guys, when he looks at stuff,

609
00:28:36,586 --> 00:28:37,267
who did this thing.

610
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:44,122
He designed these panels like five or six times on here on the side,

611
00:28:44,162 --> 00:28:47,065
this computer panel with different types of layouts,

612
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:48,526
and he had touchscreens, and he had nodules,

613
00:28:48,566 --> 00:28:49,827
and he keeps changing them, and he's like,

614
00:28:49,907 --> 00:28:51,169
I don't like those, they look like shit.

615
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:53,991
I'm like, they don't look like shit, they look fine.

616
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:55,312
He's like, they look like shit.

617
00:28:56,073 --> 00:28:59,116
And I was like, OK, you're teaching me stuff,

618
00:28:59,176 --> 00:29:02,118
because I don't love panels.

619
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,981
I love rock things.

620
00:29:05,688 --> 00:29:08,529
So everyone has their own thing that they care about.

621
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,431
Now, he's taught me, he's trained me,

622
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:14,333
he's pulled me up that mountain, right?

623
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:17,274
Because we're both here, and he's been up here,

624
00:29:17,294 --> 00:29:18,895
and he's been like, no, this way, dumbass.

625
00:29:18,915 --> 00:29:20,496
And I'm like, no, I like it in the tent.

626
00:29:21,377 --> 00:29:22,057
It's warm in here.

627
00:29:22,097 --> 00:29:24,478
But he's telling me, like, no, this is the way we're going with tech stuff.

628
00:29:24,718 --> 00:29:25,599
And he teaches me.

629
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,781
And part of the reason is because he loves it

630
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:31,462
and has an outstanding eye for tech.

631
00:29:33,183 --> 00:29:33,843
You know, he did this.

632
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:41,092
And I love storytelling and people.

633
00:29:41,812 --> 00:29:44,774
And he's very kind of methodical and just all about the tech.

634
00:29:45,355 --> 00:29:48,837
So I said, you know, we had this guy posed in a lot of different kinds of,

635
00:29:49,418 --> 00:29:50,939
just like in a generic background.

636
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,560
And I was like, what if, it was during the World Cup, I'm like,

637
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:55,462
what if he's got a kid's soccer ball?

638
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,825
And there's like a little African kid and he wants his soccer ball back.

639
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:02,847
And the robot's like, scanning ball.

640
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,168
I thought, oh, that'll be like a fun story.

641
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:08,574
So we collaborated. Collaborated in that I said stuff and then he did all the work.

642
00:30:08,614 --> 00:30:12,195
But like, that's a collaboration. I'm an art director, so.

643
00:30:12,775 --> 00:30:18,197
But he's got a real passion for how parts and pieces come together.

644
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:23,959
You know, like how that trim looks. How these canisters are.

645
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,660
How the weathering is. What these latches actually do.

646
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,521
How the hinges would actually work.

647
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:34,003
And he'll spend time designing these individual pieces.

648
00:30:35,886 --> 00:30:39,188
Now, the only reason he can design to that level of detail

649
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:41,690
and keep messing around with it is, again, because, of course,

650
00:30:42,311 --> 00:30:43,051
he builds it in 3D.

651
00:30:44,332 --> 00:30:46,273
And he goes back and forth, and he does lots of iterations

652
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:46,714
in 3D.

653
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:51,697
And if we're going to go back to our part, our slide here,

654
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:54,319
some of the things he used here, what's another one?

655
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:54,980
Kit bashing.

656
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,140
A7.

657
00:30:57,061 --> 00:30:58,222
Does anyone know what kit bashing is?

658
00:30:59,603 --> 00:30:59,843
Yeah?

659
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:04,386
OK, kit bashing is the most egregious of cheating trickery.

660
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,292
You find someone who has a lot of awesome parts,

661
00:31:08,112 --> 00:31:09,834
and a lot of people sell their parts online,

662
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:11,135
um,

663
00:31:12,315 --> 00:31:15,658
and great 3D modelers who know how to build really beautiful, complex things,

664
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,819
and then you can use them for whatever you want, right?

665
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,241
Like, this could have been, like, the inside of some case,

666
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:22,703
but this is some serious, like, skillful modeling.

667
00:31:22,963 --> 00:31:24,504
But this guy did not model this.

668
00:31:24,864 --> 00:31:26,305
He didn't model any of these details.

669
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:28,227
He just found pieces from this kit,

670
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:29,908
and then we just bashed them together.

671
00:31:30,148 --> 00:31:31,909
It's like sketching, but now you're sketching in 3D.

672
00:31:33,755 --> 00:31:36,658
And you still have to have an artistic eye, right?

673
00:31:36,718 --> 00:31:39,000
Because you might have to concentrate detail only here

674
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,401
and give us some rest here.

675
00:31:41,222 --> 00:31:44,124
Like there's a lot of people, concept artists nowadays,

676
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:47,047
who build everything in 3D.

677
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:48,828
They, you know, really high-end concept artists

678
00:31:48,848 --> 00:31:49,649
for like the top movies.

679
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:51,330
And they just put shit everywhere.

680
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,052
But this guy, I like him because he's got,

681
00:31:53,352 --> 00:31:54,513
he's still reserved, you know?

682
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:57,655
He left an area that didn't have detail on detail on detail.

683
00:31:57,956 --> 00:31:59,117
Again, I like oblivion.

684
00:31:59,597 --> 00:32:02,780
So he's in line with me, we're cool, thumbs up, we're onward.

685
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,351
So he built that, textured it after that.

686
00:32:11,252 --> 00:32:11,912
Real carefully.

687
00:32:12,312 --> 00:32:13,913
Again, that's not fun.

688
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:15,033
It's fun for him.

689
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:16,574
It's not fun for a normal sane person

690
00:32:17,094 --> 00:32:17,834
who likes to draw.

691
00:32:18,114 --> 00:32:18,775
He liked drawing.

692
00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:21,335
Not gonna go in here and find the right text

693
00:32:21,936 --> 00:32:22,616
for this hinge.

694
00:32:23,936 --> 00:32:24,396
You know what I mean?

695
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:25,757
It's like crazy.

696
00:32:26,037 --> 00:32:27,377
But he loves doing that sort of thing,

697
00:32:27,397 --> 00:32:28,578
and so that's kind of where his

698
00:32:29,098 --> 00:32:30,418
career ends up heading towards.

699
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,640
Photoshop.

700
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:39,151
character. We covered that. That's photo characters, finding a picture of a character. Photo shoot.

701
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:47,337
This one's kind of fun. We got a lot to say about this one. So, I'll start with this.

702
00:32:47,818 --> 00:32:56,184
Our guy Lake here. After he built the 3D, after he built the 3D, we had a conversation

703
00:32:57,125 --> 00:33:00,628
and he was like, how do I, do you think I should move forward with this? Should I build

704
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:03,670
more 3D? And I said, here's what you could do.

705
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,083
How much are we billing for this?

706
00:33:06,123 --> 00:33:07,885
Like, how much time are we spending on this painting?

707
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:09,927
We spent forever on this painting, like, two weeks.

708
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,369
I was like, go to the store.

709
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:15,032
Just go to the leather store and just go buy shit.

710
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:16,394
He's like, well, how much can I spend?

711
00:33:16,414 --> 00:33:17,695
I was like, I don't know, a hundred bucks?

712
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:18,215
I don't know.

713
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:20,218
Like, how much money do we spend making a game?

714
00:33:20,238 --> 00:33:21,459
Like, $150 million?

715
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:23,641
Yeah, spend a hundred bucks at the store

716
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:24,722
and save yourself some time.

717
00:33:25,043 --> 00:33:25,883
Go buy some shit.

718
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:27,605
But you gotta have balls to be this guy.

719
00:33:28,764 --> 00:33:30,585
You have to really not give a shit.

720
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:31,425
You have to be like,

721
00:33:31,785 --> 00:33:34,025
I'm buying the boots, I'm doing everything, I'm dressing up,

722
00:33:34,425 --> 00:33:36,286
I'm wrapping it, and I'm getting in character.

723
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,046
And he did a lot of poses, right?

724
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:39,727
He didn't just get this down in one shot.

725
00:33:40,547 --> 00:33:42,327
And he even took care to match the lighting.

726
00:33:43,048 --> 00:33:44,528
He put a light on the floor moving up.

727
00:33:44,928 --> 00:33:45,748
This one's really cool.

728
00:33:46,088 --> 00:33:48,169
Because he's using his iPhone light as a fireball.

729
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,010
I mean, that's insane!

730
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,591
You're competing with this guy?

731
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:56,891
He's a crazy person!

732
00:33:57,981 --> 00:33:58,421
How are you gonna?

733
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:00,101
And that's how all my guys are.

734
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:03,442
They're all like that because once they all kind of start talking to each other, they're

735
00:34:03,462 --> 00:34:05,043
like, oh, I guess it's not crazy to do that.

736
00:34:05,563 --> 00:34:06,543
I guess that's totally normal.

737
00:34:07,163 --> 00:34:09,144
Don't tell them that they're crazy.

738
00:34:10,964 --> 00:34:16,385
Another guy that did something similar was on this piece.

739
00:34:20,927 --> 00:34:23,207
We had this painting that we did for the military.

740
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:27,553
for the actual military, which was cool actually. They had this guy, Captain Long, who

741
00:34:29,795 --> 00:34:33,019
this division was being retired. And you know they do commemorative paintings of the military,

742
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:35,041
but now they wanted to give it like a contemporary spin.

743
00:34:35,581 --> 00:34:39,706
So they hired us to say, we got this guy. And I read his story. This guy's story was crazy.

744
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:43,650
So it was Vietnam. He's fighting off, you know, the enemy.

745
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:47,340
and they start kind of ambushing them in these ACAVs

746
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,842
and he starts, like, shooting. He runs into the bushes, but then he runs out

747
00:34:50,862 --> 00:34:53,684
and he starts grabbing guys and pulling them to safety.

748
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,905
Grabbing them. Wounded guys, one at a time, one at a time.

749
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:58,726
And then, he went up into the top of one of those things

750
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:02,428
and someone had thrown a grenade into it, and he had, like, three guys around him

751
00:35:02,648 --> 00:35:04,730
and then he just smothered a grenade and blew himself up.

752
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,891
Yeah. That kind of guy.

753
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:09,672
So I was like, oh yeah, we're doing this job. For sure.

754
00:35:10,052 --> 00:35:11,793
So that's him. And, uh...

755
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,501
It was the most badass thing I've ever heard.

756
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:16,362
They're doing like a big old commemorative, you know, ceremony for him.

757
00:35:16,402 --> 00:35:17,683
And they're retiring this division.

758
00:35:17,923 --> 00:35:19,244
This is a really fun image to work on.

759
00:35:19,504 --> 00:35:22,926
But it was a lot of back and forth and a lot of like pitfalls.

760
00:35:22,986 --> 00:35:28,688
But again, after Lake had done that other piece, this guy's like, oh, yeah, dude,

761
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:30,029
I'll take pictures, screw it.

762
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:31,990
Doing it.

763
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:32,550
Bam.

764
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:36,512
You know?

765
00:35:37,573 --> 00:35:40,134
So it kind of started a trend of like, oh, I guess crazy is not so crazy.

766
00:35:44,984 --> 00:35:47,605
Movie stills, that was something Rob touched on too,

767
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,825
which I think was really good.

768
00:35:49,926 --> 00:35:53,087
In that, stills from movies, and this is again,

769
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:54,908
a lot of these things, I'm just saying them,

770
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,569
but I don't even do them that much.

771
00:35:57,729 --> 00:35:59,170
Movie stills is like a new thing.

772
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,811
That's like, when he said it again in his talk,

773
00:36:01,851 --> 00:36:03,512
I was like, we really gotta do that more.

774
00:36:04,112 --> 00:36:05,333
But we haven't done it enough.

775
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:07,814
And, cause for movies you get a really awesome sense of,

776
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,895
really well art direction, good production design.

777
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:12,996
How many guys saw his talk?

778
00:36:14,483 --> 00:36:14,763
Rob's?

779
00:36:15,683 --> 00:36:17,483
Yeah, he had all these cinematographers

780
00:36:17,523 --> 00:36:18,964
that I felt so stupid.

781
00:36:18,984 --> 00:36:20,264
I was like, I should know all these people

782
00:36:20,284 --> 00:36:21,284
with weird French names.

783
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:26,105
But, in terms of class, right,

784
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:27,626
if that's the style that you're into

785
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:30,686
and you're on board with the style that I said I liked,

786
00:36:31,126 --> 00:36:33,247
then this kind of movie would be an amazing movie

787
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:34,547
to kind of look at for everything.

788
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:38,028
You know, and looking at something like this.

789
00:36:40,388 --> 00:36:42,489
When I was telling you, Justin, for example,

790
00:36:42,509 --> 00:36:43,429
he had this thing where he...

791
00:36:44,524 --> 00:36:46,566
cared about those monitors, right?

792
00:36:46,866 --> 00:36:48,128
And he was like, really cared about them,

793
00:36:48,148 --> 00:36:49,089
and I care about rocks.

794
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,792
You're like, well, how do I, I don't care.

795
00:36:51,832 --> 00:36:53,534
Like, how do I develop an understanding

796
00:36:53,555 --> 00:36:54,476
of what's good design?

797
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,258
Because that's such an ambiguous thing.

798
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:00,763
It's over here, in this section right here, design.

799
00:37:01,104 --> 00:37:02,585
How do I get like a good sense of it?

800
00:37:03,747 --> 00:37:09,651
I would say, just look at your favorite thing and copy that for the first six months that

801
00:37:09,671 --> 00:37:10,472
you do that thing.

802
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:11,733
And it's going to look awesome.

803
00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:13,634
And then you'll start to develop your own thing.

804
00:37:13,854 --> 00:37:16,176
And anyway, it's going to be your own thing anyway, because you won't be able to copy

805
00:37:16,196 --> 00:37:16,696
it exactly.

806
00:37:16,997 --> 00:37:20,899
But you might look at this, if you were designing a space outfit, and look at his holster, look

807
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,363
at how it's connected, look how it's weathered, look at the kind of gun, the design of the

808
00:37:25,403 --> 00:37:26,824
gun, how it's put together.

809
00:37:27,104 --> 00:37:29,626
These are the best people in the world, and these movies come out all the time.

810
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:31,707
And how many of you have walked through them and screen grabbed?

811
00:37:32,355 --> 00:37:34,096
I'm talking to myself because I haven't done that enough either.

812
00:37:35,377 --> 00:37:35,998
But it's messed up.

813
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:39,961
Because you've got all this amazing design information every time a blockbuster film

814
00:37:40,001 --> 00:37:42,163
comes out that you can just get yourself going.

815
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:49,368
Again, that's only if you are interested in going up really fast.

816
00:37:50,149 --> 00:37:50,409
You know?

817
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:53,612
That's, the copying thing is only for people who just want to go straight up.

818
00:37:53,652 --> 00:37:56,974
Because again, you saw the movie did it, and the movie's up here, so you're like, I'm going

819
00:37:56,994 --> 00:37:57,315
that way.

820
00:37:57,835 --> 00:37:59,536
But if you want to explore, enjoy.

821
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:00,237
You know?

822
00:38:00,517 --> 00:38:01,298
Hang glide off this clip.

823
00:38:03,132 --> 00:38:03,652
Do whatever you want.

824
00:38:04,193 --> 00:38:05,594
But if you want to move straight up,

825
00:38:05,654 --> 00:38:07,115
just copy people who did it really well.

826
00:38:09,117 --> 00:38:09,677
Shape Juice.

827
00:38:10,558 --> 00:38:13,861
This is one of the biggest, I think,

828
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:15,743
things in terms of me trying to figure out

829
00:38:15,803 --> 00:38:18,605
who I can possibly hire to do this kind of work

830
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:23,770
is that they have an awesome sense of shape design.

831
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,471
And for that, I'm going back to the best.

832
00:38:26,232 --> 00:38:26,833
The best.

833
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:33,310
and it's my boy Eitan, one of the best concept artists I've ever seen.

834
00:38:34,491 --> 00:38:36,653
And really it's because he knows how to simplify stuff.

835
00:38:37,474 --> 00:38:41,119
Really simplify stuff. He'll find a photo, like you can see he found some photos,

836
00:38:41,459 --> 00:38:44,843
but then he'll like blend mode over them. Or he'll find a photo

837
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:48,227
and he'll simplify the overall shape, like maybe he started with the shape like you saw,

838
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:49,408
then he put the photos in.

839
00:38:50,155 --> 00:38:51,295
that added a believableness.

840
00:38:51,555 --> 00:38:53,836
And then he blended them out with like a mixer brush tool

841
00:38:53,856 --> 00:38:54,756
or with some overpainting.

842
00:38:55,156 --> 00:38:57,057
Just enough so they don't look like photos anymore.

843
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:57,537
Right?

844
00:38:57,557 --> 00:38:58,137
That's the goal.

845
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:00,058
It's to find that exact line.

846
00:39:00,278 --> 00:39:01,778
And it's a very subtle and nuanced line.

847
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,339
He also has stuff like this.

848
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:07,860
And he's master of this thing he likes to call slice of light.

849
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,540
That's his thing.

850
00:39:10,021 --> 00:39:11,181
He loves slices of light.

851
00:39:12,861 --> 00:39:13,802
So that's shape juice.

852
00:39:13,942 --> 00:39:16,242
Now, depending on the job you're working on,

853
00:39:16,282 --> 00:39:18,343
we have a lot of jobs where maybe we can do that.

854
00:39:18,863 --> 00:39:19,883
Have them be more sexy.

855
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,021
We try sometimes to have it be simple and clean and sexy.

856
00:39:29,162 --> 00:39:32,743
But it depends, when Eitan is doing his own personal pieces,

857
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,844
he can do whatever he wants with the shapes, right?

858
00:39:34,864 --> 00:39:37,145
Because his shapes are dictating the composition.

859
00:39:37,445 --> 00:39:38,605
He's literally making shapes,

860
00:39:39,005 --> 00:39:39,986
and then whatever that shape is,

861
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,606
okay, well that's the tower, right?

862
00:39:42,126 --> 00:39:44,407
In pro concept art, and he of course is a pro too,

863
00:39:44,747 --> 00:39:45,948
but in concept art where you have

864
00:39:45,988 --> 00:39:47,088
like a bunch of technical things

865
00:39:47,128 --> 00:39:48,008
or a bunch of requirements,

866
00:39:48,328 --> 00:39:49,269
you can kind of do it,

867
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:51,630
but you can't do it as cleanly and simply as he can,

868
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,550
just because he's got absolutely no restraints.

869
00:39:55,252 --> 00:39:57,534
But you can try, like we started with this piece.

870
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:03,359
And you can see that process beginning to end here.

871
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,040
Just messing with shapes.

872
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:13,728
And you can see, this is for, you guys know Cliffy B, game

873
00:40:13,748 --> 00:40:14,108
developer?

874
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:16,630
He started a studio called Boss Key, worked at Epic,

875
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:17,691
made Gears of War.

876
00:40:18,323 --> 00:40:20,284
Anyway, he started a new studio, and about two years ago,

877
00:40:20,324 --> 00:40:22,465
we did kind of all the initial concept art

878
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,845
to get his pitch off the ground.

879
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:26,285
To like pitch it, to get his money, to start a studio.

880
00:40:26,846 --> 00:40:29,126
Which was really awesome and really fun.

881
00:40:29,486 --> 00:40:33,407
But he had this, he had this really cool idea of these,

882
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:34,368
I can't say anything.

883
00:40:34,788 --> 00:40:37,688
So anyway, but he had these things that were floating,

884
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,569
and we had to sort of figure out

885
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:41,469
how we were gonna make it sexy at first with the shapes,

886
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:45,090
and then try to match it and build the entire thing in 3D

887
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:47,011
just so that we had perfect perspective.

888
00:40:47,622 --> 00:40:48,363
going into the background.

889
00:40:49,426 --> 00:40:51,570
And if you look at the final, I have to say...

890
00:41:00,193 --> 00:41:06,458
That little bit of extra craziness with like building a whole 3D model based on a sketch that's inherently done.

891
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:10,061
Right, we could have just taken the sketch and just started to photobash on top of it.

892
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:11,021
Maybe we didn't need the model.

893
00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:13,523
But the model gave us these awesome scale cues.

894
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:17,526
And so now this picture you feel like you're like, you're really moving through it.

895
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:20,088
Because you understand the scale really clearly and you know like,

896
00:41:20,308 --> 00:41:24,151
well that tree's really far so it has to have a much smaller texture than the tree that's closer up.

897
00:41:27,477 --> 00:41:30,859
So that's shape. That's a really difficult one to explain because it's more of a feel.

898
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,022
Color juice, I'll skip that one. It's a little difficult to talk about.

899
00:41:35,703 --> 00:41:46,230
Simplification and detail control. These are the highest level of sort of subtle sensibility

900
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:50,432
that you can have for a concept is the detail control. And I was trying to think of a sexier

901
00:41:50,472 --> 00:41:54,215
name for it, but really it's just detail control. And let me show you exactly what I mean.

902
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:56,696
That's the Captain Long image.

903
00:41:58,618 --> 00:42:02,480
Okay, we had this kind of ambient version of it done.

904
00:42:02,941 --> 00:42:06,303
And by ambient, meaning there was no direct sunlight, except for on this back tree, but

905
00:42:06,743 --> 00:42:10,866
I told the artist to paint it kind of in ambient light so that we could make sure it was thumbs

906
00:42:10,926 --> 00:42:14,888
up in the ambient light, and then later we'll add the sunlight on a separate layer.

907
00:42:15,709 --> 00:42:21,092
But you can see those trees in the background, and this painting, or let's say, we need another

908
00:42:21,152 --> 00:42:28,097
one here, this one, this was his kind of final one that he delivered.

909
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,626
right? Before, like, we kind of worked on it a little bit, me and him back and forth, and I

910
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:36,309
touched it up a little bit. But this is the final one he delivered. And there's a lack of detail

911
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:41,293
control. And this is such a nuanced and subtle thing, but it like, it's that next level. It's

912
00:42:41,313 --> 00:42:45,516
like between, like, the really good and, like, the superstars, is that they just have a sense of it.

913
00:42:45,576 --> 00:42:48,999
And what that, all that means is, when you see something that has too much detail,

914
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:53,562
like this tree, that isn't the focal point, they push it back just a little bit.

915
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:58,008
And there's all these techniques for doing it. One, the median filter in Photoshop.

916
00:42:58,408 --> 00:43:04,014
Maybe paint daubs. Maybe like, Aqueous Artwork, which is this filter that like, adds paint strokes to anything.

917
00:43:04,635 --> 00:43:07,277
But I'll show you, remember what that looked like. Let me see if I can...

918
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:09,860
pull up the next one.

919
00:43:11,401 --> 00:43:13,023
You see what happened to those trees in the background?

920
00:43:16,506 --> 00:43:17,107
Compared to this?

921
00:43:29,163 --> 00:43:31,385
Now you're like, well that's such a nuanced, subtle thing.

922
00:43:32,046 --> 00:43:35,230
But you notice how those edges in the background are just softer, and

923
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:38,594
they're less texture density, meaning there's a couple filters on them, on

924
00:43:38,654 --> 00:43:40,276
top of them, and they're seasoned.

925
00:43:40,496 --> 00:43:43,199
It's like seasoning a stew just perfectly.

926
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,563
And you season every little thing, and then you get something that when you

927
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:47,764
look at it in the end, you're like, well obviously,

928
00:43:47,784 --> 00:43:49,066
that's how it always should have been, duh.

929
00:43:49,598 --> 00:43:51,079
but it was perfectly seasoned.

930
00:43:51,479 --> 00:43:54,641
That's something that very, very few concept artists, I think,

931
00:43:54,901 --> 00:43:55,622
have an eye for.

932
00:43:56,002 --> 00:43:57,463
And something that's really hard to teach,

933
00:43:57,683 --> 00:43:58,483
and something that we're like,

934
00:43:58,863 --> 00:44:01,525
I'm hammering on them constantly for that kind of thing.

935
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:04,746
But it makes a big, big ol' difference.

936
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,310
Uh, composition.

937
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:14,131
That's in the Sexiness Shape Juice,

938
00:44:14,171 --> 00:44:15,032
I think that fits in here.

939
00:44:15,092 --> 00:44:17,313
Composition, we put it in three categories.

940
00:44:18,036 --> 00:44:20,257
because it applies in a lot of these different ways.

941
00:44:21,497 --> 00:44:22,418
Storytelling-iness.

942
00:44:24,598 --> 00:44:26,299
Do you know the story point of the picture

943
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:27,099
you are concepting?

944
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,840
Did you even decide what you're trying to say?

945
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:33,081
And are your visual decisions designed to help say it?

946
00:44:33,502 --> 00:44:35,722
Now I'm annoyed, when I hear that it just annoys me

947
00:44:35,742 --> 00:44:37,303
because it sounds like artistic bullshit.

948
00:44:37,783 --> 00:44:38,463
But here's what I mean.

949
00:44:43,301 --> 00:44:44,863
Is there even a narrative in your picture?

950
00:44:44,983 --> 00:44:48,346
I see so many pieces of art, too, that there's no narrative to it.

951
00:44:48,446 --> 00:44:51,670
And a lot of times with concept art, there is no directive to have a narrative, right?

952
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,913
Your art director may not even require it, and our art directors might not.

953
00:44:54,953 --> 00:44:57,956
They might say, just give us a picture, we need a landscape shot of this thing.

954
00:44:57,976 --> 00:45:00,199
We don't necessarily need a story to be told.

955
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:06,045
But when we delivered this to Cliffy, he didn't tell us about this narrative.

956
00:45:09,066 --> 00:45:13,789
that was supposed to be like a couple guys from the future, you know they're from the future because they have blue light things

957
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:19,613
and they're sitting around a fire and obviously they're well-dressed, they're not homeless, so you know they're like sort of

958
00:45:20,594 --> 00:45:24,596
well, not, not completely vagrants, there's some sort of faction, you can kind of tell

959
00:45:25,277 --> 00:45:28,719
and one of them starts noticing this thing, but the other two haven't noticed it yet

960
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:29,519
do you know what I mean?

961
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,541
there's like a lot of stuff going on, and it's just one moment

962
00:45:32,902 --> 00:45:34,403
why not? you know, throw it in there

963
00:45:34,743 --> 00:45:36,304
but it has to be simple, it has to be clear

964
00:45:36,504 --> 00:45:38,025
you see a lot of concepts too with like

965
00:45:38,955 --> 00:45:40,597
Maybe this is going on, right?

966
00:45:40,898 --> 00:45:45,605
This relationship between what's happening and what's happening, and also there's helicopters

967
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:46,326
shooting at each other.

968
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:51,995
And you're like, oh, one thing can ruin it.

969
00:45:52,677 --> 00:45:54,880
The narrative has to be super simple, super clear.

970
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,563
Again, if you saw Rob's talk, you'll know, like, it was just...

971
00:45:58,364 --> 00:46:00,887
The storytelling has to be so simple and so clear.

972
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:03,810
And in a lot of those shots, in a movie, you have more of an advantage, right?

973
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,912
Because in a movie, you can have multiple shots.

974
00:46:06,293 --> 00:46:06,893
We're stuck.

975
00:46:07,254 --> 00:46:09,857
So we already have to jam too much into the picture.

976
00:46:10,097 --> 00:46:11,358
Already. Because it's just concept.

977
00:46:11,378 --> 00:46:12,680
We only have one frame to tell the story.

978
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,222
In a movie, you can cut between them.

979
00:46:23,073 --> 00:46:24,734
design, taste, composition.

980
00:46:25,354 --> 00:46:26,894
We talked a little bit about all those things.

981
00:46:29,135 --> 00:46:30,395
And we talked about taste a little bit,

982
00:46:30,435 --> 00:46:33,476
but here's a slide that I helped to kind of underline it.

983
00:46:34,016 --> 00:46:35,856
Again, when I'm working on something,

984
00:46:36,396 --> 00:46:37,396
let's say an environment piece,

985
00:46:37,576 --> 00:46:38,817
I want it to have an epic vista.

986
00:46:39,377 --> 00:46:41,817
I want it to have a clear line of action.

987
00:46:42,057 --> 00:46:44,218
These are all the things that maybe I had wanted.

988
00:46:44,578 --> 00:46:45,678
The things that were grayed out

989
00:46:45,938 --> 00:46:47,599
was the things that the client may have wanted.

990
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,099
They wanted like a sunny, crisp day in the Himalayas.

991
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,351
The reason this is important is because...

992
00:46:54,832 --> 00:46:55,713
Actually, this is a big one.

993
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:01,356
Let me open one more thing here.

994
00:47:11,102 --> 00:47:15,826
Okay, there is the pasture, which is this fantasy world that...

995
00:47:17,552 --> 00:47:19,394
you're allowed to explore in, right?

996
00:47:19,434 --> 00:47:21,696
So a lot of times if you're starting a new IP or something,

997
00:47:21,856 --> 00:47:22,877
or you're doing your own project,

998
00:47:23,178 --> 00:47:25,720
you kind of have free reign to kind of do whatever you want.

999
00:47:26,361 --> 00:47:27,742
Or you might have an art director that says,

1000
00:47:28,243 --> 00:47:29,684
just, I want you to just explore.

1001
00:47:29,704 --> 00:47:30,705
Do you know what I mean?

1002
00:47:30,745 --> 00:47:32,887
I don't want you to like put any restraints on it.

1003
00:47:33,207 --> 00:47:34,729
Right now, sort of anything goes.

1004
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:39,914
And although, depending on the IP, that could be good.

1005
00:47:40,627 --> 00:47:42,810
if you have all the time and all the budget in the world.

1006
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:45,173
But our studio, this never works for us

1007
00:47:45,233 --> 00:47:46,916
because we're not like soldiers.

1008
00:47:46,956 --> 00:47:47,837
We're like Navy SEALs.

1009
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:51,592
We're called in for a specific job to kill a certain person,

1010
00:47:52,192 --> 00:47:54,554
and we come down, and we kill them, and then we leave,

1011
00:47:54,594 --> 00:47:55,655
and then we shed a single tear.

1012
00:47:55,855 --> 00:47:56,735
And that's all we do.

1013
00:47:57,236 --> 00:47:59,237
So for people who are in a studio setting,

1014
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:00,578
you're learning the art direction style.

1015
00:48:00,618 --> 00:48:01,799
You have a lot of time to figure it out.

1016
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:03,760
But we couldn't work for any of those studios.

1017
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,421
You can't have a cry tech call you and be like,

1018
00:48:05,702 --> 00:48:08,724
we need you to do this thing in three days on a brand new IP.

1019
00:48:09,404 --> 00:48:10,745
Whatever we deliver the first pass,

1020
00:48:10,765 --> 00:48:13,007
they're either firing us or they're keeping us.

1021
00:48:13,047 --> 00:48:15,028
We're not going to have a ton of time to explore.

1022
00:48:15,308 --> 00:48:17,870
So what I try to do with my guys.

1023
00:48:18,471 --> 00:48:22,033
and with every client is determine what this corral is.

1024
00:48:24,475 --> 00:48:25,296
What is it exactly?

1025
00:48:25,596 --> 00:48:28,258
Like here's the shape of everything that is possible,

1026
00:48:28,978 --> 00:48:30,780
and then here's the corral that we're allowed to play in.

1027
00:48:33,061 --> 00:48:35,523
And that corral could be any bit of art direction.

1028
00:48:35,543 --> 00:48:38,525
And that last one, it was sunny and it was Himalayas.

1029
00:48:38,925 --> 00:48:40,746
That's all they said. Right?

1030
00:48:41,444 --> 00:48:43,325
So a lot of people, you have two kinds of artists.

1031
00:48:43,345 --> 00:48:46,347
You have a kind of artist, in hiring I've noticed this,

1032
00:48:46,687 --> 00:48:47,728
a kind of artist that says,

1033
00:48:47,748 --> 00:48:50,730
fuck this corral, I'll do what I want, I'll do what I want.

1034
00:48:53,251 --> 00:48:54,832
And that's fair, I respect that.

1035
00:48:55,153 --> 00:48:57,314
But you can't work for very long if you have that attitude.

1036
00:48:57,954 --> 00:49:00,216
And then you have another kind of artist

1037
00:49:00,516 --> 00:49:01,897
that just cowers here in the corner,

1038
00:49:01,917 --> 00:49:03,498
is like, just tell me, just tell me,

1039
00:49:03,538 --> 00:49:05,159
please, please tell me what you want me to draw.

1040
00:49:05,991 --> 00:49:08,112
And that's just fucking maddening.

1041
00:49:08,192 --> 00:49:09,972
That's when I lose my shit, too.

1042
00:49:10,453 --> 00:49:12,333
Because this person has died inside,

1043
00:49:12,573 --> 00:49:13,814
and this person is lawless.

1044
00:49:16,475 --> 00:49:18,815
So, where is the perfect balance?

1045
00:49:18,896 --> 00:49:20,696
And there just, there is a perfect balance.

1046
00:49:21,216 --> 00:49:23,177
And that is like an ABCL.

1047
00:49:23,938 --> 00:49:27,200
You literally, nothing can phase you, but you're indestructible.

1048
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,661
And I want someone to have as much fun as they can in this space.

1049
00:49:31,081 --> 00:49:33,662
And that's kind of how I naturally ended up.

1050
00:49:33,902 --> 00:49:35,702
Because I'm, I like design.

1051
00:49:36,023 --> 00:49:39,044
So I like when you say x plus y equals,

1052
00:49:39,124 --> 00:49:41,825
and I go, oh, Z, here's a great solution to your problem

1053
00:49:42,085 --> 00:49:44,205
that I think is a visual solution to all the things.

1054
00:49:44,546 --> 00:49:45,786
You gave me all these parameters,

1055
00:49:46,106 --> 00:49:47,747
and I feel like we solved it beautifully.

1056
00:49:47,787 --> 00:49:48,427
How do you like that?

1057
00:49:48,687 --> 00:49:49,927
I get a lot of pleasure from that.

1058
00:49:51,604 --> 00:49:56,451
But I say, and this speaks to anyone who's struggling or starting out in concept art,

1059
00:49:57,051 --> 00:50:00,796
is no matter how small the job or whatever the parameters are that are given to you,

1060
00:50:01,417 --> 00:50:03,079
have a ton of fun in that space.

1061
00:50:04,857 --> 00:50:06,938
Do your best in this space.

1062
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:09,498
Because every job is going to be like this.

1063
00:50:09,538 --> 00:50:10,439
It never gets better.

1064
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:11,699
It's all going to be like this.

1065
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:12,919
You're always going to have a corral.

1066
00:50:12,939 --> 00:50:16,720
And it's fun to have an obstacle course to see what you can do and run around in.

1067
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,541
Instead of just running free.

1068
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:21,261
I get scared if you tell me to run anywhere and do anything.

1069
00:50:21,281 --> 00:50:22,902
I'm like, well, how do I know if I've solved it?

1070
00:50:23,122 --> 00:50:25,242
It's like you got rid of this and you'd be like, come up with solutions.

1071
00:50:25,362 --> 00:50:25,662
I'm like, D.

1072
00:50:26,122 --> 00:50:26,162
OK.

1073
00:50:26,182 --> 00:50:26,422
I don't know.

1074
00:50:26,442 --> 00:50:28,683
Does that work?

1075
00:50:28,703 --> 00:50:28,963
I don't know.

1076
00:50:28,983 --> 00:50:29,403
I don't know.

1077
00:50:29,423 --> 00:50:29,763
I don't know.

1078
00:50:29,803 --> 00:50:30,323
I don't know.

1079
00:50:30,343 --> 00:50:30,603
I don't know.

1080
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:35,102
I think there's a lot of games and art direction styles that, that, that are this way too.

1081
00:50:35,522 --> 00:50:38,503
They just kind of like, do whatever you want, and whatever cool shit you come up with.

1082
00:50:38,823 --> 00:50:42,925
Because the problem with this, and this goes all the way back to my taste.

1083
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:45,346
I like oblivion, right, and I like that aesthetic.

1084
00:50:46,346 --> 00:50:48,947
Is that I want all the visual things to come from story things.

1085
00:50:49,007 --> 00:50:51,868
Now in games they don't always, you know, they sometimes do, they sometimes don't.

1086
00:50:52,428 --> 00:50:54,429
But a lot of times they don't, at least they don't rigorously.

1087
00:50:54,849 --> 00:50:57,430
But I kind of want that, so, when I see.

1088
00:50:58,557 --> 00:51:00,979
stuff that looks like it had no restraints on it, right?

1089
00:51:01,299 --> 00:51:03,461
A design that I can just tell.

1090
00:51:04,201 --> 00:51:08,605
He's got like 45 wings, and like eagle eyes, and tentacles, and like...

1091
00:51:09,005 --> 00:51:12,388
When I see that, I'm like, this person, even if they rendered it well,

1092
00:51:13,509 --> 00:51:15,530
they never had a design problem to solve.

1093
00:51:15,831 --> 00:51:16,651
They're not a designer.

1094
00:51:17,272 --> 00:51:19,493
And you look, you see whole portfolios full of stuff like that.

1095
00:51:20,354 --> 00:51:21,255
You say ten minutes to me?

1096
00:51:21,895 --> 00:51:22,796
OK. Cool.

1097
00:51:24,942 --> 00:51:28,264
And that's the difference between a designer and a concept artist.

1098
00:51:28,904 --> 00:51:31,066
So I'd say, oh, and one more thing about this corral.

1099
00:51:32,747 --> 00:51:36,730
My job sometimes with the client is to help build the corral.

1100
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:38,271
So here's another kind of client you might get.

1101
00:51:39,592 --> 00:51:42,714
We've all had these kinds before, and I've been on both sides of it.

1102
00:51:43,654 --> 00:51:46,096
They're like, this is the corral that we know about.

1103
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,399
And you're like, OK, well.

1104
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:52,783
Is he mean?

1105
00:51:52,963 --> 00:51:53,705
And they're like, yes.

1106
00:51:53,725 --> 00:51:54,507
You're like, cool.

1107
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:56,412
Is he smart?

1108
00:51:56,633 --> 00:51:57,054
Yes.

1109
00:51:57,074 --> 00:51:58,719
Is he badass?

1110
00:51:58,879 --> 00:51:59,440
Of course.

1111
00:52:00,515 --> 00:52:02,136
So you help to build with them.

1112
00:52:02,196 --> 00:52:03,837
So if you have a corral, for example,

1113
00:52:04,118 --> 00:52:05,518
an art director gives you a brief that's kind of,

1114
00:52:05,999 --> 00:52:07,199
maybe you don't know fully what it is,

1115
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,420
it's good to ask questions.

1116
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,181
It's hard, because it's your boss, you know?

1117
00:52:10,682 --> 00:52:11,582
And sometimes they might get annoyed.

1118
00:52:11,602 --> 00:52:12,643
They'll be like, I don't know what it is.

1119
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:13,443
I don't know.

1120
00:52:13,863 --> 00:52:15,024
And you're like, you don't have to know.

1121
00:52:15,104 --> 00:52:17,726
I'm just trying to find out as much as I can.

1122
00:52:18,026 --> 00:52:19,987
And whatever you don't tell me, I'll make it up.

1123
00:52:20,507 --> 00:52:21,848
Okay, so maybe this isn't decided.

1124
00:52:21,928 --> 00:52:22,829
Okay, well then I decided.

1125
00:52:23,567 --> 00:52:24,947
Your job is to solve as much as you can.

1126
00:52:24,987 --> 00:52:26,428
So even if they don't know the parameters,

1127
00:52:26,868 --> 00:52:28,488
you help them come up with the parameters.

1128
00:52:28,989 --> 00:52:30,829
Because you have a passion for it.

1129
00:52:30,869 --> 00:52:32,670
You heard what the initial idea was,

1130
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,391
and you have things you want to add to it.

1131
00:52:40,653 --> 00:52:42,574
Last thing, I just wanted to show some sketches

1132
00:52:42,614 --> 00:52:44,134
for that robot thing, because they're just cool.

1133
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:46,255
Look at that. It comes up like a rooster.

1134
00:52:48,709 --> 00:52:51,650
I just thought it was so bad. It was badass because it's not badass.

1135
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,031
It's almost more scary, like, that this thing would shoot lasers at you and kill you.

1136
00:52:55,491 --> 00:52:57,991
Because it's not trying to be tough, it's designed just to murder.

1137
00:52:58,951 --> 00:53:01,852
You can tell. Because no one who was trying to make it cool

1138
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:05,193
would design it to look that stupid. So it's more scary to me.

1139
00:53:10,294 --> 00:53:13,454
Okie doke. Alright, well, I'll stop there and give some

1140
00:53:13,474 --> 00:53:14,515
time for questions. Thank you guys.

1141
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:28,720
By the way, awesome, fantastic, thank you.

1142
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,320
You're welcome.

1143
00:53:30,161 --> 00:53:33,222
About that corral you were saying, you said, oh man,

1144
00:53:33,242 --> 00:53:34,703
yeah, this guy, is he awesome?

1145
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,243
Yeah, is he badass?

1146
00:53:36,643 --> 00:53:37,564
OK, is he nice?

1147
00:53:38,804 --> 00:53:41,265
He's nice, but what if the client goes, yeah, he's nice,

1148
00:53:41,906 --> 00:53:42,506
and he's mean?

1149
00:53:43,306 --> 00:53:45,487
Oh, he's both at the same time?

1150
00:53:45,867 --> 00:53:48,628
Or he's a family man, and yet he's not.

1151
00:53:49,271 --> 00:53:51,733
Yeah, you do get a lot of those and if they don't give you enough direction

1152
00:53:51,753 --> 00:53:55,416
They're gonna come up with they're gonna get a generic design

1153
00:53:55,576 --> 00:53:59,719
And like I swear they were all

1154
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,082
I think that's the hardest thing to do anything cool

1155
00:54:03,222 --> 00:54:07,645
Then you know what your only metric short of a story is cool and awesome

1156
00:54:08,005 --> 00:54:08,766
Yeah

1157
00:54:08,806 --> 00:54:12,689
So so so many things in games are cool and awesome in lieu of a story

1158
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:16,232
The only way you can make it unique like an oblivion the guy had a New York Yankees hat

1159
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:18,653
Right and it looked cool

1160
00:54:19,174 --> 00:54:21,836
But can you imagine doing a video game character with a New York Yankees hat?

1161
00:54:22,236 --> 00:54:24,357
People would be like, that was a future space marine?

1162
00:54:24,837 --> 00:54:26,659
You'd be like, what the hell are you even talking about?

1163
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:28,059
That's, you're a crazy person.

1164
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:31,882
The artist needed the story to come up with that unique visual thing.

1165
00:54:31,962 --> 00:54:34,323
So if they don't give you a story, then they're gonna get something badass.

1166
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:36,404
So I would fall back on badass.

1167
00:54:37,243 --> 00:54:41,926
as a default and then if they allow you to go better than badass and more better than cool and

1168
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:47,889
awesome then cool. It was a good experience. We basically got to do whatever we wanted

1169
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:52,232
though basically but I was more going to ask you if you had an experience with a client

1170
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:58,195
in any of your paintings that had that and how that went for you. All the time yeah and then

1171
00:54:58,215 --> 00:55:02,178
we just default to badass. Yeah okay. And I get bummed out. I'm not bummed out. I'm like it's

1172
00:55:02,238 --> 00:55:04,079
going to look good but it just won't be unique.

1173
00:55:05,142 --> 00:55:05,282
Hi.

1174
00:55:06,423 --> 00:55:09,105
Can I just say really quickly that I'm really glad that this lecture went the way that it

1175
00:55:09,145 --> 00:55:13,308
did considering the title, because I'm an art student graduate who just graduated a

1176
00:55:13,348 --> 00:55:13,989
few months ago.

1177
00:55:14,029 --> 00:55:15,390
This is my first time at GDC.

1178
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:15,791
Oh, nice.

1179
00:55:15,811 --> 00:55:15,991
Congrats.

1180
00:55:16,011 --> 00:55:20,074
And so to show up here and to see that Shadi Safadi is hosting a lecture called Concept

1181
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:20,755
Art is Dead.

1182
00:55:21,215 --> 00:55:21,615
Oh, no.

1183
00:55:21,635 --> 00:55:22,036
What happened?

1184
00:55:22,056 --> 00:55:22,416
I know.

1185
00:55:22,516 --> 00:55:23,477
I was just being a singular.

1186
00:55:23,497 --> 00:55:24,278
Where did it go?

1187
00:55:24,298 --> 00:55:24,898
I was bummed out.

1188
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:26,620
And then you dropped that bomb on the title.

1189
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,143
No, I spent the past four hours since I got here at noon just like having on the verge

1190
00:55:30,163 --> 00:55:30,763
of a heart attack.

1191
00:55:30,943 --> 00:55:31,504
Oh, my God.

1192
00:55:31,544 --> 00:55:32,725
Do I have to be a telemarketer now?

1193
00:55:33,686 --> 00:55:38,991
Anyways, you mentioned at the beginning of your lecture, there was a gentleman who his

1194
00:55:39,092 --> 00:55:42,155
art improved drastically over the guidance of your studio.

1195
00:55:42,235 --> 00:55:42,956
John Sweeney, yeah.

1196
00:55:43,036 --> 00:55:43,256
Yeah.

1197
00:55:43,276 --> 00:55:48,181
Do you know how another young aspiring concept artist might find the same sort of mentorship?

1198
00:55:48,457 --> 00:55:50,898
Yeah, he had Eitan. So you had to make friends with the right people.

1199
00:55:51,418 --> 00:55:52,219
Okay, fantastic.

1200
00:55:52,259 --> 00:55:55,301
No, I mean honestly, like if you have a team of people, Eitan started in school.

1201
00:55:55,341 --> 00:55:59,323
He got picked by Rob, who did a talk earlier, out of school because he was talented, super talented.

1202
00:55:59,863 --> 00:56:04,886
So his portfolio was awesome. But in Otis, where he went to school, he had a team of like four other guys,

1203
00:56:05,227 --> 00:56:10,410
and they would all, forget the teachers, they would all work with each other, and they would one-up each other, one-up each other.

1204
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:10,690
Nice.

1205
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:15,733
And they all had a really positive attitude. Like, I don't know about you, but when I was in school, I did not have a good attitude.

1206
00:56:16,033 --> 00:56:17,714
Like, every other artist was a threat to me.

1207
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:20,810
So I was just a bad person.

1208
00:56:21,331 --> 00:56:24,954
So it wasn't until I decided, like, no, I'm going to be

1209
00:56:24,994 --> 00:56:27,297
inspired by other people's work instead of hate it.

1210
00:56:27,397 --> 00:56:27,997
Now, you can hate it.

1211
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:29,098
You can go through the cycles, right?

1212
00:56:29,138 --> 00:56:29,599
It's a cycle.

1213
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:31,340
You look at it, you're like, wow, and then you're like,

1214
00:56:31,461 --> 00:56:33,202
damn it, and then you're like, fuck you, and then you're

1215
00:56:33,222 --> 00:56:33,783
like, no.

1216
00:56:34,383 --> 00:56:35,184
It's like this thing.

1217
00:56:35,504 --> 00:56:37,747
But as long as you end up at, what can I learn from this

1218
00:56:37,787 --> 00:56:39,488
person, then you've traveled the full path.

1219
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:40,369
Right.

1220
00:56:40,729 --> 00:56:40,809
OK.

1221
00:56:41,782 --> 00:56:43,202
But find a team of friends, yeah.

1222
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:45,522
Or online, I've seen a lot of people on Facebook.

1223
00:56:45,742 --> 00:56:47,323
I've hired half my company from Facebook.

1224
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:50,303
So I see their art and I'm like, that's really good.

1225
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:51,504
Do you wanna try this job out?

1226
00:56:51,764 --> 00:56:53,144
I give them a test job to try out.

1227
00:56:53,604 --> 00:56:55,864
No art test, no nothing, just do this job.

1228
00:56:56,145 --> 00:56:57,165
Because now we're both invested.

1229
00:56:57,625 --> 00:56:59,585
Try it out and see if you can get there.

1230
00:56:59,605 --> 00:57:01,466
And I've had people that have sent me stuff

1231
00:57:01,506 --> 00:57:03,486
over the course of two years on Facebook

1232
00:57:03,566 --> 00:57:04,946
and then finally they just get good enough.

1233
00:57:05,526 --> 00:57:06,667
And I start giving them jobs.

1234
00:57:07,307 --> 00:57:08,747
Fantastic, okay, thank you.

1235
00:57:08,887 --> 00:57:09,407
Yeah, you're welcome.

1236
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:12,868
That's it?

1237
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:14,130
Cool.

1238
00:57:15,272 --> 00:57:15,473
Good.

1239
00:57:16,254 --> 00:57:17,676
You have to go to the mic they told me to tell you.

1240
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,522
They only gave me one rule, they have to go to the mic.

1241
00:57:22,965 --> 00:57:23,506
Yeah, that's cool.

1242
00:57:24,427 --> 00:57:24,768
So far.

1243
00:57:33,269 --> 00:57:36,291
What led you to concept art more than art in general?

1244
00:57:36,351 --> 00:57:40,372
Like, art can be something that gives more expression,

1245
00:57:41,093 --> 00:57:43,394
if it's more cartoonish or more...

1246
00:57:43,954 --> 00:57:47,556
I'm not sure how to explain myself, but you're going for really realistic things,

1247
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:51,297
and what pushed you to that more than something else?

1248
00:57:51,977 --> 00:57:52,958
Oh, like if you're saying...

1249
00:57:54,979 --> 00:57:56,619
You're asking if it wasn't so realistic,

1250
00:57:56,659 --> 00:57:58,420
if you're doing a style that wasn't as realistic.

1251
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:58,840
Yeah.

1252
00:57:59,361 --> 00:58:01,421
Well, actually, I never got to it, but I wanted to show this.

1253
00:58:02,335 --> 00:58:05,738
This was a much more stylized thing that we worked on.

1254
00:58:09,301 --> 00:58:11,342
And it was for Spark, and they gave us this sketch.

1255
00:58:12,623 --> 00:58:15,425
And after we had the sketch, and we were supposed to kind of flesh it out,

1256
00:58:15,485 --> 00:58:16,886
they gave us this very cartoony sketch.

1257
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:19,969
Even after we had the sketch already done,

1258
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:21,570
we still built it in 3D,

1259
00:58:22,451 --> 00:58:24,132
and then rendered it after we built the 3D.

1260
00:58:24,712 --> 00:58:28,275
So the technical stuff, I think, still comes into play no matter what.

1261
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:31,057
And we have, like, for example, a more realistic...

1262
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:33,545
Let's say stylized section on our website.

1263
00:58:33,985 --> 00:58:35,847
And I'm actually trying to get our studio more

1264
00:58:35,867 --> 00:58:36,828
into stylized work.

1265
00:58:37,629 --> 00:58:39,050
But we're known for realistic stuff.

1266
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:41,812
But we have more stylized stuff.

1267
00:58:41,892 --> 00:58:45,135
And for that, maybe not all the techniques apply.

1268
00:58:45,235 --> 00:58:46,937
Like maybe this one wasn't done in 3D.

1269
00:58:46,997 --> 00:58:49,399
This one was like hand drawn and then.

1270
00:58:49,973 --> 00:58:54,475
filled in like you know each color was filled in as a flat color and then it was slowly rendered

1271
00:58:54,515 --> 00:59:00,418
and shaded by hand. It was kind of a little more traditional. But what's crazy is this more

1272
00:59:00,518 --> 00:59:06,620
artistic stuff that takes more art skill is way harder I think, way harder. And part of the reason

1273
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,182
that I think our company's moved towards realistic is because it's easier to cheat. For this you need

1274
00:59:11,322 --> 00:59:13,683
real drawing skill and real drawing skill.

1275
00:59:14,412 --> 00:59:18,957
that you must have for this is more rare than it is someone you can train to like

1276
00:59:19,518 --> 00:59:22,862
kitbash something together. Now everything has its place but I think if you really

1277
00:59:22,902 --> 00:59:26,807
like hand drawing and you really like cartoony stuff for the drawing and

1278
00:59:26,827 --> 00:59:30,532
design part everything traditional is perfect. Then for the rendering...

1279
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:35,781
part, maybe sometimes 3D. The shape design stuff like here in the environment still apply,

1280
00:59:35,801 --> 00:59:41,504
exactly the same. Color stuff theory still applies. This started from a photo. You can

1281
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:45,405
see right here if you click on there, it started from a photo. So I didn't even make this up.

1282
00:59:45,885 --> 00:59:50,407
And you can see some of the steps from like photo to kind of more cell shaded,

1283
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:55,790
but going off the photo and then rendering it out a little bit more one step at a time.

1284
00:59:56,759 --> 01:00:02,063
Because for characters, you talk about taking photos of actual people to have like exact

1285
01:00:02,123 --> 01:00:04,225
poses that gives better expressions.

1286
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:08,209
You know, most of the time, like for example, I'm just trying to say if you have someone

1287
01:00:08,249 --> 01:00:11,792
who if they said design an animated feature character, that wouldn't work.

1288
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:13,754
So part of the challenge is like.

1289
01:00:14,247 --> 01:00:20,832
for me and for my guys is being like of this card deck of awesome tricks which one can I use now?

1290
01:00:21,092 --> 01:00:24,215
Maybe none of them. If you use the wrong one it won't work at all. You're saying for like a

1291
01:00:24,255 --> 01:00:28,978
cartoony animated feature it's annoying because you can't use any of them because all you need

1292
01:00:29,018 --> 01:00:33,222
is drawing ability. Like none of these things really apply, right? And that's really that's

1293
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:38,486
why it's I have we have one artist that's like amazing at animated style stuff but she's really

1294
01:00:38,526 --> 01:00:38,706
rare.

1295
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:44,793
So yeah, I would say if you like drawing and designing cartoony characters, keep doing that.

1296
01:00:45,193 --> 01:00:47,795
Once you start getting into the rendering of them, then you might use some cheats.

1297
01:00:48,115 --> 01:00:51,197
So what kind of advice would you give for more cartoony style?

1298
01:00:51,517 --> 01:00:55,840
Like to improve like that person you showed, who improved in like three months really well?

1299
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,321
Oh, like how to improve in your cartoony drawing style?

1300
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:00,062
I don't know.

1301
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:04,491
because that's really tough.

1302
01:01:04,731 --> 01:01:06,012
And actually, I don't know enough

1303
01:01:06,252 --> 01:01:07,513
about how to do it well myself.

1304
01:01:08,694 --> 01:01:10,815
But I did take a class with a guy named David Coleman.

1305
01:01:11,595 --> 01:01:12,276
David Coleman.

1306
01:01:12,596 --> 01:01:14,918
He's an animator at Paramount.

1307
01:01:15,518 --> 01:01:17,799
And I took a class at the Concept Design Academy

1308
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:19,100
here in LA.

1309
01:01:19,961 --> 01:01:21,061
No, we're in San Francisco.

1310
01:01:22,302 --> 01:01:25,524
In LA, Concept Design Academy has outstanding classes.

1311
01:01:26,205 --> 01:01:28,826
And he taught me everything that I currently know.

1312
01:01:29,146 --> 01:01:30,867
I hadn't been in school, obviously, in a long time.

1313
01:01:31,168 --> 01:01:32,368
But I did a lot of these characters.

1314
01:01:33,699 --> 01:01:35,380
these cartoony things in his class,

1315
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,800
because he taught me a lot of things

1316
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,961
about shape design and stuff.

1317
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:39,802
Okay, well thank you.

1318
01:01:39,822 --> 01:01:40,002
Sure.

1319
01:01:40,702 --> 01:01:43,123
He's got online, he's got DVDs.

1320
01:01:44,404 --> 01:01:45,244
Look him up, David Coleman.

1321
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:54,607
Hi, well I should say to start off to contextualize this a little bit, I'm a producer and I'm

1322
01:01:54,667 --> 01:01:59,969
regularly told I've got the artistic acumen of a blancmange so I'm more than aware of

1323
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:02,950
I'm coming at it from a different angle to everybody else in the room and yeah I'm sorry

1324
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:03,890
that you all have to listen to me.

1325
01:02:06,491 --> 01:02:12,916
I worked, when I worked with Wizards of the Coast on the Magic the Gathering stuff, I worked with some really supremely talented concept dudes

1326
01:02:13,376 --> 01:02:20,160
and also they had their own concept people, but one of the problems I had was my internal guys, a couple of them specifically

1327
01:02:20,601 --> 01:02:23,403
and these were the kind of guys that had personalities, they knew their...

1328
01:02:23,783 --> 01:02:29,845
their shit, they would go skydiving and deep sea diving and water rafting and smoke coke off

1329
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:34,968
cisterns and whatever else but as soon as you put them in the room with the client you ask them to

1330
01:02:35,008 --> 01:02:40,810
take some notes they would start chewing their bottom lip, switch off and I end up as the

1331
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:46,352
producer, somebody who doesn't understand art particularly to that technical level trying to be

1332
01:02:47,866 --> 01:02:50,849
bridge between these two people and my question is do you have anybody on your

1333
01:02:50,869 --> 01:02:55,252
team who has those kind of communication issues where they switch off and what

1334
01:02:55,292 --> 01:03:00,136
tools do you use to get the client to communicate with them? Well in our case

1335
01:03:00,436 --> 01:03:03,679
none of them have to communicate with the client everything goes through me so

1336
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:07,903
my guys never talk to the client but I do have guys that I have the opposite

1337
01:03:07,923 --> 01:03:11,245
thing I have I have a lot of I have a handful of guys that are really quiet

1338
01:03:12,232 --> 01:03:13,693
You know, they have a really hard time opening up.

1339
01:03:14,193 --> 01:03:17,215
And so, are your artists that, the skydiving,

1340
01:03:17,255 --> 01:03:20,177
base jumping, superman artists, are they good?

1341
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:22,758
Yeah, well I'm told their stuff's good.

1342
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:23,418
Their stuff's good?

1343
01:03:23,698 --> 01:03:26,040
Yeah, I don't think they trust that, but yeah.

1344
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:28,401
That's awesome then, as long as they're really good.

1345
01:03:28,741 --> 01:03:30,902
Yeah, like I have, I always thought myself,

1346
01:03:30,922 --> 01:03:33,164
because I have a, you know, kind of I'm a loud personality,

1347
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,205
I always thought you had to kind of be a loud personality

1348
01:03:35,245 --> 01:03:35,825
to be good at art.

1349
01:03:36,589 --> 01:03:38,330
because that's part of how you see the world.

1350
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:40,031
Not true at all.

1351
01:03:40,671 --> 01:03:42,432
I have guys that have more passion

1352
01:03:42,492 --> 01:03:43,993
about every tiny little thing in art

1353
01:03:44,373 --> 01:03:46,875
who speak so softly

1354
01:03:47,035 --> 01:03:48,476
and barely utter a word

1355
01:03:48,536 --> 01:03:49,536
when you say anything to them.

1356
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:50,637
And I just decided,

1357
01:03:51,197 --> 01:03:52,978
okay, part of the value

1358
01:03:53,318 --> 01:03:55,059
of managing a team of people is that

1359
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,281
I constantly adapt my personality

1360
01:03:57,301 --> 01:03:58,081
to their personality.

1361
01:03:58,481 --> 01:03:59,262
So if they're slow,

1362
01:03:59,622 --> 01:04:00,642
when I call them on the phone

1363
01:04:01,183 --> 01:04:02,163
to ask them what the thing is,

1364
01:04:02,263 --> 01:04:03,244
I just hold it up and I go,

1365
01:04:03,764 --> 01:04:04,965
hey dude, how's that piece coming?

1366
01:04:04,985 --> 01:04:05,765
And this is what they say.

1367
01:04:08,176 --> 01:04:08,456
Good.

1368
01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:14,360
And I take a deep breath, I sit in a chair before I call them and I know, okay, this

1369
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,122
is going to go a lot slower than the way I speak.

1370
01:04:17,623 --> 01:04:18,964
And I kind of cater myself to them.

1371
01:04:19,764 --> 01:04:24,608
Because I think that's valuable and because for them, that's kind of part of the personality

1372
01:04:24,628 --> 01:04:25,008
of the job.

1373
01:04:25,048 --> 01:04:26,789
And from watching House of Cards, I learned a lot, right?

1374
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:28,871
You learned a lot from that show.

1375
01:04:28,891 --> 01:04:29,971
What I do with people.

1376
01:04:30,011 --> 01:04:30,372
Thank you.

1377
01:04:30,572 --> 01:04:30,952
You're welcome.

1378
01:04:33,779 --> 01:04:37,721
Guys, I brought a ton of business cards if you want to get in touch with me for anything.

1379
01:04:38,021 --> 01:04:39,102
There's just a stack of them.

1380
01:04:39,222 --> 01:04:43,584
Take whatever you want because I brought them just to be taken and I'll hang out for whatever.

1381
01:04:43,904 --> 01:04:47,426
I'll talk to everybody for a few minutes like if we're going to talk after, for a few minutes

1382
01:04:47,446 --> 01:04:49,987
and then go on to the next person because I know how it is when you're waiting to talk

1383
01:04:50,007 --> 01:04:52,368
to someone for like 40 minutes and they're talking to one person forever.

1384
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,048
You know what I'm saying?

1385
01:04:53,408 --> 01:04:54,749
So I'll try to keep it quick.

1386
01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:55,690
So I'm not interrupting you.

1387
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:56,930
I'll just talk and then we'll just keep moving.

1388
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:58,851
And if you want to stick around, we'll keep talking.

1389
01:04:59,551 --> 01:04:59,832
Got it?

1390
01:05:00,612 --> 01:05:01,012
Thanks guys.
