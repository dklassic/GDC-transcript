00:00:06,117 --> 00:00:09,415
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Chris Hecker.

2
00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:23,842
Welcome. So, one of my favorite things about Will Wright, besides the fact that he's fucking brilliant,

3
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:31,285
is that he's so approachable and how humble and mellow he is, even in the face of his obvious popularity.

4
00:00:31,285 --> 00:00:35,207
And so he doesn't want to be in this room, for example. Like, he has no interest in being a keynote.

5
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:39,609
He just wants to come to the GDC and share information. And every year, we put him in a bigger room.

6
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:42,546
And then it fills up and people complain.

7
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:43,967
And then we put him in a bigger room,

8
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:45,489
and then it fills up and people complain.

9
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:47,451
And so next year, I think we're going to have to get, like,

10
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:49,092
the Oakland Coliseum or something.

11
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:50,914
It's not exactly clear what to do here.

12
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:52,836
But even in the face of all that,

13
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:55,078
he still is all about just sharing information

14
00:00:55,078 --> 00:00:57,180
and being really approachable and being really cool

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,802
about just, like, the free flow of information.

16
00:00:58,802 --> 00:01:00,584
So help me welcome Will Wright.

17
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:15,862
Hi, everybody.

18
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:17,544
Let me go to my PowerPoint here.

19
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,867
Okay.

20
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:26,752
So, every year, they kind of ask me to come give a talk.

21
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:29,595
And every year, they kind of then ask me what my talk is about,

22
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:31,597
and I procrastinate.

23
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:33,899
And so they just assign a title to my talk.

24
00:01:35,803 --> 00:01:39,204
Oh, by the way, the images that you might have seen coming in

25
00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:42,625
were all from the Hubble, you know, which, and the Hubble I love.

26
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,045
It's like one of these things that appeals equally

27
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:45,285
to the scientist and the artist, you know,

28
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:47,706
and there are very few tools of humanity

29
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:50,226
that I think kind of have that amazing balance both ways.

30
00:01:50,226 --> 00:01:53,207
But at any rate, so this is not the title of my talk at all.

31
00:01:53,207 --> 00:01:53,267
Um...

32
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:58,348
In fact, I mean, people are always saying,

33
00:01:58,348 --> 00:02:00,809
oh, come give a talk at our school or at this or that

34
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:01,789
about game design.

35
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,429
And so I talk about game design and game design and game design.

36
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:06,926
I'm kind of sick of talking about game design, actually.

37
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:12,408
So I thought I would talk about something quite different here today instead.

38
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:21,749
But then about a month ago, I saw Jamil that runs the conference, and he said,

39
00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:23,950
oh, by the way, we made you the game design keynote.

40
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,430
And I thought, uh-oh.

41
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,431
This isn't about game design at all, and I'm the keynote.

42
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:31,592
So I kind of scratched that plan.

43
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:34,862
So I kind of reworked it a bit and thought, you know,

44
00:02:34,862 --> 00:02:37,204
well, you know what I really enjoy is, you know,

45
00:02:37,204 --> 00:02:39,385
the obsessive research stuff that I get into

46
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:41,726
when I just really get fascinated with a subject

47
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:43,767
and then kind of want to turn it into a game.

48
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:47,729
So I kind of reworked the thing into this.

49
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:50,991
Uh, you know, for me, you know, I start a game idea,

50
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:53,072
and usually there's this concept at the beginning,

51
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,553
something that sparks an idea.

52
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:55,894
Then I go out and do a lot of research,

53
00:02:55,894 --> 00:02:56,714
get really involved in it.

54
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,693
Then, of course, you know, kind of the standard modes of, you know, pre-production, production,

55
00:03:01,693 --> 00:03:06,475
testing, marketing. It seems to me at GDC that we cover these last four sections pretty

56
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:11,238
well, you know, with the topics that are covered at GDC. But I've seen very little stuff kind

57
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:14,820
of done in the very early phases, you know, the research phase of how you start with the

58
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,382
very core of an idea, usually one person kind of doing background research and doing the

59
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:22,104
very early formulation of that idea. And that's really my favorite part. That's the part I

60
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:26,606
enjoy the most by far. So, you know, it's kind of tinkering around in your lab.

61
00:03:27,023 --> 00:03:32,006
doing stuff. So, I started thinking about, okay, what can I say about game research?

62
00:03:32,006 --> 00:03:34,687
But then, you know, I had this nagging thing where I really still wanted to talk about

63
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:40,390
this other thing, you know? And I thought, well, okay, maybe I'll just do both of them,

64
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,472
you know? What should I do first, though? Do I do the game research, Astro, you know?

65
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:47,394
It felt kind of weird to have, like, half a talk and then another half a talk. So I

66
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:52,517
decided I would actually interleave the two for maximum confusion. So...

67
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:55,058
We're going to be going back and forth a bit here.

68
00:03:55,058 --> 00:03:58,239
In some sense, you know, one is an example of the other.

69
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,280
So, starting on the research side.

70
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,941
Typically, you know, when I start researching an idea,

71
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,542
it involves talking to people,

72
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:09,342
going out and interviewing experts in the field,

73
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:10,783
reading a lot of books,

74
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,304
searching the web for whatever I can find.

75
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:16,825
Books really seem to be my primary inspiration.

76
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:18,726
Most of the games I've done, you know,

77
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:21,707
were kind of directly inspired by one particular book I read

78
00:04:21,707 --> 00:04:23,287
that got me interested in that subject.

79
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:28,600
And it's not like the entire game was really, it's not like the blueprint for the game or anything.

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,403
It's actually more like that book will kind of spark additional interests.

81
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:32,764
And I'll start reading other things.

82
00:04:32,764 --> 00:04:36,468
And it'll start pulling me off in these different directions that I find interesting.

83
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:39,991
As I'm, at the same time, kind of formulating what this thing might become in my mind as a game.

84
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:42,113
And then later we kind of bring the prototyping.

85
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:45,436
Um, the Japanese have this great term called otaku.

86
00:04:45,436 --> 00:04:48,319
Uh, how many of you have heard this before?

87
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:48,640
Um, yeah.

88
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:58,766
It kind of usually refers to a 14-year-old, you know, kind of socially dysfunctional guy who collects little anime dolls.

89
00:04:58,766 --> 00:04:59,988
It's rather derogatory.

90
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:05,074
But, you know, I kind of embraced that philosophy, you know, in the early stages.

91
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:08,936
When I get interested in a subject, you know, I just get, you know, obsessed with it.

92
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:12,339
And I'll speak to everybody I can about it and tell them how cool it is.

93
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:15,141
And in some sense, that's my very early stage of prototyping.

94
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:17,143
How can I take that idea of that subject?

95
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:20,305
Why do I find this cool and how can I communicate that to others?

96
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:22,126
And I'm doing that all the time from the very early stages.

97
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:25,669
Last year, I came here and talked about Spore a little bit.

98
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:27,650
Kind of, you know, where that was going, you know.

99
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:31,599
how the content battle that we were fighting in game development

100
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:32,859
seemed like a losing battle to me.

101
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:35,780
And because of that, it kind of drove me to generative systems.

102
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,161
The project I was working on just before that was The Sims Online.

103
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:43,482
And, you know, we basically had to fight a lot of those battles.

104
00:05:43,482 --> 00:05:46,542
It kind of brought me to the idea of Spore.

105
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:49,083
This is roughly the development team for The Sims Online.

106
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,663
It was about 140 people, the largest project I had ever worked on.

107
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:54,725
And there was just a huge amount of inertia.

108
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:57,807
You know, not just with, like, the server client issues,

109
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:58,808
but the design issues.

110
00:05:58,808 --> 00:05:59,949
A lot of content we had to bring in.

111
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:01,830
A lot of content that had to be reworked from the Sims.

112
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,272
And once we got it working, you know,

113
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:05,333
in a multiplayer environment,

114
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,654
there were a lot of things that were fundamentally different

115
00:06:07,654 --> 00:06:10,096
than the Sims that kind of broke the Sims idea.

116
00:06:10,096 --> 00:06:12,078
First of all, we couldn't control time.

117
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:13,178
And if you, you know, when I played the Sims,

118
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:14,339
I always had one hand on the speed control,

119
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,661
and you always speed through the boring parts.

120
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:18,782
And when all of a sudden you're stuck in real time in the Sims,

121
00:06:18,782 --> 00:06:20,263
it is a pretty boring game.

122
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:23,041
Custom content, which was one of the big, you know,

123
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,463
kind of leverages of success we had for the Sims offline.

124
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:28,545
You know, we had aspirations for the Sims Online to have that,

125
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:29,766
but it was just unmanageable.

126
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:31,968
The amount of bandwidth, the size of the data, in fact,

127
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:34,050
you know, made it hard for us to kind of bring that in

128
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,911
effectively into the Sims Online.

129
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:37,853
And we find that it's like 60% of the players

130
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:38,833
playing the Sims use cheats.

131
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,415
You know, they'll play it as a game part of the time,

132
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:43,657
and they'll use cheats and play it kind of as a dollhouse,

133
00:06:43,657 --> 00:06:45,979
freeform, design your mansion the other time.

134
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:47,761
And of course, you can't have that in a multiplayer game.

135
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:51,345
Instead, you have to have these incredibly tall advancement ladders,

136
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,388
um, you know, spanning these different ranges of skills.

137
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:56,852
Now, meanwhile, while we were building The Sims Online,

138
00:06:56,852 --> 00:06:58,554
actually, around the same time, over in Germany,

139
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:00,116
they were building this thing.

140
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:02,199
So...

141
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:02,960
This thing is cool.

142
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,732
This is the Bagger 288, and it is immense.

143
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:08,433
It's actually a land vehicle.

144
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:10,575
It actually drives across doing mining in Germany.

145
00:07:10,575 --> 00:07:12,236
It's just got a billion treads.

146
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:14,977
It's about the size of kind of an oil platform.

147
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:19,080
There are actually these large veins of coal that run through Germany,

148
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,342
and there are actually two of these machines,

149
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:24,343
and they actually disassemble highways to let this thing by.

150
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:28,726
But just to give you a sense of the size of this thing,

151
00:07:28,726 --> 00:07:30,067
this is a Jawa sand crawler in comparison.

152
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,036
And the sand collar doesn't even exist.

153
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:43,503
But the reason I bring this up is this is basically

154
00:07:43,503 --> 00:07:45,205
kind of how The Sims Online felt to me.

155
00:07:45,205 --> 00:07:48,447
Um, basically I was driving this thing, right?

156
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:50,229
You know, and we'd make a design decision,

157
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:52,150
and two weeks later, what happened with that?

158
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,051
Oh, it's in process.

159
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:54,673
Oh, we got the server code working.

160
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:56,634
Now the client's, you know, getting in sync with it.

161
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:58,496
And maybe two months later, we might see this minor

162
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:01,819
little design decision actually trickle into the product.

163
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:03,180
Um, so when I left The Sims Online

164
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,921
and started Spore, it was basically kind of like

165
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:06,883
getting out of the driver's seat of that thing

166
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:07,543
into a Ferrari.

167
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:08,864
and zipping away.

168
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,607
I mean, we were doing prototyping, making design decisions,

169
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:13,989
and, you know, I was seeing progress hourly

170
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:15,010
rather than once every other month.

171
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:19,006
I was really reluctant to kind of grow S'more back in that same direction,

172
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:22,208
which drove me to this idea of, like, the procedural content and stuff.

173
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,330
So, but there are a lot of still cool things from The Sims

174
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,392
that, you know, I really kind of didn't want to lose

175
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:29,833
in the next project I worked on, you know,

176
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,035
primarily the idea that the players are surprising us,

177
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:35,117
that they are actually even going beyond what we think the box is

178
00:08:35,117 --> 00:08:36,798
that we're giving them to play in

179
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:39,540
and exceeding that box in weird and interesting ways.

180
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:39,700
Um...

181
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,863
And this gets to kind of the question of the abdication of authorship, you know.

182
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:48,297
you know, you know, kind of pour your heart into this thing

183
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:50,698
and you're gonna create this, you know, lovingly crafted world

184
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:53,199
and, you know, you have aspirations for that,

185
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,399
it has meaning, you know, that you want to convey.

186
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:57,080
And once you give it to the fans,

187
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:06,523
you just don't know what they're gonna do with it.

188
00:09:06,523 --> 00:09:06,883
So...

189
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:07,223
So...

190
00:09:07,223 --> 00:09:08,683
So...

191
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:08,863
So...

192
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,063
So...

193
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:09,463
So...

194
00:09:09,463 --> 00:09:09,663
So...

195
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:09,803
So...

196
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:10,264
So...

197
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:10,804
So...

198
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:11,024
So...

199
00:09:11,024 --> 00:09:11,204
So...

200
00:09:11,204 --> 00:09:11,344
So...

201
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:11,464
So...

202
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:11,684
So...

203
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:11,724
So...

204
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:11,784
So...

205
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,960
Came to the idea through my fascination with the SETI program.

206
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,001
And I talked about this a little bit last year,

207
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:19,581
kind of Drake's equation,

208
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:21,642
which led me to the science of astrobiology,

209
00:09:21,642 --> 00:09:23,823
which is the study of possible life in the universe.

210
00:09:23,823 --> 00:09:25,203
And it's, you know, an interesting subject

211
00:09:25,203 --> 00:09:26,384
because it only has one data point,

212
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:28,084
and that's life on Earth.

213
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:29,605
Everything else has to be inferred, you know.

214
00:09:29,605 --> 00:09:30,785
So everything we know about aliens,

215
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:32,706
we've basically imagined, you know, we've never seen.

216
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:38,018
One of the early concepts for Spore was that each one of these terms in Drake's equation,

217
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:42,238
you know, these are things like how many stars, how many planets, how many of those have life.

218
00:09:42,238 --> 00:09:46,159
One of the early concepts of the game is that the player would play a level to set those

219
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,740
sliders and then you would have the resulting galaxy to play in.

220
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,581
But it turns out that most of the combinations of those sliders are incredibly boring.

221
00:09:52,581 --> 00:09:56,242
So that didn't really feel like it was kind of going in the right direction.

222
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:58,383
Another kind of very early concept for Spore

223
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:01,286
was that it was kind of a greening the galaxy thing.

224
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:03,728
You were going around, you know, seeding and promoting life

225
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,950
throughout the galaxy, and then kind of seeing what arose

226
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,090
and then trying to nurture it.

227
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,433
This is actually, for the few people that read the book,

228
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:12,795
2001, that was the backstory for why the aliens

229
00:10:12,795 --> 00:10:13,696
were dropping monoliths on Earth,

230
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,538
is that they were actually trying to kind of farm mine

231
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:16,158
in the galaxy.

232
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:19,141
At the same time, there was, of course,

233
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:21,022
this powers of 10 idea kind of lurking in the background.

234
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,872
After doing a little bit more research, I found out that the powers of tenthing,

235
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:26,834
actually, the Eameses didn't do the first version of it.

236
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:31,238
The first version was actually done by a Dutch school teacher in the 50s named Kees Boelke.

237
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:32,739
And he got his students to draw the pictures.

238
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:37,182
And it was actually a remarkably cool book, although very weird in comparison to the Eameses.

239
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:40,184
He actually starts, like, with a little lady holding a baby in a chair.

240
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:42,546
And then as he zooms out, there's a whale,

241
00:10:42,546 --> 00:10:45,788
and she's in the middle of the street and cars are going by.

242
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:48,330
And I've been to Holland, and I didn't see that.

243
00:10:50,262 --> 00:10:52,044
But anyway, going back to Drake's for a second.

244
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:54,026
The really interesting term in here,

245
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:56,248
the one that we know probably the least about,

246
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:57,289
is the probability of life occurring.

247
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,671
What is the chance life can spontaneously arise somewhere?

248
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:02,954
So then that drove me down a totally different direction,

249
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:03,335
the origin of life.

250
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:05,417
And there are all these convoluted theories

251
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:08,059
about how life might have started.

252
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:10,882
They basically usually resolve down to this.

253
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:10,942
But...

254
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,011
Then we looked into it.

255
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:16,573
And this really was part of the powers of 10 thing.

256
00:11:16,573 --> 00:11:18,274
It was drawing us down into the microscopic world here.

257
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:21,077
And so I thought, okay, initially this is kind of a space thing.

258
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:22,618
Maybe it's a microscopic thing too.

259
00:11:22,618 --> 00:11:28,002
Now, a little bit of overview here.

260
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:31,705
14 million years ago, billion years ago, big bang, and here we are now.

261
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,612
The Earth remarkably formed about 4 billion years ago,

262
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:37,313
which is a significant fraction of the age of the known universe.

263
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:40,816
And the fact that the Earth has remained fairly stable over that period of time is pretty remarkable.

264
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:45,458
Another remarkable thing is that evidence of life on Earth was very soon after the Earth formed.

265
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,640
And they're still trying to refine that.

266
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,401
Every time they find an older one, it gets a little bit closer and a little bit closer

267
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:51,722
to the time when the Earth finally cooled off.

268
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:58,274
Now, we see that it took about 2 billion years for life to go from very primitive prokaryotic

269
00:11:58,274 --> 00:12:02,536
microbes to more advanced eukaryotic microbes, and another 1.5 billion years to get to what

270
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:08,339
we consider kind of macroscopic interesting life. So, it was about 3 billion years before

271
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:13,182
life, you know, got kind of large, multicellular. And it's only been that for about 500 million

272
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:14,022
years so far.

273
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:19,161
One of the early trips I took researching spore was to the Scripps Institute down in La Jolla

274
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:24,104
and met this guy, Stan Miller, who back in the 50s did the very first origin of life experiments

275
00:12:24,104 --> 00:12:28,026
where he would take these flasks, fill them with, like, you know, methane and spark them

276
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:29,086
and see what would come out of it.

277
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:32,048
You know, he was trying to recreate the early prebiotic atmosphere of the Earth

278
00:12:32,048 --> 00:12:34,129
and he actually was creating amino acids

279
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:37,951
and it was the first kind of idea that maybe this stuff could have arisen naturally, these chemicals.

280
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:41,153
One of my prized possessions is this that he gave me

281
00:12:41,153 --> 00:12:43,174
that he actually signs, it says Stan Miller.

282
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:44,955
It's like sitting on a shelf in my house.

283
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:47,057
Every now and then, somebody will come and say,

284
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,318
Oh, you should throw this out. It's ruined.

285
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:48,978
And I was like, No!

286
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:51,960
I also met David Brin down there,

287
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,262
who's one of my favorite science fiction authors.

288
00:12:54,262 --> 00:12:56,624
One of his best-known series is the Uplift series,

289
00:12:56,624 --> 00:12:58,645
which is a concept that we kind of, you know,

290
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,006
are bringing into Spore, where you can kind of

291
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:02,288
uplift unintelligent animals to intelligence.

292
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:05,170
In describing Spore to him, he basically said,

293
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,231
Oh, it sounds cool, but I want this game.

294
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:09,133
I want the game where I can change the fundamental

295
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:12,915
consonants of the universe and see what emerges.

296
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:12,995
And...

297
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:17,909
Aside from being kind of a difficult thing to do, even in comparison to Spore,

298
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:21,511
it turns out that most of those things, if you move them like 1% one way or the other,

299
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:23,432
the universe lasts about 5 nanoseconds or something.

300
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:27,374
So, that had the same problem where the combinations of sliders, you know,

301
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:30,456
it was a very narrow range where you had an interesting kind of play experience.

302
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:34,278
Diving a little bit deeper into the theories of the original life,

303
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:36,919
one of the leading candidates is this thing called autocatalytic sets,

304
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,621
which is roughly the chemistry over time will evolve.

305
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:44,676
more and more elaborate, you know, chemicals in a given environment.

306
00:13:44,676 --> 00:13:46,277
We actually did prototypes of this,

307
00:13:46,277 --> 00:13:47,918
and to be honest, it wasn't very compelling.

308
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:52,101
So we moved up a level to the cellular level

309
00:13:52,101 --> 00:13:55,124
and started looking into cellular processes and metabolism and stuff,

310
00:13:55,124 --> 00:13:57,365
and we did a pretty nice simulation of this,

311
00:13:57,365 --> 00:14:01,809
and again, you know, it just wasn't going to kind of reach the same numbers as the Sims,

312
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:04,691
I thought.

313
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:04,731
So...

314
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:08,298
Another kind of intriguing theory is the pan-spermy theory,

315
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:12,342
which is the fact that maybe life didn't start on Earth at all,

316
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:14,063
but in fact came here from somewhere else,

317
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:16,305
maybe an asteroid or a comet,

318
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:17,346
landed on Earth.

319
00:14:17,346 --> 00:14:19,688
This is a rock we found, LH 84001.

320
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:25,377
came from Mars, and we know that, you know, pretty well just by analyzing the chemical composition of it.

321
00:14:25,377 --> 00:14:29,299
And we found these little weird things on there that, you know, we've never seen before

322
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:32,841
that looked like they could be, you know, maybe fossils of living organisms.

323
00:14:32,841 --> 00:14:35,483
The jury's still out on that. They probably aren't because they're so small.

324
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:39,585
But still, the idea that material could have traveled from Mars to the Earth is pretty well known at this point.

325
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:43,107
And there's a surprising amount of material, like when an asteroid hits the Earth,

326
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:45,568
all little pieces of the Earth go out into orbit around the sun.

327
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:48,590
Some of them will fall back in other planets, like Mars, for instance.

328
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,752
And so there's this idea of planetary crosstalk,

329
00:14:50,752 --> 00:14:53,294
that if there is life in a planetary system,

330
00:14:53,294 --> 00:14:55,536
chances are it will spread to other nearby planets,

331
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:57,598
because it's a matter of tons per year

332
00:14:57,598 --> 00:15:00,140
that will fall, like in the early stages of this.

333
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,202
So there's a huge amount of crosstalk happening between the planets.

334
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:05,364
And not only that, but it's looking more and more probable

335
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:08,006
that there's the possibility of interstellar crosstalk,

336
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:10,749
which is some of this material could actually travel to another star,

337
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:15,493
because some of these bacteria can last for millions of years in a desiccated form,

338
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:17,074
and they're very radiation resistant.

339
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:19,494
So, we'll get back to this a little bit later.

340
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:23,098
There's actually, now what I'm talking about so far is undirected panspermia.

341
00:15:23,098 --> 00:15:25,300
There's this other idea of directed panspermia,

342
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,023
and in fact a society I found that is promoting this,

343
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:30,545
that let's start sending spores out into space

344
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:33,789
and, you know, five million years from now they might land somewhere

345
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:35,351
and start, you know, growing on another planet.

346
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,754
And it's cool that people think that far ahead, you know.

347
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:39,815
Okay, back to the research side.

348
00:15:41,678 --> 00:15:42,839
Um, one thing that I have to confront a lot,

349
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,060
especially in the early stages, is, you know,

350
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,601
where I fall kind of on the fact versus fiction side of things.

351
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:50,423
Um, frequently, we simulate things

352
00:15:50,423 --> 00:15:53,665
not the way they would occur, but the way people would expect them to occur,

353
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:54,785
or, you know, for entertainment value.

354
00:15:54,785 --> 00:15:58,287
In SimCity, when a nuclear power plant, um, catches on fire,

355
00:15:58,287 --> 00:15:59,428
you know, it just goes nuclear.

356
00:15:59,428 --> 00:16:02,369
You know, it just blows up in this big crater where it used to be.

357
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:04,570
And, of course, nuclear reactors don't really do that.

358
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,811
But, you know, a lot of times in games,

359
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:07,952
we will purposely basically break reality

360
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:08,813
for the player expectation.

361
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:10,863
I'm not against that at all.

362
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:14,546
In fact, I think, you know, fiction is a very interesting way to kind of approach reality.

363
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:18,068
One thing that Rod Sterling said when he was doing the Twilight Zone,

364
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:21,690
he said that was the only place in television where he could do real issues.

365
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,612
And this is back in the late 50s when he started the Twilight Zone.

366
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:28,675
And he could actually do things about gender equality or racial issues.

367
00:16:28,975 --> 00:16:31,416
by making, you know, one guy an alien and one guy an earthling.

368
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,858
Where at that time on TV, if they tried to deal with these racial issues

369
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:36,240
with blacks and whites, they would never get it on the air.

370
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,421
So it was a way for him to get a message out there

371
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:40,242
that at the time was very hard to get out.

372
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:42,724
As far back as Mary Shelley writing Frankenstein,

373
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:45,986
you know, she had a very deep message embedded in this work of fiction,

374
00:16:45,986 --> 00:16:47,807
you know, that she was hoping to have some impact on society.

375
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:51,690
So really, you know, in some sense, I wanted to interact

376
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,032
with lots of interesting aliens in this game.

377
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:57,499
And the idea of having to deal with protein folding and cellular metabolism

378
00:16:57,499 --> 00:16:59,260
was kind of a little bit at odds with that.

379
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,041
And, you know, you'll see a little bit later

380
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,782
kind of how we fell on the side of the fence,

381
00:17:02,782 --> 00:17:05,523
you know, which side of the fence we fell on different issues.

382
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:08,225
A lot of times in research, you know, we'll start doing prototypes.

383
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:11,586
I don't know if any of you all saw the excellent prototyping talk this morning

384
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:12,767
by Hayim and Chris.

385
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:14,148
Yeah, it was a great talk.

386
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,950
And as I was mentioning, you know, we do a lot of simulation prototypes.

387
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,151
You know, the very best ones, we will actually kind of bring

388
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:21,471
to more extensive gameplay prototypes.

389
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:24,211
Originally, we were just simulating dynamics of a simple system,

390
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,792
but then we'll start adding user interaction.

391
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:29,472
And is this fun, you know, to manipulate and kind of interact with?

392
00:17:29,472 --> 00:17:32,453
A lot of times, we will kind of iterate those prototypes.

393
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:35,314
Oh, I think it would be better if we tuned it this way or that way.

394
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:37,354
But frequently, some things will come out in the prototypes

395
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:39,354
that will go all the way back to the fundamental research

396
00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:41,475
and say, ooh, we should, you know, go off in this direction.

397
00:17:41,475 --> 00:17:44,035
And the gameplay will actually suggest it over this longer loop.

398
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:47,720
So when we do research for games,

399
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,221
or when I do research,

400
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:51,883
I end up reading a lot, covering a lot of topics,

401
00:17:51,883 --> 00:17:54,064
but really I know that at the end of the day,

402
00:17:54,064 --> 00:17:55,244
only maybe 10% of what I research

403
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:56,045
is gonna end up in the game.

404
00:17:56,045 --> 00:17:56,765
You know, the art of this

405
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:58,666
is figuring out what 90% to leave out.

406
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:02,388
This is kind of another view of, you know, the design tree.

407
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:05,189
You know, each one of these branches

408
00:18:05,189 --> 00:18:06,670
is a decision point you're gonna make

409
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,431
at some point in the design.

410
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:09,271
The leaves of this tree,

411
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:10,492
every little leaf on the outside

412
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:11,853
represents one potential product.

413
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:12,831
that you could end up at.

414
00:18:12,831 --> 00:18:15,493
And how you navigate this tree is gonna kind of determine

415
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:16,753
what product you end up building.

416
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:19,435
You know, a kind of more close-up view of this

417
00:18:19,435 --> 00:18:21,636
is you might start reading a book, get you inspired.

418
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:23,157
Maybe you go out and do a prototype of it.

419
00:18:23,157 --> 00:18:25,018
Maybe you have a conversation about it.

420
00:18:25,018 --> 00:18:26,478
Then you change course and say,

421
00:18:26,478 --> 00:18:27,159
let's go do a user test this way.

422
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:28,399
That doesn't work out.

423
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,461
Maybe you go all the way back to the original source,

424
00:18:30,461 --> 00:18:32,161
and then you see a game that kind of reminds you of it.

425
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:34,022
You play that game and then maybe talk about that.

426
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:36,464
And this is kind of what the internal structure

427
00:18:36,464 --> 00:18:37,124
of that tree looks like.

428
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:40,166
it's, you know, a lot of different kind of forms of media,

429
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,569
interaction, conversation, tests that you're doing

430
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:45,732
to make decisions at each branch in that tree.

431
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:48,314
But usually, at the very base, you know,

432
00:18:48,314 --> 00:18:50,657
before I even kind of start climbing down this tree,

433
00:18:50,657 --> 00:18:52,739
I start by asking some very early questions

434
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:55,702
about what I want to, you know, do as a designer.

435
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:58,545
And I've kind of reduced those to, like, four major areas here,

436
00:18:58,545 --> 00:19:00,907
innovation, risks, fun, and messages.

437
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,142
On the innovation side, you know, I think it's important, you know, with every title

438
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:08,444
that we do to try to innovate somewhere, you know, to some degree.

439
00:19:08,444 --> 00:19:10,785
You know, innovation is something that you kind of know when you see it.

440
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:12,125
It's hard to define exactly.

441
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,607
And it doesn't always lead to success, you know.

442
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:19,309
So you can have something that's very innovative, but not necessarily very successful.

443
00:19:20,063 --> 00:19:24,926
But what it does do is it does get you above the signal to noise, you know, in the marketplace.

444
00:19:24,926 --> 00:19:27,728
You know, you want it to be that signal getting above the noise

445
00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:29,309
because we are living in a very noisy marketplace.

446
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:31,790
You know, every year thousands of titles are released.

447
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,031
And, you know, if you have an innovative title, people will talk about it

448
00:19:34,031 --> 00:19:35,632
because it stands out. It's a signal.

449
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,515
And that's just kind of like one of the very first things I try to think about,

450
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:42,756
you know, as almost a prerequisite for a game that I do.

451
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,624
In Sporrer, you know, the innovations I decided would be the procedural content, you know.

452
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:51,367
Well, actually, I've been being teased a lot about this procedural content thing.

453
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:52,808
I heard about this, like, drinking game.

454
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:54,429
Every time I say procedural, somebody takes a drink.

455
00:19:54,429 --> 00:20:01,014
So, I decided actually here, I'm going to let you all vote on what I'm going to start calling this instead.

456
00:20:01,014 --> 00:20:03,616
Okay, so, so these are the candidates.

457
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:04,837
Look them over for a second.

458
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,879
And I'm going to put this to an audience vote.

459
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:08,861
From now on, I'm just going to start calling it something else.

460
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:11,503
So, how many people think I should call it algorithmic content?

461
00:20:16,587 --> 00:20:19,769
Okay. Okay, parametric content.

462
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:25,892
That's what I'm talking about.

463
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,272
Okay, generative content.

464
00:20:27,272 --> 00:20:27,653
Whoa, okay.

465
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:32,515
Okay, we have a winner.

466
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:37,958
Okay, so the generative content was going to buy us player creativity,

467
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:42,340
you know, an unbounded world potentially, since we can generate so much.

468
00:20:42,835 --> 00:20:46,900
The pollinated content, uh, by the social currency of players kind of having some value,

469
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,062
people getting to know the best creators in this world.

470
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:53,887
Uh, thematic diversity, because people are gonna just do all sorts of weird things in different directions.

471
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,430
And then this kind of multi-genre gameplay, um,

472
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:01,815
which gives us epic scope and some familiarity, approachability.

473
00:21:01,815 --> 00:21:03,517
Okay, now, back to the aliens. Uh, okay.

474
00:21:03,517 --> 00:21:06,060
Now, the panspermia thing was interesting.

475
00:21:06,697 --> 00:21:09,660
But really at some point I realized it's all about the aliens, right?

476
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,221
You know, that's what I really wanted to do in this game,

477
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:13,303
was fly around and meet lots of interesting, cool alien creatures,

478
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:15,245
especially if the player's creating them.

479
00:21:15,245 --> 00:21:18,829
So, and it could have been almost, you know,

480
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:21,431
this talk almost was about robots instead of aliens,

481
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:24,875
because aliens and robots to me represent, you know, very similar things.

482
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,798
You know, they kind of represent views of humanity.

483
00:21:27,935 --> 00:21:32,498
You don't really realize how amazing the human hand is until you try to build one.

484
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:37,421
Once you try to build one, you go back and look at this and the dexterity and the strength and the flexibility.

485
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,904
It's just an amazing, amazing thing.

486
00:21:40,904 --> 00:21:47,329
So in some sense, robots give us a better understanding of who we are and, you know, what makes us tick.

487
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:50,131
Now, you're going to hear me talk about this movie a lot.

488
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:51,371
My favorite movie of all time, 2001.

489
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:53,293
I'm completely operational and all my circuits are functioning perfectly.

490
00:21:53,575 --> 00:21:55,957
So when I was 7 years old, I saw this movie and I met Hal

491
00:21:55,957 --> 00:21:57,378
and it had a deep impact on me.

492
00:21:57,378 --> 00:21:58,899
You know, the idea that there could be this machine

493
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:01,641
that thought like a person and you could interact with.

494
00:22:01,641 --> 00:22:04,063
And it just fundamentally, you know, just blew me away as a kid.

495
00:22:04,063 --> 00:22:07,466
What's interesting is, you know, people saw that movie

496
00:22:07,466 --> 00:22:09,007
and they came out and, you know,

497
00:22:09,007 --> 00:22:10,928
this is right at the dawn of AI, really, right?

498
00:22:10,928 --> 00:22:13,891
And they were amazed that a computer could beat this guy at chess.

499
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:16,533
And they weren't amazed at all that he could have these conversations,

500
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:18,214
do all this common sense reasoning, you know.

501
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:22,064
And that was a very interesting insight into human intelligence.

502
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:25,247
You know, because we had thought of, you know, playing chess as being, you know,

503
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:26,788
something that required a lot of intelligence,

504
00:22:26,788 --> 00:22:28,409
and tying your shoes as being simple.

505
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:29,750
And we're finding out that's not the case.

506
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,314
You know, and we found that out through trying to recreate those abilities in machines.

507
00:22:33,314 --> 00:22:35,435
Um, you know, the lip-reading stuff he did.

508
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:37,597
Uh, so in some sense, um,

509
00:22:37,597 --> 00:22:42,201
aliens and robots both represent kind of boundaries or aspects of humanity.

510
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:44,964
Uh, you know, we have, you know, nice aliens, friendly aliens.

511
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:47,546
We have really mean, scary, you know, vicious aliens.

512
00:22:47,896 --> 00:22:50,057
We have really smart and really stupid aliens.

513
00:22:50,057 --> 00:22:52,658
You know, so they're kind of building this boundary,

514
00:22:52,658 --> 00:22:54,818
but they're all still in the same dimensions, you know,

515
00:22:54,818 --> 00:22:55,719
humans are built out of.

516
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,959
So really, both of these things are kind of, I think,

517
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,420
a window into humanity.

518
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,640
And as we, you know, look at imagined aliens,

519
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,221
and as we build robots,

520
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:06,462
we're actually coming to understand ourselves more thoroughly.

521
00:23:06,462 --> 00:23:08,543
Now, the idea of aliens isn't really new.

522
00:23:08,543 --> 00:23:10,543
You know, there are examples from way back in art

523
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:12,524
of things that they might have called demons or angels.

524
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:16,213
More recently, there were a few sightings in the 1800s.

525
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:19,454
There were these things that they saw during World War II called Foo Fighters.

526
00:23:19,454 --> 00:23:22,495
But it was really after the advent of nuclear weapons

527
00:23:22,495 --> 00:23:26,036
that the kind of whole modern alien craze started.

528
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:28,197
The Roswell Incident seems to be like ground zero

529
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:33,438
for where a lot of the kind of modern mythology around aliens spread.

530
00:23:33,755 --> 00:23:39,279
And initially, you know, these aliens were things that were probably very hostile, probably going to come and hurt us.

531
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,040
They were scary.

532
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:45,824
In some sense, I think they were a personification of this power that we suddenly had to destroy ourselves.

533
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,807
In other contexts, they were also this yearning for adult supervision.

534
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:53,450
You know, we were hoping that somebody out there was smarter than us and might actually come and help save ourselves.

535
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:58,014
or even provide an example that maybe we can survive this period in our time.

536
00:23:58,014 --> 00:24:03,278
And this is just one kind of cultural response to kind of this sudden ability to destroy humanity.

537
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:04,859
Different cultures had different responses.

538
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:07,661
In Japan, it was Godzilla, which is a little bit different.

539
00:24:07,661 --> 00:24:11,644
It was more of a personification of what would nature say if she could see us doing this.

540
00:24:11,644 --> 00:24:14,246
And so Godzilla was kind of like the revenge of nature, you know, after we had been...

541
00:24:14,347 --> 00:24:18,150
playing with these weapons. But the aliens, in fact, weren't like Godzilla.

542
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:21,673
They were very vulnerable. We could almost empathize with them. What made them powerful

543
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:25,416
was their technology. And that was something we could aspire to. We could aspire to become

544
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:28,759
these gods, which also made them very different than, like, the old Greek and Roman gods that

545
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,742
we could not aspire to become. Okay, so back to the research.

546
00:24:31,742 --> 00:24:37,167
We covered innovation, project risks,

547
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:39,694
is something that you really have to take seriously.

548
00:24:39,694 --> 00:24:40,854
You know, at every stage of the project,

549
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,135
all the way from beginning to end,

550
00:24:43,135 --> 00:24:45,315
I divide most of the risks that I think of

551
00:24:45,315 --> 00:24:46,396
into these categories,

552
00:24:46,396 --> 00:24:49,537
technology, design, production, marketing, political.

553
00:24:49,537 --> 00:24:51,578
I'm lucky that most of the ideas that I want to do,

554
00:24:51,578 --> 00:24:53,098
you know, I have a freer path.

555
00:24:53,098 --> 00:24:53,958
I think most people here

556
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,319
that have a really cool, innovative idea,

557
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,779
you know, one of the very first battles

558
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:58,620
they're going to be fighting is the political battle.

559
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,981
How do you get a green light inside your company?

560
00:25:00,981 --> 00:25:02,141
Electronic arts, it actually,

561
00:25:02,141 --> 00:25:03,702
I found it's a very simple trick.

562
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,363
It turns out that all the execs play Worlds of Warcraft.

563
00:25:07,397 --> 00:25:11,200
And so all you have to do is say, oh, it's going to be like World of Warcraft,

564
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,103
except it starts in a tide pool and you end up in space,

565
00:25:15,103 --> 00:25:17,505
and it's not quite multiplayer, but it works.

566
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:21,568
Yeah.

567
00:25:21,568 --> 00:25:26,051
So, the top risks I saw for Spore, you know, in sorted order,

568
00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:28,773
were the generative animation system,

569
00:25:28,773 --> 00:25:32,116
editor usability, design scope of the project,

570
00:25:32,116 --> 00:25:34,137
quality content, and content pipeline.

571
00:25:34,672 --> 00:25:36,893
Two of these are technology risks, you know,

572
00:25:36,893 --> 00:25:38,294
which kind of involve one approach.

573
00:25:38,294 --> 00:25:39,534
Two of these were design risks.

574
00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:42,196
And the last one was really kind of a production risk.

575
00:25:42,196 --> 00:25:44,897
So what you really want to do in this case

576
00:25:44,897 --> 00:25:47,459
is front-load the team, get the very first core members

577
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:50,060
in positions to solve those early risks.

578
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,222
I knew that if we couldn't do the generative animation system,

579
00:25:53,222 --> 00:25:55,664
that the whole idea was sunk.

580
00:25:55,664 --> 00:25:59,286
And so one of the very first people I brought on the project

581
00:25:59,286 --> 00:26:00,206
was a guy named Case 1 Pushkin,

582
00:26:00,206 --> 00:26:00,647
who, people know him.

583
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,501
He's a great guy.

584
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:04,483
And he was like my deep researcher.

585
00:26:04,483 --> 00:26:06,726
And he actually, I had him look at all the procedural

586
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:08,928
or generative systems out there.

587
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,253
You know, we found some really cool examples.

588
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:12,694
They were very hard to use,

589
00:26:12,694 --> 00:26:14,876
but they kind of gave us some indication

590
00:26:14,876 --> 00:26:15,737
of the direction to go.

591
00:26:15,737 --> 00:26:17,439
Later, we had Ken Perlin come in

592
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,660
and do some consulting on it,

593
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,722
you know, showing his stuff, his generative stuff.

594
00:26:20,722 --> 00:26:22,783
And then later, Chris Hecker

595
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:24,525
is now kind of building the tool out for animators.

596
00:26:24,525 --> 00:26:26,867
And so, basically, it was getting

597
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:28,328
a very qualified team of specialists

598
00:26:28,328 --> 00:26:29,269
to come in and attack that risk.

599
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:31,731
And I find that these risks are best attacked

600
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:33,553
with a very small number of very sharp people.

601
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:36,195
rather than a giant team of kind of more average people,

602
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:37,676
in which case they'll never solve it.

603
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:40,058
But the very tightly focused team usually can,

604
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:41,419
especially if you say,

605
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:43,000
I don't think you can solve this, there's no way,

606
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,981
and make it a challenge for them.

607
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:46,003
Now, the Polynesian content,

608
00:26:46,003 --> 00:26:47,524
that was something where

609
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,465
we actually had a lot of experience to draw from.

610
00:26:49,465 --> 00:26:51,147
We have these Sims websites,

611
00:26:51,147 --> 00:26:54,429
and a lot of fans are uploading stuff to our Sims website

612
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:56,231
and sharing it and tracking the creators

613
00:26:56,231 --> 00:26:57,252
and the popularity and stuff.

614
00:26:57,587 --> 00:27:01,309
So I brought over two of the people that actually had architected that system,

615
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:05,751
Kelshawn and Colin Andrews, to run the pollinated content side.

616
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:06,211
Yeah, they're great.

617
00:27:06,211 --> 00:27:09,873
And they, in fact, started building prototypes very early on of this system

618
00:27:09,873 --> 00:27:13,815
and capturing all the stuff that we were in development, making in the editors,

619
00:27:13,815 --> 00:27:17,277
and starting to sort it and aesthetically figure out what the categories were.

620
00:27:17,277 --> 00:27:17,417
And...

621
00:27:18,014 --> 00:27:19,956
The fact that they got that prototype going so early

622
00:27:19,956 --> 00:27:22,780
lowered that as a risk factor tremendously right off the bat.

623
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,962
You know, whereas the generative animation system

624
00:27:24,962 --> 00:27:26,985
was kind of a long, ongoing battle that we kept fighting,

625
00:27:26,985 --> 00:27:29,227
and it kind of stayed at the top of the list for a long time.

626
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:31,810
Design scope, you know, games used to be, like,

627
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,693
about that complex, you know, back in the 80s or so.

628
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,575
Uh, now they're more like this.

629
00:27:36,095 --> 00:27:39,458
And so I knew that I wanted to do a game across all these different scales,

630
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,660
and I kind of reasoned that, well, if I didn't make any one of those scales too complicated,

631
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:47,824
the whole set of them still would maybe be about the same complexity as a modern game.

632
00:27:47,824 --> 00:27:51,147
And so that was, like, kind of step one for mitigating the design risk.

633
00:27:51,147 --> 00:27:54,610
Another one was bringing in, again, people that—

634
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,310
Jason Schenkel—

635
00:27:55,949 --> 00:27:57,630
was the lead programmer for Sim Wars,

636
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,590
which is a project that we worked on,

637
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,770
but we never released.

638
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,171
But Jason did a huge number of prototypes

639
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:03,231
of planetary ecosystems and whatnot

640
00:28:03,231 --> 00:28:04,032
that we drew from.

641
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:04,972
And so his experience,

642
00:28:04,972 --> 00:28:05,992
he was actually, like,

643
00:28:05,992 --> 00:28:07,593
the first prototyper on Sporb.

644
00:28:07,593 --> 00:28:10,093
Uh, then playing a lot of old games

645
00:28:10,093 --> 00:28:11,094
that were just great,

646
00:28:11,094 --> 00:28:12,294
like Sundog on the Apple II.

647
00:28:12,294 --> 00:28:13,995
Has anybody ever played this game?

648
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:15,375
This is way back.

649
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:16,095
This is a great game.

650
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:18,076
You know, it had multi-scale gameplay,

651
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:19,576
flying around the galaxy.

652
00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:20,517
Uh, Elite, of course.

653
00:28:20,517 --> 00:28:20,577
Um...

654
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:22,757
Cosmic Osmo,

655
00:28:22,757 --> 00:28:24,678
which might seem like an odd choice,

656
00:28:25,054 --> 00:28:28,195
But that was a great game, too, in a different—in a kind of a toy sense.

657
00:28:28,195 --> 00:28:31,256
And then kind of more offbeat things, Microsoft Space Simulator,

658
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:34,417
which was not a great game, but it was a really fun toy if you were into space.

659
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:36,617
The kind of more recent version of that is this thing, Celestia,

660
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:39,118
which if you're into astronomy, you really should download this.

661
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:42,779
It's a free download, and it's got great plug-ins, and it's really cool.

662
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:44,900
Homeworld, of course, the visuals, the gameplay.

663
00:28:46,195 --> 00:28:48,057
These are basically free prototypes, by the way.

664
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:49,438
You know, I didn't, you know, I made 50-buck prototypes.

665
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:50,739
But, uh, we learned a tremendous amount

666
00:28:50,739 --> 00:28:53,921
just kind of going back into these libraries

667
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:55,042
of things that had been done.

668
00:28:55,042 --> 00:28:56,823
And, you know, a lot of games have been out there,

669
00:28:56,823 --> 00:28:58,285
and you can learn tremendous amounts

670
00:28:58,285 --> 00:29:00,046
just by going and doing, basically, game archaeology.

671
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:02,288
Um, on the evolution side,

672
00:29:02,288 --> 00:29:04,449
we dug up every evolution game we could find.

673
00:29:04,449 --> 00:29:05,270
You know, board games, you know,

674
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,051
all the way up to, like, Carnivore,

675
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:09,633
or Cubivore on the Nintendo.

676
00:29:09,633 --> 00:29:11,695
And, of course, we did a billion and a half prototypes.

677
00:29:12,723 --> 00:29:17,545
Now the prototypes are kind of like the books, where you end up doing lots of prototypes all over the place,

678
00:29:17,545 --> 00:29:21,487
and only a very few end up actually kind of dealing with the actual dynamics in the game.

679
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:24,129
And really, that's okay, because that's what they're for.

680
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:28,070
One thing that I found that works great for prototypes are interns.

681
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,292
And I've had really good luck with interns.

682
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:34,794
Generally, the balance I'm trying to strive for on a team now is about one-third veteran,

683
00:29:34,794 --> 00:29:37,915
one-third kind of intern is young blood, and one-third mid-level.

684
00:29:37,915 --> 00:29:40,137
And that seems like a really good kind of chemistry on the team.

685
00:29:40,877 --> 00:29:46,339
A typical thing is that we have a lot of people coming in, we're trying to filter for hiring,

686
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:51,081
is we have thousands of resumes. The HR people don't quite know exactly what we're looking

687
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:54,022
for because they're not experts in the field. They try their best and sort and give us a

688
00:29:54,022 --> 00:29:58,044
pile of resumes and we kind of choose from those. And it's a very ineffective filter

689
00:29:58,044 --> 00:30:02,306
in a lot of cases. You know, what I'm finding is a much more effective filter is a few programs

690
00:30:02,306 --> 00:30:04,867
in these universities that are teaching, you know, interactive design now.

691
00:30:05,127 --> 00:30:07,748
We have a few students come in and do very well in those programs.

692
00:30:07,748 --> 00:30:10,529
And then I let the professor recommend to me, you know,

693
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:14,531
knowing exactly what I'm looking for, and they've known the student for years.

694
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:18,872
And so in some sense, these students are kind of like the salmon swimming upstream.

695
00:30:18,872 --> 00:30:22,033
And I'm like at the top of the stream, you know, waiting for the best salmon to get there.

696
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:24,334
And that's turned out to be a great filter for me.

697
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:28,496
And like I said, like three schools in particular that in fact we're getting our best interns from.

698
00:30:28,496 --> 00:30:32,657
And I'm not going to tell you what they are, because I don't want to kind of have to compete for them.

699
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:32,897
But on the...

700
00:30:33,338 --> 00:30:38,939
Editor usability, in fact I had interns working on this, you know, from very early stage.

701
00:30:38,939 --> 00:30:44,241
We looked at all these other games that involved constructing things, Bridge Builder, Magic Pinjail.

702
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:49,222
This was a very interesting one. In fact, it was based upon the work of this Japanese computer scientist, Takio Igarashi.

703
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:55,443
And he did a lot of other basically constructive systems like this that had a lot of embedded intelligence in them.

704
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:59,116
Um, so we're dealing with this, with user content.

705
00:30:59,116 --> 00:31:01,157
And this is kind of what we're trying to,

706
00:31:01,157 --> 00:31:03,680
the curve we're trying to fight with the editors.

707
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,021
Is, you know, we get a lot of content

708
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:05,741
that's at low quality.

709
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:07,263
You know, it's basically crap.

710
00:31:07,263 --> 00:31:07,543
Um...

711
00:31:08,392 --> 00:31:10,232
We get a fair amount that's kind of a good effort.

712
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:12,333
A little bit that's pretty good.

713
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,054
And a very small amount that's great.

714
00:31:14,054 --> 00:31:16,996
And what we really want to do is we want to pull up this curve.

715
00:31:16,996 --> 00:31:18,916
And this is kind of why we're focusing on editors.

716
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:21,938
How can we make players be creative in the game,

717
00:31:21,938 --> 00:31:23,699
but also have that stuff be good enough

718
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:24,859
to where other players get value from it?

719
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:27,200
I mean, if they want to just sit there and make crappy stuff

720
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,221
and it's in their game, I could care less.

721
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,342
But if we want to redistribute it to other players

722
00:31:31,342 --> 00:31:33,443
and add value to their world,

723
00:31:33,443 --> 00:31:36,445
we want to kind of bring everybody up on the quality bar here.

724
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:39,425
And so we did a lot of early prototyping of the editors

725
00:31:39,425 --> 00:31:40,306
and usability tests,

726
00:31:40,306 --> 00:31:42,487
because this is really kind of a usability issue.

727
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:46,049
Now, the content pipeline was our last risk.

728
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:49,031
Electronic Arts is moving over to RenderWare as a framework.

729
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:51,033
A lot of RenderWare is really about, you know,

730
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:53,935
the pipeline for animation and modeling,

731
00:31:53,935 --> 00:31:56,176
stuff that we're all doing generatively.

732
00:31:56,176 --> 00:31:58,057
So we pretty much had to kind of roll our own pipeline.

733
00:31:58,057 --> 00:32:00,519
In some sense, you know, looking at the art staff,

734
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,700
you know, I was finding that the artists

735
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,081
are already getting extremely technical.

736
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:05,222
They're writing, you know, pixel shaders,

737
00:32:05,222 --> 00:32:05,843
working in Maya.

738
00:32:06,498 --> 00:32:12,502
And it wasn't that far of a jump to kind of go toward this idea of a generative artist.

739
00:32:12,502 --> 00:32:14,884
Yes, generative artist.

740
00:32:14,884 --> 00:32:21,328
What I found in looking at kind of the skill set that works well is you want somebody that can kind of observe nature

741
00:32:21,328 --> 00:32:24,970
or observe whatever and from that, you know, with almost a scientific eye

742
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,872
and deconstruct what they're seeing.

743
00:32:27,872 --> 00:32:31,955
And when they can deconstruct it, they can kind of bring it into a larger conceptual space.

744
00:32:32,573 --> 00:32:35,075
and abstract it out into eventually data structures.

745
00:32:35,075 --> 00:32:38,616
And then we use those data structures to regenerate,

746
00:32:38,616 --> 00:32:41,098
you know, through algorithms, you know, new content.

747
00:32:41,098 --> 00:32:43,039
And so this is kind of the process

748
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,140
that I'm trying to train our artists

749
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,220
into thinking this way.

750
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,121
And there's really, we have one prototype of this.

751
00:32:48,121 --> 00:32:49,882
And we're also trying to build tools

752
00:32:49,882 --> 00:32:52,603
that will allow artists to do this more easily,

753
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,044
and eventually our players,

754
00:32:54,044 --> 00:32:57,205
because eventually this is kind of what we want the player to do

755
00:32:57,205 --> 00:32:59,326
on a little bit simpler, higher level.

756
00:32:59,326 --> 00:33:02,008
So this is my lead artist, Ocean Quigley.

757
00:33:03,007 --> 00:33:06,471
And he's like the first generative artist that I've ever met.

758
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:10,297
You know, he's kind of trained himself in that process I just showed you.

759
00:33:10,297 --> 00:33:14,242
He's proven remarkably difficult to breed in captivity, but...

760
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:17,647
On the other hand, we found that we've gotten extreme leverage.

761
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:20,010
I've paired him up with one of our best programmers, Andrew Willmott.

762
00:33:20,893 --> 00:33:23,395
Andrew developed this custom language for Ocean.

763
00:33:23,395 --> 00:33:25,136
And, you know, they worked very closely together.

764
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,478
And, you know, whenever Ocean had a limitation on language,

765
00:33:27,478 --> 00:33:29,019
Andrew would go back and add a few more things.

766
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:31,000
And he made a very comfortable editing environment

767
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,422
to where Ocean was basically scripting and writing programming.

768
00:33:33,422 --> 00:33:34,963
Um, and because of that, you know,

769
00:33:34,963 --> 00:33:37,865
we got probably ten times the efficiency out of Ocean.

770
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:40,427
So, um, this is an interesting experiment

771
00:33:40,427 --> 00:33:41,628
where we can get extreme leverage

772
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:43,109
out of certain people in these, you know, roles.

773
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:44,970
But then this might become the template later

774
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,672
for bringing people into these roles and training them.

775
00:33:46,672 --> 00:33:48,333
Okay, back to the aliens.

776
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:55,375
Okay, so, Copernicus came up with this idea that maybe the whole universe doesn't revolve around the Earth.

777
00:33:55,375 --> 00:34:00,300
You know, maybe the Earth is just one kind of place out there like a lot of other places.

778
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,361
And because of that, people kind of abstracted the idea,

779
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:06,425
okay, well, if we're just like everywhere else, maybe there are people like us everywhere else.

780
00:34:06,425 --> 00:34:10,068
And it was almost a given that there were aliens out there somewhere, maybe even nearby, on Mars.

781
00:34:10,068 --> 00:34:14,653
You know, back in the 1800s, they thought they were actually observing canals on Mars.

782
00:34:15,063 --> 00:34:18,204
They were waiting for them to come attack us, basically, you know.

783
00:34:18,204 --> 00:34:20,225
And it wasn't really considered that out there of an idea.

784
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,947
It was, you know, highly plausible.

785
00:34:22,947 --> 00:34:27,769
More recently, this new theory has come around, called the Rare Earth Theory.

786
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:31,171
And it basically says that maybe we're a lot more unique than we thought at first.

787
00:34:31,171 --> 00:34:34,412
And it's a little bit different than the Copernican Principle.

788
00:34:34,412 --> 00:34:36,593
For one thing, we have this amazing moon,

789
00:34:36,593 --> 00:34:40,495
which has a lot of impacts on keeping the Earth more stable for a lot of reasons.

790
00:34:41,101 --> 00:34:44,263
The leading theory of how we got the Moon was that this big thing hit the Earth, kind

791
00:34:44,263 --> 00:34:46,205
of sloughed off, and then went into orbit around us.

792
00:34:46,205 --> 00:34:48,446
It used to be much, much closer.

793
00:34:48,446 --> 00:34:51,168
The Moon used to be about 14,000 miles away from us, if that was true.

794
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:54,710
Now that would have been really cool, you know, to be back then and see that, because

795
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,572
it would be this huge thing up in the sky.

796
00:34:56,572 --> 00:35:01,295
It also would have caused one kilometer land tides, which is that the land would actually

797
00:35:01,295 --> 00:35:03,417
go up and down a kilometer twice a day, you know.

798
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,358
And that would have been really cool to see.

799
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:10,502
Another kind of unusual thing about our situation.

800
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:12,076
is this thing, Jupiter.

801
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:15,598
Jupiter's a big planet, it turns out.

802
00:35:15,598 --> 00:35:18,059
In fact, it's not only the heaviest planet in our solar system,

803
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:20,900
but it's twice as heavy as all the other planets put together.

804
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,661
What that means is that most of the crap

805
00:35:22,661 --> 00:35:25,162
that comes flying into our solar system gets eaten by Jupiter.

806
00:35:25,162 --> 00:35:26,463
It's a big shield.

807
00:35:26,463 --> 00:35:27,503
If Jupiter weren't there,

808
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:29,764
Earth and all the other planets would have been bombarded

809
00:35:29,764 --> 00:35:31,345
many, many times more than they were.

810
00:35:31,345 --> 00:35:33,706
So it's actually protected us quite a bit.

811
00:35:33,706 --> 00:35:35,627
We actually saw one of these impacts.

812
00:35:36,147 --> 00:35:38,549
about eight years ago, the Shoemaker-Levy comet hit Jupiter,

813
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:40,471
and we actually got photographs of where it hit.

814
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,133
So it was pretty cool to see something like that in our lifetime.

815
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:44,994
Now, if we pull back a little bit, away from our solar system,

816
00:35:44,994 --> 00:35:47,797
at the galaxy level, the galaxy is a very thin, flat disk,

817
00:35:47,797 --> 00:35:49,438
the spiral galaxies.

818
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:52,441
We're about halfway out from the center of the disk.

819
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,083
And these spiral arms aren't exactly what you might think.

820
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,164
You know, you look at these and you think,

821
00:35:56,164 --> 00:35:57,204
oh, that's where all the stars are.

822
00:35:57,204 --> 00:35:58,666
That's not really the case.

823
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:01,348
That's where the bright stars are, the really young stars.

824
00:36:01,348 --> 00:36:03,129
They're lighting up the dust around there.

825
00:36:03,129 --> 00:36:05,851
The actual stellar distribution is pretty even through this disk.

826
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:11,762
Stars form in these dust clouds and once they form, they ignite.

827
00:36:11,762 --> 00:36:14,304
And depending on the mass of the star, you get, you know,

828
00:36:14,304 --> 00:36:17,287
like a blue giant or a mainline star or maybe a red dwarf.

829
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:19,449
The bigger the star, the shorter the lifespan.

830
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:23,332
So these large blue giants actually go supernova very rapidly.

831
00:36:23,332 --> 00:36:25,334
So they only last a few million years.

832
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:28,356
And so the spiral arms are actually those supernova lighting up

833
00:36:28,356 --> 00:36:31,819
and the blue stars lighting up these regions of high dust.

834
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:32,020
Now.

835
00:36:33,262 --> 00:36:39,164
What that means is these arms really are governed by hydrodynamic principles.

836
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:40,525
It's like pressure waves moving around.

837
00:36:40,525 --> 00:36:43,806
So they actually maintain their structure as they revolve around the center.

838
00:36:43,806 --> 00:36:45,106
Otherwise, they would kind of dissolve.

839
00:36:45,106 --> 00:36:46,847
They orbit with a period.

840
00:36:47,173 --> 00:36:49,555
of about 200 million years, you know, for one revolution.

841
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:54,479
Now the stars and planets are actually governed by gravitational, you know, forces.

842
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:58,883
So ones closer to the center go faster and ones further out go slower.

843
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,926
That means that the ones closer to the middle are actually going through these arms very often,

844
00:37:02,926 --> 00:37:04,207
you know, every 10 or 20 million years.

845
00:37:04,207 --> 00:37:06,830
Ones that are further out are actually being overtaken by the arms

846
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,171
because the arms are going faster than them.

847
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,122
Now, these arms are actually very high radiation zones,

848
00:37:12,122 --> 00:37:14,784
both because of the supernovas going off and because of the blue giants

849
00:37:14,784 --> 00:37:15,905
and the dust and a lot of other things.

850
00:37:15,905 --> 00:37:20,248
They're actually pretty disruptive areas for like a sun to go through.

851
00:37:20,248 --> 00:37:22,410
And there's actually a very thin zone here.

852
00:37:22,966 --> 00:37:26,109
where the stars are pretty much in sync with the arms,

853
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:28,751
and they are not passing through the arms very often at all.

854
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:31,774
And it turns out that we actually live in the exact center of that zone.

855
00:37:31,774 --> 00:37:34,977
So, this is, you know, one other possibility

856
00:37:34,977 --> 00:37:38,440
that maybe we're in a kind of more unique situation than we think,

857
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,922
that there's this habitability zone in the galaxy.

858
00:37:40,922 --> 00:37:41,783
There's another one.

859
00:37:41,783 --> 00:37:45,146
The early stars were almost entirely hydrogen and helium.

860
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:46,827
Over time, they blew up, made dust.

861
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,123
dust came back, collapsed, back into kind of protoplanetary disks, and then new stars

862
00:37:51,123 --> 00:37:54,966
were formed. But these new stars had higher metal content. And in this case, anything,

863
00:37:54,966 --> 00:37:59,109
you know, above helium is considered a metal. So that would be a second generation star

864
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:03,032
on the bottom, a first generation star on top. Our sun actually is a pretty high metal

865
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:07,995
star. We think it's a second or third generation star, which means that the, you know, original

866
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:11,698
star blew up, made dust, another star was created, back and forth to make our sun.

867
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:16,504
Which means that there was enough metal in our protoplanetary disk to make things like terrestrial planets like the Earth.

868
00:38:16,504 --> 00:38:18,985
Otherwise, it would have just been probably gas giants.

869
00:38:18,985 --> 00:38:24,847
We've also found correlations where the higher metal content stars definitely have more planetary systems.

870
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:32,370
So there seems to be this idea that the metallocity of your star is also maybe a requisite for life as we know it.

871
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:35,051
And this is actually kind of a map.

872
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:40,799
The high metal stars slowly evolve, spreading out further and further from the galactic center.

873
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:45,985
And we're just about the point in time when that green band is overlapping the other band I showed you.

874
00:38:45,985 --> 00:38:49,690
So this is just stuff that we've, you know, fairly recently kind of discovered.

875
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,171
Okay, back to the game stuff.

876
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:52,293
Now, on to the obvious fun.

877
00:38:53,112 --> 00:38:56,175
Um, for every game, you know, you kind of want to start with,

878
00:38:56,175 --> 00:38:56,975
why am I doing this?

879
00:38:56,975 --> 00:38:58,957
I mean, and when you start getting into the game concepts,

880
00:38:58,957 --> 00:39:01,099
it's always about, you know, what is obviously fun about this?

881
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:02,900
You know, when I put this on the back of a little box,

882
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,421
why does somebody think, you know, they're gonna want to play it?

883
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:05,302
What's the hook for the player?

884
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:07,324
Um, just to give you an example, you know,

885
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:09,145
when we were doing the space stuff, we thought,

886
00:39:09,145 --> 00:39:10,747
OK, suppose we had a UFO, and we could go anywhere.

887
00:39:10,747 --> 00:39:12,208
You know, what would we want to do?

888
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:13,629
You know, all these worlds the players have created.

889
00:39:14,117 --> 00:39:16,959
And then, you know, we kind of dove in, and it depended on every level of the game.

890
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:20,482
You know, we thought on a wild planet, we'd probably want to do the uplift thing, you know,

891
00:39:20,482 --> 00:39:23,364
making them smart, or maybe just kind of collect them, you know, like Pokemon.

892
00:39:23,364 --> 00:39:27,668
On the tribal, you know, really, you know, it seemed like we wanted them to worship us,

893
00:39:27,668 --> 00:39:30,630
maybe make monuments, you know, and be their god.

894
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:34,192
You know, civilized, you know, maybe play first contact, adult supervision,

895
00:39:34,192 --> 00:39:37,715
or maybe just kind of mess with them and do crop circles, you know.

896
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:42,080
And then spacefaring, you know, obviously combat, trading,

897
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,942
maybe building interstellar federations,

898
00:39:44,942 --> 00:39:46,023
but definitely exploration,

899
00:39:46,023 --> 00:39:47,524
because at that point the world gets so expansive.

900
00:39:47,524 --> 00:39:49,986
But for every level of the game, we would go through

901
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:52,008
and just kind of figure out, what are the obvious things that,

902
00:39:52,008 --> 00:39:53,750
you know, if I asked somebody in two minutes,

903
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:54,510
I'm scrubbing the game,

904
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,232
what would you want to do in this game?

905
00:39:56,232 --> 00:39:57,893
You know, and we'd put those all down on a list,

906
00:39:57,893 --> 00:39:59,575
and those became kind of landmarks

907
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:01,056
that I talked about a couple years ago.

908
00:40:01,056 --> 00:40:03,198
Okay, back to the aliens.

909
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:07,195
Now, there's SETI with an S, searching for aliens,

910
00:40:07,195 --> 00:40:09,637
and there's SETI with a C, which is communicating with aliens.

911
00:40:09,637 --> 00:40:13,499
You know, we've in some sense already been communicating.

912
00:40:13,499 --> 00:40:17,101
We've been putting plaques, this is a plaque from Voyager,

913
00:40:17,101 --> 00:40:20,622
that's off on its way, and it's going to hit some other star

914
00:40:20,622 --> 00:40:22,163
in about 20,000 years or so. It's kind of slow.

915
00:40:22,163 --> 00:40:23,544
We're also radioing messages.

916
00:40:23,544 --> 00:40:26,546
This is a message that was radioed from the Arecibo telescope in 74,

917
00:40:26,546 --> 00:40:28,987
and I'm not going to go into what that means,

918
00:40:28,987 --> 00:40:31,408
but it was badly, badly designed.

919
00:40:32,215 --> 00:40:38,281
Even unintentionally, we've been communicating, you know, with all the radio waves that have been leaving Earth.

920
00:40:38,281 --> 00:40:41,924
You know, so, for 55 years, you know, aliens out there can receive I Love Lucy,

921
00:40:41,924 --> 00:40:44,887
and that includes 1,400 star systems.

922
00:40:44,887 --> 00:40:49,072
Um, 600 stars can receive Gilligan's Island,

923
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,833
and a lucky 150 stars can receive Deuce of Hazard.

924
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:56,911
Now, of course, we've been listening.

925
00:40:56,911 --> 00:40:58,612
You know, a lot of you might have had,

926
00:40:58,612 --> 00:41:00,773
this is your screensaver, SETI at home.

927
00:41:00,773 --> 00:41:02,113
It turns out that the SETI program's actually

928
00:41:02,113 --> 00:41:04,714
listening to quite a bit of the bandwidth

929
00:41:04,714 --> 00:41:07,095
and frequencies out there and quite a bit of space.

930
00:41:07,095 --> 00:41:10,416
This is a map of, you know, by size of civilization

931
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:13,337
on one axis, how far out we should have heard of them.

932
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,498
In fact, we've thoroughly searched, you know,

933
00:41:15,498 --> 00:41:17,839
fairly large civilizations in our galaxy

934
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,480
we should have seen by now.

935
00:41:19,934 --> 00:41:21,695
That's brought up kind of an interesting thing.

936
00:41:21,695 --> 00:41:23,215
You know, back in the 50s, Enrico Fermi,

937
00:41:23,215 --> 00:41:25,376
a physicist, was having lunch and they were discussing

938
00:41:25,376 --> 00:41:27,397
Drake's equation, and he had this simple

939
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:28,697
question at lunch, which is, where are they?

940
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,878
You know, by most of the estimates they were

941
00:41:30,878 --> 00:41:33,559
plugging into those numbers, we should have aliens

942
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,220
all around us. They shouldn't be hard to find at all.

943
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,180
We should be overrun with them.

944
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,641
And this became known as the Fermi Paradox, or the colonization argument.

945
00:41:41,525 --> 00:41:45,788
He reasoned that even if we went slow, sublight velocities, from our home planet,

946
00:41:45,788 --> 00:41:49,392
took hundreds of years to get to the next star, stayed there for hundreds of years,

947
00:41:49,392 --> 00:41:52,755
built, you know, maybe another ship, and went to the next set of stars,

948
00:41:52,755 --> 00:41:56,938
that really, you know, with this branching factor of us spreading through the galaxy,

949
00:41:56,938 --> 00:42:00,241
we should be able to fill the galaxy in less than five million years easy.

950
00:42:00,241 --> 00:42:02,724
You know, which five million years sounds like a long time,

951
00:42:02,724 --> 00:42:05,086
but to put it in evolutionary perspective, you know, back to this map.

952
00:42:05,546 --> 00:42:09,534
Here's the complex life, you know, that we've been for the last 500 million years.

953
00:42:09,534 --> 00:42:10,316
We zoom into that.

954
00:42:10,316 --> 00:42:12,339
You know, the dinosaurs have been around for about half that time.

955
00:42:12,339 --> 00:42:15,686
They were around for a remarkable period of time, several hundred million years,

956
00:42:15,686 --> 00:42:17,850
until this asteroid came and, you know, killed them.

957
00:42:18,794 --> 00:42:20,655
If we zoom into that, like the last 65 million years,

958
00:42:20,655 --> 00:42:23,875
and if we had just given the dinosaurs another 20 million years to evolve,

959
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:28,316
and they were every bit as biologically complex as we are,

960
00:42:28,316 --> 00:42:30,277
they would have filled the galaxy by then, you know.

961
00:42:30,277 --> 00:42:32,578
So, that's a very short period of time, you know,

962
00:42:32,578 --> 00:42:36,859
that it would take any alien civilization to be just all around us.

963
00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:39,779
And if that actually occurred, it would actually turn out that Star Trek was right,

964
00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:42,220
that all the aliens did kind of look like one species,

965
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,980
because it would generally be one alien species

966
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,961
that would be out there basically filling this galaxy.

967
00:42:46,763 --> 00:42:49,326
There's this other guy, a mathematician, John von Neumann,

968
00:42:49,326 --> 00:42:51,468
that came up with this idea of von Neumann probes.

969
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,510
This is the idea of a self-replicating machine.

970
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:56,534
And his idea was that you build these machines,

971
00:42:56,534 --> 00:42:58,776
send them off, they can take as long as they want to,

972
00:42:58,776 --> 00:42:59,797
100,000 years or whatever, to get to a star.

973
00:42:59,797 --> 00:43:03,040
They assemble raw materials to make duplicates of themselves,

974
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,463
and then they'll send those duplicates off,

975
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:07,625
and then they can sit there and terraform those, you know,

976
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:10,028
or drop life, bring genetic databases, whatever.

977
00:43:10,475 --> 00:43:15,457
So it's probably likely that in fact if we do meet aliens out there, the first ones we meet will probably be mechanical.

978
00:43:15,457 --> 00:43:16,778
Because this is a far more efficient way.

979
00:43:16,778 --> 00:43:19,960
You know, I think somebody with the wealth of like Bill Gates,

980
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,182
about a hundred years from now, we'll have the technology where somebody like him could probably do this on his own.

981
00:43:24,182 --> 00:43:25,723
It wouldn't even have to be a giant government program.

982
00:43:25,723 --> 00:43:28,884
He could just go off and build a von Neumann machine and send it out there.

983
00:43:28,884 --> 00:43:31,526
Nobody's going to stop him.

984
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:31,726
Now...

985
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:36,738
This is my little side rant just about how valuable the, uh, basically robots in space are.

986
00:43:36,738 --> 00:43:40,000
You know, robots are getting cheaper, more efficient, faster every year.

987
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,282
Humans are not. You know, I love the Manned Space Program.

988
00:43:42,282 --> 00:43:43,803
I think it's really cool, amazing history.

989
00:43:43,803 --> 00:43:47,365
But really, for the dollars we spend, we get so much more science out of the robots.

990
00:43:47,365 --> 00:43:49,746
In fact, when I was thinking about it, I was trying to think, you know,

991
00:43:49,746 --> 00:43:52,248
what was the biggest scientific benefit of the Manned Space Program?

992
00:43:52,248 --> 00:43:55,910
And, uh, I think it was probably when they went up to repair the Hubble.

993
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:56,010
Um...

994
00:43:56,693 --> 00:43:58,674
Which is not to take anything away from the astronauts.

995
00:43:58,674 --> 00:44:01,155
I think, you know, living and working in space is, you know,

996
00:44:01,155 --> 00:44:02,975
eventually going to be human destiny.

997
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:04,656
But for right now, on a limited budget, we're getting this

998
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:07,237
tremendous kind of bang for our buck out of these machines.

999
00:44:07,237 --> 00:44:10,478
As a matter of fact, if you just take the price of the Hubble

1000
00:44:10,478 --> 00:44:14,719
telescope, that equals about one week of the war in Iraq right now.

1001
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,619
And if you took the total cost...

1002
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:22,201
If you took just what we spent in Iraq so far,

1003
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:25,382
that would buy a Hubble for every member of the UN.

1004
00:44:26,302 --> 00:44:30,184
And you'd still have 150 left over for Antarctica.

1005
00:44:30,184 --> 00:44:37,367
Because nobody ever gives Antarctica anything, right?

1006
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:49,273
But I want to show you a little prototype here.

1007
00:44:49,273 --> 00:44:51,454
This is just a very simple prototype of...

1008
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:58,265
What would happen if, you know, there was panspermia, where lifeforms can spread, kind of undirected from star to star?

1009
00:44:58,265 --> 00:45:03,290
And how that might look. This is a very simple little galactic model.

1010
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:08,915
Here we're seeing stars form. This layer is actually the radiation that those arms are causing.

1011
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,096
These are like the spiral arms of a galaxy.

1012
00:45:10,096 --> 00:45:16,462
Now I can go into this and see life. I can drop in a very simple lifeform.

1013
00:45:16,462 --> 00:45:17,343
Oh, actually that was a star.

1014
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:30,288
that green thing. Now, it'll start spreading, you know, this is taking thousands, millions

1015
00:45:30,288 --> 00:45:38,175
of years, but still, over time, oh, that one didn't. So much for my point there. I must

1016
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:45,741
have dropped them into a high radiation zone. Yeah, I'm dropping them into a spiral arm.

1017
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:57,250
Now, at this point, we'll see. It'll take some time, but over time, this microbial, this represents microbial life being spread through comets, asteroids, whatever, will spread out and eventually kind of diversify.

1018
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:03,977
There's a very low probability that this life can become multicellular in this model and it will turn yellow.

1019
00:46:03,977 --> 00:46:06,820
And the multicellular life cannot spread that way, okay?

1020
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:13,166
And so they're stuck and if they get, you know, killed for whatever reason, supernova nearby, then they're gone.

1021
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:17,690
And there's a very slight chance that if those yellow multicellular things last long enough, they'll become intelligent.

1022
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:21,974
Now I'm going to just kind of cheat, skip ahead here and force one of these guys to become intelligent.

1023
00:46:21,974 --> 00:46:29,121
Once we drop intelligent life into this model, the blue is intelligent life, you know.

1024
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:30,722
This is it spreading through the galaxy.

1025
00:46:31,511 --> 00:46:33,692
And this is in spaceships colonizing whatever.

1026
00:46:33,692 --> 00:46:38,255
So from this, you know, I kind of played with a lot of parameters around this model.

1027
00:46:38,255 --> 00:46:41,636
And I kind of came to the conclusion that the most probable galactic states we would

1028
00:46:41,636 --> 00:46:45,679
encounter would be either a lifeless galaxy, like at the beginning, one that had a lot

1029
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:48,820
of microbial life spread through pan-spermia, or a lot of intelligent life.

1030
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:53,983
And the transitions between these phases would be relatively rapid, especially between the

1031
00:46:53,983 --> 00:46:54,503
last two.

1032
00:46:55,938 --> 00:47:00,981
So, the rear-Earth thing kind of says that there might be all these preconditions that make it special.

1033
00:47:00,981 --> 00:47:03,822
A high-middle star, being in the solar habitable zone,

1034
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:06,764
having the Moon to help stabilize our planet, Jupiter, the galactic habitable zone.

1035
00:47:06,764 --> 00:47:10,125
These last three things really bought us four billion years of stability,

1036
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:13,027
which is a remarkably long period of time for one planet to be stable.

1037
00:47:13,027 --> 00:47:16,508
This also kind of bears on what's known as the anthropic principle.

1038
00:47:16,508 --> 00:47:19,330
This is kind of the idea that...

1039
00:47:19,694 --> 00:47:25,499
It's hard for us to infer from where we are how improbable the string of events was required to create us.

1040
00:47:25,499 --> 00:47:28,021
You know, if we're required as observers to ask the question.

1041
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:32,225
So we wouldn't be here to ask the question unless those million improbable things happened.

1042
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:33,766
It might be common, it might be improbable.

1043
00:47:33,766 --> 00:47:35,387
We just cannot make a determination about it.

1044
00:47:35,387 --> 00:47:38,129
So we cannot assume that we are common elements in the universe.

1045
00:47:38,129 --> 00:47:42,913
Which is kind of against the prevailing Copernican principle that had been around for several hundred years before that.

1046
00:47:43,074 --> 00:47:45,977
Possible answers to the Fermi Paradox involve things like quarantine,

1047
00:47:45,977 --> 00:47:48,099
the prime director from Star Trek, you know, let's not upset the natives.

1048
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:51,002
Maybe they're hiding from us. Maybe the galaxy is a very dangerous place

1049
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:52,524
and they don't want anybody to know where they are.

1050
00:47:52,524 --> 00:47:54,606
Maybe we're looking in the wrong place.

1051
00:47:54,606 --> 00:47:56,729
Maybe they don't use radio waves, they use tachyons,

1052
00:47:56,729 --> 00:47:58,450
or something we can't detect right now.

1053
00:47:59,071 --> 00:48:01,752
Or maybe they don't spread, don't colonize.

1054
00:48:01,752 --> 00:48:07,214
But each one of these arguments kind of assumes that the aliens are applying one strategy.

1055
00:48:07,214 --> 00:48:10,355
And if anything we've learned from studying human history,

1056
00:48:10,355 --> 00:48:13,836
is that humans tend to spread and diversify in their behavior.

1057
00:48:13,836 --> 00:48:16,357
And with the distances involved in interstellar travel,

1058
00:48:16,357 --> 00:48:20,158
there's no way to maintain like a federation or enforce the prime directive.

1059
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:24,140
So, it seems unlikely to me that any of these things really are good answers to the Fermi Paradox.

1060
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,580
Okay, back to research.

1061
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,400
Deep messages.

1062
00:48:26,727 --> 00:48:28,508
early on in a project, I'm always trying to figure out,

1063
00:48:28,508 --> 00:48:30,249
okay, what do I really want to convey to the player?

1064
00:48:30,249 --> 00:48:32,670
You know, we have this amazing tool,

1065
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:35,272
and, um, it's interesting because I always think

1066
00:48:35,272 --> 00:48:38,373
of the player model as the model I'm building.

1067
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:41,175
The computer model is really just kind of a path to get there.

1068
00:48:41,175 --> 00:48:42,436
It's an intermediate path.

1069
00:48:42,436 --> 00:48:44,737
And the, uh, the game really, in some sense,

1070
00:48:44,737 --> 00:48:46,738
is a compiler for the middle model and the player.

1071
00:48:46,738 --> 00:48:47,919
This is one of my favorite quotes.

1072
00:48:47,919 --> 00:48:49,419
Education is not the filling of a pail,

1073
00:48:49,419 --> 00:48:50,420
but the lighting of a fire.

1074
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,180
I think games are actually...

1075
00:48:51,698 --> 00:48:54,839
even more effective to motivate people than they are to educate people.

1076
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:57,860
I've gotten so many letters from people that played SimCity

1077
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,501
and it motivated them to go off and, you know,

1078
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:00,982
do a career in civil engineering or whatever.

1079
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:04,443
I don't think they learned that much about civil engineering from SimCity,

1080
00:49:04,443 --> 00:49:07,004
but the motivation on the subject, just the introduction of the subject,

1081
00:49:07,004 --> 00:49:08,405
and giving them that front door to,

1082
00:49:08,405 --> 00:49:10,706
hey, this really is cool, is tremendous, I think.

1083
00:49:10,706 --> 00:49:13,207
Montessori toys are kind of an interesting example of that,

1084
00:49:13,207 --> 00:49:15,388
like self-directed learning, where you give them a toy

1085
00:49:15,388 --> 00:49:16,549
and they discover their own principles.

1086
00:49:16,549 --> 00:49:18,449
There was an earlier example, Froebel,

1087
00:49:18,449 --> 00:49:20,670
this German kindergarten teacher that came up with this block set.

1088
00:49:20,911 --> 00:49:23,137
people do architectural things with.

1089
00:49:23,137 --> 00:49:25,082
So we have this ability,

1090
00:49:25,082 --> 00:49:26,766
you know, to basically change our players

1091
00:49:26,766 --> 00:49:28,851
and at a fairly deep level, I think.

1092
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:31,771
Now, the deep messages I wanted to do in Spore

1093
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:33,532
involved some of the things I just talked to you about.

1094
00:49:33,532 --> 00:49:34,813
Pring and Principle, Fermi Paradox.

1095
00:49:34,813 --> 00:49:36,074
I didn't want to, you know,

1096
00:49:36,074 --> 00:49:37,034
beat them over the head with this.

1097
00:49:37,034 --> 00:49:39,135
I wanted these things that they roughly kind of

1098
00:49:39,135 --> 00:49:39,856
discovered on their own

1099
00:49:39,856 --> 00:49:41,897
after playing with the game for a while.

1100
00:49:41,897 --> 00:49:43,078
But after the game design evolved

1101
00:49:43,078 --> 00:49:44,338
and we started doing more prototyping,

1102
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:46,640
these messages started to evolve as well.

1103
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,561
So the kind of more recent messages

1104
00:49:48,561 --> 00:49:50,202
that I'm trying to embed in the game, you know,

1105
00:49:50,202 --> 00:49:51,523
include things like life is diverse.

1106
00:49:51,523 --> 00:49:53,644
You know, it comes in all different shapes and sizes.

1107
00:49:54,125 --> 00:50:01,112
Also, you know, looking at the editors and what people have been building in them and how they feel about what they've built,

1108
00:50:01,112 --> 00:50:03,775
to me that feels like a great message, that anybody can be creative.

1109
00:50:03,775 --> 00:50:06,138
You know, I want somebody to feel like they have a future at Pixar.

1110
00:50:06,138 --> 00:50:09,701
That, you know, after playing with this thing for half an hour, they've created a creature on the screen

1111
00:50:09,701 --> 00:50:12,324
that's as cool to them as something in a Pixar film.

1112
00:50:12,324 --> 00:50:14,086
And then it comes to life and surprises them.

1113
00:50:14,086 --> 00:50:16,609
So in some sense, they end up being surprised by their own creativity.

1114
00:50:16,937 --> 00:50:19,117
As a kid, I spent a lot of time, like, in the planetarium,

1115
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:21,278
looking at these star shows on the dome overhead,

1116
00:50:21,278 --> 00:50:22,158
and watching star maps.

1117
00:50:22,158 --> 00:50:23,819
And it always frustrated me in some sense

1118
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:25,099
because space is not flat.

1119
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:26,939
You know, it's this wonderfully 3-D thing

1120
00:50:26,939 --> 00:50:29,880
with these colorful things and those Hubble images

1121
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,341
that you might have seen walking into the auditorium today.

1122
00:50:33,341 --> 00:50:34,782
And so I really wanted to convey that,

1123
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,802
that space was this wonderfully 3-dimensional dynamic thing, too.

1124
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:38,803
It wasn't just static.

1125
00:50:39,526 --> 00:50:42,947
Looking at other games and the way they kind of present space

1126
00:50:42,947 --> 00:50:45,908
and stars and galaxies, you know, for most games,

1127
00:50:45,908 --> 00:50:49,450
a really big kind of play field is a few hundred stars, you know,

1128
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:52,491
and a few hundred stars is a big play field, but it turns

1129
00:50:52,491 --> 00:50:56,092
out galaxies are bigger than that, like a hundred billion stars

1130
00:50:56,092 --> 00:50:59,533
in a typical spiral galaxy, and which is oddly enough,

1131
00:50:59,533 --> 00:51:02,694
it's also about the same number of neurons in your brain

1132
00:51:02,694 --> 00:51:06,376
and the same number of galaxies in the observed universe.

1133
00:51:06,376 --> 00:51:07,096
Now, why is that?

1134
00:51:07,096 --> 00:51:08,836
I don't know.

1135
00:51:08,836 --> 00:51:09,157
But...

1136
00:51:10,103 --> 00:51:12,706
Anyway, galaxies are large. I mean, they're really large.

1137
00:51:12,706 --> 00:51:15,028
And so I wanted to convey that to the players.

1138
00:51:15,028 --> 00:51:16,909
You know, they have this immense play field,

1139
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:18,590
you know, full of interesting, cool stuff.

1140
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:21,153
Uh, talk a little bit of research material.

1141
00:51:21,153 --> 00:51:23,895
As I said before, you know, I use books a lot.

1142
00:51:23,895 --> 00:51:25,276
Um, and probably read over 100 books

1143
00:51:25,276 --> 00:51:26,237
just researching support alone

1144
00:51:26,237 --> 00:51:28,939
because I get totally obsessed again with the topic.

1145
00:51:28,939 --> 00:51:29,700
Um, also movies and stuff.

1146
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,222
You know, these, you know, became a lot of kind of the, uh,

1147
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,163
templates for the, uh, metagames that we want to do

1148
00:51:34,163 --> 00:51:34,984
in our space game.

1149
00:51:35,524 --> 00:51:37,806
One of my creative heroes is Stanley Kubrick.

1150
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:39,367
Some of my favorite movies were made by him.

1151
00:51:39,367 --> 00:51:43,870
One thing about him is that he was totally obsessive about his research.

1152
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:46,692
And it also took him, you know, a long, like, five years to make a movie,

1153
00:51:46,692 --> 00:51:49,454
which is about how long it takes me to make a game as well.

1154
00:51:49,454 --> 00:51:51,716
But his research was just kind of an amazing process.

1155
00:51:51,716 --> 00:51:53,037
When he did Doctor Strangelove in 64,

1156
00:51:53,037 --> 00:51:57,200
you know, he had these recreations of the war room and the inside of the B-52.

1157
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,982
And when the movie came out, the Air Force actually came to him.

1158
00:52:00,606 --> 00:52:03,131
I thought there was some leak, that somebody was leaking blueprints of a B-52.

1159
00:52:03,131 --> 00:52:07,160
But he actually kind of cobbled this together from public information sources

1160
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,965
and interviewing experts about what it probably looked like,

1161
00:52:09,965 --> 00:52:11,428
and he got it almost dead on.

1162
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:12,370
Um, he was also able to embed...

1163
00:52:12,785 --> 00:52:14,726
really deep messages in innovative forms.

1164
00:52:14,726 --> 00:52:16,647
You know, when he came out with Doctor Strangelove,

1165
00:52:16,647 --> 00:52:18,928
a lot of people at the time in the studio were saying,

1166
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:20,749
this is crazy, we shouldn't do a comedy about nuclear war,

1167
00:52:20,749 --> 00:52:21,870
that's not a joking matter.

1168
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:24,292
But yet, by making it a black comedy,

1169
00:52:24,292 --> 00:52:27,093
he was able to basically reach an audience

1170
00:52:27,093 --> 00:52:29,174
of younger kids that were trying to ignore this,

1171
00:52:29,174 --> 00:52:31,416
and all of a sudden, this is a message they could hear,

1172
00:52:31,416 --> 00:52:33,057
and they went and saw the movie.

1173
00:52:33,057 --> 00:52:34,558
And, you know, the movie was just about that,

1174
00:52:34,558 --> 00:52:36,999
you know, everybody that's involved in this must be mad,

1175
00:52:36,999 --> 00:52:38,860
you know, which is, in fact, what they were calling mad.

1176
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:45,445
And so it was a great way to get this very deep message out in a new form that nobody thought was feasible.

1177
00:52:45,445 --> 00:52:50,149
2001 was really interesting from a research point of view in that how he got space right.

1178
00:52:50,149 --> 00:52:55,833
Unlike almost every other science fiction even since then, you know, every single scene you were dealing with gravity.

1179
00:52:55,833 --> 00:53:00,157
There was no cheat for gravity where everybody is magically walking on the floor because the gravity generator.

1180
00:53:00,157 --> 00:53:03,399
All the space scenes were totally soundless because in fact there is no sound in space,

1181
00:53:03,399 --> 00:53:06,202
even though you hear TIE fighters and things making noises as they fly by.

1182
00:53:06,828 --> 00:53:09,349
He did background research on human anthropology,

1183
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:11,411
interviewed people at NASA,

1184
00:53:11,411 --> 00:53:15,113
the kind of plans that they were building for moon bases and space stations,

1185
00:53:15,113 --> 00:53:17,594
and artificial intelligence experts as to what, you know,

1186
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:20,336
a smart computer of the future might look like and how it might be used.

1187
00:53:20,336 --> 00:53:23,958
Even this scene where, like, Dave gets blasted in with no air

1188
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:25,739
through the vacuum to turn on the pod,

1189
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:28,260
he had read a research paper that the Air Force was doing.

1190
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,121
I don't know why they were doing this,

1191
00:53:29,121 --> 00:53:32,203
but they were seeing how long monkeys could survive in a vacuum.

1192
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:35,411
and they found that they can survive for about a minute, actually with no permanent damage.

1193
00:53:35,411 --> 00:53:39,574
And so he actually based this scene on how long a human could probably survive in a vacuum,

1194
00:53:39,574 --> 00:53:41,575
you know, to turn the airlock knob back on.

1195
00:53:41,575 --> 00:53:44,137
They were also pretty innovative in terms of marketing.

1196
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,818
This is the original poster for 2001.

1197
00:53:45,818 --> 00:53:48,939
And they found at some point, this came out in 1967,

1198
00:53:48,939 --> 00:53:52,281
that a lot of college students were dropping acid and going to see the movie,

1199
00:53:52,281 --> 00:53:53,922
you know, for all the cool visuals and stuff.

1200
00:53:53,922 --> 00:53:55,744
So they redesigned the poster.

1201
00:53:55,744 --> 00:53:59,586
You might notice they changed the tagline as well.

1202
00:54:01,763 --> 00:54:06,965
He did this in conjunction with Arthur C. Clarke, which is one of my favorite science fiction authors.

1203
00:54:06,965 --> 00:54:09,866
And Arthur C. Clarke was similar in that he did a lot of research for his books.

1204
00:54:09,866 --> 00:54:12,667
And his books were almost like a combination of fact and fiction,

1205
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:17,248
which is kind of a really interesting gray area, especially for researching the kinds of things we do.

1206
00:54:17,248 --> 00:54:21,410
There's a very interesting group of books called world-building books

1207
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:26,992
that people use to create fantasy environments for role-playing games or science fiction writing.

1208
00:54:26,992 --> 00:54:30,593
There are some very good websites out there, very good resources that have this as well.

1209
00:54:31,073 --> 00:54:35,577
And Wikipedia just continually gets more valuable to me every day,

1210
00:54:35,577 --> 00:54:38,719
primarily because it's filling in the gaps in these research areas.

1211
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:43,463
It's not really clear whether you're going to find a book about this or a film or what.

1212
00:54:43,463 --> 00:54:47,807
Wikipedia is a great kind of filling in the gaps research resource.

1213
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,107
Oh! Okay.

1214
00:54:48,107 --> 00:54:55,553
I didn't get a chance to do this last year.

1215
00:54:55,553 --> 00:54:56,594
It was too busy.

1216
00:54:57,934 --> 00:55:01,156
But, yeah, this is totally off topic, by the way.

1217
00:55:01,156 --> 00:55:04,658
I mean, this is as off topic as you can get.

1218
00:55:04,658 --> 00:55:05,798
And I love this picture.

1219
00:55:05,798 --> 00:55:08,480
It's like they're going out for a church picnic,

1220
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,721
except they're going to launch a rocket.

1221
00:55:10,721 --> 00:55:12,382
Let's go launch a rocket today.

1222
00:55:12,382 --> 00:55:12,802
Okay.

1223
00:55:12,802 --> 00:55:14,963
I'm going to tell you the story of the Soyuz 23

1224
00:55:14,963 --> 00:55:17,124
that was launched in 1976.

1225
00:55:17,124 --> 00:55:19,085
Cosmonauts Zudov and Rozhdestvsky.

1226
00:55:19,085 --> 00:55:22,067
These were actually military cosmonauts.

1227
00:55:22,067 --> 00:55:22,927
Special...

1228
00:55:23,438 --> 00:55:28,922
core that was trained going up. The Soviets had the very first space station, the Salyut

1229
00:55:28,922 --> 00:55:33,426
series, and they launched six of these. These were scientific space stations, or so we thought.

1230
00:55:33,426 --> 00:55:36,348
It turned out that they had a military space station program as well, and they couldn't

1231
00:55:36,348 --> 00:55:40,051
hide the launches from us, so they just said, oh, we have six Salyuts. But it turned out

1232
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:44,374
that every other one was, in fact, not a Salyut at all, but an Almaz station, the military

1233
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:48,557
station. And they were interleaved, the launches. And it was a great deception, and we didn't

1234
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:50,938
find out until, like, 20 years later about these things.

1235
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:55,344
The Almaz were interesting. They were basically manned spy satellites.

1236
00:55:55,344 --> 00:55:57,226
They had these huge, you know, telescopes

1237
00:55:57,226 --> 00:55:59,309
that the cosmonauts could point as they were flying over

1238
00:55:59,309 --> 00:56:02,413
and photograph whatever ground control wanted photographed.

1239
00:56:03,023 --> 00:56:05,524
At the same time, the US was developing the US Dynastar X-20

1240
00:56:05,524 --> 00:56:12,106
as this kind of re-entry vehicle that maybe could be used as an interceptor in the Russian slot.

1241
00:56:12,106 --> 00:56:17,048
And so they were convinced that if we found out that they had manned spy satellites,

1242
00:56:17,048 --> 00:56:19,129
that we would go up and shoot them down.

1243
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:21,490
So they decided they had to defend this thing.

1244
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:23,811
Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station.

1245
00:56:24,457 --> 00:56:27,860
So in fact, these were the first armed battle stations in orbit.

1246
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:30,583
They were armed with 20mm anti-aircraft cannons

1247
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:33,926
that were bore-sided along the length of the space station.

1248
00:56:33,926 --> 00:56:36,368
They actually, you know, destroyed several targets in target practice,

1249
00:56:36,368 --> 00:56:38,250
you know, satellites at about a mile distance,

1250
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,891
but it was terrifying to fire because

1251
00:56:39,891 --> 00:56:43,374
it had to be tied into the reaction control system of the space station,

1252
00:56:43,374 --> 00:56:46,057
otherwise they would de-orbit the station with the recoil of the gun.

1253
00:56:46,057 --> 00:56:48,499
So, they were pretty risky.

1254
00:56:49,135 --> 00:56:55,179
So these guys pull up in their Soyuz, but the approach computer has them like almost crashing into it, going way too fast.

1255
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:57,941
They didn't trust it, so they shut it off and they did a back burn and all this.

1256
00:56:57,941 --> 00:56:59,402
And before they knew it, they'd wasted all their fuel.

1257
00:56:59,402 --> 00:57:03,025
They didn't have any more fuel to do a manual docking, so they had to abort the mission at that point.

1258
00:57:03,025 --> 00:57:04,806
They never got to dock with the Almaz.

1259
00:57:04,806 --> 00:57:09,309
So they're coming back, and Mission Control sends them the wrong coordinates for reentry,

1260
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:12,712
and they end up coming in like a hundred kilometers off target.

1261
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:16,403
That puts them right in the path, right in the middle of this giant blizzard

1262
00:57:16,403 --> 00:57:18,086
that's blowing through Kazakhstan at the time.

1263
00:57:18,086 --> 00:57:20,950
And the blizzard pushes them another 50 kilometers off target.

1264
00:57:21,461 --> 00:57:25,782
and they end up coming down into scenic Lake Tengiz, right in the middle of it,

1265
00:57:25,782 --> 00:57:31,444
except it's not so scenic because it's like a blizzard and it's 20 degrees below zero at this point,

1266
00:57:31,444 --> 00:57:36,006
and they hit the ice and break through the ice of this frozen lake and start to sink,

1267
00:57:36,006 --> 00:57:39,547
and the parachute drags the whole Soyuz capsule upside down,

1268
00:57:39,547 --> 00:57:44,788
and now these guys are stuck in their spacesuits upside down, bopping up and down in a storm,

1269
00:57:44,788 --> 00:57:46,389
and this is when it starts getting bad.

1270
00:57:48,961 --> 00:57:50,862
The inside of one of these Soyuz is like the inside of an old VW.

1271
00:57:50,862 --> 00:57:53,164
And they're wearing spacesuits. They can't really...

1272
00:57:53,164 --> 00:57:55,806
They've never been able to take off the spacesuits while in that capsule.

1273
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,548
So they had to cut them off with knives.

1274
00:57:57,548 --> 00:57:59,029
And there was an air vent that opened

1275
00:57:59,029 --> 00:58:02,632
because they assumed that they'd be sitting on the ground and they didn't need air.

1276
00:58:02,632 --> 00:58:03,973
And then water was rushing in the capsule at this point.

1277
00:58:03,973 --> 00:58:08,216
And so they were scrambling, grabbed the rags, managed to plug the hole to stop the leak.

1278
00:58:08,216 --> 00:58:10,798
And at this point, they were also out of air

1279
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:13,320
because they, you know, the air vent was open and let air in.

1280
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:18,950
One of the guys happened to be a diver, and so he knew that the real danger was the carbon dioxide poisoning.

1281
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:23,117
And so they had almost no battery life left. They turned off every system, including the radio beacon.

1282
00:58:23,596 --> 00:58:26,377
to find them and he stayed up all night

1283
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:28,878
bobbing upside down in the water and he,

1284
00:58:28,878 --> 00:58:30,858
right before he passed out from the CO2 poisoning,

1285
00:58:30,858 --> 00:58:32,419
he would turn on the CO2 scrubber

1286
00:58:32,419 --> 00:58:33,779
just long enough to get clear-headed again

1287
00:58:33,779 --> 00:58:35,360
and then turn it back off to save the battery power

1288
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,241
and basically stayed all night doing that.

1289
00:58:37,241 --> 00:58:39,221
And the next day, he cleared a little bit

1290
00:58:39,221 --> 00:58:41,182
and an intrepid helicopter pilot saw the part

1291
00:58:41,182 --> 00:58:43,143
of the parachute cable sticking out of the ice,

1292
00:58:43,143 --> 00:58:44,283
managed to hook it with the helicopter

1293
00:58:44,283 --> 00:58:45,984
and drag them like five kilometers to the shoreline.

1294
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:48,084
And to their amazement, when they opened the capsule,

1295
00:58:48,084 --> 00:58:49,985
both cosmonauts were still alive.

1296
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:51,085
So this one has a happy ending.

1297
00:58:51,085 --> 00:58:52,666
That's the Russian Space Minute.

1298
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:00,511
So back to the research.

1299
00:59:00,511 --> 00:59:03,613
When we do research, one of the other things we want to do

1300
00:59:03,613 --> 00:59:07,375
is establish kind of what is the style, texture of the world?

1301
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:10,116
And this is almost more in a visual kinesthetic sense.

1302
00:59:10,116 --> 00:59:10,797
Is it real?

1303
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:11,477
Is it toy-like?

1304
00:59:11,477 --> 00:59:12,898
How familiar does it feel?

1305
00:59:12,898 --> 00:59:14,419
Is it a caricature?

1306
00:59:14,419 --> 00:59:16,920
In sport, we actually very early identified this kind of split

1307
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,802
in our team, kind of between what we call the science

1308
00:59:19,802 --> 00:59:23,184
team and the cute team, in terms of how should this thing look?

1309
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,385
And these are kind of representative samples

1310
00:59:25,385 --> 00:59:26,046
from both teams.

1311
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:30,627
Uh, we eventually decided that we really, whenever possible,

1312
00:59:30,627 --> 00:59:33,367
wanted the players to be able to make that choice themselves in the editors.

1313
00:59:33,367 --> 00:59:35,668
And we tried to make the editors fairly malleable,

1314
00:59:35,668 --> 00:59:38,088
and that would be the primary dimension that they were kind of exploring.

1315
00:59:38,088 --> 00:59:41,309
Um, some of the research material spanned both of these things.

1316
00:59:41,309 --> 00:59:42,870
We kind of went from fairly realistic stuff.

1317
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:43,970
This is the work of Dougal Dixon,

1318
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:47,231
who does a lot of kind of imaginary zoology stuff.

1319
00:59:47,231 --> 00:59:49,911
He actually also later worked on the series The Future is Wild

1320
00:59:49,911 --> 00:59:51,852
for the Discovery Channel, which was an excellent series

1321
00:59:51,852 --> 00:59:53,372
about maybe the future of evolution on Earth.

1322
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,382
More imaginative stuff, we found great sources.

1323
00:59:56,382 --> 01:00:00,384
Disney did these series of movies with NASA back in the 50s about space.

1324
01:00:00,384 --> 01:00:03,126
And their animators were imagining what life on Mars might look like.

1325
01:00:03,126 --> 01:00:05,907
This is a great movie. I don't know if any of y'all saw this movie.

1326
01:00:05,907 --> 01:00:09,690
It had these really imaginative plans and things.

1327
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:12,992
And it was like this French, Czechoslovakian, weird animated thing.

1328
01:00:12,992 --> 01:00:15,873
But still, the creatures and things in there were great.

1329
01:00:15,873 --> 01:00:18,815
As far as vehicles, you know, this is, like, great, Thunderbirds.

1330
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,836
You know, these toy-like feel.

1331
01:00:19,836 --> 01:00:24,178
It turns out that Thunderbird 1 was actually based upon the Soyuz launcher, by the way.

1332
01:00:25,527 --> 01:00:28,649
And then these things, which I showed a little bit of last year,

1333
01:00:28,649 --> 01:00:32,531
these comic book covers, and these are definitely going more in the cute kind of caricature direction.

1334
01:00:32,531 --> 01:00:35,933
And it was just amazing how many of these things I managed to dig up.

1335
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:38,935
And each one of these is several years' worth of issues.

1336
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:42,537
Future, future, Captain Future, Man of Tomorrow, Tales of Wonder, Uncanny.

1337
01:00:42,537 --> 01:00:43,697
They just go on and on.

1338
01:00:43,697 --> 01:00:48,720
And each one of these things has this interesting combination of an interesting world,

1339
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,821
maybe some cool vehicles, some aliens.

1340
01:00:50,821 --> 01:00:53,903
Exactly the stuff that we wanted to have in our game.

1341
01:00:54,555 --> 01:00:58,561
My animation director, Bob King, actually did a couple for us,

1342
01:00:58,561 --> 01:01:00,263
kind of in that style,

1343
01:01:00,263 --> 01:01:05,329
just to get a sense of what that would feel like.

1344
01:01:05,988 --> 01:01:11,875
It always helps to actually get like a real sample that's relevant to what you're doing, you know, in that style, and it really helps you kind of visualize it.

1345
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:16,100
Um, this is actually the very first box I designed for Spore way, way back.

1346
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,442
You know, one of the first things I always do when I do a game is I design a box.

1347
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:24,990
And I was trying to give people a sense for what I was thinking, and it's, what I'm thinking has changed a lot since then, but this is kind of my original title and name for it.

1348
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:26,250
This is the back of the box.

1349
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,391
And so I do the back of the box with bullet points,

1350
01:01:28,391 --> 01:01:29,832
little screenshots, you know.

1351
01:01:29,832 --> 01:01:31,173
And in fact, I put this on a real box

1352
01:01:31,173 --> 01:01:32,833
with something inside of it so it feels heavy

1353
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:34,714
so I can hand it to somebody and they can imagine,

1354
01:01:34,714 --> 01:01:36,235
oh, yeah, I'm in a software store holding this.

1355
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:38,076
Would I buy it?

1356
01:01:38,076 --> 01:01:40,077
If you zoom in here, you'll see that this is early on

1357
01:01:40,077 --> 01:01:42,538
when I was thinking that we would be colonizing

1358
01:01:42,538 --> 01:01:44,819
at sublight velocities and how exciting that would be.

1359
01:01:44,819 --> 01:01:45,579
I kind of changed my mind.

1360
01:01:45,579 --> 01:01:48,461
These are the system requirements

1361
01:01:48,461 --> 01:01:50,101
that I was estimating at the time.

1362
01:01:59,637 --> 01:02:04,039
Now, you know, early in this phase, we wanted to go through this process of deconstruction

1363
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:09,082
and reconstruction of creatures, vehicles, buildings, planets, all the stuff in the game.

1364
01:02:09,082 --> 01:02:12,243
We actually had a lot of people come in and say, draw an alien creature. If you could

1365
01:02:12,243 --> 01:02:15,445
design a creature in the game, what would it be? And we had them do drawings. And we

1366
01:02:15,445 --> 01:02:19,867
studied the drawings. More recently, our fan sites have started doing that. This is what

1367
01:02:19,867 --> 01:02:22,829
I want to build in Spore. These are from one of our fans, Hydro Mancer.

1368
01:02:23,525 --> 01:02:26,586
These are drawings that he's done of things that he wants to do in the game.

1369
01:02:26,586 --> 01:02:29,747
And it's really instructive for us to go look at those expectations and say,

1370
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:31,928
can we measure our editors against this?

1371
01:02:31,928 --> 01:02:35,589
This is actually a really cool little prototype that appeared,

1372
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:37,390
I think, after we showed Spore last year at GDC.

1373
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:40,912
These students at USC took their first level, the cell level,

1374
01:02:40,912 --> 01:02:43,453
and built it, basically, you know, in Flash.

1375
01:02:43,453 --> 01:02:45,153
A very cool game.

1376
01:02:45,153 --> 01:02:48,014
And it's great when other people do your prototypes for free,

1377
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,515
you know, without even asking like that.

1378
01:02:50,945 --> 01:02:56,010
I got to meet Jenova Chin just like two days ago, and he's a brilliant guy with a great aesthetic.

1379
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:58,492
We also hired this conceptual artist, Christian Schur, who came in,

1380
01:02:58,492 --> 01:03:02,356
and we had him draw all sorts of things that we then went through this deconstructive process with.

1381
01:03:02,356 --> 01:03:08,281
We had him draw things in different styles, like scary aliens, maybe goofy things.

1382
01:03:09,107 --> 01:03:11,629
you know, other things that were just kind of odd and alien-like ways.

1383
01:03:11,629 --> 01:03:16,512
Um, after taking all these creatures, some of which were related, some of which weren't,

1384
01:03:16,512 --> 01:03:18,153
we then started deconstructing them into parts.

1385
01:03:18,153 --> 01:03:21,636
You know, if we had to pull sets of parts off of these things, what would they be?

1386
01:03:21,636 --> 01:03:25,919
And, um, we found that the eyes and the mouths were like the most expressive parts that we could pull off.

1387
01:03:25,919 --> 01:03:28,160
But then we had all the other ones, hands, wings.

1388
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:32,402
And then at some point we started putting these deconstructed parts into a taxonomy.

1389
01:03:32,402 --> 01:03:35,904
How do we now sort these parts with some sort of evolutionary relationship?

1390
01:03:35,904 --> 01:03:40,127
You know, what is the path in which a player might explore these on a tech tree, for instance?

1391
01:03:40,127 --> 01:03:41,708
And what is the functional categorization?

1392
01:03:41,708 --> 01:03:43,889
So these might be carnivorous mouths up here.

1393
01:03:43,889 --> 01:03:45,890
These might be herbivorous mouths over there.

1394
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:48,591
And so we're just getting some sense of how we can kind of take these whole constructs

1395
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:50,653
and pull them into lower and lower level pieces

1396
01:03:50,653 --> 01:03:52,534
and then establish the relationships between those pieces.

1397
01:03:52,534 --> 01:03:54,915
And then we move them into modeling, you know,

1398
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:57,136
because it's a big difference going from kind of illustration to modeling.

1399
01:03:57,804 --> 01:03:59,666
And then we start building larger sets of these things

1400
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:00,647
that we're actually going to use in game.

1401
01:04:00,647 --> 01:04:02,809
Each one of these parts also, by the way, has morph channels.

1402
01:04:02,809 --> 01:04:05,091
So each one represents the center of, in fact,

1403
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,733
a fairly wide morph space where you can stretch the toes out

1404
01:04:07,733 --> 01:04:09,795
or make them curly or add this or that feature to it.

1405
01:04:09,795 --> 01:04:12,097
And then eventually reconstruct features

1406
01:04:12,097 --> 01:04:15,040
after going through that deconstruction-reconstruction process

1407
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,543
that I mentioned with the generative artists,

1408
01:04:17,543 --> 01:04:18,884
doing it with the content here as well.

1409
01:04:18,884 --> 01:04:20,465
Same thing with textures.

1410
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:24,358
brainstorm ideas, then go out and actually develop the

1411
01:04:24,358 --> 01:04:26,820
particular scripts, apply them, see how close we got to the

1412
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:27,941
targets.

1413
01:04:27,941 --> 01:04:29,742
Vehicles, pretty much the same thing.

1414
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:32,604
Conceptual, air, land, sea, build the models, texture,

1415
01:04:32,604 --> 01:04:33,085
buildings.

1416
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:36,713
Same thing, blocks, models.

1417
01:04:36,713 --> 01:04:39,095
And then finally put them in a scene.

1418
01:04:39,095 --> 01:04:41,217
Planets were a little more elaborate.

1419
01:04:41,217 --> 01:04:44,741
On the planets, we actually started with a lot of very simple descriptions

1420
01:04:44,741 --> 01:04:48,104
of the variety of worlds we wanted players to be able to create in the game.

1421
01:04:48,104 --> 01:04:50,747
We took a few of those and we went really deep on them,

1422
01:04:50,747 --> 01:04:52,549
looking at the materials that we might find on that world,

1423
01:04:52,549 --> 01:04:53,970
how that might influence the coloring,

1424
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:58,735
what sort of items, vehicles, trees, landforms we might find on those worlds.

1425
01:04:59,483 --> 01:05:02,586
And then developing these kind of pictures showing the world.

1426
01:05:02,586 --> 01:05:06,290
Another process was actually taking worlds and going through and building a backstory.

1427
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:08,232
What sort of cities would they build?

1428
01:05:08,232 --> 01:05:09,533
What would their industry be?

1429
01:05:09,533 --> 01:05:10,734
What would their sociology be like?

1430
01:05:10,734 --> 01:05:12,435
What are the elements of their technology?

1431
01:05:12,435 --> 01:05:14,337
And so these are all from the same world,

1432
01:05:14,337 --> 01:05:18,741
kind of looking at different snapshots of how these people live and how their world looks.

1433
01:05:18,741 --> 01:05:22,445
And then eventually developing the characters, reassembling it all into one scene.

1434
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:26,472
for the final rendering. And, you know, it isn't that we want the players to build exactly

1435
01:05:26,472 --> 01:05:31,817
this world. Each one of these worlds represents some outpost of this space, this creative

1436
01:05:31,817 --> 01:05:34,920
space that we want them to be able to build themselves. And so they're like almost eigenvalues

1437
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:41,325
around the planet space. Now, eventually we get to the geology level and we're actually

1438
01:05:41,325 --> 01:05:45,288
developing scripts that will carve out and make these planets. Some are more fantastic,

1439
01:05:45,288 --> 01:05:46,930
some are more realistic.

1440
01:05:47,668 --> 01:05:50,289
We have one guy, Christian Stratton, who's kind of like my Magrathea.

1441
01:05:50,289 --> 01:05:53,690
This is the guy that builds my planets for me, one of my artists.

1442
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:58,231
He's actually been building a taxonomy of what types of planets we would find in different zones,

1443
01:05:58,231 --> 01:06:03,372
how they should look, plus their relative distribution in the universe.

1444
01:06:03,372 --> 01:06:06,413
We have some that are very out there, imaginative, more Dr. Seuss,

1445
01:06:06,413 --> 01:06:09,274
that we want to be very rare. If you find one of those, you get excited about it.

1446
01:06:09,274 --> 01:06:12,675
Most of them are more terrestrial, so there is this concept of kind of...

1447
01:06:13,868 --> 01:06:19,273
whimsical equals rarity, that as you're exploring the galaxy, you feel like you've discovered treasures.

1448
01:06:19,273 --> 01:06:21,374
As we pull away from the planets, we get out to all these cool Hubble pictures.

1449
01:06:21,374 --> 01:06:25,778
And we're trying to recreate all these in 3D. These are actually from the game,

1450
01:06:25,778 --> 01:06:31,742
game versions of all the Hubble objects, so they're three-dimensional things that you can kind of move around,

1451
01:06:31,742 --> 01:06:33,063
interact with in space level.

1452
01:06:33,063 --> 01:06:38,067
Now to wind down really quick here...

1453
01:06:38,067 --> 01:06:40,529
Okay, back to Drake's equation.

1454
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:40,589
Now...

1455
01:06:41,025 --> 01:06:42,906
Clearly all these values are not zero.

1456
01:06:42,906 --> 01:06:45,767
And in fact, none of those values can be zero.

1457
01:06:45,767 --> 01:06:48,228
If any of those values were zero, we wouldn't be here.

1458
01:06:48,228 --> 01:06:49,888
So each one of these values has to be something.

1459
01:06:49,888 --> 01:06:52,369
If we take fairly pessimistic assumptions

1460
01:06:52,369 --> 01:06:54,649
and we bump them all up to .01,

1461
01:06:54,649 --> 01:06:57,650
and most of these are fractional, so it's like 1%,

1462
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:59,471
and then we just take those numbers

1463
01:06:59,471 --> 01:07:00,771
and we multiply them times the, you know,

1464
01:07:00,771 --> 01:07:03,292
100 billion stars in a typical galaxy

1465
01:07:03,292 --> 01:07:06,213
times the 100 billion galaxies that we know of,

1466
01:07:06,213 --> 01:07:08,414
we still end up with a pretty large number of aliens out there,

1467
01:07:08,414 --> 01:07:09,574
about 100 million in this case.

1468
01:07:10,504 --> 01:07:16,288
That's a large number, but on the other hand, that's only about one alien species per thousand galaxies.

1469
01:07:16,288 --> 01:07:19,431
So even if we bump those numbers up a bit, we're still talking about

1470
01:07:19,431 --> 01:07:25,876
probably less than one alien species per galaxy, especially if they spread into a galaxy very rapidly.

1471
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:28,798
So my conclusions from SETI, not that you really care,

1472
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:34,243
is that they're out there, but they're probably really far away, not in our galaxy.

1473
01:07:34,243 --> 01:07:36,484
And that has a lot of implications for the search for SETI,

1474
01:07:36,484 --> 01:07:39,247
that we should be looking further out to distant galaxies.

1475
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:44,942
My research conclusions are that, and this is something I do always at the beginning of every project,

1476
01:07:44,942 --> 01:07:48,843
is I take a lot of time to consider it, and don't get too committed to any one idea too early.

1477
01:07:48,843 --> 01:07:52,305
And that's what I'm doing a lot of the reading and the research phase.

1478
01:07:52,305 --> 01:07:57,147
I cast usually a very wide net over subjects, and a lot of times, like in the Sims,

1479
01:07:57,147 --> 01:08:01,789
which started as an architectural simulator and led more to behavioral stuff,

1480
01:08:01,789 --> 01:08:05,910
I'll find myself taking very interesting kind of twists and turns through that research path.

1481
01:08:06,596 --> 01:08:09,502
And what you really want to know is what 90% of the material is irrelevant to that core idea,

1482
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:13,372
because that core idea is going to be shifting around underneath your feet all the time,

1483
01:08:13,372 --> 01:08:16,579
and you need to kind of understand the region of space it can shift in.

1484
01:08:17,191 --> 01:08:19,653
I have no problem with this one.

1485
01:08:19,653 --> 01:08:22,595
But getting totally obsessive about your subject, I find, helps a lot.

1486
01:08:22,595 --> 01:08:23,696
You know, it drives the interest.

1487
01:08:23,696 --> 01:08:27,459
You know, whenever you see anything that's relevant to what you're working on,

1488
01:08:27,459 --> 01:08:28,720
you'll see it more readily on the shelf,

1489
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,301
or somebody mentions something, or an article.

1490
01:08:30,301 --> 01:08:33,443
You'll just find yourself absorbing this stuff so readily

1491
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:34,504
that it's almost effortless.

1492
01:08:34,504 --> 01:08:38,127
And then you want to cultivate that onto your team, you know,

1493
01:08:38,127 --> 01:08:40,068
as you talk to your team about this stuff, you know,

1494
01:08:40,068 --> 01:08:41,089
and get them interested in it.

1495
01:08:41,089 --> 01:08:43,351
Pretty soon you'll be talking about this stuff over lunch,

1496
01:08:43,351 --> 01:08:45,292
and you're all really enjoying it and learning from each other.

1497
01:08:46,472 --> 01:08:50,034
And this kind of, you know, comes to the fact that eventually you're going to become a teacher.

1498
01:08:50,034 --> 01:08:52,255
Not just to the people on your team, but to the people in your game.

1499
01:08:52,255 --> 01:08:55,457
You know, these deep lessons that you're learning through research

1500
01:08:55,457 --> 01:08:59,379
are eventually, through several filters, going to end up, you know, kind of as a player.

1501
01:08:59,379 --> 01:09:01,780
And this is one thing that is probably the most important to me,

1502
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:05,742
is the fact that we always have the opportunity to change our players at a very deep level.

1503
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:09,204
I mean, to the point where we can influence their future career, for instance.

1504
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:11,842
And that's something that we shouldn't take lightly.

1505
01:09:11,842 --> 01:09:14,865
And it's something that we shouldn't squander.

1506
01:09:14,865 --> 01:09:19,069
So we should probably make the best use of that whenever we can.

1507
01:09:19,069 --> 01:09:19,369
So thank you.
