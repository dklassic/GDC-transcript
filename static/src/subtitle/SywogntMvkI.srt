1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,481
This is my talk, Platforms are People Too,

2
00:00:07,581 --> 00:00:08,942
The Importance of Finding Your Champion.

3
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:11,983
Resume timer, okay.

4
00:00:13,243 --> 00:00:14,724
Thanks to GDC for having me here,

5
00:00:14,864 --> 00:00:15,964
and thanks to you guys for spending

6
00:00:15,984 --> 00:00:17,645
your precious GDC time with me.

7
00:00:18,365 --> 00:00:19,646
And I'm excited to have an opportunity

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,766
to speak on this topic,

9
00:00:21,407 --> 00:00:23,207
and share what I've learned in my time in the industry.

10
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:25,328
And I gave an earlier version of this talk

11
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:27,229
at a couple places last year internationally,

12
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:30,450
but this is the fancy jazzed up GDC version,

13
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,851
which was supposed to do a thing when I said that.

14
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,123
Please hold.

15
00:00:41,226 --> 00:00:41,547
Or not.

16
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:45,470
Next slide.

17
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:48,132
Okay, it worked that way.

18
00:00:48,252 --> 00:00:48,532
All right.

19
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:52,035
So glad this is being recorded.

20
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:55,597
All right, so I'm Nick Suttner.

21
00:00:55,717 --> 00:00:57,339
I'm a writer, designer, consultant.

22
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,201
I'm gonna give you a decent bit of background on myself,

23
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:02,703
but hopefully you'll see why that's important

24
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:03,763
and how it leads into this topic.

25
00:01:05,814 --> 00:01:09,756
So, like a lot of people, I started working in games in retail around 2004.

26
00:01:10,756 --> 00:01:16,019
I had a lot of first-hand customer experience there, championing games,

27
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:19,220
and it felt like being on the front lines of the industry.

28
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,722
And sometimes I feel like I've sort of only gotten further from that in my career,

29
00:01:22,762 --> 00:01:23,802
which is a weird feeling.

30
00:01:25,813 --> 00:01:27,114
I handled this highlight on the corner there.

31
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:30,977
That's Shadow of the Colossus, that's the PS4 remake,

32
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:32,418
but back with the original release,

33
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:34,940
I got the most pre-orders of Shadow of the Colossus

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,781
in my district, because I was a champion for the game.

35
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:37,862
I loved telling people about it.

36
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:40,644
And there was an interesting experience

37
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:41,904
where people would come in and they'd say,

38
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:43,526
what's cool, what should I play,

39
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:45,127
especially people that didn't buy a lot of games.

40
00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:47,428
And I had the opportunity to walk over to the shelf

41
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:48,909
and grab something and say, like,

42
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:49,850
you should play this thing.

43
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,131
And they would come back two weeks later.

44
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:53,752
and say, oh, that was awesome, what else do you have?

45
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:54,952
Which is a pretty rare experience,

46
00:01:55,012 --> 00:01:55,953
and I really enjoyed that,

47
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:57,433
and that was maybe my first taste

48
00:01:58,594 --> 00:02:00,815
of being able to sort of recommend things,

49
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:01,915
and I got a taste for it.

50
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:04,356
I also had a gaming blog at the time

51
00:02:04,396 --> 00:02:06,537
with my friend Tom McShay, who's sitting back there,

52
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,599
who has that in his face, he's not in here.

53
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,660
But, and that's what sort of helped get me to my first E3,

54
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,821
and I got more interested in it,

55
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:16,722
and moved out to California here in 2007.

56
00:02:19,185 --> 00:02:23,446
I got my first industry job writing for EGM magazine, which I had grown up reading, and

57
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:24,546
writing for 1up.com.

58
00:02:25,126 --> 00:02:30,208
And this was my first cover story, which also ended up being the last issue of EGM, so I

59
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:31,408
guess I killed the magazine.

60
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:39,190
And while I was there, though, at 1up especially, I reviewed a lot of games for those outlets,

61
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,691
especially some of the early seminal indie games on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

62
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:48,592
And I got comfortable championing smaller, more interesting games, and championing them

63
00:02:48,632 --> 00:02:49,513
came naturally to me.

64
00:02:50,513 --> 00:02:56,055
And I'll make a note here of N Plus and Braid, two of my favorite games, and I'll bring those

65
00:02:56,115 --> 00:02:56,615
up again later.

66
00:03:00,576 --> 00:03:02,337
If you're dying to read these, you can read them later on.

67
00:03:02,477 --> 00:03:03,897
Well, I don't know if there's a lot left, actually.

68
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:05,598
One up sort of comes and goes.

69
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,510
So I moved over to PlayStation in 2007,

70
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:11,011
and I worked there for seven years.

71
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:14,132
Started in product evaluation and worked with big publishers

72
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:16,673
like Rockstar and Activision, but I was always the happiest

73
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:18,313
when I got to work with independent developers.

74
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:21,254
And I was vocal about the games I cared about,

75
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:23,495
and people got to know me as sort of a content expert

76
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:26,716
in that space, and as an advocate for smaller games.

77
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:29,333
And I became the lead account manager

78
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:31,416
in developer relations on that team.

79
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,837
I worked with hundreds of developers

80
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:34,419
and helped make indie games a part

81
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,981
of the PlayStation culture in a bigger way,

82
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,203
especially leading up to the PlayStation 4 launch.

83
00:03:39,064 --> 00:03:40,947
I signed a lot of games while I was at PlayStation.

84
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:42,388
All these ones.

85
00:03:43,244 --> 00:03:46,589
and a bunch more, and I worked with all of those devs

86
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:47,790
to help them release their game,

87
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,273
and served as an advocate within Sony

88
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:51,154
throughout the process.

89
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:54,419
And I spent tens of hours, and sometimes hundreds of hours

90
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:55,840
on each of these games of work,

91
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,003
so it was a lot of my time spent on this stuff.

92
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:01,825
And again, here I'll call out The Witness and N++,

93
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:05,306
both sort of the sequels or spiritual sequels

94
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:08,367
to things before that I'd championed in the press.

95
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,808
And so I'd sort of gotten to those developers

96
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:13,189
and so those relationships were sort of mutually beneficial.

97
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,511
And then I moved over to Oculus in 2016.

98
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,511
I worked there for about 14 months,

99
00:04:21,372 --> 00:04:23,812
again, advocating for smaller, more experimental games,

100
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:26,453
and found out that a lot of the same challenges exist

101
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:28,454
for developers in VR, like visibility.

102
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:32,604
Especially when most press aren't really covering VR in a meaningful way yet.

103
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:39,170
I also along the way wrote a couple books on the work of Fumito Ueda while I was working

104
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:39,931
those day jobs.

105
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:44,815
And if you remember when I was a champion for Shadow of the Colossus back in my EB Games

106
00:04:44,835 --> 00:04:48,238
days, well it became my favorite game and my book is basically a love letter to it.

107
00:04:48,818 --> 00:04:52,502
So I used to have to champion games one by one at the store, and by this point I had

108
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,284
a larger platform to speak from to champion something that I loved.

109
00:04:58,122 --> 00:04:59,242
And now I'm a game developer.

110
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,725
I've actually been independent myself for longer than I worked at Oculus, which is weird

111
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:05,045
because I guess I wasn't there too long.

112
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:08,667
But this is a shot from a board game prototype I'm working on.

113
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,269
But I'm working as a writer and an editor.

114
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:15,731
I contributed to Celeste and Guacamelee 2 and Escape.

115
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:20,534
I've done consulting work for a bunch of developers, including several that I work with at PlayStation.

116
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:24,456
I'm also an advisor on Untitled Goose Game.

117
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:27,765
I just wanted an excuse to put a big goose in here.

118
00:05:28,566 --> 00:05:32,147
And also working on a few of my own game projects and writing some upcoming games and doing

119
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:33,208
biz dev for a few of them.

120
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,929
So you know a bit about my background.

121
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:44,312
I've been a champion across retail and in the press and at PlayStation and at Oculus

122
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:45,033
and in print.

123
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:49,838
And there's really others like me at every big company.

124
00:05:49,878 --> 00:05:51,239
There's people who care about interesting,

125
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,781
artful, diverse games across PC and mobile

126
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:56,082
and VR and console.

127
00:05:57,783 --> 00:05:59,625
And if you only remember one thing from my talk,

128
00:06:00,045 --> 00:06:01,026
it should probably be this.

129
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:03,547
It's that companies don't care about your games,

130
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:04,928
people care about your games.

131
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:10,641
And you might ask why this distinction is really important,

132
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:12,202
and this is sort of the whole point of my talk.

133
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:15,244
Developers often ask these questions.

134
00:06:15,284 --> 00:06:17,366
They ask, will Microsoft care about my game?

135
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:19,327
Why does Nintendo care about my game?

136
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:20,988
How can I get Sony to feature my game?

137
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:22,829
And I think these are really just

138
00:06:22,869 --> 00:06:24,210
fundamentally the wrong questions.

139
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:28,694
Really the right question you should be asking yourself

140
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:30,135
is who will help fight for my game?

141
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:36,651
Because really I believe that any promotion, support, or funding of your game happens because somebody cares about it.

142
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:39,333
This is true of platforms, publishers, press.

143
00:06:39,914 --> 00:06:45,238
People often refer to Sony's like indie program, and there was never a program really. Nothing formalized.

144
00:06:45,258 --> 00:06:46,879
It was just people who cared about indie games.

145
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,382
And I should say too, by the way, this talk isn't about getting your game funded,

146
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:54,945
but I think finding your champion is also a critical first step towards funding.

147
00:06:57,802 --> 00:06:59,983
And this talk also might feel sort of like Video Games 101

148
00:07:00,844 --> 00:07:02,485
to someone who's released a successful game

149
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,986
and seen the results of this sort of thing,

150
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:05,847
but for everyone else, I think its importance

151
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:07,008
really can't be overstated.

152
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:12,812
And also, this was the best image I found

153
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,253
when I looked for Video Games 101,

154
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,055
because I like the bold choice of intercapping video games.

155
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:20,117
And it's a kid's YouTube channel,

156
00:07:20,137 --> 00:07:22,779
so you probably should like and subscribe and comment on it.

157
00:07:24,246 --> 00:07:28,469
And also, though, even I should say for experienced or successful indies, I think you can always

158
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,450
use a reminder of this.

159
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,912
And your game probably sold well because you made a great game, but somewhere along the

160
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,335
way someone else had to fight for it and chose to promote it.

161
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:39,838
And also this talk is not just for indies.

162
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,339
AAA needs their champions too.

163
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:44,421
They might have an easier starting point, but they still need someone to fight for them

164
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:45,942
internally, and I've seen this firsthand.

165
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:51,923
So sustainable game development isn't just about making your game.

166
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:57,859
So many developers focus on making a great game and then don't spend the time telling people about it.

167
00:07:58,924 --> 00:08:01,106
Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you to silence your phones

168
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,268
and please fill out the evaluation afterwards,

169
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:04,629
but you're gonna do that anyways.

170
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,893
So sometimes developers don't even tell

171
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:10,574
their launch platform about the game really,

172
00:08:10,594 --> 00:08:12,616
and they just submit it to certification when it's done,

173
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:13,917
which seems crazy to me.

174
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:17,420
And a lot of developers just don't even upload a video

175
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,661
with their game, and you have to ask

176
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:21,063
why a storefront would be excited to promote a game

177
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:22,725
when people are gonna have a hard time

178
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:23,625
finding out more about it.

179
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:26,007
I tweeted this recently, I said,

180
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,387
if you don't have a trailer ready to launch

181
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:28,808
alongside your game on the storefront,

182
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:31,208
you're not ready to release your game full stop.

183
00:08:32,189 --> 00:08:33,189
And I had a couple of people saying

184
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:34,150
that they just didn't have time

185
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,270
while they were finishing their game,

186
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,491
and to me, you really shouldn't consider your game finished

187
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:38,831
until you're ready to launch it properly,

188
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:40,112
that's all part of the process.

189
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:42,232
And you shouldn't really be committing your date

190
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:43,753
to fans or a publisher,

191
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:46,574
because I think having all of this ready

192
00:08:46,654 --> 00:08:47,714
should dictate your date,

193
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,255
not just release based on when the game

194
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:50,936
is gonna be finished.

195
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:56,091
And games almost never do well purely organically.

196
00:08:56,511 --> 00:08:58,132
Sometimes people just don't show up to buy them.

197
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:01,133
And some developers feel like releasing a game

198
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,214
on a console is enough to have decent sales,

199
00:09:03,414 --> 00:09:04,915
and I can tell you that that's not right.

200
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,637
And sometimes games go viral and word of mouth is enough,

201
00:09:08,697 --> 00:09:09,798
but you can never count on that,

202
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:11,258
so you should never plan for it.

203
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:13,520
The rest of the time, you really do need a champion

204
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,941
to help connect a great game to its potential fans.

205
00:09:18,263 --> 00:09:21,226
And once a game has a bad launch, it's much harder to get future promotion.

206
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,370
And it makes sense, because why would a storefront want to repromote something

207
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,412
that didn't make them any money the first time around?

208
00:09:26,452 --> 00:09:28,073
That's really their primary goal.

209
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:33,579
So I'm going to talk about how platforms work.

210
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,382
My background is primarily on the platform side, so that's going to be my focus.

211
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:38,484
And we'll touch a bit on publishers and press later.

212
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:41,027
But a lot of this is relevant to working with them as well.

213
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,081
And this is also relevant for finding champions, I think,

214
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:46,625
who are streamers or YouTubers and non-traditional marketing

215
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:47,526
and PR channels.

216
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:49,088
But that'll be a different talk.

217
00:09:49,108 --> 00:09:53,293
So I'm going to give you sort of an overview of how platforms

218
00:09:53,353 --> 00:09:53,794
are set up.

219
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,078
Content teams are typically the game experts.

220
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:58,340
Oh, wait, sorry.

221
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,641
Hold on, let's talk about those first.

222
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,375
Yeah, so we have the sort of promotional teams.

223
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:06,796
And so we have the store teams at a platform,

224
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:10,517
marketing teams, PR and social teams, the events teams.

225
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:13,278
And then we have a content group sort of separately.

226
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:15,958
And those people are the game experts basically

227
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:18,939
across consoles, PC, mobile, VR, this is true everywhere.

228
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,260
These are basically what you would call third party

229
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,440
or developer relations, product evaluation,

230
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,741
account management, that's usually the same thing.

231
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:28,542
And that's where your champion is going to reside.

232
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:35,039
And promotion often goes, those people go to the content people and they say,

233
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:36,960
OK, what games are cool? What should we be featuring?

234
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,441
What should we be talking about on the platform?

235
00:10:38,861 --> 00:10:41,303
And the content team says, well, it's probably Ape Out,

236
00:10:41,323 --> 00:10:42,864
because that's an amazing game.

237
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:45,108
And so that's what we should feature this week

238
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:46,369
and talk about on all of our channels.

239
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:48,631
And people running digital storefronts

240
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:50,552
tend to be experts at running storefronts,

241
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:51,834
but probably not at games.

242
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,296
And the people working at the storefronts,

243
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:56,638
usually their goals, their KPIs,

244
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,099
are to make the most money every day.

245
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,660
So they're going to default to promoting

246
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,402
the most reliable things in the biggest games

247
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:03,444
that are already successful and already making money.

248
00:11:04,485 --> 00:11:05,606
So it's up to the content people

249
00:11:05,686 --> 00:11:07,687
to sort of help steer that and tell them about new stuff

250
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:10,210
that they should consider promoting as an alternate.

251
00:11:13,252 --> 00:11:16,435
And every time there's an event at a GDC or an E3 or wherever,

252
00:11:17,536 --> 00:11:20,018
the events team is going to ask the content team what games they should feature.

253
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:23,821
So again, that's going to come back to that same champion helping feature your game at an event.

254
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:28,440
And these are also the same groups who are going to promote your game out into the world,

255
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,260
and ideally they should be doing most of the work.

256
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:34,722
The caveat being that you can't really ever rely on any of these things, so you still

257
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:38,983
should plan on doing as much promotion as possible yourself, and that platforms don't

258
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:42,844
really tend to create promotions from scratch, but they'll very often boost your signal.

259
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,361
You know, Apple has a store editorial team as well.

260
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:49,143
You should submit great assets with your game.

261
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:52,846
They care a lot about how your games make their platform look.

262
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:56,829
I assume Google and Stadia are also going to have some sort of storefront, and if it

263
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,431
does, I can pretty much guarantee this is going to hold true there as well.

264
00:12:01,332 --> 00:12:04,154
Steam still makes editorial decisions about what to promote.

265
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:08,337
Even if a lot of it ends up being algorithmic, those first few hours of your launch can make

266
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:09,718
a huge difference and be really important.

267
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:13,139
And all these organizations are full of people.

268
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,781
Everyone has their own tastes and likes and dislikes and their own priorities.

269
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,763
You know, a caveat being that there's different ranges of skills and empowerment and not everyone

270
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,784
can help you as much as everyone else and sometimes you have to find the right person.

271
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:30,966
And some platforms are more automated than others and still ask you to, you know, email

272
00:12:31,026 --> 00:12:34,227
an alias instead of a person, but there's always people at the other end of those aliases

273
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,088
and you can still do your best to connect with someone.

274
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:44,493
So briefly, just for some context, these were my priorities I felt like when I was working at the big platforms.

275
00:12:46,874 --> 00:12:50,276
My first priority was to the players, to sort of share cool games to more people.

276
00:12:53,518 --> 00:12:56,760
And then to developers, to have them have a good experience with the platform.

277
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,441
And then to myself, really, in my own career,

278
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,622
and what I sort of wanted to make that into,

279
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:03,963
or how this all affected me.

280
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:05,444
And then, really, to my platform.

281
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:08,407
Like, I didn't fundamentally care about Sony's bottom line.

282
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:09,487
Why would I?

283
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:12,550
I still, I'm a huge, you know, I grew up with PlayStation.

284
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,570
I'm a huge fan of the platform,

285
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,232
and I want to make their storefront an awesome place,

286
00:13:15,432 --> 00:13:17,633
but, you know, these were sort of roughly my priorities.

287
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:21,036
I really, you know, I genuinely was more interested

288
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:22,937
in a good experience for players and developers

289
00:13:22,977 --> 00:13:24,739
than maybe myself, with the platforms being less.

290
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:25,980
And this is true everywhere I've gone.

291
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,462
And honestly, I think this is what made me good at my job when I was at these places because I cared more about my work than the job itself.

292
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:39,484
And I think my point here is that your priorities probably align a lot more with biz dev people than you think they might,

293
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:43,865
because they really do genuinely care about your games and success, often over their own platform.

294
00:13:47,991 --> 00:13:51,092
And also I should say you don't really have to be a partner title to benefit from this.

295
00:13:51,272 --> 00:13:53,233
You don't have to have a formalized agreement with the platform.

296
00:13:53,773 --> 00:13:58,735
You know, even if you come out first on PlayStation and later on Xbox or first on mobile and later on PC,

297
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,296
you know, a champion can still help you with those things.

298
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:06,097
And typically, you know, there's less reason to promote a later release on a platform.

299
00:14:06,617 --> 00:14:11,539
And therefore this can be just as important, if not more so, you know, if not more important on an eventual platform

300
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,760
that might end up making you more money.

301
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:17,459
And I'll say too, if a platform ever offers you money of any sort, even if it's a small amount,

302
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,600
you should probably take it, because the extra support there is gonna be, you know, that'll be the real win,

303
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,541
because that leads to so many more promotions and opportunities.

304
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:29,303
You know, these platforms tend to have sort of buckets, where any game that they're partnering with

305
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:33,584
or funding even a small amount is that sort of the first priority, and then everything else.

306
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:36,645
So even taking a small amount of money can make you a much higher priority,

307
00:14:36,665 --> 00:14:41,186
and the, you know, the long-term dividends of that can be much more important than the money that you took.

308
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,507
I didn't know quite how to do this,

309
00:14:45,547 --> 00:14:46,568
and this was a late slide,

310
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:48,609
so I apologize for the awkwardness.

311
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:50,471
But a lot of people have asked me how to navigate

312
00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:52,672
sort of exclusivity and multi-platform launches.

313
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,613
And this is probably a good rough guide

314
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:56,915
of the sort of support that you'll get,

315
00:14:56,955 --> 00:14:58,596
and it's basically the same for each platform.

316
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:00,578
But essentially, if you self-publish

317
00:15:00,618 --> 00:15:02,079
with some exclusivity on a platform,

318
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:04,080
you're likely going to get some degree of the support

319
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,282
from the platform, and that's your best chance of doing so

320
00:15:07,202 --> 00:15:08,403
if you put the game everywhere,

321
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:10,665
like you can see on the bottom.

322
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:14,647
Maybe not as much, or actually the fourth line, I guess.

323
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:19,929
And if you work with a publisher, then it really depends on that publisher's relationship with the platform.

324
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:25,011
But coming out second on a platform, again, doesn't mean that they're not going to give you any support.

325
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:26,612
It just means you need to find your champion there.

326
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:33,654
I've said in the past, you only get one launch, so you should nail it.

327
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:39,056
But also, that's not true when you get lots of launches across every platform over multiple

328
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:39,436
years.

329
00:15:40,497 --> 00:15:43,438
And if you do do that, then you're going to need the best champion you can find for all

330
00:15:43,478 --> 00:15:43,719
of them.

331
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,121
You can have multiple champions, and you should have multiple champions.

332
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,332
Platforms largely understand that you need to make

333
00:15:51,352 --> 00:15:53,053
the most sustainable decisions for your business

334
00:15:53,193 --> 00:15:55,034
and that you should take the best deals offered.

335
00:15:55,114 --> 00:15:55,975
And there were lots of occasions

336
00:15:55,995 --> 00:15:56,896
where I would tell a developer

337
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,617
to go take a deal from someone else.

338
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:01,119
And if someone was bitter about that,

339
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:03,181
I think you probably shouldn't be working with them anyways.

340
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:07,784
So weird that they gave us milk to drink for this.

341
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:12,428
All right, oh yeah, that was my drinking milk break.

342
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,231
So let's go through the steps of this,

343
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:18,112
of how to find and maximize your champion.

344
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:22,408
What does this mean, making the right game?

345
00:16:22,688 --> 00:16:24,429
Step one, can you make the wrong game?

346
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:26,950
And I don't like that idea, I don't like how it sounds

347
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,871
because I believe that games are art first

348
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:30,993
and products second, and I really want you

349
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,413
to make the game that you wanna make.

350
00:16:32,814 --> 00:16:34,815
However, it's still good to understand what you're making

351
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:36,896
and its implications on your potential champion.

352
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,118
And this could be a whole separate talk,

353
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:42,539
but we're just gonna cover the basics of it.

354
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,760
So I think really the easiest types of games

355
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,802
to get excited about generally.

356
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:51,838
are games that are either doing something fundamentally new.

357
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,540
So these, you know, these games are getting older at this point,

358
00:16:55,261 --> 00:17:00,084
but I'd say all of these that are you are doing something fundamentally new in games and not just in their genres.

359
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:03,247
Or you could do something that's sort of the best of a genre.

360
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:07,990
Here's some other examples of things that are maybe not radically new, but did what they did really well.

361
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:12,240
And if you're not doing one or the other of these things, you're going to have a much tougher time.

362
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:16,905
And it's less likely, probably, that you're going to make something that's the best of a genre,

363
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:20,289
just because that's a lot tougher, but you can definitely make something new, or you can try to make something new.

364
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:28,016
And I'd also say that the one thing to me that all these games have in common is either great art, or at least memorable art.

365
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:29,198
So visuals really do matter.

366
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:34,180
And this past Saturday I was hanging out with my friend Zach Gage, and he said something

367
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,222
else that I really liked about what sorts of games might have the best chances of success

368
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:38,602
right now.

369
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:42,764
And then last night I was up pretty late and I started Googling pictures of Zach to add

370
00:17:42,784 --> 00:17:46,726
to this talk, and he's just such an impossible dreamboat.

371
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:48,967
So let's just all enjoy all of these.

372
00:17:48,987 --> 00:17:50,408
I just want to hang out with all of these Zachs.

373
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:51,728
These Zachs Gage.

374
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:53,249
It's like Attorneys General.

375
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:59,358
So basically, let's just put this really bad chess logo, it's less distracting.

376
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:04,739
So Zach was talking about making a game that people want to play now, especially, to be

377
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,860
able to participate in the conversation around a game.

378
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,781
And if we go back and we look at those Something New games that I pulled out, I think there

379
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:15,902
is a certain zeitgeist around them that's really true to that idea, and they weren't

380
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:20,102
known quantities, and that's part of what made them really true discussion pieces, and

381
00:18:20,122 --> 00:18:21,703
that can be a huge factor in success.

382
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:27,403
And again, all ties back to giving your champion reasons

383
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:28,123
to want to fight for you.

384
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:32,267
I believe that a screenshot should sell your game.

385
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:34,189
This is Inside, of course, by Playdead.

386
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:35,991
It's beautiful, evocative.

387
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:37,012
It makes me want to play it.

388
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:39,214
But not everyone has six years to polish a game

389
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:40,595
and make incredible lighting.

390
00:18:42,157 --> 00:18:43,798
This is Plug and Play by Etter Studio.

391
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,280
And sometimes simpler things can be just as intriguing.

392
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:48,022
I don't know what it is, but I want to play it.

393
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:54,259
This is Prune by Polyculture. It's sort of a less-delayed example, but this is simple, beautiful color,

394
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,903
it's intriguing, makes me want to know more about it.

395
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,891
And if your game is hard for you to describe,

396
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,532
it's gonna be hard for your champion as well.

397
00:19:01,972 --> 00:19:03,993
And they probably won't be excited to be your champion,

398
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:05,374
not because they're not excited about the game,

399
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,634
but because it's gonna be too difficult

400
00:19:06,674 --> 00:19:09,035
and they're gonna run into too many roadblocks internally

401
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:10,336
when they're trying to talk about your game.

402
00:19:11,957 --> 00:19:12,717
Salt and Sanctuary.

403
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,998
So I don't think that the best game pitches are really

404
00:19:16,078 --> 00:19:17,479
it's this thing meets this other thing.

405
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,040
And I think that usually means your game

406
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,380
is not unique enough to stand out.

407
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:23,723
However, it's still better than being able to describe,

408
00:19:23,783 --> 00:19:26,265
you know, to not describe it or talk about why it's unique.

409
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:28,867
And Salt and Sanctuary really has an easy pitch.

410
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:30,769
Stark Souls in 2D.

411
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:32,991
And I don't think I actually overtly said that,

412
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,832
but that's what was clear from when I played it.

413
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:37,994
And it has a great demo and a team I wanted to work with.

414
00:19:38,214 --> 00:19:41,316
Really, it was a no-brainer for me to sign and work with.

415
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:46,959
And as a counter-example, there was a lot of discussion about why Tacoma didn't maybe sell as well as expectations at launch,

416
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,381
despite great reviews and being from the Gone Home team.

417
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:53,303
And for me, just in my opinion, a big reason of that might have been that you...

418
00:19:53,663 --> 00:19:56,945
To me, you could never really tell what the experience of the game was when you were watching a trailer.

419
00:19:57,766 --> 00:20:01,269
I didn't really know what sort of gameplay it was gonna be,

420
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:02,991
and I had to play it to appreciate the game,

421
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:05,193
and I love the game, but I had to play it to find that out.

422
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:07,134
And I'd actually also argued that

423
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:09,357
Where the Water Tastes Like Wine had the same issue.

424
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:11,799
It was hard to watch a trailer and really understand

425
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:13,420
what the gameplay experience was gonna be.

426
00:20:18,545 --> 00:20:20,127
So your champion really has to believe

427
00:20:20,187 --> 00:20:21,988
you're capable of making the games that you wanna make.

428
00:20:23,836 --> 00:20:29,060
I think if you say you're going to make the next Apex Legends, then it's not going to

429
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,281
go anywhere because you're probably not.

430
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:34,023
But if you say you're going to make the next Stardew Valley, with enough time maybe you

431
00:20:34,063 --> 00:20:37,246
can, who knows if it'll be successful, but you can probably accomplish something of that

432
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:37,566
scope.

433
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,469
And I think having examples is really important, even if you haven't made a successful game

434
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:42,669
yet.

435
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:46,192
Just showing that you're able of making anything is much better than nothing.

436
00:20:47,153 --> 00:20:52,576
And also I should note that your champion really only cares about the concepts of your game, not really how the game turns out.

437
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:55,118
I think that's usually true actually when people are funding things.

438
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:59,141
So I don't think you should feel pressure to deliver exactly the thing you're showing them up front.

439
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:03,249
And knowing when to show your game I think is important too,

440
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:04,249
especially when you're pitching.

441
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,710
This is something actually that Tyler Sigmund

442
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,491
of Red Hook Studios, who did Darkest Dungeon, reminded me.

443
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:13,092
You know, basically if you're making the next No Man's Sky,

444
00:21:13,612 --> 00:21:16,413
then you're fine to show your game at an early concept stage.

445
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:18,334
But if it needs to be something

446
00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:19,614
that needs to be proven out further,

447
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:20,874
you should wait until you have a demo

448
00:21:20,894 --> 00:21:22,075
to showcase the game well.

449
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:23,875
And this is sort of a paradox

450
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:26,036
because you might need publisher support earlier,

451
00:21:26,176 --> 00:21:27,856
but you might be more likely to get it later

452
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:29,257
if you can wait until when you show the game

453
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:30,157
at the right point in time.

454
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:36,426
Something else to consider, maybe don't post programmer or placeholder art online before

455
00:21:36,466 --> 00:21:38,187
release if it's going to change significantly.

456
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:39,468
It might come back to haunt you.

457
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:42,310
If you're going to use placeholders, make them obvious.

458
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:47,574
Chris Hecker told me that the art director on Spore would put big pink triangles in screenshots

459
00:21:47,594 --> 00:21:48,775
to be clear that they weren't final.

460
00:21:49,635 --> 00:21:53,537
And as much as people say they can look at something early and imagine it, they're really

461
00:21:53,597 --> 00:21:54,377
visual by nature.

462
00:21:54,437 --> 00:21:55,018
Everyone's visual.

463
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:59,199
And if this image had come out pre-release, then this game would have been a lot less

464
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:00,540
appealing when people were searching for it.

465
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,901
And of course that went on to be Braid and David's gorgeous art.

466
00:22:05,382 --> 00:22:08,983
So thankfully when you look up Braid online now, you don't see this, you see this.

467
00:22:11,293 --> 00:22:12,936
So that was the first step, making the right game.

468
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:16,062
And sometimes your champion will find you entirely by themselves,

469
00:22:16,122 --> 00:22:17,284
but you can never really count on that.

470
00:22:18,065 --> 00:22:19,688
So we should talk about making yourself findable.

471
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:25,634
First thing, go to events. This is the great first step.

472
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:29,339
Submit a talk to events if it will help get you there.

473
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,283
These are just a few of the ones that came to my mind first that I've gone to,

474
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:34,986
but there's tons all over the world all the time.

475
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:38,229
Aaron from FlipFly, who made Race to the Sun,

476
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:40,993
he told me a story about when I stopped by their booth at PAX in 2013.

477
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:44,665
He said, we felt that really made the trip worth it,

478
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:47,507
and those types of meetings make going to GDC worthwhile as well.

479
00:22:48,047 --> 00:22:51,329
We know that dev relations people typically manage a lot of accounts,

480
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:53,090
and so we put a lot of value in face time.

481
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,011
And we've always sort of assumed that by showing up at events like this

482
00:22:56,051 --> 00:22:57,192
and making time for meetings,

483
00:22:57,532 --> 00:22:59,553
we're communicating commitment to the platform as well,

484
00:22:59,653 --> 00:23:03,235
which I feel is totally the case.

485
00:23:03,695 --> 00:23:05,856
So just relax, talk to everyone at these events.

486
00:23:06,097 --> 00:23:09,759
They're not just an opportunity to meet fans and potential fans of your game,

487
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:11,740
but really with potential business partners too.

488
00:23:12,331 --> 00:23:15,673
You can sell a few copies by staffing a booth

489
00:23:15,713 --> 00:23:16,514
and hanging out with your game.

490
00:23:16,634 --> 00:23:17,814
Meeting the right business person

491
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:19,436
and having the right meeting can unlock

492
00:23:19,476 --> 00:23:20,837
selling tens of thousands of copies.

493
00:23:21,657 --> 00:23:23,539
And I think it's important to talk to everyone

494
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:26,521
at a platform or not, specifically,

495
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:27,962
don't talk to people who aren't business people

496
00:23:28,722 --> 00:23:29,923
and not just the business people

497
00:23:30,263 --> 00:23:32,245
because even event staff, PR,

498
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,226
other people can become your champion as well.

499
00:23:34,286 --> 00:23:37,589
And if someone from Nintendo PR loves your game,

500
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:38,849
then your other Nintendo champion

501
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:40,110
will have a lot less work to do

502
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,311
when it gets to the PR stage.

503
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,655
I would always take it pretty seriously when someone from another department at PlayStation

504
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:47,176
would say, hey, have you checked out this game?

505
00:23:47,196 --> 00:23:51,119
Especially if I didn't know about it already, because we can't possibly see everything.

506
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,600
So I would always put stock in that.

507
00:23:54,762 --> 00:23:56,503
And other developers can be your champions too.

508
00:23:56,523 --> 00:24:00,346
This is like not great pictures of the indie megabooth online somehow, but...

509
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,907
You know, the community, your community is very,

510
00:24:04,128 --> 00:24:05,990
my community, our community, is very supportive

511
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,812
and good things can come just from

512
00:24:07,832 --> 00:24:09,073
having casual conversations.

513
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:11,736
Developers might share press lists with each other,

514
00:24:11,836 --> 00:24:13,418
contacts, other helpful connections,

515
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:15,120
and maybe you can even find someone else

516
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,482
to collaborate with or connections

517
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:17,583
with artists and musicians.

518
00:24:18,764 --> 00:24:23,325
And also if a highly respected developer recommends another developer to a platform that can go a long way.

519
00:24:24,026 --> 00:24:26,547
Dan Edelman, who used to do biz dev at Nintendo,

520
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:31,929
he told me that this whole chain of people, Kyle Gabler from World of Goo, introduced Edmund McMillan,

521
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:35,510
made Super Meat Boy to Dan, and then Edmund introduced Derek Yu, who made Spelunky.

522
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,692
So it's this whole chain where, you know, if you have a good relationship with a platform,

523
00:24:40,152 --> 00:24:43,653
they'll take your advice seriously. So this networking can have these great knock-on effects.

524
00:24:45,595 --> 00:24:48,777
This is the JW Marriott hotel lobby during E3,

525
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:49,677
also not great pictures,

526
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:51,958
but this is where a lot of the business gets done at E3.

527
00:24:52,878 --> 00:24:55,279
And you've, I'm sure, experienced some of this around GDC.

528
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,879
Hotel lobbies, bars, coffee shops

529
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:58,060
are all great places to meet people

530
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,700
and have sort of more personal conversations.

531
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:02,341
And even if you can't afford a pass to a show,

532
00:25:02,361 --> 00:25:04,142
a lot of them are still worth going to

533
00:25:04,282 --> 00:25:06,243
just for the networking, like GDC, obviously.

534
00:25:07,962 --> 00:25:11,024
This is my old laptop from, this is like a sheet of stickers

535
00:25:11,044 --> 00:25:13,486
that I peeled off from when I worked at PlayStation.

536
00:25:14,007 --> 00:25:15,688
Because I actually do believe in like, you know,

537
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:16,989
if you meet a platform representative,

538
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:17,970
give them something small.

539
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,391
If you have it, give them a cool sticker,

540
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:21,833
a business card that has a code to download

541
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:23,314
your game or your demo.

542
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,796
Nothing big, but I still have this

543
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:28,538
and I'm a nostalgic person, but it's a cool thing

544
00:25:28,578 --> 00:25:30,160
and I don't know, I'm weird.

545
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,861
Remember people's names.

546
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:36,082
It sounds obvious, but you won't find a champion

547
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,323
by seeming like you don't care.

548
00:25:37,343 --> 00:25:39,925
Always reintroduce yourself with your game,

549
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,386
with the name of your game, I should say.

550
00:25:42,987 --> 00:25:44,888
It really helps your champion to associate the two

551
00:25:44,908 --> 00:25:46,549
because they're meeting a ton of people all the time.

552
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:49,011
Don't be offended if they forget your name

553
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:50,292
because, again, they're meeting a lot of people.

554
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,524
And even better than an event is going and visiting an office of a platform.

555
00:25:56,844 --> 00:25:59,366
If you have a contact already, I'd say offer to go visit them.

556
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:01,247
I think it's always worth it.

557
00:26:01,608 --> 00:26:04,010
Tell them you're coming to town, you'd like to come by and present your game.

558
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,691
I think they're often likely to accept.

559
00:26:05,771 --> 00:26:08,854
It's nice to just say, oh, sorry, I can't do my regular work.

560
00:26:08,874 --> 00:26:11,076
I'm going to go have lunch with the developer this afternoon.

561
00:26:12,657 --> 00:26:14,298
And it's a much better context to see a game in.

562
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:15,900
It'll be a lot more memorable for them as well.

563
00:26:17,496 --> 00:26:18,637
Hopefully you know about Presskit,

564
00:26:19,497 --> 00:26:20,278
something else that really helps

565
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:21,359
with making your game findable.

566
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,302
Presskit's by Rami Ismail of Flumbeer

567
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:26,563
and some other good folks.

568
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:27,644
You should really be using it.

569
00:26:28,805 --> 00:26:30,806
This is gonna help you get some basic facts up

570
00:26:30,826 --> 00:26:32,788
about your company if you have one in your game.

571
00:26:33,228 --> 00:26:35,230
Make sure you have your contact info listed online,

572
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,992
which sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised.

573
00:26:38,953 --> 00:26:41,335
And a personal contact is better than a generic one.

574
00:26:41,415 --> 00:26:43,336
So I think nick at company.com

575
00:26:43,376 --> 00:26:45,138
is better than info at company.com.

576
00:26:45,678 --> 00:26:50,003
It might feel more professional that way, but it feels like screaming into a void otherwise.

577
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:51,625
And it really does drive me crazy.

578
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,889
It drives me crazy how many games don't have websites or a trailer online.

579
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,534
Don't make your game hard to find. Make sure the name of your game is Googlable.

580
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:01,556
And if you're lucky, someone might be looking for you.

581
00:27:03,736 --> 00:27:05,878
I think being persistent is good in this case.

582
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,624
And as far as reaching out to your platform and trying to stay on their radar,

583
00:27:12,124 --> 00:27:14,707
DevRelations folks get hundreds of emails every day,

584
00:27:15,207 --> 00:27:16,548
and so checking in often helps.

585
00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:18,831
It keeps you near the top of their mind.

586
00:27:19,311 --> 00:27:22,034
Personalize your emails. Don't just put people on a generic mailing list.

587
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:23,915
And keep your emails concise.

588
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:27,198
Include a video or a GIF, something moving for them to see.

589
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:34,247
Don't send email blasts to everybody that you know at a company.

590
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:38,950
This is a way you can maybe get an important problem solved quickly, which is important

591
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,911
sometimes but it's not going to help you find your champion.

592
00:27:42,773 --> 00:27:45,735
If you can't go to events or don't have a contact somewhere, you can check on Twitter.

593
00:27:46,135 --> 00:27:48,857
Again everyone is just people, they're probably going to respond to you and if they can't

594
00:27:48,897 --> 00:27:52,059
help directly, they're probably going to send you to whoever can or whomever can.

595
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:58,753
So we talked about making the right game, making yourself findable, and then you need

596
00:27:58,773 --> 00:28:01,557
to give your champion the best tools to help you to find your game.

597
00:28:06,992 --> 00:28:08,333
So we're gonna talk about arming your champion.

598
00:28:09,713 --> 00:28:12,215
So a big part of this is sending thoughtful demos

599
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:13,256
when you send a game somewhere.

600
00:28:14,857 --> 00:28:16,478
I'd say that Steam keys are ideal,

601
00:28:16,578 --> 00:28:19,000
better than a standalone build probably, but not essential.

602
00:28:20,561 --> 00:28:21,722
If you have a dev kit already,

603
00:28:21,782 --> 00:28:23,023
sending a build on their hardware

604
00:28:23,043 --> 00:28:24,884
shows that you're sort of serious about the platform

605
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:25,764
and that helps a lot.

606
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,526
If a game is planned to have controller support,

607
00:28:29,546 --> 00:28:31,067
you should have controller support in your demo.

608
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:33,667
The only game that I managed to not get funded at Sony

609
00:28:33,687 --> 00:28:35,128
that I really wanted to and fought for

610
00:28:35,168 --> 00:28:37,028
was because they didn't have controller support yet

611
00:28:37,108 --> 00:28:38,269
in their demo, and so it was hard

612
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:39,969
to extrapolate the experience.

613
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,050
And don't make people have to read separate documents.

614
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,991
It's better to mock up a simple control instruction screen

615
00:28:46,031 --> 00:28:47,251
and put it at the front of your demo.

616
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:50,572
I'd also say a YouTube link is always better

617
00:28:50,592 --> 00:28:51,673
than an attached video.

618
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,713
It makes it easier for people to share around internally.

619
00:28:54,856 --> 00:28:57,041
And if you provide a private YouTube link, you can track the views.

620
00:28:57,061 --> 00:28:57,983
You can see if they shared it.

621
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,607
Maybe you can, like, guilt them into watching it.

622
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,777
And I would say beware if you're making, like, a multiplayer game.

623
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:06,863
Developers making a multiplayer game

624
00:29:06,883 --> 00:29:09,644
would sometimes try to schedule me times

625
00:29:09,684 --> 00:29:11,025
to play their game online with them,

626
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:12,545
and it never really went quite well,

627
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,206
especially when you're trying to fill a room of people.

628
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:16,747
And it also means your champion might not

629
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,047
be able to show it at events, since it's

630
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:19,488
going to require multiple stations.

631
00:29:19,568 --> 00:29:21,529
So again, make multiplayer games,

632
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:22,649
but just be aware of those challenges

633
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:24,670
when you're trying to find people to champion them.

634
00:29:27,231 --> 00:29:28,371
Yeah, make it self-contained.

635
00:29:29,412 --> 00:29:30,192
And some things I can share.

636
00:29:30,212 --> 00:29:30,972
I talked about those already.

637
00:29:31,032 --> 00:29:33,493
So research their platforms as well.

638
00:29:35,247 --> 00:29:37,928
Be aware of any similarities to other first party games

639
00:29:37,948 --> 00:29:39,809
that are coming, that they're developing themselves.

640
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,670
Be familiar with their storefront,

641
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,831
just passingly familiar even.

642
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:45,792
You'd be surprised how many people I'd be in meetings with

643
00:29:45,832 --> 00:29:48,673
and would not really know how the PlayStation store worked

644
00:29:48,993 --> 00:29:50,174
because they just hadn't used it.

645
00:29:52,115 --> 00:29:54,116
And think about their priorities as well.

646
00:29:54,156 --> 00:29:55,917
Does the company have a new peripheral coming out?

647
00:29:55,937 --> 00:29:57,317
Can you support it in a cool way?

648
00:29:57,537 --> 00:29:59,518
That's sort of the ultimate ammunition for your champion

649
00:29:59,538 --> 00:30:00,839
if that's something you can do, of course,

650
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:02,200
without shoehorning it into your...

651
00:30:04,321 --> 00:30:06,902
And this is true of publishers as well.

652
00:30:06,922 --> 00:30:09,603
You should know their lineup, you should know their taste, so you're not pitching them something

653
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:11,664
that is just not a good fit from the start.

654
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:18,267
Your personal story can be just as important as your game.

655
00:30:18,848 --> 00:30:21,609
Knowing about your situation, your team, this will help people remember you.

656
00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:24,690
Do you have a unique development story, a unique background?

657
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,792
Your champions are going to tell your story for you when they talk about the game.

658
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:32,525
The story of Axiom Verge was a big part of why I was able to sign it.

659
00:30:33,045 --> 00:30:36,827
The developer, Tom Happ, had a day job at a bigger studio and worked on his passion

660
00:30:36,847 --> 00:30:38,868
project at night, one that he'd had in mind for years.

661
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:42,471
And we could help him have a bit more freedom to focus on the game.

662
00:30:42,511 --> 00:30:44,032
We knew that the game was going to turn out great.

663
00:30:44,772 --> 00:30:49,455
And I'd also say the story of your game, don't confuse this point with the actual literal

664
00:30:49,535 --> 00:30:50,515
narrative story of the game.

665
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:52,677
The setting of your game is plenty.

666
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:55,478
People really won't care about the larger story of your game.

667
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:56,659
When you're pitching it.

668
00:30:56,699 --> 00:30:59,402
And I'm sad to say that as a writer, but it's true.

669
00:31:01,884 --> 00:31:04,407
And think about really talking about why you're making this game.

670
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:08,911
Companies can only fund so many games and you can only make so many games in your life.

671
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:10,813
Why did you choose this game?

672
00:31:10,853 --> 00:31:12,014
Why are you the one to make it?

673
00:31:12,114 --> 00:31:14,917
Not your relevant experience, but your personal motivation.

674
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:18,561
I think that's part of your story and what people will respond to and pay attention to

675
00:31:18,601 --> 00:31:19,301
when you talk about it.

676
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:23,538
A lot of developers have asked me this, they say,

677
00:31:23,578 --> 00:31:24,418
what are you looking for?

678
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:26,919
And I think, again, that's the wrong question.

679
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:29,540
If you think about everything we've discussed,

680
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,521
people are just looking for projects that get them excited.

681
00:31:31,581 --> 00:31:32,561
It's just a personal thing.

682
00:31:33,201 --> 00:31:34,502
If anything, what aren't you looking for

683
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:35,902
is an easier question to answer.

684
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,063
Maybe they have a lot of one genre already

685
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,864
or know that they have trouble getting

686
00:31:39,904 --> 00:31:41,124
certain types of games supported.

687
00:31:42,741 --> 00:31:47,486
I think being specific is actually better than being flexible when you're pitching.

688
00:31:48,027 --> 00:31:51,630
I think you want to provide very specific budget and timeline breakdowns.

689
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,953
You don't want to give people a menu of options of different sort of compromised versions

690
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:58,157
of the game you could make for this amount of money, but I'd rather make this version

691
00:31:58,177 --> 00:31:59,178
of the game for this amount of money.

692
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:02,901
It might feel counterintuitive, but really I'd say you should pitch the version of the

693
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,882
game that you want to make.

694
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:06,184
I think that's the version that's most likely to get signed.

695
00:32:07,586 --> 00:32:14,353
I was actually just right before this talk, I was meeting up with Matt Dixon, who's a director of business development at EA,

696
00:32:14,914 --> 00:32:20,599
and he said this verbatim without me prompting him. He basically said, yeah, you should pitch the game you want to make,

697
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:24,143
because that's what's going to get funded. And I was like, oh, that's in my talk. I'm going to say your name.

698
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:27,054
Think about shared goals.

699
00:32:27,214 --> 00:32:28,554
Every platform has their own goals.

700
00:32:28,974 --> 00:32:30,455
For instance, with mobile,

701
00:32:30,635 --> 00:32:32,755
how nice might your game make their hardware look?

702
00:32:33,096 --> 00:32:34,996
Nintendo has a strong heritage of platformers,

703
00:32:35,076 --> 00:32:36,977
Microsoft of shooting games and racing games,

704
00:32:37,037 --> 00:32:38,217
and Sony with art games.

705
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:40,778
Maybe there's an annual seasonal promotion

706
00:32:40,818 --> 00:32:41,518
you can align with.

707
00:32:41,598 --> 00:32:43,639
Maybe they need to launch a new feature you can support.

708
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,919
I think framing the conversation that way is good.

709
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:49,540
How can my game release best support PlayStation?

710
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:52,681
And for subsequent launches,

711
00:32:52,741 --> 00:32:55,082
second, third, distant launches.

712
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,992
You know, adding new game content is helpful.

713
00:32:59,032 --> 00:33:00,673
Maybe there's a new game mode you can add.

714
00:33:01,294 --> 00:33:02,655
Maybe it's just some new costumes.

715
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:05,057
Maybe all the DLC is now included in the main game.

716
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,159
You know, give people a hook.

717
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,240
Make them a new trailer for the new platform.

718
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,022
Cut a new trailer and make new assets for them

719
00:33:11,062 --> 00:33:13,004
so it can feel special and unique for their platform.

720
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:16,748
Consider platform-specific features, like we talked about,

721
00:33:16,768 --> 00:33:19,330
if there's a way you can support that without too much work.

722
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,151
And treat them like your first launch.

723
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:23,473
You don't want to feel like a second-class citizen on a platform,

724
00:33:23,493 --> 00:33:25,094
and you shouldn't make them feel that way either.

725
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,475
And the more serious you take subsequent launches,

726
00:33:27,515 --> 00:33:29,437
the more seriously those platforms are going to take you,

727
00:33:29,477 --> 00:33:32,178
and then that release gap of time will start to matter less.

728
00:33:33,963 --> 00:33:35,224
So we talked about making the right game,

729
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:37,627
making yourself findable, arming your champion,

730
00:33:38,548 --> 00:33:40,229
and really you wanna keep your champion around

731
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:43,713
for a long time, from when you put it on the radar

732
00:33:43,733 --> 00:33:45,374
to when it comes out and well beyond that,

733
00:33:46,075 --> 00:33:47,156
and then on to your next game.

734
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:52,788
Your champion should always have access to the latest major build of your game,

735
00:33:53,728 --> 00:33:56,349
that has new features and polish, it doesn't need to be small iterative builds.

736
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,272
And if it wasn't a Steam build that you can push updates to,

737
00:34:01,512 --> 00:34:03,813
just give them a link to a folder where you can keep the latest build,

738
00:34:05,053 --> 00:34:09,995
the latest assets, trailers, screenshots, and all of your contact info, your phone number.

739
00:34:10,336 --> 00:34:12,317
You never know when someone wants to call you up with an opportunity.

740
00:34:14,064 --> 00:34:16,346
I'd say trust your champion in my experience.

741
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:21,248
If they don't need to ask you permissions for small things, more opportunities will open up.

742
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:25,631
Flexible and willing and trusted developers really get the most ubiquitous support.

743
00:34:26,051 --> 00:34:30,173
And if you're sort of difficult to work with or precious about your games and these opportunities,

744
00:34:30,593 --> 00:34:33,695
people just skip you over to save time, even if it's a great game.

745
00:34:33,715 --> 00:34:35,716
They're just going to want to work with the games that are easiest.

746
00:34:37,066 --> 00:34:41,130
You know, your champion might need to go argue with their legal team on a contract,

747
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:44,353
and I think that's okay because really, again, I think they're on your side most of the time.

748
00:34:45,814 --> 00:34:48,557
And similarly, don't, you know, you need to choose your battles.

749
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:51,119
So don't push back on things that your champion said won't happen,

750
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,681
just accept it and move on to the next thing,

751
00:34:52,741 --> 00:34:55,283
and think that they might genuinely have your best interests in mind.

752
00:34:57,158 --> 00:34:59,339
Learn organizations and their tool sets.

753
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:01,280
Don't just email your champion about everything.

754
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,461
If they've introduced you to another department to work with,

755
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:05,822
then email that person and CC your champion.

756
00:35:06,362 --> 00:35:08,563
For example, well, I've been gone long enough,

757
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:09,364
I don't know if it's true now,

758
00:35:09,404 --> 00:35:12,725
but DevNet used to be sort of the backend

759
00:35:13,005 --> 00:35:14,966
tech support message board stuff at Sony.

760
00:35:14,986 --> 00:35:16,267
There's a learning curve up front,

761
00:35:16,287 --> 00:35:19,248
but that's the place to get your questions answered quickly

762
00:35:19,268 --> 00:35:20,429
and then just asking your champion

763
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:22,210
is gonna end up sending you back there.

764
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,790
Don't announce anything without checking with your champion first.

765
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,512
You might be excited to share things publicly throughout development,

766
00:35:28,532 --> 00:35:29,913
but always check in with your champion.

767
00:35:30,354 --> 00:35:32,375
They might have an opportunity you don't know about.

768
00:35:32,776 --> 00:35:36,339
Always give them the opportunity to debut the news or boost your signal

769
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:38,841
because a lot of times they won't do it if you already have.

770
00:35:38,861 --> 00:35:41,022
It's sort of less exciting on their channel as if it's old news.

771
00:35:41,703 --> 00:35:44,605
And maybe even try talking to platforms before you announce a game.

772
00:35:45,266 --> 00:35:47,007
It's sort of more fun for them to be able to announce

773
00:35:47,107 --> 00:35:49,289
and that unlocks bigger opportunities a lot of the time.

774
00:35:50,554 --> 00:35:52,876
And that's a defer to your champion on your launch date.

775
00:35:52,896 --> 00:35:53,496
Think about that.

776
00:35:54,397 --> 00:35:56,038
Don't choose a release date and then ask them

777
00:35:56,078 --> 00:35:57,299
if they can support that date.

778
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,180
Defer to whatever date they say is best,

779
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,581
because this is gonna make you eligible

780
00:36:00,621 --> 00:36:02,002
for more promotions and support.

781
00:36:02,482 --> 00:36:04,344
And they can often warn you away from bad dates,

782
00:36:04,384 --> 00:36:05,424
even if they can't tell you why.

783
00:36:05,484 --> 00:36:07,866
Like, hey, there's a big game launching on that date.

784
00:36:07,886 --> 00:36:09,067
You should probably push back a few weeks.

785
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:17,693
So, this one's sort of about saying thank you.

786
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:22,517
So consider sending them something nice

787
00:36:22,698 --> 00:36:23,939
when they help with the milestones.

788
00:36:23,979 --> 00:36:26,061
I think it really is worth the cost, like tenfold.

789
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,783
So Axiom Verge, Tom Hap sent me a couple gift baskets

790
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:30,485
when we signed the game and at release.

791
00:36:30,965 --> 00:36:33,307
The Star Wars guys sent me a $100 Starbucks gift card.

792
00:36:33,327 --> 00:36:34,228
That was really nice of them,

793
00:36:34,248 --> 00:36:35,369
and I'll always remember those things,

794
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:36,290
and it meant a lot to me.

795
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,031
It doesn't need to be anything decadent,

796
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:39,713
and most companies have a gifting policies

797
00:36:39,753 --> 00:36:41,494
of what they can accept, but even a small thing

798
00:36:41,795 --> 00:36:43,336
to say thank you really goes a long way with them

799
00:36:43,376 --> 00:36:45,198
and helps maintaining that relationship long-term.

800
00:36:46,295 --> 00:36:52,916
A friend texted me this picture when he saw my name in the credits of Guacamelee 2.

801
00:36:54,116 --> 00:36:55,196
Give credit when it's appropriate.

802
00:36:55,216 --> 00:36:57,857
It means a lot to the people who help you and it will make people want to work with

803
00:36:57,877 --> 00:36:58,277
you again.

804
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:01,938
It's been really mutually beneficial for me and having these connections is helping me

805
00:37:01,978 --> 00:37:02,178
now.

806
00:37:02,978 --> 00:37:06,399
And the credits can also actually be a great place to find the names of platform or publisher

807
00:37:06,419 --> 00:37:10,019
people you want to work with and then hunt them down online if you don't have a contact

808
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:10,419
otherwise.

809
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,080
So let's go on a journey together.

810
00:37:16,863 --> 00:37:20,366
This is Jenny. Jenny has a game. Jenny goes to GDC.

811
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:24,809
Maybe she gets into GDC in some way that she can show her game.

812
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,531
So then a person from a platform comes by

813
00:37:28,551 --> 00:37:33,034
to check out that game. So then Jenny can email them afterwards. Or maybe not.

814
00:37:33,094 --> 00:37:36,737
Maybe she didn't show to GDC and maybe Jenny has to go on Twitter and hunt them down.

815
00:37:38,278 --> 00:37:39,919
You know, Jenny's going to send a build of the game.

816
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:44,742
Then maybe the platform person is going to be able to send them a dev kit back.

817
00:37:46,053 --> 00:37:47,914
And then Jenny's gonna keep them up to date

818
00:37:47,994 --> 00:37:49,535
with videos and screenshots

819
00:37:49,575 --> 00:37:51,176
and all the right ammunition we talked about.

820
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,957
And then the platform person is gonna help

821
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:54,378
release it into the world.

822
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:56,640
And this workflow is just how it works most of the time.

823
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,201
And I think it's important to recognize all these steps

824
00:37:59,241 --> 00:38:00,802
and have that dialogue.

825
00:38:03,284 --> 00:38:05,846
So, oh yeah, and then you should say thank you as well.

826
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,326
That's important.

827
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,328
We're gonna do a little case study with my friend,

828
00:38:10,048 --> 00:38:12,430
Mr. Phil Tobitoski right here from Young Horses.

829
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,150
So,

830
00:38:16,095 --> 00:38:16,635
Yes, that's Phil.

831
00:38:17,215 --> 00:38:20,137
And I love, by the way, how the red on your jacket

832
00:38:20,177 --> 00:38:21,137
lines up with the tie.

833
00:38:21,157 --> 00:38:22,118
That's perfect.

834
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,298
You have too many arms, though.

835
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:26,380
So thanks to him for helping me with this session.

836
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,881
I didn't know he was gonna come to this talk,

837
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:29,222
so I'm glad he gets to see this in person.

838
00:38:32,632 --> 00:38:36,296
So back at GDC 2011, which is a long time ago,

839
00:38:37,156 --> 00:38:39,859
the original Octodad was an IGF nominee

840
00:38:39,939 --> 00:38:40,980
in the student showcase.

841
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:44,563
Some assets that Phil Kamde sent me.

842
00:38:45,044 --> 00:38:46,005
And it didn't look quite as nice,

843
00:38:46,065 --> 00:38:47,486
but it was still goofy and fun.

844
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:49,348
And I saw that the team was from DePaul University

845
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,689
in Chicago, which is where I grew up.

846
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,131
And I approached the team about it there,

847
00:38:53,191 --> 00:38:54,252
but it was sort of too early for them

848
00:38:54,272 --> 00:38:55,814
to consider doing something commercial with it,

849
00:38:55,874 --> 00:38:57,215
so we decided we'd just keep in touch.

850
00:38:58,427 --> 00:39:00,168
And then they showed the game later, a couple years later,

851
00:39:00,228 --> 00:39:01,869
at PAX East in the Indie Mega Booth.

852
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:05,130
And everything looked a whole lot better as well,

853
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,031
and they started pursuing it as a commercial product

854
00:39:07,552 --> 00:39:08,933
and as Young Horses as a new team.

855
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:11,054
And the timing then meant that we could have

856
00:39:11,114 --> 00:39:12,935
early conversations with them about PlayStation 4.

857
00:39:14,296 --> 00:39:16,657
This is a nice quote that I can't see

858
00:39:16,757 --> 00:39:18,618
on either of these screens to read myself

859
00:39:18,678 --> 00:39:20,259
that was from a Polygon article

860
00:39:20,299 --> 00:39:21,420
where Phil said some kind things

861
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,000
about just having this relationship

862
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,361
where we could talk and I could help push

863
00:39:24,381 --> 00:39:25,222
for the game internally.

864
00:39:25,942 --> 00:39:26,803
But you can probably read that.

865
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,581
So we sent them a PS4 development kit,

866
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:32,482
which no one was supposed to post pictures of online,

867
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:33,382
but somebody did.

868
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:37,524
And they got the build running great in four weeks,

869
00:39:38,044 --> 00:39:39,784
which meant that we were able to showcase the game

870
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:42,465
at, you know, in our E3 booth, which was huge.

871
00:39:43,146 --> 00:39:46,347
And it was even on stage as part of this Indie 8 event

872
00:39:46,387 --> 00:39:49,048
that we announced, which was a huge moment for PlayStation

873
00:39:49,128 --> 00:39:49,828
and for the team.

874
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,869
And I think none of the big platforms

875
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,089
had really done anything like this before,

876
00:39:53,169 --> 00:39:55,470
and there's actually not great screenshots of that

877
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,330
somehow online either.

878
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,089
And yeah, that's about it right there.

879
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:06,451
So, you know, we ended up bringing them to over 26 different events.

880
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:09,913
There's me and Phil and Adam Boyes, the old VP from PlayStation,

881
00:40:10,093 --> 00:40:12,094
and this costume that PlayStation made for them,

882
00:40:12,134 --> 00:40:15,295
which ended up being sort of one of the earlier, like, PS4 mascots almost.

883
00:40:16,476 --> 00:40:19,557
We had a private room for Octodad at the PlayStation 4 launch event,

884
00:40:19,598 --> 00:40:22,639
where press got to play the final PlayStation 4 hardware for the first time.

885
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:25,600
And Sony Japan, you know, they were champions as well.

886
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,462
They even helped localize the game and made a special logo for it.

887
00:40:29,843 --> 00:40:34,612
And so these guys have sold, I mean this is even out of date now, but after five years sold over two million units.

888
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:36,876
Amazing. Let's give Phil a round of applause for that.

889
00:40:39,778 --> 00:40:44,599
And you'll notice too, only 17% of those sales are on PlayStation and 28% of the revenue.

890
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:48,000
But I think that together we helped boost the profile of the game massively,

891
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,980
which helped it go on and have this great tale across multiple platforms.

892
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,181
So a lot of that was really important.

893
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:56,182
And I'll say, sorry Phil, I don't know if Octodad is a great game.

894
00:40:56,242 --> 00:40:57,222
Maybe you don't know either.

895
00:40:57,362 --> 00:41:00,923
And the team has had some fun with that themselves, despite the great sales.

896
00:41:01,523 --> 00:41:02,624
But I thought it was a great game.

897
00:41:03,284 --> 00:41:04,945
And it felt new to me and it had a lot of charm.

898
00:41:05,305 --> 00:41:06,346
And it made me want to fight for it.

899
00:41:06,366 --> 00:41:07,967
And I think that had a big impact on the game.

900
00:41:08,888 --> 00:41:10,449
And the team was always really easy to work with.

901
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:11,970
They were a really responsive partner.

902
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,230
And that made me want to work with them.

903
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,912
And the timing worked out in their favor.

904
00:41:16,132 --> 00:41:18,754
And they didn't know that it would when they started talking to us.

905
00:41:18,794 --> 00:41:19,694
But we just kept in touch.

906
00:41:19,734 --> 00:41:21,435
And then an opportunity like this presented itself.

907
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,117
Okay. More milk.

908
00:41:28,465 --> 00:41:32,227
So, a quick note on publishers, and we'll have some time for Q&A as well.

909
00:41:33,387 --> 00:41:36,169
So there's a lot of different indie publishers. This is an incomplete list.

910
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:40,370
All of them have different priorities, different deal terms, different expertises.

911
00:41:40,951 --> 00:41:43,351
They also have different relationships with each of the big platforms.

912
00:41:43,972 --> 00:41:45,472
So I'd say make that part of your research.

913
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:49,454
Is the publisher you want to work with released multiple games on a platform you want to be on?

914
00:41:50,332 --> 00:41:58,323
And they all have something in common, again, they're comprised of a bunch of different people with different tastes and you should think about them the same way you do your platform champion because they're going to have to fight for you as well.

915
00:41:59,044 --> 00:42:04,931
And almost no one you talk to initially is going to be the final decision maker. So there's always going to be this step of them fighting for your game internally.

916
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,081
So I'd say also identify your needs from them.

917
00:42:09,181 --> 00:42:10,141
Is it localization?

918
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,241
Is it QA?

919
00:42:11,341 --> 00:42:13,162
Is it help getting hardware?

920
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:17,123
Is it just submitting the game and pressing the big red button?

921
00:42:18,104 --> 00:42:19,264
Is it marketing and PR?

922
00:42:19,444 --> 00:42:20,744
Or is it just money that you need?

923
00:42:20,764 --> 00:42:21,345
Is it just funding?

924
00:42:22,432 --> 00:42:25,454
Publishers tend to be very different from each other, more so than platforms.

925
00:42:26,354 --> 00:42:30,457
Helping to decide exactly what you want beforehand is really helpful.

926
00:42:31,057 --> 00:42:34,419
And with regards to funding, you know, is the money recoupable, is it not?

927
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:35,579
Do they recoup at different rates?

928
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,101
Some recoup the marketing and event spend that they put towards it,

929
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,923
or want the right of refusal, or to own an IP.

930
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:44,284
And these are all different negotiating knobs to turn.

931
00:42:44,304 --> 00:42:46,805
And usually when you have to turn one up, you'll have to turn another one down.

932
00:42:47,605 --> 00:42:49,186
And no one's going to give you exactly what you want.

933
00:42:50,247 --> 00:42:54,368
I'd say also in my experience you can usually tell from someone's response time how they're going to be to work with.

934
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:57,450
Just because they're slow doesn't mean it's bad, but it's a consideration of working with them.

935
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,832
And the same key elements are the same when you're talking to potential publishers.

936
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:07,814
So the things we talked about making the right game, making it findable, arming your champion, and keeping your champion.

937
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,942
I reached out to my friend Brandon Sinclair from Games Industry.

938
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:17,023
He's been a journalist for over 15 years.

939
00:43:17,904 --> 00:43:24,268
He reminded me that press like to lurk and that if you post things with the game dev

940
00:43:24,288 --> 00:43:26,970
hashtag and other developer communities, press are often watching.

941
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,352
And if a journalist has awareness of a game already,

942
00:43:29,372 --> 00:43:31,735
it's going to be a lot easier pitching them to cover it.

943
00:43:32,937 --> 00:43:34,539
And think about what's interesting about your game.

944
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:35,781
Is it in your pitch?

945
00:43:37,062 --> 00:43:37,843
Is it the game mechanics?

946
00:43:37,863 --> 00:43:39,085
Is it the topic or the theme?

947
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:40,266
Is it your personal story?

948
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,549
Is it the development method, something non-traditional?

949
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,152
And targeted outreach is important too.

950
00:43:45,192 --> 00:43:48,455
I think reaching out just totally broadly to press won't get you the best results.

951
00:43:49,035 --> 00:43:53,159
Consider the audience for your game in which press outlets, you know, target that audience.

952
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:58,544
You know, so Double Fine, I've talked to them about how they targeted influencers and streamers for Gang Beasts,

953
00:43:58,644 --> 00:44:03,588
but, you know, for everything, more of an arcade, they targeted Polygon and leaned hard into both of those things.

954
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:05,469
And you can think about targeting press

955
00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:06,610
who have covered similar games.

956
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:10,011
So if you're making a game for niche hobbyists,

957
00:44:10,152 --> 00:44:11,912
maybe you don't want to target games press.

958
00:44:11,952 --> 00:44:13,533
Maybe you should find where your audience is.

959
00:44:14,834 --> 00:44:16,935
Maybe your game about quilting would

960
00:44:16,955 --> 00:44:19,616
be better targeted at a quilting magazine than Game Informer.

961
00:44:20,777 --> 00:44:21,897
And do your research.

962
00:44:21,937 --> 00:44:24,158
Don't reach out to an outlet asking them to review your game

963
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:25,299
if they don't do reviews.

964
00:44:26,441 --> 00:44:27,441
Just make their job easy.

965
00:44:28,122 --> 00:44:29,102
I have no notes there.

966
00:44:29,802 --> 00:44:30,643
You know, don't just say,

967
00:44:30,703 --> 00:44:32,283
here's my game, want to interview me about it.

968
00:44:32,323 --> 00:44:33,103
Give them the news hooks.

969
00:44:33,464 --> 00:44:35,504
This is the first quilting game developed in Australia.

970
00:44:35,824 --> 00:44:38,565
And as a reminder,

971
00:44:38,985 --> 00:44:40,686
you should use press kit at the bare minimum.

972
00:44:40,706 --> 00:44:42,767
You can add a statement giving people permission

973
00:44:42,807 --> 00:44:44,347
to stream the game, help them to share it.

974
00:44:45,228 --> 00:44:47,168
And really, every time someone needs to email you

975
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:47,988
asking for something,

976
00:44:48,008 --> 00:44:50,549
there's a chance that press won't bother covering your game

977
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:51,410
because they're busy people.

978
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,350
So give them all the assets they need up front.

979
00:44:55,386 --> 00:44:58,107
So let's talk about the wrong way to do it a little bit with press.

980
00:44:58,948 --> 00:45:05,151
Sending out big mass mailings, you know, you should reach out to writers individually. They're much less likely to cover your game from a mass mailing.

981
00:45:06,812 --> 00:45:08,573
You know, not being transparent is not great.

982
00:45:08,593 --> 00:45:12,915
If you've pitched two writers from the same site on a story, let someone know if the other person picks it up.

983
00:45:14,475 --> 00:45:19,278
Being negative sucks. Don't pitch your game as a solution to a problem that other games have. Find a more positive angle.

984
00:45:20,525 --> 00:45:22,866
And don't be a jerk.

985
00:45:23,286 --> 00:45:26,447
Being willing to express a strong opinion on an industry issue can be refreshing,

986
00:45:27,367 --> 00:45:28,688
because AAA often can't do that.

987
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:31,869
But badmouthing other games is just not a good look.

988
00:45:32,149 --> 00:45:33,649
So I'm going to help you cheat a bit.

989
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,650
These are just a couple of good starting points for these things.

990
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:39,051
One of them is a list of a thousand press people

991
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:42,252
maintained by an EA employee from DICE.

992
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:45,774
And another one is a list of people and outlets and influencers

993
00:45:45,814 --> 00:45:47,094
who have covered indie games before.

994
00:45:47,114 --> 00:45:48,515
Let's leave that up for a second.

995
00:45:52,742 --> 00:45:55,284
I mean, you can always tweet at me later if you want this, too.

996
00:45:57,907 --> 00:46:02,051
So in closing, I'd say make the game that you want to make.

997
00:46:02,692 --> 00:46:04,414
Find someone to fight for it.

998
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:05,935
I'm Nick Sutner.

999
00:46:07,217 --> 00:46:08,898
I'll be here throughout the rest of GDC.

1000
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:12,062
So come talk to me, and thank you guys for your time.

1001
00:46:20,659 --> 00:46:23,500
And don't forget to fill out the evaluations later online, please.

1002
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,940
And if anyone wants to ask some questions, please come up to the mic or yell it out and

1003
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:26,700
then I'll repeat you.

1004
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,380
I have a quick question.

1005
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:27,560
Hello.

1006
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:27,921
Is the mic on?

1007
00:46:27,941 --> 00:46:28,021
Yeah.

1008
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:28,181
Oh, okay.

1009
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:29,561
I'm sorry.

1010
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:29,761
I'm sorry.

1011
00:46:29,781 --> 00:46:29,981
I'm sorry.

1012
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:30,181
I'm sorry.

1013
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:30,421
I'm sorry.

1014
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:30,781
I'm sorry.

1015
00:46:41,763 --> 00:46:41,963
I'm sorry.

1016
00:46:41,983 --> 00:46:42,203
I'm sorry.

1017
00:46:42,223 --> 00:46:42,564
I'm sorry.

1018
00:46:43,104 --> 00:46:43,304
I'm sorry.

1019
00:46:43,324 --> 00:46:43,504
I'm sorry.

1020
00:46:43,524 --> 00:46:43,704
I'm sorry.

1021
00:46:43,764 --> 00:46:44,764
I'm sorry.

1022
00:46:44,784 --> 00:46:45,204
I'm sorry.

1023
00:46:47,143 --> 00:46:52,166
How do you feel about, I guess, console or platform exclusives going forward?

1024
00:46:52,186 --> 00:46:56,189
Do you think the player community will be less annoyed?

1025
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,071
Sorry, I missed the second half.

1026
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:04,334
Will the player community be less annoyed about people going exclusive going forward?

1027
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:05,795
It seems to be happening more often.

1028
00:47:06,754 --> 00:47:08,214
Sorry, it's a little echoey. Will who be less annoyed?

1029
00:47:08,514 --> 00:47:10,775
Sorry, console and platform exclusives.

1030
00:47:10,835 --> 00:47:11,015
Yeah.

1031
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:15,196
Will the player community become less annoyed over time?

1032
00:47:15,556 --> 00:47:15,716
Right.

1033
00:47:15,736 --> 00:47:16,616
Is it happening more?

1034
00:47:16,816 --> 00:47:19,457
No, I mean, the players are always going to be annoyed,

1035
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:21,697
and this is just how the industry works.

1036
00:47:21,737 --> 00:47:24,618
People need to find sustainability for their studio

1037
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:26,658
and find funding, and exclusivity is a part of that.

1038
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:31,019
It's hard to say whether the sort of, like, you know,

1039
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:33,000
I don't know, entitled parts of game culture

1040
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:33,600
and people who...

1041
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,701
You know, are just the vocal minority fans

1042
00:47:36,741 --> 00:47:37,481
yelling about stuff?

1043
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:42,162
If that will change, I would guess not anytime soon.

1044
00:47:42,182 --> 00:47:43,783
So people are gonna be angry about those decisions.

1045
00:47:43,843 --> 00:47:46,844
But you know, I think there's some,

1046
00:47:46,984 --> 00:47:48,525
you should have some consideration about that.

1047
00:47:48,685 --> 00:47:52,086
But I think a lot of that, for better or worse,

1048
00:47:52,106 --> 00:47:53,987
tends to be directed more at the platform, I guess.

1049
00:47:54,427 --> 00:47:55,447
But I think you should do what's best

1050
00:47:55,507 --> 00:47:57,828
for making your studio sustainable, your game sustainable.

1051
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:00,649
That's a knock-on effect that hopefully

1052
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,570
will improve over time, but it's hard to say.

1053
00:48:05,879 --> 00:48:05,979
Yeah.

1054
00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:08,640
All right.

1055
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:14,862
I don't know if it was yesterday or earlier today, Outer Worlds was announced to be on

1056
00:48:14,962 --> 00:48:15,942
Epic instead of Steam.

1057
00:48:16,942 --> 00:48:23,624
And based on his question about people being upset about exclusives on certain platforms,

1058
00:48:24,864 --> 00:48:28,405
I was wondering if it's on us to champion our champion.

1059
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,843
Say, hey, Epic is helping us out a lot here.

1060
00:48:32,203 --> 00:48:34,865
We are working with them because they have helped us.

1061
00:48:35,985 --> 00:48:37,426
Obviously, I'm not part of that.

1062
00:48:37,507 --> 00:48:38,407
Sure, yeah.

1063
00:48:38,427 --> 00:48:41,830
I think that particular issue with Epic Store stuff right now

1064
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:42,810
is probably pretty touchy,

1065
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,232
so you have to be careful about getting yourself involved

1066
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:46,553
and embroiled in that.

1067
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:48,174
But definitely, generally, I mean, again,

1068
00:48:48,234 --> 00:48:50,896
Phil said some really nice stuff about working with PlayStation

1069
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:52,697
and me personally over the years,

1070
00:48:52,717 --> 00:48:54,178
and that made a difference to the platform.

1071
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:57,321
What are your thoughts on this?

1072
00:49:15,644 --> 00:49:19,007
So there's a lot of really good advice on how to find who you want your champion to

1073
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:22,771
be and what to do once you've recognized that they are now your champion.

1074
00:49:23,271 --> 00:49:25,793
But how do you know that they've become your champion?

1075
00:49:25,814 --> 00:49:27,315
That's a great question.

1076
00:49:27,755 --> 00:49:32,580
Where's that moment where you can start emailing them regularly and you know you're not bothering

1077
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,140
them at that point?

1078
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,341
Yeah, and you'd like the step five.

1079
00:49:37,109 --> 00:49:41,812
I think you can tell in talking to someone whether they are genuinely excited about your

1080
00:49:41,852 --> 00:49:42,132
game.

1081
00:49:43,132 --> 00:49:46,834
And I think if they're excited about your game and you start to feel that through the

1082
00:49:46,874 --> 00:49:51,717
process and things getting done and positive momentum towards release or promotions or

1083
00:49:51,757 --> 00:49:55,719
whatever, I think that's one of those things you'll feel when you see it.

1084
00:49:56,339 --> 00:49:59,020
I think there's not ever really going to be a moment when it's like, oh, you're my champion.

1085
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:03,562
In fact, a lot of the times I'd say a lot of devs successfully release games and working

1086
00:50:03,582 --> 00:50:06,623
with me a lot and never thought about this piece of the puzzle and never thought that

1087
00:50:06,683 --> 00:50:10,844
oh actually, again, some cases I spent like hundreds of hours just working on your game

1088
00:50:10,884 --> 00:50:14,426
but it's, you know, understandably from the outside it can be the black box of just things

1089
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:16,686
that happen for your game but it is always people fighting for it.

1090
00:50:18,264 --> 00:50:19,605
It's a good question, I'll think about it more.

1091
00:50:20,486 --> 00:50:22,148
But I think, yeah, they'll, you know,

1092
00:50:22,588 --> 00:50:24,770
if someone genuinely isn't excited about your game,

1093
00:50:26,072 --> 00:50:27,413
that's not your champion.

1094
00:50:27,593 --> 00:50:28,675
Like, you need to find that person.

1095
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,457
And if no one, if you can't find anyone who's excited,

1096
00:50:31,477 --> 00:50:33,580
that's maybe a self-reflective moment.

1097
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,503
If it's like, okay, maybe I'm not talking

1098
00:50:36,523 --> 00:50:37,404
about my game the right way.

1099
00:50:38,265 --> 00:50:40,447
So, yeah, I'll have to think about that.

1100
00:50:40,845 --> 00:50:44,289
And once you do find that person who's doing champion things for you, and you've got a

1101
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:49,974
hunch that they're it, would they like to hear, like, hey, you're my champion, thank

1102
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:52,797
you, or is it awkward to be given that label?

1103
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:54,319
Yeah, that's a good question.

1104
00:50:54,339 --> 00:50:57,942
Because I actually would think that might be kind of charming to be told that by someone

1105
00:50:58,102 --> 00:51:00,265
if I'm trying to help them, but also it might be a little bit awkward.

1106
00:51:00,685 --> 00:51:02,685
I mean, thank yous are always hugely appreciated.

1107
00:51:02,705 --> 00:51:07,687
I think, you know, if you can do it in a way without putting pressure, because you don't

1108
00:51:07,707 --> 00:51:09,948
want them to think like, oh, now you think that they're going to go and do everything

1109
00:51:10,028 --> 00:51:13,029
for you, where maybe it was a one-off thing or a smaller thing.

1110
00:51:15,318 --> 00:51:17,059
You know, I think just I appreciate you being,

1111
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,501
you know, you going to bat for us.

1112
00:51:18,561 --> 00:51:19,602
I appreciate this opportunity.

1113
00:51:19,622 --> 00:51:21,063
I appreciate the things you've been helping me with.

1114
00:51:21,143 --> 00:51:23,565
Like, I think you can sort of say it without saying it

1115
00:51:23,626 --> 00:51:24,747
and imply that, you know,

1116
00:51:24,787 --> 00:51:26,708
you know that they're going to bat for you.

1117
00:51:26,788 --> 00:51:29,031
But maybe I think labeling it overtly

1118
00:51:29,531 --> 00:51:30,432
early on in that relationship,

1119
00:51:30,472 --> 00:51:32,594
especially there might be like a weird pressure there

1120
00:51:32,734 --> 00:51:35,236
and setting yourself up for some disappointment potentially.

1121
00:51:35,296 --> 00:51:37,779
So that's, I don't know, off the top of my head.

1122
00:51:37,959 --> 00:51:38,840
Nice. Yeah, sure.

1123
00:51:40,799 --> 00:51:43,002
We've got eight and a half minutes.

1124
00:51:43,022 --> 00:51:45,486
You guys can go enjoy GDC or come up to the stage

1125
00:51:45,506 --> 00:51:46,347
and talk after, or fill.

1126
00:51:57,042 --> 00:52:00,804
Do I think these relationships will change at all with streaming services becoming more prevalent?

1127
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:06,448
Yeah, that's the big part of my talk I think I am missing, is that the future is coming soon.

1128
00:52:06,868 --> 00:52:12,031
I think it depends what the execution looks like on what the delivery method of games is there,

1129
00:52:12,091 --> 00:52:14,313
and storefronts or subscriptions or whatever it is.

1130
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,803
I think people are always going to have to fight for your games.

1131
00:52:18,823 --> 00:52:20,144
I think that's just always going to be true.

1132
00:52:21,426 --> 00:52:26,171
And what that means and how it looks on the consumer end will change, but I think it's

1133
00:52:26,211 --> 00:52:28,773
always going to be someone at a company caring about a game.

1134
00:52:28,793 --> 00:52:33,578
I mean, if it goes fully algorithmic and you submit your game and it gets sorted based

1135
00:52:33,638 --> 00:52:37,482
on genre or whatever, it's like, yes, there's a scenario where it is taken out of the hands

1136
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:37,843
of people.

1137
00:52:37,883 --> 00:52:38,283
But I think...

1138
00:52:39,304 --> 00:52:42,466
Even streaming services or subscriptions or whatever,

1139
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:45,488
it's like what games you see when you look at a platform,

1140
00:52:45,548 --> 00:52:47,450
like someone's gotta choose what games to show there.

1141
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:49,451
So I think that's always gonna stay true.

1142
00:52:50,412 --> 00:52:51,893
Or not always, never say always.

1143
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,336
Cool, well thank you guys for coming.
