1
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:09,240
ready to go? Should we do this? All right. Hello, everybody. Thanks for coming. My name is

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,282
Frank. I look like that. I'm putting my Twitter bio up here because I think it's the best

3
00:00:14,442 --> 00:00:19,464
description of my job I've ever given myself. I like to call myself an archivist and historian

4
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:24,186
with a game dev day job because it turns out that's not really a job that pays bills or

5
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:26,447
anything. So I was born back in 82.

6
00:00:27,848 --> 00:00:31,153
I'm going to start this off, I should say, with a little bit of a mini bio.

7
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:32,214
Just bear with me, it makes sense.

8
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:39,185
I was born in 1982 with an Atari in the house, but really my first love was the mighty

9
00:00:39,225 --> 00:00:40,607
Nintendo Entertainment System.

10
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:42,230
I don't know if you guys have ever heard of this.

11
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,991
antiquated device before. This actually came out originally in

12
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:49,472
1985. I was kind of a late comer. So, you know, I had a

13
00:00:49,512 --> 00:00:51,573
couple of games. My neighbors did, too. I played them. It was

14
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:55,214
a toy. I was a kid. But more than that, I had a subscription

15
00:00:55,254 --> 00:00:59,375
to Nintendo Power. This was actually my very first issue.

16
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:02,856
And it was bimonthly at the time, meaning this is the

17
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,376
entirety of what I read for about two months.

18
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:12,741
And I really think of my curiosity and appreciation for the breadth of what video games had to offer started here with this issue

19
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:18,284
reading coverage of games with weird titles like clash at demon head and and

20
00:01:18,804 --> 00:01:20,825
Thank you for that one clap for classic demon head

21
00:01:21,926 --> 00:01:26,349
River City Ransom was in this issue. That was a cool-looking game. There's a game here called

22
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:31,213
Dino Wars about, like, mech dinosaurs. And I remember, I think a lot of us did this sort of

23
00:01:31,353 --> 00:01:35,757
tracing along the map with my finger, like imagining in my head what these weird games must

24
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:41,701
be like to play. So, you know, that was my childhood. And then I became, you know, a dumb

25
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:45,824
teenager and I started playing with one of these instead of a controller. I kind of grew out of

26
00:01:45,884 --> 00:01:50,148
games, whatever that means. I think times were kind of different back then.

27
00:01:50,828 --> 00:01:53,889
There wasn't really a gamer culture that I was a part of.

28
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,910
They were just toys and I grew up,

29
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,991
which was kind of dumb in retrospect.

30
00:01:58,832 --> 00:02:02,393
But that all changed in 1998 when I got my first computer.

31
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:04,534
It looked something like that.

32
00:02:04,694 --> 00:02:06,655
I couldn't find an exact picture of my model.

33
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:08,156
I also looked something like that,

34
00:02:08,236 --> 00:02:09,957
so a little bit kind of like that.

35
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:10,597
I had long hair.

36
00:02:12,418 --> 00:02:17,099
And along with my first computer was my initial access to the Internet, which, yeah, woo,

37
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:20,260
AOL 4.0, yeah, 100 hours free.

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,201
So this is kind of what the Internet looked like back then.

39
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:29,443
And with my access to the Internet, I started looking up things I was kind of nostalgic

40
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:32,123
for, like those video games I used to play when I was a kid.

41
00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:34,664
And I discovered something amazing.

42
00:02:36,024 --> 00:02:39,546
You could download and play Nintendo games on your computer.

43
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:42,367
This is, I'm sorry, this is not Genesis.

44
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:45,469
This is in fact Nesticle, which was the premier

45
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:47,930
Nintendo entertainment system emulator of the time.

46
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:50,191
The word, if you don't get the joke,

47
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:51,812
rhymes with a certain piece of anatomy

48
00:02:51,832 --> 00:02:52,873
that's on about half of us.

49
00:02:54,093 --> 00:02:56,495
The mascot of Nesticle, as you can see here,

50
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,416
is the fecal lord, or shit man,

51
00:02:58,476 --> 00:02:59,836
depending on which part of the screen.

52
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,359
you're looking at. The icon there is a bloody hand that's

53
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:08,461
actually dripping. As you can see, this was sort of the very,

54
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:13,203
very mature emulation scene at the time. But Nesicle ran NES

55
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:16,925
games I grew up with in various degrees of accuracy, coming to

56
00:03:17,045 --> 00:03:19,387
go. In full speed on my computer, I was able to do

57
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:25,137
which was bonkers back then. That was amazing. There was no

58
00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:28,698
digital distribution worth a darn yet. These were cartridges

59
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:33,180
that I barely came across. But, you know, so I started playing

60
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,661
the games I grew up with. I played the games I rented back

61
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:38,722
then maybe. I played the games that my neighbors had. But then

62
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:41,663
I was like, wait, I can play the games that I read about in

63
00:03:41,683 --> 00:03:45,304
Nintendo Power. See what those are about. So Clash of Demon

64
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:47,585
heads turned out, wow, that was a really cool game.

65
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:50,547
River City Ransom, that's almost even cooler.

66
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:52,168
Look, this guy's gonna hit that guy with a tire.

67
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:52,928
That's amazing.

68
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:55,189
And then Dino Wars. ♪♪

69
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,313
The Clash of Demonhead was really good, though.

70
00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:05,135
So I started realizing that I wasn't alone in this.

71
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:07,777
I was getting really interested in what older games were

72
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:09,377
and what they had to offer, and I wasn't alone.

73
00:04:10,358 --> 00:04:14,440
There was an emerging sort of retro gaming community at the time.

74
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,702
These photos are from Classic Gaming Expo 1999. I couldn't find a picture of gross little

75
00:04:19,722 --> 00:04:23,843
teenage me in any of the archives, but this is what the show looked like. This happened

76
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:27,963
to me in my hometown of Las Vegas, and I met a lot of people who shared my interest in

77
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:32,905
this old stuff and in exploring the deeper back catalog of our past. And, you know, I

78
00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:37,026
discovered things that even went beyond the games I had read about. You know, there was

79
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:40,727
stuff that only came out in Japan, like Irem's Only Diver. It was a great game.

80
00:04:41,187 --> 00:04:46,928
There's weird unofficial stuff. There's a Christian-themed Zelda clone where you throw fruit

81
00:04:46,988 --> 00:04:53,170
at Satan to murder him. It's amazing. And there's porn on the Nintendo. That's amazing. Like,

82
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:59,392
what a wacky world that I was suddenly finding myself into. So, you know, I started sort of

83
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:05,434
wondering where these images come from, and I started thinking about what else was out there

84
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:09,876
that I was missing. And it was around this time that I...

85
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:13,299
I remembered a special I'd seen at one point in my life.

86
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:15,182
I think it must have been on AMC or something

87
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,845
about the movies that we've lost.

88
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:20,748
According to the Film Foundation,

89
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:23,131
over half the films made before 1950 are gone,

90
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:23,892
and about 80% of the ones before 1929.

91
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:25,414
I don't mean you can't.

92
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:30,600
buy these on DVD.

93
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,802
I mean, they're gone.

94
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:33,524
They don't exist anymore.

95
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:36,167
And that terrified me.

96
00:05:36,347 --> 00:05:38,129
I mean, I wasn't particularly a film buff,

97
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:42,714
but the idea of these works just disappearing forever

98
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:44,416
and never being recoverable, that's.

99
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:48,137
scared the crap out of me. So I started wondering, is anyone

100
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:51,738
doing this for games? Is anyone making sure that video games

101
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:55,339
aren't doing the same stupid shit that the film did to make

102
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:58,460
their heritage disappear? And, I mean, yeah, there were people

103
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,541
doing this. We didn't call them archivists. We didn't call them

104
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:04,841
digital archaeologists or anything that belongs in a

105
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:08,302
museum. We called them software pirates is what we called them.

106
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:10,383
And we still do, it turns out.

107
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:16,021
But, man, I saw what was going on and I wanted to be one of

108
00:06:16,061 --> 00:06:18,303
those software pirates. I wanted to be in on the ground

109
00:06:18,343 --> 00:06:21,205
floor because I understood at the time, and I still believe

110
00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:23,746
this, that we can't leave preservation up to the content

111
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:26,488
owners. And the only way to ensure this stuff was safe was

112
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:30,190
to make sure it was easily accessible to anyone. But I

113
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,691
wanted to be an effective pirate.

114
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:34,792
I didn't want to do like the little niggling things that

115
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:35,432
people can do.

116
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:38,553
I wanted to really strike.

117
00:06:38,573 --> 00:06:41,894
And I started thinking, which games were the most volatile?

118
00:06:42,014 --> 00:06:46,136
Which games were in the most danger of disappearing if no

119
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:47,316
one did anything about them?

120
00:06:47,796 --> 00:06:50,797
And the conclusion I came up with was games that never

121
00:06:50,897 --> 00:06:52,458
actually shipped to stores.

122
00:06:53,518 --> 00:06:55,659
This is a very small selection.

123
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:58,802
of the games for the Nintendo entertainment system only.

124
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:01,064
They never actually shipped.

125
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:04,147
And, you know, nowadays, yeah, games get canceled

126
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:06,189
because they're crap, usually, or they're unfinished.

127
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,173
Nintendo era, the NES era, was kind of a weird time

128
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:10,834
because

129
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:16,219
Nintendo's policy meant that you could only release five games a year if you were a publisher.

130
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,202
Games were so cheap to make, and they were making so much money,

131
00:07:19,283 --> 00:07:23,847
that they would just throw everything at the wall and just come up with the five best ones, basically.

132
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:28,232
So a lot of games that didn't ship were actually good games, or at least interesting,

133
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:32,656
but for one reason or another, they just didn't ship them because they had better things to do.

134
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:38,443
These games, these would still sometimes exist in playable

135
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:42,707
form on what collectors would call prototype cartridges.

136
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:46,332
So these are temporary things that are disposable,

137
00:07:46,372 --> 00:07:50,116
that are made to be used temporarily.

138
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:54,361
They're actually stored on EPROMs, which are temporary media.

139
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:57,643
So these cartridges for games like these,

140
00:07:57,763 --> 00:08:00,644
like, you know, that is the only copy in the world

141
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:02,864
anyone knows of of California Raisins

142
00:08:02,944 --> 00:08:04,325
for the Nintendo, for example.

143
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:08,066
These are games that there might only be one left of

144
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:11,707
that's just slowly dying, and that's horrifying.

145
00:08:12,307 --> 00:08:14,848
And it's not like these are just unknown games,

146
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:17,628
there were weird games like Bio Force Ape

147
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:20,909
that were discussed in Nintendo Power.

148
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:23,010
Not that exact same issue, but later on.

149
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:24,330
So.

150
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,952
So I dedicated myself to this. I started sort of tracking down,

151
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:30,393
you know, working with collectors to track down these

152
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:34,115
prototypes, talking to programmers, you know, who might

153
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:37,336
still have something in their garage. I started a website in

154
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:41,858
2003 called Lost Levels. And this was, you know, my first

155
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:44,219
attempt at really preserving video game history. I

156
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:45,460
recognized at the time

157
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,221
that preservation was more than just a playable binary of a

158
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:54,682
game. Game preservation to me is also everything surrounding

159
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:56,842
the game, the people, the stories, the history, the

160
00:08:56,882 --> 00:09:01,743
ephemera. So what I did was in addition to frankly pirating the

161
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:05,184
video game online for everyone to download, I also, when I

162
00:09:05,264 --> 00:09:07,484
could, which wasn't very often because I wasn't a very good

163
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:10,505
journalist yet, tracked down the people who actually worked on

164
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:13,366
them to get the story behind them and find out why they

165
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:13,966
didn't come out.

166
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:20,190
And sort of unexpectedly, people took notice of my work.

167
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,532
I was writing articles and so were the other people on my

168
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:24,173
team, but I started getting work.

169
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:26,795
I started freelancing for magazines and reviewing games

170
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:27,216
and stuff.

171
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:29,718
I suddenly found myself a video game journalist, which

172
00:09:29,758 --> 00:09:30,158
was cool.

173
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,203
In 2005, I took my first job at a website that some of you

174
00:09:35,223 --> 00:09:35,783
may have heard of.

175
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:36,844
It's called Gamasutra.

176
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:39,646
If you weren't around back then, yeah, that really was

177
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:40,527
the color scheme.

178
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,508
I had nothing to do with that.

179
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,830
I took an editorial job here in 2005.

180
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,192
Simon Carless, who's still around,

181
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,114
he's actually running this conference,

182
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,155
took a chance on me, which is really cool.

183
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:55,398
But, you know, even as I'm doing this journalism stuff,

184
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,441
my primary interest in anything I do related to games

185
00:09:59,502 --> 00:10:00,762
is preserving its history.

186
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:03,905
So, even at Gamasutra, I sort of took that with me.

187
00:10:03,945 --> 00:10:06,026
I started a column where I would track down

188
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:08,628
people from the industry's past

189
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:10,310
who weren't so active anymore and just kind of,

190
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,292
kind of ask them what they've been up to, sort of get their

191
00:10:12,352 --> 00:10:15,535
story, because I felt like if no one did that, if I didn't do

192
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:16,537
that, no one else is going to.

193
00:10:16,597 --> 00:10:19,360
Like, for example, this is sort of a rare, modern

194
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,723
interview with Mike Berlin, who was a very influential

195
00:10:22,763 --> 00:10:23,825
Infocom game author.

196
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:26,407
He also created Bubsy the Bobcat, the butt of many

197
00:10:26,468 --> 00:10:28,390
jokes, but Bubsy was OK.

198
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:31,893
After Gamma Suture, I worked at a company called Game Tap.

199
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:34,356
We were a Turner broadcasting product.

200
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,958
We were a games on demand subscription service,

201
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:39,881
which is an idea that's still way ahead of its time.

202
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:41,803
But again, you know, working there,

203
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:44,225
a lot of what I did was help make sure

204
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:46,287
that these older games were still in print,

205
00:10:46,327 --> 00:10:47,508
that they were still around,

206
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:49,070
like Castlevania, for example.

207
00:10:50,852 --> 00:10:53,854
But like I said, way ahead of its time, didn't last so long,

208
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:54,955
kind of went under.

209
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:56,537
So I actually went back to editorial,

210
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:57,858
I got a job at 1UP.

211
00:10:57,998 --> 00:11:00,020
Again, just bringing that history thing with me,

212
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,881
like wherever I go.

213
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:03,503
That's what I secretly want to be doing.

214
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:06,445
And every job I've ever had, it was an excuse

215
00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:07,927
to stay close to preserving history.

216
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:08,367
That's just the guy.

217
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:15,309
I am. So even at 1UP, I started doing more oral history reporting. This article is fantastic.

218
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:21,710
Please look it up. I love it. I had a column at Games TM magazine in the U.K. every month

219
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,091
about game history. I actually went back to Gamma Sutro because they had better colors

220
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:32,912
now, so they let me back in. And I did articles like this one, just like this gigantic article

221
00:11:32,952 --> 00:11:35,953
trying to figure out when Super Mario Brothers was first sold in the U.S.

222
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:38,715
don't actually know. I can't substantiate that date. That's

223
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:44,520
really weird to me. But now I'm making games. So for about the

224
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,142
last three years I've been at a studio on the other side of the

225
00:11:47,162 --> 00:11:51,125
bay called Other Ocean. I work on a game called IDARB. Some of

226
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:53,948
you might have seen me give a micro post-mortem of this last

227
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:56,090
year with the lead developer Mike Micah.

228
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,233
I am still the only person to direct an official game

229
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:03,614
based on the Sharknado film franchise.

230
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:07,597
Sharknado the video game, which, thank you, Keith,

231
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:11,419
which you can no longer download on the App Store.

232
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,420
for less than a year. It's not because it was bad, it was a

233
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,922
licensing thing. The last project I worked on just shipped

234
00:12:17,962 --> 00:12:21,363
is called Mega Man Legacy Collection. So again, you're

235
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:24,764
kind of seeing a trend here, right? Everywhere I go, I try to

236
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:29,445
veer it toward preserving history. The idea with Mega Man

237
00:12:29,485 --> 00:12:32,667
Legacy Collection was we wanted to create a boutique package

238
00:12:32,727 --> 00:12:35,467
and really preserve these games for future generations in a way

239
00:12:35,508 --> 00:12:38,208
that made sense commercially. We will get back to Mega Man, I

240
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:41,329
promise, but I want to get to the point of what we're all here

241
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:41,630
about.

242
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:48,713
really dirty word, emulation. Evil, evil emulation. I think

243
00:12:48,773 --> 00:12:50,534
emulation has gotten a bad rap over the years.

244
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:54,368
I think that we all, not all, but I think the industry and

245
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:57,790
even our consumers have a really basic misconception of

246
00:12:57,831 --> 00:12:58,591
what emulation is.

247
00:12:58,651 --> 00:13:01,493
What emulation is, and I'm simplifying it a bit, emulation

248
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:03,234
is software that makes a computer act like a different

249
00:13:03,254 --> 00:13:03,634
computer.

250
00:13:03,694 --> 00:13:03,994
That's it.

251
00:13:04,194 --> 00:13:04,715
It's a tool.

252
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:06,736
And it's a great one for many uses.

253
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:09,858
Emulation is not illegal.

254
00:13:10,138 --> 00:13:11,078
It's not threatening.

255
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:11,999
It's not unprofessional.

256
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:12,940
It's not lazy.

257
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,801
It's not the same thing as software piracy.

258
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:17,522
It's not free.

259
00:13:19,644 --> 00:13:22,466
But this is the perception that people have.

260
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:25,208
And when we first started going around to clients

261
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:27,730
pitching the idea of bringing back some of this NES

262
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,792
back catalog, what we commonly heard from them

263
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,114
is that we couldn't emulate a Nintendo console

264
00:13:33,154 --> 00:13:34,495
without Nintendo's approval.

265
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,476
The implication being that there was something

266
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,678
inherent to the NES that could not legally

267
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:40,159
be replicated in software.

268
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,541
And that the only place you could legally emulate

269
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:44,182
an NES game was on a piece of hardware

270
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:46,124
marketed and sold by Nintendo itself.

271
00:13:46,184 --> 00:13:47,024
But you know what?

272
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:50,686
No emulator has ever been ruled illegal in a court of law.

273
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,846
That has never happened.

274
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:54,327
And in fact, they tried, but we'll get there soon.

275
00:13:55,387 --> 00:13:57,628
But still, this persists.

276
00:13:57,888 --> 00:14:00,489
And in fact, Nintendo's legal page right now,

277
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:03,530
if you go to their website, has this language that I looked.

278
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,990
It's been up there for 16 years.

279
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:10,114
years now about how the distribution of emulation,

280
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:12,616
it's going to ruin the industry.

281
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:14,057
It's like the worst thing that's ever happened.

282
00:14:14,097 --> 00:14:16,018
I'm paraphrasing because I can't look behind myself

283
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:17,760
without talking to the mic.

284
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,302
But, you know, notice this last question where

285
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:22,643
how come Nintendo doesn't take a step

286
00:14:22,683 --> 00:14:24,225
toward legitimizing emulators?

287
00:14:24,245 --> 00:14:27,807
That's like asking why Nintendo doesn't legitimize piracy.

288
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:29,128
It doesn't make any business sense.

289
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:34,070
except they actually have legitimized emulators by selling you emulators.

290
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,611
The virtual console is nothing but emulations of Nintendo games.

291
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:44,553
And in fact, if you were to download Super Mario Brothers on the Wii virtual console,

292
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:51,336
so on the left there is a ROM that I downloaded from a ROM site of Super Mario Brothers.

293
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:54,557
The same file has been there since... it's got a time stamp on it of like 1996.

294
00:14:56,257 --> 00:15:01,422
On the right is Nintendo's virtual console version of Super Mario Bros.

295
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:05,585
I want you to pay particular attention to the hex values that I've highlighted here.

296
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:08,207
That is what's called an Inest header.

297
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:14,592
An Inest header is a header format developed by amateur software emulators in the late

298
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:15,173
90s.

299
00:15:15,553 --> 00:15:17,555
What's that doing in a Nintendo product?

300
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:23,380
I would posit that Nintendo downloaded Super Mario Bros. from the Internet and sold it

301
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:23,840
back to you.

302
00:15:28,726 --> 00:15:32,527
Like, not only could no one prove that there's anything wrong with emulation,

303
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:35,589
like Nintendo is pirating its own ROMs and selling it to you.

304
00:15:35,849 --> 00:15:37,810
But let me put this back up on screen for you.

305
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,591
No one has ever ruled emulation illegal. It's never happened.

306
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:48,194
But regardless of that truth, it was actually cheaper for us to come up with a method

307
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:50,915
to circumvent what was technically emulation

308
00:15:50,935 --> 00:15:54,156
than it was to hire a lawyer to prove this to our clients.

309
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:57,438
clients. So that's what we did with Mega Man Legacy Collection.

310
00:15:57,478 --> 00:16:01,940
We came up with a workaround. It works really great. The

311
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,002
result is that we can now run original NES games exactly as

312
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:08,163
they would run in an emulator, but without actually emulating

313
00:16:08,203 --> 00:16:11,325
the CPU on the user end. It's a lot of extra work for the exact

314
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:14,566
same goal. It's kind of a waste of time, if you ask me, but it

315
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:19,949
got us a project. So, okay, when and why did emulation become a

316
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:20,450
dirty word?

317
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,591
I don't know that there's an easy answer to that,

318
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:25,872
but I think it all started in January of 1999.

319
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:29,393
I'm gonna let a young Steve Jobs

320
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:31,454
at that month's Mac World tell you why.

321
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:35,275
So we're really, really excited about games,

322
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:37,656
and again, our goal is to have

323
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:39,737
the best game machine in the world.

324
00:16:40,017 --> 00:16:41,978
Now, this is another game machine.

325
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:44,599
It's the most popular game machine in the world.

326
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,500
Wouldn't it be great if we could play

327
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,421
some of those titles too?

328
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:54,678
Hmm well at Macworld today

329
00:16:55,718 --> 00:17:00,722
Connectix is introducing the virtual game station. It is software

330
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:12,411
It is software that they're gonna sell for $49 that turns your Mac into a Sony PlayStation it plays

331
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:19,285
This was huge. The virtual game station was the first emulator to run commercial PlayStation

332
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:24,449
games at playable speeds. It was also one of the first commercial emulators, as Steve

333
00:17:24,469 --> 00:17:29,573
just said. Thank you, by the way, Steve. They sold it for 50 bucks. And I read a report

334
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:33,436
that said they made $3 million in revenue selling this emulator. But it's not just

335
00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:37,700
to display PlayStation games. This was the first time in history that you could play

336
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,484
contemporary games that you could buy at Best Buy in full speed on your computer.

337
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:48,588
And, you know, it only ran real disks. You couldn't do pirated

338
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:51,130
software on it. But, of course, the hackers got around that

339
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,733
really quickly. And then just a couple weeks later was the first

340
00:17:55,233 --> 00:18:00,037
Nintendo 64 full speed emulator that ran commercial games on a

341
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:04,240
PC. Came in January 28th, the first and only release of this

342
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,303
emulator. It was compatible with 17 games at the time, including

343
00:18:08,343 --> 00:18:10,785
The Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time, a title that had just hit

344
00:18:10,805 --> 00:18:12,426
the American shelves two months prior.

345
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:16,587
two months prior. You could just download a seven megabyte file,

346
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:18,808
which even at the crappy speeds we had back then was an

347
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:24,869
attainable thing. There had been some discussion of stuff like

348
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:27,530
MAME before this, but this is really when you started seeing

349
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:32,671
emulation in the headlines. And the impact on the amateur

350
00:18:32,691 --> 00:18:36,132
emulation world is huge. Before this, I think emulators were

351
00:18:36,172 --> 00:18:38,652
primarily seen as tools to relive the days of gaming's

352
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:40,433
past, sort of a gray market.

353
00:18:40,993 --> 00:18:42,635
piracy tool for niche hobbyists.

354
00:18:42,695 --> 00:18:45,898
Not really something that the industry took notice of,

355
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,782
but all of a sudden people could download console games

356
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:51,824
that were on the store shelves at that moment

357
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,246
and pirate them for free.

358
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:55,888
Console piracy has always existed,

359
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,970
but the barrier to entry was high enough

360
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,173
that this was a niche segment of the market

361
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:03,176
requiring special hardware or modifying your console.

362
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:06,979
for the first time in history console games were on the same

363
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,404
level as PC games as far as ease of use to pirating. So this is

364
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:15,368
when you started, this is when that discussion became public.

365
00:19:15,748 --> 00:19:20,633
This is when lawsuits started getting thrown around. In fact,

366
00:19:20,713 --> 00:19:25,078
Sony did take Connectix to court and, well, they lost.

367
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:30,448
The judge over a year and a half trial or something like that

368
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:34,095
found that Connectix was not violating any of Sony's

369
00:19:34,396 --> 00:19:35,638
trademarks or patents.

370
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:41,933
And, you know, it's funny, like, this was not just a Sony versus

371
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:48,597
Connectix case. Sony was backed by Nintendo and Sega in this

372
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:52,399
court case. Like, this was the console game industry versus

373
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:57,342
emulation, the court battle. And emulation won. Sony tried again

374
00:19:57,602 --> 00:20:00,984
with an emulator called BLEEM. I don't know if anyone remembers

375
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:01,224
BLEEM.

376
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:02,645
That got thrown out, too.

377
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,306
So the two times that I'm aware of

378
00:20:05,346 --> 00:20:07,928
that an emulator's ever been challenged in court,

379
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:09,428
it was found to be fine.

380
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:12,230
So if you were a software publisher

381
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,991
that owned games that were originally published

382
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:16,512
on vintage Nintendo hardware,

383
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:18,573
this is the best thing that could have happened to you.

384
00:20:18,914 --> 00:20:20,915
All of a sudden, the doors were open.

385
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:22,636
You could start republishing your content

386
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:23,296
wherever you want.

387
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:25,437
You're no longer locked into Nintendo's ecosystem.

388
00:20:26,077 --> 00:20:26,478
And yet,

389
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:33,009
This is a list, this isn't entirely scientific, it's just a quick Wikipedia scrape. But these

390
00:20:33,249 --> 00:20:39,353
are third party games available on Nintendo's virtual console right now for the Wii U and the

391
00:20:39,593 --> 00:20:45,817
3DS. These are games not published by Nintendo that you can buy emulated versions of on

392
00:20:45,857 --> 00:20:52,422
Nintendo platforms. There's 156 of them. The next slide is going to highlight which ones of

393
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:55,584
these you can buy on platforms that aren't owned by Nintendo.

394
00:20:56,472 --> 00:21:00,797
Oh, that's interesting. Huh. Those look familiar. There's

395
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:04,821
absolutely no reason for this. This is lost revenue. There are

396
00:21:05,121 --> 00:21:07,403
150 classic games here that we know have had all their rights

397
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:09,846
cleared for redistribution because they're for sale right

398
00:21:09,886 --> 00:21:13,449
now. All of these can be in print everywhere forever for a

399
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:17,073
pretty low up front investment and emulation is the key to

400
00:21:17,113 --> 00:21:17,273
that.

401
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:23,211
Emulation is, I'm just going to read the slide, emulation is the cheapest, safest and best way

402
00:21:23,271 --> 00:21:30,157
to republish an older video game on modern hardware. Thank you. There are pros and cons.

403
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:36,062
It's cheaper and safer than porting. There's no source code required like traditional

404
00:21:36,102 --> 00:21:41,426
porting requires. Emulation for the most part is portable and cross platform. The development

405
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:47,011
you work that you do to emulate a game is directly applicable to getting other games to

406
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:47,211
work.

407
00:21:47,731 --> 00:21:51,395
And the games play just as they did back in the day, exactly as

408
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:55,198
they did. Cons, they play exactly as they did back in the

409
00:21:55,238 --> 00:22:00,383
day. It's very difficult to fix legacy bugs. You can't really go

410
00:22:00,503 --> 00:22:04,026
in and easily change, you know, system limitations that would

411
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:07,870
require, that would make games flicker and stuff like that.

412
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,353
It's even harder to add new features than it is to fix bugs.

413
00:22:11,894 --> 00:22:14,474
and you can't really easily add new levels

414
00:22:14,514 --> 00:22:16,675
unless you're going in and directly hacking the binary,

415
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:18,715
which people do, but we don't have time for that.

416
00:22:20,075 --> 00:22:22,656
And potentially, potentially, there's a higher CPU

417
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:24,576
requirement than a direct port would require,

418
00:22:24,856 --> 00:22:27,237
but for vintage consoles, it doesn't really matter so much.

419
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:31,238
But yet, we continue porting, and I would argue

420
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:34,118
that porting, by its nature, will always be

421
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:36,419
a derivative work, that is not the original work,

422
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,399
that is a remake.

423
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:41,001
You cannot port a game without sacrificing something that was

424
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,503
in the original. There will be new bugs, there will be

425
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:46,564
inconsistencies, there will be flaws. And while sometimes the

426
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:49,666
only valid option, porting a game from source and expecting

427
00:22:50,186 --> 00:22:52,148
100% faithful reproduction of the original is both a pipe

428
00:22:52,168 --> 00:22:56,290
dream and a financial black hole. As nice as extra features

429
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,232
are to have, a ported game is not the original game, it's a

430
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:02,834
remake. While remakes can be great complementary pieces to

431
00:23:02,854 --> 00:23:05,896
the original work, that original work should also be available.

432
00:23:06,556 --> 00:23:11,001
I reject the notion that a classic video game needs a new coat of paint in order to be valid.

433
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:15,666
I think, and this might be a controversial opinion here at the Game Developers Conference,

434
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:19,170
but I think video games are an undeniable part of our history and cultural make-up

435
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,993
and they should be preserved exactly as they were, blemishes and all.

436
00:23:23,895 --> 00:23:27,619
This is a game called DuckTales Remastered. This is a remake of

437
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:31,623
an NES game called DuckTales, strangely enough. Pretty cool

438
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:35,647
game. They did a great job redoing the art. They changed a

439
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:39,551
lot of stuff. This is the original DuckTales. I like this

440
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:43,675
game even better, but maybe I'm biased. I'm kind of old. The

441
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:47,939
problem is you can only get the remake of DuckTales.

442
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,384
the original is just gone. It's been out of print since 1989.

443
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:58,829
But, and you know, like, maybe that's okay. Maybe people

444
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,273
prefer the remake. Maybe we don't need the old one. And

445
00:24:02,313 --> 00:24:04,595
maybe we should throw away the original King Kong because that

446
00:24:04,615 --> 00:24:07,357
Peter Jackson version is way prettier, right? Like, who

447
00:24:07,397 --> 00:24:08,058
needs the old one?

448
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:12,080
This is a re-release of the first Zelda game from Nintendo.

449
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,741
Nintendo changed the script at the beginning.

450
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:16,502
And yeah, that's a much better script.

451
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:17,582
It's much better translated.

452
00:24:17,602 --> 00:24:20,063
That's probably what they originally meant.

453
00:24:20,484 --> 00:24:23,425
And maybe Lucas originally meant for Greedo to shoot first.

454
00:24:23,485 --> 00:24:26,226
Let's just keep that and throw the original away.

455
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:30,188
Sometimes companies do try to toe the line between a remake

456
00:24:30,228 --> 00:24:30,928
and an original.

457
00:24:30,988 --> 00:24:33,909
This is a screenshot from The Secret of Monkey Island,

458
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,390
whatever it was called, special edition?

459
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:36,870
Special edition.

460
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:43,876
And these are remastered graphics. They're new. And this

461
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,538
is the original that's in there. You can switch back and forth

462
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:50,041
kind of like that, but in a better effect. Whatever you want

463
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:53,805
in the game. And this is cool. Except that ain't even the

464
00:24:53,845 --> 00:24:56,867
original Monkey Island. The original was a 16-color EGA

465
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,550
version. And that version is unavailable anywhere. That is

466
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,112
the version directed by the game's director, Ron Gilbert,

467
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:02,713
the only one.

468
00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:07,715
That is the version with the art by Mark Ferrari that was drawn over for that other version.

469
00:25:07,955 --> 00:25:10,736
Like, that's the real Monkey Island and we can't play that.

470
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:15,097
And, you know, so even when they try, like, you can screw it up.

471
00:25:15,277 --> 00:25:23,661
And again, I don't know, maybe people prefer the additional 240 colors and the CD soundtrack over the MIDI.

472
00:25:24,101 --> 00:25:28,082
And maybe they like Pride and Prejudice better with zombies, so we should just kill the original.

473
00:25:28,302 --> 00:25:29,763
I mean, what's the point of it?

474
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:33,724
I want to make a point that I don't think I'm just a

475
00:25:33,864 --> 00:25:36,545
particularly nostalgic person who likes old games and that

476
00:25:36,565 --> 00:25:39,145
there's no market for them. I think old games are very

477
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:43,046
popular right now. Here's that same DuckTales game being played

478
00:25:43,086 --> 00:25:45,827
in 2014 on Awesome Games Done Quick. This is an incredibly

479
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:47,967
popular event where speed runners play through games.

480
00:25:48,328 --> 00:25:50,908
Tons of people watch them. How much? There's 40,000 people.

481
00:25:52,987 --> 00:25:56,868
A couple years ago, watching someone play the 8-bit version of DuckTales.

482
00:25:57,388 --> 00:26:03,291
And, okay, yeah, 40,000 people are probably always watching that stream, no matter what game's on there, right?

483
00:26:03,371 --> 00:26:07,652
I went to YouTube a couple days ago, I searched for DuckTales NES, and just filtered it over the last week.

484
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:12,014
There are several new videos over the last week of this one random NES game that I picked.

485
00:26:12,334 --> 00:26:14,555
It was a popular game, but I picked it randomly.

486
00:26:15,015 --> 00:26:16,976
And this is a game that people still want to play.

487
00:26:17,196 --> 00:26:19,477
And the only legal way they can do it

488
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:20,918
is to go on eBay and do this.

489
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:24,999
It's to get a vintage NES console that spits out

490
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:27,380
the 240p signal that most of your damn TVs

491
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:31,182
don't even support anymore, and to get this collector's item

492
00:26:31,242 --> 00:26:31,782
cartridge.

493
00:26:31,822 --> 00:26:34,003
That's the only legal way to play DuckTales.

494
00:26:34,023 --> 00:26:35,463
And that's weird to me.

495
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:37,364
But I don't know.

496
00:26:37,504 --> 00:26:37,824
Maybe.

497
00:26:38,825 --> 00:26:42,407
Maybe there's not much of a market for content from 1989

498
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:46,550
anymore. So let's do a little quick study. This is IMDB's most

499
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,512
popular films of 1989. I didn't even bother scrolling down the

500
00:26:50,532 --> 00:26:53,935
pages, just quick exercise. So I think Batman and Ghostbusters

501
00:26:53,975 --> 00:26:58,177
may be unfair comparisons. Dead Poets Society, pretty good movie

502
00:26:58,197 --> 00:27:00,719
but not really DuckTales. I think the most DuckTales

503
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,560
equivalent here would be Uncle Buck.

504
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:07,148
Uncle Buck was a John Candy Macaulay Culkin vehicle.

505
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:09,529
It was actually a pretty good movie, I think.

506
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:11,609
It's one of those movies where I think I've seen it,

507
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:12,549
but I'm not sure.

508
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,630
I have positive feelings about it for some reason.

509
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,371
So, as you might imagine, at the time it was released,

510
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:21,431
you know, whatever formats made sense at the time.

511
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:24,272
There was VHS, there was Betamax in the middle,

512
00:27:24,312 --> 00:27:25,552
there's a LaserDisc version.

513
00:27:26,973 --> 00:27:28,693
So did Uncle Buck make the transition

514
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:31,094
to the future formats?

515
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,794
Oh yeah, there's a widescreen DVD,

516
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:32,974
there's...

517
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:36,097
probably a full screen DVD for people who are stupid and don't

518
00:27:36,137 --> 00:27:39,179
like the black lines. They even reprinted it with slightly

519
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:42,102
different packaging. You can get it with Brewster's millions.

520
00:27:42,502 --> 00:27:45,765
You can get it with Brewster's millions and also stripes. You

521
00:27:45,785 --> 00:27:48,688
can get it with whatever the great outdoors is. You can get

522
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:52,011
it with the great outdoors and also whatever that is going

523
00:27:52,051 --> 00:27:52,491
berserk.

524
00:27:53,592 --> 00:27:56,873
You can get it in a classic comedy pack for cheap. You can

525
00:27:56,893 --> 00:27:59,414
get it on Blu-ray. If you're a true Uncle Buck connoisseur, you

526
00:27:59,434 --> 00:28:03,595
can get it in 1080P on Blu-ray or on Blu-ray with a digital

527
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,596
copy. There's a variant there, too. You can get it with Fletch

528
00:28:06,896 --> 00:28:10,277
on Blu-ray. And it's more than just physical. You can get it

529
00:28:10,597 --> 00:28:13,839
digitally however you want. You go on Amazon right now, you can

530
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:17,040
get it. You can get it on iTunes. You can get it on Google

531
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,601
Play. Get Uncle Buck on whatever Cinema Now is. But you shouldn't

532
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:22,281
get it on Amazon because it's $14, which is more than the

533
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:22,661
other ones.

534
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:27,345
Voodoo. You can go on YouTube and just watch Uncle Buck. You

535
00:28:27,365 --> 00:28:29,967
just pay YouTube some money and watch Uncle Buck right now. Go

536
00:28:29,987 --> 00:28:34,630
on Flixster where it's even more expensive. You can buy it from

537
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,673
Microsoft and Sony on their video game consoles and watch

538
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:42,616
it. And yet you can't buy DuckTales. And there is, it

539
00:28:42,656 --> 00:28:45,698
turns out, a new HD version of Uncle Buck, but they didn't go

540
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:48,000
and get rid of the old one. They kept the other one in print

541
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,021
because it's still valid.

542
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,103
But okay, maybe DuckTales is an anomaly.

543
00:28:54,444 --> 00:28:58,085
Let's look at 1989 in video games on Wikipedia.

544
00:28:58,366 --> 00:29:00,807
This is their list of what they consider notable games,

545
00:29:00,847 --> 00:29:01,927
the editors of Wikipedia.

546
00:29:02,027 --> 00:29:03,708
I would argue for several more than this,

547
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:04,869
but you know, this is fine.

548
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:05,609
This is a good starting point.

549
00:29:05,629 --> 00:29:06,570
It's just a quick exercise.

550
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,531
Great stuff on here, right?

551
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:09,491
There's 16 of them.

552
00:29:10,432 --> 00:29:11,612
So those are all of them.

553
00:29:11,692 --> 00:29:12,893
How many can you buy right now?

554
00:29:13,393 --> 00:29:14,334
Think about five of them.

555
00:29:14,374 --> 00:29:16,975
That's a respectable, what, like 30% or something?

556
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,896
How many of these can you buy in more than one place?

557
00:29:20,572 --> 00:29:21,392
Oh, that's interesting.

558
00:29:23,393 --> 00:29:24,854
Theme just keeps coming up.

559
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:27,595
OK, but how does that actually compare to film?

560
00:29:27,815 --> 00:29:29,296
All right, here are the top grossing films of 89.

561
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:31,677
We don't know the top grossing games of 89, because our

562
00:29:31,717 --> 00:29:33,297
industry is shit at tracking sales.

563
00:29:33,557 --> 00:29:34,378
Sorry if you're young.

564
00:29:35,878 --> 00:29:38,780
But these are the top 10 grossing films of 89.

565
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,742
period. How many of those can you get right now? Oh, you can

566
00:29:42,762 --> 00:29:45,625
get all of them right now. But how many of them can you get

567
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:48,407
cross device, cross platform? Oh, you can get all of them,

568
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:52,270
cross device, cross platform. Every one of these, you can rent

569
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,432
an SD, you can rent an HD, you can buy an SD, you can buy an

570
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:57,634
HD, with the exception of Little Mermaid, you can't rent Little

571
00:29:57,654 --> 00:30:00,656
Mermaid. All of them are on Blu-ray except for Look Who's

572
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:03,118
Talking. I'm sorry if you're a huge fan of Look Who's Talking.

573
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:10,205
But, like, these movies have always been in print, and games could have been the same way,

574
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:15,651
except that we demonized emulation, and by demonizing emulation instead of embracing it,

575
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:22,217
we've devalued our heritage. Emulated classic console games are now presumed free. By not

576
00:30:22,277 --> 00:30:27,463
embracing it as a tool, we've relegated the majority of our past to piracy, and that's sad.

577
00:30:27,923 --> 00:30:31,265
Not because I weep for the lost revenues of corporations, but

578
00:30:31,305 --> 00:30:33,967
because this has had a direct impact on keeping our very

579
00:30:33,987 --> 00:30:37,629
history alive, on maintaining the franchises that we love, on

580
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,130
supporting the creators that made them, and all of this

581
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:42,812
could have been prevented if we'd embraced it instead of

582
00:30:42,892 --> 00:30:45,954
fighting it, but we messed up. This is not to say there's no

583
00:30:45,994 --> 00:30:48,636
such thing as commercial emulation. There are releases.

584
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:52,358
I just pulled a couple examples here. This is on the Humble

585
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:52,698
Store.

586
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,380
SNK recently started selling emulated versions of its classic

587
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,041
games for the Neo Geo console. These run in a browser. They run

588
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:03,883
wonderfully. The emulation is great. They're $8 a pop. Totally

589
00:31:03,923 --> 00:31:07,524
bare bones, though. There's no online or anything. I don't even

590
00:31:07,544 --> 00:31:10,645
think you can reconfigure your buttons. But the games work only

591
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:13,907
in your browser. So you're sort of limited to what you can do.

592
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:18,897
but there's stuff on consoles too. There's the arcade archive

593
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:21,280
series from hamster. These are wonderfully emulated as well.

594
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:25,764
Exclusively on the PS4. They do one of these a month. They're

595
00:31:25,785 --> 00:31:30,289
also $8 each. And these are just two examples. There's others I

596
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:33,512
could name. There's project egg in Japan does MSX stuff.

597
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:37,134
There's the occasional semi-random emulated games on

598
00:31:37,174 --> 00:31:40,134
mobile marketplaces. Someone tried to sell Bubsy on Steam for

599
00:31:40,174 --> 00:31:43,315
some reason. And of course there's Nintendo's virtual

600
00:31:43,355 --> 00:31:46,496
console. But I don't think these work to keep the games alive

601
00:31:46,536 --> 00:31:51,957
because these piecemeal releases are very limited. They're

602
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:55,378
usually on a single platform. The selection is just bizarrely

603
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:58,138
random because it's just the stuff people happen to be able

604
00:31:58,178 --> 00:32:01,259
to clear the rights up for easily. They don't tend to add

605
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,660
any value. And in the end...

606
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:10,924
they're selling you a ROM for $8 and there's a certain audience of people, emulation savvy

607
00:32:10,964 --> 00:32:16,788
people, who have this stuff for free and are playing it in a superior experience with stuff

608
00:32:16,808 --> 00:32:24,272
like MAME. And I think that we've sort of considered these people a lost cause. Like,

609
00:32:24,332 --> 00:32:28,715
oh, those are the pirates. They would never buy the games. But I challenge that notion.

610
00:32:30,521 --> 00:32:36,008
people who love old games enough to go out of their way to make them play, that is, that

611
00:32:36,048 --> 00:32:39,793
should be our target audience. That should be exactly who we're selling to. These are

612
00:32:39,813 --> 00:32:42,256
my people, and if I can sell to them, I can sell to anyone.

613
00:32:43,653 --> 00:32:47,955
So at Digital Eclipse, we have a specific approach. We make

614
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:52,397
boutique packages for fans and collectors. Our approach is to

615
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:56,019
sell them with as much source material as is possible to sort

616
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:59,021
of stick in the package. Create a package with a lot of added

617
00:32:59,081 --> 00:33:01,962
value, stuff it with as much as we can, sell it on every

618
00:33:02,002 --> 00:33:05,624
platform that makes sense. As I said when I relaunched, when I

619
00:33:05,644 --> 00:33:08,726
helped to relaunch Digital Eclipse last year, because it's

620
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:10,907
actually an old brand that we just brought back, we're

621
00:33:11,547 --> 00:33:22,314
We feel that classic video games deserve the equivalent of the Criterion Collection, a curated selection of important pieces of history restored to their original condition, packed with bonuses to help contextualize and celebrate that work.

622
00:33:22,994 --> 00:33:27,377
For certain games, I think this kind of package has significantly more sales potential than simply selling a playable ROM.

623
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:34,242
So we were fortunate enough to find a partner in Capcom for

624
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,363
Mega Man Legacy Collection, which was our first attempt at

625
00:33:36,403 --> 00:33:39,984
this. Legacy Collection collects the original six Mega Man games

626
00:33:40,004 --> 00:33:42,885
for the NES. We wanted to create a package that would provide

627
00:33:42,905 --> 00:33:44,886
value for anyone interested in these games, even if they

628
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:47,367
already owned them or emulated them or whatever. We wanted to

629
00:33:47,387 --> 00:33:49,287
create a collector's edition that fans would want to keep on

630
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:52,528
their shelves, you know, even if it wasn't physical, just

631
00:33:52,588 --> 00:33:54,389
mentally shit in their shelves, I guess.

632
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,332
include anything we need our hands on.

633
00:33:56,852 --> 00:33:58,695
I want to quickly show off some of the features

634
00:33:58,735 --> 00:33:59,997
that we added to this effect.

635
00:34:00,017 --> 00:34:01,139
This is not a sales pitch.

636
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:04,464
I just want to show this stuff off because it's cool.

637
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:08,650
So this is the museum that's in the game.

638
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:13,492
Fortunately, Capcom kept a lot of the original art, so there's a lot of promotional work.

639
00:34:13,532 --> 00:34:16,953
These are from a marketing guide. This is concept art.

640
00:34:17,593 --> 00:34:22,354
Look how cool this is. You can zoom in on these things.

641
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:26,375
There's something like 800 pieces in the package, which is awesome.

642
00:34:27,015 --> 00:34:29,796
This is a screenshot from a prior re-release

643
00:34:29,956 --> 00:34:33,897
of the Mega Man games. This is the complete works for the PlayStation 1. It was only ever in Japan.

644
00:34:34,577 --> 00:34:37,677
This is a cool feature that Capcom did back then, back in 99

645
00:34:37,737 --> 00:34:39,298
or whatever it is. It's called the Database.

646
00:34:40,218 --> 00:34:44,721
This collected every character in all the games, showed you their stats, what they were weak

647
00:34:44,761 --> 00:34:49,745
against and gave you a description which provided back story. Which is really cool because this

648
00:34:49,785 --> 00:34:54,228
back story to these characters was never reprinted anywhere else in any other language other

649
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:57,610
than Japanese. So we ported that over and we made that HD.

650
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:02,752
And we helped translate it into six, I think, languages.

651
00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:05,512
But we also added another feature while we were at it,

652
00:35:05,592 --> 00:35:06,953
which was, because we could,

653
00:35:06,973 --> 00:35:11,054
you could just go ahead and practice fighting one of the characters from the database,

654
00:35:11,074 --> 00:35:12,234
which I think is a really fun thing.

655
00:35:14,214 --> 00:35:16,295
Mega Man, of course, known for its soundtracks,

656
00:35:16,495 --> 00:35:20,316
so we wouldn't be doing our jobs if there wasn't a soundtrack player.

657
00:35:20,716 --> 00:35:25,057
My only regret is not calling it Sound Test, which was what they called it.

658
00:35:27,624 --> 00:35:29,105
And this is what we call the challenge mode.

659
00:35:29,145 --> 00:35:31,586
We wanted to give people a new way of playing the game.

660
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:34,607
So this is the section from Cut Man's level in Mega Man 1.

661
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:38,389
That portal right there, that's not in the original game.

662
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:39,109
We added that in.

663
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,591
When you enter one, you actually get thrown

664
00:35:41,631 --> 00:35:43,371
into a different section of a different stage.

665
00:35:43,431 --> 00:35:46,533
The idea here was it's a time attack speed run mode

666
00:35:47,013 --> 00:35:49,394
that makes you think about the games in a different way.

667
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:51,435
But more than that, I'm gonna switch

668
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:52,256
to a different challenge.

669
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,337
This is a challenge against the Mecha Dragon boss

670
00:35:54,357 --> 00:35:54,897
from Mega Man 2.

671
00:35:56,898 --> 00:36:03,319
So, it's a time attack, and at the end, after I win here, thank you very much, that was

672
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:07,620
me, 28 seconds, it's not terrible, you get a result, you get a badge, you get to save

673
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,902
your replay, but more than that, there's a leaderboard, so you can go and instantly watch

674
00:36:13,362 --> 00:36:18,403
how the fastest person in the world killed MechaDragon, which, I probably should have

675
00:36:18,423 --> 00:36:19,963
recorded the whole thing, but I cut it off, I'm sorry.

676
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:23,512
But more than that, getting back to the criterion thing,

677
00:36:24,212 --> 00:36:25,873
artistic intent was important to us.

678
00:36:25,913 --> 00:36:29,595
So we actually created modes that simulated the CRT

679
00:36:29,615 --> 00:36:31,576
televisions of the time.

680
00:36:31,896 --> 00:36:33,237
It looks better in 1080p.

681
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,778
The 720p squashing kind of messes with it.

682
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:36,758
But there was a TV mode.

683
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:38,359
This is sort of the best of both worlds.

684
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:39,560
We call it monitor mode.

685
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,861
that retains the scan line skipping in the aperture grill

686
00:36:42,881 --> 00:36:45,682
but none of the fake noise of the composite mode.

687
00:36:46,462 --> 00:36:49,463
The reason we did that stuff is because we feel that

688
00:36:50,323 --> 00:36:51,824
there's no way of really knowing

689
00:36:51,864 --> 00:36:54,304
what the artistic intent was of those sprites.

690
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:55,945
I think even if you rounded up

691
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,066
all the original Mega Man artists and asked them,

692
00:36:58,406 --> 00:37:00,926
they wouldn't be able to definitively answer like,

693
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:06,732
Oh, yeah, we assumed there would be some TV noise, so we drew the sprites that way.

694
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:12,958
So we tried to make all those options available, because I don't think there's any way of really

695
00:37:13,538 --> 00:37:16,841
nailing like this is what these games are supposed to be like, so we left that option

696
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:17,081
open.

697
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:21,806
That's really important to me, and if you guys are doing emulation packages yourself,

698
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:22,366
please do that.

699
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:26,789
So these features add a lot of value, but more importantly,

700
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:30,691
they did not add a significant cost to the development

701
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:31,031
budget.

702
00:37:31,571 --> 00:37:34,373
Our intent was to show that you can have the perceived value

703
00:37:34,493 --> 00:37:37,574
of an HD remake without having to invest in the extreme

704
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,555
expenditure that those require.

705
00:37:40,075 --> 00:37:42,136
Because all of our code was written in-house and our code

706
00:37:42,156 --> 00:37:44,717
base is cross-platform, we were able to put this entire

707
00:37:44,757 --> 00:37:47,959
package together with a core team of just about three

708
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,780
developers, give or take, in about eight months.

709
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,782
And we also ported it to the 3DS and that was its own product.

710
00:37:53,862 --> 00:37:55,984
But again, small team, very lean.

711
00:37:56,484 --> 00:37:57,645
We got it out and it works.

712
00:37:57,725 --> 00:38:03,209
And the result was that the fan outcry was so significant

713
00:38:03,249 --> 00:38:04,850
that they made a physical version

714
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:05,991
that they hadn't planned on.

715
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:07,332
People want this stuff.

716
00:38:08,393 --> 00:38:09,394
This works for Mega Man.

717
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:11,976
I don't think this works for Ninja Kid,

718
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,497
which was the example we gave earlier

719
00:38:14,538 --> 00:38:16,039
from the arcade archives.

720
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:22,596
You know, I would buy the heck out of a Ninja Zajamaru Legacy Collection.

721
00:38:22,736 --> 00:38:22,996
I would.

722
00:38:23,096 --> 00:38:26,780
You know, the games are really neat, but I think I'm a very small audience.

723
00:38:28,162 --> 00:38:31,946
So I don't think you can really justify this treatment for every game.

724
00:38:31,986 --> 00:38:34,589
I think it has to be a franchise that people already know and love.

725
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:35,990
But I don't...

726
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:37,852
I think there's another way.

727
00:38:39,909 --> 00:38:42,775
Here's how to keep every game in print on every platform without

728
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:45,902
spending a ton of money basically forever. We're going

729
00:38:45,922 --> 00:38:48,147
to circle back to Uncle Buck for a minute. Hi, Uncle Buck.

730
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:54,682
So how is it that Uncle Buck has remained in print across all

731
00:38:54,702 --> 00:38:55,723
these different platforms?

732
00:38:56,264 --> 00:38:59,486
Is Uncle Buck just worth more money than the NES version of

733
00:38:59,526 --> 00:38:59,967
DuckTales?

734
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:00,587
Maybe.

735
00:39:00,868 --> 00:39:01,828
Maybe it's got a better audience.

736
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,810
But I think it's a lot simpler than that.

737
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,653
Uncle Buck remained in print because video has format

738
00:39:06,693 --> 00:39:08,915
standards that are very inexpensive to quote, unquote

739
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:09,695
port to.

740
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:14,299
I think the biggest upfront expense in keeping a movie in

741
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:17,542
print is, sorry.

742
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:21,268
My computer is not happy right now.

743
00:39:22,088 --> 00:39:24,689
But I think the biggest expense in keeping a movie in

744
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:27,350
print is the upfront cost of digitally scanning it.

745
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,870
Every film has to be scanned, digitized, and cleaned up.

746
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,531
But it's not really that expensive.

747
00:39:32,551 --> 00:39:35,712
But the thing is, once you have a scan of a movie, you

748
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:38,272
have a master file that is very, very easily

749
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:39,872
portable to any format.

750
00:39:39,892 --> 00:39:42,933
You'd probably send a raw file to Amazon, and they just push

751
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:44,834
a button and encode it and push it live, and that's it.

752
00:39:46,254 --> 00:39:49,435
So you have this method of getting it really direct.

753
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:54,202
copy of the movie that's more or less pristine and you have ways

754
00:39:54,262 --> 00:39:57,528
of deploying it very easily. And you know it's real sad that we

755
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:00,893
can't do that for games, right? We have no notion of scanning a

756
00:40:00,953 --> 00:40:04,479
game. We have no notion of codex for games, right?

757
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,940
No, of course we do.

758
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,001
Video games are just binary files.

759
00:40:09,021 --> 00:40:13,442
You can make a perfect copy of a game easily.

760
00:40:14,102 --> 00:40:15,742
It's actually in a better state than film.

761
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:16,502
And guess what?

762
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:19,843
You often don't even have to do the work of digitizing those games

763
00:40:19,863 --> 00:40:21,123
because the pirates have done it for you.

764
00:40:21,163 --> 00:40:23,284
So just go on the Internet and take it if you want to.

765
00:40:23,304 --> 00:40:28,065
I posit that an emulator is just a video codec for playing video games,

766
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:29,845
and we've got to start thinking about it that way.

767
00:40:30,246 --> 00:40:34,146
Or, if you prefer, I think a video codec is nothing but a filmstrip emulator.

768
00:40:35,468 --> 00:40:44,517
And this is the mindset that I think this industry needs to be in, in order to push, you know, our back catalog back in print and make me happy.

769
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:49,282
So, you know, every time we release an old game, we sort of reinvent the wheel.

770
00:40:49,743 --> 00:40:55,489
And we port it or we build an emulator from scratch, and just all this wasted effort for no reason, with one exception.

771
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:01,675
All right. So here's an interesting selection of games.

772
00:41:01,695 --> 00:41:05,044
Does anyone know what the common thread here is between these

773
00:41:05,084 --> 00:41:05,465
games? Yes.

774
00:41:08,018 --> 00:41:09,599
They are not just all PC games.

775
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:15,504
They all run on MS-DOS, which was Microsoft's pre-Windows standard.

776
00:41:15,524 --> 00:41:18,086
These are games you can buy digitally right now.

777
00:41:18,126 --> 00:41:20,448
There's a large number of companies represented here.

778
00:41:20,488 --> 00:41:25,552
There's Apogee, Activision, Bethesda, Electronic Arts, LucasArts, which is Disney now.

779
00:41:25,812 --> 00:41:27,233
It's still weird to think that.

780
00:41:29,218 --> 00:41:34,181
But in addition to all being run, you know, native DOS games,

781
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:36,863
they have another thing in common. They're all using the

782
00:41:36,903 --> 00:41:40,285
same emulator. This is called DOSBox. Does anyone know DOSBox?

783
00:41:40,845 --> 00:41:44,467
Yeah, DOSBox is sort of the premier DOS emulator. It can

784
00:41:44,507 --> 00:41:47,289
run DOS games of a certain vintage at full speed on just

785
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:51,711
about any modern computer. It's a great piece of tech, but more

786
00:41:51,751 --> 00:41:55,533
importantly, it's open source. It's distributed under a GPL2

787
00:41:55,593 --> 00:41:56,814
license. What does that mean?

788
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:02,798
you may ask as my computer loads it. Well, GPL2 license means

789
00:42:02,818 --> 00:42:06,922
there you go, look at the green. Open for commercial use. It

790
00:42:06,962 --> 00:42:10,226
gets a little bit complicated, some moving parts of it, but

791
00:42:10,326 --> 00:42:14,651
essentially you can sell a DOS game with DOS box.

792
00:42:14,852 --> 00:42:18,114
And all you really have to do is include DOS box in the package.

793
00:42:18,515 --> 00:42:21,097
And that's what everybody does because it's easy and it's free.

794
00:42:21,177 --> 00:42:25,080
And you know, these games are now in print again because there

795
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,964
is an open solution for everyone to use. I looked at GOG.com and

796
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,986
my rough count is they're selling about 140 DOS games

797
00:42:32,046 --> 00:42:36,069
right now. And you know, a lot of the classic catalog that

798
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:39,612
people remember and want is represented already. And when

799
00:42:39,632 --> 00:42:41,354
it's not, you know, people figure it out.

800
00:42:42,595 --> 00:42:45,477
and they get it up there. They've done a great job of keeping these games in print.

801
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:50,241
Now, if only there was a DOS box for everything else, right?

802
00:42:51,683 --> 00:42:55,726
Some news happened a couple weeks ago. Some of you might have missed it. Some of you might have not.

803
00:42:56,787 --> 00:42:59,890
MAME just went open source on March 4th of this year.

804
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:06,636
MAME, as you may or may not know, is the standard for arcade board emulation. It emulates

805
00:43:07,096 --> 00:43:11,179
thousands of them. I mean, I don't even know what the count is anymore. And it's been around

806
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:16,363
since 97. And if you read the text, it is now being distributed under that exact same

807
00:43:16,383 --> 00:43:22,547
GPL-2 license. We are now in a situation where we can use MAME for commercial releases, and

808
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:27,531
that's not all. In May of last year, MAME absorbed its sister project, MESS.

809
00:43:28,532 --> 00:43:31,793
What MAME was for arcade games, MESS was for everything else.

810
00:43:34,174 --> 00:43:36,515
This is a list that's going to load any second here, I promise,

811
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:40,217
of drivers that are in MESS right now.

812
00:43:40,457 --> 00:43:43,658
MESS is basically like every console and computer ever.

813
00:43:43,678 --> 00:43:44,539
Look, there's 2,176 of them.

814
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:45,159
Like, between MAME and MESS.

815
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,772
Basically everything is covered in some form.

816
00:43:50,812 --> 00:43:54,074
Now, I'm not saying MAME and MESS are perfect.

817
00:43:54,394 --> 00:43:55,835
There's a lot of inconsistencies.

818
00:43:55,855 --> 00:43:59,597
The emulation usually isn't the top notch for consoles

819
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:02,319
in their MESS slash MAME equivalent,

820
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:03,880
but it's open source.

821
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,501
It's code base is out there, it can be contributed to.

822
00:44:09,295 --> 00:44:13,337
you know, just about any game can be run through MAME.

823
00:44:13,457 --> 00:44:16,740
And, you know, if you think about this,

824
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,942
it's basically a video codec for video games.

825
00:44:19,962 --> 00:44:21,463
We're already kind of there.

826
00:44:23,364 --> 00:44:25,185
We've already begun the process internally

827
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,646
of porting MAME to our own tech.

828
00:44:27,006 --> 00:44:29,068
I don't know if, you know, we have no commercial products

829
00:44:29,088 --> 00:44:30,208
that we're using it in right now,

830
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:31,810
but I wouldn't be surprised if that happens.

831
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:35,450
And I would be shocked and frankly a bit offended if we're

832
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:39,571
the only ones that are smart enough to do this. But, you

833
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:43,812
know, we're just, we're a studio. I can imagine someone

834
00:44:44,252 --> 00:44:48,313
like an Amazon forking MAME, bringing it in-house, bringing

835
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:51,494
it up to snuff and bringing games back to the level of,

836
00:44:51,994 --> 00:44:56,755
well, Uncle Buck. Where, you know, I can envision a future

837
00:44:56,795 --> 00:45:00,476
where we respect DuckTales for the NES as much as we respect

838
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:01,997
this John Candy classic.

839
00:45:02,897 --> 00:45:07,419
I want to thank you all very much for coming to my talk. It's about all I've got. A couple

840
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:15,962
reminders. You will get an e-mail to evaluate me as a speaker. Please rate me as you see

841
00:45:15,982 --> 00:45:20,884
appropriate. Please, these are your takeaways. There is an audience for old games. How to

842
00:45:20,904 --> 00:45:27,486
print games are lost revenue. Emulation is cheap and accurate. Embrace the emulator. And I

843
00:45:27,706 --> 00:45:29,487
will now open it up for questions.

844
00:45:40,312 --> 00:45:41,533
If we've got no questions, are we done here?

845
00:45:42,194 --> 00:45:44,716
Oh, I think the microphone in the middle is where you want to go.

846
00:45:45,517 --> 00:45:48,539
Yes, John Paul Dyson of the Strong Museum of Play in Rochester, New York.

847
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,140
How can I help you?

848
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,022
Thanks.

849
00:45:51,242 --> 00:45:55,085
So what do you think about commercial versus, say, what the Internet Archive is doing with jazz music?

850
00:45:55,165 --> 00:45:56,947
Oh, yeah, yeah. This is a great point.

851
00:45:57,027 --> 00:45:58,348
So a lot of these games are...

852
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:04,636
absolutely easily playable in your browser right now. They are kept in print unofficially,

853
00:46:04,756 --> 00:46:12,086
but the point I'm trying to make is that commercial emulation has its value, too. I think that

854
00:46:12,587 --> 00:46:14,049
especially for products like we make.

855
00:46:14,429 --> 00:46:17,231
where the idea is to gather the ephemera and the materials

856
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:18,632
and really make a collector's edition

857
00:46:18,672 --> 00:46:20,633
and really preserve the game properly

858
00:46:20,673 --> 00:46:23,715
beyond a playable binary, I think you need money.

859
00:46:23,935 --> 00:46:25,776
I think money needs to be invested in that.

860
00:46:25,977 --> 00:46:29,559
And I think that commercial emulation can coexist

861
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:31,540
with the quote-unquote unofficial emulation.

862
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,421
But thank you for bringing that up.

863
00:46:34,102 --> 00:46:35,523
Again, the pirates have it covered.

864
00:46:35,903 --> 00:46:36,944
I was a pirate myself.

865
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:37,904
I kind of still am.

866
00:46:40,086 --> 00:46:42,648
I don't mean to imply that commercial emulation can somehow

867
00:46:42,688 --> 00:46:43,548
be better than amateur.

868
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:44,589
I don't think that will ever happen.

869
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:45,069
Yes, Kyle.

870
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:45,730
Hey, Frank.

871
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:46,190
Hi.

872
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:50,053
The legal cases you cited are from 15 or 16 years ago, I think?

873
00:46:50,113 --> 00:46:50,193
Yeah.

874
00:46:50,733 --> 00:46:54,556
If they did it again for, like, the NES emulators inside MESS.

875
00:46:55,697 --> 00:46:57,699
Do you think Nintendo's going to have a problem with it?

876
00:46:57,759 --> 00:46:59,481
Maybe they'd be able to prevail this time

877
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:00,182
if they took it to court?

878
00:47:00,462 --> 00:47:03,145
No, I don't think there's anything that you can show for,

879
00:47:03,206 --> 00:47:05,148
I mean, using the NES as an example,

880
00:47:05,168 --> 00:47:07,510
I don't think there's anything in there that you can show

881
00:47:07,751 --> 00:47:11,075
that violates any of Nintendo's patents or trademarks.

882
00:47:11,835 --> 00:47:15,357
And in fact, something about that case is that that case was

883
00:47:15,477 --> 00:47:19,399
able to prove the legality of reverse engineering a BIOS chip

884
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,519
for the sake of emulation.

885
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:22,080
That was established in that case.

886
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:22,841
That's on paper.

887
00:47:23,201 --> 00:47:25,042
I don't see a problem in any way.

888
00:47:25,382 --> 00:47:29,784
The only problem I can see is if an emulator distributes the

889
00:47:30,024 --> 00:47:34,566
unaltered BIOS from a console, because that is code that they

890
00:47:34,586 --> 00:47:35,367
don't have the rights to.

891
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:41,961
emulating a platform and not using any code that is proprietary, I don't see how that can be

892
00:47:41,981 --> 00:47:44,086
challenged legally. I think it would have been done by now.

893
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:49,910
I was one of the original developers of MAME, so I really appreciate this talk.

894
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,291
I really appreciate the work you're doing.

895
00:47:51,571 --> 00:47:52,871
I appreciate the work you're doing.

896
00:47:52,951 --> 00:47:56,373
I assure you that all the developers of MAME, they were the first to run on buy

897
00:47:56,413 --> 00:47:57,993
in any kind of officially licensed collection.

898
00:47:58,013 --> 00:48:00,374
So we started things like StarROMs, you know, came and went.

899
00:48:00,754 --> 00:48:01,335
Yeah.

900
00:48:01,675 --> 00:48:04,456
But I was curious, you mentioned that the Capcom collection for MegaMan

901
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:06,877
wasn't actually an emulator, but it was very faithful.

902
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,557
What, yeah, you're still like, well, how did you do it?

903
00:48:08,617 --> 00:48:09,498
Oh, how did we do it? Okay.

904
00:48:09,658 --> 00:48:12,259
So like I said, we sort of found a work around

905
00:48:12,379 --> 00:48:13,980
that wasn't technically emulation,

906
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,441
but had the exact same result.

907
00:48:15,981 --> 00:48:17,782
And basically what we did was,

908
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:20,784
internally we were emulating the game,

909
00:48:20,804 --> 00:48:23,306
but we statically recompiled it into C,

910
00:48:24,086 --> 00:48:27,128
so that we weren't shipping any emulation code.

911
00:48:27,528 --> 00:48:29,429
We were just doing the exact same things

912
00:48:29,509 --> 00:48:31,450
an emulator would without actually emulating it,

913
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:33,271
and everyone seemed satisfied by that.

914
00:48:34,072 --> 00:48:37,614
So that's what we did. It's silly. It's really silly. But I

915
00:48:37,654 --> 00:48:40,976
will say that that did give us some unexpected advantages when

916
00:48:41,016 --> 00:48:42,057
we were making that challenge.

917
00:48:42,077 --> 00:48:43,337
It allows you to make modifications.

918
00:48:43,397 --> 00:48:45,899
Yeah. So like, you know, it became a little bit easier to

919
00:48:45,939 --> 00:48:48,801
modify the game and we could do things like draw a portal in

920
00:48:48,841 --> 00:48:51,983
game space and have it scroll because we know exactly where to

921
00:48:52,023 --> 00:48:53,724
interrupt in the code because we can look at it.

922
00:48:55,645 --> 00:48:55,845
Thanks.

923
00:48:57,223 --> 00:48:57,504
Hello.

924
00:48:57,784 --> 00:48:57,864
Hi.

925
00:48:57,904 --> 00:49:00,565
So in the spirit of preserving history,

926
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:02,205
do you think that it's still true

927
00:49:02,265 --> 00:49:04,526
that the most at-risk pieces of history

928
00:49:04,806 --> 00:49:07,287
are the ones that never made it to shelves,

929
00:49:07,307 --> 00:49:08,187
like you mentioned earlier?

930
00:49:08,207 --> 00:49:11,068
Or are there new targets in 2016 where you're thinking, wow,

931
00:49:11,128 --> 00:49:12,569
we're at risk of losing this stuff?

932
00:49:13,089 --> 00:49:14,469
You trying to get me to talk about PT?

933
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:17,130
I don't know anything about it.

934
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:17,750
I'm just curious.

935
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:20,089
Can everyone hear the questions in the mics, by the way?

936
00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:21,049
I'm supposed to repeat them.

937
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:28,632
So that example I made, I was thinking specifically

938
00:49:28,952 --> 00:49:31,613
of the NES, or maybe a little more broadly,

939
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:34,754
of console video games, of that vintage.

940
00:49:35,394 --> 00:49:38,496
I still believe, absolutely, those are the ones most in

941
00:49:38,516 --> 00:49:39,276
danger of disappearing.

942
00:49:39,616 --> 00:49:42,418
But in terms of the broader scope of game preservation,

943
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:43,738
what do I think is in the most danger?

944
00:49:44,238 --> 00:49:48,781
I don't think we've really solved the philosophical debate

945
00:49:48,841 --> 00:49:51,022
of how do you preserve an online experience.

946
00:49:52,062 --> 00:49:54,563
And that is something way beyond my scope.

947
00:49:54,603 --> 00:49:58,065
I would refer you to Henry Lowood at Stanford for their

948
00:49:58,145 --> 00:49:58,845
efforts on that.

949
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:03,571
Another example I like to give is, it's not just MMOs when I

950
00:50:03,611 --> 00:50:06,172
say that, it's like Farmville, right?

951
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:09,992
Like, even if you hate Farmville, is Farmville preserved?

952
00:50:10,792 --> 00:50:14,593
Can we play the first version of Farmville anymore?

953
00:50:14,693 --> 00:50:17,054
Or does Zynga even have that, right?

954
00:50:18,214 --> 00:50:21,435
So, you know, I think there's bigger problems to solve.

955
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:24,635
And I think those debates become more philosophical

956
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:26,175
than technical, because at that point,

957
00:50:26,195 --> 00:50:27,036
you're just kind of questioning,

958
00:50:27,056 --> 00:50:28,196
what does it mean to save a game?

959
00:50:28,956 --> 00:50:31,377
So for online stuff, maybe it's just a whole lot of video

960
00:50:31,397 --> 00:50:35,320
footage. Maybe we start. JP over there had a great quote in an

961
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:40,222
interview once where he thought of it more like preserving

962
00:50:40,302 --> 00:50:43,604
baseball history where it's not, you know, you don't preserve

963
00:50:43,684 --> 00:50:46,205
like all the players in the stadium and everything, but you

964
00:50:46,245 --> 00:50:49,567
preserve everything that happened. And I think for

965
00:50:49,707 --> 00:50:51,828
impermanent games, I think we should think about it more than

966
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:52,168
that way.

967
00:50:53,109 --> 00:50:53,609
Cool. Thanks.

968
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:54,570
Yeah. Thank you.

969
00:50:55,409 --> 00:51:01,253
Hi, Frank. Given the challenges you faced with static

970
00:51:01,293 --> 00:51:05,097
recompilation versus actual emulation and the skittishness

971
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:09,761
of the companies that you were talking to prior, how would I as

972
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:11,842
somebody who wants to get in on something like this using

973
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:17,327
emulation convince, say, a Capcom or a Konami or a Square

974
00:51:17,387 --> 00:51:21,470
Enix to do something like this via emulation?

975
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:26,642
This talk will be on GDC Vault in 30 days.

976
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:27,628
We can start there.

977
00:51:29,817 --> 00:51:32,958
But, I mean, you're asking me to solve for you the problem

978
00:51:32,998 --> 00:51:34,479
that I myself have not solved yet.

979
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:37,061
So I really don't know how to answer that for you,

980
00:51:37,121 --> 00:51:37,781
unfortunately.

981
00:51:38,101 --> 00:51:42,023
But I think bringing this discussion public, and then

982
00:51:42,223 --> 00:51:44,585
shaking people and saying, look, emulation is good.

983
00:51:44,745 --> 00:51:45,865
Emulation is good for you.

984
00:51:45,925 --> 00:51:47,546
It's not piracy.

985
00:51:47,606 --> 00:51:48,607
It's a tool.

986
00:51:48,767 --> 00:51:49,808
It's the best tool.

987
00:51:50,928 --> 00:51:53,750
I think really making that stuff public and bringing

988
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:56,391
that to light, I think, is the first step toward that.

989
00:51:57,592 --> 00:51:57,712
And.

990
00:51:58,352 --> 00:52:02,194
you know, hopefully my company will help further that. So

991
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:05,075
that's what I would say to you. And on a slightly different

992
00:52:05,095 --> 00:52:08,236
note, Super Star Wars is now available on PlayStation 4. It

993
00:52:08,296 --> 00:52:12,057
is, it's true. That was done by Code Mystics, in fact, and I

994
00:52:12,077 --> 00:52:14,138
have not played it, but I understand that it's a really

995
00:52:14,158 --> 00:52:19,559
good emulation of it. So I believe, yes, that we have, we

996
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,280
now have Super Nintendo emulation on another platform,

997
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,041
which is real good news for everybody. Thank you.

998
00:52:26,817 --> 00:52:30,282
Heather, regarding the context of what you put in a preservation, sort of a pack like

999
00:52:30,322 --> 00:52:34,569
Mega Man Legacy Collection, what pieces of information did you wish you were able to

1000
00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:38,655
get or like what questions did you have that you wanted in the collection and what would

1001
00:52:38,695 --> 00:52:41,459
you want answered in future collections that you might not be able to get?

1002
00:52:42,467 --> 00:52:44,828
So our goal was to contextualize the games,

1003
00:52:45,088 --> 00:52:47,889
because I feel that that's important to preserving them

1004
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:49,870
in the way that I think of preservation.

1005
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:52,071
And what I think was missing from Mega Man

1006
00:52:52,111 --> 00:52:53,232
was developer insight.

1007
00:52:53,872 --> 00:52:56,053
And there were several challenges

1008
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:59,475
in getting developer insight for these particular games

1009
00:52:59,535 --> 00:53:01,056
that I really can't get into.

1010
00:53:01,116 --> 00:53:03,397
But I do feel that that piece was missing.

1011
00:53:03,697 --> 00:53:08,559
So we had this concept, again, of what would a Blu-ray

1012
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:11,020
collector's box set of Mega Man be like?

1013
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,101
And I think all of those games would have

1014
00:53:13,121 --> 00:53:14,082
director's commentary.

1015
00:53:14,522 --> 00:53:16,643
And unfortunately, we were not able to put that in.

1016
00:53:16,683 --> 00:53:18,584
But in the future, yes, absolutely.

1017
00:53:18,764 --> 00:53:21,065
I think that's an important piece to put in there.

1018
00:53:22,305 --> 00:53:27,187
That said, I also think that it's more than just the making

1019
00:53:27,227 --> 00:53:27,567
of the game.

1020
00:53:27,607 --> 00:53:30,008
I think it's also the selling of the game that's a

1021
00:53:30,028 --> 00:53:31,209
compelling part of the story.

1022
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:37,193
I would love to do many documentaries that maybe dig up

1023
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:41,076
old news footage and stuff like that or photos of people

1024
00:53:41,136 --> 00:53:43,738
playing the games back in the day. I think there's a lot more

1025
00:53:43,778 --> 00:53:46,821
ephemera that we don't really think about when we think about

1026
00:53:47,121 --> 00:53:48,743
containing a game in a package.

1027
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,300
I should say also other development materials other than

1028
00:53:53,401 --> 00:53:55,561
art, too, like design documents, things like that.

1029
00:53:55,581 --> 00:53:56,822
Like anything that's still around.

1030
00:53:57,262 --> 00:54:01,724
You know, I often think about when I talk about preserving

1031
00:54:01,744 --> 00:54:03,945
these other ephemeral pieces of video game history,

1032
00:54:03,985 --> 00:54:08,427
I always think about the Blu-rays I have for classic movies

1033
00:54:08,467 --> 00:54:10,868
like Casablanca and Citizen Kane where you listen to the,

1034
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:12,588
that's not director's commentary,

1035
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:14,189
the historian commentary, right?

1036
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:17,570
And they're like citing studio notes.

1037
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:20,091
that went back and forth that still exist

1038
00:54:20,191 --> 00:54:22,092
that are in an archive that they can access.

1039
00:54:22,152 --> 00:54:24,433
And I don't think we have an equivalent of that

1040
00:54:24,493 --> 00:54:26,614
in the video game industry, other than,

1041
00:54:27,074 --> 00:54:28,194
you know, we're starting to.

1042
00:54:28,214 --> 00:54:31,015
I'm gonna mention J.P. Dyson over there

1043
00:54:31,035 --> 00:54:31,976
at the Strong Museum again.

1044
00:54:32,756 --> 00:54:35,037
You know, there are certain organizations like his

1045
00:54:35,097 --> 00:54:37,618
that are starting to collect the paperwork

1046
00:54:37,658 --> 00:54:39,879
and the ephemera around games to make sure

1047
00:54:39,899 --> 00:54:41,639
that stuff is accessible to researchers.

1048
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:43,380
So, you know, I think that's an important part

1049
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,241
that I would love to start including in future collections.

1050
00:54:49,491 --> 00:54:53,134
First of all, this was a very good talk. Thank you for doing

1051
00:54:53,174 --> 00:55:00,199
it. Secondly, my question is concerning price point. So

1052
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:06,844
recently my little company was part of an effort to release

1053
00:55:06,945 --> 00:55:10,487
what most would consider an older game on Steam. And this

1054
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:13,850
was a PC game and whatnot. And it was priced at around $30.

1055
00:55:15,631 --> 00:55:21,714
And there was a decently significant amount of pushback

1056
00:55:21,994 --> 00:55:22,635
against this.

1057
00:55:22,655 --> 00:55:24,555
Against the price point.

1058
00:55:24,576 --> 00:55:26,136
Against the price point, yes.

1059
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:31,199
And so I'm wondering, what do you

1060
00:55:31,299 --> 00:55:35,521
think would be a good price point for like anything?

1061
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:36,421
I'm not answering that.

1062
00:55:40,164 --> 00:55:43,787
Or maybe, did you get any pushback on the price point for

1063
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:44,888
the legacy collection?

1064
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:46,449
Well, we didn't set that.

1065
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:50,653
So this is entirely a work for hire situation.

1066
00:55:50,733 --> 00:55:53,295
So we pitched the project to Capcom.

1067
00:55:53,315 --> 00:55:54,436
We got them on board with it.

1068
00:55:54,496 --> 00:55:55,657
But ultimately, it's their product.

1069
00:55:55,697 --> 00:55:56,638
We just made it for them.

1070
00:55:56,698 --> 00:55:58,860
So all that price point stuff was way out of my hands.

1071
00:56:00,081 --> 00:56:00,861
I think it should have been more.

1072
00:56:01,422 --> 00:56:03,243
frankly, like if you want my personal opinion.

1073
00:56:03,923 --> 00:56:06,384
But that is because of the presentation of it,

1074
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,566
and I think giving it that higher price point

1075
00:56:08,606 --> 00:56:10,327
gives it that more of a boutique feel.

1076
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:17,551
But that said, I suspect that $30 is a high price point

1077
00:56:17,591 --> 00:56:19,492
for an individual older game,

1078
00:56:20,612 --> 00:56:23,594
which is why I'm suggesting these two alternatives, right?

1079
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:26,756
Which is either actually make a big deal out of it, right?

1080
00:56:26,796 --> 00:56:28,937
Like make a really boutique collectors thing.

1081
00:56:29,798 --> 00:56:32,920
or get us to the point where getting these games running

1082
00:56:33,001 --> 00:56:36,984
is just such a cheap thing that we can do the Spotify

1083
00:56:37,084 --> 00:56:39,246
of video games or something, right?

1084
00:56:39,486 --> 00:56:42,569
Like I think both of those are effective solutions.

1085
00:56:42,609 --> 00:56:45,311
And man, I meant to talk about Napster in this talk

1086
00:56:45,331 --> 00:56:45,872
and I forgot.

1087
00:56:47,273 --> 00:56:49,576
And one little comment about piracy.

1088
00:56:49,836 --> 00:56:55,582
Yeah, so my first project was a quote-unquote dojin title

1089
00:56:55,982 --> 00:57:00,707
that a lot of us were afraid wouldn't even sell 10,000 copies

1090
00:57:01,048 --> 00:57:04,091
because, hey, you know, it's Japanese independent games.

1091
00:57:04,351 --> 00:57:05,292
They get pirated.

1092
00:57:05,412 --> 00:57:06,493
Uh, to hell and back.

1093
00:57:07,685 --> 00:57:15,673
Five years and 450,000 copies later, I've gotten hundreds of

1094
00:57:15,853 --> 00:57:20,597
e-mails about people who pirated the game, pirated our release

1095
00:57:20,617 --> 00:57:24,681
of the game, were impressed by it, and then bought the game

1096
00:57:24,701 --> 00:57:25,342
because they liked it.

1097
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:25,562
Absolutely.

1098
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:26,183
Absolutely.

1099
00:57:26,203 --> 00:57:26,423
Yes.

1100
00:57:26,523 --> 00:57:27,184
And I'm sorry to interrupt.

1101
00:57:27,204 --> 00:57:28,005
Pirates will be customers.

1102
00:57:28,025 --> 00:57:28,365
Yeah, absolutely.

1103
00:57:28,605 --> 00:57:29,146
Thank you.

1104
00:57:29,226 --> 00:57:29,446
Thank you.

1105
00:57:29,466 --> 00:57:29,686
Thank you.

1106
00:57:29,706 --> 00:57:30,007
Thank you.

1107
00:57:30,027 --> 00:57:30,247
Thank you.

1108
00:57:30,267 --> 00:57:30,487
Thank you.

1109
00:57:30,567 --> 00:57:36,530
Thank you for pointing that out. And in addition to that, I think this industry has all but

1110
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:43,074
ignored the concept of a secondary market for its games. I think we just release a game

1111
00:57:43,234 --> 00:57:46,636
and those are the sales we get and then we walk away with our tails between our legs.

1112
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:51,978
Whereas every other industry repackages its content because it's easy to do so.

1113
00:57:51,998 --> 00:57:52,318
So, yeah.

1114
00:57:52,338 --> 00:57:53,419
Okay. Thank you.

1115
00:57:53,879 --> 00:57:54,119
Thank you.

1116
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:54,480
Thank you.

1117
00:57:56,026 --> 00:58:01,956
a lot of good questions. I guess I just wanted to ask a point of

1118
00:58:01,976 --> 00:58:05,461
clarification. So it was really interesting to see you mention

1119
00:58:05,501 --> 00:58:08,005
that INEZ header on super mario.

1120
00:58:12,426 --> 00:58:16,328
I think I heard you talking about it on Twitter a while ago.

1121
00:58:16,348 --> 00:58:17,328
When did you first find that?

1122
00:58:18,109 --> 00:58:20,250
Oh, I did not discover that myself.

1123
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:24,092
That was discovered on, god, which forum?

1124
00:58:24,112 --> 00:58:28,554
I think it was the Nest dev forums is where that was first discovered.

1125
00:58:28,634 --> 00:58:31,575
But I did validate it myself as of last night.

1126
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,646
Which Super Mario that's available from Nintendo?

1127
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:37,888
Wii Virtual Console is the one I looked at.

1128
00:58:37,988 --> 00:58:39,329
Wii Virtual Console, interesting.

1129
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:41,792
A lot of other questions that were already asked.

1130
00:58:42,673 --> 00:58:45,215
And to be fair, there's no guarantee

1131
00:58:45,275 --> 00:58:46,777
that they downloaded the ROM, but I

1132
00:58:47,437 --> 00:58:49,199
don't see any alternative for there

1133
00:58:49,219 --> 00:58:50,841
being an INS header in a Nintendo product.

1134
00:58:53,912 --> 00:58:57,134
I'm sad this has to be the last question, I guess.

1135
00:58:57,294 --> 00:58:57,975
There might be one more.

1136
00:58:58,155 --> 00:58:58,755
Okay, cool, cool.

1137
00:58:58,775 --> 00:58:59,956
If you hurry up, come on, come on, come on.

1138
00:58:59,976 --> 00:59:03,559
Okay, so basically my question is, so obviously you're doing a lot of technical workarounds

1139
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:08,502
to get past the issues regarding certain copyrights with regards to BIOS and such.

1140
00:59:09,763 --> 00:59:15,728
At what point do you think it becomes necessary for game developers and sort of the entertainment

1141
00:59:15,808 --> 00:59:16,268
software?

1142
00:59:17,189 --> 00:59:22,495
like consumers to get together to try to lobby for changes with regards to copyright law

1143
00:59:22,615 --> 00:59:23,877
a la Lawrence Lessig.

1144
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:27,001
I don't think we're strong enough to do that.

1145
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:34,724
I really don't. I don't think that the video game industry as a, you know, I don't think games are

1146
00:59:34,764 --> 00:59:39,688
old enough that we're going to be able to do that for quite a while. And, you know, but I would

1147
00:59:39,748 --> 00:59:46,713
also agree with Jason Scott, who was like last year's video game history talk guy, that who cares.

1148
00:59:48,127 --> 00:59:51,649
Like, that stuff's on the internet archive, it's not in your hands, just go play it.

1149
00:59:53,010 --> 01:00:01,216
But I don't think, like, I think the commercial sales of older games, you know, has appeal

1150
01:00:01,396 --> 01:00:04,678
and I think it's a positive and we should do as much of it as we can, but I don't

1151
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:08,020
think that, and this is just a personal opinion, not the

1152
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,562
opinion of my employer, blah, blah, blah. I don't think that

1153
01:00:10,742 --> 01:00:13,283
that is the only way to save a game. I think the games are more

1154
01:00:13,323 --> 01:00:16,465
or less saved. My concern with commercializing them is that I

1155
01:00:16,505 --> 01:00:18,646
want them to stay alive in the public consciousness.

1156
01:00:19,566 --> 01:00:23,288
Thank you. Probably last question. No more? No more. No

1157
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:27,611
more questions. But I will be, where's the room, the, like,

1158
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:29,171
after room that we can talk in?

1159
01:00:30,579 --> 01:00:33,842
It's like down the hall that way or something. There's a room

1160
01:00:33,862 --> 01:00:36,565
they set aside. I'm going to walk toward it right now. If you

1161
01:00:36,585 --> 01:00:38,487
guys have any further questions, I'm happy to talk to you or if

1162
01:00:38,507 --> 01:00:40,929
you just want to say hi. I had to talk then, too. Thank you

1163
01:00:41,029 --> 01:00:44,773
very much for not going to the Ms. Pac-Man talk and instead

1164
01:00:44,813 --> 01:00:46,695
coming here. I really appreciate that.
