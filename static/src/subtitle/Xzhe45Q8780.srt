1
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:07,949
Okay, hi, my name's Scott Benson.

2
00:00:07,949 --> 00:00:11,372
Thanks for coming out.

3
00:00:11,372 --> 00:00:13,374
I worked on this game, Night in the Woods.

4
00:00:13,374 --> 00:00:18,798
I was the co-creator, co-writer, artist, animator,

5
00:00:18,798 --> 00:00:19,579
just some other stuff.

6
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:21,460
It's an indie game.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,002
Everyone does everything at some point.

8
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:31,078
Thanks everyone for coming. I thought maybe 5 people were going to come out to this and there's at least 6 or 7, which is fantastic.

9
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:34,680
This is good. Audience interaction is great because there's going to be some jokes.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:45,647
So, there's some people from the Night in the Woods team here. You're kind of just getting my take on it, but anyone who worked on Night in the Woods, can you raise your hands?

11
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:46,087
Okay. Thank you.

12
00:00:54,777 --> 00:00:58,639
Well now that that's over with of the 9 that was the first game I ever worked on

13
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:02,840
is my first time getting giving a talk at GDC you may be shocked to find out

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,220
and

15
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,922
so I should say a friend of this talk would be different if someone else is

16
00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:11,343
giving the talk like with Alec you probably get more like a bit but the

17
00:01:11,343 --> 00:01:15,625
technical design aspect of it and kind of he's you know the coder and the

18
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,206
composer on it the co-creator of it.

19
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:21,187
And so you kind of get his take on it with with Bethany.

20
00:01:22,095 --> 00:01:26,457
She's a co-writer on it you'd get take more of the history

21
00:01:26,457 --> 00:01:29,778
and kind of where she's from and her experiences that make up a lot of kind

22
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:34,080
of the bedrock of a lot of what ended up in the game with and Becca are

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,661
publishers that Finji right there you'd hear a lot of horror stories about

24
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:41,883
trying to adjust deadlines and kind of trying to herd the cats across the

25
00:01:41,883 --> 00:01:43,003
cat field or whatever.

26
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:47,265
Let's hear John Manning is here you hear about like yarn spinner and some

27
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:50,786
of like the cool solutions with a yarn the dialect system that we ended up

28
00:01:50,786 --> 00:01:51,026
using.

29
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:55,544
and creating I guess there at this and M who's there too you hear about like

30
00:01:55,544 --> 00:01:59,786
her fantastic work on like the sound design, but you are unfortunately stuck

31
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:04,208
with me for the next 45 minutes or so I'm going to give a warning for anyone

32
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,250
who's watching this talk latest party be a little cursing because I'm going to

33
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,311
get excited and it's going to happen and I think there's one slide that has a

34
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:11,732
swear word in it and I'm

35
00:02:16,373 --> 00:02:18,815
So I guess the night was the first game ever worked on I'm not a developer

36
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:22,117
with like years and years of like strains of successes. I was like some

37
00:02:22,117 --> 00:02:26,119
like dumb punk kid artist to like years later, but like got stumbled into

38
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:29,701
making a video game and it just kind of went well so that's why you have to

39
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:35,304
hear from me also we have a lot to get through and I don't know if I can fit

40
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:37,746
this into the time so let's get going.

41
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:41,028
The way I skip slides already high that was supposed to go before.

42
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:44,590
And this is the name of the title of the thing.

43
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:49,273
of the talk. All right, part one. So, travel back with me, if you will, to twitter.com.

44
00:02:49,273 --> 00:02:53,015
June 3rd, 2013. Alec Holoka, who co-created this game Aquaria, actually won awards at

45
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:53,996
the IGF here. 25 years ago? How long ago was it, Alec?

46
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,440
25 years ago, back when the IGF was all ColecoVision,

47
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,502
and they made this amazing game.

48
00:03:16,502 --> 00:03:19,885
And so he contacted me and said, hey, you're funny on Twitter.

49
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:31,633
and I like some of your animation work would you like to make a video game and

50
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:36,175
I was an independent animator just doing like in the animation like contract

51
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:39,577
work illustration kind of trying to get by was self-taught didn't go to college

52
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:44,599
just this is like the long end of a long line of like that's just trying to get

53
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:50,222
by and I ended up kind of accidentally falling into doing animation and stuff

54
00:03:50,222 --> 00:03:52,643
up right before the site help co-found

55
00:03:52,643 --> 00:03:53,204
an international.

56
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,600
independent animation collective late night work club. I'm Jake Armstrong

57
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,582
did that logo my logo for just way worse. So I put that one up

58
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:04,763
there. You know late night work of dot com and check out our

59
00:04:04,763 --> 00:04:08,864
stuff. It's all free and it's all good. But so when Alec asked

60
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:11,485
if I want to make a video game. I was like I guess like

61
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:14,687
the year before so I played a game called a super brother

62
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,728
sword and sorcery which is a brilliant amazing game.

63
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,621
and uh...

64
00:04:19,621 --> 00:04:22,925
before then video games are kind of like you know i i i know for example like

65
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:27,109
people make rockets and go to like the moon and stuff but i have no idea how to

66
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:28,371
do that

67
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:31,795
and video games are kind of like that like i wanted to since i was a kid i was

68
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:32,896
interested in

69
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:36,400
game design and just you know like i i liked games a lot kind of just as an art

70
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,682
form and uh...

71
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:39,243
and also just for like fun

72
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,873
and but I never had any idea what to do with them or what I could do with them

73
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:44,394
at all and

74
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:51,441
but the sword sorcery which I loved it kind of pitched itself in its credits as

75
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:58,528
like a collaboration between a dev team and an artist and a musician and I was

76
00:04:58,528 --> 00:05:03,313
like oh wait I can do one of those. I was like a mixed media collaboration or

77
00:05:03,313 --> 00:05:03,893
something like.

78
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:07,956
in like my past it would be like oh someone does like a little comic zine and then like a band

79
00:05:07,956 --> 00:05:10,838
record like a seven inch or something with it and you put them together it's this mixed media

80
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:17,082
collaboration project and I was like ah I get that and sword and sorcery um at least for me

81
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:20,904
gave me permission not in the sense it's like not in the like authority figure sense where someone

82
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:25,787
says okay now you can do this but in the sense of like when someone says demonstrates to you

83
00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:31,051
or out and that says hey you can do this you know there's something that you have to offer.

84
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:33,492
or another part of your life, it's like you can be this,

85
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:34,993
you can think this, you can feel this way.

86
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:36,433
Sometimes you just need someone to go,

87
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:40,595
oh, yeah, you can do that, that's valid.

88
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:44,977
So Alex sent me an email, this is an actual email,

89
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,539
and our ambitions at the front were really funny.

90
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,980
I'm gonna do a dramatic reading of this real quick.

91
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,540
Alakaloka.

92
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:57,689
I don't have a plan or anything, but I think it'd be cool to make an atmospheric exploration,

93
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:00,251
chilled out, moody type thing for iPad.

94
00:06:00,251 --> 00:06:02,472
Maybe non-linear, but some story elements.

95
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:04,993
Love your art style animation in the Vine you just posted.

96
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:05,413
Here's me.

97
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:06,534
Pssh.

98
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,215
No plan?

99
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:09,396
Yeah, I'd love to.

100
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:14,158
I know next to nothing about how to create for this medium, but I would love to do something.

101
00:06:14,158 --> 00:06:15,599
Been trying to edge in that direction.

102
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:17,922
and would love the experience.

103
00:06:17,922 --> 00:06:19,424
And making cool stuff is cool.

104
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:20,366
Thanks, Scott.

105
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:21,067
Also, thanks.

106
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:22,649
The clip is part of a blah, blah, blah.

107
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,370
Alakaloka.

108
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,032
We should start up a Google Doc and brainstorm.

109
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:26,154
See what comes to mind.

110
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:31,304
And I said sounds good and that was basically how that started so we worked

111
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:34,426
for a while like a few months in that summer kind of coming up with like

112
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:38,029
this thing it was like this atmosphere kind of mystical like silent

113
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:41,171
protagonist. She had like a little Cape that fluttered when you when you

114
00:06:41,171 --> 00:06:45,394
jumped there's is pretty going to be some just like kind of like very nice

115
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:49,637
mystical stuff some storybook elements for going to be some like humming

116
00:06:49,637 --> 00:06:52,499
ancient obelisks all the stuff this is just what you did in indie games in

117
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:52,659
2013. So we

118
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:57,623
So we were doing that, but we kind of weren't feeling it.

119
00:06:57,623 --> 00:07:00,825
It was cool, but it wasn't really grabbing us.

120
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:06,248
And then this one night in, I think it was August of 2013,

121
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:08,289
I was sitting there.

122
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:10,511
I'm just going to, it was thunderstorming outside,

123
00:07:10,511 --> 00:07:14,113
humid, rainstorm in Pittsburgh, lightning crashed,

124
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:14,893
just so you can get the idea.

125
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:16,645
and um... the uh...

126
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:21,290
i was watching this really like great art movie called return of the living

127
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:21,951
dead

128
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:26,136
and um... it's a fantastic movie it's a cinematic masterpiece

129
00:07:26,136 --> 00:07:26,797
and um...

130
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:31,182
i was sitting there and i was thinking like this game is cool i want to make this game and now it's cool

131
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:34,426
and i don't know what to do like maybe all my ideas are bad and

132
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:35,147
stuff and then um...

133
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,641
I was watching it and so return of the living dead has this these great like

134
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:43,903
these punks it only existed in 80's movies which are great they all names

135
00:07:43,903 --> 00:07:49,846
like you know like thrash and suicide I'm razor you know like they're being

136
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:53,848
like man this isn't just a costume is my way life and it's great and then they

137
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,109
fight zombies and it's fantastic and I was like it reminded me of kind of like

138
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:00,431
the punk kids that like I kind of came up with and like the punk adults that

139
00:08:00,431 --> 00:08:02,312
Bethany and I kind of rolled around with and.

140
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:07,149
I was like man, no one makes games but us.

141
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:11,713
And so I was like, maybe we could do something with like that.

142
00:08:11,713 --> 00:08:12,955
But I wasn't good at drawing people.

143
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:14,556
I was good at drawing animal people,

144
00:08:14,556 --> 00:08:16,077
like kind of little cartoon people.

145
00:08:16,077 --> 00:08:18,219
I was like a huge Richard Scarry fan when I was a kid.

146
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:20,742
And also like, I liked them in kind of like a subversive way.

147
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:23,324
I saw this flyer like 13 years ago.

148
00:08:23,324 --> 00:08:25,766
And I was like, it just like, was like such a cool thing

149
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:28,028
of taking these kind of like early, like you know.

150
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:32,010
20s, 30s kind of like cartoon animal people and then like putting them in this context

151
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:38,134
It was like a level of like kind of like playful subversiveness that I like and so I started drawing a little animal people too

152
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:42,876
And I was like maybe I could kind of come up with some stuff or whatever and so I just sketched out these characters

153
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:45,137
And they basically didn't change until we ship the game

154
00:08:45,137 --> 00:08:48,059
This is the first sketches of them

155
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:54,672
and I sent this to, well I didn't send this to Alec yet, around about that time too, I

156
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:58,194
just recently played a game called Kentucky Route Zero, drink every time this game is

157
00:08:58,194 --> 00:08:59,935
mentioned in this talk.

158
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:03,976
And what was cool about Kentucky Route Zero is Bethany and I, Bethany is from central

159
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:08,038
Pennsylvania, I've lived in western Pennsylvania for half my life, so it's just kind of part

160
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:09,039
of who we are.

161
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,470
We um,

162
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,313
Kentucky was one of the first games where I was like,

163
00:09:13,313 --> 00:09:13,353
oh,

164
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,094
I know that place,

165
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:14,675
not Kentucky,

166
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:19,382
but it's kind of off the highway places that are kind of like in the general Appalachia region.

167
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:20,084
There was,

168
00:09:20,084 --> 00:09:21,426
there was just so much there.

169
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,749
There's so much truth to it and so much like,

170
00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:23,909
okay,

171
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:24,771
so for example,

172
00:09:24,771 --> 00:09:25,111
um,

173
00:09:26,021 --> 00:09:29,363
The only times I think I'd seen Pittsburgh in video games beforehand were...

174
00:09:29,363 --> 00:09:30,964
So there's The Last of Us,

175
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:33,746
and it's in a big post-apocalyptic ruin,

176
00:09:33,746 --> 00:09:36,128
and you're fighting people and there's monsters and stuff.

177
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:40,931
It's a great game, but it's not exactly the most positive depiction of Western Pennsylvania.

178
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:43,273
The only other time I'd seen Pittsburgh in a game was

179
00:09:43,273 --> 00:09:46,355
The Pit, Fallout 3.

180
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:46,735
Which...

181
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:48,236
It's not...

182
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:53,616
it's a slightly exaggerated version of Pittsburgh.

183
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:56,678
A lot of just wrought iron and people killing each other

184
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:59,760
and being generally unhappy.

185
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,023
And so like, I hadn't seen a lot of representation

186
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:06,484
of like our area and kind of just the people

187
00:10:06,484 --> 00:10:09,186
that live there.

188
00:10:09,186 --> 00:10:10,847
This guy lives next door to us.

189
00:10:12,588 --> 00:10:15,971
there so I was like I'll be cool and I was like similarly to with the

190
00:10:15,971 --> 00:10:17,572
characters I was like no one makes

191
00:10:17,572 --> 00:10:21,655
games about where we're from or something. So I was like hey why don't we do that like

192
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:24,578
that would be cool. So I had

193
00:10:24,578 --> 00:10:28,601
I wrote up this big, this like little pitch thing to Alec and I was like

194
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:31,864
oh yeah here's like here's some sketches here's some ideas here's like kind of what the story would be

195
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:32,604
and I sent it

196
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:35,887
and I was like this sucks this is going to end now because all my ideas are stupid

197
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:38,209
and then Alec's like no that's better let's do this and so um

198
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:44,526
So we kind of embarked on this like really, really quickly.

199
00:10:44,526 --> 00:10:45,409
I'm scrolling my notes here.

200
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:45,971
Check this out.

201
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,562
The game design vogue at that point, I think,

202
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:57,647
was to make these kind of very minimal stripped down

203
00:10:57,647 --> 00:11:01,611
experiences, you know, like silent protagonist talks

204
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:02,752
it's in kind of like ruins.

205
00:11:02,752 --> 00:11:04,434
It was like super cool.

206
00:11:04,434 --> 00:11:07,217
And also a lot of it was like hone down your mechanics

207
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:09,239
to like one thing, this kind of minimalist,

208
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:11,561
almost like Apple product design of games.

209
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:12,222
And that's really cool.

210
00:11:12,222 --> 00:11:13,423
Like some of my favorite games are like that.

211
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:18,153
But we were like no actually let's make a game where no one shuts up ever.

212
00:11:18,153 --> 00:11:23,855
Let's a big busy town. Lots of people who get this never never shut up.

213
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:27,676
Lots of writing that in no way efficiently points the the player to the

214
00:11:27,676 --> 00:11:30,898
next destination as quickly as possible.

215
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:35,399
And just this big kind of shaggy thing that you that kind of was just like

216
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,541
there is a kind of full of life and full of energy and we're going to tack on

217
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,962
all these things to it and we kind of this syrup these designs like really

218
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:42,402
really quick.

219
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:46,062
and this is like these are the original

220
00:11:46,062 --> 00:11:49,926
to concept things and cycling between them this is very cool and um...

221
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:52,429
so we kind of slapped together this uh...

222
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:53,090
kind of just uh...

223
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,595
the version of uh... maize street that's mayor main character that steve

224
00:11:57,595 --> 00:11:58,816
scruggins is that

225
00:11:58,816 --> 00:11:59,897
jerk and um...

226
00:12:00,884 --> 00:12:04,366
And we were like we want this town that you can walk around this huge world.

227
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:08,289
We want to make this big world that you can explore and we also knew that we

228
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:11,551
wanted you to spend a lot of time in these places going back and forth that

229
00:12:11,551 --> 00:12:14,333
was like a part of the game that we want to do like it was part of the routine.

230
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:18,235
I think Alec use the term ritual early early on these kind of like

231
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:21,517
building these rituals and building these routines like you can do in real

232
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:24,819
life. But we're like it's going to drag just to walk back and forth so the game

233
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:27,661
became a platformer like because jumping is fun.

234
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,289
basically. If you ever play Fallout or any of the Bethesda open world RPGs, I never walk

235
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:34,973
in those games, I'm constantly just...

236
00:12:35,562 --> 00:12:41,366
bounding along the ground, I'm like the savior of the universe, just here he comes.

237
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:45,409
But with that, we'll come back to this in a little bit, but you could be expressive.

238
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:49,512
You could be like, oh, I'm hopping down the street and bouncing off of cars and bouncing

239
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:51,934
off of mailboxes and all that.

240
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:53,175
And that was pretty cool.

241
00:12:53,175 --> 00:12:55,737
And that also enabled us to build up.

242
00:12:55,737 --> 00:12:59,559
So now we can make tall buildings and hide things in the windows and do all that kind

243
00:12:59,559 --> 00:12:59,820
of stuff.

244
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,222
And so soon, May was bouncing along those power lines.

245
00:13:03,222 --> 00:13:05,043
And that was how that kind of came to be.

246
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:11,388
At the same time we knew that there's going to be a lot of talking like better

247
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:14,570
words and kind of coming out of animation and having friends that were

248
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,291
in like independent comics and magazine making stuff I want to do something

249
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,853
that was more interesting than just like a kind of a text box up front

250
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:24,215
because text boxes can be a little stale sometimes and they can also kind of

251
00:13:24,215 --> 00:13:27,616
distance you it's like here's the game down there and then here's you and then

252
00:13:27,616 --> 00:13:31,358
the text boxes somewhere in here and there's like this distancing we want to

253
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:33,339
do that we wanted this were bubbles to feel like they were part of the

254
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:35,560
environment so I kind of sketched out this like

255
00:13:35,974 --> 00:13:38,755
these bubbly little comicky word bubbles and

256
00:13:38,755 --> 00:13:41,937
this little waggly font.

257
00:13:41,937 --> 00:13:44,838
And Alec kind of mocked something up,

258
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:48,440
this really great thing of generating and

259
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,662
doing various things with those,

260
00:13:51,662 --> 00:13:52,622
which is really, really cool.

261
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:53,243
And we knew at that point...

262
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:58,704
that there were certain themes that we wanted to tackle.

263
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,685
Like, all of us had dealt with, you know,

264
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:01,806
mental health issues in our life,

265
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:02,647
had dealt with depression.

266
00:14:02,647 --> 00:14:06,430
I was, I had dealt with something called dissociation,

267
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,972
which I actually didn't know was like a word

268
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,013
until we started making this game,

269
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:10,394
and someone was like, oh, that thing,

270
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:11,875
you're talking about this dissociation.

271
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,977
I was like, wow.

272
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:17,099
So, and there was that.

273
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:18,781
Also, all of us had been involved with the church

274
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:21,323
in the past and had since like lost our faith.

275
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:22,564
And all of us like had like,

276
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:23,985
we were all in our early 30s at the time.

277
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:29,623
now we're very old and the and we had some distance on the time period of

278
00:14:29,623 --> 00:14:34,484
maze life. You know, she's around 20. And we thought we could comment on

279
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:37,665
that now we have some distance on it and there's some similarities between

280
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:40,765
that time in life in the time that we're in in our lives to there's this

281
00:14:40,765 --> 00:14:45,386
is this transitional moment like may is like when you're 20 like you're

282
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:48,007
not a teenager anymore, but you're not quite an adult like people aren't

283
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:50,688
like people expect you to have responsibilities aren't super taking

284
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:53,468
you seriously enough to sell you alcohol at least in the US.

285
00:14:54,649 --> 00:15:00,183
So, we had these kind of themes and they would grow and change, which we'll get into a little

286
00:15:00,183 --> 00:15:01,125
bit later.

287
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,711
But with that and the dialogue and the...

288
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:08,771
the moving around we kind of had the basic building blocks of this thing now.

289
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:19,701
It's funny because people consider night in the woods a times like a nostalgia piece we have like none of us who are making the game had a lot of nostalgia for this time period of her life and actually a lot of the game.

290
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:26,007
Thematically is about how nostalgic can kill and nostalgia can really be a very bad thing just even like on a societal level.

291
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:32,350
But it was definitely, it was just something that we felt like we could explore at that time.

292
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,111
And I'm kind of glad we did because we went to some interesting places with it.

293
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:38,992
So Bethany and I were like broken in debt at the time.

294
00:15:38,992 --> 00:15:41,273
And Alec was like, OK, cool, we're using Unity.

295
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,854
We should all get like Unity license.

296
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:44,815
And I was like, we don't have any money.

297
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:47,377
And this was before Unity was free for a while.

298
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:48,638
I actually don't know what it costs now,

299
00:15:48,638 --> 00:15:50,400
but back then it cost $25,000 and we could not,

300
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,784
it didn't, but we couldn't afford it at least.

301
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:55,946
And I couldn't afford to take any time

302
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:57,828
off of trying to find work to do it.

303
00:15:57,828 --> 00:15:59,309
And Alec was like, hey, let's do a Kickstarter.

304
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:00,811
And I was like, that's not gonna work.

305
00:16:00,811 --> 00:16:03,874
And he was like, let's try it anyway.

306
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:04,915
And we're like, okay.

307
00:16:04,915 --> 00:16:05,256
So we...

308
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,621
In the process of doing that we had to mock up a whole bunch of scenes which

309
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:13,541
means that we had to do a lot of decision-making right up front about

310
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,882
what this game was going to be so the good things and very bad things about

311
00:16:16,882 --> 00:16:20,143
kickstarter is that you have to make a commitment of this is what our game is

312
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:25,425
like you know up from but we mock these things up and Alec made this really

313
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:30,286
great trailer track and it kind of start to take shape. Just these ideas

314
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:32,406
there was a feeling that was kind of coming out of it.

315
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:36,307
That was a little different than we had like first like thought about there's

316
00:16:36,307 --> 00:16:40,008
moments in a project or any sort of idea where it starts becoming what is going

317
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:45,149
to be that happens like a lot of you know it's not like we had this idea and

318
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:48,429
then 3 years later we spent up the best version of it is like it involves a

319
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:54,410
grows and changes and we're able to kind of talk about like you know it it the

320
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,871
vibe of it kind of started coming through of like the town and like where

321
00:16:58,871 --> 00:17:01,972
it was and what people are dealing with and

322
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,183
So I was like, yeah, our trailer's cool and everything,

323
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:06,885
but no one's gonna buy our weird,

324
00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:08,487
you know, no one's gonna be interested

325
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:14,194
in our weird animal people in the Rust Belt game.

326
00:17:14,194 --> 00:17:17,037
This wasn't a huge selling genre in 2013.

327
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,702
So we put up the Kickstarter and then we hit our goal within 26 hours.

328
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:30,564
And then we made four times our ask within that 30 day period.

329
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:34,946
Now, bear in mind, our initial ask was for $50,000, you know,

330
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:38,007
for three of us to work full time on it for years.

331
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:40,728
That's a very, very low number is what I'm saying.

332
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:41,468
But it was really.

333
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:45,652
exciting suddenly people are interviewing us and we were like news

334
00:17:45,652 --> 00:17:49,395
you know this thing just kind of took off and had a life of its own

335
00:17:49,395 --> 00:17:53,038
and it was not the first time that I I definitely forecasted doom and things

336
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,001
kind of worked out

337
00:17:56,001 --> 00:18:00,245
so around about that time was when Finji came along

338
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:04,368
Alec had some previous a previous relationship with the Saltsmans and had

339
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:05,029
worked with them and

340
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:05,489
the

341
00:18:09,447 --> 00:18:11,609
And so they came on as kind of our publisher,

342
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:13,330
just kind of like crossing T's and dotting I's

343
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,711
and like sending us up for, you know, talks like this

344
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:17,593
and stuff for like a really long time.

345
00:18:17,593 --> 00:18:20,134
And none of this would have been possible without them.

346
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:21,836
So after a Kickstarter, like Alec and I,

347
00:18:21,836 --> 00:18:23,437
it's like you wake up the next day

348
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,298
and you realize you've married someone.

349
00:18:25,298 --> 00:18:27,820
Like we didn't know each other, like almost at all.

350
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,781
And we wanted to get something out,

351
00:18:29,781 --> 00:18:31,802
but in part because there's like that thing,

352
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:32,963
like when you make a Kickstarter

353
00:18:32,963 --> 00:18:34,724
that everyone expects you to like fail

354
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:35,705
or like rip people off.

355
00:18:35,705 --> 00:18:36,986
So we wanted to like make something really fast.

356
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:41,564
and also just to work together to get something out some of his got to finish

357
00:18:41,564 --> 00:18:47,006
something and so the kicks are ended like at the near the end of November

358
00:18:47,006 --> 00:18:52,129
and then like 10 days in in December we made a

359
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:56,251
a little game called longest night which is kind of cool little thing.

360
00:18:56,251 --> 00:19:02,454
And we could the stars would go around you and you could kind of connect with

361
00:19:02,454 --> 00:19:06,436
the mouse of the different stars make a musical notes and then.

362
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:11,485
when you can then like after you kind of revealed the consolation the

363
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:14,327
characters down there with kind of expounding converse on it was our first

364
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:18,829
time like again like making something kind of feeling out a creative process

365
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:22,632
for kind of being trying to be flexible with the mechanics and stuff is my

366
00:19:22,632 --> 00:19:26,414
first time trying to write these characters are draw them in like in in

367
00:19:26,414 --> 00:19:28,795
ways that weren't in the trailer. You can see Greg kind of looks like a

368
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:31,937
ventriloquist dummy down there just like you know.

369
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:36,671
It was early days, but it was this kind of foundational moment.

370
00:19:36,671 --> 00:19:41,774
And we made it like, we seriously released it like an hour before each of us went home

371
00:19:41,774 --> 00:19:42,574
for Christmas.

372
00:19:42,574 --> 00:19:48,577
Like, Alec finished it and he went to the airport in Vancouver and flew back to Winnipeg

373
00:19:48,577 --> 00:19:52,179
and Bethany and I got in the car and were just hurtling through the night to central

374
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:53,240
Pennsylvania.

375
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,961
And I remember looking at my phone and seeing like, oh, um...

376
00:19:58,137 --> 00:20:02,461
This is weird. What a weird year this has been as I'm watching people like on Twitter going

377
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:07,026
Oh Night in the Woods, they released a game. That's weird. Is this what the whole game is gonna be like?

378
00:20:07,026 --> 00:20:12,231
I don't like this if this is gonna be the whole thing, but it's kind of a cool small thing and I was like wow

379
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,583
people on twitter talking about our game this is so weird 7 months ago I'd never

380
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,365
even met Alec was a thing about doing video games at all but now we'd released

381
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:24,647
a tiny little game and this is our full-time jobs. So here's the thing I

382
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:27,569
could keep doing this where I'm giving you the play-by-play of like every

383
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:32,432
month but I look and I did that talk last year to 2 and a half hours. So from

384
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:38,035
here I'm going to kind of switch to talking about some of the design

385
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:40,817
lessons kind of giving with design history of the rest of the game.

386
00:20:41,197 --> 00:20:45,683
And just some general things that we came up with.

387
00:20:45,683 --> 00:20:49,488
There were rules for us and things that we discovered

388
00:20:49,488 --> 00:20:50,329
as we went through.

389
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:52,852
I was told that one of the purposes of these talks

390
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:53,273
is to be helpful.

391
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:54,655
Hopefully some of this is helpful.

392
00:21:00,246 --> 00:21:02,927
So we didn't start working on the game full time until Valentine's Day the next

393
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:05,889
year because when you start a kick starter you don't just go I'm sorry

394
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:10,631
kick starter goodbye to jobs like you know you don't know if it's going to

395
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:16,374
if it's going to work out so we had we had like stuff left over that we still

396
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:20,476
had to finish like Alec had work I was making a cell phone commercial

397
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:25,859
animating it and and all that so we can really start working, but like right

398
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:26,319
after that.

399
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:33,672
the GDC was coming up and we made this little demo for it because we wanted to debut it at GDC.

400
00:21:33,672 --> 00:21:38,698
So within like six weeks maybe, we made this like really super early demo.

401
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:41,822
Like I don't even think we have it anymore. I kind of wish I did because it would just be...

402
00:21:42,771 --> 00:21:47,713
hilarious to look at now and Alec brought it here and demoed it and

403
00:21:47,713 --> 00:21:51,134
people are like oh this is cool, but also this part sucks and like all

404
00:21:51,134 --> 00:21:55,776
that and with the kind of you know feedback you get and so we took that

405
00:21:55,776 --> 00:21:59,517
more like OK cool we can fix this part and do this and whatever this jump

406
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:01,978
doesn't work what we're thinking and

407
00:22:01,978 --> 00:22:05,699
then soon after afterwards it was announced, you know we've been talking

408
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,341
to Sony and they announced that we're going that we're going to launch on

409
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:09,541
there.

410
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,222
on ps4 and they said hey come to the 3 this year

411
00:22:14,222 --> 00:22:18,204
and we were like okay, we'll have a do we can't go to the 3 we'll know

412
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:21,046
we're not taking no that's ridiculous

413
00:22:21,046 --> 00:22:25,449
but we spent the next couple months kind of polishing up and expanding on that

414
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:25,649
gdc

415
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:26,790
uh... demo

416
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,331
and um...

417
00:22:27,331 --> 00:22:27,591
weed uh...

418
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:36,124
What one thing that we learned really quickly was that kind of a general rule

419
00:22:36,124 --> 00:22:40,106
that I just put into words yesterday. This is a really nice way of saying

420
00:22:40,106 --> 00:22:45,689
that we decided early on that like this game is going to be about characters

421
00:22:45,689 --> 00:22:49,511
and in a in a story in a place and that was going to lead we're going to come

422
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:52,293
up with like our one mechanic and then like 2 different permutations on it

423
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:55,635
throughout the entire thing and build all of it around that bill the themes

424
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:57,056
build everything

425
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:57,536
around that.

426
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:04,634
that's applause next door so we I was like it's really raining out there so

427
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:10,856
the but we decided like yet that these moments these like other things are

428
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,877
going to kind of drive what we were doing mechanically with the game we

429
00:23:13,877 --> 00:23:19,598
decided that really early on a really great example of this was we so we just

430
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:23,019
play this game called gone home which you might have heard of this like era

431
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:25,820
defining brilliant little game gone home and.

432
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:30,036
One of the things we liked about it was a lot of gone home was you're wandering around a house,

433
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:33,179
but then you're just like, oh, it was a water bottle.

434
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,202
You could pick it up and spin it around and look at it.

435
00:23:36,202 --> 00:23:38,884
We jokingly were calling it first-person rummaging.

436
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,546
Like, you're like a raccoon.

437
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:42,167
You know?

438
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:44,589
Like, this is how a raccoon experiences your trash can.

439
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:44,729
You know?

440
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:51,296
And we thought that was really cool and we're like it would be cool to like be

441
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,037
able to like because you're in the game, you're kind of in like a side

442
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:57,199
scrolling view and like we want to get you up close into the world, you know,

443
00:23:57,199 --> 00:24:02,441
to mess with the garbage again like a raccoon and so Alec had this in this

444
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,763
moment of brilliance came up with the name for it up pause mode.

445
00:24:07,023 --> 00:24:10,966
it's a great little pun that I've been laughing at for like three years.

446
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:14,529
So there's a thing, you know, like in movies or TV shows where they'll have a real animal

447
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:16,911
sitting there and they'll have like a fake paw, right?

448
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:21,835
And they'll be like driving like or something or playing ping pong or like stirring soup

449
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:22,636
with a ladle.

450
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:27,860
And it's just like a stick with like dog fur on it and like a fake paw at the end.

451
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,124
For some reason, Alec, Bethany, and I think this is the funniest thing in the world.

452
00:24:32,124 --> 00:24:34,186
And so that's how we designed maize paws.

453
00:24:37,472 --> 00:24:39,735
That's why they're just on sticks.

454
00:24:39,735 --> 00:24:42,718
And one of the reasons, when I talk about design following

455
00:24:42,718 --> 00:24:44,400
the moment is because we're like, oh, we want to do this

456
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,682
thing, let's just make a mode where that works.

457
00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:47,943
And in doing that, we, so we.

458
00:24:53,984 --> 00:24:57,847
we're making this a 3 demo and we we built all these things we built this

459
00:24:57,847 --> 00:25:01,451
town out we built this little story line to go through we've wrote so much

460
00:25:01,451 --> 00:25:05,735
stuff and we at the end were like we should there's a we could put that a

461
00:25:05,735 --> 00:25:09,398
scene where you don't accept the end of this with your could debut pause mode,

462
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:13,422
you know, and we can explain to everyone see get a pause but also you could

463
00:25:13,422 --> 00:25:15,704
pause in games anyway, whatever and so like we

464
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:23,060
we so we kind of put that in like last minute like the day before we had to

465
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,841
ship it off to to eat 3 and so we want to eat 3. Here's our game next to like

466
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:30,743
under like under these giant jumbo tron's of like the order 1886 and

467
00:25:30,743 --> 00:25:34,564
Metal Gear solid 5 and then here's like our game where you're like sitting on

468
00:25:34,564 --> 00:25:37,645
the counter talking to your mom and we're like no one's going to play this

469
00:25:37,645 --> 00:25:41,567
no one's going to like want to read this much on the GDC or on the 3 floor

470
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:42,607
all these acronyms and

471
00:25:45,937 --> 00:25:48,399
we had like headphones and stuff so people would like put on this like

472
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:53,143
headphone and they had funds and they would just drift off like we thought

473
00:25:53,143 --> 00:25:53,403
that

474
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:56,345
is to be about 15 to 20 minutes to get through the demo people spend like

475
00:25:56,345 --> 00:26:00,328
almost an hour in it just like everyone a dialogue that may have a little

476
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:05,471
journal you can get doodles in that we ended up using the game and they and

477
00:26:05,471 --> 00:26:08,413
people would like every single thing and

478
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:11,375
you know it was this really kind of like moment like there's one point a

479
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:11,936
woman was.

480
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:15,756
playing and she turned around and she took off the headphones after spending like 45 minutes

481
00:26:15,756 --> 00:26:17,838
at it and she had like tears in her eyes

482
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:21,000
and she came up and she's like I've just never seen a game that was just made for like me

483
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,361
before and she like gave me this hug and I'm like

484
00:26:22,361 --> 00:26:25,704
this is an experience I'm having on the E3 floor

485
00:26:25,704 --> 00:26:26,144
right now

486
00:26:26,144 --> 00:26:30,008
and I remember another thing was like so you know again people getting their faces

487
00:26:30,008 --> 00:26:32,930
shotgunned off on these jumbotrons behind us

488
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,931
and this one guy finished it

489
00:26:34,931 --> 00:26:36,152
and turned around and said

490
00:26:36,152 --> 00:26:38,875
uh... guys this game that you're making is really dark

491
00:26:41,296 --> 00:26:43,717
The other great one from that is a guy went up to Alec.

492
00:26:43,717 --> 00:26:44,777
He played for a little bit.

493
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:47,938
And there's a part where you're talking to your mom and stuff.

494
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:49,379
And he kind of puts the thing aside.

495
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:51,820
He turns to Alec and goes, when does the adventure begin?

496
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:56,681
It was just this whole range of things.

497
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,202
Here's Alec and I when we first met.

498
00:26:58,202 --> 00:26:59,082
Alec has a beard then.

499
00:26:59,082 --> 00:26:59,762
He doesn't have now.

500
00:26:59,762 --> 00:27:01,203
So this is evil Alec.

501
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:04,424
This is his evil twin, you can tell because of the beard.

502
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:08,871
So people had these really close experiences with this.

503
00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:11,333
We won some awards at E3, which we're like, whoa,

504
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:14,296
I still have this in my house, because the first time anyone

505
00:27:14,296 --> 00:27:16,777
was ever like, you made a good thing.

506
00:27:16,777 --> 00:27:18,979
But you know what people like the most?

507
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:19,780
The donuts.

508
00:27:21,197 --> 00:27:31,289
of all these other things. Everyone was like oh my God, the doughnuts, the doughnuts like it was so great. But when we started off the game, we were thinking like, oh, this may be some metroidvania ish stuff. Gonna hop around and

509
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:33,392
uh, and unlock these different things and

510
00:27:33,392 --> 00:27:39,359
like unlock these different areas and all that is gonna be progression. Maybe some like big puzzles and like some more like kind of traditional narrative.

511
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:43,543
platform of things, but by this point, like all that was out the window. We're like, we're just gonna make this weird game

512
00:27:43,543 --> 00:27:48,387
We're like reading your journal and drawing in it and you're like eating doughnuts and you're hopping around on rooftops

513
00:27:48,387 --> 00:27:53,992
You're feeding rats with pretzels that you stole. These are all things that happen in the game and

514
00:27:53,992 --> 00:27:59,817
Looking through telescopes and all these other things it changed and it got weirder and it's because we were

515
00:27:59,817 --> 00:28:03,840
Open to like kind of like I said letting the design kind of follow the moment and it kind of started evolving

516
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:07,869
One of the things we started doing a lot was improvising.

517
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:10,410
We would just be like, oh, there's a knife fight part in the scene.

518
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,651
Let's just make a knife fight.

519
00:28:11,651 --> 00:28:12,531
Let's see how that goes.

520
00:28:12,531 --> 00:28:13,712
And we'd mock it up.

521
00:28:13,712 --> 00:28:16,754
And a lot of times, it would be like, OK, that works.

522
00:28:16,754 --> 00:28:18,595
And then we'd flesh it out and work on it a bit.

523
00:28:19,316 --> 00:28:23,119
but a lot of these kind of different things kinda came from just oh yeah let's do that

524
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,000
that's cool

525
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,443
and uh... so like for example

526
00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:30,167
uh... that led to all these like little like small things we called exceptions

527
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:33,410
they were exceptions to your normal uh...

528
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,813
uh... rules of gameplay and uh... so

529
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:39,236
like the knife fighting was an exception uh... the game is not about

530
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:41,018
you know bass playing for example

531
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:43,660
But the game is about being in May's position.

532
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,261
And one of the cool things about improvising and doing

533
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:47,402
these little things is after a while,

534
00:28:47,402 --> 00:28:49,463
you just stop really caring if these things can

535
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:50,523
carry a game on its own.

536
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:52,684
There's like a tension that you want

537
00:28:52,684 --> 00:28:55,586
to make sure every minigame could be its own game, right?

538
00:28:55,586 --> 00:28:57,427
It's the most polished, balanced thing.

539
00:28:57,427 --> 00:28:59,028
But the imbalance can actually be fun

540
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,229
if it doesn't last very long, or it can reveal character.

541
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,792
We don't prep you at all for this bass playing game when it comes.

542
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:09,973
And a lot of times we've watched people streaming, they're like,

543
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:13,874
oh shit, why am I playing the bass now? I don't know how to do any of this.

544
00:29:13,874 --> 00:29:15,895
But in the game, Mae doesn't know what she's doing either.

545
00:29:15,895 --> 00:29:19,216
She hasn't played bass in years. She doesn't know the songs at all.

546
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:22,098
So her panic is your panic at that point.

547
00:29:22,098 --> 00:29:25,499
You failing and not being able to play this mini-game

548
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:28,340
is like, you know, if that's what happens to you,

549
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,821
fits perfectly well with the plot.

550
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,580
of what's happening and

551
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,801
that was like a lot of fun and that was just like that kind of like

552
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:41,062
like a bit our path and going we can just try a bunch of different stuff and

553
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:45,663
if it fits with the game like that was just do it okay, cool.

554
00:29:45,663 --> 00:29:49,104
My favorite example of like a weird improvisation thing was so there's a

555
00:29:49,104 --> 00:29:53,245
part where may kind of dies for a little bit. After she gets electrocuted

556
00:29:53,245 --> 00:29:57,426
so long story and the and how sitting at the coffee shop in our

557
00:29:57,426 --> 00:29:59,026
neighborhood were like we were like half the game.

558
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,391
And I was like, you know, it'd be funny if.

559
00:30:01,893 --> 00:30:06,135
the little bonzi buddy desktop friend that Mae has,

560
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:08,075
Sharko the shark, on her laptop.

561
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:10,616
It'd be funny if he appeared to her in the afterlife.

562
00:30:10,616 --> 00:30:11,717
That'd be funny.

563
00:30:11,717 --> 00:30:14,197
And so I was like, oh, this is hilarious.

564
00:30:14,197 --> 00:30:17,218
And so I wrote in, I kind of wrote it out

565
00:30:17,218 --> 00:30:20,139
and I sent it to Alec and I was like, does this sound good?

566
00:30:20,139 --> 00:30:21,380
And he's like, oh yeah, no, that's really funny.

567
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,021
And so by 7 p.m. that entire scene was in,

568
00:30:25,021 --> 00:30:28,242
just art, music, everything, you know?

569
00:30:28,242 --> 00:30:30,362
And that's it, and it didn't change, I don't think,

570
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:31,383
from there till release.

571
00:30:31,836 --> 00:30:35,558
And it's one of my favorite kind of moments of the game and a lot of these

572
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:40,261
little moments that we're trying to like design

573
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:44,663
ended up being like some of our favorite and a lot of people who played the

574
00:30:44,663 --> 00:30:46,764
game's favorite moments in the game.

575
00:30:46,764 --> 00:30:50,426
And this leads us to another thing go simple so that you can be generous.

576
00:30:50,426 --> 00:30:52,887
We talked a lot about generosity when we were making the game.

577
00:30:52,887 --> 00:30:56,269
A good example of a really generous game like that kind of rewards poking around

578
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:57,930
just kind of keeps giving you stuff.

579
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:01,295
use cram so much interesting things and there is symphony of the night

580
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:05,420
into this Castlevania game you guys know something here than it is and so

581
00:31:08,122 --> 00:31:10,223
I think this might have been like they thought that they weren't going to be

582
00:31:10,223 --> 00:31:13,225
able to make another one maybe this team or something they just crammed all

583
00:31:13,225 --> 00:31:17,307
these ideas into like boots that you can get to make you one pixel higher and

584
00:31:17,307 --> 00:31:20,870
like little jokes everywhere like when you beat the you can beat the castle so

585
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,792
that it flips upside down you be again it's all different is like all the

586
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:27,474
different things and you're like fighting and hacking and slashing all

587
00:31:27,474 --> 00:31:31,036
over the place but there's this one room kind of spoken up in this kind of like

588
00:31:31,036 --> 00:31:33,378
howl of tones like among some people.

589
00:31:34,178 --> 00:31:35,398
who are into the game.

590
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:38,059
So you're in this cathedral in Dracula's castle

591
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:40,560
because Dracula's apparently a churchgoer.

592
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,801
And off to the side, there's this room

593
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:47,182
and the music is really somber, it's really calm.

594
00:31:47,182 --> 00:31:48,683
And all that's in there is this confessional booth

595
00:31:48,683 --> 00:31:50,764
and you can sit down on either side of it

596
00:31:50,764 --> 00:31:53,845
and eventually a little ghost will appear

597
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,665
and either kind of confess to you

598
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:56,826
or kind of take your confession.

599
00:31:56,826 --> 00:31:57,766
And sometimes they stab you,

600
00:31:57,766 --> 00:31:59,707
but you can't do anything else, that's it.

601
00:31:59,707 --> 00:32:01,888
It's just a room to have this weird moment happen.

602
00:32:03,108 --> 00:32:06,609
And so the idea of having these kind of calm moments,

603
00:32:06,609 --> 00:32:09,290
these little like off to the side places

604
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,490
that you can just sit.

605
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,991
There's a lot of places in our game where you just sit.

606
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:14,731
And sometimes you'll end up talking to someone,

607
00:32:14,731 --> 00:32:18,953
sometimes it's just there for sitting and that's it.

608
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:22,594
But us being able to be generous and like try to like put.

609
00:32:23,774 --> 00:32:26,096
all these like little moments in the game that if you poke at you'll be

610
00:32:26,096 --> 00:32:27,077
rewarded from

611
00:32:27,077 --> 00:32:30,179
we could do that because we kinda went simple

612
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:34,242
so another thing is just going low-res on stuff another game we talked about a

613
00:32:34,242 --> 00:32:35,984
whole bunch when we're making it is Final Fantasy VI

614
00:32:35,984 --> 00:32:39,587
uh... there's a part where you're uh... you know

615
00:32:39,587 --> 00:32:41,148
opera low-res and uh...

616
00:32:41,148 --> 00:32:45,351
uh... they got so much performance out of their little like cast of little sprite

617
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:48,994
characters like flopping all over the place and like crying and

618
00:32:48,994 --> 00:32:51,776
like living and dying and all this stuff and you buy it when you're watching it

619
00:32:52,307 --> 00:32:55,229
it's like little puppets or something that lack of expressiveness that low

620
00:32:55,229 --> 00:33:01,255
fidelity sells it and gives them like so much range that if you are doing

621
00:33:01,255 --> 00:33:05,438
like full on like capture and I could own everything would take you hundreds

622
00:33:05,438 --> 00:33:07,240
of millions of dollars.

623
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,183
Billions of dollars and take you forever to do, but you can do it with so

624
00:33:11,183 --> 00:33:15,507
little and we didn't have access to a whole lot at the time we're running

625
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:17,609
our dialogue out of twine and.

626
00:33:19,368 --> 00:33:39,496
But that that wasn't giving us everything we needed and was like I think creating a lot of more work for Alec to kind of get from there to it being in the game and so out of that was born a yarn which is a name that I came up with based on twine and that was my big contribution to the project and it it allowed us to do a bunch of different things.

627
00:33:40,508 --> 00:33:45,798
John down there, John Manning, and his team expanded on it with Yarnspinner,

628
00:33:45,798 --> 00:33:48,744
and eventually we had all this functionality in it,

629
00:33:48,744 --> 00:33:51,409
and it was such that even I could hop in there and do...

630
00:33:52,644 --> 00:33:55,905
like you know these like long dialogue sequences and stuff and one of the

631
00:33:55,905 --> 00:34:00,706
things we have doing speaking of low fi was we we started making it so that

632
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:04,147
will to trigger animations of like different expressions and common things

633
00:34:04,147 --> 00:34:10,008
we would use emoticons so end up with a mace as a line smiley face and

634
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:13,428
she'd smile at the end of it or she'd go like this or wave her arms,

635
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:18,249
Greg's whole this that's an emoji emoticon like and that was kind of

636
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:21,770
again like you know there a lot went into it is a pretty simple solution.

637
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,300
of doing that, doing that, just mixing and matching these kind of like lo-fi things.

638
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:31,022
Speaking of lo-fi, we had to make the characters kind of based around it, these simple characters

639
00:34:31,022 --> 00:34:33,003
that just walked and talked and didn't do much.

640
00:34:33,003 --> 00:34:36,845
I didn't have a lot of help when it came to the art for most of it.

641
00:34:36,845 --> 00:34:38,506
My friend Charles Huttner came on and helped out.

642
00:34:38,506 --> 00:34:42,168
He designed Bruce, who is one of my favorite characters in the game.

643
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:44,469
I think he's one of the best-designed characters.

644
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,209
He designed this guy.

645
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:47,070
He didn't make it into the game.

646
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:47,410
But...

647
00:34:49,072 --> 00:34:55,195
I think one of the things is that like, this kind of like, you can have an opera with 16

648
00:34:55,195 --> 00:34:57,676
pixel high characters and sell it.

649
00:34:57,676 --> 00:35:00,377
You know, like a lot of people remember that Final Fantasy opera scene and are like, I

650
00:35:00,377 --> 00:35:00,837
cried.

651
00:35:00,837 --> 00:35:06,600
And you look at it and it's just like these little guys going, you know?

652
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,181
You don't need a lot.

653
00:35:09,181 --> 00:35:10,001
You really don't need a lot.

654
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:13,912
Like, no matter how many facial polygons you have,

655
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:16,894
you're never going to suddenly, like, happen upon emotion

656
00:35:16,894 --> 00:35:20,557
or human drama as, like, a hardware feature, you know?

657
00:35:20,557 --> 00:35:22,779
No matter how much, how good your facial capture is,

658
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:25,080
how many polygons are in your face,

659
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,003
like, that's not going to create emotion.

660
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:31,005
You have to do that with the actual characters

661
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:31,545
and the story.

662
00:35:32,386 --> 00:35:35,187
and all these things that aren't as sexy to talk about.

663
00:35:35,187 --> 00:35:38,389
Expressiveness was a thing we talked about a lot.

664
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:41,690
We made another supplemental game the year after,

665
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,151
longest night, called Lost Constellation.

666
00:35:44,151 --> 00:35:46,892
We made it about five or six weeks at the end of 2014.

667
00:35:46,892 --> 00:35:47,713
And that's a

668
00:35:50,193 --> 00:35:52,815
we were kind of sprinting through it that becomes a problem later on in this

669
00:35:52,815 --> 00:35:54,277
talk and um...

670
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,819
expressiveness was i think i think i'll talk about a lot news just like it

671
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:01,042
giving the character the abit the player the ability to come mess around in that

672
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:01,642
world

673
00:36:01,642 --> 00:36:02,943
and express themselves

674
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:07,206
we are in the game you're kind of uh... talking uh... it's framed as like a

675
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,328
fairy tale that may's grandfather is telling her

676
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:13,113
and when she was when she's young wandering through these woods and you

677
00:36:13,113 --> 00:36:17,395
make the snowman and you can put these little found items in them and the

678
00:36:17,395 --> 00:36:23,058
people on those items like inhabit the snowman like like regular snowman and

679
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:24,619
the

680
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:28,181
and like oh cool how about when we make a way for you to take these various

681
00:36:28,181 --> 00:36:31,623
items and you can make the snowman faces yourself and so these are just a

682
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:32,804
couple of pull off the Internet

683
00:36:32,804 --> 00:36:36,186
things that people did you know same.

684
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:42,128
the same items, but people just made so many of them and they and they love them

685
00:36:42,128 --> 00:36:44,969
and we we have to put in a little camera button you see down there in the lower

686
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:48,351
right that would export a like a ping or a jpeg or something to your desktop and

687
00:36:48,351 --> 00:36:51,992
people like posting them it was really neat little moment. I like this guy.

688
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:55,413
And that that expressiveness.

689
00:36:56,593 --> 00:37:01,658
like paid off and people of them we we we were trying to and we we brought that

690
00:37:01,658 --> 00:37:06,542
back into the main game in a lot of different ways. Last consolation is also

691
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:11,005
proof of concept for a lot of things we want to try in the game particular came

692
00:37:11,005 --> 00:37:11,906
to exploration.

693
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:18,430
I think about exploration is I I think the exploration is one of the highest

694
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:22,273
things the best things you can do in a game like it both as like a like a

695
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:25,515
developer and like as a player like exploring finding things finding

696
00:37:25,515 --> 00:37:29,518
secrets like seeing the whole like layout of of of something in like is is

697
00:37:29,518 --> 00:37:32,440
one of the I think that the best things you can do in a game and that doesn't

698
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,084
just come with like exploring like a landmass it's exploring a story it's

699
00:37:37,084 --> 00:37:41,026
exploring dialogue it's exploring characters all those are different ways

700
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:41,867
of exploration.

701
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:47,322
And, but exploration doesn't mean a lot if you can't miss things.

702
00:37:47,322 --> 00:37:51,664
Like it becomes this precious thing, this interesting thing if you can miss it.

703
00:37:51,664 --> 00:37:55,066
Like there's a thing when you're a developer where you want to make sure everyone sees

704
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:56,307
all of your beautiful work, right?

705
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,429
Like we can't let anyone miss anything at all.

706
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:05,153
But we wanted you to be able to miss things if you didn't think to go and poke or whatever.

707
00:38:05,153 --> 00:38:08,615
Not to like punish you, but to allow there to be kind of the unknown out there.

708
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:11,631
that people could have different experiences.

709
00:38:11,631 --> 00:38:14,252
Lost Constellation, we had a whole storyline

710
00:38:14,252 --> 00:38:16,872
in our tiny little game that we made in five weeks

711
00:38:16,872 --> 00:38:18,973
that you don't see if you don't think to go

712
00:38:18,973 --> 00:38:20,773
and do certain things.

713
00:38:20,773 --> 00:38:22,413
And people responded to it.

714
00:38:22,413 --> 00:38:25,634
There's, to end this little design section,

715
00:38:25,634 --> 00:38:28,474
there was a part in Lost Constellation,

716
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,394
this little throwaway bit,

717
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:32,315
that involved all the things I just talked about.

718
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:33,935
Designing for the moment, improvising,

719
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:35,935
trying to be generous, low-res solutions,

720
00:38:35,935 --> 00:38:37,736
and expression and exploration.

721
00:38:37,736 --> 00:38:38,776
There's a cliff.

722
00:38:39,523 --> 00:38:43,765
in in lost constellation and we're like OK, what do you do with the cliff. I mean

723
00:38:43,765 --> 00:38:46,746
the player could just jump off and we can have a death state we don't want to

724
00:38:46,746 --> 00:38:51,127
do that this reset like now so like but what if

725
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:55,148
if you jump off the cliff that little May since the framing devices is the

726
00:38:55,148 --> 00:38:59,010
story being told the young to little May what if she's just jumping in and going

727
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:03,051
and she jumped off a cliff and the grandfather like no she didn't just shut

728
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:06,692
up and keep telling the story and like haha like what if you jump off the cliff

729
00:39:06,692 --> 00:39:06,972
again.

730
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:10,715
And Mae's like, she jumped off the cliff again!

731
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:13,018
The grandma's like, okay, all right,

732
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,961
we're just gonna keep going.

733
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:17,184
And you could do that 15 or 17 times.

734
00:39:17,184 --> 00:39:19,287
And we just kept adding this little story.

735
00:39:19,287 --> 00:39:20,208
You could just keep doing it.

736
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:23,733
Eventually he starts reading her a kid's book

737
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:25,255
that she hates called Charity Barity.

738
00:39:25,635 --> 00:39:29,097
which is this little like very like cloying like it's all in

739
00:39:29,097 --> 00:39:31,438
rhyme. Everyone learns a lesson. He starts reading the book to

740
00:39:31,438 --> 00:39:33,919
you if you keep jumping off the cliff and eventually he's like

741
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:36,121
okay fine. I'm not I'm going to stop telling the story if you

742
00:39:36,121 --> 00:39:38,542
don't don't shut up and that's when we put up the invisible

743
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,424
wall. That was a moment at it's one of the tiniest moments in

744
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:45,045
our games, but this one that I'm one of the I think the most

745
00:39:45,045 --> 00:39:47,766
proud of because it it was all those things and it was just a

746
00:39:47,766 --> 00:39:50,408
moment of us. Let's just try this and it worked and like

747
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:51,968
almost no one finds it at all.

748
00:39:52,805 --> 00:39:54,367
I've watched a whole bunch of people play this game,

749
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:56,909
like five people have found it, you know?

750
00:39:56,909 --> 00:39:59,851
But it's a great, great thing, I think.

751
00:39:59,851 --> 00:40:02,533
And it's something that I'm really, really proud of.

752
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,454
So those are all like design things.

753
00:40:04,454 --> 00:40:06,056
This is like the design talk,

754
00:40:06,056 --> 00:40:07,757
but there's a lot of things that go into design

755
00:40:07,757 --> 00:40:11,320
that aren't just like mechanics, right?

756
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,801
The game has a lot of ideas in it,

757
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:14,602
has a lot of context in it.

758
00:40:14,602 --> 00:40:18,185
And a lot of the things that we did,

759
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:19,046
we wanted to

760
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:25,677
We had some things to say we had some some ideas and they came out through it

761
00:40:25,677 --> 00:40:29,539
unsolvable puzzles and and unproficient which I found as an actual word

762
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:30,680
yesterday.

763
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:36,163
May isn't a character that is good at things really other than hopping on

764
00:40:36,163 --> 00:40:40,105
things like she's not smarter than you should not make better life decisions

765
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:44,767
than you. She is not tougher. She is not more clever like so many games are

766
00:40:44,767 --> 00:40:48,409
about people who can do amazing things but that's a really.

767
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:51,989
constrained kind of story that you can tell

768
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:56,853
like the story of the person who is really good at something is so many

769
00:40:56,853 --> 00:41:01,236
games and that's like a really specific thing or like the story of for example

770
00:41:01,236 --> 00:41:06,941
the space captain who can sleep with up to half of the people in their ship,

771
00:41:06,941 --> 00:41:07,121
you know,

772
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:10,023
depending on how they play their cards that super attractive,

773
00:41:10,023 --> 00:41:13,306
extremely charming boss is a very,

774
00:41:13,306 --> 00:41:16,688
very specific kind of character and you have to tell specific kind of story.

775
00:41:17,249 --> 00:41:20,435
But that is such a constrained kind of story that you can tell.

776
00:41:20,435 --> 00:41:26,506
By giving May, by not giving her that level of proficiency,

777
00:41:26,506 --> 00:41:28,650
by not giving her puzzles that she can solve,

778
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,792
May is not going to bring back...

779
00:41:30,466 --> 00:41:35,150
like the mining industry to her town may is not going to suddenly cure all from

780
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,692
mental health problems, you know the game of the game is for coming to terms

781
00:41:38,692 --> 00:41:42,815
with both of those things. Those things don't have a really quick solution to

782
00:41:42,815 --> 00:41:46,758
them you can't power up and get rid of all that and meet immediately all those

783
00:41:46,758 --> 00:41:50,041
things are difficult with mental health you can get help and that's a thing that

784
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:54,624
may kind of like you know learns I think throughout the game, but a lot of these

785
00:41:54,624 --> 00:41:57,186
other things like these are struggles you don't necessarily have access to

786
00:41:57,186 --> 00:41:57,607
all the time.

787
00:42:00,149 --> 00:42:04,053
And that leads us to a thing, kind of a pun,

788
00:42:04,053 --> 00:42:07,176
and the piggybacking on that idea is,

789
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:11,019
Alec early on was really gracious

790
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:12,541
and let Bethany and I kind of go

791
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:14,963
where we wanted with the story.

792
00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:16,965
And he, like, you know, obviously collaborative,

793
00:42:16,965 --> 00:42:19,827
but he trusted us a lot at the beginning,

794
00:42:19,827 --> 00:42:20,948
which was really cool.

795
00:42:20,948 --> 00:42:26,053
I had early on played the game called Cart Life,

796
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,661
Cart life was I think the first time I saw some my own experiences with being

797
00:42:31,661 --> 00:42:37,142
broke and being desperate and being afraid in a video game and to the point

798
00:42:37,142 --> 00:42:42,884
where I couldn't finish that was having panic attacks by the end of it.

799
00:42:42,884 --> 00:42:46,065
We went on to be it came clear that we couldn't write about these people and

800
00:42:46,065 --> 00:42:50,666
these places that we knew without going into the actual politics of it and like

801
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:53,386
that scary sometimes in games.

802
00:42:53,386 --> 00:42:55,887
But we kind of can avoid it it would be.

803
00:42:57,774 --> 00:43:00,717
The themes that we had of mental health, of capitalism,

804
00:43:00,717 --> 00:43:02,879
of loss, of loss of belief in God,

805
00:43:02,879 --> 00:43:05,781
the removal of a central organizing force in your life,

806
00:43:05,781 --> 00:43:10,065
which a lot of these things have that feeling to them.

807
00:43:10,065 --> 00:43:15,069
You kind of can't just take those aesthetics

808
00:43:15,069 --> 00:43:17,191
and slap them on.

809
00:43:17,191 --> 00:43:20,434
So we talked about it really directly.

810
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:22,275
One character reads this poem where,

811
00:43:22,275 --> 00:43:23,576
how far is Silicon Valley from here?

812
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:26,083
I'm in it.

813
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:26,984
Okay, cool.

814
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:29,325
We talked about burning it to the ground in this game.

815
00:43:29,325 --> 00:43:33,408
We're kind of kidding, but like, but we wanted to talk about that

816
00:43:33,408 --> 00:43:36,270
because you know from where we were sitting there's this massive

817
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:40,333
level of inequality and power and wealth and all these different

818
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:42,094
things and we don't have access to that.

819
00:43:42,094 --> 00:43:45,096
Everyone we know is like desperate and just trying to get by.

820
00:43:45,096 --> 00:43:47,157
That's where we were honestly before this Kickstarter.

821
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:51,174
And so we were just trying to be honest about it.

822
00:43:51,174 --> 00:43:52,756
And there's a lot of things where games,

823
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:55,039
like games that are celebrated for their mature politics,

824
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:58,143
often will just take the aesthetics of a struggle

825
00:43:58,143 --> 00:43:59,805
and then look at it solemnly and go,

826
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:02,308
yes, this is, we've made a serious game.

827
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:04,050
We're very grown up as video games now.

828
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,192
You know, you could.

829
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:09,930
You know, you have like these kind of famous devs who are like,

830
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:12,311
yeah, we're going to use all this really charged imagery,

831
00:44:12,311 --> 00:44:14,792
say from like, you know, Jim Crow or something.

832
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:16,333
And we're going to put that in a game.

833
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:20,094
And then like, let's say the character goes to an alternate dimension

834
00:44:20,094 --> 00:44:22,075
where suddenly all the black people have the guns

835
00:44:22,075 --> 00:44:24,576
and they're just like killing white children everywhere.

836
00:44:24,576 --> 00:44:26,257
And then the takeaway is extremism is bad.

837
00:44:26,257 --> 00:44:26,817
Like, the, it's, it's tourism.

838
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:41,227
It's a kind of tourism. You take these struggles, you take these real live issues in these real live places,

839
00:44:41,227 --> 00:44:42,908
and you just say,

840
00:44:42,908 --> 00:44:44,490
yeah, that's a thing. We're grown up,

841
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:48,713
and that's, and then we will make some kind of just general, well, both sides are bad or,

842
00:44:48,713 --> 00:44:52,095
you know, conflict is bad. We should just really check it out type of thing,

843
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,777
you know, where everything is just kind of this

844
00:44:54,777 --> 00:44:56,218
equivocating thing.

845
00:44:56,218 --> 00:44:58,800
And it's celebrated in games, and it drove us nuts,

846
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,982
because everybody hates a tourist.

847
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:06,694
to quote pulp the sun common people so we were just like no we're going to

848
00:45:06,694 --> 00:45:10,097
speak honestly about the things not to like preach at people because we

849
00:45:10,097 --> 00:45:15,162
weren't trying to make a game that was that was trying to blow people's minds

850
00:45:15,162 --> 00:45:17,764
like did you know that there's poor people in a place called the rust belt

851
00:45:17,764 --> 00:45:20,586
that are like getting screwed over by capitalism and it's this really

852
00:45:20,586 --> 00:45:24,790
whatever we're doing that we're trying to make myths for ourselves we're

853
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:27,853
trying to talk about these things that we cared about.

854
00:45:28,293 --> 00:45:32,736
and people like politics and games if we can look at it kind of from like a not in my backyard way

855
00:45:32,736 --> 00:45:37,499
like it's over there we went away and we saw a political struggle so if you talk about like

856
00:45:37,499 --> 00:45:42,002
labor if you talk about thank you i just got the i'm gonna have to wrap it up soon thing if you

857
00:45:42,002 --> 00:45:45,484
talk about you know labor if you talk about labor in the games industry if you talk about the need

858
00:45:45,484 --> 00:45:49,467
for workers to kind of organize in that space people certainly suddenly start getting whatever

859
00:45:49,467 --> 00:45:53,410
if you can talk if you talk about that happening on like a space colony somewhere people are like

860
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:55,111
all right well in the future they'll have to deal with that

861
00:45:55,744 --> 00:45:57,785
But if you talk about it now, people suddenly start like,

862
00:45:57,785 --> 00:45:59,125
oh, it's in my backyard now.

863
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:02,087
People are like, oh, this might affect me.

864
00:46:02,087 --> 00:46:03,987
This is really, really uncomfortable.

865
00:46:03,987 --> 00:46:06,328
If you talk about GDC, you talk about the unpaid labor

866
00:46:06,328 --> 00:46:07,549
and underpaid labor that goes on here,

867
00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:09,249
and the profit that's made by the company here,

868
00:46:09,249 --> 00:46:11,790
all these different things, people start getting really,

869
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,171
whatever.

870
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:15,752
I think that being able to just be honest

871
00:46:15,752 --> 00:46:17,592
and make kind of mythologies of our own

872
00:46:17,592 --> 00:46:18,593
about the people we knew

873
00:46:18,593 --> 00:46:20,113
and the things that we struggle with

874
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:21,974
and just kind of not bullshit about it.

875
00:46:23,067 --> 00:46:25,909
that was kind of like a really kind of big thing.

876
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:30,072
Bethany did so much like research and so much like looking into kind of her own

877
00:46:30,072 --> 00:46:34,936
past and the place where she's from and it was like and the kind of issues there

878
00:46:34,936 --> 00:46:37,958
and that and makes up so much of the bedrock kind of the dirt underneath this

879
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:43,222
game that you know and like for every time that y'all talk about anything I

880
00:46:43,222 --> 00:46:46,204
just talked about and it makes you kind of like someone uncomfortable there's 10

881
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:48,085
people who are like thank God someone said something.

882
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:52,424
right. A thing that art can do is tell people that they're not alone.

883
00:46:52,424 --> 00:46:54,825
That is one of the best things that can do.

884
00:46:54,825 --> 00:46:56,967
Being able to speak honestly

885
00:46:56,967 --> 00:47:01,130
about these type topics and just be upfront about it

886
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:03,872
and not be, and not kind of try to just

887
00:47:03,872 --> 00:47:08,536
have this kind of, these aesthetics of it means that you can kind of connect

888
00:47:08,536 --> 00:47:11,518
with people in a way that you can't otherwise.

889
00:47:11,518 --> 00:47:14,160
One of the last things is just do what you can with what you have.

890
00:47:15,608 --> 00:47:18,210
You know, Bethany and Alec and I all brought the things

891
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,831
that we were okay at to begin with.

892
00:47:19,831 --> 00:47:21,652
We learned a whole bunch of new things,

893
00:47:21,652 --> 00:47:24,613
but we were just like, let's see where this goes.

894
00:47:24,613 --> 00:47:28,415
Let's see where, you know, what we can like pull out of this

895
00:47:28,415 --> 00:47:31,237
what we can kind of make and kind of collaborate together.

896
00:47:31,237 --> 00:47:33,278
This is one of the first times I think all of us

897
00:47:33,278 --> 00:47:36,340
were in a room together back in like 2016.

898
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:40,902
And here's us like a year later, much more tired.

899
00:47:40,902 --> 00:47:44,024
Some of the hard lessons that we learned from this was

900
00:47:44,943 --> 00:47:46,744
crunched, we crunched ourselves nearly to death.

901
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:49,605
Me, literally, I almost died by the end of it,

902
00:47:49,605 --> 00:47:50,425
according to my doctor.

903
00:47:50,425 --> 00:47:54,807
I think that, that was a hard lesson.

904
00:47:54,807 --> 00:47:57,448
We sprinted and sprinted for like three and a half years,

905
00:47:57,448 --> 00:48:00,289
and it took like a lot of,

906
00:48:00,289 --> 00:48:02,530
like I'm still dealing with health issues from it,

907
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:04,810
from our launch like a year ago.

908
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:06,371
Imagine if you're in a place where,

909
00:48:06,371 --> 00:48:07,711
like we're doing that to ourselves,

910
00:48:07,711 --> 00:48:10,252
imagine if you're in a place that,

911
00:48:12,094 --> 00:48:15,977
your employment is in danger if that isn't done.

912
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:21,302
These projects can just chew you up and spit you out.

913
00:48:21,302 --> 00:48:24,384
But we released the game.

914
00:48:24,384 --> 00:48:27,187
People liked it, which was really shocking to us.

915
00:48:27,187 --> 00:48:28,708
I'm sorry, shocking to me.

916
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:30,209
The theme of this is I never think

917
00:48:30,209 --> 00:48:31,891
anything is going to work out.

918
00:48:31,891 --> 00:48:34,833
And then Alec goes, I think it'll be OK.

919
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:35,534
And then it works out OK.

920
00:48:35,534 --> 00:48:35,834
We got lucky.

921
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:40,450
We got really, really lucky.

922
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:43,553
People would say, I think because we tried to be honest,

923
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,415
you know, people would say,

924
00:48:45,415 --> 00:48:48,498
hey, playing this game, like, saved my life.

925
00:48:48,498 --> 00:48:49,980
That's not us.

926
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,122
Like, when you make art or we make whatever,

927
00:48:52,122 --> 00:48:54,284
whatever you put out there is only part of it.

928
00:48:54,284 --> 00:48:56,927
Like, other people meet you there, you know?

929
00:48:57,533 --> 00:49:00,055
people were coming and kind of meeting us there

930
00:49:00,055 --> 00:49:02,636
and having these experiences and these kind of deep experiences.

931
00:49:02,636 --> 00:49:05,137
And we were having these kind of deep conversations with people.

932
00:49:05,137 --> 00:49:07,938
And we were just lucky.

933
00:49:07,938 --> 00:49:10,799
We were just really, really, really fortunate.

934
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:13,961
From the Kickstarter, our Fingy was

935
00:49:13,961 --> 00:49:15,622
able to get us funding to kind of sustain us

936
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:16,762
for the back half of it.

937
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:21,872
never before was a game designer.

938
00:49:21,872 --> 00:49:23,073
Bethany never worked in games.

939
00:49:23,073 --> 00:49:23,913
Alec had never worked with us.

940
00:49:23,913 --> 00:49:27,196
All these were chances that just happened to work out.

941
00:49:27,196 --> 00:49:29,738
This is not like the key to success.

942
00:49:29,738 --> 00:49:30,179
We got lucky.

943
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:33,001
Loads and loads of like amazing people do super great work

944
00:49:33,001 --> 00:49:36,644
and it just doesn't kind of work out in the same way.

945
00:49:36,644 --> 00:49:39,987
But one of the great things about making art

946
00:49:39,987 --> 00:49:41,869
in conclusion is that

947
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,470
We committed to something that can only come from us.

948
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:49,351
We threw out a lot of rules, and we committed to the moment.

949
00:49:49,351 --> 00:49:51,992
And we put stories and characters and themes first,

950
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:53,252
and went where that led.

951
00:49:53,252 --> 00:49:55,972
Bethany and I were novices, and we had no experience in games.

952
00:49:55,972 --> 00:49:58,253
And Alec brought us on and trusted us.

953
00:49:58,253 --> 00:50:00,934
And we ended up pouring just ourselves and our lives into it

954
00:50:00,934 --> 00:50:03,174
in healthy and unhealthy ways.

955
00:50:03,174 --> 00:50:04,975
And it led us to this game where we could just be honest.

956
00:50:04,975 --> 00:50:07,835
And people were really gracious in responding.

957
00:50:07,835 --> 00:50:09,656
Art can tell people that they're not alone.

958
00:50:09,656 --> 00:50:10,916
Art can challenge and motivate.

959
00:50:11,557 --> 00:50:16,958
and agitate art can change people's minds and our can just be a place to go

960
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:20,078
you know if it is an easier unpleasant we have people who are like I just have

961
00:50:20,078 --> 00:50:23,659
to go back this game every now and again to the music and is being they're

962
00:50:23,659 --> 00:50:28,400
talking to the mom there every morning is this like safe

963
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,221
cool space for me.

964
00:50:30,221 --> 00:50:33,221
We also people who like this change change my outlook on a bunch of things

965
00:50:33,221 --> 00:50:36,262
to change my politics has changed my relationships with others has changed my

966
00:50:36,262 --> 00:50:39,403
relationship myself this put a name on a disorder that I have.

967
00:50:40,046 --> 00:50:43,691
Let's put a name on how I feel at work.

968
00:50:43,691 --> 00:50:44,693
Because we were just honest.

969
00:50:44,693 --> 00:50:48,058
We didn't really know how to do anything else.

970
00:50:48,058 --> 00:50:51,523
Art can show you kind of an image, good or bad,

971
00:50:51,523 --> 00:50:55,449
where you kind of recognize your reflection in it, like me here.

972
00:50:55,936 --> 00:50:59,638
People would talk about this scene where Mae kind of tries to hype herself up for a party,

973
00:50:59,638 --> 00:51:04,301
but it ends up kind of just talking about how she's gross and unattractive and weird.

974
00:51:04,301 --> 00:51:07,143
And someone's like, I thought that was the only person that felt like that.

975
00:51:07,143 --> 00:51:10,345
I'm like, I'm 36 and I did that before coming here, you know?

976
00:51:10,345 --> 00:51:10,505
Um, so...

977
00:51:13,372 --> 00:51:16,512
Games can forge those connections with people, you know.

978
00:51:16,512 --> 00:51:18,373
The art that we make can forge those connections.

979
00:51:18,373 --> 00:51:19,493
They can tell each other that we're not alone

980
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,813
and we can affect each other.

981
00:51:20,813 --> 00:51:23,334
And people said that that's kind of what this game did to,

982
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:24,734
good for them.

983
00:51:24,734 --> 00:51:28,054
And I don't know what more you could ask for as a creator,

984
00:51:28,054 --> 00:51:31,235
right, is to have people come to you and say,

985
00:51:31,235 --> 00:51:34,876
this thing that made this connection between us

986
00:51:34,876 --> 00:51:35,976
and all this like worked out

987
00:51:35,976 --> 00:51:38,997
and we had just this moment together and I didn't feel alone.

988
00:51:38,997 --> 00:51:40,917
So that's my time, everybody.

989
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:06,508
Do we have any time left for questions?

990
00:52:06,508 --> 00:52:08,909
We have time for questions.

991
00:52:08,909 --> 00:52:10,689
Okay, those are the mics.

992
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:11,869
If anyone wants to ask a question.

993
00:52:11,869 --> 00:52:17,371
If I somehow didn't address one iota of this game, please ask.

994
00:52:17,371 --> 00:52:19,072
Please ask.

995
00:52:19,072 --> 00:52:19,612
Hi.

996
00:52:19,612 --> 00:52:19,752
Hi.

997
00:52:19,752 --> 00:52:22,453
Oh, you have to introduce yourself and say, I'm Bla from Bla.

998
00:52:23,577 --> 00:52:28,278
Okay, hi, I'm Lisa from New Zealand.

999
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:31,719
So I wanted to ask, because I haven't read anywhere,

1000
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:35,540
why did you decide to have random little creatures

1001
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,701
and animals like squirrels and cats running around

1002
00:52:38,701 --> 00:52:41,921
when it's a town of cat people?

1003
00:52:41,921 --> 00:52:44,402
That was God's original plan for the world.

1004
00:52:44,402 --> 00:52:47,883
No, the animal people in the game

1005
00:52:47,883 --> 00:52:50,343
are just how I drew cartoon animal people.

1006
00:52:50,343 --> 00:52:51,544
There's just regular animals.

1007
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:53,444
Why are there humans and yet there are apes?

1008
00:52:57,074 --> 00:52:58,035
Checkmate.

1009
00:52:58,035 --> 00:53:01,157
No, there's no reason at all.

1010
00:53:01,157 --> 00:53:02,478
There's no reason.

1011
00:53:02,478 --> 00:53:04,519
People are puzzled about that.

1012
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:07,921
That is actually the number one question we get, is,

1013
00:53:07,921 --> 00:53:09,883
there's a cat, but there's also cats?

1014
00:53:09,883 --> 00:53:10,443
So, yeah.

1015
00:53:10,443 --> 00:53:11,584
I hope that's a sufficient answer.

1016
00:53:11,584 --> 00:53:12,645
Other mic.

1017
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:17,022
Hi, I'm Sienna from Los Angeles.

1018
00:53:17,022 --> 00:53:17,902
Hey, hey.

1019
00:53:17,902 --> 00:53:20,884
And I have kind of a process question,

1020
00:53:20,884 --> 00:53:23,225
like a writing process question.

1021
00:53:23,225 --> 00:53:26,047
So one of the things that you guys did really well

1022
00:53:26,047 --> 00:53:29,069
in Night in the Woods, I felt was the fact that

1023
00:53:29,069 --> 00:53:32,891
you really had this town that felt like

1024
00:53:32,891 --> 00:53:35,533
the people's lives in it were progressing

1025
00:53:35,533 --> 00:53:37,034
separate from you and you were just kind of

1026
00:53:37,034 --> 00:53:37,994
eavesdropping on them.

1027
00:53:37,994 --> 00:53:40,496
Like for example, the two dudes at the bar.

1028
00:53:40,906 --> 00:53:44,608
Right, every day had their relationship evolve a little.

1029
00:53:44,608 --> 00:53:50,031
And I was wondering if when you were, how did you go about writing those scenes?

1030
00:53:50,031 --> 00:53:53,713
Did you choose to be like, I think there should be some people here, and then you figured

1031
00:53:53,713 --> 00:53:54,373
out the whole thing?

1032
00:53:54,373 --> 00:53:58,415
Or as you were going day by day, did you kind of feel like you needed more?

1033
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,302
Yeah early on I think we just had some general ideas we wanted the world to

1034
00:54:02,302 --> 00:54:06,284
feel alive without you like Alec made these great like what we call it squirrel

1035
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:09,806
tech like the squirrels with a run around we made this great random car

1036
00:54:09,806 --> 00:54:15,088
generator like you'll never see the same car in the game twice and stuff so we

1037
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:18,930
wanted the world to feel alive in the like the world didn't need you basically

1038
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:22,632
if may was not walking on the street those 2 dudes outside of the outside of

1039
00:54:22,632 --> 00:54:25,854
like the football bar we're still going to be talking is still going having

1040
00:54:25,854 --> 00:54:26,775
their ups and downs in life.

1041
00:54:27,929 --> 00:54:32,851
And so that was it like I think early on it was just a funny idea and then as we

1042
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:36,693
went on it became more and more complex that there would be whole story lines

1043
00:54:36,693 --> 00:54:39,794
and all sagas if you were around for you miss it like the like I was saying

1044
00:54:39,794 --> 00:54:44,936
within the exploration part, but if you paid attention. It would be something

1045
00:54:44,936 --> 00:54:48,598
that would would give back to you and you can learn more about it. I think

1046
00:54:48,598 --> 00:54:51,919
one of the reasons why some folks have like really short play times and some

1047
00:54:51,919 --> 00:54:53,359
people spend like 20 hours in the game.

1048
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,461
It's because some folks are really attuned to that,

1049
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:59,363
and they'll go and seek it out, and there's a whole lot of places all around that.

1050
00:54:59,363 --> 00:55:03,386
So after a while, you just get an eye, a feeling for writing these little arcs

1051
00:55:03,386 --> 00:55:05,047
and these little mini-dramas.

1052
00:55:05,047 --> 00:55:07,349
They're like some of the most interesting stories in the game, I think,

1053
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:09,930
are these tiny little things.

1054
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,512
And understanding that.

1055
00:55:11,512 --> 00:55:15,414
And sometimes we had it so that they would only start when you triggered them the first time,

1056
00:55:15,414 --> 00:55:17,456
but a lot of times it was just ongoing.

1057
00:55:17,456 --> 00:55:19,917
And, you know, you would just kind of pop in and pop out,

1058
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:22,219
kind of like you do in real life, because that made the world feel fuller.

1059
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,560
and it made exploration mean something.

1060
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:29,541
So yeah, after a while, it just became kind of second nature

1061
00:55:29,541 --> 00:55:29,661
to do.

1062
00:55:29,661 --> 00:55:30,941
Thank you.

1063
00:55:30,941 --> 00:55:31,822
Other mic.

1064
00:55:31,822 --> 00:55:35,103
Hey, I'm Jasper from Australia.

1065
00:55:35,103 --> 00:55:37,943
And I, yeah, sort of following on from that,

1066
00:55:37,943 --> 00:55:40,604
I was wondering about, there's a lot

1067
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:41,584
of different moments in the game,

1068
00:55:41,584 --> 00:55:44,245
as you talked about, that have some relation

1069
00:55:44,245 --> 00:55:47,026
on the overall game and some that are just self-contained.

1070
00:55:47,026 --> 00:55:47,286
And.

1071
00:55:49,709 --> 00:55:52,731
To me, that was really nice because it kind of represented

1072
00:55:52,731 --> 00:55:54,452
like how life is.

1073
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:55,433
Sorry, excuse me.

1074
00:55:55,433 --> 00:56:00,938
And I remember you tweeted a while ago about maybe you were

1075
00:56:00,938 --> 00:56:03,760
frustrated that people kind of felt that these were all

1076
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,103
linked and that there was some sort of overarching thing that

1077
00:56:07,103 --> 00:56:10,166
happened that linked every single thing in

1078
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:11,987
the game together.

1079
00:56:11,987 --> 00:56:13,568
And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit

1080
00:56:13,568 --> 00:56:14,009
about that.

1081
00:56:14,009 --> 00:56:14,509
Yeah.

1082
00:56:14,509 --> 00:56:17,572
The football fans that were just mentioned, they're behind

1083
00:56:17,572 --> 00:56:17,972
the whole thing.

1084
00:56:18,569 --> 00:56:22,571
full game. No there's there's a thing in a lot of kind of like it's been going on

1085
00:56:22,571 --> 00:56:25,012
for a while but like right now I think it's a big thing of like everything has

1086
00:56:25,012 --> 00:56:29,173
to be meta everything has to be like plot a like gear a of the plot here

1087
00:56:29,173 --> 00:56:33,095
this turn a gear over here or else this is just what do you even doing and

1088
00:56:33,095 --> 00:56:36,636
having this here if you have a missing character they have to show up later as

1089
00:56:36,636 --> 00:56:37,836
that mysterious person

1090
00:56:38,362 --> 00:56:41,024
you know if there's like a villain you don't know who it is it has to be your

1091
00:56:41,024 --> 00:56:43,005
dad you know it has to be like

1092
00:56:43,005 --> 00:56:44,045
this little like

1093
00:56:44,045 --> 00:56:47,567
christopher nolan ask puzzle box type things and those things are cool

1094
00:56:47,567 --> 00:56:50,769
but it's not like how you can do like you know that's not the way to do

1095
00:56:50,769 --> 00:56:50,809
uh...

1096
00:56:53,264 --> 00:56:55,485
I'm getting the wrap it up thing here.

1097
00:56:55,485 --> 00:56:59,368
And I think that's kind of a frustration and we wanted to avoid that.

1098
00:56:59,368 --> 00:57:04,592
We wanted to have these episodic moments because we just liked episodic things and stories.

1099
00:57:04,592 --> 00:57:09,096
And we wanted to have these little closed off sections just so you can find, you can

1100
00:57:09,096 --> 00:57:12,418
stumble into like the confessional room, you know, the story version of that.

1101
00:57:12,418 --> 00:57:15,661
All these little things that fleshed out the world and maybe got across ideas.

1102
00:57:16,221 --> 00:57:19,782
expressed character and themes and all these things like so many things exist

1103
00:57:19,782 --> 00:57:23,383
in the world just for that the 2 guys outside of the smelters bar, you know

1104
00:57:23,383 --> 00:57:27,544
they don't exist to you know, you know be main plot points there there in the

1105
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:30,684
world and you can follow their little story and their little life you can

1106
00:57:30,684 --> 00:57:36,566
kind of get like involved that way and it's I for me that's over and for us I

1107
00:57:36,566 --> 00:57:40,267
think in the game that's really a lot of the beauty of the world is right.

1108
00:57:40,267 --> 00:57:43,747
It's not just this thing that your character goes through and drives all of

1109
00:57:43,747 --> 00:57:45,208
it. It exists without you and

1110
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:52,451
you other characters having their own agency has nothing to do with you

1111
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:56,212
makes them more human and makes the story in the world more human and I

1112
00:57:56,212 --> 00:57:58,693
think we wanted to just have a lot of humanity in the game.

1113
00:57:58,693 --> 00:58:04,275
So there's that okay. I think that's all the questions I can take what we're going over to the wrap-up room,

1114
00:58:04,275 --> 00:58:06,136
which is apparently right around the corner.

1115
00:58:06,136 --> 00:58:11,357
Yeah, it's it's around the actually don't know where it is.

1116
00:58:11,357 --> 00:58:12,478
It's right around the corner over there.
