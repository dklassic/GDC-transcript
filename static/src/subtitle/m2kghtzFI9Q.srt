1
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:06,668
First, I'll go ahead and introduce myself.

2
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:08,950
My name is Alexandra M. Lucas.

3
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:11,652
I'm a game writer and narrative designer.

4
00:00:11,973 --> 00:00:14,435
I spent the last few years writing for Microsoft's Cortana

5
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:17,197
team, and I'm currently narrative lead on a project

6
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:17,978
I can't talk about.

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,620
But I've worked on a variety of game types,

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,202
from RTS mobile games to interactive novels

9
00:00:23,222 --> 00:00:24,784
to educational MMORPGs.

10
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:27,186
Delivered presentations and published

11
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:28,907
on romance and sexuality in games,

12
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:31,650
mental health in games, and gender identity in pop culture.

13
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:37,620
And I've telecommuted with clients across the country, across the US where I'm based,

14
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:40,746
as well as Eastern Europe.

15
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,553
So I'll go ahead and pass it on to my other panelists here.

16
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:50,399
Hi everyone, my name is Michelle Clough. I am also a writer and narrative designer.

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,444
I am also the token non-American of the panel. I'm actually based in Vancouver, British Columbia.

18
00:00:57,104 --> 00:01:01,747
And as a result, I have basically had nothing but international clients.

19
00:01:02,148 --> 00:01:07,091
All of my American clients have been international, and I've also worked with clients in...

20
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:13,076
The Ukraine, Hungary, China, and so on.

21
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:22,102
I've worked in visual novel games, in third person shooters, match three mobile games,

22
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:30,128
and in my spare time I also chair the IGDA Romance and Sexuality Special Interest Group.

23
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:36,833
Hi everybody, my name is Heidi McDonald. I'm a little bit under the weather, I apologize for that.

24
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:40,274
I've been in the games industry for about eight years,

25
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:46,336
doing writing and game design and creative direction and all kinds of stuff like that.

26
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:54,818
Lately I have gone independent and I am currently working on a contract for Disruptor Beam

27
00:01:55,238 --> 00:01:58,759
on an unannounced mobile title that's very exciting.

28
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,661
Yeah, I've been working remotely about three and a half years, so it's fun.

29
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:08,702
Hi, my name is Patrick Corsi.

30
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,523
I'm a yet another writer, narrator, designer.

31
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:18,304
I've been working in the industry for about five years and freelancing for about four of those years.

32
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:24,165
My last big contract was a two-year, two and a half year long stint at a

33
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:29,146
studio in Melbourne, where I spent half the time actually in-country in the studio.

34
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:33,210
and the rest of it I have spent as a remote designer

35
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:36,253
working for them on a title that is yet unannounced.

36
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:39,536
Before that, I worked with a studio in Switzerland,

37
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:42,719
Blienflug Studios, on two games, Cloud Chasers,

38
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,500
which was an award-winning mobile game,

39
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:47,263
and then the follow-up to that was a sequel, Airheart,

40
00:02:48,104 --> 00:02:50,105
which just recently hit Switch and has done very well there,

41
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:50,946
so I'm very proud of that.

42
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:52,968
And then before that, I worked in...

43
00:02:53,629 --> 00:03:00,795
A variety of genre, augmented reality, alternate reality games, internet video, stuff like that.

44
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:03,478
So I've kind of done a bunch of things.

45
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:11,239
Hi everybody, I am Toya Kristen Finley. I am a writer and editor in general, so I work in different media.

46
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:15,740
And in games, I am a game designer, a narrative designer, and an editor.

47
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,381
And I have been telecommuting my entire adult life, just about.

48
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:31,523
So I'm very familiar with it. I think I have been in a room with a team that I have worked with all of three days for the almost 20 years that I have been telecommuting.

49
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:36,885
I am on the executive board of the IGDA game writing SIG.

50
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:41,406
I have also done a couple of books. I co-authored the game narrative toolbox.

51
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:44,927
That was with three other authors. It was done virtually.

52
00:03:44,947 --> 00:03:52,910
I am also the editor and contributor to narrative tactics for mobile and social games, pocket-sized storytelling.

53
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:01,532
And I have had clients in Chile, Portugal, Singapore, Australia, China, as well as the United States.

54
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:08,537
Okay, great. So welcome to our panelists. Thanks for being here today. We're going to go ahead and dive in.

55
00:04:09,418 --> 00:04:16,363
Our first question is, is telecommuting actually doable? So what would you say to a telecommuting skeptic?

56
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:26,010
I'd say that on days when you really don't feel well and don't have a very good voice, that's the perfect time to have a telecommuting job.

57
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:30,841
You also have the benefit of not needing to wear pants.

58
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:36,325
I mean, I am wearing pants. You can't see. I am wearing them. I wore them for you.

59
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:42,490
I have a running gag where I have a line item on my invoices, an add-on for pants wearing.

60
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,270
There you go.

61
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:46,133
If they want to pay me more, I'll wear pants.

62
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:50,296
At the office you would have casual Fridays, but you can have no pants Fridays.

63
00:04:51,537 --> 00:04:53,778
So there's that. All right. Michelle, you have something?

64
00:04:54,737 --> 00:05:11,673
Another thing that's actually really nice about telecommuting is if you are in the phase of your career where you may have a day job that has absolutely nothing to do with video gaming, in which case you have to go out to your local office or your local job and then you get to come home.

65
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:17,635
You can't just throw off all your clothes, pants optional, and sit down at your computer and do some work there.

66
00:05:17,835 --> 00:05:21,936
Or curl up in bed and do stuff on your laptop.

67
00:05:21,976 --> 00:05:29,358
So it is actually eminently doable if you are, and might even be the best way to do it,

68
00:05:29,838 --> 00:05:38,540
if you're still doing work part-time on top of a non-industry day job.

69
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,880
Or indeed an industry day job.

70
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:46,222
So I was apparently doing telecommuting before it was a thing, so I would say hell yes.

71
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:52,025
This is actually my 11th GDC in a row, and I... Thank you!

72
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:55,787
So my first GDC, I knew nothing about game development.

73
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:59,409
You know, I had been publishing as a fiction writer,

74
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,632
and I just wanted to find out, you know, can I do this in games as well?

75
00:06:04,552 --> 00:06:07,874
And the thing I was being told, because I'm from Nashville, Tennessee,

76
00:06:07,954 --> 00:06:11,217
which is an amazing game hubâ€”no, it is not.

77
00:06:11,457 --> 00:06:13,058
Oh, you're from Nashville, too. Awesome.

78
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:19,742
There's hardly any game development whatsoever in Nashville.

79
00:06:20,582 --> 00:06:23,364
And I said, hey, I would really like to get into games writing,

80
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:25,946
and 11 years ago, people were telling me, you have to move.

81
00:06:26,946 --> 00:06:30,248
And I was thinking, why? I have a laptop.

82
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:35,720
I'm able to send emails and send documents.

83
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:38,042
But there was a lot of skepticism, right?

84
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:45,209
But there weren't all of these platforms back then, like Jira and FreedCamp and Trello.

85
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,932
And so now it's a lot easier.

86
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,254
You have a lot more virtual studios as well.

87
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:54,417
Renting an office space is very expensive.

88
00:06:54,717 --> 00:06:58,019
And so devs are finding out, hey, we can make this work.

89
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,882
We can have people located all across the world.

90
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:05,285
And the other thing is, sometimes the right person

91
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:08,587
is on the other side of the world than you are.

92
00:07:08,848 --> 00:07:10,429
And they're the right person for the job,

93
00:07:10,869 --> 00:07:12,110
and you can't bring them to you.

94
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:19,753
And so skeptics need to understand that this is a greater opportunity for people who are marginalized as well

95
00:07:19,793 --> 00:07:23,134
and can't just take up and move to a hub. It's expensive.

96
00:07:24,014 --> 00:07:28,635
Yeah, I kind of want to echo that what you're talking about in terms of the resources and the tool sets that are available now.

97
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:30,996
It seems like now as opposed to

98
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:35,818
You told me to angle it this way, so I'm going to try to do it this way. As opposed to

99
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:39,979
you know even five, seven years ago

100
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:41,799
is the best time for telecommuting.

101
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,745
It's one that we have the broadest range of tool sets

102
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:47,391
in terms of communication, in terms of content delivery,

103
00:07:48,013 --> 00:07:48,594
in terms of...

104
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,342
of co-working on any sort of documentation or things like that.

105
00:07:54,603 --> 00:07:58,226
The tools and the resources for those sorts of things have exploded in the past few years.

106
00:07:59,027 --> 00:08:04,471
So much so that I worked on a studio that was constantly on the hunt for the best one

107
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:07,173
and we were changing, it was in a great environment, but we were changing

108
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:10,916
tool sets for communication for just team chat

109
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:13,558
over and over again, three times just to find one just for us.

110
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:18,970
Yeah, the answer would be yes, absolutely.

111
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,010
But, and we'll talk about it later,

112
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,530
there are challenges that rise up because of that.

113
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,931
You have to be aware of, and it depends on the discipline.

114
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:29,812
Writing has a long history before computers

115
00:08:30,112 --> 00:08:31,012
of remote working.

116
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,092
So there's a little more infrastructure there.

117
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:36,673
Departments like art or programming

118
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:39,133
have a little more nuance and some challenges

119
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:41,414
that you need to be aware of when

120
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:42,274
you start going into that field.

121
00:08:43,028 --> 00:08:49,533
I just wanted to jump off something that Toya said about telecommuting being really good

122
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:50,934
for marginalized people.

123
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,417
I have a really goofy life.

124
00:08:56,079 --> 00:09:00,322
I spend half of my time in Pittsburgh, I spend half of my time in Raleigh, North Carolina.

125
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:03,445
I have a special needs child and I have rheumatoid arthritis.

126
00:09:04,146 --> 00:09:08,729
And all of those things put together would make it really, really hard for me to actually

127
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:10,991
go and attend a job every day.

128
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:16,174
But I mean, I have been able to turn out award-winning work despite that,

129
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:21,237
because of the fact that I've had the flexibility to work remotely.

130
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:27,140
And I don't think it's as much convincing people that working remotely is great.

131
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,682
I think it's a matter of convincing companies.

132
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:35,327
That it's really to your interest to allow this as a choice for people who need it.

133
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:37,589
Working remotely is not for everybody,

134
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,833
but it is something that I think would make things better

135
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:47,759
and help bring in a more diverse group of developers across the board

136
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:53,484
if companies gave that choice more readily to people who would like it.

137
00:09:55,705 --> 00:09:58,986
Yeah, I was just going to jump in real quickly and we'll move on to our next question.

138
00:09:59,587 --> 00:10:04,008
My husband and I recently moved to a small town just outside Seattle after being based

139
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:08,369
in Seattle a long time, and it is half the cost of Seattle.

140
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,351
And part of how we were able to do that is we simply asked our employers if telecommuting

141
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:16,092
was possible, and they said yes.

142
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:17,832
And it was just something we hadn't considered.

143
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:21,074
Or we felt they'd really be closed off to you.

144
00:10:21,114 --> 00:10:26,377
And part of it is finding sort of a telecommuting setup that works for you and the client.

145
00:10:26,898 --> 00:10:31,701
So I know folks who work at studios where it's two days a week that are telecommuting.

146
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:35,883
So everyone knows that and you know makes their schedules accordingly.

147
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:41,587
So it is about working with the client, working with the studio to find something that works for everyone.

148
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:52,874
So great, we'll go ahead and move on to our next question, which is how do you find international slash freelance clients?

149
00:10:56,586 --> 00:10:57,746
So a couple of ways.

150
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:02,068
Getting to know people in my own network,

151
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:08,449
whether that is face-to-face at GDC or PAX or ECGC.

152
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,690
And of course, not everybody can get to conferences.

153
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:18,032
So in Facebook groups, we have a game writing group.

154
00:11:18,993 --> 00:11:19,533
On Twitter.

155
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:28,484
And so people have gotten to know me, and when they meet someone who needs a game writer or a narrative designer or even an editor...

156
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:32,230
They'll give that person my contact information.

157
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,570
I get surprisingly wonderful random emails sometimes,

158
00:11:37,211 --> 00:11:40,071
or I will get someone contacting me

159
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:43,392
through my website who was referred to me by someone else.

160
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:45,072
So that's really important.

161
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:47,353
And then, of course, there's the direct,

162
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:50,413
you know, I see a posting or something like that,

163
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,914
and I will respond to it.

164
00:11:53,594 --> 00:11:57,595
And I find nowadays, like in the last couple of years,

165
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:04,317
And it blows my mind, and I guess it shouldn't, but I'm thinking back to the days of when this didn't happen at all.

166
00:12:04,777 --> 00:12:09,819
There are Twitter postings for jobs, you know, and now we're seeing more and more

167
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,122
remote work fine, or you know, freelance contracting remotely fine.

168
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:21,564
So find those Twitter feeds where people are likely to post jobs,

169
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:27,607
find groups online over social media or even discussion forums like, you know,

170
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:32,208
Unity forums or Indie forums where people are posting gigs.

171
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:35,850
And if they're like Unity or smaller Indies,

172
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,451
they're probably going to be working remotely with people anyway,

173
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:44,033
because like I said, it's too hard to maintain a physical space.

174
00:12:44,093 --> 00:12:44,933
It's very expensive.

175
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:50,049
Hashtag game jobs is one of the big ones for Twitter where you

176
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,992
see a lot of postings there.

177
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:55,747
But yeah, I've noticed that a lot of people,

178
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,490
when they're looking for work, despite the fact

179
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,852
they want to work remotely, they'll still only focus on,

180
00:13:01,332 --> 00:13:02,834
when they're doing the job searches

181
00:13:02,874 --> 00:13:04,695
or looking at studios, they'll focus on ones

182
00:13:04,735 --> 00:13:06,096
that are regionally nearby.

183
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:10,260
Or they sort of get locked into a tunnel vision of places

184
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,601
they want to live or something like that,

185
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:13,543
instead of just doing a broad-based search

186
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:17,687
for every studio or cold calling smaller studios

187
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:18,387
to see what they need.

188
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:23,415
So make sure when you're looking for job postings,

189
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:26,596
it's OK to ping them and ask, hey, can this be remote?

190
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:29,077
Or, hey, hit them up on Twitter.

191
00:13:29,117 --> 00:13:31,058
Hit their official Twitter account or something like that.

192
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:32,319
Hey, can this be remote?

193
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,660
I have my qualifications, but I really

194
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,301
like the hot dog place down the street,

195
00:13:37,321 --> 00:13:38,741
so I don't really want to move or something like that.

196
00:13:41,873 --> 00:13:44,816
But also, you mentioned coming to GDC.

197
00:13:44,956 --> 00:13:49,421
My first international freelancing work I ever received

198
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:55,567
was by going to the Swiss Games booth in GDC in 2014

199
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:58,069
and meeting the designer at BlinFlug.

200
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,232
And we just hit it off and then he mentioned that he needed a game writer

201
00:14:01,513 --> 00:14:03,254
and that's how we developed our relationship.

202
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,538
So walking around and actually introducing yourself,

203
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:09,601
and not being so upfront to say, you know,

204
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:11,643
hey, can I work for you, or anything like that,

205
00:14:11,723 --> 00:14:12,984
but just getting to know what their needs are,

206
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:14,245
getting to know how you can help them out,

207
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:15,286
getting to know what they're working on,

208
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:17,208
not necessarily the thing that they're pitching at the moment,

209
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:17,869
but in the future,

210
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:19,830
and letting them know that you're available

211
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:24,095
is an excellent way to start building up that network,

212
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:25,216
building out your reputation,

213
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:27,838
and getting your name in front of people's faces.

214
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:30,710
Let me jump in really quickly about something you said.

215
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,510
A lot of times people don't know that they need you.

216
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:39,792
You'll hear about a project that they're working on, and they don't have that position filled.

217
00:14:40,732 --> 00:14:44,633
And so when you're talking to someone, whether it's face to face or over email or however,

218
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:51,794
look very carefully and listen very carefully to the holes that need to be filled, and then

219
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:53,495
explain how you can fill that hole.

220
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:58,244
I would say take LinkedIn very seriously.

221
00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:02,406
I know a lot of people just kind of have like a half-assed profile or whatever, but

222
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:07,868
I noticed that once I started actively updating my LinkedIn

223
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:11,890
and treating it like a really serious place for people to find me,

224
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,750
people started finding me.

225
00:15:14,951 --> 00:15:20,713
I had three different companies from other countries outside the United States

226
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,314
all contact me based on LinkedIn.

227
00:15:23,854 --> 00:15:28,858
So I think that that's one of the places that people are going to find developers.

228
00:15:29,658 --> 00:15:33,701
When I was given that advice about LinkedIn, I was very surprised because it's not really a site

229
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:37,083
that a lot of people think about maintaining or going to every day.

230
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:43,027
There are certain benefits to it, but it's certainly not on the daily hit of Twitter or Facebook or whatever.

231
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:46,970
But it is the place to get your name in front of people who are hiring.

232
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,112
Make sure it's, you know, actively maintain it.

233
00:15:53,892 --> 00:16:02,376
I'll also second the importance of LinkedIn, although I'll be sort of the odd one out and say that I don't keep mine as updated as I should,

234
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:06,198
and yet I've got tons of work through LinkedIn even when it's not that updated.

235
00:16:06,238 --> 00:16:14,802
So, but definitely like create, at the very least, a strong base profile that even if you're not updating it all the time,

236
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:16,743
that like someone can go to you and immediately see.

237
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:21,145
What your strengths are, what your skills are and what they're looking for and chances

238
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:22,786
are you will get some messages.

239
00:16:23,546 --> 00:16:30,869
The other thing is make sure to have a website with some strong portfolio pieces and an easy

240
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:34,770
way to get in touch with you because that's the other way that I've gotten most of my

241
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,852
contracts is that I've just been going about my daily life and the next thing I know, bing!

242
00:16:39,192 --> 00:16:46,973
Hey, I'm looking for a narrative designer, and your name's come up in Google, so could we talk more about our project?

243
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:58,095
And so there is something to be said for absolutely pursue the active ways of networking and getting on social media and talking to people,

244
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:06,236
but don't neglect the sort of more, I don't want to say passive, but the sort of more permanent things that you have running in the background as well,

245
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:06,597
because...

246
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:10,261
They can and will get you work.

247
00:17:11,202 --> 00:17:17,349
Not necessarily consistently, but it's way better to have them than to not have them.

248
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:22,395
And the other thing I would say is, sort of on the case of networking,

249
00:17:23,597 --> 00:17:24,818
don't be afraid to...

250
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:31,521
like, in fact, actively network with people that are not necessarily going to get you a job, you know, because

251
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:37,043
you might think, well, I don't need to hang out with the writers, the writers, you know, or the programmers or the

252
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:41,844
artists, they're my competition. No, they're your colleagues and

253
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,225
if you make those connections with them, then

254
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:51,927
later on when someone says to say, Toya, like, oh, I really want to make a game about, I don't know,

255
00:17:52,587 --> 00:17:59,775
Steamy romance involving like Dragon Age characters. She'll be like, that's not my bad. No, that's you. Actually, it's us

256
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:06,942
So yeah, so so make sure to make those connections with your own discipline as well

257
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,523
Michelle said something really important beyond like the steamy romance with the Dragon Age characters.

258
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:12,443
Also very important.

259
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:15,204
All I heard was Dragon Age.

260
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:20,027
She mentioned have a way to contact on your website.

261
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:25,710
That sounds obvious, but sometimes the obvious needs to be stated.

262
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,312
I had a friend on Facebook who was an editor putting an anthology together,

263
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:35,815
and she was getting super frustrated because there were all of these writers she wanted to invite.

264
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:41,482
But when she went to their websites, there was no way, there was no contact information whatsoever.

265
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:42,564
There was no web form.

266
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:45,248
You know, she would go to their LinkedIn.

267
00:18:45,468 --> 00:18:47,030
No way to contact them.

268
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,815
And I know that for some of us...

269
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:57,121
The internet can be a very scary place because we can get very unwanted attention.

270
00:18:58,102 --> 00:19:02,106
I, for a while, had somebody who he wasn't dangerous but he was just really annoying

271
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:04,528
and I did not want it to get dangerous.

272
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:08,192
So I actually didn't have an online portfolio for a long time

273
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,594
because I didn't want him to be able to contact me.

274
00:19:11,574 --> 00:19:19,359
But there are websites like Wix where you can make a website and there is like a contact form there

275
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:25,043
where people don't see your email address, but if they fill in the contact form it will go to your email.

276
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:32,067
So put as much contact information online as you feel is comfortable and that will keep you safe.

277
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:36,327
And that goes for every field, too, not just writers or art.

278
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:41,011
Even programmers or producers or any sort of department

279
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:46,675
in the industry needs to have a billboard that they

280
00:19:46,695 --> 00:19:48,617
can point to.

281
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:55,791
people who, you know, if something comes along, you want to be ready when that

282
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:59,293
opportunity comes along. You want to be able to say, you know, not hold on a

283
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,054
moment I need to put something together for you, but you want to say here's the

284
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:05,396
link so you can look through my samples in whatever form they take, you know, in

285
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:11,119
whatever form, whether it's, you know, a fancy Gantt chart or, I don't know, I don't

286
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:14,781
know, but whatever form those samples look like, whatever the form your

287
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:17,403
billboard takes, you absolutely want to have that ready and available.

288
00:20:18,222 --> 00:20:23,324
And this is my please be careful, there are plagiarists out there PSA.

289
00:20:23,904 --> 00:20:29,326
There are plagiarists out there and I do know people who've had samples online

290
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:33,268
and people have taken their samples and used it in their own applications.

291
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:38,230
The best way to try to guard against that is a PDF.

292
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,652
So if you have anything that is not in a PDF and it's online,

293
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:44,953
please convert it to PDF as soon as possible.

294
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:51,692
That's not a complete fail-safe, but if people are already too lazy to do their own work,

295
00:20:51,873 --> 00:20:53,759
it is a nice hurdle for them to get over.

296
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:57,792
Perfect, and last thought on that question.

297
00:20:58,812 --> 00:21:00,453
If you're feeling a little lost on how

298
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,874
to start with getting involved in these communities,

299
00:21:02,914 --> 00:21:07,276
whether you're a writer or a sound designer or something

300
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:09,578
else, a lot of folks up here mentioned

301
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:14,540
that they run or are part of the IGDA SIGs, Special Interest

302
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,080
Groups.

303
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,841
There's one for just about everything.

304
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,022
And if there isn't, you can start it yourself.

305
00:21:21,223 --> 00:21:26,584
But that generally leads you, those lead you to the relevant Facebook groups and

306
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:31,725
meetups and the sort of things. So that is a place you can start to get involved

307
00:21:32,065 --> 00:21:39,246
into network. So all right, our next question here. We'll dive into the pros

308
00:21:39,286 --> 00:21:45,167
and cons of using freelance platforms like Upwork, People Per Hour, and so on

309
00:21:45,227 --> 00:21:46,147
for those who use them.

310
00:21:48,968 --> 00:21:50,088
Okay. Second that.

311
00:21:52,582 --> 00:21:55,605
So I used Elance before Elance was a thing.

312
00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:59,608
Elance merged with Odesk to become Upwork.

313
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:06,134
Yes, you can get a living wage on freelance platforms

314
00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:10,919
like that, but it's difficult. One reason why

315
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,602
is that the platforms themselves market themselves

316
00:22:14,943 --> 00:22:17,385
as places to find cheap work.

317
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:23,583
So what ends up happening is you have non-professionals trying to do your job.

318
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:31,414
And you also have cheap, scammy clients who want to pay you $5 and $10 an hour.

319
00:22:34,108 --> 00:22:38,610
And so what happens is it's very difficult to find great clients.

320
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:46,395
Now I did through Elance, but it is difficult and you might end up spending way too much

321
00:22:46,555 --> 00:22:51,477
energy and time trying to figure out who's valid and who is not.

322
00:22:52,258 --> 00:22:55,481
So like right now I have an Upwork profile.

323
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:59,845
I haven't touched Upwork in probably like three or four years.

324
00:23:00,606 --> 00:23:07,193
Every once in a while I will get an email from someone, you know, who is looking for a game writer.

325
00:23:08,714 --> 00:23:11,276
But it's really not that useful for me.

326
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:15,401
The one thing I will say that is actually nice about those platforms...

327
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,605
is if you jump through all of the hoops that you need to,

328
00:23:19,805 --> 00:23:23,309
you can make sure that you get paid if somebody tries to stiff you.

329
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:26,873
But otherwise, I would stay away from them.

330
00:23:29,156 --> 00:23:32,579
Yeah, I would agree 100% with everything that I just mentioned.

331
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:35,743
One thing I found it was useful for is

332
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:43,805
For me, I was trying to dip my toes into different types of writing or different types of professions

333
00:23:43,845 --> 00:23:47,708
that I hadn't really had much experience with, so it was a good way to try stuff out while

334
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:48,769
still getting some money for it.

335
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:56,736
That's not the ideal method of making a living, but it was useful for me that I had a goal

336
00:23:56,777 --> 00:24:00,400
and I had a task, and so I could try my hand at this thing, like technical writing or something

337
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,662
like that, while also still...

338
00:24:04,753 --> 00:24:07,176
valuing my time properly.

339
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:12,701
But yeah, there's a lot of competition

340
00:24:12,962 --> 00:24:15,784
and a lot of wage depression that

341
00:24:15,804 --> 00:24:16,786
happens on sites like that.

342
00:24:18,687 --> 00:24:20,049
So it's a tough choice.

343
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:29,258
To the wage depression thing, there's also a lot of discrimination based upon where you live, you know.

344
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:33,541
You might be trying to get a professional rate, but the client might think,

345
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:35,782
well, you live in this country, you don't need to make that much money.

346
00:24:36,623 --> 00:24:39,945
I mean, I know freelancers who have had to deal with that, so.

347
00:24:42,405 --> 00:24:47,770
Yeah, I have either four or five accounts, you know, with those types of places,

348
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,612
and I've never gotten a single item of work from any of them.

349
00:24:51,293 --> 00:24:55,657
So I just pretty much leave the profiles alone and worry about other things.

350
00:24:56,237 --> 00:25:01,622
If it happens, it happens, great, but I don't put any real stock into those sites at all.

351
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:14,213
I think I have gone on Upwork maybe four or five times in my life.

352
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:19,979
I managed to get one client and it was mostly through Toya's recommendation

353
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:22,301
because there was a client that was looking for multiple writers.

354
00:25:22,982 --> 00:25:25,104
And then I pretty much never touched it again.

355
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:33,852
means that I'm not the right person to be giving, you know, insight on Upworked, or maybe it means I'm the perfect person to

356
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:40,478
give insight because, yeah, you can quite happily go through your freelance career never touching any of them.

357
00:25:40,638 --> 00:25:46,123
So don't feel like you absolutely have, like, you know, put up a profile,

358
00:25:46,903 --> 00:25:52,968
but do not feel that this is, you know, needs to be, or indeed should be, the backbone of your telecommuting career.

359
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:56,187
Perfect, thank you.

360
00:25:56,207 --> 00:26:01,771
Our next question here is, how does one structure their day

361
00:26:01,891 --> 00:26:05,153
so that they actually get work done as a telecommuter?

362
00:26:06,614 --> 00:26:07,115
Big one.

363
00:26:09,345 --> 00:26:14,291
Well, I am unusual among a lot of the telecommuters I know,

364
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:17,294
in that I actually do try to structure my day a little bit

365
00:26:17,374 --> 00:26:19,837
like a day in the office, like a nine to five.

366
00:26:20,598 --> 00:26:22,720
Although I've recently shifted from 10 to six,

367
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:24,683
because it just seems to work a bit better

368
00:26:24,743 --> 00:26:27,306
with my sort of mental cycle.

369
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:39,342
That can be difficult to do when you are dealing, of course, with international clients that are in a different time zone.

370
00:26:39,802 --> 00:26:46,704
And in fact, one of my clients in China has asked me recently to like, you know,

371
00:26:46,744 --> 00:26:53,646
could you start work a little bit later and then, you know, stick around a bit in the evening when we're all getting into the office.

372
00:26:55,447 --> 00:27:04,252
So I think it's a delicate balance between what are the prime times that you would like to work

373
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:08,955
versus what are the prime times that your clients would like you to work.

374
00:27:09,155 --> 00:27:15,379
And sometimes it is completely fine to, like, in fact, encouraged to come down on your side and say,

375
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:16,819
yes, I finish work at 6.

376
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,203
You know, that is when I will hand in my work for the day and then I'm done.

377
00:27:23,263 --> 00:27:25,804
But in other cases, you may want to be a bit more flexible.

378
00:27:27,244 --> 00:27:32,786
In terms of other structure, as I said, I just mostly remember, you know, like 9 to 5 is my work time.

379
00:27:32,806 --> 00:27:35,227
I, you know, take a little bit of time for lunch.

380
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:40,589
Because of the nature of writing, I will sometimes stand up and wander around my apartment with a coffee cup.

381
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:44,751
Contemplating existence and, you know, the nature of writing.

382
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:46,152
And then I go back to work.

383
00:27:46,312 --> 00:27:51,415
So, I do struggle with distraction, I'll be honest.

384
00:27:51,595 --> 00:27:55,957
And what I do is I've downloaded a whole bunch of apps that stop me from checking my phone

385
00:27:56,017 --> 00:27:57,558
and stop me from checking Facebook.

386
00:27:57,918 --> 00:28:03,321
So, I highly recommend Forest if you're looking for, you know, fun little apps that sort of, you know,

387
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:07,443
make you at least have to think about what you're doing online or on your phone.

388
00:28:09,024 --> 00:28:13,286
And yeah, so that's how I keep that's how I manage to pretend like I'm working all day

389
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:16,647
So if Michelle is the structured one

390
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:20,109
I would be the opposite of that

391
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:24,450
I'm somebody who has always been something of a night owl

392
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:29,693
It's like my most creative and best time ends up usually being in the middle of the night

393
00:28:30,713 --> 00:28:36,316
So I had to have a conversation with my supervisor pretty early on about deadlines.

394
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:40,517
It's like when you say something is due by Monday, what time on Monday?

395
00:28:40,537 --> 00:28:48,301
Right? And as soon as I understood that the deadline on Monday is when she clocks in at 8 o'clock on Monday,

396
00:28:48,701 --> 00:28:53,163
well, that's awesome. That means that I can be up till like 3 or 4 a.m. due. And when I do,

397
00:28:54,444 --> 00:28:58,407
I love working at night because nobody else is awake.

398
00:28:58,548 --> 00:29:00,049
It's impossible to get bothered.

399
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:03,251
It's like your phone isn't going to be going off

400
00:29:03,612 --> 00:29:04,913
and your Facebook isn't going to be going off

401
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:07,295
because everybody else is asleep, right?

402
00:29:07,655 --> 00:29:08,296
It's awesome.

403
00:29:08,756 --> 00:29:13,198
It's just I'll sit there and I'll have my headphones on and my music on and I'm just like cranking.

404
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,880
And it's the middle of the night. I know that's not for everybody, but that's kind of what I do.

405
00:29:17,321 --> 00:29:25,305
So it's like I'll wake up around 11 and I'll get through all my social media, check emails and all that other stuff,

406
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:28,307
see if my boss has left me anything that I need to answer right away.

407
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:34,150
Then I'll go have lunch, I'll talk to my kids, and then take a nap.

408
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,591
Then I'll get up from taking a nap.

409
00:29:37,472 --> 00:29:46,376
And just kind of, I think I'll get maybe three hours in the evening in before there's like dinner time and stuff like that

410
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:52,579
and then I'll like really get cranking at about nine o'clock at night and I'll go from like nine to about two or three.

411
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:56,381
And that's, seems to be what's the most natural for me.

412
00:29:57,762 --> 00:30:01,564
I realize it's unorthodox but I'm an unorthodox chick.

413
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:06,732
I actually found myself having a really tough transition

414
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:11,399
from a very structured work environment where I worked in an office

415
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,924
where I had to be there every day at a certain time and people held me

416
00:30:14,944 --> 00:30:15,766
accountable if I

417
00:30:16,226 --> 00:30:19,331
you know came in not wearing pants or something like that and

418
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:25,215
to a much more dynamic and loose work environment,

419
00:30:25,335 --> 00:30:26,515
telecommuting and freelancing,

420
00:30:27,015 --> 00:30:29,576
where the only person who is holding me accountable is me.

421
00:30:30,236 --> 00:30:32,257
And that was actually very tough for me.

422
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:35,857
And it's something that I recommend people take a good hard look at

423
00:30:35,897 --> 00:30:39,078
when they want to transition to a telecommuting remote work environment,

424
00:30:39,198 --> 00:30:43,359
is that, are you the type of person that either would be fine

425
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:45,819
with sort of a self-imposed structure,

426
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:47,160
or could be...

427
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,032
could create a structure for themself.

428
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:55,094
So I had to impose very strict, like, this

429
00:30:55,174 --> 00:30:56,915
is when I start work, and this is when I end work,

430
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,035
and this is when my lunch is.

431
00:30:58,115 --> 00:31:00,896
And basically, I had to recreate that office environment

432
00:31:00,936 --> 00:31:06,558
for myself, or else I'd end up playing video games accidentally

433
00:31:06,618 --> 00:31:09,219
and lose five hours, or whatever it

434
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,040
is that will suck my time away, because there's

435
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,840
no one watching me.

436
00:31:15,328 --> 00:31:18,769
I have to actively create an environment where that wasn't possible.

437
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,810
And I've gotten much better at it.

438
00:31:22,731 --> 00:31:27,272
And with the time zone thing, my client in Australia,

439
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:33,055
there's times when they're getting into the office at their 9am and it's 5pm for me.

440
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:39,737
So I had to have a long series of conversations about what the expectations were.

441
00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:45,627
They're expectations for me and my expectations for them about communication and being online at the same time because

442
00:31:46,677 --> 00:31:51,278
There just wasn't, like I wasn't going to be able to stay up until 3am like some folks.

443
00:31:51,818 --> 00:31:53,078
I just wouldn't be working at that point.

444
00:31:53,238 --> 00:31:55,738
It would just be being available for the sake of being available.

445
00:31:57,219 --> 00:32:01,660
So, communicating and setting hard deadlines or hard stop points for yourself

446
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:08,221
and being precious with those hard stop points has actually been very useful for me.

447
00:32:08,581 --> 00:32:10,982
So they know, you know, once at a certain time,

448
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:13,922
they know to ask the questions between 9 and...

449
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:15,950
one to me.

450
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,832
After that, I'm sleeping.

451
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:21,656
I am also one of those unstructured night owls.

452
00:32:22,777 --> 00:32:26,420
I go to bed around five or six in the morning, and I

453
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,782
wake up around 1 or 2 in the afternoon.

454
00:32:29,863 --> 00:32:32,926
that's not a given either based on how awake I

455
00:32:33,106 --> 00:32:36,950
am in the early morning or how sleepy I am and I

456
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,511
decide I'm just not going to get up.

457
00:32:39,252 --> 00:32:47,439
But I have found that I tend to divide my day into stuff for other people and stuff for me.

458
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:51,162
Like Heidi said, everybody's asleep at night.

459
00:32:51,822 --> 00:32:57,607
I tend to work on my own things at night and I'm able to focus better on my own things at night.

460
00:32:58,067 --> 00:33:03,172
I also edit at night because, oddly enough, I find editing very therapeutic.

461
00:33:03,972 --> 00:33:05,914
And so I edit throughout the day.

462
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:09,858
I tend to do things for clients during the day.

463
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:13,722
And basically I don't have like an organized schedule.

464
00:33:14,302 --> 00:33:18,166
I figure out with my client when I need to turn things in.

465
00:33:19,107 --> 00:33:24,009
I tend to have two, three weeks before I need to turn something in.

466
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:29,571
I know how long a particular project is going to take me.

467
00:33:29,611 --> 00:33:34,212
If I have to write a particular document, I know how long it's going to take, so I can

468
00:33:34,672 --> 00:33:37,613
figure out day to day if I want to work on that or not.

469
00:33:38,214 --> 00:33:43,635
So I think if you are used to being in an office and you've had structure before

470
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:47,295
and you've had a supervisor telling you I need this by X time,

471
00:33:47,956 --> 00:33:53,157
one thing you really need to figure out is how long does it take me to do a certain task?

472
00:33:53,777 --> 00:33:57,578
And so when you are off by your own with no supervision,

473
00:33:58,518 --> 00:34:01,318
you're going to know how you're going to be able to schedule your time.

474
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:05,720
And Toyo brings up a good point, which is that there are different types of relationships

475
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,961
with your employer when you're doing remote telecommuting.

476
00:34:09,161 --> 00:34:14,544
So if you're on a milestone base where there's a deadline for your work that needs to be turned in,

477
00:34:14,644 --> 00:34:21,326
as opposed to with my work with PlayCorp, it was sort of a daily...

478
00:34:23,617 --> 00:34:26,782
check in and a daily collaborative environment.

479
00:34:27,944 --> 00:34:32,571
And so the type of relationship affects

480
00:34:32,591 --> 00:34:33,452
how you structure your day.

481
00:34:34,554 --> 00:34:37,538
So that if you don't, it sounds like if you.

482
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,401
if you don't need to be available to them at all times,

483
00:34:41,762 --> 00:34:43,342
then you can have a little more flexibility

484
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,903
with your own personal time or the way you structure your day.

485
00:34:45,924 --> 00:34:48,445
Whereas if you are somebody who is telecommuting

486
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:51,926
and your time zones basically align

487
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:54,568
the same as the client or the employer,

488
00:34:55,308 --> 00:34:56,729
you might be expected to be on Slack

489
00:34:57,029 --> 00:35:01,011
or any other proprietary chat services all the time

490
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:02,211
so you can answer questions like that.

491
00:35:02,251 --> 00:35:05,353
So again, it's about negotiating with your employer,

492
00:35:05,413 --> 00:35:06,873
negotiating with your client to figure out.

493
00:35:07,825 --> 00:35:11,206
What works best, but knowing what works best for you at the same time.

494
00:35:11,646 --> 00:35:14,627
Yeah, I went from working 9-5 office,

495
00:35:15,228 --> 00:35:19,909
and then going to the games industry, which was studio culture, which was totally different.

496
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,871
And then I went from studio culture to working remotely.

497
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:26,312
So I've done all three things at this point.

498
00:35:27,132 --> 00:35:31,814
And the one thing that I found the hardest when switching over to remote work

499
00:35:31,914 --> 00:35:33,934
was getting used to asking questions.

500
00:35:34,735 --> 00:35:41,197
It's like I am not somebody who will inherently always ask a whole lot of questions about what I'm supposed to be doing,

501
00:35:41,637 --> 00:35:46,879
but it is necessary to do when you're working remotely, even if you think it's obvious, it might not be.

502
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,001
And so I'll proceed my question with something like,

503
00:35:50,021 --> 00:35:52,902
this is probably a stupid question, but I just want to be clear.

504
00:35:53,262 --> 00:35:59,764
And it's like asking tons of those little questions to make sure that you understand what it is that they want you to do,

505
00:36:00,965 --> 00:36:03,326
or that they understood what you were telling them.

506
00:36:03,806 --> 00:36:07,408
And that becomes especially true if there's a language barrier.

507
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:14,453
But yes, you will become friendly with asking questions.

508
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:21,946
And of course something to realize on that level is, because I'm sort of, I've had the opposite problem.

509
00:36:21,966 --> 00:36:28,971
I'm always asking questions and then realizing, oh wait, my clients are at, you know, are in bed at prime

510
00:36:28,991 --> 00:36:38,898
I need to ask this question time. How do I manage that? And so it has been like, ideally, yes, you get this all laid out at the very beginning.

511
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:42,922
But don't blame yourself if it's also a work in progress,

512
00:36:42,962 --> 00:36:45,705
that if you start it and you figure after a while,

513
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:49,148
like, no, I actually do need more direct feedback.

514
00:36:49,188 --> 00:36:50,530
I need to be able to ask questions

515
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,811
and get them answered right away.

516
00:36:51,831 --> 00:36:53,252
Talk to your client about.

517
00:36:55,675 --> 00:37:00,680
you know, how to get that working, you know, think about how you can maybe rearrange your schedule.

518
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:05,465
Something else to consider that I think a lot of people maybe don't consider, and that is

519
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:10,210
it's not only just about your structure, it's about the structure of your client.

520
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:18,218
We tend to assume that the clients we have are all, you know, 9 to 5, like, office hours in whatever their time zone is.

521
00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:24,685
You may be working with an indie who's like working out of their bedroom or their basement

522
00:37:25,185 --> 00:37:29,270
and they will be keeping very, very unusual hours as well.

523
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:33,914
So my current situation is I have two clients, one that's in China

524
00:37:34,155 --> 00:37:36,918
and that has involved me shifting my schedule around.

525
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:43,940
to match, you know, they're a full office, they're, you know, nine, like, ten to seven Beijing time,

526
00:37:44,321 --> 00:37:45,981
and so I have to adjust to that.

527
00:37:46,301 --> 00:37:50,503
But then my other client is an Indie in Hungary, and he stays up till two in the morning.

528
00:37:51,743 --> 00:37:56,125
So he, like, it's actually really easy to get hold of him during my workday.

529
00:37:56,465 --> 00:38:02,468
So that's something to consider when you're looking at clients, that the type of client you work with

530
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,755
may affect the sort of schedule they have.

531
00:38:05,815 --> 00:38:09,544
So don't jump to assumptions of everything has to be on their 9-5.

532
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,248
It could be on your 9-5.

533
00:38:13,377 --> 00:38:18,538
And I'll jump in and say that I work best from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.

534
00:38:18,638 --> 00:38:24,199
So in there with a couple folks up here and that is actually that's part of the criteria

535
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,060
I think about when I am seeking out clients, folks who are at least like eight hours

536
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:32,682
ahead of me, so that can help you narrow down if again wondering where to start.

537
00:38:34,382 --> 00:38:36,423
Also as far as how do I get to work?

538
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:42,728
I personally find it helpful to do kind of a centering activity that's relevant to me.

539
00:38:42,768 --> 00:38:48,153
That could be a spiritual, religious thing, or something as simple as doing power poses even.

540
00:38:48,753 --> 00:38:51,476
So again, if you're just kind of looking for something to jump start, you know,

541
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:54,459
when you're in your home, but know you need to do work.

542
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:01,464
And a separate that I'll just add to that too is increasingly there are shared workspaces available out there

543
00:39:02,145 --> 00:39:03,866
for telecommuters and freelancers.

544
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:09,611
I'm pretty sure San Francisco has a bunch of them. I feel like I've seen a few, Seattle, Austin,

545
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:16,797
and that's the sort of thing where you can rent out like a little cubicle typically for a certain amount of time or

546
00:39:16,877 --> 00:39:18,358
potentially for weeks at a time.

547
00:39:19,118 --> 00:39:24,461
I was just going to add to that, changing your setting once a week may also help.

548
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:25,441
I do that as well.

549
00:39:26,762 --> 00:39:33,424
One day a week, around 2pm, I go to my favorite little pizza spot where I can go to the booth

550
00:39:33,464 --> 00:39:33,965
in the back.

551
00:39:34,725 --> 00:39:35,325
And I know...

552
00:39:36,094 --> 00:39:41,619
I am getting work done today, and I sit there from around 2 p.m. to 10 p.m.

553
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,724
And so I know I'm going to be focused today, I am leaving my house,

554
00:39:47,305 --> 00:39:50,068
I am not going to have the distractions that I usually have.

555
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,823
I do a similar thing with, you know, the stereotypical cafe.

556
00:39:54,863 --> 00:39:56,964
I'll sit in a cafe in the corner and do my work.

557
00:39:58,765 --> 00:40:01,867
I always recommend people who do stuff like that to maintain a really good relationship

558
00:40:01,907 --> 00:40:06,709
with the staff there because they get to know you and you don't want to be that jerk that

559
00:40:06,749 --> 00:40:10,170
is always coming in and not tipping and just sitting at the table and, you know, taking

560
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:10,551
up space.

561
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:13,572
If you have a spot, be kind to those people.

562
00:40:14,532 --> 00:40:15,413
You want them to like you.

563
00:40:17,573 --> 00:40:25,295
Something else to consider, you know, obviously we've been talking about how to deal with distractions and how to resist distractions, and that is very important,

564
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:35,698
but I also think that, you know, to a certain extent, we tend to think of distraction as like, you know, a pure enemy, that there is nothing good about distraction,

565
00:40:35,738 --> 00:40:45,220
but sometimes a short and managed distraction is kind of what you need to sort of reset your mind space and get, like, that burst of energy.

566
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,202
That's why I've been actually experimenting recently with the Pomodoro technique,

567
00:40:50,222 --> 00:40:53,864
which is very much kind of like you set a timer, you work for 25 minutes,

568
00:40:53,924 --> 00:40:58,307
and then you have five minutes of free time that you can do something else.

569
00:40:58,387 --> 00:41:01,909
And I find that that actually helps when it's, you know, after the five minutes,

570
00:41:01,949 --> 00:41:06,111
I'm like, okay, even though I wasn't directly thinking about what I had to write,

571
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:08,872
it's helped reset my mind space a bit.

572
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:12,595
Now obviously, some of you may find that you need to get into a flow state,

573
00:41:12,615 --> 00:41:13,635
you need to not stop.

574
00:41:14,135 --> 00:41:16,697
But I suppose my recommendation would be,

575
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:21,021
if you find that there are types of short, short,

576
00:41:21,401 --> 00:41:26,085
distractions in your day that can help you get back to work,

577
00:41:26,145 --> 00:41:27,566
help you keep your energy up,

578
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:31,069
then don't beat yourself up for,

579
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,911
quote unquote, succumbing to them.

580
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:36,854
As long as you get your work done by the deadline,

581
00:41:37,755 --> 00:41:38,676
do what you have to do.

582
00:41:40,055 --> 00:41:49,702
And if it is physically possible for you, and you're not in a flow state, get up and walk around like every 25, 20-25 minutes.

583
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:54,385
Because sitting in front of a laptop, even if you can't sense it, is incredibly draining.

584
00:41:54,905 --> 00:42:00,549
And also just because you're working, you're putting a lot of physical and emotional and mental effort into what you're doing.

585
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:05,553
And so, you know, getting up or moving around recharges your batteries. It's really important.

586
00:42:06,766 --> 00:42:07,969
All right, thanks so much.

587
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,959
Our next question is, what are some technological hurdles

588
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:14,165
to telecommuting, and what are your suggestions

589
00:42:14,205 --> 00:42:15,007
for resolving them?

590
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:22,052
Just have the help desk information.

591
00:42:22,092 --> 00:42:24,473
Like if it's a help desk you're supposed to talk to,

592
00:42:24,493 --> 00:42:26,874
if it's a person you're supposed to talk to,

593
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:29,135
have that information at the ready.

594
00:42:30,516 --> 00:42:33,197
I've run into a situation where one of the tools

595
00:42:33,457 --> 00:42:34,957
that I'm supposed to be working with

596
00:42:35,357 --> 00:42:38,799
is for whatever reason not working correctly on my laptop.

597
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:42,060
And so that means that until we get that situated,

598
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,141
I have to compose the game dialogue

599
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:46,882
directly into the code of the game.

600
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:52,900
And, you know, anyone who knows me knows that you probably don't want me in your code.

601
00:42:54,781 --> 00:43:03,606
Luckily, they gave me a longer deadline because they knew that it was like really hard to like try to parse out visually where I'm supposed to put things.

602
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:09,210
But that's just the kind of thing that can happen and you just kind of roll with it.

603
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:18,235
And I know when I get back from GDC, we're going to be doing a step-by-step, you know, figure out how to make the tool work on my computer thing.

604
00:43:18,775 --> 00:43:20,856
And if not, we've got the hacky way.

605
00:43:23,507 --> 00:43:26,830
This actually kind of dovetails nicely with what we were just talking about in terms of

606
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:34,077
these types of challenges, technological hurdles, are best overcome by communicating

607
00:43:34,497 --> 00:43:39,122
with your client or the employer as quickly as possible, as clearly as possible,

608
00:43:39,202 --> 00:43:42,605
giving them specific details about the problem that you're having or the question that you have.

609
00:43:43,386 --> 00:43:49,928
And if you've established a communication pipeline that's been working, it should be pretty straightforward to resolve these problems.

610
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:54,269
But it's about, up front, knowing that you need to establish a communication pipeline.

611
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:58,991
Who you need to talk to, who's in charge of making this decision or resolving the problem.

612
00:44:00,232 --> 00:44:03,633
And not having it be, oh, you gotta go talk to Joe, he's the so-and-so person.

613
00:44:03,913 --> 00:44:05,133
Oh, no, actually you need to talk to...

614
00:44:05,673 --> 00:44:08,274
Jane, she's the person that handles questions from people.

615
00:44:08,294 --> 00:44:11,556
Keeping your supervisor in the loop as well all the time.

616
00:44:11,576 --> 00:44:16,860
So like having a point of contact, a specific point of contact, if possible, with a department

617
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:22,963
is really important so that you always have a, yeah, you know exactly who you need to

618
00:44:23,003 --> 00:44:23,263
go to.

619
00:44:24,149 --> 00:44:31,770
A couple of points. The communication pipeline is very important, something that I have a really difficult time with.

620
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:44,053
I'm working with devs who like to make major decisions in Skype chats, and there can be 50 posts, 50 messages in Skype.

621
00:44:45,093 --> 00:44:49,234
And there have been times where a major change was implemented.

622
00:44:50,094 --> 00:44:57,641
And a couple of us didn't know, because it happened in Skype like two days ago, 50 messages away.

623
00:44:58,402 --> 00:45:03,726
And it was like three weeks later when we found out there was a major implementation change.

624
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:06,469
And so there needs to be one place.

625
00:45:09,912 --> 00:45:12,313
where all of the documentation is,

626
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:15,794
and everybody needs to decide where that place is,

627
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:17,075
and to make sure,

628
00:45:17,095 --> 00:45:19,916
hey, have there been changes made?

629
00:45:20,356 --> 00:45:23,557
Please keep those changes in the documentation

630
00:45:24,258 --> 00:45:27,039
so that I'm working with the most recent information.

631
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:31,020
And that's just important, not just for you, so you're not frustrated,

632
00:45:31,721 --> 00:45:35,022
but if people don't have that information, that can set the project back.

633
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:40,446
The other thing is, if you are in a subcontracting position,

634
00:45:40,626 --> 00:45:43,688
in other words, there is a contractor that's working with a client,

635
00:45:44,188 --> 00:45:48,091
and then they find you and you are actually working for the contractor,

636
00:45:48,691 --> 00:45:54,235
make sure you are also in communication with the person who is going to be approving your work.

637
00:45:54,936 --> 00:45:57,318
Because that's going to be the contractor's client.

638
00:45:57,878 --> 00:46:01,741
I was in a position where I had no communication with the client.

639
00:46:02,461 --> 00:46:05,123
And I was trying to do my work.

640
00:46:05,844 --> 00:46:07,665
I was asking lots of questions.

641
00:46:08,326 --> 00:46:12,869
The contractor was trying to do his best to get the answer to those questions, and he couldn't.

642
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:18,933
And that was probably very, very early in my career where I did not know to say,

643
00:46:18,954 --> 00:46:24,658
hey, I also need the email address or the phone number of the client so I can contact them directly.

644
00:46:28,443 --> 00:46:33,265
I'll actually say one of the technical issues that I've had has been, of course,

645
00:46:33,305 --> 00:46:37,026
like one of the things that, you know, is supposed to help, particularly for writers,

646
00:46:37,306 --> 00:46:44,508
is prototyping and, you know, putting the text into, say, Unity and, you know, seeing how it plays out.

647
00:46:45,649 --> 00:46:55,974
I have not had the greatest luck at having, at trying to organize with clients to set up my system so that I can actually do that myself.

648
00:46:56,054 --> 00:47:02,318
So what, you know, tends to happen is I, you know, send off my text to China and they do the prototyping on their end.

649
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:06,979
I get a video of it, but I don't get to actually do it myself.

650
00:47:07,279 --> 00:47:08,920
And I've asked them multiple times,

651
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,420
hey, could we put Unity on my, you know,

652
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,921
could we get Unity set up so that I can do this too?

653
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:16,762
And they're like, we have other things to do.

654
00:47:17,382 --> 00:47:18,682
We can't really do that right now.

655
00:47:19,783 --> 00:47:21,503
So depending on your discipline, you

656
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:26,305
may end up being a little siloed off from things that way.

657
00:47:27,546 --> 00:47:33,491
At which point you just sort of have to communicate with the client and work with what you can do.

658
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:41,979
So like, hence, you know, I said, okay, well, if you, you know, if I can't actually see what these scenes look like myself, can someone make videos for me?

659
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:43,200
Oh yeah, sure, we can do that.

660
00:47:44,881 --> 00:47:49,605
So it's something to consider that maybe early on the process, if you get the chance,

661
00:47:51,186 --> 00:47:57,792
make sure that you're onboarded with the tools that you can actually prototype and see the game

662
00:47:57,832 --> 00:47:59,873
and see the scenes and see the things that you're doing,

663
00:48:00,534 --> 00:48:05,378
because otherwise you basically have to send it off into the ether,

664
00:48:05,538 --> 00:48:07,159
and then eventually someone comes back and says,

665
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,862
we put it all on Unity and it sucks, go do it again.

666
00:48:09,902 --> 00:48:13,605
And you're just like, I could have figured that out earlier if I could have put it in Unity.

667
00:48:14,565 --> 00:48:16,506
So I think that's something to consider.

668
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:20,488
Yeah, there's one thing that I could strongly request

669
00:48:20,668 --> 00:48:25,230
is, if you're a studio or a team that

670
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:28,431
wants to start bringing in outsiders,

671
00:48:28,451 --> 00:48:32,172
bringing in remote workers, establish an infrastructure

672
00:48:32,192 --> 00:48:33,293
to do so before that.

673
00:48:33,373 --> 00:48:37,094
Because if that person can't hit the ground running,

674
00:48:37,134 --> 00:48:38,515
you're wasting money on them, basically.

675
00:48:38,575 --> 00:48:39,735
Like, you're wasting money on.

676
00:48:42,056 --> 00:48:44,577
doing this sort of loop of, oh, actually, I need a VPN

677
00:48:44,597 --> 00:48:47,239
so I can go and access the Git repository.

678
00:48:47,259 --> 00:48:49,540
Or like, oh, and then you have to set that up,

679
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,300
and then you tell them.

680
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,762
And then there's this whole lag time between request

681
00:48:53,962 --> 00:48:56,904
and implementation that is just a waste of time and money.

682
00:48:56,964 --> 00:49:00,665
So set up the tools that you need beforehand,

683
00:49:00,685 --> 00:49:01,966
before engaging folks.

684
00:49:02,887 --> 00:49:03,527
And that includes.

685
00:49:04,147 --> 00:49:08,629
Yeah, VPN, email, documentation access, things like that that you don't

686
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,550
necessarily think about because they're all in the same office on the same

687
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:13,992
network, but as soon as you start introducing people from the outside

688
00:49:14,032 --> 00:49:19,635
into that process, it becomes a weird tangle of problems. On the flip side of

689
00:49:19,675 --> 00:49:24,878
that, if you're somebody who is looking for remote work, once you

690
00:49:24,898 --> 00:49:28,679
pass the conversations about what the job is and the sort of introductory

691
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:32,401
stuff, it would probably be good to ask if they've worked with remote people

692
00:49:32,441 --> 00:49:32,741
before.

693
00:49:33,298 --> 00:49:38,411
so that you know they might have an infrastructure in place to make your job easier.

694
00:49:39,295 --> 00:49:42,837
Also on the stuff everybody doesn't think about,

695
00:49:43,577 --> 00:49:46,218
who is going to get you paid?

696
00:49:46,238 --> 00:49:49,400
I have this really funny story about how

697
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,122
it took me a year and a half to get paid on a project.

698
00:49:52,482 --> 00:49:55,263
And it wasn't because the client was trying not to pay me.

699
00:49:55,884 --> 00:49:58,105
It was because I was working with a producer who

700
00:49:58,145 --> 00:49:59,305
doesn't have to deal with that.

701
00:49:59,505 --> 00:50:02,267
And again, it was early career ignorance for me.

702
00:50:02,287 --> 00:50:04,588
I didn't ask anything about that.

703
00:50:05,949 --> 00:50:07,430
And so long story short.

704
00:50:09,191 --> 00:50:15,475
I went through two producers in a year and a half, and finally the second producer, because the first producer moved to another project, said,

705
00:50:16,376 --> 00:50:23,141
Oh, we just need your checking account information, and there's one person in this department who will get it done for you.

706
00:50:25,926 --> 00:50:29,309
I mean that is, getting paid is a technological hurdle in a lot of cases.

707
00:50:29,429 --> 00:50:35,856
Like that is, it is weirdly difficult still to transfer money from one person to another in 2019.

708
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:40,782
We actually only have a few minutes left so I'm gonna push us just a few more quick questions.

709
00:50:42,722 --> 00:50:45,325
Yeah, speaking to that, how do you prefer to be paid?

710
00:50:45,345 --> 00:50:47,989
And just a quick answer.

711
00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:51,654
So quick for me, I open a separate bank account at my bank

712
00:50:51,774 --> 00:50:54,017
and have my clients wire transfer in.

713
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:56,701
There's sometimes a fee, and that's something

714
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,423
you talk about up front for them to cover it.

715
00:51:00,103 --> 00:51:05,005
I admit I'm lazy, I have them transfer the money, use money transfer directly into my

716
00:51:05,045 --> 00:51:10,528
main account, of which there is a minor fee, but not that bad of one.

717
00:51:11,088 --> 00:51:16,150
I also do actually use PayPal, but rather than paying to get the PayPal money put into

718
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:21,313
my account, I actually keep it on my PayPal account and then use the PayPal to pay for

719
00:51:22,573 --> 00:51:24,174
business expenses and things like that.

720
00:51:25,655 --> 00:51:26,855
I just get it wired to me.

721
00:51:28,563 --> 00:51:32,768
I've added Wired to me. I also use a site called TransferWise, which makes cross-currency

722
00:51:34,149 --> 00:51:37,674
monetary transfers pretty easy, straightforward. That's been successful for me in the past.

723
00:51:38,755 --> 00:51:46,124
Wired, PayPal or if it's a client within the United States, via check because I'm not charged a fee.

724
00:51:47,322 --> 00:51:47,922
And great.

725
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:50,483
Quick question too, have you had any,

726
00:51:50,864 --> 00:51:55,846
we are not legally able to give you legal advice about this,

727
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:59,687
but mention just really quickly if you've had any concerns

728
00:51:59,807 --> 00:52:03,108
or special situations with taxes or visas,

729
00:52:03,528 --> 00:52:06,490
working with clients outside of your home country.

730
00:52:08,075 --> 00:52:11,557
Well, that's actually, it was something I realized I should have brought up about the, you know,

731
00:52:11,637 --> 00:52:16,119
tele, you know, is telecommuting possible? And frankly, if you are non-American,

732
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:21,801
telecommuting is not only, like, doable, it may be, like, potentially one of your only options,

733
00:52:21,861 --> 00:52:28,303
because I've had so many American clients who were originally looking to hire me as a full-time employee,

734
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:31,425
the minute they hear the word Canadian, they're like, oh.

735
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:40,691
Can you do remote work? So, yes, doing remote work can definitely help with the visa issue because you don't have to negotiate the visa.

736
00:52:41,051 --> 00:52:47,936
On the other hand, you do have to negotiate your country's tax laws, so please familiarize yourself with them,

737
00:52:48,516 --> 00:52:55,161
particularly which countries your country has trade agreements and...

738
00:52:56,483 --> 00:52:59,789
Tax agreements with so so that you don't end up paying both

739
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:03,656
You know America and Canada a share of your taxes

740
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,105
I've never been paid by a foreign country, so I don't know

741
00:53:09,732 --> 00:53:15,374
So occasionally when you do remote work for international clients, they will ask you to come to a studio visit.

742
00:53:16,975 --> 00:53:19,356
And depending on the country that you'll be headed towards,

743
00:53:20,237 --> 00:53:24,639
as an American, we have some countries that I can just kind of show up at and it's no problem, I don't need a visa.

744
00:53:25,339 --> 00:53:28,441
Other countries, you do need a visa and they're very particular about their visas.

745
00:53:29,181 --> 00:53:29,381
And the...

746
00:53:30,766 --> 00:53:37,730
Do not leave visa stuff to the last minute, or if you get a bad feeling that your client isn't handling the visa stuff properly,

747
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,953
don't be afraid to slow things down and get it done properly.

748
00:53:43,373 --> 00:53:51,858
Because occasionally, as you are going back into that country, you'll be sent into a detention center and then deported, as I was.

749
00:53:52,758 --> 00:53:56,740
He got kicked out of Australia, you guys.

750
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:01,251
Yeah, it's true.

751
00:54:02,591 --> 00:54:04,452
But that's because the visa situation

752
00:54:05,352 --> 00:54:08,273
is more complicated than just buying one online

753
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:10,294
or just trusting that your client will take care of it

754
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:10,654
for you.

755
00:54:11,655 --> 00:54:15,096
So be very careful with that sort of thing,

756
00:54:15,316 --> 00:54:16,537
even if it seems like it's straightforward.

757
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:24,384
I have never been kicked out of Australia or anywhere else, and I haven't had a real problem except for that year and a half thing getting paid.

758
00:54:24,404 --> 00:54:30,466
I have a single member LLC, so my contracts are with my LLC.

759
00:54:31,027 --> 00:54:37,590
Again, if you want to get your own business, find out which one is right for you.

760
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:41,351
You know, in the United States we have LLCs, we have C-corporations, that sort of thing.

761
00:54:42,192 --> 00:54:45,093
Find out what kind of businesses you have in your own country and then talk

762
00:54:45,213 --> 00:54:49,414
to a lawyer about what's the most beneficial for you tax-wise.

763
00:54:50,775 --> 00:54:55,656
Thanks so much. Final question, we're at the end here. What's one thing you wish

764
00:54:55,676 --> 00:55:00,278
you'd known before you started telecommuting? And my quick answer is I

765
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:03,879
wish I'd known to just experiment with schedule styles for myself. I used to

766
00:55:03,919 --> 00:55:08,120
think like, oh I love things totally open and free, but I actually thrive on having

767
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,021
a production schedule for myself.

768
00:55:13,652 --> 00:55:21,522
I guess I wish I'd known how much more challenging it is going to be to connect with your team when you're working,

769
00:55:23,325 --> 00:55:26,529
particularly when they are not English speakers.

770
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:30,213
So it's something that for me is still a work in progress,

771
00:55:31,034 --> 00:55:34,198
but it is something to be aware of, but that you can overcome it,

772
00:55:34,238 --> 00:55:37,782
that you can, you know, take the effort to connect with your team

773
00:55:37,962 --> 00:55:41,687
and be sort of part of the loop as opposed to that random person

774
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:45,992
off in some, you know, office, off in their bedroom somewhere.

775
00:55:47,248 --> 00:55:51,952
I wish I'd known how important it is that you're always hustling to find your next thing,

776
00:55:52,192 --> 00:55:56,516
even when you're working with all your heart on the thing that you're doing right now.

777
00:55:57,597 --> 00:56:01,800
So you have to get comfortable with promoting yourself, and I've not been somebody who's

778
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,122
typically been comfortable with that.

779
00:56:04,543 --> 00:56:09,026
But you start to get comfortable with that, and you have your website, and you have your

780
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:09,667
portfolio.

781
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:09,887
And you...

782
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:15,993
You realize that you really do need to kind of do that self-promotion so that people know to think of you

783
00:56:16,594 --> 00:56:19,416
when they need someone who does what you do.

784
00:56:20,698 --> 00:56:22,379
I wish I had known how to avoid detention centers.

785
00:56:24,421 --> 00:56:26,363
But more than that, I wish I had known

786
00:56:28,107 --> 00:56:30,589
I kind of knew intellectually, but I didn't know in practice

787
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:33,453
to get people who know about contracts

788
00:56:33,493 --> 00:56:35,375
to review your contracts, or at least in the beginning,

789
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:37,918
to actually look at contracts and the contract language.

790
00:56:38,899 --> 00:56:40,100
Just because you're a smart person

791
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,862
doesn't mean you understand the implications

792
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:42,563
of legal language.

793
00:56:43,504 --> 00:56:45,766
So getting a second set of eyes on contracts is a great idea.

794
00:56:46,324 --> 00:56:50,529
I wish I had understood how important that website portfolio was and that I had gotten

795
00:56:50,609 --> 00:56:56,717
one up a lot sooner because people were referred to me and then they found my website and contacted

796
00:56:56,757 --> 00:57:01,562
me that way, but then I've had people who were just looking for a game writer or a narrative

797
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:05,707
designer and my website was one of the hits they found.

798
00:57:07,494 --> 00:57:11,657
And one last quick thought, know what you're worth and ask for it.

799
00:57:12,377 --> 00:57:17,060
It can be very hard to do, especially when you're starting out. There are great resources within your discipline.

800
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:24,585
We're all writers up here, so the IGDA writing sake has a great primer on kind of where to start with setting your rates.

801
00:57:25,765 --> 00:57:28,687
But ask for it because they're not going to give it to you unless you do.

802
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:33,874
One last quick note about that. If you don't have something like a SIG that's got that,

803
00:57:34,434 --> 00:57:36,375
look for something that's industry adjacent.

804
00:57:36,455 --> 00:57:39,076
Like look up what professional programmers make.

805
00:57:39,897 --> 00:57:44,999
It doesn't have to be professional game programmers or professional game sound designers.

806
00:57:45,319 --> 00:57:48,621
Just what do they make in general. You can probably find that online somewhere.

807
00:57:49,941 --> 00:57:51,922
Perfect. Well, thank you so much to our panelists.

808
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:53,883
Thank you for attending with us today.

809
00:57:56,955 --> 00:58:02,501
I've put our contact information up here, so in some of our websites as well, so please

810
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:08,728
feel free to follow us on Twitter, get in touch there or on our websites, and we'd love

811
00:58:08,748 --> 00:58:09,388
to chat more with you.

812
00:58:09,448 --> 00:58:13,072
We're going to hang around a little bit just outside the Career Theater if you want to

813
00:58:13,092 --> 00:58:15,235
keep talking, and thank you so much.
