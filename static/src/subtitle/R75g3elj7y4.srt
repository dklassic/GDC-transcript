1
00:00:05,465 --> 00:00:05,906
Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:06,446 --> 00:00:06,986
Sorry about that.

3
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:09,787
So I'm Seth Marinello, as Corey said.

4
00:00:09,847 --> 00:00:12,489
This is my third year getting to speak at Level Design Day.

5
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:17,091
And I didn't necessarily intend on being the first presentation

6
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:19,292
when I came up with my title, but it seems

7
00:00:19,332 --> 00:00:20,573
to have worked out really well.

8
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:25,367
So today, we're going to be talking about a series of first steps.

9
00:00:25,788 --> 00:00:29,910
Specifically, we're going to be looking at strategies for sort of capturing your initial

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,593
design and coming up with something that you can take back to your team and turn into a

11
00:00:33,753 --> 00:00:34,693
great piece of content.

12
00:00:34,713 --> 00:00:38,336
So we're going to be looking at sort of like everything from conception through sort of

13
00:00:38,376 --> 00:00:42,098
the block worlding phase where I would say, all right, we've got a design, we've got something

14
00:00:42,118 --> 00:00:43,139
that we can move forward with.

15
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:51,049
And now the idea for this presentation came from when we started doing the book project.

16
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,730
I went back and started looking through our previous slides and looking at some of the

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,491
stuff that I did in 2012.

18
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:57,791
And I saw this slide in there.

19
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:02,053
And you can see that, you know, my main thing I was talking about was this dominant feature.

20
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:04,213
Having a central theme or idea that...

21
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:07,655
ties all the details of your content together.

22
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:10,356
And I sort of said, well, you know, after you're done with that,

23
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:14,058
well, just block out the level around these objectives, right?

24
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:16,100
Just, because that's easy, right?

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,301
And I started realizing, you know,

26
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:20,642
I haven't talked about some of this stuff before.

27
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:23,003
Like, we just sort of skip over the beginning part,

28
00:01:23,043 --> 00:01:25,665
and we talk about these high-level concepts of how we make good content,

29
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:28,186
but how do you even get started building anything, right?

30
00:01:29,448 --> 00:01:33,535
anyone that's been involved in a creative process of whatever, you've dealt with this sort of blank

31
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:36,640
page syndrome where you have some days where you sit down and you're like, I know what I want to

32
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,985
build. This is going to be great, right? And you just, you just go. And those are the times when,

33
00:01:40,265 --> 00:01:43,751
you know, you don't need to follow some sort of crazy process. But there's the other days where

34
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:43,991
you're like...

35
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:49,434
You know, it'd be great if I could get anything on the screen, even if it's just some kind of like random boxes, right?

36
00:01:49,454 --> 00:01:52,355
I just want to get something up and feel like I've got some momentum.

37
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:58,957
So we're going to be specifically sort of looking at, you know, those days where you don't have forward motion of what you're trying to do.

38
00:02:00,277 --> 00:02:01,538
How do you get started, right?

39
00:02:02,258 --> 00:02:10,021
I think that if we're trying to create something and you're not sure how to begin, you need to define clearly what it is you're trying to build,

40
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:12,402
what's success going to look like and where are we trying to go.

41
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:18,537
specifically the first thing we want to look at is what's your primary constraint, right?

42
00:02:18,897 --> 00:02:22,299
If you're trying to build a single player game where we're making a dead space title or

43
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:22,800
something like that.

44
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,373
Ultimately, you're responsible for producing a certain amount of, you know, duration of the main

45
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:32,214
campaign, right? You need an hour worth of good content that's coming here. And this is sort of

46
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:35,796
the primary thing that's going to drive you forward. If you have a more narrative driven

47
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:38,877
game, it could be that it's like, we have two characters and we have to get them together and

48
00:02:39,197 --> 00:02:42,679
this is the main point of this. If it's 20 minutes, if it's a half an hour, it doesn't matter as

49
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:47,081
long as we deliver on this narrative moment. You're making a multiplayer map, it's like, you

50
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:50,883
have to have 64 players in this multiplayer map. And that's going to determine a lot of things

51
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:52,283
about the size of the space.

52
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:56,345
the number of capture points, and how much you can do with art, right?

53
00:02:56,565 --> 00:02:59,246
So there's always going to be kind of this short straw.

54
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,727
And that's the thing that's going to determine a lot of decisions you're going to make down the line.

55
00:03:02,887 --> 00:03:07,829
So if you can identify that up front, it helps build sort of this constraint box

56
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:11,430
that you can work within and then create from there.

57
00:03:13,344 --> 00:03:18,686
Another thing that you can do is look at what are the things that every level is going to have in

58
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:22,687
this game, right? If you're making a Mario level, a Doom level, a Dead Space level, whatever,

59
00:03:23,508 --> 00:03:27,489
you're going to probably have something like a start point, an end point, some enemies, some

60
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:31,831
pickups. Like what are the basic building blocks of your game that appear in 80% of all of your

61
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:35,112
levels? And you've got this, you're like, well, these are the things that have to be there,

62
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:38,173
right? So if I don't know other things, I can at least start figuring out, well, you know...

63
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:43,700
where I'm going to put my suit store or my upgrade bench or my kiosk, right? We have general

64
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,262
plans in our phase definitions that explicitly say like, hey has the LD sat down and thought

65
00:03:49,322 --> 00:03:54,424
about like walker locations, pickup locations and things that are paced out through, you know,

66
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:58,286
interspersed with the combat and the other events. So these are some of the things that I

67
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:03,088
just pulled out of some of our random documents for Dead Space 3. But this is stuff we've

68
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:04,008
explicitly listed out.

69
00:04:04,513 --> 00:04:05,994
And you don't have to do this every single time you're

70
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:06,574
building a level.

71
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:08,115
But the first time you're working on something

72
00:04:08,155 --> 00:04:10,875
on a project, it's good to have this written down.

73
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:13,316
These are the elements that I have to mix in along

74
00:04:13,356 --> 00:04:13,976
with everything else.

75
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:18,658
So once we've got this, we've kind of got a general idea

76
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:20,258
of what is it that I need to build.

77
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,419
But then how do I start building it?

78
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:26,360
Well, step one for building something

79
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,881
is to capture the intent or capture your design.

80
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:31,715
And what do I mean by this?

81
00:04:31,915 --> 00:04:34,156
I think that there are three main components

82
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:37,417
to delivering a design if we're talking about making

83
00:04:37,437 --> 00:04:39,437
like a single player level.

84
00:04:39,957 --> 00:04:42,038
You've got a concept, which is just

85
00:04:42,138 --> 00:04:43,759
this high level sort of x statement thing,

86
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,599
or your dominant feature, or whatever it's going to be.

87
00:04:46,179 --> 00:04:48,820
You've got a walkthrough, which is a description of what

88
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,680
you want to build.

89
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,361
And it doesn't have to literally be a walkthrough

90
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:54,042
if you're making a multiplayer map or something.

91
00:04:54,422 --> 00:04:56,702
But it's a plan of, well, what's the setting of the map?

92
00:04:57,022 --> 00:04:58,483
What are the different sort of points going to be?

93
00:04:58,543 --> 00:04:59,843
How is everything going to work together?

94
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:00,303
And.

95
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:04,662
what's the content going to really entail. And we'll go through each one of these sort of

96
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:10,385
images and finally there's a block world. All of this is the design and that's the

97
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:13,727
deliverable that we're trying to get to at the end of this. You want to have a thing that

98
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:16,769
you're like, I'm a level designer and I've produced this thing and this is what we're

99
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:20,952
going to go forward and build. It may not be the final design but it is a design and it's

100
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:25,575
the point from which you can launch forward. So going through each one of these

101
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:27,996
individually. Concept.

102
00:05:28,547 --> 00:05:35,162
This is, in some ways, the simplest because it's just like, well, this is the main idea or the main thread that I'm trying to take through it.

103
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:37,487
But it's also one of the hardest things to kind of walk down.

104
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:43,069
In my 2012 talk, I was talking almost exclusively about coming up with a central concept.

105
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:47,211
And I said, you know, sometimes you look at a level and you want to be able to say,

106
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:52,194
well this is the, you know, this is the underwater level, or this is the nighttime stealth level,

107
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:53,935
or this is like the at sea level.

108
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:57,877
Something that's the central element to the art and to the gameplay and to the story

109
00:05:57,917 --> 00:05:58,938
that's going to pull it all together.

110
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:04,441
An example that I wasn't able to use because we hadn't announced that we were doing Dead Space 3 at the time,

111
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:09,105
but was like sitting in the front of my mind, was a level I was working on called the Command Ship.

112
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:13,409
So I had this idea that it was, the whole idea was that you're awakening this sleeping ship.

113
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:19,574
This, the first time that anyone's been on this, this, this abandoned ship in 200 years, and everything in it...

114
00:06:19,854 --> 00:06:22,557
It was like all the handles you had to manually operate.

115
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:23,458
There was dust.

116
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:26,761
There's necromorphs that are sort of hanging in cocoons

117
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,243
that we hadn't done previously in the game.

118
00:06:29,704 --> 00:06:32,326
Just to sell this idea that there's kind of like this latent evil,

119
00:06:32,406 --> 00:06:35,689
and you're showing up and kind of like kicking it back to life, right?

120
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:39,753
And that culminates in your sort of final generator encounter

121
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:42,996
and all this stuff tied into this central idea.

122
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:48,141
And now, you know, this isn't something that just pops into your mind, though, out of nowhere.

123
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:52,845
Like, we had this whole sort of underlying thread of kind of Mountain of Madness Cthulhu stuff going on

124
00:06:53,186 --> 00:06:56,689
really early in Dead Space 3, so that's sort of where this idea evolved out of.

125
00:06:57,429 --> 00:07:01,113
But you can't just assume that you're going to come up with your concept out of the blue, right?

126
00:07:02,193 --> 00:07:05,858
You have to brainstorm, find references, talk to other people.

127
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,243
The amount of time that I spend just grabbing other designers and being like,

128
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:11,726
hey, so I need to talk to you about this thing.

129
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:14,770
And it's just like, what if we did blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?

130
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:16,433
And we'll throw a bunch of ideas up on a board.

131
00:07:17,214 --> 00:07:17,654
And I have.

132
00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:23,167
just folders and folders of random machines and things like that that I've found on Google

133
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:27,370
image search and Tumblr. I have no idea how people, I guess you just looked through books

134
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:34,094
or whatever and added little sticky notes to them in the olden days. But you have all

135
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:37,917
these things that are going to inspire you and you put together and you've been trying

136
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:42,901
to find threads that connect these different things that are exciting and from there your

137
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:45,242
concept can grow. I want to take it in this direction.

138
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:52,829
And then you sift through that stuff, and the stuff that really resonates with the concept that you're trying to make, you distill down into a walkthrough.

139
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:59,612
And, now, what form it takes, it is going to depend on what kind of content you're trying to make, what kind of game you're trying to build.

140
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:04,194
But I think that there's some core things that your walkthrough needs to answer, right?

141
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:08,856
You need to have, what are your major objectives? What are the major things that the player's doing?

142
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:10,276
What are the major beats?

143
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:14,238
So what kind of things are we highlighting in the level?

144
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:16,320
And these things are going to determine

145
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,581
the scope of the level.

146
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:20,943
You're going to get an idea of how many custom gameplay

147
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:21,963
scenarios do I need?

148
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:23,384
Do I need custom texture sets?

149
00:08:23,484 --> 00:08:23,885
Things like that.

150
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:25,826
This is the first time where we can start evaluating,

151
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:28,207
well, what is it that you're really asking to build?

152
00:08:29,448 --> 00:08:31,770
But it can be kind of hard to parse all this information out

153
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,672
of 20 pages of me rambling about all these scary corridors

154
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:36,373
and stuff like that.

155
00:08:36,793 --> 00:08:38,414
So it's really important to include.

156
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:41,807
a top-down map in your walkthrough of whatever you're trying to build.

157
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:46,390
Because this condenses this whole scope concept down into one thing that you can look at,

158
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,692
and it really captures the flow of the level.

159
00:08:48,912 --> 00:08:54,255
You can look at it with your eye and trace how the player is going to be moving through the space,

160
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:56,377
and even start to evaluate things like,

161
00:08:56,397 --> 00:09:01,960
well, maybe I need some more space in between this beat and that beat, right?

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,523
Like, am I actually asking for the right amount of rooms?

163
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:10,434
And this is all great, and you're really excited.

164
00:09:10,474 --> 00:09:11,655
And you're like, I've got this concept.

165
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:14,677
I've got this pile of fantastic reference.

166
00:09:14,738 --> 00:09:16,619
And they're checking it all into Perforce.

167
00:09:16,979 --> 00:09:20,242
And who's going to read it?

168
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:21,463
You're going to read it.

169
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:22,424
Your producer's going to read it.

170
00:09:22,444 --> 00:09:24,485
And you're going to high five all day about how awesome it is.

171
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:26,447
But half of the artists that are working on your level

172
00:09:26,547 --> 00:09:27,828
aren't necessarily going to see this.

173
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:30,450
So I think that one thing that is important

174
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,153
is once you feel like you've got some momentum behind what

175
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:34,633
you're building.

176
00:09:35,597 --> 00:09:40,662
is to take it, and we do these boards where we'll get some key art, some key images,

177
00:09:41,303 --> 00:09:45,848
we'll have a story summary, you know, the top-down map, and then because in Dead Space

178
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:48,871
we're really worried about the lighting and the tone as you're progressing through the level,

179
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:53,476
a color script of kind of like how we're going to make things so if we have a major state change,

180
00:09:53,556 --> 00:09:55,118
like in Command Ship where you turn on the power.

181
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:57,339
the second half is going to have a different feel.

182
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,980
And that's mentioned in your walkthrough,

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,901
and it's captured here so that you've got a 100 person team.

184
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:03,041
They can all look at it.

185
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:04,361
Now, if you're on a five person team,

186
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:06,182
it's easy for you to just sit down and talk

187
00:10:06,202 --> 00:10:07,062
about these things, right?

188
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:08,543
But if you've got someone that's building

189
00:10:08,563 --> 00:10:11,564
a desk for your admiral's quarters or something

190
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:14,045
like that, you want them to be able to kind of get

191
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:15,825
a general feel for what you're trying

192
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,426
to put forth as a designer, right?

193
00:10:17,446 --> 00:10:21,327
And at this point, we've got this pretty board.

194
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:21,987
We've got all this stuff.

195
00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:23,868
It's like, well, our design's done, right?

196
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:30,687
And it's interesting because I was talking to our lead level designer from Dead Space 3

197
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:32,929
about this presentation. I'm like, yeah, yeah.

198
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:37,433
And we had done this thing early on where we were like, we're going to plan out the whole game,

199
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:40,775
what the general high-level beats are, and we're going to write really short, you know,

200
00:10:40,795 --> 00:10:44,358
like a couple paragraph walkthroughs of what each level is going to contain,

201
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,620
and then gave them out to the designers.

202
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:50,003
And they would finish through the walkthrough and it would get approved.

203
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:52,167
And then they would start building the block world.

204
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:54,989
And the approved walkthrough that everyone had agreed,

205
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:56,030
yeah, this is what we're building,

206
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,212
would differ insanely from the block world that

207
00:10:59,232 --> 00:10:59,813
would come back.

208
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:02,935
And once we had the block world approved,

209
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:04,216
the level didn't change that much.

210
00:11:04,376 --> 00:11:05,697
We were like, OK, we know what was going on.

211
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:07,678
But it was obvious that there was

212
00:11:07,758 --> 00:11:09,699
major questions that weren't being answered

213
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:11,821
by the earlier part of our process that

214
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:15,623
needed to be sort of worked out in the block world.

215
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:23,937
And the things that I think that we're missing so far in our process are we hadn't captured the working field space.

216
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:39,500
You've got concept art and reference and things like that, but you don't know what it feels like to actually be there on the controller, standing in the space, and thinking about, well, you know, how big is this room? How high is the ceiling? What are the sight lines, right, between this moment and that moment?

217
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:50,627
Am I going to have a thing in my top-down map? You're just not necessarily thinking of, well, I'm coming into the room, and I've got the door that I need to go to, and it's on the left-hand side of the room in my top-down map, and you get there in the controller and you realize that...

218
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:55,490
we're a third person game with a character on the left hand side of the screen and the character covers the place you're trying to go.

219
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:05,015
You have to think about these things. The other thing is, you've already got all the beats and you know what the player flow is going to be, but how do they connect?

220
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:11,818
In the first chapter of Dead Space 3, we had a moment where Isaac meets Danek, the bad guy, up on this balcony.

221
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:17,701
And you've moved through the whole level in a continuous space. We haven't really had an opportunity to teleport the player or move them anywhere.

222
00:12:18,122 --> 00:12:21,644
And then Isaac falls off of this ledge and lands in this alley and has this whole encounter.

223
00:12:22,104 --> 00:12:24,886
And on a top-down map, it makes a certain degree of sense.

224
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:27,567
But when you're sitting down and actually trying to build it in 3D, it's like,

225
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:32,751
do I actually have enough rooms to get me from, like, the public sector to here?

226
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:37,353
Is a balcony going to make sense? Do I have a doorway that kind of opens into nothingness?

227
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:39,495
Like, does this space actually work?

228
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:42,076
And that's what building your block world is going to do.

229
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:45,298
So now I guess the big thing is, we've got to build a block world.

230
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:50,168
Step one is you sit down and you just make some boxes.

231
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:53,991
At least this is sort of the strategy that I employ.

232
00:12:54,411 --> 00:12:58,194
Start off, get sort of some kind of central point

233
00:12:58,314 --> 00:13:00,535
that you're going to go from, and then I kind of

234
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:01,756
grow the level from there.

235
00:13:02,437 --> 00:13:04,298
An example, another one from Dead Space 3,

236
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:05,399
is the research ship.

237
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,441
So this was my initial walkthrough, top-down map

238
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:09,542
for the level.

239
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:11,003
And you'll see that.

240
00:13:11,944 --> 00:13:15,225
there's this room in the middle of it called the connecting hallway upper.

241
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,427
And there's actually there's a lower part but this is because later I had to

242
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:20,208
cut it into two things because they initially was like

243
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:23,570
hallways are easy right I'm just going to put in a hallway and that'll be a

244
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,211
point and I'll just start growing it from there

245
00:13:25,511 --> 00:13:29,393
and I start looking at it I'm like well but I want to have a window over here so

246
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:31,295
that it connects the outside to the inside.

247
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:34,636
of the ship because we could go in the exterior. I never built something like that before.

248
00:13:34,656 --> 00:13:38,098
And then I'm like, I need, I want a pillar because I want pillars and ducks in this level.

249
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:41,940
And I'm defining what the look and the feel is and the room started to grow.

250
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:47,043
And from there I was like, well, okay, well now I know what this hallway that's connected to this thing is going to look like.

251
00:13:47,423 --> 00:13:51,025
And the whole level kind of grew out of this, this one central point.

252
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,482
And if you open up most maps that I've worked on and you find the room that's at 0, 0 in

253
00:13:55,502 --> 00:14:00,286
Maya, that's probably the first thing I started with. And sometimes it ends up being a really

254
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:07,251
big room. Other times it's like a dead end hallway and it just grew from there. And, you

255
00:14:07,271 --> 00:14:10,194
know, I was wondering, like, am I crazy? Is this kind of...

256
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:16,032
Am I the only one that does this? And there's this interesting article online by David

257
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:22,097
Johnston who worked on D-Dust and it's a fascinating read actually because he's basically

258
00:14:22,117 --> 00:14:26,400
had this screenshot and one other screenshot from the early Team Fortress 2 version that

259
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,404
Valve ended up canning. And he saw this and was like, I see these elements, I like these

260
00:14:31,484 --> 00:14:37,248
arches, I like these textures. And he was like, I wonder if I can do this in Counter-Strike.

261
00:14:37,568 --> 00:14:38,829
And he basically built this room.

262
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:45,956
And from that room, that ended up being the very bottom of this map, which is the CT bond point.

263
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:47,617
And the rest of the map, he was just sort of filling in.

264
00:14:47,898 --> 00:14:53,023
And it's interesting, as he's going, he's talking about how he tried adding in an underground section,

265
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:58,889
but it didn't feel right because it didn't have a lot of the architectural elements and the general vibe that the initial room did,

266
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:00,290
and he ended up pulling it out.

267
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,891
And when you've got something like that, you've got a piece where you're like,

268
00:15:03,071 --> 00:15:06,473
okay, this is capturing kind of the vision and the feel of the space that I want,

269
00:15:06,793 --> 00:15:08,554
that you can then judge other bits of content,

270
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:11,335
then you know you've got it, like you're going forward.

271
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:16,778
But as I'm looking at this, a thing sort of occurred to me of like,

272
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:19,479
well, there's definitely other people that do this, but...

273
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:24,969
Aren't I basically just advocating for following the WorldCraft tutorial?

274
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:28,790
Like, aren't I basically saying, like, stick a brush in the world, hollow it out,

275
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:33,152
dump it in InfoPlayerStart, and hope that you've configured all your pack files correctly,

276
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:37,994
and it's actually going to build? Right? Have I really not changed the process in which I build

277
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:44,736
levels, you know, in the last, like, 15 years? And I went through a serious crisis about this,

278
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:48,618
because I was like, you know, have I been sort of just, like, limited to thinking about things

279
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:50,158
in terms of, like, brushes and boxes?

280
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,859
How am I going to break out of this, right?

281
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:55,741
Because what we were doing in the hands earlier is,

282
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,906
a lot of people now are, you're either not making something

283
00:15:59,946 --> 00:16:02,469
that's on a real tournament deathmatch level,

284
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:04,331
or a Half-Life level, or something like that,

285
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:07,635
or you're working in an indie space where you're using

286
00:16:07,655 --> 00:16:09,036
a completely different kind of tool set

287
00:16:09,056 --> 00:16:09,677
than we're using in AAA.

288
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,682
So, it's like, how do I kind of break out of this box, right?

289
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:18,303
Because I was looking at games that I found interesting online,

290
00:16:18,363 --> 00:16:21,664
and it's like, well, how am I going to turn a box into DayZ?

291
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:25,926
Or how am I going to turn a box into a city in GTA V?

292
00:16:26,546 --> 00:16:29,087
Or how am I going to turn a box into a level for Cut the Rope,

293
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:29,767
right?

294
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:31,508
Like, what does all of this mean?

295
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:38,352
And so I called up our creative director from Dead Space 2, who had moved on and was working at Zynga for a while, and I was like,

296
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:45,159
hey man, so I'm working on this presentation about block worlding, and I'm worried that it might be like, you know, a little too...

297
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:50,663
locked in kind of like the work that you know that I've done like kind of traditional level design

298
00:16:50,983 --> 00:16:54,344
of this sort of thinking about interiors and not necessarily thinking about like

299
00:16:54,704 --> 00:16:58,085
an exterior space where you're worried about the relationship of different points together but

300
00:16:58,145 --> 00:17:02,387
more like defining the whole of the level like how am I going to generalize this it is like

301
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:09,490
oh this basically I feel like I've been building kind of D&D dungeon maps the whole time right

302
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,072
and like as soon as you get past the point where you're defining the edges of the dungeon what

303
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:15,292
what are you going to do

304
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,633
Um, and so his, his response was, well, I mean, if your presentation is really just

305
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:25,337
about white boxing purely, then I think you're, you're, you're talking about a very specific

306
00:17:25,357 --> 00:17:28,859
kind of game and a very specific kind of tool set. So that's when I started to incorporate

307
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:33,102
some more stuff about the general process and how we would integrate your design. But

308
00:17:33,122 --> 00:17:38,426
I also realized that maybe I needed to sort of like look at things beyond just what I

309
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:41,788
do sort of in my day to day process. And I started asking people that work in other disciplines,

310
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:43,790
well, you know, how do you get started on doing design stuff?

311
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,341
Because I realized, maybe if I want to expand beyond this,

312
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:48,981
I need to get a new strategy.

313
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:52,364
So I talked to some people that do UX design.

314
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:53,964
I was really interested in user stories

315
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:55,145
and things like that for a little while.

316
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:57,407
And I started reading a bunch of IDEO papers

317
00:17:57,427 --> 00:18:00,709
and going crazy on design thinking for about two weeks.

318
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:03,590
And then I was like, I don't know.

319
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,491
This might be getting a little far off base.

320
00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:07,152
It's maybe getting a little generalized, right?

321
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:09,014
Because this is a level design talk.

322
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,614
And as a level designer, you're often not

323
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:12,816
creating the interface.

324
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:18,029
that you're using, you don't create the controls, you don't create how a lot of things feel.

325
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,111
So there's a lot of really interesting stuff there, and I think that's a whole other talk, basically.

326
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:24,032
I was just getting too far away from block building.

327
00:18:24,112 --> 00:18:26,874
But one thing I did find interesting was,

328
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:29,315
I was talking to my friend who's an architect in New York,

329
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:33,297
and she does like condos and retail spaces and things like that,

330
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:34,878
and I was like, well, how do you get started?

331
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,562
And she said, well, she makes a few bubble diagrams.

332
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,704
And I was interested in how focused

333
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:44,967
she was on what the human or the user or the player

334
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:46,948
was going to be doing at the time,

335
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:49,751
but also just how they're thinking of, well,

336
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,832
how would these spaces relate to each other,

337
00:18:51,872 --> 00:18:52,873
and what does it imply?

338
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:56,416
And so I was looking at some bubble diagrams.

339
00:18:57,257 --> 00:18:59,478
Some of them are very blueprint-like, but.

340
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:02,022
Other ones are kind of abstract.

341
00:19:02,463 --> 00:19:04,545
And the thing I think that's interesting about this is

342
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:08,788
you can have a room that's got a kitchen, a dining room, and a living room

343
00:19:08,868 --> 00:19:11,250
all in the same space, and there's no walls separating them, right?

344
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:13,893
But they'll have separate bubbles, because the bubbles are representing

345
00:19:14,193 --> 00:19:17,056
the function or the intent or the purpose of a space.

346
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:20,799
And you're thinking about how these relate to each other and how they connect.

347
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:22,741
And this is sort of abstracting out.

348
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:26,478
you know, things to a certain degree. And I was like, oh, this is really interesting,

349
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:31,669
it's spatial, and maybe this could go somewhere. At the same time, I did the global game jam.

350
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:35,656
And I'm building this game in Unity,

351
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,938
and of course I'm doing sort of the level content.

352
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,160
And we're building this joust-like game, right?

353
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,641
So it's a single screen thing, and I

354
00:19:41,661 --> 00:19:43,823
have this terrible little drawing that

355
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:46,025
was in my notebook of my first version of, well,

356
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:46,926
what's our level going to be?

357
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:49,609
And I remember that my thinking was, well,

358
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:52,211
I don't want it to feel like Mario Brothers arcade, where

359
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:53,212
it's just a bunch of boxes.

360
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,095
I want it to feel like there's unique areas and unique spaces.

361
00:19:56,135 --> 00:19:58,016
And if I go to this corner, I'm like, oh, yeah,

362
00:19:58,076 --> 00:19:58,777
I like this place.

363
00:19:59,603 --> 00:20:01,544
And as I'm doing it, I've been thinking about bubble diagrams.

364
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:03,284
I start realizing that I'm like, oh, well, in this corner,

365
00:20:03,304 --> 00:20:05,065
I'm going to have a little diamond cave.

366
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:07,525
And I want to have a nice little narrow thing in here

367
00:20:07,545 --> 00:20:08,626
and a little something you can fall down.

368
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:11,606
And I'm just thinking about these unique areas that

369
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:14,127
are sort of like bubbles of purpose or bubbles of function.

370
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,507
And the main thing that I'm doing as a level designer

371
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:18,868
in this action is, how do these things flow?

372
00:20:18,908 --> 00:20:19,908
How do they connect together?

373
00:20:21,815 --> 00:20:26,320
you know, I had this initial version of it, and you can see that I sort of expanded a few things,

374
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,903
moved some things around, I moved my little diamond cave down to the bottom.

375
00:20:30,384 --> 00:20:35,109
But then in the final version, a lot of those core elements were there, right?

376
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:39,753
And even if I look at this, I just see like there's a central conflict point,

377
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:42,476
there's some side areas where you can have pickups and things like that.

378
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:49,607
And by creating these pockets of interest, we've kind of generalized the way that you're thinking about space and function.

379
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:58,690
And you can use this for a single screen game, or if you were building a city and you want to have different regions and then how you flow between them and when these things become accessible,

380
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:09,353
I think that if you look at designing a world in Metroid, designing a multiplayer first person shooter battle level, or whatever, everything will work.

381
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,254
But at the same time, you don't want to...

382
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:20,259
make everything too complex. You don't want to make everything unique, right? You want to make sure that each area has a purpose, and

383
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,221
the players should have options, and that's why thinking about the flow between them is so important.

384
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:28,704
Because you need to have options, but it can't be like you come into a room and it's 360 degrees and

385
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:32,426
every single thing is a door, right? Because then the player's decision is just like, well, I don't know.

386
00:21:32,706 --> 00:22:01,428
It's a crap shoot. Really complex maps are hard to learn. This is something I learned really early on. I was really obsessed with like the crazy Counter-Strike maps where there's like a million ways to flank and vents and all that kind of stuff. And no one plays those. Everyone plays Dust and Office, right? And it's because it's an easy thing to learn and you kind of have a metagame of, well we go down this route or we go down this route, right? And you go one way five times and then you go the other way once, right? And it becomes interesting. And single player maps

387
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:06,564
you know if you get too confusing the player kind of loses sight of what it is that they're trying to do.

388
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:14,506
I found this as I was digging through some architecture stuff as well and I think this quote is kind of interesting

389
00:22:15,006 --> 00:22:19,787
because it ties in the idea that you're always thinking of things in the next larger context

390
00:22:19,987 --> 00:22:24,828
and I think that thinking of these bubbles of function when you're planning out things really sort of

391
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:30,593
enables this and it also ties in a lot with what I've been talking about in my

392
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:33,375
building universe through details talk of having this kind of mosaic of

393
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:37,298
narrative of how there's a story to each fight, each room, each level, each game

394
00:22:37,618 --> 00:22:42,822
and everything sort of fits within each other. And from there I think that you

395
00:22:42,843 --> 00:22:46,585
know you can you can come up with the design and you can vet it at each phase

396
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:47,746
and make sure that you've got something.

397
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:51,170
But once you've got that thing, it's like, well,

398
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,832
is this design good?

399
00:22:53,053 --> 00:22:55,776
At a certain point, you have to sit down and evaluate.

400
00:22:55,796 --> 00:22:57,218
We've got all these things.

401
00:22:57,318 --> 00:22:58,319
Is this what we want to do?

402
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,421
Is this where we want to grow from?

403
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:02,024
I think that an important thing to keep in mind

404
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:03,326
as you're going through all of this

405
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:07,311
is that at any point, you need to be.

406
00:23:07,878 --> 00:23:12,384
willing to go to step one if things aren't working. Which is throw everything or anything away,

407
00:23:12,584 --> 00:23:17,110
right? You don't necessarily have to get rid of everything, but I used to be a computer

408
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:22,837
engineer and one of the things that one of my professors in undergrad taught us was that, you

409
00:23:22,857 --> 00:23:25,441
know, you write a function and you write this function and you're having problems all the time.

410
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:26,682
It's like your center, it's...

411
00:23:26,994 --> 00:23:30,516
It's really complicated and hard to do and it's where all your bugs are coming from, right?

412
00:23:31,336 --> 00:23:34,758
And people are often scared to tackle that kind of stuff. But if you have a part of your

413
00:23:34,778 --> 00:23:39,360
design or your level is just not working, you've got to be willing to kind of throw it

414
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,263
away because you've learned something, right? You've learned why it's not working. And once

415
00:23:44,283 --> 00:23:47,705
you've identified that problem, redoing it again is probably only going to take like 10%

416
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:51,427
of the time it did the first time. And what you've got is going to be sort of leaner and

417
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:52,427
cleaner and better.

418
00:23:55,132 --> 00:23:59,733
you know, is create a finished product. And if you're pouring, uh, like metal or plaster

419
00:23:59,753 --> 00:24:02,474
into a mold or something like that, you're going to have this little thing called sprue,

420
00:24:02,934 --> 00:24:06,815
which is like the avenue which you're pouring the plaster into the mold, you have to cut

421
00:24:06,855 --> 00:24:10,896
off a little like nub at the end, right? And sometimes that's your initial design. It's

422
00:24:10,936 --> 00:24:14,617
something that you needed in order to get it done, but you just had to kind of cut it.

423
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:19,438
I've had so many times where I've built a room, like this room was one of the ones I

424
00:24:19,478 --> 00:24:22,498
did in Dead Space 2, and like you can't see the exit.

425
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:26,625
the enemies make no sense and I have this like nonsensical ramp that goes down

426
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:30,586
only just to go back up again. And whenever I start doing that I'm like

427
00:24:30,626 --> 00:24:33,807
oh I'm just trying to arbitrarily change the heights of the floors to make it

428
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:37,368
more interesting. But then you sit down and you kind of come up with

429
00:24:37,629 --> 00:24:41,750
you know some central idea like you know having a window separating

430
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,731
you from what's going on. And this room right here you can see

431
00:24:47,015 --> 00:24:48,757
ended up becoming this in the final game.

432
00:24:49,277 --> 00:24:51,119
And that was because the block world captured enough

433
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:52,580
of what I was sort of trying to do

434
00:24:52,961 --> 00:24:54,222
that we were able to go forward.

435
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,484
Because ultimately, that's what we're trying to do here.

436
00:24:57,284 --> 00:24:58,485
We're trying to get a foothold.

437
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:00,227
We're trying to take that first step

438
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:02,549
to climb up this mountain of production.

439
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,472
And it's only then that we're ready to move on

440
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:07,053
to step two at last,

441
00:25:07,513 --> 00:25:09,775
which is to take that design and iterate upon it.

442
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,298
And that's what Joel's gonna talk about in a little bit.

443
00:25:13,658 --> 00:25:18,680
So I'm Seth, you can find me on Twitter at Seth Marinello or email me at Seth at AlterDreams.net

444
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,521
and I'm interested in whatever questions you guys have.

445
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:32,505
**applause**

446
00:25:32,525 --> 00:25:38,288
So if you guys have questions for Seth, you can go up to these microphones here, here, here and over there.

447
00:25:38,308 --> 00:25:39,888
And we have a few minutes.

448
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:51,942
What was the name of your game jam game?

449
00:25:53,243 --> 00:25:56,805
Uh, the name of my game jam game was, uh, Wizard Wizards.

450
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:00,388
Go on.

451
00:26:02,879 --> 00:26:07,101
that there's, there originally were supposed to be wizards but they ended up being dragons but

452
00:26:07,141 --> 00:26:13,683
you know, you can't, you can't change things when you've got 48 hours. Uh, and uh, it was just, it

453
00:26:13,723 --> 00:26:18,685
was like, it was a multiplayer kind of Joust-like game. Uh, and you had magical powers that you

454
00:26:18,705 --> 00:26:21,646
could pick up different little hats. I don't know. I was really excited about having a wizard

455
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:21,886
tower.

456
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,201
Speaking of not being able to change things,

457
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:31,525
when's the line drawn to compromise,

458
00:26:31,605 --> 00:26:34,587
where you can no longer change the level it needs to be

459
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:36,889
pushed off to the next step?

460
00:26:39,592 --> 00:26:42,754
I mean, in an ideal world, never.

461
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:44,416
But obviously not.

462
00:26:44,496 --> 00:26:47,018
I mean, that's one of the reasons why I'm emphasizing.

463
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,780
And so in the talk.

464
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:54,903
I'm advocating for including the block world as part of the initial design phase. And I

465
00:26:54,943 --> 00:26:59,626
think a lot of the time you would, you know, if someone was scheduling things out,

466
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:02,447
they'd be like, well, they wrote a walkthrough and we have key art and we've got a

467
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:07,110
concept, right? This level's done. Check mark. Right? Let's just ship it off and build it.

468
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:12,232
And I really think that you need a playable block world that you can at least run around

469
00:27:12,252 --> 00:27:17,695
in before you can say with any degree of confidence, like, I have a design that we could

470
00:27:17,775 --> 00:27:19,156
ship and build. So.

471
00:27:20,035 --> 00:27:27,382
I mean, that's the point where I'd say major changes to the level, like I'm going to, you know,

472
00:27:27,502 --> 00:27:32,608
completely alter the flow, is probably, becomes out of the question once everyone's agreed that

473
00:27:32,628 --> 00:27:36,612
they've got a functional block world, but I think that that gives you a good point to say,

474
00:27:37,452 --> 00:27:40,015
you know, all right, everyone agrees that this is where we're going to go.

475
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:50,005
Can you go into a little bit of detail about starting your eighth or ninth map,

476
00:27:50,285 --> 00:27:53,727
once you've actually gone through a bunch of them and you feel like you've run your course,

477
00:27:53,747 --> 00:27:56,829
you're not sure where to go next, like now this is a brand new blank page?

478
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:58,550
Um...

479
00:28:00,672 --> 00:28:02,733
I mean, I find that everyone is sort of...

480
00:28:03,513 --> 00:28:08,837
Everyone is sort of unique, particularly if you are moving around games, right?

481
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:09,557
If you're building, like...

482
00:28:09,577 --> 00:28:11,258
If I'm building another Dead Space map...

483
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:16,016
there's a certain element of okay, alright. As I was talking about earlier, I know there's

484
00:28:16,036 --> 00:28:19,739
sort of a pattern or a rhythm to where you're going to have the combat and things like that.

485
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:24,322
But that's just information that you're bringing in. I think that every single level is sort of a

486
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:28,164
unique thing and the only thing you do is get better with the tools over time and you become

487
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:30,586
slightly more experienced. But normally...

488
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:34,888
I feel like the skills you gain are things like when things start going wrong,

489
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:38,410
like you're working on an encounter and people are confused about

490
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,112
where things are, where the enemies are coming from and stuff like that.

491
00:28:41,192 --> 00:28:44,093
Those are the kind of problems that I feel like I spend the most time solving

492
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:45,114
and feel like I'm getting better at.

493
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:46,455
The beginning phase is...

494
00:28:47,915 --> 00:28:49,856
it's sort of just unique to every project.

495
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:56,705
uh when you're starting with a block world what kind of uh level of detail do you start with?

496
00:28:56,745 --> 00:29:01,929
Like do you place every uh like a block for every crate or do you just kind of put a big block

497
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:06,032
like this is just going to be a pile of crates? Like what kind of level do you start with?

498
00:29:06,672 --> 00:29:10,855
Uh that's why I included some of those those pictures of like what the sort of general

499
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,017
finished block world would be like so I'm not doing any texture or any detail or anything

500
00:29:14,037 --> 00:29:16,519
like that. Um I mean I would say that until you have

501
00:29:17,853 --> 00:29:23,479
like a hallway or like a general room with nothing in it that feels good, like don't

502
00:29:23,499 --> 00:29:27,683
start adding anything to it. Like the smallest amount of detail possible to capture what

503
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:35,071
you're trying to do is good. Unless you're, you know, a good 3D artist, right? Like I'll

504
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:38,955
sit there and I'll just thrash in Maya forever trying to make something look good. So I don't

505
00:29:38,996 --> 00:29:39,316
even try.

506
00:29:43,444 --> 00:29:47,928
Did you find out at the end that even with the bubble diagram, you started with the central bubble,

507
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:50,690
one bubble, and then creates the bubble around?

508
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:54,053
Because that's, for example, my approach, that I'm kind of...

509
00:29:54,354 --> 00:29:57,717
I don't have the central room, and then creating from the one central room,

510
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,559
I have the one bubble, and creating all the bubbles around.

511
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,201
Did you end with the same?

512
00:30:03,347 --> 00:30:09,955
Um, well I think what you're describing is sort of, uh, in line with how I build a lot of levels

513
00:30:09,995 --> 00:30:14,140
and what I was talking about earlier, sort of starting from a central point and flowering out

514
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,505
from that location. Um, I'm not necessarily sure that...

515
00:30:19,324 --> 00:30:24,649
the way that I would build something would tie into the way that I'm thinking about sort of this bubble concept.

516
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:30,473
But I look at that as more of a way of encapsulating a bunch of function like this is a town

517
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:34,957
in my open world map or this is an island in like Assassin's Creed 4 or something like that.

518
00:30:35,397 --> 00:30:40,100
And what you're thinking about is the relationship of that bubble to another bubble, right?

519
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:46,645
How they connect, how they flow, or even if you're making a cut the rope level or something like that,

520
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:52,168
where you place the stars and where you place your obstacles or whatever,

521
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:58,212
they kind of create these little relationships or spaces that are going to define how the player thinks about that space

522
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,994
and how they think about your piece of content.

523
00:31:00,394 --> 00:31:02,555
And that's sort of what I'm thinking at that.

524
00:31:04,587 --> 00:31:09,135
Particularly in the first few steps of building a level like this,

525
00:31:10,096 --> 00:31:13,843
do you ever get the level designers equivalent of writer's block?

526
00:31:14,484 --> 00:31:15,686
And how do you deal with it if you do?

527
00:31:16,406 --> 00:31:20,647
Yeah, I mean, that's sort of what I was, I was, I was getting at at the beginning of, of the

528
00:31:20,707 --> 00:31:25,248
talk about, you know, if you, you really don't know what you do, you sit down and define,

529
00:31:25,288 --> 00:31:29,630
well, what is it that, this, what does this content have to accomplish in order to be a

530
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:33,571
success? And what are the basic elements that there's no way we're shipping this without

531
00:31:33,631 --> 00:31:37,592
getting, you know? Um, as, as I was sort of talking about, if you...

532
00:31:38,883 --> 00:31:42,684
if I know that I have to have a room that has a suit kiosk in it, like maybe I just start

533
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:47,305
building that room. Uh and and fitting it into the thing just so I feel like I've got some sort

534
00:31:47,325 --> 00:31:53,207
of momentum. Um but it again it differs from like level to level. I've had times before where

535
00:31:53,227 --> 00:31:58,488
I've like gone back and just started like doing top down maps in some like ancient game just

536
00:31:58,508 --> 00:32:01,808
to kind of get a feel for what I want to do and not even think about what it looks like.

537
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:15,207
Um, I have seen this, uh, for game this day about the level design, some designer plan to, like,

538
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:23,934
trick, trick player to go to like a detour or to the dead end. When, when you design, is it, is, is

539
00:32:23,994 --> 00:32:32,801
that have, uh, like a criteria of the design that how long this world should take? About time?

540
00:32:33,772 --> 00:32:35,832
how long going down a dead end should take?

541
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:43,234
No, I mean, if you want the player to go to the right way,

542
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:47,195
to go to the next level, but sometimes you

543
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,336
have to go to that way, or maybe to the dead end,

544
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:54,257
maybe to a detour, how long for one level

545
00:32:54,277 --> 00:32:57,458
should take, like the spaceship that you have?

546
00:32:57,898 --> 00:33:00,658
I mean, this is going to vary drastically

547
00:33:00,698 --> 00:33:02,999
depending upon what kind of game you're trying to make,

548
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:03,399
right?

549
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:13,541
And even in something like, like in Dead Space it's not even necessarily that one level needs to be a certain amount of length, but it's like, what do we want the player to accomplish, right?

550
00:33:13,621 --> 00:33:23,704
If it's a simple side mission and all we're trying to do is, you know, I did one in Dead Space 3 where you're just trying to capture some extra munition supplies before the bad guys get them and it's an optional thing.

551
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:28,866
you know, that's like a 15 minute level. Uh, because what you're doing isn't that big. You

552
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:33,128
can tell that story pretty fast. Right? And I think that, again, it's whatever your primary

553
00:33:33,168 --> 00:33:38,070
constraint is that's going to determine the size and scope of your content ultimately. So in

554
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:43,772
Dead Space it's often narrative. Right? Um, in, in a multiplayer map it would be the

555
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:49,735
number of players or the game modes you want to support. Earlier you talked about beats.

556
00:33:50,335 --> 00:33:53,796
Yeah. And linking of beats. Can you elaborate? So

557
00:33:55,375 --> 00:34:01,900
beats is one of those sort of weird words that I feel like is generically refers to some sort of

558
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:08,005
event that's not just walking around. But in a level specifically, those are often the

559
00:34:08,085 --> 00:34:12,369
objective points when I complete an objective and then I move forward or I have some sort of

560
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:15,151
major notable encounter. Right? So in

561
00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:22,491
in command ship you you you enter the ship so that's that's a beat basically coming into the

562
00:34:22,511 --> 00:34:26,493
ship entering into the space and there's a scene and then you receive an objective which is you

563
00:34:26,513 --> 00:34:32,295
know go find someone right and the time in between there and that next beat which is finding

564
00:34:32,355 --> 00:34:36,557
this person you're looking for that's filled in with a bunch of gameplay but kind of how those

565
00:34:36,597 --> 00:34:41,659
things connect and beats that are really next but close to each other um or where you get in

566
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,261
these sort of like tricky situations of like so beats of verbs

567
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:47,253
Yes, pretty much.

568
00:34:47,313 --> 00:34:47,493
OK.

569
00:34:47,993 --> 00:34:48,133
Yeah.

570
00:34:50,494 --> 00:34:54,396
So I was wondering, the parallels

571
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:56,317
between level design and architectural design

572
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:57,257
are really interesting.

573
00:34:57,457 --> 00:34:59,218
And I was wondering if your architecture friend

574
00:34:59,638 --> 00:35:03,620
was able to shed some light on the psychology of space

575
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,601
and volume, and how much that comes

576
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:09,222
into play in your early bubble diagrams and stuff.

577
00:35:10,343 --> 00:35:13,804
I think there's a huge overlap in terms of like,

578
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:21,840
the science of it, or like the psychology of it. But in terms of like the practical application of

579
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:29,626
like architectural... Games are this weird pseudo reality, right? Where everything is like extra

580
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:35,972
big and the way that everything flows together is just very different. Like you, when you, like

581
00:35:35,992 --> 00:35:41,236
this room right here wouldn't be unusual in a game, but in real life it's like this room is giant.

582
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:46,264
right? And so sorting that out I think is the hardest thing for someone that's coming from

583
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:50,569
architecture to put in. But the idea of basic forms and how you break up space and how you

584
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:55,315
separate things, things like pillars and architectural supports are super important

585
00:35:55,475 --> 00:35:57,558
and like looking through architecture books is like the best.

586
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:06,232
How do you balance this process with the level artist who's probably equally excited about making

587
00:36:06,812 --> 00:36:12,679
vistas and big rooms and things like that and ensuring that both of you come together to create a really coherent design?

588
00:36:14,862 --> 00:36:15,463
Could you repeat that?

589
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:17,476
Sorry, was that not coming out very clearly?

590
00:36:18,457 --> 00:36:20,420
Sorry, how do you and your level artist

591
00:36:21,662 --> 00:36:22,984
work together through this process?

592
00:36:23,024 --> 00:36:24,847
Because they've probably got their own aspirations

593
00:36:25,028 --> 00:36:26,230
about what they want to achieve,

594
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,752
and ensuring that you both come together

595
00:36:27,772 --> 00:36:29,174
to create something that's really coherent

596
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:30,376
and therefore successful.

597
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:52,707
Yeah, I mean, for me, the ideal situation would be that after I've got maybe a really, really rough block world done in, that I then proceed and work like walking like hand in hand with my environment artist for all that. And that's actually one of the things that I was talking about the brainstorming phase. At that phase, I'll pull in whoever's going to be my environment artist.

598
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:56,580
my concept artist or whoever's the writer for that area,

599
00:36:56,901 --> 00:36:59,382
and just throw ideas around with them and get that stuff down.

600
00:36:59,902 --> 00:37:01,883
Like a lot of it is going to be dictated

601
00:37:01,923 --> 00:37:03,083
by the story and the gameplay.

602
00:37:03,564 --> 00:37:05,665
But how the level really flows and how

603
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:08,686
you add visual interest at that look and feel stage,

604
00:37:08,906 --> 00:37:10,707
I think it's really important to work with.

605
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:14,509
Anyone that you can collaborate with, do it, basically.

606
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,491
When your level design contains puzzles or puzzle elements,

607
00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:22,232
how do you represent those in your block world?

608
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:33,583
Um, it depends on how important I think it's going to be to the architecture and the flow of the

609
00:37:33,643 --> 00:37:40,846
level. If it's a self contained thing, like, um, something that I walk up and engage with and

610
00:37:40,866 --> 00:37:46,128
then I enter essentially another form of control and then I'm going to pop out of, it'll

611
00:37:46,148 --> 00:37:50,870
just be some debug text and a switch and like I need 3 by 3 meters over here probably for

612
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:51,150
something.

613
00:37:51,987 --> 00:38:00,450
if it's a large environmental puzzle, um, you need to at least block it out in Maya or

614
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:04,292
something so you can slide the different elements that are going to move around and be

615
00:38:04,332 --> 00:38:07,494
like, see, I'm going to be able to build this and it's going to make some sort of sense.

616
00:38:08,514 --> 00:38:13,336
Uh, cause if you're, you're betting your hero room on this, you know, fantastic

617
00:38:13,396 --> 00:38:16,398
contraption thing and you don't have it visually represented.

618
00:38:17,497 --> 00:38:22,902
it's yeah. But those I'll often treat as like it's own project. We'll be like we're gonna have

619
00:38:22,922 --> 00:38:30,188
an epic puzzle like at the end of the Despy's 3 DLC we have this gigantic room that uh we

620
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:34,512
basically did the whole thing and then separately we're blocking that final like boss puzzle

621
00:38:34,532 --> 00:38:38,416
room. And that's generally how we'll do it and it'll have it's own kind of design docs and

622
00:38:38,436 --> 00:38:38,676
all that.

623
00:38:42,726 --> 00:38:42,866
OK.

624
00:38:43,066 --> 00:38:47,328
When you try to decide the intent of the level

625
00:38:47,348 --> 00:38:51,950
you are designing, you decide it depending on the game

626
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:59,853
features, or you decided that the feeling you want the player

627
00:38:59,893 --> 00:39:01,813
to feel, or some others.

628
00:39:02,954 --> 00:39:03,954
Can you talk about that?

629
00:39:06,355 --> 00:39:08,755
In some ways this ties into the primary constraint,

630
00:39:08,795 --> 00:39:11,816
but it also ties into what kind of game you're trying to make.

631
00:39:12,156 --> 00:39:15,057
If I'm building a level for a braid or a portal

632
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:17,197
or something like that that's mechanics driven,

633
00:39:18,177 --> 00:39:20,418
then the mechanic is going to be what

634
00:39:20,498 --> 00:39:21,818
drives a lot of the content.

635
00:39:21,918 --> 00:39:25,439
And my x statement or my concept should

636
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:28,199
be something about exploring the different permutations

637
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:29,279
of that mechanic.

638
00:39:31,918 --> 00:39:35,281
In Dead Space, we tend to, we have got a few basic mechanics,

639
00:39:35,401 --> 00:39:37,302
but they generally are featured in every level.

640
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:38,903
We may have a moment where we're like,

641
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:40,324
well, we really want to focus on stasis,

642
00:39:40,385 --> 00:39:41,706
or we really want to focus on TK,

643
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:43,827
but ultimately, it's a narrative

644
00:39:43,847 --> 00:39:45,248
and an experience-driven game,

645
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:47,290
because the mechanics aren't what we're using

646
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,191
to create kind of the mood and the atmosphere,

647
00:39:49,231 --> 00:39:51,133
which is what a lot of the franchise is about.

648
00:39:55,981 --> 00:40:00,702
How often do you have the situation where you're told your level is too massive or too much of a

649
00:40:00,722 --> 00:40:06,243
strain on system resources on a constrained system? And have you avoided that in planning or

650
00:40:06,283 --> 00:40:11,624
deal with that? Pretty much all the time. In the last week our lead technical artist came up and

651
00:40:11,644 --> 00:40:19,826
was like, really? You want to do this rodeo show again? Because I have a tendency, I'm

652
00:40:20,146 --> 00:40:23,206
relatively technical and I tend to be like, no, we can do this.

653
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:32,146
this will be fine. And then at the end of the day it's like, for that boss room at the end of the

654
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:36,609
dead space awaking thing I was like I'm going to make the biggest room that's ever been in a dead

655
00:40:36,629 --> 00:40:40,771
space game and I'm going to include all these mechanics that I've personally never got to put in

656
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:46,655
a level somewhere. And it was kind of a nightmare to ship. But that's the part that's fun though.

657
00:40:49,544 --> 00:40:53,146
You, you, you gotta pick your battles though. Like when I'm doing something like that I'm

658
00:40:53,186 --> 00:40:57,648
intentionally being like, alright, this is going to be a moment that I want people to

659
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:00,730
remember and that I want to be like something that I'm like sort of proud that I put

660
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:04,752
together. You don't want to like make hallways that randomly have like transparent glass

661
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:09,014
in them all over the place just to, you know, make your rendering engineer cry.

662
00:41:15,401 --> 00:41:20,082
I had a question on, you said on purpose of areas in your level.

663
00:41:20,282 --> 00:41:22,323
Yeah.

664
00:41:22,443 --> 00:41:27,004
Is it a good design principle to say to have just an area in your level where just the

665
00:41:27,044 --> 00:41:31,165
only reason it's there is for the player to explore and has no other purpose?

666
00:41:31,525 --> 00:41:32,445
Yeah.

667
00:41:32,485 --> 00:41:34,405
But to look good?

668
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:37,846
I mean, it's part of building out your world.

669
00:41:37,906 --> 00:41:38,966
Like it should have a purpose.

670
00:41:40,049 --> 00:41:46,554
but it doesn't have to be a required alpha path gameplay purpose, right? Like, I, uh, it, it

671
00:41:46,775 --> 00:41:51,178
might have been last year or the year before, at some point, I talked about how somewhere in

672
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:55,842
your game you need to have like one bathroom, right? Like, just to fill out the fact that, you

673
00:41:55,882 --> 00:42:01,086
know, these are people and there's a bathroom somewhere, right? Like, those are the kind of

674
00:42:01,126 --> 00:42:05,430
things that flesh out whatever it is that you're trying to do. And I think having, um,

675
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:09,789
you know, having little nooks or dead ends that the player's going to discover, and if they feel

676
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:15,152
like they found something cool, then it enhances their experience. So it's, I mean, I'd put as

677
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:18,795
many, like, interesting little side paths as I can get on the environment art budget.

678
00:42:20,396 --> 00:42:24,438
I think we've got time for one more. Yeah?

679
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:30,762
My name's Ben. I'd like to point out always looking at the larger context of things. So I was

680
00:42:30,802 --> 00:42:31,863
wondering what

681
00:42:32,848 --> 00:42:36,970
How big a role do other levels play in the design of your level?

682
00:42:41,913 --> 00:42:45,255
When I'm working on something on a sort of a day-to-day basis,

683
00:42:45,935 --> 00:42:47,256
not that much.

684
00:42:48,945 --> 00:42:52,848
I mean, unless I'm looking at, well, they've got a mechanic that I find really interesting.

685
00:42:53,468 --> 00:42:58,791
Like, we had a decompression mechanic in Dead Space 2, which got repurposed for like a million

686
00:42:58,851 --> 00:43:02,013
different things in other levels, not always just decompression.

687
00:43:02,894 --> 00:43:04,114
So there's that element of it.

688
00:43:04,395 --> 00:43:07,777
But that's actually one of the reasons why when we were doing DS3, we started out at

689
00:43:07,797 --> 00:43:12,960
the beginning trying to look at things from a very high level, because we wanted to have

690
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,601
this experience where there was...

691
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:21,166
sort of more open or hub like moments followed by a more linear section bridging you to kind of

692
00:43:21,206 --> 00:43:27,151
another hub. And at that point that dictated a lot because we had a vision for what the overall

693
00:43:27,191 --> 00:43:31,174
game flow was going to be and that dictated what the flow of the individual levels were in

694
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:36,558
relation to the other bits of content, right? It also just depends on how much your stuff flows

695
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:40,622
together. You know if you're making like a Bioshock 1 or something where you can actually

696
00:43:40,722 --> 00:43:44,005
move and backtrack a lot then it does matter a lot.

697
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:45,529
Thanks.

698
00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:47,029
Nice job.

699
00:43:47,049 --> 00:43:47,189
Awesome.

700
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:47,409
Awesome.

701
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:47,589
Awesome.

702
00:43:47,609 --> 00:43:47,770
Awesome.

703
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:47,950
Awesome.

704
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:52,930
Awesome.

705
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:53,230
All right.

706
00:43:53,571 --> 00:43:54,211
Thank you, Seth.

707
00:43:54,251 --> 00:43:54,831
That was great.

708
00:43:55,891 --> 00:43:57,191
So we've got a 15 minute break,

709
00:43:57,531 --> 00:44:00,472
and then Joel's talk, how we shipped Skyrim

710
00:44:00,892 --> 00:44:04,312
and Fallout 3 using iterative level design,

711
00:44:04,372 --> 00:44:05,053
except backwards.

712
00:44:06,173 --> 00:44:08,393
That will be in 15 minutes, so go hit the head,

713
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:11,214
grab a drink, and come back 15 minutes.

714
00:44:11,454 --> 00:44:12,534
We'll pick it up promptly.

715
00:44:12,714 --> 00:44:12,994
Thank you.
