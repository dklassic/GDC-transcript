00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:16,930
Hello everybody, I'm Chris Gardiner, Narrative Director at Failbetter Games, and these are

2
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,351
my comically enormous headphones.

3
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:24,153
And this is my talk on Sunless Skies and what we learned while we were making its narrative.

4
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:28,456
So we are Failbetter Games.

5
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:31,717
We are a small British indie company of 17 people.

6
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:35,659
And we made these games all set in the same universe

7
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:37,739
of weird Victorian Gothic horror.

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,001
We began with Fallen London,

9
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:45,962
our web-based, text-based role-playing game,

10
00:00:46,082 --> 00:00:47,483
which is still going strong.

11
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:51,584
We moved on to Sunless Sea and its expansions of Mariner,

12
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:54,145
which was our first foray into Unity games.

13
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:59,100
and most recently we released Sunless Skies, the spiritual sequel to Sunless Sea.

14
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:07,828
As a company we're known for our writing and the atmosphere of our games which lies somewhere at

15
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:14,955
the intersection of whimsy and horror and I became narrative director in 2016 about halfway through

16
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,036
the The Mariner expansion.

17
00:01:16,949 --> 00:01:20,011
Before then I had been a writer and then head writer at Failbetter.

18
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:25,235
So Skies was the first project of this scope that I'd narratively directed

19
00:01:26,116 --> 00:01:29,258
and I would like to talk about the approaches that we took and the things that we learned.

20
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:38,385
So Sunless Skies is a narrative roguelike RPG. You play the captain of a space train

21
00:01:39,026 --> 00:01:41,467
in a world where the Victorian empire goes to space,

22
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:44,990
finds it riddled with cosmic horror and then makes it worse.

23
00:01:47,337 --> 00:01:53,999
And the game combines two modes of play, a real-time exploration mode where you have direct

24
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:59,781
control over your space train and you fly around and explore and fight enemies and gather resources.

25
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:07,943
And then when you interact with a discovery or dock at a port, we switch to an elaborate

26
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:12,684
interactive fiction mode where the player gets to explore the location in a text-based interface.

27
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:18,578
Sunless Skies was well received, both commercially and critically.

28
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:21,380
Here are excerpts from some of its reviews,

29
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,661
including the poignant and haunting,

30
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:26,223
I underestimated the bees from CG Magazine.

31
00:02:26,783 --> 00:02:28,644
And haven't we all at some point in our lives

32
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:30,025
underestimated the bees?

33
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:36,189
So this story had a happy ending but at the start of the protest the task in front of us seemed

34
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:41,793
pretty alarming. We knew that it would be a successor to Sunless Sea and so it would be

35
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:47,177
similar in a number of ways including that split between real time and interactive fiction modes.

36
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:53,882
But the team that started out on Skies was nearly four times bigger than the one that started out on

37
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:58,705
Sea. So we knew we wanted a less centralized creative direction.

38
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:02,454
more opportunities for team members to contribute ideas to the game,

39
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:06,876
and for departments to feel confident in working more independently.

40
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:14,439
And the scale of a narrative task in front of us was pretty daunting.

41
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:23,350
It took place in a setting that by then was eight years old and had millions of words dedicated to

42
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:33,239
it. The Fallen London Universe lore bible is about 137 pages long and they are 137 pages of complicated

43
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:39,105
and dense lore and we didn't want that to put players off. We wanted Skies to be a good entry

44
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:40,026
point into the universe.

45
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:45,487
It was also set in a baroque and unfamiliar environment.

46
00:03:45,988 --> 00:03:48,870
So Sunless Skies is set in space, but not as we know it.

47
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:52,573
It has winds and sentient malevolent suns

48
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,054
and starlight that drives you mad.

49
00:03:55,255 --> 00:03:58,097
So players and ourselves on the team

50
00:03:58,477 --> 00:04:00,939
couldn't rely on common science fictional assumptions

51
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:02,320
to make sense of it.

52
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:07,664
It was also, we knew, going to be really big.

53
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:16,308
Specifically, it ended up being 800,000 words big, which is 1.6 women pieces, or the first

54
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:22,215
two and a half Game of Thrones books, or 19 seconds of Twitter, which is a nightmare we

55
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:23,456
should just stew on for a little while.

56
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:31,377
And so to achieve that we knew we would need to use not only our internal writers but freelance

57
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:36,300
writers as well and that they would bring their own voices and also have varying levels

58
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,002
of familiarity with our tools, our law and our approach.

59
00:04:41,904 --> 00:04:45,907
So today I want to talk about how we got from that very large,

60
00:04:45,947 --> 00:04:48,508
very terrifying blank page to those lovely reviews.

61
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:51,948
And I'm going to focus on three ways we approached this,

62
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:55,569
beginning with establishing and communicating a tone.

63
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:58,090
And I'm going to spend most time on this one

64
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,410
because it was quite difficult to get right.

65
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:03,771
I think I should mention that as a narrative-driven company,

66
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:06,132
story plays a role in development

67
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,493
earlier than it may do for many other developers.

68
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:14,115
So for us, an early goal was to achieve

69
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:16,695
a firm mutual understanding of the game's tone

70
00:05:16,995 --> 00:05:18,476
that was shared by the whole studio.

71
00:05:20,117 --> 00:05:25,500
We can't expect other departments to have to digest million words of enthusiastic lore,

72
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,322
but even if people don't know all the nitty-gritty, if they understand the tone of the game,

73
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:33,024
we're at least all on the same page, even if we're not on the same line.

74
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:35,946
And we used a range of techniques to achieve this.

75
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:45,791
So to begin with, we established a set of narrative pillars.

76
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:54,385
I can't take credit for doing this. This was a recommendation by Michael Aidlaw of

77
00:05:55,165 --> 00:06:00,426
BioWare, Ubisoft and now Yellow Brick, who suggested creating a short list of core principles

78
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:05,888
that we would use to guide the narrative of the game. And they would have three main functions.

79
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:11,229
They would act as signposts to tell us what's important and provide direction when we were lost.

80
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:16,750
They would act as creative prompts to help inspire new stories and new angles on stories.

81
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:21,995
and they would work as tie breakers in the case of disagreements. So that might be a disagreement

82
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:27,018
between two members of staff on what's the best way to go about something, or it might be a

83
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:31,101
disagreement in your own brain if you've got two different ways a story could go to help you work

84
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:35,083
out which is the best way to, which of those options would fit best in the game.

85
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,894
When it came to deciding our narrative pillars,

86
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:43,677
we were fortunate in that a couple of years earlier,

87
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:46,380
our communications director, Hannah Flynn,

88
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,183
had done a load of work with us to establish a sense

89
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,826
of what our work is and what was essential

90
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,907
to the games that we made, or at least the games

91
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:57,128
that we had made up to that point.

92
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,852
So when we started working on Skies,

93
00:07:01,892 --> 00:07:04,254
we got the writing team in a room

94
00:07:04,414 --> 00:07:06,416
with a representative of the comms team.

95
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:14,793
and we looked at all that original work and decided what of it we wanted to carry over into Skies,

96
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:21,117
what of it we were prepared to lose, and what we would replace it with. Those last two went

97
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:22,117
hand in hand. We...

98
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:27,299
There was already a lot of complicated law in Fordham, London and Sunless Sea, and we

99
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:31,921
didn't want people to have to know that in order to enjoy skies, and then have skies

100
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:34,502
add a whole bunch of extra complicated stuff on top of it.

101
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:38,903
So we operated sort of one thing in, one thing out policy to try and keep it simple.

102
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:50,572
We, from that discussion, we distilled it all down into five narrative pillars.

103
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:55,355
That might be one too many, but Skies was a big game, so it ended up being okay.

104
00:07:56,836 --> 00:08:01,518
And these are the pillars that we came up with, and they would act as instructions and guidance

105
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:08,603
to the writers, and also act as prompts suggesting what sort of fiction to write about, what topics

106
00:08:08,623 --> 00:08:08,923
to write in.

107
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,481
And we found that they worked best as punchy, even slightly provocative statements like this.

108
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:19,702
And let's go through and take a look at what each one of those meant in the context of Sunless Skies.

109
00:08:20,562 --> 00:08:28,044
So the first one, stake your claim, meant that the player should have the opportunity to leave their mark on the world.

110
00:08:28,664 --> 00:08:29,645
They should be able to.

111
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,501
make decisions that would change the state of the world, and because that captain can die and then

112
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:40,602
you could create a new captain to replace them, that new captain would inherit much of the state

113
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:46,863
of the world that the prior captain had left behind. But it also pointed us towards a number

114
00:08:46,883 --> 00:08:53,944
of recurring themes in the game, which would be power grabs and territorial feuds and conflicts

115
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:55,785
between rival competing factions.

116
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,313
Our second pillar was, who are you in the dark?

117
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:07,375
And this was important to us because we wanted the player

118
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:10,377
to be able to construct a sense of who their captain was

119
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,078
through play and through the decisions that they made.

120
00:09:15,385 --> 00:09:20,527
But then the in the dark clause there made it a little more specific because we were particularly

121
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:28,669
interested in how who you were might change when the laws that you were used to are weak or absent

122
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:33,390
and when the world that you are in is completely unfamiliar and different from the world you left

123
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,730
behind.

124
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:39,287
Our third pillar was conceal your hand.

125
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:43,169
And this was a reminder to us to find new angles

126
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,691
on familiar stories and to look for unexpected consequences

127
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:47,492
to player choices.

128
00:09:48,993 --> 00:09:53,035
And we also wanted to layer the world with mysteries.

129
00:09:54,155 --> 00:09:56,136
And the answers to many of those mysteries

130
00:09:56,337 --> 00:09:59,038
aren't explicitly revealed in the text of the game.

131
00:09:59,638 --> 00:10:02,760
The player has to find clues to them

132
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,041
and then piece them together themselves.

133
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,003
And fictionally, we knew that we would want to have lots of ulterior motives,

134
00:10:09,084 --> 00:10:12,367
plots and schemes and big conspiracies to address in our stories.

135
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,073
Our fourth pillar was mind your manners,

136
00:10:17,673 --> 00:10:20,276
and this was important to our Victorian setting

137
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:24,942
to help us emphasize Victorian manners and hypocrisy.

138
00:10:25,773 --> 00:10:33,358
But it also acts as a reminder to us that the denizens of space that the Victorians

139
00:10:33,378 --> 00:10:36,439
would encounter would have customs and traditions of their own.

140
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:45,424
What would happen when the Victorian traditions bashed into those celestial traditions and

141
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:46,525
what would be the fallout from that?

142
00:10:49,402 --> 00:10:51,402
And our final pillar was nothing is sacred.

143
00:10:52,143 --> 00:10:55,424
And this was a prompt to us to take nothing for granted.

144
00:10:56,544 --> 00:10:59,125
We knew that we wanted in the game's story

145
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:02,226
to make changes to fundamental human concepts

146
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:03,347
like time and death.

147
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:06,568
So time in Sunless Skies is not linear and reliable

148
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:08,569
and death is not the end.

149
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,150
But it was also

150
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:16,705
a reminder to us to use both humor and horror.

151
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:19,236
I spoke earlier about how our...

152
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:27,067
writing style often relies on this combination of horror and whimsy and both humor and horror

153
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:33,050
contain an element of transgression to them, I think, and they work very well together. You can

154
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:39,654
contrast them to create a kind of a more effective sort of oscillation of experience for the player

155
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:46,018
and a well-placed moment of humor can underline or puncture a moment of horror and vice versa.

156
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:53,185
So I'll come back later to look at some specific examples of how those pillars

157
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,294
guided different aspects of the game's narrative. But first...

158
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:02,284
I want to talk about how it became obvious to us that the pillars were great for identifying

159
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:09,590
tone and for having productive discussions about it, but they weren't so great for communicating

160
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:09,730
it.

161
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,032
They were too high level, too imprecise.

162
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:18,817
So to communicate the tone requires a strong narrative documentation that gives the people

163
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:19,938
reading it a lot of context.

164
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:24,218
So we created a fairly simple set of documents.

165
00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:25,959
We didn't want people to have to read too much.

166
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,440
And we started with an introduction to the high wilderness.

167
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,001
The high wilderness is the name for space in our game.

168
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:35,982
And that looks at what this environment was like

169
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:38,063
and what the player's experience of it would be.

170
00:12:39,563 --> 00:12:40,364
And once we'd done that,

171
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:44,025
we moved on to outline the four separate regions of the game.

172
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:47,366
We knew that we wanted four different regions of the game,

173
00:12:47,506 --> 00:12:49,287
each of which would feel like a different experience

174
00:12:49,307 --> 00:12:49,807
to the player.

175
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:53,399
Both of those documents we did in pre-production,

176
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,560
and then once we moved into production,

177
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,422
we would do a more detailed document

178
00:12:57,522 --> 00:13:00,984
on each individual region as we went through.

179
00:13:01,004 --> 00:13:05,727
And that let us learn, each time we did one,

180
00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:07,328
we could learn from the lessons of the ones

181
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:08,229
we'd done previously.

182
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:15,253
The actual process for making this narrative documentation

183
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:16,814
was fairly simple as well.

184
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,692
I would write an initial draft of them.

185
00:13:21,113 --> 00:13:23,114
For the detailed documents about each region,

186
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:25,777
that would be preceded by a concepting session

187
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,741
where our writing team would all get together in a room

188
00:13:31,302 --> 00:13:34,084
and everyone would be able to pitch ideas for ports

189
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:37,547
and enemies and stories and discoveries in each region.

190
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:39,689
And then I would take all that material

191
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,691
and pass it into a single document.

192
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:48,998
When I was working on those documents, I was always guided by the narrative pillars and

193
00:13:49,018 --> 00:13:50,480
tried to draw them out and emphasize them.

194
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:56,867
And once they were done, I would publish them and invite everybody in the company to read,

195
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:57,848
comment, and discuss.

196
00:13:57,868 --> 00:14:00,451
So everyone in every department could contribute to them.

197
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:09,281
And then after all that discussion and feedback, I would take it all and incorporate it into a

198
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:13,964
revised version of that document. And while we were working through this process, we quickly

199
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:20,169
learned some useful tricks. The aim here, I should say, was to encourage buy-in and engagement from

200
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:26,153
all different departments to the tone that we were trying to create. And some of the tricks

201
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:27,254
we developed for doing that.

202
00:14:29,544 --> 00:14:36,988
included, so the first one was look for recurring feedback when people responded to the documents.

203
00:14:37,788 --> 00:14:41,570
That might be lots of people saying the same thing, or it might be a bit more indirect.

204
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:47,854
It might be that a particular topic or concept is very easily misunderstood, or that you

205
00:14:47,874 --> 00:14:50,435
have lots of questions about that single topic.

206
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:57,742
And this is useful stuff because the questions that your team asks will also probably be

207
00:14:57,782 --> 00:15:03,447
questions that the players would ask. And once you've identified them, it's important to address

208
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:07,390
them in the revisions that you make to the document. And a couple of useful ways that

209
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,271
we found to do that.

210
00:15:09,905 --> 00:15:16,230
included these. So first, when you identify an important concept, state the three most immediate

211
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:24,756
and important things about it. So an example here from our narrative documentation, the team

212
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:29,679
response made it very clear that we needed to concisely convey the way in which the high

213
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:34,062
wilderness, our environment, was similar to and different from actual space.

214
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:41,808
So the way we did that was by saying that it was cold, like spaces, windy, like space

215
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:43,790
very much isn't, and wonderful.

216
00:15:44,251 --> 00:15:48,215
Not wonderful in a nice way, wonderful in the sense that a fairy court is wonderful.

217
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,358
It's fascinating, it's consuming, it's terrifying.

218
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:58,568
And then we would go on to specify three things that it definitely wasn't.

219
00:15:59,428 --> 00:16:01,169
Because ungoals are important.

220
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:04,330
It is crucial to communicate what you don't want as well as what you want.

221
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,932
So in this case, the key things that it was important to make clear

222
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:11,953
were that the high wilderness was not a vacuum.

223
00:16:12,713 --> 00:16:17,854
that it was not an impartial environment, that its laws weren't uncaring like the laws

224
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:18,294
of physics.

225
00:16:18,335 --> 00:16:24,356
They were laws that were made by grand sentient entities as the result of legislation.

226
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,817
They were the result of argument and compromise and politics.

227
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:30,838
And the third thing that the environment definitely wasn't was easy.

228
00:16:30,878 --> 00:16:33,599
It was going to be frightening and challenging and difficult.

229
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:43,058
And the third kind of trick we learned to make the documentation more effective also was very

230
00:16:43,138 --> 00:16:49,162
useful when it came to actually making the game. And it was to identify showpiece concepts which

231
00:16:50,023 --> 00:16:55,487
are useful for heading off questions and assumptions that people will have when they

232
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:59,590
encounter the game. And they also help you communicate what is special about your game.

233
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:04,873
So here's an example. I mentioned earlier that the high wilderness was windy.

234
00:17:05,852 --> 00:17:09,176
And because that was such an important point that space,

235
00:17:09,677 --> 00:17:13,602
our space has an atmosphere, we really wanted to drive it home.

236
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,266
So to do this, we implemented a number of winds

237
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:19,489
into the game that had mechanical effects.

238
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,732
So not only would they push your locomotive about

239
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:22,673
as you were trying to fly around,

240
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,364
But the peacock wind, for example, caused your food supplies to burst into horrifying growth,

241
00:17:29,404 --> 00:17:32,508
and they would grow these disgusting nodules on that were filled with milk.

242
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:35,931
And sometimes those nodules would grow little mouths that would sing little songs.

243
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:41,076
So mechanically, that would increase the food supplies that you had on board

244
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:44,159
while you were in the wind, but it would also increase your captain's terror.

245
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,323
And when terror got too high, horrible, horrible things would happen.

246
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:53,983
Incidentally, if you ask your art department to draw a wind that looks like a peacock,

247
00:17:54,443 --> 00:18:00,244
you get a filthy look and this. So you should be very careful what you wish for.

248
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:07,926
The second showpiece concept that we settled on that I want to talk about

249
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:15,762
We implemented this very early in the game, kind of made a big deal of it quite early in the game,

250
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:22,767
because we wanted to use it to help undermine player assumptions. And it was that time is a

251
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:27,571
resource that is manipulated by the Victorian Empire to achieve the things that they do.

252
00:18:28,892 --> 00:18:32,754
And the aim was, we wanted to introduce that early, so the player would ask, well,

253
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:37,638
if time doesn't work how I expect, what else might not work the way I expect?

254
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:43,620
And we also used this concept to justify a lot of fictional nonsense in the setting.

255
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,325
It was used to explain how London managed to build their empire in space so quickly,

256
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:53,751
how the player can travel these vast interstellar distances, how the Queen Victoria manages

257
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,155
to retain her power over her empire and so on.

258
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:03,950
And here are some of the ways that we brought that in very early on in the game.

259
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:10,195
So an early character, the fastidious inspector, it's her job to ensure that it is the same

260
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:13,298
time across all corners of the Empire.

261
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:18,088
despite the fact that different places are manipulating time in different ways.

262
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:24,132
And this was inspired by the early train network in Britain, where before the train network came in,

263
00:19:24,272 --> 00:19:29,095
it didn't really matter if Manchester was 10 minutes ahead of London, because travel times

264
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:34,939
were so great. But as soon as you had a train network in place, and it mattered to the minute

265
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:38,942
when trains arrived and left, it would suddenly became very important for everywhere in the

266
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:40,143
country to have exactly the same time.

267
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:50,014
And we also put this into the economy of the game.

268
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:53,217
So a trade good that you can trivially buy or sell

269
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:55,758
at markets is a barrel of unseasoned hours.

270
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,182
So those are three kind of tricks that we learned

271
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:03,864
as we went on to make our documentation more effective.

272
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:07,487
Effective here means clear, concise, and digestible.

273
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:14,009
So now we've talked about that process, I want to talk about how we use the pillars

274
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:20,475
to give each region in the game its own distinct identity. So Skies has four regions which you can

275
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:26,100
see here. This map also includes two of the cities in those regions and each of those regions is

276
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,944
linked by a transit relay which is a big device that catapults you across the sky.

277
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,662
And we wanted each region to be a very different experience for the player.

278
00:20:36,422 --> 00:20:44,165
So what we did was we ended up separating them by picking two of our content pillars and saying they were particularly important for that region.

279
00:20:45,985 --> 00:20:49,287
So our starting area was the Reach, which is this wild, untamed frontier.

280
00:20:50,387 --> 00:20:52,308
Originally, we intended the game to start in London.

281
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:59,580
but we found that the Reach had a more familiar kind of trading space game experience and it gave

282
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,724
players a bit more of a solid footing to experience the game on when they were surrounded by all this

283
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:12,968
other weirdness. So here we repaired state your claim with who are you in the dark because

284
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:17,031
the Reach is somewhere that London is trying to claim and expand into

285
00:21:17,871 --> 00:21:20,173
so it's full of settlers and gold rushes and claim jumpers.

286
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:26,480
but it's also a place of few laws and you have a lot of freedom to choose who you're going to be

287
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:34,082
there and which side you want to be on because the region is driven by a conflict between the

288
00:21:34,222 --> 00:21:38,863
independent settlers, the Tacities, and the London loyalists, the Stovepipes, and the player can

289
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:44,525
choose how they want to get involved in that conflict. And while we were doing this it became

290
00:21:44,545 --> 00:21:45,425
clear that combining...

291
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:53,672
the narrative pillars with the visuals of the region that we wanted, gave us a great

292
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:57,795
way to focus on a different sort of horror for each region.

293
00:21:58,395 --> 00:22:01,858
And so the horror that we settled on for The Reach was the horror of the natural world

294
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:03,119
and the natural world fighting back.

295
00:22:04,177 --> 00:22:08,922
And we were inspired by things like the Cordyceps fungus, which infects ants and colonizes them

296
00:22:08,982 --> 00:22:12,546
and turns them into zombies and makes them climb up trees and kill them.

297
00:22:12,826 --> 00:22:16,330
And then they spread their spores to places the fungus wouldn't otherwise be able to reach.

298
00:22:17,151 --> 00:22:21,556
And things like those weird deep sea nightmare fish that you see on nature programs.

299
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:24,900
But the theme of The Reach was very much that nature is terrible and fish are weird.

300
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:32,232
An example story that we set in The Reach that expressed these themes was written by our own

301
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:37,635
James Chew and it was about the Parsifal, which was London's first exploratory vessel to The Reach

302
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:44,318
that met a tragic end and was colonized by a sentient fungus. So this is an example of London

303
00:22:44,358 --> 00:22:49,861
trying to stake a claim to The Reach and failing. And the way James wrote it is a story of slow burn

304
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,523
horror that has an ending that is at once quite tragic and rather funny.

305
00:22:54,826 --> 00:22:59,009
and after it the player has a wide range of choices on how they want to respond to it.

306
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:04,794
All of those choices are valid and all of them say something quite meaningful about who the character is.

307
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:12,601
Our second region was Albion which represents the city, suburbs and outskirts of London.

308
00:23:13,482 --> 00:23:18,846
So whereas the Reach was a wilderness, Albion was very civilized and populated.

309
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:24,089
And the two concepts here were mind your manners and conceal your hand because we knew this is

310
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:30,737
where we wanted to lean into Victorian formality and politeness and how it concealed ambition and

311
00:23:30,797 --> 00:23:35,863
inhumanity. This is an empire founded on secrets and full of plots and schemes.

312
00:23:37,085 --> 00:23:42,530
And this led us to the concept of social horror, which is best exemplified, I think, in an

313
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:47,294
example port from the region called the Brabazon Work World, which was written by one of our

314
00:23:47,974 --> 00:23:49,756
writers and editors, Olivia Wood.

315
00:23:50,837 --> 00:23:56,241
And the work world is obviously based on Victorian workhouses where the poor were essentially

316
00:23:56,401 --> 00:24:03,247
imprisoned and given room and board, but forced to work in return for it in very poor conditions.

317
00:24:04,802 --> 00:24:07,384
So we wanted to take that idea and magnify it.

318
00:24:07,704 --> 00:24:10,006
So they went from workhouses to work worlds.

319
00:24:10,626 --> 00:24:13,788
And in addition, the empire has engineered it

320
00:24:13,888 --> 00:24:17,071
so that time moves quicker on work worlds than outside it.

321
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:20,734
So that means you can send someone to a work world

322
00:24:20,874 --> 00:24:23,216
and extract a year's labor from them in a month.

323
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,377
And people will enter the work worlds

324
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:27,379
as young, healthy people,

325
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:29,500
and emerge from them a few years later

326
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,142
as aged and decrepit.

327
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:34,476
And this is the foundation of Albion's expansion.

328
00:24:34,496 --> 00:24:36,597
This is how it was able to build itself up so quickly.

329
00:24:38,298 --> 00:24:40,319
And the mind your manners pillar comes in

330
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:43,060
because this is part of society.

331
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,341
This is accepted and normalized by this society.

332
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,942
It's even seen as a charitable thing.

333
00:24:47,962 --> 00:24:49,743
And conceal your hand comes in because.

334
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:56,709
the work world's put on a palatable face and they even allow carefully staged tours of them and the

335
00:24:56,749 --> 00:25:00,555
player gets to go on these tours and they will only see the truth if they look for an opportunity

336
00:25:00,635 --> 00:25:03,120
to deviate from the tour and see what's really going on.

337
00:25:05,696 --> 00:25:10,757
Our third region is Eleutheria, where the sun has rebelled and plunged everything into darkness.

338
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:16,079
And this is a place of revolutionaries and pariahs, where things no longer work the way

339
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:19,220
you expect them to. And there's nothing to keep you honest, but your own conscience.

340
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,241
It's a place of temptation and opportunity. And the two pillars that we wanted to rely

341
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:28,082
on here were nothing is sacred. And who are you in the dark?

342
00:25:29,318 --> 00:25:31,819
And this all led us to the horror of the unknown,

343
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:35,040
partly of getting lost,

344
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,860
because when you arrive in Eleutheria,

345
00:25:37,521 --> 00:25:38,861
the transit relay leading back

346
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:40,061
to where you've come from is broken.

347
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:41,762
So when you arrive there, you are trapped

348
00:25:42,422 --> 00:25:44,643
and you have no idea where you are or how to get out.

349
00:25:46,944 --> 00:25:48,584
And the second aspect of the horror of the unknown

350
00:25:48,624 --> 00:25:51,285
we explored a lot was the fear of the dark,

351
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:56,047
which we explored a lot in the enemy design for the region.

352
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:57,487
So there is...

353
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,306
one class of vessel called the dowsers who worship the dark and will attack you if your

354
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:09,755
headlight is off and there is another class of vessel that will attack you if your headlight is

355
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,924
Oh, I've got that the wrong way around. The dowsers will attack. Dowsers worship the dark,

356
00:26:13,944 --> 00:26:18,769
so they attack you if your headlight is on. And the other class of vessel will attack you if your

357
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:24,634
headlight is off, because then they assume you're a dowser. So your headlight here becomes a banner

358
00:26:25,455 --> 00:26:28,598
signaling your allegiance. And if you encounter both enemies at once,

359
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:31,241
you have a decision that you have to make very, very quickly.

360
00:26:32,984 --> 00:26:38,430
We also created the Grievers, which are a monster that is inactive unless your light

361
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:43,455
shines upon them, at which point they wake up, get very angry, charge you, and explode

362
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,376
into caustic ica.

363
00:26:45,297 --> 00:26:50,844
One of our writers described them as like being attacked by an angry prolapse, which

364
00:26:50,904 --> 00:26:53,406
is very much the sort of prose that we pay her to create.

365
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:56,270
And we also added invisible enemies.

366
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:59,212
So the undeparted will stalk you throughout the region

367
00:26:59,292 --> 00:27:00,814
until they can ambush you.

368
00:27:01,174 --> 00:27:03,296
And they are only revealed when you shine your light on them.

369
00:27:04,877 --> 00:27:07,259
So together, these enemies create

370
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,341
kind of competing pressures to have your light on and off,

371
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:11,702
to create this tug of war of tension

372
00:27:12,002 --> 00:27:13,563
that means you can never quite relax in the region.

373
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,200
And our final highest level area was the Blue Kingdom,

374
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,601
which is one of the domains of the dead.

375
00:27:20,501 --> 00:27:23,442
So death is not a state of rest or grace here.

376
00:27:24,222 --> 00:27:25,563
You can recruit the dead as crew.

377
00:27:26,183 --> 00:27:27,083
Souls are a currency.

378
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:31,884
And it's home to a remorseless alien bureaucracy.

379
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:36,766
And this led us to the concept of cosmic and bureaucratic

380
00:27:36,806 --> 00:27:37,106
horrors.

381
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,746
And we found that both those sorts of horrors

382
00:27:39,246 --> 00:27:41,307
worked very well together because they both

383
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:43,888
rely on making the individual fairly insignificant.

384
00:27:46,007 --> 00:27:52,816
One way we explored that in the region was that everyone that goes there is assigned a status

385
00:27:53,777 --> 00:27:58,603
and that status determines what ports you can access and also what enemies are hostile to you.

386
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:03,620
And when you first arrive, you have the invisible status, which means you can access hardly

387
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,181
anywhere and everything is hostile.

388
00:28:05,741 --> 00:28:09,743
And you have to gain access to one of the other statuses in order to change that.

389
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:14,045
So you might become anti-deceased, which means you will be dead one day and it's technically

390
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:14,846
only a matter of time.

391
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:18,267
And that makes you like, it's like having a visitor's visa.

392
00:28:18,287 --> 00:28:19,548
You're basically a tourist in the region.

393
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:26,655
Another status was yoked, which means you perform some function or service for the bureaucracy,

394
00:28:27,075 --> 00:28:31,619
but you're kind of like a roadie. You do important work, but you're not meant to be seen by the

395
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,822
audience. And the last status was the ephemera, which are basically the customers. They are the

396
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:42,627
spirits of the dead who are being prepared to pass beyond to some unknown purpose and destiny.

397
00:28:43,267 --> 00:28:48,891
And none of these statuses grants full safety or full access. So you do have to switch between

398
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:49,872
them as you explore the area.

399
00:28:52,726 --> 00:28:58,332
So I hope those examples show how we use narrative pillars to identify a tone,

400
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:02,517
how we develop narrative documentation to communicate it,

401
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:08,003
and how we used pillars to emphasize the differences between regions

402
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:11,607
and to give the player different experiences as they play through the game.

403
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:17,900
Okay so having spoken about how we established and communicated a tone I want to move on to talking

404
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:23,703
about how we put an emphasis on effective pitching and how we used effective pitching

405
00:29:23,723 --> 00:29:26,805
to ensure that that tone that we had created carried through to the game.

406
00:29:28,428 --> 00:29:33,470
I think, or I suspect, we probably do fewer rewrites than many companies do, which is both

407
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:38,851
good and bad. And we certainly do do them. One mistake we made during the development of Skies

408
00:29:38,871 --> 00:29:44,013
was we tried to write too much finished content too early, and we were writing ports and stories

409
00:29:44,353 --> 00:29:49,935
before we could see what that content looked like in situ. And as a result of that, our writers,

410
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:54,136
James and Olivia, had to go back towards the end of development and do quite extensive revisions

411
00:29:54,196 --> 00:29:56,097
on the content that we'd written first to bring it.

412
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:00,086
in line with the sort of content that we'd written later.

413
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:07,455
But on the whole, I think one way we managed to get away with doing fewer rewrites is by heavily

414
00:30:07,575 --> 00:30:12,499
investing in the pitching process. And by the pitching process here, I'm just talking about

415
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:17,344
whatever process it is whereby a writer shares their initial concept for a story and gets

416
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:24,410
feedback on it. For us, that generally meant the writer pitching the concept to me, the narrative

417
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,412
director, sometimes with another writer present.

418
00:30:28,538 --> 00:30:31,640
If I was writing content, I would pitch to one or more other writers.

419
00:30:33,121 --> 00:30:37,504
So throughout this section, the examples that I give, I refer to writer and director. I basically

420
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:43,448
just mean pitcher and pitchee there. And exactly who that is will depend on the specific content

421
00:30:43,488 --> 00:30:50,252
and the different company. But I think that a successful pitch has a number of specific goals.

422
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:55,136
The first of which is it ensures consistent tone and storytelling.

423
00:30:55,953 --> 00:30:57,854
This was particularly important in Skies,

424
00:30:58,295 --> 00:31:00,256
given the range of voices that were going to be

425
00:31:00,376 --> 00:31:01,436
providing content for it.

426
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:04,037
We wanted those different writers.

427
00:31:04,117 --> 00:31:06,899
We wanted that range of voices to make the game

428
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:10,260
more expansive, more inclusive, and more interesting.

429
00:31:11,861 --> 00:31:14,122
But at the same time, all the different stuff

430
00:31:14,142 --> 00:31:16,143
that they wrote had to fit into the whole.

431
00:31:16,163 --> 00:31:18,484
It all had to be congruous with the world that we'd built.

432
00:31:20,485 --> 00:31:21,886
A successful pitch also

433
00:31:23,234 --> 00:31:25,956
helps ensure that a writer can do their best work.

434
00:31:26,557 --> 00:31:29,540
This is your opportunity to identify what a writer needs

435
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,500
to write this piece.

436
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:34,023
And you can use it to even out differences

437
00:31:34,204 --> 00:31:36,506
in writer's familiarity with your law, your game,

438
00:31:36,526 --> 00:31:37,366
your systems, and so on.

439
00:31:39,728 --> 00:31:42,130
And at the end of the pitch, both the director

440
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:43,992
and the writer should have a reliable picture

441
00:31:44,072 --> 00:31:45,533
of what the final content will look like.

442
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:54,928
So I like to think about a pitch as having three distinct phases to it, and the first of them is to

443
00:31:54,988 --> 00:31:59,309
provide a solid bedrock for discussion, and the aim here is to ensure that the writer and the

444
00:31:59,349 --> 00:32:05,251
director both understand the story that the writer wants to tell. So the writer's role during this

445
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:09,652
phase is to communicate the shape of the piece using whatever aspects of it are useful to do so,

446
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:13,513
and it can help to run through it as the player would experience it.

447
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,672
Meanwhile, the director's role is very much to shut up

448
00:32:18,733 --> 00:32:22,156
and to listen, not talk, and let the writer communicate

449
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:24,398
the piece as they want to, without interruption

450
00:32:24,698 --> 00:32:25,519
and getting distracted.

451
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,082
I like to just sit quietly and take notes.

452
00:32:30,503 --> 00:32:33,706
Once the writer's finished, you can then

453
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:34,927
move on to asking questions.

454
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:36,988
Questions are magic.

455
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:41,232
Asking a question is often more effective than just raising

456
00:32:41,272 --> 00:32:42,293
observation or criticism.

457
00:32:42,873 --> 00:32:42,973
And.

458
00:32:45,212 --> 00:32:51,076
Frankly, the writer is the expert on the story here. Even at this stage, the writer spent more

459
00:32:51,116 --> 00:32:56,360
time thinking about the story than the director probably ever will. So it is appropriate for

460
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:01,284
the director to approach the writer with a spirit of respect and inquiry, not judgment.

461
00:33:04,686 --> 00:33:10,671
The second phase is about distilling the pitch down to focus on the core story

462
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:12,792
and to trim away non-essentials.

463
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:23,099
So the director takes the lead in this phase and their feedback, its aim should be to emphasize

464
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:28,326
the strength of the piece. This is a collaborative process, not a confrontational one, so you should

465
00:33:28,366 --> 00:33:33,011
respect the writer's intent, understand what the writer is trying to do and support it.

466
00:33:35,312 --> 00:33:38,356
You should also try and remove distractions from the piece.

467
00:33:38,456 --> 00:33:40,138
That doesn't mean stripping out everything

468
00:33:40,178 --> 00:33:42,121
that doesn't directly serve the core story,

469
00:33:42,682 --> 00:33:44,244
because stories are improved by nuance.

470
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:47,608
But do look at how each piece supports the whole.

471
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:55,742
The director should also propose ways to tie this content in with other content in the game.

472
00:33:56,142 --> 00:33:59,863
The director is the one who has the overview of the content as a whole and has probably seen many

473
00:33:59,903 --> 00:34:04,184
pictures from many writers and so knows what's going on in the rest of the game. And the more

474
00:34:04,224 --> 00:34:08,786
connections you can make between sections of content, the more satisfying and convincing

475
00:34:08,806 --> 00:34:14,808
the world will see. The director should also advocate for the player. So what do I mean by that?

476
00:34:16,307 --> 00:34:20,009
Well, the director is the first set of external eyes on the story,

477
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:23,570
and so they should look at it from the player's perspective.

478
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:27,772
Is one ending more disappointing than another? Could a plot point be

479
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:31,614
misinterpreted? Is one section particularly confusing? Is

480
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:34,355
there an obvious option the player might want to take that's been missed out?

481
00:34:36,756 --> 00:34:42,199
And at the same time, think about if there is any other content.

482
00:34:43,118 --> 00:34:47,201
that what's been described to you might contradict or conflict with.

483
00:34:47,762 --> 00:34:51,284
Again, the director is the one with the overview of the content as a whole.

484
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:54,187
The writer is focusing very much on this specific story and likely so.

485
00:34:58,211 --> 00:35:01,434
Meanwhile, the writer's role during phase two is to advocate for the story.

486
00:35:02,054 --> 00:35:05,317
Advocate here doesn't mean defend every decision to the death.

487
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:10,521
What the writer presents in a pitch should be intentionally malleable,

488
00:35:10,962 --> 00:35:13,444
not a final product. So they should hold onto it lightly,

489
00:35:14,224 --> 00:35:16,787
and they should actively look for ways to improve it too.

490
00:35:17,587 --> 00:35:19,729
They should be prepared to accept and suggest changes to it.

491
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:24,397
However, when a change that's been suggested

492
00:35:24,938 --> 00:35:27,018
would hurt the story, the writer should

493
00:35:27,038 --> 00:35:29,139
be prepared to stand their ground and explain why.

494
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:31,759
And this is where the narrative pillars come in,

495
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:33,700
because when you have a disagreement like this,

496
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,781
you can refer to the narrative pillars to help resolve it.

497
00:35:39,982 --> 00:35:41,822
The third phase is there to ensure

498
00:35:41,862 --> 00:35:43,422
that there are no surprises, that both

499
00:35:43,462 --> 00:35:46,303
the writer and the director are expecting the same thing

500
00:35:46,343 --> 00:35:47,023
to come out of this.

501
00:35:49,282 --> 00:35:51,543
So now the writer's role is to make sure

502
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,504
they understand what changes need to be made,

503
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:54,645
and they've got a record of them.

504
00:35:55,785 --> 00:35:57,626
And if there are any lingering uncertainties,

505
00:35:57,666 --> 00:35:59,387
if there's anything the director hasn't addressed,

506
00:35:59,427 --> 00:36:00,868
if there's anything the writer still needs,

507
00:36:01,308 --> 00:36:02,509
now is the time to resolve them.

508
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,332
The director, meanwhile, the first part of their role

509
00:36:09,412 --> 00:36:10,433
is to contain the scope.

510
00:36:12,327 --> 00:36:18,589
a lot of feedback would have been given and too often it can look like the answer to a story issue

511
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:25,110
is to add another thousand words but no it almost never is and realistically you need to bear in

512
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:29,431
mind how much the writer will be able to do well in the time they have available for it.

513
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:34,932
So the director needs to help the writer prioritize the content so that if the

514
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:38,313
any of it needs to be cut it's easy to identify which bits can be cut.

515
00:36:40,377 --> 00:36:44,101
And the director should also be clear about the changes that you've agreed and revisit and

516
00:36:44,141 --> 00:36:48,426
summarize them just as a belt and braces method to make sure that you're both on the same page.

517
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:57,996
So good pitching we discovered has a number of benefits. So it has production benefits,

518
00:36:58,196 --> 00:37:02,761
it reduces the amount of content that has to be revisited and revised.

519
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:11,374
It also makes writing easier. Writing is a painful and usually lonely process. A good pitch at least

520
00:37:11,474 --> 00:37:15,039
can help make it less painful. It anticipates and addresses problems before they arise.

521
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,165
There will always be new problems that arise, but if you can get rid of a bunch of them early,

522
00:37:19,265 --> 00:37:20,007
it's much much better.

523
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:28,725
And finally, we learned that productive and collaborative pitch discussions help writers

524
00:37:28,765 --> 00:37:34,188
develop their skills. They take lessons from them and then they implement what they've learned the

525
00:37:34,228 --> 00:37:35,129
next time they write something.

526
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:42,401
And I should be clear that we got to this policy and this approach to pitching over

527
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:45,422
the course of many, many, many, many pitches over the course of developing Skies.

528
00:37:45,602 --> 00:37:50,563
We didn't start out this strong, I think, but we had a lot of experience doing it.

529
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:51,664
And so we got here in the end.

530
00:37:52,024 --> 00:37:53,284
And I think we've benefited a lot from it.

531
00:37:56,529 --> 00:38:03,050
Okay, I'm going to move on to my third and final topic now, which is the targeted consultations

532
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:10,952
we did to support the narrative in Skies. So to write well about something, you need either

533
00:38:11,112 --> 00:38:15,453
experience or knowledge. And if you lack personal experience or knowledge,

534
00:38:15,953 --> 00:38:19,294
you need to do research to gain secondary knowledge about it.

535
00:38:20,275 --> 00:38:25,302
We tend to think of research as reading books, but basically it means consulting expert sources,

536
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:31,469
and those sources can be people. So in Sunless Skies we did four major consultations

537
00:38:33,492 --> 00:38:35,855
on the following topics. We did one on colonialism,

538
00:38:36,616 --> 00:38:38,758
one on transgender and non-binary representation,

539
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:45,675
one on structuring horror mysteries, and one on how to invent an appalling cosmic bureaucracy.

540
00:38:46,175 --> 00:38:49,178
That was one specifically intended to help us

541
00:38:49,998 --> 00:38:54,242
invent the narrative structures for the Blue Kingdom that I discussed earlier.

542
00:38:54,802 --> 00:38:59,243
and we recruited Emily Short to consult on that one. Emily Short is now currently our

543
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:07,705
creative director but she's extremely experienced in writing interactive fiction and complex puzzles

544
00:39:08,185 --> 00:39:13,446
and she has also had to navigate the UK's labyrinthine immigration policies so she

545
00:39:13,486 --> 00:39:18,287
has a lot of experience of appalling cosmic bureaucracies. I'm going to talk about a couple

546
00:39:18,327 --> 00:39:23,228
of case studies from these consultations to show how they worked and what we got from them.

547
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:29,314
So the first one I want to talk about our colonialism consultation. So why did we consult

548
00:39:29,374 --> 00:39:35,460
on colonialism? Well, Sunless Skies was about the Victorian Empire going to space.

549
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:40,966
So it was about colonialism, whether we wanted it to be or not. And therefore,

550
00:39:41,026 --> 00:39:45,731
it was important that we represent the issues here sensitively and with nuance.

551
00:39:47,175 --> 00:39:50,078
We approached Meghna Jayanth to consult with us on this.

552
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:52,961
She had already been a freelance writer for us before,

553
00:39:53,081 --> 00:39:55,143
so she was familiar with how we worked

554
00:39:55,423 --> 00:39:56,524
and she was familiar with our setting.

555
00:39:58,386 --> 00:40:00,888
And the format we used was that we gave her access

556
00:40:00,928 --> 00:40:04,992
to a build of the game and all our narrative documentation,

557
00:40:06,553 --> 00:40:07,774
time to go over them,

558
00:40:08,195 --> 00:40:10,316
and then we just let her lead a discussion on them.

559
00:40:11,644 --> 00:40:13,945
And we got a whole range of benefits out of doing this.

560
00:40:14,365 --> 00:40:17,147
The most obvious one was that we got pages and pages

561
00:40:17,187 --> 00:40:19,168
of new story ideas and angles on stories

562
00:40:19,268 --> 00:40:21,068
that we never would have considered otherwise.

563
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:23,430
Just so much stuff, more than we could ever put in the game.

564
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:23,930
It was brilliant.

565
00:40:26,475 --> 00:40:31,538
And we also received excellent guidance on other sources to consult to deepen our knowledge

566
00:40:31,738 --> 00:40:37,342
further. A consultation isn't the end point of you trying to gain this information. It's often

567
00:40:37,382 --> 00:40:44,646
the beginning and it gives you a, it accelerates the process, but it is not the end. And the other

568
00:40:44,686 --> 00:40:50,090
major thing we got out of it was a concept that is widely applicable to much of our work and that

569
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,632
we've come back to again and again. And it's who is paying for this.

570
00:40:54,634 --> 00:41:00,657
So colonialism tells the lie that its benefits come without a cost, but someone is always paying

571
00:41:00,717 --> 00:41:09,162
for them. Colonialism and empire separate the beneficiaries from the people that are paying

572
00:41:09,442 --> 00:41:13,724
for something, and hide the people that are paying for it from the beneficiaries.

573
00:41:14,925 --> 00:41:19,807
So it's important that you represent that and that connection. It's not only responsible,

574
00:41:20,108 --> 00:41:21,748
but it also makes for great dramatic stories.

575
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:31,584
Our second case study that I want to talk about was on transgender and non-binary representation.

576
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:42,533
LGBTQA plus characters feature extensively in our games, but if we want to continue providing

577
00:41:42,953 --> 00:41:46,096
good representation, we have to keep pushing the ways in which we do it.

578
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:55,695
And in particular, for trans and NB characters, we'd often struggled with finding the line between

579
00:41:55,736 --> 00:42:01,882
being too subtle in their presentation and too bold in it. So how can we make clear that a

580
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:08,789
character is trans or non-binary without doing so in a way that's preposterous or blunt or ridiculous

581
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:09,269
or harmful?

582
00:42:11,811 --> 00:42:14,652
And we approached a body called Queerly Represent Me

583
00:42:14,852 --> 00:42:16,753
to run this consultation.

584
00:42:16,793 --> 00:42:17,894
They were excellent.

585
00:42:17,914 --> 00:42:18,794
I can't recommend them enough.

586
00:42:20,355 --> 00:42:23,316
And the format that we used was a workshop

587
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:28,699
which started with a discussion of several officer stories

588
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:30,340
that we had written for the consultation.

589
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,141
We knew we wanted these officers in the game.

590
00:42:32,821 --> 00:42:34,322
We didn't have full outlines for them.

591
00:42:36,403 --> 00:42:39,544
But we wrote up some outlines specifically

592
00:42:39,584 --> 00:42:40,464
for the consultation.

593
00:42:41,649 --> 00:42:47,811
and we wrote them on topics that we wouldn't have been confident putting into the game

594
00:42:48,091 --> 00:42:55,794
without expert advice. But the consultation was a safe space to explore them and have

595
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:59,215
fruitful conversations about them and work out how we could make this work.

596
00:43:01,549 --> 00:43:02,751
And then after we talked about that,

597
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:07,177
we went into a consultant-led discussion on other content.

598
00:43:07,197 --> 00:43:08,880
We'd given them a build of the game.

599
00:43:09,481 --> 00:43:11,724
All the consultants on the panel had had a chance to play it,

600
00:43:12,044 --> 00:43:13,326
and they'd all come with topics that they

601
00:43:13,366 --> 00:43:14,328
wanted to talk to us about.

602
00:43:16,689 --> 00:43:18,770
We got a whole bunch of benefits out of doing this.

603
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:21,891
Here's one that was very easy to do, but had a big effect.

604
00:43:23,271 --> 00:43:29,173
The consultants quickly raised the issue of terms of address.

605
00:43:29,313 --> 00:43:32,334
So you can choose a term of address for your captain.

606
00:43:32,874 --> 00:43:35,355
The terms of address that we'd inherited from Sunless Sea

607
00:43:35,395 --> 00:43:38,756
were fine, but they were quite gender binary.

608
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:39,977
They're like, my lord, my lady.

609
00:43:40,637 --> 00:43:42,358
There was citizen in there, which is very neutral,

610
00:43:42,398 --> 00:43:44,538
but on the whole, they were strongly gender coded.

611
00:43:45,538 --> 00:43:47,279
So the recommendation we received

612
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:50,361
was to add more terms of address that were either non-gendered

613
00:43:50,781 --> 00:43:52,222
or at least less extremely gendered,

614
00:43:52,242 --> 00:43:53,503
so it was on more of a spectrum.

615
00:43:56,165 --> 00:43:58,566
The Victorian period that we were setting the game in

616
00:43:58,707 --> 00:44:01,068
made this difficult. The Victorian period

617
00:44:01,088 --> 00:44:03,149
had a very gender-coded pattern of employment.

618
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:05,671
But we did find a whole bunch of new options,

619
00:44:06,011 --> 00:44:07,292
which are underlining red here.

620
00:44:08,498 --> 00:44:09,339
that we added to the game.

621
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:11,459
And it turned out that these new options

622
00:44:11,499 --> 00:44:12,840
were popular with all players,

623
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,921
not just ones hoping to create a non-binary captain.

624
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,782
Representation improves things for everybody.

625
00:44:21,723 --> 00:44:23,923
Another benefit we got was,

626
00:44:23,983 --> 00:44:26,084
so one of the officers' outlines

627
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:27,904
that we had provided for consultation

628
00:44:27,964 --> 00:44:29,485
was on the feline eccentric here,

629
00:44:29,905 --> 00:44:32,566
who is a transgender character with fantastical elements.

630
00:44:34,523 --> 00:44:38,344
I'd written an outline that I was not at all confident in, but which I thought would probably

631
00:44:38,404 --> 00:44:47,028
prompt a valuable discussion. And when we came to discuss it, one of the consultants, Ash McCallan,

632
00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:53,211
discussed it very eloquently and then immediately suggested like half a dozen ways

633
00:44:53,692 --> 00:44:58,274
that we could write the story that were drastically better than the version that

634
00:44:58,374 --> 00:45:01,455
I had come up with, just leagues ahead of my original draft.

635
00:45:02,628 --> 00:45:06,330
So it became immediately clear that they were the best person for the job.

636
00:45:06,831 --> 00:45:13,375
So we hired her on a freelance basis to co-write this officer with us.

637
00:45:15,137 --> 00:45:16,398
And she did a great job.

638
00:45:16,918 --> 00:45:19,940
And Ash would later return to consult with us on other content.

639
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,383
So consultations can be great ways to find people to work with.

640
00:45:27,195 --> 00:45:32,779
And another example of a benefit, this is a, I include this one as an example of how detailed

641
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:38,303
the consultation could get. The prudent secretary is a character from early in the game, they were

642
00:45:38,323 --> 00:45:42,847
a very significant early character. And when we introduced them, it was just with that white block

643
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:48,171
of text there, the red block of text wasn't present. So we introduced them like this.

644
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:51,853
The secretary's gender is the subject of some debate in the company canteen.

645
00:45:52,314 --> 00:45:54,155
The secretary's prudence, however, is not.

646
00:45:56,238 --> 00:46:04,663
Now, this was a poor way to do it. The secretary is a powerful character, but that introduction

647
00:46:05,183 --> 00:46:08,765
made them the subject of company gossip, and that takes power away from them.

648
00:46:10,787 --> 00:46:15,689
However, we didn't want to just cut that line. One of the consultants made the point that they

649
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:19,852
personally sometimes quite enjoy it a little bit when people are a bit off balance about their

650
00:46:19,872 --> 00:46:20,112
gender.

651
00:46:22,077 --> 00:46:28,520
So the revision that they proposed and that we immediately implemented was the line in red

652
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:32,721
underneath it, which we just added to the end of that paragraph. Both these facts provide the

653
00:46:32,761 --> 00:46:38,084
secretary with a great degree of satisfaction. So that revision puts power back in the secretary's

654
00:46:38,124 --> 00:46:45,407
hands and is much more true to the character. And this discussion led us to discuss another

655
00:46:45,787 --> 00:46:48,148
principle that's become a very common feature of our work.

656
00:46:48,789 --> 00:46:52,915
And it was a principle that came up in the colonialism consultation as well. And it's this,

657
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:58,824
where does the power lie in this scene? So when you are representing the marginalized,

658
00:47:00,076 --> 00:47:05,000
you have to ask that question because you are always making a statement about relative power

659
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:09,463
in a scene and therefore it is better to be intentional about it and make sure that you're

660
00:47:09,503 --> 00:47:13,907
saying what you intended to. You want to make sure you're not disempowering a character accidentally.

661
00:47:14,227 --> 00:47:17,349
You could look at is there a form of power they could seize in the scene that will

662
00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:24,355
let them assert their agency. So having talked about those case studies I'm going to talk a

663
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:28,698
little bit about how we went about organizing these consultations.

664
00:47:30,307 --> 00:47:32,970
And I'm going to start with the aims of a consultation

665
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:33,992
and what you want to get out of them.

666
00:47:34,132 --> 00:47:36,455
So the first thing we want to get out of them

667
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:39,800
was to upscale our writers and to improve their ability

668
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,563
to write sensitively and effectively about more topics.

669
00:47:46,344 --> 00:47:49,906
However, consultation also makes your own research more effective.

670
00:47:49,926 --> 00:47:51,527
They basically give you a leg up on it.

671
00:47:52,267 --> 00:47:54,969
An expert in the field can suggest sources

672
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:57,911
that will be particularly good or complementary.

673
00:47:58,831 --> 00:48:00,552
And as a newcomer to the field,

674
00:48:00,592 --> 00:48:03,133
it would probably be hard for you to find and identify those sources.

675
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:09,277
And finally, a consultation can give you expert feedback

676
00:48:09,497 --> 00:48:11,938
on specific content that you've written and how to improve it.

677
00:48:14,823 --> 00:48:20,504
The question of when to look for a consultant is a difficult one.

678
00:48:21,645 --> 00:48:22,965
And it requires some humility.

679
00:48:23,685 --> 00:48:28,607
You have to ask yourself, do you struggle to write a particular topic?

680
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:30,667
Do you lack confidence on it?

681
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:34,328
Are you feeling clumsy or under-informed when you do it?

682
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:36,929
If you're...

683
00:48:38,014 --> 00:48:42,036
not able to recognize that, it's going to be difficult.

684
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:45,919
But you can look at how other people feel

685
00:48:45,939 --> 00:48:47,520
about your work on that topic.

686
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,462
Do they feel it's cliched or simplistic or unrepresentative?

687
00:48:53,443 --> 00:48:55,904
And once you've worked out that you will benefit

688
00:48:55,924 --> 00:49:01,247
from a consultation, you need to be able to convey

689
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:03,348
these weaknesses clearly.

690
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:06,630
If you don't know what to ask for, people can't help you.

691
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:12,887
Finding a consultant can be difficult.

692
00:49:13,488 --> 00:49:18,653
A good approach is to look for representative and expert

693
00:49:18,733 --> 00:49:19,794
organizations.

694
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:22,817
Queerly Represent Me that I mentioned is a good one.

695
00:49:23,157 --> 00:49:24,198
People of Color in Play.

696
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:26,781
We've also had good results from.

697
00:49:29,417 --> 00:49:35,682
consulting or talking to IGDA special interest groups. They've helped us find people as well.

698
00:49:36,722 --> 00:49:43,027
You can also approach experts you're aware of who have written or spoken informatively on the topic.

699
00:49:45,469 --> 00:49:52,235
I think gained fluency in a consultant is a significant advantage. It helps if they

700
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:55,337
understand the constraints that we're working under.

701
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:00,544
But it's not vital, I think. If you find a consultant that isn't

702
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:05,350
experienced with games, you may just need to do a bit of extra work to help to

703
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:12,818
help them to understand where you're coming from, how you work, what you can do, what you can't do.

704
00:50:14,947 --> 00:50:19,111
And you should be prepared to go through several layers of contact before you find someone.

705
00:50:19,251 --> 00:50:24,175
Sometimes you'll reach out to someone who can't do it themselves or they're not available or

706
00:50:24,216 --> 00:50:28,179
they're not interested or they're not suitable but they are happy to point you towards someone

707
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:33,283
who can and as long as you keep following that chain sooner or later you'll find someone just

708
00:50:33,303 --> 00:50:38,208
keep going. So once you've found a consultant

709
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:45,394
you need to ensure that they have what they need. First, you need to be able to give them a clear

710
00:50:45,434 --> 00:50:50,256
brief, which means explaining your goals for the session and what you want to get out of it.

711
00:50:52,357 --> 00:50:57,659
You also need to provide them with access to the game and guidance for how they should engage with

712
00:50:57,699 --> 00:51:05,503
it. There's no point throwing a 40-hour game at them and saying, just play. Point them at the

713
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:08,644
bits of it that will be useful for the consultation.

714
00:51:10,889 --> 00:51:14,612
Similarly, you should share the relevant narrative

715
00:51:14,652 --> 00:51:15,793
documentation with them.

716
00:51:16,994 --> 00:51:18,054
But you should be selective.

717
00:51:19,175 --> 00:51:20,476
Don't just share everything.

718
00:51:20,837 --> 00:51:21,697
Their time is precious.

719
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:23,959
Share the stuff that's going to be most useful

720
00:51:23,979 --> 00:51:24,639
for the consultation.

721
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:28,622
You also need to give them plenty of time to prepare,

722
00:51:29,283 --> 00:51:30,824
to play the game, to read the documents,

723
00:51:30,904 --> 00:51:33,606
to formulate their thoughts, to prepare any presentation.

724
00:51:35,848 --> 00:51:37,189
And you need to pay them appropriately.

725
00:51:37,549 --> 00:51:39,410
These are experts, and this is expert work.

726
00:51:42,301 --> 00:51:46,544
The structure of a consultation will depend on the topic and the consultant,

727
00:51:46,584 --> 00:51:50,607
and you should discuss it with them and agree something that works for both of you.

728
00:51:50,627 --> 00:51:52,889
It is well worth investing time up front to do that.

729
00:51:53,649 --> 00:51:57,532
The kind of model that we've used a few times that's worked quite well for us is

730
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:04,718
half day workshops, which may start with a presentation or a discussion.

731
00:52:06,132 --> 00:52:10,975
then go into a Q&A session, and then go into a period

732
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:13,658
where you get feedback on specific samples

733
00:52:13,678 --> 00:52:15,679
that you've provided to the consultant.

734
00:52:19,522 --> 00:52:22,785
So there are a great many benefits

735
00:52:22,825 --> 00:52:25,006
to doing these consultations.

736
00:52:27,974 --> 00:52:32,120
The first one is that it will elevate your work. The whole point of this is it brings expertise

737
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:37,808
that you don't have. You will, as a result of consultations, you will be able to write stories

738
00:52:38,109 --> 00:52:41,493
that you wouldn't have been able to before and you'll be able to do a better job of it.

739
00:52:43,824 --> 00:52:45,745
They're also creatively energizing.

740
00:52:45,765 --> 00:52:48,285
They act as this amazing injection

741
00:52:48,545 --> 00:52:50,386
of new ideas and perspectives.

742
00:52:50,806 --> 00:52:51,846
They're incredibly exciting.

743
00:52:51,886 --> 00:52:53,367
And every time we've come out of one,

744
00:52:53,547 --> 00:52:55,167
everyone involved has been absolutely buzzing

745
00:52:55,687 --> 00:52:59,028
and kind of excited to put what we've learned into practice.

746
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:03,809
They also, we discovered,

747
00:53:03,929 --> 00:53:06,470
act as very valuable training for writers.

748
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:08,730
What you learn in a consultation

749
00:53:08,831 --> 00:53:10,471
will carry over into other work.

750
00:53:13,176 --> 00:53:15,617
And while I focused on narrative consultations here,

751
00:53:16,017 --> 00:53:19,138
we found that they are often valuable for other disciplines

752
00:53:19,218 --> 00:53:19,418
too.

753
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:22,418
So we did a consultation recently

754
00:53:22,558 --> 00:53:25,139
that someone from our art department came along to,

755
00:53:25,179 --> 00:53:26,920
and they asked a bunch of art-focused questions

756
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,700
on good ways to represent a particular topic

757
00:53:30,381 --> 00:53:31,801
sensitively and accurately.

758
00:53:35,902 --> 00:53:42,104
So that is, that's the sum of it. You have now experienced the creation of Sunless Skies

759
00:53:42,124 --> 00:53:48,185
narrative on a one-to-one scale. It is like you were there, but I hope I've shown how we

760
00:53:49,265 --> 00:53:54,607
developed a clear communicable tone to get the team on the same page, how we used a strong

761
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:57,567
pitching process to ensure that that tone carried all the way through to the game,

762
00:53:59,468 --> 00:54:01,488
and how we use consultations to address

763
00:54:02,473 --> 00:54:07,675
areas of weakness and to elevate the work to make it something that we wouldn't have been able to do

764
00:54:08,295 --> 00:54:14,658
without doing those consultations. No talk is complete without an appearance by one of

765
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:20,380
Sunless Sky's in-game mascots, the inadvisably large dog. Here he is, he's a very good boy.

766
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:26,443
And thank you very much for attending. I hope this has been useful and that you've enjoyed it.

767
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:27,663
Take care everyone.

768
00:54:31,546 --> 00:54:31,826
You
