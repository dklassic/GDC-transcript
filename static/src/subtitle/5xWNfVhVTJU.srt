1
00:00:06,243 --> 00:00:09,465
everybody. I guess it's probably time to get started. Um, so this

2
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:14,607
is, uh, Study and Transparency, How Board Games Matter. So I'm,

3
00:00:14,727 --> 00:00:17,848
uh, Soren Johnson, uh, and these are probably, uh, these are the

4
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:21,329
basically four major games I worked on. Uh, probably most

5
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:24,670
notably I was the lead designer of Civ 4, uh, and I wrote most

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,772
of the gaming and AI code for that as well. Um, and who I am

7
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:33,373
now, I hope this isn't a little too on the nose, but I'm, uh,

8
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:35,134
the founder of Moja Games.

9
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:40,070
and we are developing a economic RTS right now,

10
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,312
which we'll probably be talking more about sometime later this year.

11
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:48,955
And another way to describe that is an RTS without units.

12
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:52,538
And if you're curious about that, just ask me about it after the session.

13
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,800
So, let's talk about video games.

14
00:00:58,021 --> 00:00:59,542
You know, like these video games.

15
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:01,723
But when you see these games,

16
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:05,125
do you think of video games, or do you think of something else?

17
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:07,496
For example, card hunter.

18
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:11,537
When you see this, perhaps you think about D&D.

19
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:16,838
Or when you see Hearthstone, perhaps you think about magic.

20
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:23,140
When you see Hero Academy, you might think about miniatures.

21
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:26,661
When you see Battle of the Bulge,

22
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:31,482
you might think about old school SPI Avalon Hill war games.

23
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,233
And I'd like to take a moment to look at this incredible picture here.

24
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:40,636
If you notice on that board, I count two calculators and four sets of tweezers.

25
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:47,139
We've lost something, I think, in gaming.

26
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,181
All right, so what are these? What are these games?

27
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:56,603
They are often described as board games, but strictly speaking, these are video games.

28
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,963
So consider Days of Wonder, you know, which is a very successful board game publisher.

29
00:02:01,983 --> 00:02:05,046
You know, they make Ticket to Ride, for example, which is a great game.

30
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:11,693
However, Ticket to Ride, the app, outsells Ticket to Ride, the board game, by 3 to 1.

31
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:16,878
You know, it's perhaps not a fair comparison, but still, you could ask, you know,

32
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:19,741
is Days of Wonder a board game company or a video game company?

33
00:02:21,176 --> 00:02:25,360
Another way to put this is, are board games defined by their physical components?

34
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:29,164
And if board games are supposed to be physical,

35
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:34,609
then why do people still think of those video games I was talking about earlier as board games?

36
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:40,816
What I'd like to argue here today is that board games are defined by their transparency.

37
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:44,119
So let me talk about a few examples to clarify that point.

38
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,883
So here's Memoir 44, and these are the dice you roll when you

39
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:52,745
attack in that game. And the results are very direct. You

40
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:55,207
know, you see an infantry unit, that means you kill an

41
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:58,770
infantry unit. You see a flag, that means you retreat. You see

42
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,491
a picture of a tank, that means you can kill a tank.

43
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:08,594
Here's Agricola. In this game, you have these various resource piles which build up from turn to turn.

44
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:16,861
And so you have a very direct sense that you might want to grab that clay because now there's a giant stack of clay there.

45
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:19,564
It draws the player's attention.

46
00:03:21,305 --> 00:03:27,751
Here's Power Grid, a game which has a very transparent and simple model of supply and demand.

47
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:35,314
this track here that runs along the bottom of the board, you see a bunch of sort of wooden markers.

48
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:41,978
The black cubes represent coal, the brown is oil, the red is uranium, the yellow is garbage.

49
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:45,880
And each of these different boxes you see represents a different price.

50
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,563
So all the cubes that are in the far left box here are available for $1.

51
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:57,166
But as players pick those cubes off the track, the price goes

52
00:03:57,286 --> 00:03:59,687
up. And that's represented directly by the fact that you

53
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:02,248
look where the far, you know, the cube farthest to the left

54
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,449
is, it's in the box labeled 2. So that means it costs $2.

55
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,611
You know, as you move further, you know, it costs $3.

56
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:11,652
You know, and eventually you can get all the way to the end

57
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:14,433
here, and it's going to be cost, you know, it'll be costing

58
00:04:14,593 --> 00:04:17,334
$8. And it might not even be available at all, uh, if

59
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:19,935
someone, you know, decides to just buy up all of the, all of

60
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:21,896
the coal that's available. Um...

61
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:27,438
Furthermore, each turn you are also adding resources back into the system,

62
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:29,139
which represents supply.

63
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:33,620
So every turn you're picking tiles up, or picking cubes up and moving it to the right,

64
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,840
and then you're adding them back, moving them down to the left.

65
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,561
So you see directly how the prices go up and how the prices go down,

66
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:43,882
and it's very transparent to see how that's a direct result of player action.

67
00:04:44,922 --> 00:04:47,703
So thus, here we have a very simple, transparent mechanic

68
00:04:48,063 --> 00:04:51,924
that models the free market pressures of supply, demand, and scarcity.

69
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:59,992
This is Shogun, a game that resolves its combat using this cube tower,

70
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:05,380
and uses it to model the randomness of combat and also to mess with players' expectations.

71
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:08,336
And I'm going to go into some depth here.

72
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:10,998
So here's a look inside the tower.

73
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,879
So you see it's got these, I'm not

74
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,821
even sure what to call them, but sort of these floors

75
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:17,642
that you insert inside the tower that

76
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:18,842
have these different holes in them.

77
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:21,124
And that's there to sort of randomize

78
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:24,366
the process of throwing these wooden cubes into the tower

79
00:05:24,446 --> 00:05:25,827
and seeing what comes out in the bottom.

80
00:05:27,988 --> 00:05:30,329
So here's a look at it directly from the top.

81
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,831
And you see it can take quite a winding path

82
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:33,652
to get down to the bottom.

83
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,593
So over the course of the game, let's say the blue player attacks the red player,

84
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:43,535
you're moving 12 cubes against 7.

85
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:48,638
So then what you do, you know, is you take those cubes off the board,

86
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:54,221
you set up the cube tower, you mix them all together, and then...

87
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:59,238
you toss them in the tower. Now some of those cubes will come out and some of them won't.

88
00:06:00,518 --> 00:06:04,341
And, you know, all you have to do is count up, you know, however many cubes, you know,

89
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:09,144
the cubes of the two different players and whoever has the most wins. You know, believe

90
00:06:09,164 --> 00:06:15,168
it or not, if you remember early on, a blue actually had 12 cubes. So half of his cubes

91
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:18,570
actually got stuck in the tower, whereas all of red's cubes came out, which is...

92
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,973
pretty unusual result. But I actually did this, this was my first attempt doing this to take

93
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:29,536
these shots. And that's just how it worked out. And so poor blue player, you see, he could come

94
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,998
back and look down and there are all his cubes stuck inside the tower of no use to him.

95
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:37,594
However, the thing that's really interesting about Shogun

96
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,675
is you don't then dump the cubes out of the tower

97
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:41,715
so you have an empty tower.

98
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,836
What you actually do is you leave them in the tower

99
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:45,816
over the course of the rest of the game.

100
00:06:46,397 --> 00:06:48,717
So for the next combat, let's say Yellow

101
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:51,538
decides to attack Blue, four cubes to two.

102
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:54,619
Well, you mix all those cubes together.

103
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,240
You drop them in the tower.

104
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,401
But remember, Blue still has six cubes stuck inside the tower.

105
00:07:01,781 --> 00:07:04,705
And sure enough, blue gets some of those old cubes to fall out

106
00:07:05,145 --> 00:07:06,147
and ends up winning the battle.

107
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:10,853
And now yellow has a cube stuck inside the tower.

108
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:16,640
The physicality of which cubes come out or stay inside

109
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,064
creates an unpredictable but transparent combat system.

110
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:25,330
What makes this system so interesting is that the players can, and of course do,

111
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,071
peek into the tower during the game to see which player still has cubes inside the tower,

112
00:07:30,571 --> 00:07:32,852
which affects their decision-making about who to attack.

113
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:37,873
When Blue lost a very tough battle by having six cubes stuck inside the tower, that hurt.

114
00:07:38,313 --> 00:07:41,654
But the upside was that the other players would be afraid to attack Blue

115
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:44,035
until all those blue cubes come out of the tower.

116
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:49,356
Essentially, Blue gets a short-term combat bonus, which will change how everyone plays.

117
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:53,539
That's an interesting mechanic, but what is really interesting about Shogun

118
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:59,343
is how the simplicity and transparency of the cube tower

119
00:07:59,664 --> 00:08:01,105
creates all this depth in gameplay.

120
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:06,069
So I'd like to talk about these two games for a little bit,

121
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:08,090
Race for the Galaxy and Innovation.

122
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:13,455
And these two games are both based around a set of cards

123
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:16,257
which have essentially rules printed on them.

124
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:18,799
But they both do it in very different ways.

125
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:22,043
So when you play a game of innovation,

126
00:08:22,744 --> 00:08:24,325
the board looks something like this.

127
00:08:25,386 --> 00:08:27,247
And you see there's sort of five different colors

128
00:08:27,347 --> 00:08:29,268
for the different types of technologies.

129
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:31,730
And you see the sort of player in the bottom left,

130
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,512
he has sort of all these cards splayed out on the table.

131
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:38,015
But essentially the sort of active technology

132
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:39,496
is the one that's on the top.

133
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:41,957
And that's the one that's sort of relevant to play

134
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:43,899
at this specific time.

135
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,681
And this is what these cards look like.

136
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:50,325
the rules on the card are communicated as text.

137
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:54,148
Thus, each card can have a completely unique power.

138
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:58,410
And in a four-player game, if you're talking about

139
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,812
five active technologies, that means you could have

140
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:03,934
20 unique rules in play at any one time,

141
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:06,135
which can also change from turn to turn.

142
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,744
Now, the cognitive load of trying to understand the state of the board here is immense.

143
00:09:13,326 --> 00:09:17,510
A new player who wants to be competitive has to essentially force the game to a crawl to

144
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,132
make sure each card has been read and understood.

145
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:24,697
And often, sort of the social cost of doing that is simply too high.

146
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:28,699
you know, and a lot of new players just, well, okay, you know, let's just keep the game rolling.

147
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:32,722
I'm not going to actually take the time to understand, you know, all the pieces on the board

148
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:36,784
and what they mean because, you know, I'd have to literally read these, you know,

149
00:09:36,804 --> 00:09:41,607
two to three sentence descriptions on each card and, you know, that's just, that's just not,

150
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:44,368
you know, that's just not going to work. That's going to slow the game down too much.

151
00:09:44,828 --> 00:09:48,831
But they're essentially just accepting the fact that they're going to be playing the game poorly.

152
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:52,553
Because if you don't understand, you know, what the cards, what the cards do,

153
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:54,614
you're not necessarily going to be making the right decisions.

154
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,970
Now, Race for the Galaxy is not so different.

155
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:02,452
Each player can have up to 12 cards in play at once.

156
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:08,014
Although the cards are, each of the cards in Innovation

157
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:08,515
is unique.

158
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,496
In Race for the Galaxy, there are duplicates in the deck.

159
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,057
So you don't quite have the same uniqueness problem.

160
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:15,578
But here's the big difference.

161
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:17,799
Let's look at the Race for the Galaxy cards.

162
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,560
So you see, these cards do not have text.

163
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:28,470
Instead, the designer has sort of invented this iconographic grammar to communicate the rules.

164
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:33,196
So if you look closely at these cards, you'll see certain patterns repeated.

165
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:35,218
You know, whenever you see a hand holding a card...

166
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:36,572
That means you draw a card.

167
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:39,535
If you see a little circle, which is a symbol for a planet,

168
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:42,297
with a minus 1, that means it costs one less

169
00:10:42,397 --> 00:10:44,179
to colonize that planet.

170
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,322
Red is the symbol for military.

171
00:10:47,362 --> 00:10:48,943
So if you see a plus 1 that's red,

172
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,624
that means you get an extra military point.

173
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,906
And here's the thing.

174
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:56,509
This card here basically collects

175
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,272
all of these iconographic rules in one place.

176
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:00,833
And now,

177
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:04,763
To be clear, this is actually a pretty big demand on the player to,

178
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:06,168
okay, you want to play this game,

179
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,695
you now need to learn this language before starting.

180
00:11:09,908 --> 00:11:17,431
However, I would argue that this is actually preferable to simply describing everything in text as an innovation,

181
00:11:18,252 --> 00:11:25,835
because the self-imposed constraint of a limited grammar keeps the designer from special casing, from over-designing the game.

182
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:30,437
In Race for the Galaxy, there are going to be sort of these natural sets of cards,

183
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:34,779
like, oh, here's some research cards, and here's some military cards, and here are some production cards.

184
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:37,860
And in your mind, you can kind of group all those together.

185
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:39,874
and think of them in the same way.

186
00:11:39,894 --> 00:11:42,815
You know, they'll have these interesting subtle variations,

187
00:11:43,195 --> 00:11:44,656
and they'll be hybrid cards,

188
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:48,777
but you have these sort of schema or archetypes in your mind

189
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:52,238
to use when you're considering what to do with these cards.

190
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:53,999
In innovation,

191
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:57,352
Every card is an island, essentially.

192
00:11:57,652 --> 00:12:00,413
There's nothing limiting the designer from doing something

193
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:03,315
that's just radically different and unexpected with each card.

194
00:12:04,195 --> 00:12:06,536
And indeed, that's what you see with some of the cards

195
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:07,036
innovation.

196
00:12:07,136 --> 00:12:10,537
Because there wasn't that self-imposed constraint,

197
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:15,199
the designer was able to kind of just over-design the cards

198
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:17,740
and make the game very heavy and difficult to understand.

199
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,663
They weren't committing to the advantage of having a consistent grammar.

200
00:12:23,884 --> 00:12:25,946
So, if you think about video games,

201
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,688
they can have their own grammars as well.

202
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:33,752
In Thief, Garrett's main method of interacting with the world is via arrows,

203
00:12:34,113 --> 00:12:36,435
which is really its own type of gameplay grammar.

204
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:40,938
The designers could, of course, come up with completely unique ways

205
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,920
for the player to douse torches,

206
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:46,003
cause distractions like fires and so on.

207
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:51,257
You could have it so, you know, Garrett could snuff out a torch with his hand, for example.

208
00:12:52,477 --> 00:12:55,738
However, by limiting Garrett's agency to just his arrows,

209
00:12:56,358 --> 00:13:04,880
the cognitive load is reduced on the player because the player understands that he can start a fire simply because Garrett has a fire arrow.

210
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,741
That is all the player needs to know.

211
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:13,902
They just simply look in the backpack, I have a fire arrow.

212
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:15,416
What do arrows do?

213
00:13:15,556 --> 00:13:18,177
You know, they cause an effect on something in the distance.

214
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:18,957
It's fire.

215
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:21,238
I know what's going to happen when I launch it.

216
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:23,258
As opposed, the player is not going

217
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:25,679
to imagine a bunch of interactions

218
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,619
that the game simply doesn't allow.

219
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,820
You know, he's just simply going to see,

220
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,120
these are the type of arrows available.

221
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,521
Now I know what is possible to do in this world.

222
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:43,526
So, in contrast, Call of Duty is an example of a game that has a heavily scripted single-player campaign.

223
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:46,611
And it doesn't really have a grammar.

224
00:13:47,382 --> 00:13:53,186
Anything can happen at any time, so the player never expects that the rules can even be understood.

225
00:13:54,727 --> 00:14:00,691
And, you know, is basically that the equivalent of the cars in innovation is, you know,

226
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:02,753
there is no system that runs in the player's head.

227
00:14:03,273 --> 00:14:04,694
There isn't really something to be understood.

228
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:06,395
There's just something really to be consumed.

229
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:11,945
So a game's rules are what keep the player engaged

230
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,366
with the actual game part of the game,

231
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:17,187
as opposed to simply consuming the scripted content.

232
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:20,048
Thus, it's very important that the rules themselves

233
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:21,749
be consistent and transparent.

234
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,910
So now I'd like to talk about Yomi for a little bit.

235
00:14:26,571 --> 00:14:29,932
Yomi was designed by noted fighting game player

236
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:31,713
and designer David Serlin.

237
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:39,674
And Yomi is essentially his attempt to expose the core high-level mechanics of a fighting game

238
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:45,881
to an audience that doesn't have either the dexterity or the free time to master such demanding games.

239
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:48,931
and this is basically in his own words here,

240
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:52,613
competitive games tend to shut out most of the population

241
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:54,674
because they tack on extra skill tests.

242
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,936
Street Fighter, for example, requires so much dexterity

243
00:14:57,976 --> 00:15:00,057
with the joystick that most potential players

244
00:15:00,177 --> 00:15:03,219
are not able to experience the interesting mental challenges

245
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,460
at the core of the game.

246
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,222
I want to extract those great mind games

247
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,263
and offer them to everyone, not just the few

248
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:11,224
who can pass the other extraneous tests.

249
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:20,102
So, what he did then was he made this transparent abstraction of that inner game inside of fighting games.

250
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:25,266
He boiled it down to this sort of rock, paper, scissors-like simplicity.

251
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:34,134
And then, in a deck of Yomi cards, each card is explicitly categorized as belonging to one of those four types.

252
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:39,984
And I'd like to draw special attention to the graphic design here.

253
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:43,208
Usually, like as in a card game like Magic,

254
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,073
the name of the card is put up in the upper left-hand corner of a card.

255
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:48,995
That's sort of almost a standard.

256
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:52,799
Here, however, it's in the upper right, almost as an afterthought.

257
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,023
What is actually important is that it's an attack card.

258
00:15:57,084 --> 00:15:59,488
along with the various stats for that specific card.

259
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:02,252
So a player sees this card and he thinks,

260
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:04,916
ah, it's an attack card of value four.

261
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:08,201
She doesn't think of it as spectral pull.

262
00:16:08,982 --> 00:16:12,026
Serlin is making this categorization transparent.

263
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:18,920
So, you know, in fact, nowadays you can actually play a digital version of Yomi,

264
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,662
which means you're playing a video game version of a card game that abstracts a different video game.

265
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,204
That's how it goes.

266
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:29,506
So the important lesson of Yomi is that games have a core inner game

267
00:16:29,546 --> 00:16:31,908
that is often invisible to casual players.

268
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:36,531
And so it's important to make that inner game transparent as much as possible.

269
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,052
Abstraction is a great tool for teaching,

270
00:16:39,252 --> 00:16:42,555
which is what's necessary to bridge the gap between novices and experts.

271
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:50,734
So let's talk about Magic. Magic is a collectible card game which is notable for having a rich

272
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:57,762
metagame composed of drafting and deck building. And for those of you who don't know, deck

273
00:16:57,802 --> 00:17:01,927
building means that, you know, you have a deck of 45 cards you bring to a magic game

274
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:03,950
and they can be pulled from...

275
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:08,605
you know, the existing world of millions, I suppose, of magic cards.

276
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,167
You know, it's up to you to build your own deck.

277
00:17:10,728 --> 00:17:13,570
Drafting means that before you build this deck of 45 cards,

278
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:17,794
what you do is you pull up a hand of, say, 15 cards,

279
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:21,618
and you pick one, and then you hand the cards that you did not pick

280
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:23,120
to one of your, you know,

281
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,341
the player to your right or whatever and then you keep doing that so you're basically taking turns

282
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:32,383
building your deck one after another and you see as you draft you also see not just the cards you

283
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:36,904
pick but you notice which cards are missing so you know what cards your opponent is picking as well.

284
00:17:38,504 --> 00:17:42,766
Now it's important to note that these aspects of magic are not part of the core rule set.

285
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:46,967
In other words it is not necessary to do either one to play magic

286
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:51,268
but the game would not have become nearly as possible without this type of meta gaming.

287
00:17:53,554 --> 00:17:56,115
So, let's say you want to build a great magic duck.

288
00:17:57,436 --> 00:18:00,818
The problem is that there are a lot of cards to choose from.

289
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:03,379
There's a lot of cards.

290
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,581
Really, there are so many cards.

291
00:18:07,497 --> 00:18:12,743
you know, and what are you going to do with all these extra cards? And not to mention, there's

292
00:18:12,763 --> 00:18:19,650
the problem of scarcity. See, there's a card up for sale for $6,200. I don't know if it's sold for

293
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,915
that or something else, but, you know, that's what you can see with magic cards.

294
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:31,071
So, the metagame is fun. That's really what drives a lot of the interest for magic.

295
00:18:31,312 --> 00:18:34,374
You know, but is it visible and accessible to most players?

296
00:18:35,174 --> 00:18:40,137
Will I really ever be able to actually experience magic without committing to it as a lifestyle choice?

297
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:47,002
So, what we've learned recently is the metagame can be an actual game instead.

298
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:51,705
Seven Wonders and Dominions split the metagame of magic between them,

299
00:18:52,145 --> 00:18:55,427
making each part transparent and accessible to everyone.

300
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:59,999
Dominion turned deck building into gameplay

301
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,081
by making the deck building the actual game instead of the thing

302
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:06,301
you do before the game.

303
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:09,863
Deck building is hugely intimidating for new players.

304
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:12,444
And Dominion solves that problem by letting players

305
00:19:12,504 --> 00:19:14,905
do it one step at a time, all out in the open.

306
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:18,186
Beginners can see what cards the veterans are buying

307
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:19,007
and in what order.

308
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:21,508
And even if they never catch up, they at least

309
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:22,948
get to see how the winner won.

310
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:26,974
Seven Wonders did the same thing for drafting,

311
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:29,416
by making drafting the actual game instead of the thing

312
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:30,677
you do before the game.

313
00:19:31,278 --> 00:19:32,999
The process is that you draft a card,

314
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:34,801
and then you play it immediately face up.

315
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,702
So just like in Dominion, the player

316
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,263
gets to take it one step at a time

317
00:19:38,383 --> 00:19:40,845
and see what everyone else is drafting each turn.

318
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,604
So it's a form of essentially learning while drafting.

319
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,568
And drafting is now no longer scary.

320
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:49,130
Instead, it's a transparent process.

321
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:51,193
And players will much more quickly learn

322
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:52,656
some of the subtleties of drafting,

323
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:55,339
such as hate drafting, by picking a card

324
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,082
that you know will hurt your opponent.

325
00:19:57,672 --> 00:19:59,513
by not having been rather than helping you,

326
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,875
you know, and then still comes out as a net win.

327
00:20:01,895 --> 00:20:05,897
You know, that's something that you can pick up and feel

328
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,218
as you're playing Seven Wonders,

329
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:09,019
even though that's something that's, you know,

330
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,860
not really a beginner strategy

331
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,061
as you learn to draft in Magic.

332
00:20:15,462 --> 00:20:18,044
So, the concept of making gameplay processes

333
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,124
visible to all players

334
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:20,965
raises an interesting question

335
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:24,027
about something most strategy games take for granted.

336
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:25,705
with the fog of war.

337
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:29,930
It's almost trivial to implement in a video game,

338
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:33,435
and of course, almost impossible to do well in a board game.

339
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:37,080
So it's usually an automatic choice for video game designers

340
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,562
to add fog of war to their games,

341
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:41,746
because hey, it's this great thing that only we can do.

342
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:49,829
However, there is sort of a hidden cost to Fog of War in that new players don't get to see how the veterans are winning.

343
00:20:50,630 --> 00:21:06,375
Replays help, of course, but the typical RTS experience for many is sort of this quiet early game where you're building up and, you know, dropping down some barracks and mining some minerals and building some units, you know, and then suddenly, you know, this happens.

344
00:21:08,493 --> 00:21:08,874
Now the...

345
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:14,135
That's a nice thing.

346
00:21:14,415 --> 00:21:18,316
The RTS we're building right now actually has no fog of war.

347
00:21:19,176 --> 00:21:25,138
Players learn by watching each other, and of course fog of war sort of runs counter to that.

348
00:21:25,538 --> 00:21:30,100
Now there are important reasons why you have fog of war in RTS games.

349
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,820
There's no avoiding that, and it's not something that's going to go away.

350
00:21:33,314 --> 00:21:38,017
But perhaps mainstream RTS designers should consider simply

351
00:21:38,237 --> 00:21:40,639
shipping with an option to disable it just for sort of

352
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,221
learning matches where you're helping people play.

353
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:46,504
But there is this important core issue here where you don't

354
00:21:46,544 --> 00:21:48,305
want to hide what's going on.

355
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:51,948
It's not necessarily a great thing to hide all the

356
00:21:51,988 --> 00:21:54,049
interesting stuff that's happening in the game just for

357
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:58,192
sort of some sort of strategic mechanic, which is what you

358
00:21:58,212 --> 00:21:58,953
get out of Fog of War.

359
00:22:00,915 --> 00:22:04,656
So ultimately, the ultimate point, the important point here is that transparent mechanics

360
00:22:05,036 --> 00:22:10,797
increase a player's comfort with a game. Don't ask your players to make a bunch of crucial

361
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:15,658
decisions like drafting a complete magic deck before they've even experienced the game itself.

362
00:22:16,158 --> 00:22:19,519
This has always been a bit of an issue for how do you get new players into magic, right?

363
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:20,399
You know, you can't...

364
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,261
what you're gonna tell somebody who's never played the game

365
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,402
how they should build their deck.

366
00:22:24,562 --> 00:22:25,543
It's basically impossible.

367
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,405
You sort of basically have to build a deck for them

368
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:29,106
and just drop them into the match.

369
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:32,169
And then, you know, eventually they'll be able to understand

370
00:22:32,189 --> 00:22:33,310
that there's a meta game involved.

371
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,551
But it's almost like telling you

372
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:35,652
that this is this great game,

373
00:22:35,712 --> 00:22:36,792
but you aren't gonna be able to get to it

374
00:22:36,852 --> 00:22:38,274
until you go through the, you know,

375
00:22:38,294 --> 00:22:39,735
just go through these sort of road steps

376
00:22:39,755 --> 00:22:41,316
of learning the basics first.

377
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:45,099
So now I'd like to talk about

378
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,741
two different kinds of luck-founded games,

379
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:50,824
which is very explicitly visible in board games.

380
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:56,884
So pre-luck is talking about some sort of random event

381
00:22:56,944 --> 00:23:00,347
happens in the game, and then the player makes a decision

382
00:23:00,407 --> 00:23:02,308
or chooses an action based on that result.

383
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,970
So this game here is Alien Frontiers,

384
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:07,292
and it has a very clear version of pre-luck.

385
00:23:08,878 --> 00:23:14,145
It's a bit like crossing Yahtzee with Agricola, as you'll see here.

386
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:19,711
So basically, the player rolls the dice, and then these dice themselves are the workers.

387
00:23:20,853 --> 00:23:24,758
And so then the player then gets to decide how to place them on the board, depending upon the roll.

388
00:23:25,627 --> 00:23:27,749
So you have these different areas on the board,

389
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:29,610
and they all have different rules for how

390
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,711
you can place the dice in them.

391
00:23:30,991 --> 00:23:33,552
So for example, the colony of constructor

392
00:23:33,793 --> 00:23:34,753
takes three of a kind.

393
00:23:35,173 --> 00:23:37,375
The orbital market takes two of a kind.

394
00:23:38,476 --> 00:23:39,957
And the important thing here is that luck

395
00:23:40,017 --> 00:23:43,119
creates a situation from which the player then

396
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:45,020
reacts, which is not fundamentally

397
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,281
different from, say, encountering a random map

398
00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:48,022
in a game of sip.

399
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,545
So post-luck, on the other hand, involves the player

400
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:54,706
making a decision and then.

401
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:59,416
excuse me. And then a random event determines the outcome.

402
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,710
So risk is sort of a classic example of this, right?

403
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,690
Because the player decides which country to attack,

404
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,551
moves in the units, and then rolls the dice

405
00:24:09,631 --> 00:24:10,511
to determine the outcome.

406
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:15,152
Now, I don't want to go so far as to say that pre-luck is good

407
00:24:15,232 --> 00:24:16,192
and post-luck is bad.

408
00:24:16,812 --> 00:24:19,533
But games with pre-luck tend to be more engaging,

409
00:24:19,953 --> 00:24:22,093
because the player gets to think and to adapt

410
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:25,034
to make the best of a bad roll or to take

411
00:24:25,054 --> 00:24:26,114
advantage of a great one.

412
00:24:26,835 --> 00:24:31,365
Post-luck games, on the other hand, can often make the players end up feeling like victims.

413
00:24:34,354 --> 00:24:37,275
So the combat system, you know, looking at video games here,

414
00:24:37,335 --> 00:24:40,556
the combat system of RPGs often tend to favor post-luck,

415
00:24:41,316 --> 00:24:43,817
with players basically choosing the same few abilities

416
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:45,717
and spells over and over again.

417
00:24:45,757 --> 00:24:48,558
And then the random number generator determines the result.

418
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:52,159
The most interesting decisions get made when you're basically,

419
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:53,940
when you're leveling up your character,

420
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,120
you know, when you're essentially choosing your build.

421
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,381
That's when you make the decisions.

422
00:24:57,781 --> 00:24:59,121
And then the actual combat,

423
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:01,322
which unfortunately is what you're doing most of the time,

424
00:25:01,762 --> 00:25:02,682
is somewhat rote.

425
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:08,406
card hunter provides a really interesting alternative. Each

426
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:12,549
player, the, basically your spells and abilities are

427
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:15,971
represented essentially as a deck of cards. And each turn

428
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:19,733
you're kind of drawing five from that deck and so even if you

429
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:22,555
have some powers available that you really want to use, they may

430
00:25:22,595 --> 00:25:25,217
or may not be available depending upon what hand of

431
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,438
cards you draw, you drew.

432
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:34,916
Therefore, a player gets a different set of options to choose from each turn, which can make the gameplay much more varied and dynamic.

433
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:47,751
So the big point here is, pre-luck is a great way to give the player a clear set of interesting decisions, often by limiting which ones are available at each decision point.

434
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,943
So I sort of moved through some great uses of transparency

435
00:25:54,243 --> 00:25:55,583
in board games.

436
00:25:56,424 --> 00:26:00,026
And here are kind of the main points I pulled upon.

437
00:26:00,106 --> 00:26:03,228
And I'm going to transition now to talking about video games.

438
00:26:03,968 --> 00:26:07,570
But I'd just like to review that transparent, consistent rules

439
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,991
run in the player's head, creating engagement.

440
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:15,097
Transparent abstraction focuses players on the inner game.

441
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:18,538
Transparent visible mechanics increase player comfort.

442
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,999
And pre-luck is a transparent way

443
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,420
to present interesting decisions.

444
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,961
These are all really valuable lessons

445
00:26:25,021 --> 00:26:27,061
I think can be applied to games of all type.

446
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:31,943
So let's get back to talking about what

447
00:26:31,983 --> 00:26:35,204
this all means for video games.

448
00:26:35,324 --> 00:26:36,244
Real video games.

449
00:26:37,685 --> 00:26:40,326
Not ones that could be mistaken for board games.

450
00:26:41,274 --> 00:26:44,097
But first I'd like to ask, what connects these games?

451
00:26:45,718 --> 00:26:47,720
Well, these four games, they're all story-driven.

452
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,763
You have authored levels, fixed progression.

453
00:26:51,664 --> 00:26:54,747
And it's important to note here that I'm not

454
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:55,548
talking about budget.

455
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:02,335
You know, all 80 of these games essentially fall within this category.

456
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:06,997
And what that means is that these games are static.

457
00:27:07,837 --> 00:27:10,879
Static means that the game world is authored, set in stone.

458
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,360
Each player is going to be confronted with the same experience.

459
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,863
Even if they experience it in different ways, there is sort of this static world.

460
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:24,445
And furthermore, they're meant to be finished, to be consumed.

461
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:31,553
but games can be dynamic. So what do I mean by dynamic?

462
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:36,275
Dynamic games are unpredictable, rules driven, challenging.

463
00:27:36,995 --> 00:27:42,197
They are meant to be replayed, to be mastered. However, it's

464
00:27:42,237 --> 00:27:45,058
not, it's not necessarily black and white, it's, it's a

465
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:45,538
continuum.

466
00:27:48,265 --> 00:27:50,226
Some static games use dynamic systems.

467
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:54,247
These games here have stories and author progression,

468
00:27:54,688 --> 00:27:56,208
but the dynamic game systems mean

469
00:27:56,228 --> 00:27:58,549
that the player's experience will be more varied.

470
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,271
On the other hand, some dynamic games use static content.

471
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:06,272
These dynamic games are highly replayable,

472
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:10,473
but make use of static content like maps, or tracks,

473
00:28:10,593 --> 00:28:11,013
and so on.

474
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:14,895
Of course, there's lots of room for debate.

475
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:20,168
you know, perhaps swapping these, you know, is correct.

476
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:24,171
You know, at least in single player, Starcraft 2 is a very

477
00:28:24,231 --> 00:28:27,613
static game. There is a mostly linear set of levels which are

478
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:31,236
meant to be solved in a specific way. Dragon Age, on the other

479
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:34,338
hand, changes a great deal depending on the player's

480
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:40,443
companions, story choices, and chosen skills. However, this is

481
00:28:40,463 --> 00:28:42,685
definitely, excuse me.

482
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,382
myself. So there's lots of room for debate. However, this is

483
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:50,445
definitely wrong. You know, there's no way you can argue

484
00:28:50,485 --> 00:28:53,708
that Last of Us is a dynamic game or that Civilization is a

485
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:58,693
static game. So what's really important here is that you

486
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:01,876
understand the extremes of the continuum. You know, what it

487
00:29:01,936 --> 00:29:04,919
means to be a static game, what it means to be a dynamic game.

488
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:08,577
And here is, this is what I think is the most important point.

489
00:29:09,378 --> 00:29:12,722
For static games, the content is of primary importance.

490
00:29:13,323 --> 00:29:16,347
And for dynamic games, the mechanics are of primary importance.

491
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:20,276
And so I'm mostly concerned here,

492
00:29:20,296 --> 00:29:22,198
in this talk in general, when I'm talking about

493
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,380
the importance of transparency and what we can learn

494
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,862
from board games, I'm mostly concerned about dynamic games.

495
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:32,424
So not all of these lessons can be applied broadly

496
00:29:32,824 --> 00:29:35,506
to all games at once, but they're gonna be

497
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:40,169
most applicable to games on the right side of the spectrum.

498
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,272
So what engages the player with the dynamics,

499
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:46,193
with the mechanics of a dynamic game?

500
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:50,379
Well, I'd like to say that transparency is the key factor.

501
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:57,749
Spelunky, for example, is very upfront about what tools and challenges the players will have

502
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:02,215
and how they interact, even if separate playthroughs is radically different.

503
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:11,591
And you know, there's lots of great examples here of, you know, good transparency and bad transparency in video games.

504
00:30:12,091 --> 00:30:17,516
So if you look at the Civ series as a whole, combat was a real mystery with Civ I.

505
00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:19,598
You got a lot of unexpected results.

506
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:22,661
A lot of phalanxes destroying battleships.

507
00:30:23,882 --> 00:30:25,943
You got, you know, wildly divergent outcomes.

508
00:30:26,004 --> 00:30:30,608
There was this whole collateral damage rule, which was that, you know, if I had a stack of ten units...

509
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:34,211
and you attacked me and you killed the unit on the top,

510
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:35,473
all the rest got destroyed,

511
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:38,236
which was usually quite a shock to players

512
00:30:38,256 --> 00:30:39,377
who didn't know about that rule.

513
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,261
And so as the series moved forward.

514
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:47,626
we moved more and more towards transparency. Uh and when we got

515
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:50,750
to Civ 4 there was sort of a key you could hit when you moused

516
00:30:50,871 --> 00:30:53,655
over a potential battle. Uh that would show you directly these

517
00:30:53,715 --> 00:30:56,158
are the odds, these are your odds of winning this battle.

518
00:30:56,178 --> 00:30:58,661
You know they're 80 percent and these are the different

519
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:01,145
modifiers uh for the, for that battle.

520
00:31:01,773 --> 00:31:06,836
you know, and after the battle was fought, there was a battle log you could look at which would actually explain all the roles.

521
00:31:07,516 --> 00:31:15,941
And then Civ V did a wonderful job with sort of this very simple, transparent piece of UI

522
00:31:16,322 --> 00:31:21,665
that you would see before combat that showed you, you know, the approximate damage that's going to be inflected.

523
00:31:22,265 --> 00:31:24,567
Your strength, their strength, what are the different modifiers.

524
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:37,815
We always felt like player engagement went up the more open and transparent we made the rules and the aspects of combat.

525
00:31:38,015 --> 00:31:44,883
The more the players were able to understand ahead of time what is the potential result of the action that they are choosing.

526
00:31:47,183 --> 00:31:50,304
So here's another couple examples of games that both had

527
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:57,045
a global scale. The one on the left here is Sim Earth. It had a

528
00:31:57,105 --> 00:32:00,486
lot of complex interrelated systems that were hard to

529
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:04,127
describe and hard to understand. A lot of chaos theory and

530
00:32:04,607 --> 00:32:07,368
snowballing. If you look closely at the screen there, there's a

531
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:11,229
very helpful diagram that talks about carbon dioxide absorption

532
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:14,549
and thermal tolerance and, you know, very simple, easy stuff to

533
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:14,810
grasp.

534
00:32:17,064 --> 00:32:20,787
Defcon on the other hand uh simplifies the globe to just the

535
00:32:20,868 --> 00:32:23,870
bare, it's a beautifully designed game, just the bare

536
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,833
minimum amount of information required to play the game. Um

537
00:32:26,973 --> 00:32:29,535
and you just use subtle points like for example the missile

538
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:32,978
trails. Um when you look, when you look at missile moving you

539
00:32:32,998 --> 00:32:35,560
don't just see where it's headed but you also see where it came

540
00:32:35,641 --> 00:32:39,584
from. You know there's a lot of, of information uh present in

541
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,427
the, the, the few bits of, of, of data visible to you.

542
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:52,903
interface is a great place to employ transparency, to shed a

543
00:32:52,944 --> 00:32:56,445
window on the system in the background. These UI elements

544
00:32:56,525 --> 00:33:01,608
here both highlight sort of chunky, as you say, boolean

545
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:04,729
based aspects of the game design. You know, a critical

546
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:10,372
hit in Team Fort 2 is a distinct event. And so they really

547
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:12,193
highlight that directly every time that happens.

548
00:33:13,554 --> 00:33:15,896
you know, opening and accepting a quest in WoW

549
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,378
leads to a very distinct state.

550
00:33:18,698 --> 00:33:20,259
And so, you know, that exclamation point

551
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:22,401
was a, you know, sort of really important innovation

552
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:23,001
in interface.

553
00:33:25,845 --> 00:33:27,866
You can have transparency via systems.

554
00:33:29,186 --> 00:33:32,167
This is one of the reasons physics is very popular

555
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:35,928
as a gameplay system, because it's

556
00:33:35,948 --> 00:33:37,129
sort of inherently transparent.

557
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:39,029
All you have to do is be human and know

558
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:41,270
what it means to fall down, and try to get up,

559
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,550
and to throw a ball.

560
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:46,492
You already have a sense of how the gameplay is going to work.

561
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,225
And this is an important one here.

562
00:33:50,585 --> 00:33:55,313
You can make your gameplay transparent via theme

563
00:33:55,594 --> 00:33:59,020
if you're smart about how you are positioning your game.

564
00:33:59,741 --> 00:34:01,424
When you told someone, so in a.

565
00:34:02,503 --> 00:34:18,956
In a tower defense game, at its core it's based around the concept of you place down static towers, which then fight slow-moving AI-controlled characters, creeps is what they're called, but basically AI units that are moving in to attack you.

566
00:34:20,217 --> 00:34:29,540
And sometimes those games are very abstract, sometimes they're not, but you know, you'd have to, you still have to sort of teach a player that this, this is the core of the game.

567
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:34,922
You know, you're playing, you're placing down these units that are not going to move, and you're defending against these slow-moving objects.

568
00:34:36,603 --> 00:34:42,585
Well, all you have to do is say the words plants versus zombies, and someone understands that intuitively, right?

569
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:47,012
You know that plants can't move, and you know that zombies do,

570
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:49,133
but they, well, most of the time, they move slowly.

571
00:34:50,273 --> 00:34:53,315
So that pairing was a brilliant way

572
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:56,917
to make the gameplay that existed within the game

573
00:34:56,977 --> 00:34:57,837
transparent to the player.

574
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:04,621
Triple Town is a match three that is sort of a match three.

575
00:35:04,661 --> 00:35:05,761
I'm not sure quite how to describe it,

576
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:10,524
but it's built around these combinations.

577
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:17,409
The match tree is built directly into the game's art by three bushes becoming a shrub,

578
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:20,912
and then three shrubs becoming a tree, and so on.

579
00:35:21,092 --> 00:35:24,475
You know, each of these levels is sort of easy to imagine,

580
00:35:24,535 --> 00:35:27,798
and you sort of anticipate what the next one is,

581
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:31,481
and you even wonder what the one is three or four levels above you.

582
00:35:34,509 --> 00:35:37,153
you can also go a long way, you know, getting transparency via,

583
00:35:37,233 --> 00:35:41,820
via help. Um, so, uh, this is the city screen in Civ, uh, Civ

584
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,246
4, uh, and if you mouse over, uh, the, essentially the, the,

585
00:35:48,222 --> 00:35:52,726
the food in the production bars, which is also sort of where you see your health and your

586
00:35:52,766 --> 00:35:56,669
happiness. In this case, I guess the player is moused over to happiness, you get this

587
00:35:57,709 --> 00:36:03,714
explicit breakdown of all the different factors that explain why the city has 23 happiness

588
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:07,877
and 15 unhappiness. I'm not sure if you can read it, but some of those reasons are, you

589
00:36:07,897 --> 00:36:11,320
know, plus 6 unhappiness because it's too crowded. That means there's too many people in

590
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:16,243
the city. Plus 4 because of war. You know, this war has been going on for too long.

591
00:36:18,631 --> 00:36:22,033
plus one we will not fight with our brothers and sisters in the

592
00:36:22,073 --> 00:36:25,695
faith. That means you're fighting another civ which

593
00:36:25,735 --> 00:36:28,276
happens to be of the same religion as you. On the other

594
00:36:28,296 --> 00:36:32,699
side of the ledger you see things like plus twelve happy.

595
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:35,280
You know we enjoy our luxurious resources. You know all the

596
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,402
furs and the diamonds and the spices that you've been bringing

597
00:36:39,422 --> 00:36:42,564
in the city are making your players happier. You know so

598
00:36:42,584 --> 00:36:46,186
this is a nice way to like you know there's a lot of stuff

599
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:47,486
going on inside a game of civ.

600
00:36:48,048 --> 00:36:49,795
And it's great to have that all broken down

601
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,060
into one specific place.

602
00:36:52,225 --> 00:36:52,948
And this was even.

603
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:58,682
even more true when you're talking about diplomacy in the game. This is the diplomacy game and this

604
00:36:58,722 --> 00:37:04,466
is the diplomacy screen in Civ 4 and diplomacy has always been a very challenging thing in the

605
00:37:04,586 --> 00:37:10,691
in the Civ games because you know there's complicated algorithms going on in the

606
00:37:10,751 --> 00:37:16,155
background controlling you know what the AI is going to do and sometimes those algorithms do

607
00:37:16,195 --> 00:37:19,177
things that even surprise the people who write the code themselves right.

608
00:37:20,758 --> 00:37:34,069
And what we discovered over time is that the more we're able to expose about the reasoning that's going on inside the AI, the more engaged the players come.

609
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:45,158
And this was sort of a hard earned lesson because oftentimes our intuition as designers was that we wanted there to be a little bit of mystery there.

610
00:37:45,824 --> 00:37:51,249
you know, that the AI is supposed to be a replacement for a human, right?

611
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:55,392
And humans are unpredictable, humans have their own quirks,

612
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:59,535
and their own vendettas, and maybe they want to get to revenge,

613
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:03,098
and they... you know, there's a lot of depth to playing a game with a human.

614
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:05,661
And theoretically, the AI is supposed to replace that.

615
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:09,924
But the simple truth is, players know when they're playing an AI.

616
00:38:10,405 --> 00:38:12,106
You know, you're not going to be tricking them.

617
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:15,189
and they have inherently a certain expectation

618
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:17,791
that the AI should behave a certain way.

619
00:38:18,152 --> 00:38:20,273
And if the AI deviates from that,

620
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:22,435
it's important that you're able to explain to them

621
00:38:22,575 --> 00:38:23,336
why that happened.

622
00:38:26,148 --> 00:38:31,193
in this screen here, what I actually originally did, um, you know, there's sort of like five

623
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:37,799
states of diplomacy, uh, of attitudes in Civ 4, you know, from going from, uh, furious to

624
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,224
angry to cautious to pleased to friendly. You know, those are the five different ways the AIs

625
00:38:42,284 --> 00:38:47,609
can, uh, can consider you. Um, and originally that was all we were going to show.

626
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:52,871
But as I was writing the AI to the game, I often was surprised

627
00:38:53,211 --> 00:38:56,632
why a specific AI that I thought should hate me was pleased or

628
00:38:56,932 --> 00:39:00,833
vice versa. So I basically added some debug code so that I can

629
00:39:00,853 --> 00:39:04,514
mouse over that and I could see the numbers behind that. And

630
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:07,735
that was just part of the game for a while and our testers saw

631
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,316
that and you know they

632
00:39:09,856 --> 00:39:13,459
they loved it. That was something they responded very positively to.

633
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:17,181
And anytime we tried to take that away,

634
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,964
it was something that caused a lot of frustration.

635
00:39:21,724 --> 00:39:24,906
And also, beyond that, as soon as this stuff was in there,

636
00:39:25,226 --> 00:39:28,649
we saw just a very different tone when people started talking about

637
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:30,810
the diplomacy in the game.

638
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,391
People were less frustrated.

639
00:39:32,751 --> 00:39:35,151
They were more directly engaged with what was going on.

640
00:39:35,391 --> 00:39:40,013
They were thinking more deeply about what was actually

641
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:45,174
going on in the game, as opposed to a lot of paranoia

642
00:39:45,254 --> 00:39:50,356
and conspiracy theories and a lot of strangeness about the AI.

643
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:52,216
So you see here directly on the screen,

644
00:39:53,897 --> 00:39:56,617
there's a plus for a modifier, because years of peace

645
00:39:56,637 --> 00:39:57,758
have strengthened our relations.

646
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:03,639
There's a plus two because we appreciate the years you have supplied us with resources.

647
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,402
There's a negative one because you declared war on our friend.

648
00:40:08,563 --> 00:40:13,208
So, beyond explaining to the player why the AI feels this way,

649
00:40:13,848 --> 00:40:18,172
it also helps teach the player the importance of their decisions further on in the game.

650
00:40:18,572 --> 00:40:23,315
So farther down the road, they know the effects of declaring war on the friend of someone else,

651
00:40:23,735 --> 00:40:27,818
and that if I declare war now, I will kind of lose that bonus of the fact that we've been

652
00:40:28,538 --> 00:40:31,920
at peace for centuries. You know, it's a very, very important teaching tool.

653
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:37,283
So ultimately, if the mechanics are primary to a game,

654
00:40:37,303 --> 00:40:41,686
you know, then I really want to strengthen that a key factor is transparency.

655
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:44,447
All right, thank you.

656
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:57,522
All right, I think we have some time for questions here.

657
00:40:59,987 --> 00:41:00,568
Thanks, good talk.

658
00:41:01,948 --> 00:41:04,289
Sorin and I have been arguing about this for years.

659
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:08,391
But I was interested in, I tried to find many things to disagree

660
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:11,192
with, but I only found one thing really to disagree with.

661
00:41:11,232 --> 00:41:14,973
So it was when you said that there's

662
00:41:15,313 --> 00:41:17,894
a core part of the game that's, it was basically

663
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:18,735
around the Surlin stuff.

664
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:19,095
Sure.

665
00:41:19,175 --> 00:41:21,956
And it's a core part of the game that basically issues the micro

666
00:41:21,996 --> 00:41:26,218
and it's only the macro to use RTS, or strategy and tactics,

667
00:41:26,258 --> 00:41:26,598
or whatever.

668
00:41:28,198 --> 00:41:33,381
At least my experience in making Spy Party is that the micro in games like that is actually part of the core

669
00:41:33,521 --> 00:41:39,484
and is in kind of an inextricable way, which is one of my criticisms about the idea of taking too much from board games.

670
00:41:39,504 --> 00:41:42,845
So I was wondering if you could talk more about that, because I don't agree with the fundamental concept

671
00:41:42,865 --> 00:41:47,627
that every game has this core thing that is not micro that you can pull out of it.

672
00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:52,658
So you don't believe the spy party has the inner part that could exist without the micro?

673
00:41:52,758 --> 00:41:58,283
I think, for example, the pathing in the micro is part of the game of performing like the spy, for example,

674
00:41:58,463 --> 00:42:01,766
or the aiming aspect deepens the game for the sniper.

675
00:42:02,226 --> 00:42:04,769
And I think that's true in a fighting game and in a whole bunch of other games.

676
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,191
That kind of performance under pressure, there's a whole bunch of things that aren't...

677
00:42:07,811 --> 00:42:11,617
Like a different real time in a strategy game aren't the same and so one of my criticisms about

678
00:42:12,438 --> 00:42:15,281
Taking too much from board games is there's the whole Stalinist like quantity has a quality

679
00:42:15,301 --> 00:42:17,905
That's all its own you know the fact that you're running at 60 Hertz

680
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:22,090
And you're evaluating millions of things a second changes the thing completely well

681
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,193
I think I think the micro can be the game

682
00:42:24,514 --> 00:42:29,659
for sure. And I think those are aspects of Spy Party I've identified that are important. They're

683
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:34,805
not ones that should necessarily be abstracted away. I think the issue for Serlin was that

684
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:39,771
having achieved a level of mastery in fighting games, he became aware

685
00:42:40,231 --> 00:42:43,335
of this whole other pipe of game that most players just never saw.

686
00:42:44,336 --> 00:42:45,797
And he wanted to expose that.

687
00:42:46,218 --> 00:42:50,342
And that doesn't necessarily mean that you wouldn't want to have any type of micro in fighting games.

688
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:53,465
I think perhaps the issue, and I'm probably putting words in his mouth now,

689
00:42:54,186 --> 00:43:00,372
is that the micro parts of fighting games perhaps got fetishized a little bit.

690
00:43:00,392 --> 00:43:01,453
That's where it kept...

691
00:43:03,275 --> 00:43:08,400
the genre kept growing, they kept adding more buttons and more combos and longer combos

692
00:43:08,761 --> 00:43:15,328
as opposed to instead trying to pare that stuff down and trying to bring out this beautiful thing at the heart of the game.

693
00:43:16,389 --> 00:43:22,195
I think Divekick is an example of a game that also is sort of pushing towards that inner core of fighting games.

694
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:27,143
you know, I think there's room for both. I mean, I think that the games that really focus on the

695
00:43:27,183 --> 00:43:33,010
micro fighting, um, you know, I think, I think that's, that's fine too, but like, you know,

696
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:37,415
maybe they should really think through what it means that that is what the game is, that they're

697
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:41,179
really making a fundamentally Twitch based game and perhaps those games should have less

698
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:44,423
mind games. I don't know, that's just, I'm not the fine game expert, but...

699
00:43:46,509 --> 00:43:46,949
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

700
00:43:47,089 --> 00:43:50,570
Yeah, I'd like to get your take on iPad ports of some tabletop

701
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,972
games with respect to information and UX design.

702
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:57,913
I think of games like Stone Age and Puerto Rico, which

703
00:43:57,953 --> 00:44:00,034
I think have been ported really successfully,

704
00:44:00,114 --> 00:44:02,235
and they create a fun experience.

705
00:44:02,275 --> 00:44:04,776
And then I think about a more complex game like Eclipse.

706
00:44:05,256 --> 00:44:08,964
in which, from my perspective, there's just too much going on and it's too hard to actually

707
00:44:09,225 --> 00:44:12,251
play something like that on an iPad. Do you think that there's sort of

708
00:44:12,271 --> 00:44:15,618
a complexity point in terms of board games beyond which it just

709
00:44:15,798 --> 00:44:17,201
doesn't work in a digital format?

710
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:22,003
Yeah, I mean, we're I think in this early stage of the sort of

711
00:44:22,623 --> 00:44:25,866
transition. Like at this point, board games were designed just

712
00:44:25,906 --> 00:44:28,909
to be board games. And then the iPad came along. And now, you

713
00:44:29,389 --> 00:44:31,571
know, I want to play all these games I've never got a chance to

714
00:44:31,611 --> 00:44:34,914
play in real life on my iPad. And sometimes that works out

715
00:44:34,974 --> 00:44:37,957
wonderfully. And sometimes the UI is a bit of a disaster,

716
00:44:38,337 --> 00:44:41,720
either based off of execution or that the game is just simply

717
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,321
too complicated.

718
00:44:42,941 --> 00:44:48,465
I think the next wave is people designing games aware that

719
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,688
perhaps most people are going to be playing this game on an iPad

720
00:44:51,988 --> 00:44:55,291
instead of in person, or that the two need to fit together,

721
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:57,973
or stuff like Battle of the Bulge, where it's made by

722
00:44:58,714 --> 00:45:01,736
Wargame designers, but they're fully committed to the iPad.

723
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:06,280
That game is built to fit exactly within the iPad screen

724
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,721
and just makes a beautiful use of a touch interface.

725
00:45:09,783 --> 00:45:14,510
So I think that's what there is to be excited about in the future for mobile board games.

726
00:45:19,662 --> 00:45:23,785
Hi, I have a question about Fog of War. You know I love your magic slides by the way.

727
00:45:24,545 --> 00:45:31,109
We live in a world of YouTube and like Twitch where maybe it's not too difficult to see how a

728
00:45:31,209 --> 00:45:36,512
good player is beating you given that there's these avenues to see high level play of these

729
00:45:36,572 --> 00:45:42,816
games that do use Fog of War. Does that make it less of a decision to actually use it?

730
00:45:42,836 --> 00:45:46,338
Sorry, I'm going to need you to repeat the question once.

731
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:51,831
using fog of war you said a problem is it hides what your

732
00:45:51,851 --> 00:45:55,393
opponent is doing and possibly how they're beating you. So you

733
00:45:55,413 --> 00:46:00,616
may not learn how to play the game. But because of YouTube and

734
00:46:01,056 --> 00:46:04,417
Twitch, stuff like that, people can see high level gameplay.

735
00:46:04,537 --> 00:46:09,420
And beyond that, StarCraft 2 did a wonderful job of bringing

736
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:13,422
replays into the experience and at the end of the game it will

737
00:46:13,442 --> 00:46:16,963
show you that direct list of all the different actions, they

738
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:17,123
built.

739
00:46:17,664 --> 00:46:24,311
for SEVs and then they built a Vespian, they built on the Vespian gas. You see the exact order

740
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:28,916
that they took. So if you're wondering how you fell behind, you can kind of like look at that

741
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:34,682
build order and kind of imagine it. I mean like, I'd say in a sense they're aware of the problem.

742
00:46:34,722 --> 00:46:36,384
I'm not sure whether consciously or not.

743
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:43,489
but they know that they want to expose what happened in the game as much as possible even with

744
00:46:43,549 --> 00:46:48,892
a fog of war. So I mean, a fog of war is here to stay. It's one of the great things that video

745
00:46:48,912 --> 00:46:56,878
games does and it's not going to go away. But you definitely shouldn't just assume that it should

746
00:46:56,898 --> 00:46:59,640
be there in a strategy game. That's the best way I would put it.

747
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:01,871
All right.

748
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,355
With transparency in mind, how do you

749
00:47:03,415 --> 00:47:05,880
approach games whose core gameplay is founded

750
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,386
on things like an information, or lies, or betrayal,

751
00:47:08,686 --> 00:47:10,230
and things like in identity games and the like?

752
00:47:10,853 --> 00:47:15,236
Yeah, well I'd like to draw a line between sort of rules transparency and hidden information,

753
00:47:16,117 --> 00:47:17,838
which is perhaps something I should have got into.

754
00:47:17,898 --> 00:47:22,582
I mean, there's a lot of great board games where everyone understands the rules,

755
00:47:22,742 --> 00:47:28,226
but of course they don't know what cards someone is holding and, you know,

756
00:47:28,266 --> 00:47:33,069
the sort of classic block war games, you know, the blocks are sort of turned around

757
00:47:33,129 --> 00:47:38,533
and you can't tell if that's a tank or an infantry or an artillery or whatnot.

758
00:47:39,154 --> 00:47:44,963
Um, and so, you know, that's, that's just a great, uh, great tool for game design, uh,

759
00:47:45,023 --> 00:47:49,270
hidden information. Um, there is sort of this, this higher level issue of...

760
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:57,416
some simulations, you know, sort of the paradox games, EU, Crusader Kings, or game, you

761
00:47:57,436 --> 00:48:01,937
know, simulations in general, things like out of the park baseball, you know, these games are

762
00:48:01,977 --> 00:48:06,938
kind of built around this concept, or part of the appeal of these games is you're never quite

763
00:48:07,038 --> 00:48:12,580
sure what's going on under the hood. And there's, there's no game around that that

764
00:48:13,709 --> 00:48:15,191
That is not transparent.

765
00:48:15,211 --> 00:48:17,495
And transparency is not just this goal

766
00:48:17,535 --> 00:48:18,797
you should always aim for.

767
00:48:18,817 --> 00:48:21,321
It's just this important tool if you

768
00:48:21,822 --> 00:48:23,785
want the player to engage with a certain set of rules.

769
00:48:24,806 --> 00:48:28,171
So the point is that if you're making a game like.

770
00:48:29,192 --> 00:48:30,173
like out of the park or whatever,

771
00:48:30,513 --> 00:48:33,194
you should know that you're purposely making

772
00:48:33,214 --> 00:48:34,614
an opaque set of rules.

773
00:48:35,715 --> 00:48:37,635
And you should design that into the system that like,

774
00:48:37,755 --> 00:48:39,956
okay, so they don't know what's gonna determine

775
00:48:39,996 --> 00:48:42,117
what happens in each specific game of baseball,

776
00:48:42,557 --> 00:48:44,438
but we should provide hints,

777
00:48:45,698 --> 00:48:48,659
we should have some scouts that give some bits of text

778
00:48:48,739 --> 00:48:52,301
to explain why players kind of behave certain ways.

779
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:54,582
You just need to be very aware of what you're doing

780
00:48:54,662 --> 00:48:57,683
because you're choosing not to be transparent.

781
00:48:58,543 --> 00:48:58,723
All right.

782
00:48:59,123 --> 00:48:59,263
Cool.

783
00:48:59,283 --> 00:49:00,644
This question is kind of related, I think.

784
00:49:00,844 --> 00:49:02,805
So I love this talk, and I thought it was great.

785
00:49:02,825 --> 00:49:05,127
And it did a great job representing a point of view

786
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:06,308
that I think is completely valid.

787
00:49:06,588 --> 00:49:08,109
But there's this opposite point of view, which

788
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:09,790
questions a lot of the assumptions

789
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:11,451
you're making about whether players are supposed

790
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:14,272
to be comforted and supposed to be satisfied and have clarity

791
00:49:14,312 --> 00:49:15,953
about what they're achieving, right?

792
00:49:15,993 --> 00:49:17,474
And so in games, obviously, the system.

793
00:49:18,275 --> 00:49:22,317
is the message and a game like Sim Earth is actually an amazing game in part because it, you know,

794
00:49:22,357 --> 00:49:28,400
captures that idea so perfectly, you know. And so the idea of a diplomat being represented as

795
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:32,042
almost a robot kind of sends this message that's very different than what it's like to real

796
00:49:32,342 --> 00:49:36,544
diplomacy and real interactions with humans. So I guess the question is have you thought, to

797
00:49:36,564 --> 00:49:39,425
what extent do you think, and you're obviously a super smart person, and you're coming down on

798
00:49:39,505 --> 00:49:43,928
one side of this argument, to what extent have you thought about those dogmas and playing with

799
00:49:43,948 --> 00:49:45,128
the other side of that argument?

800
00:49:45,867 --> 00:49:48,369
Well, I like to think of it as a certain type of game.

801
00:49:48,389 --> 00:49:51,071
Transparency is a certain type of gameplay aesthetic, right?

802
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:53,453
Like, it's a specific way to make a game.

803
00:49:54,114 --> 00:49:57,317
And I think what's important is a lot of people

804
00:49:58,138 --> 00:50:00,440
are making games that should be transparent,

805
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,441
but they're not making the effort to make them transparent.

806
00:50:02,862 --> 00:50:07,885
as opposed to other people who are making games where they're maybe purposely choosing

807
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:09,986
that they want the game to be somewhat opaque,

808
00:50:10,586 --> 00:50:13,388
because they don't want the player to have control over the system.

809
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:18,251
In Civ, we felt, or perhaps we learned over time,

810
00:50:18,331 --> 00:50:23,794
that our player base wants to have sort of full control and full understanding over the game.

811
00:50:23,934 --> 00:50:26,916
Or perhaps even that's just the gameplay aesthetic that we chose.

812
00:50:27,476 --> 00:50:33,923
right? I think there's a very direct contrast between the Civ series and the EU series in how

813
00:50:33,963 --> 00:50:38,267
they approach that. These are almost like if you chose those two different paths, these are the

814
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:44,053
type of games that you would make. And that's fine. It's mostly I'm just trying to highlight

815
00:50:44,114 --> 00:50:48,058
that, like I said, that you are making a choice. And there's many great games I love that are

816
00:50:48,158 --> 00:50:50,160
opaque, for sure. Cool, great answer.

817
00:50:51,872 --> 00:50:54,834
I see you're looking at making complicated systems

818
00:50:54,854 --> 00:50:58,095
transparent to the player, which was really useful in Civ 4.

819
00:50:58,596 --> 00:51:00,236
The one thing you end up with, at least in that game,

820
00:51:00,277 --> 00:51:02,798
is a laundry list of just a whole bunch of individual

821
00:51:02,858 --> 00:51:04,599
points that the player all has to pass.

822
00:51:05,019 --> 00:51:07,220
Have you thought about, and this might be very domain specific

823
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,901
to every game you're working on, how you actually visualize that

824
00:51:10,302 --> 00:51:12,683
and how you maybe take more than one or two systems,

825
00:51:12,883 --> 00:51:14,544
like saying in Civ there's three guys

826
00:51:14,624 --> 00:51:17,245
and how they are related and what their interconnection is.

827
00:51:17,879 --> 00:51:19,819
and how you actually visualize it to the player.

828
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,061
Or at what point does the underlying system

829
00:51:22,101 --> 00:51:24,442
become so complex that you don't want to show it

830
00:51:24,462 --> 00:51:26,583
to the player anymore, but you need to figure out a way

831
00:51:26,603 --> 00:51:27,823
of how you show that.

832
00:51:28,104 --> 00:51:31,565
Yeah, so that's a really tricky issue.

833
00:51:32,026 --> 00:51:33,806
So to be clear, what you're talking about

834
00:51:33,826 --> 00:51:37,508
is that at some point, you write game code,

835
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:41,590
and perhaps that game code can be expressed graphically.

836
00:51:42,131 --> 00:51:43,511
Perhaps it can be expressed in text.

837
00:51:44,332 --> 00:51:46,032
But it needs to be expressed.

838
00:51:46,953 --> 00:51:49,634
in a limited amount of screen space, right?

839
00:51:50,054 --> 00:51:52,375
But perhaps at some point you write code

840
00:51:52,395 --> 00:51:55,396
that stretches beyond that, and there's just no way

841
00:51:55,496 --> 00:51:58,238
to express that concisely.

842
00:51:58,258 --> 00:51:59,718
Is that sort of what you're getting at?

843
00:51:59,998 --> 00:52:01,619
Yeah, and you probably want to make sure

844
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:04,440
that the player at a glance can see the interconnections

845
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,801
instead of having to go through a list of a whole bunch of stuff

846
00:52:06,821 --> 00:52:10,343
that you as the programmer don't mind going through individually.

847
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:10,683
Yeah.

848
00:52:11,988 --> 00:52:17,353
I have a number of different theories about this. For example, if I was to make a baseball

849
00:52:17,373 --> 00:52:24,560
sim, I would probably have it so that you look at a box score, you play out of the park, you

850
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,302
look at a box score, you're not really sure what happened.

851
00:52:26,722 --> 00:52:30,063
you know all the players involved, you know what the ratings are, but you don't know why the

852
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:34,064
game decided that at this moment this guy struck out and why this guy hit a home run or

853
00:52:34,104 --> 00:52:39,426
whatever. What I would probably do is just allow you to essentially click on that app bat and it

854
00:52:39,466 --> 00:52:43,827
jumps to something else that shows you the exact breakdown of like these are the dice that

855
00:52:43,847 --> 00:52:47,528
were rolled and these are the different modifiers and this is why it ended up here. I

856
00:52:47,548 --> 00:52:50,469
wouldn't expect that players would do that all the time.

857
00:52:51,289 --> 00:52:54,432
but it's just sort of comforting to know that that's possible.

858
00:52:55,813 --> 00:52:57,895
And theoretically, most game systems, I think,

859
00:52:57,915 --> 00:53:01,838
could be broken down enough that it's a bit like a fractal.

860
00:53:02,218 --> 00:53:04,601
You can arrange it so you can sort of keep drilling down

861
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:07,243
farther and farther to get at the correct amount

862
00:53:07,263 --> 00:53:07,803
of information.

863
00:53:08,964 --> 00:53:12,527
But I do think that perhaps that might not

864
00:53:12,587 --> 00:53:15,830
work out so well in practice with a really, very

865
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:16,591
complex system.

866
00:53:16,631 --> 00:53:17,892
Like, I'm not sure you could do that.

867
00:53:18,572 --> 00:53:21,174
with a game like European Universe Atlas, just because,

868
00:53:21,194 --> 00:53:23,416
yeah, I think it would just be overwhelming.

869
00:53:23,436 --> 00:53:27,659
I think perhaps a good way to do it is to,

870
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:30,341
I mean, this is another thing that's kind of more

871
00:53:30,381 --> 00:53:32,623
in terms of just theory, is that if you release

872
00:53:32,663 --> 00:53:33,143
the game code,

873
00:53:34,884 --> 00:53:43,808
It kind of allows the community to essentially discover the game and develop their own accurate

874
00:53:43,828 --> 00:53:45,129
understanding of how it works.

875
00:53:46,049 --> 00:53:52,172
Because there's also this open question about when does a player need to know what's going

876
00:53:52,292 --> 00:53:52,332
on.

877
00:53:53,593 --> 00:54:07,925
If you have a pretty complex game, you can perhaps design the game in a way that, so for a new player, you give them enough information that they're able to proceed, but at some point, if they want to keep delving into the game, they're going to want to know what's actually going on.

878
00:54:08,626 --> 00:54:09,947
And that's when you have to worry about that.

879
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:16,293
But, at some level, this is sort of a tension that I think can't quite be resolved.

880
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:22,772
for sure in Civ there were times when we wanted to try a certain

881
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:25,954
type of game mechanic and we realized there's probably really

882
00:54:26,034 --> 00:54:30,057
no way to describe this on the UI. Right? It's going to probably

883
00:54:30,077 --> 00:54:34,841
end up as some sort of black box. And so, you know, 90% of the

884
00:54:34,881 --> 00:54:37,843
game is explainable and comprehensible and then there's

885
00:54:37,883 --> 00:54:41,506
this 10% here that, you know, sorry, it's really complicated.

886
00:54:41,706 --> 00:54:44,669
And I think we made just a high level choice not to do that.

887
00:54:45,404 --> 00:54:53,267
right? We thought that didn't fit with our perception of sieve. But if you really want some of those

888
00:54:53,287 --> 00:54:59,008
mechanics, then yeah, it's a challenge. I'm not sure I have the, there is a total answer for that.

889
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:12,883
So your talk seemed to be about two things. The importance of transparency and rules, making sure the rules are accessible to everybody, but also the grokability and understanding of the math in the game, which can be complicated.

890
00:55:12,983 --> 00:55:19,045
So in board games and magic cards, you rarely see numbers and digits, numbers go into the double digits and further.

891
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:19,486
Right.

892
00:55:20,838 --> 00:55:23,900
let's say Diablo, start off at level one, very understandable,

893
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,481
the numbers are small. But as you advance, they get to these

894
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:30,202
six, seven, eight digit numbers that the human brain can't like

895
00:55:30,262 --> 00:55:34,543
parse or compare easily. I was wondering if you had any tips,

896
00:55:35,004 --> 00:55:37,504
tricks, best practices, anything like that, that when the numbers

897
00:55:37,544 --> 00:55:41,726
and RTS games or anything with sort of stat exponential growth,

898
00:55:42,126 --> 00:55:44,167
you know, bring it back into understanding for players.

899
00:55:44,427 --> 00:55:46,328
That's a good challenge. I mean, those games are always tough

900
00:55:46,348 --> 00:55:49,929
because they're sort of built around inflation. Right. And

901
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:57,700
Yeah, I'm glad I haven't had to design a game like that.

902
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,641
That's a big challenge.

903
00:55:58,721 --> 00:56:02,484
I know in Civ, we always did our best

904
00:56:02,504 --> 00:56:04,666
to start the first units with a strength of one

905
00:56:04,746 --> 00:56:07,648
because we knew that we wouldn't have to go up higher than maybe

906
00:56:07,909 --> 00:56:09,670
25 or 30 by the time we got to the end.

907
00:56:10,791 --> 00:56:13,993
I think that maybe, I mean, it's off the top of my head,

908
00:56:14,033 --> 00:56:15,555
perhaps what I would do is, if you're

909
00:56:15,575 --> 00:56:18,177
talking about damage per second or something like that,

910
00:56:19,078 --> 00:56:19,358
almost.

911
00:56:20,555 --> 00:56:22,877
have two different systems, like one,

912
00:56:25,999 --> 00:56:27,660
like have a color-based system, right?

913
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:30,422
That, this is almost like logarithmic, I guess.

914
00:56:30,482 --> 00:56:31,743
I'm not sure what the right math term would be,

915
00:56:31,803 --> 00:56:35,066
but like, you know, it starts at blue,

916
00:56:35,146 --> 00:56:36,247
and then the next level's green,

917
00:56:36,287 --> 00:56:38,248
the next level is yellow,

918
00:56:38,308 --> 00:56:39,869
and the next level is orange and red.

919
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:42,772
And each of those levels essentially maybe represents

920
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:44,473
a factor of 10, or 100 or something.

921
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:47,295
and then you see a specific number on top of that.

922
00:56:47,835 --> 00:56:51,398
So the player maybe intuitively understands,

923
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,559
okay, I want to go up that color chart

924
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,301
as much as I possibly can,

925
00:56:55,321 --> 00:56:57,342
and then within that color chart,

926
00:56:57,442 --> 00:56:58,863
I can kind of compare between them.

927
00:56:58,943 --> 00:57:00,184
Obviously, I want the higher number.

928
00:57:01,265 --> 00:57:05,331
you know, red is always better than orange or something like that. I mean, I might try

929
00:57:05,351 --> 00:57:10,598
something like that. But yeah, like, I do think that any time a game has, you know, a meaningful

930
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:15,425
value that's higher than a thousand, something's gone wrong, basically. Yeah, I mean, I've seen a

931
00:57:15,445 --> 00:57:17,468
lot of Japanese RPGs where it's like they're losing...

932
00:57:17,989 --> 00:57:20,630
they have like 90,000 hit points and it's just,

933
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:22,130
that's kind of baffling to me.

934
00:57:23,571 --> 00:57:27,293
Oh, all right, go ahead.

935
00:57:27,393 --> 00:57:29,534
Is there a danger or do you see a risk

936
00:57:29,974 --> 00:57:32,615
in like too much transparency in the sense

937
00:57:32,675 --> 00:57:34,636
that once everything's laid out on the table

938
00:57:34,676 --> 00:57:35,916
and once all the knowledge is there,

939
00:57:36,737 --> 00:57:39,978
it's possible for situations and mechanics

940
00:57:40,018 --> 00:57:41,579
and games to become sort of solvable?

941
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:43,960
Or like just turn them into an optimization spreadsheet

942
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,040
which sort of isn't as much fun?

943
00:57:47,429 --> 00:57:50,471
Well, it depends on what your intention is as a designer, certainly.

944
00:57:51,572 --> 00:57:57,678
I mean, there are plenty of games that, you know, it's not solvable in a sense.

945
00:57:57,758 --> 00:58:04,564
Like, you know, Go has very few rules, but clearly it's not solvable, right?

946
00:58:05,084 --> 00:58:06,866
And of course that's because there's another player involved.

947
00:58:07,366 --> 00:58:08,367
But like the...

948
00:58:10,109 --> 00:58:11,029
Oh, what's the right way to put this?

949
00:58:14,567 --> 00:58:22,953
I think that you, you know, Civ has a bunch of rules, they're fairly transparent, you

950
00:58:22,973 --> 00:58:26,916
understand what they are, but ultimately there's too many different factors going on at the

951
00:58:26,956 --> 00:58:32,020
same time for someone to come up with some sort of ideal answer. And that's kind of where

952
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:33,962
you want to be if you're making a single player game.

953
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:36,930
And so I think that for sure that's a big issue

954
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:39,011
if you're especially making a single player game.

955
00:58:39,371 --> 00:58:41,512
So that's what I would be worried about.

956
00:58:41,592 --> 00:58:42,773
If you're making a multiplayer game,

957
00:58:43,193 --> 00:58:45,074
I think that is not necessarily,

958
00:58:45,174 --> 00:58:46,775
you just need to see the feel.

959
00:58:46,855 --> 00:58:48,536
How does the game feel?

960
00:58:48,856 --> 00:58:50,697
There's nothing inferiorly better or worse

961
00:58:50,737 --> 00:58:52,238
about having more or less rules.

962
00:58:52,778 --> 00:58:54,779
Well, actually, generally it's better to have less rules.

963
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:56,840
Okay.

964
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:57,141
Thanks.

965
00:58:57,181 --> 00:58:59,002
All right, I think that's, that should do it.

966
00:58:59,742 --> 00:59:00,102
Thank you.
