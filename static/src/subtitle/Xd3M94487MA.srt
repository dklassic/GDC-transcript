1
00:00:05,073 --> 00:00:06,273
So I'm Tom Bible.

2
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:08,895
I've been in the games industry for about 19 years,

3
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:11,456
six of which I spent at LucasArts,

4
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:14,457
where I was audio lead for Star Wars 1313

5
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:16,258
and the Monkey Island Special Edition series.

6
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:20,420
I now run Submersion Audio with other former LucasArts

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,300
audio team members.

8
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:25,442
And we do everything from mobile to AAA.

9
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:27,723
We're pretty focused on our VR work.

10
00:00:28,243 --> 00:00:31,065
And I've had the chance to work on Dear Angelica, Henry,

11
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:32,345
and Robo Recall.

12
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:36,994
And my name is Jesse Harlan.

13
00:00:38,676 --> 00:00:42,179
I have been in the games industry for 20 years, 10 of which I spent at LucasArts.

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,405
And I have been freelancing for the last six years, working with companies like Sony and

15
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:55,030
EA and Google and ILM, XLab on a bunch of VR stuff.

16
00:00:56,257 --> 00:01:00,602
And with all of our VR experience between Tom and I,

17
00:01:00,642 --> 00:01:02,844
we thought it'd be great to give you guys a talk

18
00:01:03,084 --> 00:01:05,427
on a pinball game on the Switch.

19
00:01:07,449 --> 00:01:09,051
So, who is this talk for?

20
00:01:10,575 --> 00:01:15,538
Well, first off, it's for indie and junior audio professionals,

21
00:01:15,578 --> 00:01:20,401
people for whom AAA experience is either minimal or non-existent

22
00:01:20,942 --> 00:01:27,326
and who are interested in seeing how to apply some AAA audio practices to their indie work.

23
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:31,108
Also, maybe you're in the wrong room,

24
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,410
and maybe you've got an hour to kill before your next talk.

25
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,833
We would welcome you to stay as well, senior audio people.

26
00:01:41,223 --> 00:01:42,484
So what will we be talking about?

27
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:50,186
We will be talking about what it's like to interact with an indie company,

28
00:01:50,906 --> 00:01:52,406
the kinds of things that we look for,

29
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:59,568
and the kinds of things that we do at the outset of a project from a AAA mindset,

30
00:02:00,648 --> 00:02:02,629
what are some of the creative challenges,

31
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:05,549
and what are some of the technical challenges that we faced,

32
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,650
specifically on the game Yoku's Island Express.

33
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:12,032
So, Yoku's Island Express.

34
00:02:13,212 --> 00:02:15,833
Please put your hand up if you've ever played

35
00:02:16,113 --> 00:02:17,153
Yoku's Island Express.

36
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:19,974
Alright, hey, look at that, a few people.

37
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:22,935
Please put your hand up if you've never heard

38
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:24,116
of Yoku's Island Express.

39
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:27,477
About double the people who've played it.

40
00:02:27,577 --> 00:02:28,677
Okay, so, that's okay.

41
00:02:29,838 --> 00:02:33,959
When the developers approached Tom and I,

42
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,260
Villa Gorilla, the company,

43
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:38,566
who made the game. This is how they described the game to us.

44
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:41,747
Yoku's Island Express is an open world

45
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:44,989
two-and-a-half D metroidvania pinball game

46
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:49,831
where you play as the ball set on a tropical island that happens to have a

47
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:50,531
Cthulian

48
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:54,593
Elder God problem. At which point Tom and I were like

49
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:58,534
what? But they showed us the game

50
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:01,756
and it was super adorable and we were like alright

51
00:03:02,276 --> 00:03:04,757
you guys had me at Cthulian Elder God problem.

52
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:13,948
So, it's actually been a bit of a critical darling over the last nine months, making

53
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:19,895
a lot of best of lists at the end of the year, up for a number of awards.

54
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:23,960
Just found out we're up for two BAFTA awards, so that's pretty rad.

55
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:33,027
We had the honor of being the 34th best PS4 game on Metacritic,

56
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:37,470
and the 53rd most discussed Switch game of 2018.

57
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:40,372
Hold for applause.

58
00:03:41,953 --> 00:03:43,474
But not everybody likes your games.

59
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:48,178
A man that I'm sure needs no introduction,

60
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:50,379
Twitter user Marudeus, said,

61
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:52,581
I got it on discount and still regret it.

62
00:03:54,146 --> 00:04:01,128
Which, you know, that's a bummer, but we'll put our faith more in the Bafta people than

63
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:01,968
Maru Deus.

64
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:07,870
So let's take a look at what the game is and get those who don't know anything about it

65
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,111
familiar with Yoku's Island Express.

66
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:38,408
Embark on a new kind of adventure.

67
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:45,013
Meet an unforgettable cast.

68
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,718
Experience amazing abilities.

69
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,942
Help save the island from a terrible fate.

70
00:05:35,507 --> 00:05:37,588
OK, that's Yokuza Live Express.

71
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,351
Tom, if you will.

72
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:42,712
TOM LITTLEWOOD-SMITH Sure.

73
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:44,573
So, interacting with indies.

74
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:47,075
Let's take a look at the map.

75
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,457
So this is where we all were.

76
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:54,200
You had Villa Gorilla, based in Stockholm, in Sweden.

77
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,641
I had myself, based in Oxford in the UK.

78
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:59,984
And Jesse, sort of nine or ten time zones away.

79
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:03,646
Sorry, eight or nine time zones away in the Bay Area,

80
00:06:03,686 --> 00:06:03,986
right here.

81
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:07,524
So how did we get signed up on this project?

82
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:13,036
Well, we met Jens Andersen, co-founder of Villa Gorilla

83
00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:14,700
at LucasArts, where we worked with him.

84
00:06:15,761 --> 00:06:17,764
He's pictured here in the red circle.

85
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:19,325
He's the only person on the screen,

86
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,067
so I'm not really sure why he needs a red circle.

87
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:24,190
But anyway, he got in touch with us over e-mail

88
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,774
and laid things out for us.

89
00:06:28,675 --> 00:06:34,341
And we agreed a flat fee with a sales-related bonus.

90
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:36,624
So if you haven't bought Yoku's Island Express,

91
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:37,304
now's a great time.

92
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:38,997
It's on sale.

93
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:40,298
It's on sale, yeah, exactly.

94
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:47,542
So and he said to us, I know that we

95
00:06:47,602 --> 00:06:49,424
need world class music for this game,

96
00:06:49,464 --> 00:06:51,325
but I don't know if we need world class sound design.

97
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:54,267
So my first job on the game was to persuade them

98
00:06:54,587 --> 00:06:57,549
that they wanted to put as much resources towards the sound

99
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:02,372
design as the music, and also to make a case for Wwise,

100
00:07:02,652 --> 00:07:03,853
which I'll come back to later.

101
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,492
So he laid it out as a one-year project,

102
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:11,635
which sounded great, except that it lasted three years for us.

103
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:16,399
So yeah, that was actually about double the work

104
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:18,441
that I'd signed up for in the original deal,

105
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:20,102
so we kind of had to go backwards and forth

106
00:07:20,703 --> 00:07:22,484
later in the project, but we're good friends,

107
00:07:22,504 --> 00:07:23,465
so it all worked out fine.

108
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:26,608
So here's a couple of principles

109
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:29,190
that I use when I work with indies.

110
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:30,311
So,

111
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:36,846
For me, at least, I think my relationships are way more important than the money.

112
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:39,527
So, the relationships are...

113
00:07:40,328 --> 00:07:43,849
Sorry, the money serves the relationships, the relationships do not serve the money.

114
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:51,503
And what this can mean practically is that I try not to talk about money in the first meeting with an indie.

115
00:07:52,724 --> 00:08:00,107
So often they're coming to me, and they're not audio experts, and they want to get an understanding of what that would mean,

116
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:06,129
and they're kind of looking for a number, and when you give them that number, or when I give them that number, the conversation tends to end.

117
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:11,242
And, you know, because then they're going to need to make their decision about which

118
00:08:11,362 --> 00:08:12,583
person to use for the audio.

119
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:15,627
Now, I'm not saying you should be evasive about talking about money.

120
00:08:16,187 --> 00:08:20,892
I'm just saying that it's great to build an understanding of the client, the project,

121
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:25,898
and their expectations of what they want from the audio before you get into that money conversation.

122
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,857
And I like to approach that by kind of working backwards

123
00:08:29,897 --> 00:08:32,059
from what's their sort of audio budget,

124
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,562
what's the scope of the game, and then coming up

125
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:36,764
with something that's really appropriate for their project,

126
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,526
maybe giving them a few options.

127
00:08:39,106 --> 00:08:42,710
And they come away happy having increased understanding.

128
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,451
You've built up that relationship.

129
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:46,673
So even if it doesn't work out with them,

130
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:48,415
you've built up the relationship.

131
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:49,176
And that's always helpful.

132
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:54,497
And then I recommend get things in writing and use a contract.

133
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:55,517
So we used an email.

134
00:08:56,217 --> 00:08:57,218
I don't recommend doing that.

135
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:01,799
But yeah, I've heard stories, actually, where games got

136
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:05,841
canceled and it caused problems because you had assets

137
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:08,782
and it wasn't clear who owned them, who owned the music.

138
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:10,483
And there were legal wrangles.

139
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,223
But it was fine for us.

140
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:14,464
But don't do what we did.

141
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:21,348
And also, royalties are great, but they don't always work out,

142
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,872
so make sure your cash flow works without the royalties.

143
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:27,097
Again, Yoku's on sale on the Switch right now.

144
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:29,064
Yeah.

145
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,088
And with Indies, don't forget about the marketing materials.

146
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:37,012
So there were a lot of videos that we had to make for,

147
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:39,575
there was about five or six trailers that we put out,

148
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:41,177
and I wanted to make sure that the sound

149
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:43,640
matched the same quality as the game.

150
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,843
So I did all those, and I didn't plan for that.

151
00:09:47,023 --> 00:09:50,768
So make sure you plan for that in your contracts like I didn't.

152
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:55,235
So, pre-production.

153
00:09:56,397 --> 00:10:01,105
So we set up pre-production for every project the same way, whether it's a giant AAA game

154
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:03,028
or a tiny two-man indie game.

155
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:07,113
So these are kind of the concepts and the rules I follow.

156
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:11,617
So firstly, pre-production is the most important phase for audio.

157
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:16,561
It's your chance to build every system, to test and refine every workflow,

158
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:19,723
because once you get into production, you're going to be running through this workflow

159
00:10:19,863 --> 00:10:21,945
over and over hundreds or thousands of times,

160
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:24,947
and any sort of clicks you can get out of that workflow

161
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:30,091
are going to save you loads of production time that you can spend on improving the quality.

162
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:34,988
It's a great time to take all your creative risks and fail while it's cheap.

163
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:38,370
And do all your creative experimentation.

164
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,612
Try things out that may or may not work and set your direction.

165
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:49,556
So this is super key in AAA games and just as important in little tiny indie games.

166
00:10:49,576 --> 00:10:55,720
I'll also say align your audio pre-production with the project pre-production.

167
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,522
Now this tends to happen anyway, but just in case it doesn't,

168
00:10:59,062 --> 00:11:00,023
make sure that your...

169
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:04,465
You're operating holistically in the prototyping phase.

170
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:06,866
So when they're kind of figuring out what the game is,

171
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:08,826
support them with the audio.

172
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:12,368
So they're sort of iterating using all of the disciplines.

173
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:14,508
Communication.

174
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:18,389
Communication is key, absolutely key,

175
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:21,290
especially when you have an indie team

176
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:23,931
and you're scattered across the globe.

177
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:27,252
For example, with.

178
00:11:28,325 --> 00:11:30,945
Yoku's Island Express, we had weekly Skype calls.

179
00:11:32,986 --> 00:11:38,187
That seemed very doable when the game was supposed to be one year long.

180
00:11:39,228 --> 00:11:43,269
The game went on for three years, though, which meant that every single week for three

181
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:49,191
years I had to stay up until midnight, the stroke of Thursday, and call Sweden.

182
00:11:50,471 --> 00:11:55,152
Had something like 150 midnight phone calls with Sweden and England in order to figure

183
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:57,173
out what was going on with the game.

184
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:03,203
We made sure that we used a Google tracking sheet for things.

185
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:11,606
I recommend you use something like Google because emailing Excel documents back and

186
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:14,707
forth or putting an Excel doc on something like Dropbox,

187
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:17,108
they get out of sync very easily even.

188
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:22,489
Even using something like Perforce or any source control software,

189
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:24,870
it is possible for your documents to get out of sync.

190
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:30,231
And then somebody makes change and now you've got two versions of something floating around.

191
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:36,992
And with documentation and communication, two versions of something can be really detrimental.

192
00:12:37,112 --> 00:12:41,653
So we made sure we had this document that tracked all of our goals, obstacles, and progress.

193
00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:46,073
And that way everybody knew what everybody else was working on, who was blocked by what.

194
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,772
And it made things go a lot smoother.

195
00:12:52,576 --> 00:12:54,718
So some creative considerations.

196
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,243
On the creative side, let's start by looking at what I

197
00:12:58,303 --> 00:13:00,806
think is the most exciting element, documentation.

198
00:13:02,355 --> 00:13:07,919
So, I find it helpful to start most projects with a short document I call a creative audio

199
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:11,561
vision, which kind of sounds like a contradiction in terms, but it is really useful.

200
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:16,264
I start with a short summary, like what I call the audio pillars.

201
00:13:16,324 --> 00:13:21,628
So for Yoku's Island Express, this was a world full of character and charm, a responsive

202
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:25,710
pinball feel, and organic, relaxing, exotic exploration.

203
00:13:26,871 --> 00:13:32,515
which is a really quick and cheap way to get alignment with the team over what you think the audio should be about.

204
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:37,719
Then, it's obviously pretty useful to gather a few YouTube videos.

205
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,221
You know, you're not working with audio professionals,

206
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:48,187
so establishing a common sound design language by just some reference videos is a great way to get started and get aligned.

207
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:53,549
What I often do, especially on larger projects, is a prototype video.

208
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:59,376
So I'll take one to two minutes of a gameplay video of wherever the gameplay is at and score

209
00:13:59,396 --> 00:14:00,197
it in my DAW.

210
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:04,962
And you can go back and forth with the creative director of the project to kind of come up

211
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:09,547
with what the sound of your game actually is like in practice without having to rely

212
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:11,309
on setting up systems and all things like that.

213
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:15,807
And then this document's a great place to put all your

214
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,508
technical features that you're going to need.

215
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:22,131
So we knew that we were doing 2D open world audio, which

216
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:24,213
sounds straightforward, but really wasn't.

217
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:27,915
A bunch of physics audio, which could be a bit more

218
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:29,516
straightforward, but wasn't.

219
00:14:29,796 --> 00:14:32,739
And then a load of tools, which weren't

220
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:33,359
straightforward either.

221
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,322
When it comes to music, I, like Tom, also

222
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:40,144
begin with a document.

223
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:47,298
I call this document a music map, and the map is not a map in a traditional sense as

224
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:51,282
in a map that leads you through locations.

225
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:56,386
A music map to me is instead an emotional road map of the game.

226
00:14:57,703 --> 00:15:02,987
It is a document that spells out from moment to moment what the dev wants you to feel,

227
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:06,770
or not you, wants the player to feel.

228
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:09,953
Where does the music need to change?

229
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:16,519
That might be location to location, but it also might be reliant upon puzzle completion,

230
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:22,023
or it might be tied to the middle of some sort of cut scene.

231
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:31,125
a detailed list of where queues change and what they change to,

232
00:15:31,526 --> 00:15:35,710
then becomes my detailed blueprint for what I'm going to be writing

233
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,632
throughout the entire development of the game.

234
00:15:39,013 --> 00:15:43,418
It has everything listed out, and because I have created this side-by-side

235
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,141
with the developer, they have sign-off already on everything,

236
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:48,343
and there's no surprises as to what I'm going to be writing.

237
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:55,185
There's an additional added bonus to creating this document in that if you have everything

238
00:15:55,265 --> 00:15:59,266
listed in there, now your brain is down in a document.

239
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:08,109
And I can hand this document to a technical sound designer or a level designer, and they

240
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:12,530
can handle implementation if need be, if for some reason I'm not the one that's going to

241
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:12,991
be doing it.

242
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:24,742
And it means that when the time comes that everything is implemented, the same document that has now been making its way through the entire project can be handed to QA.

243
00:16:25,423 --> 00:16:30,186
And I don't have to be the only person who knows how music is supposed to function throughout the game.

244
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:37,531
It's all detailed there and QA can go through and see what's not working as designed and what is working correctly.

245
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:43,697
So let's take a step back for a second and think about

246
00:16:43,757 --> 00:16:44,617
classic pinball.

247
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:48,658
So classic pinball has two main acoustic elements.

248
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:51,719
You've got the mechanical and physical sounds of the actual

249
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:55,020
table, and you've got the additional sound effects and

250
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,560
music layers to add excitement and reward to that.

251
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,741
So if you think about it from a UX point of view, for the UX

252
00:17:02,602 --> 00:17:05,022
of pinball audio, the goals are kind of like this.

253
00:17:05,702 --> 00:17:09,103
To make short play time really exciting, to give you

254
00:17:09,203 --> 00:17:10,823
immediate visceral feedback.

255
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:15,526
to be really rewarding, and lastly to help the player know what to do.

256
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:22,930
So for Yoku's Island Express, which is, it was inherently organic with a lot of soft surfaces,

257
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,452
so it made some of the immediate physical feedback a little bit harder.

258
00:17:27,072 --> 00:17:33,095
You know, the surfaces are dirt, grass, snow, and with Yoku being a dung beetle,

259
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,636
the ball is made of, well...

260
00:17:37,897 --> 00:17:51,984
So, anyway, the reward sounds needed to be a lot gentler, because the longer playtime

261
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:57,887
and the creative style of the world, so we were trying to give a calmer overall feel,

262
00:17:58,367 --> 00:17:59,668
which meant less intense sounds.

263
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:03,352
And a lot of the reward sounds only use C and G,

264
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:06,633
because I was trying to avoid dissonance with the music.

265
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:09,134
And I actually asked Jesse to write all the music

266
00:18:09,174 --> 00:18:12,114
in the same key to make sure that there was no dissonance,

267
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:14,735
which worked great for the first year or so

268
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:16,616
until Jesse forgot that we were doing that.

269
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:16,836
Right.

270
00:18:16,856 --> 00:18:17,056
Yeah.

271
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,601
It's a problem when the game goes on for three years.

272
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:22,981
Yeah.

273
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:27,843
So we actually got away with it in the end, but hey, whatever.

274
00:18:29,563 --> 00:18:33,364
So the character voices were one of the biggest sound design challenges for the project.

275
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:38,665
We had no budget for VO or localization, so we had to take a lot more creative approach.

276
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:43,847
Now I spent a lot of years at LucasArts studying Ben Burtt's sound design, which has a very

277
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:45,147
vocal quality to it.

278
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:52,413
A lot of the sounds used human vocal articulation, like the alien and the robot voices.

279
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:55,498
They followed the human speech pitch patterns.

280
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,926
And they were constructed using heavy editing of great source rather than heavy processing.

281
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:04,009
So for the characters of Mokumana Island,

282
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:08,974
I looked for animal sounds that had those same sort of human speech pitch elements

283
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:14,639
and edited those together, and I did impressions of those sounds and mixed them together.

284
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,421
So you got some animals that were a mixture,

285
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:22,405
some that were all animals, and some were just all my voice.

286
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:24,767
So, you know, here are some of the characters.

287
00:19:24,787 --> 00:19:26,647
You had, like, the parrot.

288
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:27,648
That was pretty straightforward.

289
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:31,109
I could imagine how to edit parrot sounds into that.

290
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:32,970
You had more complicated ones,

291
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,551
like a giant eel and a pterodactyl.

292
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:38,652
That was a little more work creatively.

293
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:40,593
And then I wasn't exactly sure what to do

294
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:42,294
with a giant talking mushroom

295
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:43,494
and a yellow blob with a hat.

296
00:19:44,075 --> 00:19:45,855
But, anyway, all in all,

297
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:47,856
I was just trying to make the developers laugh.

298
00:19:47,956 --> 00:19:49,417
So here's a quick video,

299
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:51,498
and you can decide whether I was successful.

Thank you.

303
00:20:44,254 --> 00:20:46,196
So, about some of the other sounds.

304
00:20:46,356 --> 00:20:47,797
So the physics sounds were...

305
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:53,293
Pretty challenging as I was saying the creative director and who's called Matthias and I and

306
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:55,834
realized that we had to take a much more organic approach.

307
00:20:56,494 --> 00:21:01,496
So in order to match the world I went out and I bought a cricket ball and a giant marble

308
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:06,478
and I went out to the local nature reserve and chucked it at stuff and got weird looks

309
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:07,178
from passersby.

310
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:14,803
And I also bought a load of children's toys and cut them apart and, you know, made weird

311
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:18,145
sounds with them, much to the dismay of my son, who was three at the time.

312
00:21:20,127 --> 00:21:21,267
And oops.

313
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:21,628
Yes.

314
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:23,589
And we had...

315
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:28,430
some metal rails which I grabbed the rack out of my oven and rolled the marble along it and

316
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,571
also did a bunch of synth programming which I wasn't expecting to do.

317
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:38,693
Some of the voices were actually came out of synths, partly for saving time and partly just

318
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:43,294
because creatively I just wanted to come out with something totally different.

319
00:21:44,294 --> 00:21:46,535
So, musical motivation.

320
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:51,216
When I got on the project Villa Gorilla said to me,

321
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,097
just do whatever you want.

322
00:21:54,465 --> 00:21:58,874
And that's the first time in 20 years that anyone has said that to me in game development.

323
00:21:59,215 --> 00:22:03,383
And I was like, oh my god, that's amazing, the shackles are off, what am I going to do?

324
00:22:05,744 --> 00:22:06,985
And I had no idea.

325
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,408
Totally awful experience.

326
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:13,231
That's not how AAA works.

327
00:22:13,472 --> 00:22:16,555
I've had 20 years of having walked into meetings and

328
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:18,797
people say, this is what we want it to sound like, and

329
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:20,959
here's some YouTube videos, and here's somebody else's

330
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:24,923
soundtrack, and please go ahead and give us what sort

331
00:22:24,963 --> 00:22:25,764
of exists already.

332
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,419
So I had no idea where to even begin.

333
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:33,242
This was one of the biggest creative challenges I faced on the entire score.

334
00:22:33,862 --> 00:22:41,826
So I decided to kind of almost zen-like go back to square one, see what was it that made

335
00:22:41,886 --> 00:22:43,908
me want to be a composer in the first place.

336
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:49,091
I took a look at all these different scores and all these different albums and all these

337
00:22:49,131 --> 00:22:50,972
different, like, NES games.

338
00:22:52,212 --> 00:22:59,514
Everything, the melody writing of the Beatles, the production work of Mass Effect, Massive

339
00:22:59,554 --> 00:23:08,457
Attack, the current production techniques of remix artists like Pogo, all of these things

340
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:13,018
influenced me and ended up one way or another in the game's score.

341
00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:17,527
I had a number of goals that I set for myself

342
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:19,568
with the music score for Yoku.

343
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:23,110
The first one was that it needed to service the game.

344
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:28,413
As with a AAA project, I knew the music needed to,

345
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:31,135
first and foremost, serve the needs of the game.

346
00:23:31,635 --> 00:23:34,657
So, do whatever you want isn't quite as self-indulgent as it sounds.

347
00:23:35,817 --> 00:23:36,718
It had to...

348
00:23:37,638 --> 00:23:40,440
It had a function, and that function was to support the game.

349
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:45,505
If I make a score that supports the game, I make the developer happy.

350
00:23:46,005 --> 00:23:50,169
If I create something that gets called out in reviews, I make the developer happy.

351
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:57,056
If I create a soundtrack that people want to listen to on Spotify and buy, I make the developer happy.

352
00:23:57,096 --> 00:23:57,937
So that was another goal.

353
00:23:59,923 --> 00:24:06,205
The harder goals for this project, one of them is something I'm calling the dichotomy

354
00:24:06,225 --> 00:24:06,925
of opposites.

355
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:13,186
Yokozayn Express by its design is a Metroidvania mixed with a pinball game.

356
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:18,387
And it's like chocolate and pepperoni, but somehow it works.

357
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,487
And it works really beautifully.

358
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:25,908
So I knew I wanted to reflect that musically throughout the game's entire score.

359
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:28,428
And I'll get to that in a moment.

360
00:24:30,824 --> 00:24:34,186
And I also wanted to find, much like Tom wanted to,

361
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:36,847
one of his goals was just to make the developers laugh,

362
00:24:37,047 --> 00:24:39,709
I also wanted to just have fun with this score,

363
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:41,710
because there was so much creativity already.

364
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,472
I wanted to see, how crazy can I take it?

365
00:24:44,512 --> 00:24:47,714
Where's the boundary where I've gone off the deep end,

366
00:24:47,974 --> 00:24:51,116
and the developers are like, that's, okay,

367
00:24:51,376 --> 00:24:53,157
like all the other stuff was fine,

368
00:24:53,197 --> 00:24:54,318
but now you've gone too far,

369
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:56,879
and that's just nuts and doesn't fit in our game.

370
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:59,881
And then I could walk it back and know where the boundary is.

371
00:25:01,816 --> 00:25:03,757
So let's talk about the dichotomy of opposites.

372
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:10,059
Take for instance the opening area of the game.

373
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:12,320
It's a nice, sweet, tropical beach.

374
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,842
I knew I wanted to start with some ukulele, but because I wanted to have the opposite

375
00:25:17,922 --> 00:25:23,764
of ukulele, I also thought, why not mix that with turntableism and beatboxing?

376
00:25:25,044 --> 00:25:25,784
And that led to this.

377
00:25:46,662 --> 00:25:48,444
I was thrilled with that.

378
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:48,905
Thanks.

379
00:25:49,225 --> 00:25:49,585
Thanks.

380
00:25:49,605 --> 00:25:49,765
Thanks.

381
00:25:49,785 --> 00:25:50,286
Thanks.

382
00:25:50,306 --> 00:25:50,506
Thanks.

383
00:25:50,606 --> 00:25:50,967
Thanks.

384
00:25:50,987 --> 00:25:51,127
Thanks.

385
00:26:11,025 --> 00:26:13,026
It hit everything I wanted it to hit.

386
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:17,408
It was two things that really don't go together usually,

387
00:26:17,568 --> 00:26:20,889
but they seemed like they'd just kind of always been waiting

388
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:22,209
to be put together like that.

389
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,970
And it was happy, and it was bright,

390
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,112
and it was a great introductory way to get into the game.

391
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:36,081
And another part in the game, there are these frogs who are monks, and they're building

392
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:40,423
a spaceship out of wood in order to leave the planet.

393
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:44,125
So there's this, again, this dichotomy.

394
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:47,066
There's the science element, there's this very organic element.

395
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:51,588
And I knew that I wanted to reflect that in the music, so I thought, well, what if I take

396
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:52,028
the...

397
00:26:53,349 --> 00:27:01,091
The early 80s synth sounds that you'd get on like a elementary school science film strip.

398
00:27:01,571 --> 00:27:04,492
And why don't I mix that with Tuvan throat singing?

399
00:27:05,732 --> 00:27:07,773
And I did, and it sounds like this.

400
00:27:48,831 --> 00:27:50,732
So again, I was really happy with how that turned out.

401
00:27:51,953 --> 00:27:52,233
Thanks.

402
00:27:53,854 --> 00:27:56,216
And you might have heard in the background, there's a

403
00:27:56,316 --> 00:27:59,818
vocal track going C-A-T-C-C-A-T-G.

404
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:04,521
Well, when I started the track, one of my ideas was to

405
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:08,124
have a Gregorian chant in the track.

406
00:28:08,664 --> 00:28:12,426
But instead of having them singing liturgical text, I

407
00:28:12,446 --> 00:28:14,428
wanted them to be singing chemical formula.

408
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,787
Deoxyribonucleic acid.

409
00:28:19,267 --> 00:28:19,747
That kind of thing.

410
00:28:21,629 --> 00:28:23,711
And I recorded it, and I put it in the track,

411
00:28:23,972 --> 00:28:25,073
and it sounded terrible.

412
00:28:25,313 --> 00:28:26,554
Just totally didn't work.

413
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:28,777
Maybe that was me.

414
00:28:29,097 --> 00:28:31,499
Maybe one of you could be successful with that idea.

415
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,541
Feel free to run with it.

416
00:28:35,312 --> 00:28:38,035
But I knew I still wanted something to represent that.

417
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:40,597
So I decided, oh, well, what if I

418
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,940
were to take the DNA sequence of something

419
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,063
and speak it through a vocoder and just run

420
00:28:46,103 --> 00:28:47,825
that in the background of the whole track

421
00:28:48,525 --> 00:28:49,546
as almost a vocal.

422
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:55,831
So, I did a quick Google search and the first thing I looked for was frogs, because of the

423
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:58,053
frog monks, but I couldn't find frogs.

424
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:00,795
But the first thing I did find was the DNA sequence of yeast.

425
00:29:01,295 --> 00:29:03,177
So thank you Google.

426
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:07,600
I put the DNA sequence of yeast throughout the entirety of that track, just spoken in

427
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,941
the background through vocoder.

428
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:09,982
And it works.

429
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,301
So how did I do with my musical goals for the score?

430
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:16,642
Well, I serviced the game.

431
00:29:17,082 --> 00:29:19,983
The reviews frequently call out the soundtrack

432
00:29:20,183 --> 00:29:23,004
as helping with the atmosphere of the game.

433
00:29:23,824 --> 00:29:28,386
It made a number of best of lists.

434
00:29:28,406 --> 00:29:29,887
It got called out a bunch on Twitter.

435
00:29:29,987 --> 00:29:30,767
So that was great.

436
00:29:31,507 --> 00:29:32,988
Villa Gorilla was very happy with it.

437
00:29:33,028 --> 00:29:34,908
They loved using it all over their marketing stuff.

438
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:40,407
The harder stuff, did I do this dichotomy of opposites thing?

439
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:40,728
Yes.

440
00:29:41,128 --> 00:29:41,828
I figured that out.

441
00:29:41,888 --> 00:29:43,009
I was very happy with it.

442
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:49,751
Now I got to a point where I thought, all right, this track is the one they're going

443
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:50,332
to shoot down.

444
00:29:51,952 --> 00:30:00,896
I had written a track that was a medieval fugue for sham and crumhorn and bebop saxophone,

445
00:30:01,536 --> 00:30:04,418
and after about 30 seconds of that, it became a reggae track.

446
00:30:06,411 --> 00:30:08,112
And I said, here?

447
00:30:08,132 --> 00:30:11,074
And gave it to the devs and they were like, yeah, cool, great, this sounds good.

448
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:17,199
So I never found a place where I managed to go too far.

449
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:20,822
I never found where they were like, no, that's too nuts.

450
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:29,209
So I think trying to push myself to find that, I don't think I normally would have gone for

451
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,191
medieval reggae bebop.

452
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,433
But I got there.

453
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:36,746
Okay, so technical challenges.

454
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:38,312
All right.

455
00:30:39,683 --> 00:30:41,024
So technical tribulations.

456
00:30:41,064 --> 00:30:43,425
Let's start with middleware.

457
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:45,426
So I mentioned at the start of the talk

458
00:30:45,486 --> 00:30:49,989
that the team was a bit skeptical about getting Wwise

459
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:52,510
into the workflow because it was expensive

460
00:30:53,071 --> 00:30:57,133
and it gave them not very much control over the audio code.

461
00:30:57,693 --> 00:30:58,914
So I had to make a case for it.

462
00:30:59,714 --> 00:31:01,355
And making a case for middleware is

463
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,997
something I've done a number of times over a number of games

464
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:04,937
with some success.

465
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:07,159
So here's how I approach it.

466
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:14,142
So firstly, when I make my case, I come up with a feature list of all the things we'll need from the middleware for the game,

467
00:31:14,902 --> 00:31:18,424
and then work out the cost of making that themselves, or ourselves.

468
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,925
And usually it kind of works out like this.

469
00:31:21,726 --> 00:31:29,009
It's cheaper to do it ourselves, which doesn't seem that obvious, and then the team says, well, why do it?

470
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:30,930
Well, there are other elements too.

471
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,371
So debugging.

472
00:31:33,051 --> 00:31:46,682
Yes, you can make it yourself, but when you add the time you're going to spend debugging, it gets more expensive, and to get it to the same level of quality and reliability as middleware, it sort of works out about even, but it doesn't end there.

473
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:51,529
You've got iteration time to worry about, like how quick is it to get your assets in

474
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:57,212
there and then iterate on it and get it to the level of quality that you want, and that

475
00:31:57,353 --> 00:31:59,254
increases the cost as well.

476
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:03,837
And then if you want to make it scale, so it's all very well making it work for just

477
00:32:03,897 --> 00:32:08,080
a few assets, but then what if you're dealing with thousands of assets or tens of thousands

478
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,600
of assets?

479
00:32:09,141 --> 00:32:12,523
If your system's going to need more work to make it scale, it sort of ends up here, and

480
00:32:12,543 --> 00:32:12,683
then...

481
00:32:13,443 --> 00:32:15,544
You know, the independence of the audio workflow.

482
00:32:15,844 --> 00:32:18,345
Are you going to be sharing the same files when you're working?

483
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:21,586
Working with Wwise means I don't need to have those files checked out.

484
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:26,067
And it, you know, ended up kind of off the charts and the team were like,

485
00:32:26,147 --> 00:32:28,008
OK, fine, we'll just use Wwise.

486
00:32:28,668 --> 00:32:31,448
So, music tech.

487
00:32:31,588 --> 00:32:31,769
Yes.

488
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:40,291
I had the task of figuring out what is the interactive music functionality of the game going to be.

489
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:43,548
How granular did I want it to be?

490
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:46,309
And I had some really high concept ideas I wanted to try.

491
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:49,690
I wanted music that adapted as you solved puzzles.

492
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:54,771
Maybe the instrumentation changed as you completed a puzzle.

493
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:59,672
The team asked me, they said there's a central hub village in the game.

494
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:03,173
And they said that as you complete parts of the game, maybe as you come back

495
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:06,034
to the hub, there's new layers of music.

496
00:33:06,994 --> 00:33:10,275
And the track builds up the more you complete of the game.

497
00:33:11,595 --> 00:33:17,599
And one of the things I really wanted to try was boss music that changed tonality when you scored a hit on the boss.

498
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:28,425
So, hit the boss, all of a sudden this minor key track switches to major for a few bars and then seamlessly switches back into minor.

499
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:32,048
And I had some prototypes that I made and it was working really beautifully.

500
00:33:32,788 --> 00:33:34,229
Unfortunately, I had low time.

501
00:33:36,935 --> 00:33:38,996
Because the game was only supposed to take one year,

502
00:33:39,596 --> 00:33:43,338
and because I'm freelancing, I have to go out and find jobs.

503
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:46,380
And as is so frequently the case with freelancing,

504
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,101
everything hit at once.

505
00:33:48,581 --> 00:33:51,963
And by the time it was deep in the heart of production

506
00:33:52,003 --> 00:33:53,244
on this game, I was actually working

507
00:33:53,284 --> 00:33:54,845
on five different projects at a time.

508
00:33:55,485 --> 00:33:58,307
I worked too hard, and I ended up in the hospital

509
00:33:58,367 --> 00:33:59,367
because I worked too hard.

510
00:34:00,628 --> 00:34:05,371
And I had to hire help, which I'll get to in just a moment.

511
00:34:07,018 --> 00:34:12,164
Some of my other challenges is that being an indie game,

512
00:34:12,585 --> 00:34:16,390
there's not a very large budget for the music.

513
00:34:17,144 --> 00:34:18,645
Let alone for live players.

514
00:34:19,106 --> 00:34:24,130
And I knew that there was going to be mostly samples in the score, but I also knew that

515
00:34:24,451 --> 00:34:29,656
just recording a few live instruments completely brings tracks to life.

516
00:34:30,156 --> 00:34:31,938
So I can't recommend it enough.

517
00:34:31,998 --> 00:34:37,744
If you've got a track that is almost all samples, just find one instrument that you can record

518
00:34:37,804 --> 00:34:40,587
live and it just brings so much life to the track.

519
00:34:41,207 --> 00:34:44,029
So I knew I wanted banjo and fretless bass,

520
00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:45,649
which I'd never heard in a game score,

521
00:34:45,769 --> 00:34:47,030
and a couple other things.

522
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,191
I knew I had male and female vocalists

523
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:53,813
for the front main title screen and a brass section.

524
00:34:55,074 --> 00:34:57,035
Where was I going to find players to do this?

525
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:00,436
Is everybody familiar with the Materia Collective?

526
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:01,577
No?

527
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:01,997
Great.

528
00:35:02,337 --> 00:35:03,638
So let me introduce you to them.

529
00:35:04,718 --> 00:35:09,841
The Materia Collective is a video game music fan community.

530
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:17,491
They are a group of musicians, not unlike the Overclock Remix community, who do cover

531
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:22,835
versions of music, but they are also a record label.

532
00:35:24,397 --> 00:35:26,378
And they put out their own albums.

533
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:34,325
And because of this, they are getting used to the idea of producing top-notch, high-quality

534
00:35:34,385 --> 00:35:34,705
music.

535
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,831
But they are still a fan community.

536
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:41,732
So I knew that these were going to be young players who

537
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,994
were really good, liked game music, were familiar with it,

538
00:35:45,054 --> 00:35:47,514
would jump at the chance to work on an actual game.

539
00:35:48,895 --> 00:35:50,576
But their experience level was going

540
00:35:50,596 --> 00:35:51,716
to fit the budget that I had.

541
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,878
So the first bit of help I hired.

542
00:35:57,433 --> 00:35:59,155
was Francesco Del Pia.

543
00:35:59,836 --> 00:36:03,400
He was what I'm going to call a technical music

544
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,124
designer in Vancouver, which was great,

545
00:36:07,224 --> 00:36:09,166
because now he was in the same time zone as me.

546
00:36:09,227 --> 00:36:10,608
So we could just chat throughout the day.

547
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:12,650
And I didn't have to wait up until like 3 in the morning

548
00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:14,653
to talk to him about iteration.

549
00:36:16,764 --> 00:36:20,426
And he helped me out designing all the interactive music

550
00:36:20,486 --> 00:36:22,628
and trying to stitch together pieces on the fly

551
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:25,590
and figuring out whether layers would work better

552
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,971
or chunks stitched together.

553
00:36:27,831 --> 00:36:28,632
He was great at that.

554
00:36:28,832 --> 00:36:30,954
Then, after I hired Francesco,

555
00:36:31,554 --> 00:36:34,176
I seemingly hired every musician in North America

556
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:40,080
to sing on the track or to play banjo for me

557
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,861
or ocarina or harmonica

558
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,323
and a vocalist down in Chile.

559
00:36:45,924 --> 00:36:51,847
Now, the big challenge with this is that I needed to make it sound like everybody was

560
00:36:51,887 --> 00:36:53,488
recorded in the same studio.

561
00:36:53,508 --> 00:36:59,252
I needed to make sure that everything was homogenous when in reality I'm getting who

562
00:36:59,312 --> 00:37:02,093
knows what from people across the globe.

563
00:37:02,814 --> 00:37:06,076
And I needed to make sure they had the right delivery specs

564
00:37:06,096 --> 00:37:06,596
for everything.

565
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:09,298
Everything needed to be up to the quality level, that when I

566
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:11,660
put everything together, it took some shaping, and it took

567
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,002
some mixing and some tweaking.

568
00:37:14,522 --> 00:37:17,124
But I managed to make it all sound very homogenous.

569
00:37:19,746 --> 00:37:19,946
Tom.

570
00:37:20,787 --> 00:37:22,108
So, underwear.

571
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:24,850
Yeah.

572
00:37:25,712 --> 00:37:29,712
In the age of Unity and Unreal, it would be crazy to build your own engine from scratch,

573
00:37:29,972 --> 00:37:31,733
and that's exactly what the team did.

574
00:37:32,193 --> 00:37:36,874
So Underwear is the name of the purpose-built engine that powers Yoku's Island Express.

575
00:37:37,614 --> 00:37:41,795
So it's got a live editor mode, so you can switch backwards and forwards between the

576
00:37:41,835 --> 00:37:44,875
game and the editor and set up the audio really easily.

577
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:48,816
It meant a really fast iteration loop, which was awesome.

578
00:37:49,256 --> 00:37:51,016
And in my experience, fast iteration

579
00:37:51,777 --> 00:37:56,640
is the same as greater quality, because you're spending more time on getting those assets

580
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,881
sounding great in context.

581
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:02,344
And it had the visual editor that looked a lot like this, so I could easily see where

582
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,286
I needed to hook the sounds into.

583
00:38:04,946 --> 00:38:06,027
Made it very straightforward.

584
00:38:06,527 --> 00:38:10,450
Although you did have some situations that looked more like this.

585
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,472
I don't really know what's going on there, but the sound works.

586
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:16,234
So there you go.

587
00:38:16,455 --> 00:38:20,858
And we had a few key technical issues on the project, as it's a physics-based game.

588
00:38:21,737 --> 00:38:23,897
Primarily, especially when you had multiple,

589
00:38:24,357 --> 00:38:25,618
is that there were too many loops.

590
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:29,578
In fact, we had so many loops that all the sound cut out

591
00:38:29,618 --> 00:38:31,159
from the game at times.

592
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:36,380
So we came up with a solution using the wise feature

593
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,781
of multi-sounds, where you have a single sound that's

594
00:38:40,021 --> 00:38:42,701
sort of spread over multiple locations,

595
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:44,162
and it takes the average pan.

596
00:38:44,362 --> 00:38:47,062
And well, actually, that created some other problems.

597
00:38:47,142 --> 00:38:49,923
But I'll take those problems over all the sound cutting out.

598
00:38:49,983 --> 00:38:51,063
So, you know.

599
00:38:52,476 --> 00:38:59,422
We also had an open world zoomable map, which was pretty interesting because a lot of the

600
00:38:59,482 --> 00:39:04,507
way that the sound is designed to work in Wwise is based on a 3D principle.

601
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:09,832
So when you can be sort of zoomed in on one game area or zoomed out looking at the whole

602
00:39:09,872 --> 00:39:10,252
thing or...

603
00:39:10,692 --> 00:39:18,259
Part way in between, it made it a bit challenging to set up the attenuations in a sensible way and figure out what sounds actually needed to be playing.

604
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,463
So the way we figured that out was something we called the listener rectangle.

605
00:39:22,823 --> 00:39:23,504
And here's a picture.

606
00:39:24,444 --> 00:39:27,767
So this is in editor mode. We can see the listener rectangle.

607
00:39:27,787 --> 00:39:30,410
You've got an inner and an outer rectangle.

608
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:36,115
And in between the inner and the outer is a range of 0 to 1000.

609
00:39:38,016 --> 00:39:40,818
And that defined the volume and the pan.

610
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:44,201
And inside the rectangle, it was maximum volume and center pan,

611
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:47,083
which was great because it was on screen space.

612
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:49,045
So however zoomed out or zoomed in you were,

613
00:39:49,385 --> 00:39:51,307
it would choose the appropriate sounds to be playing

614
00:39:51,387 --> 00:39:52,968
and set the volumes appropriately.

615
00:39:53,889 --> 00:39:57,351
And this view gave us a view of all the RTPCs

616
00:39:57,391 --> 00:39:58,312
and the sounds playing.

617
00:39:58,412 --> 00:40:00,874
So this is a really helpful debug view.

618
00:40:02,996 --> 00:40:07,739
And I thought I'd give you a few key technical questions that I asked myself.

619
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:13,804
So when you're planning your 2D open world Metroidvania pinball game with a Cthulian Elder God problem,

620
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,185
you can ask yourself these questions.

621
00:40:16,845 --> 00:40:18,926
How fast is the iteration speed?

622
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,787
Like I said, iteration speed directly correlates

623
00:40:22,007 --> 00:40:25,249
with the quality, so that's important.

624
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:28,670
How is your tech gonna work with thousands of assets?

625
00:40:28,711 --> 00:40:30,351
It's all very well if it works with one or two

626
00:40:30,391 --> 00:40:32,212
for your test cases, but when you scale up,

627
00:40:32,732 --> 00:40:34,473
what kind of problems are you gonna see?

628
00:40:36,049 --> 00:40:38,191
How is your tech going to affect asset creation?

629
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:40,133
So you might come up with a new way of doing things,

630
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:42,295
and that might require your assets

631
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,356
to be made in a different way.

632
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,458
So you need to have this figured out early

633
00:40:45,898 --> 00:40:47,740
so that you can make all the assets in the same way.

634
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:50,242
How easy is it to debug?

635
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:53,205
So having great debug tools like we did

636
00:40:53,566 --> 00:40:56,369
is really going to make closing the project down a lot easier

637
00:40:56,389 --> 00:40:58,551
and a lot more straightforward and a lot less stressful.

638
00:40:59,816 --> 00:41:02,359
But then what risks is your tech going to introduce,

639
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:04,701
and how comfortable is the team with those risks?

640
00:41:05,322 --> 00:41:06,583
So that's worth considering.

641
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:10,287
And then how flexible is your tech for special cases?

642
00:41:10,307 --> 00:41:11,829
There's always going to be places where

643
00:41:12,249 --> 00:41:13,510
the tech doesn't really work.

644
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:16,734
So for us, that was boss battles or little scripted sequences

645
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:19,436
that we kind of had to work into our tech.

646
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:22,870
And then lastly, what's the bang for buck?

647
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:26,772
So you could come up with the best audio system ever,

648
00:41:26,832 --> 00:41:28,452
the most nuanced and interesting,

649
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,773
but if your average user isn't going to notice it,

650
00:41:31,434 --> 00:41:33,635
what's the point in spending your time and resources on it?

651
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:42,638
So when we sat down to begin the process of making the music

652
00:41:42,698 --> 00:41:46,840
tech, Tom said to me, just make it good enough for a GDC talk.

653
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:49,521
And

654
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:54,208
I didn't, unfortunately, but here we are.

655
00:41:55,529 --> 00:42:01,495
Reason is that too many simultaneous layers and streams totally nuked the engine.

656
00:42:04,337 --> 00:42:14,286
And towards Tom's point of does it have bang for its buck, the team decided that all this

657
00:42:14,446 --> 00:42:15,828
nuanced, interactive...

658
00:42:17,129 --> 00:42:21,533
mixing on the fly and changing out instruments and whatnot,

659
00:42:22,413 --> 00:42:24,795
they didn't notice it and they were working with it

660
00:42:25,696 --> 00:42:29,440
on a day-to-day basis, and it was nuking all of the game.

661
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:32,683
So, in the end.

662
00:42:34,797 --> 00:42:38,719
It ended up music is just based on macro level locations.

663
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:42,741
There's a snow area.

664
00:42:42,941 --> 00:42:44,481
It has two pieces of snow music.

665
00:42:45,242 --> 00:42:46,062
There are caves.

666
00:42:46,102 --> 00:42:47,483
They have two pieces of cave music.

667
00:42:48,563 --> 00:42:50,084
It's way more basic than I wanted,

668
00:42:51,525 --> 00:42:54,706
but it is how it worked out.

669
00:42:55,527 --> 00:42:57,688
So how do I spin that as positive?

670
00:42:58,448 --> 00:43:02,570
Because when you are working on an indie title.

671
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:10,125
As opposed to a AAA title, you don't have the infrastructure that you get from a AAA

672
00:43:10,185 --> 00:43:11,145
development studio.

673
00:43:11,786 --> 00:43:17,051
So if you're going to go out and try and promote the game, you're going to have to hire a

674
00:43:19,412 --> 00:43:23,114
PR company, or you're going to have to do a lot of legwork yourself trying to line up

675
00:43:23,154 --> 00:43:26,476
interviews with podcasts and websites.

676
00:43:27,757 --> 00:43:35,782
So the PR hook that I decided to go with was, oh, music's handled like a throwback shoutout

677
00:43:35,862 --> 00:43:38,403
to the classic NES games I grew up loving.

678
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:44,631
Um, which is true, it functions that way, but it's not the goal I set out to do.

679
00:43:45,412 --> 00:43:52,918
Um, but it sounded like a positive, and I could instead, um, hang my hat on the creative

680
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:57,942
element of the score, the dichotomy of opposites thing that I had worked so hard at with the

681
00:43:58,143 --> 00:43:58,943
music's production.

682
00:43:59,864 --> 00:44:05,769
Um, and I could let go, uh, the ability to talk about the music tech.

683
00:44:08,071 --> 00:44:08,191
So.

684
00:44:09,238 --> 00:44:15,180
All right, well, in summary, build your relationships

685
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:18,202
and gain understanding before talking money

686
00:44:18,382 --> 00:44:19,322
with new developers.

687
00:44:19,702 --> 00:44:22,704
Relationships really are what this business is all about.

688
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:26,205
Take all of your risks in pre-production

689
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,966
and have all your systems working in pre-production.

690
00:44:28,986 --> 00:44:32,528
It's really going to make production that much easier.

691
00:44:32,748 --> 00:44:34,048
Do all your panicking early.

692
00:44:35,471 --> 00:44:39,675
Maintain regular communication with the team. It really is the lifeblood of the project.

693
00:44:40,436 --> 00:44:45,682
There was some times when we got a bit crunchy where that failed and it caused us loads of problems.

694
00:44:45,802 --> 00:44:47,043
Always causes problems.

695
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:50,386
Live instruments and field recording are awesome. Do that.

696
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:57,151
Indie projects often don't have the infrastructure of AAA.

697
00:44:57,271 --> 00:45:01,412
So often you don't have QA, PR, or marketing,

698
00:45:01,452 --> 00:45:03,432
though we did from Team17, and they were awesome.

699
00:45:04,573 --> 00:45:06,233
But other projects haven't had that.

700
00:45:07,233 --> 00:45:08,594
So you have to plan for that.

701
00:45:08,994 --> 00:45:11,154
And then you have no institutional limitations.

702
00:45:11,174 --> 00:45:12,574
So often you've got no NDA, which

703
00:45:12,614 --> 00:45:14,195
means we could tweet about it and talk about it.

704
00:45:14,455 --> 00:45:15,995
That was pretty amazing, the ability

705
00:45:16,015 --> 00:45:20,056
to just screenshot Saturday anything I was working on.

706
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,156
That never happens in AAA.

707
00:45:22,802 --> 00:45:26,065
Yeah, it meant we could come to GDC and actually tell people what we were doing, which is great.

708
00:45:27,426 --> 00:45:29,027
And that's it. Thank you.

709
00:45:29,267 --> 00:45:29,588
Thank you.

710
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:33,090
Applause

711
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,191
Look at that. Look at that.

712
00:45:34,652 --> 00:45:35,072
Applause

713
00:45:39,075 --> 00:45:39,816
Any questions?

714
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,880
Oh, do you want to come?

715
00:45:45,901 --> 00:45:46,721
Do you want to come?

716
00:45:47,592 --> 00:45:48,872
How many devs at Villa Gorilla?

717
00:45:49,412 --> 00:45:52,114
The answer is, at the moment, one.

718
00:45:53,714 --> 00:45:55,795
At the height of the game, four.

719
00:45:55,815 --> 00:45:56,656
I think it was five.

720
00:45:56,876 --> 00:45:57,196
Five?

721
00:45:57,316 --> 00:45:58,456
Yeah.

722
00:45:59,577 --> 00:46:05,720
But there were sort of two main guys throughout the, oh, yeah.

723
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,380
Well, I'm not counting us in that five.

724
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,461
Are you counting us in that five?

725
00:46:08,501 --> 00:46:09,221
No, not counting us.

726
00:46:09,281 --> 00:46:11,402
OK, so somewhere around less than 10.

727
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:14,779
for the development of the whole thing.

728
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,702
Yeah, it was a very small team. It was primarily Jens and Matthias,

729
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:21,586
and then they brought on extra people as they got closer to completion.

730
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:22,107
Right.

731
00:46:24,103 --> 00:46:26,544
Hello, thank you for the awesome talk.

732
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:30,687
I had a question about one of the first things that you said.

733
00:46:31,227 --> 00:46:37,231
So I'm a composer and I'm doing music for independent projects and I'm always worried

734
00:46:37,391 --> 00:46:41,954
about the possibility of getting my payment in royalties.

735
00:46:42,194 --> 00:46:49,038
I have always accepted like a fixed fee because I don't exactly know how that works on the

736
00:46:49,078 --> 00:46:49,639
long term.

737
00:46:51,128 --> 00:46:56,609
Do they keep track of their sales and send them to you, the numbers, for infinity?

738
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:59,430
Like, the Steam sales? How does that work?

739
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:00,971
I mean, they're supposed to.

740
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:05,372
Does that happen in reality? No.

741
00:47:06,272 --> 00:47:07,312
You have to chase it down.

742
00:47:08,353 --> 00:47:10,013
Because... And it's like that with everything.

743
00:47:10,173 --> 00:47:10,853
I mean, you talk to...

744
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:16,757
You talk to people who have royalties through TV and film,

745
00:47:16,797 --> 00:47:18,880
and they're always talking about how you have to chase

746
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,621
down stuff, too.

747
00:47:19,801 --> 00:47:25,988
So no one out there is dying to give you royalties.

748
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:29,872
And so you're going to have to keep tabs on it.

749
00:47:30,459 --> 00:47:34,640
But, sorry, would you be doing that in 15 years,

750
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,040
be sending mail to the developers?

751
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:40,241
Well, you have to, okay, so you have to be realistic about games

752
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:47,382
because there is an extraordinarily steep fall-off curve of sales.

753
00:47:49,823 --> 00:47:53,724
Take, for instance, when the game came out,

754
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:56,304
I set up some Twitter notifications

755
00:47:56,744 --> 00:47:58,825
just to see how much Twitter was talking about the game.

756
00:47:59,782 --> 00:48:05,064
Nine months later now, and there's almost no mention of it on Twitter anymore,

757
00:48:05,264 --> 00:48:07,305
except for when the game itself is saying like,

758
00:48:07,325 --> 00:48:11,987
hey, we're on sale, or hey, we've been nominated for these awards, or whatever.

759
00:48:13,544 --> 00:48:16,085
But you don't get a lot of people talking about it.

760
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,467
And so there are ways for you to gauge

761
00:48:19,388 --> 00:48:22,810
how much life the project has in it still.

762
00:48:23,711 --> 00:48:26,513
And as long as there's life in it, I'd say chase it down.

763
00:48:26,553 --> 00:48:29,936
But 15 years from now, I think that that'd be crazy,

764
00:48:30,036 --> 00:48:31,337
to be trying to chase down.

765
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:33,478
In fact, you'd be annoying the hell out of your developer.

766
00:48:33,899 --> 00:48:34,679
15 years from now, you're like,

767
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:36,661
where are my royalties from 15 years ago?

768
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,830
You gotta judge the life of the project.

769
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,731
And keep tabs on it, you know.

770
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:48,371
If, you know, four years, it's not unheard of

771
00:48:48,471 --> 00:48:51,012
that four years later some new console will come out

772
00:48:51,052 --> 00:48:53,532
and suddenly it's, you know, a game that came out.

773
00:48:54,812 --> 00:48:57,113
How many consoles is Skyrim on now?

774
00:48:58,093 --> 00:49:00,834
Every toaster that comes out now has Skyrim on it.

775
00:49:01,274 --> 00:49:04,934
So that thing's got some life to it still, you know.

776
00:49:05,114 --> 00:49:06,054
So keep tabs on that.

777
00:49:06,315 --> 00:49:06,855
Thank you very much.

778
00:49:07,075 --> 00:49:07,215
Sure.

779
00:49:10,236 --> 00:49:15,361
I have a question. When you do a contract, how often do you retain IP of the music you

780
00:49:15,401 --> 00:49:19,084
make? Is it all the time or part-time? And my second follow-up question then is, if you

781
00:49:19,104 --> 00:49:23,828
do have a clause that says you retain IP, how do you word it so that the developer still

782
00:49:23,848 --> 00:49:27,732
has the freedom to have that music and they want to use it, I guess, for another version

783
00:49:27,752 --> 00:49:28,973
of the game or something like that?

784
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:35,775
The answer to that question is basically how much are they willing to pay you.

785
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:40,436
The less they're willing to pay you, the more you should own the music.

786
00:49:42,097 --> 00:49:47,959
With Yoku's Island Express, they own only one piece of music, and I own all of the rest

787
00:49:47,999 --> 00:49:48,179
of it.

788
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:50,240
They bought the main theme.

789
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,902
They gave me written permission to be able to put it on the soundtrack, but everything

790
00:49:57,962 --> 00:49:58,763
else I own.

791
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:00,683
And I can do whatever I want with it.

792
00:50:00,763 --> 00:50:00,983
I could...

793
00:50:01,701 --> 00:50:04,323
Send it to music licensing houses.

794
00:50:04,443 --> 00:50:08,887
I can stick it all over Spotify if it's on Spotify.

795
00:50:13,336 --> 00:50:16,439
You just have to spell it out with them.

796
00:50:19,382 --> 00:50:23,886
It basically comes down to this balance of

797
00:50:24,486 --> 00:50:27,049
how low are you willing to accept a payment

798
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:30,032
versus how much are you willing to give them

799
00:50:30,052 --> 00:50:33,014
of that music forever.

800
00:50:35,222 --> 00:50:36,702
And it's a balancing act.

801
00:50:37,142 --> 00:50:37,922
Does that answer the question?

802
00:50:38,462 --> 00:50:38,722
Almost.

803
00:50:38,922 --> 00:50:43,423
So in the future, if they wanted to make like Yoku Mastered on a new platform or something like that,

804
00:50:43,483 --> 00:50:44,924
they wanted to use that music again,

805
00:50:45,484 --> 00:50:49,125
would you have to renegotiate a new contract with them to have them use that music again?

806
00:50:49,245 --> 00:50:53,986
I'd have to renegotiate the contract if they wanted to do another game, a sequel, and reuse the same music.

807
00:50:54,286 --> 00:50:57,886
I'd have to renegotiate with them for everything except the main theme, which they own,

808
00:50:58,287 --> 00:51:03,028
and everything else they couldn't use without renegotiating with them.

809
00:51:03,328 --> 00:51:03,788
Thank you very much.

810
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,500
Hello, great talk.

811
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:09,980
Thanks.

812
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,701
I was surprised when you said Materia Collective.

813
00:51:13,002 --> 00:51:17,363
I'm a record collector and they've been doing a lot of really nice vinyl releases recently.

814
00:51:17,503 --> 00:51:17,803
That's right.

815
00:51:18,264 --> 00:51:22,065
And I was wondering if you have been considering working with them on possibly putting out

816
00:51:22,105 --> 00:51:23,245
the soundtrack on vinyl.

817
00:51:24,266 --> 00:51:24,646
I'd love to.

818
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:29,028
The question was have I considered putting out the soundtrack to Yokozuna Express on

819
00:51:29,068 --> 00:51:29,368
vinyl.

820
00:51:30,408 --> 00:51:31,809
I would love to put the soundtrack out on vinyl.

821
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:37,522
And the big question in that regard is,

822
00:51:37,702 --> 00:51:39,923
is there a record company that wants to take the risk

823
00:51:40,744 --> 00:51:42,585
on a soundtrack for an indie game?

824
00:51:44,628 --> 00:51:48,430
It got a ton of creative accolades.

825
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:51,951
It got a ton of critical press really loving it.

826
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:58,053
Has it done as well in sales?

827
00:51:58,914 --> 00:51:59,934
Not so much.

828
00:52:00,694 --> 00:52:04,596
So that's basically a risk that the record labels

829
00:52:04,636 --> 00:52:05,216
would have to take.

830
00:52:05,276 --> 00:52:06,657
I've had a couple people approach me.

831
00:52:07,017 --> 00:52:07,657
I've talked to them.

832
00:52:08,577 --> 00:52:11,581
Nothing's really happened yet, but I'd love to do it.

833
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:16,467
It would be my third album on vinyl, and I don't own a

834
00:52:16,527 --> 00:52:19,370
record player, which is funny to me.

835
00:52:21,491 --> 00:52:25,334
My first ever soundtrack was for the game Counter Spy.

836
00:52:26,035 --> 00:52:31,399
And the creative head of the project just liked the music

837
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,282
so much that he did a small vinyl pressing of the

838
00:52:34,322 --> 00:52:36,103
soundtrack and handed it to me.

839
00:52:36,123 --> 00:52:37,284
And I was like, this is awesome.

840
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:39,887
I got my first soundtrack ever, and I have no way to

841
00:52:39,947 --> 00:52:40,707
actually listen to it.

842
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:42,889
Anyway, that's off topic.

843
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:43,510
Thank you.

844
00:52:45,231 --> 00:52:46,372
I don't know if that answers your question.

845
00:52:47,073 --> 00:52:47,633
It does, thank you.

846
00:52:47,793 --> 00:52:47,833
OK.

847
00:52:52,184 --> 00:52:53,865
So this is a question for Jesse.

848
00:52:54,245 --> 00:52:56,787
I really appreciated what you had to say about the challenge

849
00:52:56,827 --> 00:53:00,270
of starting with no creative constraints whatsoever.

850
00:53:01,832 --> 00:53:05,255
I work with a lot of students who are learning how to do

851
00:53:05,295 --> 00:53:07,697
game audio, and that's one of the things that we struggle

852
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:10,119
with is trying to set up some creative

853
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:10,919
constraints for them.

854
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:14,502
But I was struck by what you said about in the AAA world

855
00:53:14,603 --> 00:53:17,525
how they hand you a pretty specific brief.

856
00:53:18,045 --> 00:53:18,206
Yeah.

857
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:21,368
So what I wanted to hear was your thoughts on what would be

858
00:53:21,388 --> 00:53:22,409
a good approach for students.

859
00:53:22,709 --> 00:53:25,732
Do you want to give them a specific set of things,

860
00:53:26,012 --> 00:53:27,313
follow this template exactly?

861
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:30,015
Do you want to give them a range of parameters?

862
00:53:30,115 --> 00:53:32,377
What do you think would serve their interest best?

863
00:53:33,538 --> 00:53:36,780
So the question is, what is the best way to serve students

864
00:53:37,421 --> 00:53:41,965
when it comes to educating them about how to begin a

865
00:53:42,025 --> 00:53:43,526
project by way of briefs?

866
00:53:44,126 --> 00:53:44,246
Yes?

867
00:53:45,432 --> 00:53:45,933
That'll do, yeah.

868
00:53:45,953 --> 00:53:46,895
Okay.

869
00:53:47,577 --> 00:53:54,013
And I would say the best answer really is to give them a number of...

870
00:53:56,129 --> 00:53:57,190
different things.

871
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:00,492
I'm going to have a couple different projects where you give them a couple different versions

872
00:54:00,572 --> 00:54:00,752
of it.

873
00:54:02,053 --> 00:54:05,195
Because they're going to end up dealing with a whole lot of different things.

874
00:54:05,215 --> 00:54:10,559
They're going to have projects where, like right now I'm working on a project where

875
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:17,404
it has a temp score and they just want me to recreate the temp score as close as I can

876
00:54:17,484 --> 00:54:18,965
without infringing copyright.

877
00:54:19,826 --> 00:54:26,354
And that's not super creatively rewarding, but it's a job.

878
00:54:26,754 --> 00:54:31,319
And it's with a company that I really like, so I'm happy to do it.

879
00:54:32,861 --> 00:54:35,484
But then you also have other situations where the...

880
00:54:36,225 --> 00:54:39,407
And then you've got this unicorn where they said, just do whatever you want.

881
00:54:52,809 --> 00:54:56,150
I had a really interesting project I worked on at LucasArts.

882
00:54:56,330 --> 00:55:00,090
This is one of my favorite things the creative director has ever done for me.

883
00:55:00,711 --> 00:55:02,071
They brought me onto the project.

884
00:55:02,451 --> 00:55:04,371
They said, here are the characters.

885
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:08,972
Here are some real solid descriptions of what the characters are like.

886
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:15,153
What I'd love for you to do is put together an iPod playlist of what each of these characters

887
00:55:15,253 --> 00:55:15,893
listens to.

888
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:20,054
Get in their head what kind of stuff they like.

889
00:55:21,836 --> 00:55:24,937
And I found that to be fascinating as an experiment.

890
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:30,920
It made me really understand where they were coming from as characters,

891
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:37,444
and it made me listen to a ton of stuff that was not film scores and game scores.

892
00:55:38,184 --> 00:55:40,045
And it made me pull in

893
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:45,406
influences from all over the place

894
00:55:46,227 --> 00:55:48,368
that I wouldn't have normally gotten.

895
00:55:48,408 --> 00:55:50,889
I got like really into checking out the,

896
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:55,951
like at the time very underground Chinese hip hop scene

897
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,832
because of this, and it was really cool.

898
00:55:57,872 --> 00:55:58,792
It was a great experiment.

899
00:56:00,013 --> 00:56:03,435
So, you know, I'd say try and give them

900
00:56:03,455 --> 00:56:07,076
as many opportunities to be flexible or inflexible

901
00:56:07,196 --> 00:56:09,938
as is often the case as you can

902
00:56:10,138 --> 00:56:11,358
because that's what they'll really face.

903
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:13,556
Thanks a lot, that's really helpful.

904
00:56:13,816 --> 00:56:13,977
Sure.

905
00:56:16,718 --> 00:56:19,018
Okay, we've got about four minutes,

906
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:20,839
so if there's any other questions,

907
00:56:20,979 --> 00:56:23,280
please feel free to ask,

908
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,241
but otherwise, thanks for coming, everybody.

909
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:26,902
Any other questions?

910
00:56:28,702 --> 00:56:29,503
I shouldn't have said that.

911
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:31,583
Oh, we have one question, we have one question.

912
00:56:31,603 --> 00:56:31,703
Okay.

913
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:38,694
I'm sorry, I'm late with my question.

914
00:56:39,595 --> 00:56:44,879
How long it takes to build its middleware, underwear?

915
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,440
Sorry, could you repeat that?

916
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,142
How long it takes to build underwear?

917
00:56:48,182 --> 00:56:48,422
Yeah.

918
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:50,263
To build underwear, yeah.

919
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:54,587
So Jens was on this project for five years,

920
00:56:55,528 --> 00:56:58,270
and he built the engine from scratch specifically for this.

921
00:56:59,671 --> 00:57:05,315
So I guess over the duration of that, five years, but probably

922
00:57:06,227 --> 00:57:10,233
You know, I can't say exactly without asking Jens, but I would imagine a couple of years

923
00:57:10,253 --> 00:57:13,858
because that was when he approached us and the tool was mostly stood up by that point.

924
00:57:13,898 --> 00:57:18,504
So you didn't do this for this game specifically?

925
00:57:18,524 --> 00:57:24,072
No, he did. Jens, the creative director on the project...

926
00:57:24,667 --> 00:57:31,172
He built underwear specifically for this project and probably worked on it for about two years

927
00:57:31,233 --> 00:57:34,875
or so, got it into a really good shape before he brought us onto the project.

928
00:57:35,336 --> 00:57:40,040
And then once we came onto the project, Tom thankfully talked him into using Wwise, so

929
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:44,583
then we had nicely integrated audio tools and didn't have to worry about building that.

930
00:57:45,824 --> 00:57:49,888
And so then we were able to just do our work with Wise

931
00:57:50,048 --> 00:57:54,232
while Jens continued to build underwear off on the side

932
00:57:54,872 --> 00:57:55,533
for what he needed.

933
00:57:56,453 --> 00:57:57,034
Thank you so much.

934
00:57:57,374 --> 00:57:57,494
Sure.

935
00:57:57,514 --> 00:57:57,835
Thank you.

936
00:57:57,855 --> 00:57:58,976
All right.

937
00:58:00,203 --> 00:58:01,724
So, I think we have time.

938
00:58:02,025 --> 00:58:02,625
Yeah, we have time.

939
00:58:02,665 --> 00:58:03,106
One more question.

940
00:58:03,126 --> 00:58:03,546
Go ahead.

941
00:58:03,586 --> 00:58:04,567
Yeah.

942
00:58:04,587 --> 00:58:05,148
Thank you, by the way.

943
00:58:05,929 --> 00:58:09,933
The licensing scheme for Wise, does that expand if you want to integrate it into a

944
00:58:09,973 --> 00:58:12,235
custom engine or is it more expensive?

945
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:16,980
It is obviously a little bit more laborious, but what was the sense from Jens and the project

946
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,702
of how much that factored into it?

947
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:21,243
Sorry, I'm not sure I fully understand.

948
00:58:21,423 --> 00:58:24,365
So the question is about the licensing of Wwise.

949
00:58:24,986 --> 00:58:28,728
And how does that work with a custom engine?

950
00:58:29,129 --> 00:58:32,011
And I think that the tier, if someone can correct me if I'm

951
00:58:32,031 --> 00:58:32,231
wrong.

952
00:58:32,311 --> 00:58:33,232
I mean, I can speak to this.

953
00:58:33,432 --> 00:58:37,414
I mean, the license from a cost point of view, you'll

954
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:39,356
find it actually all on the Audio Kinetic website.

955
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:43,399
So you can see how it's all laid out and the tiers.

956
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:46,401
So it's based on the total, I think.

957
00:58:47,037 --> 00:58:50,278
It's a production budget of the title.

958
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:53,879
So there's no like, oh, custom engine implementation,

959
00:58:53,899 --> 00:58:54,599
search engine, or anything?

960
00:58:54,619 --> 00:58:59,020
No, it's more like indie scale, triple A scale, sized games.

961
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,321
It doesn't have to do with the size of your engine or work on your engine.

962
00:59:03,441 --> 00:59:08,582
The cost, they don't really factor in whether you're using Unreal or building your own engine.

963
00:59:08,982 --> 00:59:14,543
The integration side is kind of your part of the deal.

964
00:59:14,903 --> 00:59:15,143
Thank you.

965
00:59:15,543 --> 00:59:15,903
Thank you.

966
00:59:16,183 --> 00:59:16,363
Sure.

967
00:59:16,403 --> 00:59:16,543
Well.

968
00:59:16,947 --> 00:59:17,930
I guess that's all we've got time for.

969
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:18,794
So thank you, everyone.

970
00:59:18,994 --> 00:59:19,516
Thanks, everybody.

971
00:59:21,203 --> 00:59:21,604
Look at that.
