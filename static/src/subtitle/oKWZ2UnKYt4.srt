1
00:00:06,927 --> 00:00:10,289
So 2017 was a very good year for open world video games.

2
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,313
We saw great games like Assassin's Creed Origins,

3
00:00:16,794 --> 00:00:19,196
Horizons Zero Dawn, and obviously,

4
00:00:19,856 --> 00:00:22,478
Zelda Battle of the Wild.

5
00:00:22,558 --> 00:00:24,480
All these three games deliver a great

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,763
player freedom experience, but also an epic story.

7
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:35,966
Today I will show you what we create,

8
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:37,447
some kind of experience in Assassin's Creed.

9
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:39,769
But first, some little word about me.

10
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,731
So my name is Jean-Marie-Santoni-Costantini.

11
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:44,653
I'm a gameplay programmer at Ubisoft.

12
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:48,657
And I work in video games for 12 years now.

13
00:00:48,797 --> 00:00:51,339
I work in a lot of Raving Rabbid games.

14
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:54,742
And now I work on the Assassin's Creed franchise

15
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,403
for two years.

16
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:02,848
So Ubisoft created Assassin's Creed.

17
00:01:03,894 --> 00:01:07,935
10 years now, and the formula was very good

18
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,815
and not appreciated by the player.

19
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:17,398
Okay.

20
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,639
So Ubisoft created Assassin's Creed 10 years ago

21
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:24,540
and make it very cool and very appreciated

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,261
by the community, but after all this year,

23
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:30,782
it seems we need to renew the experience

24
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:32,642
and bring some new stuff for the player.

25
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:36,042
Meanwhile, the competition brings some new ideas

26
00:01:36,462 --> 00:01:39,003
about player agency, about player freedom.

27
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:42,644
And we felt we can inspire from this kind of games

28
00:01:42,744 --> 00:01:46,225
to improve the Assassin's Creed experience.

29
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:51,647
An Assassin's Creed experience, it's a linear narrative.

30
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:54,708
That means the designer won't expect the player

31
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:57,509
to do specific stuff in a specific order

32
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:58,609
to achieve a mission.

33
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,870
Meanwhile, for the competition,

34
00:02:01,763 --> 00:02:03,844
Now we have more an open objective approach.

35
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:06,164
That means we ask the player to do something,

36
00:02:06,884 --> 00:02:09,085
but not to do how he has to do it.

37
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:11,545
That means the player will create his own experience,

38
00:02:11,585 --> 00:02:13,526
he will tackle the objective to do the mission

39
00:02:13,586 --> 00:02:14,286
and what they want.

40
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,586
What you try to do in Assassin's Creed Origins

41
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,427
is to mix these two approach

42
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,667
to create a new kind of experience.

43
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,968
To achieve this, we use goal-oriented NPC.

44
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:27,888
And especially, you use goal-oriented NPC

45
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:29,308
to create narrative moment.

46
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:34,508
To illustrate this, I will show you a typical quest

47
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:37,270
that we can play in Assassin's Creed Origins.

48
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,930
No.

49
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,731
You know what the plan is.

50
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:42,312
So in this situation, you have a player

51
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:45,394
who is coming and sees some rebel waiting

52
00:02:45,454 --> 00:02:46,755
to close to a campfire.

53
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:49,676
The important thing is to hold the fire.

54
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:50,497
The dialogue will start.

55
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:51,177
What is happening here?

56
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:55,123
Down there, one of our own has been captured by Flaketai.

57
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:55,704
Flaketai?

58
00:02:55,764 --> 00:02:59,148
You're plotting an ambush?

59
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:01,111
Just waiting for the right moment.

60
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:02,553
We could use an extra sword.

61
00:03:02,593 --> 00:03:03,815
Our gratitude goes a long way.

62
00:03:06,675 --> 00:03:11,497
So we have a narrative set up that means the rebel will make an ambush.

63
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:16,419
So now the NPC takes their horse and prepares the ambush.

64
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,361
This is done by using goal-oriented NPCs.

65
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:24,523
And this is what I will tell you in the first part of my talk.

66
00:03:25,843 --> 00:03:29,665
So now the target arrives and the fight can start.

67
00:03:34,643 --> 00:03:36,844
The rebel will fight with the player.

68
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,005
You should have killed me!

69
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:39,185
Now you've died!

70
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:40,086
And we have a fight.

71
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:44,508
At the end of the fight, the player will free the prisoner.

72
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:49,750
The important thing is to see that this situation can happen anywhere in the world.

73
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,471
It's not especially at this place.

74
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:56,013
Any player will have a different place where the situation will happen.

75
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,034
So the player should have the dialogue to the player.

76
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:01,168
We pass to the next step of the quest.

77
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:06,513
And at the end, the NPC will take the first horse close to him

78
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:08,595
to lead the player to the next objective.

79
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:11,377
So the NPC will adapt to the situation.

80
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:13,139
He sees our horse, he will take one.

81
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:15,941
He sees our horse, he will just get on foot

82
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:19,484
and he will go gently, smoothly to the next part of the quest.

83
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:27,812
So, what we're using, you're going to see

84
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,876
in PC in Assassin's Creed Origins.

85
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:35,147
First, what we want to achieve is to standardize NPC behavior,

86
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:39,248
because we don't want to have different behavior for NPC

87
00:04:39,308 --> 00:04:41,408
between the open world and between the mission.

88
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:43,429
We want, for example, for a soldier

89
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:45,989
to have the same behavior in the same way.

90
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:48,990
We don't want to create a coherent world for the player.

91
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,251
We don't want now to have anymore soldiers scripted

92
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,831
with a different behavior for a specific mission.

93
00:04:55,572 --> 00:05:00,055
Next, because now our mission are all playing the same time,

94
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:03,058
we want also to manage the open world cow.

95
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:05,100
That means at any moment in a mission,

96
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,782
you can have an animal or something that can happen,

97
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:10,724
something the mission general doesn't expect.

98
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:14,828
And we want the NPC to continue to do what we ask him to do.

99
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:20,292
To achieve this, what we need is having more autonomous NPC.

100
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,302
If we go back to the quest shown previously,

101
00:05:27,402 --> 00:05:28,523
let's take a larger view.

102
00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:29,823
What can you see here?

103
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:34,165
We can see some soldier escorting a cart.

104
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:38,427
Inside the cart we have a prisoner

105
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:41,668
and we have the rebel waiting to ambush.

106
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:46,070
What we've done here, we gave a role to each NPC

107
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,531
and we adjust to let them act to make the situation happens.

108
00:05:50,372 --> 00:05:51,152
It's what I will do.

109
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,052
So the cart advance, the ambush starts.

110
00:05:58,412 --> 00:06:00,954
Even if the player is not involved in this situation,

111
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:04,656
the NPC will do what the job order says for them.

112
00:06:05,176 --> 00:06:07,878
The cart will flee because he feels there is a danger,

113
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:10,599
and we have a chase that starts,

114
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:12,580
and the player can participate or not.

115
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,261
The situation will continue to happen.

116
00:06:17,763 --> 00:06:19,724
If we go back to the description

117
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:21,725
of what the soldier is currently doing,

118
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:22,586
we have a sentence.

119
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:25,990
soldier on earth escorting a cart.

120
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,932
From this we can extract a goal is the cart,

121
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:35,054
we can extract a behavior is escorting,

122
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:38,676
and you can also extract the way the soldier

123
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:41,158
is currently doing the escort, it's on earth.

124
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:44,239
If we assume these three elements,

125
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,682
we create what we call in production a contextual behavior.

126
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:57,791
Contextual behavior are narrative situations that we push on the NPC.

127
00:06:58,191 --> 00:06:59,132
So I have an example.

128
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:03,734
If you want to create a basic setup where you have some attackers that want to steal a chest,

129
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:07,435
just say, okay, attacker will have a contextual behavior attack.

130
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:11,917
Just give a different contextual behavior to the NPC that have to defend the chest.

131
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:15,576
We don't want to script this kind of situation.

132
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:19,257
We just want to make the NPC do what they have to do

133
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:23,298
and respond to the world and not do specific stuff.

134
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,459
So how to create a contextual behavior in your game?

135
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,680
If you go back to the three elements that

136
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,661
compose a contextual behavior, let's focus first on the goal.

137
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:39,822
First, the goal should be unique.

138
00:07:40,582 --> 00:07:40,782
But.

139
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:44,104
The NPC can have some sub-targets.

140
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:48,685
As an example, if, for example, you ask an NPC to protect an NPC,

141
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:52,787
the goal will always be the NPC they have to protect,

142
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:55,708
but while you're fighting, the NPC can have some sub-target,

143
00:07:55,888 --> 00:07:58,489
the current opponent that you're currently facing off.

144
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,791
Next, we want the contextual behavior to be persistent.

145
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:06,533
That means, even if the player goes very far from the situation,

146
00:08:06,593 --> 00:08:09,674
from the gameplay situation, we want the contextual behavior to continue.

147
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:11,795
We want the NPC to continue to act.

148
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:15,354
So for this, we need the goal to be persistent.

149
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:19,857
And next, the goal can be something specific

150
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,120
found close to the player, or it can be found

151
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,161
with any criteria.

152
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,643
For example, any guard close to the player.

153
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:30,406
Some example of goal that we have in your game,

154
00:08:30,446 --> 00:08:34,009
so it can be the player, can be a unique NPC,

155
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:37,813
it can be a static location, like an outpost,

156
00:08:38,974 --> 00:08:40,815
or it can be any of these two guards.

157
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,700
Now about the behavior.

158
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,181
The behavior is the action associated with the goal.

159
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,442
We want to have the same behavior

160
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:52,563
between the open world and the mission.

161
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:56,024
That's why we try to make the same behavior for both.

162
00:08:57,965 --> 00:09:00,085
Some example of behavior that we have in our game

163
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:02,346
is we have the search, for example,

164
00:09:02,406 --> 00:09:03,747
and Percy's searching for someone.

165
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:07,368
You have the ambush, so the NPC is crouching,

166
00:09:07,728 --> 00:09:09,309
waiting to make the ambush.

167
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,387
And you can also having some NPC following their leader

168
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:15,628
for an epic ride across the desert.

169
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,611
Next, we have the parameters.

170
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:22,193
So the parameters will adapt the logic to the context.

171
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:25,475
So it will give the situation more credible for the player.

172
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:30,038
We don't want to expose all parameters to designer

173
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:33,160
because we want to have, again, some coherent behavior.

174
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,602
So if now we expose all the parameters,

175
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:38,464
we can have some unbelievable behavior.

176
00:09:39,447 --> 00:09:42,409
Some example of parameters that we have,

177
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:43,569
you can have the speed.

178
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:47,571
Another example is what we call the awareness state,

179
00:09:47,691 --> 00:09:50,852
is how the NPC is feeling the danger.

180
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:52,673
So if the NPC is feeling a danger,

181
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:56,415
he will have his weapon and shaft ready to start the fight.

182
00:09:58,235 --> 00:10:00,737
Some example of contextual behavior that we have in our game.

183
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:06,403
For each example, you can see the goal, the behavior,

184
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:07,444
and the parameters.

185
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:10,846
So in this case, it's a different contextual behavior.

186
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:13,968
So some NPC was assigned to defend the fort.

187
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:17,670
Here, the important thing is to see that Mission Designer

188
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,231
doesn't control where the NPC will go.

189
00:10:20,772 --> 00:10:23,433
That means each NPC will be assigned by himself

190
00:10:23,893 --> 00:10:27,015
to a patrol point, and will be wandering inside the fort.

191
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:31,736
Another example is a search.

192
00:10:31,996 --> 00:10:34,917
So in this case, we have some NPCs searching for the player.

193
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:36,438
So it's the same thing.

194
00:10:36,518 --> 00:10:39,700
The NPC was spreading around the world by themselves.

195
00:10:44,888 --> 00:10:47,730
And the next one is the bodyguard.

196
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,732
So some NPC are protecting the unique important NPC.

197
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:56,094
So if the unique important NPC is doing something,

198
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,654
the bodyguard are waiting for him.

199
00:10:57,954 --> 00:11:00,736
And as soon as he starts to walk, he will start to follow him.

200
00:11:01,816 --> 00:11:04,117
Here again, the important thing is the mission designer

201
00:11:04,137 --> 00:11:05,698
has enough to manage this kind of issue.

202
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:09,560
That means the bodyguard knows how to wait for his target,

203
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,600
how he has to follow him.

204
00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:15,639
To achieve this kind of behavior,

205
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:17,060
to achieve this kind of control, we

206
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,502
need to use the environment to help the NPC to act.

207
00:11:22,242 --> 00:11:28,065
If we go back again to the ambush situation, let's see.

208
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:28,526
OK.

209
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:31,787
Let's take a larger view.

210
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,870
In fact, we have what we call the AI network.

211
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,531
The AI network, it's a network.

212
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:44,866
that helps the NPC to find some position to do what request.

213
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:48,688
So for here, we can see we have the NPC position

214
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:51,849
that can be used for an NPC that want to ambush on foot.

215
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:54,570
We have also some NPC positions,

216
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,131
if the NPC has to do the ambush on horse.

217
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:01,664
And also we have what we call the trigger area.

218
00:12:02,064 --> 00:12:03,685
When the target will enter the trigger,

219
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:04,825
the ambush will start.

220
00:12:05,305 --> 00:12:07,726
Because the NPC have these three elements,

221
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:12,108
they can do their ambush by himself and do the one thing.

222
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:16,149
This kind of setup will have a lot in your game.

223
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:20,831
For example, we have another ambush setup.

224
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:24,846
For the defend, we have a trigger zone

225
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:26,487
that defines the defend area.

226
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:29,207
That means the NPC will stay inside the fork.

227
00:12:29,227 --> 00:12:32,348
The NPC will be leashed inside the trigger.

228
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:37,489
And for the bodyguard, which is a table where the NPC was

229
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:39,550
writing something, we have the position

230
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:44,371
where the bodyguard will wait for the very important NPC.

231
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:50,672
So common rules that we have for any contextual behavior

232
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:51,292
in your game.

233
00:12:56,024 --> 00:13:00,548
We want any contextual behavior to be interrupted and resume automatically.

234
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:05,133
If, for example, the player shoots someone, the convoy will stop.

235
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:08,155
The NPC will start an investigation.

236
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:13,480
One of the NPC on earth will go ahead of the convoy to protect the driver.

237
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:19,526
And after a certain amount of time, the convoy will resume automatically.

238
00:13:23,204 --> 00:13:26,007
It's not an edge case, it's a global behavior

239
00:13:26,027 --> 00:13:31,431
that should happen systematically, in a generic way.

240
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:38,977
Another rule that we have for any contextual behavior,

241
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:40,858
we want contextual behavior to be readable.

242
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:44,561
So in this example, if the NPC has some horse

243
00:13:44,581 --> 00:13:46,223
close to them, he will use the horse.

244
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,723
But if for any reason the horse was killed by someone

245
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:55,106
or he was not here, the NPC can continue to do the ambush

246
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:57,649
by just getting the on foot position.

247
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:59,750
This is not managed by the designer.

248
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,831
It's not an edge case.

249
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:03,574
It's what's expected for the generic behavior

250
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,036
to adapt to the current environment state.

251
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:10,610
Another example of contextual behavior

252
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,290
that we have in your game is the goto.

253
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,652
The goto seems very simple, because it's just

254
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:17,592
asking an NPC to go somewhere.

255
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:20,774
But in fact, it was the most complicated contextual behavior

256
00:14:20,814 --> 00:14:21,834
that we had in the game.

257
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:24,695
Because we use a contextual behavior goto

258
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:27,136
to create some narrative moment with the player.

259
00:14:27,942 --> 00:14:34,733
That's why most of the go-to was why we dialogue played between the NPC and the dialogue.

260
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:42,064
We want also the NPC to take a vehicle if there is an opportunity, depending on what the player is currently doing.

261
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:46,000
And we are also something that can manage all the edge cages.

262
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,461
We don't want anymore to have mission designers

263
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:51,282
to manage edge cages depending on what's happened.

264
00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:53,223
If, for example, the vehicle is broken

265
00:14:53,423 --> 00:14:56,524
or if the NPC cannot continue to advance,

266
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:58,885
we don't want them to manage this kind of edge cage.

267
00:14:58,945 --> 00:15:01,386
It should be generic for any mission.

268
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,792
Some example of contextual, of go-to contextual behavior.

269
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:07,953
So we have the walk and talk.

270
00:15:08,093 --> 00:15:10,114
So the NPC is waiting for the player.

271
00:15:10,915 --> 00:15:13,377
I am Aya's cousin, Thanos.

272
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:15,118
Ah, yes, Thanos.

273
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:17,019
Nice to meet you and Farzan.

274
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,000
Tell me what is happening with Aya.

275
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,962
Why are you being so discreet?

276
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:24,684
Genade sent his men on a house-to-house exchange.

277
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:31,751
and at the end of the dialogue automatically the NPC will switch their speed

278
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:35,533
look there's Thanos he thinks he's a

279
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:43,717
was a driven woman stalking deadly prey it so happened that i also had reason to bring down

280
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:51,225
When Aya was successful, I stepped in to protect her.

281
00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:51,826
We are grateful.

282
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:55,328
And we are grateful that you have eliminated Eudorus.

283
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:59,190
He was an odious individual.

284
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:05,454
I should tell you that in addition to Eudorus, I put an end to the philaketai of Alexandria, Gennadius.

285
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:06,815
Gennadius?

286
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:09,123
So NPC we adapt to this.

287
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:14,645
Next, we don't want to have mission fail if the player goes very far for the area.

288
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,886
So we have a message that says, hey, you have to go back to continue the quest.

289
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:22,947
This is not a mission fail, this NPC can wait for the player for a long time.

290
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:30,029
And also in the final fight, NPC will start to fight with the player.

291
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:34,751
At the end of the fight, the NPC will raise you and continue to follow you.

292
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:46,010
About the pros and cons about using contextual behavior,

293
00:16:47,611 --> 00:16:50,473
the major pro is we speed up the debug phase

294
00:16:50,513 --> 00:16:53,376
because when you fix something inside a contextual behavior,

295
00:16:53,396 --> 00:16:54,777
we fix for all the game.

296
00:16:54,877 --> 00:16:57,099
We don't have now to go to every mission

297
00:16:57,499 --> 00:16:59,521
to be sure that every mission has a good quality.

298
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,783
It's something generic, so every mission.

299
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:04,827
We fix the issue in animation.

300
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:06,950
Same thing for the improvements.

301
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,473
As I done the development, we get some feedback

302
00:17:09,513 --> 00:17:13,398
for the playtest, and we can now change the logic

303
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:16,483
behind some of the context inside the code,

304
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,126
and we should ensure all the game will get

305
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,088
the benefits of this.

306
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:28,859
Also we want to have the virtualization, so if the player goes very far, the situation

307
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,902
continues to happen, so it's very important to make a credible world.

308
00:17:32,963 --> 00:17:37,826
When the player goes far and comes back, the NPC is still here, he's not unspawned.

309
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:42,320
About the drawback of fusive contextual behavior,

310
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,261
we have obviously the tech dependency

311
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:47,263
because what we give to mission designer,

312
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:48,744
it's some kind of black box.

313
00:17:49,345 --> 00:17:52,107
If something is not going like mission designer wants,

314
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:54,469
you have to go to the tech guy asking,

315
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:57,131
hey, I want to do this, but it's not working.

316
00:17:57,151 --> 00:17:58,512
It cannot debug by himself.

317
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:03,075
And also because we have created some generic behavior,

318
00:18:03,095 --> 00:18:05,397
it's difficult to create exotic mission.

319
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:12,738
So now I will show you, because you create

320
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,080
this new approach about using NPC,

321
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,282
I will show you what we have to change,

322
00:18:17,302 --> 00:18:19,884
the way we have to think in design mission

323
00:18:20,205 --> 00:18:21,566
in Assassin's Creed Origins.

324
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:27,311
Now we have NPC, I use system,

325
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:31,474
that mean it's, the NPC as part of the system,

326
00:18:31,554 --> 00:18:37,719
it's, that mean the NPC will do stuff from the system.

327
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:42,155
In opposite way, mission designer are used to create

328
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:46,279
specific moment, linear theory of event

329
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,782
to be sure that NPC will act in the way that we want.

330
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:51,463
It's two opposite way.

331
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:56,407
And naively, we believe that we can find a balance

332
00:18:56,647 --> 00:19:01,691
between systemic and skipping something.

333
00:19:02,512 --> 00:19:05,214
But at the end, it was some kind of conflict

334
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:06,555
between these two approach.

335
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:11,765
To illustrate this, I will show you a typical quest scheme.

336
00:19:12,145 --> 00:19:18,971
It's a very simple quest, but to start the quest, the player has to jump into the boat.

337
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:32,233
Would you accept me as a traveling companion?

338
00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:34,194
I will take a new title.

339
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,176
How about Tuttmose the Fierce One?

340
00:19:37,316 --> 00:19:38,737
I travel a lot.

341
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,779
So, the NPC is not here on the boat.

342
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,160
I cannot start the mission.

343
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:47,023
Why is the NPC sometimes not on the boat?

344
00:19:47,663 --> 00:19:50,245
Just because the NPC is doing generic behavior.

345
00:19:50,645 --> 00:19:53,046
That mean, if he's attacked by a crocodile

346
00:19:53,107 --> 00:19:56,669
or something else, then maybe the NPC can die.

347
00:19:58,652 --> 00:20:00,654
Maybe the boat can be destroyed,

348
00:20:00,674 --> 00:20:04,018
or maybe the NPC will just flee

349
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:05,339
because he don't want to die.

350
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,543
It's the generic behavior of the NPC.

351
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,806
But is there issue some bug?

352
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:14,790
But no, but in fact.

353
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:17,030
It's just the generic behavior.

354
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:22,014
But what can I do to do some work around about this?

355
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:24,937
We can maybe give an invincibility to the NPC

356
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:27,039
or give invincibility to the boat.

357
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:30,022
But we don't want to do this because if, for example,

358
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,765
the player takes a boat and do something else inside the world,

359
00:20:33,785 --> 00:20:36,147
but he will get an invincible boat.

360
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:37,769
It's not what we want to give to the player.

361
00:20:39,449 --> 00:20:42,451
And in fact, this kind of issue we have a lot in your game.

362
00:20:42,912 --> 00:20:45,835
For example, we have a request that

363
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:49,458
want to have an NPC with a specific fighting behavior.

364
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:51,861
For example, an NPC which stay like a turret,

365
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:56,465
shooting with her boat, and staying in the same position.

366
00:20:57,446 --> 00:20:59,768
We want some NPC fleeing indefinitely,

367
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:02,851
just waiting that the player is involved in the situation.

368
00:21:04,374 --> 00:21:07,317
We also saw requests about having an NPC

369
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:10,080
that plays the same direction indefinitely.

370
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:14,064
And this kind of issue, we have a lot of, a lot of,

371
00:21:14,465 --> 00:21:16,527
and quite an infinite.

372
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:20,451
So at the end, what we can say,

373
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:24,255
we had a mindset clash between the designer

374
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:25,416
and the programmers.

375
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:29,620
Designer wants to have control.

376
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,903
They want to be sure that they can control the situation

377
00:21:33,003 --> 00:21:34,905
and ask his NPC to do what they want.

378
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:38,488
But as opposite, programmers deliver generic system.

379
00:21:41,404 --> 00:21:43,726
Mission designer wants to have exception,

380
00:21:43,806 --> 00:21:47,288
because in the mission they want to create some twist,

381
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:48,429
they want to create some,

382
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:50,530
they want to surprise the player,

383
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,772
but every time you have some recur for mission designer,

384
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,974
it was difficult because programmer are just very occupied

385
00:21:57,034 --> 00:21:59,156
to just make the normal case work properly.

386
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,178
And during the production, we oscillate

387
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:04,639
between these two approach.

388
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:07,799
It was difficult, it was not tough,

389
00:22:07,939 --> 00:22:10,740
because every time we have to make some choice

390
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,221
to make the designer happy or the programmer happy.

391
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:20,202
But at the end, we found some good recipe,

392
00:22:20,822 --> 00:22:24,423
because we have some review, and the review was good,

393
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:27,664
and we didn't see that the narrative aspect was not...

394
00:22:29,704 --> 00:22:32,445
well, the narrative aspect is good at the end,

395
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:35,526
and the player didn't see that generic behavior.

396
00:22:35,546 --> 00:22:37,486
They see, okay, we have good narrative,

397
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,387
the quest have like handcrafts,

398
00:22:39,887 --> 00:22:41,667
so it's good for us, that means we found

399
00:22:41,687 --> 00:22:43,528
the right balance between too generic

400
00:22:43,788 --> 00:22:46,268
and having something that deliver a cool narrative.

401
00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:54,270
So, if I have to tell a conclusion about this,

402
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,616
I want to share some takeaway.

403
00:22:58,556 --> 00:23:02,499
It will be very useful for us to get it while the production,

404
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:07,141
because we just came from the experience that we get.

405
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:10,504
So first thing, we need to embrace the system.

406
00:23:11,204 --> 00:23:14,886
That means you cannot do some work around about the system.

407
00:23:14,906 --> 00:23:16,487
You cannot have some shortcuts.

408
00:23:16,967 --> 00:23:18,668
If something is not part of the system,

409
00:23:18,748 --> 00:23:20,289
it should not exist in the game.

410
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,612
Prefer flexibility over control.

411
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:29,897
So we prefer to give some flexibility to the quest

412
00:23:29,937 --> 00:23:31,678
to be sure that the quest can happen

413
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:34,680
even if it's not the specific case

414
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,900
that mission designer wants,

415
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,462
but now we prefer to get the flexibility.

416
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:43,905
Ask the player what to do and not how to do something.

417
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:47,246
It's better if the player is playing his own way

418
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,968
and not exactly what we want him to do.

419
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:54,923
Define a clear toolbox for the mission designer.

420
00:23:55,264 --> 00:23:58,405
When we design quests, because we are currently doing

421
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:02,506
the tech in the same time we are doing the quest,

422
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:06,028
it was difficult to define what would be the tool.

423
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:08,268
But very early on in the production,

424
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,249
try to define what will be the tool

425
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:11,230
that the designer can use.

426
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:16,437
And the most important is forget the golden path.

427
00:24:17,137 --> 00:24:19,359
Because now in an open world game,

428
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,581
what we want is we want the player to create his own story.

429
00:24:23,682 --> 00:24:27,624
So we don't want to be sure that the player will do the thing

430
00:24:27,844 --> 00:24:28,885
the same way we expect.

431
00:24:28,905 --> 00:24:31,447
You have to let him to create his own experience,

432
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:33,908
and he will be very happy.

433
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:39,092
But the next step for future development in Ubisoft,

434
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,874
obviously, we continue on this way.

435
00:24:44,393 --> 00:24:47,315
because it's the future for systemic open world game

436
00:24:47,896 --> 00:24:49,357
while maintaining a good narrative.

437
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:53,179
We want also to improve the collaboration between team

438
00:24:53,219 --> 00:24:55,901
because it is very important to have good collaboration

439
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:57,742
between the tech and the designer

440
00:24:57,782 --> 00:25:02,466
to be sure that the tech will be well used by the designer.

441
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:12,590
And we also have to explore new ways to tell a story because we have something to do in

442
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:18,433
open world to tell a story to the player not in a linear approach but more in something

443
00:25:18,613 --> 00:25:19,113
systemic.

444
00:25:20,714 --> 00:25:21,034
Thank you.

445
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:35,740
You have questions go ahead and go to the mic we have about four minutes.

446
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:41,031
Nope.

447
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:41,151
Great.

448
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:43,551
But it's really easy.

449
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:45,252
The AI network that you described,

450
00:25:45,272 --> 00:25:45,912
is that just a trigger for those?

451
00:25:45,932 --> 00:25:50,393
Or do you see something like when you were describing

452
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:53,874
you have an ambush point, and you

453
00:25:53,894 --> 00:25:55,534
have a trigger for the ambush.

454
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,095
Did you just pretty much just populate the world with those,

455
00:25:59,115 --> 00:26:01,595
so that those would happen before everything?

456
00:26:01,615 --> 00:26:02,975
Because if the target would travel forward,

457
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,456
that ambush would be triggered.

458
00:26:11,227 --> 00:26:15,247
Yeah, in fact, the goal of the network

459
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:18,168
is to create opportunity to make situation happens.

460
00:26:18,188 --> 00:26:19,668
So we have the trigger zone,

461
00:26:19,748 --> 00:26:22,789
and because the NPC are linked to the trigger zone,

462
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:25,769
it's something that the designer created.

463
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,770
You want to be credible to have NPC item

464
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,131
close to the point.

465
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:36,072
Something that the designer push in the world.

466
00:26:52,897 --> 00:26:53,077
Yeah.

467
00:26:53,797 --> 00:26:57,238
If you want more information about all the virtualization

468
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,478
systems, I have another talk about the Meta-AI

469
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:02,199
in Assassin's Creed Origins.

470
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:05,680
It will be done by a colleague of me.

471
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,540
I think it's Wednesday.

472
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,781
It's Meta-AI, it's a virtual, fine,

473
00:27:10,821 --> 00:27:13,741
Meta-AI in Assassin's Creed Origins this week,

474
00:27:15,162 --> 00:27:15,622
on Wednesday.

475
00:27:15,822 --> 00:27:18,362
If you get more information about all the virtualization

476
00:27:18,402 --> 00:27:21,003
system and how we continue to update

477
00:27:21,063 --> 00:27:22,703
NPC very far from the player.

478
00:27:29,292 --> 00:27:30,793
Yeah.

479
00:27:30,813 --> 00:27:31,593
I have a question.

480
00:27:31,673 --> 00:27:32,593
One of the examples you showed

481
00:27:32,613 --> 00:27:33,873
of both in between the settlements,

482
00:27:34,213 --> 00:27:36,774
I was wondering to what extent do these systems

483
00:27:36,794 --> 00:27:38,574
involve civilian backgrounds

484
00:27:39,255 --> 00:27:41,595
and then it moves to the sediments as well

485
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:45,876
or do they always spawn before any player scenario?

486
00:27:48,697 --> 00:27:53,358
It's a specific NPC that wait for the player to talk with him.

487
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:55,278
Hmm, yeah.

488
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:20,522
The quest keeper in the boat that you mentioned before,

489
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:21,262
you're gonna die.

490
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,262
Did that really occur in a way that

491
00:28:22,282 --> 00:28:22,982
I understood it in the last time?

492
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:23,103
Sorry?

493
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:24,123
The quest keeper that was in the boat,

494
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:24,723
if that quest keeper dies,

495
00:28:24,743 --> 00:28:26,164
how does the quest actually become delivered

496
00:28:26,184 --> 00:28:26,564
in that example?

497
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:27,644
We can make the NPC invisible,

498
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,304
it can be one of the solution,

499
00:28:28,324 --> 00:28:28,865
but to trigger the quest,

500
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:30,485
the player have to sit on the boat.

501
00:28:30,505 --> 00:28:30,685
So that's.

502
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:32,181
Yeah.

503
00:28:57,792 --> 00:29:00,573
But what we try to create is generic behavior,

504
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:05,995
and this generic behavior will answer all the,

505
00:29:06,575 --> 00:29:08,016
from you, we have,

506
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:09,577
bring an answer to all the stimuli

507
00:29:09,597 --> 00:29:10,677
that the NPC can get inside the situation.

508
00:29:10,697 --> 00:29:10,757
But.

509
00:29:10,777 --> 00:29:11,017
But.

510
00:29:11,037 --> 00:29:11,097
But.

511
00:29:11,277 --> 00:29:11,437
But.

512
00:29:11,477 --> 00:29:11,577
But.

513
00:29:11,597 --> 00:29:11,658
But.

514
00:29:11,678 --> 00:29:11,758
But.

515
00:29:11,778 --> 00:29:11,858
But.

516
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:11,938
But.

517
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:12,078
But.

518
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:12,198
But.

519
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:12,278
But.

520
00:29:13,538 --> 00:29:13,678
But.

521
00:29:13,698 --> 00:29:22,242
But.

522
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:22,362
But.

523
00:29:22,382 --> 00:29:22,442
But.

524
00:29:26,553 --> 00:29:30,016
OK, for example, designers sometimes

525
00:29:30,056 --> 00:29:31,898
want to override the reaction.

526
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:35,681
It's something you can allow if it's

527
00:29:35,961 --> 00:29:37,563
credible with the rest of the world.

528
00:29:38,604 --> 00:29:40,645
If, for example, you ask this NPC should

529
00:29:40,665 --> 00:29:42,427
have different reaction regarding the player

530
00:29:42,487 --> 00:29:43,848
because it's in a role.

531
00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:48,220
or it's coherent, we have the possibility.

532
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,763
But every time we have to ask the question about

533
00:29:51,543 --> 00:29:54,807
what do we need to this override?

534
00:29:55,368 --> 00:29:58,191
Because we want to keep coherence in the world

535
00:29:58,251 --> 00:30:00,974
and we don't want to have too specific stuff.

536
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:06,020
All right, thanks a lot.

537
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:09,212
We are out of time. We need to move on.

538
00:30:09,472 --> 00:30:15,277
If there were a couple more questions, you can accost Jean-Marie off the stage here or out in the hall would be better.

539
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:19,720
So let's appreciate Jean-Marie for putting this together for us.

540
00:30:21,162 --> 00:30:21,782
Good material.
