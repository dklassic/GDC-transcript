1
00:00:02,416 --> 00:00:10,058
So, the story of user research on Destiny is really a microcosm of the story of the development of Destiny as a whole.

2
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:14,199
And so, just so you can't really talk about Destiny without talking about Halo,

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,260
you really can't talk about user research on Destiny without also talking about user research on Halo.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,681
So, for ten years, Bungie made this game called Halo.

5
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:26,372
and therefore that's what we did our research on.

6
00:00:26,952 --> 00:00:28,533
And we got pretty good at it.

7
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:30,054
We made five games in that series.

8
00:00:30,674 --> 00:00:32,835
And we pretty much thought we had this job down,

9
00:00:32,895 --> 00:00:34,755
that we knew by the time we got to the fifth one,

10
00:00:34,795 --> 00:00:36,836
we knew exactly how to test the Halo campaign.

11
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:40,178
We knew how to test competitive multiplayer.

12
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:42,198
We thought we were pretty good at this.

13
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:47,000
Unfortunately, it turns out that.

14
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:51,498
the move to Destiny sort of upped the difficulty quite a bit.

15
00:00:52,098 --> 00:00:54,079
That there were a lot of built-in assumptions

16
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,800
into how we tested Halo,

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,882
into the Halo game that made user research easier for us.

18
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:02,444
Simple things like the fact that each game mode

19
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,544
was a distinct experience,

20
00:01:03,644 --> 00:01:07,906
that you could test the story mode by itself

21
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:09,387
as an isolated experience

22
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,388
and not have people mixing and matching

23
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:12,329
in between activities.

24
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,270
The fact that all the missions were always played in the same order.

25
00:01:15,997 --> 00:01:19,197
It turns out to have been a great luxury that we didn't know we had at the time.

26
00:01:20,598 --> 00:01:25,079
Suddenly, we had to make every mission not only fun, but also the right difficulty level,

27
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:28,620
no matter when people got to it and what state they were in when they got to it.

28
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:33,181
The missions were more or less independent experiences.

29
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:39,791
For example, it's very common in game development that Mission 5 isn't working this week, and therefore, that's fine.

30
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:44,635
We have people play up to Mission 4, we have them read a little paragraph of what happened in the story in Mission 5,

31
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:48,018
and then we have them proceed on, skip through Mission 6 and let them proceed.

32
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:50,740
And that works pretty realistically.

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,584
In Destiny, suddenly, if you have to skip Mission 5, you haven't gotten any of the experience points.

34
00:01:56,185 --> 00:02:24,957
from that mission. Your character is now under-leveled from mission 6. You don't have any of the gear or the talents that you needed to beat that mission. And suddenly, the entire rest of your testing experience is out of whack because that one piece wasn't there. And Destiny was this very integrated game where all the pieces had to function in order to get good data. A couple of our issues were also sort of metaphysical. On the Halo games, certainly by the time we got to the final ones, we very much knew what kind of game we were making. We knew that

35
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:28,514
what the modes were going to be, we generally knew what the general mechanics were going to be.

36
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:33,279
A lot of the big, sort of, hard decisions about game design were already made.

37
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,983
In Destiny, we were discovering a lot of that, and a lot of that was changing over the course of development.

38
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:42,128
And finally, we knew what kind of players we wanted to play the game.

39
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:46,692
I mean, the kind of people we wanted to play Halo Reach were pretty much the same kind of people who played Halo 3.

40
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:49,095
That that was a well-understood audience, that we really had...

41
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,571
had been in touch with for years, they'd played our games,

42
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:54,632
we had data on exactly how they played our games,

43
00:02:55,312 --> 00:02:58,233
and we had this sort of very good understanding.

44
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:00,433
Suddenly with Destiny, we had RPG elements.

45
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:02,694
Okay, should we be recruiting RPG players?

46
00:03:02,854 --> 00:03:03,574
Are we aiming for that?

47
00:03:04,214 --> 00:03:05,314
Are we aiming for MMO players?

48
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:06,934
Are we aiming for people who play both?

49
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,535
Are these action adventure gamers?

50
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:12,176
There was a whole bunch of just fundamental assumptions

51
00:03:12,196 --> 00:03:13,756
about our audience that were suddenly called into question.

52
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:17,338
At the same time, Destiny was just huge.

53
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,020
So we had four planets, all of which

54
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,840
were bigger than any of the Halo missions we'd ever done,

55
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,641
four enemy races, each as complex

56
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:26,323
as the Flood of the Covenant, three classes, hundreds

57
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:28,043
of weapons, story missions, strike missions,

58
00:03:28,784 --> 00:03:30,424
and finally we had patrol and raid,

59
00:03:30,484 --> 00:03:32,846
which were completely new experiences that really

60
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:35,527
had no analog in anything we'd ever made or tested before.

61
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:39,029
So this was pretty daunting.

62
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:44,510
At the same time, this is our first game

63
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,031
we were making outside of Microsoft.

64
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:49,955
So on previous titles, we'd had the benefit

65
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:52,577
of Microsoft's lovely user research infrastructure, which

66
00:03:52,637 --> 00:03:56,280
is very elaborate and very well planned out.

67
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,522
And so we had to do this all ourselves.

68
00:03:58,582 --> 00:04:00,223
And we were free of that infrastructure.

69
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:02,305
So we had to build our own tools at the same time

70
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:04,046
we were actually testing and building the game.

71
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:06,689
So building the lab is actually the easy part.

72
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:07,850
This is a picture of our lab.

73
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:10,316
It's pretty straightforward, pretty standard compared

74
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:11,136
to most of the industry.

75
00:04:12,096 --> 00:04:14,757
But the hard part actually is putting people in the lab,

76
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:16,558
is actually recruiting the participants.

77
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:19,399
And I'm going to geek out a little bit here.

78
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,060
Please bear with me.

79
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,941
So I know that talking about recruiting participants

80
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:27,683
is not the sexiest topic in the world, but it really is.

81
00:04:27,703 --> 00:04:30,084
OK, I have one enthusiast.

82
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:35,282
It really is what defines the limits of your user research

83
00:04:35,302 --> 00:04:37,804
program, because if your recruiting methods don't

84
00:04:37,884 --> 00:04:40,347
get you casual players, you can't run that kind of test.

85
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:43,069
If your recruiting methods take a few weeks

86
00:04:43,109 --> 00:04:44,891
to get to your participants, suddenly you

87
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:48,474
have to be testing on a very well-planned, long-term time

88
00:04:48,514 --> 00:04:48,795
scale.

89
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:53,659
And you can't do snap tests at short notice.

90
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:59,502
I'm going to talk a little bit about how we went about recruiting participants for Destiny

91
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:00,062
playtests.

92
00:05:01,102 --> 00:05:02,522
Bear with me, this actually is important.

93
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:08,364
So first off, we created a sign-up forum on our website to let people volunteer.

94
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:12,725
We've had over 350,000 people sign up to be playtesters.

95
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:18,746
And they all give us demographic data, their age, gender, where they live, a bunch of their

96
00:05:18,806 --> 00:05:19,886
attitudes towards games.

97
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:27,437
They tell us a lot about themselves, and we connect all that to their Halo gameplay data,

98
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:31,726
and now to their Destiny gameplay data, so we know who they were in their actual play

99
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:32,809
as well as who they said they were.

100
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,151
And this led us, when we wanted to run a study,

101
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:39,534
we could then pull exactly the profile participant we needed.

102
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:40,895
We could say, OK, we want people who've

103
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:42,897
beaten the campaign on Legendary.

104
00:05:43,318 --> 00:05:45,980
We want people who played less than an hour of multiplayer,

105
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,882
people who played more than 100 hours of multiplayer.

106
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:52,147
We could use this survey data to say exactly where they were,

107
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:55,290
all their demographics, and their gameplay data to know

108
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,811
how they played our games.

109
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:01,429
We pull that sample of people and then send them an online survey to schedule them.

110
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:02,330
So this is unusual.

111
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,175
Most recruiting agencies call up all their participants on the phone and screen them

112
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:11,661
that way, which tends to be a very manpower-intensive process and take a lot of time, and ends up

113
00:06:11,741 --> 00:06:15,546
costing something on the order of $200 a participant to recruit a participant this way.

114
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:23,949
Because we could send a survey that would screen them and schedule them and slot them into their time slots,

115
00:06:24,929 --> 00:06:28,911
we could basically schedule a study with very little work, maybe a couple of hours of work total by the researcher.

116
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:31,143
and on very short notice.

117
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,704
So anywhere from a week to three days.

118
00:06:34,504 --> 00:06:37,245
We did a couple of studies on two or one day notice.

119
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:40,266
We've never done a same day study

120
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:41,807
where we kicked off the scheduling in the morning

121
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:43,367
and had people show up in the evening.

122
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:45,468
The system certainly would support that.

123
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,249
But I don't want my designers thinking

124
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:48,729
they can drop things on me in the last minute.

125
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:50,570
Don't tell them.

126
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,390
I trust you guys.

127
00:06:53,256 --> 00:06:55,398
And one other geek note I'll mention on this,

128
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:59,001
not all survey tools handle quotas the same way.

129
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,983
So not all survey tools are necessarily

130
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:02,664
suitable for this kind of scheduling setup.

131
00:07:03,324 --> 00:07:04,726
So there's some fine technical details

132
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:06,587
in how they handle them that make them more or less suitable.

133
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,930
So we had all these systems.

134
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:12,362
working and they had them all connected together.

135
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:15,463
So we could have this one system that would let us pull participants that we wanted,

136
00:07:15,843 --> 00:07:19,365
schedule them, screen them out, and have them show up in the lab.

137
00:07:19,385 --> 00:07:21,146
And we had really good success with this.

138
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:26,089
We scheduled something like 1,400 participants over the course of four years for this game,

139
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:28,690
saving us on the order of $400,000

140
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:33,412
by doing all the scheduling in-house using an automated system.

141
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,775
Now, you may be right to be skeptical that...

142
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:41,288
our participants were probably a little biased,

143
00:07:41,348 --> 00:07:43,510
that these were people who signed up on a Bungie website

144
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,031
to test a Bungie game in a Bungie building.

145
00:07:45,571 --> 00:07:47,272
So yes, they were fans.

146
00:07:48,713 --> 00:07:50,634
But we dealt with that bias in a couple of different ways.

147
00:07:50,855 --> 00:07:53,656
First off, a lot of the questions we were asking them

148
00:07:53,737 --> 00:07:56,258
weren't the kind of questions that would be affected by bias.

149
00:07:56,298 --> 00:07:59,560
So if we asked them, do you like Destiny better than Call of Duty,

150
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:01,722
yes, their answers would be biased.

151
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:05,364
But if you asked them, do you like Mission 5 better than Mission 6?

152
00:08:06,578 --> 00:08:10,321
there's no reason to believe that their bias would affect one mission more than another.

153
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:11,582
So it sort of cancelled out.

154
00:08:12,643 --> 00:08:15,865
We also did some comparison studies where we actually did use outside recruiting agencies

155
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:19,188
and found that the internally recruited participants gave us essentially the same data.

156
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:22,591
Particularly directional data,

157
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:24,672
that if the internal people said a mission was too hard,

158
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,314
the external people said it was too hard, and so on.

159
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:30,997
And their rankings of what were their favorite missions and least favorite missions were all identical.

160
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,587
We also did some post-stratification work

161
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:38,150
to look at how our sample differed

162
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,170
from the real population.

163
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,733
So along the x-axis here are different player types,

164
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:45,535
and the y-axis is how common they were in our sample

165
00:08:45,615 --> 00:08:46,575
and the general population.

166
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:48,457
And as you can see, type 1 players

167
00:08:48,497 --> 00:08:49,838
were very common in our sample.

168
00:08:49,878 --> 00:08:52,539
Those are the online engaged players.

169
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,021
But because we knew how common they

170
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,203
were in the general population, we could weight their answers

171
00:08:57,943 --> 00:08:59,784
and give them the proper.

172
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,136
the proper impact on our ratings.

173
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,679
So the first thing we did with all this wonderful data

174
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,703
was to segment the Halo Reach player population,

175
00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:13,685
say how many types of Halo players there are.

176
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:15,727
And there's a bunch of different ways to do this.

177
00:09:15,947 --> 00:09:18,089
And the way we ended up settling on

178
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:19,990
was doing it by play habits, that we're

179
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,673
saying if you have a population of players,

180
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:26,195
are there subtypes of similar players

181
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:27,577
that play the game in the same way?

182
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:30,295
There's a bunch of different algorithms,

183
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:34,818
and we can segment them by things like demographics,

184
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:37,340
their ages, where they live, all that kind of things.

185
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,122
But what we ended up settling on and using mostly

186
00:09:40,282 --> 00:09:44,085
is how they played the game, what proportion of time

187
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,066
they spent in the different game modes in Halo.

188
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:49,006
So some people spend lots of time one mode,

189
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:50,247
some people spend more balanced.

190
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:52,127
But we could use that to basically give

191
00:09:52,147 --> 00:09:53,528
each player a behavioral fingerprint

192
00:09:53,868 --> 00:09:56,469
and then group players by having who had similar fingerprints

193
00:09:56,489 --> 00:10:01,291
to say there are a small set of specific subtypes of players.

194
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:04,853
And one thing I'll say about this process,

195
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:07,394
so in case you decide to do this yourself,

196
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:11,576
I'm not going to talk about the technical algorithms so much.

197
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,582
I found the process of segmenting the player base to be almost more interesting than the

198
00:10:16,622 --> 00:10:17,722
final answers themselves.

199
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:22,165
I mean, it's very satisfying to say there are five types of players and here are the

200
00:10:22,245 --> 00:10:25,207
mathematically the best five clusters of players.

201
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:27,288
But when you're, uh...

202
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:30,950
doing the analysis, you're trying a lot of different types.

203
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,552
You're saying, well what happens if I factor in age

204
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:34,393
or take out age?

205
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:37,575
What happens if I split up story mode

206
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:40,837
from just one bucket into two buckets?

207
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:41,698
Oh, sorry.

208
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:44,440
Into two buckets by difficulty level.

209
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:49,497
And the answers you get change as you change the question.

210
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:52,639
And how those answers change are almost more interesting

211
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,621
than the final answer themselves and tell you

212
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:56,382
a lot about the texture of your player base

213
00:10:56,482 --> 00:10:59,604
in a way that just the there are only five players answer

214
00:10:59,724 --> 00:11:00,284
doesn't tell you.

215
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:04,527
So one model might say, OK, there

216
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:05,448
are three types of players.

217
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:07,389
There's red, blue, and green players.

218
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:12,865
Let's say we add in a new factor into the clustering algorithm

219
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:15,327
to chew on, and suddenly that green population

220
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:16,868
splits into two subpopulations.

221
00:11:16,988 --> 00:11:19,109
And now the algorithm says the best fit

222
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:20,891
is having four types of players.

223
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:23,072
The really interesting thing here isn't,

224
00:11:23,532 --> 00:11:25,114
are there three kinds of players or four?

225
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:27,395
It's, why did that happen?

226
00:11:27,675 --> 00:11:29,377
Why did that factor make that difference?

227
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:31,818
And why did those players group together or split apart?

228
00:11:32,717 --> 00:11:36,500
And all those kinds of little texture moments to your data,

229
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,423
I found really important and interesting.

230
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:43,766
And I'll stop teasing you and talk about the actual type

231
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,127
we found.

232
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:46,729
So we found there were, depending

233
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:49,331
on how you counted, either 5, 10, or 3 types of players.

234
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:51,834
So there were three overarching categories,

235
00:11:51,854 --> 00:11:53,195
that there were campaigners, there

236
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,317
were people who played Halo primarily for the campaign,

237
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:57,258
then played multiplayer for a little bit and dribbled off.

238
00:11:58,347 --> 00:12:01,527
There were omnivores who played in a very balanced way,

239
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,748
spreading their time across multiple game modes.

240
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:05,468
And there were specialists.

241
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:07,668
There were people who loved one game mode

242
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,569
and just played it for like 90% of their playtime.

243
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:14,490
Some examples might be capture the flag specialists,

244
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,750
or people who played only custom games with friends.

245
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:20,091
And each individual subtype of specialist

246
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:23,152
was very rare, only a percentage or two of the population.

247
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:24,932
But taken together as a group, they

248
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:26,572
made up a substantial minority.

249
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:30,253
And so as we were analyzing this data and thinking about it

250
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:35,394
and incorporating it into our plan for Destiny,

251
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:37,554
the idea of the omnivores really struck home,

252
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:38,695
the idea that there were players who

253
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:40,415
were playing in this balanced way,

254
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:43,075
spreading their time across multiple game modes.

255
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:48,716
And it had always been the idea for Destiny

256
00:12:48,756 --> 00:12:50,477
that there would be a variety of activities,

257
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:53,597
that one of the essential design pillars

258
00:12:53,677 --> 00:12:56,358
was an activity for every mood, that we would have intense.

259
00:12:57,188 --> 00:13:01,930
competitive activities, and very calm activities, story missions that you were guaranteed to

260
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:06,552
win if you spent enough time, and raids that were intended to be deliberately very hard.

261
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:12,254
But once we had the idea of the Omnivore, we started thinking that

262
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:16,590
We really want to encourage people to play not just the right activity for their mood,

263
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:19,933
but also to play a variety of activities and to not specialize too much.

264
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:23,877
This was connected in our heads to the idea of the buffet effect from psychology.

265
00:13:24,357 --> 00:13:28,641
The idea that if you have one flavor of food, like a giant bowl of white rice,

266
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:34,946
you'll feel full and you'll get sick of it sooner than if you have five flavors or ten flavors out in front of you.

267
00:13:34,986 --> 00:13:37,448
That's why when you go to a buffet you always end up eating too much.

268
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:43,053
because it takes longer to get bored of having so many different flavors and so many different tastes.

269
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:48,738
And talking about in terms of food, it feels a little negative and has some bad associations,

270
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:51,560
but if you think about it in terms of things like CrossFit,

271
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,123
where you go to the gym and there's a workout of the day up on the board,

272
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,226
and it's randomly determined and you won't get bored.

273
00:13:58,266 --> 00:14:00,868
It's not like you're, okay, I'm going to the gym and I'm going to swim laps,

274
00:14:00,969 --> 00:14:03,651
and I know I'm going to swim laps until my eyes bleed.

275
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:06,266
there's something different every time,

276
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,307
and you never get used to the routine.

277
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,829
And it makes for a more robust athlete.

278
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,010
And other games have done this sort of thing before.

279
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,351
They've deliberately set out to encourage omnivores.

280
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:21,052
So if you play Hearthstone, which I do too much,

281
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:25,194
they have their daily quest where they say,

282
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:27,695
OK, we're going to give you extra gold if you play this class

283
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:28,755
you don't normally play.

284
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,276
And so maybe you never play a priest deck,

285
00:14:31,376 --> 00:14:33,197
but you have a daily quest for it, and OK, yeah,

286
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:33,877
I'll go look it up.

287
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:36,615
I'll go look up a priest deck and give it a shot.

288
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:40,018
And that way, if your other deck that you normally play

289
00:14:40,058 --> 00:14:42,460
stops working, well, you had that priest deck

290
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,260
you played yesterday.

291
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:44,681
Maybe I'll play that instead.

292
00:14:45,914 --> 00:14:48,716
that being a broader player, a more robust,

293
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:50,678
a more omnivorous player, actually

294
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:51,879
makes you a more robust player.

295
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,701
If you only play one game mode, in some ways

296
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:55,522
you're very fragile.

297
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,523
If that game mode stops working for you,

298
00:14:57,543 --> 00:14:58,984
if it stops having rewards for you,

299
00:14:59,425 --> 00:15:02,227
if it stops being possible for you,

300
00:15:02,307 --> 00:15:05,429
if you only play cooperatively with your friend online

301
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:08,892
and your friend stops playing, you probably stop playing too.

302
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:10,833
But if that cooperative play is just

303
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:15,016
one segment of a wider array of activities you engage in.

304
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:19,160
you'll probably be more likely to keep playing even

305
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,862
after one segment of that stops working for you.

306
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:25,144
And therefore, if the decision was really

307
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:28,627
made to slope the floor towards helping all players play

308
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:31,870
like omnivores, and please note my phrasing on this,

309
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,111
we are not requiring players to be omnivores.

310
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:35,512
We are not forcing them to be omnivores.

311
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:37,594
We're just always making it a little bit easier

312
00:15:37,614 --> 00:15:41,877
to play that way than to play as a focused specialist player.

313
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:44,780
And we're going to give little nudges to you to go play

314
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,180
as a.

315
00:15:46,132 --> 00:15:47,393
to play in a more balanced way.

316
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:50,235
So for example, even if you're playing a warlock in Destiny,

317
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:52,436
we'll drop gear for other classes

318
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:54,658
to just give you a little nudge towards trying

319
00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:55,358
another character.

320
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,680
So it's like, oh, I don't normally play a titan,

321
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,081
but hey, I got this really cool helmet.

322
00:15:59,381 --> 00:16:00,122
Yeah, I'll give it a shot.

323
00:16:01,262 --> 00:16:02,964
And we'll just encourage you to be playing

324
00:16:02,984 --> 00:16:04,024
in a more balanced way.

325
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,427
Probably the extreme example of this

326
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:10,829
is the exotic bounties, where we, for example,

327
00:16:10,849 --> 00:16:11,510
the thorn bounty.

328
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:16,003
where we require players to both do strikes and PvP to get this really good weapon.

329
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:21,169
I'm not the only person to blame for the Thorn Bounty, if you've had it and hate it,

330
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,913
but certainly this was one of the components that led to that idea.

331
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:29,597
So we did a lot of research on Destiny,

332
00:16:29,617 --> 00:16:31,178
and we knew we wanted to start really early.

333
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:34,079
So this chart shows the research studies

334
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:36,300
we did per month on a number of our different games,

335
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,082
starting from launch at the far right side of the graph

336
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:41,622
and going backwards in time to the left.

337
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:44,303
And so we really wanted to start early on Destiny.

338
00:16:44,824 --> 00:16:47,105
And we knew we wanted to get a lot.

339
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:49,706
We had these big open design questions,

340
00:16:50,146 --> 00:16:52,267
and we knew we wanted to get the game in the lab early

341
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:54,328
and do a lot of early impact.

342
00:16:55,835 --> 00:16:59,118
Unfortunately, there's some very real concerns about,

343
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:02,120
OK, you're testing the game four years before it comes out.

344
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,483
A leak is much worse than it's going to be later on.

345
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:08,725
Because we really didn't want the first information

346
00:17:08,765 --> 00:17:10,527
out there about Destiny to be coming out of our labs.

347
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:13,349
So we upped our security quite a bit.

348
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,731
This is Jerry, our head of security.

349
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,394
This picture was actually voted one

350
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,016
of the eight manliest pictures on the internet.

351
00:17:21,716 --> 00:17:22,797
And I fully agree.

352
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:26,397
But we upped our security quite a bit.

353
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:28,379
Our players go through metal detectors

354
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:29,979
to make sure they're not bringing any recording devices

355
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:30,460
into the lab.

356
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,800
We make them lock up their cell phones.

357
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:34,382
They are never left alone with the game.

358
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:41,306
And we do our testing platforms are very highly locked down

359
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:43,047
to make sure that no one could take a screenshot

360
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:44,567
and email it to themselves or anything.

361
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:50,232
Our security processes are probably overkill in a strictly

362
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:53,592
sort of practical sense, but they let the studio trust us

363
00:17:54,093 --> 00:17:56,553
to put the game in the lab probably something like six

364
00:17:56,593 --> 00:17:58,154
months earlier than they would have otherwise.

365
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:00,994
So we got six months more impact on the game

366
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:03,835
than we would have if we hadn't gone to such elaborate lengths

367
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:04,375
on security.

368
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:07,856
And one of the first things we found

369
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,717
was we were testing the game is that there

370
00:18:10,737 --> 00:18:11,777
was a split between.

371
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:15,458
testing the game as a whole and testing it in specific parts.

372
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,601
And this is connected in my mind to the idea of the Heisenberg principle, not the

373
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:21,742
breaking bad Heisenberg, the real Heisenberg.

374
00:18:22,683 --> 00:18:26,405
The idea that the more precisely you know the position of a particle, the less you

375
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:27,345
know about its velocity,

376
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,327
because measuring one interferes with the other.

377
00:18:30,908 --> 00:18:32,068
And we really found if we...

378
00:18:33,228 --> 00:18:36,109
we couldn't test both the game as a holistic unit

379
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:40,070
and any specific mission or part of the game at the same time.

380
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,011
Because if we wanted to test the game as a whole, we said,

381
00:18:43,051 --> 00:18:45,511
OK, just sit down, go ahead and play.

382
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,152
Well, we couldn't guarantee that enough people would play

383
00:18:48,172 --> 00:18:50,453
any part of the game to give us real statistical power

384
00:18:50,513 --> 00:18:51,313
to say anything about it.

385
00:18:51,953 --> 00:18:54,554
And even if they did, if half of them

386
00:18:54,614 --> 00:18:57,595
went straight to that mission by just skipping straight there,

387
00:18:58,773 --> 00:19:02,497
They're going to be underleveled and half of them go off and do something else for three hours and then come back.

388
00:19:02,698 --> 00:19:03,458
They're overleveled.

389
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:11,747
How do you combine that information to get a real mathematical picture of how hard that mission is or how fun that mission is

390
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:16,332
when players are coming at it from such a variety of angles?

391
00:19:17,795 --> 00:19:20,637
So we ended up basically testing every piece of content multiple times,

392
00:19:21,238 --> 00:19:22,359
and pretty much in parallel.

393
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:24,601
The idea that we would test it very specifically,

394
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:25,882
and under controlled conditions,

395
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:29,545
so we had the statistical power to make strong claims about it,

396
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:31,267
about its difficulty, and so on.

397
00:19:32,228 --> 00:19:35,891
And also test it as part of a larger, holistic, free-form test,

398
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:37,732
where people were allowed to progress naturally.

399
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:40,975
And so to give you an example of a free-form test...

400
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:42,824
the kind of results we got.

401
00:19:42,844 --> 00:19:46,006
So this is, each column here is a mission

402
00:19:46,526 --> 00:19:47,787
in our story mode.

403
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,789
And these are the Earth missions, Moon, Mars, Venus,

404
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:51,109
Mars.

405
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:55,291
The black lines represent the ideal level

406
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:57,112
for the characters going to that mission.

407
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:58,513
That's the level the enemies are.

408
00:19:59,093 --> 00:20:01,035
So, and the blue dots represent the level

409
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,076
the players were when they got to that mission

410
00:20:03,356 --> 00:20:04,296
in this particular play test.

411
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:07,075
And so as you can see, people start off on track,

412
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:08,697
missions one, two, three, pretty good.

413
00:20:08,877 --> 00:20:10,999
Then they're under-leveled for mission four, five,

414
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:12,801
start to catch up on moon.

415
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:13,942
They're under-leveled on Venus.

416
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:15,283
And then by the time they get to Mars,

417
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:16,284
they're very under-leveled.

418
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:19,467
And in particular, that particular

419
00:20:21,007 --> 00:20:24,728
level jump between Venus and Mars was a deliberate design decision.

420
00:20:25,328 --> 00:20:28,829
And the idea was that people would get there, they'd look at the Mars missions and see that

421
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:32,770
they were higher level than they were, and they'd say, okay, well I can either go straight

422
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:37,031
into those missions and have them be a little challenging, or I can go do something else for a while and come back.

423
00:20:37,091 --> 00:20:40,871
I'll go do a strike, I'll go do some PVP, and I'll come back and I'll be the appropriate level.

424
00:20:42,372 --> 00:20:44,952
And as it turns out, players didn't even see

425
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:48,033
this as a choice. They just plowed straight from one story mission to the other.

426
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:49,733
The way people can...

427
00:20:50,776 --> 00:20:52,657
and just said, oh, I guess the game gets really hard now.

428
00:20:54,617 --> 00:20:58,079
And the way people ended up consuming the story missions

429
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:00,460
almost reminds me of the way people watch television

430
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,360
series on Netflix.

431
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,981
The new series of House of Cards opened, I guess,

432
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:05,722
this weekend, right?

433
00:21:06,162 --> 00:21:07,562
And they drop all the episodes at once,

434
00:21:07,623 --> 00:21:09,703
and people just sit down, watch it all in a weekend,

435
00:21:09,743 --> 00:21:10,984
and just hate themselves afterwards.

436
00:21:11,764 --> 00:21:15,486
And that's pretty much what seems to happen with story missions, is people, even when

437
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:19,287
we say, there's other stuff to do, go, go try something else and come back, it'll still

438
00:21:19,307 --> 00:21:19,587
be here.

439
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:22,849
They still want to just plow through story mission after story mission.

440
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:26,390
And so we had to actually sort of correct our assumption and make it, Mars a little

441
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,392
more accessible than it actually ended up being, it was in this test.

442
00:21:31,052 --> 00:21:32,733
So this is an example of our freeform testing.

443
00:21:34,677 --> 00:21:35,518
the holistic testing.

444
00:21:35,638 --> 00:21:38,119
And then, for example, of precision testing,

445
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,482
this is a difficulty for each of the story missions in Destiny.

446
00:21:41,562 --> 00:21:44,383
So again, these are Earth, Moon, Venus, and Mars.

447
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:47,946
And each column is a mission, and the length of the bar

448
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:49,827
is how hard that mission was.

449
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:51,388
So if the bar is going up, it's too hard.

450
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:53,889
If the bar is going down, it's too easy.

451
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,231
And we did this kind of testing repeatedly

452
00:21:56,371 --> 00:21:58,352
over the course of development, because things

453
00:21:58,392 --> 00:21:59,453
would change all the time.

454
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:01,294
Even if nothing had changed in the mission itself,

455
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:05,740
There would be small changes to combatants, there would be changes to other mechanics.

456
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,622
If suddenly ammunition was dropping less frequently, a mission could get more difficult,

457
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:12,823
even if the mission designers hadn't changed anything.

458
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:17,305
So we did a lot of repeated testing to make sure that things were staying trued up all the way along.

459
00:22:18,006 --> 00:22:21,167
And by and large, we were pretty successful in hammering down the difficulty spikes,

460
00:22:21,847 --> 00:22:24,349
although there were still a few in the released game.

461
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:29,411
This is the Chamber of Night mission is one that stands out in my mind.

462
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,932
This is Telthor the Unborn. He's a cutie.

463
00:22:33,757 --> 00:22:35,259
And so this is the final mission on the moon.

464
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,623
And this is actually, this mission is actually an example of a design pattern that we used

465
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:43,686
a couple of different times that ended up being very difficult for a lot of players,

466
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:48,910
where we basically lock the player in a round room, there's limited cover, and there's multiple

467
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,153
waves of enemies you have to beat with finally a boss Telthor at the end.

468
00:22:53,134 --> 00:22:55,136
And if you die at any point in that process...

469
00:22:57,237 --> 00:22:59,499
you have to start over from the beginning of the encounter

470
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:00,660
and do all the waves again.

471
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,201
There's no save points in between waves.

472
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:05,344
And this really ended up being a hard skill check

473
00:23:05,424 --> 00:23:08,106
because there wasn't really a whole lot of options

474
00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:10,788
for players to handle this encounter differently.

475
00:23:11,168 --> 00:23:12,710
You couldn't, because you're locked in the room

476
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,831
with the enemies, you really couldn't hang back and snipe.

477
00:23:15,392 --> 00:23:17,974
You couldn't sort of kill a few and then run away and come

478
00:23:18,014 --> 00:23:18,254
back.

479
00:23:18,894 --> 00:23:20,296
It was you're in there with them,

480
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:21,957
and you're either good enough to survive or not.

481
00:23:23,158 --> 00:23:24,679
And this wasn't a huge blocker.

482
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:25,620
I mean, we didn't lose.

483
00:23:26,626 --> 00:23:30,447
a majority of players or anything, but we lost a few percentage points of players in

484
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:36,109
the campaign when they just weren't good enough at that moment to come to beat that encounter

485
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:39,010
and didn't even come back after they were higher level.

486
00:23:42,931 --> 00:23:47,373
So that's all I'm going to talk about is those two types of testing, the holistic and reductionist

487
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:47,733
testing.

488
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,751
I'm going to talk for the rest of this talk,

489
00:23:52,771 --> 00:23:54,132
I'm going to talk about some special topics

490
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:55,653
and some particularly interesting research

491
00:23:55,693 --> 00:23:56,633
findings about Destiny.

492
00:23:57,174 --> 00:24:00,096
But please make no mistake, this kind of testing

493
00:24:00,116 --> 00:24:02,758
that I'm showing here was the majority

494
00:24:02,778 --> 00:24:03,738
of what we did on Destiny.

495
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:06,540
It was very straightforward user research,

496
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,143
where it's can people progress through the game overall,

497
00:24:10,543 --> 00:24:12,004
and what does their progression curve look like,

498
00:24:12,444 --> 00:24:15,847
and is each piece of content working the way

499
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:16,767
we think it should be working.

500
00:24:18,733 --> 00:24:20,754
It's not, again, not particularly sexy,

501
00:24:20,774 --> 00:24:22,815
but was the vast majority of what we did.

502
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:26,357
So to go into some special topics,

503
00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:28,958
so Destiny is a class-based game.

504
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:31,960
And we really had an intent that players

505
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,481
would be able to recognize what class was coming at them

506
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:35,562
in PVP instantly.

507
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:38,503
That if something comes around the corner at you,

508
00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:40,985
if it's a warlock, you have to react very differently

509
00:24:41,025 --> 00:24:41,805
than if it's a titan.

510
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:45,707
So we really wanted players to be able to instantly recognize

511
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:46,087
what class.

512
00:24:46,107 --> 00:24:47,588
And there was a lot of work that went into that.

513
00:24:48,691 --> 00:24:51,754
on class silhouettes, class color schemes, and shapes.

514
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:56,538
And of course, once those assets are actually built,

515
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,679
they're very expensive to change.

516
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:59,481
So we wanted to test them early, back

517
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:02,223
when they're just concept art and they're very easy to change.

518
00:25:02,683 --> 00:25:05,006
So these are some examples of Destiny concept art

519
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:05,966
we put in front of players.

520
00:25:06,627 --> 00:25:08,068
And so if you look at concept A there,

521
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:10,530
essentially everybody said, yes, that's a hunter.

522
00:25:11,191 --> 00:25:11,932
They looked at that.

523
00:25:11,952 --> 00:25:15,014
They said, yep, earth tones, triangular silhouette, yep,

524
00:25:15,054 --> 00:25:15,475
that's a hunter.

525
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:19,502
But character B, a lot of players misidentified as a warlock.

526
00:25:19,722 --> 00:25:20,622
Something about the shape.

527
00:25:20,962 --> 00:25:22,403
That was intended as a hunter concept,

528
00:25:22,963 --> 00:25:26,324
but something about the color scheme and the clean outlines

529
00:25:26,764 --> 00:25:29,064
tended to signal warlock to players.

530
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:34,126
Likewise, character C here, players correctly,

531
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,926
everybody correctly identified as a titan.

532
00:25:36,746 --> 00:25:37,666
But character D.

533
00:25:38,552 --> 00:25:40,372
a lot of people misidentified it as a hunter.

534
00:25:40,492 --> 00:25:42,593
Again, because the color scheme is something

535
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:44,794
about the ragged cloth and the outline

536
00:25:45,514 --> 00:25:47,114
made people misidentify what class.

537
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:49,555
So we were able to give a lot of feedback early

538
00:25:49,575 --> 00:25:53,376
to help the artists tune their designs before they actually

539
00:25:53,396 --> 00:25:53,976
built anything.

540
00:25:56,337 --> 00:25:59,338
Another topic we did research on was class regret.

541
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:03,319
So like all RPGs, we asked players up front

542
00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:04,660
to choose what class they want to play.

543
00:26:06,446 --> 00:26:10,767
It's really stupid because we ask people to make that class choice at the moment where

544
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:12,067
they know the least about the game.

545
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:15,968
And we ask them to make a choice that's then going to affect the rest of their play for

546
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:17,068
the entire experience.

547
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:22,430
And we're pretty much setting them up for failure by asking them to do it that early,

548
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,030
but that's when you have to make the choice.

549
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:31,692
So early on we gave them class descriptions that were very lore-based, that talked about

550
00:26:31,732 --> 00:26:35,053
the theme of the class and the feel of the class and the fantasy of the class.

551
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,600
But a lot of players ended up regretting

552
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,861
what class they were playing by the time they were done.

553
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:44,381
Because that lore didn't tell them

554
00:26:44,421 --> 00:26:46,341
a lot about how the class would actually play in combat.

555
00:26:47,182 --> 00:26:48,682
So we ended up moving to much more

556
00:26:48,722 --> 00:26:50,582
gameplay-based descriptions, where

557
00:26:50,662 --> 00:26:53,963
we were talking about the class's super abilities that

558
00:26:53,983 --> 00:26:56,083
really defined how they would play in battle.

559
00:26:56,923 --> 00:26:58,063
And players were much happier with this.

560
00:26:58,103 --> 00:27:00,724
And by the end of the testing, we

561
00:27:00,784 --> 00:27:02,644
had something like 85% of players

562
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,365
saying they were very satisfied with their class

563
00:27:04,405 --> 00:27:05,105
by the end of development.

564
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:06,665
by the end of their play session.

565
00:27:09,126 --> 00:27:14,968
So another topic we did research on was player recognition.

566
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,509
So Destiny is what we call a shared world shooter.

567
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:24,271
And it's a game where you run into other players

568
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:25,151
no matter what you're doing.

569
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:27,992
There really is no offline, single-player experience.

570
00:27:28,072 --> 00:27:29,973
Even if you play a single-player story mission,

571
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:32,334
we're going to randomly matchmake you with people,

572
00:27:32,354 --> 00:27:33,894
and you'll just come around a rock,

573
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:34,935
and there'll be other players.

574
00:27:35,573 --> 00:27:37,734
And that's awesome, and that's part of the magic of Destiny.

575
00:27:38,235 --> 00:27:39,095
And I'm actually going to play you

576
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:42,156
a quick clip from one of our earliest play tests

577
00:27:42,176 --> 00:27:43,977
where that system was in action.

578
00:27:45,157 --> 00:27:47,038
There's no sound in this clip, so don't panic.

579
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:49,519
So these are two players playing through in our lab.

580
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,421
Player 11 there is a little tired from his adventures,

581
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:54,741
and he's going to have a seat on the rock in Cosmodrome

582
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:56,382
and look out over the vista.

583
00:27:58,263 --> 00:27:58,783
Yes, no.

584
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:00,724
Yes.

585
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:09,580
Let me try that again.

586
00:28:13,721 --> 00:28:18,983
So player 11 is going to have a seat and take a little rest.

587
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:21,184
And player 6 is just going to happen to run into him.

588
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:26,026
These players are not in a party together, they just happen to be playing the same mission

589
00:28:26,046 --> 00:28:26,626
at the same time.

590
00:29:08,365 --> 00:29:09,646
And they run off to have adventures together.

591
00:29:09,686 --> 00:29:11,267
So this is a great moment.

592
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:11,907
They can't talk.

593
00:29:11,987 --> 00:29:13,988
We have no, we don't turn on voice chat by default.

594
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:15,569
They're not match made.

595
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:16,309
They don't know each other.

596
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:19,691
We just put them together and they have this great sort of human moment of contact.

597
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:25,286
As it turned out, and I think pretty much every employee at Bungie can tell you the

598
00:29:25,326 --> 00:29:28,469
first moment when that system came online and we were testing an internal build and

599
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:31,192
you just happened to run into another employee, it's like, hey, cool.

600
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:34,475
You start following them around the environment because it's like, it works.

601
00:29:34,595 --> 00:29:35,076
It's working.

602
00:29:36,897 --> 00:29:38,998
But players were missing that moment in some of our testing,

603
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:41,058
because they didn't realize that what they were seeing

604
00:29:41,118 --> 00:29:41,878
was another player.

605
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:43,279
They couldn't tell the difference

606
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:44,779
between a player and an AI.

607
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,860
And this is actually a video showing an example of that.

608
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,700
So what you're going to hear the moderator asking him

609
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,641
as he plays is, are the players you're looking at human

610
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:53,501
or computer-controlled?

611
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:59,383
Computer-controlled or controlled by people?

612
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:04,444
Computer-controlled, because this slayer just

613
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,464
threw a grenade that.

614
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:08,706
I don't know yet.

615
00:30:08,746 --> 00:30:09,867
Hold on, just give me a little bit.

616
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:16,231
And let me make it clear.

617
00:30:16,251 --> 00:30:17,131
I'm not making fun of this guy.

618
00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:18,092
He is not stupid.

619
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,033
He's failing because we failed him.

620
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:21,854
We didn't show him, we didn't give him

621
00:30:21,874 --> 00:30:23,956
the information he needed to know that those were

622
00:30:23,976 --> 00:30:25,096
real people he was looking at.

623
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:27,978
And therefore, he didn't get that sort of magical moment

624
00:30:28,018 --> 00:30:28,999
of, hey, it's a real person.

625
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,720
I'm really interacting in a living world,

626
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,881
because he couldn't recognize that those were people.

627
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:35,923
So we ended up improving the nameplates.

628
00:30:37,165 --> 00:30:39,567
to make the players look, stand out a little bit

629
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,088
from the background.

630
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,689
So on the left is what you saw in that video,

631
00:30:41,749 --> 00:30:43,510
and on the right is what we finally ended up with.

632
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:45,632
To make them much more distinct from AI,

633
00:30:46,112 --> 00:30:49,194
and to make them clear that these were real players.

634
00:30:52,957 --> 00:30:53,418
Let's see.

635
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:56,220
So we could guarantee they had that sort of magic moment.

636
00:30:57,561 --> 00:30:59,802
Another topic we looked at was directional damage indicators.

637
00:30:59,903 --> 00:31:02,444
So these were sort of, this is sort of a.

638
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,294
This was almost a religious debate on the design team

639
00:31:06,594 --> 00:31:08,977
of how directional damage indicators should work.

640
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:10,759
And so in both these images, the player

641
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:12,601
is actually being shot from the same location.

642
00:31:13,202 --> 00:31:14,664
He's being shot from above and behind.

643
00:31:15,845 --> 00:31:17,928
And the top image is what we call

644
00:31:17,948 --> 00:31:20,571
an absolute directional damage indicator, where

645
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:22,273
we're showing a little arrow pointing behind,

646
00:31:22,353 --> 00:31:23,955
and we're showing a flash on the top of the screen.

647
00:31:24,948 --> 00:31:28,992
The bottom image was what we called a relative directional damage indicator

648
00:31:29,492 --> 00:31:32,195
that would sort of lead you towards the person who was shooting at you.

649
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:35,298
The idea was that you would turn towards that red flash and turn towards the arrow

650
00:31:35,598 --> 00:31:39,382
and we adjusted on the fly to aim you towards your opponent.

651
00:31:40,563 --> 00:31:43,807
And Destiny had a much faster time to kill than our previous titles.

652
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:48,731
So we really wanted people to be good at reading the directional damage and responding to it.

653
00:31:50,251 --> 00:31:52,032
So again, this is one of those cases where the system is

654
00:31:52,072 --> 00:31:53,833
expensive to build, and we didn't want to build it

655
00:31:53,853 --> 00:31:54,933
and then decide we were wrong.

656
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:57,855
So we built these mock-ups and asked players

657
00:31:57,895 --> 00:32:00,096
to click on a little picture of a character

658
00:32:00,676 --> 00:32:02,477
and tell us where he was being shot from.

659
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:05,979
So for the top image, here was the heat map

660
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:06,779
of where players clicked.

661
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:08,420
They clicked above the character and behind him.

662
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:11,502
But for the bottom image, pretty much everybody

663
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:12,702
misread that and said, no, no, I'm

664
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,443
being shot from the right.

665
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:18,765
So of course, we finally ended up going with the absolute

666
00:32:18,785 --> 00:32:19,786
damage indicators at the top.

667
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:22,728
This was almost a service we provided to the design team

668
00:32:23,288 --> 00:32:24,709
in just breaking the religious debate.

669
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,571
And sort of like, OK, everyone can't agree.

670
00:32:27,651 --> 00:32:28,392
Here, here's data.

671
00:32:29,132 --> 00:32:30,153
We can all move forward now.

672
00:32:32,495 --> 00:32:33,996
Destiny had a really complex UI.

673
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:36,958
So this was the first game where Bungie made extensive use

674
00:32:36,978 --> 00:32:39,300
of eye tracking on our games.

675
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:46,391
And mostly we primarily used it in the moment to tell what player is looking at during usability

676
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:48,291
studies. And so I want to show you an example of that.

677
00:32:50,492 --> 00:32:53,852
So I'll warn you in advance. So this character, this player is about to

678
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:56,853
accidentally delete a bunch of his gear while he thinks he's equipping it.

679
00:32:57,493 --> 00:33:00,554
If you've played Destiny, this is extremely painful to watch.

680
00:33:01,254 --> 00:33:01,694
I warned you.

681
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:22,042
I see some power, which might be helpful.

682
00:33:22,082 --> 00:33:26,022
You can see the material he's getting from dismantling his armor popping up in the upper right hand corner.

683
00:33:26,222 --> 00:33:29,143
Look at the green arrows.

684
00:33:29,203 --> 00:33:30,763
He already worked those in there.

685
00:33:30,783 --> 00:33:31,503
That was pretty impressive.

686
00:33:34,224 --> 00:33:34,904
Quick turnaround.

687
00:33:34,924 --> 00:33:37,744
I'm just going to try to load up.

688
00:33:41,985 --> 00:33:42,185
Okay.

689
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:46,029
And as you can see from the eye tracking,

690
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,190
his eyes don't even flick to that upper right-hand corner.

691
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,971
They don't even see the materials pop up,

692
00:33:49,991 --> 00:33:52,573
because that channel is just out of his field of view.

693
00:33:53,013 --> 00:33:55,115
And you can tell he is reading the tool tip.

694
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:58,977
That just saying, pressing button X dismantles the gear,

695
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,219
clearly isn't enough to prevent him from doing it.

696
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,363
And so we actually ended up adding a safety mechanism

697
00:34:06,403 --> 00:34:07,704
that you don't just have to tap a button

698
00:34:07,724 --> 00:34:08,684
to dismantle your gear in Destiny.

699
00:34:08,704 --> 00:34:10,086
You have to press and hold the button.

700
00:34:10,426 --> 00:34:11,807
And the more valuable the piece of gear,

701
00:34:11,847 --> 00:34:14,149
the longer you have to hold it to dismantle it.

702
00:34:14,529 --> 00:34:16,231
So if you have an exotic and you want to dismantle it,

703
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:19,974
it actually takes a long time to fully destroy it.

704
00:34:20,614 --> 00:34:22,396
And so just a personal anecdote on this,

705
00:34:22,716 --> 00:34:24,958
like the first time I got in the Legendary in an internal build,

706
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:25,898
I did this.

707
00:34:26,018 --> 00:34:28,240
I accidentally dismantled it because we

708
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,161
didn't have any safeguards.

709
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:30,802
And I was so angry.

710
00:34:30,842 --> 00:34:32,864
I was ready to go over and punch somebody on the UI team.

711
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,001
And at the same time, though, it struck me

712
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:38,963
that this meant the game was working,

713
00:34:39,403 --> 00:34:41,625
that that little pixel gun that I'd just gotten,

714
00:34:42,486 --> 00:34:44,128
I was so happy to have it, and I was so

715
00:34:44,188 --> 00:34:47,651
invested in that virtual gun that I was so angry that I

716
00:34:47,691 --> 00:34:48,652
wanted to go over and hit somebody.

717
00:34:49,052 --> 00:34:50,974
And so I had this great moment of, oh, we're screwing up,

718
00:34:50,994 --> 00:34:51,915
but oh, that worked.

719
00:34:55,939 --> 00:34:56,079
So.

720
00:34:57,117 --> 00:34:57,718
We changed a lot.

721
00:34:57,938 --> 00:35:01,821
So among the many changes from Halo to Destiny,

722
00:35:01,881 --> 00:35:03,943
one of the minor ones was that we couldn't pause the game.

723
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:05,704
Because Destiny is a shared world game,

724
00:35:05,784 --> 00:35:08,566
and we expect players to, it doesn't make sense

725
00:35:08,586 --> 00:35:09,987
to pause in multiplayer like that.

726
00:35:11,088 --> 00:35:14,050
And as it turns out, we used pausing

727
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,912
for a whole bunch of basic logistical things

728
00:35:16,132 --> 00:35:18,234
in our research testing, from simple things

729
00:35:18,294 --> 00:35:19,795
like being able to pause and go to the bathroom.

730
00:35:20,523 --> 00:35:21,963
or telling everyone, hey, pause your game.

731
00:35:22,024 --> 00:35:23,604
We have lunch for you outside.

732
00:35:24,345 --> 00:35:25,425
And so suddenly, we couldn't do that,

733
00:35:25,465 --> 00:35:26,525
because the game doesn't pause.

734
00:35:27,786 --> 00:35:29,387
But one of things we also used pausing for

735
00:35:29,647 --> 00:35:31,568
was giving feedback while people were playing.

736
00:35:31,808 --> 00:35:33,549
As they were playing along in a campaign mission,

737
00:35:33,709 --> 00:35:36,410
we'd pop up a little dialogue saying, how are you doing?

738
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,791
And they could say, I'm bored, I'm fine, I'm frustrated,

739
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:41,612
I'm lost, whatever, as they were playing.

740
00:35:41,632 --> 00:35:44,553
And then we'd pause the game behind that menu as it came up.

741
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,822
And of course in Destiny, if we'd done that, players would die.

742
00:35:49,742 --> 00:35:51,363
Because the game wouldn't pause behind the menu.

743
00:35:51,763 --> 00:35:55,105
So we had to find a way to give feedback while they were still playing.

744
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:02,348
So we added a contextual feedback system.

745
00:36:02,508 --> 00:36:05,970
So you basically press the touchpad and the face button and the data mining system would

746
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,611
log a moment of saying...

747
00:36:08,462 --> 00:36:09,283
I'm frustrated here.

748
00:36:09,463 --> 00:36:12,407
And we log it with all appropriate sort of XYZ coordinates.

749
00:36:12,948 --> 00:36:15,171
We log who you were playing and where you were playing,

750
00:36:15,191 --> 00:36:17,434
all that kind of stuff, so we can analyze it later.

751
00:36:18,655 --> 00:36:19,496
And most importantly...

752
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,610
connected to our video.

753
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:27,054
So we could plot out maps of where people said they were frustrated, where they were

754
00:36:27,074 --> 00:36:31,058
lost, and importantly, where they were having awesome moments.

755
00:36:31,758 --> 00:36:36,042
We think of user research a lot of times as finding the problems in the game, but the

756
00:36:36,082 --> 00:36:38,984
best moments in user research are when you find the awesome moments in the game and get

757
00:36:39,024 --> 00:36:43,368
to tell the design team, we need more of this, this is working, that statue is awesome, how

758
00:36:43,388 --> 00:36:45,290
do we make sure everyone sees it?

759
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,501
And so here's an example of an awesome moment of, OK,

760
00:36:49,521 --> 00:36:51,723
you catch your teammate being heroic right in front of you.

761
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:55,366
And you can say, yes, OK, how do we give people more chances

762
00:36:55,406 --> 00:36:57,028
to see that kind of thing?

763
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,634
We also imported our data into our world editor.

764
00:37:04,714 --> 00:37:09,098
So the environment artists and designers in Destiny

765
00:37:09,138 --> 00:37:11,840
work on a tool called Grognok, which is our world builder.

766
00:37:15,202 --> 00:37:17,324
A lot of times when we were making this incredibly rich

767
00:37:17,364 --> 00:37:21,047
data, but our designers had to come to us to get to the data.

768
00:37:21,087 --> 00:37:23,649
They had to come use sort of strange visualization tools

769
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:26,071
that are really only well understood by user researchers.

770
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:31,134
So we wanted to be a little more accessible.

771
00:37:31,795 --> 00:37:34,557
So we decided we were going to bring the data to them.

772
00:37:34,937 --> 00:37:38,380
And we imported into their world builder tool

773
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,122
so they could look at it in the same tool they use every day,

774
00:37:41,743 --> 00:37:43,464
the one that they use to make changes to the game.

775
00:37:44,646 --> 00:37:50,151
And for me, this actually represented sort of how I believe fused research should work,

776
00:37:50,691 --> 00:37:54,294
is that we brought the data to them, we made it accessible to them, and it's our responsibility

777
00:37:54,714 --> 00:37:57,717
to put it in a format they can read and a place where they can easily access it.

778
00:37:59,939 --> 00:38:02,801
We also streamed our playtest from the lab out into the studio.

779
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:03,602
Oh, yes.

780
00:38:03,762 --> 00:38:04,002
Yes.

781
00:38:04,102 --> 00:38:04,362
There we go.

782
00:38:05,343 --> 00:38:05,483
Yes.

783
00:38:05,503 --> 00:38:05,623
Yes.

784
00:38:07,545 --> 00:38:08,246
Yes.

785
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:08,366
Yes.

786
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:08,446
Yes.

787
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:08,526
Yes.

788
00:38:08,546 --> 00:38:08,606
Yes.

789
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:10,027
Yes.

790
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,551
We also streamed our playtests out into the studio

791
00:38:14,051 --> 00:38:15,672
so everyone who didn't come down to the lab,

792
00:38:15,692 --> 00:38:16,672
and we certainly wouldn't want them all

793
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,914
to come down to the lab at the same time,

794
00:38:19,014 --> 00:38:19,974
could watch from their desks.

795
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:22,996
And this is the first game where we include face cams

796
00:38:23,236 --> 00:38:25,057
in all the playtest video we recorded.

797
00:38:25,617 --> 00:38:26,958
And I think that was really helpful

798
00:38:26,998 --> 00:38:28,779
in really inhumanizing the data.

799
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:31,300
Because it's one thing to watch a player die,

800
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,461
respawn, and go and charge back into battle.

801
00:38:33,882 --> 00:38:37,042
It's another thing to watch him die, see him bang his head on the desk,

802
00:38:37,642 --> 00:38:38,863
respawn and go back into battle.

803
00:38:39,343 --> 00:38:41,883
And just that moment of seeing what the human reaction was

804
00:38:41,963 --> 00:38:43,924
to what's going on in the game, I think really helps.

805
00:38:44,984 --> 00:38:47,184
Even if it's hard to quantify mathematically.

806
00:38:50,405 --> 00:38:53,586
One of the challenges we had, one of the other challenges we had,

807
00:38:53,646 --> 00:38:57,227
I'm sorry to be skipping around here so much, but a lot to get through.

808
00:38:58,413 --> 00:39:01,656
One of the challenges we had in Destiny was how we were going to test the endgame.

809
00:39:01,676 --> 00:39:05,540
So Destiny had this raid experience, where it launched, the first people to beat it took

810
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,483
I believe over 10 hours to beat it, even the best teams in the world.

811
00:39:08,503 --> 00:39:14,809
And the problem is we had this endgame content that was designed for experts in a game that

812
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:18,933
didn't exist yet, and there were no Destiny experts to test the content.

813
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,172
So we end up breaking one of the cardinal rules of user

814
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:23,773
research, and we brought participants back

815
00:39:23,813 --> 00:39:27,616
multiple times, which pretty much doesn't happen very often.

816
00:39:27,636 --> 00:39:28,936
Most of the time, we bring in participants,

817
00:39:29,297 --> 00:39:32,279
we get their initial reactions to the game, and we thank them.

818
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:34,660
We give them their gratuity and let them go.

819
00:39:35,341 --> 00:39:36,622
But in this case, we were bringing back

820
00:39:36,682 --> 00:39:38,843
people who would, say, come in for a story playtest.

821
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:41,245
One weekend, we'd bring them back a few weeks later

822
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:42,886
to do a late game strike playtest,

823
00:39:43,286 --> 00:39:45,708
because we needed to have that expertise that they'd built up

824
00:39:45,748 --> 00:39:46,648
in the early experience.

825
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:51,508
We also tested our raid by importing an entire shooter clan.

826
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:56,593
This is the Gunslingers clan who graciously used their vacation days to fly out to the

827
00:39:56,613 --> 00:39:59,575
studio and play in our lab.

828
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:05,721
They were really good sports, playing a very hard and many places broken raid experience

829
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:06,242
early on.

830
00:40:07,283 --> 00:40:08,183
They didn't beat Atheon.

831
00:40:08,224 --> 00:40:11,707
They got them down to about 30 percent, I believe, which was pretty impressive for the

832
00:40:11,727 --> 00:40:14,009
first weekend and gave a lot of really valuable raid feedback.

833
00:40:16,015 --> 00:40:18,576
So now the game ships, we're collecting a lot of data

834
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,537
on how people actually play Destiny out in the wild.

835
00:40:21,017 --> 00:40:25,980
And by and large, that data has been incredibly rewarding

836
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,001
and very encouraging.

837
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:31,263
So this is actually a graph of overall hours spent in Destiny

838
00:40:32,303 --> 00:40:32,923
by game mode.

839
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,025
And people are generally playing in that sort of balanced way

840
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:36,645
we want them to.

841
00:40:36,785 --> 00:40:40,467
And actually, this mix has been pretty consistent since launch,

842
00:40:41,828 --> 00:40:45,150
about the same proportion of time spent in various activities.

843
00:40:46,201 --> 00:40:48,743
However, there have been occasions where players have

844
00:40:48,883 --> 00:40:51,125
wandered off the path that we thought they were going to take,

845
00:40:52,846 --> 00:40:55,167
probably the most famous being the loot cave.

846
00:40:56,949 --> 00:40:58,790
So you can sort of see in this picture.

847
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:01,832
Actually, just to check, how many people in this room

848
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:02,833
shot into the loot cave?

849
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:04,955
Yeah, that's what I figured.

850
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,877
So I'll do a quick explanation for those of you

851
00:41:07,897 --> 00:41:08,377
who weren't there.

852
00:41:10,102 --> 00:41:12,263
Where this player is aiming, there's a little tiny point,

853
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:14,463
there's a little tiny cave, and enemies would spawn out

854
00:41:14,483 --> 00:41:16,324
of that cave at a steady clip.

855
00:41:16,484 --> 00:41:18,324
Every few seconds, somebody would come out of the cave.

856
00:41:18,885 --> 00:41:19,765
And the players would shoot them.

857
00:41:19,825 --> 00:41:20,265
They'd die.

858
00:41:20,325 --> 00:41:21,465
They'd respawn and run out of the cave.

859
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:23,086
And they were very weak enemies that

860
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:24,226
didn't drop very good loot.

861
00:41:25,226 --> 00:41:28,527
But because players could stand at this great distance,

862
00:41:28,567 --> 00:41:31,148
as you see in this picture, and just ping

863
00:41:31,168 --> 00:41:32,308
into that cave for hours.

864
00:41:33,507 --> 00:41:34,948
Once they finally did run over there,

865
00:41:35,048 --> 00:41:37,010
even though there was a very low drop rate for loot,

866
00:41:37,591 --> 00:41:39,552
there would be this lovely hoard of treasure

867
00:41:39,693 --> 00:41:40,734
lying in the bottom of the cave.

868
00:41:42,455 --> 00:41:44,297
And players literally did this for hours.

869
00:41:44,517 --> 00:41:48,180
And the funny thing is we knew about this before launch.

870
00:41:48,241 --> 00:41:51,544
We knew that this was a potentially exploitable

871
00:41:51,584 --> 00:41:51,924
activity.

872
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:55,609
But we didn't care, because we said,

873
00:41:55,629 --> 00:41:58,270
well, the actual drop rate per minute spent

874
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,311
is not any different than anything else.

875
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,052
So you actually will get less loot doing this per hour

876
00:42:03,572 --> 00:42:04,552
than just playing the game.

877
00:42:07,433 --> 00:42:10,294
But the players weren't actually doing the math that way.

878
00:42:10,354 --> 00:42:12,294
They were doing the math of, they

879
00:42:12,314 --> 00:42:13,415
weren't doing the loot per hour.

880
00:42:13,455 --> 00:42:15,355
They were looking at loot per effort.

881
00:42:16,215 --> 00:42:20,937
And this was so low effort that it felt like infinite free loot

882
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:21,657
to them.

883
00:42:23,432 --> 00:42:28,279
And so, the interesting thing is this is actually pretty controversial in the player base itself,

884
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,928
that this was actually the time of the loot cave was the highest peak for player reporting

885
00:42:33,948 --> 00:42:35,871
in Destiny, of players reporting each other for cheating.

886
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,761
is a lot of players were reporting each other,

887
00:42:39,881 --> 00:42:41,322
people who didn't want to exploit the loot cave

888
00:42:41,342 --> 00:42:42,782
were reporting the people who were in the loot cave,

889
00:42:42,882 --> 00:42:43,783
who were shooting the loot cave.

890
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:45,123
And the people who,

891
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:46,664
and some people were even going so far

892
00:42:46,724 --> 00:42:48,024
as to go into the loot cave themselves

893
00:42:48,084 --> 00:42:49,205
and sit on the spawn point,

894
00:42:49,645 --> 00:42:51,706
which would prevent the enemies from spawning.

895
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:55,027
And so the people who wanted to shoot into the loot cave

896
00:42:55,047 --> 00:42:56,227
were then reporting those people

897
00:42:56,267 --> 00:42:56,807
for being,

898
00:42:58,128 --> 00:42:59,769
obstructing their chosen play style.

899
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:02,910
So this wasn't just a case where sort of,

900
00:43:03,476 --> 00:43:04,596
Bungie hated it and didn't fix it.

901
00:43:04,856 --> 00:43:06,717
There were a lot of players who didn't like this as well.

902
00:43:07,237 --> 00:43:08,397
But we did patch the loot cave.

903
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:09,857
There actually is a memorial in the cave

904
00:43:09,897 --> 00:43:10,757
if you haven't been back.

905
00:43:11,278 --> 00:43:13,498
There is a memorial that's worth visiting and looking at.

906
00:43:15,738 --> 00:43:18,519
And since then, we've also found a number of other loot caves.

907
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:21,980
So this is a top-down map of one of our destinations.

908
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,460
And those red spots over there on the right

909
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,381
are some minor loot caves that we discovered algorithmically

910
00:43:28,761 --> 00:43:30,922
before they got on YouTube or Reddit or whatever.

911
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,561
and we were able to patch them before they became popular.

912
00:43:36,441 --> 00:43:38,782
And so we're constantly doing this with, pretty much throughout the game,

913
00:43:38,822 --> 00:43:42,423
of looking for moments where players are beating things very quickly,

914
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,344
taking too long, taking too short,

915
00:43:44,384 --> 00:43:47,405
and looking for places where the experience isn't what we expected.

916
00:43:48,065 --> 00:43:50,066
So we can then investigate and find out what's going on.

917
00:43:50,506 --> 00:43:52,046
One of the great things about the modern age

918
00:43:52,267 --> 00:43:54,387
is that everything is on YouTube and Twitch,

919
00:43:54,887 --> 00:43:57,288
so if you can find some strange play style in the data,

920
00:43:57,688 --> 00:43:59,749
somebody out there has put it online for you to watch.

921
00:44:01,377 --> 00:44:03,158
That's a wonderful resource for you as researchers.

922
00:44:05,218 --> 00:44:07,739
So a couple of lessons I learned over the course of this.

923
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:09,039
And I'm going to say we here.

924
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,439
I'm not speaking for Bungie in this case, in this slide.

925
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:13,240
I'm speaking for myself and my research team.

926
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,240
Or, OK, mostly for myself.

927
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,421
I won't get my research team in trouble.

928
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:23,802
So I absolutely underestimated our blessings on Halo.

929
00:44:24,062 --> 00:44:27,743
That we didn't realize how good we had at the time.

930
00:44:29,273 --> 00:44:29,953
as I spoke earlier.

931
00:44:30,573 --> 00:44:32,234
We underestimated how rabid our fans would be.

932
00:44:32,274 --> 00:44:33,734
So one of the first questions I got

933
00:44:33,855 --> 00:44:35,575
was when I started at Bungie was,

934
00:44:35,975 --> 00:44:37,576
so how much are people going to play the game?

935
00:44:38,396 --> 00:44:40,397
And they wanted to say, OK, we want

936
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:43,198
to drop a certain amount of loot per week.

937
00:44:43,658 --> 00:44:45,278
So how many hours per week are people going to play

938
00:44:45,298 --> 00:44:46,859
so we can adjust drop rates to get people

939
00:44:46,919 --> 00:44:47,859
about the right experience?

940
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,141
And I based it on Halo and underestimated by about 50%.

941
00:44:56,446 --> 00:45:01,568
Our fans on Destiny are just way more enthusiastic than I think anybody anticipated they would be.

942
00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:07,891
We really didn't correctly manage the transition to the Elder Games.

943
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:12,152
So Destiny has an early game where you're leveling up through experience points,

944
00:45:12,172 --> 00:45:14,153
you're leveling up your character, then you get to level 20,

945
00:45:14,233 --> 00:45:15,594
and you start leveling up through your gear.

946
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:19,035
And a lot of people missed that transition.

947
00:45:19,055 --> 00:45:21,276
That's not intuitive for a lot of shooter players.

948
00:45:23,879 --> 00:45:25,420
And when I say a lot of people, I mean something like 4%

949
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,222
of players got stuck at level 20.

950
00:45:27,862 --> 00:45:30,384
They just never quite made that jump to the elder game

951
00:45:30,444 --> 00:45:31,125
progression system.

952
00:45:33,247 --> 00:45:34,628
We knew that there might be a problem there,

953
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,349
and we did some work on it, but we never fully

954
00:45:36,389 --> 00:45:37,550
smoothed it out before release.

955
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:43,355
And I think probably the biggest screw up,

956
00:45:44,436 --> 00:45:45,897
I thought players would hate power in PvP.

957
00:45:46,758 --> 00:45:50,220
that every playtest we did on PvP and Destiny in the lab,

958
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,881
players hated the concept of level in PvP.

959
00:45:54,542 --> 00:45:55,602
That the idea that they would get

960
00:45:55,662 --> 00:45:57,723
killed by someone who was higher level than them,

961
00:45:57,763 --> 00:45:59,844
and they would get really angry that they

962
00:45:59,864 --> 00:46:01,144
were in this unfair match.

963
00:46:02,265 --> 00:46:04,165
And they wouldn't even get angry at the other player.

964
00:46:04,185 --> 00:46:05,146
They would get angry at us.

965
00:46:05,786 --> 00:46:07,127
They would say, screw you, Bungie.

966
00:46:07,367 --> 00:46:08,987
You put me in a game with that guy.

967
00:46:09,988 --> 00:46:11,648
Your matchmaking system failed me

968
00:46:11,988 --> 00:46:13,649
and put me in a situation where I couldn't win.

969
00:46:14,209 --> 00:46:15,890
And they got really upset with us.

970
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:19,279
Even in a playtest where the power didn't matter,

971
00:46:19,299 --> 00:46:22,120
and again, at all for stats,

972
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,061
but just we had the numbers over your head,

973
00:46:24,441 --> 00:46:26,242
players got angry about power in PvP.

974
00:46:26,502 --> 00:46:28,903
It was just a concept that players hated in the lab.

975
00:46:29,863 --> 00:46:31,203
So of course, in our first Iron Banner,

976
00:46:31,243 --> 00:46:36,285
we started out with a very minor, minor effect of power in PvP,

977
00:46:36,365 --> 00:46:37,826
saying, okay, we're gonna let it matter a little bit

978
00:46:37,906 --> 00:46:38,666
and see what happens.

979
00:46:40,347 --> 00:46:41,527
And thinking players would hate it,

980
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:43,768
and actually the overwhelming response was

981
00:46:45,691 --> 00:46:46,411
this should be worse.

982
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:50,373
I mean, a level 30 should totally destroy me in PvP.

983
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:52,694
And this was just startling to us.

984
00:46:52,734 --> 00:46:55,595
And there was something funny happened in that transition

985
00:46:55,715 --> 00:46:58,316
from the character I was, the throwaway character they

986
00:46:58,336 --> 00:47:01,217
were playing in the lab, and the real character and gear

987
00:47:01,237 --> 00:47:02,358
they'd earned out in the real world.

988
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,178
That once it was their real gear,

989
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:07,220
that they'd leveled their character up to 30 personally,

990
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,781
and they'd sweated blood to earn those guns.

991
00:47:11,137 --> 00:47:12,477
they wanted those guns to matter.

992
00:47:13,057 --> 00:47:17,919
So in subsequent versions, we've increased the effective power

993
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:18,899
in the Iron Banner.

994
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:20,419
And people seem to be happy with it.

995
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:23,720
I think they're masochists, but they seem to be happy with it.

996
00:47:26,121 --> 00:47:28,482
So overall, in spite of the errors we made,

997
00:47:28,502 --> 00:47:29,902
the game's doing OK.

998
00:47:31,663 --> 00:47:34,043
Currently, we're at 17 million registered players,

999
00:47:37,044 --> 00:47:38,225
playing a little over a billion hours

1000
00:47:38,245 --> 00:47:40,265
total in the first six months since the game's come out.

1001
00:47:42,931 --> 00:47:44,772
They've killed 200 billion aliens amongst them,

1002
00:47:46,513 --> 00:47:48,995
and enough other guardians in PVP to depopulate the Earth.

1003
00:47:52,617 --> 00:47:55,398
The average total playtime per player is over 77 hours.

1004
00:47:56,839 --> 00:47:58,340
That includes trial players, by the way.

1005
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,601
If you look at just paying players,

1006
00:48:00,661 --> 00:48:02,642
it's actually, I think, something over 100 hours,

1007
00:48:04,223 --> 00:48:05,543
which is way more than we expected.

1008
00:48:06,404 --> 00:48:07,905
The average player who logs on today

1009
00:48:08,005 --> 00:48:09,386
will play for an average of three hours.

1010
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:14,232
Our estimates pre-launch were something like 30 to 90 minutes

1011
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:14,532
a day.

1012
00:48:15,632 --> 00:48:17,292
Three hours was not even on the scale.

1013
00:48:20,193 --> 00:48:23,173
And that's now, whatever, 175 days after launch.

1014
00:48:25,034 --> 00:48:28,675
And the average player has completed 230 activities so far.

1015
00:48:29,795 --> 00:48:32,795
So our user research effort certainly wasn't perfect,

1016
00:48:34,056 --> 00:48:35,876
but it seems to have contributed to something

1017
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,136
that our players really love.

1018
00:48:38,517 --> 00:48:40,957
Thank you all very much, and do you have any questions for me?

1019
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:56,833
questions, please come up to the mics. Thank you for the talk of course. I was wondering if you

1020
00:48:56,853 --> 00:49:01,134
can shed some insight into how you're assessing certain gameplay problems you're seeing when

1021
00:49:01,154 --> 00:49:06,496
you have incomplete UI because you're in production but you know the UI is actually critical

1022
00:49:06,556 --> 00:49:09,797
to people understanding the gameplay problem that people are experiencing.

1023
00:49:10,557 --> 00:49:12,978
and how often you take something to a certain level of user

1024
00:49:13,018 --> 00:49:15,200
testing so people can understand what you're trying to test.

1025
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,381
Often you're waiting until the UI is complete,

1026
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:18,762
but that happens at the end.

1027
00:49:19,382 --> 00:49:20,483
And what the strategies are.

1028
00:49:24,006 --> 00:49:24,586
Yes, it's hard.

1029
00:49:25,747 --> 00:49:26,007
Sorry.

1030
00:49:26,987 --> 00:49:28,788
Yes, it's very difficult to test early.

1031
00:49:29,988 --> 00:49:32,689
One of the great luxuries that we all had in Halo that I

1032
00:49:32,709 --> 00:49:34,909
actually didn't mention was the fact that the UI didn't

1033
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:36,170
change much from game to game.

1034
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,771
So for a lot of the Halo 3 development, we could just

1035
00:49:38,811 --> 00:49:40,311
leave the Halo 2 UI in place.

1036
00:49:41,892 --> 00:49:43,692
Because pretty much most of the mechanics were going to

1037
00:49:43,712 --> 00:49:44,112
be the same.

1038
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:48,690
for Destiny we had to build a lot of that UI before we could

1039
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:52,151
actually test the game. So a lot of our early testings were

1040
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:56,353
things that didn't need UI and where they needed to be UI we

1041
00:49:56,373 --> 00:49:59,474
would do paper prototypes or mock ups or things like that.

1042
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:04,335
But yes, it's really hard to do a game like this when the UI is

1043
00:50:04,395 --> 00:50:09,536
broken. Sorry, I forgot to repeat the question. Yes?

1044
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:11,677
Sorry, I'm going to go to the other side.

1045
00:50:12,417 --> 00:50:13,778
Big fan. Thank you for the game.

1046
00:50:14,662 --> 00:50:18,065
How do you guys went from the lab to actual crossing data

1047
00:50:18,105 --> 00:50:19,426
from players on the live game?

1048
00:50:19,846 --> 00:50:21,368
How did that process happen?

1049
00:50:22,549 --> 00:50:24,951
So the question was how we went from collecting data in the lab

1050
00:50:24,991 --> 00:50:26,112
to collecting data in the live game.

1051
00:50:26,673 --> 00:50:27,994
And a lot of it is the same.

1052
00:50:28,074 --> 00:50:31,277
So we have very rich data mining in the lab.

1053
00:50:31,757 --> 00:50:33,319
And we actually collect that exact same set

1054
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:35,761
of data mining for a very small slice of players

1055
00:50:35,821 --> 00:50:36,422
out in the real world.

1056
00:50:37,197 --> 00:50:40,439
And we collect a much less rich selection of data

1057
00:50:40,479 --> 00:50:41,699
for every player in the game.

1058
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,581
So pretty much anything you see in your BungieNet profile

1059
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:45,321
we have access to.

1060
00:50:45,381 --> 00:50:46,322
So we can look at gear.

1061
00:50:46,362 --> 00:50:47,302
We can look at activities.

1062
00:50:48,342 --> 00:50:50,263
There's a very rich data set.

1063
00:50:50,343 --> 00:50:53,265
We use a number of different technologies,

1064
00:50:53,805 --> 00:50:57,427
including Hadoop and high-based systems, too.

1065
00:50:57,447 --> 00:51:02,549
Can you please ask Zurg to stop selling the No Man's Land,

1066
00:51:02,669 --> 00:51:02,949
please?

1067
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:05,491
He doesn't answer to me.

1068
00:51:05,511 --> 00:51:06,251
All right.

1069
00:51:09,561 --> 00:51:09,761
Hi.

1070
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:10,141
Hi.

1071
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:11,862
I wanted to know a little bit more

1072
00:51:11,882 --> 00:51:13,502
about how you handled the long game.

1073
00:51:13,702 --> 00:51:15,883
You mentioned that you brought players back

1074
00:51:16,663 --> 00:51:18,184
from the earlier playtests.

1075
00:51:18,564 --> 00:51:20,585
But really, how often did you do that?

1076
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:24,366
Because one of my games, I base a lot of my playtests

1077
00:51:24,426 --> 00:51:25,786
on your work on Halo, right?

1078
00:51:27,067 --> 00:51:29,008
But a problem that I had, I had anticipated,

1079
00:51:29,048 --> 00:51:32,149
is how players' relationships with that same content

1080
00:51:32,229 --> 00:51:36,090
changed after they went to 10 hours, 20, 30, 60, 90 hours.

1081
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:38,071
So how did you guys learn about that?

1082
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:41,001
A lot of guessing.

1083
00:51:42,082 --> 00:51:43,844
So there was only so long we could

1084
00:51:43,864 --> 00:51:44,665
have people play in the lab.

1085
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,948
And we always had this dream that we would establish

1086
00:51:47,648 --> 00:51:49,430
fixed panels of players of like, OK, we're

1087
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:51,593
going to say these 100 players are the Saturday afternoon

1088
00:51:51,633 --> 00:51:51,893
panel.

1089
00:51:51,913 --> 00:51:53,775
They can come in every Saturday afternoon for months.

1090
00:51:54,556 --> 00:51:56,358
And they can get really deep into the content

1091
00:51:56,418 --> 00:51:57,259
and replay the content.

1092
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,702
And the game just was never quite.

1093
00:52:01,136 --> 00:52:02,937
And it just never actually made sense to do it.

1094
00:52:03,158 --> 00:52:05,039
Because by the time that they had gotten months

1095
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:07,621
into the content, the developers were months along

1096
00:52:07,661 --> 00:52:08,081
in production.

1097
00:52:08,141 --> 00:52:10,543
And therefore, any feedback they had on that months old build

1098
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:11,323
was just worthless.

1099
00:52:12,104 --> 00:52:14,886
And so we never quite settled down into being able to do that.

1100
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,006
I really wish we could have.

1101
00:52:16,207 --> 00:52:18,108
And so we are exploring some different ways

1102
00:52:18,188 --> 00:52:19,109
to handle that in the future.

1103
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:20,810
Thank you.

1104
00:52:24,134 --> 00:52:33,701
Oh, I was just wondering, have you formed any policies of using like Twits data as like a post-release user research?

1105
00:52:33,961 --> 00:52:35,583
I'm sorry, I can't even hear you.

1106
00:52:35,803 --> 00:52:45,390
Yeah, sorry. I had a question, if you have formed any strategies about using Twits and YouTube as like after-release user research?

1107
00:52:47,433 --> 00:52:51,354
So the question is how we're using Twitter and YouTube in post-release user research,

1108
00:52:51,754 --> 00:52:55,615
and mostly we're using it as evidence, that once we find interesting patterns in the data,

1109
00:52:56,715 --> 00:53:03,157
we're then going and finding evidence of them on YouTube, and finding videos to support

1110
00:53:03,177 --> 00:53:03,637
that position.

1111
00:53:03,717 --> 00:53:04,737
And we're also going vice versa.

1112
00:53:04,757 --> 00:53:08,419
We'll see somebody post a weird video on YouTube, and then we'll look in the data and say, okay,

1113
00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:10,519
how many people actually can do that?

1114
00:53:15,454 --> 00:53:18,935
Having played for 700 hours, I feel this is my destiny, anonymous bit.

1115
00:53:19,975 --> 00:53:23,576
What testing did you do into the RNG side that seems to get people so sort of

1116
00:53:23,656 --> 00:53:25,536
enervated about drop rates and stuff?

1117
00:53:25,697 --> 00:53:29,998
Were you surprised by how upset they got about not being able to find a particular thing they were looking for?

1118
00:53:31,078 --> 00:53:35,539
Upset? No. I mean, I certainly have a friend in WoW who ran the same dungeon

1119
00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:38,680
something like 300 times and never got his hat to drop.

1120
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,840
I mean, we were familiar with the problem.

1121
00:53:42,589 --> 00:53:46,513
I think the thing that most surprised us was how focused people were on the RNG aspect.

1122
00:53:47,153 --> 00:53:54,040
I mean, the basic intent was always that most of the loot would come from fairly regular

1123
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:58,084
sources through things like Vanguard marks, and then you buy the armor off the vendor.

1124
00:53:58,744 --> 00:54:02,828
And we expected that to be sort of the normal progression, and the random would be the sort

1125
00:54:02,848 --> 00:54:04,229
of very cool cream on top.

1126
00:54:05,418 --> 00:54:10,003
But that random just became so fixated in players' minds.

1127
00:54:10,183 --> 00:54:12,145
Even though it's a fairly small portion of the actual loot

1128
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:15,849
they get, it just dominates the imagination in a way

1129
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:16,930
I don't think we anticipated.

1130
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:19,392
Finally dropped, so we're good.

1131
00:54:19,672 --> 00:54:19,993
OK, cool.

1132
00:54:20,373 --> 00:54:21,194
Thank you.

1133
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:24,901
Thank you for the presentation. This is an RNG question as well.

1134
00:54:25,642 --> 00:54:28,705
I've been playing Destiny since September 9th, in like four hours every day at least.

1135
00:54:29,185 --> 00:54:33,088
So my question was, you spoke about reward and encouraging the players to play other characters.

1136
00:54:33,128 --> 00:54:36,831
Like for example, I'm a warlock and I get a Saint-14, so I want to try my hunter now.

1137
00:54:37,292 --> 00:54:40,354
So, I feel the game relies on RNG a lot.

1138
00:54:40,374 --> 00:54:44,618
Because you spoke about Vanguard, armor and all that, but the end game content is still the Yalahorn.

1139
00:54:44,638 --> 00:54:45,719
Why do I not have a Yalahorn yet?

1140
00:54:46,474 --> 00:54:49,117
I've been playing since a long time, and all my friends get it.

1141
00:54:49,157 --> 00:54:51,999
I, Sherpa, I Sword Bear, and still people get it, and I don't get it.

1142
00:54:52,339 --> 00:54:54,101
So the question is why he doesn't have a Yalahorn yet.

1143
00:54:58,179 --> 00:55:00,461
And the answer is somebody has to get that unlucky.

1144
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:03,363
I mean, it is a random number generator,

1145
00:55:03,483 --> 00:55:05,465
and somebody has to get that unlucky.

1146
00:55:05,865 --> 00:55:07,907
But the thing that always strikes me

1147
00:55:08,127 --> 00:55:09,749
is how many stories come out of that,

1148
00:55:10,229 --> 00:55:12,071
and how much dialogue comes out of that,

1149
00:55:12,211 --> 00:55:14,473
and how many stories people tell about how

1150
00:55:14,513 --> 00:55:15,614
they get their gun in the end.

1151
00:55:16,296 --> 00:55:18,698
And that difficulty and the challenge in getting it

1152
00:55:19,798 --> 00:55:22,380
creates war stories and creates a great sort of community

1153
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,240
feeling about the game.

1154
00:55:23,881 --> 00:55:26,342
So it does hurt when you personally

1155
00:55:26,383 --> 00:55:28,224
haven't gotten the gun you want.

1156
00:55:28,244 --> 00:55:31,846
I don't think I've ever gotten a random exotic weapon drop,

1157
00:55:32,266 --> 00:55:32,627
personally.

1158
00:55:32,827 --> 00:55:35,789
But I've bought all mine out of pity from Xur.

1159
00:55:36,109 --> 00:55:42,293
But it's one of those things that we expect everybody

1160
00:55:42,353 --> 00:55:43,414
to eventually get an exotic.

1161
00:55:43,474 --> 00:55:45,915
We don't expect everybody to eventually get all exotics.

1162
00:55:46,364 --> 00:55:48,305
But do you guys think you'll be working on this front

1163
00:55:48,366 --> 00:55:49,206
at any point in time?

1164
00:55:49,226 --> 00:55:51,448
Or are you just going to leave it at RNG at all points?

1165
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:54,910
In upcoming expansions, upcoming weapons, or whatever?

1166
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,452
So I'm not a designer, so I don't actually control this.

1167
00:55:57,732 --> 00:55:59,834
I suspect that RNG will always be a part of Destiny.

1168
00:56:00,314 --> 00:56:02,416
I think we will tune exactly how much of a part

1169
00:56:02,456 --> 00:56:06,478
it is as our understanding of the game improves over time.

1170
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:09,481
But I think there will always be a certain RNG factor.

1171
00:56:10,041 --> 00:56:11,262
Yeah, I guess.

1172
00:56:11,402 --> 00:56:11,622
Thanks.

1173
00:56:11,942 --> 00:56:12,102
Yeah.

1174
00:56:12,863 --> 00:56:12,923
OK.

1175
00:56:14,312 --> 00:56:15,033
Hey, how's it going?

1176
00:56:15,253 --> 00:56:16,133
Awesome presentation.

1177
00:56:16,654 --> 00:56:17,314
I have a question.

1178
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:20,536
So I work at a technology company,

1179
00:56:20,576 --> 00:56:22,658
and one of the things that we track pretty heavily

1180
00:56:22,738 --> 00:56:26,280
is user sentiment and how the new features that we implement

1181
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,422
change how people perceive the company that's

1182
00:56:29,542 --> 00:56:32,244
creating the product, which is kind of interesting.

1183
00:56:32,644 --> 00:56:38,468
And it often leads to really interesting unexpected things,

1184
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:40,189
either greatly improving or a.

1185
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:46,844
negatively affecting user sentiment for the underlying company. So what are, in your experience,

1186
00:56:46,864 --> 00:56:51,531
some things that you've seen when you're testing that either made people say like,

1187
00:56:51,671 --> 00:56:58,060
oh wow, I really love Bungie for doing this, or surprising things that you saw people hate Bungie

1188
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:58,340
for?

1189
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:02,965
I mean, I think the number one, so the question was what things in our testing we found made

1190
00:57:02,985 --> 00:57:06,447
people like Bungie, like or hate Bungie in particular as opposed to the game.

1191
00:57:08,189 --> 00:57:11,331
I think the number one thing that actually stands out in my mind is matchmaking.

1192
00:57:11,351 --> 00:57:16,695
They don't see matchmaking and as you heard earlier RNG as being a product of the game.

1193
00:57:16,715 --> 00:57:22,219
They see it more as us being evil and messing with them is the number one thing.

1194
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,321
Things that make them like us.

1195
00:57:25,893 --> 00:57:28,117
I'm not sure the game itself makes them like us.

1196
00:57:28,237 --> 00:57:33,106
I think our community managers and those efforts make them like the company and the brand.

1197
00:57:33,747 --> 00:57:37,133
But I don't think the game itself lends them to like Bungie.

1198
00:57:38,284 --> 00:57:38,584
Over here.

1199
00:57:38,945 --> 00:57:39,345
Hi.

1200
00:57:39,385 --> 00:57:40,285
Thank you for the talk, by the way.

1201
00:57:40,305 --> 00:57:40,745
You're welcome.

1202
00:57:41,366 --> 00:57:46,008
I'm really fascinated with the contextual feedback that you were talking about and how

1203
00:57:46,068 --> 00:57:48,450
it was integrated into the world builder.

1204
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:52,192
Can you talk a little bit more about what that would look like for, say, a level designer

1205
00:57:52,232 --> 00:57:52,872
or an artist?

1206
00:57:53,152 --> 00:57:57,995
And now that the game is live, obviously we don't have this feedback functionality on

1207
00:57:58,035 --> 00:58:03,197
our controllers, but are you still collecting similar types of data and putting that into

1208
00:58:03,217 --> 00:58:06,159
the world builder with the live aspect of the game?

1209
00:58:06,868 --> 00:58:07,209
I'll switch.

1210
00:58:07,229 --> 00:58:10,651
So the question is, are we still collecting similar types

1211
00:58:10,671 --> 00:58:11,732
of data and putting it in the live version?

1212
00:58:12,012 --> 00:58:16,255
And what would that look like for a mobile game?

1213
00:58:16,676 --> 00:58:21,079
So even for a mobile game, what does

1214
00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:22,960
that look like for the actual people working

1215
00:58:23,101 --> 00:58:24,161
inside the editor?

1216
00:58:24,181 --> 00:58:26,603
Like a level designer or an artist, what would that?

1217
00:58:29,144 --> 00:58:29,965
what would they be seeing?

1218
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:32,269
I saw the image that you showed.

1219
00:58:32,369 --> 00:58:34,292
Yes, it pretty much looks like this to them.

1220
00:58:34,613 --> 00:58:34,813
Okay.

1221
00:58:34,974 --> 00:58:38,700
So, I mean, this is a screenshot from the World Editor itself.

1222
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,568
And those little red dots there are players getting killed.

1223
00:58:43,368 --> 00:58:44,509
The blue dots are players getting killed.

1224
00:58:44,549 --> 00:58:46,150
The red dots are what's killing them.

1225
00:58:46,751 --> 00:58:48,012
And so you can see there's a turret up there

1226
00:58:48,032 --> 00:58:48,993
in the middle of the screen that's

1227
00:58:49,213 --> 00:58:50,394
getting a lot of kills in that case.

1228
00:58:51,234 --> 00:58:52,595
This actually also, I'll toss in,

1229
00:58:52,816 --> 00:58:54,557
helped our QA department quite a bit,

1230
00:58:54,957 --> 00:58:56,859
because we found cases where people were being

1231
00:58:56,879 --> 00:58:58,240
shot through geometry this way.

1232
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,761
Oh, they're turning off the lights on me.

1233
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,704
So I think that is our last question.

1234
00:59:03,764 --> 00:59:04,925
I will hang around outside if anybody

1235
00:59:04,945 --> 00:59:05,666
has any more questions.

1236
00:59:05,726 --> 00:59:05,966
Thank you.
