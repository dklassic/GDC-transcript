00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:11,074
Hi, welcome to the digital version of my talk, Stop and Think, teaching players

2
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:12,815
about media manipulation and Headliner.

3
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:16,576
My name is Jakub Kysztolski and I'm the founder and creative director behind

4
00:00:16,656 --> 00:00:20,337
Headliner and Headliner Nowi News, which will be the case study for this talk.

5
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:22,778
So jumping into it, what are games?

6
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:24,939
Games at the core are about interaction.

7
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:27,480
I think that's their most unique feature.

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,761
While books can tell you something, movies can show you something, and poems

9
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:35,963
can make you feel something, games are the only art form that can make you do

10
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:36,423
something.

11
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:39,989
However, when we talk about games and game design,

12
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:42,932
we usually focus on things like engagement, fun,

13
00:00:43,072 --> 00:00:45,674
staying in the zone, staying in a state of flow.

14
00:00:46,134 --> 00:00:48,096
At the core, most games have a simple goal.

15
00:00:48,476 --> 00:00:49,718
Keep players playing.

16
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:51,639
However, here at Unbound Creations,

17
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:53,000
we have a slightly different goal.

18
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:55,683
We want our players to stop and introspect

19
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:58,866
and really think about what the game is telling them

20
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:01,148
and what their experiences can teach them.

21
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:04,585
Of course, there's a lot of other games that achieved that very well.

22
00:01:05,185 --> 00:01:09,468
Spec Ops The Line is a great example that makes players come in turns with the atrocities of war.

23
00:01:09,948 --> 00:01:16,272
Gun Home is also a bit of a narrative puzzle that just gives you enough information to get a glimpse

24
00:01:16,312 --> 00:01:21,535
of the story but ultimately leaves it up to you to piece everything together. The Walking Dead is

25
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:25,697
one of my favorite examples. It's one of those few games where I would literally spend five

26
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:31,000
minutes staring at my controller, unable to make a decision because I was conflicted by the choices

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,280
given.

28
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:37,429
But I wanted to give you another example that's made me appreciate the value of games' interactivity.

29
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:41,191
Some of you might have heard of a little game called Vampire Demasquerade Bloodlines.

30
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:47,995
It's a first-person role-playing immersive sim, kind of like Deus Ex or Thief, but you're

31
00:01:48,015 --> 00:01:53,438
a vampire in Los Angeles, and you sneak around at night, you do quests and side quests, you

32
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:58,361
uncover a grim scheme, conspiracy, and you bite people along the way.

33
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:04,281
When I started playing it, the game asks you what kind of vampire clan you want to be,

34
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:10,065
and I unwittingly chose a Malkadian without realizing that in the mythos of Vampire the

35
00:02:10,105 --> 00:02:15,610
Masquerade, that clan is basically insane. I didn't realize that the game was actually

36
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,934
rewritten and custom designed for that vampire type, with all the dialogue being slightly

37
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:27,379
different, with random things happening like little whispers or a stop sign would talk at you.

38
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:33,886
There was one point where I was at my virtual home watching television, which kind of gives you a

39
00:02:33,906 --> 00:02:38,309
recap of the recent events, some of it based on your actions in the game, and at one point the

40
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:43,493
anchor just looked straight at me and told me that the police is looking for a suspect and they know

41
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:51,500
it was me. And I just kind of looked around and I realized, oh my god, I'm insane. That was a very

42
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,061
powerful realization for me that...

43
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:58,024
could only come from a game because all this time I thought I was excusing in my head,

44
00:02:58,124 --> 00:03:02,866
rationalizing all those weird things happening, and without realizing that I basically have a

45
00:03:02,986 --> 00:03:06,927
mental illness in this game and all those things that I thought were normal actually were not.

46
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:12,329
It was a very shocking epiphany and taught me that games have a great power to make players

47
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:16,790
come to organic realizations. So with that, let me talk about our game,

48
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,211
Headliner and its sequel, Headliner Novenus.

49
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:21,940
In Headliner, you play as a news editor.

50
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:26,243
Every day, you get a stack of articles, you decide which ones get published, which don't,

51
00:03:26,743 --> 00:03:30,906
and then you walk through the city, you see how the city changes, you learn about the characters

52
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:35,248
and how their life is impacted by the media, and you also see how it affects your own life

53
00:03:35,308 --> 00:03:36,129
and your own family.

54
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:42,090
Someone described it once as the most realistic simulation of American mainstream media I've ever seen,

55
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,356
which is very flattering and kind of what we're going for.

56
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:49,703
So now you know how the game plays, but what is the game about? What was our goal?

57
00:03:50,388 --> 00:03:55,910
We wanted to make a game that makes players understand how and why media is manipulated

58
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,631
and question their own biases.

59
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:00,712
And more importantly, we wanted to do it organically.

60
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:03,073
We didn't want to tell the player what they should think.

61
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:05,874
We wanted the player to come to their own conclusions

62
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:08,896
and kind of steer them into the right direction.

63
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:13,958
And spoiler, this answer is much more complicated than just evil journalists

64
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:15,458
trying to manipulate us for clicks.

65
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:22,690
And I think it's a topic that's very relevant today, where sometimes just by switching which channel you're watching,

66
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:25,993
it feels like we're living in two parallel, opposite universes.

67
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:31,498
And I strongly believe that if history is written by the victors, then the present is written by the media.

68
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:37,123
And at the core, the game is also a bit of a moral and ethical dilemma asking you,

69
00:04:37,284 --> 00:04:39,866
what are you willing to do to get what you want?

70
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:43,929
Because you can always get what you want, but it always comes at a price.

71
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:53,480
At this point, I want to give you a little bit of an example of how I feel we were able to deliver on that premise, on that goal of making players stop and introspect.

72
00:04:54,661 --> 00:05:06,924
I was watching a Canadian streamer playing the game, and I think about half an hour into the game, one of her co-workers was having some health issues, so she ended up in a hospital and she was complaining about the system.

73
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:13,273
And that made the streamer reflect on her own experiences with nationalised healthcare in Canada

74
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:18,156
and that made people in the audience also pitch in with their experiences from different countries

75
00:05:18,196 --> 00:05:23,478
from Europe and the US. And basically the game was paused for a good 10 minutes as...

76
00:05:24,288 --> 00:05:26,931
the streamer chatted with the audience and Oni chatted back,

77
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:31,176
just sharing experiences and just introspecting about the pros and cons

78
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:34,761
of various health care policies and decisions and their impressions,

79
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:37,704
which is exactly what we hope to evoke with this game.

80
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:40,247
We want to make players to stop and think.

81
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:44,112
And I think that was a very good moment that illustrates that.

82
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:47,625
Besides that, we've also had some world impact, likely.

83
00:05:49,107 --> 00:05:51,949
Our game has actually been used to teach a class on media literacy at the

84
00:05:51,989 --> 00:05:53,690
Pacific Buddhist Academy in Hawaii.

85
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,453
And we've also talked to several other institutions about using it as a

86
00:05:56,493 --> 00:06:01,156
teaching tool. We got a mention in the GeekWire, LA Times, Philip DeFranco

87
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:05,820
show, which is a big news YouTuber, kind of breaking the barrier of just

88
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,121
being mentioned in gaming press.

89
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:09,363
We also recently got a feature in the Scottish Sun.

90
00:06:10,124 --> 00:06:12,305
This game has also been a case study for several other talks.

91
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:14,267
I've given at IGDA events, Foundry 10.

92
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:17,213
Seattle Indies and Seattle ATT&CK events.

93
00:06:17,713 --> 00:06:20,575
It currently has 95% positive user reviews on Steam.

94
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:23,818
It's won a Silver Award at Serious Play Conference,

95
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,539
Best Indie Game of Tokyo Game Show,

96
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,101
we've been to IndieCade, we've been to Mini Mega Booth,

97
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:29,642
and a few other events.

98
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:32,885
We actually also made the game more affordable in countries that

99
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:37,508
have struggled really badly with misinformation on social media

100
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:39,490
and the news cycle, such as the Philippines.

101
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,293
So we just bumped the price down as low as we could to make it really accessible.

102
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:49,562
Pretty soon the game will also be featured at the Australian Centre for Moving Images and their exhibit about journalism.

103
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,884
And I'm mentioning that not just to brag about it,

104
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:56,007
but also to bring the fact that it's an example of how a game can reach

105
00:06:56,548 --> 00:07:02,092
non-gaming press and non-gaming audience and it can really be something more than just pure entertainment.

106
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:08,057
It can really go out there in the world and make other people reflect and question their own beliefs.

107
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:13,141
So how do we achieve that? You kind of know our goal now, you know the premise of the game, but

108
00:07:14,194 --> 00:07:16,596
This talk is about creating those kind of experiences.

109
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:18,518
So let's jump into the development process.

110
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:23,403
We basically had eight pillars and constraints that I will now go through in

111
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:29,230
order to give you an idea of why we did them and how we implemented them and what

112
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,293
the desired outcome was and whether or not we achieved it.

113
00:07:32,773 --> 00:07:36,337
So jumping straight into the first one, the picking important and relevant issues.

114
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,103
I think it's important to focus on things that are relevant to people's lives,

115
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:46,709
not only to draw them in, but also to send messages that are relevant to today's life.

116
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,712
So how I did it is basically a lot of data mining.

117
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:55,355
There's been a lot of talk about using Facebook and Google to mine data.

118
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:57,457
And that's basically what I did.

119
00:07:57,697 --> 00:08:01,400
And I didn't have to spend a dime or do anything that's illegal.

120
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,263
I just used the ad planning tools to kind of put different issues,

121
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:09,886
to put in information for my target demographic and various criteria like,

122
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:12,448
hey, people are interested in video games and maybe activism.

123
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:18,892
and then cross-reference that with different issues like LGBT rights or homelessness or

124
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:25,417
immigration issues or healthcare and kind of gouge what the reach would be of those kind of ads to get

125
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:30,920
a rough estimate of how many people interested in those social issues are, also using a lot

126
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,342
of different synonyms or different qualifiers.

127
00:08:33,982 --> 00:08:40,087
And of course, it's not 100% scientific. It's not something I would base a study on, but it's a

128
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:45,812
useful data point to go off of. And it was also interesting to see different trends locally

129
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:52,157
versus nationally versus globally. For example, in Seattle, there was a big push for homelessness,

130
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:56,461
but globally on the US as a whole, it wasn't as much of an issue.

131
00:08:56,481 --> 00:09:00,124
And there were also different trends between Europe versus the US.

132
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:05,085
At the time it was also a big Syrian refugee crisis, it was a big talking point in Europe,

133
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,506
which was not as big of an issue in the US, for example.

134
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:13,088
So it was definitely a very eye-opening experience, even if it was ultimately just a data point.

135
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:18,049
On top of that, I've also conducted some in-person interviews, and that was me literally going

136
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:21,790
to a coffee shop and going to random people and asking them, hey, can I take a few minutes

137
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,671
of your time to ask you a few questions?

138
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:28,772
And again, those are very local, so they're not broadly applicable, but they were a bit

139
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:29,132
more...

140
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:29,232
Yeah.

141
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:36,397
in depth, allowing to ask some follow ups and get a bit more reasoning behind those choices.

142
00:09:36,997 --> 00:09:41,540
After putting all that together and also taking this idea that I know I myself wanted to focus on.

143
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:47,347
I kind of pulled them into four main themes or categories that would be running out for the game.

144
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,668
And due to the divisive nature of a lot of narrative and media these days,

145
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:55,170
it was pretty easy to divide them into two sides of the same coin.

146
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,952
So, for instance, globalization and nationalism could be divided into closed versus open borders,

147
00:10:00,252 --> 00:10:05,494
war versus diplomacy, healthcare could be public versus private, regulation versus free market.

148
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:11,176
And that led itself really well to representing those issues in-game through news articles.

149
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:16,218
It was also important to make all those issues and all those stories believable.

150
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:21,120
So that involved looking at a lot of existing news channels, anywhere from

151
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,422
CNN to MSNBC to, yes, even Fox News, kind of to pick up on what issues are

152
00:10:26,562 --> 00:10:29,463
being talked about, how are they being talked about, how are the headlines

153
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,203
structured, what is the first paragraph like since...

154
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:35,085
all the in-game articles are deliberately a little short.

155
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:39,907
So we kind of wanted to mimic that first eye-grabbing summary that most articles have.

156
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:43,789
So to give you an example, there's one of the recurring themes is immigration,

157
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:49,092
and there's a lot of worries about immigrants coming in and being a threat to this society.

158
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:53,694
And a lot of those ideas and rhetoric is based on the things that we've seen in press.

159
00:10:54,194 --> 00:10:56,836
And again, it was an issue that's both important in the US,

160
00:10:56,976 --> 00:10:59,917
with the caravan crisis and things like that.

161
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:06,580
as well as Europe with aforementioned Syrian refugee crisis. Another example is of minority

162
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,002
discrimination, especially in the first game, and some of the topics raised were whether that

163
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:14,583
minority, certain minority group should have marriage rights, which is kind of mimicking

164
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:20,425
what has been going on in the US with LGBTQ and gay rights. So that's an example of taking

165
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:25,567
sort of real world issues and retrofitting them into the game, and maybe obfuscating

166
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:27,768
them a little bit, which I will get to in a second.

167
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:36,226
So moving on to the next point, which I think is also equally important, is that even though we're presenting all of those familiar issues,

168
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:41,051
I believe it's important to represent both sides fairly and accurately in a way that

169
00:11:41,471 --> 00:11:47,557
everyone can relate to, because ultimately the bigger point is teaching about the media and not the specific issues.

170
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:53,102
If your game has a very clear agenda, say pro or against immigration, then people who

171
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:58,897
do not agree with that will immediately be turned off. Those are the people who are in your target

172
00:11:58,957 --> 00:12:04,082
audience. Those are the people who you want to help question their own beliefs. We kind of wanted

173
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:08,987
to lure players into following their own belief, their own biases, and seeing their far-reaching

174
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:09,608
consequences.

175
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:18,528
As I previously mentioned, that involved a lot of really existing media and kind of getting an idea of what are the arguments for and against, how are they being talked about.

176
00:12:18,548 --> 00:12:22,650
I also looked at a lot of historical photographs from values protests.

177
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:28,413
So a lot of slogans, a lot of catchy phrases we've kind of retrofitted into the game as well.

178
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:34,320
I've also looked at more direct sources where people are actually discussing those issues,

179
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,805
such as Reddit, Facebook groups, kind of looking for the comments and seeing how are actual people,

180
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:43,250
not just news channels, but how are actual people talking about those issues amongst each other,

181
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,813
what are they arguing for, what are they arguing against.

182
00:12:46,527 --> 00:12:48,389
And to give you an example of a nationalized healthcare,

183
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:51,272
is I would look for what are the arguments for this issue,

184
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,193
what are the arguments against this issue,

185
00:12:53,654 --> 00:12:55,696
and not just what I thought the arguments were,

186
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:57,878
but what the actual arguments are,

187
00:12:57,938 --> 00:13:00,501
because it's very easy to build kind of like a straw man idea

188
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:01,642
of what the opposition is.

189
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:03,064
But if you actually dig in,

190
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:04,465
you'll actually see that there might be a lot

191
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:05,886
of different concerns out there

192
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:07,348
that you might have not considered.

193
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:11,891
it's also part of the reason why there's a lot of miscommunication between two sides.

194
00:13:12,232 --> 00:13:17,055
I would also look if there's maybe scientific journals or maybe stats that back up either

195
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:21,238
one to give it a little bit more legitimacy and maybe also replicate the kind of reporting

196
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:25,241
that's being done on statistics, which I will give you an example of later.

197
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:28,383
And that overall helps it make it more believable and genuine.

198
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:36,915
It allows us to show those effects more directly, which I think it's critical to not just talk about those issues, but have those be part of the gaming experience.

199
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:48,958
So, for example, with health care, if you push for it and it gets accepted and enters the national program, then your brother can now get therapy and he starts talking about cognitive behavioral therapy terms.

200
00:13:49,398 --> 00:13:55,660
So if anybody ever has gone through that, they'll immediately find it relatable and immediately find it more believable and genuine.

201
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,540
Conversely, your co-workers...

202
00:13:58,432 --> 00:14:04,055
stuck, maybe waiting at a hospital, maybe they have a long wait time, maybe they can't get the treatment they want in time,

203
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:08,558
which is probably the number one complaint I've heard about nationalized healthcare systems.

204
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:15,282
So again, it's something that people on that side will find immediately relatable and they'll be able to just roll with it and

205
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:19,164
fall into the experience and kind of get that bigger message over time,

206
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:22,646
rather than being pushed away because they feel the game is talking at them.

207
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:27,983
So again, to give you an example, I was watching another streamer, this one from Brazil, talking

208
00:14:28,103 --> 00:14:33,484
about the elections of Bolsonaro and it was again talking about healthcare issues and the policies

209
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:40,727
that the country was taking on. So the chat started chatting about being either pro or against. Some

210
00:14:40,987 --> 00:14:45,288
were supporters of the president, some were against them, and the game just provided that

211
00:14:45,348 --> 00:14:49,409
background for the discussion. And what was nice is that it was

212
00:14:50,216 --> 00:14:53,579
a very civil discussion where people weren't jumping to each other's throats,

213
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:58,303
where people weren't being defensive because the game wasn't necessarily attacking them.

214
00:14:58,323 --> 00:15:03,888
And I think not having that agenda just created that ground where both sides felt they could

215
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:09,532
equally relate to it and share their thoughts and feelings and experiences, rather than one

216
00:15:10,073 --> 00:15:12,775
side feeling like they have to be on the defensive or on the offensive.

217
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:20,533
So moving on, I think it's also important to have a fictional setting rather than just copying the

218
00:15:20,593 --> 00:15:25,116
real world directly. And I think the fictional setting acts as a little bit of a buffer that

219
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:30,139
lets people distance themselves a little bit and also lets people fall into their own biases a

220
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:36,883
little bit more easily versus if it's an actual issue in real life, they're going to be much more

221
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:41,906
guarded and it's going to be harder for them to buy into the fantasy of pushing clickbait articles

222
00:15:41,986 --> 00:15:43,346
than pushing an agenda.

223
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:53,986
To give you an example, the first game is set in a world where people are genetically modified to the point where the non-modified have become a marginalized minority.

224
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:55,626
There's only like 10% of them.

225
00:15:56,107 --> 00:16:05,351
So there's this new narrative, kind of similar to the movie Garakka, where people who are not genetically modified are seen as an inferior and being discriminated.

226
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:09,495
It's just a broader allegory for any kind of minority group rights.

227
00:16:09,775 --> 00:16:13,018
And I mentioned earlier some parallels to LGBTQ movement.

228
00:16:13,358 --> 00:16:17,261
So if we did use something like immigrant rights or LGBTQ,

229
00:16:17,802 --> 00:16:20,664
I think people would immediately come with strong feelings towards that.

230
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:23,386
And I think having this kind of a buffer helps people to

231
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:25,608
fall down the rabbit hole more easily.

232
00:16:25,848 --> 00:16:29,211
It just makes it easier for our game to encourage you to push clickbait articles,

233
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:30,552
because, you know, we're not advertising,

234
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,593
hey, we should demonize.

235
00:16:32,194 --> 00:16:36,135
this group in real life that you know, just some fictional group that you know.

236
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,916
So yeah, just go ahead, demonize them.

237
00:16:37,936 --> 00:16:39,856
You know, we need the clicks, we need the ratings.

238
00:16:40,296 --> 00:16:41,257
Just don't think about it.

239
00:16:41,557 --> 00:16:44,018
Just do it for the number, do it for the gram.

240
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:49,020
Getting more and more extreme and ridiculous until hopefully they reach a point where they

241
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,001
realize, hey, wait a minute, this is just like this real life issue.

242
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:56,782
And I've been pushing all this horrible agenda that's basically inhuman.

243
00:16:57,463 --> 00:16:58,043
Oh, crap.

244
00:16:58,263 --> 00:16:59,883
Maybe this is what's happening in real world.

245
00:16:59,963 --> 00:17:01,464
And maybe now I have to rethink that.

246
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:05,642
But even so, even though we have everything fictional and kind of buffered a little bit,

247
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:06,245
we still have

248
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:11,008
I don't want to think about those things when I play a game.

249
00:17:11,768 --> 00:17:14,330
And frankly, I don't know how to resolve that.

250
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,251
I don't know if maybe doing more of a buffer would be effective,

251
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:22,214
or maybe that would risk being too distant and players not being in that connection.

252
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:26,876
Maybe it's an unsolvable problem and there will always be players who just want to turn their brain

253
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:29,378
off when they play a game, which is totally fine.

254
00:17:29,538 --> 00:17:32,700
And you know, I enjoy my Team Fortress 2 shooting people in the face as well.

255
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,162
But it's something to be aware of that you won't be able to convince everyone that plays the game.

256
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:43,361
Moving on, now that we have our issues, we have no agenda, we have a nice buffered setting,

257
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:49,583
we still have to show the effect of all those issues, we have to humanize them, and I like

258
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,985
to do that through the characters in the narrative.

259
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:56,306
I don't think it's effective if the game simply tells you moral lessons, it's better if a

260
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:59,788
character in the game you care about tells you about them, and it's even more effective

261
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:01,829
if it happens to them or to you directly.

262
00:18:02,511 --> 00:18:05,652
And I think one of my favorite examples is I was chatting with someone during an

263
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:10,333
interview who was talking about having an article that was basically a sponsored

264
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:13,693
piece that they were contemplating whether they wanted to publish or not.

265
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:16,974
They didn't agree with it, but it would give them potentially a raise.

266
00:18:17,454 --> 00:18:21,255
So after contemplating for a few minutes, they decided, I am going to publish this

267
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:23,195
because I need to feed my dog.

268
00:18:24,195 --> 00:18:28,936
And I think that's a perfect example of why having kind of a human relatable

269
00:18:29,056 --> 00:18:29,917
things in the game.

270
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:44,866
helps you question your judgment a little bit more because it introduces that limit of that personal bias that I think is often overlooked a lot in reporting and journalism and online conversations that, you know, we all come from different backgrounds, we all have different things we care about.

271
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:53,795
And those influence our choices, no matter how objective we try to be, we always have people in our life who are affected by those issues, and that'll affect our judgment as well.

272
00:18:54,405 --> 00:19:02,208
So a good example is your brother, who is an aspiring comedian but also struggling with some mental issues and also struggling with imposter syndrome.

273
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:06,150
And a lot of the policies you push for will affect him directly.

274
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:09,452
We wanted the player to really care about their brother and we try to...

275
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:12,134
make him be a part of your in-game life.

276
00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:16,199
He asks you about your job, he asks you about your dating life, if you end up dating one

277
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:17,160
of the other characters.

278
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,084
He comes over to your place, he plays with your dog, he cooks you dinner.

279
00:19:21,564 --> 00:19:25,429
So we do a lot to kind of reinforce that connection between you and the brother.

280
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:29,573
And there's a few times where he may open up to you about his issues and kind of have

281
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:31,034
a very heart-to-heart conversation.

282
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:36,108
One little trick I use early on is I've read in psychological studies that,

283
00:19:36,568 --> 00:19:38,269
for instance, if you do someone a small favor,

284
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:42,830
that actually makes you feel more favorable towards that person because your

285
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,630
mind is rationalizing that, hey, if I did something nice to them,

286
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,911
this means I have to like them or they have to be a good person because I did

287
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:52,632
them a favor. So one of the first things your brother would ask you is, hey,

288
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:55,872
can you run to the store and get me some antacid because my anxiety is acting up

289
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:57,593
and my stomach is feeling funky.

290
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,713
That kind of creates a little bit of a connection you have with the character.

291
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,917
But what was also important is that the very next day when you meet the brother again,

292
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,419
he actually pays you back.

293
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:10,082
And a lot of players were actually very surprised that he paid you back,

294
00:20:10,303 --> 00:20:13,206
but in a pleasant way, because it reinforced the idea that,

295
00:20:13,506 --> 00:20:15,428
oh, my brother is not going to rip me off.

296
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,309
He's reliable.

297
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,411
I can give him money and he's going to give it back to me.

298
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:20,653
So it immediately established a level of trust as well.

299
00:20:21,443 --> 00:20:28,567
Another example is also your co-worker. She's also an immigrant and how you push the news will affect her directly.

300
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:35,231
If you push for a lot of xenophobia, then her work status may be affected because she's still on just a work visa.

301
00:20:35,831 --> 00:20:40,534
And she's also a character that is dateable, so it creates another context of interest that,

302
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:47,618
hey, maybe you want to pursue a relationship with her, but you also have beliefs in your news that hurt her directly.

303
00:20:48,278 --> 00:20:54,161
So again, it creates that very real human conflict inside you that hopefully makes you realize that

304
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:56,922
some policies may be hurtful to the people you care about.

305
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:04,866
Another character is Rudy. He's your local shopkeeper and a single father just trying to provide for his little daughter. And unlike your co-worker,

306
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:10,028
he worries that all the foreign megacorporation are going to come in and going to destroy his little business.

307
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:15,011
So he's again at odds with the other character and creating another layer of conflict.

308
00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:21,608
And your actions will also affect his store, which is also where you go to buy things for your house.

309
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:28,071
So if you basically destroy his little business, then you can no longer buy the things you want for your house.

310
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,892
So that's also a way that affects you directly as a player.

311
00:21:30,912 --> 00:21:34,573
Even your boss plays kind of a hardball and is very stern with you.

312
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:39,415
There's a few moments where he shows a little bit of a weakness or personal character.

313
00:21:40,095 --> 00:21:43,837
And as you keep playing, you eventually start to realize that he is such a hardball because...

314
00:21:44,508 --> 00:21:51,070
It is genuinely a difficult business to be in and at the end of the day he just wants everybody to have a job, he wants everybody to get their checks paid.

315
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:59,673
So if you badmouth one of the sponsors and they pull out, then suddenly everybody loses their yearly bonuses and now it's on him because he can't provide for his team.

316
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:05,315
And I think it's important to have a variety of characters so that a wide variety of players can always find someone they can relate to.

317
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:17,106
Your brother Justin is something that I think a lot of indie devs or even YouTube creators or influencers can relate to as someone who's always struggling with imposter syndrome and trying to be in the public eye.

318
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:22,113
Then there's Evie, you know, she's also an immigrant and she's always struggling with

319
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:26,615
some discrimination. Again, that's something that probably a lot of people can relate to.

320
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:32,537
A rude idiot shopkeeper, he's a father figure, so that's something a lot of parents could probably

321
00:22:32,597 --> 00:22:37,759
find themselves in. So it gives a lot of people someone to connect with and someone who they can

322
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:43,762
really care and root for for the game. Moving on to the next point, having no good or bad outcomes,

323
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:46,783
only trade-offs, is important for reinforcing

324
00:22:47,702 --> 00:22:50,825
the overall message I mentioned about not talking at the players,

325
00:22:51,225 --> 00:22:54,648
but helping players come to organic realizations for their own actions.

326
00:22:55,271 --> 00:22:58,192
And by that, I don't mean that it doesn't mean that bad things won't happen.

327
00:22:58,292 --> 00:23:02,154
It's just that there isn't like a win or lose condition.

328
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:03,895
It's not about being right or wrong.

329
00:23:04,095 --> 00:23:08,257
It's about paying the price for what you want and always facing those trade-offs.

330
00:23:08,757 --> 00:23:11,358
So in the first game, that was actually very simple.

331
00:23:11,418 --> 00:23:12,718
We had three main objectives.

332
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,520
Your career, your family, or the society at large.

333
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,480
Choose two.

334
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,461
One of them you can do really well in.

335
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:19,861
Second will be kind of okay.

336
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,862
And the third one will just burn to the ground.

337
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:24,463
So it always forces you into considering the trade-offs.

338
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:29,971
The new game, Headliner Novi News, is bigger and more complex, so there is a lot more room

339
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:30,672
for nuance.

340
00:23:31,232 --> 00:23:34,954
So I went with a simple rule, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, aka

341
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,796
no good deed goes unpunished.

342
00:23:38,276 --> 00:23:43,899
So if one choice affects a character positively, it will affect another character negatively.

343
00:23:44,537 --> 00:23:47,539
And because we had three main issues and three main characters,

344
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:51,602
it was easy to create a little, a very simple kind of a cascading matrix of

345
00:23:52,022 --> 00:23:56,385
alternating effects where every character was intertwined with another one in opposite ways.

346
00:23:56,825 --> 00:23:59,908
It was just very simple and clean, but also lend itself

347
00:24:00,108 --> 00:24:03,510
well to creating a lot of friction and player decision making.

348
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:07,954
And that's what helps us create a scenario where the players would have to consider that,

349
00:24:08,254 --> 00:24:12,137
yes, you can get what you want, but how far are you willing to go to get it?

350
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:16,481
What are you going to sacrifice in the process? Who are you going to throw under the bus?

351
00:24:16,841 --> 00:24:19,564
And what other unintended consequences your choice might have?

352
00:24:20,404 --> 00:24:23,327
However, there's a word of caution here that I've learned. Psychologically,

353
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:26,690
we tend to perceive negative effects much more strongly than positive effects.

354
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:31,592
So initially, when everything was really balanced, people still felt like they're lost.

355
00:24:31,712 --> 00:24:35,475
They got what they wanted, but because they felt the negative effects more strongly,

356
00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:37,136
they still felt like they were losing.

357
00:24:37,357 --> 00:24:40,359
We had to rebalance things and kind of ease things a little bit

358
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:43,682
and exaggerate the positives, downplay the negatives, because

359
00:24:44,402 --> 00:24:49,727
I think there is a difference between feeling like you can't win or you always lose.

360
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:52,669
And it's a very fine line that we tried not to cross.

361
00:24:53,715 --> 00:24:58,157
Moving on to the next point, and this is something that's now a little bit more specific to our game,

362
00:24:58,637 --> 00:25:03,960
but it may be something useful to consider as you design something similar or in this space.

363
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,323
Replayability. The game is about the effect of media on society, so the best way to experience

364
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:15,046
that is to see all the different ways the game could play out and all the different influences

365
00:25:15,066 --> 00:25:19,728
you could have as a news channel. So play it multiple times, see all the different endings,

366
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:20,849
see all the different meanings.

367
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:25,094
So how do we achieve that? First of all, the game is deliberately short. The first

368
00:25:25,134 --> 00:25:29,316
headliner was actually only 45 minutes long for a single playthrough, which is also, by the way,

369
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:35,237
a perfect length for a class. There's a lot of multiple parallel branchings. Each character

370
00:25:35,277 --> 00:25:39,398
has actually three to five different endings and they're not all necessarily mutually exclusive,

371
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,079
so you can kind of get a mix of different endings.

372
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:47,454
We also introduced new content on subsequent playthrough and have a little bit of fourth-wall breaking,

373
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:51,218
similar to what the Doki Doki Literature Club or Nier Atamada do.

374
00:25:51,238 --> 00:25:53,860
It was definitely a big inspiration during development.

375
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:57,824
For example, when you start a game, the whole intro sequence is different,

376
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:00,667
and it kinda alludes to a radio of parallel timelines.

377
00:26:01,247 --> 00:26:05,750
When you start playing the first day, all the character conversations are completely rewritten,

378
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:10,453
they show a different side of the character, and they all allude to this former, previous

379
00:26:10,493 --> 00:26:16,136
headliner that maybe has done some bad things. So it communicates to the player that, hey,

380
00:26:16,236 --> 00:26:21,920
the game knows that I'm replaying it, so I should expect something new, I should expect there to be

381
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,103
new experiences. We also add a new character and make some minor gameplay changes and some

382
00:26:27,143 --> 00:26:30,305
different events to make that experience feel fresh.

383
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:35,912
We also play on the insider knowledge, where now that the player kind of knows how roughly the story plays out,

384
00:26:36,192 --> 00:26:39,376
they can prepare better for certain bad events that might come.

385
00:26:39,777 --> 00:26:43,602
An example of this, at one point your brother may end up in prison.

386
00:26:44,377 --> 00:26:50,642
And I had a player who said that the day before that happened, they bought a big couch and a bunch of furniture for their home,

387
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,684
so they didn't have the bail money anymore.

388
00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:55,687
And they were just distraught that they couldn't get their brother out.

389
00:26:56,067 --> 00:27:00,872
But now that they're replaying it, they know that this might happen, so they're gonna be smart about saving up.

390
00:27:01,673 --> 00:27:04,115
Which leads us right to the next point, kill your NPCs.

391
00:27:04,931 --> 00:27:09,738
Because the game is meant to be replayed multiple times, then we can just kill an NPC halfway through the game.

392
00:27:09,918 --> 00:27:14,465
And it's okay if they're missing for the rest of the game, because the player is probably going to replay it.

393
00:27:14,526 --> 00:27:18,311
Now they can save it and uncover a whole new storyline maybe they missed the first time around.

394
00:27:19,228 --> 00:27:22,872
And last, it's a very unique feature we did, it's called the Share Your Ending feature.

395
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:26,636
As I mentioned, each character has several different endings.

396
00:27:27,097 --> 00:27:30,961
So when you beat the game, you get a little five-sentence summary of all your major outcomes.

397
00:27:31,402 --> 00:27:33,504
And you have a chance to share that with the community.

398
00:27:34,205 --> 00:27:37,529
And before you start the game, you see the previous player's ending.

399
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:43,543
So again, it encourages you to replay game by seeing all the different potential outcomes there are.

400
00:27:44,224 --> 00:27:46,364
And we've actually done this through Twitter.

401
00:27:46,485 --> 00:27:49,626
So if you go to Twitter and search for the hashtag IAMHeadliner2,

402
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:53,648
you're going to see all the different player endings and all different combinations.

403
00:27:54,328 --> 00:27:56,669
We also kept the summaries a little bit vague,

404
00:27:56,729 --> 00:28:00,951
so that they give you the sense of the possibilities without spoiling it away.

405
00:28:01,211 --> 00:28:02,391
Honestly, all this was...

406
00:28:03,194 --> 00:28:08,099
difficult. We probably rewrote the whole story maybe three times over, and it was a lot of

407
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:13,825
testing, adjusting all throughout the process, a lot of rewriting, which is also part of the

408
00:28:13,865 --> 00:28:18,511
reason why I didn't want to do voiceovers, because that dialogue kept changing constantly.

409
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:24,277
A framework that kind of worked best for this is instead of having a single branching narrative,

410
00:28:24,892 --> 00:28:28,814
What I did is I set up each character as sort of having their own independent storylines

411
00:28:28,854 --> 00:28:34,477
that were interconnected through various issues that I mentioned in kind of that cascading

412
00:28:34,877 --> 00:28:35,417
matrix.

413
00:28:35,978 --> 00:28:38,599
And also maybe at some points they would interact with one another.

414
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:43,982
For instance, your date may come to your brother's comedy event if you invite her.

415
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:47,264
Or Rudy may talk about your brother coming into your store drunk.

416
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:52,020
But mostly they were just separate tiny little small branching narratives,

417
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:55,782
which was much more manageable than like a giant massive tree.

418
00:28:56,242 --> 00:28:58,783
And it also allowed us to create that effect of having

419
00:28:59,224 --> 00:29:01,405
different mix and match endings for the characters.

420
00:29:02,063 --> 00:29:06,969
which a lot of players that we've seen enjoyed kind of trying to game the system and trying to

421
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:12,736
find sort of like the best combination of outcomes and because it's not entirely deterministic either

422
00:29:12,756 --> 00:29:18,062
and there's some wiggle room there's also a few cases where you've got endings that I frankly

423
00:29:18,743 --> 00:29:23,704
didn't know was possible. For instance, in the first game, there's a case where basically the

424
00:29:23,744 --> 00:29:29,426
whole city gets torn to the ground, your daughter disappears in the riots, and then your wife says

425
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:33,947
that she's content and happy with how things turned out. And I didn't even know that combination

426
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:39,029
was possible. I thought it wasn't, but apparently somehow they did it, and they shared their ending

427
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:44,730
with a comment saying like, yep, I married a sociopath. So it was a fun little element of

428
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,351
an emergent gameplay that

429
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:53,936
wasn't even unintended and again this system lent itself well to giving that possibility of that happening.

430
00:29:55,057 --> 00:30:00,462
And now to share some fun stats. Over half of the players that beat the game at least once beat it again,

431
00:30:01,223 --> 00:30:04,806
7% played it five times, 28% shared their ending and 85% of players adopted the doggo.

432
00:30:08,915 --> 00:30:12,918
So moving on to the next pillar, teaching by doing. If we want the players to learn about

433
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:17,061
media manipulation, we have to make them manipulate some media. So this is based on a number of

434
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:22,164
techniques that I've either seen or read about being commonly used in media to kind of distort

435
00:30:22,264 --> 00:30:27,908
reality or push an agenda. One of the most basic examples that we are probably familiar with is

436
00:30:27,948 --> 00:30:34,172
statistical manipulation. So using data to prove a point that maybe doesn't really prove that point

437
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:35,633
if you under further scrutiny.

438
00:30:36,364 --> 00:30:39,190
So one mechanic we have in the game is where you get two articles,

439
00:30:39,651 --> 00:30:43,899
they are stapled together, and you have to choose one. The other will be rejected automatically.

440
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,346
So this way the game basically forces you into picking a side.

441
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:51,816
So at one point we used that to show how statistical manipulation works.

442
00:30:52,096 --> 00:30:56,038
We had two articles that both cite the same study with the same number,

443
00:30:56,478 --> 00:30:58,879
but they presented differently and drew a different conclusion.

444
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,100
One uses a fraction, one uses a percentage,

445
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:06,582
one talks about it being really low, the other talks about it being too big

446
00:31:06,962 --> 00:31:07,803
and too impactful.

447
00:31:08,623 --> 00:31:11,085
And I've seen that events where people get to that point,

448
00:31:11,105 --> 00:31:12,607
they would just nod their head and be like,

449
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:14,028
oh, I see what's going on there.

450
00:31:14,648 --> 00:31:17,230
Hopefully that makes them be a little bit more skeptical

451
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,672
next time they see a number in paper

452
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:21,474
and maybe they'll think twice about checking on,

453
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:22,895
hey, what's the sample size?

454
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:25,638
Or what's the inverse of the percentage mean?

455
00:31:25,698 --> 00:31:27,259
Is it really as bad as it sounds?

456
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:28,780
Maybe it's just framed this way.

457
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,942
Another example is profiling.

458
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:33,990
Every few days, you'll get an article about a crime being committed,

459
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:38,512
and it'll either describe as being done by someone who's foreign looking or maybe

460
00:31:38,712 --> 00:31:40,452
someone who looks like a native.

461
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:45,175
And depending on which articles you publish will shape the opinion of people.

462
00:31:45,295 --> 00:31:48,856
For example, if you only publish articles talking about crimes committed by the

463
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:52,778
foreigners, then suddenly everybody on the streets will think that it's only

464
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:54,059
foreigners committing crimes.

465
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:58,901
And we already see that so much, especially around racial lines in the US.

466
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,571
And it's something that I really wanted to also showcase in the game.

467
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:07,512
And it's a little bit more subtle where it's not quite spelled out as much as in the previous issue.

468
00:32:08,112 --> 00:32:13,894
Because we wanted the players, again, to organically notice that, hey, everyone is starting commenting about the media,

469
00:32:13,914 --> 00:32:16,695
only talking about those kind of crimes being committed by these people.

470
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:20,055
Oh, crap, maybe it's because of the articles I've been publishing.

471
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:23,496
But actually the number of articles for either side is equal.

472
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:26,677
So it really depends on how you frame it and which ones you decide to publish.

473
00:32:27,996 --> 00:32:30,898
Another common technique is repetition, lies of omission.

474
00:32:31,238 --> 00:32:34,501
So your boss constantly pushes you to stick to your same viewpoints,

475
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:39,504
keep pushing it further, because merely being exposed to the same idea over and over

476
00:32:39,564 --> 00:32:43,487
and over, you start to believe it even subconsciously, even if you think you don't.

477
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:46,249
So, again, that's a very powerful technique

478
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:49,751
in media where you just get steamrolled with certain information.

479
00:32:50,963 --> 00:32:54,747
Another example is scapegoating, which is something we see in media all the time.

480
00:32:54,927 --> 00:33:00,012
Whenever something bad or tragic happens, there's always this need to pin the blame on something.

481
00:33:00,632 --> 00:33:05,777
As the saying goes, there's nothing to fear but fear itself, and there's nothing scarier than

482
00:33:05,797 --> 00:33:11,002
the unknown. So we often jump to conclusions even when we don't have the full information.

483
00:33:11,843 --> 00:33:15,166
An example of that in the real world is the Kavanaugh kids'

484
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:21,241
thing which exploded overnight and a lot of people kept flip-flopping on who are

485
00:33:21,261 --> 00:33:25,485
they blaming and every day there was new information coming out. There was a lot

486
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:30,150
of online rage that even now hasn't gone away. There's people who still haven't

487
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,213
changed their minds even though there's contradictory information that came out

488
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:37,036
because they made those initial impression because there was such a need

489
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:40,259
to you know have a villain that people could just pin all their hate on.

490
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,023
and that's something that happens in the game where there's some bad events that happen

491
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:48,066
and you're pressured to, you know, just choose someone as a culprit, you know,

492
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:52,009
here's all the potential things we can blame, just choose something, we need to give people an answer.

493
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:56,953
There's also a third option that's not spelled out where you can actually not publish any of the

494
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:01,797
articles and not blame anything and the game actually acknowledges that and your brother

495
00:34:01,818 --> 00:34:06,301
even makes comments that he's glad that for once we're taking the time to think rationally through

496
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:08,663
this and gather information before we jump to conclusions.

497
00:34:09,887 --> 00:34:16,609
Another example is packaging, bundling, and hidden agendas where you're trying to push a story about

498
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:21,010
something but maybe embedded in there is some kind of a hidden message that you haven't really

499
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:25,231
noticed but it can kind of get subconsciously lodged in your head. A real-world example we're

500
00:34:25,251 --> 00:34:29,113
seeing right now is when talking about coronavirus, I've seen some reporters refer to it as the

501
00:34:29,173 --> 00:34:35,034
Chinese coronavirus, which is kind of a sneaky way of pinning the blame on China and spreading a

502
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:36,715
little bit of xenophobic rhetoric.

503
00:34:37,802 --> 00:34:41,262
Another thing that you'll see in the game is government and financial pressures.

504
00:34:41,702 --> 00:34:45,943
So whether it's government officials announcing you as fake news or loading you as the voice

505
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:50,924
of the people, or maybe your company's struggling with staying afloat, needing to sell out a little

506
00:34:50,944 --> 00:34:57,025
bit to get extra funding, it's something that's very real. And when I visited the Boston Globe

507
00:34:57,085 --> 00:35:01,446
at a journalism conference several months ago, financing was one of their biggest concerns,

508
00:35:01,506 --> 00:35:02,647
because unfortunately,

509
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:12,357
Ads on online articles don't pay the bills anymore, which is why you're seeing a rise of things like BuzzFeed and clickbait articles, because you have to draw the viewers in somehow.

510
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:29,372
And lastly, now that you have all your issues, you have them cleanly laid out in a fictional setting with no agendas, you have relatable characters, you have balanced trade-offs, you have replayability, teaching player system literacy, don't forget to put the game in your game.

511
00:35:30,189 --> 00:35:33,911
At the end of the day, it's still a game and it has to be engaging and fun to the player.

512
00:35:34,271 --> 00:35:37,952
You want the players to stop and think, but you still want them to go back and keep playing

513
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:38,513
afterwards.

514
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,514
And I think that's something that's still a little bit missing from social impact or

515
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:47,216
educational games, which focus a little bit too much on the teaching and not enough about

516
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,857
enjoyment of the player.

517
00:35:48,877 --> 00:35:53,259
And I feel that's finally changing a little bit in the recent years, but it's something

518
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:56,140
to keep in mind when you're trying to spread a message of awareness.

519
00:35:57,717 --> 00:36:07,386
So how do we achieve that in our game? Well, first of all, we start with an attractive art style and compelling story just to immediately draw player in, create a sense of mood and kind of stand out a little bit from other indie games.

520
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:15,073
A lot of the effects are accelerated and they're exaggerated because, again, it's a video game and not everybody wants to spend 50 hours.

521
00:36:15,693 --> 00:36:21,679
And because it's also a game, it's a little bit assumed that, hey, things are probably going to move a little bit at an unrealistic pace.

522
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:24,961
And also, even though some people said the game moves too fast...

523
00:36:26,136 --> 00:36:31,520
Personally, I like it is also another layer of commentary about the pace of media these days.

524
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:37,324
How one day a tweet goes viral, the next day everyone is retweeting it, then the next day

525
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:44,750
it's already on CNN and NBC and Fox News and the pace of information and internet outrage is just

526
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:51,214
unprecedented nowadays. So I do like how the game kind of mirrors that even though it's even more

527
00:36:51,274 --> 00:36:51,655
extreme.

528
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,201
We added little nuggets of joy in the games.

529
00:36:55,301 --> 00:36:57,262
Things like you have your apartment, you can decorate it,

530
00:36:57,502 --> 00:36:59,724
or you can adopt a dog, and you can feed it treats,

531
00:36:59,904 --> 00:37:03,005
you can play with it, and every day it gives you little nuggets of wisdom.

532
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:06,867
And it's not something that even really has an effect on the gameplay,

533
00:37:07,128 --> 00:37:11,350
but it's a cool little something there that people can kind of feel relaxed in

534
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,471
after all the stress and watching all those things unfold.

535
00:37:13,491 --> 00:37:17,453
There's a little bit of a breather room and something just nice to have and enjoy

536
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:19,895
that's maybe not even relevant to the main game.

537
00:37:21,176 --> 00:37:24,998
So the last thing is adding a bit of unintended consequences.

538
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:28,821
We don't, we didn't want the game to be entirely predictable and deterministic.

539
00:37:29,021 --> 00:37:31,543
Every now and then we want to throw the player a little bit of a curve ball, a

540
00:37:31,563 --> 00:37:35,005
little bit of a plot twist, just to keep it more engaging, kind of keep them on

541
00:37:35,025 --> 00:37:40,028
their toes and make it more fun also for replaying when, you know, there's maybe

542
00:37:40,068 --> 00:37:41,109
different things could happen.

543
00:37:42,647 --> 00:37:47,148
So that wraps up all the pillars and our constraints, but before I finish this talk,

544
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:52,190
let me talk about a few things that we tried that didn't quite work. Maybe it's a cautionary tale,

545
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:56,571
or maybe it's something that you could try to make work in your game. So first of all,

546
00:37:56,591 --> 00:38:01,493
the spouse you hate. In the original Headliner, you go through the sequence of choosing news

547
00:38:01,553 --> 00:38:05,294
articles, you walk and watch the city change, and at the end of the day, you sit down with your

548
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:10,135
family, your spouse and your daughter, and you have a dinner. You chat, you talk about the day,

549
00:38:10,195 --> 00:38:11,395
and what's going on in their life.

550
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:15,475
So with the original design, your spouse was basically...

551
00:38:15,495 --> 00:38:17,497
kind of the devil's advocate.

552
00:38:17,777 --> 00:38:20,841
Whatever you published, she would always share opposite viewpoints,

553
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:22,923
she would try to change your mind.

554
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:26,147
But the effect was that a lot of players came out feeling like,

555
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:29,170
yeah, my spouse is really mean.

556
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,714
They're never supportive of anything I do, they're always disagreeing with me.

557
00:38:33,524 --> 00:38:37,285
And that was really clashing with the purpose of having the sequence and you caring about those

558
00:38:37,305 --> 00:38:42,167
characters when you always felt like they were attacking you. So we, in the end, we ended up

559
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:48,009
rewriting the spouse so that she has a firmer stance, they have their own idea on issues that

560
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:53,670
they always stick to, no matter what you choose. But also they are a bit more understanding and

561
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,892
supportive, so they may disagree with you, but they're still going to be there for you and be

562
00:38:57,952 --> 00:38:58,892
like, well, I trust you.

563
00:39:00,863 --> 00:39:04,864
Another example of a thing that didn't quite work out is having little influence indicators

564
00:39:05,665 --> 00:39:10,526
on some articles. We wanted to show how those articles would affect certain issues such as

565
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:16,268
nationalism, healthcare, and show you how the public would react to it. The problem with that

566
00:39:16,308 --> 00:39:21,190
was that Eddicorn Headliner is a narrative experience. It's about a story, it's about

567
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:25,631
the characters, it's about making the world feel real. It's not about numbers, it's not

568
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:27,552
min-maxing resource management.

569
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:33,134
So having those kind of indicators kind of gamified the game a little bit more than we wanted to,

570
00:39:33,254 --> 00:39:35,214
and ultimately we ended up removing that.

571
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:39,096
However, it's something that we actually brought back in subsequent playthroughs,

572
00:39:39,696 --> 00:39:42,056
as I mentioned about adding content when you replay the game,

573
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:45,317
because at that point players sort of experienced the story,

574
00:39:45,337 --> 00:39:46,618
they've experienced the characters,

575
00:39:47,058 --> 00:39:50,839
so I thought it was kind of a nice treat to give them a little bit of a glimpse behind the scenes

576
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,800
and maybe let them game the system a little bit at this point if they wanted to.

577
00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:01,234
And I still think that's maybe an interesting idea for a different kind of a game that is more numbers driven.

578
00:40:01,575 --> 00:40:03,837
And there is a whole different commentary you could make about,

579
00:40:03,877 --> 00:40:07,340
hey, the content of the article doesn't matter as long as we get the numbers.

580
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,404
Which is sort of what we're seeing with a lot of mobile game ads nowadays

581
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:17,468
that don't look like the actual games that they are leading to, but that's another whole topic.

582
00:40:18,451 --> 00:40:30,735
Moving on to randomization, initially we wanted the game to be much more procedural, a little bit like ADDs around the world, or Reigns, where the storyline is more dynamic, it's different every time.

583
00:40:31,815 --> 00:40:38,417
The problem with that is when you have random events happening, it's really hard to create a sense of a story arc.

584
00:40:39,277 --> 00:40:47,840
So when players played the early alpha, they felt like they just kinda jumped in the middle of things, random things would happen, and then the game would end.

585
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:53,276
and there was no start, there was no beginning, there was no real sense of progression

586
00:40:53,296 --> 00:40:59,041
and it was harder for us to spread that message without having a clear story arc.

587
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:03,984
So we ended up scrapping a lot of that randomization in favor of just traditional story.

588
00:41:04,365 --> 00:41:08,227
But we still left some elements of randomization, so maybe there's some events that

589
00:41:08,748 --> 00:41:13,311
may happen, may not happen, on a much smaller scale that aren't plot critical.

590
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:18,894
or maybe there's stuff that will happen on 60-minute playthroughs that hasn't happened on the first playthrough now,

591
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:20,855
again, adding to the replay value.

592
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:24,036
I still love that idea of creating something more procedural,

593
00:41:24,116 --> 00:41:28,258
but just something that we didn't have time or funding to keep iterating over,

594
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:32,060
and it was just a safer bet to go back to linear storytelling for

595
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,282
achieving our goal of teaching players about all this media manipulation stuff.

596
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:41,083
And lastly, it's honestly been hard to keep up with reality at times.

597
00:41:41,363 --> 00:41:45,928
There's been a few cases where we would write a scenario, or a plotline, or an event,

598
00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:49,432
and then a few months later we would basically watch it play out in real life.

599
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:51,914
And we were initially criticized when the game released that,

600
00:41:52,014 --> 00:41:55,178
oh this game is too dark, it's unrealistic, this would never happen in real life.

601
00:41:55,877 --> 00:41:59,098
And then it happened in real life several months later.

602
00:41:59,218 --> 00:42:02,099
And we were like, well, this was not meant to be a guide.

603
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:03,239
That was really weird.

604
00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:06,900
And ultimately, whenever you're trying to make a commentary about real world

605
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,782
events or make a satire, it may be difficult to do it properly

606
00:42:10,882 --> 00:42:13,923
when the world is getting crazier and crazier by the day.

607
00:42:14,043 --> 00:42:16,783
And some of the things you thought were extreme are no longer extreme.

608
00:42:17,944 --> 00:42:21,145
So in summary, I think games can be a powerful medium

609
00:42:21,185 --> 00:42:24,066
for sharing ideas and organically broadening horizons.

610
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:31,015
Simple balanced trade-offs can force players into difficult moral decisions that maybe make them question their own beliefs.

611
00:42:31,595 --> 00:42:37,279
I think it's important to make players draw their own conclusions rather than talking at them and

612
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:43,204
let just players fall under their own biases. Let them do horrible things and let them see the repercussions.

613
00:42:43,744 --> 00:42:50,309
Because video games being interactive are the only medium that can make someone go, oh my god, what have I done?

614
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,951
Myself, what have my actions caused?

615
00:42:53,589 --> 00:42:57,210
And I think that's a very powerful feeling to make you stop and introspect.

616
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:01,211
And that's something that only games can truly achieve.

617
00:43:02,452 --> 00:43:05,932
And I think this model can be applied to so many more issues that are relevant today.

618
00:43:06,373 --> 00:43:08,013
Amazon warehouse working conditions.

619
00:43:08,093 --> 00:43:11,814
We've actually made a short little game about that called Fulfillment.

620
00:43:12,374 --> 00:43:13,174
Look it up on Steam.

621
00:43:14,095 --> 00:43:17,216
We could talk about deforestation, pollution, environmentalism.

622
00:43:17,616 --> 00:43:20,917
We could talk about automation effects on jobs in the coming years, healthcare costs.

623
00:43:21,527 --> 00:43:28,151
anti-government protests, riots, trade wars, the ongoing pandemic, online privacy, propagation of

624
00:43:28,191 --> 00:43:32,554
misinformation on social networks, which is something that I'm sort of prototyping right now,

625
00:43:33,154 --> 00:43:37,977
addictiveness of games, addictiveness of social media, online harassment, trolling, doxing.

626
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:43,160
There's so many topics that I think we can help people.

627
00:43:44,032 --> 00:43:49,175
get a better understanding of and maybe be less toxic and less aggressive towards one another

628
00:43:49,195 --> 00:43:54,860
in online discussion if we can help them organically see the other side and get a bigger picture.

629
00:43:55,823 --> 00:44:00,905
And that about wraps up all my talk. I hope the points were useful. I hope you feel a little bit

630
00:44:00,945 --> 00:44:07,487
inspired. And normally I would ask if you have any questions, but since this is a digital version,

631
00:44:07,507 --> 00:44:11,868
then just feel free to tweet at me either at Unbound Creation, which is our studio,

632
00:44:11,988 --> 00:44:15,709
or directly at me at Kubazor. All the information is here right now.

633
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:20,514
Let's connect if you just want to bounce ideas or maybe you're working on something like this

634
00:44:20,674 --> 00:44:23,316
Or maybe you have some commentary about how we could have done something better

635
00:44:24,077 --> 00:44:29,122
Just ping me. Let's chat. You know next time we're at an event. Let's meet up again

636
00:44:29,182 --> 00:44:32,025
Thank you for listening to my talk and I hope you got something out of it. Bye
