00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,613
Hello and welcome to The Calm in the Storm, an introvert's guide to success.

2
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:15,295
I am Joshua Huber, rigging specialist at Vicarious Visions.

3
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:22,159
I've been in the industry for about 13 years with my last five at Vicarious Visions.

4
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:25,041
And I started my career back in 2008 as a rigging intern.

5
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:30,424
And at the time, the studio I was with about a month into the internship

6
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:33,786
notified me that they were also opening a full time rigging role.

7
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:39,790
and that I was doing a great job and they were interested in having me fill that role.

8
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,993
And about a month later, we had a one-on-one to update my progress.

9
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:49,358
And it was brought to my attention then at that time, after evaluating me for the past month,

10
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:51,920
they were also going to explore external options.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,485
And to kind of paraphrase what I was told, you know, my lead said, we love your work.

12
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:01,600
the team's getting along with you, you're doing everything right,

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,661
but you just don't seem energetic and enthusiastic about what you're doing.

14
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:12,243
And this absolutely shocked me, you know, fresh out of school in Los Angeles,

15
00:01:12,243 --> 00:01:17,524
kind of living the life, and on top of that, doing what I dreamed of doing my entire life,

16
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:23,625
you know, making video games. And here's someone telling me that I'm not enjoying what I'm doing.

17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,445
And this really took me back, and I kind of had to step out of my comfort zone and overemphasize,

18
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:36,730
you know, my emotions. And I remember pointing at my face and I said, this is my happy face,

19
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:42,555
this is my sad face, this is my angry face. It's just the way I am. My family, you know,

20
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:46,998
still doesn't understand this, and they've known me my whole life. So I don't expect you to

21
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:52,222
understand it. But you need to know that I'm really enjoying this job, and I would love for

22
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:53,443
it to be a full-time thing.

23
00:01:54,757 --> 00:01:59,200
And for the remainder of my internship, I made an effort to try and externalize

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,864
those emotions. And that's a feat that doesn't come easily when it's not in your nature.

25
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:09,508
And I liken this to the idea of something like the Lakers and LeBron James. You know,

26
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:14,871
if they kind of told him, you know, listen, LeBron, you're scoring 40 points a game.

27
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:20,675
You won the MVP last year. We won the championship because of you. But you just don't seem like

28
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:24,078
you're having fun playing basketball. So we're going to have to let you go.

29
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:29,316
And these stories are important because what I was basically being told was,

30
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:33,718
you just aren't outgoing enough, so we can't invest in you.

31
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:39,722
And this is scary because our society is comprised of one third to one half of introverts.

32
00:02:39,722 --> 00:02:43,284
And we can assume that number is even higher in our industry,

33
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:45,546
given that creatives tend to be more introverted.

34
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:51,865
Yet because of the traits our culture has deemed as successful and rewarding,

35
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:55,626
we've essentially internalized the bias against being introverted.

36
00:02:55,626 --> 00:03:02,127
As you can see from my Myers-Briggs score, I'm a decidedly introverted person.

37
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:08,449
And I've wrestled with being an introvert throughout my entire career in the games industry,

38
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:13,650
from hoping my work would speak for itself because I'm awful at self-promotion,

39
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,191
but then at times feeling like I never got the proper credit.

40
00:03:16,787 --> 00:03:21,688
to leaving meetings with things that went unsaid because I couldn't interject among the more

41
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:27,410
outspoken, to focus issues when casual conversations break out near my desk,

42
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:32,131
to struggling with understanding why I was being perceived in certain ways,

43
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:38,233
or why my success felt hindered. I've always just accepted it as a fact that I was different

44
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,894
and that I would need to change my ways in response.

45
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:46,194
It wasn't until reading this book, Quiet, by Susan Cain,

46
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:49,435
that I started to realize that as an introvert,

47
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:52,076
I'm not in the small minority, that I'm not

48
00:03:52,076 --> 00:03:54,737
wrong for being an introvert, and that there's

49
00:03:54,737 --> 00:03:57,579
far more to the solution than me needing to be

50
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:00,540
a completely different person.

51
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,442
So in this talk, we'll discuss what is an introvert,

52
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:07,863
why our culture is set up to put introverts at a disadvantage,

53
00:04:07,863 --> 00:04:12,665
what the consequences of this bias against introverts are,

54
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,802
and how we can learn to be more inclusive of introverts.

55
00:04:17,802 --> 00:04:21,503
But before we start to share the learnings from Quiet,

56
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:24,144
I'd like to make a few disclaimers.

57
00:04:24,144 --> 00:04:27,826
First, I'm obviously a game developer who read a book.

58
00:04:27,826 --> 00:04:31,228
I'm in no way a behavioral or social scientist.

59
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:33,429
This is not my area of expertise.

60
00:04:33,429 --> 00:04:36,190
This is simply me sharing the information

61
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,351
that I found useful from the book Quiet,

62
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:41,312
interspersed with my experiences of being

63
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:43,033
an introvert in the games industry.

64
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:50,019
Secondly, and this should obviously go without saying, but I love my job and I love Vicarious

65
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:55,963
Visions. When I wrote the proposal for this talk, I ran it past one of the writers in our studio

66
00:04:55,963 --> 00:05:01,727
and he sent it back with some edits and then he followed up with a few questions. He asked me,

67
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:05,970
are you okay? Do you like it here? And are we treating you fairly?

68
00:05:06,612 --> 00:05:13,094
And while I'm fairly certain he was joking, it's not uncommon for introverts to be misinterpreted

69
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:15,814
due to their lack of emotion and straightforwardness.

70
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:23,816
It should also go without saying that this talk is in no way meant as a slight to extroverts.

71
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:28,317
I will be pointing out many advantages to being introverted and even pointing out

72
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:33,078
some flaws of being extroverted, but that's not to say we should all become introverted.

73
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:38,486
Both personalities bring their own unique advantages and disadvantages,

74
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:43,667
and it's how we use them in tandem that's the key takeaway.

75
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:50,070
The most common and agreed upon way to distinguish an introvert is that it's someone

76
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,731
who prefers and operates better in environments that are lower stimulation.

77
00:05:54,731 --> 00:06:01,013
And while we most often associate stimulation with social situations,

78
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:05,292
It's important to note that anything can be a stimulus,

79
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:09,273
from background noise to caffeine intake to light levels.

80
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:13,775
Studies have even shown that introverts salivate more

81
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:17,716
when lemon juice is placed on their tongue because they're responding more

82
00:06:17,716 --> 00:06:20,817
to that stimulus.

83
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:24,918
If we were to visualize this in a graph, we'd see our introverts represented by

84
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,140
the green line and our extroverts represented by the

85
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,480
red line.

86
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:37,520
where the y-axis represents our level of response and our x-axis represents our level of stimulation.

87
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,544
Introverts and extroverts both reach the same optimal level of response,

88
00:06:42,544 --> 00:06:45,987
but it happens at a far lower level of stimulation for introverts.

89
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:54,135
And I found a great analogy for introverts and extroverts. It likened introverts to a cell phone.

90
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:57,899
There's an external initiation that's required.

91
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:59,801
You know, you think your cell phone,

92
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:02,283
it's generally in kind of a sleep mode,

93
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:04,384
and it doesn't turn on unless you press a button

94
00:07:04,384 --> 00:07:07,687
to activate it or someone texts or calls you.

95
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:09,188
Introverts are much the same way.

96
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:12,210
Both introverts and cell phones

97
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,011
have their energy from within.

98
00:07:14,011 --> 00:07:18,935
And the more interaction you use with that cell phone

99
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:20,096
or with that introvert,

100
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:22,718
the more it uses up that internal energy.

101
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:27,413
And when the battery is low, it requires a recharge.

102
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,594
And if you think about the places where

103
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:34,115
you recharge your phone, generally you plug it in,

104
00:07:34,115 --> 00:07:36,196
put it on the charger, and just kind of set it off

105
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:39,277
and let it be by itself while it charges back up.

106
00:07:39,277 --> 00:07:41,517
That's how introverts prefer to recharge too,

107
00:07:41,517 --> 00:07:43,318
with that same amount of seclusion.

108
00:07:43,318 --> 00:07:47,940
Extroverts, on the other hand, are solar panels.

109
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:51,733
They get their energy from an external source.

110
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:55,976
Solar panels getting it from the sun, extroverts getting it from other people

111
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,137
or from the other external stimuli.

112
00:07:58,137 --> 00:08:00,999
And they can't make their own energy.

113
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:05,801
And once they get their energy, they always give it right back.

114
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:09,183
Solar panels give it back to the house or to the power grid.

115
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:11,445
Extroverts give it back to other people immediately.

116
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:16,908
Running through some other traits of introverts and extroverts.

117
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:21,246
Introverts like to reflect before making decisions.

118
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:24,628
When forced to make quick decisions, multitask,

119
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:28,050
or handle information overload, extroverts actually

120
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,672
perform better because introverts spend

121
00:08:30,672 --> 00:08:33,994
too much time thinking and being overwhelmed by that stimulus.

122
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:37,857
Introverts also like to listen more,

123
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:39,918
and they enjoy one-on-one conversation.

124
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,001
It's very important to note that introverts have been proven

125
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:45,822
to not necessarily talk less.

126
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:50,335
They just prefer deeper, more intimate conversations

127
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:52,595
and can become bored easily by small talk.

128
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:58,057
When discussing introversion, it's also important to note that shyness

129
00:08:58,057 --> 00:09:02,898
and introversion are not the same thing. The shy person is not talking because of

130
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:06,860
a fear of social disapproval, while the introvert is not talking

131
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,920
because of a preference for that quiet environment.

132
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,022
Introverts also tend to be more introspective,

133
00:09:14,022 --> 00:09:14,942
more self-aware.

134
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:20,168
They think before they act and they learn through observation,

135
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:22,849
which is a trait that's known as paying alert attention.

136
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:26,992
And this is when you observe a social situation

137
00:09:26,992 --> 00:09:29,333
and you learn all the rules before you're

138
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,034
comfortable joining in.

139
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:35,857
And just before quarantine, an example of this, my son,

140
00:09:35,857 --> 00:09:37,898
my five-year-old son, who I also think

141
00:09:37,898 --> 00:09:40,279
is introverted like I am, I took him

142
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,021
to a classmate's birthday party at a karate dojo.

143
00:09:43,677 --> 00:09:48,281
And immediately, almost all the kids jumped right on the mats,

144
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:51,664
started kicking and jumping and chopping and doing all the activities.

145
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:57,150
And my son was content, was sitting next to me just watching for the majority of the party.

146
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,654
But once he felt comfortable, he learned all those rules

147
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:06,078
and understood what he was going to be doing. He jumped right in and he had a great time.

148
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:11,752
Einstein was a well-known introvert, and he once said,

149
00:10:11,752 --> 00:10:13,773
it's not that I'm so smart.

150
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:16,095
It's just that I stay with problems longer.

151
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:18,356
And persistence is a trait that's

152
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:20,678
been proven to be stronger in introverts.

153
00:10:20,678 --> 00:10:24,821
It's also been proven that introverts perform better

154
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:27,023
on critical thinking tests.

155
00:10:27,023 --> 00:10:29,905
In a study asking Japanese and American students

156
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:30,665
to solve puzzles.

157
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,913
resulted in the Japanese students spending more than five minutes more on the puzzle before quitting

158
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:42,115
than their American counterparts. And the study attributed this to the strong introverted

159
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:51,899
tendencies of the Far East cultures. Introverts also exude less emotion and energy.

160
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:57,361
This is because they prefer to be in those lower stimulation environments,

161
00:10:57,361 --> 00:11:00,743
and it's also their way to communicate their preferences to other people.

162
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,538
This is a dangerous trait of introverts, though,

163
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,460
because it generally results in them seeming aloof,

164
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,144
uninterested, unfriendly, and oblivious of others.

165
00:11:12,144 --> 00:11:15,226
However, if used properly, this can be a huge strength

166
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:16,627
of introverts.

167
00:11:16,627 --> 00:11:20,010
In regulating their feelings, it results in a very even-keeled

168
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,571
personality.

169
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:23,933
And if we go back to my internship story

170
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,375
at the beginning of the talk, as we

171
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,157
moved to the end of the internship,

172
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:30,779
we entered a really heavy crunch period for the project

173
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:31,540
we were finishing.

174
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:36,688
And I was right there in the trenches putting in 70,

175
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:39,390
80 hours a week with all the industry veterans.

176
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,571
And what started as a negativity,

177
00:11:41,571 --> 00:11:46,414
my introverted lack of emotion, it turned into a huge positive

178
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,215
because of my ability to remain calm and collected

179
00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:50,736
under that extreme stress level.

180
00:11:50,736 --> 00:11:53,377
And this is the trait, I think, that

181
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:57,700
helps secure the job for me and turn it into a full-time role.

182
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,102
And it's also something that has since positively shown on me

183
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:01,942
throughout my career.

184
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:07,161
It's also important to remember that the introvert, extrovert

185
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,022
type is a spectrum.

186
00:12:09,022 --> 00:12:11,144
Rarely is anyone 100% of either type.

187
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:15,326
As I've grown older, I've felt my type shift more introverted.

188
00:12:15,326 --> 00:12:19,389
And you can also adjust your type for given situations.

189
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:23,272
However, it's believed that you cannot ultimately change

190
00:12:23,272 --> 00:12:25,353
from one type to the other.

191
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:28,075
And numerous studies have proven that being introverted

192
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:31,277
or extroverted is inherent to who we are when we are born.

193
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:35,745
According to some scientists, the traits are in our DNA.

194
00:12:35,745 --> 00:12:42,527
A study that followed babies through childhood successfully predicted the introverts based on

195
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:49,009
their reaction to stimuli at the age of just four months. The introverted babies were labeled as

196
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:55,111
high reactive due to their extreme reactions to stimuli, while the extroverted babies showed

197
00:12:55,111 --> 00:13:00,853
little to no reaction. This happens due to how our bodies process dopamine.

198
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:06,884
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter known for causing pleasure and motivation in the brain.

199
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:12,787
Extroverts have a low sensitivity to dopamine, so they require much larger quantities of it

200
00:13:12,787 --> 00:13:17,569
to reach the same level of pleasure that an introvert does.

201
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:23,392
Studies have also shown that Western cultures have evolved to be more extroverted.

202
00:13:23,392 --> 00:13:27,534
This is believed to be because they descended from migrants who were

203
00:13:27,534 --> 00:13:30,556
required to be more social in their explorations.

204
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:35,404
In addition, around the turn of the 20th century,

205
00:13:35,404 --> 00:13:38,987
America specifically began to view introversion as a problem.

206
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:42,550
It was at this time that we saw the rise of the businessman,

207
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,453
and we shifted our focus into sales and marketing.

208
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:48,475
And in the process, we began to push

209
00:13:48,475 --> 00:13:53,079
the traits perceived for success in those positions.

210
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,862
In her book, Quiet, Susan Cain refers to this

211
00:13:55,862 --> 00:13:57,323
as the extrovert ideal.

212
00:13:57,855 --> 00:14:03,620
which is the widespread belief that the ideal self is gregarious, alpha, and comfortable in the spotlight.

213
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:14,769
And you can see from this ad in the 1950s, we're not only advertising it as a problem if you're

214
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:20,614
introverted, but we're also starting to prescribe drugs to try to help you change.

215
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:23,756
And this extrovert ideal is even corroborated by science.

216
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:32,468
Numerous studies have found that people who speak more often, more loudly, and faster are rated as

217
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:39,294
smarter, better looking, more interesting, and more desirable as friends. And a well-known

218
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:45,739
study from UC Berkeley found that television pundits, whose job it is to make predictions,

219
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:48,941
often make worse predictions than they would by random choice.

220
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:52,492
And the ones who were wrong the most often

221
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:55,934
were not only the loudest, but also the most successful.

222
00:14:55,934 --> 00:15:00,436
So for more than 100 years now, our country

223
00:15:00,436 --> 00:15:03,758
has been cultivating this idea that to be successful,

224
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:04,939
you need to be extroverted.

225
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:09,601
And this has now become an accepted norm in our society.

226
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:11,362
Being an introvert is viewed negatively,

227
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:13,763
and we are taught that introverts

228
00:15:13,763 --> 00:15:15,064
need to correct their ways.

229
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:19,495
For any of you who are introverted,

230
00:15:19,495 --> 00:15:21,636
this report card likely causes flashbacks.

231
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:27,177
Nearly all A's except for that dreaded class participation grade,

232
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:31,878
and a comment that always references being too quiet or too shy.

233
00:15:31,878 --> 00:15:34,799
The fact that class participation even merits

234
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,240
its own grade is a reinforcement of this extrovert ideal.

235
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,601
This ideal follows us all the way from this early age in

236
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:45,662
the classroom through to adulthood in the workplace.

237
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:55,136
where extrovert ideals like open office floor plans and large group meetings can inhibit an introvert.

238
00:15:55,136 --> 00:16:00,322
Franz Kafka, a well-known introvert and famous writer, once said,

239
00:16:00,322 --> 00:16:03,346
you once said that you would like to sit beside me while I write.

240
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:06,570
Listen, in that case, I could not write at all.

241
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:10,954
And his statement here, a famous writer saying,

242
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:13,596
I won't be able to write if you're next to me,

243
00:16:13,596 --> 00:16:17,440
is a reinforcement that, while open office floor plans have

244
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,523
merit for both cost savings and visual appeal,

245
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:23,305
countless studies have found them

246
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:26,808
to be far less productive than the collaborative environment

247
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:27,949
that they sell themselves as.

248
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:33,510
In one famous experiment, introverts and extroverts

249
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,593
were asked to solve a puzzle while wearing headphones that

250
00:16:36,593 --> 00:16:38,454
played random noise.

251
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:42,596
They were asked to adjust the volume to their comfort level.

252
00:16:42,596 --> 00:16:45,839
Introverts chose a level that was approximately 20 decibels

253
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,960
lower than the extroverts.

254
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,842
And at the chosen levels, both types performed equally.

255
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:54,224
But when the levels were swapped,

256
00:16:54,224 --> 00:16:56,726
both underperformed by about 32%.

257
00:16:57,304 --> 00:17:04,749
the extroverts because they were under-stimulated, and the introverts because they were over-stimulated.

258
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:10,313
And in another study, known as the Coding War Games, the goal was to find the best computer

259
00:17:10,313 --> 00:17:17,438
programmers. And what the study revealed was that salary, job level, and even years of experience

260
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:23,222
did not influence the results. The best performers all came from within the same companies.

261
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:30,598
And it was at these companies that the employees were given the most privacy, freedom, and least interruptions.

262
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:40,550
And the important thing to remember here with both of these studies is that, you know, extroverts obviously require more stimulation and introverts require less.

263
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:44,929
it's always easier to add more stimulation

264
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,570
than it is to take away stimulation.

265
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,490
You know, if you're in a noisy workplace,

266
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,051
you can't take that noise away easily.

267
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:54,671
But if you're in a quiet workplace,

268
00:17:54,671 --> 00:18:00,572
you can always add that to your own suitability.

269
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:02,313
So if we go to our ultra hip

270
00:18:02,313 --> 00:18:04,093
and collaborative open workspace here,

271
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:06,734
and we keep in mind our earlier look

272
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:08,734
at optimal stimulation levels.

273
00:18:09,293 --> 00:18:13,656
We have a few groups to the left who may be working or just chatting.

274
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:18,079
They're likely introverts and they're in their optimal stimulation level.

275
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,261
Over in the corner, though, we have our introverts trying to focus,

276
00:18:21,261 --> 00:18:26,324
unable to operate efficiently, possibly even operate at all

277
00:18:26,324 --> 00:18:31,247
because of the overstimulation of the workplace.

278
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:34,789
And even if the open office plan was successful in its quest

279
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:36,010
to promote collaboration.

280
00:18:36,644 --> 00:18:43,229
There can be the added danger of collaboration through group activities.

281
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:47,612
A study at the University of Minnesota proved that more ideas and higher

282
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:51,554
quality ideas were produced when everyone worked alone versus in a group.

283
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:57,178
And numerous other studies have shown that performance gets worse as group size

284
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:01,782
increases. The first reason for this is known as social loafing.

285
00:19:02,452 --> 00:19:06,516
which says in a group, some individuals tend to sit back

286
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:08,177
and let others do the work.

287
00:19:08,177 --> 00:19:12,481
And this is where most of our introverts will fall.

288
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:14,943
In this case, it's not that they're purposefully sitting

289
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:16,564
back and letting others do the work,

290
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:18,766
but it's that they're overstimulated

291
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:21,248
by the large group, and it's prohibiting them

292
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:23,410
from participating.

293
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,892
And another blocker for introverts here,

294
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:28,375
and this is something that happens quite often for me,

295
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,592
is that as introverts, we tend to think far more deeply about ideas,

296
00:19:32,592 --> 00:19:37,755
which makes coming up with ideas or answers on the fly very prohibitive.

297
00:19:37,755 --> 00:19:42,458
And it's not uncommon for me in a meeting to latch on to one concept or

298
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:46,180
question or idea, and I drill so deeply into that one that

299
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,302
I miss a large part of the rest of the meeting because of that.

300
00:19:53,478 --> 00:19:58,602
Production blocking is another failure of group meetings, and this says only one person can talk

301
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:03,886
or produce an idea at once, while the other group members are forced to sit and listen passively.

302
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:11,992
And the Abilene Paradox is an anecdote which reaffirms a failure of group meetings.

303
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:16,996
And the paradox goes like this. There's a family, they're sitting on their porch

304
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:19,198
in a town called Coleman, Texas.

305
00:20:19,763 --> 00:20:24,204
and they're playing dominoes and the father-in-law thinks everyone is bored.

306
00:20:24,204 --> 00:20:27,405
So he suggests that they take a 50-mile drive

307
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:30,466
to Abilene, Texas, which is the next town over, to have dinner.

308
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:34,828
And no one wants to go, they're all having a nice time doing what they're

309
00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:37,969
doing, but the first person agrees because they

310
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:42,070
think the father-in-law wants to go. And then sequentially each other person

311
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,411
agrees because the previous person agreed.

312
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:49,292
And upon returning, each family member says how much they hated the trip.

313
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:57,455
and the father-in-law says he only brought it up because he thought everyone else was bored.

314
00:20:57,455 --> 00:21:00,556
And this is just kind of a reaffirmation of, you know,

315
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:06,518
the tendency of us to follow anyone who initiates an action regardless if we agree or not.

316
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:11,114
And if you all think to any brainstormings or meetings that you've probably had,

317
00:21:11,114 --> 00:21:16,759
you can probably come up with at least one instance where somebody makes a suggestion

318
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:23,366
and your immediate thought is, whoa, this is way out of scope, or this doesn't make sense for the

319
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:28,451
game that we're making, or that's just not going to work. But the rest of the group immediately

320
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:32,135
agrees with it. And it's because of this Abilene paradox that that can happen.

321
00:21:34,523 --> 00:21:40,087
Another pitfall to group brainstorms is what's coined by scientist Gregory Burns as the pain

322
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:46,930
of independence. A study by Burns revealed that participants playing a game gave a wrong answer

323
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:53,634
only 14% of the time. But when they played that same game in a group setting and were asked the

324
00:21:53,634 --> 00:22:00,178
same questions, they agreed with unanimously incorrect answers over 40% of the time.

325
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,909
An evaluation of the study revealed

326
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:07,570
that those who were conforming to the incorrect answers

327
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,271
showed less activity in the region of the brain that

328
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:13,772
makes decisions and more activity in the region

329
00:22:13,772 --> 00:22:16,273
associated with perception.

330
00:22:16,273 --> 00:22:20,314
So all of this to say that you can actually perceive problems

331
00:22:20,314 --> 00:22:23,115
and therefore give answers differently

332
00:22:23,115 --> 00:22:25,976
if you're presented with falsities in a group.

333
00:22:25,976 --> 00:22:28,057
So peer pressure is actually changing

334
00:22:28,057 --> 00:22:29,858
how your brain views problems.

335
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:34,666
to enable you to agree with an incorrect answer.

336
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:39,027
So as we can see, group activities are inefficient in several ways,

337
00:22:39,027 --> 00:22:42,487
but most notably they present several hurdles for introvert

338
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:47,748
participation and inclusion. This can also have an unintended deeper

339
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:52,389
consequence though. Since introverts tend to be less vocal

340
00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:56,290
in group settings, it can affect how or even if they are

341
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,331
perceived by others in relation to career growth.

342
00:23:04,024 --> 00:23:09,708
Mark Twain once told a story about a man who scoured the planet looking for the greatest general who ever lived.

343
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:19,936
When the man was informed that the person he sought had already died and gone to heaven, he made a trip to the pearly gates to look for him.

344
00:23:19,936 --> 00:23:24,359
And St. Peter pointed at a regular looking Joe.

345
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:27,322
That isn't the greatest of all generals, protested the man.

346
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:32,065
I knew that person when he lived on Earth, and he was just a measly cobbler.

347
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:36,828
I know that, said St. Peter, but if he had been a general,

348
00:23:36,828 --> 00:23:39,309
he would have been the greatest general of them all.

349
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:43,630
And I can relate to this because for the first 10 years

350
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,631
of my career, I was steadfast in my belief

351
00:23:46,631 --> 00:23:48,751
that I did not want to be a lead.

352
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:51,632
And to add to that, was never approached by others

353
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:53,793
to become one.

354
00:23:53,793 --> 00:23:56,313
When I arrived at VV, the rigging department

355
00:23:56,313 --> 00:23:59,474
was under the TechArt group, which at the time made sense

356
00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:00,595
and was working well.

357
00:24:01,572 --> 00:24:03,534
But when the studio moved to working on Destiny,

358
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:07,316
the tech art group shifted under the engineering umbrella,

359
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:10,438
which made sense for most of the tech art group

360
00:24:10,438 --> 00:24:12,740
and how we interacted with Bungie,

361
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,961
but it left rigging in an awkward position

362
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:16,002
of being under a group

363
00:24:16,002 --> 00:24:17,863
that didn't make the most sense for us.

364
00:24:17,863 --> 00:24:21,386
It was at this point that I saw the rigging group

365
00:24:21,386 --> 00:24:23,187
was being limited in its potential,

366
00:24:23,187 --> 00:24:25,208
and I wanted to push the team

367
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:27,910
in its own independent direction.

368
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,611
My desire to push the boundaries

369
00:24:29,611 --> 00:24:31,232
of what the rigging team could do.

370
00:24:31,716 --> 00:24:37,118
and lead the team as I best saw fit, became something I really cared about,

371
00:24:37,118 --> 00:24:41,080
and it enabled me to step outside of my comfort zone as an introvert.

372
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:48,604
Free Trait Theory, developed by psychologist Brian Little, says that we are all born with

373
00:24:48,604 --> 00:24:54,606
certain personality traits, but we can and do act out of character in the pursuit of what

374
00:24:54,606 --> 00:24:56,647
he calls core personal projects.

375
00:24:57,923 --> 00:25:03,926
Using free trade theory, introverts can push themselves to be more extroverted in certain

376
00:25:03,926 --> 00:25:11,210
situations. And while my use of free trade theory to develop the rigging department and become the

377
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:17,154
rigging lead has worked out great for not only my career, but also my team and VV as a whole,

378
00:25:17,154 --> 00:25:23,537
we need to be mindful of our cobbler friends, those introverts who aren't able to push themselves

379
00:25:23,537 --> 00:25:25,738
outside of their comfort zone on their own.

380
00:25:26,385 --> 00:25:29,988
because they could be lost opportunities for other great leaders.

381
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:36,493
One of my biggest misconceptions about being in a leadership role

382
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,995
was the idea of managing.

383
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:42,358
As an introvert, I dreaded the thought of taking on less work,

384
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:46,442
telling people what to do, dealing with conflict

385
00:25:46,442 --> 00:25:49,685
and the other bureaucracies that I thought being a lead entailed.

386
00:25:49,685 --> 00:25:53,928
What came naturally to me, though, was exactly what propelled me

387
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:54,849
into the lead role.

388
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:59,409
the desire to lead my department in a direction that would be better for us,

389
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:06,854
our games, and our studio. And thankfully, I set a path that my team wanted to follow.

390
00:26:06,854 --> 00:26:13,118
I've learned that a great lead uses their passion to evoke, empower, and mentor others.

391
00:26:13,118 --> 00:26:20,703
In his book, Good to Great, Jim Collins identifies five levels of leadership.

392
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:28,982
At the highest level possible, the level five leader practices great humility, strong will,

393
00:26:28,982 --> 00:26:35,004
a ferocious resolve, and the tendency to give credit to others. All of these are traits that

394
00:26:35,004 --> 00:26:40,126
are inherent to introverts, so it should only seem natural that introverts can be the most

395
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:41,607
successful leaders.

396
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,853
In one study, measuring the success of introverts as leaders,

397
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:51,395
they analyzed data on the success of pizza chains

398
00:26:51,395 --> 00:26:53,516
managed by the differing personality types.

399
00:26:53,516 --> 00:27:00,200
They found 16% higher profits when the teams were led by extroverts,

400
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,722
but only when the employees were passive types.

401
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:07,705
On the other hand, there were 30% higher profits when teams were led by

402
00:27:07,705 --> 00:27:11,767
introverts if the employees were actively engaged

403
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:13,448
in improving work procedures.

404
00:27:14,914 --> 00:27:20,339
And in another study that simulated leading teams of shirt folders for retail stores,

405
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:26,404
it was found that introverted leaders were perceived as more open and receptive to ideas.

406
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:31,208
And this resulted in higher motivation and better performance.

407
00:27:31,952 --> 00:27:35,053
And this is one area where I think I've really excelled

408
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,054
as an introverted lead.

409
00:27:37,054 --> 00:27:39,015
In reviews from my team reports, it's

410
00:27:39,015 --> 00:27:41,956
often cited how they appreciate my ability

411
00:27:41,956 --> 00:27:43,917
to point them in certain directions,

412
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:46,438
whether it's solving problems, coming up

413
00:27:46,438 --> 00:27:49,899
with studio initiatives, generating or accomplishing

414
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:51,020
goals.

415
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:55,481
Yet I don't explicitly tell them what to do or how to do it.

416
00:27:55,481 --> 00:27:58,583
I make suggestions based on my experiences.

417
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:04,781
And then I allow them the space to explore and find the answers for themselves,

418
00:28:04,781 --> 00:28:07,483
which helps them to learn and grow in their careers.

419
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:16,769
And these are all important studies and anecdotes because currently 95% of leaders identify

420
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:21,873
themselves as extroverts. And more importantly, in another informal study,

421
00:28:22,638 --> 00:28:29,820
65% of senior management actually said they identify introversion as a liability.

422
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:38,902
So we can see here, it's neither uncommon for potential leaders to be overlooked because of their quiet and humble demeanors,

423
00:28:38,902 --> 00:28:42,843
nor for introverts to assume themselves not fit for leadership,

424
00:28:42,843 --> 00:28:47,844
despite the fact that introverts are inherently set up to be great leaders.

425
00:28:49,982 --> 00:28:56,548
Over the past nearly year and a half now, we've been all navigating this unique landscape that is COVID and working from home.

426
00:28:56,548 --> 00:29:00,152
So it's also worth discussing how that impacts introverts.

427
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:09,521
If you Google introvert and quarantine or introvert from working from home, you get this whole slew of hilarious memes that kind of

428
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:14,747
you know, depict that this is the moment introverts have been waiting for their whole life.

429
00:29:14,747 --> 00:29:21,374
We're all at home, alone, having these, you know, great parties by ourselves. And while that might

430
00:29:21,374 --> 00:29:26,499
be true for some people, it's important to remember that introverts still need balance,

431
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:28,861
and not all of us are getting that proper balance.

432
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:34,554
Take myself for example, working from home, lots of Zoom meetings all day.

433
00:29:34,554 --> 00:29:38,276
And then as soon as I'm done working, my family gets home.

434
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:43,500
I have two rambunctious young boys who I love, but it's a lot of high energy.

435
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:51,284
So all the stimulation of Zoom meetings followed quickly by the stimulation of rambunctious loud children.

436
00:29:51,284 --> 00:29:55,847
And that goes pretty much from the moment I wake up till the moment I go to bed.

437
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:02,072
So not all of us introverts are getting that balance, that alone time that we need

438
00:30:02,072 --> 00:30:05,334
that, you know, make the quarantine as successful as people think.

439
00:30:05,334 --> 00:30:09,995
Another thing to remember is that introverts think a lot.

440
00:30:09,995 --> 00:30:13,497
There was a test of 1,000 American adults recently,

441
00:30:13,497 --> 00:30:17,258
and it tested how much COVID has negatively impacted their mental health.

442
00:30:17,258 --> 00:30:21,940
And they found that those who tested higher as extroverts

443
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,501
also tested better on mental health during quarantine.

444
00:30:25,195 --> 00:30:30,958
And they believe this is because introverts are thinking so much about the ramifications of COVID.

445
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:35,401
You know, what happens if I get this? What happens if my family gets this?

446
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:40,924
Am I doing a good job working from home and balancing homeschooling with my kids?

447
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:44,186
All these things are constantly running through an introvert's mind,

448
00:30:44,186 --> 00:30:48,328
while extroverts can more easily shrug these things off and keep plowing ahead.

449
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:55,336
Something else that came up that really stuck out to me, we have an Art Leads meeting about once a

450
00:30:55,336 --> 00:31:02,362
month where the leads of each art department get together. We discuss, you know, studio happenings,

451
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:07,788
team health, how we're doing, things like that. And it was the first meeting we had

452
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:12,232
after working from home started and we kind of went around and did a,

453
00:31:12,232 --> 00:31:15,335
you know, how is everyone doing, checking in, how are your teams doing.

454
00:31:16,035 --> 00:31:18,717
And someone said, don't forget your extrovert friends.

455
00:31:18,717 --> 00:31:20,298
They're really hurting right now.

456
00:31:20,298 --> 00:31:23,861
And this really stuck out to me because I

457
00:31:23,861 --> 00:31:25,922
liken extroverts working from home

458
00:31:25,922 --> 00:31:28,164
to introverts in the workplace.

459
00:31:28,164 --> 00:31:32,067
In both cases, we're in more unnatural environments for us.

460
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:35,069
Extroverts at home because they're understimulated,

461
00:31:35,069 --> 00:31:39,072
introverts in the workplace because they're overstimulated.

462
00:31:39,072 --> 00:31:41,013
And we want to think the same way we're

463
00:31:41,013 --> 00:31:43,655
thinking about extroverts now and saying,

464
00:31:43,655 --> 00:31:45,416
don't forget your extrovert friends.

465
00:31:46,035 --> 00:31:49,416
We want to be mindful that when we get back to our studios,

466
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:52,057
we also want to be thinking about our introvert friends.

467
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:56,779
And the last thing to remember is that we all still

468
00:31:56,779 --> 00:31:58,839
need to recharge.

469
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:01,100
Introverts, if you're overstimulated by family

470
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,361
and working from home, you need to find that alone time

471
00:32:04,361 --> 00:32:05,401
somehow.

472
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:09,623
Extroverts, if you need to get that extra social stimulation,

473
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:11,683
you need to find a way to do that too.

474
00:32:13,802 --> 00:32:19,906
When working from home, it's also important to discuss Zoom and its impact on introverts.

475
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:23,568
First, Zoom magnifies the meeting failures that we identified earlier.

476
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:28,091
It can make it even harder for introverts to interject their thoughts.

477
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:36,716
It's also been proven that Zoom fatigue is real. There's a lot of energy that's spent interpreting

478
00:32:36,716 --> 00:32:43,480
the unnatural socialization of Zoom. All the excessive up-close eye contact is unnatural.

479
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,883
There's more energy spent interpreting because there's a lack of body language

480
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:52,625
and the reduced mobility of trying to keep your body still to stay on camera.

481
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:58,989
To help combat this, you should work to limit your daily meeting quantity.

482
00:32:58,989 --> 00:33:03,052
And if that's not possible, you should work to make some of your meetings audio only

483
00:33:03,052 --> 00:33:07,155
so that you're not getting the fatigue of all these visual cues.

484
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:11,929
It's also unnatural to see yourself as you speak.

485
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:13,531
And when you see yourself, you tend

486
00:33:13,531 --> 00:33:14,692
to be more critical of yourself.

487
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:18,575
So you're spending a lot of energy criticizing yourself,

488
00:33:18,575 --> 00:33:19,956
which is further taxing you.

489
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,079
So you should work to hide yourself view during meetings.

490
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:27,523
And you should always question if this really needs

491
00:33:27,523 --> 00:33:30,525
to be a Zoom meeting or not, and if it doesn't explore

492
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:32,827
alternate feedback avenues.

493
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:37,011
Our studio has recently started to use a program called Miro.

494
00:33:37,603 --> 00:33:43,708
And this is kind of a real-time whiteboard editing program that everyone can edit a page at the same time.

495
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:52,253
And the advantage of this is we'll have Zoom in the background, audio only, and someone will kind of be a moderator of the meeting.

496
00:33:52,253 --> 00:33:58,378
But we're all able to give our opinions and our feedback at the same time on this Miro page.

497
00:33:58,378 --> 00:34:02,340
And we don't have a lot of the meeting failures and the fatigue associated with Zoom.

498
00:34:04,465 --> 00:34:16,412
It's also important to keep in mind that while virtual social functions can help to maintain your overall team bonding and studio dynamics, these can be very difficult on introverts.

499
00:34:16,412 --> 00:34:21,854
And we should start to think quality over quantity with our social function meetings.

500
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:34,001
Smaller meetups that rotate around shared interests or creative ideas can be a great way to get introverts to nourish their deeper connections and be more involved with our virtual social functions.

501
00:34:35,244 --> 00:34:40,950
And this is something that as an introverted lead, I've really struggled with since working from home,

502
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:47,236
finding ways to keep my team's social bonding going, but also do it in an environment that's

503
00:34:47,236 --> 00:34:52,261
suitable for my introverted tendencies. And one thing I came up with was something we did,

504
00:34:52,261 --> 00:34:57,786
which was called a rigging jam. And we basically put pencils down on production for a week.

505
00:34:57,786 --> 00:34:59,128
We got approval for this.

506
00:34:59,774 --> 00:35:04,616
And we took that week to work on personal projects.

507
00:35:04,616 --> 00:35:09,058
And the Friday before, we each pitched an idea to the group.

508
00:35:09,058 --> 00:35:10,959
And, you know, we talked about the idea.

509
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:14,521
We worked out kind of a rough outline of what we were going to do.

510
00:35:14,521 --> 00:35:19,303
And then for the week, we would have a morning check-in with each other,

511
00:35:19,303 --> 00:35:22,525
how our progress is happening.

512
00:35:22,525 --> 00:35:24,926
We would answer any questions or things that were stuck on.

513
00:35:24,926 --> 00:35:28,007
And then we would spend the day working on that project.

514
00:35:28,563 --> 00:35:30,864
And at the end of the week, we each presented our project.

515
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:34,667
And, you know, this just became a fun way for the team.

516
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:37,929
It encouraged the team bonding, but it also was that,

517
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:42,832
you know, unique, deeper connection that appeals to introverts and appealed to me.

518
00:35:42,832 --> 00:35:49,416
And throughout my career, I've also learned to do many things

519
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:51,757
to help my introverted tendencies.

520
00:35:51,757 --> 00:35:55,159
The first thing I do is to take advantage of my environment.

521
00:35:55,805 --> 00:36:01,128
I've made myself an early bird at the studio and even working from home I like to start early.

522
00:36:01,128 --> 00:36:05,811
And it's not unheard of for me to have days where I'm more productive in the one to two hours that

523
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:10,533
I'm alone in the studio in the morning than I am for the rest of the day because I'm filled

524
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:17,557
with meetings and other distractions. So find the time that your environment is most conducive to

525
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:23,240
your preferences and you know adjust your hours accordingly to make best suit of those needs.

526
00:36:24,813 --> 00:36:27,674
And an interesting fact here in relation to working early

527
00:36:27,674 --> 00:36:30,055
is that introverts have actually been

528
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:33,455
proven to work better with lower levels of sleep.

529
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:35,956
And this is because lacking sleep

530
00:36:35,956 --> 00:36:39,157
makes us less alert, less active, and less energetic.

531
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:43,178
So a sleep-deprived person is less aroused, which works

532
00:36:43,178 --> 00:36:44,478
better for the introvert.

533
00:36:44,478 --> 00:36:48,419
Another thing I like to do is prepare for my meetings

534
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:49,599
ahead of time.

535
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:55,678
Gather your key points of the meeting or your brainstorm session in advance and think them over

536
00:36:55,678 --> 00:37:00,519
so you have your questions and thoughts ready. This allows you to absorb your materials,

537
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:06,581
generate your questions, and explore deeply, and it prevents you from making those connections

538
00:37:06,581 --> 00:37:13,184
during the meeting and missing other key points of the meeting. And because you feel more prepared,

539
00:37:13,184 --> 00:37:18,225
it will also make you, it'll make it easier for you to share your ideas.

540
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:22,438
And I liken this to how we approach job candidate interviews.

541
00:37:22,438 --> 00:37:27,761
You know, I hope we never really go into an interview with a job candidate

542
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:31,043
and we haven't at least reviewed their resume or their demo reel

543
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:33,885
or a test that they prepared for us,

544
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:37,968
you know, and generated questions that are specific to that candidate

545
00:37:37,968 --> 00:37:40,410
and their work and how they'll fit into the studio.

546
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:44,913
So much the same way I like to prepare for my job interviews.

547
00:37:44,913 --> 00:37:47,074
I also like to prepare for all my meetings.

548
00:37:49,024 --> 00:37:51,365
You should also always follow up after the fact

549
00:37:51,365 --> 00:37:54,246
and make sure your thoughts are getting across,

550
00:37:54,246 --> 00:37:56,446
even if it's not in the moment.

551
00:37:56,446 --> 00:37:59,047
We discuss the different ways that group meetings

552
00:37:59,047 --> 00:38:01,808
can cause introverts to be less successful

553
00:38:01,808 --> 00:38:03,348
in terms of sharing all their ideas.

554
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:07,149
So don't feel just because the meeting is over

555
00:38:07,149 --> 00:38:09,150
that the topic is closed.

556
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,851
It's not uncommon for me to marinate on ideas

557
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:13,771
that are presented in meetings

558
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:15,132
and bring them up with the person

559
00:38:15,132 --> 00:38:16,592
who is hosting the meeting later on.

560
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:21,167
And when it comes to this, use any format that's comfortable

561
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:23,389
and relays your thoughts the best.

562
00:38:23,389 --> 00:38:25,710
Don't feel like you need to wait for another meeting

563
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,031
when you may have the same issues interjecting

564
00:38:28,031 --> 00:38:29,552
your thoughts.

565
00:38:29,552 --> 00:38:33,475
Feel free to use anything like Slack or email, whatever

566
00:38:33,475 --> 00:38:34,835
is most comfortable for you.

567
00:38:34,835 --> 00:38:38,818
You should also ask thoughtful questions.

568
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:41,940
This one's really important because it

569
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,160
serves multiple purposes.

570
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:48,834
By verbalizing the thoughtful questions that are running through your mind as an introvert,

571
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:51,736
it can help to get extroverts thinking more about their ideas.

572
00:38:51,736 --> 00:38:58,021
It can also extend your period of thinking out an idea during a meeting because others

573
00:38:58,021 --> 00:39:02,484
are now discussing that question you asked rather than continuing to a new idea.

574
00:39:02,484 --> 00:39:08,007
Thoughtful questions can also redirect a group when we're getting sidetracked,

575
00:39:08,007 --> 00:39:10,369
and it can help to maintain focus.

576
00:39:11,704 --> 00:39:14,847
And asking questions also deflects energy.

577
00:39:14,847 --> 00:39:16,708
In asking a question, you're getting others

578
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:20,751
to do the thought, the thinking, and the talking on your behalf.

579
00:39:20,751 --> 00:39:24,134
But in essence, you're getting the credit for the conversation.

580
00:39:24,134 --> 00:39:28,197
Because you asked that question and initiated the conversation,

581
00:39:28,197 --> 00:39:30,318
even if others are discussing the question

582
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:32,920
and you're not doing a lot of the talking,

583
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,902
it's giving you the credit.

584
00:39:34,902 --> 00:39:36,843
And in her book, Quiet, Susan Cain

585
00:39:36,843 --> 00:39:39,686
tells a story about an introverted man who

586
00:39:39,686 --> 00:39:40,907
loves to host parties.

587
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:45,395
And this seems counterintuitive, but it kind of makes sense.

588
00:39:45,395 --> 00:39:49,418
The reason he loves to host the parties rather than attending parties

589
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:52,060
is because when he's hosting a party,

590
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:56,022
you know, he can kind of be his introverted self and get caught up

591
00:39:56,022 --> 00:39:59,024
in doing things that hosts do, cooking food,

592
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:01,566
you know, putting food out, getting drinks for people.

593
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:05,749
And he doesn't necessarily have to be a social butterfly.

594
00:40:05,749 --> 00:40:08,250
But if his party is viewed as a big success.

595
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,262
even if he's not a social butterfly, he's viewed as a big success.

596
00:40:12,262 --> 00:40:19,925
And this is something that really hit home to me. I realized that I love to do the same thing.

597
00:40:19,925 --> 00:40:23,887
And, you know, this reminded me of an instance. We had a party a while back

598
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:29,050
and friends of friends came and it was the first time we had ever met them.

599
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,791
And, you know, they got to the party and we introduced each other.

600
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:35,993
But other than that, I don't really remember talking to them at all throughout the night.

601
00:40:36,855 --> 00:40:40,338
And we met up with our friends a few weeks later.

602
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:44,041
And, you know, they said, Oh, our friends loved you guys so much.

603
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,583
They really want to hang out with you again.

604
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:47,924
They thought you were so much fun.

605
00:40:47,924 --> 00:40:51,907
And, you know, I thought this was really funny because I remember

606
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,649
not talking to them at all during the party.

607
00:40:54,649 --> 00:40:57,952
So like, you know, I kind of question how would they know how much fun we are?

608
00:40:57,952 --> 00:40:59,913
We didn't even really talk to them.

609
00:40:59,913 --> 00:41:01,815
But it's the same idea.

610
00:41:01,815 --> 00:41:04,177
You know, they they saw us.

611
00:41:05,357 --> 00:41:09,379
hosting a great party, and that gave us the spotlight,

612
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:11,540
even though we were more introverted

613
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:16,442
and weren't necessarily social butterflies at the party.

614
00:41:16,442 --> 00:41:18,242
Another thing to do is just say no.

615
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,543
We've learned that introverts can

616
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:23,284
become overstimulated easier.

617
00:41:23,284 --> 00:41:27,266
So as such, we shouldn't participate in every activity.

618
00:41:27,266 --> 00:41:29,246
So don't feel guilty if you don't participate.

619
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:35,013
This is something that's really hard, though, because you want to be present in every group activity.

620
00:41:35,013 --> 00:41:40,796
You know, you feel like otherwise you're missing out on opportunities to bond with your team,

621
00:41:40,796 --> 00:41:46,398
you know, represent your work, or push ideas. So you have to find balance and be wise about

622
00:41:46,398 --> 00:41:50,860
which activities you're partaking in so you can make the best out of the ones you do attend.

623
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:57,803
Another thing to do is always suggest more fruitful and less draining alternatives.

624
00:41:58,357 --> 00:42:03,098
So, you know, if you decline a full team social lunch outing, because you might not gain much

625
00:42:03,098 --> 00:42:09,200
from that outing, maybe in response, offer a one-on-one lunch to a member of that group

626
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,061
who's a more important member, where you can have more fruitful conversations.

627
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:19,423
You should also try to find a champion for your work.

628
00:42:19,423 --> 00:42:22,843
This is one that I've learned to lean on a lot recently.

629
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:31,377
As I mentioned earlier, one of my reluctancies to becoming a lead was the perceived need to make myself more extroverted.

630
00:42:31,377 --> 00:42:36,459
And thankfully, my lead complements my personality by being more extroverted.

631
00:42:36,459 --> 00:42:42,600
So I'm able to talk to him in a one-on-one basis and share my ideas and my goals and my accomplishments.

632
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,482
And then he does the external sales and promoting for me.

633
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:50,603
So I'm relying on his personality to complement mine.

634
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:57,610
This helps to limit my exposure to large group environments, which are harder for introverts.

635
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:05,594
And since introverts also prefer more in-depth, intimate conversations, having a strong

636
00:43:05,594 --> 00:43:11,458
relationship with him allows me to stay in my comfort zone, and it allows me to rely less

637
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:16,741
on self-promotion, because now he's doing all the promoting to others for me.

638
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:24,622
You want to make sure you trust your champion and you're paired with someone who you're comfortable talking to,

639
00:43:24,622 --> 00:43:27,623
and who you also know will go to bat for you.

640
00:43:27,623 --> 00:43:33,185
And it's important to note here that, you know, in not every circumstance, this might be your lead.

641
00:43:33,185 --> 00:43:37,587
And, you know, if you think that your lead is not the champion for your work,

642
00:43:37,587 --> 00:43:40,828
make sure you find someone else in the studio who can be.

643
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:47,450
I have several other people in our studio, too, who I rely on for this much the same way that I rely on my lead for it.

644
00:43:50,563 --> 00:43:53,326
And since introverts thrive on less stimulation,

645
00:43:53,326 --> 00:43:57,509
you always want to find ways to keep that stimulation balanced

646
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,710
and take notes of the things that you

647
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:03,473
do that you notice are putting you in your comfort zone.

648
00:44:03,473 --> 00:44:07,276
Headphones are an obvious one as an introvert.

649
00:44:07,276 --> 00:44:09,457
I even find sometimes I'll put the headphones

650
00:44:09,457 --> 00:44:12,700
on to cancel out external noise, and I don't even

651
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,062
play anything in the headphones, but also

652
00:44:16,062 --> 00:44:18,804
be on the lookout for other unsuspecting filters.

653
00:44:19,473 --> 00:44:22,814
I'm known around the studio for always having my hood up,

654
00:44:22,814 --> 00:44:24,915
and it's not uncommon if my hood is down

655
00:44:24,915 --> 00:44:26,995
and I'm walking down the hallway,

656
00:44:26,995 --> 00:44:30,516
someone will jokingly say that they don't recognize me.

657
00:44:30,516 --> 00:44:33,657
And it was upon analyzing introverts and myself

658
00:44:33,657 --> 00:44:35,858
that I realized I was putting that hood up

659
00:44:35,858 --> 00:44:37,638
to filter out noise and distraction

660
00:44:37,638 --> 00:44:40,199
and limit the amount of input I was taking.

661
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:44,000
And just remember, if you've put yourself

662
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,140
into those extroverted situations,

663
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,121
you always want to remember to recharge when you need it.

664
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:57,334
On the studio level, while not directly intended to benefit introverts,

665
00:44:57,334 --> 00:45:01,256
we've done several things that can help you learn more about introverts and extroverts.

666
00:45:01,256 --> 00:45:07,620
Within about your first year at VV, everyone goes through DISC training.

667
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:11,262
If you're not familiar with DISC, it's essentially a personality

668
00:45:11,262 --> 00:45:14,884
test that charts out your demeanor and your working style.

669
00:45:15,907 --> 00:45:20,570
And once you have those results, the training teaches you about your personality

670
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:24,273
and how to effectively work and communicate with other personalities.

671
00:45:24,273 --> 00:45:31,638
And while the DISC training doesn't explicitly categorize people as introverted or extroverted,

672
00:45:31,638 --> 00:45:36,422
if you have some awareness of introverts and extroverts, you can use the DISC tools

673
00:45:36,422 --> 00:45:40,725
to help extract those results to the introvert-extrovert relationship.

674
00:45:43,002 --> 00:45:47,304
We also did a course known as Active Listening Training.

675
00:45:47,304 --> 00:45:48,704
And the course revolved around how

676
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:52,086
to be a better listener when people are talking to you

677
00:45:52,086 --> 00:45:53,847
and an aim to teach us how to be more

678
00:45:53,847 --> 00:45:55,348
present in a conversation.

679
00:45:55,348 --> 00:45:59,070
And this is of special importance to introverts

680
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,591
because introverts tend to be more out of tune

681
00:46:01,591 --> 00:46:05,693
with a conversation because they're constantly thinking,

682
00:46:05,693 --> 00:46:08,354
constantly asking questions, and constantly

683
00:46:08,354 --> 00:46:11,296
trying to solve the problems of the person who is talking.

684
00:46:11,773 --> 00:46:15,855
rather than listening to what they're saying.

685
00:46:15,855 --> 00:46:19,796
Recently, the art team at VV has also made an active effort to promote

686
00:46:19,796 --> 00:46:24,098
professional development time. This program allows artists about two

687
00:46:24,098 --> 00:46:27,959
hours a week to focus on core personal projects,

688
00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:32,960
research and development, tutorials, or other areas of interest.

689
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,422
We even block this time out in Outlook so that people aren't interrupted during

690
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:40,143
that time and so they can't be booked with other meetings.

691
00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:46,703
Google is notorious for the idea of something called 20% time,

692
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:49,926
which in theory allows their employees 20% of their time

693
00:46:49,926 --> 00:46:52,949
dedicated to new idea development.

694
00:46:52,949 --> 00:46:57,173
And the thinking is that the best ideas come

695
00:46:57,173 --> 00:46:59,655
when creative people aren't explicitly being

696
00:46:59,655 --> 00:47:01,316
managed or forced to work.

697
00:47:01,316 --> 00:47:04,880
And we're hoping to capture that same idea

698
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,802
by allowing artists the creative free time once a week

699
00:47:07,802 --> 00:47:08,283
to do this.

700
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,694
There are also many ways that extroverts can help.

701
00:47:12,694 --> 00:47:16,537
The first thing you can do is pre-warm your meetings

702
00:47:16,537 --> 00:47:19,839
by providing more context, questions, and insight

703
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,640
in advance of a meeting.

704
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,702
This can help introverts to better prepare

705
00:47:23,702 --> 00:47:26,184
for those meetings ahead of time.

706
00:47:26,184 --> 00:47:29,306
And recently, I got a meeting request

707
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:31,628
that was just called boss rigging questions.

708
00:47:31,628 --> 00:47:35,971
And there was no context within the meeting to it.

709
00:47:35,971 --> 00:47:36,512
That was it.

710
00:47:37,017 --> 00:47:39,198
And I had no idea what this meeting was about.

711
00:47:39,198 --> 00:47:42,880
And I spent a lot of time and energy trying to figure this out.

712
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,882
You know, which bosses does this apply to?

713
00:47:44,882 --> 00:47:46,803
We're working on several bosses right now.

714
00:47:46,803 --> 00:47:49,124
What are the rigging questions?

715
00:47:49,124 --> 00:47:53,367
So, you know, just by providing some of that context,

716
00:47:53,367 --> 00:47:57,250
you're not only helping introverts prepare more and be better

717
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,932
prepared to share ideas in the meeting, but you're also reducing

718
00:48:00,932 --> 00:48:05,115
the amount of energy that they're spending over thinking things in advance.

719
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:08,933
Another idea is the five-second rule.

720
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:12,936
And this idea says that if there's that awkward silence

721
00:48:12,936 --> 00:48:15,318
when one person finishes their thought,

722
00:48:15,318 --> 00:48:18,300
to give it five seconds and let it breathe,

723
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,663
and make sure that no one else has anything to say,

724
00:48:21,663 --> 00:48:25,085
and make sure that you're saying the proper thing after that.

725
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:28,468
There's a tendency of extroverts to fill in silences

726
00:48:28,468 --> 00:48:32,070
immediately, even if they're not saying something that will

727
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,772
advance the conversation properly.

728
00:48:34,573 --> 00:48:41,719
So the idea here is to just give it that moment to breathe so introverts have time to think and to speak their mind if they're ready.

729
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:53,589
Another thing you can do is call on the quiet. This is one you want to be careful of because people don't necessarily always love to be put on the spot.

730
00:48:53,589 --> 00:49:02,837
This is also another one where body language can be a big cue. People often, you know, give body language cues when they're ready to speak.

731
00:49:03,446 --> 00:49:06,388
If you notice someone looks like they're ready to speak,

732
00:49:06,388 --> 00:49:07,349
but they're not able to interject

733
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:10,552
their thoughts because others are speaking,

734
00:49:10,552 --> 00:49:12,453
feel free to call on them.

735
00:49:12,453 --> 00:49:14,855
Just make sure you're doing it in a manner

736
00:49:14,855 --> 00:49:18,057
that doesn't make them feel pressured to give an answer,

737
00:49:18,057 --> 00:49:20,179
and give them the space that it's okay

738
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:22,281
if they don't have an answer ready,

739
00:49:22,281 --> 00:49:26,524
that they don't need to give one.

740
00:49:26,524 --> 00:49:28,426
Activision on the whole has also

741
00:49:28,426 --> 00:49:31,268
instituted a new thing called No Meeting Fridays.

742
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:36,707
This just gives us a full day to not have the burden of meetings,

743
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:39,949
to focus on our work, and to not have those distractions.

744
00:49:39,949 --> 00:49:45,292
I have heard of people taking it even further with no talk days.

745
00:49:45,292 --> 00:49:48,935
It seems pretty optimistic and utopian in my idea,

746
00:49:48,935 --> 00:49:51,336
but that could be another thing you strive for.

747
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:57,286
We should also work to minimize multitasking.

748
00:49:57,286 --> 00:50:00,789
Keep introverts deep and focus on their one task

749
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:04,412
since we know that introverts are not great at multitasking.

750
00:50:04,412 --> 00:50:07,775
So if you're aware of someone who's working on a particular task and your

751
00:50:07,775 --> 00:50:11,478
need isn't urgent, just give them that extra alone time to

752
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:13,219
wrap up their current train of thought.

753
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:19,969
As we've seen, introverts and extroverts both bring their own unique qualities and flaws,

754
00:50:19,969 --> 00:50:25,192
so we should work to mix our personalities to make better use of our differences.

755
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:31,634
Our best success is going to be leveraging the powers of both introverts and extroverts.

756
00:50:31,634 --> 00:50:38,718
And as we work to shine a spotlight on promoting equity and inclusion in our industry,

757
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:44,980
We should be mindful that inclusion is not only relevant to the visually apparent categories

758
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:51,646
like race, gender, and sexuality. Our society has been conditioned to believe that we should

759
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:57,953
all be extroverted, and as such we have created a subconscious bias against introverts,

760
00:50:57,953 --> 00:51:01,597
even though upwards of one half of our society is introverted.

761
00:51:02,614 --> 00:51:05,376
And in our industry, it's especially important

762
00:51:05,376 --> 00:51:08,819
to be mindful of this bias, as the number of introverts

763
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:11,701
is likely even higher.

764
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,983
Introverts carry many positive traits

765
00:51:13,983 --> 00:51:15,845
from which we can benefit, and we

766
00:51:15,845 --> 00:51:19,087
should work to utilize them to help balance

767
00:51:19,087 --> 00:51:21,449
our teams and our processes.

768
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:24,071
If we continue to not be fully mindful of them,

769
00:51:24,071 --> 00:51:27,454
we stand not to use our teams to their full potential.

770
00:51:27,454 --> 00:51:30,857
I'd like to thank you for taking the time

775
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:48,422
or if your studio has done any initiatives to benefit introverts.

776
00:51:48,422 --> 00:51:50,022
I'd love to hear about that.

777
00:51:50,022 --> 00:51:53,284
And if you're not here in the live chat, please feel free to email me.
