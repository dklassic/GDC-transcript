1
00:00:06,287 --> 00:00:08,709
Good morning.

2
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:12,852
Welcome to the Rules for Development of People.

3
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:15,474
You had a lot of other cool places and choices

4
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:18,177
to be here this morning.

5
00:00:18,976 --> 00:00:22,358
In fact, in bed, sleeping is probably among them,

6
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:24,499
given that last night was St. Patrick's Day.

7
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:28,380
So I'm very glad that you all picked this room and this talk.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,022
Thank you very much for being here.

9
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:33,523
I am super jazzed about the opportunity

10
00:00:33,523 --> 00:00:36,204
to share with you some of the ideas

11
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:40,646
that we are thinking about around how Blizzard is trying

12
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:43,748
to be more deliberate about the development

13
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:45,108
and the betterment of their people.

14
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:49,619
I am super curious about all of you, though.

15
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:52,540
So if I could just get a show of hands.

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,060
Production.

17
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,041
How many produce?

18
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:55,621
OK.

19
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:55,961
Nice.

20
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:58,282
Art?

21
00:00:58,282 --> 00:00:58,322
OK.

22
00:00:58,322 --> 00:00:58,522
Just one.

23
00:00:58,522 --> 00:00:58,722
Just you.

24
00:00:58,722 --> 00:00:58,802
Nice.

25
00:00:58,802 --> 00:01:00,963
Way to represent.

26
00:01:00,963 --> 00:01:01,923
Design?

27
00:01:01,923 --> 00:01:02,603
OK.

28
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:03,103
Well done.

29
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:06,304
All right.

30
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,505
And engineering?

31
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:08,545
OK.

32
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:08,665
Cool.

33
00:01:08,665 --> 00:01:09,525
Businessy type folks?

34
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:09,565
OK.

35
00:01:17,258 --> 00:01:18,780
And I know HR is in the house.

36
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,203
I got a little support team there.

37
00:01:21,203 --> 00:01:22,224
Yeah, you.

38
00:01:22,224 --> 00:01:23,325
You too.

39
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:26,109
Yeah, we rule.

40
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:30,534
And then how many of you are leads within your own studios?

41
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:31,095
OK, cool.

42
00:01:31,095 --> 00:01:32,016
That would be helpful.

43
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:33,978
So I craft this.

44
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:38,206
All right, so I'm Julie Farbanek.

45
00:01:38,206 --> 00:01:41,028
A little bit about me.

46
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:44,350
This is me in game.

47
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:44,930
Come say hi.

48
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,652
I'm in the goblin starting zone.

49
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:50,233
For whatever reason, when I first started at Blizzard,

50
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:52,735
Farbanek was really hard to say.

51
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:56,010
So, Fabernacle became really easy to say.

52
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,091
I don't know why.

53
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:59,193
So, that's me.

54
00:01:59,193 --> 00:02:00,735
And a couple other things to share,

55
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:03,638
just so you know a little bit more about me.

56
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:06,662
The first thing I'll start out with is,

57
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:08,283
I feel like Buffy the Vampire Slayer

58
00:02:08,283 --> 00:02:10,926
is one of the best television shows ever.

59
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:13,549
It's even superior than Firefly.

60
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,550
Yeah, I said it.

61
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,570
I said it.

62
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,591
And I mean it.

63
00:02:17,591 --> 00:02:19,391
And in the wrap-up room, wherever that is,

64
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:20,191
I don't even know where that is.

65
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:21,212
I didn't ask.

66
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:24,393
We'll discuss the merits if you want to after this.

67
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:29,494
I am a self-described leadership development nerd.

68
00:02:29,494 --> 00:02:30,154
I dig it.

69
00:02:30,154 --> 00:02:33,735
I enjoy working with our leaders at Blizzard,

70
00:02:33,735 --> 00:02:35,536
helping them be better.

71
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:37,016
I read lots of books on it.

72
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:39,717
I got my master's in organizational leadership.

73
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:40,857
It's my thing.

74
00:02:40,857 --> 00:02:42,378
And you might notice some of that.

75
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:48,206
influence sprinkled throughout this talk, so just fair warning to you. I've been in

76
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:51,911
HR for 15 years and I've been lucky enough to have been at Blizzard

77
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:55,656
Entertainment for the past eight years. Eight this month.

78
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,211
Get my shield in two years.

79
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:05,492
And so when I started at Blizzard,

80
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:07,533
my focus was learning and development.

81
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:09,093
So I built a lot of training programs

82
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:11,454
and did a lot of teaching and worked

83
00:03:11,454 --> 00:03:13,715
with a lot of teams across the studio

84
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:17,616
to help them kind of work better together.

85
00:03:17,616 --> 00:03:21,698
And now I'm responsible for all the HR activities

86
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:23,559
for three of our franchises.

87
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:25,619
Diablo, right?

88
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:25,859
Yes.

89
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:26,560
Yeah.

90
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,900
Hearthstone?

91
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,748
Yeah, that's it, right?

92
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:32,551
And Overwatch.

93
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:35,961
So fantastic.

94
00:03:35,961 --> 00:03:39,683
And so speaking of that, I have spent the last four years

95
00:03:39,683 --> 00:03:41,924
embedded with the Overwatch team.

96
00:03:41,924 --> 00:03:44,505
That means that I sit with the team,

97
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:48,407
but it is a lot more than geography.

98
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:49,828
I'm in the production stand-ups.

99
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,308
I'm in the production team meetings,

100
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:53,309
engineering leads meetings, art leads meetings.

101
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:57,431
I sit on our steering team, which as the term suggests,

102
00:03:57,431 --> 00:04:00,613
it's our game director and our exec producer

103
00:04:00,613 --> 00:04:03,034
and our art director and our tech director and business guy.

104
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:03,795
We all kind of.

105
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:08,278
work together to shape and steer the direction of the group.

106
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:11,360
And we talk about things like schedule a lot,

107
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,923
launch plans right now are a big topic of conversation,

108
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,566
build stability, just the health of the team.

109
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:21,728
And I share all of that with you just

110
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,908
so you have a sense of.

111
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:26,731
my experience and the perspective that I'm gonna bring

112
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:30,893
to this talk, and also to highlight that all the examples

113
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:33,574
that I wanna share with you are all things

114
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,056
that are happening inside the dev team.

115
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:38,457
These are not things like we're sending people off to go do,

116
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:43,319
they're magically different, and then they come back,

117
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,260
and no, and so I thought that was important to mention.

118
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,523
Okay, so what inspired the ideas behind this talk?

119
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:58,830
It's this quote from this really awesome book by Ed Catmull called Creativity, Inc.

120
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,333
If you have not read it, add it to your reading list.

121
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:07,536
It's â€“ there are a lot of similarities between how Pixar approaches their creative process

122
00:05:07,536 --> 00:05:10,618
and then how we make games, so it's fabulous.

123
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:14,162
And this quote, getting the right people

124
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:16,384
and the right chemistry is more important

125
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:17,705
than getting the right idea,

126
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:21,469
this really resonated with a lot of us at Blizzard

127
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:23,471
because we talk about that a lot.

128
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:26,374
We don't say it as articulately and eloquently

129
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:28,757
as Ed Catmull did.

130
00:05:28,757 --> 00:05:31,599
We say things like, making games is easy

131
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:32,981
compared to making a team.

132
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:37,144
And I am not at all suggesting, by the way,

133
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:38,045
that making games is easy.

134
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:42,228
You know, it's really, really, really hard.

135
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:44,369
But when you compare it to building a team,

136
00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:47,891
a team that has an abundance of trust,

137
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:51,574
that has healthy conflict, that has

138
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:54,896
a lot of passionate developers all rowing

139
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,678
the boat in the same direction, and that

140
00:05:59,204 --> 00:06:04,949
right balance between the creative ideas and the ability to execute on those ideas,

141
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:10,454
that mixture, that's a really hard thing to find.

142
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:14,898
And I'm sure a lot of you can attest that if you've been on teams,

143
00:06:14,898 --> 00:06:21,523
maybe where there's poor communication or weak leadership or minimal collaboration and teamwork,

144
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:26,067
you would say that yes, the absence of those core things

145
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:29,189
really hurts how the team functions,

146
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:33,032
and ultimately, what we believe at Blizzard,

147
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:36,375
ultimately hurts the quality of the game.

148
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,136
And so, because we think this way,

149
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:42,960
we're starting to hone in a little bit on some rules.

150
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:52,912
that help us focus our actions and dedicate time, energy, and attention to the betterment

151
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,194
of all the developers on our teams and the teams themselves.

152
00:06:56,194 --> 00:06:58,355
So let's look at these rules.

153
00:06:58,355 --> 00:07:04,479
Okay, so we'll go over these really quick because we're going to spend a lot of time

154
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,300
doing a deep dive into each one.

155
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,962
So the first one is intentional investment.

156
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:16,357
Our time, our money, our energy, our resources, these are finite things.

157
00:07:16,357 --> 00:07:25,945
And so this rule is really helping us determine who and where to invest those things in to

158
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,946
get the biggest return.

159
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:30,228
Second rule of utilizing frameworks.

160
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:40,311
So, this just reminds us that we need to pick really proven methods that work in order to maximize those investments.

161
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:42,551
We'll talk more about that.

162
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:44,092
Prioritizing connection.

163
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:52,435
This is really at the heart of this list, because for us, it's about what makes work.

164
00:07:52,815 --> 00:07:54,476
worthwhile and meaningful.

165
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:56,957
If you ask anyone at Blizzard,

166
00:07:56,957 --> 00:07:59,018
or probably in your studios as well,

167
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:02,179
what do you love most about your job?

168
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:06,501
I guarantee you, or I would bet a lot of money,

169
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:08,662
that the first answer would be,

170
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:10,803
well, I just love making games.

171
00:08:10,803 --> 00:08:12,684
And then followed closely by,

172
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:13,765
I love the people I work with.

173
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,108
I love the people I stand shoulder to shoulder with.

174
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:21,649
And this rule is all about us building upon that

175
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:25,691
and emphasizing and making it easy for our developers

176
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:28,292
to connect with each other, to kind of keep

177
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:31,173
building our brotherhood, our sisterhood, our tribe.

178
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:34,254
And lastly, collaborative learning.

179
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:39,881
This rule builds upon that and really is a reminder to us

180
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:44,047
to never underestimate the power of peer-to-peer learning

181
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:44,588
and feedback.

182
00:08:44,588 --> 00:08:46,030
And we'll talk a lot about that.

183
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:54,815
Okay, so none of these rules exist to imply, I need to be clear, that Blizzard has it all figured out.

184
00:08:54,815 --> 00:08:57,456
We so do not have it all figured out.

185
00:08:57,456 --> 00:09:06,921
We are still trying and learning to do these things well and in ways that feel meaningful to our employees.

186
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:16,224
And so as we'll go through each rule, what I thought would be good is we'll talk about why it matters, of course,

187
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:22,326
and then give you some context and talk about some of the things that inspire our action towards those rules,

188
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:24,666
because I think that kind of context matters.

189
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:30,248
And then most importantly is to give you at least one solid, very practical example.

190
00:09:30,608 --> 00:09:34,611
of how we are trying to bring that rule to life.

191
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:39,195
And the hope, by doing that, is that if you

192
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:41,036
think any of these ideas are cool

193
00:09:41,036 --> 00:09:44,259
or might make a positive difference in your own studios,

194
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:45,140
take them.

195
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,640
Try them.

196
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,242
That's the whole point.

197
00:09:47,242 --> 00:09:49,644
It's my favorite part about GDC is you come here

198
00:09:49,644 --> 00:09:52,446
and hopefully get a little nugget of inspiration

199
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:55,168
and take that back and maybe make your.

200
00:09:55,749 --> 00:09:58,470
you know, your games or your business or your teams better.

201
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,932
Oh, you know, I didn't say shut off your phones.

202
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:02,232
Yeah.

203
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:04,854
That was my bad.

204
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,615
I didn't lead with that.

205
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:09,836
Anyway, so let's dive in.

206
00:10:11,332 --> 00:10:13,432
Intentional investment.

207
00:10:13,432 --> 00:10:16,553
So intentional investment is first by design

208
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:18,814
because it is the most important thing.

209
00:10:18,814 --> 00:10:21,495
Without it, we would be growing our people

210
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:25,696
by chance or by luck, and that is not an awesome strategy.

211
00:10:25,696 --> 00:10:27,717
But what do I mean by investment?

212
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:30,498
I think it's important to be really clear about that.

213
00:10:31,038 --> 00:10:44,592
And so how we think about it is probably how you'd find it in any dictionary, but it's important to say that investment for us is the time, energy, and resources spent in the hope of future benefits actualized.

214
00:10:44,592 --> 00:10:47,655
So each day at work,

215
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:50,949
or outside of work, for that matter,

216
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:53,191
we are all constantly faced with choices

217
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:57,914
of where to invest our time or our energy or our money, right?

218
00:10:57,914 --> 00:11:00,896
So going to dinner with your friends

219
00:11:00,896 --> 00:11:03,959
is an investment in them, right, in that relationship.

220
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:07,181
Or coming to GDC is an investment

221
00:11:07,181 --> 00:11:10,003
in your learning or your career.

222
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,226
Or based on last night, your alcohol consumption,

223
00:11:13,226 --> 00:11:13,886
from what I saw.

224
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:15,636
the shenanigans.

225
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:19,437
But then at work, our investment choice

226
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:22,138
can be things like what part of the project

227
00:11:22,138 --> 00:11:23,539
gets our focus right when we're trying

228
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:25,840
to get pulled in a lot of directions,

229
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,201
or even what meeting do I go to when I'm double booked.

230
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:34,083
And then with respect to the topic of this talk,

231
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:38,585
the choices are who are the people that you

232
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:39,865
are choosing to invest in.

233
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:43,848
And how is that effective?

234
00:11:43,848 --> 00:11:45,770
Some things to think about.

235
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:49,713
I also want to just make sure we're talking about the word intentional.

236
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:54,196
I want to be intentional about our intentions.

237
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:58,645
And how we think about it for us, it's discipline,

238
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:02,568
it's focus, it's deliberateness, right?

239
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:06,631
Being very deliberate so that those,

240
00:12:06,631 --> 00:12:08,372
I guess here's what I want to say.

241
00:12:08,372 --> 00:12:11,894
Everyone can make investments that don't pay off, right?

242
00:12:11,894 --> 00:12:14,656
That's kind of an easy thing to do.

243
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:18,459
But intentional investment for us is the thought process

244
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:20,560
of trying to make the smartest investment

245
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,002
so that we get the biggest return on that.

246
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,366
So that's our first rule.

247
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:29,175
So what are some of the things that inspire our action

248
00:12:29,175 --> 00:12:30,057
towards it?

249
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:30,719
Well, first.

250
00:12:31,482 --> 00:12:34,663
It's awesome, talented developers like this,

251
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:37,124
and all across our studio at Blizzard,

252
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,945
and insert any picture of your teams on here, right?

253
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:46,887
These people are worthy of your investment, right?

254
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:49,168
And your top performers in particular.

255
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,149
They will stop being top performers,

256
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:55,830
or they'll go be top performers somewhere else

257
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,371
if you don't make intentional investments in them.

258
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:08,204
The second source of inspiration behind intentional investment for us is very much a strengths

259
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:14,128
focus and rooted in some of the work that the Gallup organization has done and Marcus

260
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:18,291
Buckingham, another great read, it's called Now Discover Your Strengths.

261
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,733
I recommend it if you haven't read it.

262
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:27,934
And what Gallup suggested, which maybe a lot of you know about, but it's worth just being clear,

263
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:35,607
right, so they said that we spend way too much time focusing on our weaknesses and trying to make them better,

264
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:36,649
instead of...

265
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:41,780
identifying and capitalizing on the things that we're already good at, our strengths.

266
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:48,221
And they argue that if you can identify somebody's strengths and the things they are naturally

267
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:54,483
born and awesome at and really lean into that, you will get far superior performance than

268
00:13:54,483 --> 00:14:00,184
if you would if you spent all that time trying to make their weaknesses better.

269
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:02,365
So a couple of examples to drive this home.

270
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:07,572
So let's look at a study that the Gallup organization did a number of years ago.

271
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:14,617
And they took 6,000 10th graders, some of which were identified as average readers.

272
00:14:14,617 --> 00:14:18,339
So they were clocking in about 90 words per minute.

273
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:22,522
And then they had another group identified as above average readers, clocking in at about

274
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:23,503
300 or 350 words per minute.

275
00:14:23,503 --> 00:14:29,307
And they took a whole 6,000 10th graders through one semester of a speed reading course.

276
00:14:29,307 --> 00:14:29,687
What do we imagine?

277
00:14:32,442 --> 00:14:36,003
that the improvement was for the average readers.

278
00:14:36,003 --> 00:14:37,544
150 words per minute.

279
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:45,028
Pretty good. Very respectable. But what about our above-average readers?

280
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:46,429
What do we think they improved by?

281
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:51,331
It's insane. It's an insane amount.

282
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:52,472
2,900 words per minute.

283
00:14:52,472 --> 00:14:55,773
So we look at this and we say, OK.

284
00:14:58,004 --> 00:15:00,126
The average readers had respectable gains.

285
00:15:00,126 --> 00:15:01,727
That's good.

286
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:06,890
But whoa, it pales in comparison to the gains made

287
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,172
for the above average readers.

288
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:10,853
And so for us, Gallup's work on strengths

289
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:15,937
really helps serve as a data point, I guess,

290
00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:20,400
when we think about developing our people.

291
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,583
And it's starting to help us crack the code of where

292
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,445
to invest our valuable time or our energy.

293
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:33,978
or our money. But it's not just that. Let's look at Rudy. Rudy, movie going way back starring

294
00:15:33,978 --> 00:15:42,883
Sean Astin. Anyone see it? Okay, so I'll explain for those of you that haven't. Sean Astin

295
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:47,285
is also Samwise in Lord of the Rings.

296
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:51,629
And because I love 80s movies, Mikey from the Goonies.

297
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:53,370
So that's also important to know.

298
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,392
All right, let's talk about Rudy.

299
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:59,714
So Rudy was a small guy in football player comparison.

300
00:15:59,714 --> 00:16:04,177
He was shorter, he didn't weigh as much, he wasn't as fast.

301
00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:07,940
But Rudy wanted nothing more than to play football

302
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,341
for the University of Notre Dame.

303
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:15,791
And he applies three times to Notre Dame and is rejected three times.

304
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:21,754
And on his fourth time, he finally gets in and he earns a spot on the team's practice squad.

305
00:16:21,754 --> 00:16:26,096
So the practice squad is those folks that just practice, you know,

306
00:16:26,096 --> 00:16:29,358
they're in the drills every day with the team.

307
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:33,900
But come Saturday, come game day, they do not run out on the field in the uniform.

308
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,882
They are watching that game from the stands or on the television.

309
00:16:38,806 --> 00:16:42,348
All right, so there's Rudy practicing every day.

310
00:16:42,348 --> 00:16:44,849
Finally, fast forward to the end of the season,

311
00:16:44,849 --> 00:16:47,771
and Rudy finally gets to suit up.

312
00:16:47,771 --> 00:16:50,252
So he's in his uniform.

313
00:16:50,252 --> 00:16:51,793
He gets to run out with the team.

314
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,594
He's on the sidelines.

315
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:54,254
He's cheering.

316
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:58,497
And then he finally gets in the game and runs a play.

317
00:16:58,497 --> 00:17:00,798
And he makes this awesome one single tackle.

318
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:06,321
And the crowd cheers, and the players carry him off the field.

319
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:07,822
And it's a really awesome moment.

320
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:18,442
So what I'm going to say might sound a little cold and uncaring, and I don't mean it to be.

321
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:32,949
But when we really look at that, and we see years of pain, of sweat, of sacrifice, blood, sweat, tears, for one single tackle.

322
00:17:32,949 --> 00:17:36,831
That is not a really good ROI.

323
00:17:40,612 --> 00:17:46,213
And so what Rudy's story makes us think about

324
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:50,974
is be careful of taking the path of most resistance.

325
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:53,154
And this is a really hard thing to do.

326
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:58,816
We have a culture of rooting for the underdog, right?

327
00:17:58,816 --> 00:18:00,956
And it's really, really hard.

328
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,817
So it's something to think about.

329
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:05,497
And so we're here, the yeah but.

330
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:09,236
Because all of you are like, yeah, Julie,

331
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:12,497
I've heard the strength thing before, yada, yada, yada.

332
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:18,439
And there's this thing called reality, Julie.

333
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:19,299
And you're right.

334
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,840
You're absolutely right.

335
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,401
Because sometimes a person's strengths

336
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:25,841
does not match what's needed on the project or team.

337
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:29,808
And sometimes even strengths over done,

338
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,628
they become weaknesses, right?

339
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:33,229
That hard-charging producer,

340
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:35,089
oh, there's a lot of producers in the room.

341
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,370
Hard-charging producer that's really, really focused

342
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,310
and driven and gets stuff done,

343
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,331
also gets so tunnel vision on the objective,

344
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:44,992
sometimes they start running over people to get there,

345
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:46,392
as an example.

346
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,573
And we cannot ignore the dark side.

347
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:49,533
The dark side matters.

348
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:53,014
Weaknesses do matter when we're trying to make a game

349
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:54,094
and build teams.

350
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:57,945
So where have we landed on this at Blizzard?

351
00:18:57,945 --> 00:19:00,427
I would love to tell you we have this awesome spell

352
00:19:00,427 --> 00:19:06,330
that we just cast, and it fixes these things, but no.

353
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,752
Where we've landed on this is that people aren't binary,

354
00:19:10,752 --> 00:19:13,573
and we can't solve for every problem.

355
00:19:13,573 --> 00:19:17,155
So these are just the realities that we manage,

356
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:19,176
and we don't make them problems that we solve.

357
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:23,440
So let's look at an example, a Blizzard example.

358
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,123
And I thought it might be interesting to actually use

359
00:19:29,123 --> 00:19:30,344
a look at strengths from a team perspective.

360
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:30,384
Hi.

361
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:36,493
Love that picture.

362
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:38,515
So before the inception of Overwatch,

363
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:42,459
the team was actively working on a bunch

364
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:44,121
of different game ideas, right?

365
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:45,802
Trying to kick around and just generally trying

366
00:19:45,802 --> 00:19:49,146
to figure out what was next for us.

367
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,349
And as part of that process, our game director,

368
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:55,012
the very amazing and talented Jeffrey Kaplan,

369
00:19:55,472 --> 00:20:01,696
was building out his development philosophy for the project along with the team.

370
00:20:01,696 --> 00:20:08,241
And one of the pillars that came out of that, one of the bullet points that showed up on

371
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,282
that, was play to team strengths.

372
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:13,004
And that's how Overwatch was born.

373
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:17,287
Is specifically and intentionally...

374
00:20:18,345 --> 00:20:21,607
investing in the strengths of the team that we had.

375
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:25,628
Decisions about where to put our time and our energy

376
00:20:25,628 --> 00:20:29,189
and our resources with respect to the technical aspects

377
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:31,851
of the game, with respect to artistic actions.

378
00:20:31,851 --> 00:20:35,812
Those were, in very large part, looking

379
00:20:35,812 --> 00:20:38,993
about what the capabilities were of the team as a whole.

380
00:20:38,993 --> 00:20:41,014
More specifically.

381
00:20:43,345 --> 00:20:45,266
When we look at this iconic lineup,

382
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:49,208
and I know Kaplan has mentioned this a few times,

383
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,969
we actually see how some very key strengths

384
00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:55,211
of various people really influence

385
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:56,412
the direction of the game.

386
00:20:56,412 --> 00:20:59,413
And specifically with this hero lineup,

387
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:01,995
we see the strengths of two people in particular.

388
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:04,736
The first is a guy named Jeff Goodman,

389
00:21:04,736 --> 00:21:06,957
who's one of our principal designers,

390
00:21:06,957 --> 00:21:09,819
has been with Blizzard about 15 years,

391
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:12,160
and is probably one of the most talented

392
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,800
and gifted.

393
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,163
hero and ability designers to walk the planet, in our opinion.

394
00:21:16,163 --> 00:21:24,870
And we also see the work and the strengths of another guy named Arnold Tsang,

395
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,053
who's our current assistant art director on the project.

396
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:31,116
And Arne's talent, Arne was put on this earth

397
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,860
And he is an amazing character concept artist.

398
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:41,002
And so when we look at this, the team really

399
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:43,762
made a big intentional investment

400
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:48,024
to really lean in on Jeff and Arne's strengths

401
00:21:48,024 --> 00:21:51,965
to help build the core of this game.

402
00:21:51,965 --> 00:21:53,245
And I am very biased.

403
00:21:55,938 --> 00:22:01,163
But I believe that the decision to use a strengths-based,

404
00:22:01,163 --> 00:22:08,529
like intentional investment approach has resulted

405
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:10,992
in the exponential payoff.

406
00:22:10,992 --> 00:22:12,773
This is our equivalent of going

407
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:16,217
from 350 words per minute to 2,900 words per minute.

408
00:22:16,217 --> 00:22:18,539
Next rule, utilizing frameworks.

409
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:22,149
Why does this matter?

410
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:24,472
Well, for us, we look at, of course,

411
00:22:24,472 --> 00:22:27,296
how that term framework is defined.

412
00:22:27,296 --> 00:22:31,441
And dictionary says, an essential supporting structure

413
00:22:31,441 --> 00:22:33,243
from which to build things.

414
00:22:33,243 --> 00:22:34,685
And this becomes really important

415
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:36,247
when we're talking about building

416
00:22:36,247 --> 00:22:38,009
the capabilities of others.

417
00:22:38,969 --> 00:22:43,611
When you build a house, right, you need that really solid foundation.

418
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:47,393
For us, that solid foundation is intentional investment.

419
00:22:47,393 --> 00:22:52,115
And then that frame on top provides structure, provides the stability.

420
00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:54,809
And that's really, really key.

421
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:57,111
A framework does this for us.

422
00:22:57,111 --> 00:23:00,415
The second thing that we really like about utilizing framework

423
00:23:00,415 --> 00:23:02,597
is it's just simpler and easier, right?

424
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:04,098
When you've got a group of people

425
00:23:04,098 --> 00:23:09,303
following the same steps and the same thought process.

426
00:23:09,303 --> 00:23:11,946
And third, and maybe most important,

427
00:23:11,946 --> 00:23:16,531
is that for us, a framework gives us needed discipline,

428
00:23:16,531 --> 00:23:16,671
right?

429
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:21,318
to have disciplined thought and disciplined action

430
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:22,279
when we think about this.

431
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:27,082
And so the framework that we've chosen

432
00:23:27,082 --> 00:23:31,265
to approach really getting intentional about building

433
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:34,868
our teams and our people is based

434
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:38,530
on the work of the Center for Creative Leadership,

435
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,392
and it's the 70-20-10 Development Rule.

436
00:23:40,392 --> 00:23:43,374
Is anyone familiar with that?

437
00:23:43,374 --> 00:23:45,375
Well, yeah, you guys.

438
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:45,696
They're HR.

439
00:23:45,696 --> 00:23:46,976
They know.

440
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:49,536
All right, so let's talk about that.

441
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:56,200
OK, so if a strengths focus helps us determine who or where

442
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,082
to invest in, the 70-20-10 development framework

443
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:01,323
is the how.

444
00:24:01,323 --> 00:24:04,745
How do we go about making a very calculated investment

445
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:05,165
about that?

446
00:24:05,165 --> 00:24:09,028
And so if I asked each of you, what's

447
00:24:09,028 --> 00:24:13,410
the best learning experience that you've ever had,

448
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,772
the one that had the biggest impact?

449
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,968
I really doubt that you're going to tell me it was this training class that I went to

450
00:24:21,968 --> 00:24:24,732
or this awesome GDC talk.

451
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,741
No, I don't think that would be.

452
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:30,342
What I think you would say is, oh, God, Julie, you know,

453
00:24:30,342 --> 00:24:32,664
it was that time, I was on that project,

454
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:34,004
I didn't know what the hell I was doing,

455
00:24:34,004 --> 00:24:37,086
I had to try all these new things,

456
00:24:37,086 --> 00:24:39,527
stretched really beyond my capabilities.

457
00:24:39,527 --> 00:24:43,189
That's the thing, that's the thing that I learned the most.

458
00:24:43,189 --> 00:24:44,770
And this is at the root

459
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,871
of the 70-20-10 development framework.

460
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:50,793
The best learning, the stickiest learning,

461
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:53,515
happens when it's built into the work itself.

462
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:59,932
So if I need to get better at talking in front of the team

463
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:05,635
during team meetings, I am not going to do that by taking

464
00:25:05,635 --> 00:25:08,878
a class, watching a TED Talk, reading a book about it.

465
00:25:08,878 --> 00:25:13,401
Yes, those things are important, and they do provide

466
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:18,885
sources of inspiration and models of excellence.

467
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:20,766
But that is actually not how we.

468
00:25:22,513 --> 00:25:27,358
learn things in a way that it actually takes root and sticks.

469
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:29,581
The best way that we're going to learn.

470
00:25:30,507 --> 00:25:33,789
and build our public speaking muscles

471
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:35,931
is to find ways to talk in front of the team

472
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:37,573
as much as possible.

473
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:38,133
That's that 70%.

474
00:25:38,133 --> 00:25:42,997
And the 20% in the middle can't be overlooked either, right?

475
00:25:42,997 --> 00:25:46,820
That's the part where after that team meeting,

476
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,144
I get immediate feedback and coaching about how I just did,

477
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:56,068
ideally from my manager or a trusted peer.

478
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:58,310
And together, all these elements.

479
00:25:58,697 --> 00:26:04,263
really create and establish an environment where deep learning and development can take

480
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,764
place.

481
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:11,230
Something though to emphasize, not a warning, but something to emphasize, 70-20-10 is not

482
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,351
a fixed ratio, right?

483
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:21,060
And in fact, for those of you that are leads in the team, we have found that not skimping

484
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,101
on the 20 percent.

485
00:26:22,442 --> 00:26:24,345
is really, really crucial.

486
00:26:24,345 --> 00:26:27,289
In fact, do more of that if you can,

487
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:30,935
because that has really led to be significant differences

488
00:26:30,935 --> 00:26:34,920
in the acceleration of someone's development.

489
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,503
So some examples.

490
00:26:36,503 --> 00:26:37,023
Let's look.

491
00:26:39,162 --> 00:26:45,007
I mentioned I'm a leadership development nerd, which is good because Blizzard cares a lot

492
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:47,309
about building the capabilities of leads.

493
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:53,513
So all these examples are things that we do when we're trying to build leadership capabilities

494
00:26:53,513 --> 00:26:57,176
in particular and how we try and fill each of these buckets.

495
00:26:57,962 --> 00:27:00,504
Really critical, right, because when you think,

496
00:27:00,504 --> 00:27:03,506
you all know this, but leads on your teams,

497
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:06,288
we think of them anyway as force multipliers.

498
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:08,970
They have the greatest chance to do the most good,

499
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,472
they touch the most people.

500
00:27:10,472 --> 00:27:13,934
They also have the greatest chance to do the most damage

501
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:15,235
if it's not done well.

502
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:17,156
So we emphasize this a lot.

503
00:27:17,156 --> 00:27:19,698
All right, so how do we try,

504
00:27:19,698 --> 00:27:23,221
what are some of the things on our list

505
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:26,543
of how we build work development into the work itself?

506
00:27:27,621 --> 00:27:33,064
So, one thing that we do a lot is we have these strike teams at Blizzard and the whole

507
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:37,747
purpose of bringing a strike team together is to make our games better.

508
00:27:37,747 --> 00:27:42,890
And so it's comprised of a bunch of people from cross disciplines and cross teams and

509
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:47,873
their sole focus is to give feedback on a game that's not theirs.

510
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:53,456
And so we found a lot of learning leadership-wise when someone has been assigned to either participate

511
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:55,717
on one of these strike teams or lead it.

512
00:27:59,283 --> 00:28:04,485
The scary thing, hosting internal peer talks, right?

513
00:28:04,485 --> 00:28:07,326
But what we found is that one of the things

514
00:28:07,326 --> 00:28:10,628
that can be really helpful in leadership development

515
00:28:10,628 --> 00:28:12,448
is building someone's presence, right?

516
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:16,590
The ability to communicate ideas in a compelling way.

517
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,251
And so when we're thinking about that for someone,

518
00:28:19,251 --> 00:28:23,433
we might ask them to prepare and deliver

519
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:26,835
an internal peer talk on some area of their expertise.

520
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:31,776
Fixing inherited problems, another awesome way

521
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,957
to build learning into the work itself

522
00:28:34,957 --> 00:28:37,899
and to fill our 70% bucket, particularly when someone

523
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:41,380
has to go outside of their group to solve a problem, right?

524
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,001
So they might have to go across a discipline

525
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:46,262
or across another team in the company.

526
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:49,263
That can be a really effective way.

527
00:28:49,263 --> 00:28:50,004
And scope and scale.

528
00:28:51,157 --> 00:28:51,877
Right?

529
00:28:51,877 --> 00:28:55,280
So maybe I was responsible for this part of the game,

530
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,822
and now I'm responsible for this part of the game.

531
00:28:57,822 --> 00:29:00,264
Or I'm overseeing these functions,

532
00:29:00,264 --> 00:29:03,347
and now you just gave me these functions.

533
00:29:03,347 --> 00:29:07,531
So those kinds of things can also

534
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:09,272
help how we fill that 70% bucket. 20%.

535
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:10,393
I can't emphasize it enough.

536
00:29:10,393 --> 00:29:13,235
This 20% bucket is all about support.

537
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:13,636
Why?

538
00:29:13,636 --> 00:29:19,781
Because learning something new.

539
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,162
is inherently about failing, right?

540
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:25,222
And failing doesn't feel good.

541
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:28,604
And so providing a mechanism for people

542
00:29:28,604 --> 00:29:32,445
to talk about those failures and to kick some things around

543
00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:35,967
is really paramount in the learning process.

544
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:38,348
So examples for us that we use.

545
00:29:38,348 --> 00:29:42,269
So one-on-ones, if there were a soapbox, I would get on it.

546
00:29:42,903 --> 00:29:44,363
I would tell you all to do one-on-ones

547
00:29:44,363 --> 00:29:46,144
if you don't already do them.

548
00:29:46,144 --> 00:29:47,905
But I'm also being very purposeful

549
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:52,106
about meaningful and effective, those terms used.

550
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:53,867
Particularly in this case, if we're

551
00:29:53,867 --> 00:29:56,468
thinking about helping to build somebody's leadership

552
00:29:56,468 --> 00:29:57,408
capabilities.

553
00:29:57,408 --> 00:30:00,569
Ideally, those one-on-ones you're having

554
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:03,810
are less about just the day-to-day tactics

555
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,631
of getting the work done and more about whatever

556
00:30:06,631 --> 00:30:08,812
that thing is that this person's trying to learn.

557
00:30:09,452 --> 00:30:13,573
and helping them talk through that and asking questions like,

558
00:30:13,573 --> 00:30:15,573
what's going right?

559
00:30:15,573 --> 00:30:17,074
What's getting in your way?

560
00:30:17,074 --> 00:30:20,854
And what are you learning about leading?

561
00:30:20,854 --> 00:30:24,075
Effective, meaningful one-on-ones.

562
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:25,635
Mentorships.

563
00:30:25,635 --> 00:30:30,596
So we do not have a formal mentorship process at Blizzard.

564
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:34,997
But we do like the idea of intentionally,

565
00:30:34,997 --> 00:30:37,757
there's that word again, pairing.

566
00:30:38,248 --> 00:30:39,169
people together.

567
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:41,690
And we think about it in two ways.

568
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,930
The traditional, like, senior person

569
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,551
along with a less experienced person,

570
00:30:46,551 --> 00:30:50,393
or we're also starting to play with peer-to-peer mentorships.

571
00:30:50,393 --> 00:30:52,854
Always being very intentional.

572
00:30:52,854 --> 00:30:57,735
So as example, if someone has to get better at their soft skills,

573
00:30:57,735 --> 00:30:59,716
we will intentionally pair them with someone

574
00:30:59,716 --> 00:31:02,597
who is already really good at that, really respected for that,

575
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:05,978
in the hopes that that kind of thing can yield good results.

576
00:31:07,473 --> 00:31:11,036
Discipline lunches, we really like and try and encourage

577
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:14,299
and push leads talking to other leads

578
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:17,823
to learn about how things are going in their worlds.

579
00:31:17,823 --> 00:31:20,085
And it's a good place to kind of, again, build that 20%.

580
00:31:20,085 --> 00:31:24,229
And we also have these things called coaching labs,

581
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:26,371
which I will talk about in more depth

582
00:31:26,371 --> 00:31:28,753
when we get to collaborative learning part.

583
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:30,462
and a 10%.

584
00:31:30,462 --> 00:31:34,606
So we're lucky enough, we have this Blizzard Academy,

585
00:31:34,606 --> 00:31:38,070
so there are lots of training classes that people can go to,

586
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,252
or grab books from our library,

587
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:43,736
or we'll just shoot out a really cool TED Talk

588
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:46,099
or a thought-provoking podcast.

589
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:49,560
Just those kinds of things will go to that internal peer talk

590
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:54,121
that we forced some other person to do, that kind of thing.

591
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:57,442
And an important note on all these just examples of lists

592
00:31:57,442 --> 00:32:00,823
that I gave you is that we just think of them as a menu.

593
00:32:00,823 --> 00:32:03,184
So depending on whatever that thing is

594
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:05,385
that we're trying to get somebody better at,

595
00:32:05,385 --> 00:32:08,826
we just pick and choose what might work and kind of build

596
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,226
a plan for them from there.

597
00:32:12,172 --> 00:32:15,314
So what does this all look like in practice?

598
00:32:15,314 --> 00:32:17,176
Some more kind of practical examples

599
00:32:17,176 --> 00:32:20,979
so you know how we're trying to bring this to life.

600
00:32:20,979 --> 00:32:22,740
And we're going to look, again, because it's easy

601
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,522
because I'm with the team, I'm going

602
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:27,004
to tell you more about Overwatch,

603
00:32:27,004 --> 00:32:29,926
and particularly our art leadership team.

604
00:32:29,926 --> 00:32:34,570
So recently, we appointed several senior artists

605
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:38,833
into lead roles and everything that comes with that.

606
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,214
So now they are.

607
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:47,753
directing the work, managing the work, having one-on-ones in the leadership meetings, all

608
00:32:47,753 --> 00:32:52,855
that good stuff. And that's how we're trying to fill that 70% bucket. 20% is, yes, we're

609
00:32:52,855 --> 00:33:00,419
utilizing one-on-ones as a mechanism to provide them support as they're in these new roles

610
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:01,099
and

611
00:33:02,364 --> 00:33:04,785
falling down and failing and learning and picking them up

612
00:33:04,785 --> 00:33:06,446
and all that other good stuff.

613
00:33:06,446 --> 00:33:08,787
And there's also something else that's kind of interesting

614
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:11,909
that I wanted to share with you that on the slide

615
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:15,771
says team coaching with art direction moments.

616
00:33:15,771 --> 00:33:17,092
So let me tell you what that is.

617
00:33:17,092 --> 00:33:20,634
So because this matters and because we really

618
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:23,875
want to build those guys and their leadership skills

619
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:28,137
and invest in them, every single week at Art Leads meeting,

620
00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:30,118
we intentionally invest.

621
00:33:31,189 --> 00:33:36,892
a dedicated amount of time. This is the brainchild of Billy Petrus, our amazing art director,

622
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:42,655
and Seth Spalding, our really talented art manager, and dedicating some time to talk

623
00:33:42,655 --> 00:33:42,815
about

624
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:46,668
for lack of a better term, the art of art direction.

625
00:33:46,668 --> 00:33:48,369
Our lone artist, he knows.

626
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:49,770
He knows what I mean.

627
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:53,532
Because that's really, really hard, right?

628
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:57,475
It's like learn how to art direct others and the vision

629
00:33:57,475 --> 00:33:57,755
part.

630
00:33:57,755 --> 00:34:01,338
And in particular, a recent example

631
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:03,900
that the group was talking about was how do you

632
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,022
claw some, pull someone away?

633
00:34:09,082 --> 00:34:11,663
from this thing that they love doing.

634
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:12,843
They're noodling on it.

635
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,984
They're perfecting it, right?

636
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:16,565
And you know what?

637
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:19,767
It's not really making gameplay move forward,

638
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:22,348
or particularly in our case, things are moving too fast.

639
00:34:22,348 --> 00:34:24,849
The player's not going to see it, right?

640
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:26,370
And so how to pull that.

641
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,691
And so that group spent time peer

642
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,632
to peer in those meetings.

643
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:36,065
talking about what they're trying, what they're failing at, what they're learning, or what's

644
00:34:36,065 --> 00:34:36,546
working.

645
00:34:36,546 --> 00:34:42,954
And every week we're trying to do that, and that again is kind of filling our 20% bucket.

646
00:34:42,954 --> 00:34:43,375
And then 10%.

647
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:48,621
After we ship, we'll send them to a training class, but not until then.

648
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,080
We're busy.

649
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:58,402
And so the ability though of that art leadership team

650
00:34:58,402 --> 00:35:03,384
to share, to be vulnerable, you know, to talk about things

651
00:35:03,384 --> 00:35:07,685
that are not going well, that actually takes us

652
00:35:07,685 --> 00:35:11,386
to our next rule of prioritizing connection.

653
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:16,908
And we lean a lot on this rule when we think about building

654
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:18,928
and strengthening healthy teams.

655
00:35:20,638 --> 00:35:24,419
So we are social creatures.

656
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:27,159
We are wired to connect to others.

657
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:30,320
And this rule is how we intentionally

658
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,081
create opportunities for that connection.

659
00:35:34,081 --> 00:35:37,302
And this matters a lot, because connection, at least how

660
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,242
we think about it, is how we build trust,

661
00:35:40,242 --> 00:35:44,003
and in particular, try and get that alignment needed

662
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:46,504
to manage those conflicts when they do come up,

663
00:35:46,504 --> 00:35:49,285
because they always come up.

664
00:35:50,326 --> 00:35:53,936
And so what inspires some of our thinking behind this

665
00:35:53,936 --> 00:35:55,360
is worth talking about.

666
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,687
And it's based on.

667
00:35:58,642 --> 00:36:01,684
the work of Patrick Lencioni and the book

668
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:03,985
of Five Dysfunctions of a Team.

669
00:36:03,985 --> 00:36:05,306
Another great read.

670
00:36:05,306 --> 00:36:07,147
Recommend it.

671
00:36:07,147 --> 00:36:10,149
And so really quick, an overview of what

672
00:36:10,149 --> 00:36:14,092
Patrick's book is all about is the first dysfunction

673
00:36:14,092 --> 00:36:16,934
on any team is the absence of trust, right?

674
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:22,398
So team members do not generally open or honest

675
00:36:22,398 --> 00:36:23,839
with each other.

676
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,221
Impossible to build a healthy foundation of trust,

677
00:36:27,221 --> 00:36:28,262
which leads to.

678
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:32,212
The second dysfunction, the fear of conflict.

679
00:36:32,212 --> 00:36:33,574
So now I'm not, I don't trust you.

680
00:36:33,574 --> 00:36:36,558
I don't feel comfortable talking about it.

681
00:36:36,558 --> 00:36:38,981
So we don't really have any conflict, right?

682
00:36:38,981 --> 00:36:41,204
It might be like veiled discussions

683
00:36:41,204 --> 00:36:43,347
or very guarded comments.

684
00:36:43,347 --> 00:36:45,230
And so because we're not engaging

685
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,413
in that kind of healthy debate,

686
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:52,318
a lack of commitment emerges, right, because there's no buy-in.

687
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:55,723
We haven't been able to have that conversation in a healthy way.

688
00:36:55,723 --> 00:36:58,626
And when there's no buy-in across the teams,

689
00:36:58,626 --> 00:37:00,869
you start to turn to the fourth dysfunction,

690
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:03,552
which is an avoidance of accountability, right?

691
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:05,694
It was okay when it left my desk.

692
00:37:05,694 --> 00:37:08,257
Poof, throw it over the wall, like that kind of thing.

693
00:37:08,778 --> 00:37:11,900
And then all of that leads to the fifth dysfunction,

694
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,521
the inattention to results.

695
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:16,744
And that's where you see really, really unhealthy stuff,

696
00:37:16,744 --> 00:37:21,648
in particular people acting in their own interest,

697
00:37:21,648 --> 00:37:24,210
to feed their own needs of whatever it is, ego

698
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:30,015
or recognition, instead of putting the needs

699
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:32,097
of the collective ahead.

700
00:37:32,097 --> 00:37:34,318
So not fun, not a good place to be.

701
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:37,000
And so our rule of prioritizing connection.

702
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:42,165
starts at the bottom of this, because that's the foundation.

703
00:37:42,165 --> 00:37:43,726
And so let's talk about that some more.

704
00:37:43,726 --> 00:37:47,510
Because the absence of trust, I'm sure many of you

705
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,572
are like, yeah, Julie, that's super obvious.

706
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:50,437
Right?

707
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:52,877
Nothing, no surprising there.

708
00:37:52,877 --> 00:37:56,098
But what Patrick Leccioni was not talking about

709
00:37:56,098 --> 00:37:58,719
was what he called predictive-based trust.

710
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:01,900
That's the kind of trust that happens

711
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,601
when we've been working together a really long time,

712
00:38:05,601 --> 00:38:07,841
and I know exactly what you're going to say,

713
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:10,582
and I know exactly what you're going to do

714
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:13,803
at any given situation.

715
00:38:13,803 --> 00:38:15,363
Right?

716
00:38:15,363 --> 00:38:16,444
Charlie Brown and Lucy.

717
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,410
That kind of trust happens everywhere.

718
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:21,891
Very easy to get.

719
00:38:21,891 --> 00:38:23,711
What Patrick Lencioni was talking about

720
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:26,792
was vulnerability-based trust.

721
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:30,714
And that's the kind of trust that exists.

722
00:38:30,714 --> 00:38:36,075
And you can hear people on teams say things like,

723
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:37,055
I don't know the answer to that.

724
00:38:37,055 --> 00:38:37,796
I need help.

725
00:38:37,796 --> 00:38:40,056
Or, hey, I'm really sorry.

726
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:44,118
I was out of line with what I said the other day.

727
00:38:44,118 --> 00:38:45,398
And that's the focus.

728
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,320
of the emphasis on vulnerability-based trust,

729
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,921
and that's what helps.

730
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:57,283
I guess without it, what happens is things get very politicky,

731
00:38:57,283 --> 00:39:01,946
right, and can turn into these horrible manipulations to win,

732
00:39:01,946 --> 00:39:06,087
right, instead of the assumption of positive intent

733
00:39:06,087 --> 00:39:09,689
and the pursuit of truth, the pursuit of what's

734
00:39:09,689 --> 00:39:10,149
best for the game.

735
00:39:10,149 --> 00:39:12,090
So to build.

736
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:15,718
healthy amounts of vulnerability-based trust.

737
00:39:15,718 --> 00:39:19,760
Lencioni, in his book, says and suggests

738
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,523
the use of personal histories exercises.

739
00:39:23,523 --> 00:39:23,583
OK.

740
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:24,644
So if you went back to your teams and you're like, hey,

741
00:39:24,644 --> 00:39:26,025
I saw this cool talk.

742
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:34,450
And we're going to do some personal histories exercises.

743
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:40,354
I'm sure you'll get some eyes rolling.

744
00:39:40,354 --> 00:39:40,894
But.

745
00:39:42,373 --> 00:39:46,937
What if you came back and you said, hey, let's try Pikachu?

746
00:39:46,937 --> 00:39:48,939
Everybody likes Pikachu.

747
00:39:48,939 --> 00:39:50,520
It'll be good, right?

748
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:58,146
This is what we jokingly call, the technical term

749
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,327
is petchakuchas.

750
00:39:59,327 --> 00:40:04,030
And petchakucha means chit-chat in Japanese.

751
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,333
And it's a presentation style that was developed in Japan.

752
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:11,545
in which 20 slides are shown for 20 seconds each,

753
00:40:11,545 --> 00:40:14,686
so you have a six minute, 40 second presentation.

754
00:40:14,686 --> 00:40:20,829
And it was meant to have really, really concise presentations

755
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:22,370
that were really fast paced.

756
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,151
And often, they were images only.

757
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:25,011
There was no text on it.

758
00:40:25,011 --> 00:40:30,594
And I have to thank, actually, GDC four or five years ago

759
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:35,396
for this idea, because this is not Blizzard's idea.

760
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:39,666
throw up the pitchy-pitchy thing there.

761
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:43,968
I sat, a bunch of us went to a talk by a guy named Scott Crabtree.

762
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:48,429
If you've been to GDC for a long time, he used to do a lot of talks, and it was called

763
00:40:48,429 --> 00:40:48,530
um...

764
00:40:50,538 --> 00:40:55,059
This is your brain on game development.

765
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:56,980
You can check it out in the vault. It's really cool.

766
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,261
Anyway, but in that talk, he was working at Intel at the time,

767
00:41:00,261 --> 00:41:03,802
and he talked about how their teams were doing petchacoochas.

768
00:41:03,802 --> 00:41:06,023
A person would do their own petchacoocha,

769
00:41:06,023 --> 00:41:10,425
and how it was starting to help with how those teams functioned

770
00:41:10,425 --> 00:41:12,365
and how they operated.

771
00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:15,066
And so because of that, that idea sparked,

772
00:41:15,066 --> 00:41:17,507
and now petchacoochas are running rampant

773
00:41:17,507 --> 00:41:19,608
across many, many teams at Blizzard.

774
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:23,114
And it's kind of cool.

775
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:25,196
So let me tell you what they look like.

776
00:41:25,196 --> 00:41:27,059
So I fudged this out, right?

777
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:31,223
I don't want to embarrass David Gibson's Pecha Kucha,

778
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:31,904
who this is.

779
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:35,624
super talented animator on Overwatch.

780
00:41:35,624 --> 00:41:39,426
But for us, petchacooches have morphed

781
00:41:39,426 --> 00:41:42,248
into somebody's origin story.

782
00:41:42,248 --> 00:41:45,290
And we are not hardcore about the 20 seconds

783
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,172
or the 20 slides, so petchacooches are generally

784
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:52,115
10 or 15 minutes long, sometimes more.

785
00:41:52,115 --> 00:41:55,197
And it's where the person is talking about

786
00:41:55,197 --> 00:41:59,900
maybe where they grew up, or how they grew up,

787
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,442
things that influenced them.

788
00:42:02,158 --> 00:42:05,720
By the way, when you see your coworkers

789
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,121
with really bad haircuts or in their awkward teen years,

790
00:42:10,121 --> 00:42:11,642
it's fantastic.

791
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:13,123
It's great.

792
00:42:13,123 --> 00:42:16,824
But also you start to see what matters to them.

793
00:42:16,824 --> 00:42:20,945
You see their family or their hobbies, their favorite games,

794
00:42:20,945 --> 00:42:24,487
first job, worst job, all these kinds of things.

795
00:42:24,487 --> 00:42:27,268
And we're seeing some really interesting results.

796
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:34,129
Even outside, yes, it's helping with the vulnerability-based trust building, but we're seeing some interesting

797
00:42:34,129 --> 00:42:34,930
gains also.

798
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:42,475
And one of the first gains that we're seeing is it's starting to chip away a bit at tearing

799
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:43,455
down hierarchy.

800
00:42:43,455 --> 00:42:48,779
you see your art director with his 80s mullet or your HR person.

801
00:42:54,256 --> 00:42:57,338
who wore headgear all the time with her braces

802
00:42:57,338 --> 00:43:00,861
because she thought it was cool.

803
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:02,802
You just can't help but think, OK, all right,

804
00:43:02,802 --> 00:43:04,663
they're just like a big dork, just like I am.

805
00:43:04,663 --> 00:43:07,045
And so it's starting to chip away at that.

806
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:10,568
The second thing, and maybe this one's the most powerful,

807
00:43:10,568 --> 00:43:13,370
is that simply the act of doing them.

808
00:43:14,673 --> 00:43:21,055
communicates a message that is really powerful beyond what is actually said in the Pecha

809
00:43:21,055 --> 00:43:22,756
Kucha itself.

810
00:43:22,756 --> 00:43:29,818
It communicates things like, these things matter, we care about relationships, we care

811
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:37,840
about connection, and that has been hugely important in terms of our teams and

812
00:43:38,413 --> 00:43:41,176
how they feel about coming to work each day.

813
00:43:41,176 --> 00:43:44,638
And the third thing that's been really fun

814
00:43:44,638 --> 00:43:46,880
is that Blizzard has one of our core values

815
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,862
is embrace your inner geek.

816
00:43:48,862 --> 00:43:50,883
It's one of my favorite core values.

817
00:43:50,883 --> 00:43:54,806
And this is really helping bring that thing to life, right?

818
00:43:55,447 --> 00:43:57,348
Because now you've got developers going,

819
00:43:57,348 --> 00:44:00,111
oh, you know, I totally love that game, too.

820
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:02,473
Or, you know, dude, I had no idea you were in a punk rock

821
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,115
band, or I had no idea you brewed beer.

822
00:44:05,115 --> 00:44:06,856
And we're starting to now have people

823
00:44:06,856 --> 00:44:10,780
talking about shared passions when they might not normally

824
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,081
have done that.

825
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:13,082
And that's a win.

826
00:44:14,374 --> 00:44:17,057
So we have found the same results

827
00:44:17,057 --> 00:44:19,739
that Lencioni actually talks about in the book,

828
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:22,622
Five Dysfunctions of the Team, about doing those personal

829
00:44:22,622 --> 00:44:23,542
history exercises.

830
00:44:23,542 --> 00:44:27,206
And I'm going to quote this, because I want to get it right.

831
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,127
So I'm going to read it.

832
00:44:28,127 --> 00:44:28,847
He said.

833
00:44:29,608 --> 00:44:34,569
By describing these relatively innocuous attributes or experiences,

834
00:44:34,569 --> 00:44:38,910
team members begin to relate to one another on a more personal basis

835
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:44,271
and see one another as human beings with life stories and interesting backgrounds.

836
00:44:44,271 --> 00:44:47,792
This encourages greater empathy and understanding.

837
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:52,693
It's amazing how little some team members know about one another

838
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:57,374
and how just a small amount of information starts to break down barriers.

839
00:44:58,610 --> 00:44:59,270
So it's a win.

840
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:04,052
All right, our final rule, collaborative learning.

841
00:45:04,052 --> 00:45:05,593
So collaborative learning for us,

842
00:45:05,593 --> 00:45:09,134
this rule takes those ideas of building trust and safety

843
00:45:09,134 --> 00:45:12,335
and admitting mistakes and really builds upon them.

844
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:15,897
So how are we thinking about collaborative learning?

845
00:45:16,557 --> 00:45:23,799
We think about it just as a situation when two or more people are coming together to attempt to learn something, right?

846
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:32,281
So they're leaning on each other's skills and experiences, and there's some level of dependence and accountability once you have that group.

847
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:40,783
And maybe you're thinking, Julie, you know, I was in college. I did a lot of these group projects, and they totally sucked.

848
00:45:42,152 --> 00:45:46,315
And maybe that's just me, but I don't think you're wrong.

849
00:45:46,315 --> 00:45:50,659
So let me just share how we're thinking about these at Blizzard

850
00:45:50,659 --> 00:45:53,222
or how we think about collaborative learning at Blizzard.

851
00:45:53,222 --> 00:45:54,483
So it's in five ways.

852
00:45:54,483 --> 00:45:56,184
And the first is it's peer to peer.

853
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:02,502
When you are surrounded by really smart, thoughtful,

854
00:46:02,502 --> 00:46:06,824
creative people, you want to hear what they have to say.

855
00:46:06,824 --> 00:46:10,505
You want to know how they go about solving problems.

856
00:46:10,505 --> 00:46:14,907
And it's very powerful to put peers together in that context.

857
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,502
Collaborative learning for us is informal,

858
00:46:18,502 --> 00:46:21,724
meaning that the group decides what they're going to talk

859
00:46:21,724 --> 00:46:24,606
about, how they're going to talk about it, the pace,

860
00:46:24,606 --> 00:46:25,527
and all that stuff.

861
00:46:25,527 --> 00:46:28,669
This is where it departs from those annoying college work

862
00:46:28,669 --> 00:46:29,390
groups, right?

863
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:32,392
There's no one from top dictating what

864
00:46:32,392 --> 00:46:34,033
they do or don't have to do.

865
00:46:34,033 --> 00:46:39,037
Sharing strategies and wins is a significant part

866
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:40,558
of collaborative learning.

867
00:46:40,558 --> 00:46:41,758
It's really critical.

868
00:46:42,503 --> 00:46:46,065
It's that idea of replicating awesome, right?

869
00:46:46,065 --> 00:46:48,166
What's working over there?

870
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:49,447
Wow, that's interesting.

871
00:46:49,447 --> 00:46:52,989
Let me try it out in my world and see if that works.

872
00:46:52,989 --> 00:46:55,030
And vice versa.

873
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:57,051
It's an area where it's expected, encouraged.

874
00:46:57,285 --> 00:47:02,830
rewarded to share what's not working, mistakes that are being made, and what we're learning

875
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,311
from them.

876
00:47:04,311 --> 00:47:07,594
And so at its core, it's really group problem solving.

877
00:47:07,594 --> 00:47:13,599
It gives us diversity of thought, different perspective, different experience, always

878
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,301
leading to a better outcome or a better solution.

879
00:47:19,058 --> 00:47:21,921
And so a good example of collaborative learning, actually,

880
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:24,784
that we already talked about a couple slides ago,

881
00:47:24,784 --> 00:47:30,450
is what the art leadership team of Overwatch is doing.

882
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:32,833
Those art direction moments.

883
00:47:32,913 --> 00:47:36,094
that they spend that little bit of time each week.

884
00:47:36,094 --> 00:47:38,495
Informal, no one's driving what they talk about.

885
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,876
They're sharing wins and strategies.

886
00:47:40,876 --> 00:47:42,616
They are sharing what's not working.

887
00:47:42,616 --> 00:47:46,417
And they're working together to solve common problems.

888
00:47:46,417 --> 00:47:48,278
So that's one example.

889
00:47:48,278 --> 00:47:50,439
Here's another one.

890
00:47:50,439 --> 00:47:52,519
So we have these things called coaching labs.

891
00:47:53,465 --> 00:47:56,728
And we use these coaching labs in a leadership development

892
00:47:56,728 --> 00:47:57,069
context.

893
00:47:57,069 --> 00:48:02,594
So what that means is we put together small groups of leads,

894
00:48:02,594 --> 00:48:05,977
no more than five or six, together

895
00:48:05,977 --> 00:48:12,083
to talk about being a lead and all the challenges, fun,

896
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:14,085
that go with being a lead.

897
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,887
And so it's topics like, you know, you've got the really challenging employee,

898
00:48:20,887 --> 00:48:25,152
or you've got that really tough conversation that you need to have that you're probably avoiding.

899
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:29,112
or managing up and all the things that go with it.

900
00:48:29,112 --> 00:48:31,333
The list is pretty endless.

901
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:34,015
So we've got these coaching labs, small groups.

902
00:48:34,015 --> 00:48:37,238
They're really static, by the way.

903
00:48:37,238 --> 00:48:38,338
So we've got coaching labs.

904
00:48:38,338 --> 00:48:39,239
I'll go back.

905
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:42,882
We have coaching labs that have been happening probably

906
00:48:42,882 --> 00:48:43,902
for five or six years now.

907
00:48:43,902 --> 00:48:46,704
So you can imagine the levels of trust,

908
00:48:46,704 --> 00:48:49,927
vulnerability-based trust, that is developing

909
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,188
within those groups.

910
00:48:51,188 --> 00:48:52,829
It's super powerful.

911
00:48:54,111 --> 00:48:57,413
Frequency of these coaching labs matter only in that there

912
00:48:57,413 --> 00:48:59,295
is some level of frequency.

913
00:48:59,295 --> 00:49:02,277
For us, we do them every four to six weeks.

914
00:49:02,277 --> 00:49:05,459
We do them over lunch, a 90-minute lunch.

915
00:49:05,459 --> 00:49:08,741
And so the cost is really low, cost some pizzas

916
00:49:08,741 --> 00:49:09,362
that we bring in.

917
00:49:09,362 --> 00:49:11,924
And that's really important.

918
00:49:11,924 --> 00:49:15,466
And then the makeup of the groups do matter.

919
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:17,728
Yes, they're all leads for our purposes.

920
00:49:17,728 --> 00:49:19,949
And then we've got some coaching labs.

921
00:49:19,949 --> 00:49:21,310
We're getting bigger now.

922
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,731
So we have some coaching labs.

923
00:49:22,972 --> 00:49:24,853
that are all leads from the same team,

924
00:49:24,853 --> 00:49:27,375
and we've found those to be really effective

925
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:30,037
when we're trying to build trust and alignment

926
00:49:30,037 --> 00:49:32,418
across one unified group.

927
00:49:32,418 --> 00:49:34,720
And then we also have coaching labs

928
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,962
that are from different teams and different disciplines.

929
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:40,604
And those have been super powerful as well,

930
00:49:40,604 --> 00:49:43,026
in terms of a silo buster, right?

931
00:49:43,026 --> 00:49:45,968
So you get more perspective from other things that

932
00:49:45,968 --> 00:49:50,371
are happening across the studio, and more diversity of thought.

933
00:49:50,371 --> 00:49:52,793
And those are really, really interesting and good.

934
00:49:52,793 --> 00:49:56,596
And then the last thing for us, all of our coaching labs

935
00:49:56,596 --> 00:49:59,078
have some rules of engagement.

936
00:49:59,078 --> 00:50:00,559
And the group decides what that is.

937
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:05,923
The one universal rule that we have is Vegas rules apply.

938
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,661
What's said in here stays in here.

939
00:50:09,661 --> 00:50:11,701
We don't talk about Fight Club.

940
00:50:11,701 --> 00:50:15,722
And that's really important in terms of that safety piece,

941
00:50:15,722 --> 00:50:18,283
again, reinforcing that vulnerability-based trust

942
00:50:18,283 --> 00:50:20,764
that we talk about, all that good stuff.

943
00:50:20,764 --> 00:50:24,785
And so I went to a bunch of my coaching labs

944
00:50:24,785 --> 00:50:26,826
and asked them.

945
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,161
said, hey, I'm doing this talk.

946
00:50:29,161 --> 00:50:31,623
Can you give me some quotes about what it means to you?

947
00:50:31,623 --> 00:50:35,927
Because I thought that would be more powerful and better.

948
00:50:35,927 --> 00:50:37,168
And so these are some of the ones

949
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:39,069
that the guys came back with.

950
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:42,412
My favorite is this is the last meeting I ever want to cancel.

951
00:50:42,412 --> 00:50:45,494
That's the value that it's bringing.

952
00:50:45,494 --> 00:50:49,037
And the other thing is this really funny, happy accident

953
00:50:49,037 --> 00:50:51,419
that we didn't intend when we started Coaching Labs.

954
00:50:51,419 --> 00:50:53,921
That last quote at the bottom saying there's

955
00:50:53,921 --> 00:50:55,122
pressure to do something.

956
00:50:55,841 --> 00:50:59,605
pressure to do the right thing in particular.

957
00:50:59,605 --> 00:51:01,767
So I'll just share a little story that

958
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,509
kind of brings that to life.

959
00:51:03,509 --> 00:51:05,391
So you can picture this coaching lab.

960
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:06,552
We're all in a conference room.

961
00:51:06,552 --> 00:51:07,573
There's pizza in the middle.

962
00:51:07,573 --> 00:51:09,535
We're mowing down some pizza.

963
00:51:09,535 --> 00:51:11,257
And one of the leads starts talking

964
00:51:11,257 --> 00:51:13,379
about this really challenging issue

965
00:51:13,379 --> 00:51:14,880
that they have with one of their employees.

966
00:51:16,234 --> 00:51:18,638
And so the group's starting to ask questions, right,

967
00:51:18,638 --> 00:51:21,101
and get a lot of context, like try and understand.

968
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:22,983
And then you start to see things like, well,

969
00:51:22,983 --> 00:51:24,585
have you thought about this?

970
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:26,107
Maybe you should try this.

971
00:51:26,107 --> 00:51:28,851
Something similar happened to me, and I did this.

972
00:51:28,851 --> 00:51:30,613
Maybe that could work for you.

973
00:51:30,613 --> 00:51:34,398
And that lead is walking out of that meeting.

974
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,163
with some nuggets, some actual practical things

975
00:51:38,163 --> 00:51:40,825
that they can do to make a positive difference

976
00:51:40,825 --> 00:51:42,286
on their challenge or their situation.

977
00:51:42,286 --> 00:51:44,948
And so at the end of this particular meeting,

978
00:51:44,948 --> 00:51:47,110
this guy says, OK, you're right.

979
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:49,211
I've been avoiding this conversation.

980
00:51:49,211 --> 00:51:50,132
I know I need to have it.

981
00:51:50,132 --> 00:51:53,014
I've got to tell this person what I expect,

982
00:51:53,014 --> 00:51:53,995
what's happening.

983
00:51:53,995 --> 00:51:54,255
Yes.

984
00:51:54,255 --> 00:51:56,957
And everyone's like, yeah, go.

985
00:51:58,082 --> 00:52:00,103
Fast forward to our next coaching lab,

986
00:52:00,103 --> 00:52:02,964
a couple of bites of pizzas in, everyone

987
00:52:02,964 --> 00:52:04,845
turns to look at that lead.

988
00:52:04,845 --> 00:52:06,546
Again, this is informal.

989
00:52:06,546 --> 00:52:11,448
No one's driving any agenda.

990
00:52:11,448 --> 00:52:13,128
And they're like, how'd it go?

991
00:52:13,128 --> 00:52:15,749
And he goes, I didn't get around to it yet.

992
00:52:15,749 --> 00:52:19,711
And everyone's like, flipping the table and teeth.

993
00:52:19,711 --> 00:52:21,332
He knew what you had to do.

994
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:27,855
Next coaching lab, there's no way that lead is walking into that room without having that

995
00:52:27,855 --> 00:52:29,257
conversation.

996
00:52:29,257 --> 00:52:34,082
So it is forcing people to do the right thing and make good leadership calls.

997
00:52:35,595 --> 00:52:41,019
All right, so let's summarize what we've talked about.

998
00:52:41,019 --> 00:52:43,761
So our first rule of intentional investment,

999
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:47,083
hopefully some big takeaways are that using

1000
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:49,785
a strengths-based approach can help

1001
00:52:49,785 --> 00:52:54,228
crack the code of where to invest your very valuable time,

1002
00:52:54,228 --> 00:52:55,729
energy, or resources.

1003
00:52:55,729 --> 00:52:59,211
And invest for the exponential payoff.

1004
00:52:59,211 --> 00:53:01,953
Lean into someone's strengths, you get the biggest return

1005
00:53:01,953 --> 00:53:03,194
on that investment.

1006
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:07,836
And just be careful about taking the path of most resistance.

1007
00:53:07,836 --> 00:53:11,338
Utilizing frameworks, right?

1008
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:13,860
So for us, and maybe for you, that's

1009
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:17,262
helping build discipline, thought, and action.

1010
00:53:17,262 --> 00:53:19,243
We didn't talk about it too much,

1011
00:53:19,243 --> 00:53:23,446
but choose a framework that matches your culture, right?

1012
00:53:23,446 --> 00:53:25,127
That's really key.

1013
00:53:25,127 --> 00:53:27,028
And if you're intrigued by anything in the 70-20-10

1014
00:53:27,028 --> 00:53:28,909
development rule, follow it.

1015
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:29,609
It does help.

1016
00:53:29,609 --> 00:53:30,830
It does make a difference.

1017
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:34,848
And our third rule of prioritizing connection,

1018
00:53:34,848 --> 00:53:36,229
trust matters.

1019
00:53:36,229 --> 00:53:38,030
Vulnerability-based trust matters.

1020
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:39,050
It matters a lot.

1021
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,051
Invest accordingly.

1022
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,993
Make it easy for your folks to connect with each other,

1023
00:53:44,993 --> 00:53:46,414
to build that level of trust.

1024
00:53:46,414 --> 00:53:48,835
And petchakooches are for the win.

1025
00:53:48,835 --> 00:53:52,797
And lastly, on collaborative learning,

1026
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:55,178
learning is an in-social construct, right?

1027
00:53:55,178 --> 00:53:57,359
So utilize that.

1028
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,200
Lean in on that.

1029
00:53:58,634 --> 00:54:02,697
Don't underestimate the power of putting really smart peers

1030
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:05,279
together and seeing what they can accomplish.

1031
00:54:05,279 --> 00:54:08,481
And if you like the idea of a coding lab, I don't know.

1032
00:54:08,481 --> 00:54:09,342
Call it a manager club.

1033
00:54:09,342 --> 00:54:10,182
Call it whatever you want.

1034
00:54:10,182 --> 00:54:12,184
We're actually thinking, we haven't done it yet,

1035
00:54:12,184 --> 00:54:14,746
of potentially putting disciplines together

1036
00:54:14,746 --> 00:54:15,806
for something like that.

1037
00:54:15,806 --> 00:54:17,988
So maybe putting on a bunch of designers

1038
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:20,970
and have them start talking about design challenges.

1039
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:22,331
That could be interesting.

1040
00:54:22,331 --> 00:54:24,893
So take that idea if you like that.

1041
00:54:26,377 --> 00:54:31,879
And then I will close with just this one thought.

1042
00:54:31,879 --> 00:54:37,082
It's a quote by one of the greatest quote makers, Mark

1043
00:54:37,082 --> 00:54:37,322
Twain.

1044
00:54:37,322 --> 00:54:39,503
He had the best quotes.

1045
00:54:39,503 --> 00:54:44,906
So he says, everyone must choose between one of two pains,

1046
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:49,068
the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.

1047
00:54:49,942 --> 00:54:52,363
In our crazy world of making games,

1048
00:54:52,363 --> 00:55:00,150
often it's not easy to be very deliberate about developing

1049
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,751
your people.

1050
00:55:01,751 --> 00:55:06,335
Things are moving really fast, expectations are really high,

1051
00:55:06,335 --> 00:55:09,937
and there are really, really hard problems to solve.

1052
00:55:09,937 --> 00:55:14,621
And so taking that time to intentionally invest

1053
00:55:14,621 --> 00:55:18,164
your people, that's the pain of discipline.

1054
00:55:18,663 --> 00:55:24,585
Right? And I would love to say that Blizzard never experiences the pain of regret.

1055
00:55:24,585 --> 00:55:31,008
We do. If you were to ask me, you know, hey, are there people that, where were they,

1056
00:55:31,008 --> 00:55:35,049
are where they were last year in terms of their development?

1057
00:55:35,049 --> 00:55:36,670
I would say yes.

1058
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:39,351
But we keep trying and we keep learning.

1059
00:55:39,351 --> 00:55:42,312
And these are some of the things that are at least starting

1060
00:55:42,312 --> 00:55:46,134
to make a positive difference in our world anyway.

1061
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,034
And so I encourage you.

1062
00:55:51,035 --> 00:55:51,876
You know, you're gamers.

1063
00:55:51,876 --> 00:55:52,916
I challenge you.

1064
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:58,299
I challenge you to choose the pain of discipline.

1065
00:55:58,299 --> 00:56:00,901
As you think about the energy and the investment

1066
00:56:00,901 --> 00:56:04,343
that you're putting into your people, make that choice.

1067
00:56:04,343 --> 00:56:07,464
Your games and your teams will be better for it.

1068
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:07,745
Thank you.

1069
00:56:21,286 --> 00:56:22,907
Okay, well that happened.

1070
00:56:22,907 --> 00:56:26,329
I did that.

1071
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:32,052
So yeah, email's there if you want to talk Buffy the Vampire Slayer or anything about

1072
00:56:32,052 --> 00:56:33,973
what we talked about today.

1073
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,333
I guess we have questions too.

1074
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:38,135
We have four minutes for questions.

1075
00:56:38,927 --> 00:56:42,150
I have a question.

1076
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,270
Yes.

1077
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:44,673
When you were talking about intentional investment,

1078
00:56:44,673 --> 00:56:47,956
and you gave the example of the two people who

1079
00:56:47,956 --> 00:56:50,579
were empowered to design the character screen for Overwatch,

1080
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:53,522
what would you say the alternative approach

1081
00:56:53,522 --> 00:56:55,404
that you were discarding was?

1082
00:56:55,404 --> 00:56:56,666
Was it like design by committee?

1083
00:56:56,666 --> 00:56:59,228
What was the thing that you were doing instead?

1084
00:56:59,591 --> 00:57:01,873
Oh, good question.

1085
00:57:01,873 --> 00:57:03,994
So the question was, I have to repeat this.

1086
00:57:03,994 --> 00:57:07,076
So the question was, we made the decision

1087
00:57:07,076 --> 00:57:09,498
to intentionally lean on the strengths of a couple people

1088
00:57:09,498 --> 00:57:12,400
to build out the core of the game.

1089
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,681
What were the alternatives?

1090
00:57:13,681 --> 00:57:15,202
So design by committee was maybe one of them.

1091
00:57:15,202 --> 00:57:18,845
We were just in a state where we needed

1092
00:57:18,845 --> 00:57:23,849
to come up with some ideas right away

1093
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:28,332
for the survival of the team.

1094
00:57:29,271 --> 00:57:36,543
And that was how we were gonna get the exponential payoff.

1095
00:57:36,543 --> 00:57:39,729
So it was almost like we didn't have another choice.

1096
00:57:39,729 --> 00:57:40,430
That help?

1097
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:40,951
Okay, cool.

1098
00:57:41,512 --> 00:57:41,612
OK.

1099
00:57:41,612 --> 00:57:41,732
Hi.

1100
00:57:41,732 --> 00:57:45,573
Yeah, I had a quick question about the Pecha Kucha practice.

1101
00:57:45,573 --> 00:57:45,793
Yes.

1102
00:57:45,793 --> 00:57:47,413
It was quite interesting to share.

1103
00:57:47,413 --> 00:57:48,414
Thanks for that.

1104
00:57:48,414 --> 00:57:49,754
I had a question.

1105
00:57:49,754 --> 00:57:52,755
Was that an initiative for new hires?

1106
00:57:52,755 --> 00:57:55,676
Or is it on a voluntary basis?

1107
00:57:55,676 --> 00:57:56,856
So how does that work?

1108
00:57:56,856 --> 00:57:57,456
OK, cool.

1109
00:57:57,456 --> 00:58:02,558
So the question is, for Pecha Kuchas, is it for new hires?

1110
00:58:02,558 --> 00:58:03,498
And is it voluntary?

1111
00:58:03,498 --> 00:58:04,438
Mm-hmm.

1112
00:58:08,408 --> 00:58:14,571
It's not involuntary, but there's definitely a group pressure to do them.

1113
00:58:14,571 --> 00:58:16,091
And it looks very differently.

1114
00:58:16,091 --> 00:58:19,173
So, for example, the Hearthstone team does it with their whole team.

1115
00:58:19,173 --> 00:58:23,054
Like, they'll take a chunk of their morning, like, stand-up.

1116
00:58:23,474 --> 00:58:25,535
and someone will do a pecha kucha on the team.

1117
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:28,075
They're a bit smaller, and that makes more sense.

1118
00:58:28,075 --> 00:58:30,976
On some of the larger teams, it's discipline specific.

1119
00:58:30,976 --> 00:58:33,457
So like the engineering all hands,

1120
00:58:33,457 --> 00:58:35,497
one engineer will take turns once a month

1121
00:58:35,497 --> 00:58:38,418
to do it, or are all hands.

1122
00:58:38,418 --> 00:58:42,619
Diablo teams deciding to do it in their Monday morning

1123
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:45,200
meetings, someone's turn will be to do a pecha kucha.

1124
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,700
So it just varies by the team.

1125
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:51,026
Okay, great. I had a second question quickly.

1126
00:58:51,026 --> 00:58:54,748
This group of problem solving and sharing strategies, WIIN,

1127
00:58:54,748 --> 00:59:03,673
is it as well done by initiative, by people, or is there a support from HR to initiate these groups of sharing?

1128
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:07,855
Oh, okay. So the question is on the coaching labs, I guess, example.

1129
00:59:07,855 --> 00:59:08,015
Yes.

1130
00:59:08,357 --> 00:59:10,658
for collaborative learning, who drives it,

1131
00:59:10,658 --> 00:59:12,179
who puts those together.

1132
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:14,941
So it started off and it's been traditionally

1133
00:59:14,941 --> 00:59:15,962
like HR driven.

1134
00:59:15,962 --> 00:59:18,044
So we have the model, we have HR people

1135
00:59:18,044 --> 00:59:20,866
embedded with each of our game teams.

1136
00:59:20,866 --> 00:59:23,387
So they'll usually drive it.

1137
00:59:23,387 --> 00:59:24,568
But just literally

1138
00:59:24,568 --> 00:59:26,490
two weeks ago, one of our

1139
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:28,331
art managers says, hey I want to spin

1140
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:30,132
up a coaching lab of my own.

1141
00:59:30,132 --> 00:59:32,434
And we were like, yeah, that's great.

1142
00:59:32,434 --> 00:59:34,515
So we don't really have

1143
00:59:34,515 --> 00:59:35,916
some hard core rules around it.

1144
00:59:35,916 --> 00:59:37,938
The more important thing is that it happens.

1145
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:38,780
Yeah, exactly.

1146
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:38,920
Yeah.

1147
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:39,100
Thanks.

1148
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,881
Yeah, thank you.

1149
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:41,141
Hey.

1150
00:59:41,141 --> 00:59:41,601
Hi, Julie.

1151
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:41,982
Great talk.

1152
00:59:41,982 --> 00:59:45,784
One of the pitfalls that studios I'm at right now

1153
00:59:45,784 --> 00:59:48,266
and the previous studios has been Halo Theory,

1154
00:59:48,266 --> 00:59:50,467
promoting your best talent to leaders and managers.

1155
00:59:50,467 --> 00:59:52,629
Do you feel like coaching labs is the best way

1156
00:59:52,629 --> 00:59:54,009
to combat that?

1157
00:59:54,009 --> 00:59:56,571
Right now, I'm helping people get indirect mentors

1158
00:59:56,571 --> 00:59:59,373
instead of going to the direct manager for coaching

1159
00:59:59,373 --> 00:59:59,993
opportunities.

1160
01:00:00,879 --> 01:00:03,982
So, okay, so the, I'm repeating the question again.

1161
01:00:03,982 --> 01:00:07,085
So the question was, if I understood it right,

1162
01:00:07,085 --> 01:00:10,068
so in your studio, you're experiencing the,

1163
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:13,230
hey, I'm an awesome artist, so now I'm a lead artist,

1164
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:14,832
and that magically endows me

1165
01:00:14,832 --> 01:00:17,374
with all the leadership capabilities needed?

1166
01:00:17,374 --> 01:00:18,295
Right. Okay.

1167
01:00:18,295 --> 01:00:21,098
And are coaching labs for us combating that?

1168
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:25,949
Do you feel like that's a great way to grow people and to get the soft skills to be leaders

1169
01:00:25,949 --> 01:00:26,809
and managers?

1170
01:00:26,809 --> 01:00:28,791
It's an and.

1171
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:33,814
It's not the only thing, but it is proving helpful.

1172
01:00:33,814 --> 01:00:41,980
Maybe more so, I think the guys would say there's some value in like, I'm not struggling

1173
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:42,700
by myself.

1174
01:00:43,661 --> 01:00:47,305
Like some of them joke and call it support groups.

1175
01:00:47,305 --> 01:00:51,349
It's really not that, but there is value in saying,

1176
01:00:51,349 --> 01:00:55,753
hey, I don't know what to do about this thing. I'm not equipped.

1177
01:00:55,753 --> 01:01:01,218
And there's other people in that room that are and that can help.

1178
01:01:01,218 --> 01:01:03,460
So yes, I'd say a yes to that answer.

1179
01:01:05,889 --> 01:01:06,409
Hi, Julie.

1180
01:01:06,409 --> 01:01:07,990
Thanks for the talk.

1181
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,851
With regard to the petri kuches, what

1182
01:01:09,851 --> 01:01:12,132
if you have one or two people on your team

1183
01:01:12,132 --> 01:01:14,253
who are just not interested in sharing

1184
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,874
anything about their personal life with the rest of the team?

1185
01:01:16,874 --> 01:01:18,695
Does that sort of break the flow,

1186
01:01:18,695 --> 01:01:20,316
or how would you get over that?

1187
01:01:20,316 --> 01:01:23,997
OK, so the question was, what if you have people on the team

1188
01:01:23,997 --> 01:01:26,138
that petri kuches are not their thing, right?

1189
01:01:26,138 --> 01:01:27,939
You do not want to get in front of the team

1190
01:01:27,939 --> 01:01:32,001
and expose anything like embarrassing headgear wearing

1191
01:01:32,001 --> 01:01:32,441
pictures.

1192
01:01:33,182 --> 01:01:37,606
So we just kick them off the team.

1193
01:01:37,606 --> 01:01:39,248
No, of course not.

1194
01:01:39,248 --> 01:01:42,050
We, it is not mandatory.

1195
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:44,793
That is not something we want to force someone to do

1196
01:01:44,793 --> 01:01:47,195
that truly does not feel comfortable doing it.

1197
01:01:47,195 --> 01:01:49,837
And everyone gets it.

1198
01:01:49,837 --> 01:01:52,640
They don't, like, ostracize them

1199
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,161
or it doesn't really break the flow.

1200
01:01:54,161 --> 01:01:56,423
We just choose somebody else to go next.

1201
01:01:56,423 --> 01:01:57,444
Cool, thanks.

1202
01:01:57,444 --> 01:01:58,085
Okay, you're welcome.

1203
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,044
Okay, last question.

1204
01:02:02,044 --> 01:02:03,086
Are you cutting him off?

1205
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:03,587
He's cutting me off.

1206
01:02:03,587 --> 01:02:03,747
Oh, okay.

1207
01:02:03,747 --> 01:02:04,649
Sorry.

1208
01:02:04,649 --> 01:02:07,775
We can do, go in the wrap up room.

1209
01:02:07,775 --> 01:02:08,797
Thank you everybody.

1210
01:02:08,797 --> 01:02:09,659
Appreciate it.
