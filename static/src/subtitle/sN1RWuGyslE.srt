1
00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:13,515
Hi, I'm Katarina Mallet.

2
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:16,938
I am so excited to be here with you.

3
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:23,603
Last year, I returned to the games industry after a few years away, and I missed it so

4
00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:23,964
much.

5
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,706
You know, there's just nothing like it.

6
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:30,892
the creative and passionate people, the groundbreaking tech,

7
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,514
the indies, the big shops, the art, the science.

8
00:00:34,614 --> 00:00:37,196
But most of all, I miss that feeling

9
00:00:37,236 --> 00:00:40,219
when a player tells you, I love what you made,

10
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,060
and playing it made my day better.

11
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:45,242
Our job is to delight people.

12
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:47,984
It doesn't get much better than that.

13
00:00:50,987 --> 00:00:54,329
So there's a reason why gaming is larger

14
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:56,891
than both the music and the movie industries combined.

15
00:00:57,652 --> 00:01:04,659
Yes, games are about immersion and play, adrenaline, distraction, but they're also about choice.

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,044
Through the choices that I make as a player, my experience will be different from yours,

17
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:13,467
and maybe even different from my own experience the last time I played.

18
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:18,773
And as game developers, we give players the power to make choices

19
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:22,496
that reflect and even change their view of the world.

20
00:01:23,637 --> 00:01:27,120
The choices that we allow can influence how our players start

21
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,621
to see the real world around them

22
00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:31,944
and how players feel going back into their day,

23
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:35,027
lasting far beyond a gameplay session.

24
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,290
You know this better than anyone.

25
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:41,293
With games, players tell stories,

26
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,955
they play out fantasies, and they even

27
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:44,336
discover what brings them joy.

28
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:48,220
And there are few greater examples of this than The Sims.

29
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:54,147
With over a billion hours played in 2021 alone

30
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:58,870
and over 560 million franchise copies installed

31
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,812
just since 2014, The Sims has made a unique mark

32
00:02:02,912 --> 00:02:03,792
on the history of games.

33
00:02:04,713 --> 00:02:07,114
It has a very real impact on the world

34
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:10,156
and few forms of entertainment can do that at scale.

35
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:13,638
Because The Sims is a game about life.

36
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:21,274
In The Sims, we give players the tools to interact with worlds that are new but familiar,

37
00:02:21,854 --> 00:02:24,676
and help them recreate life as they imagine it.

38
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:30,539
But we can't achieve this unless players see some part of themselves reflected in this

39
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:30,799
game.

40
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,203
As game makers, it is so important for us to create content that authentically represents

41
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,104
the diverse world that we live in.

42
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:46,293
So we work hard to make a world in which players can see themselves,

43
00:02:46,873 --> 00:02:51,417
where they can be whoever they want to be and play with life on their own terms.

44
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,620
We don't wait for it to happen in society first,

45
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,824
and even if we know we won't always get it completely right the first time,

46
00:02:59,365 --> 00:03:00,546
we will keep trying.

47
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,183
We've had same-sex relationships in the game

48
00:03:04,243 --> 00:03:06,184
from the very beginning in 2000.

49
00:03:06,744 --> 00:03:08,906
And earlier this year, we previewed our work

50
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:12,369
incorporating gender-neutral pronoun options into the game.

51
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,173
So we want to continue expanding the tools that allow players

52
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:19,454
to express their identities.

53
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:22,876
This has been a case where society certainly

54
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:23,777
hasn't caught up yet.

55
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:27,199
And solving for this across all global languages

56
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,941
is not straightforward.

57
00:03:29,902 --> 00:03:34,146
As I learned through this process, it is a lot more complex than adding a they-them option,

58
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:35,547
but we can start.

59
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:39,391
And there is still so much room for us to grow here.

60
00:03:39,831 --> 00:03:42,654
And just like society, we evolve as it does.

61
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:47,018
So this work was ultimately picked up by The Hill.

62
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:50,421
a publication widely read by members of Congress.

63
00:03:51,062 --> 00:03:52,884
It was a powerful reminder to us

64
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:56,749
that what we're doing is so much more than entertainment.

65
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,812
People are paying attention and looking to us

66
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:03,236
to see how we empower our players to tell their stories.

67
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:09,328
Through The Sims, players learn more about each other

68
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:10,488
and about themselves.

69
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:13,009
Our base game and expansion packs

70
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,690
allow players to explore a host of what if identities,

71
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,630
large and small.

72
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,891
Exploring what it might be like to have a family,

73
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:24,392
come from a different culture, have a new career,

74
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:27,693
a different body shape or skin tone to be richer or poorer,

75
00:04:28,153 --> 00:04:30,354
live in an urban jungle or a tropical paradise,

76
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:32,234
have a different fashion sense, or I don't know,

77
00:04:32,534 --> 00:04:33,095
be a vampire.

78
00:04:34,806 --> 00:04:38,209
This is our motivation and why we show up to work each and every day.

79
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:42,372
We have a megaphone and we want to use it.

80
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:49,297
So we take this work seriously as we progress towards our aspiration for the Sims to represent

81
00:04:49,337 --> 00:04:51,559
the diversity and complexity of life.

82
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:57,810
So I feel so lucky to be part of Maxis, the EA studio behind The Sims.

83
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,812
Our players are so passionate about the stories that they craft,

84
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:05,473
and we love seeing the impact that our games have on their lives.

85
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:09,816
This sense of purpose, of inspiring everyone

86
00:05:09,856 --> 00:05:12,377
to make a better world through creative play

87
00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:16,879
and our commitment to our players leads to a truly unique culture at Maxis.

88
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:20,575
In creating a more inclusive studio environment,

89
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:23,317
we provide a better experience for our players

90
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,560
and create a place where all sorts of people want to work.

91
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:32,425
So in the last year, 43% of new hires at Maxis

92
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:35,768
have been women, far outstripping the industry average.

93
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,291
This is an exciting signal that we are making progress,

94
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:40,872
but we know we still have work to do.

95
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,694
Our player base is highly diverse

96
00:05:43,754 --> 00:05:44,635
and our team should be too.

97
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:49,341
And our players have told us that they want to see themselves in the game.

98
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:54,224
And bringing more of these perspectives on board will help us realize this vision.

99
00:05:56,326 --> 00:06:00,509
In order to foster an environment where the most authentic games can be made,

100
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:05,312
we need to create a workplace that encourages and values different perspectives.

101
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:08,695
But you don't need to hear it from me.

102
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,416
Listen to our colleagues have to say.

103
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:20,668
I feel like I belong at Maxis because Maxis really embodies a people-first mentality.

104
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:25,111
It goes beyond just platitudes on a wall or in a presentation to the way that we

105
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,952
live, breathe, and act every day.

106
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:33,876
Creating more inclusive games by working with people and talking about lived experiences

107
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:38,859
and working with consultants to learn more about other people, other cultures, other experiences

108
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,721
creates an opportunity to make our games more approachable for everyone.

109
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:53,633
What we do here matters to me because it matters to all the people out there who didn't see themselves represented in games or media before and now have the chance to just explore lifestyle, explore themselves.

110
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:55,154
And that matters to the team.

111
00:06:55,774 --> 00:06:58,095
Working on a product that's really beloved is wonderful.

112
00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:03,038
Working on one that's beloved and able to enrich the world, that matters a lot to me.

113
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:10,876
huge honor to be able to work on the Sims team and be able to see people react to being able to

114
00:07:10,936 --> 00:07:15,577
make a sim that looks like them. We're inclusive in the real sense of the word. The tapestry of

115
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:21,739
individuals that makes up our team is a collection of different life experiences and perspectives

116
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,920
and I think that comes through in our games. Before the Sims, I worked on a variety of games

117
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,981
where the primary verb was kill. Kill your opponent, kill the monster, kill the beast.

118
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:34,862
But here at Maxis, for the first time, the primary verb, what we do is create.

119
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,482
It's a world of difference.

120
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:41,845
We have a very imaginative and creative team,

121
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:45,267
and that just creates a space to experiment and to play.

122
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:46,707
I think it's really valuable.

123
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,669
I think there's a lot of one-to-one meetings at Maxis,

124
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,350
so there's a high premium on.

125
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:55,926
creating intentional conversations.

126
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:59,348
We have people who started working here

127
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:01,089
while The Sims 2 was in production,

128
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:02,309
and we have people working here

129
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:05,170
who grew up playing The Sims and now get to build it.

130
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,191
One of the reasons I love working at Max

131
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:08,272
is that we get to build stuff

132
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:09,993
that no one else in the industry even attempts.

133
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:12,114
We joke that we always try to solve

134
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:13,654
the hardest version of every problem,

135
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:14,735
but I think that's a good thing.

136
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:16,355
Hard problems can be the most engaging

137
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,236
and fulfilling to work on.

138
00:08:17,576 --> 00:08:22,558
I've heard this pitch about, oh, let's add versatility to our game characters.

139
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:24,779
I've heard that so many times on every project, but

140
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:28,020
these guys who were talking to me, they actually meant that.

141
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:31,662
And for me, that was like, oh, you're bananas, guys.

142
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,183
I love it. Can I come work with you?

143
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:37,745
I came to Maxis because Maxis has a reputation of being a place that people can make home.

144
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,605
It's a place where people are taken care of,

145
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:43,107
where they're listened to, and where they're supported in becoming the best in their craft.

146
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:45,688
I've been in the industry for 10 years now.

147
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:46,888
This place feels like home.

148
00:08:52,502 --> 00:08:54,004
Video makes me so happy every time.

149
00:08:56,206 --> 00:08:56,787
Let's see.

150
00:08:57,507 --> 00:08:59,229
So this team is just amazing.

151
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,713
At Maxis, we have such a strong group of people

152
00:09:02,773 --> 00:09:04,334
who've been around a long time.

153
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:06,657
These are our cultural anchors.

154
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:10,280
They approach their work with humility, humanity.

155
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:12,287
and inherent curiosity.

156
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:14,028
They also set the tone

157
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,510
that we are a judgment-free workforce.

158
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,953
We embrace everyone's unique quirks and weirdness

159
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,876
so people can bring their full selves to work.

160
00:09:24,217 --> 00:09:25,418
To complement this heritage,

161
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,039
we have an equally strong group of people

162
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:28,040
who are new to the studio

163
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,023
and bring a fresh perspective to the way we operate.

164
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:33,625
We've been growing a lot over the past few years.

165
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:37,568
Although our average tenure is eight years.

166
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:41,283
Over a quarter of the studio, myself included,

167
00:09:41,303 --> 00:09:43,424
had joined since the start of the pandemic.

168
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:48,305
So we seek out suggestions from our new joiners

169
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:50,946
on how we can improve and what to try differently.

170
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:53,586
Regardless of our individual disciplines,

171
00:09:53,646 --> 00:09:55,767
we are all craftspeople and tinkerers

172
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:58,468
and recognize that we must always be learning.

173
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,151
There's just no such thing as complete in our games.

174
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:04,992
We're always welcoming new ideas and ways

175
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:07,932
to break the mold to keep things exciting for our players

176
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:09,313
and engaging for our team.

177
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:15,434
So for 15 years, we had built rigs and mesh

178
00:10:15,654 --> 00:10:16,835
in essentially the same way.

179
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:19,475
Then a few years ago, some engineers

180
00:10:19,515 --> 00:10:21,036
wanted to experiment with ArcTech,

181
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:23,256
so they huddled together and proposed a new approach.

182
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:26,177
They had only been looking for clothing

183
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:28,998
that could be applied to male or female body types.

184
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:30,829
But the team saw something bigger.

185
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,791
So while this could have been

186
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:35,073
a more straightforward tech implementation,

187
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,757
we saw a chance to provide even more opportunities

188
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:40,218
for our players' expression.

189
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:44,802
And players can now create Sims with any type of physique,

190
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:48,706
walk style, tone of voice, regardless of their gender,

191
00:10:49,306 --> 00:10:51,929
and dress or style these new Sims in any way they choose.

192
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:56,399
So not only did this moment expand gender expression

193
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:59,740
opportunities for our players, but it also fundamentally

194
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,561
changed the way our studio approaches

195
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:04,102
gender representation and to open our eyes

196
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:05,703
to a new way of planning content.

197
00:11:08,244 --> 00:11:10,404
So I now want to bring you under the hood a little bit

198
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:12,825
and show you how we work behind the scenes

199
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:16,447
to create a game that not only reflects life,

200
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:17,747
but helps shape it.

201
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:20,728
First.

202
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:23,363
We know and use our values.

203
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,525
Everybody wants to be anchored

204
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:27,026
in something they feel good about.

205
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:32,791
Our values are not aspirational or what we wish we did.

206
00:11:33,512 --> 00:11:36,154
They represent who we are when we're at our best.

207
00:11:37,616 --> 00:11:39,938
We recently revamped our values to make sure

208
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:42,040
that they're fresh and that people feel connected to them.

209
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,423
And we didn't rely on an agency to do this work.

210
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:48,809
We had passionate team members conduct interviews

211
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:53,270
across the studio to distill our culture to its key essence.

212
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,011
So ours are create collaboratively,

213
00:11:56,471 --> 00:12:00,272
challenge ourselves, champion inclusivity, and be authentic.

214
00:12:02,173 --> 00:12:05,894
Company values can be such a cliched trope,

215
00:12:06,614 --> 00:12:09,275
but they can be so impactful when used well.

216
00:12:10,015 --> 00:12:12,216
Having strong values that help us

217
00:12:12,276 --> 00:12:14,297
know what decisions to make when we're

218
00:12:14,337 --> 00:12:15,757
stressed or under pressure.

219
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:19,547
is what makes the difference between scaling successfully

220
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:21,069
or dramatic collapse.

221
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,673
I have seen this firsthand.

222
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:28,258
When a team is small and everyone talks to everyone,

223
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:30,761
leaders implicitly model the team's values

224
00:12:31,162 --> 00:12:33,745
through behaviors and interactions that everyone sees.

225
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:38,963
During periods of change, however, growth or a change

226
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:43,526
in strategy or an organizational shakeup or, I don't know,

227
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:47,568
pandemic, having articulated useful values

228
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:48,789
are an important compass.

229
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,713
So alongside goals or OKRs or whatever your model is

230
00:12:55,873 --> 00:12:58,154
for saying, here is where we want to go,

231
00:12:58,814 --> 00:13:02,236
values are how you communicate how the team should get there.

232
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:12,716
They become a social contract, a sense of cohesion that aligns the team even when they no longer interact with each other the way they could when they saw each other every day.

233
00:13:14,098 --> 00:13:23,106
Championing inclusivity and being authentic are part of our values because it's critical to our game, to our players, to our team, to our business.

234
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:26,129
It's not a strategy.

235
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:27,831
It's who we are.

236
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:34,175
Next, to build teams with diverse backgrounds

237
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:36,456
to actually inform these authentic experiences,

238
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,558
we need to ensure that we're hiring free of bias

239
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,699
and have teams that authentically represent

240
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,060
the diversity of our audiences.

241
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,442
We look for diversity in all its forms,

242
00:13:46,962 --> 00:13:49,223
professional skill sets, demographics,

243
00:13:49,483 --> 00:13:50,544
and lived experiences.

244
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:53,065
And as part of our hiring process,

245
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,806
our recruitment panels are trained

246
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:56,547
to understand implicit bias,

247
00:13:57,188 --> 00:13:59,569
and they're equipped with questions that favor inclusion.

248
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,356
Plus, our job descriptions, they're fed through a processor

249
00:14:03,516 --> 00:14:05,779
that checks for language that might feel exclusionary.

250
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,384
We encourage our hiring managers

251
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:11,865
to consider alternative backgrounds

252
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,569
and complementary skill sets and are leaning into our efforts

253
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:17,991
to recruit early career talent into the industry.

254
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:24,308
And what's a big step for us, we've committed to a remote-friendly hybrid working model for the studio,

255
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:28,111
and can now hire the best talent regardless of location.

256
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:33,336
And this gives us access to a much broader range of lived experiences to inform our designs.

257
00:14:34,897 --> 00:14:40,682
When we review interview feedback, we have a third-party person who facilitates these conversations

258
00:14:40,742 --> 00:14:43,704
to ensure there's no bias in the feedback that we give.

259
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,503
And all of our employees receive training to make sure

260
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:49,825
that they uphold our inclusive culture.

261
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:54,468
Hiring is, of course, only the first step, though.

262
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:58,251
Inclusivity isn't just about having a diverse team.

263
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:00,752
It's about creating a culture

264
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:03,634
that encourages diverse perspectives to be heard.

265
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:08,017
So we seek to operate in a way that allows everyone

266
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:11,200
to contribute and make an impact beyond the limits

267
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,021
of an individual team or function.

268
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:18,017
For example, to pull off an authentic representation

269
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:21,142
of higher education for our Discover University expansion

270
00:15:21,182 --> 00:15:23,986
pack a few years ago, we knew we couldn't just

271
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:26,811
draw from experiences in the American educational system.

272
00:15:28,258 --> 00:15:30,380
So as we started brainstorming designs,

273
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,861
we reached out across the team,

274
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:34,023
specifically looking to explore

275
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:35,945
global educational experiences.

276
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:39,227
Through this process, we found tech leads

277
00:15:39,268 --> 00:15:40,368
who went to school in India,

278
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,551
gameplay engineers who went to school in South America

279
00:15:43,591 --> 00:15:46,454
and the UK, and artists who studied in Japan.

280
00:15:47,255 --> 00:15:48,736
Workshops with these teammates.

281
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:51,573
helped unearth differences and commonalities

282
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,435
across these unique educational experiences,

283
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:56,656
ultimately informing the features

284
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:58,016
that allowed our players to feel

285
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:00,577
that their own unique experiences could be represented.

286
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:04,159
If we're exploring a topic

287
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:06,480
that is beyond our team's expertise,

288
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,001
we'll actively seek out people

289
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:09,722
who have those lived experiences,

290
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,223
either through the very popular employee resource groups

291
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:17,805
or ERGs across EA, or by bringing in outside experts.

292
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:24,842
For our fashion kits that were inspired by styles found

293
00:16:25,022 --> 00:16:29,223
on Fashion Street in Mumbai or the airport fashion runways

294
00:16:29,483 --> 00:16:31,543
at Incheon International in Seoul,

295
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:34,344
we partnered closely with external consultants

296
00:16:34,404 --> 00:16:37,765
who helped us design collections that authentically celebrated

297
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:39,745
the trends and cultures in those cities.

298
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:45,486
This emphasis on listening to the team

299
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,527
extends beyond game features to how we operate the studio.

300
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:54,648
A few months ago, I started what I called a listening tour

301
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:58,349
to meet with employees across the entire studio.

302
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:00,149
It was so helpful.

303
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:02,070
I recommend it so highly.

304
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:08,411
I sat down with people of all levels, tenure and working style

305
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:10,612
to understand how they were feeling

306
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:12,072
about the prospect of hybrid work.

307
00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:16,113
I wanted to understand their pain points, their preferences,

308
00:17:16,353 --> 00:17:18,594
how they were juggling home life, integration,

309
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:20,554
and just what they were worried about.

310
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:25,464
So as a result of this, we decided to test run a large hybrid meeting,

311
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:29,308
roughly half in the office and half virtual.

312
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:32,791
It was a hot mess.

313
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:38,395
Half the people were staring at the back of my head while I was looking at those on screen.

314
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:41,458
Half didn't feel like they could speak up in the conference room.

315
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:44,381
And it was just not an inclusive experience.

316
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:47,583
So we realized that large meetings are best

317
00:17:47,643 --> 00:17:51,066
for virtual platforms, focusing in-person meetings

318
00:17:51,326 --> 00:17:54,328
on workshops and highly collaborative interactions.

319
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:57,131
And this has fundamentally changed the way

320
00:17:57,151 --> 00:17:59,673
that we were thinking about the expectations we set

321
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:01,914
for our teams about working in hybrid.

322
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:07,639
We also learned that people love recorded meetings.

323
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,521
They like having the flexibility to check in

324
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:12,402
and what was shared on their own time.

325
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:15,112
We work across multiple time zones,

326
00:18:15,212 --> 00:18:17,354
and catering to this has made a huge difference.

327
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:22,218
Most importantly, we were reminded that senior leaders

328
00:18:22,678 --> 00:18:24,660
aren't necessarily equipped to determine

329
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,201
the best working style for every team and every employee.

330
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:30,904
Instead, we're here to set the tone, reduce barriers,

331
00:18:31,024 --> 00:18:33,246
and provide the tools for people to work in ways

332
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,008
that make sense for them and their teammates.

333
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,193
We do engagement surveys, and we do monthly pulses,

334
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:42,953
and they're valuable.

335
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:46,767
but they don't replace just sitting and listening.

336
00:18:47,908 --> 00:18:50,268
Pre-pandemic, I would have spent a lot of time

337
00:18:50,408 --> 00:18:53,509
just walking around the studio, chatting with people.

338
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:58,110
But new working styles require new ways of engaging,

339
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,731
and so I'll be continuing my listening tours

340
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:02,111
and holding office hours.

341
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:07,252
We've also implemented cross-studio volunteer

342
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:07,653
committees.

343
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:11,273
We call them Sul Sul, after hello in Simlish,

344
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:13,554
to help support team health.

345
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:16,140
productivity engagement across the studio.

346
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,322
Focused on topics like recognition,

347
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:24,543
welcoming new team members, asynchronous productivity,

348
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,844
or whatever else the team decides,

349
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:30,946
these committees help us engage voices from across the team

350
00:19:31,386 --> 00:19:32,727
who are passionate about a topic,

351
00:19:32,987 --> 00:19:36,088
rather than just going back to the same usual suspects

352
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:38,449
or relying on seniority or function.

353
00:19:41,923 --> 00:19:45,485
We also engage our community to understand what matters to them.

354
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:50,908
At the end of the day, our players are at the center of everything we do.

355
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:55,891
Alongside consumer and player insights research and playtesting,

356
00:19:56,592 --> 00:19:59,734
we're continuing to refine our methods for listening to our community

357
00:20:00,294 --> 00:20:03,116
and finding new and healthy ways to involve them.

358
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:07,589
For our work on customizable pronouns,

359
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:09,931
we've sought super valuable feedback

360
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:12,533
from not only our external and expert partners,

361
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:14,655
but the player community at large.

362
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,919
Sharing work in progress was a big step for us,

363
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,942
and one we'd really like to do more of.

364
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,226
We want our game team to be able to connect directly

365
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:30,531
with our players and fans in a psychologically safe way.

366
00:20:31,444 --> 00:20:35,286
And we're exploring how we can create even more ways to do so,

367
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:38,628
whether it's live streams, dev diaries, forums,

368
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:39,549
listening sessions.

369
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:44,272
It's an ongoing journey, and one that we're getting better at.

370
00:20:47,354 --> 00:20:50,777
We all want a relationship of transparency and trust

371
00:20:51,197 --> 00:20:51,897
with the community.

372
00:20:52,838 --> 00:20:55,960
Our players care so much about the Sims.

373
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,022
But we've seen at times that this passion can take a turn

374
00:21:01,122 --> 00:21:02,383
from positive to negative,

375
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:05,865
directed at our team members on the frontline.

376
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:11,728
Our devs are working so hard to delight our players.

377
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:15,591
And when this happens, it is so hard for me to watch.

378
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:18,913
And it's not okay.

379
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:26,338
We value the feedback and insights of our community greatly.

380
00:21:27,114 --> 00:21:30,137
and are continuing to refine how we engage the community

381
00:21:30,537 --> 00:21:32,338
with mutual grace and respect.

382
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,642
Being part of a gaming community should be positive,

383
00:21:37,202 --> 00:21:42,247
fun, fair, and safe for all, our players and our teams.

384
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,552
As you can probably tell,

385
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:52,555
I am extremely proud to be part of Maxis and The Sims.

386
00:21:53,736 --> 00:21:56,238
Not just because we make a game that players love,

387
00:21:57,064 --> 00:21:59,146
But I know what we do matters.

388
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:04,710
Our ambition is to inspire everyone to make a better world

389
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:06,372
through creative play.

390
00:22:07,813 --> 00:22:10,295
Our employees are really good at what they do.

391
00:22:11,896 --> 00:22:14,819
They have plenty of options for where they could work.

392
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,342
And we know that this sense of purpose

393
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:21,824
is part of the reason they choose Maxis

394
00:22:22,465 --> 00:22:25,047
and what motivates us to show up every day

395
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:26,588
to deliver for our players.

396
00:22:30,544 --> 00:22:32,585
Making impactful entertainment is hard.

397
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:36,647
Hiring the right individuals, it's hard.

398
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:41,169
Engaging and retaining large teams is hard.

399
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:42,089
Change is hard.

400
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,951
But working alongside diverse team members

401
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,212
makes these challenges a lot easier,

402
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:50,113
a lot more fun,

403
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:53,834
and a lot more likely to yield successful results.

404
00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:57,336
And I actually think that our new,

405
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,217
remote-friendly working lifestyle is helping us.

406
00:23:03,352 --> 00:23:06,374
Now we can bring in more geographic diversity

407
00:23:06,534 --> 00:23:09,836
and work more seamlessly across North America and Europe.

408
00:23:10,976 --> 00:23:13,738
We're going after the best talent, regardless of location.

409
00:23:14,178 --> 00:23:17,160
And this not only helps us bring in more hard skills,

410
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,561
but also allows us to open the door to soft skills

411
00:23:20,702 --> 00:23:24,163
and unique experiences that help us make a better,

412
00:23:24,323 --> 00:23:25,284
more inclusive game.

413
00:23:26,345 --> 00:23:28,446
Previously, almost all of our developers

414
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:29,906
were based in Northern California.

415
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,433
with Northern California experiences,

416
00:23:33,674 --> 00:23:37,178
and they were mostly only familiar with Northern California.

417
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:41,863
And the pandemic changed that, and we're now able to benefit

418
00:23:41,943 --> 00:23:43,906
from this global diversity of experience.

419
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:46,949
Now we can hire employees who understand what it's

420
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:51,134
like to be a parent in Stockholm or a recent grad in Toronto.

421
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:57,435
So working remotely has also led to a greater appreciation

422
00:23:57,956 --> 00:23:59,957
of the complexities of people's lives,

423
00:24:00,478 --> 00:24:03,040
and it builds empathy and trust across the team.

424
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:05,622
In the beginning of the pandemic,

425
00:24:05,822 --> 00:24:08,504
working from home was a jarring experience.

426
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:12,247
And over time, it's become the norm, right?

427
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:14,669
We get glimpses into our boss's living room,

428
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:17,811
children bust through doors, cats walk on keyboards.

429
00:24:19,213 --> 00:24:22,855
We understand if someone needs to go off camera or needs to go run,

430
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:24,116
pick up their kid from school.

431
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:26,258
And there's less of an expectation

432
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,639
that you have a work self and a home self.

433
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,422
And this openness has really helped lower many barriers.

434
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:34,263
Myself included.

435
00:24:35,484 --> 00:24:36,445
I have three young kids.

436
00:24:37,886 --> 00:24:39,127
I live in the Boston area.

437
00:24:40,488 --> 00:24:42,529
And the majority of my team is on the West Coast.

438
00:24:43,968 --> 00:24:47,491
Before the pandemic, I'm not sure that this job would have been doable

439
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:51,715
without uprooting my family's entire life and moving across the country.

440
00:24:53,356 --> 00:24:57,860
I was able to take on a job that aligned with the impact that I want to make,

441
00:24:58,701 --> 00:25:02,845
not because it was the most convenient or physically close to home.

442
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:07,549
My whole team is now used to seeing my kids come in for a hug

443
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:08,810
when they come home from school.

444
00:25:10,027 --> 00:25:13,769
And I love that my eight-year-old daughter can see what my work entails.

445
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,792
When I grew up, my mom left home at seven in the morning, and she came home 12 hours later.

446
00:25:21,993 --> 00:25:26,636
And I am so happy to be able to be a much more present role model for my kids.

447
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:35,040
Our new ways of working are also leading to more inclusive communication.

448
00:25:36,183 --> 00:25:39,905
We have fun and extremely active chats during our town halls,

449
00:25:40,326 --> 00:25:43,568
and we have entire Slack channels dedicated to giving kudos

450
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:44,248
to our teammates.

451
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:48,311
We have shared digital puzzles and impromptu huddles.

452
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:52,094
And with digital tools like Miro and Loom and Zoom,

453
00:25:52,614 --> 00:25:55,076
people are empowered to jump into the conversation

454
00:25:55,496 --> 00:25:58,578
and engage with people across teams and seniority levels.

455
00:25:59,158 --> 00:25:59,819
And it works.

456
00:26:01,057 --> 00:26:05,879
People who previously may not have been comfortable stopping a senior leader in the hallway are

457
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:07,800
perfectly happy to reach out on Slack.

458
00:26:08,561 --> 00:26:11,723
And it's leveling the playing field across the whole studio.

459
00:26:11,743 --> 00:26:12,883
It's fun.

460
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:17,026
So I'm clearly excited about our future.

461
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:23,529
We are committed to being more inclusive of different backgrounds, races, genders, geographies,

462
00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:25,290
and ways of thinking than ever before.

463
00:26:26,015 --> 00:26:28,436
We of course want to attract gaming experts,

464
00:26:28,816 --> 00:26:31,138
but we realize that there's enormous potential

465
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:32,218
outside the industry.

466
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:35,200
We need fashion designers, artists, architects,

467
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,382
e-commerce specialists, machine learning experts,

468
00:26:37,482 --> 00:26:38,622
and so much more.

469
00:26:39,383 --> 00:26:42,004
We view non-traditional experience as an asset,

470
00:26:42,505 --> 00:26:43,085
not a drawback.

471
00:26:44,786 --> 00:26:47,047
So pulling this all together,

472
00:26:47,928 --> 00:26:51,530
inclusivity allows us to attract a broader range of talent

473
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,492
and provide a more authentic experience for our players.

474
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,082
We all know that diverse, inclusive teams have better business outcomes.

475
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:03,687
Plus, it creates a more interesting and engaging environment to work in.

476
00:27:04,307 --> 00:27:06,649
It's a win, no matter how you look at it.

477
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:15,177
Since The Sims 4 launched eight years ago, monthly active users has grown every year.

478
00:27:15,197 --> 00:27:20,161
A testament to the passion of our players and the creativity of our team.

479
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,812
We are still tackling new technical challenges,

480
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:26,293
building groundbreaking new features,

481
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:28,795
and finding new and innovative ways

482
00:27:28,835 --> 00:27:31,156
to engage with our players for years to come.

483
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:35,519
Plus, we're building something big and ambitious.

484
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,860
We're excited and we're passionate about what's to come.

485
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:42,442
And it's pushing us to examine how we build our teams

486
00:27:43,143 --> 00:27:44,564
and how we innovate for the future.

487
00:27:45,524 --> 00:27:47,425
And all this means we're taking a moment.

488
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,692
to reflect on our culture, consider how we work in this post-pandemic world,

489
00:27:53,232 --> 00:27:56,134
and take advantage of the changes wrought by the last few years.

490
00:27:57,295 --> 00:28:01,317
We're 21 years into this franchise, and we're just getting started.

491
00:28:03,623 --> 00:28:04,804
So thank you all.

492
00:28:04,964 --> 00:28:06,505
It has been so good to be here.

493
00:28:06,525 --> 00:28:09,668
I haven't been to an in-person conference in over two years,

494
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,771
so I can't thank you enough for having been here with me.

495
00:28:14,232 --> 00:28:15,213
We don't have time for questions,

496
00:28:15,253 --> 00:28:18,135
but I am going to be in the wrap-up room over there

497
00:28:18,215 --> 00:28:21,438
if anybody wants to pop by and keep the conversation going.

498
00:28:21,838 --> 00:28:22,039
Thanks.

499
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:30,086
Thank you.
