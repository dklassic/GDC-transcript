1
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:13,571
Are you ready for a sermon?

2
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:26,258
In the beginning, there was a place, a place of life, of laughter, of love, where the word

3
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:31,861
said thou shalt not worry about trivial things like non-believers and steam reviews.

4
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:37,359
There is another place, and it's a dark place.

5
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,541
I think you're all pretty familiar with it.

6
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:44,664
It's a place where people go when they're very unhappy with their lives.

7
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:51,768
An endless stream of shouting and arguing and noise, faceless avatars yelling at you

8
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:55,530
for no reason, but it's also somehow the best place for networking in the industry.

9
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,031
I'm talking about Twitter!

10
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:57,992
Can I get an amen?

11
00:00:58,012 --> 00:00:59,453
Thank you.

12
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:01,754
Thank you.

13
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:12,512
Now, now, children, children, if you're here in this house, of all the places in the world

14
00:01:12,552 --> 00:01:19,041
you could be, you're listening to this sermon, you're part of this congregation, then I just

15
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:20,804
have one question for you.

16
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,185
Security, these people are trying to start a cult.

17
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:26,385
I think we gotta round them up.

18
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:27,886
Let the authorities know.

19
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:30,208
Don't worry, that's just a joke.

20
00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:32,189
Here we accept all belief systems.

21
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,530
And if you are here,

22
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,032
then I know that you want to help grow our cult.

23
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:38,193
You ready?

24
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:43,816
So step one, we need to tell people about our cult.

25
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:45,957
Let's try to think of a few different ways.

26
00:01:46,277 --> 00:01:50,999
So maybe if we could get involved with a really big event,

27
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:53,059
one that lots of people are watching,

28
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,520
that lots of people are anticipating.

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,401
Anyone here have Jeff Keighley's phone number?

30
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:03,763
Maybe we could get into the game awards or hmm, you know,

31
00:02:03,763 --> 00:02:06,125
I think our cults would be good, you know,

32
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,725
helping a lot of people's lives.

33
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:10,541
So if they look up on Google, how to be happy,

34
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,589
we want our cults to be top of the search results,

35
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:14,189
we're going to have to pay for some ads, you know,

36
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:17,325
maybe we pull all pool all our money together, we could get that.

37
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:22,787
What if our what if we tried to sponsor someone really famous,

38
00:02:22,787 --> 00:02:25,155
like we could reach out to influencers, you know,

39
00:02:25,155 --> 00:02:28,370
a lot of celebrities have a big history with cults.

40
00:02:29,722 --> 00:02:30,883
So I think it's a good fit.

41
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:34,085
You know, there's definitely some press outlets

42
00:02:34,165 --> 00:02:36,687
with cult followings, and I'm not gonna name any names.

43
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:39,770
Or we could go to live events.

44
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,632
You know, people pay hundreds and thousands of dollars

45
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:44,393
to go to these live events,

46
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:46,935
and they'll probably want to get their money's worth

47
00:02:46,975 --> 00:02:49,517
by listening to whoever's speaking on the front of the stage.

48
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:50,718
So I think that's a good idea.

49
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:56,652
Some of you, some of you here, you probably work for big companies, and maybe you could

50
00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:57,933
help us get in with those.

51
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:00,015
There's a lot of cult followings in there.

52
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:06,779
Or how about we try something that's free, that can grow exponentially, and certainly

53
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,661
has no downsides whatsoever.

54
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:09,902
I can't think of a single one.

55
00:03:09,962 --> 00:03:11,223
I'm talking about social media.

56
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:15,608
So thank you for coming.

57
00:03:15,908 --> 00:03:17,729
My name is Jared J Tan.

58
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:20,750
I'm the community strategist here at Devolver Digital,

59
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,472
and I'm also a chartered professional CPA accountant.

60
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:26,233
I've only been working in games

61
00:03:26,613 --> 00:03:28,673
and in community and marketing for only two years.

62
00:03:29,254 --> 00:03:30,574
This is my first GDC talk.

63
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:33,375
So if you don't feel that an accountant is qualified

64
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:35,296
to talk about games, that's not very nice.

65
00:03:35,376 --> 00:03:36,497
I think, yeah.

66
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:43,593
Before joining Devolver, I was the community manager for Cult of the Lamb's launch last year.

67
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:46,475
And I got to work with Massive Monster,

68
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:51,300
they're a very small dev team that at the time of launch they had only 5 full-time employees.

69
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,143
And things have been pretty good for all of us who worked on the game since then.

70
00:03:55,944 --> 00:04:00,228
And if you haven't heard of Cult of the Lamb, firstly, congratulations.

71
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:03,210
That means you're in a healthy mental state and are not on gaming Twitter.

72
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:08,739
But it's a game where you start your own cult of cute woodland animals.

73
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:12,701
As the last lamb in the world, you're tasked with growing a cult.

74
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:16,643
You'll slay heretics and sometimes even convince them to join your cult,

75
00:04:16,984 --> 00:04:19,725
where there you'll have to feed them, give them sermons,

76
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:22,687
and most importantly, clean up their shit.

77
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:31,936
In gameplay, it's a crossover between a roguelike dungeon crawler and a farm management sim.

78
00:04:32,476 --> 00:04:37,297
It's kind of like a messed up Animal Crossing, but more realistic because you can't buy a house.

79
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:45,179
We launched on PC, Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox last August, and I started working with

80
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:46,939
the team one month before launch.

81
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,520
The game is published by Devolver Digital.

82
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:55,159
And I guess you're probably asking, how big is our cult?

83
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,844
Well, this is our Twitter followers.

84
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:02,348
And if you look at this, I think we might be the biggest cult in the world.

85
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:11,670
Here are some stats from the first three months

86
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,690
from when I started working on Cult of the Lamb.

87
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,151
Twitter followers passed 150,000,

88
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:21,032
TikTok over 200,000, and Discord over 60,000.

89
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:25,833
And that pink blob is the game's revenue in that time.

90
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:30,974
I took out the left axis labels,

91
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:32,574
so you don't exactly know how much it is.

92
00:05:32,974 --> 00:05:35,755
But yes, the social numbers, they sound very big,

93
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:39,396
but really they're just a small impact on the game's success.

94
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:43,678
In 10 days after launch, we sold 1 million copies,

95
00:05:44,138 --> 00:05:47,900
and by the end of 2022, reached gold status on Steam for new releases,

96
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,901
alongside the PC versions of games like Persona 4,

97
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:53,462
God of War, Spider-Man, Final Fantasy VII Remake.

98
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:56,744
But really, all of that, that did not come from nowhere.

99
00:05:57,084 --> 00:05:59,905
Massive Monster has been making games for over a decade,

100
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,927
starting with Flash, and then moving to PC and consoles.

101
00:06:03,347 --> 00:06:06,669
And in that time, they really struggled hard to eventually reach

102
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:08,529
this big success that they've reached now.

103
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,611
After so many years of working and making games, they finally hit something big.

104
00:06:13,192 --> 00:06:16,973
And right now, I'd just like to take a moment to congratulate the Art Director of

105
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:19,175
Massive Monster, James Pearmain, who's here with us.

106
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:27,699
It's such an amazing achievement to work all those years with a small team to reach this

107
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,741
point and giving me the chance to speak on behalf of the team here.

108
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:32,716
Thank you, James.

109
00:06:33,962 --> 00:06:34,532
Thank you.

110
00:06:35,382 --> 00:06:37,525
Before we get into the weeds of the talk,

111
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:40,624
I'm going to give you the big takeaway right at the start.

112
00:06:41,145 --> 00:06:44,006
So if you remember one thing from this talk, this is it.

113
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:44,966
It's the next slide.

114
00:06:45,026 --> 00:06:47,847
Pay attention right now and you don't have to pay attention for the rest.

115
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,968
Games go viral.

116
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:55,511
And what I mean by that is that the biggest factor to selling your game is your game.

117
00:06:58,192 --> 00:06:58,932
Take a photo.

118
00:06:58,932 --> 00:06:59,682
Nice.

119
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,762
We're not talking about if your game is good,

120
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:06,336
because there's really so many good games out there,

121
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:09,077
and good is subjective, and like, who really knows what's good?

122
00:07:09,903 --> 00:07:14,060
And really, you're even competing with every other thing that someone could do in their life.

123
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,222
As Nick said earlier this week, touching grass is better than most games.

124
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:20,463
And I wholeheartedly agree.

125
00:07:20,903 --> 00:07:22,263
So you really got to ask yourself,

126
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:24,624
is your game truly outstanding?

127
00:07:24,664 --> 00:07:27,665
And by that I mean, does your game stand out?

128
00:07:28,005 --> 00:07:30,566
How does it compare to not just every other game out there,

129
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:32,087
which is already so many things,

130
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:35,028
but every other thing that someone could be doing in their lives?

131
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:36,788
That's literally what you're competing with

132
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:38,849
when we're talking about trying to get someone to play

133
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:40,530
whatever little game that you're working on.

134
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:46,238
The biggest factor behind Cult of the Lamb's success is the work of these guys.

135
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:50,980
They weren't thinking at the start, how can our game go viral?

136
00:07:51,581 --> 00:07:55,083
They were thinking, how can our game be fun and memorable?

137
00:07:55,563 --> 00:07:58,885
And along the way, they made something that I think did all of that.

138
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,941
I think the keyword there is memorable.

139
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:08,623
There's an old marketing rule of thumb called the seven touch points, where it takes an

140
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:12,825
average of seven touch points for a potential buyer to make a purchasing decision.

141
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:14,786
And what is a touch point?

142
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:19,788
Well, here are some examples, but basically it's any time someone encounters your thing,

143
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:23,950
in this case, your game, or in our case today, our cult.

144
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:28,470
Whenever, anytime they see anything related to it,

145
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,452
so whether that's on a store shelf or a physical product

146
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:34,754
or on a billboard or on a radio ad for the boomers

147
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:39,497
or on social media or someone is telling you about it

148
00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:40,917
or your friend is telling you about it,

149
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,779
all of those are possible touch points.

150
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,061
And each time they see your thing,

151
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:48,002
whether that's through a streamer or an article

152
00:08:48,022 --> 00:08:50,503
or on social media, they're one step closer

153
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:52,084
to potentially buying your thing.

154
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:57,377
That's why at Devolver we try to push all of these channels as much as possible

155
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,019
so that we get as many touch points into people's eyes

156
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,120
and eventually maybe they will buy something.

157
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,443
There are so many channels to pursue and whether you're a small indie

158
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:08,744
or you're from a big publisher or a big company,

159
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:10,905
I'm pretty sure you're probably thinking,

160
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:15,428
how do we find which of these channels is the best ones to aim for?

161
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:19,670
Which ones is the best one to allocate our limited time, money, and budget?

162
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:24,475
So, I'm going to tell you a bit about my little corner, which is social media.

163
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,976
There's definitely certain benefits to using it as one of your primary channels.

164
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:31,777
Number one, it's low cost compared to some of the other ones,

165
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:34,598
because anyone can post something for free.

166
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:37,458
Number two, it has exponential potential.

167
00:09:37,798 --> 00:09:40,139
It's built upon people interacting and resharing,

168
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,820
and those things are inherently built into these platforms.

169
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,602
And number three, since it's built on those connections, it's kind of like a pseudo word of mouth.

170
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:51,010
When you see your friend retweet something,

171
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,954
then that's a pseudo endorsement from them about whatever they've just retweeted.

172
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:57,966
And you have a bit of that trust, and if any marketing people here will know,

173
00:09:58,046 --> 00:10:00,707
word of mouth is by far the strongest touchpoint that you can have.

174
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:07,350
So, you're probably also wondering, does social media actually convert to anything?

175
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:12,244
For example, if I somehow win the lottery with a viral post,

176
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,367
will it actually lead to tangible sales or wish lists

177
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:16,808
or whatever kind of metric you're looking at?

178
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:21,753
Well, the answer is sometimes.

179
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:23,074
Definitely not always.

180
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:26,257
The secret to big sales is making an outstanding game,

181
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:27,037
like I said before.

182
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:31,130
But that doesn't always mean having a very unique art style

183
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,363
or the best game or awards or anything like that.

184
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:38,016
Here's an example that I love, Vampire Survivors.

185
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:41,737
It is outstandingly fun to play.

186
00:10:42,218 --> 00:10:45,119
It keeps people in Steam and spending money on Steam,

187
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,500
so then Steam keeps pushing it to more people.

188
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,481
Sales platforms, they make money

189
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:51,281
when things are sold on their platform,

190
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:53,382
so then their algorithms promote things

191
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:54,703
that are more likely to sell.

192
00:10:55,043 --> 00:10:56,083
It's really that simple.

193
00:10:56,544 --> 00:10:58,344
So then if they're pushing you,

194
00:10:58,704 --> 00:11:01,886
then you get a sale, you get your portion,

195
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:03,186
they get their cut, and...

196
00:11:03,887 --> 00:11:06,435
People are happy, except for the people who didn't get sales, sorry.

197
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:12,294
So another question, how can I be outstanding?

198
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:15,036
Outstanding doesn't have to be entirely new.

199
00:11:16,277 --> 00:11:18,139
I think we can all think of lots of games

200
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,282
that release very similar versions every single year.

201
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:24,604
And they may not even be the best of their genre.

202
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:26,866
But what they can provide is something outstanding,

203
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,828
whether that's the brand name, whether it's

204
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:30,369
the community of players, whether it's

205
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,271
their friends that play with that specific game,

206
00:11:32,331 --> 00:11:34,818
whether it's familiarity, because things actually don't change.

207
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:37,215
And all of these are ways that you can stand out.

208
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:42,173
So back to the question, does social media convert?

209
00:11:42,653 --> 00:11:43,253
I love this meme.

210
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:47,855
Posting on social media can definitely feel like this,

211
00:11:47,935 --> 00:11:50,876
especially if you're an indie dev, where

212
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:53,076
your tweets, anything you're posting,

213
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:54,437
even if it can get some traction,

214
00:11:54,517 --> 00:11:56,558
it's just within the space of other people

215
00:11:56,598 --> 00:11:57,598
who are developers.

216
00:11:58,098 --> 00:12:00,939
And if you're a developer, you don't have time to play games,

217
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,240
so they probably won't sell anyways.

218
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:08,881
And there are studios that have sizable social media followings that don't really translate to sales.

219
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:14,187
Like I can say at Devolver, we have over 300,000 Twitter followers, 200,000 YouTube subscribers,

220
00:12:14,388 --> 00:12:18,532
and I can also tell you that we do not sell hundreds of thousands of units with every release.

221
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,462
But there are examples of games getting significant boosts from social media.

222
00:12:25,282 --> 00:12:26,643
This is from Exo One.

223
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:31,444
It's a really, really cool solo developed game where you play as a disc flying

224
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:33,005
through these crazy planets in space.

225
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:36,846
And with the help of future friends, they had some pretty big TikToks that

226
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:38,546
converted to wishlist spikes.

227
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:42,108
And some of those spikes were comparable to the numbers they got from like

228
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:46,169
things like going to Gamescom or having like announcing their release date.

229
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:51,543
Thomas and Grace from Future Friends are giving talks this afternoon so you can learn from

230
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:55,012
them and their strategies for marketing and TikTok in particular.

231
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,097
This is another example.

232
00:12:58,117 --> 00:12:59,901
This is like one that's really big.

233
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,721
This is Tiny Glade, which if you've seen, if you are on Twitter or on

234
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:06,784
TikTok, you've almost definitely seen this game.

235
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:10,507
This is a graph of tiny glades and newsletter subscribers.

236
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:14,290
And you can see there are huge spikes correlating with viral

237
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,991
TikTok videos and viral tweets.

238
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:21,310
And they've only had their steam page online for just a few months, but in that time,

239
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,430
they've earned over 250,000 wishlists

240
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,742
and entered Steam's top 100 upcoming wishlist games.

241
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:30,427
Which is like a few months for a tiny developed game.

242
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:32,771
I think it's developed by two people. That's ridiculous.

243
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,142
And finally, this is from Hypercharge, a two-year-old game

244
00:13:37,142 --> 00:13:40,371
that got a bunch of new life after they went viral on Twitter last summer.

245
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:42,492
And there's other examples too.

246
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:48,393
We can think of something like Choo Choo Charles or Trombone Champ, all that have released

247
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:50,705
very recently and are relatively small games,

248
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,914
and they got most of their buzz through social media.

249
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:57,635
So there are examples of social media playing a big role in game success.

250
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,133
But social media is just one of these channels.

251
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:05,916
At Devolver, we try to leverage all of the channels as best as we can.

252
00:14:06,557 --> 00:14:11,601
Cult of the Lamp had a truly astounding reception from influencers

253
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:15,390
through a strategy from our senior influencer strategist, Clara Sia.

254
00:14:16,165 --> 00:14:20,588
As well as a truly awesome Twitch integration made by Streaming Toolsmith,

255
00:14:20,648 --> 00:14:24,529
who has been around at GDC if you want to work with him to implement Twitch integration.

256
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,951
It was also at things like Summer Games Fest.

257
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:29,612
We brought it to PAX East last year.

258
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:31,293
It's at PAX East this year right now.

259
00:14:31,713 --> 00:14:32,953
It was in Steam Next Fest.

260
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:38,996
But all of these contributed to what the game's marketing was.

261
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:43,068
And all of them came together to support, most importantly,

262
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:45,869
an outstanding game made by Massive Monster.

263
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:50,191
And yes, my little corner of that big equation is just social media.

264
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:51,711
So that's what I'm going to talk about.

265
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,093
We're talking here about attention.

266
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:57,033
Attention is marketing currency.

267
00:14:57,113 --> 00:15:00,174
And like I said before, people have limited time and attention in their lives.

268
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:02,215
You're competing with any other thing that someone could do.

269
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:06,296
So how are you going to make the most of whatever tiny bit of attention they might give you?

270
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:10,555
And these are my three steps of content design.

271
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:13,757
Number one, grab attention for discovery.

272
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:16,819
Number two, convert attention into interest.

273
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,160
And number three, reward attention

274
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,761
with an emotional response.

275
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,883
I'm going to go into detail about each of these,

276
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:26,505
as well as talking about how the original design

277
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:29,187
by the Massive Monster guys played into this,

278
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:33,650
and then how I try to implement these on Twitter, TikTok,

279
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,091
and then how it applies to even the Steam store page.

280
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:37,552
So anywhere they can see your thing.

281
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,294
These are things that you should be thinking about.

282
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,819
So number one, grab attention for discovery.

283
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,161
Start your own cult.

284
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,124
I think that is pretty attention grabbing for a game.

285
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:53,447
Before they click on your thing, before they watch your thing,

286
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:55,408
when someone is just scrolling down their timeline,

287
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:57,130
what actually grabs their attention?

288
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,272
What grabs your attention when you're scrolling down the timeline?

289
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:01,634
What makes you stop and read or watch?

290
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:06,897
Some things that usually work are things like eye-catching visuals or surprising messages.

291
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:08,558
Here's one of my examples.

292
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:12,259
Cults of the Lamb does not support hashtag national boyfriend day.

293
00:16:12,619 --> 00:16:16,201
Why have one boyfriend when you can have several spouses?

294
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:22,804
So, I try to get into what I call a noob mindset.

295
00:16:23,144 --> 00:16:27,006
What does it look like to someone who doesn't know anything about your game?

296
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,225
Because if they already know about your game, then you probably don't...

297
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:33,613
You do kind of need to sell it to them, because maybe they haven't bought it yet.

298
00:16:33,954 --> 00:16:37,522
But more importantly, how do you make it visible to people who have no idea what it is?

299
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:42,428
So, Massive Monster, they thought about this idea

300
00:16:42,488 --> 00:16:43,588
of a four-word pitch.

301
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:46,648
Their previous two games were 2D platformers

302
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:48,149
where you play as a little guy.

303
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:51,229
They weren't bad games, but you could probably tell

304
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:53,190
that that concept doesn't really stand out.

305
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,550
They came up, instead, they came up with an idea

306
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,451
of merging two popular genres, roguelike and base building.

307
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:03,811
And with that in mind, they tried to build a player fantasy

308
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:05,672
around that core gameplay loop.

309
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:07,892
The fantasy had to be unique.

310
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,681
Appealing and easy to explain.

311
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,942
And they actually originally had a pitch in 2019

312
00:17:15,262 --> 00:17:20,325
which had a very complex, a much more complex player fantasy.

313
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:22,906
And instead, eventually they got to this point

314
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:25,787
where they thought about how easy to explain could it be?

315
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:27,828
Could it even fit within four words?

316
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:29,312
Yes.

317
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:32,853
What about start your own hell or start a witch's coven

318
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:35,327
and then finally landing on start your own cult?

319
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:38,514
Can you explain what you're working on in just four words?

320
00:17:42,316 --> 00:17:45,017
So here are some examples. We're going to watch some TikToks.

321
00:17:47,418 --> 00:17:49,258
Have you ever considered joining a cult?

322
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:53,880
It's a great place to make friends, have fun, and eat some tasty food.

323
00:17:55,931 --> 00:17:58,752
There's a few folks who don't really agree with how we do things,

324
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:02,614
but that's why we show them love to change their minds.

325
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:03,615
Or else.

326
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,497
You can play Cults of the Lem right now on all consoles and PC.

327
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:09,418
Yeah, nice.

328
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:11,609
Let's watch this other one.

329
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:14,570
Sometimes you gotta deal with followers who are trying to trick your cultists.

330
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:19,213
Talk to them, put them in jail, or maybe use them as a ritual sacrifice.

331
00:18:19,373 --> 00:18:21,474
And here on TikTok, watch out, there's a scammer.

332
00:18:21,574 --> 00:18:24,056
They're messaging people, telling them they won the giveaway,

333
00:18:24,076 --> 00:18:25,497
and asking them to click a link.

334
00:18:25,657 --> 00:18:28,118
Don't click the link. We aren't sending anything like that.

335
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:32,841
Yeah, if anyone has done a giveaway on TikTok, you know about those scammers.

336
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:34,382
Okay.

337
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:38,104
Sometimes you gotta deal with...

338
00:18:38,304 --> 00:18:38,994
Okay.

339
00:18:40,655 --> 00:18:43,136
That is what I feel like when I'm browsing TikTok.

340
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:48,097
So when you're thinking about discovery on TikTok,

341
00:18:48,237 --> 00:18:50,637
and really discovery anywhere, the first question

342
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:54,478
is who might see your thing on this platform?

343
00:18:55,338 --> 00:18:58,059
In this case, it's people who trend younger.

344
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:59,859
And it might sound stupid, but it's

345
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,880
people who already use TikTok.

346
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,120
But what I mean by that is that they

347
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,381
have certain contextual expectations for what

348
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:07,841
they come across on the app.

349
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:11,137
And then next, how will they see your content?

350
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:14,379
TikTok videos automatically show up in your For You page,

351
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,702
and people don't really browse or watch based on who they're already following.

352
00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:21,523
And then finally, what will they actually see?

353
00:19:21,904 --> 00:19:26,166
The video will just start playing, and now your job is to keep them from swiping away.

354
00:19:26,486 --> 00:19:28,743
So yeah, think about these three things

355
00:19:28,743 --> 00:19:31,486
on any kind of platform that you're trying to post anything.

356
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,141
Another here...

357
00:19:34,101 --> 00:19:36,421
Oh, sorry, before we move on, you can see on that retention rate,

358
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:38,133
that was from the second video we watched,

359
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:43,644
 more than 25, about 25% of people stopped watching after two seconds.

360
00:19:44,024 --> 00:19:48,465
So that's how much time that you have to convince someone to keep watching your video.

361
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,127
And two seconds is already pretty long.

362
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:54,307
Steam discovery.

363
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:57,008
So once again, we're thinking, who is on this platform?

364
00:19:58,051 --> 00:20:00,033
On Steam, you know it's someone who already plays games.

365
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:01,594
They're playing on PC.

366
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:04,556
And they are looking for more games to play.

367
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:08,481
Most people on Steam are not looking for more new games to play.

368
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,201
So you don't really need to think about them.

369
00:20:11,621 --> 00:20:13,543
So these are the people you're thinking about.

370
00:20:13,823 --> 00:20:15,384
And then how can they see your content?

371
00:20:15,904 --> 00:20:17,546
There's algorithmic recommendations,

372
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:21,028
things that say games you might like or try these.

373
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:22,730
Steam has stuff like that.

374
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,051
And then also on the front page, if you're

375
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:27,173
lucky enough to get there or right at your launch time.

376
00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:30,555
And then, what will they actually see when they get there?

377
00:20:31,135 --> 00:20:31,916
So let's take a look.

378
00:20:32,336 --> 00:20:35,778
This is from the fall when Little Gator Game had just released.

379
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,221
So on the left side, that is what you would see on your Steam page without even scrolling over

380
00:20:42,261 --> 00:20:46,984
anything. So look what we have to work with. We have the capsule art, we have the title,

381
00:20:47,404 --> 00:20:54,228
we have the platform, we have four tags, and then we have the price and the sale.

382
00:20:54,648 --> 00:20:56,806
So like that rectangle

383
00:20:56,806 --> 00:20:59,019
is all you have to try to convince someone

384
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:01,854
to even hover over your game, to consider it at all.

385
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:04,203
And then if you do manage to convince someone to hover,

386
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:05,817
then that's where you get the thing on the right,

387
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:10,027
where now we get to see the number of reviews, the overall rating,

388
00:21:10,027 --> 00:21:11,761
we have one extra tag now,

389
00:21:12,102 --> 00:21:14,687
and three screenshots, or a few screenshots.

390
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:17,265
So that is the kind of stuff that we're talking about,

391
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:20,110
of how can you grab someone's attention with just that.

392
00:21:20,552 --> 00:21:23,290
It's almost nothing, and that is how hard

393
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,071
it is to get yourself seen and discovered.

394
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:30,170
Next, convert attention into interest.

395
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,212
So at this point, you've grabbed their attention.

396
00:21:33,672 --> 00:21:36,794
How do you keep them looking and what are you trying to do with the attention?

397
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:40,737
What are you going to, what kind of memory are you going to leave them with?

398
00:21:41,277 --> 00:21:44,200
And that's something that the Massive Monster guys really thought about

399
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,041
in what they called trailer moments.

400
00:21:46,341 --> 00:21:50,603
These are moments that they animated and put in the game that look very, very impressive.

401
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,558
Moments that people will remember,

402
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:55,065
moments that show something interesting about the game.

403
00:21:55,665 --> 00:21:58,827
This is probably one of the more iconic ones that people remember.

404
00:21:58,887 --> 00:22:01,448
If you've played Cult of the Lamb, this is the sacrifice ritual.

405
00:22:01,928 --> 00:22:05,976
There's a part of the game where the game actually makes you do at least one of these,

406
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:06,810
so you can see it.

407
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:09,552
And you can see it's like less than 10 seconds.

408
00:22:09,712 --> 00:22:12,094
And how much time do you think you worked on it, James?

409
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,454
A lot of time, right?

410
00:22:16,272 --> 00:22:17,093
I think he said years.

411
00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:20,196
But yeah, it just looks so memorable.

412
00:22:20,776 --> 00:22:25,921
Also, it kind of plays with expectations where if you think of a cult sacrifice,

413
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:29,204
you might think of someone at an altar in a robe and like with a dagger.

414
00:22:29,484 --> 00:22:31,666
But nah, let's take this up several levels.

415
00:22:31,706 --> 00:22:33,848
We've got this tentacle monster coming out of the ground.

416
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:35,350
That is the trailer moment.

417
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,831
And a trailer moment is good because, well, they were thinking,

418
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:40,893
how can we put this in a trailer so then it would look good there?

419
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:43,274
And then that also applies to social media.

420
00:22:43,515 --> 00:22:45,236
It's something that within just a few seconds,

421
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:47,777
it catches attention and teaches something about this game.

422
00:22:48,137 --> 00:22:51,659
Also, you can see that there's a cute animal, which everyone loves cute animals.

423
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,983
Next, we have support the fantasy.

424
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:57,046
So this is another thing that the guys thought about.

425
00:22:57,847 --> 00:22:59,729
They started brainstorming different mechanics

426
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:01,351
to add on top of the gameplay loop.

427
00:23:01,972 --> 00:23:03,754
And they were trying to support the fantasy

428
00:23:03,894 --> 00:23:06,538
of start your own cult of cute animals.

429
00:23:06,658 --> 00:23:08,661
So always going back to that fantasy

430
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:09,802
and that forward pitch.

431
00:23:11,017 --> 00:23:13,012
And anything that didn't support that fantasy,

432
00:23:13,012 --> 00:23:16,121
it was cut as soon as they realized that it didn't.

433
00:23:16,581 --> 00:23:19,143
So James was watching John Wick one day,

434
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:23,206
and he realized in John Wick that everything in that world is around assassins.

435
00:23:23,507 --> 00:23:26,569
Keanu Reeves is an assassin, all the people he fights are assassins,

436
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:29,291
like the whole world building is all around assassins.

437
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:32,394
And that's where they started to build a world around cults.

438
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:36,937
The bosses are bishops, the enemies are other cultists,

439
00:23:37,097 --> 00:23:39,559
there's religious imagery like everywhere in the game.

440
00:23:40,632 --> 00:23:45,813
Even something like the lamb is a religious connotation to connect to this world of cults.

441
00:23:47,054 --> 00:23:49,554
And I love this animation that James made.

442
00:23:49,814 --> 00:23:55,196
This is for one of the bosses, this boss transformation where you get to see a bishop

443
00:23:55,256 --> 00:23:58,957
is someone who you might expect to be kind of conservative, dressed in these robes, and

444
00:23:58,977 --> 00:24:04,098
then it becomes this huge, crazy, scary monster, and each of the bishop bosses do this.

445
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,079
So on Twitter...

446
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:11,772
If you've grabbed their attention at least enough to stop scrolling,

447
00:24:12,093 --> 00:24:14,134
then now can you convert it to information

448
00:24:14,134 --> 00:24:16,381
to teach someone about something about your game?

449
00:24:17,596 --> 00:24:21,657
So once again, we fall back to this National Boyfriend Day tweet,

450
00:24:22,217 --> 00:24:24,638
but I think it's pretty interesting because it doesn't just...

451
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:27,958
it's not just funny and it's not just provocative,

452
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:30,419
but also shows something about the game.

453
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:34,260
Cult of the Lamb is one of the few games where you can marry a bunch of cultists.

454
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,940
So once again, we're going back to supporting that fantasy.

455
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,301
And then the visuals, I quickly go...

456
00:24:39,701 --> 00:24:43,902
like only show at least half a second of a bunch of different animals that you can marry.

457
00:24:45,082 --> 00:24:46,963
So both of these things, now we're not just...

458
00:24:47,523 --> 00:24:51,090
We're not just provoking someone, we're not just instigating a funny initial reaction,

459
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,398
but we're also trying to teach someone about this unique mechanic that our game has that

460
00:24:55,438 --> 00:24:56,981
makes it stand out to other games.

461
00:24:58,464 --> 00:24:59,145
And on TikTok...

462
00:25:00,276 --> 00:25:02,878
So when we're thinking about converting someone's attention,

463
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:06,461
sometimes it might be, the end goal might be different

464
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:08,203
depending on whatever platform you're on.

465
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:10,324
On a discovery platform like TikTok,

466
00:25:10,605 --> 00:25:12,226
so a place where your primary goal

467
00:25:12,306 --> 00:25:14,368
is to tell new people about the game,

468
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:18,051
then my goal is to get that content

469
00:25:18,091 --> 00:25:20,233
into as many people's eyes as possible.

470
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:22,615
So how does TikTok work?

471
00:25:23,035 --> 00:25:24,576
How does it show new content to people?

472
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,499
Videos show up in your For You page.

473
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:32,302
You can do po- and when, let's say I'm watching and something shows up, I can do

474
00:25:32,402 --> 00:25:34,103
a positive or a negative engagement.

475
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:39,185
Positive engagements are things like likes, favorites, shares, comments, or

476
00:25:39,225 --> 00:25:40,506
just watching the whole thing through.

477
00:25:40,786 --> 00:25:44,228
And then negative engagements are swiping away before the video is done.

478
00:25:44,488 --> 00:25:48,850
And you can also, uh, like hold tap and say that you don't like videos like this.

479
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,831
And then the For You page will populate with videos that

480
00:25:51,871 --> 00:25:53,252
match your positive engagements.

481
00:25:53,572 --> 00:25:58,459
So let's say I'm really into dogs and I really want to watch only dog videos.

482
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,182
So I'll open TikTok, a video will show up.

483
00:26:01,402 --> 00:26:03,125
Is it a dog video? Nope, I swipe away.

484
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:05,027
Is it a dog video? Nope, I swipe away.

485
00:26:05,087 --> 00:26:05,888
Is it a dog? Oh yes!

486
00:26:05,968 --> 00:26:07,110
Then now I watch the whole thing.

487
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,853
I like, I comment, I do all these things.

488
00:26:09,873 --> 00:26:11,255
I do the positive engagements.

489
00:26:11,515 --> 00:26:11,796
And even...

490
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:15,978
just by watching the whole thing, that's a very good positive engagement, which we'll see soon.

491
00:26:16,418 --> 00:26:21,046
And now my feed will slowly add more and more videos about dogs

492
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,606
and less and less videos that aren't about dogs,

493
00:26:23,606 --> 00:26:27,664
but it will also give you videos that the algorithm thinks that people

494
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:30,134
who like dogs also like this kind of video.

495
00:26:31,272 --> 00:26:33,767
So that's how TikTok works, and now we're trying

496
00:26:33,787 --> 00:26:36,448
to design content for the platform's goal.

497
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:38,766
What animals should we put in our game?

498
00:26:38,826 --> 00:26:40,707
There's so many different ones to add to your cult.

499
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:44,148
Cats, pigs, frogs, buffalo, Cthulhu.

500
00:26:44,248 --> 00:26:45,049
But now I need your help.

501
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:48,270
Should we add a badger or a lion?

502
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,751
Drop a comment if you're a badger baddie

503
00:26:50,991 --> 00:26:52,392
or if you're a simpin' for Simba.

504
00:26:55,687 --> 00:26:58,748
So yeah, you can see here we're, what you might call,

505
00:26:58,828 --> 00:27:01,489
engagement farming, giving them two options,

506
00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:03,890
very easy choice that you can put a comment.

507
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:07,451
And also in this case, trying to engage someone

508
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:09,651
to be involved with our creative process in the game.

509
00:27:10,052 --> 00:27:12,152
So I probably did this incorrectly,

510
00:27:12,192 --> 00:27:13,673
where I actually put two animals

511
00:27:13,713 --> 00:27:14,793
that weren't already in the game.

512
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:17,234
But then from the comments, we saw many comments

513
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:19,875
asking for things like axolotls or capybaras,

514
00:27:20,135 --> 00:27:21,735
which are very popular among young people.

515
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:26,599
And it turns out that James and the team had already made those characters

516
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:27,753
and they were already in the game.

517
00:27:28,093 --> 00:27:30,017
So then I could make another video saying,

518
00:27:30,498 --> 00:27:32,962
ah, like reply to this comment that's asked for axolotls.

519
00:27:33,282 --> 00:27:35,125
Here is your axolotl. We are listening.

520
00:27:37,143 --> 00:27:40,084
And then by doing that basically many times,

521
00:27:40,824 --> 00:27:42,825
every single video would get hundreds of comments

522
00:27:43,185 --> 00:27:46,367
of people asking to add a specific animal.

523
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:48,508
And even if I was talking about some other topic

524
00:27:48,568 --> 00:27:51,309
like the combat or about the farming,

525
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:53,650
then I would start the video by replying

526
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,151
to someone's comment asking for a deer.

527
00:27:55,431 --> 00:27:57,512
I'd say like, hello, FlameMaster69,

528
00:27:57,772 --> 00:27:59,913
you can be the deer in our cult.

529
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,433
And I put him in and then I...

530
00:28:03,174 --> 00:28:04,553
And then I would talk about the farming,

531
00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:07,336
I would like make him do farming, and then now we're teaching about the game.

532
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:09,929
We start from this thing that farms engagement,

533
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:11,899
and then we teach about the game from there.

534
00:28:14,021 --> 00:28:16,785
So I also did a study last year

535
00:28:16,785 --> 00:28:20,645
to try to find which positive engagements were the most valuable

536
00:28:20,705 --> 00:28:21,944
in TikTok's algorithm.

537
00:28:21,944 --> 00:28:27,749
I got data from 1500, oh 1500 videos from game studios who were promoting

538
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:31,352
their games on TikTok organically, so that's without ad spend.

539
00:28:31,352 --> 00:28:33,153
The videos from these channels

540
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:36,088
had a sum of over 70 million views

541
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:38,936
and they ranged from accounts with just a few thousand followers

542
00:28:39,016 --> 00:28:41,464
to over 1 million followers.

543
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:42,859
And what did I find?

544
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:47,424
Firstly, I looked at the active engagements that I mentioned before,

545
00:28:47,784 --> 00:28:49,926
so the likes, comments, shares, and favorites,

546
00:28:49,986 --> 00:28:52,109
and I tried to correlate that with the number of views.

547
00:28:52,629 --> 00:28:55,292
From there, we found that likes and favorites

548
00:28:55,392 --> 00:28:56,973
had the highest correlation,

549
00:28:57,294 --> 00:28:59,896
whereas comments had a moderate correlation

550
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:01,038
and shares had the fewest.

551
00:29:01,498 --> 00:29:05,022
But really, is that correlation or causation?

552
00:29:05,402 --> 00:29:08,385
So then I looked at another metric, watch time.

553
00:29:10,134 --> 00:29:14,909
And what I found was videos with more views had higher watch time

554
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:16,901
and higher full watch percentage.

555
00:29:17,181 --> 00:29:22,090
And there was a bit of a stratification where I tried to separate the videos that had

556
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:27,306
at least 250,000 or 100,000 views and then see, you can see there that...

557
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:31,158
There's a big difference between the smaller videos in the sample

558
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:34,622
versus the bigger videos in the sample that have much higher average watch time

559
00:29:34,662 --> 00:29:36,665
and much higher average full watch percentage.

560
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:40,870
Another thing I found was in that right graph that...

561
00:29:42,797 --> 00:29:47,679
Almost all videos with over 100,000 views had at least 10 seconds average watch time.

562
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:52,781
So now I try to make videos that have at least 10 seconds, that are at least 10 seconds long.

563
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:55,882
So if they watch the whole thing, they're positively helping in the algorithm.

564
00:29:56,322 --> 00:30:01,444
But there's a big caveat that no one really knows what TikTok's algorithm actually does

565
00:30:01,524 --> 00:30:02,385
and it always changes.

566
00:30:02,645 --> 00:30:07,987
They also have revealed that they have more ability to manually boost certain kinds of

567
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:09,547
videos versus other kinds of videos.

568
00:30:10,368 --> 00:30:10,848
So...

569
00:30:10,848 --> 00:30:11,869
Who knows?

570
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:14,010
TikTok barely even knows themselves, actually.

571
00:30:16,372 --> 00:30:17,392
And now, on Steam.

572
00:30:17,853 --> 00:30:21,395
So, Steam, obviously, is a platform where someone can actually do that final conversion

573
00:30:21,415 --> 00:30:23,817
that you're looking for, whether that's a sale or a wishlist.

574
00:30:24,772 --> 00:30:28,634
So in this case, now we're at the final part of the funnel,

575
00:30:28,915 --> 00:30:31,216
and we're trying to teach someone about the game enough

576
00:30:31,236 --> 00:30:33,938
to convince them to actually make that purchase.

577
00:30:34,198 --> 00:30:35,299
So what do you have to work with?

578
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:38,121
By default, now Steam Broadcasts show up at the top.

579
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:40,743
Then there's a trailer that would play if you scroll down,

580
00:30:40,803 --> 00:30:42,744
the key art, description, screenshots,

581
00:30:42,824 --> 00:30:44,686
the actual body of your description.

582
00:30:46,395 --> 00:30:48,724
And when I look at a new Steam page,

583
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:52,062
I literally just scroll down and I see what kind of impression

584
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:54,024
do I get from a very quick glance.

585
00:30:54,465 --> 00:30:58,630
So that is the attention that you're trying to convince someone to buy your game with.

586
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:03,416
So what unique elements, what is the art style, what's the premise, what type of game it is.

587
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:08,458
But everyone has a different kind of way that they are looking at what is valuable to them.

588
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:11,720
Like one of my friends, he told me that when he looks at a Steam page,

589
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,601
the first thing he looks at are the tags.

590
00:31:13,861 --> 00:31:16,002
And if he doesn't see multiplayer or co-op,

591
00:31:16,262 --> 00:31:18,343
then he automatically just doesn't even look at it,

592
00:31:18,403 --> 00:31:20,004
because that's the kind of gamer he is,

593
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,866
that he only wants to play new games that he can play with his friends.

594
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:27,768
But at the same time, he still needs to get that information as quickly as possible.

595
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:34,090
If it's hard to find that information, then you probably wouldn't even go past that point,

596
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,411
get to that point, to try to be considerate to buy the game.

597
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,111
So once again, that is what you're trying to convey.

598
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:41,407
And I definitely see a lot of Steam pages

599
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:43,518
that don't really tell me what makes this game stand out.

600
00:31:45,353 --> 00:31:50,535
So finally, we're at reward attention with an emotional response.

601
00:31:51,517 --> 00:31:53,658
And we want to do this because if you have a touchpoint,

602
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:56,921
this person has given you their attention and time,

603
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,640
now if you can reward them with something

604
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,925
that makes them feel good or feel something,

605
00:32:01,225 --> 00:32:03,327
then it's going to be a more meaningful touchpoint.

606
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,509
They've actually looked at your thing.

607
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:08,571
What do you want them to remember? How do you want them to feel?

608
00:32:10,613 --> 00:32:14,416
So, we're talking about what do people expect with cults?

609
00:32:16,076 --> 00:32:19,218
Once again, we started at start your own cult of cute animals.

610
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:21,579
And the cute animals, that already doesn't go with cults.

611
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:22,580
That's a nice surprise.

612
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,262
That gets us to this interesting place of juxtaposition.

613
00:32:26,562 --> 00:32:29,083
And it also fit with Julian and James' art style.

614
00:32:29,143 --> 00:32:30,164
So it worked out really well.

615
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:32,725
They also chose a lamb as their main character

616
00:32:33,025 --> 00:32:34,826
to subvert religious connotations.

617
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:37,108
And throughout the game, there's these surprises

618
00:32:37,168 --> 00:32:39,449
and things that take what you expect of a cult.

619
00:32:39,729 --> 00:32:40,369
And sometimes...

620
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:45,744
Use it, maybe extending it, extrapolating it to the logical conclusion,

621
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:47,231
like that big tentacle monster,

622
00:32:47,491 --> 00:32:51,152
but also sometimes subverting it with the fact that everything is cute animals.

623
00:32:52,692 --> 00:32:55,072
And delight, you can delight through surprise.

624
00:32:55,532 --> 00:32:57,873
You can make someone laugh by being surprising.

625
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:03,034
Surprise is when unexpected things come together, and like, that's literally what a meme is.

626
00:33:03,254 --> 00:33:05,794
It's when you connect unexpected contexts together.

627
00:33:06,535 --> 00:33:07,067
But if...

628
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:10,352
Firstly, that someone actually has to have context.

629
00:33:10,372 --> 00:33:12,838
They need to have some sort of pre-existing connotation

630
00:33:12,838 --> 00:33:14,175
about whatever you're talking about.

631
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:16,837
So it's way easier if people already have context.

632
00:33:17,337 --> 00:33:17,898
Big Yoshi.

633
00:33:18,258 --> 00:33:20,160
We know that Yoshi doesn't typically look like this,

634
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,883
so it's funny because now Yoshi is in a funny situation.

635
00:33:24,423 --> 00:33:26,565
But if people don't know what your thing is,

636
00:33:27,926 --> 00:33:30,228
link it to a context that people will know.

637
00:33:30,668 --> 00:33:32,570
And I'm going to talk about a few ways you can do that.

638
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:35,933
There's concepts, there's trends, there's personal stories.

639
00:33:35,953 --> 00:33:36,573
There's many ways.

640
00:33:38,271 --> 00:33:40,473
Oh, sorry. I see pictures. I see pictures.

641
00:33:40,493 --> 00:33:42,555
If you want to look at a meme that does seem—

642
00:33:42,595 --> 00:33:43,155
I love that one.

643
00:33:44,476 --> 00:33:44,696
Okay.

644
00:33:45,897 --> 00:33:47,609
Okay, here we go!

645
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:52,423
Yeah, everyone admire.

646
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:53,304
You can see those—

647
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:54,965
Oh, I checked today.

648
00:33:55,145 --> 00:33:56,366
Now that bookmarks are visible,

649
00:33:56,446 --> 00:33:58,788
there's like 4,000 bookmarks on that right image.

650
00:34:03,246 --> 00:34:07,558
Yeah, so on the left one, you can see that we've taken this like celebratory post

651
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:09,472
where we have 100,000 followers.

652
00:34:09,492 --> 00:34:10,553
Like that's pretty normal, right?

653
00:34:10,593 --> 00:34:14,276
But then what if we kind of juxtapose that with a context that someone understands?

654
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:18,380
We're now comparing ourselves to Scientology, something that lots of people know about.

655
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,877
And there are even people who have like no, they don't really care about our game at all,

656
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:25,946
but they care about Scientology or like the stories behind it.

657
00:34:26,207 --> 00:34:28,288
And they were retweeting because it's a funny thing.

658
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:29,736
And on the right.

659
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:31,405
Yeah.

660
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,668
This is actually a fan art

661
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:38,853
after we started some Twitter beef with Angry Birds and Duolingo.

662
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:42,476
And yeah, we reposted the fan art, credited them in the first reply,

663
00:34:42,736 --> 00:34:45,878
but obviously that's something that you don't typically see on your timeline.

664
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:53,182
So, you can also link it to a concept that people do have an understanding about.

665
00:34:53,222 --> 00:34:55,123
This is when I worked on a game called Card Shark.

666
00:34:55,183 --> 00:34:57,885
It's a game about card cheating, which...

667
00:34:59,187 --> 00:35:00,368
Yeah, well, let's give it a shot.

668
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,233
Three ways to cheat without sleight of hand.

669
00:35:03,553 --> 00:35:04,895
Peek at cards while they're being dealt,

670
00:35:05,296 --> 00:35:06,558
make use of something shiny,

671
00:35:06,758 --> 00:35:08,360
or distract them with a cool drink.

672
00:35:09,061 --> 00:35:11,765
Do all these tricks and more in our new game, Card Shark.

673
00:35:12,538 --> 00:35:13,238
Ooh, OK.

674
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,100
Yeah, so this is an example.

675
00:35:15,721 --> 00:35:17,382
The game is quite hard to explain.

676
00:35:17,702 --> 00:35:21,826
The gameplay is really not like many other games out there.

677
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,488
It's like WarioWare, but then you're also gambling,

678
00:35:24,508 --> 00:35:26,469
and you're also in 18th century France.

679
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:28,391
So it's a very complex game to explain.

680
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,734
But I think everyone understands what cheating is.

681
00:35:32,154 --> 00:35:34,716
So by referencing it to this concept

682
00:35:34,756 --> 00:35:38,739
that people do understand, then now there's

683
00:35:38,779 --> 00:35:41,101
a link in to making it relevant to someone.

684
00:35:41,978 --> 00:35:43,179
And here's another.

685
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,474
I don't know why this keeps on happening.

686
00:35:44,474 --> 00:35:45,260
It doesn't play this.

687
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:45,980
Okay, here we go.

688
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,561
Okay, here we go.

689
00:35:47,561 --> 00:35:50,282
This is my work of viral.

690
00:36:07,004 --> 00:36:08,230
Okay, you don't have to do that.

691
00:36:11,817 --> 00:36:14,357
Another option is to link to a trend.

692
00:36:15,077 --> 00:36:17,786
So this lamb movie poster, uh,

693
00:36:17,786 --> 00:36:22,963
we dropped it like an hour or two after the Mario movie first trailer was posted.

694
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,561
And of course it has Chris Pratt in it because every big animated

695
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:28,701
movie needs to have Chris Pratt.

696
00:36:29,861 --> 00:36:34,202
And then the next day I made this fake lamb movie trailer using audio.

697
00:36:34,303 --> 00:36:34,463
Okay.

698
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,283
Well, you just watch it first.

699
00:36:48,442 --> 00:36:50,442
What is this place?

700
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:54,475
Here we come!

701
00:36:55,402 --> 00:36:56,482
Yeah, that's a good one.

702
00:36:57,022 --> 00:37:00,544
Yeah, you can see both of these tweets have over 100,000 likes on Twitter,

703
00:37:00,564 --> 00:37:01,204
which is pretty good.

704
00:37:02,685 --> 00:37:05,507
And both of these are actually repurposed assets.

705
00:37:05,867 --> 00:37:11,069
The poster on the left is a re-edited version of the illustrated art

706
00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:14,151
that was made for the vinyl of the game's soundtrack.

707
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:20,790
And on the right, that animation is from the first animated trailer of the game from 2021.

708
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:23,951
So it's repurposed in a new way.

709
00:37:24,436 --> 00:37:25,517
participate in a trend.

710
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,444
This is an example of how one asset can be used in many, many different ways.

711
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,981
Yeah, so if you start with something like that cutscene asset,

712
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:40,102
uh, sorry it's a little small, but um, yeah, you start with something like that cutscene asset

713
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:43,286
and then it can be a screenshot for a meme

714
00:37:43,286 --> 00:37:46,623
or in thumbnails or for your Steam news cover images

715
00:37:46,643 --> 00:37:48,534
because those are always really annoying to go find.

716
00:37:49,293 --> 00:37:52,449
It could be a short clip as a GIF for reactions

717
00:37:52,744 --> 00:37:56,885
or for social posts or you can put short clips together for TikToks or you can take the full

718
00:37:56,945 --> 00:37:59,025
version of the trailer and that can go, you can...

719
00:37:59,405 --> 00:38:01,027
go to a partner with that.

720
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:03,929
So it can be on the Nintendo's YouTube channel.

721
00:38:04,509 --> 00:38:08,012
Or one thing we did was we put all of the animated trailers

722
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,454
together, but just the animation parts, so no gameplay.

723
00:38:10,674 --> 00:38:13,156
And we put them into one video, put that on YouTube,

724
00:38:13,216 --> 00:38:15,198
and that also has hundreds of thousands of views.

725
00:38:15,518 --> 00:38:16,799
So just many, many different ways

726
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,242
that you can repurpose the same thing in different contexts.

727
00:38:22,276 --> 00:38:24,520
And did you know that you can anticipate trends?

728
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,684
If you aren't super on social media, or even if you are, you might be like,

729
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:29,187
oh, how do I participate in trends?

730
00:38:29,527 --> 00:38:31,951
Do I have to be watching Twitter all day?

731
00:38:31,991 --> 00:38:33,493
Like, I do that anyways, but.

732
00:38:35,307 --> 00:38:36,988
So you are your own target market.

733
00:38:37,268 --> 00:38:40,930
If you're making a game, that means you're probably interested in what the game is,

734
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:45,153
and you would be a potential fan if you weren't the person making the game.

735
00:38:45,593 --> 00:38:48,795
So your fans will be excited about what you're excited about,

736
00:38:49,155 --> 00:38:54,638
and that means that they will also be excited about the things that you are anticipating,

737
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:58,100
things like announcements or presentations or new releases

738
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,901
or whatever news that might come across your feed.

739
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:03,403
It's probably similar to your potential markets.

740
00:39:04,123 --> 00:39:06,215
So for that Mario trailer,

741
00:39:07,622 --> 00:39:10,548
Nintendo had announced like two days before that that they were going to

742
00:39:10,588 --> 00:39:13,464
drop the first Mario trailer on the Thursday.

743
00:39:13,796 --> 00:39:16,492
So I put it in my calendar, this Mario trailer time,

744
00:39:16,532 --> 00:39:21,676
this is going to be like all over Twitter for sure. And then right after we like watching it,

745
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:24,920
and then we're trying to think of what we can put that can relate to it.

746
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,959
And then make sure that

747
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,504
in both of our tweets we use the word movie.

748
00:39:28,504 --> 00:39:30,343
So it's participating in the trend.

749
00:39:30,483 --> 00:39:34,798
We're not referencing the Mario movie exactly,

750
00:39:34,798 --> 00:39:36,464
but we're participating in the trend.

751
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:38,638
We get in with that keyword,

752
00:39:38,638 --> 00:39:42,866
and we knew that it was going to happen because the announcement was made earlier.

753
00:39:45,106 --> 00:39:48,527
So, a lot of the time, the most important thing is framing.

754
00:39:49,007 --> 00:39:52,114
If you remember when GTA 6 leaked,

755
00:39:52,114 --> 00:39:56,268
and all sorts of devs on Twitter were quoting this guy who said,

756
00:39:56,589 --> 00:39:58,829
graphics are the first things finished in a video game.

757
00:40:00,015 --> 00:40:00,663
Yes, let's watch those.

758
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:30,750
Ooh, yeah, nice.

759
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:31,811
I love that video.

760
00:40:32,311 --> 00:40:35,373
So yeah, there is some guy who said,

761
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,434
graphics are the first thing finished in a video game.

762
00:40:37,694 --> 00:40:38,815
So we hopped on that trend.

763
00:40:39,135 --> 00:40:41,636
And this asset is, once again, a repurposed asset.

764
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:45,158
It was originally a much longer video

765
00:40:45,258 --> 00:40:49,941
posted by a person who was working on the social media

766
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:51,102
before I started working on it.

767
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,903
I changed that into this version

768
00:40:52,923 --> 00:40:54,024
where we had the split screen,

769
00:40:54,064 --> 00:40:55,524
so it's much more visually appealing

770
00:40:55,564 --> 00:40:57,285
and you can directly see the comparison.

771
00:41:00,032 --> 00:41:03,615
This exact video was first used before the game launched,

772
00:41:03,715 --> 00:41:05,937
and then a month later when this trend was happening,

773
00:41:06,037 --> 00:41:06,797
we just participated.

774
00:41:06,817 --> 00:41:08,238
I'm like, oh, I know this video is good.

775
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,460
I'm just going to use it again, frame it in a different way.

776
00:41:12,128 --> 00:41:14,071
And you may have heard earlier this week

777
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:17,313
that building your own brand or like selling yourself,

778
00:41:17,593 --> 00:41:20,896
your story, that that can be a really good way to gain visibility.

779
00:41:20,976 --> 00:41:21,657
And that's true.

780
00:41:22,778 --> 00:41:25,500
And that's because people can connect to personal stories.

781
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,778
It's another way that you can link something,

782
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:30,064
you can give someone context without them

783
00:41:30,144 --> 00:41:31,926
having to know about what your game is.

784
00:41:32,607 --> 00:41:35,367
The converse example of that is I think of,

785
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,799
let's say we're working on a game about giant mechs.

786
00:41:38,755 --> 00:41:42,616
And we make our mech do this funny TikTok dance.

787
00:41:42,896 --> 00:41:45,397
And to us, because we know that the mechs are very serious,

788
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:48,378
they're always in combat, that this mech is not supposed to do that.

789
00:41:48,718 --> 00:41:50,879
But then to someone else who doesn't know who this mech is,

790
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:53,440
it's not funny to just see a robot dancing.

791
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,341
It's kind of whatever.

792
00:41:54,701 --> 00:41:57,202
But then if, let's say, it's a Gundam,

793
00:41:57,262 --> 00:42:00,463
or let's say you reference Gundam in the captioning somehow,

794
00:42:00,783 --> 00:42:04,865
then now it becomes a context that someone could recognize.

795
00:42:05,854 --> 00:42:09,612
So yeah, people can connect to personal stories

796
00:42:09,612 --> 00:42:11,880
and it's a way that you can link to something

797
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,182
that someone actually does feel something about.

798
00:42:15,023 --> 00:42:18,426
So I suggest that you can do both of these at the same time.

799
00:42:18,706 --> 00:42:21,597
You can frame your messaging to both tell your own story

800
00:42:21,597 --> 00:42:23,283
and teach something about your game.

801
00:42:23,571 --> 00:42:26,197
And that's something that we tried to do here by going into the history,

802
00:42:26,197 --> 00:42:27,415
showing development,

803
00:42:28,196 --> 00:42:31,038
and at the same time connecting to some wider context.

804
00:42:32,877 --> 00:42:34,179
Oh, this keeps on happening.

805
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:35,880
Okay, recap time.

806
00:42:36,761 --> 00:42:37,262
Let's do it.

807
00:42:38,203 --> 00:42:40,666
So number one, games go viral.

808
00:42:40,986 --> 00:42:43,188
And what I mean by that is the biggest factor

809
00:42:43,248 --> 00:42:45,671
to sell your game is your game.

810
00:42:46,412 --> 00:42:48,715
And I know that everyone already took photos of this before,

811
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,199
because I asked you to.

812
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,821
And next, seven touch points.

813
00:42:54,121 --> 00:42:55,282
So there are many different channels

814
00:42:55,302 --> 00:42:56,462
that people could see your thing.

815
00:42:57,103 --> 00:42:58,883
Each of them, each time that they see it,

816
00:42:59,064 --> 00:43:01,725
they're becoming one step closer to potentially buying it.

817
00:43:02,025 --> 00:43:03,946
So our goal is to get it in front of them

818
00:43:04,046 --> 00:43:05,647
in as many different ways as possible

819
00:43:05,727 --> 00:43:07,107
and as many times as possible.

820
00:43:08,908 --> 00:43:10,649
Can social media convert?

821
00:43:11,249 --> 00:43:12,530
Yes, it doesn't always,

822
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:14,651
and there's definitely many examples of it not converting,

823
00:43:14,731 --> 00:43:17,552
but there are also many examples of it converting.

824
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:23,480
And when it comes to content design, the three things I think about are

825
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,821
grabbing attention for discovery.

826
00:43:26,141 --> 00:43:28,722
Thinking about on the specific platform that you're posting on

827
00:43:28,802 --> 00:43:31,503
or whatever place that your content is,

828
00:43:32,504 --> 00:43:35,065
how can they see it, or who can see it, how can they see it,

829
00:43:35,325 --> 00:43:40,067
and what kind of area, space, attention are you actually working with

830
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:44,509
to try to grab their attention and make them pay attention for more than a second.

831
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:48,376
And then converting attention into interest.

832
00:43:48,856 --> 00:43:51,276
Once you have at least grabbed some form of attention,

833
00:43:51,517 --> 00:43:53,357
how can you keep them watching for a bit longer?

834
00:43:53,997 --> 00:43:56,358
How can you then teach them something

835
00:43:56,398 --> 00:43:58,599
so that the touchpoint becomes more meaningful?

836
00:43:59,279 --> 00:44:01,059
And finally, if you really want to get

837
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,220
to a meaningful touchpoint,

838
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,041
then you can reward attention with an emotional response.

839
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:07,601
If someone feels something,

840
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:10,162
then that touchpoint is just so much more important to them.

841
00:44:11,509 --> 00:44:13,810
So, my name is Jared J Tan.

842
00:44:14,371 --> 00:44:17,493
My website, and you can find my writing at jaredtanj.com.

843
00:44:17,513 --> 00:44:19,094
That is not very good branding.

844
00:44:19,935 --> 00:44:22,977
And I'm on Twitter at @ehjaredj.

845
00:44:24,418 --> 00:44:26,499
This is one of the things I wrote about

846
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,461
for the social strategy of Cult of the Lamb.

847
00:44:29,221 --> 00:44:30,622
Just like a little diagram from it,

848
00:44:30,662 --> 00:44:32,083
and you can read that at my website,

849
00:44:32,424 --> 00:44:33,524
and you can follow me on Twitter.

850
00:44:33,585 --> 00:44:34,645
That would be very nice of you.

851
00:44:35,886 --> 00:44:38,648
But most importantly, the lamb stands out.

852
00:44:39,987 --> 00:44:42,528
Cult of the Lamb is a game that is truly outstanding.

853
00:44:42,928 --> 00:44:45,888
It's a game where you start your own cult of cute animals

854
00:44:46,008 --> 00:44:47,789
and mixes two genres in a new way

855
00:44:47,869 --> 00:44:49,629
that there wasn't really any big game

856
00:44:49,649 --> 00:44:50,549
who had done that before.

857
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,030
And it visually doesn't look like anything else

858
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,410
out there on the market.

859
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:56,471
And all of these things make it stand out.

860
00:44:56,491 --> 00:44:57,811
Does your game stand out?

861
00:44:58,111 --> 00:44:58,751
Hopefully it does.

862
00:44:59,111 --> 00:45:01,772
Otherwise, you might wanna go back

863
00:45:01,812 --> 00:45:02,892
to the drawing board a little bit.

864
00:45:03,272 --> 00:45:04,012
But Cult of the Lamb,

865
00:45:04,092 --> 00:45:06,293
I think the most important thing that let it do well

866
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:08,873
is that it had multiple ways for it to stand out.

867
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,322
And yes, sales numbers don't always correlate with social media.

868
00:45:14,802 --> 00:45:17,524
This is just a graph of our Twitter followers.

869
00:45:17,544 --> 00:45:22,727
I also graphed on some of the big posts that led us to gain traction.

870
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:27,010
So yeah, if you look carefully, you'll see that a number of the big bumps in interest

871
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,372
and followers were when we were doing a giveaway.

872
00:45:29,652 --> 00:45:31,763
So I will give away a free lamb merch

873
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:34,055
to someone who gives me a good rating for this talk.

874
00:45:34,355 --> 00:45:35,636
That's called a call to action.

875
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,338
Okay, but serious times now.

876
00:45:42,018 --> 00:45:44,699
Since I left my accounting career to work in games,

877
00:45:44,859 --> 00:45:47,620
what I enjoy the most is that I get to work with people

878
00:45:48,321 --> 00:45:50,221
like you, people who love games.

879
00:45:50,862 --> 00:45:53,102
I think we all know that games is definitely

880
00:45:53,142 --> 00:45:54,623
not the easiest place to work in,

881
00:45:54,723 --> 00:45:56,724
and you're probably sacrificing something in your life

882
00:45:56,884 --> 00:45:59,485
because you love and you want to work on games.

883
00:46:00,045 --> 00:46:03,006
But whatever specific job you do in the games industry,

884
00:46:03,506 --> 00:46:05,427
you are here because you want to be part

885
00:46:05,467 --> 00:46:06,488
of that creative process.

886
00:46:06,508 --> 00:46:08,328
You want to be part of making games.

887
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,322
to bring a little bit of joy to someone's life

888
00:46:11,822 --> 00:46:14,164
in this big medium that we love and care about.

889
00:46:15,585 --> 00:46:17,206
And because you're a creator,

890
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:18,928
you wanna make something original,

891
00:46:19,428 --> 00:46:22,290
something that's really your own.

892
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:23,931
And that is the core of it.

893
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:25,192
I think that's the encouraging thing,

894
00:46:25,493 --> 00:46:27,494
that of all the marketing things that I talked about,

895
00:46:28,135 --> 00:46:29,856
if you make something that is truly original,

896
00:46:29,876 --> 00:46:31,037
that's your own, that's new,

897
00:46:31,477 --> 00:46:33,579
then you're already on the right track.

898
00:46:34,544 --> 00:46:40,168
So make something new, make something your own, make something that stands out,

899
00:46:41,649 --> 00:46:44,671
and that game will have a fighting chance. Thank you.

900
00:46:59,921 --> 00:47:02,158
Thank you. Did you have fun?

901
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,551
Yeah, okay, great.

902
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:07,874
Yeah, do we have time for questions?

903
00:47:08,134 --> 00:47:09,595
Yeah, we can do a few questions.

904
00:47:09,715 --> 00:47:14,358
And after we're done, I think James will also be available for questions.

905
00:47:15,259 --> 00:47:19,261
So if you want to talk about the development stuff that I don't know, ask him.

906
00:47:20,102 --> 00:47:22,664
But yeah, oh, we got one here. Thank you.

907
00:47:22,684 --> 00:47:23,584
Hey there.

908
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:26,927
Dennis, marketing manager for Get to the Orange Door.

909
00:47:27,494 --> 00:47:28,720
We're a

910
00:47:29,733 --> 00:47:31,675
parkour roguelike FPS.

911
00:47:32,155 --> 00:47:34,877
And I was really fascinated about the animations

912
00:47:34,897 --> 00:47:37,760
because it allowed you to repurpose in-game assets

913
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,002
for really engaging content, essentially.

914
00:47:41,623 --> 00:47:43,364
So how would you prioritize,

915
00:47:43,545 --> 00:47:45,766
or maybe even what types of animations

916
00:47:46,047 --> 00:47:50,110
would you suggest to your dev team to focus on

917
00:47:50,551 --> 00:47:53,393
when you're nearing completion of the game, right?

918
00:47:53,473 --> 00:47:55,455
We could do finishers, we could do, you know,

919
00:47:55,975 --> 00:47:58,337
boss animations like you guys have as well.

920
00:47:59,349 --> 00:48:02,690
What would you say if we had maybe, you know, as an indie project,

921
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:03,876
limited resources

922
00:48:04,501 --> 00:48:10,197
where would you focus more of that budget in the animation aspect for content?

923
00:48:11,157 --> 00:48:17,222
I would think about, I guess, what kind of the player fantasy and then what the core

924
00:48:17,282 --> 00:48:20,384
pillars of your game that make your game unique compared to other games.

925
00:48:20,925 --> 00:48:21,965
So if you can...

926
00:48:23,064 --> 00:48:27,100
Think about those and which visual assets will support those fantasies,

927
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,688
will support those ideas.

928
00:48:30,188 --> 00:48:32,009
Then that's what I would want to focus on.

929
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:34,410
So, going back to the sacrifice ritual,

930
00:48:35,451 --> 00:48:37,732
sacrificing someone that's very connected to cults,

931
00:48:38,592 --> 00:48:41,794
and it goes in that way.

932
00:48:42,034 --> 00:48:44,237
Now, as soon as we see a sacrifice,

933
00:48:44,237 --> 00:48:46,457
we see something twisted, it's cult-related,

934
00:48:46,517 --> 00:48:51,019
so it all fits together within this general message that you are trying to portray.

935
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:53,827
Ok, this side?

936
00:48:54,272 --> 00:48:55,273
Amazing presentation.

937
00:48:55,713 --> 00:48:57,496
I actually have a question because

938
00:48:57,496 --> 00:49:00,876
it will mostly also maybe depend on like kind of like the style of the game.

939
00:49:00,956 --> 00:49:01,196
Yes.

940
00:49:01,216 --> 00:49:02,104
For example,

941
00:49:02,104 --> 00:49:04,408
this is a very like Cthulhu kind of game

942
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:08,601
and if you think of like that genre as on its own,

943
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:10,122
it's pretty hard to engage with people.

944
00:49:10,642 --> 00:49:14,124
But maybe because like of the style and everything, how would you actually,

945
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:18,547
if you have a more realistic game, how would you keep that constant engagement

946
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,369
if there's like not anything like sacrificing cute animals?

947
00:49:24,905 --> 00:49:27,608
There is a big market for realistic games.

948
00:49:27,668 --> 00:49:32,954
Like I think the vast majority of game sales are realistic games.

949
00:49:33,014 --> 00:49:35,397
So then you're looking at a different kind of market.

950
00:49:35,898 --> 00:49:37,059
Who are you appealing to?

951
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:38,801
And once again,

952
00:49:41,405 --> 00:49:45,830
thinking about what specific small things can you take from that that are appealing.

953
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:50,014
And, oh yeah, one thing I forgot to mention is that I always look for references.

954
00:49:50,474 --> 00:49:55,299
So if there's another game that did very well and has a similar style,

955
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:59,002
then go look at that and look at what kind of content they're making,

956
00:49:59,022 --> 00:50:00,323
what do they show in their trailers.

957
00:50:00,604 --> 00:50:03,306
And obviously don't do the exact same thing, but think about what...

958
00:50:04,707 --> 00:50:07,429
In that small shot, what is appealing?

959
00:50:07,989 --> 00:50:12,852
And figure out how you can find things in your game that are similar.

960
00:50:14,873 --> 00:50:17,895
Yeah, and then if it's realistic, there's all sorts of different things you could do.

961
00:50:17,975 --> 00:50:23,839
You could then maybe play with body humor or just ragdoll physics and stuff,

962
00:50:23,859 --> 00:50:24,799
which people do enjoy.

963
00:50:24,819 --> 00:50:27,481
And those are things that we can't do, but you can do.

964
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:30,463
So that's something that sets you apart from someone like us.

965
00:50:30,963 --> 00:50:31,923
All right, awesome. Thank you.

966
00:50:31,943 --> 00:50:33,725
Okay, I'll go on this side.

967
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,009
Hi, I'm Justine, I work on Skullgirls.

968
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:39,211
Oh, hello.

969
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,932
Hi from Twitter.

970
00:50:39,952 --> 00:50:41,394
Oh, hi from Twitter.

971
00:50:41,434 --> 00:50:43,517
Yeah, it's weird seeing you in Flash space.

972
00:50:44,278 --> 00:50:44,738
Really weird.

973
00:50:44,919 --> 00:50:50,666
Anyways, I helped grow our TikTok to 180K followers in four months.

974
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:53,552
But like, I'm not a marketer, I'm a product manager.

975
00:50:53,732 --> 00:50:57,175
I just did it in my like side time and I've been trying to convince leadership

976
00:50:57,195 --> 00:50:58,556
to like invest more time into it.

977
00:50:59,197 --> 00:51:03,020
And I noticed I love the data in your slides and you know how revenue

978
00:51:03,241 --> 00:51:06,624
doesn't always like correlate with virality,

979
00:51:07,204 --> 00:51:08,886
but sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.

980
00:51:08,926 --> 00:51:11,388
I guess, do you have any advice for someone who's like trying to make

981
00:51:11,428 --> 00:51:12,649
a business case to leadership?

982
00:51:12,709 --> 00:51:14,791
Like, hey, we should invest more in our TikTok

983
00:51:15,852 --> 00:51:17,173
and someone else should do it, not just me.

984
00:51:18,334 --> 00:51:19,795
Well, firstly, congratulations.

985
00:51:20,394 --> 00:51:22,377
That's a huge achievement.

986
00:51:22,397 --> 00:51:25,339
That's bigger than the vast majority of games.

987
00:51:28,941 --> 00:51:35,525
So the way that I think of it is, let's say you pay one person to do a TikTok for a year,

988
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:36,225
for example.

989
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:43,150
Let's say somewhere between 50 and 75 or 80, depending on where they're from or whatever.

990
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,932
But how many sales does that actually need?

991
00:51:47,825 --> 00:51:55,330
If the game is like $10 or $20, if it's $20 like most indie games, then that is like a

992
00:51:55,390 --> 00:52:00,532
few thousand sales, which really isn't that many to reach.

993
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:03,254
So that is kind of the numbers that I think about.

994
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:06,116
If you can say that, yeah, we've got like...

995
00:52:06,856 --> 00:52:08,397
Millions of views over these months.

996
00:52:08,737 --> 00:52:14,160
And you can't confirm that it will translate to a few thousand sales to make that justified,

997
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,801
but I think it's pretty likely that it would.

998
00:52:17,021 --> 00:52:19,943
It's only a few thousand out of the millions of people who have seen the thing.

999
00:52:21,003 --> 00:52:23,605
If you want to use numbers, that's what I would go with.

1000
00:52:23,785 --> 00:52:24,505
Okay. Thank you.

1001
00:52:25,005 --> 00:52:26,926
We can talk about that more after. That's a tough question.

1002
00:52:27,006 --> 00:52:29,227
I know that's a tough thing that people go through.

1003
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:29,968
Great talk. Thank you.

1004
00:52:32,693 --> 00:52:32,973
Sorry.

1005
00:52:32,993 --> 00:52:33,694
That's quite tall.

1006
00:52:33,834 --> 00:52:34,574
I'm very small.

1007
00:52:35,475 --> 00:52:36,836
That's OK.

1008
00:52:36,856 --> 00:52:37,656
Hi, I'm Samantha.

1009
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:39,638
I am also a social media marketing manager.

1010
00:52:40,098 --> 00:52:42,760
And I'd love to hear how your team navigated

1011
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,303
through internal stakeholders and assessing risk when

1012
00:52:48,124 --> 00:52:49,905
featuring things like Scientology

1013
00:52:50,106 --> 00:52:52,667
or using the parody IP from Rovio.

1014
00:52:52,687 --> 00:52:55,750
I'd love to know what that process looked like for you

1015
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:56,650
personally.

1016
00:52:57,393 --> 00:53:03,315
Well, if you're familiar with the Devolver brand, that's kind of what we do.

1017
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:07,899
So when an idea comes up,

1018
00:53:07,899 --> 00:53:12,997
I'll ask the Chief Marketing Officer Nigel Lowrie at Devolver

1019
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:15,758
if it's something kind of risky, like the Scientology one.

1020
00:53:16,038 --> 00:53:20,579
But even from the Devolver channel, he's posted things that are worse than that.

1021
00:53:22,747 --> 00:53:27,913
Yeah, like there was one where we got an email to the Devolver customer service

1022
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:30,294
that was someone saying that,

1023
00:53:30,714 --> 00:53:34,998
like, you know, you're promoting Satanism or like paganism, stuff like that.

1024
00:53:35,058 --> 00:53:37,300
And then he, like, screenshotted the email.

1025
00:53:37,481 --> 00:53:41,644
But my favorite part was like, you are a company based in Austin, Texas.

1026
00:53:41,704 --> 00:53:42,545
How could you do this?

1027
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:45,540
That was my favorite part.

1028
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:50,072
So yeah, we, and also even the, the Angry Birds, like the kissing one, um,

1029
00:53:50,072 --> 00:53:53,502
we have a new social media manager who's doing a fantastic job

1030
00:53:53,502 --> 00:53:57,598
if you've seen Cults of the Lamb on Twitter, uh, this like in 2023,

1031
00:53:57,598 --> 00:53:59,038
that is pretty much all her.

1032
00:53:59,038 --> 00:54:01,133
Um, she was the one who suggested to do it.

1033
00:54:01,553 --> 00:54:03,655
And I was like, I'm not sure.

1034
00:54:03,675 --> 00:54:06,857
And then I asked the guys, I say, are you okay with this?

1035
00:54:07,157 --> 00:54:08,558
And they're like, yeah, do whatever.

1036
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,499
Uh, so.

1037
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:14,640
Yeah, we don't have that problem, really.

1038
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,272
Sorry, I don't know how to help.

1039
00:54:17,013 --> 00:54:18,674
I'm lucky to not have that problem.

1040
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:21,295
Hey, Jared.

1041
00:54:21,855 --> 00:54:22,676
I'm Jordan Peloquin.

1042
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,397
I'm a designer for 1st Playable Productions.

1043
00:54:24,457 --> 00:54:26,258
In my free time, I work on indie games,

1044
00:54:26,578 --> 00:54:28,559
and there's this turn-based RPG about mental health

1045
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,120
that I've been working on for the past three years

1046
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,761
that I would really like to get off the ground,

1047
00:54:31,841 --> 00:54:33,802
get like bigger social media following,

1048
00:54:33,822 --> 00:54:34,462
maybe a publisher.

1049
00:54:34,502 --> 00:54:35,763
I've been pitching to some people lately.

1050
00:54:35,803 --> 00:54:37,184
I might be pitching to Devolver soon,

1051
00:54:37,264 --> 00:54:38,305
so, you know, look out for it.

1052
00:54:39,626 --> 00:54:42,545
But something that's really, I feel is kind of awkward about my game

1053
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:46,751
is that it's very obviously inspired by a lot of other like surreal indie RPGs.

1054
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:48,316
Like people compare it to Undertale a lot

1055
00:54:48,316 --> 00:54:50,292
and it's very obvious that I really like Undertale

1056
00:54:50,292 --> 00:54:53,277
and that I got a lot of inspiration from that game when I made mine.

1057
00:54:54,131 --> 00:54:57,332
And I always struggle with marketing it to either publishers or to social media

1058
00:54:57,332 --> 00:55:02,056
because I feel awkward about relating it back to the games that people are familiar with.

1059
00:55:02,196 --> 00:55:04,564
I want to do that because I want to grab people's attention with things

1060
00:55:04,564 --> 00:55:06,038
that they already like and that they know,

1061
00:55:06,378 --> 00:55:09,300
but at the same time, I don't want people to predicate their expectations for my game

1062
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,672
off of something that it isn't,

1063
00:55:10,672 --> 00:55:12,481
and I do want it to stand on its own two legs.

1064
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:14,960
And particularly with publishers,

1065
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,904
I want to be careful about that because I want them to be invested in my game,

1066
00:55:18,204 --> 00:55:22,006
and I don't want it to seem like I'm peddling a copy of another game that already exists.

1067
00:55:22,306 --> 00:55:22,686
Yeah.

1068
00:55:22,706 --> 00:55:25,627
Just as a general thing. I don't know, maybe you have some advice or perspective on that.

1069
00:55:26,276 --> 00:55:31,678
So we don't, like, obviously Cult of the Lamb, with the art style being in 2D and a 3D space,

1070
00:55:32,198 --> 00:55:37,640
we get a lot of comparisons to stuff like Don't Starve, or with the theming of the game,

1071
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,501
it connects to The Binding of Isaac, as well as it's a roguelike,

1072
00:55:40,901 --> 00:55:44,311
and we don't directly really reference,

1073
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:47,843
except for that very silly thing will be referenced very quickly

1074
00:55:47,863 --> 00:55:49,664
for Don't Starve or Binding of Isaac.

1075
00:55:52,345 --> 00:55:53,545
Yeah, I'd say that...

1076
00:55:54,743 --> 00:55:57,564
Other people will make that connection for you and you don't need to.

1077
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:02,026
So another thing you can do on TikTok in particular is don't give them all the answers.

1078
00:56:02,046 --> 00:56:03,907
You don't have to say everything about your game at once.

1079
00:56:04,007 --> 00:56:07,968
Sometimes, oftentimes I don't even say the name of the game or like where you can buy it.

1080
00:56:07,988 --> 00:56:11,029
Because then people will just leave a bunch of comments asking,

1081
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:17,151
even if the name of your account is whatever your game is, they'll still ask.

1082
00:56:18,191 --> 00:56:21,232
And then that's, yeah, so people will make that connection without you.

1083
00:56:21,572 --> 00:56:22,933
So you don't need to make it.

1084
00:56:24,734 --> 00:56:27,831
If it's more like a personal story, like, I was very inspired by Undertale,

1085
00:56:27,831 --> 00:56:29,058
like, that's another way you could do it.

1086
00:56:29,479 --> 00:56:35,225
And in general, just like all of these possible ways of linking things together,

1087
00:56:35,265 --> 00:56:37,947
or even just sharing things about your game and what makes it stand out,

1088
00:56:38,868 --> 00:56:41,791
it's all different framing to use the similar kind of content.

1089
00:56:42,953 --> 00:56:46,516
Yeah, so try different things and see what happens.

1090
00:56:46,877 --> 00:56:47,638
All right. Thank you.

1091
00:56:50,678 --> 00:56:52,237
Hi, I'm Julian.

1092
00:56:52,237 --> 00:56:55,340
That was pretty much my question exactly, so praise the lamb. Thank you.

1093
00:56:59,093 --> 00:57:00,838
All right. Hi, my name is Louie.

1094
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:06,425
My question is, to what extent do you use SEO tools and

1095
00:57:06,425 --> 00:57:09,966
focus groups to determine the content of your messaging?

1096
00:57:10,859 --> 00:57:11,447
We don't.

1097
00:57:13,065 --> 00:57:13,946
I actually would like to.

1098
00:57:14,046 --> 00:57:16,326
I do know the power of data,

1099
00:57:16,326 --> 00:57:21,476
but I guess we don't have a big enough team to do that very much.

1100
00:57:22,254 --> 00:57:29,226
I think the best social media managers kind of don't need it,

1101
00:57:29,226 --> 00:57:31,443
that they can figure out

1102
00:57:31,983 --> 00:57:34,166
what works without using the tools.

1103
00:57:37,641 --> 00:57:41,053
To me, the most powerful thing is being able to get into the new mindset,

1104
00:57:41,053 --> 00:57:46,749
to really understand what a casual observer is seeing

1105
00:57:46,749 --> 00:57:50,281
and what they could feel and how they would react to whatever they're seeing.

1106
00:57:51,949 --> 00:57:52,209
Yeah.

1107
00:57:52,789 --> 00:57:54,830
Sorry, we do not do that.

1108
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:55,891
Fantastic.

1109
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:56,231
Thank you.

1110
00:57:58,526 --> 00:57:58,786
Hello.

1111
00:57:59,227 --> 00:57:59,367
Hey.

1112
00:58:00,248 --> 00:58:01,989
You mentioned the unique visual art of the game,

1113
00:58:02,069 --> 00:58:04,131
but I also thought the soundtrack was really unique.

1114
00:58:04,171 --> 00:58:05,332
I still listen to it on Spotify.

1115
00:58:05,512 --> 00:58:05,752
Yes.

1116
00:58:05,913 --> 00:58:08,455
I was curious, did any of your marketing involve the music?

1117
00:58:08,515 --> 00:58:10,497
Did you collaborate with River Boy to advertise?

1118
00:58:10,757 --> 00:58:14,140
And going further, does music have the same impact as visuals

1119
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,222
within like TikTok videos and that sort of thing?

1120
00:58:16,782 --> 00:58:21,106
So, yeah, music is tough because one of the things you do on TikTok

1121
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:24,389
is you use music from trending sounds on TikTok.

1122
00:58:24,429 --> 00:58:25,270
So, like, almost...

1123
00:58:26,473 --> 00:58:29,394
Most of the things we post don't have music from the game.

1124
00:58:31,996 --> 00:58:32,796
On Twitter, yes.

1125
00:58:33,397 --> 00:58:37,379
But even then, when I browse Twitter, I don't have my sound on.

1126
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:40,460
And I'm usually in a public space when I'm doing it,

1127
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,761
because it's something I'm doing to kill time.

1128
00:58:43,242 --> 00:58:44,682
And I don't want sound to be on.

1129
00:58:45,803 --> 00:58:48,204
Yeah, so as much as music is really good,

1130
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:50,085
it definitely doesn't convert...

1131
00:58:50,706 --> 00:58:52,306
It doesn't work so well on social media.

1132
00:58:54,149 --> 00:58:57,454
But there are ways, like I know people who, like they're composers

1133
00:58:57,454 --> 00:58:59,231
and they have put their, like,

1134
00:58:59,471 --> 00:59:04,878
their music, their sounds have become like viral sounds on TikTok for example.

1135
00:59:06,231 --> 00:59:09,565
Whether that actually will end up people, to people connecting back to your game,

1136
00:59:09,565 --> 00:59:11,715
I think that's even like another step farther,

1137
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:12,675
so it's even harder.

1138
00:59:13,528 --> 00:59:17,394
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that you can't not talk about the music,

1139
00:59:17,394 --> 00:59:21,238
but it's just like not very conducive to this platform. Yeah.

1140
00:59:23,878 --> 00:59:27,600
OK, we'll go here first, and then, oh, oh, sorry.

1141
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,500
One more?

1142
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:28,860
One more.

1143
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,261
OK.

1144
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:31,601
Sorry.

1145
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:33,682
My name is Reshma.

1146
00:59:33,942 --> 00:59:37,884
I work for YouTube Gaming, like on their Twitter specifically.

1147
00:59:38,464 --> 00:59:41,925
So I was wondering if you guys utilize content creators

1148
00:59:42,285 --> 00:59:44,786
to promote your game at all, or if that was useful.

1149
00:59:45,002 --> 00:59:45,763
Yes.

1150
00:59:45,887 --> 00:59:48,488
Also including VTubers as content creators.

1151
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:51,618
Okay, 100%.

1152
00:59:52,437 --> 00:59:58,421
The push from content creators and Twitch streamers in particular was very, very big

1153
00:59:58,481 --> 01:00:02,163
for Cult of the Lamb's success, both for sales and for social media.

1154
01:00:02,524 --> 01:00:07,827
So content creators are a big portion of the people on Twitter.

1155
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:09,108
They have followings.

1156
01:00:09,368 --> 01:00:10,689
They're trying to build their followings.

1157
01:00:10,709 --> 01:00:11,870
Um, so.

1158
01:00:13,049 --> 01:00:15,485
Oftentimes you'll see a game,

1159
01:00:15,485 --> 01:00:18,156
even if it's a game that not many people know about, one

1160
01:00:18,196 --> 01:00:20,395
of their big tweets that they've ever had is one saying like,

1161
01:00:20,395 --> 01:00:22,124
hey, we're looking for content curators

1162
01:00:22,124 --> 01:00:25,665
because they just want to join in and get things for free.

1163
01:00:27,944 --> 01:00:29,868
Yeah, so yes, it definitely helps.

1164
01:00:29,868 --> 01:00:33,369
It's a good way to boost engagement, especially on a place like Twitter.

1165
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:39,075
And then for Call to the Lamb in particular, with this really good Twitch integration,

1166
01:00:39,616 --> 01:00:44,420
the stats showed that at launch time, and I'm pretty sure for a good time after,

1167
01:00:46,222 --> 01:00:48,812
People who streamed Cult of the Lamb,

1168
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:52,376
their average viewership was higher when streaming Cult of the Lamb

1169
01:00:52,376 --> 01:00:54,324
than their normal average viewership,

1170
01:00:54,324 --> 01:00:59,091
which is ridiculous for a new IP for a game made by a small company.

1171
01:00:59,111 --> 01:01:00,732
That's basically completely unheard of.

1172
01:01:02,293 --> 01:01:07,515
Yeah, so like the investment to build the Twitch integration to like really push and create.

1173
01:01:07,635 --> 01:01:13,397
We also had a influencer embargo so influencers could play the game like a week and a half,

1174
01:01:13,457 --> 01:01:15,039
two weeks before the game launched.

1175
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:19,039
And then we had influencers coming to us saying like,

1176
01:01:19,059 --> 01:01:20,427
hey, I want to participate in this.

1177
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:22,720
Like I want to be one of these exclusive people to

1178
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:23,819
get the game first.

1179
01:01:23,819 --> 01:01:27,722
And they were like tweeting about it as well. So yes, big, big impacts.
