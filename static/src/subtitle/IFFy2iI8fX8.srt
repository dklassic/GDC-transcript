1
00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:08,523
All right, hello, everybody.

2
00:00:08,543 --> 00:00:12,105
I guess we're live now.

3
00:00:12,385 --> 00:00:12,685
Cool.

4
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:17,208
For those of you who don't know me, my name is Peter McConnell.

5
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:22,792
I'd like to thank Damien and Scott for inviting me to speak.

6
00:00:23,913 --> 00:00:27,815
I've been writing music for games now for about 25 years.

7
00:00:30,457 --> 00:00:32,198
So I guess that's why I was invited

8
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,880
to speak about this subject, which

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,361
is, what can we learn from?

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,064
the classic era of game music

11
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:44,169
and uh...

12
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:48,215
the classics we hear a lot about on these days

13
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:50,538
and uh...

14
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,623
we remember some of these titles fondly

15
00:00:55,101 --> 00:00:57,742
Oh, by the way, I didn't talk about what I've actually done, I guess.

16
00:00:57,802 --> 00:00:59,663
Well, I worked for LucasArts for a bunch of years.

17
00:01:00,623 --> 00:01:07,366
And after that, I scored, in LucasArts, I scored games like, or helped to score games

18
00:01:07,386 --> 00:01:13,468
like Monkey Island 2, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Grim Fandango, Full Throttle.

19
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:24,313
After that, Psychonauts, Sly Cooper series, Broken Age, another, the Kickstarter from

20
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:24,853
Double Fine.

21
00:01:25,562 --> 00:01:27,483
and a hearthstone for Blizzard Entertainment.

22
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:31,583
So I've, you know, been lucky to be doing this for a while.

23
00:01:32,244 --> 00:01:34,484
And I do have, I guess you might say,

24
00:01:35,824 --> 00:01:37,505
some kind of a perspective on all this

25
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:43,526
that extends for more time than I'd care to admit.

26
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:48,847
So, King's Quest, Wing Commander,

27
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:51,187
Seventh Guest, Myst.

28
00:01:51,627 --> 00:01:52,928
Does anybody remember these games?

29
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:04,664
They were pretty cool and it was an exciting time because it was a really new industry.

30
00:02:04,764 --> 00:02:07,365
And by the way, does anybody know who this guy is over here?

31
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:11,027
Oh, come on.

32
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:21,652
Okay, he announced the longest running TV commercial in the history of television for

33
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,993
the Columbia Collection of Classics.

34
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:26,474
Classical music.

35
00:02:26,734 --> 00:02:27,595
Remember, even you!

36
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:33,014
Even you can own the Paul Vetsian dances by Baradine.

37
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,596
And his name, for extra credit, anybody know his name?

38
00:02:38,797 --> 00:02:41,379
He was Mr. French in Family Affair for one time.

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
John Williams.

40
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:46,722
And speaking of John Williams.

41
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:56,382
My experience in this business started working for a company owned by George Lucas.

42
00:02:56,622 --> 00:02:59,644
Not really this George Lucas, I think, but more like this George Lucas.

43
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:10,032
And as I said, we did some titles that I'm still very fond of and proud of in those days.

44
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:17,906
you know, it was a really, it was a really interesting time

45
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:20,608
to, to be in the business, and I think

46
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:24,453
it's worth, if you want to think about now, because I do hear a lot of people

47
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:24,913
talk about,

48
00:03:25,494 --> 00:03:27,296
oh, the golden age of games, you know,

49
00:03:27,656 --> 00:03:31,260
they just don't make them like they used to, you know, you know, when you had to

50
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,461
only work with eight bits,

51
00:03:33,002 --> 00:03:36,305
my goodness, you had to write a good tune, and now it's all about the production,

52
00:03:36,345 --> 00:03:37,867
right? I'm sure you've heard stuff like this before.

53
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:48,342
And, you know, there's a grain of truth to some of that, but I think there's also a healthy amount of salt to throw over your shoulder when you hear that kind of stuff.

54
00:03:50,603 --> 00:03:57,265
But it is worth remembering what it was like, because some of it is amazingly like now.

55
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:07,087
So, in those days, games and virtual reality, I don't know if you remember virtual reality, but it was sort of like games, only more exciting sounding.

56
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:10,995
They were a niche software market, right?

57
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:12,136
It was nerd culture.

58
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:18,201
It was a very, very, very few, you know, kind of, in a way,

59
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,842
elite group of people who were into it.

60
00:04:20,963 --> 00:04:26,008
And, you know, I did not go to the first GDC,

61
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:27,629
but I did go to the second one.

62
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:32,774
And the second GDC had about 250 people at it,

63
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,116
and it was at some hotel in San Jose.

64
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:41,664
And 50 of them were us folks from LucasArts, which, that was about the size of the company then.

65
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:48,170
And we all wore these little red fezzes, like Morocco Mole.

66
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,752
Guys, anybody know Secret Squirrel?

67
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,554
All right! Geez.

68
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,257
There's at least one other baby boomer in here.

69
00:04:58,461 --> 00:05:02,764
So we all wore these fezes that had the LucasArts logo on them.

70
00:05:02,924 --> 00:05:05,505
And it was just kind of a way of saying, you know, we're pretty wacky,

71
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:08,987
and we're all kind of in this cool little team, and we all work together.

72
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:12,628
And we'd actually go to company meetings, and George Lucas would be on stage,

73
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:17,571
and there would be ILM over here, and there would be Skywalker Sound,

74
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:20,852
and over here would be LucasArts with their red fezes on,

75
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:22,493
and no one really knew what to make of us.

76
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:32,156
But it was all kind of a reflection of where games were in the big picture at the time.

77
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:34,357
They were something that was about to happen.

78
00:05:34,497 --> 00:05:36,358
They were not something that had really happened yet.

79
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:45,083
And space in those daysâ€”I'm supposed to have a big picture of a floppy disk here,

80
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:47,504
but you can't find floppy disks anymore.

81
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:55,936
And we shipped all, you know, we shipped the Monkey Games and Indie and so forth on floppies.

82
00:05:56,497 --> 00:06:01,382
And if you can imagine that, and you know, when we worked on our new sound system, the

83
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:04,866
fact that it took an entire floppy disk was this horrible, horrible thing.

84
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:06,868
We had to really, you know, just...

85
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,002
advocate for a new sound system intensely because of the

86
00:06:11,763 --> 00:06:15,624
uh... what was at the time a huge space uh... hog right

87
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:16,305
but anyway

88
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:19,807
cd-roms came along and changed everything they promised

89
00:06:20,327 --> 00:06:21,707
vast amounts of storage

90
00:06:22,188 --> 00:06:22,968
there were lots of

91
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:27,050
claims about how much data you're gonna be able to get on one which sort of

92
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,471
turned out to be overblown

93
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:29,912
but they still changed

94
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:31,472
the industry tremendously

95
00:06:32,273 --> 00:06:34,214
and uh... audio hardware

96
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:39,335
The Sound Blaster just being invented, right?

97
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:42,736
High, basically the state of the art was 2D, 2.5D,

98
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:46,997
kind of like that picture you first saw from Monkey Island 2.

99
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:49,858
And 3D was the future.

100
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:56,199
Wolfenstein came out and it was a, you know,

101
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:58,160
it was a game changer, as it were.

102
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,060
Takis, we actually called them Takis.

103
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:10,158
were a novelty, right? And, you know, we were doing the voices ourselves, you know.

104
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:12,580
Mmm, Yoda I was, mmm, right?

105
00:07:14,793 --> 00:07:18,114
And so it was very in how it was.

106
00:07:18,494 --> 00:07:20,795
We tended to be small as a whole.

107
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:24,755
And Lucas is not exactly maybe reflective of the entire

108
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:25,996
industry in some ways.

109
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:28,056
But in others, it very much was.

110
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:32,677
Small group of very young people sort of getting

111
00:07:32,697 --> 00:07:35,477
together and inventing things from their bootstraps.

112
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:41,918
And what this meant was, first of all, budgets were tiny.

113
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:47,005
We went lo-fi because we had to.

114
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:54,390
I mean, if we'd have had surround sound to work with,

115
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,751
we would have worked with surround sound,

116
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,713
but what we had was 8-bit audio cards,

117
00:07:58,873 --> 00:08:01,055
and even worse, the PC speaker.

118
00:08:04,157 --> 00:08:08,320
Necessity, therefore, was the mother of invention, right?

119
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:11,782
And we wore...

120
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:21,230
many hats, right? I was hired to program, to help design and program the interactive

121
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:26,833
music system at LucasArts, as well as to write music for it. And that was, you know, it was

122
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:33,177
very common in those days, unfortunately in some cases, but for people to wear, you know,

123
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:41,141
many hats from being, you know, programmer to tester to voice actor. And we were in-house.

124
00:08:42,885 --> 00:08:48,930
And this is one of those things where it's not so true now for some of us, but it's very true for others of us.

125
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,992
We were in-house, so we had time.

126
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,355
We had time to come up with stuff.

127
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:01,663
And George Lucas actually sort of explicitly

128
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:05,565
Went to the board and said of Lucas art said, you know

129
00:09:05,585 --> 00:09:08,607
I don't care what you do for this amount of time just do cool stuff

130
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:14,791
And that was kind of an ideal job to have where someone was telling you hey, I don't care what you do

131
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:15,752
Just do cool stuff

132
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:18,634
By the way that changed

133
00:09:22,582 --> 00:09:26,905
So one of the things that we did with all this time was,

134
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:30,147
hey, let's make an interactive music system.

135
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:31,748
Let's do cool stuff, right?

136
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:37,672
So the challenge in those days was to basically leap out

137
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:39,573
of a really crappy little speaker

138
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:42,696
and get people's attention and satisfy

139
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:45,678
a really picky cadre of nerds.

140
00:09:47,844 --> 00:09:52,167
I myself, I got into games because I loved Zork.

141
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:53,448
Does anybody remember Zork?

142
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:54,529
Okay.

143
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:57,832
Those MIT geeks who then became Infocom.

144
00:09:58,672 --> 00:10:02,215
And anyway, a whole different deal now.

145
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,918
Now, we've grown up as an industry.

146
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:12,641
We're now officially entertainment.

147
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:17,025
We used to be kind of like software, entertainment, not really sure which.

148
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:21,169
It's entertainment, I would say now, with a heavy software component.

149
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:24,893
It's a huge mass market phenomenon.

150
00:10:25,414 --> 00:10:28,176
It's stuff you see every day on the news.

151
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,659
There's a game section in Rolling Stone.

152
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,163
We affect major companies' bottom lines.

153
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:37,946
I mean, the idea that Halo or Kinect affect Microsoft's

154
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:40,569
bottom line, to me, boggles my mind.

155
00:10:41,536 --> 00:10:46,860
If you compare that to, you know, I mean, admittedly, George Lucas is a big famous guy,

156
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,124
and he's got a big famous company, but there's 50 of us, you know, and we're tinkering on

157
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:51,824
these little things.

158
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:56,128
The idea that that would come to where we are now today is just amazing to me.

159
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,953
The cloud now offers direct access to just about everything in the whole universe.

160
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:05,416
You know, quite a contrast to the old CD-ROM.

161
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:10,319
Audio hardware is now a tiny version of home theater.

162
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:14,483
What you can do on an iPhone with audio blows away anything.

163
00:11:14,563 --> 00:11:18,687
The most hi-fi game stuff could do in 1991 or so.

164
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:22,691
And wait a minute, space is an issue?

165
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:25,754
Yeah, well, if you're in mobile games, it is.

166
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:28,117
And one thing I will say is.

167
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:36,137
Space is always going to be an issue from the floppy disk to wherever there's always going to be some little thing in our business

168
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:43,741
That is cutting-edge and new and is all about getting it on to some even tinier little space than it's been before

169
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:48,844
Low res looks like a skipped a little bullet point there, but low res 2.5. D are now

170
00:11:48,864 --> 00:11:50,285
2d and 2.5. D are now hip

171
00:11:54,608 --> 00:11:56,951
and retro and cool and

172
00:11:57,672 --> 00:11:59,014
But so is 3d of course

173
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,096
So what this means is?

174
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:02,498
budgets

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,928
They might be small and this did anybody see Brian's do you guys were here for Brian Schmitz talk or it the

176
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:12,030
the

177
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:20,405
broad span of projects in this industry is just amazing now.

178
00:12:20,546 --> 00:12:24,849
And so you may have these little tiny projects, little mobile projects,

179
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:31,735
or you may have these ridiculously big budget projects.

180
00:12:34,217 --> 00:12:36,819
We wear slightly fewer hats than we did.

181
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:41,603
Again, this applies more to some of us than to others.

182
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:50,302
Invention means creating your own necessity, because we have access to a lot of cool stuff now.

183
00:12:51,663 --> 00:12:54,265
I have a studio that I would have killed for back in those days.

184
00:12:57,788 --> 00:13:01,431
And we go lo-fi not because we have to, but because we can.

185
00:13:02,152 --> 00:13:04,914
Because it works for the project, because it's cool.

186
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,533
And we're often out of house, and that was an interesting thing in Brian's talk as well.

187
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:13,996
We're often out of house now as opposed to in-house.

188
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:18,701
We get brought in very quickly sometimes on a project, and schedules can be insane.

189
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:20,582
And yes, they were always insane.

190
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:23,265
Not sure they were quite this insane.

191
00:13:26,828 --> 00:13:28,409
But we still like to innovate.

192
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,771
We still want to make the music cool.

193
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,833
We still want to do new stuff.

194
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:40,796
So the challenge now is to rise from a sea of content, vast, huge sea of content, to

195
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:48,020
grab people's attention in the mass market and still satisfy a really picky cadre of

196
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,142
true believers.

197
00:13:53,703 --> 00:13:55,964
So what was it like?

198
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:57,545
I think it's worth, when we go back...

199
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:04,106
and look and see if we can learn anything from the beginning, the beginnings of time, as it were.

200
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:11,871
What was it like culturally? Well, it was a lot like college, only more so.

201
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:21,657
When we, when I was hired at Lucas, we used to have parties, basically, where you would try out new, someone would,

202
00:14:22,338 --> 00:14:26,941
people would have ideas for games and they would code them up, and then we'd have this thing called a pizza orgy.

203
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,702
where, and this is a real picture of a real pizza orgy.

204
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:41,965
And, you know, the idea being that if it's not fun at a party, maybe it's not that fun.

205
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:49,207
And so everybody would play the game at these things, at these, and, and give their feedback.

206
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:51,268
And that was sort of part of the culture there.

207
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,348
Fun was a big, huge part of the culture.

208
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,709
The tools we had to work with were.

209
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,792
really rudimentary, okay? They were consumer and hobbyist level tools.

210
00:15:03,232 --> 00:15:05,653
Pro Tools 1.0 came out in 1991.

211
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:08,675
It cost six grand,

212
00:15:09,595 --> 00:15:10,375
and guess what?

213
00:15:11,336 --> 00:15:12,276
We didn't have it.

214
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:16,678
It was deemed too expensive

215
00:15:17,338 --> 00:15:18,659
for the kind of work we were doing.

216
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,160
Most of the tools we used were in-house.

217
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:26,861
NIH, everybody knows what that means, right?

218
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:28,642
Not invented here.

219
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:37,309
If you get something from off the shelf, you're not a sufficiently cool cowboy programmer.

220
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:38,691
You need to make it yourself.

221
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:43,955
And part of that was a necessity, because we didn't have tools to do the kinds of things

222
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:44,876
we really wanted to do.

223
00:15:46,305 --> 00:15:50,409
So, uh, the good point about that is you got an intimate connection

224
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:52,991
with the results of what you were doing.

225
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:56,653
You didn't, it was a very sort of integrated process in terms of

226
00:15:57,614 --> 00:16:01,117
creating audio and implementing it and then experiencing it.

227
00:16:01,277 --> 00:16:04,980
And I will get to that in a little more detail in a bit.

228
00:16:06,401 --> 00:16:11,525
And one of the hats that, um, we wore as composers was the mechanics hat.

229
00:16:11,565 --> 00:16:14,827
We would actually, you know, to use the sports car, um...

230
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:21,945
analogy, we would work on the car, get out and drive it for a while, get out and work

231
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:28,288
on the car, drive it for a while, and that allowed us to create tools that really worked

232
00:16:28,348 --> 00:16:28,869
well for us.

233
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:34,932
It also did mean we spent a lot of time creating tools and maybe not quite as much time as

234
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:37,193
we would like to have been writing music.

235
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:42,506
And we do all that, as I said, because it's cool.

236
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:45,268
We're interested in doing something really creative.

237
00:16:45,288 --> 00:16:47,190
But also because we have to, because there's no choice.

238
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:49,291
OK.

239
00:16:49,472 --> 00:16:56,177
Now I'm going to actually get into an example here of a tool.

240
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,319
Our interactive music system was called IMUSE.

241
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,881
It stands for Interactive Music and Sound Effects.

242
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,442
The term now is adaptive.

243
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,884
So sometimes I'm going to say adaptive music, and sometimes

244
00:17:05,904 --> 00:17:07,065
I'm going to say interactive music.

245
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:07,886
I mean the same thing.

246
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:15,101
And we had a tool that we used for composers called iMac.

247
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,823
And sorry about the confusion.

248
00:17:17,863 --> 00:17:19,924
This was invented before the iMac was invented.

249
00:17:19,944 --> 00:17:24,988
And it was just our tool that we ran on the Macintosh to

250
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:30,772
help us create our music and then actually hear it in a

251
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:33,654
context very much like the game without having to bother

252
00:17:33,674 --> 00:17:34,355
the programmers.

253
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:37,838
So what it let you do is create buttons

254
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:39,699
and associate game states

255
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,063
with those buttons and then place those buttons on a map so you could see how

256
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:44,703
all the

257
00:17:45,144 --> 00:17:48,246
pieces of music and the states in the game relate to each other.

258
00:17:49,107 --> 00:17:49,688
And, um...

259
00:17:51,094 --> 00:17:59,037
That was very useful because it was, you know, it was very visual and it was very immediate.

260
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:06,079
You could trigger, you would press a button, trigger audio files with behaviors, which were then entered into an H file.

261
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:08,020
Anybody code C in this room?

262
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:09,680
Wow.

263
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,663
See, in, in, in, in whatever, 1992, I think probably most of the hands would have gone up.

264
00:18:18,591 --> 00:18:21,995
So an H file is just something in the C language.

265
00:18:22,897 --> 00:18:27,462
And what that did is it provided a customizable layer of logic

266
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:29,464
between game states and music states.

267
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,954
The programmers would be programming the game. They would simply be setting

268
00:18:34,575 --> 00:18:35,275
state codes.

269
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,136
We'd be here writing our music

270
00:18:37,696 --> 00:18:38,096
and then

271
00:18:38,757 --> 00:18:40,198
also implementing

272
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:43,919
this layer which is essentially equivalent to Y's or Fmod now

273
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:44,780
of

274
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,801
something that would interpret those game states.

275
00:18:48,402 --> 00:18:51,903
And then we'd also be using this tool to visualize what we were doing.

276
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,775
We could test the interactivity without doing a build of the game.

277
00:18:57,456 --> 00:18:59,237
I would write stuff for Grim Fandango

278
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:00,177
and then

279
00:19:01,118 --> 00:19:04,380
you know basically minutes later be testing the transitions between

280
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,241
various pieces in the game and just seeing

281
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:09,542
kind of how it fit together in the score.

282
00:19:09,923 --> 00:19:11,724
And the thing that was cool about this visual thing is

283
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:15,366
for adventure games, which is the type of game we were mostly working on,

284
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:19,368
a mental picture of the universe,

285
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:20,889
of all the places you can go,

286
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,851
because you're constantly going from one place to another

287
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:24,792
in a, uh, in an adventure game.

288
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:28,335
That mental picture is really nice to have a visual for.

289
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:33,138
And, um, again, it gave this sort of visceral connection

290
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:38,202
between, uh, the composer and the actual audio experience

291
00:19:39,142 --> 00:19:40,724
that the listener was ultimately gonna have.

292
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:43,966
And I'm gonna actually, um, take a little...

293
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,204
detour here. And we're going to go...

294
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:55,411
How many of you guys are...

295
00:19:58,065 --> 00:20:01,628
How many of you are too young to really remember this screen clearly?

296
00:20:01,648 --> 00:20:02,008
I wonder.

297
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,192
So, there's an ancient Mac

298
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:13,137
being emulated in my modern-day laptop here.

299
00:20:13,577 --> 00:20:15,879
And here's our little tool. It's called iMac.

300
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,922
And when you launch it...

301
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:22,284
Oh, my goodness! Look at all those errors. Remember those errors?

302
00:20:22,324 --> 00:20:24,426
Don't worry. It's OK. It's OK.

303
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:26,167
It's all right. It's cool.

304
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,383
So, this is the script that I wrote for Year 2 of Grim Fandango.

305
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:37,564
And what you would do is you would...

306
00:20:38,684 --> 00:20:40,585
I think it's under this menu. No.

307
00:20:41,925 --> 00:20:42,505
There it is.

308
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:46,747
You could create a button simply by...

309
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,981
Let's try a new sequence.

310
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,381
No, it doesn't like that right now.

311
00:20:52,882 --> 00:20:54,262
Anyway, you would create a button.

312
00:20:54,442 --> 00:20:57,344
You would enter a little code into it.

313
00:20:57,944 --> 00:21:00,005
Then the button would appear on here.

314
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:02,566
You could draw these lines just sort of

315
00:21:02,686 --> 00:21:04,347
as a mnemonic device to yourself.

316
00:21:04,407 --> 00:21:07,769
You could remember what rooms connect to which other rooms.

317
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:10,170
And then you could play a piece

318
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,891
and then play another piece

319
00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:15,733
and then listen to the transition actually execute.

320
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:16,753
And...

321
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:22,736
When you did this, this corresponded to stuff.

322
00:21:25,098 --> 00:21:28,580
Do I want to do it in an H file?

323
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:30,022
Right.

324
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:32,784
And this is where we would enter all the data.

325
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:34,985
Just by hand.

326
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:37,367
It really wasn't very hard.

327
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:42,111
You basically listed all the pieces of music.

328
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:45,130
And then transition types.

329
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,154
And there are a bunch of codes that gave information about how

330
00:21:50,314 --> 00:21:52,916
the transition was supposed to behave between

331
00:21:52,956 --> 00:21:53,877
different pieces of music.

332
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:57,680
Is that a we're almost?

333
00:21:59,021 --> 00:21:59,842
Oh, five minutes.

334
00:22:00,282 --> 00:22:01,083
Holy crap.

335
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:02,624
OK.

336
00:22:02,944 --> 00:22:03,244
Anyway.

337
00:22:04,585 --> 00:22:07,888
So very quickly, right now this sounds like this, which

338
00:22:07,948 --> 00:22:08,548
isn't very good.

339
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:10,350
Oh, I don't hear anything.

340
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:10,770
Oh, well.

341
00:22:11,671 --> 00:22:11,931
Oh, yeah.

342
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:16,396
Yeah, sorry, that's a bug.

343
00:22:17,097 --> 00:22:19,378
It works on a G4, but it doesn't work on my emulator.

344
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:22,581
But you get the idea of what this was.

345
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:24,042
And what it really allowed you to do

346
00:22:24,502 --> 00:22:29,586
was to just experience, essentially,

347
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:31,668
what you were doing without having to code up the game.

348
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,870
It was a great tool, and I wish we had more stuff like it now.

349
00:22:39,294 --> 00:22:40,615
So let me go back into.

350
00:22:48,254 --> 00:22:49,356
Let's go to here.

351
00:22:50,357 --> 00:22:51,279
So takeaways.

352
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,502
Five minutes takeaways coming up here.

353
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:55,244
First, there's stuff to throw out.

354
00:22:55,404 --> 00:22:55,684
OK?

355
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:58,388
No, not that.

356
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:00,371
Or that.

357
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:02,994
That's the real boring story, by the way.

358
00:23:05,158 --> 00:23:09,160
I think in some ways it's a nice thing that we don't have to wear as many hats as we used to.

359
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:17,063
I think those of us who are working on really, you know, cutting-edge small projects can appreciate, though, that it was cool to wear a lot of hats.

360
00:23:17,123 --> 00:23:26,247
So, so, just beware of how many hats you're wearing and, and, you know, don't wear more than you have to, but don't wear too few either, really.

361
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:28,888
Yeah, see, that's guys wearing too many.

362
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,097
Unnecessary tweakery.

363
00:23:31,718 --> 00:23:34,840
You know, we were given this mandate to do cool stuff.

364
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,904
And, you know, without a clear fear of the bottom line,

365
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:43,387
there was definitely a certain amount of self-indulgence that

366
00:23:43,427 --> 00:23:45,028
went on, which we could have done without.

367
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:47,330
Pennywise and pound foolish.

368
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,833
Sometimes when you're doing a small project, when you're

369
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:51,173
doing a

370
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:58,470
you know, something by your bootstraps, you will economize in places where you should

371
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:04,291
not. I really wish we had bought those Pro Tools systems, OK? Would have been nice. We

372
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:07,331
had to wait till Grim Fandango to get them, I think, if I remember right.

373
00:24:10,412 --> 00:24:20,054
But good takeaways, right? The spirit of invention, I think, is something that is, can sometimes

374
00:24:20,114 --> 00:24:21,914
be lost when you have a lot of resources.

375
00:24:23,055 --> 00:24:30,543
And one thing that I think I'd like to sort of try to get across is this idea of, well,

376
00:24:30,663 --> 00:24:34,708
if necessity is the mother of invention, but you don't have a lot of necessity in the sense

377
00:24:34,748 --> 00:24:39,012
that you have a lot of great resources and you have, you know, a lot of possibilities

378
00:24:39,032 --> 00:24:40,934
of what you can do, what do you do with that?

379
00:24:42,576 --> 00:24:47,439
Really interesting thing is to essentially create your own necessity make your own

380
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:56,645
Self-limiting decisions that focus your statement. Okay, so Frank Zappa every year used to send flowers to Edgard Verraz

381
00:24:56,685 --> 00:24:58,566
Now I don't know if you guys know who Edgard Verraz was

382
00:24:58,966 --> 00:25:05,870
But he wrote all of 14 pieces in his entire life and yet somehow by writing just 14 pieces

383
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:10,973
He had more impact than most composers of the 20th century. He was an amazing composer

384
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:21,193
Igor Stravinsky at a time when people were getting totally complex and wrote, you know,

385
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:26,437
and writing atonal music, Igor Stravinsky decided to write a symphony in C. What a great

386
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:26,958
idea.

387
00:25:27,098 --> 00:25:33,282
He, a lot of time, he used to just simply restrict himself by note choice.

388
00:25:36,065 --> 00:25:38,266
And how that translates to us today.

389
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:45,077
I think the idea of sort of self-imposed necessity or self-limitation is just remembering that

390
00:25:45,517 --> 00:25:48,318
high production values don't necessarily make art, right?

391
00:25:49,238 --> 00:25:56,880
And in that sense, Laura Shigihara, original Plants vs. Zombies composer, you know, she's

392
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,420
a genius.

393
00:26:03,307 --> 00:26:10,072
perfect set of sounds, which are not big, but they're small, because the game is not big.

394
00:26:10,132 --> 00:26:16,236
It's small, but it's wonderful. That kind of creativity, I think, is something that, you know, you only get

395
00:26:17,237 --> 00:26:22,820
once in a while, and it reminds me of that time. And since a lot of us now are working on

396
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,782
mobile projects, or we're working on

397
00:26:26,203 --> 00:26:29,365
you know, independent or so-called casual projects.

398
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:31,347
I think that's a great thing to keep in mind.

399
00:26:31,927 --> 00:26:37,191
Nothing wrong, by the way, with having big resources.

400
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:39,993
I mean, I do not think there is a wasted note in the Halo score.

401
00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:41,174
That is awesome.

402
00:26:41,374 --> 00:26:43,976
I don't want to try to get too, like, reverse snob here.

403
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,492
Finally, there are just sort of cultural things.

404
00:26:49,552 --> 00:26:52,535
Like I said, learning to wear the right number of hats.

405
00:26:52,555 --> 00:26:54,737
I was glad I did the programming.

406
00:26:54,757 --> 00:26:56,218
I was glad I did the music.

407
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:59,641
I really did prefer to do the music in the end,

408
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,923
and I was glad to be able to finally get

409
00:27:01,983 --> 00:27:04,285
the one part of things to the point

410
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:05,547
where I could do the other more.

411
00:27:06,768 --> 00:27:10,291
So it's great that we don't have to do, I'm being cut off.

412
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,220
Be in-house even when you're out-house.

413
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,522
Pretend like you are part of the team even when you are working outside

414
00:27:17,562 --> 00:27:20,983
of the house, because more of us are out of house now than used to be.

415
00:27:21,484 --> 00:27:23,885
Not in the out-house, as Brian said, but out of house.

416
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:27,246
And finally, make it fun.

417
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:31,588
You know, it's all about, I really, really look.

418
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:35,836
back finally on the spirit that we had in those days of just fun.

419
00:27:36,516 --> 00:27:40,817
And I think there's a lot of that still today, and it's something we never want to lose.

420
00:27:41,157 --> 00:27:42,917
And I'll take questions if we have time.

421
00:27:42,937 --> 00:27:53,639
If anybody has a question, they could probably come up to the mic.

422
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,120
That would be the best way to do it.

423
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,760
We actually have a 30-minute break after this.

424
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:57,920
Oh, okay.

425
00:28:01,052 --> 00:28:03,912
Cool. Oh, okay, so I didn't have to race like that?

426
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,673
Oh, okay, well, I had some very profound things that I went through very quickly.

427
00:28:10,853 --> 00:28:11,113
Yes.

428
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:18,875
What do you make of the whole retro revival that sort of has been happening,

429
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:22,956
where, you know, a lot of these music for games are starting to sound more like 8-bit?

430
00:28:23,556 --> 00:28:26,436
Do you think something was lost in the high production values?

431
00:28:26,796 --> 00:28:27,916
Why do you think that's happening?

432
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:36,539
Well, it sort of goes to my point there about, you know, what do you do in this time when you can do whatever you want, right?

433
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,363
And I think it can be great and it can be annoying.

434
00:28:41,523 --> 00:28:45,907
And the thing is to try to, the question is, is it done with the right spirit?

435
00:28:46,948 --> 00:28:53,313
Is it done with a respect for the original sound or the original intent?

436
00:28:53,373 --> 00:28:56,256
Which may be, like for instance, Grim Fandango, right?

437
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,873
I was so proud of that game when it came out, but I winced every time I heard the stuff

438
00:29:01,913 --> 00:29:03,275
that wasn't live.

439
00:29:03,635 --> 00:29:06,737
We did not have a budget for that.

440
00:29:06,857 --> 00:29:11,281
I am not nostalgic for the fact that we did not have a budget to do an orchestra for Grimm.

441
00:29:11,561 --> 00:29:14,223
There is nothing great about that.

442
00:29:15,124 --> 00:29:21,709
One of the best gifts to me as an artist was to be able to redo that with a live orchestra.

443
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,551
Of course we try not to...

444
00:29:25,453 --> 00:29:29,538
Get into colorizing film as it were right. We don't want to ruin the original

445
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:36,787
The original feeling but we want to be able to do what we wanted to do so so does that answer your question?

446
00:29:37,951 --> 00:29:38,151
Sorta.

447
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:38,571
Sorta.

448
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:40,172
And it's like, what about the,

449
00:29:40,252 --> 00:29:42,473
you're talking about like the chip tune thing, you know?

450
00:29:42,513 --> 00:29:45,454
I'm talking about projects kind of like Fez,

451
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,495
where it's like, it's trying to bring back, I guess,

452
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,317
a lot of the stuff that was good about it,

453
00:29:51,337 --> 00:29:53,718
I mean the self-imposed limitations, you know,

454
00:29:53,838 --> 00:29:55,919
now it's like we have to self-impose them,

455
00:29:55,979 --> 00:29:57,719
whereas before, you know,

456
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,241
so I guess I was just wondering your take on it,

457
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:02,441
because, yeah, I don't know.

458
00:30:03,082 --> 00:30:03,442
Yeah.

459
00:30:04,582 --> 00:30:04,883
I think,

460
00:30:05,783 --> 00:30:07,404
I think retro stuff is awesome.

461
00:30:07,645 --> 00:30:13,589
And I'm, first of all, I'm grateful for the attention to stuff of that time, because I think, you know,

462
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:17,993
we have, one of the things, you know, Tommy Tallarico, Video Games Live,

463
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:22,497
one of the things he does so wonderfully is he reminds us that we have a culture,

464
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:26,160
that we have a history, that we have literature now, a body of work.

465
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,183
And part of that body of work is, you know, the original Mario theme.

466
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:31,744
And part of that body of work is God of War.

467
00:30:33,906 --> 00:30:41,396
And I think that, if you're asking, well, is it kind of gimmicky to do, and yes, sometimes

468
00:30:41,436 --> 00:30:46,422
it is kind of gimmicky, but it can be done right so that it's like, hey, check this out,

469
00:30:46,802 --> 00:30:50,126
this is like a body of, this is part of our canon.

470
00:30:50,687 --> 00:30:51,708
You know, I think that's cool.

471
00:30:52,329 --> 00:30:52,469
Cool.

472
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:52,790
Thank you.

473
00:30:56,338 --> 00:31:00,421
Hi, just out of curiosity, there's a tool called Max MSP,

474
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:03,764
and I was curious if you found that as a suitable substitute

475
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:07,306
for setting up and kind of putting together the room idea.

476
00:31:07,687 --> 00:31:10,008
You did notice that that resembled Max a little bit,

477
00:31:10,108 --> 00:31:11,610
yes.

478
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,191
Max was too geeky for us.

479
00:31:17,486 --> 00:31:20,469
We found it did a lot of things that we weren't very interested in.

480
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:28,235
And I've done performances with Max, and I have a lot of respect for that whole ear-com,

481
00:31:29,296 --> 00:31:32,079
you know, tinkering with electronic music.

482
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:37,443
It was a little less grounded in the type of things that we wanted to do, though.

483
00:31:37,483 --> 00:31:38,424
What we wanted to do was...

484
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:42,325
basically imitate a pit orchestra.

485
00:31:42,386 --> 00:31:44,566
There's a performance on stage, there's a conductor,

486
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:47,888
he's watching the performance, and he's like conducting,

487
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:51,069
he's like, measure 32, now, right?

488
00:31:51,229 --> 00:31:52,529
And that's what we wanted to have.

489
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,090
And that's not Max.

490
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,371
That's my news.

491
00:31:57,471 --> 00:31:57,611
Cool.

492
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:01,713
And FMOD and WISE and a lot of the tools that we have now,

493
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,654
and EXACT, and I mean, it's, you know,

494
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:07,275
there's been a lot of stuff coming down the pike since then.

495
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:08,566
Thank you.

496
00:32:12,207 --> 00:32:14,808
You talked a lot about programs where you had to program them yourself.

497
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,929
You programmed them yourself, like WMAC.

498
00:32:17,389 --> 00:32:18,849
Is there still value in doing that,

499
00:32:18,889 --> 00:32:20,550
or would you rather be leaning on Pro Tools

500
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,110
in those modern programs of today?

501
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:25,511
I think there is actually still value in doing that.

502
00:32:28,032 --> 00:32:31,553
It depends on what you think you're going to get out of it.

503
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:34,574
Right? I mean, specifically...

504
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:40,099
Well, do you mean like the thing I showed you?

505
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:43,827
How I'd like to see that happen today is I'd like to

506
00:32:43,907 --> 00:32:46,533
see Y's allow you to create buttons.

507
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:51,583
and not have to deal with object-oriented programming when you're trying to write music.

508
00:32:52,484 --> 00:32:58,912
Sorry, guys.

509
00:32:59,452 --> 00:33:04,698
One thing that we were very big on was not only getting under the hood and making it cool inside,

510
00:33:04,758 --> 00:33:08,102
but also having respect for the fact that when you're trying to...

511
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:10,905
write music at three in the morning,

512
00:33:11,285 --> 00:33:13,127
and it has to be done tomorrow,

513
00:33:13,307 --> 00:33:14,768
and you want to do something cool,

514
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:15,989
the last thing you want to do

515
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,892
is get out of your right brain,

516
00:33:18,932 --> 00:33:20,714
that's the creative one, right, supposedly,

517
00:33:21,194 --> 00:33:23,816
and go to that other brain and start writing C code.

518
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:27,720
So we wrote C code, but it wasn't very much.

519
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,821
Anyway, yeah.

520
00:33:30,863 --> 00:33:32,644
Hi, what new games are you playing,

521
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:33,986
and who do you feel like is pushing

522
00:33:34,026 --> 00:33:35,587
the genre of adventure games?

523
00:33:36,866 --> 00:33:42,750
Well, I'm kind of biased on that one.

524
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:46,813
You know, I think Tim Schafer is the most amazing game designer who ever drew breath,

525
00:33:46,873 --> 00:33:54,479
so that's just my, and I have worked for him for many, many years, so I think that's, you

526
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:57,661
know, so I'm sorry for Peter.

527
00:33:59,082 --> 00:33:59,282
Sorry.

528
00:33:59,302 --> 00:33:59,663
Thank you.

529
00:33:59,723 --> 00:34:01,484
Hi there.

530
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:07,638
You brought up Super Mario when back to like old school music and that got me thinking about how

531
00:34:08,118 --> 00:34:13,602
it seems like there's a recent phenomenon like a certain philosophy of game writers where you have

532
00:34:13,642 --> 00:34:18,645
to avoid the repetitive. Like you have to make sure that if they're going to be stuck in the

533
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:22,107
same spot for like five minutes then you can't have anything that's too repetitive or anthemic

534
00:34:22,647 --> 00:34:27,411
otherwise it just gets grating. But then you for the same token you also look back on these older

535
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:30,833
games for like the Nintendo like the Super Marios and the Zeldas and the Pokemons.

536
00:34:31,293 --> 00:34:36,875
And all that, like, what really makes those is the sort of musâ€” is that very anthemic sort of music that goes along with it.

537
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:42,098
So I'm wondering, like, is that style of, like, very anthemic, melody-driven music in-game,

538
00:34:42,678 --> 00:34:45,279
like, is that really just sort of, like, fading out at this point?

539
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:47,420
Or is that really just some small sector that think it is?

540
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,462
Oh, no, I don't think so at all. I think a lot of people are doing melodic, anthemicâ€”

541
00:34:52,482 --> 00:34:56,305
I mean, yes, there's just so much variety now.

542
00:34:56,365 --> 00:34:59,747
There are situations for which just dust isn't appropriate,

543
00:34:59,787 --> 00:35:03,609
you know, something that's more atmospheric or dark or action-oriented.

544
00:35:03,649 --> 00:35:05,330
There are parts where you don't want to be,

545
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,291
a melody would be distracting, right?

546
00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:09,612
And then there are other parts of the same kind of game

547
00:35:09,632 --> 00:35:12,334
that need to be very, you know, righteous and thematic.

548
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:14,655
And so, no, I think...

549
00:35:17,897 --> 00:35:20,518
I'm not, I don't really subscribe to,

550
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:21,958
oh those were the good old days.

551
00:35:21,978 --> 00:35:24,679
You know, you know, you take a guy like Frankie,

552
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:27,160
when you have lived and loved like Frankie has,

553
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,980
now that guy could sing a tune, right?

554
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,061
There is sort of that feeling maybe

555
00:35:32,201 --> 00:35:33,362
about the old game music.

556
00:35:34,102 --> 00:35:35,423
And it's true when you.

557
00:35:36,383 --> 00:35:39,604
only have a sound blaster to come out of,

558
00:35:39,745 --> 00:35:41,305
and it's got to sound good on an AdLib,

559
00:35:41,605 --> 00:35:42,906
the tune had better be good.

560
00:35:43,006 --> 00:35:44,247
That's absolutely true.

561
00:35:45,027 --> 00:35:47,008
But that doesn't mean the tune can't be good now.

562
00:35:47,048 --> 00:35:49,429
And part of the challenge of, you know,

563
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:53,851
this sort of wealth of opportunity that we have

564
00:35:54,391 --> 00:35:57,893
is to kind of keep that simplicity in mind.

565
00:35:57,913 --> 00:35:59,694
And that's sort of where we get back to the idea

566
00:35:59,714 --> 00:36:01,255
of imposing your own restrictions.

567
00:36:01,275 --> 00:36:02,415
All right. Thank you.

568
00:36:06,148 --> 00:36:06,472
All set?

569
00:36:06,492 --> 00:36:07,160
All right.
