1
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:07,999
Hi.

2
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:08,599
Is this on?

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:09,900
Okay.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,362
I'm Chris Graft, editor-in-chief of Gamasutra.

5
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:19,847
We are a website about game development.

6
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:23,609
And we have here Zach Barth.

7
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,951
Welcome Zach.

8
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:26,171
Yeah.

9
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:27,792
Zach.

10
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:37,377
Zach is the maker of games that make me feel like an idiot and also a genius.

11
00:00:37,377 --> 00:00:44,120
These games include, just in case no one knows, you just showed up randomly to this talk at

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,122
5.30 on Monday, Spacechem, TIS-100, Infinifactory, Ironclad Tactics, these aren't all of them

13
00:00:50,122 --> 00:00:55,265
either, Opus Magnum, Infiniminer, Shenzhen IO, which is up for the IGF.

14
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:58,399
excellence in design this year.

15
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,820
What do you think about that?

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,002
That's pretty neat, huh?

17
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:04,022
Yes.

18
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:04,942
We'll see.

19
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:08,784
So hopefully you can get a few insights from Zach

20
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:14,127
that may or may absolutely not be applicable to your current.

21
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:17,785
I can't guarantee you're going to learn anything here.

22
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:20,046
It might not feel lesson.

23
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:20,126
Yeah.

24
00:01:20,126 --> 00:01:27,592
So anyhow, first thing I want to ask, because your games are so unique, so I want to hear

25
00:01:27,592 --> 00:01:28,593
how you define them.

26
00:01:28,593 --> 00:01:32,256
So what is a Zachtronics game in your mind?

27
00:01:32,256 --> 00:01:32,596
Oh, okay.

28
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:36,939
So there's a term that I've seen online, the Zacht-like, which I'm not really a fan of.

29
00:01:39,502 --> 00:01:43,565
I can't say that you like that when it's, you know.

30
00:01:43,565 --> 00:01:46,446
So, the term I like to use is Zachtronics-style puzzle game.

31
00:01:46,446 --> 00:01:50,429
So, notably like Ironclad Tactics is a game by Zachtronics

32
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:51,689
that does not fit that really.

33
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,011
And like from like a marketing standpoint, like.

34
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,572
all of our other games and then Ironclad Tactics.

35
00:01:56,572 --> 00:01:57,572
It did not sell very well.

36
00:01:57,572 --> 00:01:59,913
So, but the rest of our puzzle games have done,

37
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:00,774
you know, they're sort of like

38
00:02:00,774 --> 00:02:02,154
in the same magnitude as each other.

39
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:05,256
Probably the biggest thing that defines them

40
00:02:05,256 --> 00:02:06,836
is their open-endedness, right?

41
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:08,277
Like they're, I mean, even the word,

42
00:02:08,277 --> 00:02:10,058
the word puzzle game is really useless.

43
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:15,060
because there's so many different kinds of games that fall into the bucket of puzzle games.

44
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,661
So our, but our puzzle games, things they have in common is they're usually about like an engineering topic.

45
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:24,543
We give you a set of tools, and then with those tools we give you a set of challenges that are created.

46
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:28,324
They're, I mean I don't know what defines an open-ended challenge other than that

47
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:31,385
there's a lot of different solutions that you can build to these challenges.

48
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,006
So I guess by definition they're open-ended.

49
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:36,822
Yeah, and an interesting description I heard you actually say,

50
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:39,302
they're like about optimization.

51
00:02:39,302 --> 00:02:41,463
Yeah, well that's like a second order thing.

52
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:44,404
Like you can play a Zachtronics game and never worry about optimizing,

53
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:47,525
but they facilitate optimization because there's so many different puzzles.

54
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:49,865
Like a puzzle game with one solution, there's just one solution.

55
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:52,466
So if you get there, you're done. That's literally all there is.

56
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:55,126
If a puzzle has like a thousand solutions,

57
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:57,947
maybe you can come up with criteria where some of them are better than others.

58
00:02:58,267 --> 00:03:01,749
And if you can create criteria that make some solutions better than others, now you have

59
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:06,132
an optimization game and people can try to, like, go from a bad solution to a better solution

60
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:07,813
instead of merely getting the solution.

61
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:12,916
So that optimization, in practice optimization is a large part of it for a lot of people.

62
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,738
We recently added something called hermit mode to Opus Magnum.

63
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:19,840
One percent of our players turn on hermit mode, which is where it shuts off all the

64
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,061
histograms and leaderboards.

65
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:23,162
There's a lot.

66
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:24,703
We've actually gotten a fair number of people

67
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:26,083
who are like, I like these games,

68
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,384
but I actually get either derailed or demoralized

69
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,865
by seeing other people's scores.

70
00:03:29,865 --> 00:03:32,126
And so we reluctantly added this feature.

71
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:33,647
But it was good.

72
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,208
There's 1% of people that are maybe actual hermits.

73
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,029
Yeah, exactly.

74
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:37,689
You know, it's cool.

75
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:40,590
You should be able to play the game that way if you want.

76
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,311
I think that's fair.

77
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,392
It's worked out.

78
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:43,632
Yeah.

79
00:03:43,632 --> 00:03:45,333
Well, that's very thoughtful of you to do that.

80
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:50,307
So, one of the games in your early career,

81
00:03:50,307 --> 00:03:52,928
and I want to talk about this,

82
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:54,289
it's, of course, Infiniminer.

83
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:57,791
And I would like to know what it was like

84
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,932
making something like Infiniminer,

85
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:02,993
coming up with that concept and then seeing it

86
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,374
totally explode and...

87
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:07,875
In the form of someone else's game.

88
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,436
In a bank account that was not yours.

89
00:04:09,436 --> 00:04:10,036
Yeah, yeah.

90
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:14,640
I mean, one way to describe it maybe is that it was like a car crash in slow motion.

91
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,263
Like over the course of like a bunch of years, just...

92
00:04:19,263 --> 00:04:23,666
There's a lot of complex emotions that come with something like that.

93
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:27,629
Like there's stuff I've talked about publicly, and then there's like, I don't talk about

94
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:28,850
all my feelings publicly.

95
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,534
Let's talk about all the feelings you haven't made public yet.

96
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:34,234
There's too many.

97
00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:36,256
So I don't really remember a lot of it super well.

98
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:36,956
Because it's been years.

99
00:04:36,956 --> 00:04:38,137
I mean, it's been like...

100
00:04:38,137 --> 00:04:39,878
I don't even know when Infinimary came out.

101
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:39,958
Like 2009?

102
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:44,885
Right, like it's been a long time. There's a lot of stuff. There's there's a lot of moments that I remember

103
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,867
I mean there I was I was a CA

104
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:51,808
And was was working the IGF. That's the volunteers here

105
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:55,970
I was working the IGF festival award ceremony when notch was up and won

106
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,473
Every award or whatever and I was sitting in the back just yelling at people who were trying to record it

107
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:02,133
We like turn off your camera. Don't record this

108
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:06,270
And like, I just had to be back there watching it.

109
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,711
And it's like, wow, that's like a weird thing.

110
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:11,211
Like, it was weird and it was complicated.

111
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,712
And like, it's like my-

112
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,932
In the back with a bottle of wine,

113
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:16,773
just like start sickly clapping.

114
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:17,613
I wish, right?

115
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:18,733
Like, no, not even.

116
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:19,833
Just had to sit there and watch it.

117
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,714
And there's just weird stuff.

118
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:21,774
Like the time I was at Target with my wife

119
00:05:21,774 --> 00:05:24,335
and there's like a whole rack of like Minecraft shit.

120
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:24,595
Oh God.

121
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:27,555
And it's just like, oh yeah, those are t-shirts for kids.

122
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:28,856
Like, that's good.

123
00:05:28,856 --> 00:05:29,616
Well.

124
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:31,954
Sorry I had to...

125
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:32,635
No, it's okay.

126
00:05:32,635 --> 00:05:33,797
I mean, it's...

127
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:35,720
There's a lot of stuff there, right?

128
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,342
And so now I'm totally okay with it.

129
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:38,785
Just because, like, it happens, right?

130
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:42,230
And like, as we can see, like, it doesn't necessarily make your life better or make

131
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,674
you happier to have a success like that.

132
00:05:44,674 --> 00:05:45,996
And like...

133
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:51,523
Just, just, just, that's not based on anything that's actually happening.

134
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:55,067
That sounds like I'm trying to be mean, but it's true, right?

135
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:59,893
Like success, like we act like success is the goal, but like success is not everything.

136
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:03,458
Like there's more to life than succeeding financially.

137
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,699
It helps I guess, but.

138
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:11,150
It's not going to help you make more money, unfortunately.

139
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,430
Yeah.

140
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,151
And that's why I brought it up, not just to pick at the scab.

141
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:22,433
But the idea of success as in India, especially today,

142
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:25,014
it's such a hard-fought thing to achieve.

143
00:06:25,014 --> 00:06:26,955
And you fight tooth and nail for something,

144
00:06:26,955 --> 00:06:30,075
and then you see, in that particular case,

145
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:33,056
it snatched away in such a dramatic way.

146
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,545
I don't know what my question was.

147
00:06:36,545 --> 00:06:37,526
Yeah, that's okay.

148
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:37,606
Yeah.

149
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:37,806
Yeah.

150
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:39,648
There's not an answer either, so it's okay.

151
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:43,934
Yeah, you already gave a great answer, so yeah.

152
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:51,263
So even though, you know, there was Infiniminer, you've managed to keep on making games and

153
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:55,167
You know, how do you, what's your mindset, you know,

154
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:58,910
when maybe post-infiniminer even, you're just like,

155
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,491
okay, I'm just gonna keep on doing it,

156
00:07:00,491 --> 00:07:01,773
and you keep on doing it well,

157
00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:02,934
and you maintain productivity.

158
00:07:02,934 --> 00:07:05,316
So how do you get in that mindset,

159
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:06,737
and how do you put it into practice?

160
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:08,960
So notably, Infiniminer was a free game.

161
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,660
I did not sell it.

162
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,662
We didn't sell games back then.

163
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:12,283
I just made it.

164
00:07:12,283 --> 00:07:15,446
And I mean, perhaps if it had been a couple years later when

165
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:17,929
we were selling games, maybe it would have ended up differently.

166
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:19,110
So Infiniminer comes out.

167
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,272
It does its little thing.

168
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:23,115
I was honestly more upset with Infiniminer that I made this

169
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:25,918
game that people liked it, but it wasn't really good enough.

170
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:27,820
And people liked parts of it that I wasn't able to really

171
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,921
capitalize on.

172
00:07:29,722 --> 00:07:31,483
It was in C sharp and it was unobfuscated.

173
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:32,744
So then like the source code,

174
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:33,945
like I was publishing the source code

175
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:35,627
without even realizing it basically.

176
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:37,529
And like people were making like hacked versions

177
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:39,290
of the clients that ran the way they wanted.

178
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,192
And like, I'm making games because I want to do something,

179
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:43,554
like I want to exercise my vision creatively.

180
00:07:43,554 --> 00:07:44,655
And it turns out that when you're just kind of

181
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:46,636
putting games out there in this weird amorphous way,

182
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:48,318
like you're not in control necessarily.

183
00:07:48,318 --> 00:07:50,200
And so I made this game and I wasn't in control.

184
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,800
I was really upset.

185
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,522
I was like, fuck it, I'm gonna stop making games.

186
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:53,843
Am I allowed to use profanity in this?

187
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:54,483
Fuck yeah.

188
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:56,404
Yeah.

189
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:56,604
OK.

190
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:59,085
Yeah, so I actually, there's like a post if you go back

191
00:07:59,085 --> 00:07:59,666
to my old blog.

192
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,667
It's like, I'm going to stop making games for a while.

193
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:02,427
Sorry, guys.

194
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:04,228
And it was like, really like, what the hell?

195
00:08:04,228 --> 00:08:05,208
I don't know.

196
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,889
I was in a weird state, I guess.

197
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:09,771
But like a year later, I was like, man, I've

198
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:10,811
got to make some games.

199
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:13,633
And that was when, after seeing games starting to be sold,

200
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:15,654
I was like, we should make a game and sell it.

201
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:16,814
And so I got some friends.

202
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:18,895
Usually I just would make games by myself and then

203
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:20,136
force a friend to play it.

204
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:22,217
I don't mean to interrupt, but it's interesting.

205
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:22,697
Here you go.

206
00:08:23,117 --> 00:08:24,078
You know what I might do?

207
00:08:24,078 --> 00:08:26,099
I might make a game and then have people

208
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,199
give me money for it.

209
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,240
No, it's crazy.

210
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,721
I made my Flash games, and people are like, you should

211
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:31,722
put it on Kongregate.

212
00:08:31,722 --> 00:08:32,702
You can get money for that.

213
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:34,083
I'm just like, no, I don't want it.

214
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,324
I really wanted nothing to do with that.

215
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:37,585
And in retrospect, it's crazy.

216
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:38,965
I'm like money hungry now.

217
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:40,726
Yeah, I got it.

218
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:42,627
What's that, SpaceChemMuncher?

219
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:43,128
Yeah, exactly.

220
00:08:43,128 --> 00:08:44,488
Yeah, well, so we made SpaceChem.

221
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:46,069
I recruited some friends to help with it.

222
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:48,911
I guess like Braid had come out at that point, and like

223
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:49,391
World of Goo.

224
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:50,772
And it's like, OK, there's like a pattern here.

225
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:52,533
We can make a game and sell it.

226
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,633
We applied to be on Steam.

227
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,694
They rejected us.

228
00:08:55,694 --> 00:08:57,295
Imagine that, right?

229
00:08:57,295 --> 00:08:58,436
Yes, seriously.

230
00:08:59,116 --> 00:09:00,517
i don't think you have a problem anymore

231
00:09:00,517 --> 00:09:04,138
so we were like you know what the hell with it like we'll make our own store

232
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:06,479
and sell it ourselves we made space cam uh...

233
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,721
i everybody was all rev share cuz back when you did that is people still do

234
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:13,602
that but was all rev share i paid some dude uh... five thousand dollars i

235
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:15,783
think to do all the art that was the total cost unlike

236
00:09:15,783 --> 00:09:18,144
if we're lucky will make ten grand off this game

237
00:09:18,144 --> 00:09:18,745
and then like

238
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:22,026
the game comes out like it starts picking up steam rock-paper-shotgun

239
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:25,227
covers it you know we hundred thousand dollars three hundred dollars i said to

240
00:09:25,227 --> 00:09:27,768
myself i was like if we make a hundred thousand dollars game equip my job i

241
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,329
worked at microsoft i was not a fan

242
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:30,169
uh...

243
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,890
when i quit my job we're gonna go into your or whatever i guess that we can call

244
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,071
it that we're gonna make it and so we got a thousand like i'm not enough

245
00:09:36,071 --> 00:09:37,472
actually to run a studio i need my

246
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:40,993
as i can be at the three hundred thousand we're gonna do it and we did

247
00:09:41,654 --> 00:09:45,417
And then, like, yeah, okay, we quit Microsoft

248
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,038
and we started up the studio,

249
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:48,920
and that was sort of how we made that transition.

250
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,062
And I think from then on, it's just been every day,

251
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:52,884
like, get up, make games.

252
00:09:53,986 --> 00:09:56,548
And then you go to Target and you see Space Jam shirts, right?

253
00:09:56,548 --> 00:09:56,628
Yeah.

254
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:58,690
The kids are wearing them.

255
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,932
You've got to make your own, unfortunately.

256
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:03,754
Yeah, so I mean, it's interesting.

257
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:06,416
And I think it's something that a lot of people in this room

258
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,779
could probably relate to is there is,

259
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,501
I don't know if it's exactly imposter syndrome or what,

260
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:14,703
but just like, yeah, I don't want to sell this.

261
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:15,363
No one's going to buy it.

262
00:10:15,363 --> 00:10:16,664
Did you have that in your head then?

263
00:10:16,664 --> 00:10:18,285
Just because there's no way that someone

264
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,627
would give me money for this?

265
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:21,168
It just seemed crazy.

266
00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:24,468
like people were really buying indy games in the ones that were like the

267
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:28,409
they stuck out for an unclear reasons like why breed right like

268
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:31,149
the circumstances right

269
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:33,130
and so like

270
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,990
yeah i just didn't is i wasn't even that i mean i am talk full of imposter

271
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,971
syndrome but like it was just like

272
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,351
it just didn't make sense right and i was like when when minecraft is selling

273
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:44,652
with like the thing where it gets more expensive the longer you go on and like

274
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:47,832
nobody knew what was going on in humble bundle was like a thing then they're

275
00:10:47,832 --> 00:10:50,693
like oh we're not going to pay for games anymore except we will and it's like

276
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:53,534
Like, no one knew what was going on then, right?

277
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:56,115
Like, by comparison, everything is really rigid now, I think.

278
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:58,096
Like, it's either free to play and you're a horrible person,

279
00:10:58,096 --> 00:11:00,617
or it's like, you sell it on Steam.

280
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:03,458
And sorry, that was meant to be an aggressive comment.

281
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,179
I don't actually believe that.

282
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:07,060
But yeah, like, it was crazy back then,

283
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,101
like the models of how you might make money or might not.

284
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:12,162
Like, I wasn't in it for the money.

285
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:13,503
Yeah.

286
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:15,964
But it's so much easier now, though, right?

287
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:21,210
In some ways, I mean, it's not easier because it doesn't, it shouldn't be easier, right?

288
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,634
Like you're, I don't know, there's a fixed amount of money and you're competing and there's

289
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:27,678
a bunch of stuff and people only buy stuff they know about and that's a tough game.

290
00:11:27,678 --> 00:11:29,680
But like, there's models for it at least.

291
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,924
I don't know if it's better, I mean I don't have to say which one's better or worse.

292
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:36,568
I'm glad I got to do my thing when I did, because I think that was important for me.

293
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:42,426
What about with, I don't even want to say it, but Indiepocalypse.

294
00:11:42,426 --> 00:11:48,127
People talk about that, and really all that means is just there's a shillet of games everywhere.

295
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:51,228
How do you navigate that?

296
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:51,588
I don't know.

297
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:52,128
I don't have to.

298
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,329
Okay, next question.

299
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:54,809
No, no.

300
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:56,450
We launched SpaceChem back before.

301
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,150
It was different.

302
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:01,711
When SpaceChem got on Steam, when they let us on Steam, it was like they just cut us

303
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:01,991
a check.

304
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:04,574
right because there were that there were that many in the games there were

305
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:07,177
enough in the games that like when you listen all of them we would always be

306
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:07,978
there

307
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:11,061
like and they're on steam and they'd be there every sale and that was back when

308
00:12:11,061 --> 00:12:14,786
like the discounting was crazy like they do like one day only discounts and stuff

309
00:12:14,786 --> 00:12:15,146
and

310
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:18,010
but you get a lot of money just by being physically present

311
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,613
like if you came out with space cam today like it without any of our

312
00:12:21,613 --> 00:12:24,977
previous games like I honestly don't know what happened like and that's a lot

313
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,739
of our stuff now I think sells well because like it's we have like this

314
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:32,104
track record and we've made the same game over and over again and

315
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:35,067
and it's just people know about it like that really it's I don't know I don't

316
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:39,591
yeah it's tough yeah okay so that partly answers my question how do you make a

317
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:42,955
game so fast you just you just make the same game over and over

318
00:12:43,035 --> 00:12:58,650
again. That helps. That's okay. So that's part of it, right? That is my question. How do you make games so fast? Because you've been an indie for like 10 years, right? Yeah. I mean, that's kind of also not that long of a time. But yeah, at least a whole bunch of games. Yeah. And I mean, our current goal is like, I want to release two games every year.

319
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,171
right like that's that's i can't do it that's not that's that's a little

320
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:05,092
unrealistic but that's what i want right and i think that like wanting that to be

321
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:06,572
the case is the first step

322
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:10,673
right like wanting something like that uh... we cut a lot of corners we like

323
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:11,873
recycle a lot of

324
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:14,414
just like things that we've learned like there's a reason all of our games look

325
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:15,954
exactly the same i guess right like

326
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:20,055
and we just copy and paste, we're literally copy and pasting code out of previous games

327
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:21,836
to make our new game, it helps

328
00:13:22,256 --> 00:13:25,398
And I think part of it also is that like a lot of,

329
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:26,379
that's why I did a talk at NYU,

330
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,621
and like the thing they teach at NYU Game Center

331
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:29,841
is that you should like make prototypes

332
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:30,802
and iterate and iterate.

333
00:13:30,802 --> 00:13:34,044
Like we just like make a game and just put it out there

334
00:13:34,044 --> 00:13:35,746
and like see what happens, right?

335
00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:37,807
The way you find out if your game is good is to release it.

336
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:39,628
Right? And like, that's the real test.

337
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:41,689
And like, I can't tell if our stuff is fun.

338
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:43,090
Like, I could bring some people into the office,

339
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,571
they're all gonna look like they're miserable.

340
00:13:44,571 --> 00:13:45,872
It's a Zachtronics game.

341
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:47,573
Like, they do not test well.

342
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:48,714
It does not...

343
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:50,635
It is impossible to tell if somebody is having fun

344
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:52,296
by watching them play one of our games.

345
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:52,396
But...

346
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,951
Like, they're fun enough, I guess.

347
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:56,252
I don't know, it's tough.

348
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,653
So like, I don't try to play that game, right?

349
00:13:58,653 --> 00:14:00,473
Like, we just put it out there and just try to do that.

350
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:01,654
And like, it works for now.

351
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:03,194
It's not necessarily always gonna work.

352
00:14:03,194 --> 00:14:04,615
I'm not saying you should do that,

353
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:05,215
but that's just what we do.

354
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:06,976
Yeah, there's gonna be so many, like,

355
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:08,216
people just copying their own games

356
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:09,897
over and over again after this talk, yeah.

357
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:13,499
it's okay one thing i heard i was about and for lunch recently and one of the

358
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:17,021
things that uh... that rob walker said was that they've they've crunched the

359
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:18,962
numbers in these don't make enough sequels

360
00:14:18,962 --> 00:14:21,464
that people with triple-a people know this

361
00:14:21,464 --> 00:14:25,606
that if you make a sequel is going to do it's going to do okay in games it's a

362
00:14:25,606 --> 00:14:28,608
licking a movie is the rules that'll do like a lot not necessarily as well but

363
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:31,249
pretty well i can games it seems like sequels is keeping better and better

364
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:31,490
better

365
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,434
right? Like if somebody, if your game comes out, it has like an audience, there's people

366
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:38,318
who are going to find out about it after, but like it's old and they don't want to jump

367
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:42,363
into an old game. You make a second one, now they're like, okay, now is the time to jump

368
00:14:42,363 --> 00:14:46,248
in on that, right? Like now's the time to get a, become a Space Chem fan because Space

369
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:48,511
Chem 2 or whatever. No, we're not making Space Chem 2, don't worry.

370
00:14:49,252 --> 00:14:51,092
Or I'm sorry, either way.

371
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:52,593
But yeah, it helped.

372
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:56,434
And so I think in that regard, I would never want to make a sequel.

373
00:14:56,434 --> 00:14:58,995
It seems like a horrible thing to have to do, right?

374
00:14:58,995 --> 00:15:02,456
But we're effectively making sequels in a way that I love, right?

375
00:15:02,456 --> 00:15:04,297
Which is that we get to do the part that I love doing from scratch,

376
00:15:04,297 --> 00:15:07,178
which is coming up with the world, the mechanics, the puzzles, all the systems.

377
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:09,059
Like, our games thrive on new mechanics,

378
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:11,780
because figuring out the mechanics is the core fun part of it.

379
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,360
But we're kind of making sequels, and I'm okay with it.

380
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,542
And I think that really is part of the... that's what's helping.

381
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:20,763
Now I'm wondering if all your games are in the same universe.

382
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:21,743
They are not.

383
00:15:21,743 --> 00:15:25,064
I've got headcanon for it, but yeah, they're not quite.

384
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:28,985
Well, so SpaceChem exists in the Infinifactor universe.

385
00:15:28,985 --> 00:15:31,206
When you start up SpaceChem, or Infinifactor, there's a little

386
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:33,327
SpaceChem pyramid thing hanging from the rear view

387
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:34,047
mirror of your truck.

388
00:15:34,207 --> 00:15:35,788
So that's like what about that.

389
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:38,329
Yeah, everyone. Yeah. Okay.

390
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:40,610
Yeah. So, um,

391
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,190
one other thing with the way

392
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,491
you've been telling story in your games

393
00:15:44,491 --> 00:15:46,492
and it's so much more

394
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:48,533
narrative. It feels

395
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,254
more cohesive as your

396
00:15:50,254 --> 00:15:52,215
games have gone on. So

397
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:53,735
what's your push

398
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:55,316
of that? Because your games are super

399
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:58,317
systems based, mechanical, and you might

400
00:15:58,317 --> 00:16:00,578
think this doesn't really lend itself

401
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:02,299
well to telling a story,

402
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:03,219
but they do.

403
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:06,040
Yeah, I mean, so this is something, it started with Space Chem even, right?

404
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,902
We wanted to create a world for the game to exist in,

405
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:10,202
that you could go into that world.

406
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,844
And this is something that we've really, like, refined and worked on

407
00:16:12,844 --> 00:16:13,744
over and over and over again.

408
00:16:13,744 --> 00:16:16,225
And like our current writer, Matthew Burns, in the back, raise your hand.

409
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,206
Everybody clap.

410
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:17,506
So he.

411
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:22,120
He is the genius behind all of our story

412
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,200
and our writing stuff and our music and our sound.

413
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,461
And I think that in the past couple of games,

414
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:28,541
like the two of us have really,

415
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,002
so our workflow now is that when we make a puzzle game,

416
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:32,602
like if we made like, you know, like Shenzhen IO, right?

417
00:16:32,602 --> 00:16:35,263
The way we did Shenzhen IO is that,

418
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:38,224
the story in that is that we came up with like the world

419
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:39,364
and the core concept.

420
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:41,205
And then I told Matthew to go come up

421
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:43,285
with a list of puzzle ideas for me.

422
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:44,405
So I didn't have to even do anything.

423
00:16:44,645 --> 00:16:47,386
But no, come up with narrative puzzle ideas.

424
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:50,367
And so in the world of Shenzhen I.O., it's like the near future,

425
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:53,947
like, kind of blown out version of, like, just crazy stuff getting made,

426
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:57,128
you know, like getting engineered and made and shipped and sold as products.

427
00:16:57,128 --> 00:17:00,469
And so, like, come up with, like, 40, like, crazy product ideas

428
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:03,109
that you're able to write about and that are, like, descriptive enough

429
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:04,930
that I can create a puzzle that represents that.

430
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,810
And so, you know, he came back with this list of things,

431
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,210
and then we went through and brainstormed them,

432
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,551
and I checked off the ones that I thought I could make into a puzzle

433
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:13,011
and struck out the ones that seemed too tough to make into a puzzle.

434
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:13,332
And.

435
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:17,354
like we split off but then we come and bring it back together is that we take

436
00:17:17,354 --> 00:17:21,578
a puzzle and like a story thread and then weave them together and then like

437
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:23,819
try to build little things that connect them together

438
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,823
and then like add in things like the solitaire, you know I wanted to make a solitaire game for Shinjin Ayao

439
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:33,147
and so we like work that into the story and like just kind of just stick everything into the story and so it's not

440
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:37,710
like a lot of games like kind of pretend they're movies when they do story stuff and they think about it as this linear thing

441
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,473
we try to build like this world and then just like plug everything into it.

442
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:43,874
And you plug the player into it too.

443
00:17:43,874 --> 00:17:45,675
We were just talking before this talk.

444
00:17:45,675 --> 00:17:50,818
And it's like, I was talking about how I like desk games,

445
00:17:50,818 --> 00:17:54,720
where it simulates you, the actual you, just sitting there,

446
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,281
you know, just like, I'm at an office.

447
00:17:57,281 --> 00:18:00,542
And then the more that we talked about it,

448
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:00,983
it was kind of like-

449
00:18:00,983 --> 00:18:01,703
It's like shitty VR.

450
00:18:01,703 --> 00:18:03,444
You're actually at a desk.

451
00:18:05,305 --> 00:18:07,147
Yeah, wow, it's so real, tactile.

452
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:07,347
Yeah.

453
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:07,827
Yeah.

454
00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:13,132
Yeah, and even with Shenzhen, there's the, how'd you come up,

455
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:14,614
like, the manual.

456
00:18:14,614 --> 00:18:16,576
It's like an employee manual.

457
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:18,277
Yeah, it's a 40-page binder.

458
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:19,619
Well, OK, so yeah, yeah.

459
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:21,220
It's a 40-page binder filled with,

460
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,122
like there is no tutorial in Shenzhen I O.

461
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:24,844
It comes with a binder.

462
00:18:24,844 --> 00:18:28,407
So it has, like, and there's not even a tutorial in the binder.

463
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,388
There's like.

464
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,571
application notes there there's lots of things that are real electronics thing

465
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:35,194
like application notes which are kind of like tutorials on how to do something

466
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:37,777
there's data sheets which give you technical information about your parts

467
00:18:37,777 --> 00:18:41,360
uh... we've got like spec sheets which are per puzzle things that tell you like

468
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,761
in front

469
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:44,283
you know like the client comes to you and says here's the information we want you to build

470
00:18:44,283 --> 00:18:47,627
this thing and so it's stuff like that and so we compiled it all into this binder

471
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:51,450
but then like we had an actual writer write it and so like we it's it's this

472
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,013
huge vehicle for us to tell story and create a sense of place

473
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:57,476
And it's an iteration, the way it came to it,

474
00:18:57,476 --> 00:18:58,818
it's an iteration on TIS-100,

475
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:00,699
which came with a paper manual instead of a tutorial.

476
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:02,581
And that was surely out of laziness,

477
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:04,363
which is that I didn't want to make a tutorial

478
00:19:04,363 --> 00:19:06,525
that tries to teach people how to do fake programming.

479
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:08,227
So we're just like, we'll document it.

480
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:09,608
People can figure it out.

481
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:11,049
And it's fun.

482
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,290
I mean, that was around the same time that completely

483
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,692
independently, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, or

484
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:18,393
whatever, they came out with their manual.

485
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:20,274
And it's like, yeah, people like flipping through stuff.

486
00:19:20,274 --> 00:19:22,695
There's definitely a trend now for physical stuff.

487
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,877
We're all used to everything's on phones, and you can't

488
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:25,417
really touch it.

489
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:27,498
So people love, hipsters love physical shit.

490
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,501
Yeah, I have to go to Kinko's, print out the binder for the...

491
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:33,324
We did a deluxe edition where we actually made a binder.

492
00:19:33,324 --> 00:19:36,427
We got binders printed and we had everything printed,

493
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:37,628
so it's like a deluxe binder.

494
00:19:37,628 --> 00:19:38,829
We did like a thousand of them.

495
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:41,932
We mailed them out by hand ourselves in one day.

496
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,034
It was insane.

497
00:19:43,034 --> 00:19:46,117
But if you go to the IGF pavilion, Shinji and I are always there,

498
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:47,718
and we actually have one of the original binders,

499
00:19:47,718 --> 00:19:48,840
please don't steal it.

500
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,381
We have one of the original binders out,

501
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:54,283
and so you can see the gold standard

502
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:56,044
of what this was supposed to be.

503
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:58,066
If I had my way, I would get a binder out to everybody,

504
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:59,026
but not everybody wants it,

505
00:19:59,026 --> 00:20:00,347
and that's really hard, it turns out.

506
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:05,110
So, we got like five minutes before

507
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,231
we're gonna open up for Q and A,

508
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:10,574
so if you wanna keep anything in mind.

509
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:17,316
We did talk on, or you had talked on the Gamasutra Twitch stream

510
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:23,118
about intrinsic rewards and design and the thing with your game says that you

511
00:20:23,118 --> 00:20:26,439
it's so satisfying without, you know...

512
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:28,827
feeling like gross.

513
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,589
There's no like gotcha mechanics or anything like that.

514
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:34,670
We were joking that like, Zach Barth, why do you hate

515
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,872
progression mechanics?

516
00:20:36,872 --> 00:20:37,492
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

517
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:41,334
Rumor has it that you're anti all progression mechanics.

518
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:46,197
So can you talk a little about being rewarded as a player

519
00:20:46,197 --> 00:20:49,358
and enabling a player to feel that?

520
00:20:49,358 --> 00:20:51,800
So the reason I know I never would have made Minecraft is

521
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,741
that I would never make a game about punching trees.

522
00:20:54,665 --> 00:21:01,327
right and I I'm not a fan of like the RPG based progression mechanics and like

523
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:04,929
that kind of stage that feels fake right like I don't I drive me crazy and so at

524
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:07,850
least when it comes to design my own games.

525
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,592
They're really skill based right there really about actual skills, you know

526
00:21:11,592 --> 00:21:14,093
they're not real world skills like I don't really care for teaching some of

527
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:17,634
the really program but like when you're playing our game the work you do that to

528
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:20,476
solve the game or whatever the when you're playing the game you're going to

529
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:21,456
be doing a real skill.

530
00:21:21,736 --> 00:21:24,037
It might not be a real, real skill that exists outside,

531
00:21:24,037 --> 00:21:25,657
but within the game, it's going to be a real skill.

532
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:27,197
Like, we're not just going to pat you on the back and make

533
00:21:27,197 --> 00:21:27,957
it on your resume.

534
00:21:27,957 --> 00:21:28,638
Yeah, exactly.

535
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:29,978
Yeah, like we're not just going to pat you on the back

536
00:21:29,978 --> 00:21:30,938
and make your numbers bigger.

537
00:21:30,938 --> 00:21:32,358
So you're actually doing the same thing the whole time,

538
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,879
but it feels like you're going like this.

539
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:37,060
We're going to actually force you to go like this.

540
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,440
And like, I can't imagine designing games

541
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,380
that aren't like that, and I think that's

542
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,040
a limitation of me personally.

543
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,781
Like, if we could do that, I would be much more rich, right?

544
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:45,822
Like, that's where the money is, is games that make people

545
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:47,482
feel like they're awesome, you know?

546
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:49,622
But it's like, I just demand it, that you just

547
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:50,663
have to be awesome.

548
00:21:50,663 --> 00:21:50,943
Sorry.

549
00:21:52,903 --> 00:21:55,464
I think there's like an authenticity in it and obviously like that's the

550
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:58,525
strength of our games and that's why we sell them right is that like some people

551
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,746
it's like the Dark Souls thing right regardless of whether Dark Souls is

552
00:22:00,746 --> 00:22:03,527
actually like something that's just patting you on the back and pretending

553
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:06,728
that you're great or it actually requires you to be great like that's that

554
00:22:06,728 --> 00:22:10,269
people so there there there is a there are enough people that feel that that's

555
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:12,590
a thing they want that we can keep doing what we're doing for now

556
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:18,478
Yeah, and talking about the people who you make games for,

557
00:22:18,478 --> 00:22:20,942
obviously you have some kind of magical formula

558
00:22:20,942 --> 00:22:23,786
where you can just really appeal to one specific niche audience

559
00:22:23,786 --> 00:22:25,288
who will buy your games over and over again, right?

560
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:26,290
You're a marketing genius.

561
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:26,570
Yes.

562
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:31,605
I stumbled into something.

563
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:35,210
So how much of your design and the games that you make

564
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,513
are driven by what you know your fans like?

565
00:22:38,513 --> 00:22:38,954
None of it.

566
00:22:38,954 --> 00:22:41,397
I don't make games to please people.

567
00:22:41,397 --> 00:22:42,298
I think that's the flag.

568
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:45,281
I'm not doing this for you guys, sorry.

569
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,383
I'm doing it for myself.

570
00:22:46,743 --> 00:22:48,845
And so obviously that's a lie, right?

571
00:22:48,845 --> 00:22:50,446
Like I'm a designer and you have to think about

572
00:22:50,446 --> 00:22:51,647
who you're designing for.

573
00:22:51,647 --> 00:22:54,649
But also the thing that really motivates me

574
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:56,311
is not the desire to please people.

575
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:58,092
The thing that really deep down,

576
00:22:58,092 --> 00:23:01,635
like the little speck of dirt at the heart of the pearl

577
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:03,897
is that I just have to get this stuff out there.

578
00:23:03,897 --> 00:23:07,840
I can see it and it has to become real.

579
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,501
And that's really it.

580
00:23:09,742 --> 00:23:11,526
You just have to bring it to fruition.

581
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:12,127
Exactly.

582
00:23:12,127 --> 00:23:14,353
You guys are just along for the ride.

583
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:15,516
So yeah.

584
00:23:15,516 --> 00:23:16,578
Y'all been played.

585
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:21,134
So, do you think that we should do some questions?

586
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:22,334
Yeah, we can do questions.

587
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,815
I've been told that we can run over slightly,

588
00:23:23,815 --> 00:23:25,436
so that was a mistake to take advantage of.

589
00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:27,717
But we have rules, we have ground rules.

590
00:23:27,717 --> 00:23:29,118
Oh God, okay, I'll be the mean guy.

591
00:23:29,118 --> 00:23:30,979
Okay, so you can ask questions,

592
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:32,600
but it has to be a question,

593
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,942
and you really can't take more than five seconds

594
00:23:34,942 --> 00:23:35,722
to ask the question.

595
00:23:35,722 --> 00:23:37,423
So, get straight to the point,

596
00:23:37,423 --> 00:23:40,925
we're gonna ask the question and we'll get you an answer,

597
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:42,466
and then we can do lots of Q&A.

598
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:43,166
So, if that's okay.

599
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:51,932
Can you please talk about the process for how you go from these effectively programming things to making them actually fun?

600
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:54,794
Because nobody makes a game about coding in C.

601
00:23:54,794 --> 00:23:57,196
Yeah, okay. So question, how do we make programming fun?

602
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:59,517
The answer is that we don't.

603
00:23:59,517 --> 00:24:02,699
We don't make something that's... well, that sounds bad.

604
00:24:02,699 --> 00:24:04,881
So it's debatable whether they're fun.

605
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:06,982
Oh, that's the microphone. That's right. I don't have to lean in.

606
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:07,062
So...

607
00:24:08,223 --> 00:24:11,386
There's a reason we haven't made a game about programming in C, right?

608
00:24:11,386 --> 00:24:12,287
It's not fun.

609
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:17,393
And so we design tool sets that strip away all the stuff that actually sucks about real life.

610
00:24:17,393 --> 00:24:22,018
Our version of electronics is like monopole, like weird electronics, you know?

611
00:24:22,018 --> 00:24:23,740
Like, it makes it easier, it makes it more fun.

612
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,201
Like, we strip away the bad stuff.

613
00:24:27,228 --> 00:24:31,510
So you mentioned that the design of the world came before the design of the puzzles, at

614
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,330
least in Shenzhen.

615
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,230
Yes.

616
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,792
When talking about specific mechanics, how does that play into the process?

617
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:41,313
Is that, do you think of the mechanics as part of the world, or is it more at the time

618
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,013
of creating the puzzles?

619
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,249
Question, where do the mechanics come from?

620
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:47,170
Answer, the mechanics are probably the first thing, right?

621
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,151
So when I say the world comes first, I'm also lying.

622
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:51,512
The first thing that comes, like, is that,

623
00:24:51,512 --> 00:24:54,853
in my head I have to think of a mechanic that I'm like,

624
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:56,733
man, I really wanna see a game with that mechanic.

625
00:24:57,373 --> 00:25:00,795
and that that's where it comes from so with with change and I it was like

626
00:25:00,795 --> 00:25:04,436
man what if T I S like what if the T I S nodes like in T S 100 were actually

627
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:08,398
things you can move around like that's the kernel of the idea I don't know what

628
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:10,559
the language is going to look like I don't because the language is like a

629
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,060
reflection of the rest of the game we have to build a language that allows you

630
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,781
to build the things that like we want to build from a story standpoint so that

631
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:19,082
comes later but like there's that core idea and that's a mechanical thing like

632
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:22,363
I I'm I'm the creative director or whatever like I'm a mechanics focus

633
00:25:22,363 --> 00:25:26,765
person it's probably obvious so that's what comes first like truly first you

634
00:25:28,477 --> 00:25:29,438
What's next?

635
00:25:29,438 --> 00:25:29,838
Stuff.

636
00:25:29,838 --> 00:25:35,420
So when you're designing puzzles for your games,

637
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,381
and I've been particularly in mind Opus Magnum,

638
00:25:38,381 --> 00:25:41,462
to what extent, because there's a huge breadth that you can

639
00:25:41,462 --> 00:25:44,223
optimize in different ways for, when you are building

640
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:46,744
those puzzles and designing them as the creator,

641
00:25:46,744 --> 00:25:51,466
to what extent, like how much, how optimized are you going

642
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,367
in the process of figuring out what that puzzle is

643
00:25:54,367 --> 00:25:55,307
when building it?

644
00:25:55,307 --> 00:25:57,528
So do we optimize our puzzles in advance?

645
00:25:57,719 --> 00:26:04,185
Or I mean, like, when you build the puzzle, are you figuring out what are the maximally optimal ways and different...

646
00:26:04,185 --> 00:26:07,629
You just, I mean, that's the beauty of... So the way we make our puzzles, I've talked about this before,

647
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:11,913
I just come up with something that looks solvable and interesting, and then we ship it, you know?

648
00:26:11,913 --> 00:26:17,979
And so, like, it's... I am not the best player, I'm not optimizing it, like, does it look interesting? Cool.

649
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:21,388
Secrets revealed.

650
00:26:21,388 --> 00:26:24,191
Do you ever play any of the user generated levels

651
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:25,092
in Steam Workshop?

652
00:26:25,092 --> 00:26:25,372
Oh, no.

653
00:26:25,372 --> 00:26:25,993
No.

654
00:26:25,993 --> 00:26:27,074
I'm not a fan.

655
00:26:27,074 --> 00:26:31,179
There's this guy called Notch that made a level for Shenzen.io.

656
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:33,361
So I'm torn because I love our players, obviously,

657
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:35,303
because they're playing our crazy shit.

658
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:36,665
So that's cool.

659
00:26:36,665 --> 00:26:39,028
There's definitely a demand for more puzzles.

660
00:26:39,268 --> 00:26:42,569
I'm really, I have a really specific thing I'm trying to do with our puzzles

661
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:44,650
and oftentimes, like, our players are not going for that.

662
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,490
Like, a lot of the Shinjin-Ai puzzles are like,

663
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,791
build this algorithm or do this programming thing.

664
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:51,992
I'm really, like, I guess that's what the game looks like I'm doing,

665
00:26:51,992 --> 00:26:53,672
is making these things about algorithms, but it's like,

666
00:26:53,672 --> 00:26:56,413
I really want to make a puzzle about building, like, a sandwich-making machine

667
00:26:56,413 --> 00:26:59,574
that's like, plays a little patriotic song and puts up a little flag.

668
00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:01,375
Like, that's what I'm excited about.

669
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:05,216
And so, it's hard for that to show up in user-created puzzles.

670
00:27:05,216 --> 00:27:07,697
So, it's not a good answer. I'm sorry, guys.

671
00:27:10,016 --> 00:27:15,860
So I saw your Google talk and I was curious if you've given any more thought to taking

672
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:21,024
kind of like a useful subset of reality and trying to gamify it.

673
00:27:21,024 --> 00:27:21,104
No.

674
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:22,345
And kind of like teach.

675
00:27:22,345 --> 00:27:22,485
No, no.

676
00:27:22,485 --> 00:27:24,766
There's plenty of other people trying to do that.

677
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:25,067
Gotcha.

678
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:26,448
So you're just punting on the idea.

679
00:27:27,007 --> 00:27:30,310
not really punting on it. I think that what we do is beautiful in its own right.

680
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:36,093
Like, if you learn something that has no bearing on reality, you're really just doing it for purely intrinsic reasons.

681
00:27:36,093 --> 00:27:40,677
Like, there's something in that. It's like, uh, it's, it's, yeah, it's beautiful.

682
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:44,919
It's also probably more profitable, so.

683
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:50,086
How do you tune difficulty, and in particular, how do you know when something's too easy?

684
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:52,888
Okay, question. How do we tune difficulty? Answer poorly.

685
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:56,369
It's... Oh, God.

686
00:27:56,369 --> 00:28:01,091
We collect stats. We collect metrics about how people are actually playing through our games.

687
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:03,912
So that gives us a question of, like, do we really screw this up?

688
00:28:03,912 --> 00:28:06,493
Is there a level that everybody's getting stuck on that we don't want them to get stuck on?

689
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:08,714
So we have feedback in the form of that.

690
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:12,796
In general, like, Opus Magnum wasn't meant to be an easy game, it just was.

691
00:28:12,796 --> 00:28:15,977
When we came up with the mechanics and started coming up with the puzzles,

692
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:17,757
it just was as difficult as it is.

693
00:28:17,757 --> 00:28:20,678
I actually was worried that people weren't gonna like the game because it was too easy,

694
00:28:20,678 --> 00:28:22,359
but I wasn't about to make it harder, because I didn't, like,

695
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:24,479
that's not how it works, right? You just,

696
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:27,720
you come up with, like, a system and you just get whatever you get out of it.

697
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,901
So, it turned out that went okay, so.

698
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,951
Yeah, you briefly touched on this in terms of your

699
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:36,872
Sektronics genre kind of being a little bit niche,

700
00:28:36,872 --> 00:28:38,832
but what do you think about marketing?

701
00:28:38,832 --> 00:28:41,353
Do you market your games at all, or think about marketing?

702
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:42,353
Question, do we market?

703
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,654
Answer, no.

704
00:28:44,654 --> 00:28:46,455
We're, we don't, we don't.

705
00:28:46,455 --> 00:28:48,355
Like, they market themselves,

706
00:28:48,355 --> 00:28:49,335
I don't know how you would market.

707
00:28:49,335 --> 00:28:50,736
I don't know if I believe in marketing.

708
00:28:50,736 --> 00:28:52,276
Well, like, I mean.

709
00:28:53,537 --> 00:28:56,679
It doesn't matter if you believe in it or not, it exists.

710
00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:58,461
I guess.

711
00:28:58,461 --> 00:29:01,703
But like the Opus Magnum...

712
00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:01,943
GIFs.

713
00:29:01,943 --> 00:29:02,564
Yeah, the GIFs.

714
00:29:02,564 --> 00:29:08,349
Opus Magnum, like every time you beat a puzzle, there's a button you can push and it like poops out a GIF on your desktop of like your solution.

715
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:11,011
And then people are like, it looks beautiful. People put them on Twitter.

716
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:14,173
Like that was a marketing decision, I guess, but it's also a game design decision.

717
00:29:14,173 --> 00:29:16,535
Like no marketing person could tell you to do that.

718
00:29:16,915 --> 00:29:22,177
Right. Like I don't I don't think it is marketing. I just think about it is like making a game that's like

719
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:28,159
like games are meant to be played by human beings like you design for the person designed for all

720
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,241
aspects of the person. Yeah. That's marketing genius. Yeah.

721
00:29:32,241 --> 00:29:36,382
He doesn't even know it. We are we keep going for like a couple more minutes.

722
00:29:36,382 --> 00:29:36,842
Okay. Now.

723
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:40,884
As an aspiring game dev that's also doing well in

724
00:29:40,884 --> 00:29:45,205
what like tech development. How did you find the time and energy to work on

725
00:29:45,205 --> 00:29:46,606
your own game before you?

726
00:29:46,763 --> 00:29:49,565
Oh yeah, okay, so we did SpaceChem when we were at Microsoft.

727
00:29:49,565 --> 00:29:51,706
So Microsoft is nice in that they have a good moonlighting policy,

728
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,948
that as long as you're not touching your stuff, you can do whatever.

729
00:29:53,948 --> 00:29:54,988
I don't know if it's still that way.

730
00:29:54,988 --> 00:29:56,989
Also, I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know.

731
00:29:56,989 --> 00:29:59,171
But at the time, it was legit.

732
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:02,093
And we, you know, I would go to work.

733
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:04,614
I was on Office, which is like the opposite of exciting.

734
00:30:04,614 --> 00:30:06,796
But like one of the nice things about it is that there wasn't any crunch.

735
00:30:06,796 --> 00:30:09,978
And so I would go to work from, you know, 10 to 4, and then I would,

736
00:30:09,978 --> 00:30:11,599
I would, just kidding.

737
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:15,864
I would go home and then I would frantically work on SpaceChem.

738
00:30:15,864 --> 00:30:18,287
And then like on the weekends, we would all get together at my house,

739
00:30:18,287 --> 00:30:20,530
which my wife's chagrin, and we would all work on SpaceChem.

740
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:23,494
And we did that for a year and then SpaceChem was a thing.

741
00:30:23,494 --> 00:30:25,216
So like, you just do it if you want.

742
00:30:25,216 --> 00:30:26,378
Honestly, I think it's the best way.

743
00:30:26,378 --> 00:30:27,038
A lot of people.

744
00:30:27,098 --> 00:30:27,899
It's not a lot of people.

745
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:29,200
Some people are like, I'm going to quit my job

746
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,080
and make indie games.

747
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,021
It's like, that is a bad idea.

748
00:30:31,021 --> 00:30:33,963
You're probably not going to succeed on your first one.

749
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:35,463
We did it while staying at jobs.

750
00:30:35,463 --> 00:30:36,164
It was amazing.

751
00:30:36,164 --> 00:30:37,425
Nobody risked anything.

752
00:30:37,425 --> 00:30:38,465
We had fun.

753
00:30:38,465 --> 00:30:41,687
We didn't feel like pressure to perform or make money

754
00:30:41,687 --> 00:30:42,127
or anything.

755
00:30:42,127 --> 00:30:44,749
We just made this thing because we wanted to.

756
00:30:44,749 --> 00:30:45,709
So that was 10 years ago.

757
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:48,651
Things are different.

758
00:30:48,651 --> 00:30:50,973
So you want to make games about real skills, but not

759
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:51,933
real, real skills.

760
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,115
How do you balance the level of abstraction of actual

761
00:30:55,115 --> 00:30:56,176
engineering problems?

762
00:30:56,176 --> 00:30:56,356
Oh.

763
00:30:57,699 --> 00:30:59,260
How do we balance the level of it?

764
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,521
I mean, I don't think we come at it that way.

765
00:31:01,521 --> 00:31:02,782
Like, I don't try to take a real system

766
00:31:02,782 --> 00:31:04,283
and then like tune it until it becomes

767
00:31:04,283 --> 00:31:05,304
something that's playable.

768
00:31:05,304 --> 00:31:07,945
It's, I just sort of imagine it as like,

769
00:31:07,945 --> 00:31:09,286
I've described it before, is that like,

770
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:10,947
I'll read about something, but then I'll get lazy

771
00:31:10,947 --> 00:31:12,188
and not understand all of it.

772
00:31:12,188 --> 00:31:13,728
And so like, but that makes me think of like

773
00:31:13,728 --> 00:31:14,829
what my version of it is.

774
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:16,110
And then I just make that happen.

775
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,497
So, it's a very creative process.

776
00:31:19,497 --> 00:31:21,199
And that's why I think it would be impossible,

777
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:23,201
like, I mean, we tried making educational games that suck,

778
00:31:23,201 --> 00:31:24,222
because you can't do that.

779
00:31:24,222 --> 00:31:26,665
Like, you're trying to actually port something real over,

780
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:28,807
as opposed to just having this, like,

781
00:31:28,807 --> 00:31:30,048
fantasy version of electronics.

782
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:34,313
Hey, could we get a Sigmar's Garden standalone game?

783
00:31:34,313 --> 00:31:35,755
Maybe on mobile?

784
00:31:35,755 --> 00:31:35,835
Wow.

785
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:38,364
Probably not, I don't know.

786
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:41,825
So we did Shenzhen Solitaire on iOS.

787
00:31:41,825 --> 00:31:44,767
Spoiler alert, did not sell many copies.

788
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:47,168
We did on Steam, did not sell many copies.

789
00:31:47,168 --> 00:31:49,108
You probably already own Sigmar's Garden

790
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:50,609
in the form of Opus Magnum.

791
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:54,091
So that's the thing, right?

792
00:31:54,091 --> 00:31:54,831
So probably not.

793
00:31:56,588 --> 00:31:56,989
All right.

794
00:31:56,989 --> 00:31:58,429
That's single tier.

795
00:31:58,429 --> 00:31:58,749
All right.

796
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:02,271
Not everything we do makes money, unfortunately.

797
00:32:02,271 --> 00:32:03,051
I think that's it.

798
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:05,052
Did you have a nice time?

799
00:32:05,052 --> 00:32:05,252
Yeah.

800
00:32:05,252 --> 00:32:06,213
This was fun.

801
00:32:06,213 --> 00:32:06,753
This was fun.

802
00:32:06,753 --> 00:32:08,714
Let's do this again next year.

803
00:32:08,714 --> 00:32:09,094
Yeah.

804
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:09,854
Oh, yeah.

805
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:10,055
Yeah.

806
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:10,855
I think.

807
00:32:10,855 --> 00:32:14,196
So I have some Opus Magnum iron-on patches.

808
00:32:14,196 --> 00:32:17,558
So if you've beaten the main campaign of Opus Magnum, you don't have to beat the final

809
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:21,119
chapter with the production puzzles, but if you've seen the credits and beaten the game,

810
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,020
you can come up and get one of these for free.

811
00:32:23,934 --> 00:32:24,836
after this talk.

812
00:32:24,836 --> 00:32:25,818
I have a lot of these.

813
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,262
I ordered way too many.

814
00:32:27,262 --> 00:32:30,449
So not that many people beat this game, it turns out.

815
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,251
So yeah.

816
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:32,013
Thanks, everybody.

817
00:32:32,013 --> 00:32:32,655
Yeah, thank you.
