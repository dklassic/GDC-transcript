1
00:00:03,747 --> 00:00:04,047
Whatever.

2
00:00:05,308 --> 00:00:06,349
I'll just do it the manual way.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:07,149
So hello.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,011
I'm Yuri Horniman.

5
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:11,312
Everyone has slides with their names on it,

6
00:00:11,332 --> 00:00:12,193
but I have this.

7
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,934
So I've been making games since 1991,

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,556
and I've worn a lot of hats in that time.

9
00:00:17,596 --> 00:00:19,998
And today I'm here wearing my game designer hat.

10
00:00:20,558 --> 00:00:23,200
And so now I'd like to know a little bit more about you.

11
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,902
Who here thinks of themselves primarily as a writer?

12
00:00:25,922 --> 00:00:30,185
OK, that's not as many as I expected.

13
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:32,226
Wrote the whole thing for you writers.

14
00:00:33,494 --> 00:00:34,174
Narrative designer?

15
00:00:34,194 --> 00:00:37,175
Okay, that's a bunch, yeah, okay.

16
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:37,716
Game designer?

17
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:40,917
Okay, all right.

18
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:44,799
Who here thinks storytelling in games would be better

19
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,401
if writers were consulted more often and especially earlier?

20
00:00:49,097 --> 00:00:49,917
OK, that's enough people.

21
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:50,598
Great, great, great.

22
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:54,420
Because the whole talk collapses if people say, whatever.

23
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:55,821
So OK.

24
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:57,883
So that's a very pernicious problem, very complicated,

25
00:00:57,903 --> 00:00:58,483
very systemic.

26
00:00:59,124 --> 00:01:02,246
And I am not going to offer you the solution.

27
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:04,627
I'm not going to say, this is a silver bullet, those don't exist.

28
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:08,230
But hopefully, I can cast a new light on this problem

29
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,351
by showing you a design approach that I found extremely

30
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:13,353
useful in game design, and that sort of is

31
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:14,134
relevant to that problem.

32
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,897
So I'm going to start with some quick definitions, some examples, then I'll talk about the design

33
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:22,419
approach, and then I'm going to talk about what that means for storytelling in games.

34
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:30,044
So first, I'd like to ask you to suspend your disbelief for the duration of this talk and

35
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:34,107
to accept two simple, non-academic definitions of terms that I'm going to be using during

36
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:37,449
this talk, just for the sake of argument, because terminology in storytelling in games

37
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:40,110
I found to be a very complicated issue.

38
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:40,851
So...

39
00:01:42,142 --> 00:01:43,863
When I talk about story, I talk about this.

40
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,525
I talk about something that was pre-offered,

41
00:01:45,885 --> 00:01:47,366
and it's about something happening to someone.

42
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:49,347
Because people get confused by what

43
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:51,329
is meant by story in games, including me.

44
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,170
And so I mean pre-offered story.

45
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,591
I don't mean an emergent story.

46
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:56,852
I don't mean the story that you're

47
00:01:56,872 --> 00:01:58,453
telling me about the game you played last night.

48
00:01:58,513 --> 00:02:00,615
I don't mean the story as it's happening while you're playing.

49
00:02:01,015 --> 00:02:02,096
I don't mean back story.

50
00:02:02,176 --> 00:02:03,137
I mean this.

51
00:02:04,077 --> 00:02:08,220
And so fictional, I'm going to talk about this a lot.

52
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,201
This is an important concept for this talk.

53
00:02:11,142 --> 00:02:12,703
This is about willing suspension of disbelief,

54
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:15,225
so fictional means related to things I'm asking you

55
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:16,226
to pretend are true, right?

56
00:02:16,246 --> 00:02:19,188
So I am, as designers, as game creators,

57
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:22,030
we are asking people to believe that this bunch of pixels

58
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,632
is a plumber and that's a barrel and that's a monkey, right?

59
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:27,254
And that's kind of a core.

60
00:02:29,235 --> 00:02:32,377
Okay, so an example.

61
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:35,980
Let's say you have a game where you have hit points, right?

62
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,242
So we've been using hit points as a mechanic for decades.

63
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,571
Works very well.

64
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:44,833
It means that if the player hits an enemy,

65
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,014
she's not killed instantly.

66
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:47,415
You can sort of take that away a little bit.

67
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:48,456
So hit points.

68
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:48,696
OK.

69
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:50,758
So you need to show the player how many hit points

70
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:51,578
she has left, right?

71
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,240
Because otherwise, you don't get the right dynamic going.

72
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:55,121
Very common design problem.

73
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:55,822
So how do you do that?

74
00:02:56,483 --> 00:02:59,926
Well, the easy solution is what Doom does

75
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:01,587
and what billions of games have done,

76
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:03,529
is just put the number on the screen, right?

77
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:05,550
There it is, very clear.

78
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:07,032
People know what's going on.

79
00:03:07,832 --> 00:03:08,513
Works great.

80
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,926
Now let's say that you say you want to really immerse

81
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:13,726
the player in the world.

82
00:03:13,786 --> 00:03:15,767
You don't want any gamey numbers on the screen

83
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:18,068
because you think that breaks suspension of disbelief, right?

84
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:19,528
So what do you do?

85
00:03:19,628 --> 00:03:22,109
Well, if you're Valve and Half-Life,

86
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,190
working in Half-Life,

87
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,431
you find an explanation in your game setting, right?

88
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:29,212
You say, well, you know, this is slightly sort of sci-fi game

89
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:32,214
so what if the player character puts on this sort of

90
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:34,615
high-tech exosuit that has an actual heads-up display

91
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:36,155
and then we can show all the different numbers

92
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,616
that are important for gameplay right there?

93
00:03:38,436 --> 00:03:43,098
Even though, you know, why an industrial exosuit would show the amount of bullets you have left in your gun,

94
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:45,919
you know, like, doesn't really make sense. But, you know, it's good enough, right?

95
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,081
So, beautiful solution, makes total sense, or, well, almost total sense, in the world of the game.

96
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:54,662
But now, let's say you love this idea of not having numbers on screen,

97
00:03:54,822 --> 00:04:01,664
but your game has a fantasy setting and, you know, you don't want to try and come up with a fantasy exosuit, right?

98
00:04:01,704 --> 00:04:02,585
So what do you do?

99
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:07,447
Well, if you're Team Ico, you take out hit points all together, right?

100
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:09,926
You think about, well, why do we even need hit points?

101
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:12,529
What are the dynamics we're trying to generate?

102
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,333
Why do we need, why do we want the player to know about them?

103
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:19,197
And so instead, you make all the situations in the game

104
00:04:19,277 --> 00:04:21,039
very clearly deadly or not, right?

105
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:23,742
In ICO, I find it sort of cool, it's like,

106
00:04:24,623 --> 00:04:27,085
if it looks like a kid would die falling from that height,

107
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,140
he'll probably die, right?

108
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:30,981
It's very obvious, right?

109
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:31,781
You don't need to think about it.

110
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:32,642
There's nothing to explain.

111
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:33,182
It's very clear.

112
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:35,103
And then, you know, the enemies, they

113
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:37,384
don't actually harm the player character.

114
00:04:37,404 --> 00:04:39,985
They just slow him down while his companion, Princess Yorda,

115
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:41,945
is being dragged off into the void.

116
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:43,326
And then the game ends, right?

117
00:04:43,626 --> 00:04:46,747
So they have this kind of delay mechanic in there.

118
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:49,589
And they have kind of the same dynamic and effects

119
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:50,449
as for midpoints.

120
00:04:51,503 --> 00:04:53,384
in a different way and without requiring

121
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:54,465
any numbers on screen.

122
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:55,906
And I think it's great.

123
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:56,947
It's also a lot of work,

124
00:04:56,987 --> 00:04:58,248
because they have to reinvent all this stuff.

125
00:04:58,268 --> 00:04:59,850
You know, it's like, oh, let's get the off-the-shelf

126
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,710
hit point module.

127
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,152
And it affects the whole game.

128
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:04,754
There are certain things they cannot easily

129
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:07,156
put in their game by using this.

130
00:05:07,196 --> 00:05:08,457
But, you know, it's a wonderful solution.

131
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:12,020
So what do we just see here?

132
00:05:16,343 --> 00:05:18,325
We were looking at sort of two sides of the game,

133
00:05:18,725 --> 00:05:21,027
the mechanical side, which is the rule side,

134
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:23,189
and then the fictional side, right?

135
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:25,391
And I find it an incredibly useful way

136
00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:26,572
of looking at game design,

137
00:05:26,612 --> 00:05:29,995
and I've been using this approach a lot.

138
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:32,197
since quite a long time.

139
00:05:32,517 --> 00:05:33,798
I know other game designers have too,

140
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:35,019
it's not something particularly new,

141
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:37,181
but you know, and they may not use these exact words.

142
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,742
But it's very, very useful.

143
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:40,523
And you look at your games from these two sides,

144
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:42,125
you try to make things come together

145
00:05:42,145 --> 00:05:43,746
into one sort of pleasing experience,

146
00:05:44,587 --> 00:05:45,888
the experience that you want to achieve.

147
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:48,189
Because if you don't balance those two sides,

148
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,011
you get dissonance, or you can get dissonance,

149
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:52,112
which you usually don't want,

150
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:55,255
and you risk breaking the player suspension of this way.

151
00:05:57,967 --> 00:06:01,089
The mechanical side of a game is really abstract, right?

152
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,971
It's the fiction that gives the game meaning.

153
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,872
And of course, the mechanical side

154
00:06:05,892 --> 00:06:07,173
has a big effect on the experience,

155
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:08,694
because otherwise, why do it?

156
00:06:08,754 --> 00:06:10,575
And also, they're games.

157
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:13,917
But if I just say, when this counter hits zero,

158
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,098
the game ends, that can sort of mean anything.

159
00:06:16,138 --> 00:06:18,240
That is very cold, very abstract, right?

160
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,542
And so the fictional side is what we're asking,

161
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:25,064
like I said earlier, what we're asking players to believe when

162
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,345
we talk about suspension of disbelief.

163
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,862
And every design element can be seen from the mechanical and from the fictional side.

164
00:06:31,422 --> 00:06:35,184
And it's important to realize that these are two sides of the same thing, right?

165
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:36,345
They're not separate.

166
00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:39,807
They're aspects or dimensions or perspectives on one thing.

167
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:42,428
Right.

168
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:48,811
So to balance the fictional and the mechanical often involves explaining a mechanical element

169
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:50,632
and justifying it within the game setting.

170
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,251
And the sort of fancy word for this is diegesis,

171
00:06:54,871 --> 00:06:56,672
which is a word that, the way I use it,

172
00:06:56,752 --> 00:06:57,892
comes from sound design.

173
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:01,134
You know, if you watch a movie and you see a radio

174
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,594
and the radio's playing music,

175
00:07:02,795 --> 00:07:04,655
and the characters in the movie can't hear that music,

176
00:07:04,855 --> 00:07:06,036
that is called diegetic music.

177
00:07:06,716 --> 00:07:07,617
And if you have like, you know,

178
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:10,418
like the typical Hollywood score that you can hear,

179
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,119
but the characters cannot unless they break the fourth wall,

180
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:15,520
that is called non-diegetic music, right?

181
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,321
And it's a very simple concept that's used in sound design,

182
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:20,682
but I also find it very useful for game design.

183
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:24,506
And what you do when you explain the mechanical,

184
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:28,607
when you make things diegetic, is really world building.

185
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:30,927
You're inventing how the world works.

186
00:07:31,588 --> 00:07:33,488
You're inventing which creatures and characters

187
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:35,388
exist in the game, why they behave a certain way,

188
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:36,348
why they act a certain way.

189
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:40,669
So I wanna just show two more examples.

190
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,010
Actually three, just to show a couple of things

191
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,431
that you can make diegetic, that you can sort of explain

192
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:51,031
and justify inside your setting.

193
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:57,711
So character death is a convention of video games

194
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:59,773
and has been around for decades, right?

195
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:01,594
Your guy dies and you have to start all over again.

196
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:06,037
But actually it is harmful to suspension of disbelief.

197
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:08,559
And so various games over time have tried to sort of explain

198
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:09,239
it and integrate it.

199
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,941
And one solution that I find really cool

200
00:08:12,122 --> 00:08:14,303
is the one they used in Prince of Persia, Sense of Time,

201
00:08:14,964 --> 00:08:18,186
where the entire game has this framing story of like

202
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,641
the main character narrating his adventures,

203
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:24,742
which fits really well with the whole Arabian Nights setting.

204
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:28,443
And when you do die in the game, the character goes like,

205
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:29,583
no, no, no, no, that's not what happened.

206
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,984
And sort of goes back a little way and tells it again.

207
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:35,484
And I find it a really cool solution.

208
00:08:37,265 --> 00:08:39,365
Now, another convention of video games that

209
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:42,172
we don't really think about a lot,

210
00:08:42,252 --> 00:08:45,153
is that there are these levels, these situations,

211
00:08:45,454 --> 00:08:46,874
which have been created for the player

212
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:50,296
to challenge the player and to test them.

213
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:52,898
And it's like, why?

214
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:53,858
Who does that?

215
00:08:54,499 --> 00:08:55,599
The question I used to ask a lot

216
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,380
when I was doing role-playing games in the 90s was like,

217
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:58,821
well, who built this dungeon?

218
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:00,963
And why does it still work after thousands of years, right?

219
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:04,565
And, you know, it's a convention,

220
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:06,806
and you don't think about it that much, but it's there.

221
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,367
And so one game which has sort of,

222
00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:15,537
explain that is Portal. And I think it's probably the most brilliant thing about Portal to me.

223
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:21,299
They have explained why these levels are there, and they have explained it in a completely unique

224
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:25,881
way, and they've even given a... they have put the level designer, in a way, the game designer,

225
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:28,542
as a character into the game, right, as GLaDOS.

226
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:30,426
And I think that's brilliant.

227
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:33,826
Another game which does the same thing is Manhunt,

228
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,527
where in the game, a very, I must stress this,

229
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:39,808
in the game, a very sick and disturbed individual

230
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:43,589
has created all these levels in a decrepit part of town

231
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:45,529
and is forcing your character to go through

232
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:48,710
and kill, I'm not gonna say innocent people,

233
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,511
but kill people for his amusement

234
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:53,431
while literally whispering in your ear, right?

235
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:56,932
And that makes Manhunt a very special experience.

236
00:09:59,495 --> 00:10:06,418
So what happens when I use this approach in the design process?

237
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:08,979
I tend to go back and forth between the mechanical

238
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,140
and the fictional.

239
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,961
You find some explanations for mechanical elements.

240
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:15,803
And once you've done that, that may trigger new ideas

241
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:16,703
for the mechanical side.

242
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:18,504
Because you go like, OK, so we've

243
00:10:18,644 --> 00:10:20,905
added this to the world so that this makes sense.

244
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:22,966
And then like, hey, but that means that blah.

245
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:24,587
And then, ah, that means these new mechanics.

246
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:25,268
This is super cool.

247
00:10:25,748 --> 00:10:28,089
And it's not uncommon to go back and forth a couple of times.

248
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:34,874
And here's an example from, this is a screenshot from Deus Ex Invisible War.

249
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:42,699
In Deus Ex 1 and Deus Ex sequel, you have these biomods, right, these augmentations

250
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,182
that you can sort of slot into your body and they give you new powers, right?

251
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:50,805
And apparently one of the designers of Invisible War sort of went like, you know, here's something

252
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:54,147
deeply creepy about taking some machine and just slotting it into your body and then it

253
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:54,928
modifies you.

254
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:55,408
And you're like, ooh.

255
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,769
You know, and what if?

256
00:10:57,488 --> 00:10:59,689
those machines don't come from a corporation

257
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:02,251
that you trust and that has QA processes

258
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,871
and all that stuff.

259
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:04,652
What if it comes from the black market, right?

260
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:06,954
What if it's like, you buy it from some guy,

261
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:08,695
you don't know, but it has really cool powers,

262
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:11,277
but it might have some downsides, you don't know.

263
00:11:11,357 --> 00:11:12,778
And then that's how the idea

264
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:15,259
for the black market biomods came along.

265
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:16,360
So I find it very cool,

266
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,722
it's not always going from one side to the other,

267
00:11:20,002 --> 00:11:21,563
it's definitely a back and forth,

268
00:11:21,603 --> 00:11:22,924
because it needs to balance, right?

269
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:28,470
You can also decide not to explain a convention

270
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,351
and to leave the mechanical side as is,

271
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:31,711
because it is a convention, right?

272
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:33,052
And sometimes it's better that way.

273
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:39,634
Because sometimes the solution of making it diegetic

274
00:11:39,694 --> 00:11:41,494
is worse than just leaving it.

275
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:46,756
So here's an example from a game called The Getaway for the PS2

276
00:11:46,876 --> 00:11:47,516
done by Sony.

277
00:11:48,396 --> 00:11:50,277
This is sort of a GTA-like game set

278
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:51,858
in a very realistic depiction of London.

279
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:53,418
And the game, you're on a mission.

280
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,558
The game is telling you where to go.

281
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:59,271
Can anyone tell where you have to go from screenshot?

282
00:12:00,871 --> 00:12:01,851
Yeah, to the left, exactly.

283
00:12:02,192 --> 00:12:04,312
It's the indicator light that shows you not

284
00:12:04,612 --> 00:12:06,293
where you are going to go in real life,

285
00:12:06,313 --> 00:12:07,594
but it shows you where you should go.

286
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,954
And so that is sort of like, it's not like real life,

287
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:10,915
and it's kind of subtle.

288
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:13,036
Whereas GTA did this.

289
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:14,896
It's like, oh, huge pink arrow.

290
00:12:15,877 --> 00:12:17,677
It's not subtle, but it works, because it's

291
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:20,038
such a convention that it's not that grating.

292
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:22,259
You sort of ignore it very quickly.

293
00:12:24,051 --> 00:12:26,033
So I think that's an important lesson.

294
00:12:28,154 --> 00:12:29,676
Conventions also evolve over time, right?

295
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,517
Common justifications become too commonplace.

296
00:12:32,178 --> 00:12:33,599
Think back on, do I have time?

297
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:34,700
Yeah, 11 minutes, I can talk this.

298
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,202
Think back of early novels where it was all like,

299
00:12:37,262 --> 00:12:39,503
oh, I'm writing you this letter,

300
00:12:39,804 --> 00:12:41,225
and then this letter's like novel length,

301
00:12:41,245 --> 00:12:43,487
and just to explain why I'm talking to you.

302
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:44,688
And then later people are like, no,

303
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:46,989
readers can deal with the fact that

304
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,411
I'm just reading this text

305
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:49,612
and I don't know where it's coming from, right?

306
00:12:49,632 --> 00:12:50,572
And it's the same in games.

307
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:55,501
Some things have just become a little bit too commonplace,

308
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:57,202
a bit cliche, in my opinion.

309
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,746
Conveniently placed audio diaries

310
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:03,468
as a way to optionally tell back story, like in Bioshock.

311
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:05,530
It was great in System Shock.

312
00:13:06,331 --> 00:13:09,294
I think by the time of Bioshock, well, I must admit,

313
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:11,776
I played Bioshock very late, like a couple of months ago,

314
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:12,497
first time I played it.

315
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:13,758
So I was like, oh, really?

316
00:13:13,978 --> 00:13:14,759
Audio diaries again?

317
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:18,486
So it's a great solution, but it has become,

318
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:20,548
in my opinion, it has become a bit of a cliche.

319
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:23,550
The same with the convention that technically

320
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,672
it is very, very hard to show another character

321
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:28,194
walking around with you and interacting with you

322
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:30,355
in a 3D space, right, that is super hard.

323
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:32,497
So the convention is not to have those characters

324
00:13:32,657 --> 00:13:34,418
walk around with you, but maybe to have them

325
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,400
talk to you through walkie-talkies

326
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,481
or through loudspeakers, right?

327
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:39,963
And that is, for me, has also become

328
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:41,544
a little bit like, oh, again, you know?

329
00:13:43,185 --> 00:13:45,286
And so when I see a game, and again, Bioshock, right?

330
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:47,808
All these loudspeakers everywhere,

331
00:13:47,888 --> 00:13:49,609
and then sort of people are talking at you

332
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:50,870
through these loudspeakers, and it's like,

333
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,071
oh, you know, I've seen it.

334
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:53,292
And then, you know, players are smart,

335
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,133
and they can spot overused explanations.

336
00:13:55,153 --> 00:13:56,154
They get used to certain things,

337
00:13:56,174 --> 00:13:58,576
and then you don't have to explain it anymore.

338
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:02,818
So, what does this mean for game teams?

339
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:04,380
Well,

340
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:09,903
working on this fictional side of design,

341
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:14,124
requires skills that you probably know well if you're a writer.

342
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:17,306
And it requires world building,

343
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:19,949
inventing characters, places, situations,

344
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:24,352
reconciling rules and fiction, which is not unlike reconciling plot and

345
00:14:24,392 --> 00:14:26,494
character, when you do when you write an actual story.

346
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:30,517
You know, you're adapting the game's fiction to the constraints of a medium, right?

347
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:35,061
And those are skills that every writer and every storyteller knows or should know, right?

348
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:38,263
But they have nothing to do per se with story,

349
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:40,105
you know, according to the definition.

350
00:14:41,118 --> 00:14:41,639
I started with.

351
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:44,860
They are a subset of the skills that you require to tell a story.

352
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,502
So virtually all games, and if you want to talk about it virtually, then come to the

353
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:52,663
spillover room or whatever that room is.

354
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:58,245
If virtually all games have a fictional side, then all game teams need storytelling skills,

355
00:14:58,405 --> 00:14:58,565
right?

356
00:14:58,745 --> 00:15:01,486
So those skills become essential to game development for most games.

357
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:05,467
And most companies, in my opinion, will benefit from looking at game design this way and having

358
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,348
these skills in the team.

359
00:15:08,294 --> 00:15:11,156
So, does that mean all game teams need writers?

360
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:12,256
No, I don't think so.

361
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:15,179
But, you know, because, don't hate me.

362
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,780
Each company is different, right?

363
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,882
The writers in game teams question goes beyond,

364
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:22,104
like I said, it's a very complicated problem.

365
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:23,845
It goes beyond what I've been talking about here.

366
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:26,247
And feel free to ask me after to my opinion

367
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:28,789
of the economic aspects of that problem

368
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:31,571
and the producer psychology aspect of that.

369
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:32,451
So, you know.

370
00:15:34,582 --> 00:15:36,002
Should more game teams have writers?

371
00:15:36,122 --> 00:15:37,943
Yes, probably, definitely.

372
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:40,304
So should more game teams have narrative designers?

373
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:42,304
Even though there's someone in the audience, Lee Sheldon,

374
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:44,405
who has strong opinions about the job title

375
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:48,687
of narrative designer, and I totally respect his opinion,

376
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:51,128
I invite you to ask him what it is later.

377
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:54,549
Yeah, there you go, he's sitting right there.

378
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,131
I think a lot of game teams could probably benefit

379
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:00,511
from having narrative designers, right?

380
00:16:00,571 --> 00:16:03,112
So I think in general it's a positive development.

381
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:05,786
Should more game designers learn about storytelling?

382
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:09,307
Even though they don't work on games that have story in them?

383
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:09,927
I think yes.

384
00:16:10,227 --> 00:16:11,528
I think it's important to be aware

385
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:17,250
that this is like a second part of the game.

386
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,311
You can't just look at the mechanics and at the systems.

387
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,852
Should more writers learn about game design?

388
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:24,432
Definitely yes, because that will help you.

389
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:26,593
First of all, maybe you can get to work on a game

390
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:27,693
without being called writer.

391
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:30,914
Also, it will help you work with game designers.

392
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:33,675
So I think really.

393
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:37,486
The important thing is to separate the skills

394
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,427
from the job titles and to separate the skills

395
00:16:39,488 --> 00:16:41,629
from the ideas about writing that you might have,

396
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:44,851
which I know in my case and in other cases I've seen,

397
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,632
you know, my idea of writing,

398
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:49,234
your idea of writing as a writer, right,

399
00:16:49,354 --> 00:16:51,095
those are not necessarily the same thing, right?

400
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,117
A lot of people, I didn't use the word writing much

401
00:16:54,237 --> 00:16:55,537
because I know for some people it's like,

402
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:57,339
oh yeah, that's when I write an email, right?

403
00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:00,080
So separate skills from ideas from writing,

404
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:02,602
ideas about writing and from job titles.

405
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:04,143
And that's it.

406
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:17,989
Right, thanks. So, thank you for listening. I'm on Twitter, I'm in e-mail. I want to thank a

407
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:21,071
friend of mine, Verena Riedel, who helped me with the images. You should hire her. She's a

408
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:24,213
kick-ass producer, mobile producer. Yeah, she's right there. Anyway.

409
00:17:29,378 --> 00:17:32,741
you want to ask questions. Yeah. Yeah. Spillover room. I

410
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:36,544
don't know why. Yeah. Oh, yeah. MC Yuri. Hello. Hey, Yuri. So

411
00:17:36,564 --> 00:17:39,967
you talked about conventions a bit and about the

412
00:17:58,223 --> 00:18:03,606
stuff like that. I wonder, using the black market mod example in Deus Ex or any of your

413
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:09,309
examples, you talk about how this back and forth between the fictional framing and the

414
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:15,091
design gave this interesting element, but at the same time it would be my opinion that

415
00:18:15,111 --> 00:18:17,513
the genre conventions, even of a genre bending or expanding game like Deus Ex, so grossly

416
00:18:17,573 --> 00:18:19,994
over-powered the region of Double Decade and continued to have this erosion in both forms,

417
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:20,254
in a way.

418
00:18:20,274 --> 00:18:22,795
It would be my opinion that DC's sort of scale project too, but this region of Double

419
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,777
Decade or West Wing was the future of the genre and if you're interested in some of

420
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:29,885
the interesting things that they've done as to almost make

421
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:33,007
the meaning of that black market mod almost irrelevant

422
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:36,550
in the context of how overwhelmingly powerful

423
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,671
the conventions that they're leveraging in terms

424
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:42,634
of hit points and mana and all of the other guns

425
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:44,975
and bullets and reloads and all of these other things

426
00:18:44,996 --> 00:18:49,279
that are just distilled convention that define the game

427
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,920
way more than one minor little piece.

428
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,041
And I wonder what your thoughts are

429
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:55,323
versus how powerful convention is.

430
00:18:55,705 --> 00:18:59,167
Yeah, thanks for not calling me out for saying that mechanics

431
00:18:59,187 --> 00:19:01,007
have no meaning, because I was afraid you

432
00:19:01,027 --> 00:19:01,868
were going to ask about that.

433
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:04,829
You're probably right.

434
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:07,570
The thing for me was I needed an example,

435
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,311
and I wanted to have an example of something actually happening

436
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:11,331
in actual game development.

437
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:13,012
And this was the only example I could find,

438
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,613
where Harvey told me this is the way it happened.

439
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:16,633
It went back.

440
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,034
So I know that when I do game design,

441
00:19:19,154 --> 00:19:20,375
I do often go back and forth.

442
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:26,442
And, you know, but if I go like, well, this one game I worked on five years ago, blah,

443
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:27,842
you know, nobody knows about this.

444
00:19:28,843 --> 00:19:30,463
So that's why I picked that example, right?

445
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:32,104
Because I figured people would know it.

446
00:19:32,144 --> 00:19:37,485
You're probably right that the overall experience of Deus Ex, you know, it's not the most important

447
00:19:37,505 --> 00:19:40,006
part, you know.

448
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:44,767
I guess I'm asking, do you think we could do a better job of tearing down the conventions

449
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:49,529
that are, you know, homogenizing some of our games and focus more on...

450
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,391
some of the more interesting things that we can get through this process.

451
00:19:53,771 --> 00:19:58,093
Yeah, I've been, once I started working on this, I've definitely felt, you know,

452
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:01,274
certainly, you know, it's like one of those things where you start finding conventions everywhere,

453
00:20:01,294 --> 00:20:09,998
and it helped me reframe sort of why I think Portal is interesting, you know, and Manhunt, right?

454
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:14,680
So suddenly you see stuff where you're like, hey, actually, we do that because that's a convention,

455
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,081
and then you go like, hey, what if you do it a different way, or, you know.

456
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:19,882
So yeah, so thanks for the question.

457
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:21,635
Anyone else?

458
00:20:22,536 --> 00:20:22,996
Yeah, here.

459
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:23,497
Hi.

460
00:20:24,738 --> 00:20:25,039
Where is?

461
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:26,020
Here, here.

462
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:27,341
Oh, sorry.

463
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:27,862
Yes, hi.

464
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:29,784
Sorry.

465
00:20:30,065 --> 00:20:32,768
Do you have any recommendation as a game designer

466
00:20:32,788 --> 00:20:33,909
on how to learn to write?

467
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,451
How to do what, sorry?

468
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:36,152
How to write.

469
00:20:36,172 --> 00:20:37,113
How to learn to write.

470
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:42,744
I am a huge reader on how to write,

471
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:45,308
which if you know how to write, you will know

472
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,690
it's actually completely useless.

473
00:20:48,152 --> 00:20:50,555
And the number one advice I've always...

474
00:20:52,675 --> 00:20:55,238
have seen is just right, right?

475
00:20:55,398 --> 00:20:56,639
Which is actually the same for game design.

476
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:57,940
It's probably the same for every skill.

477
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,162
So then the question is like, well, you know,

478
00:21:00,362 --> 00:21:02,844
you don't just go sit down and just instantly go like,

479
00:21:02,885 --> 00:21:04,926
hey, you know, like, I'll just write Moby Dick

480
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:05,567
or whatever, right?

481
00:21:05,987 --> 00:21:10,251
So doing the right writing exercises in the right order

482
00:21:11,072 --> 00:21:15,576
is not something I've personally cracked, you know?

483
00:21:16,196 --> 00:21:17,337
I don't call myself a writer.

484
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,583
So, I don't know, immerse yourself in it, try doing it.

485
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:25,845
Maybe work on twine games.

486
00:21:26,225 --> 00:21:27,446
I have started doing that recently

487
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,068
and I found it really useful as a sort of, yeah,

488
00:21:30,168 --> 00:21:33,090
as a writing slash interactive storytelling exercise.

489
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,591
So I hope that helps.

490
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:39,774
I mean, there are definitely, again, if you,

491
00:21:40,295 --> 00:21:42,096
I wouldn't want to recommend anything like,

492
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:45,458
you know, what do these people call them,

493
00:21:45,518 --> 00:21:46,879
McKee and all those books,

494
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:48,540
because I know Leah will kill me.

495
00:21:48,894 --> 00:21:50,015
All right, so, sorry.

496
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:53,219
I hope that helps a little bit.

497
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:53,940
Thanks.

498
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,522
Yeah, anyone else?

499
00:21:57,585 --> 00:21:57,625
No?

500
00:21:57,645 --> 00:21:59,728
All right.

501
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:00,870
Thanks.
