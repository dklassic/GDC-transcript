Hi, I'm Nils SÃ¸rensen. I'm the music composer and one of the game designers at Bedtime Digital Games,

2
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:20,012
an indie game company based in Denmark.

3
00:00:21,052 --> 00:00:23,993
I recently did the sound effects, music and songs for the game Figment.

4
00:00:24,654 --> 00:00:29,315
Figment is set in a world full of music, where the characters actually sing to each other, like in a stage musical.

5
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:32,616
I'm the plague, you fear of disease!

6
00:00:32,856 --> 00:00:35,237
I come with wharf and rotten teeth!

7
00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:36,137
These aisles are...

8
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:39,979
Also, the sound sources in the environment seamlessly blend with the background music,

9
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:43,861
such as trumpets that play along to the music and raindrops that fall on the beat.

10
00:00:46,782 --> 00:00:49,903
Composing an interactive musical, Lessons Learned from Creating Figment,

11
00:00:50,404 --> 00:00:55,766
will be a dive into the practical approaches used to create Figment's interactive soundtrack and musical sound effects.

12
00:00:56,937 --> 00:01:02,340
The talk will also deal with how motifs and musical themes help tell the game's story and tie together the universe.

13
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,082
And how musical numbers help build characters through different song genres and lyrics.

14
00:01:11,503 --> 00:01:15,585
If you are interested in all things music and games, come catch the talk on Thursday, 5.30pm.

15
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:15,905
See y'all!
