00:00:04,683 --> 00:00:07,786
Hello, thank you for coming.

2
00:00:07,786 --> 00:00:11,209
So I'll talk about designing gameplay with a theme in mind

3
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:13,491
and how I utilize it to conjure mood

4
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:16,274
out of systems and numbers.

5
00:00:16,274 --> 00:00:19,877
It's also a study of design problems that came up

6
00:00:19,877 --> 00:00:23,480
when we assumed that theme comes first.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,423
So I've been designing games for almost 13 years now

8
00:00:26,423 --> 00:00:30,066
and I recently co-founded a new company.

9
00:00:31,102 --> 00:00:34,383
Artificer previously I was the lead designer of games like

10
00:00:34,383 --> 00:00:37,343
Phantom Doctrine and hard West and before that I worked at

11
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:41,805
Techland did multiplayer design for all of course all call for

12
00:00:41,805 --> 00:00:44,105
his games except the good one.

13
00:00:44,105 --> 00:00:48,306
So I was told I'm supposed to have a talk agenda at the

14
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:49,887
beginning but mine is like.

15
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:53,628
It's really bad so briefly here's what to expect as you

16
00:00:53,628 --> 00:00:59,370
can see it's about the themes themes systems and themes.

17
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:06,044
So I'll be talking using examples mostly from our latest game, Phantom Doctrine.

18
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:11,828
Phantom Doctrine is a strategic turn-based espionage thriller set at the peak of the Cold War.

19
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:16,832
And we've received some high notes, including a 9 out of 10 from GameSpot.

20
00:01:16,832 --> 00:01:20,354
Got a decent meta and user score, respectively 74 and 73.

21
00:01:20,354 --> 00:01:24,377
And occasionally I will compare Phantom Doctrine.

22
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,893
with our previous game called hard West.

23
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:30,714
It sold over 400,000 copies.

24
00:01:30,714 --> 00:01:34,437
Hard West has got 44 Metacritic reviews,

25
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:37,419
which in this league is a lot,

26
00:01:37,419 --> 00:01:40,241
at least like two times more than average.

27
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:45,084
And similarly, decent meta and user score,

28
00:01:45,084 --> 00:01:46,105
respectively 74 and 77.

29
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:52,310
So here's how Hard West stacks against Phantom Doctrine.

30
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,403
Funtime took almost twice as long by twice the team and it seems quality wise

31
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:59,785
it's exactly the same thing.

32
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:02,788
So throughout this talk I'll also try to

33
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,229
answer the question of

34
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,210
what the hell.

35
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:10,495
Strong theme and mood have been listed as major positive in over 90%

36
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:12,297
of press reviews for both games.

37
00:02:12,297 --> 00:02:14,419
However it occasionally

38
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:15,960
exploded.

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,861
So here's how.

40
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:25,285
Theme and scope. So the main kind of feedback we got for hard West was no territory management

41
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:28,806
No base building no character development. So basically not XCOM enough

42
00:02:28,806 --> 00:02:33,888
So in Phantom Doctrine, we added all that increase the budget

43
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:35,832
increase the time, increase the scope.

44
00:02:35,832 --> 00:02:39,554
It has base management, roadmap, character development.

45
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:41,375
It just like XCOM, it has multiplayer

46
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,136
that no one ever plays.

47
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:44,817
And all the systems and features

48
00:02:44,817 --> 00:02:47,639
were there to support the theme.

49
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,001
And all systems are very interconnected.

50
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:54,283
And so we did encounter a lot of problems

51
00:02:54,283 --> 00:02:56,064
when we wanted to cut down

52
00:02:56,064 --> 00:02:58,265
and scale down some of the features.

53
00:02:58,265 --> 00:03:00,246
Cutting meant that the theme

54
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,327
and the structure might fall apart.

55
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:06,896
So in order to preserve your theme and structure

56
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,076
and still be able to modify scope,

57
00:03:09,076 --> 00:03:13,197
you should start building features in a modular way.

58
00:03:13,197 --> 00:03:18,239
So we start with defining the minimum viable project,

59
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,080
MVP for short, that is like the smallest possible version

60
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,001
of a feature that still does the job.

61
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:29,507
And we treat all other ideas that come to mind,

62
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:31,648
and obviously there are a lot,

63
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:36,250
as expansion modules that may or may not be implemented.

64
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,292
This way you don't risk damaging your theme

65
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:42,633
and you don't risk your structure falling apart

66
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:45,194
because instead of cutting out features,

67
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:47,155
you can scale them down a lot.

68
00:03:49,357 --> 00:03:54,719
The consequence of thoroughly implementing your theme is that it can explode in your face, once again.

69
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:02,684
So, to talk about this, I'll start with explaining a system that is called sidesteps.

70
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:08,507
So, way back in the day, in classic XCOM, you could accidentally run straight into your enemy.

71
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:11,929
And accidents like that are not very tactical.

72
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:17,094
In general, strategic and tactical gameplay is about how you handle information.

73
00:04:17,094 --> 00:04:20,858
So you need information to be able to play tactically.

74
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:27,265
So nowadays characters, in most games like this, characters stick to cover, peeking out, it's called sidestepping.

75
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:29,067
However, that doesn't solve everything.

76
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:30,828
Consider a single...

77
00:04:31,894 --> 00:04:33,535
tile of hedge, right?

78
00:04:33,535 --> 00:04:37,576
And hedge isn't cover, so there are no cover sidesteps.

79
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:43,438
If this was indeed solid cover, sidesteps would work,

80
00:04:43,438 --> 00:04:46,539
characters would peek, and would see each other.

81
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:50,481
So we added what we call the free sidesteps.

82
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:52,702
Characters can peek not only when sticking to cover,

83
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:55,523
but anytime, anywhere, in any direction.

84
00:04:56,023 --> 00:04:57,964
Now, given that Phantom Doctrine,

85
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,426
being a Cold War spy thing,

86
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:03,908
is predominantly interior-based,

87
00:05:03,908 --> 00:05:06,069
this solved a lot of unwanted surprises,

88
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:08,591
like the one I described at the beginning,

89
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:10,312
and made the game far more tactical.

90
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:10,992
That sounds good, right?

91
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:15,535
But here's how this solution occasionally backfires.

92
00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:18,037
Characters just shoot through walls.

93
00:05:18,037 --> 00:05:19,498
It's not that frequent,

94
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:21,199
but we got a lot of lag from that,

95
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,660
a lot of negative feedback.

96
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:27,376
So in order to fix systemic design issues,

97
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:30,458
it's good to go back in time and analyze

98
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,799
your trail of thought step by step.

99
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,081
You'll usually find a couple of weak links

100
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:37,782
and weak points that you could improve.

101
00:05:37,782 --> 00:05:41,425
So we wanted the player to have more information.

102
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,786
And for tactical gameplay, in terms you need

103
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:45,807
more information about enemy position.

104
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:49,791
But you have to see a character to reveal them.

105
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,473
So we broaden the definition of seeing someone

106
00:05:52,473 --> 00:05:53,554
with the three sight steps.

107
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:56,337
And because line of sight equals line of fire,

108
00:05:56,337 --> 00:05:58,459
as in if you see someone, you can shoot them,

109
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:01,962
thus more unclear cases of line of fire.

110
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,744
And there is a result of that.

111
00:06:03,744 --> 00:06:07,387
Occasionally, characters shoot through walls.

112
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:09,828
So to untangle this situation,

113
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,389
you have to take a step back

114
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:16,492
and find a point that you can deviate from most easily.

115
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:20,255
So for example, we could also reveal enemies that you hear

116
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,976
instead of doing free sidesteps,

117
00:06:21,976 --> 00:06:24,477
which would probably be a better, cheaper solution.

118
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:27,439
So I have no idea why it came to me

119
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,861
like the moment I was writing this talk.

120
00:06:29,861 --> 00:06:31,622
So anyway.

121
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:35,945
So there's also a more general lesson to be learned here.

122
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:39,448
So in systemic games, ludonarrative dissonance

123
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:41,969
pertains to rules.

124
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,831
So the theme in your game will get the player

125
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:46,632
in a certain mood.

126
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:50,415
And this mood will affect how the player

127
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:52,536
interprets the rules of the game.

128
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:55,718
Because the narrative is built by your systems,

129
00:06:55,718 --> 00:06:58,640
in forms of player stories.

130
00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:04,811
So game rules should go hand in hand with the game theme.

131
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:06,652
If your theme is realistic,

132
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:08,733
players might expect realistic rules.

133
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:10,234
If your theme is abstract,

134
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:12,975
players will be okay with abstract rules.

135
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:23,239
Okay, so I wanted to make luck an important pillar

136
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:26,801
of Hard West because it works with the theme, right?

137
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:27,361
Luck is very...

138
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:35,575
wild westy and people have a lot of ideas about how exactly luck works and often you can use

139
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:40,419
the common understanding of an abstract concept and make it into a game mechanic so that's exactly

140
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:46,865
what we did and hardware slack system works like this that's that's my funny gif I have one and

141
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:51,570
this is it like like you if you were planning to laugh at some point during this throughout

142
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,331
this presentation this is this is the moment

143
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:55,944
Excellent, thank you.

144
00:07:55,944 --> 00:08:00,587
So characters have luck, and luck helps you dodge shots.

145
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:02,148
When you shoot, target luck is reduced

146
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,349
by the amount equal to your accuracy,

147
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:07,791
and when the target's luck is depleted, you hit the target.

148
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:11,734
The reception of this was, in general, very good.

149
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:13,535
It catered to the group of XCOM players

150
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,317
who didn't like random number generation.

151
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:18,438
It gives you compelling predictability.

152
00:08:18,438 --> 00:08:21,420
It's new, it's fresh, and it sets hardware apart

153
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,161
from XCOM, so exactly what we wanted.

154
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:28,164
So we did a similar thing in Phantom Doctrine.

155
00:08:28,164 --> 00:08:31,705
As we all know, like real life agents and spies

156
00:08:31,705 --> 00:08:33,785
like Jason Bourne and James Bond

157
00:08:33,785 --> 00:08:36,166
are trained to have great awareness,

158
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,126
constantly aware of their surroundings.

159
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:41,647
They never get surprised by an attack.

160
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:45,488
You need to really wear them down to be able to shoot them.

161
00:08:45,488 --> 00:08:46,788
So in Phantom Doctrine,

162
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:49,088
awareness system replaced the luck system.

163
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,801
So our characters can dodge shots when they see them coming.

164
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,742
And mathematically, it's almost the same system.

165
00:08:57,742 --> 00:08:59,803
But for some reason, a lot of players didn't like it.

166
00:08:59,803 --> 00:09:00,023
Why?

167
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:05,064
Like, why did this system get good feedback in Hard West

168
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:07,065
but bad feedback in Phantom Doctrine?

169
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:11,446
Now, consider what is the common standard system

170
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:12,827
for a chance to hit.

171
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:14,848
Accuracy is a percentage chance to hit.

172
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:18,512
make a role lower than that percentage to hit,

173
00:09:18,512 --> 00:09:18,992
simple as that.

174
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:22,713
So Heart was straight up lied about this.

175
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:24,634
We added the percentage symbol

176
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:25,554
and called it chance to hit,

177
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:28,696
which it wasn't, like at all.

178
00:09:28,696 --> 00:09:30,956
There are no random roles here.

179
00:09:30,956 --> 00:09:33,437
And it was far better received

180
00:09:33,437 --> 00:09:37,459
because this was a simplification

181
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:41,460
good enough for beginner players and expert players,

182
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,621
so right through and appreciated the clockwork mechanic

183
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:45,062
behind it.

184
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,211
So how to do it right.

185
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:52,253
How a system works and how it's presented to the player

186
00:09:52,253 --> 00:09:54,295
are two completely different things.

187
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:56,956
How it works is for the power players.

188
00:09:56,956 --> 00:09:59,698
How it's presented is for the new players.

189
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:03,280
System mechanics and its presentation

190
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,062
are two vastly different things.

191
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:10,004
So in other words, if your new mechanic behaves

192
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:13,386
like something familiar, just make it look familiar.

193
00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:16,648
Lie about your mechanics to onboard the new players.

194
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,266
And never let your theme confuse the player.

195
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:24,027
The rule of thumb, when in doubt,

196
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:30,271
just clarify the mechanics, even if it will damage your theme.

197
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,432
So about balance structure, which

198
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:36,555
is something super complex that no one knows how to do,

199
00:10:36,555 --> 00:10:38,436
and sometimes it just works.

200
00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:39,856
And people have spreadsheets and shit.

201
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:42,618
So there are two main gameplay layers

202
00:10:42,618 --> 00:10:47,561
in Fandom Doctrine, the tactical and the world map.

203
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:47,861
And.

204
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:53,619
In the world map, enemy AI will create events

205
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:57,021
that the player has or chooses to react to.

206
00:10:57,021 --> 00:10:59,062
And with almost all event types,

207
00:10:59,062 --> 00:11:03,445
one of your actions is to start a tactical mission

208
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:08,468
where mission type is determined by the event type.

209
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:08,809
Okay, you got this?

210
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:09,029
We're good?

211
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:09,409
Okay.

212
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:13,452
So, for example, if you attack an enemy agent

213
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:16,113
on a mission to find your hideout,

214
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:19,512
you'll have a tactical mission where you have to kill

215
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,113
a single enemy agent and hunt them down.

216
00:11:22,113 --> 00:11:26,474
Or if enemy is plotting to assassinate an informer of yours,

217
00:11:26,474 --> 00:11:31,875
you'll start a mission that is basically a VIP rescue.

218
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,396
So we have a decent variety of mission types

219
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:35,676
that are quite different.

220
00:11:35,676 --> 00:11:39,477
And ideally,

221
00:11:39,477 --> 00:11:42,157
given how many mission types there are,

222
00:11:42,157 --> 00:11:44,598
there should be variety.

223
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:49,741
and players should, on average, play similar amounts

224
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:51,763
of different missions.

225
00:11:51,763 --> 00:11:54,785
Yet we got, obviously, a lot of backlash for repetition,

226
00:11:54,785 --> 00:11:57,527
and players said it's boring

227
00:11:57,527 --> 00:12:00,329
because they only play one mission type over and over.

228
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:03,691
So, turns out, with this structure,

229
00:12:03,691 --> 00:12:07,974
this could not be fixed

230
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:09,936
because there are two conflicting ideas.

231
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,620
balance frequency of world events,

232
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,622
and balance frequency of tactical missions.

233
00:12:15,622 --> 00:12:19,024
Balance in the world map was tied to mission type balance.

234
00:12:19,024 --> 00:12:23,226
So when I balanced the frequency of the world map events,

235
00:12:23,226 --> 00:12:26,207
I broke the balance of tactical mission variety.

236
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:29,709
World map events could never be equally balanced

237
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:31,310
because they have different frequency

238
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,951
and different conditions to be met

239
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:35,152
before they could even appear on the map.

240
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:40,316
So the big lesson here is to just balance system separately.

241
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:43,938
Tactical missions and the world map missions

242
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:45,639
should have been just unrelated.

243
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,500
Each of those should have been balanced

244
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,523
in its own regard, in its own right, and then tied.

245
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,524
This, obviously, would hurt the theme

246
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,546
because that's why the connections were there.

247
00:12:57,546 --> 00:12:59,307
But always watch out for situations

248
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:02,368
where theme affects the balance

249
00:13:02,368 --> 00:13:04,710
because they will be problematic.

250
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:14,517
Okay, so we wanted the game to be possibly endless at any point.

251
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:18,560
Okay, so you don't have to proceed unless you want to.

252
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,801
You can collect loot, you can gather secrets,

253
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,842
you can level up your agents,

254
00:13:22,842 --> 00:13:25,424
and when you feel ready, you can move on.

255
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:27,345
No pressure.

256
00:13:27,345 --> 00:13:29,026
Obviously, a lot of pressure because there's, like,

257
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:31,828
a conspiracy that is plotting to destroy the world, blah, blah, blah.

258
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:33,949
But in terms of gameplay and numbers...

259
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:39,795
No pressure and our estimate was 40 hours for a company play through and the

260
00:13:39,795 --> 00:13:43,476
feedback was obviously surprising.

261
00:13:43,476 --> 00:13:48,017
So the people of course it's a boring repetitive repetitive grind with 100

262
00:13:48,017 --> 00:13:48,917
hour play throughs.

263
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:57,438
Why would the players take more time to go through the campaign and complain

264
00:13:57,438 --> 00:13:58,018
about it.

265
00:13:58,018 --> 00:14:04,340
Why would they make their path boring and then complain that it's boring.

266
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:11,661
So to untangle this, you must first know how the big campaign loop,

267
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:14,262
how does the big campaign loop works.

268
00:14:14,262 --> 00:14:19,423
So the game is split into what we call campaign stages

269
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:22,444
and a string of perils structure.

270
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:28,546
And campaign stage is the open part between two story missions.

271
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:30,027
That's the loop, okay?

272
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,064
where players can take on generated missions,

273
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:35,605
as many as they want.

274
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:38,248
And for each stage, there's a finite pool

275
00:14:38,248 --> 00:14:40,710
of stuff they can find at random,

276
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,474
like weapons, new technologies, shit like that.

277
00:14:44,474 --> 00:14:46,816
And when player chooses to do so,

278
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:48,958
they proceed to the next story mission,

279
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,860
to the next campaign stage,

280
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,743
where they unlock the new pool of loot.

281
00:14:55,455 --> 00:14:58,717
So, players can play infinite number of missions

282
00:14:58,717 --> 00:15:02,820
with finite number of random loot drops and random unlocks.

283
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,564
But the problem is, they don't know when they got it all.

284
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:10,406
And they don't know when it's okay,

285
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:13,108
when they should proceed.

286
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:14,429
No, the reason for this is,

287
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:17,291
well, the player is kept in the dark

288
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,812
because that's the theme.

289
00:15:19,478 --> 00:15:26,802
you have a organization and you're looking for a secret conspiracy that is like out there somewhere

290
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:33,385
and they have secret documents so like it doesn't make sense to know how many secrets do they have

291
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:39,488
right so that's part of the fantasy not knowing what's out there but at the same time players

292
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:45,771
will want to know they got it all like in pokemon probably or something if they accomplished the

293
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:45,991
goal

294
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:52,753
So clearly communicate game states of theme.

295
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:54,836
Well-paced means something completely

296
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:56,658
different for every player.

297
00:15:56,658 --> 00:16:00,042
So just tell the player when it's OK to proceed, simply put.

298
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:05,603
Um, okay.

299
00:16:05,603 --> 00:16:07,684
Systems based on theme.

300
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:11,046
So in Phantom Doctrine we have this super, super cool feature

301
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:13,828
called investigation, which I'm super proud of.

302
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:15,208
You're supposed to love it when you play it.

303
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:19,171
So you collect bits of information, files, photos,

304
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:20,932
and you make the connections to figure out

305
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:23,633
the key information, like who's the bad guy,

306
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:24,274
and so on, so on.

307
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,935
So the feedback is pretty good,

308
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:28,216
like this is just like the movies.

309
00:16:28,957 --> 00:16:30,899
I should have made this a gif as well.

310
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,582
Anyway, so we put a lot of effort

311
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:35,965
to turn this prototype into something good.

312
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:42,279
Still felt wrong. It was it was

313
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:47,140
It was papers out of scale laid out on a desk connected with abstract lines

314
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,761
So, you know not looking crazy at all like at all

315
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:58,663
So then it it would turn it into something much better that would deliver the right fantasy with the right

316
00:16:58,663 --> 00:16:58,883
details

317
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:04,264
so with themes details are super important and

318
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,043
To do this right, you need to pick one interaction

319
00:17:08,043 --> 00:17:11,086
that you want to simulate for your player

320
00:17:11,086 --> 00:17:13,428
and really get to the bottom of it.

321
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:16,150
So for example, in Ace Attorney, the key interaction

322
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,752
is finding the contradiction in the statement, right?

323
00:17:18,752 --> 00:17:20,694
But you don't have to learn the law, right?

324
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:23,497
It's really simplified, and it really boils down

325
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:25,358
to one simple interaction.

326
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:28,201
So find a winning game.

327
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:30,122
Actually, I have one more funny gif.

328
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:34,747
I find it very funny.

329
00:17:34,747 --> 00:17:38,810
So find a winning game state and a failing game state that feel just right.

330
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:46,897
You have to get these moments right because these key moments will deliver your theme.

331
00:17:46,897 --> 00:17:50,961
Because everyone who played Ace Attorney recognizes exactly that.

332
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:51,922
Maybe not that well.

333
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:53,083
You get the idea.

334
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:57,886
So this went right, we got the fantasy right with correct details.

335
00:17:57,886 --> 00:18:02,149
What it really means to do, to perform this action,

336
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:05,651
the investigation board is about connecting related things.

337
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,773
But of course, there were other issues with this,

338
00:18:08,773 --> 00:18:10,734
so again, a lot of backlash.

339
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:13,175
So on average, about 20 hours into the game,

340
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:17,858
players no longer were surprised by the content it provided,

341
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:18,538
and got bored.

342
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:25,536
So we kind of anticipated that and we feared that the players will grow tired

343
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:29,019
of it because obviously there was finite number of content in it,

344
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:32,221
although it was generated from pieces, but still.

345
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:36,905
So we made it possible to automate and skip the whole thing, okay?

346
00:18:36,905 --> 00:18:41,608
So you can assign your agents to do this for you.

347
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:44,290
And when you look at the achievement stats,

348
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,572
at least 91% of players did use the skip mechanic.

349
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:52,371
which sounds about right, but is like super wrong

350
00:18:52,371 --> 00:18:55,512
because players wanted to play this so much,

351
00:18:55,512 --> 00:18:56,672
not to skip it, right?

352
00:18:56,672 --> 00:18:59,874
So they wanted it to not get boring

353
00:18:59,874 --> 00:19:01,214
in any foreseeable future.

354
00:19:01,214 --> 00:19:03,655
So the problem here, the longevity of the feature.

355
00:19:03,655 --> 00:19:08,517
So there are two conflicting ideas,

356
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:09,558
two conflicting goals here.

357
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:13,619
One, players can solve infinite number of case files

358
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,160
on the investigation board and it never gets boring.

359
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:20,929
which is, you know, impossible because everything

360
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:22,951
will get boring eventually.

361
00:19:22,951 --> 00:19:25,152
There's will flow through any amount of content

362
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:27,854
you can prepare and eventually it will get boring

363
00:19:27,854 --> 00:19:29,755
and they will whine that it got boring

364
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:32,357
and it's your fault that they played it too much

365
00:19:32,357 --> 00:19:34,698
because it's so good, so good.

366
00:19:34,698 --> 00:19:36,979
But anyway, so the solution here,

367
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:38,881
so how to do is right is,

368
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:41,402
write out how many times the feature

369
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:43,203
supposed to ideally show up in your game.

370
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:46,012
It is not a number.

371
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:47,874
Yeah, three is a number.

372
00:19:47,874 --> 00:19:50,476
Three thousands is a number.

373
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:54,520
And plan exactly how much content in that feature

374
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,103
do you need for this many uses of this feature.

375
00:19:58,103 --> 00:19:59,985
And plan precisely how many actions

376
00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:02,026
the players will perform.

377
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:05,409
How many times they will see a piece of information.

378
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:09,133
And encourage and reward the players

379
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:10,254
to stick to your schedule.

380
00:20:11,314 --> 00:20:15,856
Or, well, if you don't want it, you can always enforce it.

381
00:20:15,856 --> 00:20:19,357
Because you need to keep the audience hungry for more.

382
00:20:19,357 --> 00:20:22,779
Like, if I, for example, if I knew best,

383
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:24,679
the number one magic trick in the world,

384
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:28,061
and you saw it once, you'd love it, probably.

385
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,401
Well, assuming it's good.

386
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:31,882
But if I showed you, if I showed the trick to you

387
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:36,104
over and over 100 times, then you'd get to the point

388
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:39,025
where you'd say, well, it's not that impressive, really.

389
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:40,365
It's kind of boring, even.

390
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:49,019
In order for your gameplay mechanics to be magical, keep the audience hungry for more and carefully plan the pacing.

391
00:20:51,238 --> 00:20:52,278
Systems adjusted for team.

392
00:20:52,278 --> 00:20:55,559
Like, these titles are really bad,

393
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,140
but it's like version 3.0,

394
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,661
and they're like so much better than they used to be.

395
00:20:59,661 --> 00:21:02,061
Anyway, Phantom Doctrine has this feature

396
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,642
called support powers.

397
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:06,063
So before the mission,

398
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:09,044
you can assign agents to support powers,

399
00:21:09,044 --> 00:21:10,964
like sniper, spotter, stuff like that.

400
00:21:10,964 --> 00:21:13,905
You can place them outside the mission area.

401
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,986
And the gameplay-wise, these are just...

402
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:21,048
very simple direct global cast abilities

403
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:24,070
with a nice cut scene that was super cheap.

404
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,151
So it went well because it was just enough.

405
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:30,713
It's a very, very simple system, very cheap system

406
00:21:30,713 --> 00:21:32,854
with simple directional cast abilities

407
00:21:32,854 --> 00:21:34,895
and cheap cut scenes relatively

408
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:37,136
because we reused a lot of content for that

409
00:21:37,136 --> 00:21:39,897
and the character in the cut scene

410
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:44,199
has the visuals of the agent that you assigned to do this.

411
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:48,672
So, the lesson learned.

412
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:54,716
So the final effect was exactly the same as the first trivial prototype that we did,

413
00:21:54,716 --> 00:21:56,397
plus all the bells and whistles.

414
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:59,799
And the prototype was very effective and perfectly accurate.

415
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:06,304
So too often prototypes we all make have very little in common with the final result.

416
00:22:06,304 --> 00:22:09,946
And the more they differ, the more messy the production is bound to be.

417
00:22:10,908 --> 00:22:14,650
So make sure your prototype is exactly the gameplay

418
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,673
you intend to have and not like half of it.

419
00:22:18,673 --> 00:22:21,735
Prototypes should always be abstract.

420
00:22:21,735 --> 00:22:24,417
Making a feature fit the theme is so much easier

421
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:27,119
than making a good feature.

422
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,181
It's easy to convince yourself and the team

423
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:34,103
to a bad mechanic that is wrapped in a good theme.

424
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:37,245
So remember, first the gameplay,

425
00:22:37,245 --> 00:22:40,147
and second the game, a coat of theme paint.

426
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:48,030
So every theme is a context in which words mean different things.

427
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:53,493
The initial goal for a feature we had, called simultaneous orders,

428
00:22:53,493 --> 00:22:58,935
was to provide change in the term-based monotony.

429
00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:06,659
So the idea was to give the player an option to act out orders simultaneously.

430
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:12,383
Players could give out any orders to all agents and have them do them have them

431
00:23:12,383 --> 00:23:13,584
do it all at once.

432
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:19,069
Now the problem is it was it wasn't particularly good at anything so sure I

433
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:24,153
can do a couple of things at once but why would I like it even takes more

434
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:31,179
clicks this way so like no one used it and second if your game is based

435
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:36,523
assuming it a real-time mechanic is a technical nightmare

436
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:41,466
So we narrowed it down to a single context,

437
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:44,409
a single use, and we called it breach,

438
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:48,252
which means have all your agents enter

439
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:51,094
and shoot everyone at the same time, basically.

440
00:23:51,413 --> 00:23:53,694
That's what this word now means

441
00:23:53,694 --> 00:23:55,854
in the context of Phantom Doctrine.

442
00:23:55,854 --> 00:23:57,975
And it's useful because it counters,

443
00:23:57,975 --> 00:24:00,875
Overwatch counters the enemy defense

444
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,976
and they won't trigger when you come in.

445
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:05,736
And it's just three clicks,

446
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,737
so it's actually less clicks

447
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,577
than if you were to do step by step.

448
00:24:09,577 --> 00:24:10,837
So you just choose to breach,

449
00:24:10,837 --> 00:24:12,897
choose the room and confirm, that's it.

450
00:24:12,897 --> 00:24:17,198
Now, because that's what it means in this theme,

451
00:24:17,198 --> 00:24:18,679
to enter a room simultaneously

452
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:21,199
and neutralize everyone in range.

453
00:24:22,172 --> 00:24:23,973
So how to do this right?

454
00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:28,195
Make one use case work perfectly well

455
00:24:28,195 --> 00:24:30,496
and like if you've got the money, do more.

456
00:24:30,496 --> 00:24:31,457
But ask yourself this.

457
00:24:31,457 --> 00:24:34,538
Can your feature be shown and importantly experienced

458
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:36,139
at the push of a button?

459
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:39,281
And can you name it like the right way

460
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:42,322
to be part of the fantasy and not just a feature

461
00:24:42,322 --> 00:24:46,504
like tagged on top of the game?

462
00:24:46,504 --> 00:24:48,565
Okay, so last part.

463
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:51,367
Oh wow, I'm perfect.

464
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:51,427
So.

465
00:24:52,332 --> 00:24:55,454
In a setting that fully depicts a realistic situation

466
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:58,255
or context, you'll be constantly wondering

467
00:24:58,255 --> 00:25:01,397
how far can you go with your own inventions.

468
00:25:01,397 --> 00:25:04,739
So it's like biography movies,

469
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:06,800
where usually the plot falls apart

470
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,781
somewhere towards the end,

471
00:25:07,781 --> 00:25:10,462
because no real life is written

472
00:25:10,462 --> 00:25:13,364
according to the three-act structure and so on.

473
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:16,545
So give your setting a unique spin

474
00:25:16,545 --> 00:25:18,626
to allow for anything you desire.

475
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:21,728
You need to give yourself means to channel

476
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:29,188
any loose ends into where unresolved logic problems die.

477
00:25:29,188 --> 00:25:31,608
So for example, in Phantom Doctrine,

478
00:25:31,608 --> 00:25:33,449
it's a game about spies,

479
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,870
but also have a massive worldwide conspiracy going on.

480
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,991
And the key mediums here are this could happen

481
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:43,151
because he was brainwashed, for example,

482
00:25:43,151 --> 00:25:46,272
and no one knows how exactly brainwashing works

483
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:48,253
because it's like kind of fantasy.

484
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,991
allegedly, who knows.

485
00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:55,293
But anyway, and the conspiracy theories,

486
00:25:55,293 --> 00:25:57,414
they were all true all along.

487
00:25:57,414 --> 00:26:00,815
So we're suckers for conspiracy theories,

488
00:26:00,815 --> 00:26:03,797
and a small part of us all wants them to be true.

489
00:26:03,797 --> 00:26:08,159
And in case of Hard West, it's Wild West,

490
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,360
but with demons and the occult.

491
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,702
So we made the assumption that the world of Hard West

492
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:16,543
is where all myths and legends were true.

493
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:19,205
And when you do that,

494
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:21,321
any idea you have will.

495
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:22,142
Because it doesn't have to make sense.

496
00:26:22,142 --> 00:26:22,922
That is it.

497
00:26:22,922 --> 00:26:23,282
Thank you.

498
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:23,562
Thank you.

499
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:23,742
Thank you.

500
00:26:23,742 --> 00:26:24,182
Thank you.

501
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:24,702
Thank you.

502
00:26:24,702 --> 00:26:25,403
Thank you.

503
00:26:25,403 --> 00:26:25,983
Thank you.

504
00:26:25,983 --> 00:26:27,183
Thank you.

505
00:26:27,183 --> 00:26:28,243
Thank you.

506
00:26:28,243 --> 00:26:28,423
Thank you.

507
00:26:28,423 --> 00:26:28,703
Thank you, Kasper.

508
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:29,484
If you have a question for Kasper,

509
00:26:29,484 --> 00:26:38,366
please come to the mic in the middle aisle.

510
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:41,067
We've got time for a couple questions.

511
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:44,528
And I've got one myself to start things off.

512
00:26:45,023 --> 00:26:50,488
Hi, I'm Ryan. My question is about the difference between Hard West and Phantom Doctrine. You

513
00:26:50,488 --> 00:26:56,153
talked about how you had such a larger team and things for the second game and so many

514
00:26:56,153 --> 00:26:58,014
more features and what not.

515
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:02,331
What do you think the result would have been if you kept at the same scale as Hard West?

516
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:06,073
Do you think, you know, the review scores and things like that would have been about the same?

517
00:27:06,073 --> 00:27:09,294
Like, was all that extra effort, you know, did it amount to something?

518
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:15,095
Okay, so given how many times I was so wrong guessing how a game will do,

519
00:27:15,095 --> 00:27:19,476
I'm not talking only our games, but like all the games in general,

520
00:27:20,777 --> 00:27:21,777
I have no fucking clue.

521
00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:26,018
Could be perfect, could be next to nothing, no idea.

522
00:27:26,018 --> 00:27:27,679
But there's, like, once we're here,

523
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,140
like, given that we're at this topic,

524
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,781
so there's one thing that we could have done,

525
00:27:33,781 --> 00:27:37,682
like, mid-production to avoid many of the issues

526
00:27:37,682 --> 00:27:41,123
because we didn't adapt for the pace

527
00:27:41,123 --> 00:27:43,284
at which we were able to hire people.

528
00:27:44,064 --> 00:27:50,931
and that was one of the biggest problems in the development.

529
00:27:50,931 --> 00:27:53,573
We needed to develop the game,

530
00:27:53,573 --> 00:27:55,996
but we didn't have the whole team yet.

531
00:27:55,996 --> 00:27:57,037
So for future games, if you made a game

532
00:27:57,037 --> 00:27:58,138
in a similar genre again,

533
00:27:58,138 --> 00:28:00,680
would you do a similar sort of thing,

534
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,624
like go in the full sort of XCOM route?

535
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:12,801
In our new studio that is super cool, what we do is we...

536
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:14,202
The scope can 100% be delivered

537
00:28:14,202 --> 00:28:15,805
by the team we have right now.

538
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,561
And if we get more, then we use the expansions

539
00:28:19,561 --> 00:28:22,422
that I talked about, and we can always do more.

540
00:28:22,422 --> 00:28:26,403
But we definitely can deliver what we have,

541
00:28:26,403 --> 00:28:30,105
and what we have, what the plan is, with who's on board.

542
00:28:30,105 --> 00:28:32,365
Right, okay, and with your new game,

543
00:28:32,365 --> 00:28:36,147
are you planning the gameplay first, or the theme first?

544
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,287
You doing what you mentioned?

545
00:28:37,287 --> 00:28:39,628
Well, we usually do this at the same time.

546
00:28:39,628 --> 00:28:42,029
So it's a gameplay plus theme,

547
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:44,310
and it has to work together really well.

548
00:28:46,135 --> 00:28:46,455
Awesome.

549
00:28:46,455 --> 00:28:48,256
Question?

550
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:51,018
Yeah, it's actually related to that last question you just

551
00:28:51,018 --> 00:28:53,719
asked, which is when you're starting a game, you made a

552
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:56,680
really good point, which was when you prototype, don't put

553
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,782
art in it, because that will trick you.

554
00:28:59,782 --> 00:29:00,562
Just do the gameplay.

555
00:29:00,562 --> 00:29:04,064
But can you talk about how you develop a game from the

556
00:29:04,064 --> 00:29:04,384
ground up?

557
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:07,005
Like if a theme is a big part of your idea, origination for

558
00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:10,367
a game, do you do art tests in parallel with gameplay

559
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:12,828
prototypes, or how does that process come together in the

560
00:29:12,828 --> 00:29:13,608
beginning?

561
00:29:13,608 --> 00:29:14,028
So.

562
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:17,710
Should I repeat the question?

563
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,610
No, it's recorded if it's all right.

564
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:24,792
So the process more or less goes like this.

565
00:29:24,792 --> 00:29:28,773
First, in general, I really don't

566
00:29:28,773 --> 00:29:31,153
like waiting for ideas to happen.

567
00:29:31,153 --> 00:29:32,934
So I usually steal ideas.

568
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:34,314
I refactor ideas.

569
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,855
I reuse ideas.

570
00:29:35,855 --> 00:29:37,835
And maybe no one will notice, whatever.

571
00:29:37,835 --> 00:29:41,916
But I try not to wait for ideas, apart from game ideas,

572
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:42,356
where.

573
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:47,858
I just look for, or actually wait for ideas to come

574
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:54,639
for pairs of gameplay, like base gameplay mechanic

575
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:55,039
and theme.

576
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,920
That was the case with Hardwest,

577
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,421
where the theme works really well with this gameplay

578
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:04,341
because, you know, it's kind of empty,

579
00:30:04,341 --> 00:30:06,902
like the towns are small and it makes sense.

580
00:30:06,902 --> 00:30:08,342
There's not many people around,

581
00:30:08,342 --> 00:30:10,403
the buildings are low, and so on, so on, so on.

582
00:30:10,403 --> 00:30:12,423
And the combat is slow-paced as well.

583
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:14,731
So that's like step number one.

584
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:20,352
And then we sort of note down all the possible ideas we might have.

585
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:24,514
A lot of them are stolen, obviously, from games, from movies,

586
00:30:24,514 --> 00:30:29,296
and we make a huge fucking list of stuff that we could possibly have in the game.

587
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:34,799
And the rule of thumb is we try to get it all in, in some way.

588
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,780
Like, for example,

589
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:43,483
for Hard West, we wanted to have some, you know, poker cards in the game.

590
00:30:43,483 --> 00:30:45,063
But obviously...

591
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:47,884
The most obvious idea would be to put in a minigame,

592
00:30:47,884 --> 00:30:49,444
which would be super fucking expensive,

593
00:30:49,444 --> 00:30:52,985
and why would we do that in a turn-based tactical game?

594
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:56,206
So we used the cards to represent character abilities

595
00:30:56,206 --> 00:30:57,486
in character development system.

596
00:30:57,486 --> 00:30:59,747
And it works pretty well.

597
00:30:59,747 --> 00:31:02,008
So that's the process, more or less.

598
00:31:02,008 --> 00:31:02,788
Cool, thanks.

599
00:31:02,788 --> 00:31:04,848
All right, last question?

600
00:31:04,848 --> 00:31:05,628
Oh, yeah.

601
00:31:06,372 --> 00:31:09,514
So in your presentation, it seems like trying to identify

602
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:14,758
the problems and gather solutions you think might fit.

603
00:31:14,758 --> 00:31:17,500
And it turns like it's become better.

604
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,963
So what if you are carrying the current experience and

605
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:23,485
transfer yourself back to the past?

606
00:31:23,485 --> 00:31:26,728
So basically, are you going to do the same thing faster?

607
00:31:26,728 --> 00:31:28,969
Or is there something else you want to do?

608
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:33,513
So I definitely would like to come back to the

609
00:31:33,513 --> 00:31:34,574
genre at some point.

610
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,651
But there's so many games I would like to make.

611
00:31:38,651 --> 00:31:47,317
But the thing is, I always try to do a really solid

612
00:31:47,317 --> 00:31:50,820
post-mortem that is super critical and super negative.

613
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:55,603
Because I believe that either you succeed or you learn.

614
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:59,205
And there's a lot of learning here.

615
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:01,627
So it's kind of unrelated to our future plans.

616
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:08,421
Alright, thanks so much everyone. Make sure you fill out your email survey forms to let Casper know what you thought.

617
00:32:08,421 --> 00:32:10,925
Only if you liked it. Thank you so much, Casper.
