1
00:00:05,674 --> 00:00:07,556
So, uh, I hope you've all had a good lunch,

2
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,298
cause I'm gonna give you some animation pudding.

3
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:12,501
Right, so...

4
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:13,663
Hey, first joke of the day.

5
00:00:15,364 --> 00:00:16,125
Okay, is this working?

6
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:19,800
Okay, so I want to give you a little bit of background on who I am.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,042
Started in the industry about 14 years ago.

8
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,585
Worked on a bunch of games.

9
00:00:25,365 --> 00:00:27,607
Some, probably a lot of them, you won't know.

10
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:30,650
Punctuated by Assassin's Creed in 2005.

11
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:32,572
Moved back to England.

12
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:36,015
Worked on another couple of games that you might or might not know.

13
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:41,140
and then ended up moving back to Canada,

14
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:46,285
working at Ubisoft Toronto to be the animation director on Splinter Cell Blacklist.

15
00:00:47,306 --> 00:00:48,507
Gratuitous baby picture there.

16
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:50,529
Okay, so...

17
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,014
I want to give you a brief overview of what I'm going to talk about today.

18
00:00:56,732 --> 00:01:01,135
So I'm going to start with the evolution of the animation on Blacklist, giving you some

19
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:02,936
context into some of the decisions that we made.

20
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:08,740
Then I want to talk a little about the involvement of our tactical coordinator and where he helped

21
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,063
us out, which will lead me into an overview of some of the methods we used and some of

22
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:13,484
the tools.

23
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:20,148
From there I want to talk about the concepts that we had of everything in motion and how

24
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:21,589
that defines some of Sam's movements.

25
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:27,324
which should help define and develop our animation contrast system

26
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:30,687
and how that helped with player choice

27
00:01:31,388 --> 00:01:38,255
and then you can't talk about Splinter Cell without talking about the AI, so I'll go into some of the things that we did there.

28
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:41,879
Okay, right, so...

29
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:44,817
This is the sixth game in the Splinter Cell franchise.

30
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:48,201
It was already established, but even though that was the case,

31
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:52,045
we still had to go ahead and define what we were going to do for Blacklist.

32
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:56,950
And this is the first game out of Ubisoft Toronto, and they wanted to prove something.

33
00:01:57,711 --> 00:01:59,553
So we wanted to make a strong first impression to headquarters.

34
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:03,677
So what I'm going to do is I want to show you,

35
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:06,798
give you some context into where we started from.

36
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,800
This is the common video that has only ever been seen

37
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,801
internally at Ubisoft.

38
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:15,842
And it's one of the ways that Ubisoft

39
00:02:16,022 --> 00:02:17,103
will green light a project.

40
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:20,504
Now with Ubisoft Toronto being a brand new studio,

41
00:02:21,084 --> 00:02:22,825
we didn't want to just create a pre-rendered footage.

42
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:25,066
We decided to go and create a playable demo

43
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,347
using the previous Splinter Cell as a base.

44
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,148
So I'm just going to go ahead and show that.

45
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:47,237
Okay, so I...

46
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:51,186
That was a pretty good technical achievement.

47
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:54,088
Basically, from a bunch of people that

48
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,110
hadn't really worked together, we

49
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,291
managed to get a playable demo up and running.

50
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:01,853
And headquarters passed us to go to the next stage.

51
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:05,996
But the thing is, we didn't feel like it was a Splinter Cell

52
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,536
we wanted to make.

53
00:04:06,616 --> 00:04:07,777
It wasn't hitting the right tone.

54
00:04:08,638 --> 00:04:12,080
We wanted to return Splinter Cell to its stealth roots

55
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,102
and think more kind of Hurt Locker than Mission Impossible.

56
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:16,763
So we wanted to take some of the action out of that.

57
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:21,905
The studio supported us wholeheartedly, but with that came a new animation mandate.

58
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:27,406
So there was renewed focus on the fluidity of animation.

59
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:32,068
We wanted to blur the lines between the systems as much as possible, making the gameplay as

60
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:32,908
responsive as possible.

61
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:39,550
Of course, as I said, we wanted to return the game to its stealth roots and really focus

62
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,810
on that.

63
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:45,824
Splinter Cell has always been known for its systemic gameplay as well, so player choice was going to be a huge thing, and then

64
00:04:46,164 --> 00:04:50,007
we knew that there was going to be a lot of animation that it was going to have to support.

65
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:53,289
But ultimately, at its core, Splinter Cell is about manipulating the AI.

66
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,433
And the team wanted to excel in Blacklist and push this further than any other Splinter Cell had done before.

67
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:03,196
And all those behaviors were going to need an absolute ton of animation support as well.

68
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:09,850
Okay, so this was my first time as the animation director on Splinter Cell.

69
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,251
So I wanted to define a couple of key pillars that I could help with the team.

70
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:17,273
So I defined that as basically as Panther and Realism.

71
00:05:18,813 --> 00:05:21,194
I find it useful sometimes to connect a character to an animal.

72
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:28,396
And the meaning behind Panther was to make Sam, was to make Blacklist Sam as fluid as possible, kind of very cat-like.

73
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:32,038
This was an idea that was used in Conviction, but I just wanted to take it one step further.

74
00:05:33,118 --> 00:05:38,943
And with realism, I wanted to make sure that the world was aware of everything and vice versa.

75
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:46,068
You know, grounding the player and each other to like tactile moments and some cool stuff like that.

76
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:47,889
I split these pillars into three parts.

77
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:51,692
The first one, being proud.

78
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:57,156
I wanted to take the concept of the Panther through to navigation and giving Sam intent in all his moves.

79
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:02,222
You know, like kind of a hunter, like stalking its prey, that sort of thing.

80
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,983
So there's a very kind of cat-like theme there.

81
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:06,885
I use cat references a lot, by the way.

82
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:09,447
Making sure that all the moves flow together.

83
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:14,171
Surgical strike. Now this would refer to Sam's combat style.

84
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:19,695
I wanted all his moves to have precision, and I wanted everything to have a reason.

85
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:22,618
You know, I didn't want to just have random strikes and just wasteful stuff.

86
00:06:22,658 --> 00:06:26,921
I wanted everything to, you know, like if you hit someone in the stomach, I wanted them to go down so you could actually do something with it.

87
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,523
And the last one was response.

88
00:06:29,863 --> 00:06:33,246
And response was important because with all these potential animation improvements and

89
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:37,629
like slinky animation that I wanted to do, it didn't matter if it didn't respond.

90
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:42,232
It's like when you push the input, you want that to feel good and you want it to feel

91
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:43,273
like you're Sam Fisher.

92
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:44,794
That's going to really embody the pamper.

93
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:45,875
Okay?

94
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:49,697
And with realism, it was about Sam and the enemies having an awareness of the world around

95
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:50,138
them, as I said.

96
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:57,661
I wanted everything to feel very tactile. I think I'd just seen Children of Man and there was lots of like touching the walls and all this sort of stuff.

97
00:06:58,082 --> 00:07:00,764
And I was obsessed with like grounding the character to that.

98
00:07:01,826 --> 00:07:06,470
You know, it's like I wanted the AI to communicate visually. I didn't just want them to have audio barks.

99
00:07:07,531 --> 00:07:13,298
I wanted them to actually be signalling to each other. Whether the player was going to see that, I didn't really care. It was more of I just wanted them to be communicating.

100
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,601
And with all that awareness, it wouldn't be much fun if everything wasn't reactive.

101
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:24,202
So Sam and the AI would need to be visually reacting different to each other.

102
00:07:24,502 --> 00:07:28,003
You know, I wanted people to react to explosions, I wanted to be able to fire a gun in the air,

103
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:29,724
and then, you know, that would actually cause chaos.

104
00:07:30,924 --> 00:07:34,285
And some of these subtle responses were going to be the fun in how we played.

105
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:40,686
Mood videos were created to support all those sub-pillars.

106
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:47,348
But what I wanted to do is to show the team a concept of all

107
00:07:47,388 --> 00:07:48,669
those pillars together.

108
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:52,530
So we didn't have the time or the resources to create, again,

109
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,871
a fully rendered video to show anything.

110
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:57,512
So I was given two days to basically create this

111
00:07:57,532 --> 00:07:57,973
from scratch.

112
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,660
So I'm going to show you this.

113
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,061
This is the first concept for Blacklist that I created.

114
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:07,382
And it's to try and show some of the things I've

115
00:08:07,402 --> 00:08:09,222
been talking about where when he was coming out from cover,

116
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:10,343
he was touching the wall.

117
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:13,023
He was going up behind someone, taking them down with a knife

118
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:13,984
and using the gun.

119
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:16,404
And also, I wanted to keep everything nice and fluid.

120
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:19,185
So I wanted all the transitions to be nice and smooth.

121
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:23,266
So you can see Sam nice and efficiently taking out

122
00:08:23,766 --> 00:08:24,467
a bunch of guys there.

123
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,571
Okay, so the good thing about that is the team was on board with where I wanted to go,

124
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,492
so they wanted to see where I went next.

125
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:40,212
The thing is, is gameplay needed to try and cast their own Sam Fisher.

126
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:42,153
We needed reference for ourself as well.

127
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:47,714
And I'm a huge believer in gathering as much real world knowledge and reference as possible.

128
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:53,315
I was really keen on finding someone that embodied our Sam Fisher, but the problem is

129
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:55,275
where do you find the world's most elite spy?

130
00:08:57,398 --> 00:08:58,438
Turns out he lives in Montreal.

131
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:01,839
This is Kevin Secor.

132
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:05,300
He was introduced to me by one of our designers, James Everett.

133
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,000
And he'd been training with him when he was living in Montreal.

134
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,901
And he was like, hey, you should probably go and speak to this guy.

135
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:12,861
He's got some of the things that you're talking about.

136
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:18,743
And as you can see from Kevin's CV, he's definitely got a lot of combat experience.

137
00:09:19,243 --> 00:09:21,443
But I wasn't quite sure whether he was going to fit the bill.

138
00:09:21,623 --> 00:09:22,343
So I sent him an email.

139
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:24,100
and uh...

140
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:26,602
i had no idea what i was getting myself into

141
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,986
so this is the video, well part of the video that kevin sent me back

142
00:09:31,726 --> 00:09:33,308
uh... and as you can see uh...

143
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:37,111
it proves to me that he's got a very interesting way of moving

144
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:40,214
uh... this guy to me is the real deal

145
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:41,855
he's not

146
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:44,918
someone playing at things he's never done a mocap shoot before

147
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:48,401
uh... and he kind of lives this

148
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:53,441
So this is like loads of footage from him just beating people up in his dojo.

149
00:09:54,442 --> 00:09:54,723
For me.

150
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:57,888
So yeah.

151
00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:01,273
Anyway, so I was convinced. I had to meet him.

152
00:10:01,914 --> 00:10:04,378
He sent me an email. I went to meet him in Montreal.

153
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,122
And, you know, it turns out he's a huge Splinter Cell fan, so we were kind of like, sending emails back and forth

154
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:16,125
Quite a lot with redacted lines in there that people can't see

155
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:19,527
So, but then, the cool thing is, is

156
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,689
Every time I sent him an email, he's actually an instructor as well

157
00:10:23,109 --> 00:10:25,811
So he would always send me back a little video

158
00:10:26,532 --> 00:10:30,353
So his students must absolutely hate me now.

159
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:33,435
But you can see a bunch of stuff on here.

160
00:10:33,475 --> 00:10:35,396
You've got like, I think, the bottom right-hand corner.

161
00:10:35,756 --> 00:10:38,377
He was talking about how to beat someone up with a shield.

162
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:39,778
And then he's...

163
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:42,279
There's lots of weird stuff on there.

164
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:44,140
There's basically...

165
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,481
Every time I asked him something, he'd send me back one of these.

166
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:48,802
So he's pretty...

167
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:51,823
He's starting to prove to be a huge inspiration to the team.

168
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:55,084
not only for me, but to design as well.

169
00:10:55,144 --> 00:10:57,465
So this was going to be a great find for us.

170
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:01,366
But I'd mentioned briefly to Kevin

171
00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:02,666
that we wanted to bring back the knife

172
00:11:03,027 --> 00:11:04,027
from previous splinter cells.

173
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,408
In previous splinter cells, they'd

174
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:08,168
used just a normal straight edge blade,

175
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,249
but I wanted to create something a little bit more iconic.

176
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:13,330
So I mentioned to him that I was looking for this.

177
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,090
Kevin's eyes just kind of lit up.

178
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,051
And he was just like, oh, I've got something for you.

179
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:21,732
So he took me to one side, and he basically

180
00:11:21,772 --> 00:11:22,172
pulled out.

181
00:11:23,672 --> 00:11:24,192
the karambit

182
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,994
uh... this ended up being kind of like an epiphany moment for me

183
00:11:28,894 --> 00:11:31,055
uh... it's like the karambit is more of a tool

184
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:33,197
it's more of a curved edge blade

185
00:11:33,617 --> 00:11:36,558
and it can be used for kind of ripping, pulling, tearing, rending

186
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:39,940
that sort of thing and you could actually be used to pull people into cover

187
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,102
which is really cool and the thing is when I went to his dojo he created this

188
00:11:43,562 --> 00:11:44,843
uh... this chart on the side

189
00:11:45,263 --> 00:11:48,445
which would show you how you could suppress someone

190
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:50,606
which is really scary that he thought this deep into it

191
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:55,287
but he decided to just show me all these things.

192
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,649
And this was going to change exactly how

193
00:11:58,729 --> 00:11:59,809
we animated these moves.

194
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:02,050
And one of the moves that was there,

195
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,851
I will go into in a little bit more detail.

196
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:06,151
Oh, and bonus points.

197
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:09,172
The fact that I've been talking about the cat and everything

198
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,073
is its nickname is the panther's claw.

199
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:12,893
I was just saying, all right, that's pretty cool.

200
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:14,554
That works.

201
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,235
OK, oh, and that, there you go.

202
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:18,515
It connects to my first pillar, the surgical strike.

203
00:12:18,535 --> 00:12:19,716
There you go, connections.

204
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:20,236
It's good.

205
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:25,581
Okay, so with that I was really convinced that we'd found our Sam.

206
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:32,346
So much so that I sent a not-so-cryptic Facebook message to the team, which was very public

207
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:34,428
at the time, considering no one knew I was working on Splinter Cell.

208
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:36,870
That's fine!

209
00:12:37,731 --> 00:12:41,214
Didn't get into trouble for it, so it's okay.

210
00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:46,398
So we're Blacklist Massive Scope, and we have this mantra internally of the biggest Splinter

211
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:46,859
Cell to date.

212
00:12:47,677 --> 00:12:50,918
It would require a huge investment in our tools and our pipeline.

213
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:58,581
Now, small disclaimer, none of these tools and techniques are particularly magic bullet or groundbreaking.

214
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:04,264
It's more of the well-known to the industry. It's more of how we use them together that I feel is really powerful.

215
00:13:05,444 --> 00:13:08,525
And without them, many of the choices and decisions that we made wouldn't have been possible.

216
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:13,547
Okay, so I spoke with our creative director to see where his head was at.

217
00:13:15,435 --> 00:13:16,516
He basically said, more of everything.

218
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:17,997
I was like, great, fantastic.

219
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:19,598
The problem with more of everything

220
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:24,362
is something's gotta give, right?

221
00:13:24,843 --> 00:13:26,024
We knew that it was near impossible

222
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:27,745
to keep the massive scope, ship on time,

223
00:13:27,845 --> 00:13:29,146
and the quality level we're aiming for.

224
00:13:29,627 --> 00:13:31,448
Usually you have to focus on two of these choices.

225
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:34,211
I asked him which ones were more important to him.

226
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:36,533
All three, brilliant.

227
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,382
So this is Max throwing the gauntlet down.

228
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:41,703
It was fair enough.

229
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:42,843
It was early on in the project.

230
00:13:42,883 --> 00:13:44,184
He didn't see any need to cut anything.

231
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:46,365
And he was just like, just see what we can do.

232
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:48,686
So it was essential.

233
00:13:48,726 --> 00:13:51,548
But of course, it was essential that everything was done on

234
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:51,988
time.

235
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:53,529
We didn't want to compromise on quality.

236
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,991
And he wasn't really willing to get rid of the scope.

237
00:13:58,231 --> 00:13:58,951
So go.

238
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,678
Okay, so this is just a quick overview on some of the things that we wanted to add

239
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,881
from Conviction on Blacklist.

240
00:14:08,162 --> 00:14:10,065
I just want to give you some of the examples of the things that we're adding.

241
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:13,869
So, we were going to add a different movement speed.

242
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,293
I think Conviction had only had the two movement speeds.

243
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,215
We were going to add a jog in the middle,

244
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:22,098
and we wanted to make the run a lot faster.

245
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:28,330
But also, we felt strongly that we wanted to have like a lethal and non-lethal option.

246
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:34,813
Really kind of playing into player choice. We didn't know what we were going to do with it at the time, but we knew we wanted to have it.

247
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:39,934
Also there was a bunch of new abilities. I don't know how well you can see on there, but there's things like there was

248
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:45,837
ladder climbing, ledge jumping and some of these things. Some made it in the game, some didn't.

249
00:14:48,202 --> 00:14:52,823
Also, we wanted to really focus on how crouch navigation was working as well, because we

250
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:54,664
knew that players were going to be using that a lot.

251
00:14:56,404 --> 00:14:59,125
And finally, there was a bunch of new AI archetypes that we were going to add.

252
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:03,126
So all of this was going to need animation support, and this was all on top of things

253
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:03,806
that were already there.

254
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:10,348
Okay, so just to give you a quick idea, Conviction's animation budget was about 40 meg.

255
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,551
So I don't know how much that means to anyone,

256
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,272
but that's a decent amount.

257
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:16,774
You can normally get quite a lot done with that.

258
00:15:16,854 --> 00:15:17,614
So I was like, great.

259
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:20,036
Considering the scope, if we get that for Blacklist,

260
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:21,978
then we'll be fine.

261
00:15:22,098 --> 00:15:22,839
But we got 23.

262
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,721
So how are we going to do that?

263
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:32,887
OK, so what I wanted to do is I knew that we needed mocap.

264
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,752
just due to the sheer amount of animation we're going to need.

265
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:39,714
We knew that we were going to invest in a solid MoCAP pipeline.

266
00:15:40,534 --> 00:15:43,436
MoCAP would allow us to keep as much of the integrity of Kevin's moves

267
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:43,916
as possible.

268
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:46,718
And when it wouldn't be possible to MoCAP,

269
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,899
we'd need strong animators to help prototype systems.

270
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:54,182
Because MoCAP wasn't always going to be the solution.

271
00:15:54,302 --> 00:15:56,563
Sometimes they need to animate some of the more difficult systems,

272
00:15:56,603 --> 00:15:58,664
some of the things that we didn't want to go to MoCAP with that we

273
00:15:58,704 --> 00:15:59,985
might end up getting sued over.

274
00:16:01,606 --> 00:16:01,846
Also.

275
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:04,549
I knew we'd need to improve the animation tools.

276
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:09,890
The tools were already existing and were functional for all the previous games.

277
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,751
But we knew that to reach the level of quality and to do everything on time

278
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,732
and just to get everything in, we knew we were going to have to work on

279
00:16:17,772 --> 00:16:21,633
increased animator control so animators could play around with things and really try and experiment.

280
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:25,314
And we also knew we were going to have to somehow find massive memory savings.

281
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,255
uh... okay and of course the scope didn't just apply to the animation team

282
00:16:29,275 --> 00:16:30,577
is every team had this mandate

283
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,142
so every team we're gonna have to add more so

284
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:35,386
they all have to go through the same sort of problems

285
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:44,548
Okay, at Ubisoft we were really lucky that headquarters saw to invest in us as like a

286
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:46,808
center for performance capture.

287
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:51,189
We actually asked for like a smaller system, but then Montreal was getting so booked up

288
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:54,490
with all their mocap shoots that they said, well, we'll just build you a studio.

289
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,151
I mean, that's great, but we didn't want to waste it.

290
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:03,434
I mean, gameplay shoots for me have different objectives from cinematics.

291
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:08,597
The focus shifts between the aesthetic, how it might feel to play, and the technical constraints

292
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:09,177
that are involved.

293
00:17:10,118 --> 00:17:12,719
Our moves need to look good from all angles at all times.

294
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,602
So what I like to do is I like to focus, I don't like to have too many people on set.

295
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:22,745
But basically, for me to run a gameplay shoot, I like to keep things nice and simple.

296
00:17:22,785 --> 00:17:26,628
So over the past 14 years, there's been some simple guidelines that I like to follow.

297
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:32,704
Okay, as I said, I like to limit the number of people on set at one time.

298
00:17:33,604 --> 00:17:36,806
I find that if a set is too busy, you get distracted.

299
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:39,368
Keeping the numbers down helps keep everyone focused.

300
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:40,909
Everyone knows their role.

301
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,750
Usually, that would mean myself directing.

302
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:46,433
We'd have our team lead basically keeping hold of the Excel sheet

303
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:47,534
and making sure that we got all the shots.

304
00:17:47,614 --> 00:17:50,396
And she would always offer a really valuable second opinion.

305
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:56,644
Of course, you've got the actors, usually two, and we'd usually invite one or two animators

306
00:17:56,684 --> 00:18:00,009
onto the stage as well, just if they were going to be working with those moves, just

307
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:03,113
so they could understand where the intention and everything was coming from.

308
00:18:03,313 --> 00:18:06,378
Because if we just gave them the moves, then they might lose some of the aesthetic.

309
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:12,051
It seems obvious, but everyone on set needs to know who's directing.

310
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:15,474
And you know, I like to be the alpha.

311
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,476
So it's like, I'll be on set.

312
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:18,757
The actors need to know as well.

313
00:18:19,157 --> 00:18:20,258
It helps keep the vision clear.

314
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:25,042
They know that they can go to you if they have any issues.

315
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:28,545
And you know, you don't really want people kind of chiming in with opinions all the time

316
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:30,126
because again, things get really confusing.

317
00:18:30,206 --> 00:18:32,348
So it's always good to kind of filter things through one person.

318
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,788
Something I found that worked really, really well with Kevin was collaboration.

319
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:43,581
To me that's the key to success with working with mocap, especially for gameplay shoots,

320
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:48,245
is I like to work with goals in mind, not necessarily a direction.

321
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:53,010
Sometimes I'll have a very, very clear idea of what I want and then work with that, but

322
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:59,436
more often than not, if I have a goal like, okay, you start here, you end there, do something

323
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:04,321
in the middle, and make it look badass, then Kevin more often than not came up with something

324
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:04,701
that worked.

325
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:10,587
Okay, with that said, you need to be respectful of your talent.

326
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:19,836
I mean, there's no point in having your actors working on crouch moves all morning where

327
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:22,418
it's going to kill their legs and then you go, oh yeah, by the way, in the afternoon

328
00:19:22,438 --> 00:19:23,439
we're going to have you beat someone up.

329
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,100
Then that's not going to work.

330
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,263
It's going to, unless you want them to look tired when they do it, then it's not going

331
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:28,463
to work.

332
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:32,903
to me if a particular move is giving you trouble

333
00:19:33,603 --> 00:19:34,203
uh... move it around

334
00:19:34,704 --> 00:19:35,704
you know move on to the next one

335
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:39,927
uh... it's it's it's going to get your actors frustrated it's going to get the people on

336
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:40,748
set frustrated

337
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:43,790
is that you can always come back to it later and that you never know it's like

338
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,712
you know it's like it's like almost like you're sleeping on it

339
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,213
you'll have a better idea of what you want to do

340
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:49,794
And personally, I like to go to MoCap

341
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:53,095
with an almost impossible list of moves that I'm looking for.

342
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,735
So if I manage to capture everything I need,

343
00:19:56,435 --> 00:19:58,496
I let the actors kind of play with some of the things

344
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:00,676
I need to do in the afternoon.

345
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:04,437
And we actually got some really cool stuff from that as well,

346
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,937
and some ideas that may end up just ending in the game

347
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:08,037
that you didn't actually think of.

348
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:12,638
OK, so this stage became our playground,

349
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,639
with Kevin becoming kind of the one constant on set.

350
00:20:17,597 --> 00:20:22,482
But we found to get the most out of Kevin, we had to employ a stunt guy that would work.

351
00:20:22,802 --> 00:20:26,046
Originally we had Kevin come in with one of his guys from the dojo, but the problem is

352
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:31,070
he knew Kevin so well that he was anticipating everything and wouldn't show any pain, so

353
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,052
he just, the data looked terrible.

354
00:20:33,152 --> 00:20:35,415
So we got a guy in that had no idea who Kevin was.

355
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:39,198
That was a very interesting first meeting.

356
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:42,281
Especially considering Kevin's never been on set before.

357
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:44,364
He doesn't know what half speed is.

358
00:20:44,864 --> 00:20:46,846
Kevin just goes, boom, that's it.

359
00:20:47,427 --> 00:20:51,211
So if these guys didn't know how to take a hit, then we could have been in trouble.

360
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:55,695
So I want to show you a quick kind of compilation of one of the shoots that we did.

361
00:21:50,078 --> 00:21:51,099
So that's Kevin Sikor.

362
00:21:53,984 --> 00:21:56,487
I had to deal with that guy every day for three years.

363
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,316
Anyway, so the cool thing is we're

364
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:03,538
starting to get into the meat of things now.

365
00:22:05,215 --> 00:22:07,698
We get this data, what do we do with it?

366
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,903
Now the thing is with Kevin, again with it being the first time him being on set

367
00:22:13,044 --> 00:22:15,066
he didn't really know how to sell an action

368
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:17,369
he didn't really know what it was going to look like in game

369
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,474
so as you can see on the left, it's the raw mocap, it looks pretty cool

370
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,977
you can see what's going on, I think it's like a kidney attack or something

371
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:26,422
But on the right is what we did to it.

372
00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:30,488
And you can see that we've kind of accentuated

373
00:22:30,508 --> 00:22:31,229
some of the lines.

374
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:33,032
We've made things a little bit more aggressive.

375
00:22:33,072 --> 00:22:34,073
We've cleaned up the feet.

376
00:22:34,574 --> 00:22:36,116
We've made things look a little bit,

377
00:22:36,136 --> 00:22:37,378
they've got a lot more impact.

378
00:22:37,618 --> 00:22:39,721
I mean, we keep everything on the move as well.

379
00:22:40,983 --> 00:22:44,544
And this was kind of typical to what we do to some of the animations.

380
00:22:44,884 --> 00:22:51,647
The thing is, is this particular move is Kevin did it at such a speed that we hardly have to do anything to it except to just accentuate it.

381
00:22:52,187 --> 00:22:53,367
So the timing was there.

382
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:55,148
So again, it's kind of crazy.

383
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:02,790
So I'm going to give you kind of a breakdown on one of the particular moves that we decided to add for Blacklist.

384
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,031
We called them abductions.

385
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:09,913
They were seen as cover takedowns, and they fitted really, really well with the stealth roots of Splinter Cell.

386
00:23:13,578 --> 00:23:15,880
So some of the choices we made for abductions

387
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:20,142
were we wanted to be able to pull people into cover

388
00:23:20,162 --> 00:23:22,084
or dispatch them really quickly, hide when

389
00:23:22,104 --> 00:23:23,945
they were in cover as well.

390
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:27,787
So here is the raw data from one of the moves.

391
00:23:33,198 --> 00:23:35,859
And it's pretty cool, but the thing is, is we can't put that in game.

392
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:38,400
I mean, what we could, we, what we do is we actually, we do put that in game,

393
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,501
but then we feel how slow it is and how it slows down the gameplay and it doesn't really work.

394
00:23:43,182 --> 00:23:45,102
Um, to me it lacks a bit of impact as well.

395
00:23:45,142 --> 00:23:47,223
I mean, Kevin was good, but he couldn't get

396
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:49,444
that, the sort of impact that we needed,

397
00:23:49,464 --> 00:23:52,845
because otherwise he would have just, we would have gone through stunt guys like Candy.

398
00:23:53,846 --> 00:23:56,947
Um, see to me there's some broken contacts in there as well.

399
00:23:57,007 --> 00:23:58,548
The hands don't connect properly.

400
00:23:58,888 --> 00:23:59,828
Messy foot positions.

401
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:02,049
It's a little bit too slow, and I knew I wanted to amp it up.

402
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:09,619
So then we give it to an animator, and then we usually, after about a week, they come

403
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:10,520
back with this.

404
00:24:11,161 --> 00:24:16,448
Again, there's some more aggression on there, it's like really smashing the head down, you

405
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:19,491
know, pulling him into cover with a lot more aggression, dropping the weapon.

406
00:24:20,853 --> 00:24:22,054
So this was starting to work.

407
00:24:23,117 --> 00:24:27,081
So what we'd also do is we'd fix shoulder and neck positions because we find that usually

408
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:31,564
from mocap is the shoulders would always be really high or the necks would be forward.

409
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:36,488
And also we wanted the move to kind of fit within five seconds at the maximum and even

410
00:24:36,528 --> 00:24:37,149
that was pushing it.

411
00:24:39,148 --> 00:24:41,830
So once we did that, we'd add one extra layer.

412
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,631
And one of the things I really wanted to do

413
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:48,172
is I wanted Sam to be aware of everyone all the time.

414
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:51,133
So now all the animators had gone through and animated

415
00:24:51,153 --> 00:24:52,554
this really cool animation.

416
00:24:52,614 --> 00:24:53,754
I decided I didn't want to show it.

417
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:59,057
So we animated the cameras to focus on other things.

418
00:24:59,637 --> 00:25:01,738
So you could have all this animation in the background,

419
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:03,478
but then the camera would be looking somewhere else.

420
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:10,054
So that also connected to our surgical strike response and awareness.

421
00:25:11,034 --> 00:25:13,195
So again, I'm connecting everything back round, this is really cool.

422
00:25:21,397 --> 00:25:24,157
So as you can see, it's like, well if you can see because it's quite dark,

423
00:25:24,717 --> 00:25:27,358
you've got a guy passing in the background, you've got all the animation happening.

424
00:25:27,918 --> 00:25:28,938
The thing is, is the camera...

425
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:33,714
control could be interrupted at any point. So that was where the animator work would

426
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:39,819
be seen. This kind of idea stuck with something we called One Step Ahead. So we wanted Sam

427
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:44,303
to always be looking at his next target. Once he had something in his hands, then that was

428
00:25:44,363 --> 00:25:48,787
it, he was over. And this was actually something that came from Kevin. Kevin never really looked

429
00:25:48,827 --> 00:25:50,748
at what he was doing, he was always looking at the next thing.

430
00:25:53,148 --> 00:25:56,711
So this would take the animator about a week and I think that by the time towards the end of the project

431
00:25:56,971 --> 00:25:59,253
they managed to be able to do one of these in about a day.

432
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:04,657
Okay, so one of the other things that we did is we add this thing that we called

433
00:26:04,677 --> 00:26:05,698
the variety node.

434
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:09,554
And it would basically allow us to create non-standardized loops.

435
00:26:10,514 --> 00:26:12,375
It was like one big long sequence of animation

436
00:26:12,756 --> 00:26:14,077
that we could use as a base

437
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:16,698
and it meant that Sam could

438
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:19,840
be here, this was in one of the levels in London

439
00:26:20,281 --> 00:26:21,281
where he was poisoned.

440
00:26:21,602 --> 00:26:23,023
So, spoilers if you haven't played the game.

441
00:26:24,484 --> 00:26:27,245
And we wanted him to stagger around, I had all these ideas for him kind of

442
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:29,207
leaning against walls and vomiting and

443
00:26:29,727 --> 00:26:31,728
you know, I really wanted him to throw up

444
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:32,489
for some reason.

445
00:26:34,147 --> 00:26:36,488
So yeah, so this was only possible with a variety.

446
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:38,749
But the cool thing about this is that

447
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:40,830
would be used over an existing set of animation.

448
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,111
So we could just have our base movement set

449
00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:46,032
and just replace like six or seven animations.

450
00:26:47,412 --> 00:26:50,053
And all we'd have to do is mark them up as A, B, C, D, et

451
00:26:50,094 --> 00:26:50,694
cetera, et cetera.

452
00:26:50,854 --> 00:26:53,455
And then the engine would see them and then play them

453
00:26:53,475 --> 00:26:53,915
in sequence.

454
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:55,936
It also meant that if we were clever,

455
00:26:55,976 --> 00:26:57,236
we could play around with that sequence

456
00:26:57,256 --> 00:27:00,918
and create like any number of random-ish sequences.

457
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:07,684
Okay, replacements was also another thing for us as well.

458
00:27:07,964 --> 00:27:09,767
This scene from the very, very beginning of the game

459
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:13,212
was actually just replacing a couple of animations

460
00:27:13,413 --> 00:27:18,039
from Sam's base walk set with no weapon in his hand.

461
00:27:19,091 --> 00:27:23,155
uh... and it meant that all we had to do was again create a few animations and

462
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:24,036
we got the rest for free

463
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:25,097
uh...

464
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:28,641
uh... the design team really wanted to show sam kind of gradually

465
00:27:29,121 --> 00:27:29,882
getting better

466
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:30,803
as he was walking

467
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,886
you know so we wanted to show him really injured at the beginning and originally this was

468
00:27:33,907 --> 00:27:36,730
really like oh my god it's going to be like a massive animation set and we can't do it

469
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,511
uh... and we managed to do this

470
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:44,540
Cool little story with this is, this is me in a mocap suit, is I got injured the day before

471
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:50,921
and I think I tore my calf muscle and I quickly ran into the mo- well, not quickly, I got into the mocap,

472
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:54,282
I got into the mocap suit and then I was like, well, let's go and get it.

473
00:27:54,402 --> 00:27:59,183
So then this came back and that's actually, for all posterity, is me injured.

474
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:01,063
So there you go.

475
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,864
So I was the very first actor to play Sam Fisher in Splinter Cell Blacklist.

476
00:28:04,964 --> 00:28:05,244
Fact.

477
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:08,665
Okay.

478
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:14,677
So everything was going great, and then Mike Wazuliski, our lead gay programmer,

479
00:28:15,078 --> 00:28:18,600
and that's a Movember picture, by the way,

480
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,101
came up to me and said, OK, we need to talk.

481
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:22,828
We're running out of space.

482
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:26,431
I'm like, oh, okay, alright, fine.

483
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:29,232
He basically threatened to start cutting things.

484
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:33,555
He's like, we've got a budget and you're not sticking with it,

485
00:28:33,575 --> 00:28:35,656
you're just adding stuff and yeah, it looks great and everything,

486
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,697
but we're not going to be able to ship like this.

487
00:28:39,098 --> 00:28:40,799
So, they were all the words I needed,

488
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,021
and he was basically saying that I couldn't have all my toys,

489
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:46,203
and basically it was like, if you wanted your toys back,

490
00:28:46,243 --> 00:28:47,443
you had to tidy your room.

491
00:28:49,273 --> 00:28:54,441
So, this was basically an overview of where the animation budget was.

492
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:56,123
I think it was like August 2012.

493
00:28:56,243 --> 00:29:01,111
We had a budget of 23 and before I'd added a load of other stuff we were already at 34.

494
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:05,337
So we knew we were going to have to find savings somewhere.

495
00:29:08,328 --> 00:29:11,549
So we worked in this tech, basically animation bundles.

496
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,550
Again, this isn't any secret to the industry,

497
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,890
but they were essential to how we used animation in Blacklist.

498
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,351
Up until this point, all animation

499
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:19,611
had been loaded into memory at once.

500
00:29:20,932 --> 00:29:24,393
So what we wanted to do is we would split systems

501
00:29:24,453 --> 00:29:25,533
into smaller packages.

502
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,292
uh... and

503
00:29:29,112 --> 00:29:30,972
you know we can have the small packages such as

504
00:29:31,633 --> 00:29:37,054
like cover and sounds navigation and like doors and moving body and these are

505
00:29:37,094 --> 00:29:39,374
things that we knew we were going to need any time in the game

506
00:29:40,354 --> 00:29:43,675
uh... but then what we did is we'd also load packages such as

507
00:29:43,695 --> 00:29:45,415
uh... basic

508
00:29:45,895 --> 00:29:46,435
so excuse me

509
00:29:46,956 --> 00:29:50,116
uh... we can also load things that we would or wouldn't need for a certain map

510
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:53,797
so we knew that maybe one map we wouldn't need a climb system or we knew

511
00:29:53,837 --> 00:29:54,597
we wouldn't gonna need

512
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:56,278
ladder navigation.

513
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:58,741
So we could then strip that out and then put that

514
00:29:58,961 --> 00:29:59,461
on the disk.

515
00:29:59,562 --> 00:30:01,604
And then it could be loaded in as and when we needed it.

516
00:30:03,305 --> 00:30:05,628
Also, we could load certain packages on the fly.

517
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:08,190
Things like lethal and non-lethal,

518
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,872
that was actually a toggle.

519
00:30:10,232 --> 00:30:12,494
So you could play that in the game.

520
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:13,876
It would essentially pause the game.

521
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,137
And because the loading was really quick,

522
00:30:16,098 --> 00:30:18,160
it gave us an opportunity to load out the lethal

523
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,161
and bring in the non-lethal.

524
00:30:19,939 --> 00:30:23,600
We could also do things like riot shield as well because we didn't use that that much

525
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:29,063
And fast rope again is that we didn't use that that much so we could load that in and that was absolutely fine

526
00:30:30,343 --> 00:30:35,165
Overall this simple organization. I think saved us around 6 Meg which is huge

527
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:42,548
It doesn't sound big, but it is it's impressive. It's like that almost deserves a clap. I'm not gonna mess around no no no no no no

528
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:43,449
It's okay. It's okay

529
00:30:46,165 --> 00:30:50,347
Anyway, okay, so the cover system in Splinter Cell Conviction was really good,

530
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:55,510
and was actually really efficient for what it was, but was so complicated.

531
00:30:56,751 --> 00:31:01,774
We wanted to reuse it, but we found that what we could do is we could just mirror half of it.

532
00:31:03,234 --> 00:31:08,698
So we stripped out, I think, the right-hand side, and just pressed the mirror button,

533
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:12,280
which we added. Again, there's a lot more complication to how that tech came about,

534
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,441
but as an animator, it was mirror, and that was it.

535
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:19,564
So the good thing about that is we could just replace,

536
00:31:19,884 --> 00:31:20,985
using the replacements and everything,

537
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,987
we could just throw in an animation if we needed it.

538
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,888
Say for example, if he wanted to do something

539
00:31:24,908 --> 00:31:27,009
with his right hand when he was over on the other side,

540
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,951
it was really easy to put something else in.

541
00:31:29,391 --> 00:31:31,032
So again, this saved us around four megs,

542
00:31:31,052 --> 00:31:32,813
so already that's 10 meg we've saved.

543
00:31:33,354 --> 00:31:36,756
So Mike starts to smile again, puts his gun down.

544
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:41,715
And also, for us, layers were huge.

545
00:31:42,636 --> 00:31:44,978
I'm not going to go too in depth of what layers are,

546
00:31:45,078 --> 00:31:46,819
because I'm going to kind of assume

547
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:47,940
that some people talk about it.

548
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,962
And there is other talks today talking about layers.

549
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,484
So I don't want to teach a grandmother to suck eggs.

550
00:31:53,004 --> 00:31:55,486
But for us, we'd have our base animation.

551
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:57,908
This was our one-handed animation.

552
00:31:57,948 --> 00:31:59,809
And then what we could do is we could quite easily add just

553
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:02,892
a weapon layer of just some jiggling arms that

554
00:32:02,912 --> 00:32:04,193
looked like he was kind of running.

555
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:05,974
And then we'd add that over.

556
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:07,896
And then we'd get that animation.

557
00:32:09,116 --> 00:32:16,722
This basically meant that we could cut two-handed as a base animation set and we got it for free.

558
00:32:17,363 --> 00:32:25,309
So this basically took me a weekend to do and then it's like and we got rid of I think it was six meg?

559
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:30,813
Six meg in a weekend and it's like so already that is what 16 meg that we've got rid of.

560
00:32:31,313 --> 00:32:33,075
So again Mike's really really happy at this point.

561
00:32:33,873 --> 00:32:38,976
And the cool thing was it kind of stuck with the whole idea of prowling and response as well.

562
00:32:39,016 --> 00:32:41,858
And it basically meant that I didn't have to work on three animation sets.

563
00:32:41,898 --> 00:32:46,642
I didn't have to work on zero-handed, so where they haven't got a weapon in the hand.

564
00:32:46,682 --> 00:32:49,263
I didn't have to work on one-handed or two-handed.

565
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:52,526
I only had to work on one of those sets and then use layers to kind of help us out.

566
00:32:53,286 --> 00:32:56,288
So using all these together would actually be really, really useful.

567
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,504
Okay, so at the end of that, after a quick spring clean,

568
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:04,786
with the biggest savings, I think, were in navigation,

569
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,349
due to the extensive use of layers,

570
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:08,991
the cover system because of the mirroring,

571
00:33:10,232 --> 00:33:12,575
and we managed to make a dent into our AI behaviors again

572
00:33:12,635 --> 00:33:16,559
with some of the variety node and the layers as well.

573
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:19,061
So we ended up getting a more reasonable number

574
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:19,642
of about 17 meg.

575
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:23,461
We were down to the bare bones now.

576
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,403
But the cool thing is,

577
00:33:25,423 --> 00:33:26,903
I could now have my toys back.

578
00:33:27,624 --> 00:33:29,245
So Mike handed me the keys

579
00:33:30,065 --> 00:33:31,006
and there are all the numbers.

580
00:33:31,446 --> 00:33:33,047
I'm just going to show you animation from now on.

581
00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:35,528
Okay.

582
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:37,630
So one of the things

583
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,451
I became a little obsessed with was

584
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:41,312
I wanted to keep

585
00:33:41,372 --> 00:33:43,053
Sam on the move pretty much at all times.

586
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:44,894
I love this kind of concept.

587
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:46,895
I wanted to use it through everywhere.

588
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:48,862
So I'm going to describe what it is.

589
00:33:49,502 --> 00:33:52,604
The idea was to keep as much inertia going through animations as possible.

590
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:57,766
You know, improving how fluid Sam was and blurring the line between the systems as I

591
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:58,767
said.

592
00:33:58,847 --> 00:34:00,728
Locomotion, traversal, hand to hand.

593
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:01,468
I didn't want him to stop.

594
00:34:01,488 --> 00:34:05,211
I didn't want to have to go up to something, push a button, and then it happened.

595
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:09,153
I wanted you to be able to think on the fly and like an elite spy and like Kevin does.

596
00:34:09,473 --> 00:34:12,416
I want you to be able to act, not stop, and just carry on.

597
00:34:12,937 --> 00:34:14,899
So I put this video together, you know,

598
00:34:14,939 --> 00:34:16,721
and it's things like, you know, when we're landing,

599
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:18,222
you can see how out of control he is,

600
00:34:18,242 --> 00:34:18,683
and you can see.

601
00:34:19,217 --> 00:34:20,738
that they'll take the landing through the run.

602
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,159
And you know, like Bond here was a great reference for me.

603
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,741
And you know, just from the way that he was always kind of just continuing to move.

604
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:33,423
And always, you know, I loved the whole idea of having his hand down when, you know,

605
00:34:34,443 --> 00:34:35,463
when you're jumping down and things.

606
00:34:35,564 --> 00:34:38,064
I didn't want him to be all parkour-y.

607
00:34:38,545 --> 00:34:41,326
You know, I was looking for something a little bit more raw and a bit more cat-like.

608
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:48,646
So then we went to MoCap and we basically got another guy,

609
00:34:48,807 --> 00:34:50,688
a guy called Stéphane Julien.

610
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:54,349
And he's done a bunch of MoCap for a bunch of other Ubisoft

611
00:34:54,369 --> 00:34:54,710
projects.

612
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,791
But we got him to just play around in the space.

613
00:34:58,732 --> 00:35:00,693
We set up a bunch of obstacles and said, right,

614
00:35:00,713 --> 00:35:02,834
I want you to go from here to there as quick as you possibly

615
00:35:02,874 --> 00:35:05,015
can, use whatever you need to do to do it,

616
00:35:05,215 --> 00:35:06,416
and we'll work with it afterwards.

617
00:35:06,476 --> 00:35:08,057
So at this point, we didn't really

618
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:09,177
know what we were trying to capture.

619
00:35:09,217 --> 00:35:11,078
We just knew that we wanted to capture something nice

620
00:35:11,118 --> 00:35:11,458
and fluid.

621
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:12,879
And the whole idea is we were going

622
00:35:12,899 --> 00:35:13,780
to try and put it all together.

623
00:35:15,468 --> 00:35:18,211
So then, very quickly, we managed

624
00:35:18,231 --> 00:35:21,054
to start to see some of the animation together.

625
00:35:21,315 --> 00:35:22,756
This was very early.

626
00:35:22,897 --> 00:35:25,139
Again, this was before we cleaned up some of the animation.

627
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:30,929
broken it down its raw form and you can start to see that some of the lines kind of keep nice and clean

628
00:35:30,949 --> 00:35:35,714
he's always on the move whereas before he would have gone up to these positions, stopped, stepped up,

629
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,355
stopped again and then carried on.

630
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:39,417
We were keeping everything on the move.

631
00:35:40,758 --> 00:35:44,302
Some of the things that we wanted to do is we wanted to make sure that this worked for

632
00:35:44,862 --> 00:35:48,245
walk, jog and run sets. We also made sure that we wanted to

633
00:35:49,126 --> 00:35:51,208
connect everything to crouch, so you could be

634
00:35:51,248 --> 00:35:53,410
at any position at any time, and then just

635
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,792
dynamically change to crouch, and then it would

636
00:35:55,832 --> 00:35:57,653
absorb more of the impact.

637
00:35:58,094 --> 00:35:59,975
You know, so there you can see he's putting his hand down,

638
00:36:00,095 --> 00:36:01,337
and it started to work really, really well,

639
00:36:01,377 --> 00:36:02,237
so we're really happy with this.

640
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:04,579
Okay.

641
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,222
And again, that was connected to the whole

642
00:36:08,443 --> 00:36:09,764
panther idea of prowl.

643
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,786
It was really responsive, and it felt really tactile,

644
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:14,968
and again, it was, you know, it was reactive to the world.

645
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:21,785
So we wanted to maintain the momentum through to hand-to-hand.

646
00:36:22,065 --> 00:36:25,065
So we first created a moving version of all of Sam's hand-to-hand moves.

647
00:36:26,446 --> 00:36:28,927
So as you can see, you'll just kind of take the guy down,

648
00:36:29,607 --> 00:36:32,308
minimal movement, put him down nice and quietly.

649
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:33,028
It looks really cool.

650
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:35,789
The problem with this is it lacked precision.

651
00:36:36,669 --> 00:36:39,370
So we went and created a static version of these moves as well.

652
00:36:40,886 --> 00:36:42,748
So the thing is, is this is effectively the same move,

653
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,450
because it's an attack from behind.

654
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,294
But depending on the proximity of the character you were,

655
00:36:49,354 --> 00:36:50,935
or depending on how close the stick was,

656
00:36:51,436 --> 00:36:52,557
or how much you were pushing the stick,

657
00:36:52,937 --> 00:36:53,878
would play one of these.

658
00:36:53,918 --> 00:36:55,159
I think if you were at a walk speed,

659
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,080
would play the static one.

660
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,501
And if you were anything above that,

661
00:36:57,702 --> 00:37:00,164
then it would take the inertia through with the moving.

662
00:37:00,624 --> 00:37:01,485
So here you can see the difference.

663
00:37:04,507 --> 00:37:09,432
So, and again, connections to prowl and to surgical strike,

664
00:37:10,534 --> 00:37:12,596
because this was nice and precise,

665
00:37:12,656 --> 00:37:13,517
the way everything's working.

666
00:37:14,218 --> 00:37:15,940
And again, it was really responsive.

667
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,364
So we proved this worked really well for hand-to-hand,

668
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:21,887
and it's clear we wanted to take it even further.

669
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:28,011
So, we developed a few systems that would encourage the players to play stealthy.

670
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:32,895
We wanted to show Sam's awareness of his surroundings, and in turn, the AI's perception of Sam.

671
00:37:33,915 --> 00:37:38,699
It was extremely important that we showed Sam actively acting stealthy, and Kevin was

672
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:39,620
really cool at this.

673
00:37:42,021 --> 00:37:43,122
knowing about his surroundings.

674
00:37:43,142 --> 00:37:45,764
He used to talk about using his hands like whiskers.

675
00:37:45,944 --> 00:37:47,945
Again, the cat references keep coming back.

676
00:37:48,505 --> 00:37:49,906
But he'd always have his hand out,

677
00:37:49,946 --> 00:37:50,887
and he'd be touching the wall.

678
00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:52,168
And he'd never really be looking at anything.

679
00:37:52,588 --> 00:37:53,408
And it worked really, really well.

680
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:57,931
He used to do things where he'd cover his tracks,

681
00:37:58,472 --> 00:38:00,373
like with his hand behind him as well, which worked really nice.

682
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:02,814
But we didn't put that in the game.

683
00:38:03,275 --> 00:38:05,316
So anyway, this resulted in our animation contrast system.

684
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:08,158
And it would allow animation to change dynamically,

685
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:09,999
depending on the situation Sam found himself in.

686
00:38:11,698 --> 00:38:14,140
We wanted to focus the attention on three key areas.

687
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,402
So again, hand-to-hand navigation and the AI awareness.

688
00:38:17,903 --> 00:38:19,564
This would involve creating unique animations

689
00:38:19,604 --> 00:38:22,306
for all the SAM and the AI whenever their awareness

690
00:38:22,326 --> 00:38:23,046
level would change.

691
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:25,408
And this would change dynamically as we were playing.

692
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:27,630
So again, we're going to have to throw in a load more animation.

693
00:38:29,511 --> 00:38:30,892
But it could very quickly explode

694
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,733
if we didn't control it.

695
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:40,825
Okay, so we wanted to add combat and stealth variants of everything, and hand-to-hand was

696
00:38:40,845 --> 00:38:44,607
the easiest way to prove the concept, and decided to start with our cover takedown mechanics,

697
00:38:45,108 --> 00:38:45,928
as I said, abductions.

698
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:52,132
So here we've got a combat version of a move, and what would happen is, to me this was about

699
00:38:52,353 --> 00:38:53,794
threat suppression.

700
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:54,454
What would happen is...

701
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,123
if an AI was aware of you,

702
00:38:59,223 --> 00:39:00,564
if an AI was aware of you,

703
00:39:00,944 --> 00:39:03,347
then they would play this animation.

704
00:39:03,847 --> 00:39:05,489
And then we had stealth,

705
00:39:05,529 --> 00:39:07,090
which was more to me about sound suppression.

706
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,372
It was if the AI wasn't aware,

707
00:39:08,632 --> 00:39:09,773
it's about bringing you into cover,

708
00:39:10,153 --> 00:39:12,295
and then just hiding you.

709
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:14,237
So here you can see these two moves.

710
00:39:14,297 --> 00:39:15,679
Again, it's essentially the same move.

711
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,060
It's all the same criteria.

712
00:39:18,381 --> 00:39:20,383
The only thing that changes the AI awareness state.

713
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:24,011
these moves would be called automatically.

714
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:26,954
And it started to work really, really well for us.

715
00:39:29,597 --> 00:39:30,979
And again, connecting.

716
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:32,460
I love the connections.

717
00:39:33,601 --> 00:39:36,104
So it's like you've got the awareness, you've got surgical strike,

718
00:39:36,404 --> 00:39:39,528
and you've got reactive, and everything's really tactile,

719
00:39:39,548 --> 00:39:40,529
so there's lots of touching there.

720
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:46,269
OK, but the criteria for this, again,

721
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:49,131
to give you a context into how many animations were involved

722
00:39:49,191 --> 00:39:51,572
in this, is we'd choose the cover type.

723
00:39:51,672 --> 00:39:53,973
So the cover type would be whether it was a side cover

724
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:54,974
or whether it was an over cover.

725
00:39:54,994 --> 00:39:58,115
So that would be two animations.

726
00:39:58,235 --> 00:40:01,057
Then on top of that, it would be the cover direction.

727
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:02,797
So it would be whether you were facing left or right.

728
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:07,620
Then it would be that we take into account the AI orientation,

729
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,262
whether it was facing forward, away from you, and towards you.

730
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:15,732
Then it'd be the lethal and non-lethal choice.

731
00:40:17,113 --> 00:40:19,014
And on top of that would be the combat or stealth.

732
00:40:20,015 --> 00:40:22,596
So add it all together, 32 animations unique.

733
00:40:22,656 --> 00:40:23,957
It doesn't sound like a lot, but when

734
00:40:24,097 --> 00:40:25,418
you think each one of those animations

735
00:40:25,478 --> 00:40:27,459
takes a day to a couple of days to animate,

736
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:29,940
then that's just the tip of the iceberg.

737
00:40:35,363 --> 00:40:36,984
Yeah, so that's the two unique animations.

738
00:40:38,805 --> 00:40:40,006
But we didn't want to stop there.

739
00:40:40,186 --> 00:40:42,627
So we wanted to apply this to open combat as well.

740
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,121
So we had the lethal and non-lethal choice.

741
00:40:46,962 --> 00:40:48,783
The lethal would be using the karambit,

742
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:50,564
and the non-lethal would be using hands.

743
00:40:50,624 --> 00:40:52,686
So it'd be like choke outs and everything, things like that.

744
00:40:54,086 --> 00:40:55,107
Lethal was usually quicker.

745
00:40:55,547 --> 00:40:57,248
So again, the player could choose to do that.

746
00:40:57,909 --> 00:41:01,111
And it would kind of be more for the panther or assault player,

747
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:03,733
which are some of the play styles we talked about.

748
00:41:05,093 --> 00:41:08,055
And non-lethal would be for more of the stealthy player.

749
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:19,953
So here you can see them together and again, essentially this is the same move.

750
00:41:20,373 --> 00:41:21,013
It's just, it's

751
00:41:21,614 --> 00:41:25,556
it's a criteria that we would choose. It's like, so we chose to do the non-lethal

752
00:41:25,576 --> 00:41:26,076
version of this.

753
00:41:26,537 --> 00:41:28,498
So all of these had to be dynamically loaded in game

754
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:31,240
and again it was really kind of going back to the player choice.

755
00:41:34,287 --> 00:41:39,612
So, all of these would have either a static version or a moving version.

756
00:41:40,073 --> 00:41:43,195
The direction of attack would be taken into account whether you were in front, or the

757
00:41:43,255 --> 00:41:44,416
left, or the right, or behind them.

758
00:41:45,057 --> 00:41:47,339
Again, the lethal or non-lethal choice, or the combat or stealth.

759
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:52,504
So that's 32 animations there.

760
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:56,187
Add that to the other, 64, so already we start to explode.

761
00:41:58,052 --> 00:41:58,532
But we're not done.

762
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:02,216
So there's also the aerial takedowns

763
00:42:02,276 --> 00:42:03,998
that we call death from above.

764
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:05,920
The contextual takedowns, so they

765
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,942
could be anything from pulling people out of a ledge,

766
00:42:07,962 --> 00:42:11,006
hitting them against the wall, various other things.

767
00:42:11,526 --> 00:42:14,910
And also, we decided to add a hand-to-hand finisher

768
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,172
to the mark and execute system.

769
00:42:19,567 --> 00:42:20,028
So there you go.

770
00:42:20,148 --> 00:42:22,790
Altogether, there's 98 unique animations

771
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:25,212
that could be called at any point at any time.

772
00:42:25,632 --> 00:42:27,574
And we had to fit them into memory.

773
00:42:28,294 --> 00:42:30,756
If anyone's seen, if there's a video everywhere

774
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:32,678
out there about all 98 takedowns,

775
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:34,199
I'd be very interested to see it.

776
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:39,003
OK, but by far the animation seen the most

777
00:42:39,283 --> 00:42:40,244
would be Sam's navigation.

778
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:42,046
So it's clear we need to apply the same attention

779
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:43,647
to the basic navigation controls.

780
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,609
And early on in development, we questioned

781
00:42:46,629 --> 00:42:47,370
the use of.

782
00:42:48,795 --> 00:42:50,897
basically a manual crouch.

783
00:42:51,077 --> 00:42:52,578
Players were staying in crouch all the time.

784
00:42:53,299 --> 00:42:59,424
So we looked at removing the actual option to not.

785
00:42:59,704 --> 00:43:01,426
So we played around with the idea of the automated crouch.

786
00:43:02,286 --> 00:43:03,708
And it kind of works.

787
00:43:04,228 --> 00:43:06,650
And it gave the, again, cat references.

788
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:08,532
It gave the idea of Sam being stealthy.

789
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,601
And it was a great way to show Sam's awareness of his surroundings.

790
00:43:14,103 --> 00:43:17,669
You know, again, it kind of embodied some of the stuff that Kevin was doing and it would

791
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:19,953
really make it look like Sam was aware of his surroundings.

792
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:25,492
uh... but promises by removing the ability to manually crouch players would

793
00:43:25,512 --> 00:43:26,153
get spotted

794
00:43:26,513 --> 00:43:27,554
and they would be able to control it

795
00:43:28,435 --> 00:43:31,238
uh... and to be honest with you it just made him look like he was scared

796
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:31,979
all the time

797
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,242
because as soon as you got near to an enemy he'd just duck down

798
00:43:34,502 --> 00:43:35,543
he'd just be, he'd just look weird

799
00:43:36,264 --> 00:43:36,404
uh...

800
00:43:37,045 --> 00:43:38,506
but i really liked how

801
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:39,447
it worked

802
00:43:39,948 --> 00:43:42,450
There was something about this system that I thought

803
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,071
was really useful.

804
00:43:43,771 --> 00:43:45,413
So we kept the idea.

805
00:43:45,453 --> 00:43:46,954
We still kept the stand and the crouch.

806
00:43:47,195 --> 00:43:49,437
But then we just kept the criteria.

807
00:43:49,497 --> 00:43:52,119
So all we did is we did this first test.

808
00:43:54,802 --> 00:43:56,463
And you can see with this first test, all we did

809
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:57,624
is as soon as you got into cover,

810
00:43:58,205 --> 00:44:00,066
then he just reached and put his hand back on the knife.

811
00:44:00,427 --> 00:44:00,927
That's all he did.

812
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:04,952
So if there wasn't an AI there, he wouldn't do that.

813
00:44:05,012 --> 00:44:07,013
But then if he was, he just reached his hand back on the knife.

814
00:44:07,054 --> 00:44:08,094
And he was like, OK, that works.

815
00:44:08,134 --> 00:44:08,655
That's really cool.

816
00:44:08,915 --> 00:44:10,136
We thought that was pretty successful.

817
00:44:10,736 --> 00:44:13,398
But we just didn't want to do it whenever he was static.

818
00:44:13,858 --> 00:44:15,699
It's my whole obsession with everything in motion.

819
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,921
We wanted to make him aware and reactive at all times.

820
00:44:23,324 --> 00:44:31,549
So basically, that turned into what we called Closer Than Ever.

821
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:36,394
So here you've got like the base animation set and this would be if no one was around

822
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:41,098
uh... Sam would just be crouching all the time and it would kind of look cool

823
00:44:41,118 --> 00:44:42,579
and again there would be a stand variant of this

824
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:44,841
but then what we wanted to do is dynamically

825
00:44:45,281 --> 00:44:46,322
as you got closer to the enemy

826
00:44:47,463 --> 00:44:50,065
Sam would start to look a bit more stealthy and this would blend in over time

827
00:44:50,786 --> 00:44:53,208
so the closer you got the more stealthy he'd look

828
00:44:53,848 --> 00:44:55,890
and then also as you got really close

829
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:59,393
he'd reach back, put his hand on the knife and finish

830
00:45:00,848 --> 00:45:04,950
So each one of these was starting to show Sam's awareness level to AI and everything.

831
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,111
And again, we really, really liked how this was working.

832
00:45:07,592 --> 00:45:12,114
And this was actually an old system from a previous splinter cell that had been commented out.

833
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:17,117
And we decided to kind of bring it back and like, freshen it up and do this to it.

834
00:45:33,889 --> 00:45:35,911
So that was everything all put together,

835
00:45:35,931 --> 00:45:37,653
and you can start to see that all the ideas

836
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,074
that we're looking at starting to come together.

837
00:45:41,757 --> 00:45:44,479
So yeah, so that's gonna bring me to our AI behavior.

838
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,402
And to me, one of the very first things I said

839
00:45:47,442 --> 00:45:49,204
to our lead AI programmer was,

840
00:45:49,424 --> 00:45:50,906
to me Splinter Cell was about,

841
00:45:51,366 --> 00:45:52,587
I'm not gonna say the actual word I used,

842
00:45:52,968 --> 00:45:54,990
but to me, Splinter Cell was about manipulating the AI.

843
00:45:57,362 --> 00:46:03,826
And I was obsessed with, you know, making the AI do whatever you wanted to do and kind of, you know, like, showing him this over here and then you going over there.

844
00:46:04,226 --> 00:46:05,667
And I thought it worked really, really well for stealth.

845
00:46:06,771 --> 00:46:10,074
And to me, AI communications and interactions were going to be a strong focus.

846
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,835
Reactions to everything happening in the world were going to be huge.

847
00:46:13,876 --> 00:46:17,318
And it was important to show that the AI were going to be going around their everyday lives.

848
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:20,120
And it's something that Jalil was talking about earlier,

849
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,643
was everything happening before and after an event.

850
00:46:24,023 --> 00:46:27,405
And I wanted to show people going about the middle part.

851
00:46:32,003 --> 00:46:34,666
So this is some of the things that we put in there.

852
00:46:34,946 --> 00:46:38,689
I had this thing where I didn't want people to...

853
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:41,071
You know, for stealth games, everyone always has their back to you.

854
00:46:41,571 --> 00:46:43,353
And I'm like, that doesn't work for me.

855
00:46:43,413 --> 00:46:45,314
So I wanted them to have a reason to have their back to you.

856
00:46:45,334 --> 00:46:48,136
So I did things like washing their face, nice and simple.

857
00:46:48,477 --> 00:46:50,979
You know, like loading boxes. Again, this seems pretty obvious.

858
00:46:51,319 --> 00:46:51,659
Peeing.

859
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,621
was always a good one.

860
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:57,566
And the thing is, something that I found that I used to do

861
00:46:57,586 --> 00:47:00,129
when I was ever on the phone, was I'd walk around

862
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,952
and I wasn't focusing on anything else.

863
00:47:03,012 --> 00:47:03,773
I'd just be distracted.

864
00:47:04,153 --> 00:47:05,675
And I thought that was a really good thing.

865
00:47:05,715 --> 00:47:06,816
So you could see like there,

866
00:47:06,876 --> 00:47:07,958
we'd have the range of everything.

867
00:47:11,822 --> 00:47:12,943
So again, I'd have like, you know.

868
00:47:13,516 --> 00:47:16,038
have the guys kind of like playing games when they're...

869
00:47:16,698 --> 00:47:20,381
And again, I just wanted the AI to look a little bit more friendly instead of these

870
00:47:21,062 --> 00:47:24,745
these kind of, these guys that have no lives. I wanted you to think, oh, maybe I shouldn't kill him.

871
00:47:24,865 --> 00:47:26,446
He might have to go home to his wife or something.

872
00:47:27,186 --> 00:47:29,128
But, you know, that didn't really ever happen.

873
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:33,791
Okay, so one of the very first things that we worked on

874
00:47:34,772 --> 00:47:35,973
was Impact.

875
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:40,511
and uh... it was uh... we found out, because we wanted to improve the gunplay

876
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:41,872
in uh... in Blacklist

877
00:47:42,512 --> 00:47:43,332
and we found that

878
00:47:44,053 --> 00:47:48,194
the final bullet impact wasn't quite working, everyone would go to ragdoll a little bit

879
00:47:48,214 --> 00:47:49,294
too early and it wouldn't quite

880
00:47:49,835 --> 00:47:51,035
fix, it wouldn't quite fit

881
00:47:53,196 --> 00:47:54,316
so the very first thing we did

882
00:47:55,937 --> 00:47:56,197
was

883
00:47:57,317 --> 00:47:58,057
remove the blend

884
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,659
this straight away gave us

885
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:02,699
SNAP!

886
00:48:12,143 --> 00:48:15,646
So we started with basically the final bullet impact. That was the very first thing I wanted to work on.

887
00:48:15,666 --> 00:48:17,247
I wanted to end on the end.

888
00:48:17,748 --> 00:48:19,089
I'm sorry, I wanted to start on the end.

889
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:22,612
Because I felt that the further, you know, kind of like Leon in The Professional,

890
00:48:22,752 --> 00:48:26,395
is like, you know, the further you get, or is it the closer you get, the better you are.

891
00:48:26,475 --> 00:48:27,296
I wanted to do the opposite.

892
00:48:27,536 --> 00:48:31,119
I wanted to basically, you know, start with the death and then kind of work my way back.

893
00:48:31,539 --> 00:48:33,761
And I felt that these are the things that the players were going to see

894
00:48:33,801 --> 00:48:35,282
when they were looking down the barrel of a gun,

895
00:48:35,383 --> 00:48:37,324
or whether they were watching someone or whether they were observing.

896
00:48:38,825 --> 00:48:40,085
Adding snap was important.

897
00:48:41,066 --> 00:48:42,946
We wanted that kind of violent reaction of a bullet.

898
00:48:43,627 --> 00:48:45,227
And we really wanted bullets to mean something.

899
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:50,169
And, you know, basically I think we had the blend to about like maybe two frames,

900
00:48:50,569 --> 00:48:52,530
something like that, but it really worked.

901
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:56,411
We also added a bunch of animations for

902
00:48:58,011 --> 00:48:58,432
directions.

903
00:49:01,853 --> 00:49:03,573
So this whole idea of everything in motion

904
00:49:04,614 --> 00:49:05,734
went through to the deaths as well.

905
00:49:07,169 --> 00:49:09,150
so we start to take into account criteria

906
00:49:10,111 --> 00:49:14,073
such as where you're getting shot, the speed you're getting shot, when you actually get shot

907
00:49:15,774 --> 00:49:16,994
the direction you get shot from

908
00:49:20,036 --> 00:49:23,938
and stuff like that, and this was really simple, it was like, this was to me, this was basic stuff

909
00:49:23,998 --> 00:49:25,079
but really started to make

910
00:49:25,479 --> 00:49:27,160
this was before we did anything else to the guns

911
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,782
we just changed the AI reactions, that already started to make everything feel really really good

912
00:49:40,723 --> 00:49:48,868
Okay, so the thing is with reactions as well is I felt that there was like an untapped kind of area that we could really focus on.

913
00:49:48,888 --> 00:49:52,951
It's like, you know, I was fine with our pre-combat animations looking great.

914
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,973
They already looked really good in Conviction and I didn't want to break that.

915
00:49:57,153 --> 00:50:00,796
And the combat works, but I was obsessed with that transition in the middle.

916
00:50:02,017 --> 00:50:05,099
I used to liken it to when you're playing with your sister.

917
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:08,241
It's like the fun part is when she's scared.

918
00:50:09,001 --> 00:50:13,125
is not the actual part where she goes and tells you mum.

919
00:50:14,086 --> 00:50:14,306
So...

920
00:50:14,346 --> 00:50:16,468
So yeah.

921
00:50:16,989 --> 00:50:19,471
So we added things like double takes, we added all these other things.

922
00:50:20,952 --> 00:50:22,033
And, you know, I want to show you

923
00:50:22,994 --> 00:50:24,336
basically this simple manipulation.

924
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:44,239
It's a problem working in a game that is all about stealth,

925
00:50:44,259 --> 00:50:45,720
is you can't see anything, it's always black.

926
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,461
But yeah, the whole idea was that,

927
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:51,142
is I wanted to be able to distract someone from somewhere,

928
00:50:51,162 --> 00:50:52,683
if they reacted in a certain way,

929
00:50:52,703 --> 00:50:54,263
and I wanted that reaction to be believable.

930
00:50:54,303 --> 00:50:55,224
I didn't want them to be just going,

931
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:56,504
oh my God, just been shot.

932
00:50:56,864 --> 00:50:59,285
I wanted them to kind of just, nice and subtle,

933
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:02,447
go over and investigate, and then something happened.

934
00:51:04,088 --> 00:51:05,628
So this was kind of building up an ecosystem,

935
00:51:07,029 --> 00:51:07,909
and you know, it's basically,

936
00:51:07,949 --> 00:51:10,170
I wanna kind of finish off with like a chain of events.

937
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:14,117
So I'm just going to go straight into it.

938
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:33,242
So I don't know whether you can see that there,

939
00:51:33,262 --> 00:51:35,343
but the AI was banging on the door,

940
00:51:35,763 --> 00:51:37,424
and then in the middle of the banging,

941
00:51:37,824 --> 00:51:39,084
we blew out the light bulb.

942
00:51:39,405 --> 00:51:40,985
They kind of react nice and subtly,

943
00:51:41,646 --> 00:51:43,787
go over, communicate to another guy,

944
00:51:44,247 --> 00:51:45,728
and then he goes, hey, don't worry about it,

945
00:51:45,748 --> 00:51:48,329
it's just a light bulb, go back to your job.

946
00:51:48,349 --> 00:51:49,610
So the thing is, we could play with that.

947
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:52,911
So what we did is distract him again.

948
00:52:11,303 --> 00:52:12,725
So again, I don't know whether you can see that,

949
00:52:12,765 --> 00:52:14,127
but he distracted him in the middle.

950
00:52:14,488 --> 00:52:15,709
And because this was the second time,

951
00:52:15,749 --> 00:52:17,132
the AI remembered the first time

952
00:52:17,212 --> 00:52:19,215
and then would react and come towards you.

953
00:52:19,255 --> 00:52:20,156
We pulled him out the window,

954
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:22,479
which would then create suspicion.

955
00:52:50,428 --> 00:52:54,070
So now we create suspicion. You can see that the AI went to investigate.

956
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,270
We're going to start to create fear.

957
00:52:57,671 --> 00:53:01,752
And again we can play with this. The AI realised something was wrong and the reaction is fear.

958
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:03,673
Maybe we can use this to our advantage.

959
00:53:22,974 --> 00:53:24,055
Cool.

960
00:53:24,315 --> 00:53:26,196
So now we've managed to scare them.

961
00:53:26,516 --> 00:53:28,338
Then the AI started to see this.

962
00:53:28,358 --> 00:53:29,818
They're going to start to communicate with each other.

963
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,762
And by creating more panic, they're forced to up the ante.

964
00:53:37,123 --> 00:53:37,884
I see multiple bodies.

965
00:53:37,984 --> 00:53:39,325
Everyone, spread out and search.

966
00:53:39,405 --> 00:53:40,065
Emergency.

967
00:53:43,607 --> 00:53:44,788
Come here and help me search.

968
00:53:46,109 --> 00:53:47,310
So the cool thing is, is now they've

969
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:49,031
got their back naturally turned towards you.

970
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:51,012
And then we can do something with that.

971
00:54:00,932 --> 00:54:02,673
So we could have completely avoided those guys,

972
00:54:02,713 --> 00:54:04,173
but the whole thing is, is for us,

973
00:54:04,213 --> 00:54:06,874
we really wanted to keep these subtle reactions.

974
00:54:07,135 --> 00:54:09,155
If you want to hear more about the AI and everything,

975
00:54:10,256 --> 00:54:14,137
Martin Walsh is talking here on Wednesday at 2.35,

976
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:16,338
and I'm sure he'll go into a little bit more depth

977
00:54:16,358 --> 00:54:16,758
than I will.

978
00:54:18,299 --> 00:54:20,960
So I want to close with basically my points,

979
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,241
which to me, it's really important to find your muse.

980
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:30,701
Kevin was invaluable to some of the decisions and everything we made, and without him we wouldn't have been able to do some of the things that we did.

981
00:54:32,362 --> 00:54:34,802
It's like, I always like to try and find reference for as much as possible.

982
00:54:35,062 --> 00:54:37,103
And if you've got someone to bounce off, then that's really, really going to help.

983
00:54:37,523 --> 00:54:40,583
It's going to, you know, so that's something I like to do.

984
00:54:40,823 --> 00:54:44,904
To me, embracing optimization early would have helped us more.

985
00:54:44,944 --> 00:54:48,845
We managed to get away with it, but then if we'd really optimized early on, we could have maybe added even more.

986
00:54:49,545 --> 00:54:53,866
And no matter how big your memory budget is with the next generation of consoles, there's going to be a cap.

987
00:54:54,566 --> 00:54:56,447
So you've always got to think smart.

988
00:54:58,949 --> 00:55:00,830
And of course, for me, we're making games.

989
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:01,890
Gameplay is king.

990
00:55:02,811 --> 00:55:05,673
This is something I said in Mario's talk this morning,

991
00:55:06,593 --> 00:55:08,795
is again, you can have all this slinky cat-like animation,

992
00:55:08,855 --> 00:55:11,056
but if it doesn't respond and it responds like a dog,

993
00:55:11,096 --> 00:55:12,137
then it's not going to feel like a cat.

994
00:55:12,937 --> 00:55:18,380
So yeah, so that's my main thing, and that's my talk.

995
00:55:27,214 --> 00:55:30,976
I think we've run out of time. I don't know. Yeah, I'm getting a nod that we've run out of time.

996
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:34,777
I'm going to be at the Ubisoft lounge tomorrow morning at 10 if people want to ask me questions.

997
00:55:34,797 --> 00:55:37,258
Or I'm going to be hanging around if people want to ask me questions.
