00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:07,630
Hi, I'm Josh Manke.

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,412
Thanks for coming and welcome to my talk

3
00:00:09,412 --> 00:00:11,414
on matchmaking for engagements.

4
00:00:11,414 --> 00:00:14,357
Hopefully you'll enjoy this and it'll be engaging for you.

5
00:00:14,357 --> 00:00:16,639
So let's get into the talk.

6
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:18,981
So first let's define what matchmaking is.

7
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:21,684
We're talking about the kind of matchmaking

8
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:23,786
where players in multiplayer games

9
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:26,229
want to get in matches to compete with each other.

10
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:29,011
So you have a group of players, they wanna play.

11
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:33,164
They submit some information to the matchmaker about themselves

12
00:00:33,164 --> 00:00:35,786
that the matchmaker can use to create a good match.

13
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,889
The matchmaker takes this information about many people

14
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:43,433
and then puts them into matches and creates teams for them to play.

15
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:45,035
OK, now, so what is engagement?

16
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:48,998
Well, the dictionary tells us that engagement means to be greatly interested.

17
00:00:48,998 --> 00:00:52,481
And so we want our players to be greatly interested in our games.

18
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:54,603
And this is accomplished through gameplay.

19
00:00:55,225 --> 00:01:00,912
Matchmaking is there to guarantee that the gameplay is experienced as intended by the players.

20
00:01:00,912 --> 00:01:04,557
So a lot of the time we're just preventing disengagement

21
00:01:04,557 --> 00:01:08,282
by making sure that players can play the gameplay and have a good time with it.

22
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,930
So now on a good question to ask is,

23
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,731
how is matchmaking then related to engagement?

24
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:19,812
So we'll go back to our players.

25
00:02:19,812 --> 00:02:20,892
They wanna get into a match.

26
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:23,773
Here they are, they jump through matchmaking,

27
00:02:23,773 --> 00:02:26,094
matchmaking puts them into a game,

28
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:27,454
they enjoy your engaging gameplay,

29
00:02:27,454 --> 00:02:30,656
and then afterwards they jump back into matchmaking

30
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:33,877
because they are engaged and they want to keep playing.

31
00:02:33,877 --> 00:02:36,438
Now, where matchmaking comes into this though,

32
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:39,139
is what happens if they go into a game,

33
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:41,780
but the latency is so high on that server they're playing on

34
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,740
that they can't really play the game right.

35
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,929
that could disengage them.

36
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:49,810
Or maybe they're just not good enough to enjoy the gameplay.

37
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,831
They're so bad compared to the other players in the match

38
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:56,532
that they aren't even able to play very much.

39
00:02:56,532 --> 00:02:59,893
Or what happens if they just wait so long

40
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:01,734
that they never actually get to the gameplay?

41
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:04,915
So these are some things that we tend to try to prevent

42
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:06,555
and avoid with matchmaking.

43
00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:09,304
We want to cause those to not happen.

44
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:12,286
But a good question is, how important

45
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:13,928
are each of these characteristics?

46
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:16,810
Latency, fairness, wait times.

47
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,372
Which ones are more important?

48
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:19,833
That's what we're going to get to next

49
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,035
and what I'm going to want to talk about a bit.

50
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,937
But first of all, a good question we can ask

51
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:26,679
is, why do we care what's important?

52
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:29,601
Can't we just throw it all into the matchmaker,

53
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:32,083
let the matchmaker just sort it out?

54
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,765
And the answer is, not really.

55
00:03:33,765 --> 00:03:34,185
And here's why.

56
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:40,233
We create a situation if we do that called having too many buckets.

57
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:42,974
So as a player we want to matchmake on skill, say.

58
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:46,316
That's already reducing the number of players that I can matchmake with.

59
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:49,657
Let's say my skill bucket is only 15% of the whole population, okay?

60
00:03:49,657 --> 00:03:53,839
But now, and then we're like, well we also need to be careful with latency.

61
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:57,621
So that's another, it's only 10% of players that I can match with because of

62
00:03:57,621 --> 00:04:01,583
my latency. And then we want to do some fun, fancy,

63
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,904
cute, reputation matchmaking.

64
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,021
and let's say there's only 5% of the players

65
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:08,261
that my reputation makes me able to match with.

66
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:11,982
Once we've broken out all these different buckets of players,

67
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:14,703
we've reduced that player from being able to match

68
00:04:14,703 --> 00:04:19,104
with the whole population to just 0.08% of the population.

69
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:21,385
Suddenly, even a large population

70
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:23,205
becomes very small if you do that.

71
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:24,785
That's why you need to be careful

72
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:28,726
about just letting the matchmaker do it at once.

73
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,607
Because we used Halo 5 for the analysis

74
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:32,247
in this presentation,

75
00:04:32,247 --> 00:04:33,948
I'll quickly review what Halo 5 is about.

76
00:04:34,564 --> 00:04:36,145
So Halo 5 is a first-person shooter.

77
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:39,228
It's the matches and data we used

78
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:40,429
came from competitive matches.

79
00:04:40,429 --> 00:04:43,051
It's most of them are team-based.

80
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:45,934
It's usually four versus four,

81
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:47,395
but it can go up to 12 versus 12.

82
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:51,379
A lot of our matches are team deathmatch,

83
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:53,561
although there are some objective matches as well.

84
00:04:56,433 --> 00:05:03,196
Now because skill and fairness are often some of the more important characteristics we tend to matchmake on,

85
00:05:03,196 --> 00:05:04,796
I'll do a quick skill system review.

86
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:09,538
This talk is not going to go in-depth on skill systems, because that would take forever,

87
00:05:09,538 --> 00:05:13,279
but it is worth reviewing them to understand how they work into matchmaking.

88
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,940
So we have a player, but we want to know how good that player is.

89
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,462
So we put a number on them. That number should represent their skill.

90
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:21,802
Now,

91
00:05:22,393 --> 00:05:25,755
we use the skill to compare players to other players.

92
00:05:25,755 --> 00:05:29,816
So given two players, we can then figure out the difference in their skill from

93
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:32,637
each other. Now a good skill system, if it's working

94
00:05:32,637 --> 00:05:38,359
right, the player with the higher skill should win most of the time. We also want

95
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:40,719
to take this same concept to the team level.

96
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:44,941
And one way, simple way to do that, for this talk at least,

97
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:49,422
is just to take the average of each team. Take their average skill, average the

98
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:51,823
numbers on both sides and then take the gap between them.

99
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:55,390
And I call this the team skill gap.

100
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,711
And it helps tell us which team is going to win most of the time.

101
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:04,413
Now we care about that team skill gap because that tells us how fair the

102
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:07,333
match is. If the players have the perception that

103
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,214
they can win the match or not, that is probably important to them.

104
00:06:10,214 --> 00:06:14,496
But there's another type of fairness or another type of skill gap we care about

105
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:15,856
besides the team skill gap.

106
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:18,146
And that focuses on a single player

107
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:19,988
and their experience in the match.

108
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:21,549
We want to know what's gonna happen

109
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,010
when this player comes around the corner

110
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,871
and runs into another player on the other team.

111
00:06:24,871 --> 00:06:27,553
Are they gonna have some success against that player?

112
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,614
Are they gonna feel overwhelmed?

113
00:06:29,614 --> 00:06:32,856
And to represent this, we reduce the team,

114
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:35,838
the other team's skill again to an average.

115
00:06:35,838 --> 00:06:38,720
And we just compare the player on one team

116
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,762
to the other team's average skill

117
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:42,623
to get an average feel for what's gonna happen

118
00:06:42,623 --> 00:06:45,165
when the red player encounters a blue player.

119
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:47,917
And in this case, again, that should feel pretty good

120
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:51,239
because the blue player has a skill that is higher

121
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:53,100
than the other team's average.

122
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,201
And in this talk, I'll call that the personal gap,

123
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:56,281
the personal skill gap.

124
00:06:56,281 --> 00:06:59,263
So we have two pretty important skill gaps we care about,

125
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:02,485
the team skill gap and the personal skill gap.

126
00:07:03,554 --> 00:07:08,175
So now what we want to talk about is how important are these different characteristics?

127
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:11,656
We've talked about skill, we've talked a little bit about latency,

128
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:15,937
wait time, and you've probably also heard of people being worried about losing streaks.

129
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:20,818
These points here are some of the more commonly used items in matchmaking,

130
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:23,479
or at least items that developers tend to think are important.

131
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,659
So the question is, are they really important?

132
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:28,900
And that's what this presentation is going to try to find out.

133
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,861
So how do you find out if something is important?

134
00:07:32,413 --> 00:07:36,034
The sort of industry standard these days is to use something called A-B testing.

135
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:40,075
But the problem is matchmaking actually breaks A-B testing.

136
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:43,536
I'll go maybe a little into that later, but it has an issue with it.

137
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:47,878
And so we can't just use off-the-shelf A-B testing to test what's important.

138
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:51,018
But we can do something called an observational study.

139
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:57,021
In this case, we could look in our already existing data and find situations that match what we would like to test.

140
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:00,722
We find matches where the ping was really bad and see how players reacted.

141
00:08:00,722 --> 00:08:05,984
Or we find really unfair matches or really fair matches and see what the players did afterwards.

142
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:10,305
So we still have some very powerful tools to use and to be honest a lot of the most

143
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:13,826
important studies that have been done in science have been more observational

144
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,207
than more controlled experiments like A-B testing.

145
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,533
So let's start with the personal skill gap.

146
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,535
Again, that's where I'm a player, I run around the corner,

147
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:26,557
I see an enemy, and will I have any success

148
00:08:26,557 --> 00:08:29,459
against that enemy when I have an encounter with them?

149
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,441
The idea being, if personal skill gap is really important,

150
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:36,064
what can we observe in our data to see if it is important?

151
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:38,185
Well, one theory is if it's really important,

152
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,707
then players will play more matches

153
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:42,789
when the personal skill gap is smaller.

154
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,130
As long as they have some success

155
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,111
and they're able to play the game, they'll play more.

156
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:51,576
So to further illustrate this, we have a player who plays a lot of matches,

157
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:55,257
and he's playing a lot of matches because the gap, the personal gap from match to

158
00:08:55,257 --> 00:08:57,918
match was small. So he was happy. He kept playing.

159
00:08:57,918 --> 00:09:02,379
We contrast this with a player who has matches that have large personal gaps.

160
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:05,360
This player is more angry. He's going to play less matches.

161
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,060
So we should be able to construct an observation,

162
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,102
pull some data out and see if we actually notice this in our data.

163
00:09:13,446 --> 00:09:17,449
So we'll go into our data and we'll see what actually happens and see if

164
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:20,530
players do play more matches when those gaps are lower.

165
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,933
So we grab a player, grab all of our players, but let's just

166
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:27,635
for example show what happens with one player. We grab Bob. Bob's played several

167
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:30,096
matches, so we know how many he's played here.

168
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:33,939
Now we know Bob's played seven matches and now we want to see what was the gap

169
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:37,701
in those matches, right? So we write down what the personal gap

170
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:41,143
was for Bob in all those matches. Now if we do this for all of our players

171
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:42,544
we can start to build a data set.

172
00:09:43,362 --> 00:09:44,943
That data set kind of looks like this.

173
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:47,805
We want to know for every player,

174
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:50,467
what was the average personal gap they experienced

175
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:52,548
across all their matches that month?

176
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:53,849
Like ideally that would be low.

177
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:56,491
And then see how many matches they actually played

178
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:59,253
and see if there's a connection between those.

179
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:00,093
So write down Bob,

180
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:03,236
we've already said that he's played seven matches.

181
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,617
We average those gaps out

182
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:07,458
and we see that the average across those values is 67.

183
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:11,101
So Bob has had a gap of 67 and played seven matches.

184
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:13,687
We then do this for other players like Alice.

185
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:16,271
Alice had a higher skill gap, personal one,

186
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:18,173
in those matches that she played,

187
00:10:18,173 --> 00:10:19,575
and she tended to play less matches.

188
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:20,416
Maybe that's related.

189
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,059
So we'll keep doing that across everybody

190
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:24,121
who played for the whole month.

191
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,820
And then we wanna bucket those

192
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,321
to make it a bit easier to graph.

193
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:31,461
So we can't just plot them all on a graph.

194
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:32,982
We could, but it could be kind of confusing.

195
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:33,982
We wanna find a trend though.

196
00:10:33,982 --> 00:10:37,003
So instead, we take all the players who say

197
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,384
had a personal average skill gap of 50 for that whole month.

198
00:10:40,384 --> 00:10:43,545
And then we average how many matches did all the players

199
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:45,646
with a skill gap between say 50 and 100,

200
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,726
how many matches did they play?

201
00:10:47,726 --> 00:10:49,587
Well, they played 100, so we'll write that down.

202
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:52,528
And then we'll do that for all of the other buckets.

203
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:53,788
For each bucket, we'll keep note

204
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:55,408
of how many matches the player played.

205
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:58,130
if they had an average personal skill gap.

206
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,951
So again, we're connecting what was my personal skill gap

207
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,792
experience to the number of matches I played.

208
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,353
And so we did that and we graphed it.

209
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:06,034
Let's see what it looked like.

210
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:09,255
So if you look at this graph, you're like, wow.

211
00:11:09,255 --> 00:11:13,097
You'll notice that as that average skill gap

212
00:11:13,097 --> 00:11:14,558
goes close to zero,

213
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:17,019
meaning the perfect sort of matchmaking

214
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:18,620
of perfect fairness for the player,

215
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,942
the number of games the player's playing is the highest.

216
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:24,803
They'll play more games if we keep that gap low.

217
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,597
So you might think, well, we're done.

218
00:11:26,597 --> 00:11:29,939
We've shown that personal skill gap is definitely important.

219
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,961
The problem is we're not done.

220
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:36,363
This is bogus. And let me explain why.

221
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:40,646
So whenever you do an observational study,

222
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:43,588
a good sort of trick you should try first is to reverse

223
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:46,770
whatever your hypothesis was, whatever your theory was,

224
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,352
and make sure that that reversed hypothesis can't also be a thing.

225
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:56,026
So in this case, our original hypothesis was if the average gap is small,

226
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:59,970
players will play more matches. So if we reverse that,

227
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,272
we ask if players play more matches,

228
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:07,296
will that make the average skill gap that they play smaller?

229
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:10,539
And the answer is yes, it will, because we are in Halo 5,

230
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:14,983
we are skill matching. So on average, as you play more matches,

231
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:17,085
the average will tend towards zero.

232
00:12:17,598 --> 00:12:20,519
If you just get a one-off match here or there, it may be extreme.

233
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,039
You may have some one-offs there.

234
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:25,420
And so we may find players who have these random matches out there

235
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,301
who only played one game, but we don't know if they only played one game

236
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:33,882
because the match was bad or if the match just happened to be an outlier

237
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:35,903
and they only just happened to play one game.

238
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:39,383
And it's because they didn't play a lot of games, it didn't average out.

239
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,884
So we can't use this approach right now.

240
00:12:41,884 --> 00:12:44,605
And that brings up a general thing to be careful of.

241
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:46,665
You want to make sure that whatever your metric is.

242
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,201
It's the effect and not the cause.

243
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,884
So our metric is an average matches played.

244
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:56,368
Unfortunately, playing more matches causes better matchmaking.

245
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:58,429
So we can't use that approach, unfortunately.

246
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,131
So what can we do?

247
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:03,314
Well, let's go to a different approach.

248
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:06,516
We can, maybe we can't average over a bunch of matches,

249
00:13:06,516 --> 00:13:09,899
but we can probably just look at one match and see what happens.

250
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:15,184
So let's see if a bad match makes them quit out of the match.

251
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:20,565
And because if something's important to a player's matchmaking experience,

252
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:24,147
we'll suppose that they will actually leave the match if it's bad.

253
00:13:24,147 --> 00:13:26,689
And again, we'll call this quitting, quitting out of a single match.

254
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:30,431
Now, I know there's more to engagement than the player just leaving one match.

255
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:33,133
But still players leaving matches is bad.

256
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,534
It ruins the match for everyone else in the match,

257
00:13:35,534 --> 00:13:36,735
not just the quitter,

258
00:13:36,735 --> 00:13:38,797
and it probably leads to disengagement later.

259
00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:42,780
So we'll start there because that takes care of our issue

260
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:48,584
that we had with the correlating the two cause and effects.

261
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:51,506
So if personal gap really is important,

262
00:13:51,506 --> 00:13:54,288
players will quit if it's too large.

263
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:55,629
That's what we want to now show.

264
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:56,650
They'll quit out of a match.

265
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,370
Now, how do we do that?

266
00:13:58,248 --> 00:14:00,509
So this is what we're talking about, just to review.

267
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:01,910
We have our players.

268
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,231
They go into the matchmakers, they ask for a match.

269
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:06,611
Matchmaker puts them together.

270
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:08,292
However, that dark blue player,

271
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:10,373
his skill is way worse than the red team.

272
00:14:10,373 --> 00:14:12,594
And so he's not even able to play really.

273
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:14,354
Every time he just tries to do anything,

274
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,315
he tries to go grab a weapon off the map

275
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:17,175
and he just gets killed.

276
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:20,396
So he's not really actually able to enjoy the gameplay

277
00:14:20,396 --> 00:14:21,017
and he quits.

278
00:14:21,837 --> 00:14:22,977
And we want to look in our data

279
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:25,339
and see if this actually happens.

280
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:29,342
So let's again see how we would set that up.

281
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:31,964
So let's talk about what kind of data we're gonna gather

282
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:33,045
to do this study.

283
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:36,347
First, we need to know what match it was.

284
00:14:36,347 --> 00:14:38,349
So we're looking at individual matches now,

285
00:14:38,349 --> 00:14:40,010
not a player across a whole month.

286
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,731
So we need every match.

287
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:44,753
We need to know the player because we're looking at

288
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:47,535
did a individual player quit out of a match?

289
00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:48,856
And what caused them to quit?

290
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:49,076
Well.

291
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,976
Our theory is a high personal skill gap will cause them to quit.

292
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:56,359
So we'll be looking at the personal gap for this particular match.

293
00:14:56,359 --> 00:15:00,503
And then we will look at did they actually quit the match? Did they leave the match early?

294
00:15:00,503 --> 00:15:04,908
So we'll have data kind of like this. We'll have a match ID, some random number.

295
00:15:04,908 --> 00:15:08,391
We'll have a player's name. In this case, we've got Alice.

296
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:12,855
And Alice played a match and the personal skill gap she experienced in that match was 100.

297
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,916
And did Alice leave the match early?

298
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:16,656
No, she didn't.

299
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:18,538
So Alice was okay with the gap of 100

300
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:20,459
in this particular match.

301
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:21,600
Now we do that for Bob also.

302
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,301
Let's say Bob was also in that same match,

303
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:26,323
but Bob was much worse than Alice,

304
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:28,104
and therefore he did leave the match early.

305
00:15:28,104 --> 00:15:30,966
And we continue doing that for all of the players

306
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:34,228
for all of the matches in the time period we're measuring.

307
00:15:34,228 --> 00:15:36,630
And again, we're gonna bucket it just like before.

308
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,251
We're gonna take all of the players who experienced a

309
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:44,716
gap of up to 50 throughout all their matches for every single match and see whether or not they

310
00:15:44,716 --> 00:15:50,460
quit. And we'll do that for each of those skill buckets for personal skill and then we will graph

311
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:56,725
that and see if personal skill does lead to quitting. And it turns out it does. It turns

312
00:15:56,725 --> 00:16:02,910
out at least in Halo 5 for us, the higher the personal gap, the more likely a player will quit.

313
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,694
So that is important to us. And if you do the same study, look in your data,

314
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:14,130
And you see a similar graph that tells you that you can reduce quitting by matchmaking on that

315
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:19,713
personal skill gap. By reducing that gap, you know you can reduce quitting. So in fact, in this case,

316
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:25,055
it reduces the quit rate by over 20 percent, which is a pretty big deal. Another fun thing you can do

317
00:16:25,055 --> 00:16:28,057
with this graph is you can pick out using this data.

318
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,089
which skill gaps are okay and which ones aren't.

319
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:34,472
This graph sort of suggests that at first players

320
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:37,275
aren't as sensitive for a few hundred worth

321
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:37,815
of that skill gap.

322
00:16:37,815 --> 00:16:39,196
And as it increases though,

323
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:40,978
then they become more sensitive.

324
00:16:40,978 --> 00:16:43,980
So you can both use the graph to tell you it is important

325
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,883
and you can use the graph to tune your matchmaking.

326
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:49,645
So the takeaway here is that personal skill gap

327
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:51,627
is important to matchmaking.

328
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:52,848
And if you tune that gap,

329
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:55,870
you can reduce quit rates to whatever you think

330
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,251
is more important for your players.

331
00:16:58,163 --> 00:16:59,864
So we've spoken about the personal gap.

332
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:01,725
We've seen the personal skill gap is important,

333
00:17:01,725 --> 00:17:04,266
but what about the team gap we also spoke about?

334
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:06,667
So this is less about a player being able

335
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:09,108
to engage in the match and more about,

336
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,248
as a player on a team, do I feel like my team

337
00:17:11,248 --> 00:17:13,749
even has a chance to win this match?

338
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:15,010
Is that important to our players?

339
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,551
Are they okay playing matches that, yes,

340
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:19,511
they can run around and they can shoot people

341
00:17:19,511 --> 00:17:21,392
and they get some kills, they can do some objectives.

342
00:17:21,812 --> 00:17:23,852
but they know pretty early on in the match

343
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:25,353
that they're just not gonna win this match.

344
00:17:25,353 --> 00:17:26,754
What'll happen, right?

345
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,375
So if the team skill gap is important,

346
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,536
then again, we'd expect something like this.

347
00:17:32,536 --> 00:17:34,597
Players go into the matchmaker,

348
00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:35,397
it puts them in teams,

349
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:37,058
and it turns out that the blue team

350
00:17:37,058 --> 00:17:39,578
is worse than the red team, so much worse,

351
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:41,319
that they can feel pretty early on

352
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:43,120
that they're not going to win,

353
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,801
and this causes them to disengage, and they leave.

354
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:50,778
This is potentially even worse than the single player quitting out because now we can have

355
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:56,182
several players quitting out of a match. And we want to do a similar observational study in our

356
00:17:56,182 --> 00:18:02,067
data to see if this happens as well. To see if players are going to leave early because they

357
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:07,732
just can't win. They might as well just leave. So again let's get our data together. We want

358
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:13,256
players and we want to know for this match what was the team skill gap.

359
00:18:14,065 --> 00:18:15,126
and then did they leave?

360
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:16,867
So it's very similar to our last one,

361
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:19,349
but instead of looking at the personal gap

362
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,151
for every player in every match,

363
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:23,372
we're looking at the team gap.

364
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:24,713
So we've got Alice again.

365
00:18:24,713 --> 00:18:27,475
She played a match where there was a gap of 100

366
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:29,777
between her team and the other team,

367
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:31,278
and she did not leave.

368
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:34,480
Whereas Bob, he played a match where the team gap

369
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,723
between him, his team, and the other team was 250.

370
00:18:37,723 --> 00:18:40,125
His team had less of a chance of winning, and he did leave.

371
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:43,807
And again, we're going to bucket this so we can graph it conveniently.

372
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:48,070
We'll look at all cases, all matches, and with all per player,

373
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,693
where there was a gap of up to 50 and see how often did players leave in that gap.

374
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:57,736
Now, because it's now we're still looking at this per player per match,

375
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,497
a match can have four players in it.

376
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:02,099
Each of those players could have some chance of leaving.

377
00:19:02,707 --> 00:19:06,631
And in theory, that would be around the same average chance of leaving.

378
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:10,055
So as a quick hack, it's not the exact right math, but it's close.

379
00:19:10,055 --> 00:19:13,378
We multiply the chance of a single player leaving by the team size,

380
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:18,984
which gives us a rough approximation of the chance of any one player leaving the match.

381
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:21,847
And we graph that again to see if team fairness is important.

382
00:19:21,847 --> 00:19:23,509
And in fact, it is.

383
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:26,291
And in fact, it ends up being even more important.

384
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:31,396
like the quit rate with just a 100 rating difference will double on our players in Halo 5.

385
00:19:31,396 --> 00:19:37,820
We can have a guaranteed quitter when that rate quit when that skill gap gets up in the 400 range.

386
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:45,106
So again this tells us here that as the team skill gap increases the chance of players quitting out

387
00:19:45,106 --> 00:19:48,408
is going up very quickly and it's very important to our players.

388
00:19:49,578 --> 00:19:53,479
So the takeaway here is, yes, the team gap is important,

389
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:55,780
even more important in some ways than the personal gap.

390
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,041
It will lead to more quits.

391
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:02,022
And we can use that graph again to tune which team graphs,

392
00:20:02,022 --> 00:20:05,642
team gaps are appropriate for our players.

393
00:20:05,642 --> 00:20:08,443
So go ahead and do that in your own games.

394
00:20:08,443 --> 00:20:12,184
Find out how important this is so that you can improve their matchmaking.

395
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,283
Now, some of you may have actually done similar observational studies already.

396
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:21,247
And you may say to me, you know what, we've already tried that, doesn't work.

397
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:23,609
Skill gap in our game, at least, we know it doesn't matter.

398
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:28,293
And my answer to that is maybe. Because there's something else that we did

399
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:32,917
that we were curious about. See, we actually switched skill systems recently.

400
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:37,180
And our old skill system, which is closer to what is the standard today in the industry,

401
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:41,187
we still run that in parallel with our new skill system.

402
00:20:41,187 --> 00:20:45,209
So we could go into our data and run the same observation

403
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:49,452
using our old skill system to see if when players have a high skill gap in

404
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:52,914
our old system, do they quit out of matches? Because if

405
00:20:52,914 --> 00:20:56,096
they don't, that means that it's not that skill

406
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:59,478
doesn't matter in our game, it's that the skill system doesn't

407
00:20:59,478 --> 00:21:02,000
capture what's important to players in terms of matchmaking.

408
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,082
So let's see what it looked like. So as you can see here...

409
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,000
The old skill system is flat with respect to quitting.

410
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,941
As the skill gap increased in our old system,

411
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:16,022
players didn't care, they didn't quit.

412
00:21:16,022 --> 00:21:17,802
What that means is that skill is important

413
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:19,383
because as the blue line shows,

414
00:21:19,383 --> 00:21:21,503
players do quit as it increases,

415
00:21:21,503 --> 00:21:23,464
but it's not being captured or controlled

416
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:24,884
by the older skill system.

417
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,784
So don't just give up on skill

418
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:28,985
because your data says that it's not important.

419
00:21:28,985 --> 00:21:31,665
You need to first consider whether your skill system

420
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,506
is capturing what's important to your players.

421
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:35,684
And so you're asking, well, what is important?

422
00:21:35,684 --> 00:21:38,225
What's the difference between these systems?

423
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:40,786
So let me discuss what the two systems were.

424
00:21:40,786 --> 00:21:43,587
Previously, we used Classic TrueSkill.

425
00:21:43,587 --> 00:21:45,847
In Classic TrueSkill, which is a solid system,

426
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,548
I've used it for years in many games,

427
00:21:48,548 --> 00:21:50,089
it only looks at the winning team though

428
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:53,410
when it decides to evaluate how well the players did,

429
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,431
which players are better and worse.

430
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:58,292
And it needs a lot of matches to do that.

431
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:00,392
It can be up to 80 to 120 matches or more

432
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:01,733
when we're talking about 4v4.

433
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:06,358
True Skill 2 also incredibly values the winning team.

434
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:09,621
It's a very important part of how it decides who is good,

435
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,883
but it also takes into account several other factors

436
00:22:11,883 --> 00:22:14,905
that enable it to be much faster and more accurate

437
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:16,407
than classic True Skill.

438
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:19,389
It looks at how many games a player has played so far.

439
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:20,390
It looks at the party size,

440
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:23,313
and maybe even more importantly,

441
00:22:23,313 --> 00:22:24,714
it's looking at kills and deaths,

442
00:22:24,714 --> 00:22:28,517
which in Halo 5 are very important to player engagement.

443
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:34,991
So we have objects, we have events that are in our skill system that are also important to how

444
00:22:34,991 --> 00:22:41,877
players are able to engage within a match. So and again, having this data available also makes the

445
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:46,621
system much more quickly figure out how good our players are, so that when we're looking at those

446
00:22:46,621 --> 00:22:51,205
gaps in our data, they're more likely to represent an actual skill gap between our players.

447
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,501
Now, just to be clear here,

448
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:55,362
this is still just one number per system.

449
00:22:55,362 --> 00:22:57,764
We're not like using a whole bunch of extra numbers.

450
00:22:57,764 --> 00:23:00,105
We're not creating lots of extra buckets.

451
00:23:00,105 --> 00:23:05,328
Both of these systems boil down skill to just one number.

452
00:23:05,328 --> 00:23:07,069
So again, the takeaway there is

453
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:08,750
don't just discount skill gap

454
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,971
being important to your players.

455
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,932
Think about your skill system first

456
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,974
because which one you're using does matter.

457
00:23:14,974 --> 00:23:17,175
So let's do a recap of the importance of skill gap.

458
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:20,282
We've seen that personal skill gap is important in Halo 5.

459
00:23:20,282 --> 00:23:25,231
We found that we were able to get a four times drop in quit rates

460
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:27,495
by matchmaking carefully on that personal skill gap.

461
00:23:28,543 --> 00:23:30,704
Also, team skill gap is important.

462
00:23:30,704 --> 00:23:32,165
Fairness is important to our players.

463
00:23:32,165 --> 00:23:35,686
So both of those, both whether or not our players

464
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:37,026
are able to come around the corner

465
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:38,487
and have a chance of a good encounter

466
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:39,947
with an enemy opponent,

467
00:23:39,947 --> 00:23:41,788
and whether or not the match actually feels

468
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,248
like I can win as a player.

469
00:23:43,248 --> 00:23:44,949
Those are important to our players.

470
00:23:44,949 --> 00:23:47,029
We're able to have the quit rates drop

471
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:47,809
by about six that way.

472
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:51,010
Now you may ask which one matters more?

473
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,031
Well, the data tends to suggest players

474
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:56,612
are more sensitive to that team balance skill gap.

475
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:01,667
And luckily, team balancing ends up being a little easier as long as players aren't in full parties,

476
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:06,389
you can shuffle them around and get a good team balance, even if your initial matchmaking didn't

477
00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:10,270
come out as good. So it's a little bit easier, but yes, players tend to be more sensitive. You're

478
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:15,432
more likely to get a quit out of a match with a bad team gap in there, team skill gap.

479
00:24:15,432 --> 00:24:21,214
So find out which is important to you. Go look in your data, see which skill gap matters to

480
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:25,056
your players, and then use those graphs to tune how you're going to matchmake them.

481
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:29,300
And again, remember, your choice of skill system does matter.

482
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,802
Don't just discount skill because your skill system isn't detecting any sensitivity.

483
00:24:32,802 --> 00:24:38,725
Think about whether your skill system really is measuring what's important to your players.

484
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:43,028
So up to this point, we've been using whether or not a player will leave a match

485
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:46,610
to show us how important these different characteristics are, in this case skill so far.

486
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,696
The question is, can we go beyond though, just what happens in a match?

487
00:24:50,696 --> 00:24:54,060
Because maybe a player quits and maybe he goes and plays again.

488
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,583
Yes, it does kind of ruin the match for everyone else,

489
00:24:56,583 --> 00:25:00,127
but we still want to know, can we go beyond just a player leaving a single match?

490
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:02,770
And the answer is yeah, we can take a player,

491
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:05,173
we can observe them going into matchmaking,

492
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:06,735
they experience the gameplay.

493
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,652
Hopefully they're engaged, that personal skill gap is small,

494
00:25:10,652 --> 00:25:13,053
so they keep playing match after match.

495
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,534
Now, in theory, if that's not the case,

496
00:25:15,534 --> 00:25:17,274
they would stop playing for the night.

497
00:25:17,274 --> 00:25:20,975
They may finish the match, they may not even quit out of it,

498
00:25:20,975 --> 00:25:23,216
but because of their experience in that match,

499
00:25:23,216 --> 00:25:24,797
they may decide that they don't want to play

500
00:25:24,797 --> 00:25:25,957
any more Halo 5 that night.

501
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,897
And this is also important to us,

502
00:25:27,897 --> 00:25:29,338
maybe even more important,

503
00:25:29,338 --> 00:25:32,239
because if players are quitting not just out of matches,

504
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,919
but out of your entire game,

505
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,180
it's kind of ruining your population overall

506
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,400
and just making the game worse.

507
00:25:38,915 --> 00:25:41,277
So we want to go and measure this basically.

508
00:25:41,277 --> 00:25:44,438
We want to see, are players not quitting just the match,

509
00:25:44,438 --> 00:25:46,299
but do they leave for the night?

510
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:49,040
Because if, say, personal skill gap is important,

511
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,481
wouldn't they stop playing?

512
00:25:50,481 --> 00:25:51,922
So how do we do that?

513
00:25:51,922 --> 00:25:53,743
Well, we set it up very similarly

514
00:25:53,743 --> 00:25:55,303
to our other experiments already.

515
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:58,429
We get each of our players, we've got Alice here.

516
00:25:58,429 --> 00:26:00,690
We know what her team skill gap was for that match,

517
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,970
or we know what her personal gap was for that match.

518
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,571
And instead of asking, did they stop playing,

519
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:07,591
did they leave the match early?

520
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:09,932
We ask, did they stop playing for eight hours?

521
00:26:09,932 --> 00:26:12,973
Or did they take off and not show up again?

522
00:26:12,973 --> 00:26:15,313
And we look in this case that Alice had a match

523
00:26:15,313 --> 00:26:17,754
with a gap of 100 and she kept playing.

524
00:26:17,754 --> 00:26:20,514
Whereas Bob had a gap of 250 and he stopped playing.

525
00:26:20,514 --> 00:26:22,795
And we wanna average this over all of our population,

526
00:26:22,795 --> 00:26:23,875
our players, our matches.

527
00:26:24,456 --> 00:26:30,521
bucket it again and graph it and see if the skill gap not only causes quits out of matches,

528
00:26:30,521 --> 00:26:32,482
but does it cause them to quit out of the game?

529
00:26:32,482 --> 00:26:37,347
And it turns out it does cause them to leave the game for the night. As this personal skill gap,

530
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:42,371
that's what this one is, as the personal skill gap increases,

531
00:26:42,371 --> 00:26:48,136
so does the chance that a player will not only quit out of a match, but they may leave the game for the night.

532
00:26:48,677 --> 00:26:52,000
And this can go to be as high as a 40% chance

533
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,502
that a player is going to turn off the game for the night

534
00:26:54,502 --> 00:26:56,984
because of a large personal gap.

535
00:26:56,984 --> 00:26:59,607
Which means it's very important to our players

536
00:26:59,607 --> 00:27:02,329
to not have matches where they are so much worse

537
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,451
than the other team that they can't really engage.

538
00:27:04,451 --> 00:27:07,954
So let's look at the takeaway from that.

539
00:27:07,954 --> 00:27:09,916
The takeaways are kind of the obvious ones, right?

540
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:12,198
Players will disengage if the personal skill gap

541
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:12,899
is too large.

542
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:16,599
And we can again, use these graphs to tune

543
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:19,220
and pick what type of personal skill gaps

544
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,561
or team skill gaps are okay for our players.

545
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:25,902
And again, the nice thing about this is we can go beyond

546
00:27:25,902 --> 00:27:28,463
just looking at one match.

547
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:31,003
Now, I want to switch gears a little bit

548
00:27:31,003 --> 00:27:33,464
and talk about a more controversial topic

549
00:27:33,464 --> 00:27:36,405
that comes up once you start digging into this data.

550
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,626
And that deals around stacked parties.

551
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:41,027
The question here being,

552
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:44,907
you got what I call a pre-made stacked party.

553
00:27:44,907 --> 00:27:47,989
This is a group of four friends who are playing together in the party.

554
00:27:47,989 --> 00:27:51,290
When they go into matchmaking, they go in together, and that's fine.

555
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,772
The issue here is that these aren't just four

556
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:58,855
average players or even four very good players. These are like

557
00:27:58,855 --> 00:28:01,956
four of your best players. They've decided they're friends, they're going to

558
00:28:01,956 --> 00:28:05,718
get together and play, and what this causes is they will play

559
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:06,979
against another group

560
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:11,839
potentially, another pre-made group, a party of friends that are playing together,

561
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:17,120
and that party could be very good, but they're just nowhere near as good as that stacked party.

562
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,521
And what happens is that the stacked party will stop that pre-made party, beat them very badly,

563
00:28:22,521 --> 00:28:28,942
and this leads to, if we believe our data already, players disengaging. And not just disengaging

564
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:35,084
out of the match, because, and to be honest, players do quit less out of matches while

565
00:28:35,084 --> 00:28:37,024
they're in parties, like this good party here.

566
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,801
but it will still cause them to disengage

567
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,523
out of the game entirely, which is even worse.

568
00:28:42,523 --> 00:28:43,604
So what can you do about that?

569
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:45,005
Because it's, and I'll give you a hint

570
00:28:45,005 --> 00:28:46,185
that there's not a lot.

571
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:48,067
There's not a lot of great solutions

572
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:49,207
at this point to what you do.

573
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:52,870
You can ask yourself, well, should we just not allow

574
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,951
those stacked parties?

575
00:28:53,951 --> 00:28:57,773
Because they're gonna be scaring players out of our games.

576
00:28:57,773 --> 00:29:01,176
And if you do that, you end up making

577
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:02,156
some of your best players,

578
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:04,037
so you're making it so they can't play together.

579
00:29:04,037 --> 00:29:05,518
And that's probably gonna make them sad.

580
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:09,386
But if you allow the stacked parties,

581
00:29:09,386 --> 00:29:10,527
you're being unfair potentially

582
00:29:10,527 --> 00:29:12,207
to everyone else they play against,

583
00:29:12,207 --> 00:29:14,288
which is a much larger group than the small group

584
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:16,969
of stacked players that want to play together.

585
00:29:16,969 --> 00:29:20,110
And again, there's no super great solution here,

586
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:23,991
but I will just demonstrate what this can cause.

587
00:29:23,991 --> 00:29:25,552
So if you allow these stacked parties,

588
00:29:25,552 --> 00:29:26,712
at least I've observed in our data,

589
00:29:26,712 --> 00:29:30,293
I've gone and just watched some specific stacked parties

590
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:32,394
and seen what their effect on the population has been.

591
00:29:32,955 --> 00:29:36,936
you can actually watch a single party of four players

592
00:29:36,936 --> 00:29:38,696
scare away up to 20 players per hour.

593
00:29:38,696 --> 00:29:42,298
And the problem with that is the math just doesn't work.

594
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:46,199
If you ask yourself, is it okay that we allow four players

595
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:48,439
to play at the expense of 20 players per hour,

596
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:50,500
leaving your game entirely for the night?

597
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,881
The answer to that is usually that's probably

598
00:29:53,881 --> 00:29:54,461
not a good idea.

599
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:57,742
So what do people do about this?

600
00:29:57,742 --> 00:30:00,623
So in Halo 5, what we do is we just set our matchmaker

601
00:30:00,623 --> 00:30:02,063
to allow fair matches.

602
00:30:02,524 --> 00:30:03,885
and it won't allow unfair ones.

603
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,507
So if there's not a good match for that stacked player,

604
00:30:06,507 --> 00:30:08,129
they'll end up with a very long wait.

605
00:30:08,129 --> 00:30:11,451
This ends up being better for our population overall,

606
00:30:11,451 --> 00:30:13,593
but it can be very disappointing

607
00:30:13,593 --> 00:30:15,594
to those players who'd like to play together.

608
00:30:15,594 --> 00:30:18,076
Now, other games have similar solutions.

609
00:30:18,076 --> 00:30:23,120
League of Legends, you can also result in long wait times,

610
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,802
but if you're a solo or a duo player, just two of you,

611
00:30:25,802 --> 00:30:27,584
you can go into a solo-duo queue

612
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,366
and play only against solo players or players of two.

613
00:30:31,035 --> 00:30:34,077
But this doesn't protect your players that are in larger parties

614
00:30:34,077 --> 00:30:35,998
that also don't want to get stomped by those.

615
00:30:35,998 --> 00:30:40,980
And it does shard the population, resulting in slightly longer matchmaking for everybody.

616
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,201
Overwatch has another interesting solution.

617
00:30:43,201 --> 00:30:48,884
They basically say, no, if you are too good, you cannot play with your friends.

618
00:30:48,884 --> 00:30:51,165
They just won't even let you matchmake.

619
00:30:51,165 --> 00:30:53,787
They if you're a grandmaster and above in Overwatch,

620
00:30:53,787 --> 00:30:57,028
you're only allowed to queue either alone or with one friend.

621
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:05,434
And this also has some relation to what sports leagues do in order to keep matches more interesting.

622
00:31:05,434 --> 00:31:14,002
They add hard or soft salary caps to promote competition. They tell teams you can only spend

623
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:19,287
so much on your players in order to prevent these same types of issues. So it's not without

624
00:31:19,287 --> 00:31:23,091
precedent in general in competing. But again, there's no great solution here, but it is

625
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:24,772
something to think about.

626
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:28,158
What do you do with these stacked parties? How do you let them matchmake? How do they

627
00:31:28,158 --> 00:31:30,424
affect your population? It's worth digging into that data.

628
00:31:31,127 --> 00:31:33,990
Okay, so we've covered skill probably to death at this point.

629
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:37,352
We've looked at it from a lot of angles, quits versus leaving the game.

630
00:31:37,352 --> 00:31:40,575
And so let's get back to our other items we were curious about.

631
00:31:40,575 --> 00:31:41,856
What about latency?

632
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:45,099
Does high latency cause players to leave the game

633
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:46,840
or does it cause them to quit for the night?

634
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,342
And you know, the answer and the data to that was,

635
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:50,023
no, not really.

636
00:31:50,023 --> 00:31:53,946
It turns out for our players, they were not very sensitive to ping.

637
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,287
We didn't find a lot of quits.

638
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:58,590
We didn't see players that are leaving the game for the night.

639
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,550
Seemed to be a pretty.

640
00:32:00,226 --> 00:32:04,268
not that strong correlation. Now this may be because we have some safeguards on ping

641
00:32:04,268 --> 00:32:10,370
globally already, but we didn't find a lot of connections there. All right, so we'll cross

642
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:15,172
that one off for now. Now what about wait time? Do players get frustrated with lots of long waits?

643
00:32:15,172 --> 00:32:18,974
And with wait time, you can't do a quit thing. Most players don't tend to wait a while and that

644
00:32:18,974 --> 00:32:24,296
causes them to quit out of a match. But you can see if having long wait after long wait

645
00:32:24,296 --> 00:32:25,917
causes them to leave the night early.

646
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:28,888
And it turns out that no, we did not observe that.

647
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:33,289
We, our players didn't seem to mind even longer than usual wait times.

648
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:34,270
They would keep playing.

649
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,652
Their, the amount of time they would spend for the night did not seem very correlated

650
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:39,932
with how long their wait times were.

651
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:43,573
And what about losing streaks?

652
00:32:43,573 --> 00:32:45,434
Because this is something I hear a lot about.

653
00:32:45,434 --> 00:32:47,235
Almost any time I join a company

654
00:32:47,235 --> 00:32:49,376
and we talk about matchmaking, someone brings up,

655
00:32:49,376 --> 00:32:50,936
we gotta break losing streaks.

656
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:54,158
But you know, it turns out we did not see players

657
00:32:54,158 --> 00:32:57,719
tend to leave early because of a losing streak.

658
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:59,820
They would, the only thing that we found

659
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,261
that was correlated with a player

660
00:33:01,261 --> 00:33:03,842
that would scare them away for the night

661
00:33:03,842 --> 00:33:06,723
was whether or not the match itself was fair.

662
00:33:06,723 --> 00:33:10,305
A really unfair match, they would leave for the night

663
00:33:10,305 --> 00:33:11,225
because of that.

664
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:11,285
Bye.

665
00:33:11,883 --> 00:33:15,485
they were not likely, if they had a string of matches

666
00:33:15,485 --> 00:33:18,406
where they lost, that didn't tend to correlate

667
00:33:18,406 --> 00:33:21,648
with players leaving early for the night for quitting.

668
00:33:21,648 --> 00:33:24,610
So it may be that our players are just more concerned

669
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,391
with how fun the match itself was,

670
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:29,252
and the fact that they lost isn't as big of a deal.

671
00:33:29,252 --> 00:33:31,253
So it turns out, at least for Halo 5,

672
00:33:31,253 --> 00:33:33,995
what our players really seem to care about

673
00:33:33,995 --> 00:33:36,316
is that team skill gap, which is

674
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,731
Do I have a shot at winning this match?

675
00:33:38,731 --> 00:33:39,772
And the personal skill gap, which is,

676
00:33:39,772 --> 00:33:42,954
if I come around the corner and I see an enemy,

677
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,795
what will my success rate be in that encounter?

678
00:33:44,795 --> 00:33:47,017
Can I experience the gameplay?

679
00:33:47,017 --> 00:33:49,418
The other aspects that are commonly thought of

680
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:52,120
as important for matchmaking sort of fell off for us,

681
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,461
which kind of shows us that at least in Halo 5,

682
00:33:54,461 --> 00:33:57,183
we should focus on those team and personal skill gaps.

683
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,862
Now that doesn't mean we let latency be ridiculously bad

684
00:34:00,862 --> 00:34:02,543
or wait times crazy long,

685
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:05,704
but it means that our current sort of guidelines

686
00:34:05,704 --> 00:34:07,925
on those other objects are pretty on latency

687
00:34:07,925 --> 00:34:09,746
and on wait time are already pretty good.

688
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:11,627
And you should be able to discover this as well

689
00:34:11,627 --> 00:34:13,048
in your own data.

690
00:34:13,048 --> 00:34:14,648
So let's review the core approach

691
00:34:14,648 --> 00:34:16,329
that you would use to do that.

692
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:17,670
So again, choose a characteristic,

693
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,390
something that you think is important

694
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,531
or may be important to your players

695
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:21,672
and you wanna find out.

696
00:34:22,295 --> 00:34:25,998
Then choose a metric. What are you going to measure against that characteristic?

697
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:30,681
We used quit rates and we also used what players quit for the night.

698
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:35,445
So we compare, you go ahead on your own and compare whether a high ping results in quits

699
00:34:35,445 --> 00:34:36,907
or results in players churning out.

700
00:34:37,593 --> 00:34:39,554
and create those types of data points.

701
00:34:39,554 --> 00:34:41,275
So for every player, for every match,

702
00:34:41,275 --> 00:34:43,676
look at what that skill gap was, did they quit?

703
00:34:43,676 --> 00:34:44,797
Or what was the ping?

704
00:34:44,797 --> 00:34:46,798
And did they stop playing for the night?

705
00:34:46,798 --> 00:34:49,399
And bucket those up and plot those characteristics,

706
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:51,921
and then use those plots to tell you if it's important

707
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:53,121
and how important it is,

708
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:56,303
and at what points you're okay matchmaking.

709
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,504
At what cutoffs do you have in skill

710
00:34:58,504 --> 00:35:00,445
and in ping or whatever it may be.

711
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:05,108
And some overall sort of takeaways to think about.

712
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,261
First, what you think is important,

713
00:35:07,261 --> 00:35:08,862
what everyone's been telling you is important

714
00:35:08,862 --> 00:35:10,623
in matchmaking, it might not be important.

715
00:35:10,623 --> 00:35:13,184
It might be even more important.

716
00:35:13,184 --> 00:35:14,365
So use some observational studies

717
00:35:14,365 --> 00:35:17,026
to look through your data and find out what is important

718
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:19,607
and then tune your matchmaking to reduce quits,

719
00:35:19,607 --> 00:35:21,028
to reduce people leaving for the night,

720
00:35:21,028 --> 00:35:23,890
to reduce whatever metric you've chosen is important to you.

721
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:29,551
And don't forget, again, I'll just reiterate this,

722
00:35:29,551 --> 00:35:31,333
that when you're dealing with skill,

723
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:34,036
the skill system you use does matter.

724
00:35:34,036 --> 00:35:36,378
So reevaluate your skill system and make sure

725
00:35:36,378 --> 00:35:38,741
that it takes account of events in your game

726
00:35:38,741 --> 00:35:39,982
that are important to players,

727
00:35:39,982 --> 00:35:42,525
that gameplay is somewhere in there.

728
00:35:42,525 --> 00:35:44,827
That's sort of a, like, maybe a surprise takeaway

729
00:35:44,827 --> 00:35:47,270
for some of you, that your skill system

730
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,612
may not even be capturing that.

731
00:35:50,962 --> 00:35:53,804
Now, I talked a little bit about A-B testing,

732
00:35:53,804 --> 00:35:56,085
because I earlier mentioned that it can't be used.

733
00:35:56,085 --> 00:35:58,826
And the reason kind of why it can't be used

734
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:02,688
goes into some pretty complicated reasons.

735
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,009
I can't cover all of them in one slide,

736
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:08,470
but some research that Microsoft Research did

737
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,812
showed that the optimal skill gap to matchmake on,

738
00:36:11,812 --> 00:36:15,634
for example, depends on the population itself

739
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:17,134
at the time you're matchmaking.

740
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:20,536
The problem is an A-B test will split that population.

741
00:36:21,057 --> 00:36:26,263
So what you will learn from that A-B test is what is optimal for the way you've split,

742
00:36:26,263 --> 00:36:32,710
but that split may not be what the merged population is like. So you can't really do

743
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:37,796
that. You're learning the wrong optimal settings for the wrong population. So what you can do

744
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:41,120
instead, and what we're looking forward to trying at some point, is

745
00:36:42,178 --> 00:36:45,120
what you do is you flip a coin every hour

746
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,301
and choose every time you flip that coin

747
00:36:47,301 --> 00:36:48,422
whether to go with A or B.

748
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:49,682
And where A is like,

749
00:36:49,682 --> 00:36:51,283
A is how we're matchmaking right now

750
00:36:51,283 --> 00:36:52,804
and B is the new thing we want to try.

751
00:36:52,804 --> 00:36:54,085
You flip the coin

752
00:36:54,085 --> 00:36:56,026
because you need to have some randomness.

753
00:36:56,026 --> 00:36:58,208
You don't want to have like the time of day

754
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:00,989
be messing up, causing correlations in this data.

755
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:02,610
So you just flip that coin

756
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,091
over an extended period of time, every hour,

757
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:06,252
and you flip back and forth between these methods

758
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:08,774
and watch how the players react during those methods

759
00:37:08,774 --> 00:37:10,835
and then check your metrics between those

760
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:14,525
A and B the same way you would for any other A-B test.

761
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:19,068
That way you are measuring on the correct population.

762
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:19,748
And that is it.

763
00:37:19,748 --> 00:37:22,790
