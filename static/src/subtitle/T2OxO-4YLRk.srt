1
00:00:02,923 --> 00:00:03,164
All right.

2
00:00:04,084 --> 00:00:05,084
OK, I'm going to start the talk.

3
00:00:05,444 --> 00:00:07,525
You guys are in the Fallout 1 post-mortem.

4
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:11,826
I've been asked to ask you to silence your cell phones.

5
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:14,567
Please answer the review that will get mailed to you,

6
00:00:14,587 --> 00:00:16,188
the evaluation at the end of the talk.

7
00:00:16,888 --> 00:00:18,149
And I'm going to stop 10 minutes early

8
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:19,949
so people can ask questions.

9
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:21,470
If you want to ask a question, you

10
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,910
can just walk up to the mic on either one of the aisles.

11
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:25,951
My name is Tim Cain.

12
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,032
I worked on Fallout 1 when it was at Interplay

13
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:30,873
and for 3 and 1 1 from 94 to 97.

14
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,994
I was the producer, the lead programmer, and one of the several designers that were on the team.

15
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:42,418
I'm going to do a quick overview. I assume everybody is familiar with Fallout.

16
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,001
Fallout began development in very early of 94.

17
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:49,365
I don't exactly remember when development started,

18
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:52,007
because I was on actually assigned to other projects.

19
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:56,451
I was doing installers, critical sound handler, or critical error handlers,

20
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:58,333
sound code for games like Stone Keep.

21
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:00,721
In my spare time, though, I was working on an engine.

22
00:01:01,242 --> 00:01:02,442
That kind of grew into Fallout.

23
00:01:03,102 --> 00:01:05,023
I realized 94 is a long time.

24
00:01:05,783 --> 00:01:07,363
So to remind you guys what was going on,

25
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:11,285
the channel opened between England and France,

26
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:12,285
and it was very popular.

27
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:15,366
A large comet hit Jupiter.

28
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:16,926
Jupiter was okay.

29
00:01:18,587 --> 00:01:21,167
And Friends debuted on NBC, and was very popular,

30
00:01:21,407 --> 00:01:22,748
and Phoebe was my favorite character.

31
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,355
So, Fallout shipped in October of 97.

32
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:29,236
It took about 3 and a half years to make.

33
00:01:31,076 --> 00:01:32,916
To put you in the mindset, when it shipped,

34
00:01:33,256 --> 00:01:35,137
the games on the shelves were Total Annihilation,

35
00:01:35,157 --> 00:01:36,557
which was a top-down RTS.

36
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:40,058
Quake 2, the sequel to Quake 1,

37
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:42,878
very popular game, you may have heard of it.

38
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:45,939
And UO had just shipped.

39
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,059
And this is one of the first

40
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,980
pictures that comes up if you Google UO.

41
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,320
This is Lord British being pwned by a bunch of players.

42
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,391
The team size for Fallout, when we shipped,

43
00:01:57,531 --> 00:01:58,612
when we started, it was just me.

44
00:01:59,392 --> 00:02:00,733
When we shipped, it was about 30 people.

45
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:02,113
I say about 30.

46
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:06,295
It never really had a staff assignment in any official way,

47
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,176
and that's what I'll talk to you about in a few minutes,

48
00:02:08,456 --> 00:02:09,956
one of the challenges in getting this game made.

49
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:13,238
The total budget was about $3 million.

50
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:14,638
Again, I don't really know.

51
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:15,859
It never had a budget.

52
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,580
I never did budget work.

53
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,282
It never had really a development plan made for it.

54
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:25,030
It was very unusual the way Fallout was made.

55
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,771
It was not your typical Interplay game.

56
00:02:28,592 --> 00:02:29,972
At the time Fallout was being made,

57
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:31,913
Interplay owned several licenses,

58
00:02:32,494 --> 00:02:34,155
Star Trek and D&D,

59
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:36,316
and we had no license on Fallout.

60
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,037
In fact, we had no design spec on Fallout.

61
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,958
It was just me working on an engine.

62
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:43,300
We didn't use one of the many engines available.

63
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,681
We had the Infinity engine available to us from BioWare.

64
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:49,223
That was, we were beginning work on Torment.

65
00:02:50,298 --> 00:02:51,679
I just kind of wanted to make my own engine.

66
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,599
Nobody said no.

67
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,722
That's the way things worked at Interplay in the 90s.

68
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:57,523
So I just started writing an engine.

69
00:02:58,784 --> 00:03:00,005
There was no budget, like I said.

70
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:02,927
I was named the producer, but I really didn't go to producer meetings.

71
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:04,228
They called me a project leader.

72
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:06,850
That just meant that I had to write a report once a week,

73
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,751
saying what was going on.

74
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,532
But I didn't go to producer meetings.

75
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:11,253
I didn't write any reports.

76
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:14,396
And I didn't do anything but sit in my office and work on a game engine.

77
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:17,658
There was no staff, at least at the beginning.

78
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:19,479
Talk about how we staffed up.

79
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,381
A lot of work was done over pizza at night after people

80
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:24,101
were supposed to go home.

81
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:26,643
It was the only time I was allowed to talk to people,

82
00:03:26,903 --> 00:03:28,544
because they were assigned to other projects.

83
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:31,005
And other producers were getting upset if I came by and

84
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,426
talked to their guys about anything.

85
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:34,807
So what I would do is I would buy a pizza, go sit in the

86
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:35,548
conference room around 6.30.

87
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,529
And if anybody wanted to come in there and fall out, they

88
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:39,290
were welcome to do so.

89
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:42,018
There was no plan written for this game.

90
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:43,800
There was no specs written.

91
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,662
It was really a seat of the pants kind of development.

92
00:03:48,183 --> 00:03:50,205
So in this postmortem, I've divided it up

93
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:51,906
into several sections.

94
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:54,028
If there's a takeaway I want you to have, though,

95
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:56,890
it's that the team I worked with was absolutely amazing.

96
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:01,274
And I'll talk about them as I go through the postmortem.

97
00:04:01,314 --> 00:04:03,736
And I'm going to try to call out individual accomplishments

98
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:04,316
that people did.

99
00:04:04,697 --> 00:04:06,138
I tried to remember who worked on what.

100
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:10,736
feature and who thought of what cool idea that made it into the game and even a few that didn't.

101
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:16,217
But it has been 18 years, so I may not remember all of them and I know some people who worked

102
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:20,498
on it in the audience and they're going to keep me honest. The first thing I want to do, because

103
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:24,859
it's a common question I get asked, is what influences were there on the game? Why did we

104
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:30,260
end up making Fallout the way we did? I'll talk about books and games and movies that we really liked.

105
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:32,418
I'm going to talk about challenges.

106
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:36,700
The theme of this talk was almost the game that

107
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,022
was almost never made.

108
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:41,143
It was almost canceled twice, one of which

109
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:42,824
you may have heard about, one of which you almost certainly

110
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:43,104
didn't.

111
00:04:44,144 --> 00:04:47,346
It was just a very rocky road to get this game produced.

112
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,647
And finally, I'm going to try to, if I have time,

113
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:52,169
I'll talk about the legacy, some features I see in games now

114
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:54,630
that were not common at all when Fallout was made.

115
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,061
So let me start with influences.

116
00:04:57,141 --> 00:04:59,902
I broke those up into computer games, paper and pencil and

117
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:01,363
board games, books, and movies.

118
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:05,284
We were a very media spongy group.

119
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,045
People every day would talk about, I just saw this movie,

120
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:09,025
or I just read this book.

121
00:05:09,305 --> 00:05:10,446
And we're not even talking recent ones.

122
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:13,246
I have stuff going back to the 50s that people would come

123
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:15,127
and go, I just found this book in a used bookstore.

124
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,608
We've got to put a town in based on this book.

125
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:22,905
So the computer games, XCOM, and if you haven't played this game, it's wonderful.

126
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:28,090
We all loved the turn-based strategy, strategic combat in this game.

127
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:35,316
The first pass of Fallout actually had very XCOM-y type combat until we got the GURPS license,

128
00:05:35,656 --> 00:05:38,298
which I'll also talk about as a big challenge in making this game.

129
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:43,262
Crusader came out while we were making this game. It was one of the first 640x480 games.

130
00:05:43,282 --> 00:05:47,286
It was incredibly sharp compared to the 320x200 games coming out.

131
00:05:48,942 --> 00:05:52,966
It was a big influence on us and one of the reasons that Fallout was made 640x480 was Crusader.

132
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:58,170
Wasteland, of course, can't say this strongly enough.

133
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:01,813
Fallout is very much a spiritual successor to Wasteland.

134
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:05,797
Almost everybody who played the game or who worked on Fallout had played Wasteland.

135
00:06:06,297 --> 00:06:07,798
When we started, I had not played it.

136
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:10,701
So, of course, somebody gave me a copy, said go home this weekend,

137
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:12,903
and I was addicted to it, played it all the time.

138
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:16,726
It's kind of hard playing it on a more recent computer because it...

139
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:22,024
If you've ever tried playing and it goes too quickly, you have to put in a speed limiter.

140
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:24,805
Otherwise, you shoot across the screen when you try to play.

141
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:31,949
But this game had everything in it that we wanted to have in Fallout, including no strict morality like the Ultima games had.

142
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:40,673
We wanted the player to be good or evil, do anything he wanted, go anywhere he wanted, and be only really restricted by how skillful he was at playing the game.

143
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:45,923
And then, having mentioned the Ultima series as a game full of morality,

144
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:47,984
it was a big influence on our team.

145
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:50,586
For me especially, this is a picture of Ultima 3.

146
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:52,426
It was the first Ultima game I played.

147
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:55,508
I'd never played one or two, and it just stuck in my head as,

148
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:59,190
this is the way an RPG should be made.

149
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,251
And while Fallout doesn't have a lot in common with Ultima,

150
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:04,953
it really guided how I thought about making an RPG.

151
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:08,735
Paper and Pencil games, GURPS.

152
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:13,378
I'll talk about this later when I talk about legal challenges in making this game.

153
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:16,220
But as many of you know, Fallout was based on GURPS

154
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,902
for about the second and part of third year of its development.

155
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:23,644
And then we lost the license or we stopped using the license.

156
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:28,448
However, GURPS as a generic role-playing system really influenced our game

157
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:32,410
in thinking of classless, skill-based characters

158
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:36,273
and no longer giving people stereotypes to play in the form of character classes.

159
00:07:37,938 --> 00:07:38,438
WizWar.

160
00:07:39,178 --> 00:07:40,938
It's a great board game if you haven't played it.

161
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:42,179
It's a great beer and pretzel game.

162
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,919
What's fascinating about this game is every time you play it,

163
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,720
you shuffle the board pieces together.

164
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,640
And we would play this a lot every evening

165
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,621
while eating dinner, which we did at work a lot.

166
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:55,101
And we just loved the fact that we could play it every night.

167
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:57,162
And it felt like a completely different game, especially

168
00:07:57,182 --> 00:07:58,782
as we made additional cards and just

169
00:07:58,822 --> 00:08:00,983
extended the game well past what the original designer had ever

170
00:08:01,003 --> 00:08:01,343
intended.

171
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:05,443
And of course, Gamma World for all of you who.

172
00:08:06,196 --> 00:08:10,118
played this game, especially when it first came out in 1978. It was not the most balanced

173
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,942
RPG, but it was just really fun and had a really good spirit to it and we love the idea of

174
00:08:16,882 --> 00:08:21,025
mutations and the wide variety of things you could run into when you're playing the game.

175
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:26,508
As for books, there were three big books that influenced us. Canicle for Leibovitz,

176
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:29,690
excellent Hugo winning sci-fi novel.

177
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:35,074
basically about how people would cherish technology after a war occurred.

178
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:39,716
They were pretty much the, this was part of the basis for the Brotherhood of Steel in Fallout 1.

179
00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:45,018
The I'm Legend book, which turned into Omega Man, the Charlton Heston movie.

180
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:50,143
This book was how an individual would handle being the last,

181
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:52,424
thinking he was the last survivor on Earth.

182
00:08:52,944 --> 00:08:56,526
This is why in Fallout 1, when you're voted to leave the vault,

183
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:58,927
we really wanted that sense of isolationism,

184
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:02,148
that sense of, you're the only person out here in the wasteland

185
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,749
who's quote, a normal person,

186
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:06,590
and we wanted you to feel like special in that way.

187
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,792
And finally, there was a book and a movie called On Beach,

188
00:09:11,192 --> 00:09:12,833
which talked about how a community would...

189
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:19,231
survive past a nuclear war, thinking that they were the only community, and they were

190
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:23,333
very isolated. And then what happens when they do get approached, in this case it was

191
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:28,316
a US sub, beaches near this Australian town, and how those two groups interacted.

192
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:35,880
For movies, Road Warrior, that's a gimme. If you've played Fallout, you'll see the

193
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,442
jacket is in the game, the gun's in the game, the dog's in the game.

194
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:48,228
a boy and his dog. That wasn't the dog. This one basically had the underground vault. We

195
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:52,711
used to talk about how mutations didn't have to be obvious, because in this case, spoiler

196
00:09:52,931 --> 00:09:57,915
warning, the dog's telepathic. It's actually a bit smarter than Don Johnson. So we liked

197
00:09:57,935 --> 00:10:02,198
to talk about how all the mutations wouldn't be obvious. That didn't really make it into

198
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:06,041
the game. We decided to make the ghouls very obvious and the super mutants very obvious.

199
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:15,138
The day after, this is an 80 miniseries that talked about how rapidly civilization would collapse even the day after a bomb falls.

200
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:18,020
And that was something that's very much woven into Fallout.

201
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,943
We just assumed after the war there was no civilization left, that it was every man for himself,

202
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:29,128
and there would actually be few vestiges of civilization that would survive a nuclear war.

203
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:33,783
Forbidden Planet, this was especially the art director,

204
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:36,405
Leonard Barosky's idea that the robots in Fallout

205
00:10:36,465 --> 00:10:38,646
would be based, or all the technology would be based

206
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:41,307
on technology that the 50s projected into the future.

207
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:44,368
So that's how Fallout got explained to people

208
00:10:44,388 --> 00:10:45,308
who were coming onto the team.

209
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:47,389
We didn't want to see Terminator-style robots,

210
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:49,270
we wanted to see Robbie the Robot-style robots.

211
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,751
We wanted to see Forbidden Planet-style ray guns,

212
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:52,952
if we did ray guns at all.

213
00:10:54,172 --> 00:10:58,814
And we often went back to this movie as a visual touchstone.

214
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:01,935
One, though, that was far more important visually,

215
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:03,456
City of Lost Children.

216
00:11:03,656 --> 00:11:04,937
You may recognize that ocular.

217
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:08,178
It's the Power Armor ocular that's on the front cover of

218
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:08,919
the Fallout box.

219
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,361
The art staff fell in love with this movie and would play

220
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:17,684
it on continuous tape in their office.

221
00:11:18,184 --> 00:11:19,585
Just everything about this movie they loved.

222
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:24,067
The Steam-powered tech, how everything looked like it had

223
00:11:24,107 --> 00:11:25,348
large knobs and big dials.

224
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:26,808
And they wanted that look in Fallout.

225
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:29,865
And finally, there's an old still film,

226
00:11:29,985 --> 00:11:32,487
which means it's a film, but it's made up of mostly stills,

227
00:11:32,747 --> 00:11:34,167
called La Jetée, it's a French film,

228
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:35,708
which talks about how a civilization

229
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:39,650
would try to recover from a horrible disaster,

230
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,851
possibly nuclear, possibly biological.

231
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:44,672
The art director especially loved

232
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:48,033
the look of the technology in this movie,

233
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:49,954
and he would watch it frequently.

234
00:11:51,615 --> 00:11:53,656
Now, I wanna talk about the challenges in making Fallout.

235
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:56,657
There were a lot, and I tried to put them chronologically.

236
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,064
And then I realized they really broke down into four big groups that are quite different.

237
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:05,648
And that would be team challenges of how we structured the team as it grew and how we divided up work.

238
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:10,332
Design challenges, things we argued over when we were trying to make the game.

239
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:14,856
Technical challenges, which in the 90s, I hope I don't bore some of you,

240
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:19,841
are going to be talking about just the difficulties of writing to a Super VGA game

241
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:22,804
and dealing with 256 colors in a time where...

242
00:12:23,572 --> 00:12:27,556
that felt like that was an amazing amount and now we don't even have to think about such a small

243
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:33,101
number of pixels or such a small number of colors. And finally, I had a number of legal challenges

244
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:38,465
that hit the game, which almost prevented the game from shipping. So I'll talk to, I'll point

245
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:44,050
up the two times where the game was almost cancelled. So for the team challenges, the first

246
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:49,014
one is that we had absolutely no resources for this team. For the first six months it was just me

247
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:51,517
sitting in a room working on an engine.

248
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:55,616
I have no idea why this picture was taken. I have no memory of this.

249
00:12:56,597 --> 00:13:00,218
I know I was stressed. If you look carefully in the picture, you'll see three stress-relieving objects.

250
00:13:00,618 --> 00:13:08,781
My pink stress ball, a miniature tequila bottle with a sombrero, and a Tic action figure.

251
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:11,642
So this was probably just taken while I was working on Bugs.

252
00:13:13,382 --> 00:13:17,603
After six months, I got assigned a scripter and an artist, and they were both named Jason.

253
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:23,391
So people refer to us as Tim and the Jasons, which sounds like a really awful band name.

254
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:30,636
The artist, I had nothing to tell him to do because we hadn't picked a genre yet.

255
00:13:30,796 --> 00:13:31,716
All I had was an engine.

256
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:37,941
I'm also colorblind, so I couldn't even tell him this is the color palette I want you to do.

257
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:42,104
I think he ended up making rocks and trees and grass for a few months,

258
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:45,386
almost all of which we threw out because we don't have them in Fallout.

259
00:13:47,965 --> 00:13:50,846
Sometime at the beginning of year one, we really started to

260
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:51,466
get more people.

261
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:54,968
Many of these people worked during year one by coming

262
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:58,330
after work and just brainstorming with us, or try

263
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,791
to come up with setting ideas and try to make assets that we

264
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:03,392
could actually use in the engine I was making.

265
00:14:04,172 --> 00:14:05,893
During the second year, we actually ballooned up to

266
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:06,793
almost 15 people.

267
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:10,895
We gained our first lead designer, Scott Campbell, who

268
00:14:11,055 --> 00:14:13,076
I think left by the end of year two.

269
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:16,840
And then we got the lead designer off of Stonekeep,

270
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,201
Chris Taylor, and he took the game through to completion.

271
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,344
Most of the people are in here, but photographic records

272
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:24,865
of this era are spotty at best.

273
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:26,326
And I had to scour.

274
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,347
I have no photographs, and I had to scour the net even to

275
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:29,768
find this team group's photo.

276
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:34,370
Finally, in year three, we had about 30 people.

277
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:35,491
This is the majority of them.

278
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:38,193
There are a few people that aren't pictured that primarily

279
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:40,054
worked on Fallout, but were actually

280
00:14:40,074 --> 00:14:40,954
assigned to other groups.

281
00:14:42,475 --> 00:14:44,236
Fallout was not under Black Isle.

282
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:48,466
At the time, Black Isle got created in about the last eight

283
00:14:48,526 --> 00:14:50,947
months of Fallout's existence.

284
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:53,388
So Fallout was produced under Interplay's moniker,

285
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:55,229
and then Fallout 2 was done under Black Isle.

286
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:57,690
But Fergus provided us with a lot of people

287
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,712
right at the end to let us get a lot of assets

288
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:03,093
done that we otherwise wouldn't have had time to make.

289
00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:06,414
The early development of the game was really rough.

290
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:09,415
I actually have a video here of the original prototype.

291
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:13,709
with a bunch of art stolen from other games being developed

292
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:14,389
by Interplay.

293
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,031
This prototype actually is on the Fallout 1 disc.

294
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,652
If you look in an extras folder, you can actually play it.

295
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:23,154
I don't know why I included it.

296
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:24,815
Otherwise, just to show people what

297
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:26,035
the game would have turned out if it had just

298
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:26,916
been me for three years.

299
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:31,358
We had a lot of trouble conveying

300
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:33,499
the idea of this game to other people,

301
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:34,440
especially when we hired them.

302
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,401
In the first year, we didn't know what we were making.

303
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:39,863
After we did know what we were making.

304
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:43,939
The team expanded every year to be about double the size it was the year before.

305
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:47,841
It was hard to explain to those people, as well as to marketing, what Fallout was about.

306
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:50,342
We had a dark humor style that was hard to convey.

307
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:54,545
We had a sort of isolationist.

308
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:57,427
It didn't seem like the game would be fun when you described it to someone.

309
00:15:57,487 --> 00:15:58,407
It sounded so morose.

310
00:15:58,888 --> 00:16:00,829
But when they played it, they always thought it was a lot of fun.

311
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:04,371
And I had trouble expressing that to people, and especially administration,

312
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:07,013
who, at least on one occasion, just wanted to cancel it

313
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,394
because they thought it was too nebulous, what we were making.

314
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:11,767
So Chris Taylor made a wonderful vision statement

315
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:13,808
that I'm going to include in the,

316
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:15,149
it's not part of the PowerPoint,

317
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:16,950
but I'll include it in the docs that you can download

318
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,392
when you get the talk later.

319
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,213
But I included like a page of it here.

320
00:16:21,793 --> 00:16:23,855
He basically gave 15 reasons why you wanted

321
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:24,575
to play this game.

322
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,676
And he started with mega violence.

323
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:29,598
It goes on to there to things like

324
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,821
playing the game your own way,

325
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:37,068
deciding whether you wanted to be good or evil and living with

326
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:40,550
the consequences. That became very difficult later when we

327
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,713
were trying to explain why you could kill children. So I'll let

328
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:50,456
you read this on your own. So another challenge we had with

329
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,797
this team was we all worked very long hours because it was a very

330
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:55,979
small team. Most people didn't mind. In fact, most people just

331
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:58,361
came in and worked nights and Saturdays all on their own.

332
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:02,823
Where this became a problem was in the last, say, six months of this game,

333
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:07,828
we had to go into crunch mode, and since everybody was already working six-day weeks,

334
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:09,269
we started working every day.

335
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,792
For the last half a year it was being made,

336
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:15,355
people were pretty much at work every day for 12 to 14 hours a day.

337
00:17:15,816 --> 00:17:18,078
We joke about it now when I see some of those guys,

338
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:23,203
but there was like six months where I never saw a movie or a TV show, a grocery store.

339
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:27,456
A lot of people just started taking their clothes to

340
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:31,059
cleaners, because they weren't even home long enough to do

341
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:31,459
laundry.

342
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,162
You just lived with these people more than they lived

343
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:34,903
with their own families.

344
00:17:35,443 --> 00:17:39,147
It was awesome, because we were in our 20s and didn't

345
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:39,587
know any better.

346
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:42,270
I don't know if any of us could do that now.

347
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:46,414
An awesome thing I wanted to point out here, though, that

348
00:17:46,474 --> 00:17:49,417
happened was in the last six months of fall, it was being

349
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:49,837
developed.

350
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:55,529
A lot of the people who were in QA volunteered to come in on the weekends and work for free.

351
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,272
And this is in an environment where if you came in, if you were a QA member at Interplay,

352
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:05,415
you could come in on the weekend and get time and a half or even double time by working on assigned projects.

353
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,277
But these people would come in and work on Fallout for free.

354
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:13,540
I just wanted to point that out because I was flabbergasted that there were these guys who didn't make a lot of money

355
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,363
and they're like, nope, I'd rather get all the bugs out of your game than come in and work on the game I'm assigned.

356
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:19,744
And I just thought that was amazing.

357
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:23,493
So I want to talk about some of the design challenges we hit.

358
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:25,874
And I've hit upon this one a number of times already.

359
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:27,515
But basically, the setting for this game

360
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:28,896
was very elusive at the beginning.

361
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,617
That prototype you saw gave no hint for setting.

362
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:34,419
So we really wanted to do a fantasy game.

363
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,800
A lot of people came on board, said, oh, we can do something

364
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,021
that's better than D&D. We can do something that's

365
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:40,722
our own twist on fantasy.

366
00:18:40,762 --> 00:18:43,043
I think everybody who makes an RPG wants to do that.

367
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:48,285
We quickly threw that out because there were so many other fantasy games being developed

368
00:18:48,765 --> 00:18:53,666
and this is the one choice we made, unwittingly, that actually saved us from being cancelled the first time.

369
00:18:54,106 --> 00:18:55,386
And I'll talk about that in just a second.

370
00:18:56,967 --> 00:19:00,307
Our second idea was epic.

371
00:19:01,128 --> 00:19:04,648
You started in the modern world, you were thrown back in time,

372
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:08,129
you killed the monkey that would evolve into being humans.

373
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:14,235
You went through space travel, you went to the future that was ruled by dinosaurs, you

374
00:19:14,255 --> 00:19:18,379
were then exiled to a fantasy planet where magic took you back to the original timeline

375
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,062
that you restored to full and came back to the modern world to save your girlfriend.

376
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:27,807
It's weird even hearing me talk about it now, but we really were going to go with this.

377
00:19:28,648 --> 00:19:32,992
And I think one of the other producers kind of slapped me and said, there's no way you're

378
00:19:33,012 --> 00:19:34,033
going to get this storyline made.

379
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,194
It's not going to get approved.

380
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:37,266
you could work on it for years and no one would ever do it.

381
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,689
I sometimes wonder what it would be like if we had done this

382
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:42,253
game, and I believe Scott Campbell, the designer at the

383
00:19:42,273 --> 00:19:43,594
time, may still have it written down somewhere.

384
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:48,361
I'd love to see it, to see what we thought was cool 18 years

385
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:48,541
ago.

386
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:52,866
From that, though, we really liked the alien.

387
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,892
idea that was part of the whole space travel.

388
00:19:58,252 --> 00:19:59,213
And we all loved XCOM.

389
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:02,094
So we actually narrowed it down to a storyline involving

390
00:20:02,955 --> 00:20:05,356
aliens invading the planet and taking over the entire planet

391
00:20:05,396 --> 00:20:06,137
except one city.

392
00:20:06,557 --> 00:20:08,178
So you go back to that city, which is kind of your home

393
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:10,339
base, and you leave the city to go fight the aliens.

394
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,222
This isn't what we went with, but it was kind of what how,

395
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,203
I'm giving you an idea of how it morphed into Fallout.

396
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,564
The idea of the vault that you use as your home base, and you

397
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:20,585
went out into the wasteland.

398
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:24,195
We finally one day decided we wanted to try to do Wasteland

399
00:20:24,415 --> 00:20:26,016
2, so we went to post-apocalyptic, and we spent

400
00:20:26,036 --> 00:20:28,796
the next year trying to get the Wasteland 2 license from EA.

401
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:32,857
They never gave it to us, but we got so enamored with the

402
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:35,598
idea of making a post-apocalyptic game that we

403
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:37,198
couldn't stop working on it.

404
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:40,759
We just liked it so much that we just changed over all the

405
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:42,919
game to post-apocalyptic and said, well, we didn't get the

406
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:43,620
Wasteland license.

407
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,280
We're just making our own.

408
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,721
So we finally went post-apocalyptic.

409
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:54,028
This is when the first near cancellation occurred for

410
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:54,788
Fallout.

411
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:58,872
Interplay acquired the Forgotten Realms and the

412
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,494
Planescape D&D licenses in late 94.

413
00:21:02,455 --> 00:21:07,260
And at that time, Fallout came up at a producer meeting as

414
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,401
considered for cancellation.

415
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:11,263
Because at the time, it had only been in development for

416
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:11,664
less than a year.

417
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:12,885
They thought it was a B product.

418
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:15,547
In fact, the dirty little secret of Interplay was they

419
00:21:15,587 --> 00:21:17,309
considered it a B product up until the time it shipped.

420
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:22,706
They had thought once it shipped they were going to get all the people on the team and move them onto real projects.

421
00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:24,187
Like Descent to Undermountain.

422
00:21:26,547 --> 00:21:32,049
They also thought that Fallout was going to be way too competitive with the other games that were on the shelf.

423
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:41,532
They did not want to see their D&D games up there losing dollars to this side project effectively that Interplay was also working on.

424
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:46,173
So marketing was convincing Brian Fargo to cancel it because it was too competitive.

425
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:49,275
In the end, I went into Fargo's office and I basically begged.

426
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:53,058
I got down on my hands and knees and I begged him to let us make this game.

427
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:54,739
It was just a few of us.

428
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:56,180
I convinced him it was a tiny budget.

429
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,861
I didn't know it would get ballooned to 30 people.

430
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:02,584
And I showed him the work we had done.

431
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:04,285
And I'm amazed.

432
00:22:04,305 --> 00:22:08,107
He was, he, Brian has a lot of positive qualities.

433
00:22:08,247 --> 00:22:11,990
I didn't think he'd see from that prototype what we were going to end up with, but he

434
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,210
did.

435
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,431
And he ended up not canceling the game.

436
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:20,523
The second big design challenge we had was deciding what view to do.

437
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:24,925
At the time, first-person games were coming out and were considered super immersive.

438
00:22:25,726 --> 00:22:29,207
That word's been used now for a decade and a half and I'm still not sure what it means.

439
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:36,131
We wanted to go third-person because it was more strategic to play a turn-based combat system that way.

440
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:41,413
A lot of people call Fallout isometric, just to get really pedantic.

441
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,594
It's actually Cavalier oblique.

442
00:22:44,515 --> 00:22:45,195
You can see the...

443
00:22:47,273 --> 00:22:50,075
the tiles on the ground are not at a perfect 45 degree angle,

444
00:22:50,095 --> 00:22:51,475
they're actually tilted 30-60.

445
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:54,136
We did that for a reason when we laid down the hexes

446
00:22:54,177 --> 00:22:55,557
that we're actually going to put on the game.

447
00:22:56,878 --> 00:22:58,979
That put the hexes in a nice pattern

448
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:02,940
that made it easy to do calculations from mouse clicks

449
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,321
into hex space, which back then you didn't

450
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:06,302
have a lot of cycles to waste.

451
00:23:06,702 --> 00:23:08,303
And if we rotated them at this direction,

452
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:10,224
you could do it with just a division by two,

453
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:11,084
which we do with a shift.

454
00:23:11,802 --> 00:23:12,362
and some addition.

455
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:16,784
So we ended up picking that angle for that sole reason.

456
00:23:17,144 --> 00:23:18,404
And then the art director liked it

457
00:23:18,624 --> 00:23:20,845
because he thought buildings looked better at 3060

458
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:22,585
than at 45 degrees.

459
00:23:23,265 --> 00:23:24,425
So he bristled every time somebody

460
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:25,426
said we were an isometric game.

461
00:23:26,886 --> 00:23:28,487
So like I said, they were good for rotation.

462
00:23:28,647 --> 00:23:30,267
They're also really good for distance calculation.

463
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:31,987
You only have six rotations.

464
00:23:32,428 --> 00:23:33,648
You pick two points on the screen.

465
00:23:33,688 --> 00:23:35,708
It's very easy to calculate how many hexes are between them.

466
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,939
The worst thing about this was it's really bad for up and down movement

467
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:42,720
because you can only go along those six directions.

468
00:23:43,281 --> 00:23:45,542
People went up and down, they would wiggle back and forth.

469
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,523
We never really came up with a solution to that and we shipped with it.

470
00:23:48,903 --> 00:23:52,424
Obviously, people didn't think it was that awful, but the art director absolutely hated that.

471
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:56,306
And he wanted to go with a 12 rotation system,

472
00:23:56,666 --> 00:24:01,748
but then there's really no good way to make someone walk from one hex to a hex two up.

473
00:24:02,469 --> 00:24:03,549
So I nixed that.

474
00:24:05,663 --> 00:24:08,365
For anyone who played the game when it first came out, there was a game timer in it.

475
00:24:09,426 --> 00:24:12,709
The player to finish the first quest in a set time or the entire game would fail.

476
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:16,332
This was something that we put in to give the game a sense of urgency,

477
00:24:16,992 --> 00:24:19,154
but it was really controversial even among the team.

478
00:24:19,394 --> 00:24:21,136
Half of us loved it, half of us hated it.

479
00:24:21,656 --> 00:24:24,759
We would argue about it, we argued about it until the day it shipped,

480
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,043
and as soon as it shipped out the door, we made a patch that actually took that out.

481
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:35,384
If there's one thing I could go back in time and change, it would be to remove any timed quests from Fallout.

482
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:45,654
I just didn't like the false sense of urgency and I also felt like the player had this sense he had to rush through the game and miss fun things to do because of that stupid water chip timer.

483
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:50,053
A big problem we had, I told you, we were very much media

484
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,494
sponges on the team.

485
00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:54,737
Everybody wanted to put their own cultural reference stamp

486
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:57,559
into the game, whether it was a TV show they liked, or a movie

487
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,581
that they liked, or even other games they were playing.

488
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:01,623
They wanted to put little inside jokes in so that people

489
00:25:01,663 --> 00:25:03,244
playing the game would go, oh, I know what

490
00:25:03,264 --> 00:25:03,904
they're talking about.

491
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:07,227
I was worried that not only would we lose players when we

492
00:25:07,267 --> 00:25:10,810
had that, but RPGs tend to sit on the shelf for years, and I

493
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,911
was afraid we'd look dated.

494
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:15,714
So I made a rule, and the rule for that was, if you put in a

495
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:17,015
joke or cultural reference.

496
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:19,918
If the player didn't get it, they shouldn't even

497
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:22,240
know that that joke or cultural reference was being made.

498
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,783
And this image from, this is one of the perks

499
00:25:26,803 --> 00:25:27,564
you get for unarmed.

500
00:25:29,925 --> 00:25:31,586
If you hit someone, it automatically

501
00:25:31,606 --> 00:25:32,287
becomes a critical hit.

502
00:25:32,747 --> 00:25:33,548
It's called the Slayer.

503
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:37,150
That makes perfect sense to somebody who just is saying,

504
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,611
hey, well, that's a good name for someone who always

505
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:39,272
gets critical hits.

506
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:41,393
It's actually in that way because Chris Taylor was

507
00:25:41,433 --> 00:25:43,195
a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer

508
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,636
and wanted at least one perk in there with the name Slayer.

509
00:25:47,343 --> 00:25:50,205
Another example that probably nobody would know about, because

510
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:53,526
it's so deeply embedded, was Gizmo, which was one of the main

511
00:25:53,566 --> 00:25:58,668
characters who had voiceover and a nice 3D generated head. He

512
00:25:58,688 --> 00:26:00,988
was one of the people who could fight for control of a place

513
00:26:01,008 --> 00:26:03,349
called Junktown. Well, Gizmo is a good name for somebody running

514
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:06,030
a place called Junktown. A lot of people think it's a reference

515
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,812
to the movie Gremlins. It's actually an inside joke. It was

516
00:26:09,912 --> 00:26:13,773
the name of the skunk I owned when I was 12 years old. So now

517
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:16,214
you know. There's a ton of references like that.

518
00:26:16,763 --> 00:26:20,565
fallout but just being able to pull them out I probably don't even know most of the ones that

519
00:26:20,685 --> 00:26:25,287
my own team put in because like I said they buried them so deeply that unless you knew

520
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:28,409
what the inside reference was you'd never know it was even being made.

521
00:26:30,952 --> 00:26:33,013
Naming Fallout was very difficult. It was not named

522
00:26:33,053 --> 00:26:36,455
Fallout at the beginning, it was actually named Vault 13. In

523
00:26:36,535 --> 00:26:39,596
fact, the batch file for building the game always

524
00:26:39,636 --> 00:26:43,459
generated Vault 13.exe, and even after we renamed it, there was

525
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:46,240
just the last line of the batch file just said, copy Fallout

526
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,301
13.exe to Fallout.exe.

527
00:26:50,091 --> 00:26:51,052
We really like this name.

528
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:54,675
We thought it was science fiction-y and kind of

529
00:26:54,735 --> 00:26:55,255
mysterious.

530
00:26:55,776 --> 00:26:57,617
But marketing didn't like it because it didn't give any

531
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:58,758
sense of what the game was about.

532
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:03,082
They suggested things like Aftermath and Survivor and the

533
00:27:03,102 --> 00:27:07,126
wonderfully generic Post-Nuclear Adventure, which

534
00:27:07,206 --> 00:27:08,627
we actually put at the bottom for a while.

535
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,810
What really happened was Brian Fargo took the game home.

536
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,452
He's the president of Interplay.

537
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:17,294
He took it home and played it over the weekend and came back

538
00:27:17,514 --> 00:27:17,615
and.

539
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,923
put the CD on my desk and said, you should call it Fallout.

540
00:27:21,884 --> 00:27:23,125
And it was just a brilliant name.

541
00:27:23,406 --> 00:27:24,807
It was one word.

542
00:27:24,827 --> 00:27:26,188
We didn't think it would be abbreviated.

543
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,732
It captured the essence of the game.

544
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:32,134
And he was really good at naming games, by the way.

545
00:27:33,075 --> 00:27:35,918
So we actually switched the name Fallout just in probably

546
00:27:35,938 --> 00:27:37,820
like four or five months before the game shipped.

547
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:40,783
We did most of the box covers and stuff.

548
00:27:40,803 --> 00:27:41,443
I'll talk about that.

549
00:27:42,712 --> 00:27:46,414
We wanted to name the system as well, because at the time people were not only naming their games,

550
00:27:46,694 --> 00:27:49,235
but naming the system used in the game, and when we lost GURPS,

551
00:27:49,495 --> 00:27:52,276
everybody felt like we needed to have a name for the system.

552
00:27:52,957 --> 00:27:55,858
And since the system we eventually developed had these seven stats,

553
00:27:55,918 --> 00:27:59,279
agility, charisma, endurance, luck, intelligence, perception, and strength.

554
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,421
So I said, well, just put them in that order, and it spells A.C.E.L.I.P.S.

555
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:05,122
That'll be the name of our system.

556
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:10,509
That lasted a day until Jason Swinn, one of the other

557
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:12,709
designers, came in and said, you know, you can rearrange

558
00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:15,610
those letters to make the word special, and everybody liked

559
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,250
that a little better.

560
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:19,871
I've never forgiven him for that.

561
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:24,312
Diablo, fun game.

562
00:28:24,332 --> 00:28:25,193
I loved it.

563
00:28:25,853 --> 00:28:28,093
Thorn in my side, because it came out in 96.

564
00:28:29,494 --> 00:28:33,175
And it was real time, multiplayer, isometric RPG.

565
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:36,596
I had to go to lots of meetings with marketing

566
00:28:37,156 --> 00:28:37,916
and the administration.

567
00:28:37,956 --> 00:28:41,597
They wanted Fallout to be multiplayer and real time.

568
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:44,278
Now, we've been making it for two and a half years.

569
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:45,779
That was not going to happen.

570
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:48,040
But there were a lot of meetings,

571
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,240
and it came really close.

572
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,881
And it actually slowed down development for a while

573
00:28:51,301 --> 00:28:54,803
because we had to do feasibility studies of rewriting the code

574
00:28:54,823 --> 00:28:58,584
to make it real time and adding a network layer into the game.

575
00:28:59,683 --> 00:29:03,546
Finally, I persevered and even though there were severe doubts

576
00:29:04,646 --> 00:29:06,908
in the marketing projections for the success of the game,

577
00:29:07,348 --> 00:29:11,591
they let us stay with single player and turn-based.

578
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:14,453
So I'm going to jump into some of the technical challenges.

579
00:29:14,473 --> 00:29:16,875
This is a little more...

580
00:29:21,518 --> 00:29:22,538
It hasn't aged well.

581
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:23,799
Some of the problems I'm going to bring up,

582
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,320
people are going to go, why is this even an issue?

583
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:26,481
Flat memory.

584
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,811
Back when I started in 94, PC games were still made with 64K

585
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:35,992
chunks. So you had near and far pointers. You couldn't use a

586
00:29:36,032 --> 00:29:40,033
lot of memory. The problem was, since we chose a Super VGA mode

587
00:29:40,073 --> 00:29:44,914
we needed more than a 64K chunk. A new compiler came out, Watcom,

588
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:48,515
had flat mode. I chose to use it. It meant we didn't have to

589
00:29:48,555 --> 00:29:51,116
deal with expanded or extended memory, which if you ever play

590
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,856
old games, you know you have to tweak those memory drivers to

591
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:56,177
get that just right. We didn't have to worry about that. We

592
00:29:56,197 --> 00:29:57,937
also didn't have to worry about those near and far pointers

593
00:29:57,977 --> 00:29:58,257
anymore.

594
00:29:58,693 --> 00:30:01,315
The downside was all of the old code we had,

595
00:30:01,355 --> 00:30:02,676
we just had to rewrite or throw away.

596
00:30:03,477 --> 00:30:07,900
So most of the code in Fallout was written specifically

597
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,801
just for Fallout, except for a couple pieces

598
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,722
that I'll call out later that we grabbed from other games.

599
00:30:12,783 --> 00:30:13,864
Mainly because we couldn't go back

600
00:30:13,904 --> 00:30:16,285
to the old library of interplay stuff and pull out code.

601
00:30:18,687 --> 00:30:20,809
We picked Super VGA, which at the time was amazing,

602
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:21,029
640, 480, 256 colors.

603
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:22,049
I mean, who could ever want more?

604
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,562
My artists wanted more. They actually made all of the sprites

605
00:30:29,782 --> 00:30:32,664
using alias and they made it high resolution and they made it

606
00:30:32,684 --> 00:30:37,466
with 16 bit color. That meant we had to take those, all the

607
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:40,528
animations they did, all the 3D models, reduce them down to

608
00:30:40,568 --> 00:30:44,830
sprite files in 6 rotations and cut out the colors, reduce the

609
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:49,373
colors from 16 to 256. But then they wanted color cycling, so we

610
00:30:49,393 --> 00:30:52,915
had to take like 16, 20 colors out of that so we could reserve

611
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,675
for color cycling so we actually were down to like 230 colors.

612
00:30:57,985 --> 00:31:07,053
And then there was another problem we ran into with Super VGA, which is every video card that was manufactured had a different way of doing 640, 480, 256 color.

613
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:12,298
Not just the video card, you had to know what chipset was on the video card. So if somebody said I have a Trident...

614
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:16,509
card, you had a Trident 9600, you had to know did you have a

615
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:20,470
Trident 9600 chipset A, chipset B, or chipset C. And they all

616
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,691
bank switched Super VGA in a different fashion.

617
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:24,851
And you had to write the bank switch separately.

618
00:31:25,171 --> 00:31:26,652
And detecting the cards were very difficult.

619
00:31:26,672 --> 00:31:28,532
Sometimes you just had to ask the person when they started

620
00:31:28,572 --> 00:31:30,933
up the game, what card do you have in your machine?

621
00:31:31,513 --> 00:31:32,253
People didn't know that.

622
00:31:32,813 --> 00:31:36,034
Luckily, in late 94, VESA came out, standardized Super VGA.

623
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,194
We rewrote all of our code to that standard.

624
00:31:41,449 --> 00:31:42,930
is the reason probably the game runs today.

625
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,832
It's because we go through these standardized interrupts.

626
00:31:44,992 --> 00:31:46,093
I doubt if you could play the game

627
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:49,716
if you had to pick an old video card off of a list of 20

628
00:31:50,637 --> 00:31:52,579
and hope that it matched whatever the modern specs were.

629
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:55,402
We chose sprites, obviously.

630
00:31:56,683 --> 00:31:58,324
We originally thought about doing it polygonally,

631
00:31:58,445 --> 00:32:00,226
but the test we did couldn't give us

632
00:32:00,246 --> 00:32:01,127
the level of detail we wanted.

633
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:06,969
Having this many sprites, it led to an incredibly large footprint, and it was difficult to caching them in.

634
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:12,092
To this day, that's why Fallout sometimes chugs, just because it has to load in a sprite before it can display it.

635
00:32:13,493 --> 00:32:18,896
Polygons were just starting to become popular, and believe it or not, we actually argued whether the industry was going to go polygonal or not.

636
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:23,939
People thought, no, sprites are just the way they're always going to do it. Polygons are a fad.

637
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:25,900
Obviously, that was wrong.

638
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:32,131
The talking heads, when you're playing the game and you see those heads that pop up and

639
00:32:32,171 --> 00:32:34,133
they're wonderfully detailed and they have voiceover.

640
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:38,076
This was Leonard Borowski's idea, but they were pretty much implemented by another artist

641
00:32:38,116 --> 00:32:39,037
named Scott Rodenheiser.

642
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:48,486
Scott would actually form a clay head, heat it in a kiln, and then he would sit there

643
00:32:48,526 --> 00:32:53,430
with a 3D scanner, a point scanner, and hit point by point by point by point by point

644
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:53,831
on this head.

645
00:32:54,346 --> 00:32:58,710
for hours, days at an end, until we had a 3D model which looked like the one on the upper left there.

646
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:03,654
Then we would add the polygons, add the color and light it.

647
00:33:04,134 --> 00:33:10,660
That entire process on here, just to go from the clay model to the one on the bottom right, took about 8 weeks.

648
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,544
And then it was another 2 or 3 months to get all the phoneme matching done for all the voiceover that was done.

649
00:33:15,924 --> 00:33:19,788
It was probably 4 man-months per head, which is why we only had, I think, a dozen.

650
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,469
There was no way we could put more in.

651
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:25,389
We wanted the original design, I think we wanted 40 or 50 of them.

652
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:27,871
But after we did a couple, we realized that was not going to happen.

653
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:33,214
Followers were not in the original spec for the game,

654
00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:35,775
and we had no time to code it when the idea came up that,

655
00:33:35,815 --> 00:33:37,757
hey, why don't we have these guys follow you around and help you out,

656
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:38,877
especially in tough areas.

657
00:33:39,498 --> 00:33:44,601
So the scripters on the team decided they could do it all in scripting.

658
00:33:47,052 --> 00:33:49,535
We put in a few, I think dog meat was the first one,

659
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:50,557
and then we added Ian.

660
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:52,679
We sent it to QA, and QA loved it.

661
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:53,460
It tested really well.

662
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,502
It's one of the best features we ever had,

663
00:33:54,522 --> 00:33:56,624
because people imagined that it was like this.

664
00:33:57,145 --> 00:33:58,266
This is what it was like when they were fighting

665
00:33:58,306 --> 00:34:00,068
through the wasteland with their follower.

666
00:34:00,349 --> 00:34:01,510
When in actuality, it was more like that.

667
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:04,443
And if you ever had Ian in your group

668
00:34:04,463 --> 00:34:07,145
and you let him have the Uzi, he would shoot it in burst mode.

669
00:34:07,185 --> 00:34:08,746
And he didn't care where you were standing

670
00:34:08,906 --> 00:34:10,227
or where the other followers were standing.

671
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:13,350
And we never fixed that because it wasn't done in code.

672
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,494
And there was just no way to expose the appropriate AI

673
00:34:18,434 --> 00:34:18,915
to script.

674
00:34:19,075 --> 00:34:20,296
We literally didn't have the time to do it.

675
00:34:20,776 --> 00:34:22,338
So that's why the AI is what it is.

676
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:23,679
And I'm kind of embarrassed about that.

677
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,363
This is one of my funnest technical challenges we had.

678
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:32,357
One day, I forget who it was at Interplay,

679
00:34:32,377 --> 00:34:33,297
somebody came and said, hey, we want

680
00:34:33,317 --> 00:34:36,939
to put the Windows 95 logo on the bottom of the box

681
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:38,940
so people know it's Windows 95 compatible.

682
00:34:39,701 --> 00:34:40,701
And I said, sure, that's not a problem

683
00:34:40,721 --> 00:34:42,662
because we tested it on every platform that was out.

684
00:34:42,803 --> 00:34:47,105
And Windows 95, WinNT, there were some other Windows

685
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:47,945
we tested it on.

686
00:34:48,506 --> 00:34:49,446
And it all worked fine.

687
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:52,528
But we failed cert because it worked on.

688
00:34:53,101 --> 00:34:56,823
Windows NT. I want to repeat that. We failed certification

689
00:34:56,843 --> 00:35:01,045
for 95 because it worked on Windows NT. Now, what the

690
00:35:01,085 --> 00:35:04,567
certification said was, it should fail gracefully on

691
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:09,830
Windows NT. And I remember calling Microsoft and saying, it

692
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,293
fails so gracefully that it doesn't fail at all. And they're

693
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:17,334
like, nope, you can't do that. So Chris Jones, the other lead

694
00:35:17,414 --> 00:35:20,016
programmer, he just recoded the installer to fail.

695
00:35:21,215 --> 00:35:23,936
It would detect that you were on NT and just stop.

696
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,661
In hindsight, it was really good he did this because all the

697
00:35:33,721 --> 00:35:36,342
Windows that came out, all the Windows platforms that came out

698
00:35:36,422 --> 00:35:40,705
after 95 were based on NT. So nothing, you could never play

699
00:35:40,745 --> 00:35:43,746
Fallout after 95 if we didn't make sure that hand

700
00:35:43,786 --> 00:35:45,847
installations still worked. You could just copy all the files

701
00:35:45,887 --> 00:35:47,128
over by hand and they'd work just fine.

702
00:35:51,704 --> 00:35:57,047
We wanted a Mac version. We started with a DOS version, then we had a Windows 95 version.

703
00:35:57,368 --> 00:36:04,832
We wanted a Mac version, and it turned out I had put all the OS-specific calls in one set of functions

704
00:36:04,852 --> 00:36:09,534
that I bound up into a library, which meant Fallout really isn't written to run on DOS or Windows 95.

705
00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:13,137
It calls a library called GNAW, which stands for GNAW is Not Windows.

706
00:36:14,057 --> 00:36:16,198
And everything would go through that.

707
00:36:16,993 --> 00:36:19,975
The Mac was literally developed in a weekend.

708
00:36:20,475 --> 00:36:23,297
One of the Mac programmers went home, rewrote the Ganal

709
00:36:23,317 --> 00:36:24,999
library for Mac, and we brought it back, and we had

710
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:25,719
Macintosh running.

711
00:36:25,779 --> 00:36:27,100
He took it home Friday.

712
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,822
We had Mac running on Monday.

713
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,724
He was too busy to come over on the team, so I hired one

714
00:36:33,084 --> 00:36:34,925
Mac developer, and he's responsible for everything

715
00:36:34,965 --> 00:36:36,306
that went in to the Mac side.

716
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:37,187
He did the installer.

717
00:36:37,227 --> 00:36:39,509
He made sure that the features worked, the assets worked.

718
00:36:40,509 --> 00:36:42,531
He also did something that you probably have never heard

719
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:45,253
about, and I insisted upon, because I'm stupid.

720
00:36:46,052 --> 00:36:48,774
I wanted the save games to be interchangeable among all three

721
00:36:49,254 --> 00:36:53,077
platforms, DOS, Windows 95, and Mac, meaning you could be

722
00:36:53,097 --> 00:36:55,439
sitting at Windows 95, save your game out to a floppy,

723
00:36:55,819 --> 00:36:58,701
pull that floppy out, walk into a Mac machine, put that

724
00:36:58,721 --> 00:37:02,144
floppy in, and load it onto a Fallout Mac there, and it

725
00:37:02,164 --> 00:37:05,306
would run, which meant he had to do all the big Indian,

726
00:37:05,326 --> 00:37:06,788
little Indian swapping on the save game.

727
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,333
I don't know why I wanted this. Nobody ever used it. It was in

728
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,775
the manual. Nobody has ever come up to me and said I'm so happy

729
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:16,037
you put in interchangeable save games. And it made Tim Hume's

730
00:37:16,097 --> 00:37:21,660
life just hell. And I've apologized to him for that. Let

731
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,183
me jump quickly to the legal challenges. I'll talk about one

732
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:27,264
that you've probably all heard of.

733
00:37:28,132 --> 00:37:30,553
Fallout was originally based on the GURPS license. We got it

734
00:37:30,593 --> 00:37:33,736
during our second year. I was the one who really wanted it. I

735
00:37:33,756 --> 00:37:36,758
played GURPS all the time. I loved that system. I thought

736
00:37:36,778 --> 00:37:39,359
it would be great to have a GURPS RPG finally on the market.

737
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,201
However...

738
00:37:42,284 --> 00:37:45,147
Probably by the end of the second year, maybe the beginning of the third,

739
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:49,393
there was problems with them not liking the level of violence in the game.

740
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:51,195
We were very violent.

741
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,337
They didn't like the art style.

742
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:58,664
Those skill deck cards with the cartoons on it, they hated those.

743
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,468
And actually it was literally too late to change any of these things.

744
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:04,691
We thought we were going to be done in six to eight months,

745
00:38:04,731 --> 00:38:06,032
it was actually going to be a little more than a year,

746
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:07,754
but we just couldn't possibly change it.

747
00:38:09,035 --> 00:38:11,938
So at this point, I figured we were going to be cancelled.

748
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,624
The discussions with Steve Jackson Games went above my pay grade.

749
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:21,228
So it went into closed door meetings over the administration building.

750
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:24,109
And the word coming out was that we were canceled.

751
00:38:24,489 --> 00:38:27,290
And we were going to be moved to Torment or Descent

752
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,210
of the Undermountain or the other D&D games being made.

753
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,751
But what happened was, GURPS was torn out.

754
00:38:34,191 --> 00:38:37,272
I was asked to rewrite the GURPS combat system.

755
00:38:38,572 --> 00:38:41,113
Chris Taylor was given about a week to redesign it.

756
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:42,653
And I was given a week past that to code it.

757
00:38:43,253 --> 00:38:45,554
And if we could do that, then we would not be canceled.

758
00:38:46,214 --> 00:38:48,255
So I'm not exactly sure how we did it.

759
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:50,335
My memory of that period is very vague.

760
00:38:52,149 --> 00:38:53,410
I know we drank a lot of soda.

761
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,471
We were there all the time.

762
00:38:55,812 --> 00:38:56,813
I know we smelled bad, too.

763
00:38:56,913 --> 00:38:57,614
But we did it.

764
00:38:57,954 --> 00:39:00,076
In two weeks, we redid all the combat sim skill system.

765
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:04,279
And Chris did the entire Fallout game that you're

766
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:07,362
playing, with the exception of perks, were done in two weeks.

767
00:39:11,665 --> 00:39:12,566
Music, really briefly.

768
00:39:13,106 --> 00:39:14,528
The ink spots, which you're hearing at the beginning.

769
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:19,276
We wanted that in the game because it was a nice 1940s,

770
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:20,677
50s sounding group.

771
00:39:20,977 --> 00:39:23,759
It was also my grandfather's favorite group and the first

772
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:26,220
concert my mother attended when she was six years old.

773
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,682
We went to EMI and we wanted, excuse me, Baby, I Don't Want

774
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:31,482
to Set the World on Fire.

775
00:39:31,983 --> 00:39:36,445
They wanted a ton of money for it and they would negotiate

776
00:39:36,465 --> 00:39:37,145
very slowly.

777
00:39:37,705 --> 00:39:39,486
All I remember is several months went by before we

778
00:39:39,506 --> 00:39:40,727
finally heard back that we weren't going to get it.

779
00:39:41,247 --> 00:39:42,588
So we ended up just picking a new one.

780
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:45,536
not quite at random, but really quickly off their back catalog.

781
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:46,197
It's called Maybe.

782
00:39:46,757 --> 00:39:48,418
And it turns out that when you actually

783
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:50,659
play the ending, the starting and ending movie, the Fallout,

784
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:52,841
actually seems to fit the tone a lot better.

785
00:39:53,421 --> 00:39:55,182
If you listen to the words, it's about somebody wondering

786
00:39:56,223 --> 00:39:57,964
if the other person is going to miss them when they're not

787
00:39:57,984 --> 00:39:59,705
around anymore, which is perfect for Fallout.

788
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:03,026
We had trouble with ratings.

789
00:40:03,546 --> 00:40:04,527
I don't know why this was.

790
00:40:04,547 --> 00:40:09,209
We were submitted for T. We never said we were T. A few

791
00:40:09,229 --> 00:40:12,991
specs we had caught out our mega levels of ultraviolence

792
00:40:13,051 --> 00:40:15,872
and blood and drugs and violence and prostitutes.

793
00:40:17,653 --> 00:40:22,216
They saw that, of course, and said, you can't have T. And

794
00:40:22,556 --> 00:40:23,476
boom, we got an M rating.

795
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:25,097
We didn't mind that.

796
00:40:25,737 --> 00:40:29,359
I think marketing was worried it would reduce the people who

797
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:30,260
would be able to buy it.

798
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,311
This led to the child killing controversy.

799
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:35,293
We allowed it.

800
00:40:35,913 --> 00:40:37,534
We just said, look, we're going to have kids in the game.

801
00:40:37,594 --> 00:40:42,657
If you shoot them, it's a huge penalty to karma.

802
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:43,958
You're really disliked.

803
00:40:44,979 --> 00:40:46,620
There are places that won't sell to you.

804
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,820
There are people who will shoot you on sight.

805
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:49,882
And we thought people can decide what they want to do.

806
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,264
There was a small problem with that, in that if you ever did

807
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,025
a burst mode with a gun, you sometimes shot

808
00:40:55,065 --> 00:40:55,885
children inadvertently.

809
00:40:57,851 --> 00:41:01,114
This of course contributed to our M rating. However, Europe said no.

810
00:41:02,295 --> 00:41:04,957
They wouldn't even sell the game if there were children in the game.

811
00:41:05,077 --> 00:41:08,480
We didn't have time to read all the quests. What we just did is we just deleted kids off the disc.

812
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,303
So, things are there that reference children, but you never see any children.

813
00:41:14,245 --> 00:41:18,308
If I have time, I'm going to try to really briefly go over what I think are some of the legacy of Fallout,

814
00:41:18,328 --> 00:41:19,549
some of the things that I see in other games.

815
00:41:20,992 --> 00:41:25,793
that we shipped in 97. It was really seen at Interplay as a big risk that paid off.

816
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:30,635
This is what was said to me constantly by people, even though I don't really think it

817
00:41:30,895 --> 00:41:34,376
cost that much. I'm not sure what the risk was that they took, but that's the phrase

818
00:41:34,396 --> 00:41:37,998
I always heard. But when I played games over the next few years, I started seeing a lot

819
00:41:38,018 --> 00:41:43,680
of things that Fallout had in them, so I thought I wanted to look at it. We always said we

820
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,480
wanted an open world.

821
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:50,002
caught at that before the word sandbox came out. I think if Fallout was made today, people would

822
00:41:50,022 --> 00:41:54,866
say, what's a sandbox game? We just said, we don't care where people can go. They can go anywhere

823
00:41:54,886 --> 00:41:59,230
they want. If they go into some area that's too strong for them, they'll get killed. And then

824
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,633
they'll learn not to go in there yet. And they'll look forward to the challenge of being able to go

825
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:02,753
back.

826
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:06,521
We wanted a non-linear story so the player could choose

827
00:42:06,561 --> 00:42:08,942
wherever he could go and the story would still unfold.

828
00:42:09,222 --> 00:42:11,744
And so the onus was on us for making sure that stories could

829
00:42:11,764 --> 00:42:12,444
unfold that way.

830
00:42:12,945 --> 00:42:15,186
And what we did was we said every quest in the game and

831
00:42:15,206 --> 00:42:17,187
all the story arcs that occurred in the game had to

832
00:42:17,247 --> 00:42:18,308
have multiple solutions.

833
00:42:18,748 --> 00:42:20,409
And the mantra we always said was there should be a way to

834
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:22,411
fight your way through it, there should be a way to talk

835
00:42:22,451 --> 00:42:25,152
your way through it, and there should be a way to sneak your

836
00:42:25,172 --> 00:42:25,573
way through it.

837
00:42:25,813 --> 00:42:26,954
And sneaking wasn't just stealth.

838
00:42:27,034 --> 00:42:30,476
It could be sneaking up behind a, or walking up behind a

839
00:42:30,516 --> 00:42:32,557
guard, pickpocketing the key, and then using that to get in

840
00:42:32,577 --> 00:42:32,717
trouble.

841
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:35,661
through an unguarded area in the back.

842
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:38,863
We always made sure that at least two of these were available in all the quests,

843
00:42:38,903 --> 00:42:40,785
and usually all three on the main quests.

844
00:42:42,129 --> 00:42:44,431
Because of that, we came up with the idea of multiple endings.

845
00:42:44,651 --> 00:42:46,813
So the game would actually track whenever you did something in the game,

846
00:42:46,853 --> 00:42:48,274
we'd store off that you had done that thing.

847
00:42:49,135 --> 00:42:52,838
And the quests and short story arcs in the game

848
00:42:53,078 --> 00:42:54,299
would have different endings based on that.

849
00:42:54,479 --> 00:42:55,880
And then when the game ended itself,

850
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,921
that's when we came up with the idea of,

851
00:42:57,102 --> 00:42:58,463
hey, we're going to show you slides and say,

852
00:42:58,803 --> 00:42:59,824
because you acted this way,

853
00:43:00,084 --> 00:43:01,705
here's what's happening to these people that you,

854
00:43:02,086 --> 00:43:03,947
you know, have been playing this game with for 40 hours.

855
00:43:03,967 --> 00:43:06,469
You know, here's what happened to the people of Junktown or Shady Sands or The Hub.

856
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,090
And some of them were pretty horrific.

857
00:43:08,231 --> 00:43:09,971
They were like, you know, these people all died

858
00:43:10,031 --> 00:43:12,253
because you took their only source of water from them.

859
00:43:12,793 --> 00:43:15,615
And we heard later that people would get these slides

860
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:16,575
and then they'd replay the whole game

861
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:17,676
because they didn't want to see that slide.

862
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:18,656
They couldn't live with the idea

863
00:43:18,716 --> 00:43:20,737
that they'd killed off an entire population.

864
00:43:21,918 --> 00:43:22,318
I like that.

865
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:24,699
We didn't like morality.

866
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,380
Like I said, I loved Ultimate Games,

867
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,562
but I felt like they imposed too much of a

868
00:43:28,622 --> 00:43:29,542
you will be a good person.

869
00:43:29,942 --> 00:43:31,803
And I'm like, I don't mind if people want to play badly.

870
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:33,424
I just want them to live with the consequences

871
00:43:33,464 --> 00:43:34,085
of whatever they do.

872
00:43:35,167 --> 00:43:36,428
This was a big thing in the game.

873
00:43:36,568 --> 00:43:38,708
It came right out of the Wasteland quest

874
00:43:39,108 --> 00:43:40,689
where you're trying to help the little boy

875
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:42,929
at the very beginning, the little orphan who's lost his dog,

876
00:43:43,129 --> 00:43:44,670
but when you find the dog, the dog is rabid

877
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:47,130
and you have to kill the dog. I love that quest

878
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,411
because it made the player feel bad

879
00:43:49,531 --> 00:43:50,891
and made them wonder, did he do a good thing

880
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:51,811
or did he do a bad thing?

881
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:53,772
I love that kind of stuff in games.

882
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:56,672
The perk system, like I told you,

883
00:43:56,712 --> 00:43:58,813
Chris Taylor made their entire game except for perks

884
00:43:58,873 --> 00:44:00,973
in two weeks. Brian Fargo took the game home,

885
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,774
played it for a weekend, came back and said

886
00:44:02,794 --> 00:44:03,474
I love it except...

887
00:44:04,185 --> 00:44:06,667
When I go up a level, skill points aren't enough for me to do.

888
00:44:07,307 --> 00:44:09,289
So Chris said, hey, I have an idea what we could do.

889
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:13,933
We're going to make a perk mesh of cool things you can add to your character

890
00:44:13,973 --> 00:44:15,795
based on prerequisites of what's already in your character.

891
00:44:16,155 --> 00:44:17,196
It was really easy to code.

892
00:44:17,376 --> 00:44:20,199
It was very successful.

893
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:22,080
QA loved that they could make characters

894
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,402
that were different than the guy sitting right next to him in QA.

895
00:44:24,442 --> 00:44:26,104
And they could play the game very differently because of it.

896
00:44:27,735 --> 00:44:29,996
And I think Chris thought of it in a day,

897
00:44:30,016 --> 00:44:31,077
and I implemented it the next day.

898
00:44:31,117 --> 00:44:33,739
So we literally had perks in two days after Fargo said,

899
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:34,920
there's not enough in here.

900
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,142
And he was playing it again the next weekend,

901
00:44:37,182 --> 00:44:39,403
and he said, great, this is exactly what I want in a game.

902
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:44,787
I miss that rapidity of iteration in game development.

903
00:44:47,189 --> 00:44:49,010
Years later, I was working on Temple of Elemental Evil,

904
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:53,313
and the guys from WOTC told me that the perks in Fallout

905
00:44:53,453 --> 00:44:55,715
influenced the feats in D&D version three.

906
00:44:56,726 --> 00:45:00,009
And then somebody told me later that the specs in WoW

907
00:45:00,029 --> 00:45:02,310
were influenced by the feats in D&D version 3.

908
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:05,493
So I like to think that this all just weaves its way

909
00:45:05,513 --> 00:45:06,073
through the industry.

910
00:45:06,394 --> 00:45:08,635
And of course, perks were added to Oblivion and Skyrim

911
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:11,558
after the Fallout license went to Bethesda.

912
00:45:11,578 --> 00:45:14,560
So I like to think that there's a little tiny piece of that

913
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,061
in the Bethesda games as well.

914
00:45:18,363 --> 00:45:18,963
Called shots.

915
00:45:20,044 --> 00:45:21,565
We added those because we really liked the variety

916
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:22,366
they added to combat.

917
00:45:22,446 --> 00:45:24,368
You could have one attack mode.

918
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:27,235
But you could see different effects on a creature,

919
00:45:27,255 --> 00:45:28,016
depending on where you shot them.

920
00:45:28,036 --> 00:45:29,316
You might shoot their leg out and they're crippled,

921
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:30,417
or you shoot them and they blind them.

922
00:45:30,697 --> 00:45:31,857
It also let us get our humor in.

923
00:45:32,157 --> 00:45:34,058
If you check any called shot screen in Fallout,

924
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,519
there's usually one that's a little funnier.

925
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:36,999
I think this is the one with the,

926
00:45:37,259 --> 00:45:38,000
you can shoot them in the utter.

927
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,641
There's always a groin-based one.

928
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,922
In robots, it was called the hydraulic activator.

929
00:45:46,934 --> 00:45:48,635
We decided to put the faces of EO in.

930
00:45:48,655 --> 00:45:50,157
That really struck a chord with people.

931
00:45:50,197 --> 00:45:51,678
They really felt more connected to the game

932
00:45:51,718 --> 00:45:53,380
when they could see these really detailed faces

933
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,341
and they heard famous actor voices coming out of them.

934
00:45:55,882 --> 00:45:58,404
They were, it was one of the best feedbacks

935
00:45:58,424 --> 00:45:59,105
we got from the game.

936
00:45:59,145 --> 00:46:00,386
And people said they wanted to see more of it.

937
00:46:00,827 --> 00:46:01,748
Really expensive to do.

938
00:46:02,128 --> 00:46:03,729
Not just for the CG,

939
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:06,532
but also getting these actors into the studio.

940
00:46:07,153 --> 00:46:09,235
But I think it was worth it and paid off.

941
00:46:10,576 --> 00:46:11,937
Ambient music, I'm a huge fan of it.

942
00:46:12,218 --> 00:46:12,618
I didn't want,

943
00:46:13,785 --> 00:46:16,225
standard game music in Fallout, I kind of wanted something,

944
00:46:16,245 --> 00:46:17,626
and I think I wrote this next one wrong,

945
00:46:17,686 --> 00:46:18,666
I didn't want something you listen to,

946
00:46:18,706 --> 00:46:19,586
I wanted something you heard.

947
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:21,507
Something you would play the game and miss

948
00:46:21,547 --> 00:46:23,968
when it wasn't there, but not necessarily be humming it

949
00:46:24,528 --> 00:46:25,168
while you were playing.

950
00:46:25,488 --> 00:46:27,769
And I wanted to underscore that the game was desolate

951
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:31,670
and have a sad undertone to the thing.

952
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:34,171
Again, marketing wasn't sure, they came to me a few times

953
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:35,471
and said, are you sure you want this music?

954
00:46:35,491 --> 00:46:36,632
Because it's kind of depressing.

955
00:46:37,492 --> 00:46:38,892
And I said, if you play the game,

956
00:46:39,693 --> 00:46:41,093
everybody's dead in the world, you know,

957
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:41,913
it should be depressing.

958
00:46:44,113 --> 00:46:52,660
The development process that I think paid off really big is that vision statement that Chris wrote was really great at getting all these people on the same page when we were talking about the game with them.

959
00:46:54,822 --> 00:47:02,249
We also ended up, did reuse software. That OS abstraction library was awesome. It really paid off. It went into about a dozen other interplay games after Fallout shipped.

960
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:10,096
It was in games as diverse from Starfleet Academy to Max to Atomic Bomberman. I mean, just wildly different games all used that.

961
00:47:11,242 --> 00:47:13,264
We ended up using a movie player that was written in-house

962
00:47:13,364 --> 00:47:16,087
and was used in a lot of different interplay titles

963
00:47:16,147 --> 00:47:16,468
as well.

964
00:47:17,169 --> 00:47:19,411
We also ended up pulling a script engine out

965
00:47:19,752 --> 00:47:21,113
of Starfleet Academy.

966
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:22,895
When we gave them the abstraction library,

967
00:47:22,935 --> 00:47:24,417
we took their script engine, and then

968
00:47:24,457 --> 00:47:26,099
that percolated to a bunch of different games as well.

969
00:47:27,933 --> 00:47:31,334
The last thing I want to talk about, the game. We treated Fallout as an experience from the

970
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:34,536
moment you saw the box, which was fashioned to look like something you would find in the

971
00:47:34,556 --> 00:47:37,298
world of Fallout. It was supposed to look like a lunch box. I'm not sure that ever came

972
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:42,040
across. The manual was a survival guide that was issued to you when you were born in the

973
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:45,342
vault. It was things like, you know, when you eventually get outside, how will you deal

974
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,143
with radiation and viruses and giant rats?

975
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:52,952
This is not the Interplay logo.

976
00:47:53,012 --> 00:47:55,873
We redid it because we thought it fit the 50s style

977
00:47:56,953 --> 00:47:57,413
of the game.

978
00:47:57,434 --> 00:48:01,415
This got adopted and put in most of the Interplay games

979
00:48:01,455 --> 00:48:02,915
that shipped subsequent to Fallout.

980
00:48:04,456 --> 00:48:05,616
The interface itself was designed

981
00:48:05,636 --> 00:48:09,197
to look like old found pieces of technology from the game world.

982
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,758
Our splash screens themselves look like things you'd find.

983
00:48:11,778 --> 00:48:13,819
This was a comic book that I don't

984
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,779
know why someone would make a comic book about the Vault

985
00:48:15,799 --> 00:48:17,300
Dweller being attacked, but there he is.

986
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:18,940
Even our web page.

987
00:48:19,999 --> 00:48:23,562
There was no division of the company that worked on web

988
00:48:23,582 --> 00:48:25,043
pages, so we just took it over and made our own.

989
00:48:25,244 --> 00:48:27,866
We made it look like found old art.

990
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:31,469
There was a guy on the team who did the level design, Scott

991
00:48:31,529 --> 00:48:32,230
Everits, for the game.

992
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:34,271
And then he'd turn around at night, and he'd do all of our

993
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:35,112
web page design.

994
00:48:36,653 --> 00:48:38,715
And that's one thing I want to tell everybody.

995
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:40,216
This team was amazing to work with.

996
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:41,658
They were incredibly talented.

997
00:48:42,138 --> 00:48:44,640
They worked really long hours, just insane hours.

998
00:48:45,149 --> 00:48:47,111
And there weren't a lot of egos on the team.

999
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,812
If you ever find yourself on a team like this, stay with it.

1000
00:48:51,594 --> 00:48:53,095
And we all were making the same game.

1001
00:48:53,535 --> 00:48:54,536
And I've worked on different games

1002
00:48:54,576 --> 00:48:56,357
since then that maybe not everybody on the team

1003
00:48:56,397 --> 00:48:57,358
was trying to make the same game.

1004
00:48:57,498 --> 00:48:59,059
Everybody who worked on Fallout was making

1005
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:01,100
the exact same kind of game.

1006
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,583
There was no disagreements, for the most part, maybe

1007
00:49:04,603 --> 00:49:06,804
the time request, about what kind of game we're making.

1008
00:49:06,844 --> 00:49:08,185
And that was just an awesome experience.

1009
00:49:08,425 --> 00:49:09,386
And it's something I actually miss.

1010
00:49:10,687 --> 00:49:14,089
So if anybody has any questions, that was Fallout 1.

1011
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,342
Start with you.

1012
00:49:26,582 --> 00:49:27,543
So my question is...

1013
00:49:29,965 --> 00:49:30,506
Is his mic on?

1014
00:49:30,546 --> 00:49:35,310
Yeah, but still not on, right? I'll speak really loudly.

1015
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:38,573
So I heard that the ending to Jumptown got changed

1016
00:49:38,593 --> 00:49:42,137
and it was more morally ambiguous.

1017
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:42,557
Yeah.

1018
00:49:44,904 --> 00:50:05,313
You said it was changed because it was too morally ambiguous by someone in a number of powers. In hindsight, do you feel that was the right call? Or would you, if you could have it, go back and change that? Would you have that in the game?

1019
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:16,862
did poorly under the Sheriff Killian.

1020
00:50:17,863 --> 00:50:20,985
And QA kind of liked it.

1021
00:50:21,306 --> 00:50:22,186
I kind of liked that, too.

1022
00:50:22,647 --> 00:50:25,049
We were worried we led people down the wrong path, though,

1023
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:27,571
and that, hey, I'm fighting really hard to make this,

1024
00:50:28,532 --> 00:50:29,813
to do the right thing, and then I'm

1025
00:50:29,873 --> 00:50:31,154
punished when the game ends.

1026
00:50:31,735 --> 00:50:33,936
So I'm not sure I'd change that, but I would probably.

1027
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:38,340
put in more indications that if I were to change it, I would put in more indications

1028
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:41,700
that helping this seemingly bad guy would be a good thing.

1029
00:50:42,861 --> 00:50:44,601
It was just, it was too random.

1030
00:50:44,801 --> 00:50:45,901
I think that's why it got changed.

1031
00:50:46,821 --> 00:50:47,181
Thank you.

1032
00:50:47,441 --> 00:50:47,521
Sure.

1033
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:47,621
Okay.

1034
00:50:48,782 --> 00:50:48,882
Okay.

1035
00:50:48,902 --> 00:50:59,564
I wanted to touch on the child killing controversy a little bit.

1036
00:51:05,267 --> 00:51:12,171
So I wanted to poke at the child killing thing a little bit more

1037
00:51:12,251 --> 00:51:18,035
because these days it's basically a given that if a

1038
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:23,178
player controlled character in any game can harm or especially

1039
00:51:23,278 --> 00:51:28,321
kill a minor, the ESRB treats that as an automatic adults only

1040
00:51:28,381 --> 00:51:31,243
rating. It's basically the equivalent of hardcore porn.

1041
00:51:33,745 --> 00:51:42,418
Did you guys get a lot of static and threats from the ESRB of the era of that scale? Or do you

1042
00:51:42,438 --> 00:51:47,565
think Fallout kind of pushed for that? Or, you know, basically I'm wondering how much

1043
00:51:48,347 --> 00:51:51,730
sort of drama there was behind that choice?

1044
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:54,371
It didn't cause much drama for the US rating.

1045
00:51:55,092 --> 00:51:56,753
People saw it and said, well, that's M.

1046
00:51:57,093 --> 00:51:57,854
But I mean, you have to remember,

1047
00:51:57,874 --> 00:52:00,295
there was a lot of violence in the game.

1048
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:02,657
It was just considered part of the genre.

1049
00:52:03,858 --> 00:52:05,739
In the US, we see movies like that all the time.

1050
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,441
Overseas, it's completely flip-flopped.

1051
00:52:09,802 --> 00:52:12,904
In America, we see a lot of sex and violence,

1052
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:14,785
but we don't see, like, nudity.

1053
00:52:15,746 --> 00:52:16,967
In Europe, it's the exact opposite.

1054
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:22,911
I don't care about frontal nudity, but the level of violence just, I would say, disappoints

1055
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:25,834
them that our movies tend to be childish like that.

1056
00:52:27,195 --> 00:52:28,316
I think it fit Fallout.

1057
00:52:28,376 --> 00:52:30,978
I thought it would be okay to have it in Europe.

1058
00:52:31,218 --> 00:52:37,103
Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of it, but there had been a shooting or something

1059
00:52:37,143 --> 00:52:39,685
happened in Europe right before Fallout was rated.

1060
00:52:40,899 --> 00:52:45,601
I don't remember what the tragedy was, but that pretty much made the entire ratings board there just go,

1061
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:50,743
we won't even consider it. It wasn't dramatic, it was like, you won't have this game, or we'll rate it,

1062
00:52:51,764 --> 00:52:56,786
whatever that rating is that you have to go into the store and ask for them to pull it out from under the shelf in a brown paper bag.

1063
00:52:57,987 --> 00:53:00,288
We didn't want that, so we just took the kids out.

1064
00:53:01,028 --> 00:53:02,029
Okay.

1065
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:07,771
Yeah, I'd like to ask about the team's approach to player choice.

1066
00:53:08,817 --> 00:53:14,360
and just, was there any systematic design to it or just kind of ad hoc?

1067
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,063
The closest we got to a system was for every main story quest.

1068
00:53:19,183 --> 00:53:21,584
If you had to go through that quest to get to the end of the game,

1069
00:53:23,545 --> 00:53:27,568
we would play through it and I played the game from start to finish five times and then a ton of...

1070
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,609
not quite playthroughs besides that.

1071
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:33,251
And everybody on the team did that.

1072
00:53:33,491 --> 00:53:34,672
And if they ever found a main story quest

1073
00:53:34,692 --> 00:53:36,874
that they couldn't finish because they made a character

1074
00:53:36,894 --> 00:53:39,197
that was so extreme that they couldn't fight,

1075
00:53:39,437 --> 00:53:41,019
talk, or sneak their way past,

1076
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:43,381
we would go and take one of those three methods

1077
00:53:43,601 --> 00:53:45,163
and make it much easier.

1078
00:53:45,183 --> 00:53:47,465
I mean, sometimes it was as easy as, you know.

1079
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:52,173
the person who had the key, who was standing by the front gate

1080
00:53:52,213 --> 00:53:54,034
and there was a locked door in the back of the building,

1081
00:53:54,335 --> 00:53:55,275
had a perception of one.

1082
00:53:55,295 --> 00:53:57,097
I mean, he would never, ever see you steal,

1083
00:53:57,357 --> 00:53:58,758
no matter how bad your pickpocketing was.

1084
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:03,382
On the side quest, however, I usually let people relax it.

1085
00:54:03,462 --> 00:54:04,723
If there's only one or two ways through,

1086
00:54:04,743 --> 00:54:05,824
and if they were kind of difficult,

1087
00:54:05,864 --> 00:54:07,785
that was OK, because side quest didn't have to be done.

1088
00:54:08,206 --> 00:54:09,326
And that was as close as we got.

1089
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:11,969
But like I said, we worked together so closely

1090
00:54:12,009 --> 00:54:14,230
that we all had almost the same mindset of how

1091
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,272
to put together a quest, that there were never really

1092
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:17,293
a lot of arguments over that.

1093
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,287
that just kind of flowed out.

1094
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:25,510
Hi, did you have a working name for, I guess,

1095
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:28,052
what later became the Vault Boy,

1096
00:54:28,072 --> 00:54:30,453
that became embraced by the public

1097
00:54:30,493 --> 00:54:31,774
as the mascot for Fallout?

1098
00:54:32,094 --> 00:54:34,415
Did you get that character, was that created

1099
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,336
just sort of on a whim at like the last minute,

1100
00:54:36,376 --> 00:54:37,917
or was there a lot of iteration

1101
00:54:37,957 --> 00:54:38,797
during the development of that,

1102
00:54:38,837 --> 00:54:40,078
and did you realize at the time

1103
00:54:40,218 --> 00:54:43,159
that that would just kind of personify your game

1104
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,040
and later become like a mascot, a symbol of it?

1105
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:47,061
Are you talking about the one on the perc?

1106
00:54:47,629 --> 00:54:50,010
Yeah, the little cartoon guy with a 13 who's always been on these cards.

1107
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:52,132
Because people sometimes call the Pip-Boy Fall Out Boy.

1108
00:54:52,152 --> 00:54:52,973
And I'm like, no, that's not him.

1109
00:54:53,053 --> 00:54:55,235
That's the guy with the yellow and red cape on the Pip-Boy.

1110
00:54:56,476 --> 00:54:59,798
When I first saw the drawings that the lead artist had done,

1111
00:54:59,878 --> 00:55:02,160
I was a little surprised because they reminded me of Monopoly cards.

1112
00:55:02,521 --> 00:55:04,382
But they really did fit the game really well.

1113
00:55:04,402 --> 00:55:06,644
They had a great sense of humor, especially when you read, like,

1114
00:55:06,964 --> 00:55:10,607
here was a card saying, you know, you can viciously kill someone with a backstab.

1115
00:55:10,887 --> 00:55:14,470
And then there's this funny cartoon of someone slicing someone in two from behind.

1116
00:55:14,831 --> 00:55:15,911
And it had that fallout.

1117
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:20,066
cheekiness of, look, everything's going to be OK.

1118
00:55:20,086 --> 00:55:23,087
The things we had in the vault literature of, yeah, the

1119
00:55:23,107 --> 00:55:24,868
world's been destroyed, but we're OK.

1120
00:55:24,928 --> 00:55:27,689
And here's how you cook rats to make delicious meals.

1121
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:31,071
It just had that vibe of, we're not taking this very

1122
00:55:31,091 --> 00:55:32,512
seriously, and you should be happy.

1123
00:55:33,352 --> 00:55:35,773
So I think it kind of spread.

1124
00:55:35,793 --> 00:55:37,754
The team itself had absolutely no problem with it.

1125
00:55:37,774 --> 00:55:40,555
We were a little surprised when Steve Jackson Games

1126
00:55:40,575 --> 00:55:43,236
didn't think it fit the game, because I

1127
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:44,577
thought it was wonderful.

1128
00:55:44,637 --> 00:55:46,298
We didn't know how much it would take off, though.

1129
00:55:49,417 --> 00:55:54,240
So you just mentioned cheekiness and I think that dark humor which you also touched on is one of

1130
00:55:54,261 --> 00:55:58,083
the things that I and a lot of other people love about the game. Can you talk a little bit about

1131
00:55:58,123 --> 00:56:03,747
the writing process of creating those jokes and also the process of communicating that sort of

1132
00:56:03,807 --> 00:56:07,890
ineffable sense of humor to a team of people, some of whom understand it better than others?

1133
00:56:08,642 --> 00:56:13,845
Well, I think the original designer on the game, Scott Campbell,

1134
00:56:14,285 --> 00:56:17,406
he kind of laid out all the different areas in the game.

1135
00:56:17,927 --> 00:56:20,528
And so later on when people went through and wrote up the dialogues,

1136
00:56:20,728 --> 00:56:22,789
and a lot of the dialogues, by the way, weren't written by designers.

1137
00:56:23,209 --> 00:56:25,850
Some of them were, but we had such a big diverse group

1138
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:28,351
that when the artist would finish doing their art,

1139
00:56:29,112 --> 00:56:31,193
and it would take a long time for it to get processed,

1140
00:56:31,393 --> 00:56:32,613
they'd sit there and they'd write dialogues.

1141
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:37,711
I remember they were watching all these dark movies and everybody was on the same page.

1142
00:56:37,771 --> 00:56:40,472
So when somebody would write something, often you'd hear, I'd hear people laughing next

1143
00:56:40,492 --> 00:56:44,113
door and I'd go over and they were just looking at scripts, dialogue scripts and laughing.

1144
00:56:44,453 --> 00:56:45,854
There was some editing that went through it.

1145
00:56:46,634 --> 00:56:49,455
The reason I can't speak more about it is I'm really bad at writing dialogue.

1146
00:56:49,475 --> 00:56:50,196
That's what I learned.

1147
00:56:50,216 --> 00:56:51,536
That's why I don't do it anymore.

1148
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:55,558
So I'm not exactly sure what the process was, but.

1149
00:56:56,614 --> 00:56:59,595
because everybody was so close, I don't think that they had a

1150
00:56:59,736 --> 00:57:02,698
formal process. They just shared a lot with each other and people

1151
00:57:02,718 --> 00:57:05,199
were willing to change things. If they wrote up a dialogue and

1152
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:07,281
people didn't get it or didn't like it, they'd just rewrite it.

1153
00:57:10,282 --> 00:57:12,704
I don't have actually a real question. I just want to tell

1154
00:57:12,744 --> 00:57:18,268
you thank you. And probably my best memory of a video game is

1155
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:21,650
in Fallout 2 when I get back in time, touch a computer and I

1156
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,071
think I just broke the water chip.

1157
00:57:23,718 --> 00:57:24,598
It's an awesome moment.

1158
00:57:24,638 --> 00:57:25,619
So thanks a lot.

1159
00:57:25,979 --> 00:57:26,379
You're welcome.

1160
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:30,941
One more?

1161
00:57:31,221 --> 00:57:32,421
We only have time for one more question.

1162
00:57:34,042 --> 00:57:38,544
My question was, in Fallout 2, the quests were a little more robust.

1163
00:57:40,257 --> 00:57:44,842
harder to break. And I wondered whether that was simply production changes, you know, better

1164
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:48,026
testing, or whether that was a difference in tool chain.

1165
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:53,253
Well, I'd actually left Interplay before Fallout 2 went out, but I do know that it pretty much

1166
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:57,939
was the same engine. Actually, the car was working, I think, before I left. So it was

1167
00:57:57,999 --> 00:57:58,420
really that...

1168
00:57:59,272 --> 00:58:01,654
you had a group of people and they'd all used those tools for years.

1169
00:58:02,094 --> 00:58:04,836
So it was very easy to go back and make a whole bunch of new content

1170
00:58:05,197 --> 00:58:07,799
with tools that weren't evolving

1171
00:58:08,259 --> 00:58:10,622
and had a lot of the major bugs taken out of them.

1172
00:58:10,642 --> 00:58:12,423
So I think Fallout 2 was just a lot faster to make.

1173
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,845
And also there were some new influx of people who

1174
00:58:15,346 --> 00:58:17,788
had really cool ideas for things that could be done with the engine

1175
00:58:17,888 --> 00:58:20,390
that we didn't see maybe necessarily because we were so close to it.

1176
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:21,931
So it had that great mix of

1177
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:25,495
established tools where people know how to use them and some new people who were just...

1178
00:58:26,334 --> 00:58:28,018
they got the humor and they got everything spot on.

1179
00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:29,701
And I think that's why Fallout 2 actually

1180
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,810
scored higher on its review ratings than Fallout 1.

1181
00:58:35,594 --> 00:58:35,835
Thank you.
