1
00:00:07,797 --> 00:00:11,244
Thank you so much for coming, especially because there's a Zelda talk next door.

2
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:12,767
So if you're here, I feel very honored.

3
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:15,112
I'm sure you're all going to watch it on the wall.

4
00:00:16,114 --> 00:00:17,317
Let's talk about marketing money.

5
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:20,177
Okay, let's dive right in.

6
00:00:21,077 --> 00:00:23,978
Today's talk is about how to budget your indie games promotion campaign.

7
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,461
And the main reason why I'm giving this talk is because it's one of the most asked questions when I talk to indie devs.

8
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,702
It's self-published for the first time.

9
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:36,204
They talk to publishers, they want to understand budgeting, and also people that just make their first commercial game.

10
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:44,488
To be honest, when I started writing this talk, I pretty quickly figured out why there isn't that much online resources about that specific topic.

11
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:53,960
In my research I found a picture that pretty much like summed up what it feels like trying to make a talk about indie games marketing budgeting and not to be dramatic but it's quite similar to that.

12
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,913
Because really, when you ask, what is a good marketing budget, you might as well ask, how long is a piece of string?

13
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:06,094
It's a question that's super hard to answer.

14
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:10,617
And it wasn't easy to give a default cookie cutter solution.

15
00:01:11,277 --> 00:01:14,799
So I hope in this talk, I can give you a guideline that you can follow.

16
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,521
But I would say, take it with a grain of salt.

17
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:19,462
Those things really depend on the game.

18
00:01:20,903 --> 00:01:25,065
Before we dive in further, just a reminder to please fill out the evaluations after.

19
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:27,027
And also, please turn off your phones.

20
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:36,580
OK, the second reason why giving a talk about budgeting isn't that easy is money is weird.

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,003
And you probably know those things, but I do want to highlight them again.

22
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:43,105
Money really depends.

23
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:44,346
It's usually different.

24
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:46,568
It gets you different far depending where you are.

25
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:51,172
If you talk about the celery in the Bay Area compared to a remote island, it's super different.

26
00:01:52,887 --> 00:01:54,868
Especially in Indy, you're going to wear a lot of hats.

27
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:58,690
There's people that can do their own TikToks, they can do their own press outreach.

28
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,052
You maybe have to pay for that if that's not your cup of tea.

29
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:05,654
So there's like a huge spectrum of like budgets that can result from that.

30
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:11,597
Also, money changes, you know, pre-pandemic, inflation goes up, all that kind of stuff.

31
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:14,678
Probably by the time this talk is over, the numbers are outdated.

32
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:19,441
So like, you know, I want to give you a rough like guideline, but those things will change over time.

33
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:27,192
The table of content for today, some housekeeping, then we talk about free space, it takes about indie game budgeting rules.

34
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:33,895
The main part of the talk is like a 10-step kind of like hierarchy where I would recommend to spend the money on.

35
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:36,276
It's kind of your best return on investment.

36
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:42,678
So you start with the first one, spend your money on that, and then once it's done, you move on to the next one, and the next one, and the next one, and then we've got a summary in the end.

37
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:44,797
Who is this talk for?

38
00:02:45,178 --> 00:02:49,568
It is for developers that make premium indie games for PC and console, like your classic $5 to $20 games.

39
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:58,439
It's not meant for big investment companies that maybe publish quite a few games, that publish 30 games per year.

40
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:00,781
They're going to budget differently, or like bigger publishers.

41
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,903
Their budget is more going to be allocated, and to see what sticks and what works.

42
00:03:05,363 --> 00:03:09,406
This talk is more aimed at people that do old school game development.

43
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:12,548
They make a game, they put some money in, and they want to get more money out.

44
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:14,389
So it's like the goal being profitable.

45
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:23,003
And it's also not super aimed at people that make free-to-play games or mobile games.

46
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:25,365
They work quite differently, because you have to buy a lot more ads.

47
00:03:27,446 --> 00:03:32,829
And also to bring it back to the analogy from the beginning, often when I think about indie games, I think about them.

48
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:39,312
They're quite similar to a restaurant or a kitchen, how they're run, especially the people that make the food.

49
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,793
The food is your main ingredient.

50
00:03:40,873 --> 00:03:43,095
If the food isn't good, the restaurant's not going to work.

51
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:44,996
If your game isn't good, it's not going to work.

52
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:46,857
But there's a lot of stuff around it.

53
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:53,579
Like you can have staff, you can have a nice ambience, you can have nice cutlery, you could have online bookings, you could have more parking space.

54
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,500
There's a lot of stuff you could do to get an advantage.

55
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,201
There's also a lot of potential to overspend.

56
00:03:58,381 --> 00:03:59,801
And I think it's similar for indie games.

57
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:07,044
There's so many things you could spend money on, but not all of them are going to get you the best bang for your buck, and I think especially in indie games.

58
00:04:07,704 --> 00:04:12,685
if you're self-funded, you need to be super, super careful to not overspend and then don't have a return.

59
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:18,587
And I think it's also the classic thing of you would see a restaurant or a nightclub that looks always busy and then suddenly goes bust.

60
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:20,808
I think that same thing can happen to indie games.

61
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:30,910
They look like, it doesn't apply to like super hits that make millions, but like in the mid range where they're like, oh, they got like a few hundred reviews to look decent, but maybe if they spend like too much money, they're not super profitable still.

62
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:36,752
So this talk is really aimed at people, you know, where you want to get the most out of your budget if you make a small indie game.

63
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:42,393
Also hard to include in a talk like that is like hidden dev costs.

64
00:04:42,613 --> 00:04:47,995
For example, if you make a demo to be in a steam fest, obviously that's kind of a marketing expense, but it's also development time.

65
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:50,036
So those things are quite hard to quantify.

66
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:51,016
So I would keep those in mind.

67
00:04:51,096 --> 00:04:53,517
Those will occur as well if you make the game yourself.

68
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:55,634
A few words about me.

69
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:57,255
My name is Thomas Reisenecker.

70
00:04:57,435 --> 00:04:59,356
I'm the co-founder of FutureFence Games.

71
00:05:00,017 --> 00:05:02,999
I did account and I worked on around 10 million games, I think.

72
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,081
I've been in the industry for over 10 years.

73
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:07,342
We do a couple of different things.

74
00:05:07,382 --> 00:05:10,084
We do publishing, which is published a game called Summer House.

75
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:12,026
We work on Lazara, ExoWallet, and Omno.

76
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:14,067
We also have self-publishing

77
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:38,029
provider like we help with different services with like press with social media with consulting we make store pages we work on stuff like vampire survivors or what the goal so we do also work on different indie games which was kind of helpful for this talk like the data the knowledge in this talk comes from my brain like experience from team just working loads of games over the years i also did an online survey where about 30 people provided extra data

78
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,133
And then big, big thank you to a lot of smart people to help me out with more hot takes.

79
00:05:43,713 --> 00:05:51,258
Especially shout out to Derek Liu, Guillotine, Ico Partners, Player2PR, Pop Agenda, Raccoon Bees, Rockerplay, Schufa Media, and yours truly.

80
00:05:51,298 --> 00:05:55,961
They were like super helpful with sharing data, so I get a broader picture of, you know, what budgets look like.

81
00:05:57,172 --> 00:05:58,912
Okay, let's dive in.

82
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:03,413
Three in-the-game budgeting rules to live by that might get me into trouble.

83
00:06:04,493 --> 00:06:05,754
Let's start with number one.

84
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:10,455
I think like taking a certain percentage and saying, that's my total marketing budget.

85
00:06:10,915 --> 00:06:14,495
You know, the budget is 100,000, 20% is your marketing budget.

86
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:16,396
That can be like a rule of thumb.

87
00:06:16,596 --> 00:06:19,996
You would often hear those ranges being between 20 to 40.

88
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:21,897
Sometimes it's more, sometimes it's less.

89
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:25,758
I get it as a big company, and it can make sense to get some kind of idea.

90
00:06:25,898 --> 00:06:31,540
I think for a small company, you just need to see what you actually need, and then don't spend more than that, and don't spend less than that.

91
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,861
And that's what we're doing today, like, go for a checklist, what you might want to spend your money on.

92
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:38,302
I think planning your budget is great.

93
00:06:38,362 --> 00:06:40,022
I think sticking to it, terrible idea.

94
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:49,825
There were so many instances over the years where we had to really win or make games successful because we were flexible, because we had a little bit of extra room to, like, take up opportunities.

95
00:06:49,905 --> 00:06:51,866
For example, that's a game we published called Exo One.

96
00:06:53,487 --> 00:07:16,325
And that game was right in this promotion main promotion cycle when tick-tock for games started becoming a thing so suddenly we shifted loads of resources to there because we got millions of views and then we had to delay the games a few times because of technical difficulties and that randomly got us a game pass deal because suddenly there was a window open so I think like being open as an indie and then being able to change your budget once you figure out what works is super important and

97
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:24,294
Also, I feel like when people say, with enough marketing budget, every game can be successful, I think that's just not very true.

98
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:26,836
I would always see marketing as a multiplier.

99
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:29,217
And what I mean by that, I can show you here.

100
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:32,459
Let's say you've got a highly marketed game that people really like.

101
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,021
You announce it, and your following goes up, your wish list go up.

102
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:36,461
It's great.

103
00:07:36,782 --> 00:07:38,402
And then you put marketing muscle behind it.

104
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:42,005
You do social media, you do press, all that kind of stuff, and it's a multiplier.

105
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:43,866
And suddenly, you grow even faster.

106
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:49,371
But then let's say it's a bit more unlucky you have a game that doesn't resonate so much with players.

107
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:50,712
You're going to announce it.

108
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:51,773
It's going to be a bit more flat.

109
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:53,795
And then you put marketing money behind it.

110
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:55,297
And obviously, it's still a multiplier.

111
00:07:55,337 --> 00:07:57,279
But the curve is more this instead of this.

112
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,121
So I would always keep that in mind.

113
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:00,722
Marketing can be really helpful.

114
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:04,366
It's not going to be like you're saving grades if the game just doesn't resonate with players.

115
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,191
OK, let's get into the main bit.

116
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:09,832
Let's get into the budgeting hierarchy.

117
00:08:10,712 --> 00:08:14,514
So the idea is making a list of what's the best return of investment.

118
00:08:14,614 --> 00:08:16,035
Where do you get the best value for money?

119
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:17,996
Start at the top.

120
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:18,817
Work your way down.

121
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:20,518
There's two ways how you could do it.

122
00:08:20,938 --> 00:08:23,599
One, that's actually in real life how we see it mostly.

123
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:28,382
People have a certain amount of marketing budget, and then they work their way down until they run out.

124
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:29,562
Sometimes you come to number three.

125
00:08:29,662 --> 00:08:30,703
Sometimes you come to number eight.

126
00:08:31,523 --> 00:08:34,045
You might be a bigger company, and you run until 10 and beyond.

127
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:44,092
and the other approach is if you start out and you don't know your budget yet, you know, take notes for each of them and see how much you would need and that might give you an idea of how much money you should raise for your marketing.

128
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:46,093
Top 10 points.

129
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:46,613
Let's go.

130
00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:49,295
Number one is first-party support.

131
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:58,462
What I mean by that, if you open your PlayStation, go in the PlayStation store, you will see different games featured and sometimes it's indie games and that's great because there's a lot of PlayStations.

132
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:03,829
Sometimes you can get social media support from first party like Nintendo and Xbox and Steam.

133
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:09,231
Or you'd see different Steam features, like being the popular upcoming list, getting a pop-up banner on Steam.

134
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:13,252
Those things are super valuable, and I can't overstate how valuable they are.

135
00:09:13,392 --> 00:09:14,673
This is different multipliers.

136
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:19,034
It's not super scientific, but that's like roughly what reach different channels could get you.

137
00:09:19,694 --> 00:09:23,736
And you see on the very right, the first party, the stores, they've got a massive reach.

138
00:09:23,816 --> 00:09:25,517
And actually in real life, it's probably more like that.

139
00:09:26,037 --> 00:09:26,997
They have crazy reach.

140
00:09:27,237 --> 00:09:28,978
There's nothing else you can do to match that.

141
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:36,247
which sounds great, but now we talk about how you got first-party support which is less great because it's not easy because it is so good.

142
00:09:37,147 --> 00:09:50,931
There's a different approach to take number one you could do it that means you generate which with which list to try to get them you talk to Sony you talk to Nintendo you email them when it's a game announcement you ask if you could be in a showcase if you can get social media support.

143
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:57,013
You could also get an agent a publisher to do that they probably will take a rough share a certain amount of payment.

144
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,343
or you could be lucky and just make a really good game and hope that works and that sometimes work, but usually it doesn't, so I wouldn't recommend that.

145
00:10:05,724 --> 00:10:14,629
So the main thing here, this is a super hard one to put money on because it could be zero if you do it, it could be infinite if, you know, your publisher takes most of the money and then you don't recoup.

146
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,851
I think the important thing is here, just do it, make sure it's covered.

147
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:21,112
That's like the one thing you shouldn't ignore.

148
00:10:21,713 --> 00:10:25,835
Like don't do loads of tweets, but never like email Nintendo or something if you make a Switch game.

149
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:40,018
The second thing you should definitely do super high up the list is the steam that steam store page or like any console store page Even if you do nothing else, this is going to get a massive amount of traffic And most people that will ever see your game.

150
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:43,743
They will just find it in an online store again That's why first party support is so important

151
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:47,437
What you're going to need on your store page, let's go through that.

152
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:50,760
You're going to need a nice key art, capsule art that really communicates what your game is.

153
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,004
Sometimes done in-house, if you do it with a freelancer or an agency, it can cost between $500 and $5,000.

154
00:10:57,664 --> 00:11:01,046
Again, don't sue me if it costs less or more.

155
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,869
If you want to work with a specific expert, it will be more expensive, or like a famous artist.

156
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,651
If you go on Fiverr and pick the cheapest option, it will be cheaper.

157
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:09,492
But obviously, the quality will vary a lot.

158
00:11:10,478 --> 00:11:12,559
The second thing you're going to need in the store page is a trailer.

159
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:16,960
And that's a few clips from trailers, and that should make clear how different trailers can be.

160
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,101
You know, just gameplay.

161
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:19,041
It could be animated.

162
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:22,522
It could be a VR trailer where we actually see some, like, real actors.

163
00:11:22,822 --> 00:11:24,883
So there's a huge range what a trailer could cost.

164
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,023
But they are super important.

165
00:11:27,043 --> 00:11:31,425
They're one of the main things that people look at in your store page, and you're going to need them for loads of other marketing stuff as well.

166
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:36,691
Here's a few different prices for trailer could cost if you go super duper cheap.

167
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:45,198
They can cost like $500 to $1,000 that usually means you do your own capture you write your own script you just bring it to someone who knows how to edit a video to put it together for you.

168
00:11:46,099 --> 00:11:57,809
Often for in the games we see like the 2nd one the 2nd range simple trailer it's often like in the 3 for $5,000 range where you will probably get some capture it will help some of us to script you probably work with them and get like a quite decent trailer.

169
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:22,749
it goes up if you go to experience trailer editor that makes like a more premium trailer it can go into like a five to ten thousand dollar range that means they will do more capture they probably provide you know more marketing insights they're going to help with the script they're going to help you pitch the game you can more hand it off to them and if you go for super fancy trailer if you go with a pro where you just you know they give them the game and they just give you a great trailer back for a big agency they can cost a lot more it can cost

170
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:27,932
10 to 50,000, even more if there's actors involved or mixed reality and stuff like that.

171
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:30,834
So there's a huge range, but that should give you an idea of what a trailer costs.

172
00:12:31,435 --> 00:12:32,355
How many trailers do you need?

173
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:33,876
Usually one to three.

174
00:12:33,937 --> 00:12:35,137
For a small game, usually one.

175
00:12:35,758 --> 00:12:42,262
Bigger indie games often have an announcement trailer, a release date trailer, and a launch trailer, or in the middle, a gameplay trailer maybe.

176
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:46,505
Some games that a lot of showcases are bigger have five, six trailers.

177
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:53,110
Some even more, obviously at some point it gets a bit of silly territory because you can't show that many different things about your game.

178
00:12:55,312 --> 00:12:57,153
What else you're going to need on the store page is screenshots.

179
00:12:57,493 --> 00:13:04,739
Super important, but I don't know anyone who has just paid specifically for screenshots, so it's usually done in-house or the trailer person helps you or your marketing person does it or you do it.

180
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:07,493
You're going to need a store description.

181
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:11,674
Again, this is something that's often done in-house by the writers.

182
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:13,475
It's often done by the marketing team or yourself.

183
00:13:14,255 --> 00:13:25,017
If you wanted to get freelance help, prices vary a lot, but what we've heard a lot is like, you know, cheap, going $500, $100, real experts that maybe do like a bigger branding, write you more stuff.

184
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:27,158
It can cost a few thousand dollars to get this done nicely.

185
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:56,007
we also going to have tax and back and stuff on the steam page on the shop and so on again usually done in-house a lot of people read really good newsletters, especially game discover go and how to market game a really really great for that highly recommend that if you get an expert sometimes you know they will just give you a little bit feedback sometimes to write the whole thing prices can vary for like the low hundreds to like a few thousand dollars if you want to get support with optimizing a store page.

186
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,842
And the last thing on the store page that I would really recommend spending money on is localization.

187
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:02,383
Super, super important.

188
00:14:02,623 --> 00:14:04,544
If your game is localized, localize the store page as well.

189
00:14:04,564 --> 00:14:06,505
It can make a huge difference, especially in China.

190
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:08,466
Prices can vary.

191
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:14,249
If you go to AI, fan translation, Google, Brave, could cost nothing, could backfire a lot.

192
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:18,651
If you go to a localization agency, you often see prices with $0.06 to $0.21 per word.

193
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:24,034
Super depends on is do you have a lot of puns?

194
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:25,895
How many words to have a game?

195
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:26,995
What's your turnaround time?

196
00:14:27,135 --> 00:14:28,216
What languages do you need?

197
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:48,167
But that's kind of the range I would say like a bigger premium indie game often at these days aims for like eight to ten languages Again big disclaimer if you have got a narrow massive narrative game you maybe can't do that because it's going to cost thousands and thousands per language if you got a racing game, which does the words is press start and select car you could probably do all the languages and

198
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:53,074
The next thing I would spend money on is ongoing marketing planning support.

199
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,616
So now we've covered like the super basics, the first two points.

200
00:14:58,116 --> 00:15:00,938
Now we actually want to plan what we want to do actively to promote the game.

201
00:15:01,738 --> 00:15:03,379
And setting the right goals is super important.

202
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:06,460
There's two things I would like avoid at all costs to miss.

203
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,841
There's this event deadlines for online events.

204
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:10,102
We're going to talk about in a minute.

205
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:12,683
They can be a really great multiplayer and first party deadlines.

206
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:14,804
If you miss them, you've just missed them.

207
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:15,724
There's no going back.

208
00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:17,445
Those can be really expensive mistakes.

209
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,646
And again, I would also recommend being flexible.

210
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:22,908
There's a few ways how you could go about this.

211
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,229
You could do your own marketing plan.

212
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:26,951
You know, you read the newsletters, you talk to indies, you try to figure it out.

213
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:28,172
You could hire a marketing person.

214
00:15:28,832 --> 00:15:33,356
You could also have an agency on a PR retainer, usually cost low thousands to like 10 thousands.

215
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:35,918
Or you could do some consulting with an expert.

216
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,480
This will usually depend how often you want to talk to them, how much input you need.

217
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,362
It's again, one of those things where just make sure it's covered.

218
00:15:42,462 --> 00:15:44,644
Make sure you've got enough input so you know what's going on.

219
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,574
Number four, attending online events.

220
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,595
It's a really big trend at the moment.

221
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:51,836
It's a great multiplayer.

222
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:53,117
Like, I can't recommend this enough.

223
00:15:53,677 --> 00:15:59,221
We're talking about, like, Wholesome Direct, PC Gaming Show, The Mix, Indie World, the first party showcases.

224
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:02,203
Being in those events is a huge reach boost.

225
00:16:02,243 --> 00:16:03,584
You often get a great Steam feature.

226
00:16:03,604 --> 00:16:04,965
They have good social media following.

227
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:06,526
They will be on IGN or GameSpot.

228
00:16:06,986 --> 00:16:08,707
They're really good value for money.

229
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:15,472
Simon Carlos did a really good list of, like, different tiers of what those events are and how much reach they get.

230
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:18,338
And they also really vary in prices.

231
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,439
So one thing they usually need is a new trailer.

232
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:22,320
So you need a trailer that costs money.

233
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,941
And there's different admission fees.

234
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:27,163
It might be low hundreds, mid-tier is often $2,000 to $10,000.

235
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:31,665
If you go to a big one, it could go $50,000 to $300,000 to above that.

236
00:16:32,286 --> 00:16:43,852
The prices vary a lot depending on if your game's cool, if they want it to be in there, how long your video should be, or your asset that you have in there, and also at what time and what showcase you want to be in.

237
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:49,011
I would say to all of that, they all have editorial slots as well.

238
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:51,914
So if your game is really sick, you might get in for free.

239
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:54,116
So it's definitely worth trying.

240
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:57,098
I think it's also a really good indicator if you're onto something.

241
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:02,023
If you get into a PC gaming show for free, it means probably your game is pretty sick.

242
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:09,410
If you get in no showcase, even the small ones where you have to pay and you get in nowhere, that's probably an indicator that people don't really resonate with that game.

243
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:13,540
How often do you be in events?

244
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,721
I think how often you can.

245
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:20,625
Most games that we work on where we like to apply for lots of stuff that will get like in 3 or 4 per year.

246
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:27,089
If you get into more great just you know at some point to maybe burn yourself out with not having enough new trailers of beats for those events.

247
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,363
Next up is social media management.

248
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:34,044
This is like the first thing on the list that has a way higher ceiling.

249
00:17:34,164 --> 00:17:37,005
Like, you know, you can only do one Steam page, there's only so many events.

250
00:17:37,165 --> 00:17:40,046
Social media, you could do one TikTok per month, you could do one per day.

251
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,327
So there's a lot more you can do, a lot more leeway.

252
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:47,608
One mistake we see here a lot is people say, oh, we should just like hire someone like Victoria Tran.

253
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:50,109
I don't know if she works for Among Us, for like InnerSloth.

254
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:53,330
She's really good at all social media, community management stuff.

255
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,311
Please keep in mind, like, it's an umbrella term.

256
00:17:56,331 --> 00:18:03,233
There's a lot of stuff that people do in this field, you know, video creation, filming time in front of a camera, customer support.

257
00:18:03,313 --> 00:18:06,014
It's a quite complex field, and it's easy to take it for granted.

258
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:12,436
We looked at some numbers from the games industry career guide, how much salaries are in that range.

259
00:18:12,536 --> 00:18:13,877
Again, depends hugely.

260
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:18,918
You would maybe look at $30,000 to $125,000, depending on where this person is based.

261
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:23,280
If it's someone fresh off university on another continent, it might be less.

262
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,842
if you have super senior it might be more.

263
00:18:26,882 --> 00:18:29,284
We also asked freelancers what their rates are at the moment.

264
00:18:29,364 --> 00:18:31,365
We got a lot of $20 to $100 per hour.

265
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:37,349
I would recommend you have, it could be yourself, it could be someone in the team, or someone you hire.

266
00:18:37,469 --> 00:18:40,051
I would recommend for an indie game at least a part-time person for this.

267
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:42,473
If you can, a full-time person, if not more.

268
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,279
organic influence outreach.

269
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,924
That means you send codes to influencers and they play your game and you don't pay them for it.

270
00:18:51,445 --> 00:18:55,469
There was like an online debate recently that people were like, oh, it's not working anymore.

271
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:57,671
It used to be easier to get organic coverage.

272
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,412
It's still super worthwhile, I think.

273
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:06,119
It's not like it used to be that you get like loads of loads of tons of big videos, but that's absolutely potential to get free influencer coverage.

274
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,364
Some things we worked on recently, you know, you still get your videos with hundreds or like 50,000 views and they can really move the needle.

275
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:16,306
This can be a really big driver of wishlist and visibility.

276
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:22,910
How much it costs to get an organic influencer outreach depends a lot on how big your game is, how much code management is involved.

277
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:30,558
If you go with a freelancer, if you go with someone who covers this globally, different countries, I would say roughly $2,000 to $5,000 per outreach.

278
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:39,028
Most indie games will have one to three outreaches, at least one at launch, maybe one for a Steam Fest, and then maybe one for a preview, a demo version.

279
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:44,666
Organic press outreach means you send news and codes to press and you get coverage from them.

280
00:19:45,146 --> 00:19:47,647
We do hear a lot, hey, this doesn't have the impact it used to have.

281
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,847
That is true, but I think it still has good impact.

282
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:51,808
You see often wish list increase from big sites.

283
00:19:52,468 --> 00:19:55,909
More importantly though, it's still like, you know, it shows up at Google.

284
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:57,629
We worked on a game called Eye of the Temple.

285
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,450
If you Google that game, you've got like loads of great headlines.

286
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,410
You know who Googles games?

287
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,091
Influencers, people that manage the store page, other press people.

288
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:09,912
So I think there's a lot of like secondary value that helps raising your profile from press outreach.

289
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:14,095
Also Metacritic stores are still important on some online stores.

290
00:20:15,176 --> 00:20:20,862
A typical press outreach per beat would cost you a thousand to like maybe five thousand dollars in the indie sector.

291
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:30,631
It can easily go up to ten if it's localized in different languages, if your game is quite big and the code management is complicated or it's multi-platform, but that's roughly what you're looking at.

292
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:34,533
I would say quantity, I would say at least three PR beats are great.

293
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:38,235
One is the game announcement, one is the release date announcement, one is the launch.

294
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:39,416
It can be more.

295
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,957
Steam first preview, gameplay trailer, and so on.

296
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:44,918
Again, three to five is usually what we're working with.

297
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:47,459
Bigger games, six to seven.

298
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:54,102
After that, it goes a bit into silly territory at some point, unless you make a really, really massive or an ongoing indie game.

299
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,967
If you made it until here, it's pretty sick.

300
00:21:04,168 --> 00:21:06,813
That's like most games that were like, nice, that's a good budget.

301
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:08,416
Like that's a good way to market an indie game.

302
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,002
But obviously there's more money you can spend on if you have it.

303
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:15,350
What you could do is attend events like GDC.

304
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:19,352
What you need for that, you know, ticket, accommodation, probably your travel.

305
00:21:19,392 --> 00:21:21,073
This will depend where you live and where you want to go.

306
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:27,917
I would always say local events are great investment for networking, meeting platform holders, meeting publishers and all that.

307
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,338
Going overseas depends.

308
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:36,681
Sometimes I definitely wouldn't say you should go to all the big events like Gamescom, GDC, PAX every year for the sake of it.

309
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:40,863
Like, I think it's an overspend, but if you pick carefully, I think it's a good investment.

310
00:21:42,565 --> 00:21:43,145
paid influencers.

311
00:22:02,014 --> 00:22:03,697
It can be really good if you pick carefully.

312
00:22:03,837 --> 00:22:04,818
It can be a great return.

313
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,442
So it's a very case-by-case basis stuff.

314
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:12,028
Most games we work with, small indie games, don't pay for that or pay in the low hundreds.

315
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:15,173
Big indie games, often you see like 15 to 50,000.

316
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:17,997
Bigger games, this budget can go way up and can keep going.

317
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,562
I got some help in this slide from a friend, MJ from yours truly.

318
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:24,983
They do a lot of influencer stuff.

319
00:22:26,424 --> 00:22:28,605
I just wanted to figure out what's like a price range.

320
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:29,606
And they're huge.

321
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:35,930
Like I can tell you, when we email people and say like, hey, I want a video, the price ranges, it's wild west, it's all over the place.

322
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,231
So it's a lot about comparing.

323
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:42,014
If you're looking at a YouTuber for under 500K subs, you would maybe look at $600,000 to $12,000.

324
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:43,736
Huge range.

325
00:22:44,356 --> 00:22:46,718
You could look at another metric, which is cost per view.

326
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:50,141
So you could look at how much does a few cost.

327
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:53,264
I think a pretty good range, if you manage like 2 to 4 cents, it's great.

328
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:55,207
If around 7, still pretty good.

329
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:59,852
If it goes beyond that, it would need to be a quite specific niche influencer, so it makes sense.

330
00:23:00,753 --> 00:23:02,975
For Twitch streamers, there's a similar big range.

331
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:07,440
If you look at the 2 hour stream for a channel that has under 1 million subs, you maybe look at 600 to 6,000 dollars.

332
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:21,151
if you look at really really big twitch channels those numbers go like infinite like it's crazy you can spend a lot of money here we also have a cost-per-view range on twitch it's more that you aim for like the 13 cents

333
00:23:23,072 --> 00:23:25,615
paid social media ads, similar, quite difficult thing.

334
00:23:26,736 --> 00:23:27,757
It's not easy to measure.

335
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:31,581
There's a lot of games we worked on tried to do that and then didn't have a good return.

336
00:23:32,222 --> 00:23:36,687
If you figured out how to, you know, get a TikTok, Instagram ad and they get money back from it, great.

337
00:23:37,508 --> 00:23:38,269
Some people can do it.

338
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:41,492
This also works surprisingly bad on crowdfunding than on released games.

339
00:23:42,573 --> 00:23:45,615
A lot of games we work with don't spend money on this, or like in the low hundreds.

340
00:23:46,655 --> 00:23:56,320
A lot of experts I talk to, it really helps if you have $500 to $1,000 per channel to optimize it, so it gets a lot cheaper, so it's better not to spread too thin, but you know, focus on a few channels, but figure them out well.

341
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:03,484
And like, once you know it's running and you make money back, right, but obviously those budgets are quite of infinite and keep going until they don't work anymore.

342
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:09,412
Also interesting, a few people buy AdWords to get more wishlists, to get a better Steam ranking.

343
00:24:09,693 --> 00:24:12,678
They will often look at $1-$2 per wishlist if they buy ads.

344
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,103
Again, talk to people that have half of that, talk to people that pay double.

345
00:24:16,203 --> 00:24:18,968
Depends on your game, depends on the country, but it's a rough guideline.

346
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,251
Some closing thoughts.

347
00:24:21,991 --> 00:24:25,795
Some of those things I've talked about are easier to outsource, some of them are harder to outsource.

348
00:24:25,815 --> 00:24:36,965
For example, social media, you can work with an agency, we do that, but it's often something that's good if it's kept in-house, you're quite close to it, because you will be involved in development, and a lot of it happens that's interesting in social media.

349
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:39,867
Press and influence outreach are super easy to give away.

350
00:24:40,007 --> 00:24:43,489
Those agencies, they have the context, you explain in the game, they send it out.

351
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:46,250
So there's different things that are easy and hard to outsource.

352
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:53,253
Everything in the middle, first-party support, store page, marketing planner, I would like probably keep in-house, but maybe get professional advice if you can.

353
00:24:55,354 --> 00:24:56,294
What about the other stuff?

354
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:59,756
Physical press kits, super animated trailers, making of videos.

355
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:05,493
were added on there, because I think for me at the moment, they just don't have that good return of investment.

356
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:10,858
That being said, we've done all this stuff on different games and it did work, it's just not on my default list.

357
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,863
So I would take those, you know, not super high up the list, but it can work if your game is right for it.

358
00:25:17,173 --> 00:25:19,816
Other regions, this is very focused on the US and Europe.

359
00:25:20,296 --> 00:25:24,461
If you want to specifically market in Asia, I think finding a local partner super helps.

360
00:25:25,122 --> 00:25:28,585
It's quite common that you don't take payment, but a revenue share.

361
00:25:28,626 --> 00:25:32,590
So in that sense, you're not spending money, but you get less revenue from that.

362
00:25:34,386 --> 00:25:37,248
In the end, we've got a summary of our checklist, what to spend money on.

363
00:25:37,308 --> 00:25:39,210
Obviously, it's a tier list because video games.

364
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:46,935
Number one, Steam store page, console store page, most important thing, and first party support.

365
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:49,217
Talk to the platform holders, see if you can get featuring.

366
00:25:50,836 --> 00:25:51,016
I would

367
00:26:06,102 --> 00:26:10,805
Then I would say attending event, and then see if you've got money left for paid influences, paid sets.

368
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:15,148
And at very last is the rest that could make sense if there's budget list.

369
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:21,032
In the F tier, I didn't have one, but that's what the chart looks like, so it's worth the rest.

370
00:26:23,253 --> 00:26:24,574
Thank you very much for listening.

371
00:26:25,775 --> 00:26:28,097
Again, thanks so much for coming while Zelda is on.

372
00:26:28,137 --> 00:26:31,899
And if you've got questions, I think we've got a little bit of time, so you could just come up to the mic and ask.

373
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:32,680
Thank you very much.

374
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,741
Hey, thanks for the talk.

375
00:26:43,761 --> 00:26:44,181
That was great.

376
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:46,602
Wanted to ask you specifically about Reddit.

377
00:26:46,862 --> 00:26:49,484
Have you had experience with that as a platform?

378
00:26:49,504 --> 00:26:50,984
If you can expand on that, that would be great.

379
00:26:52,105 --> 00:26:54,086
Okay, specifically Reddit.

380
00:26:54,486 --> 00:26:58,068
I would say on an organic level, there's usually two ways how we tackle Reddit.

381
00:26:58,828 --> 00:27:06,692
One is if somebody in your team loves Reddit and they're really good on it, they're actually part of the community, it can be super strong, but they know the rules and it's quite complicated.

382
00:27:07,532 --> 00:27:27,328
and then that's like reddit light which I would recommend every in the game to go into my subreddit like in the gaming subreddits made in unity subreddits a lot more chill and self-promotion, they're not as big but still pretty good value for money and then paid reddit ads can, I've heard, work quite well depending on the genre like strategy games and stuff like more hardcore gamer things can work well on reddit.

383
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:28,289
Thank you.

384
00:27:30,551 --> 00:27:30,671
Hi.

385
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,002
This might be a little eccentric of a question.

386
00:27:33,082 --> 00:27:33,762
I was just curious.

387
00:27:33,882 --> 00:27:39,027
So a lot of the stuff you're talking about makes sense within the ecosystem of gaming itself.

388
00:27:39,087 --> 00:27:48,676
I wondered if you had any experiences in all of these experiences that you had in other cultural realms or oddball strategies you had tried that had worked or not worked.

389
00:27:48,696 --> 00:27:50,278
I was curious about that idea.

390
00:27:51,098 --> 00:27:53,680
I think it's something we get a lot when somebody makes a racing game.

391
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,263
They're like, oh, can we be on a racing website, on a car website?

392
00:27:57,383 --> 00:27:59,625
Or can we have a crazy guerrilla marketing stunt?

393
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,647
And I would usually say, those things are great once you've done the top 10.

394
00:28:03,428 --> 00:28:05,089
I think this is the easy one to get.

395
00:28:05,229 --> 00:28:13,636
It's a lot harder to convince someone who doesn't play Steam games but likes cars to buy a PC, download Steam, sign up, download a game, get a controller.

396
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:15,437
There's a lot of steps to convince people.

397
00:28:15,758 --> 00:28:19,440
So I think it can make sense as a secondary thing, but I would focus on games first.

398
00:28:19,621 --> 00:28:19,901
Of course.

399
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:21,251
Thank you.

400
00:28:22,877 --> 00:28:24,157
Hey, thank you so much, Thomas.

401
00:28:24,517 --> 00:28:25,057
Amazing talk.

402
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:27,438
Also, big fan of your talk from last year.

403
00:28:28,158 --> 00:28:29,218
No one cares about your video game.

404
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:30,178
I watch that all the time.

405
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,199
But, yeah, specific question.

406
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:39,480
In terms of social media channels and what has the biggest ROI for ad spend?

407
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,062
I guess I'm curious because, you know, I do like the Twitter, TikTok, Reddit, Trifecta.

408
00:28:46,162 --> 00:28:48,342
I'm not sure really where my money is best spent.

409
00:28:48,502 --> 00:28:49,962
And I'm sure that's game dependent.

410
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:52,683
But, you know, rough rule of thumb if you had some.

411
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:55,544
Yeah, I would say I'm not the super expert on paid ads.

412
00:28:56,164 --> 00:29:03,386
From what we've tried and people we've talked to, I feel at the moment Reddit, TikTok, and then Meta, so Facebook and Instagram, work quite well.

413
00:29:04,947 --> 00:29:07,487
Stuff like Instagram Stories, I think, have quite a good return.

414
00:29:07,527 --> 00:29:14,249
We do have some good success on TikTok, but mostly for games where we've made loads of posts.

415
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,190
So we've already made 50 posts.

416
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,391
We know those two are trending, so we boost them.

417
00:29:19,431 --> 00:29:20,151
Thank you for watching!

418
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:49,828
So you mentioned this talk was for PC games, console games, and not for mobile games, but what about those of us who are creating a VR game?

419
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:52,531
Is there any difference in spend?

420
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:57,737
Anything else you would add or change for a VR game?

421
00:29:58,132 --> 00:29:59,853
Yes, we do work on a lot of VR games.

422
00:29:59,953 --> 00:30:02,514
I feel like they're in a quite similar category.

423
00:30:03,255 --> 00:30:05,816
A few things that are different is like there is less press.

424
00:30:05,996 --> 00:30:10,378
I think it's still relevant, but there's only two or three big websites, so it'll probably go lighter on the spend there.

425
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:18,983
Other than that, social media is a little bit different in that Reddit is a lot more excited about VR games than other games.

426
00:30:19,123 --> 00:30:20,464
So I think Reddit is more important.

427
00:30:20,924 --> 00:30:22,425
Also, TikTok works surprisingly well.

428
00:30:23,826 --> 00:30:28,950
Other than that, campaigns can be shorter, because wish lists and all that momentum doesn't matter so much.

429
00:30:28,971 --> 00:30:32,234
So it can be like two, three month campaigns are more common in VR.

430
00:30:33,435 --> 00:30:39,260
But a lot of it is quite similar in terms of organic outreach for press and influencers, the marketing plans.

431
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,641
I think it almost applies.

432
00:30:40,682 --> 00:30:41,342
It's pretty close.

433
00:30:41,462 --> 00:30:43,704
I think mobile is quite removed from what we talked about.

434
00:30:43,764 --> 00:30:44,825
VR is pretty close to that.

435
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:45,426
Great.

436
00:30:45,826 --> 00:30:46,407
Thank you very much.

437
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,732
Thanks for the presentation.

438
00:30:50,653 --> 00:31:00,047
I was wondering, sort of a meta question, how do you measure whether some form of marketing is actually performing better than others?

439
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:03,212
Are there certain very direct metrics you can actually

440
00:31:03,432 --> 00:31:05,615
Yeah, I feel like we get this question asked a lot.

441
00:31:05,695 --> 00:31:06,776
What's our KPIs?

442
00:31:06,896 --> 00:31:08,919
And usually our KPIs number goes up.

443
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,462
I know it sounds simple, but I think it's really helpful.

444
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:14,005
You would see your social media following growing.

445
00:31:14,586 --> 00:31:16,328
You would suddenly see wish lists increasing.

446
00:31:16,368 --> 00:31:17,629
You see pre-orders going up.

447
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:22,095
So really keeping an eye on those really quite basic numbers is quite good.

448
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:29,754
Is there a way to tie that directly with installs or engagement?

449
00:31:44,607 --> 00:31:45,348
I feel like for us.

450
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:57,033
It's a lot based on just like working a lot of games and getting a gut feeling You know we do something, but nothing else happens And then we see how the numbers go up, but it don't so I think this is what the talk is mostly based on It's quite hard to track.

451
00:31:57,113 --> 00:32:11,939
I think tracking links is probably the closest you would get Thank you Hi, thanks for your talk do you have a point of view on social media accounts being developer owned or individual to each game and

452
00:32:14,604 --> 00:32:17,826
It really depends if you want to make more games in the same niche.

453
00:32:18,746 --> 00:32:24,590
I think if you stay like in narrative games, in racing games, definitely like I would make a studio account instead of a game account.

454
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,072
What we also do quite a lot is just like rebrand them as we go.

455
00:32:28,812 --> 00:32:31,253
You know, we would have the studio name on Twitter slash the game name.

456
00:32:31,914 --> 00:32:34,936
And then when this next game, we just exchange that and update their accounts.

457
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:39,939
Generally, the more personal your accounts can be, the better if you have a small game, especially on Reddit.

458
00:32:41,281 --> 00:32:43,365
but it really depends on a case-by-case basis.

459
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:46,292
Cool.

460
00:32:46,472 --> 00:32:47,515
Well, I think time's up.

461
00:32:47,695 --> 00:32:48,236
Thank you very much.
