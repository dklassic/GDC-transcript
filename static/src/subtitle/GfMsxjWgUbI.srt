1
00:00:05,644 --> 00:00:12,372
I'm Kim Belair. I'm a writer, I'm a narrative designer, I'm extremely nervous and I'm the

2
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:17,698
co-founder of a little narrative development company called Sweet Baby Inc. We do narrative

3
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:23,465
development in games and kind of beyond and we try to bring a lot of inclusion, diversity

4
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:25,247
and new ideas kind of to the industry.

5
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:31,853
So just as a kind of fun fact, last year was actually my first GDC and I first pitched

6
00:00:31,873 --> 00:00:36,439
this talk as part of the program Amplifying New Voices, if anyone has heard of it.

7
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:37,800
Yes.

8
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:42,045
I think it's also kind of appropriate that that's where I talked about this because it's

9
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:44,208
also what my talk is about in a lot of ways.

10
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:45,369
So hi.

11
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:52,716
For a little bit of background on me, I've been a professional writer for about 12 years,

12
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:56,359
but I've always written stuff. I think that's always the way.

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:03,346
But when I was a kid, and I want to start at the beginning here because I think that it's important to kind of give context

14
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:06,269
to the way I learned about representation as a woman of color,

15
00:01:06,669 --> 00:01:11,293
and I think the way that a lot of marginalized people kind of get socialized when it comes to topics like this.

16
00:01:12,234 --> 00:01:18,899
So when I was small and starting to kind of express myself creatively in either writing or stories or art,

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,061
I wrote about myself a lot.

18
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:25,364
And I would put myself into a lot of art, into a lot of narratives,

19
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:30,047
and I put my family and people who look like me in all these cool scenarios,

20
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,230
and I was telling all these stories where I got to see myself,

21
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,711
I got to see people who look like me,

22
00:01:34,851 --> 00:01:38,614
and kind of a rainbow of people who were kind of adjacent to me in a lot of ways.

23
00:01:39,594 --> 00:01:42,635
And I think it was really neat and I was really fostered in that.

24
00:01:42,695 --> 00:01:47,177
So when I hit elementary school, I think that I was free to tell those stories

25
00:01:47,277 --> 00:01:50,398
because a lot of the stories that you hear in elementary school are about like,

26
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:53,679
we should be friends with everyone, we should be inclusive,

27
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:56,640
we should preach equality and build communities.

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,901
And I think this was really, really wonderful.

29
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:02,081
But then I got to high school.

30
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,763
And suddenly for the first time in my life,

31
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:07,524
I got told that the stories that I was writing

32
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,166
and the things that I was creating for and about people

33
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:13,508
who resembled me were not real stories

34
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:14,969
and they were not right stories.

35
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:17,930
And this was to the point that I received a list

36
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,611
that I'm sure many of you have received

37
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:22,193
that was here's a list of authors

38
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,074
and stories that are legitimate.

39
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:27,376
Here's a list of people and stories that are important.

40
00:02:27,836 --> 00:02:30,538
And as you can imagine, they were mostly men

41
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:32,900
and almost exclusively white.

42
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,544
And so were the subjects of all these stories, with a couple exceptions of

43
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:44,089
people who were there to teach lessons to the white male characters, or people

44
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:47,773
who were there to express pain, or people who were there to be the target of some

45
00:02:47,813 --> 00:02:49,094
kind of hate or conflict.

46
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:55,434
And if we ever did read, you know, here's a book by like an African American author,

47
00:02:55,474 --> 00:02:59,876
here's a book by a woman, here's a book by a Japanese author, it was for a lesson that was

48
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:04,438
about this is what life is like as a woman, this is what pain and suffering is like as a Black

49
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:09,061
person, this is what pain and suffering is like as a Japanese person. And so through that and

50
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:16,624
kind of unconsciously, I started to learn that books by and about white men were literature,

51
00:03:16,884 --> 00:03:18,465
they were classics, they were important.

52
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:22,612
and everything else is just special interest.

53
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:23,995
They're very, very niche.

54
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,619
And then meanwhile, there's like a young me.

55
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,787
And all I wanted out of this whole life was to be a writer.

56
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:34,013
And I wanted that so bad that I kind of said,

57
00:03:34,053 --> 00:03:35,734
okay, well, what do I need to be legitimate?

58
00:03:36,035 --> 00:03:39,117
And I just internalized everything that I had learned.

59
00:03:40,038 --> 00:03:41,339
And I did that for years.

60
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:48,484
And I spent like actual years just writing about white men,

61
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:49,765
because I thought, okay,

62
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:55,509
I'm making art now because I can look at the stories that are being told that are being

63
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:59,332
held up as legitimate and as classic and they look like the stories that I'm telling.

64
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:04,535
And for so many years I did this that I think it was probably only in my early to mid-twenties

65
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:10,719
that I started to realize that I had internalized this like deeply, deeply uninteresting idea.

66
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:17,923
that in terms of narratives and stories, white and male are neutral and universal.

67
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:23,026
And I say that even as a woman of color, so while we don't all fall into that trap,

68
00:04:23,727 --> 00:04:28,190
I say it to illustrate how easy it is for us to take on that narrative

69
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,811
even as people who are marginalized, even as we're fighting.

70
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:32,953
Because we've kind of created this normal.

71
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:40,038
that we all unconsciously follow and it affects us even as we advocate for change.

72
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:42,560
There are things and times like back in the day if you'd asked me,

73
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:46,503
oh are you doing this on purpose? Are you only telling stories that fit the dominant narrative?

74
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:51,247
I would never have said yes, but I think that a lot of people end up doing it even as they're

75
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:57,092
saying we have to do better. And I think that that's actually shown in the way that we manage

76
00:04:57,432 --> 00:04:58,073
representation.

77
00:04:58,621 --> 00:05:01,944
which we still consider it this like deviation from something that is normal.

78
00:05:02,504 --> 00:05:06,488
And representation is this like very, very scary and very uncertain thing.

79
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:10,591
And if we do it wrong or if we don't do it, you know, accurately,

80
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:14,615
or if we kind of take a risk, we might get shouted down and that fear is enough to stop us.

81
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,295
And I think like.

82
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:21,218
that sucks. And it's such a bummer because it's the only way sometimes that we end up

83
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:27,400
talking about it. We end up saying we're going to share our stories of microaggressions, which I am

84
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,661
going to do today, but we share stories of trauma and of doubt and when we're dealing with narratives

85
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:38,023
in advocacy, we end up going like, okay, these stories are stirring and they're beautiful,

86
00:05:38,283 --> 00:05:41,164
but they're also very sad and very heartbreaking.

87
00:05:41,844 --> 00:05:44,005
And I think it's important to do that.

88
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:46,405
It's important to share all of those painful stories

89
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:48,806
if we're going to actually understand the struggle

90
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:49,706
and convey the struggle.

91
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:51,867
But I think today, I'd like to take a moment

92
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:54,407
and kind of assume the best.

93
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:55,848
Because I want to assume that all of you

94
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:59,369
are here in this advocacy talk, because what I've said so far

95
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:01,809
is already familiar, already painful.

96
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,950
And I want to kind of assume that you have sat with that.

97
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,631
Or if it's not your experience, you've

98
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:07,791
already sat and listened to that.

99
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:13,979
in other areas and rather I think than spending the next 15 or so minutes kind of sitting

100
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:19,245
in that pain, I want to share some examples from my own experience and then kind of discuss

101
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:24,010
how we can do better and find different and more interesting ways of talking about this

102
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:30,456
stuff as creatives and as advocates and as people who overall want practical solutions

103
00:06:30,496 --> 00:06:31,397
to these kinds of problems.

104
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,933
So let's talk about video games.

105
00:06:36,054 --> 00:06:37,736
To begin, a lot of the work that I do

106
00:06:37,976 --> 00:06:40,299
is in narrative consultation and narrative design.

107
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,541
And one of the things that I offer

108
00:06:41,581 --> 00:06:43,343
as part of my list of services

109
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,687
is risk assessment and sensitivity reading.

110
00:06:47,427 --> 00:06:49,450
And so recently I was consulting on a project

111
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,411
that was a dating simulator.

112
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:55,627
and I was faced with a very simple decision point that the writers were trying to achieve

113
00:06:55,988 --> 00:07:01,813
and it was this interaction between the female-identified date and you, the protagonist,

114
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:04,215
and you could customize your gender, you could customize your appearance and everything.

115
00:07:04,955 --> 00:07:09,879
So the love interest is on a date with you and they ask you a very simple question and it's

116
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,981
what was your ex like?

117
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:18,905
is a bit much for a first date, but the player can either choose to say,

118
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:21,546
OK, my ex was a good person, but it didn't work out.

119
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:25,088
They can choose to say, I don't know if I really want to talk about that.

120
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:28,530
Or they can choose to say, my ex was a monster.

121
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,572
And choosing my ex was a monster, the woman on the date with you

122
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:33,973
goes like, yikes.

123
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:37,655
You must be so immature if that's what you're going

124
00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:39,095
to say on a date about your ex.

125
00:07:39,135 --> 00:07:39,876
Like, you must be.

126
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:43,634
not over this, you must be figuring something out.

127
00:07:44,314 --> 00:07:47,015
And I think that you lose favor in that moment

128
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:47,675
with that character.

129
00:07:47,715 --> 00:07:49,075
And I can see where the design was.

130
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:51,736
Like, I understand that what they wanted to do

131
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:53,476
was just have a very simple question where

132
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:56,397
if you respond, your date can say,

133
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:58,798
I like that, or I don't like that,

134
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,558
or kind of be neutral about it.

135
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,939
But I played through that,

136
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:05,159
and I realized something that they hadn't really seen,

137
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:05,920
and it's that,

138
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,031
this question was deeply gendered,

139
00:08:10,171 --> 00:08:12,372
despite the fact that they didn't even intend that.

140
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:18,794
When we treat, I guess, cis, hetero, male characters

141
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:21,115
as the default, we end up with questions like this.

142
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:23,796
And I say that because, while it's a generalization,

143
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:26,737
when we have those characters and they say something like,

144
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:30,018
hey, my ex is a monster, what we're being asked to assume

145
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:31,938
is that that person has a crazy ex-girlfriend.

146
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:34,179
or being asked to assume that they're being immature

147
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:37,400
or they might have a real harpy at home.

148
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:39,921
It's almost like a laugh line a lot of the time.

149
00:08:40,742 --> 00:08:46,764
So I asked, hey, what if I'm playing as a woman?

150
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:52,476
because what I had to explain very delicately was that if I'm playing as a woman and I'm

151
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:57,438
assuming that I'm interacting with a woman and we don't know about my ex, there's an

152
00:08:57,498 --> 00:09:02,119
upsettingly high likelihood that when I say to another woman, my ex was a monster, what

153
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:06,561
I'm referring to was an abusive situation rather than just an immature joke.

154
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:10,102
And so I actually said, you know what though, don't worry about it.

155
00:09:10,722 --> 00:09:14,064
We can create a condition for this because if you respond to that person by saying,

156
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:17,865
hey, my ex was a monster, what if she digs a little deeper?

157
00:09:18,586 --> 00:09:21,427
What if she checks and says, hey, is that a pain point for you?

158
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:23,928
Or says like, oh, is that something touchy for you?

159
00:09:24,368 --> 00:09:27,210
Or maybe says like, do you mean that as a flippant remark?

160
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,231
Because I think that even though this game is light,

161
00:09:30,351 --> 00:09:34,313
it would be a genuinely important moment to be able to express that sentiment in a game.

162
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:37,434
And when I suggested that, the writing team was like,

163
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:39,476
Okay, thank you for this insight.

164
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,208
And then they just like, took it away.

165
00:09:43,657 --> 00:09:46,878
They got nervous, and I think that is the problem

166
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:49,319
that we face when we think of representation

167
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:52,160
as a challenge that we just need to like surmount.

168
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,561
We could just like go, nope, solved, we did it.

169
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:55,641
Because we took it away,

170
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:56,801
and we don't have to face it anymore.

171
00:09:57,442 --> 00:10:00,563
But I thought here, this was an opportunity for innovation.

172
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,944
Here we had the chance to make a woman

173
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:05,445
who has been victimized, see herself in a game,

174
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:07,685
be able to express something to another woman in a game,

175
00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:09,806
and kind of actually relate to it.

176
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:12,267
And we had that opportunity,

177
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:16,411
we pulled back because we thought it was safer not to push forward.

178
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:20,074
And after the whole thing was done, the team thanked me again and they said like,

179
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:22,857
thanks so much, you really mitigated the risk.

180
00:10:23,777 --> 00:10:28,262
And I think that the way that we talk about this kind of thing is itself a problem.

181
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:30,116
We need sensitivity readers.

182
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:31,817
We need risk assessment.

183
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:34,118
And these are, again, important services

184
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:37,279
that I literally list on every PDF that I send out

185
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:39,799
to be like, hey, I can do risk assessment and sensitivity

186
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:40,139
reading.

187
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,160
But I think when we do that kind of work

188
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,381
and we make it seem like what we're doing is being very

189
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:48,242
careful, being very scared.

190
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:52,619
we end up just kind of sanding down all the rough edges

191
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:54,380
instead of building something new

192
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,400
and building something out.

193
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:57,601
And that means that we feel daunted

194
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:58,982
when we discuss representation

195
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:02,443
because we talk a lot about representation

196
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:03,924
as the mitigation of pain,

197
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,945
but we don't talk about representation as a creator of joy.

198
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:12,620
Because I would genuinely love just once to be called into one of these consulting sessions

199
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,042
and instead of being asked like, hey, can you tell us how this is going to hurt people

200
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:21,283
like you, just be asked, hey, what would you like to see people like you do in this game?

201
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:25,745
What experiences can people like you bring to the world of the game that we haven't seen

202
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:26,105
before?

203
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:30,546
What's a cool thing that you want to see from characters who look and act like you?

204
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,910
And it's not the way we're taught to talk about it, but I think it could be.

205
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:41,117
Because even when we're doing narrative design, we're looking at archetypes every time we want to have a set of answers, right?

206
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:46,723
We're looking, this is what a rebel would do, this is what a jerk would do, this is what a more straight-laced person would do.

207
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:52,850
And I think I would love to start thinking about more like, what option can we make for people who haven't been seen?

208
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,911
What can we add?

209
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:55,964
that provides a new perspective

210
00:11:56,064 --> 00:11:57,365
that we've never explored before.

211
00:11:58,005 --> 00:11:59,525
So I think if we prioritize joy

212
00:12:00,225 --> 00:12:02,206
and start to frame representation

213
00:12:02,946 --> 00:12:05,467
as a new form of innovation,

214
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:07,247
rather than as pain avoidance

215
00:12:07,347 --> 00:12:09,868
and like surface level diversity,

216
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:12,448
we're gonna actually start to win a few more battles

217
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,009
and generate moments of actual happiness.

218
00:12:16,081 --> 00:12:20,626
So this is kind of all up in the air, but I want to give an example of what these kinds

219
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:24,531
of wins can look like, or at least what they have looked like in the past for me.

220
00:12:25,472 --> 00:12:29,016
And I kind of want to say, okay, imagine me now as a player.

221
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:32,961
Because this is my go-to example, and it's something that I talk about all the time,

222
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,205
and it's the first time that I ever made a black character in a video game.

223
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:41,094
And this is genuinely embarrassing to relate to a crowd of people,

224
00:12:41,614 --> 00:12:43,836
but for a really long time before this,

225
00:12:44,337 --> 00:12:46,599
when I was offered like a character customization screen,

226
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:49,823
I was like, well, I can't put myself in there because that...

227
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:51,763
that's weird and not what video games are.

228
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:56,165
And so I made some stubbly white dude protagonists,

229
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:59,287
even when I had every option available to me

230
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:00,788
because I didn't want to feel like I was putting

231
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:03,389
too much of myself into this world where I didn't belong.

232
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,050
And it's wild to think about,

233
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,631
I just created Nathan Drake, so I was like,

234
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:08,892
go, explore every game.

235
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:11,654
But anyway, the first time that I actually made

236
00:13:11,714 --> 00:13:14,435
a black protagonist was in Mass Effect in 2010.

237
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,316
And that felt really, really great.

238
00:13:18,138 --> 00:13:22,643
And I know that everyone at GDC has seen a lot about Mass Effect.

239
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:25,426
So many talks talk about Mass Effect, so I think it's very important.

240
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:30,712
But for anyone who's never played it, I'm just going to give you a little rundown of the first playable area.

241
00:13:31,472 --> 00:13:37,239
Basically, your fully customized Commander Shepard has to enter a space station and rendezvous with two characters.

242
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:44,004
Jacob Taylor and Miranda Lawson, but you meet Jacob first and for those of you who don't know Jacob is a black man

243
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:49,509
He's a marine and he's your first kind of like point of contact. So your first interaction with him

244
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:53,052
You're like crouching behind cover and you're having a close-quarters conversation

245
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:59,815
And when this happened in the game, it was this really powerful and remarkable moment for me,

246
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:04,779
because it was two black characters talking one-on-one, and neither of them is cast as a

247
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:08,721
criminal, they're not a sidekick, they're not a savage, they're not a stereotype, they're not

248
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:13,864
a gang member. And they're the only two people on screen in this moment talking about something

249
00:14:13,905 --> 00:14:20,469
much greater than them. And it was just like, really, really, really nice. I left off a really.

250
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:27,051
I was so happy about this moment that I actually took my phone out to text my white best friend

251
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:32,416
and I was like, wow, it was really just cool to see this scene in this game, can you believe

252
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:32,516
it?

253
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:37,620
And I was halfway through the text when I realized, oh, she isn't going to see that

254
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,343
because her shepherd doesn't look the same as mine.

255
00:14:41,183 --> 00:14:45,487
But I texted her anyway because I thought, you know what, I'm going to share this moment

256
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:47,929
of joy for me and she's my best friend so she has to be happy about it.

257
00:14:49,032 --> 00:14:53,634
And her response, while not surprising, was still very touching because she said,

258
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:54,994
I've never seen that either.

259
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:57,996
And holy moly, that's cool.

260
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:00,557
And I told some other friends at that point.

261
00:15:00,577 --> 00:15:02,158
I was kind of like excited about it.

262
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:03,678
And they weren't all black, these friends.

263
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:06,240
They weren't all targeted by this moment that I had experienced.

264
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,021
But they all felt the same thing when they heard me tell my story,

265
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:11,342
and when they heard that it was a new kind of term.

266
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:15,604
And the general idea was, holy moly, representation is cool.

267
00:15:17,036 --> 00:15:21,805
But in my mass effect experience, this is almost an accidental form of representation

268
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:23,568
because it's something that's a possibility.

269
00:15:23,927 --> 00:15:28,208
It's not guaranteed for any player depending on the kind of character in the Commander Shepard that you make.

270
00:15:28,968 --> 00:15:36,390
So I thought, wouldn't it be amazing if this wasn't an accident, but it was actually the intention of the game designers.

271
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:41,591
What if they actually said, you know what, we're going to set out to create a moment of joy in people who look like this,

272
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,832
people who feel represented by this.

273
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,953
And that I think would be amazing, and it's totally possible for us,

274
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:53,434
because these are things that we can actually create as designers and as writers and as creators.

275
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:58,117
And not only are they new, but they're very, very narratively compelling, and I think that's

276
00:15:58,597 --> 00:16:03,380
ultimately what we should strive for. Because the newness of it works not only for those who are,

277
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,444
you know, being immediately targeted, but it works for everyone in that group, everyone who kind of

278
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:12,787
receives it and has never seen this before. Because keep in mind that when it's new for you,

279
00:16:13,827 --> 00:16:18,190
odds are they've never seen it either. So you're not actually catering to one tiny group,

280
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,192
you're catering to everyone who's going to be playing it. It's across the board.

281
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:25,996
That's a lesson I think that we keep failing to teach.

282
00:16:26,497 --> 00:16:28,438
Because we keep saying, okay, this one's for you guys,

283
00:16:28,718 --> 00:16:30,360
this one's for you guys, and this one over here,

284
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:30,960
you can have it.

285
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,722
But we can't keep looking at representation

286
00:16:33,802 --> 00:16:35,403
as we're catering to a tiny little corner

287
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:37,205
or a direct marketing effort.

288
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:41,628
It's what everyone, I think, or hope, wants as an audience.

289
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:45,171
And stepping back, it's not just,

290
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:46,071
I don't just hope, actually.

291
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:49,162
I actually think, okay, we all do want this.

292
00:16:49,662 --> 00:16:52,483
And I think, you know, especially the people in this room,

293
00:16:52,863 --> 00:16:54,744
can actively say, yeah, that's what we want to achieve.

294
00:16:55,424 --> 00:16:57,864
But then the question is, beg, why aren't we doing this?

295
00:16:58,224 --> 00:17:00,085
Like, why, when we're talking about it,

296
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:02,746
when we're so enthusiastic about it, what's stopping us?

297
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:04,646
Like, why are we still being told,

298
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:06,347
oh no, that's not what players want?

299
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:08,927
Why do I keep hearing that it's like an uphill battle

300
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:10,308
for people to bring representation

301
00:17:10,548 --> 00:17:13,208
to what should be a very inclusive environment of creativity?

302
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:16,085
And I think there are a lot of answers.

303
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:18,567
There's the fact that the industry's stuck in its ways.

304
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,968
The industry isn't as diverse as it should be or could be.

305
00:17:22,729 --> 00:17:25,190
We're all socialized in this society

306
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,092
to kind of act against it and to fall into what is normal.

307
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:30,613
And there's like a dozen other answers

308
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,554
that are all like variations on those themes.

309
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:36,116
But kind of like a pseudo fun fact about me,

310
00:17:36,316 --> 00:17:37,277
that's slightly fun,

311
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:38,878
is that I actually have a marketing degree.

312
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,099
And so I wanna put on that like,

313
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:48,607
very mercenary hat for a second and talk about the way that we decide how we're going to sell the art that we make and

314
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:50,790
how we're going to approach the audiences that we make it for.

315
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:53,612
Because I think so often when people like us get told,

316
00:17:53,832 --> 00:17:56,233
you know, from higher ups or from society at large,

317
00:17:56,573 --> 00:17:57,833
this isn't what players want,

318
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:01,314
it's not a conversation about demographic,

319
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:03,694
sorry, content, it's a conversation about demographics.

320
00:18:04,515 --> 00:18:06,015
And I think that in our industry

321
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:07,935
and in so many creative industries,

322
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:09,796
if you want to look at film and television

323
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:12,977
and any art form, we start treating our core demographics

324
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:15,077
as a fixed and static value,

325
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,797
something that does not want to change

326
00:18:16,817 --> 00:18:17,998
and something that is locked in place.

327
00:18:18,578 --> 00:18:20,698
So despite like the changing face of audiences,

328
00:18:20,758 --> 00:18:21,298
despite this.

329
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,963
changing face of conferences like this one, we still look at our core

330
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:29,528
demographics and say okay they're white, cis, hetero males and we cater almost

331
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:34,093
exclusively to them. And the problem is that we don't just cater to them like

332
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,157
you know here here's something that we think you'll enjoy, we cater them the way

333
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:38,819
that we cater to like a picky baby.

334
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:42,077
We feed them the same thing that we know that they love,

335
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:43,759
and we keep on feeding it, we're like, here you go,

336
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:46,402
you love it, eat this, eat this, eat this,

337
00:18:46,522 --> 00:18:48,265
so that then when they get anything else,

338
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,207
they react as a picky baby would,

339
00:18:50,227 --> 00:18:53,211
which is to be like, oh no, thank you, I do not want this.

340
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:56,916
And we've actually done this so long that what we're...

341
00:18:57,777 --> 00:19:03,481
doing is creating an entire nation of picky babies, and they make us scared to deviate

342
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:07,604
from what we actually want to do. Just in case, these picky babies don't want to play

343
00:19:07,664 --> 00:19:12,128
our games. And we've made a lot of progress, obviously, like I don't say this to completely

344
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:18,293
go like, just give up, we've screwed it. But I think it's still amazing that I can be seated

345
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:22,716
in a meeting and told that out of 12 characters, we already have one black one, so there can't

346
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:23,376
possibly...

347
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:29,018
be a second. I get that way too much and I once worked on a project where they had

348
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:32,659
an all-white cast and they expressed the desire like okay we need to mix it up a

349
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:36,199
bit how about this character is kind of like stereotypically French so they have

350
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:41,921
a beret and they have like a striped shirt and I was like okay if you need to

351
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:46,261
do that can we at least make them a person of color and they said oh no

352
00:19:46,742 --> 00:19:49,402
that would be weird they're already French

353
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:57,200
So I want to do better than this because I don't say that to be like,

354
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,301
oh, you know what, I'm going to dismiss all the hate and the abuse in our communities.

355
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:04,003
But I do like to imagine that when we look at white guys,

356
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:05,243
and there's several of you here,

357
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:10,536
I think that when we look at you, we say, okay, you can't possibly enjoy this.

358
00:20:11,116 --> 00:20:16,002
But I think they want also, and maybe you want also, to experience new and different

359
00:20:16,062 --> 00:20:16,462
stories.

360
00:20:17,043 --> 00:20:21,788
I think we need to step out of this rule that white men can enjoy fantasy worlds, aliens,

361
00:20:21,908 --> 00:20:26,333
sci-fi, monsters, anything, so long as it's through a lens that looks exactly like them.

362
00:20:27,283 --> 00:20:30,627
Because if that's the kind of person that we're always going to cater to, you're never

363
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:31,488
going to innovate.

364
00:20:31,528 --> 00:20:32,590
You're never going to change things.

365
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,092
You're just going to keep feeding the picky baby.

366
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:39,919
And we cannot continue to try to create art under a system that is going to bar innovation

367
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,962
for fear of a picky baby throwing a tantrum.

368
00:20:43,316 --> 00:20:48,597
And I really don't think that it's impossible to change this because as like a woman of color,

369
00:20:49,238 --> 00:20:56,099
I have played with and like empathized with a lot of white men. I have played as Kratos,

370
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,061
who's like literally white. I've played as Nathan Drake. I've played as Arthur Morgan,

371
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:04,822
and I've loved it. And I don't think it's like pie in the sky thinking to go like...

372
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,544
hey, maybe we can invite white dudes to play as other people and

373
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:10,886
experience different things through someone else's eyes.

374
00:21:11,446 --> 00:21:14,449
And if they don't like it, we have to start thinking we're not losing,

375
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:18,752
they're losing, and we're losing because we're gonna let them

376
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,254
stand in the way of our progress and our innovation.

377
00:21:22,195 --> 00:21:27,318
And I think that we need to stop thinking that our core marketing

378
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,561
demographics have to define the exact demographics of our playable characters

379
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:31,221
and of our cast.

380
00:21:31,703 --> 00:21:34,925
And instead we start to have to assume that players do want new stories.

381
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:37,307
And that if we bring joy to our broad audience,

382
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:39,629
it's going to encompass our core audience as well.

383
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,554
And similarly, I think we need to get out of, I'm glad you're here, but

384
00:21:45,574 --> 00:21:49,317
I think that we need to start getting out of just advocacy tracking these discussions.

385
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:54,561
Because ultimately, we're seeing representation as this abstract idea.

386
00:21:54,601 --> 00:21:55,441
We're seeing it as

387
00:21:56,254 --> 00:22:00,317
this weird kind of thing that we can paint over what we're currently doing, but if we

388
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:05,782
start having these conversations as facets of narrative, as facets of marketing, as gameplay,

389
00:22:05,862 --> 00:22:10,205
as art, I think that we're actually going to be able to move beyond it because when

390
00:22:10,225 --> 00:22:16,310
we sequester advocacy into this one series, what we risk is like preaching to the choir

391
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,733
and while you guys already know this because you're here.

392
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:23,876
What's old to us can be innovative to somebody else.

393
00:22:24,356 --> 00:22:25,997
And that's still incredibly important.

394
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,679
Like all of these things I'm saying today, I'm sure you understand, but

395
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,942
you can go out into the world now and other people will hear it from you.

396
00:22:32,422 --> 00:22:34,423
Because ultimately I think that is what we need to figure out.

397
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:38,866
It's how to bring these discussions out and make innovations and content like...

398
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:41,468
the way we make them everywhere else in our industry.

399
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:43,990
But how do we do that?

400
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:46,191
I think it's one thing in narrative,

401
00:22:46,371 --> 00:22:48,813
because honestly in narrative it's a little bit easier to implement,

402
00:22:48,853 --> 00:22:50,214
because we have the power to go like,

403
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:52,936
oh, we can build choices that consider, you know,

404
00:22:52,976 --> 00:22:55,118
marginalized identities and just write them into our work.

405
00:22:55,638 --> 00:22:58,180
We can decide to tell stories that present like, you know,

406
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,202
very rare narratives and representative experiences.

407
00:23:02,183 --> 00:23:05,865
And we can kind of work on de-tokenizing our minority characters.

408
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:10,951
And so in that way, we do have a lot of power to actually affect the change that we want to see

409
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:14,413
and to work all of these concepts in our material as narrative developers.

410
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:19,515
But we still work for people, and it's another kettle of fish, I think,

411
00:23:19,996 --> 00:23:22,877
when it comes to the structures that approve these choices.

412
00:23:23,077 --> 00:23:25,819
And we have to look at them a little more institutionally,

413
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:27,479
because we can write all the stories that we want,

414
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,420
but that doesn't mean that anyone's going to buy them,

415
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,581
anyone's going to market them, anyone's going to let us do it.

416
00:23:32,863 --> 00:23:37,628
So I think I want to use my last section here to kind of outline the tools and

417
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:41,452
the techniques that I use and that my company has used to make representation

418
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:45,377
very much a staple of our offering outside of just the work that we do

419
00:23:45,577 --> 00:23:50,342
internally. So first and foremost if you're in creative development

420
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,110
If you're building a world and a story

421
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,071
and you're including characters and concepts

422
00:23:55,091 --> 00:23:58,091
that are borrowed or inspired by or based on the lives

423
00:23:58,531 --> 00:24:01,032
and the lived experiences of marginalized people,

424
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,233
firstly, I would say do not be afraid to create moments

425
00:24:04,273 --> 00:24:05,653
that are intentionally targeted

426
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:08,654
and designed to create joy in the marginalized.

427
00:24:09,674 --> 00:24:11,574
They are going to appreciate this on a level

428
00:24:11,934 --> 00:24:13,255
that your core audience won't,

429
00:24:13,295 --> 00:24:14,575
but it doesn't mean that you're going to exclude

430
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:15,835
your core audience in doing that.

431
00:24:16,395 --> 00:24:18,216
Do not make it so that marginalized people

432
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:22,668
when they're playing your game have to do all the work to create representation

433
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,433
themselves by creating that custom character.

434
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:29,754
Also, don't fall into this trap that I think a lot of people fall into, which is they think,

435
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:36,000
okay, don't worry. We can include everyone by making this single default universal experience

436
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:41,745
that is universally representative. Because usually all that means, as it did in the dating example,

437
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:46,970
is that you're aiming at your core demographic and you're probably invisibly leaning towards

438
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,352
the dominant societal voice, even if you don't realize it.

439
00:24:50,317 --> 00:24:54,781
And if you're in development and you are part of like that dominant voice,

440
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:59,104
you're like a cis, hetero, white dude or just adjacent to that,

441
00:24:59,905 --> 00:25:03,108
do not wait until the end to call your consultants.

442
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,410
Bring them in at the beginning and instead of asking them, hey,

443
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,792
is this very racist thing we did very racist?

444
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:12,295
Or is this deeply offensive thing we did deeply offensive?

445
00:25:12,355 --> 00:25:13,075
Are you hurt by it?

446
00:25:13,856 --> 00:25:16,683
Ask them what they want to see, like ask them what would thrill them, what would bring them joy,

447
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:20,251
and if you have a team lead, put that request to them very, very early.

448
00:25:21,373 --> 00:25:24,039
If you're a creative working in AAA, which I did for many, many years...

449
00:25:25,515 --> 00:25:27,076
put this stuff up to your higher ups.

450
00:25:27,596 --> 00:25:29,837
And if they don't see the value in what you're asking for

451
00:25:29,877 --> 00:25:31,838
when you ask for consultants, when you ask for research,

452
00:25:32,778 --> 00:25:34,419
go have a coffee with your marketing team

453
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:37,860
and just terrify them with the possibility

454
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,141
of what's gonna happen if they don't give you what you want.

455
00:25:40,602 --> 00:25:41,702
Because they have to consider,

456
00:25:41,742 --> 00:25:43,183
like I say that all out as a joke,

457
00:25:43,203 --> 00:25:44,363
but it's actually very, very true

458
00:25:44,403 --> 00:25:46,404
because if you start to consider the people

459
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:47,985
who are player and audience facing

460
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,145
and who have to deal with.

461
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,949
mitigating harm and with keeping the sentiment around their game and their

462
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:53,629
project positive,

463
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:57,012
there's like a genuine value that you can impress upon them with

464
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,615
both ethically and financially. You can say this is important

465
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:05,100
and it's also a valid discussion to have because if you're working with a very thin

466
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,800
narrative budget

467
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,983
and you work in AAA, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised

468
00:26:09,343 --> 00:26:12,666
or dismayed by the amount of money that marketing can give you.

469
00:26:14,802 --> 00:26:20,028
If you're not in AAA, and if you're indie or if you're freelance and you're building a budget because you still have to and you're writing up a pitch,

470
00:26:20,608 --> 00:26:26,314
I would say that you should consider adding the necessary funds for representation into your scope as you would any other item.

471
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:32,600
When we budget as Sweet Baby Inc., we actually add about 10% of our entire narrative development budget

472
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,724
to hire storytellers and collaborators who can kind of help us

473
00:26:38,143 --> 00:26:39,524
see where our blind spots are,

474
00:26:39,844 --> 00:26:41,064
and if they aren't in this industry,

475
00:26:41,104 --> 00:26:42,265
because a lot of the time people are like,

476
00:26:42,565 --> 00:26:43,605
uh-oh, they're not in this industry,

477
00:26:44,045 --> 00:26:45,946
we can actually bring them in to help us consultants

478
00:26:46,026 --> 00:26:47,066
for areas where like, you know,

479
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,867
they can start learning, we can help them learn,

480
00:26:49,887 --> 00:26:50,487
they can help us learn.

481
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:53,328
So even if it's just a small part of a project,

482
00:26:53,868 --> 00:26:55,288
all parties are gonna gain something

483
00:26:55,408 --> 00:26:57,209
and you're gonna get a perspective you really need.

484
00:26:58,252 --> 00:27:02,414
Next, if you're in communications or you're part of that scared marketing group,

485
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:07,297
assume your players want new stories and treat representation as a facet of innovation,

486
00:27:07,357 --> 00:27:08,077
as a selling point.

487
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:11,119
Leverage your game's ability to explore new perspectives.

488
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,301
And there's always going to be a positive impact in assuming this.

489
00:27:16,062 --> 00:27:18,282
Finally, if you're a studio building a team,

490
00:27:18,702 --> 00:27:20,503
hire diverse creators and pay them.

491
00:27:20,663 --> 00:27:21,423
Please pay them.

492
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:22,963
And don't stop there either.

493
00:27:23,123 --> 00:27:26,504
Don't just go into creatives with narrative and stuff.

494
00:27:27,324 --> 00:27:28,604
Make it across your team because there are a lot

495
00:27:28,624 --> 00:27:30,505
of unconscious biases in other areas.

496
00:27:31,305 --> 00:27:33,085
But always consider the ways that you can support

497
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,146
all of your people.

498
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:36,286
So don't just put, we need diverse input.

499
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,647
Explain how you're gonna support them once they're there.

500
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:41,507
Because none of what we're doing is about ticking boxes

501
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:42,868
or about a veneer of wokeness.

502
00:27:43,348 --> 00:27:45,868
We actually have to care about making this stuff.

503
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:50,993
So, to close, for those of you who are marginalized,

504
00:27:51,593 --> 00:27:54,015
whatever space you occupy in this industry,

505
00:27:54,135 --> 00:27:56,637
and I want you to know that I see you and I recognize you

506
00:27:56,657 --> 00:27:57,978
and I'm doing the work along with you,

507
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,960
and if I can suggest to you one thing,

508
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,502
is that you take kind of a moment to think about times

509
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:04,264
when you have felt seen and representative

510
00:28:04,664 --> 00:28:06,826
and share them as loudly as you possibly can.

511
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:09,588
Be loud about it, don't be afraid to ask for more of this

512
00:28:09,608 --> 00:28:11,329
than what you've felt and seen already.

513
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,871
Because we have to make sure that our tech and our mechanics

514
00:28:13,931 --> 00:28:14,812
and our teams are heard.

515
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:19,190
And representation are equal parts of our entire project.

516
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:21,793
Inclusion and representation are tools for creation

517
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:22,995
and will shape the final product.

518
00:28:23,796 --> 00:28:25,417
And for those of you who kind of represent

519
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:28,241
that dominant voice, I want to invite you to be brave

520
00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:30,744
and to be empathetic and to open yourselves

521
00:28:31,004 --> 00:28:33,407
and your teams to the voices that you haven't heard enough.

522
00:28:33,987 --> 00:28:38,410
Because if you do, I think you'll be genuinely amazed by the stories and the new directions

523
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:42,393
that you'll be able to explore together, and you're going to be inviting people into this

524
00:28:42,433 --> 00:28:46,435
feeling of representation and empowerment that you have been very lucky to enjoy your

525
00:28:46,455 --> 00:28:46,796
whole life.

526
00:28:47,616 --> 00:28:52,439
Because I think at the end of the day, what we have to say is that video games are fun,

527
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,122
and if we work hard enough, we can actually make them fun for everyone.

528
00:28:57,283 --> 00:28:57,503
Thank you.
