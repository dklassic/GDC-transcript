00:00:05,702 --> 00:00:09,222
Hey guys, thank you so much for coming this last day at GDC.

2
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:13,103
It's awesome to see all of you here, a lot of people.

3
00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:16,424
And I'm excited to share with you guys some of the things

4
00:00:16,644 --> 00:00:19,765
that came out of the development of our latest game

5
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:21,585
over Naughty Dog, Uncharted 4.

6
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:23,526
By the way, I'm Andrew.

7
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:25,346
That's as much of an introduction

8
00:00:25,386 --> 00:00:26,186
as you're going to get, because we're

9
00:00:26,206 --> 00:00:27,227
going to jump right into it.

10
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:31,447
So first of all, I'm just curious, right out of the box,

11
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:34,768
how many people are excited about the new Uncharted

12
00:00:34,988 --> 00:00:35,428
show of hands?

13
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:38,909
That's awesome you guys, thank you.

14
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,830
Now here's a question, how many people came to this talk?

15
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:46,351
Mostly because it was about Uncharted

16
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,271
and not like the other things.

17
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:52,132
Oh yeah, that's, no that's good, that's awesome.

18
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,253
So then I'm assuming most people came to this talk

19
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:56,634
because it was about technical art, is that right?

20
00:00:58,614 --> 00:00:59,034
Right on.

21
00:00:59,394 --> 00:01:01,975
And then how many people came because the talk

22
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:03,895
had the word culture in its name?

23
00:01:06,113 --> 00:01:07,133
That's actually impressive.

24
00:01:07,473 --> 00:01:08,474
A couple of hands, that's good.

25
00:01:08,494 --> 00:01:09,234
That's good.

26
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:14,496
OK, so since a lot of people here are excited about Uncharted,

27
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:17,757
I figured we'd actually start with our story trailer,

28
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:20,157
just in case some of you guys haven't seen it yet.

29
00:01:20,277 --> 00:01:23,178
And that should give you some of the context about the things

30
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:25,139
we're talking about and the graphical fidelity

31
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:28,720
we're shooting for, and all kinds of things like that.

32
00:01:33,842 --> 00:01:35,502
We were meant for this, Nathan.

33
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:45,944
We were destined for something great.

34
00:01:45,964 --> 00:01:57,491
For those who prove worthy, paradise awaits.

35
00:02:00,673 --> 00:02:02,855
Took a long time for him to get out of this game.

36
00:02:02,895 --> 00:02:03,835
He's meant for this life.

37
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:05,076
Oh, oh crap!

38
00:02:05,797 --> 00:02:08,859
Last I checked, we're all a bunch of thieves, digging around where we shouldn't.

39
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,200
Shame we're not on the same side.

40
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:18,885
I am a man of fortune and I must seek my fortune.

41
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:22,827
So, are you ready to seek your fortune?

42
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:27,409
Hang on, Nathan!

43
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:28,750
Murder the artifact.

44
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,190
Heads up!

45
00:02:33,204 --> 00:02:35,645
I made a promise that I was done with this life.

46
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:37,607
How long have you been chasing this thing?

47
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:38,267
A long time.

48
00:02:38,428 --> 00:02:40,209
A real long time.

49
00:02:40,249 --> 00:02:40,969
Just you and me.

50
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,672
No offense to these guys, but they don't get it.

51
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:48,215
If you're done lying to me, then you should stop lying to yourself.

52
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:52,218
The biggest pirate treasure of all time is within our grasp.

53
00:02:52,258 --> 00:02:52,938
Watch out!

54
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,761
Look, Nate, I'm gonna make you a one-time offer.

55
00:02:57,982 --> 00:02:58,803
Drop everything.

56
00:02:59,604 --> 00:03:00,044
Go home.

57
00:03:04,677 --> 00:03:05,257
Live your life.

58
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:09,079
Or we can just end it right here.

59
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:11,680
There's gotta be another way.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:23,026
I need you on this one.

61
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:26,287
Sam!

62
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:29,669
You ever wonder, like, different choices, how we might have ended up?

63
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:30,809
No.

64
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,931
I like the hand we've been dealt.

65
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:41,286
Yay.

66
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:43,628
So that was that.

67
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:44,369
Thank you.

68
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:44,729
Thank you.

69
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:45,090
Thank you.

70
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,350
Thank you.

71
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:45,570
Thank you.

72
00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:49,494
Thank you.

73
00:03:49,694 --> 00:03:52,036
The entire team at Naughty Dog appreciates

74
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:53,017
that you appreciate this.

75
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:57,241
Okay, so technical art culture.

76
00:03:58,027 --> 00:04:02,393
And, first of all, well, Uncharted was obviously a big project for us.

77
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:08,663
Four years since we released a game, basically if you don't count the remaster of The Last of Us.

78
00:04:09,284 --> 00:04:12,809
And it was also the first project that we built from ground up, working for Next-Gen.

79
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:15,810
And that was obviously a lot of work.

80
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,571
But the one thing that's interesting to me

81
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:20,352
is something that I wanted to accentuate in this talk,

82
00:04:20,532 --> 00:04:23,693
mostly was the lessons that we learned culturally.

83
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:26,034
We are gonna talk about some of the specifics

84
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:27,075
of tech implementations,

85
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,496
but it's not gonna be super detailed about that.

86
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:31,776
But the one thing that's really cool

87
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,297
is we might have some time at the end,

88
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:35,738
so if you guys feel like you're super curious

89
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:37,499
to find out about one of the other tool

90
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,819
or feature that you've seen here,

91
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,300
just write it down, ask me a question,

92
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,340
I'll be happy to elaborate.

93
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,048
end. And we'll probably also hang out in the wrap up room.

94
00:04:44,128 --> 00:04:48,482
So that's awesome. But, oh, also a tease.

95
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:52,748
just so that you don't fall asleep until the end of the presentation

96
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:57,793
closer to the end I will reveal a secret, it's not a marketing secret or anything like that

97
00:04:58,213 --> 00:05:01,116
but it nevertheless was kind of a revelation for me

98
00:05:01,296 --> 00:05:03,638
because Uncharted 4 was my first project in Naughty Dog

99
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:09,083
and figuring out what is sort of the secret sauce of making these kinds of games

100
00:05:09,724 --> 00:05:13,688
and I'm going to talk about that but not before we talk about all the other things

101
00:05:15,092 --> 00:05:20,534
So, this talk is broken up into a series of takeaways.

102
00:05:21,414 --> 00:05:22,374
Specifically seven.

103
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:26,176
And yeah, basically we're gonna talk about these points

104
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:28,817
in the context of sort of cultural takeaways

105
00:05:28,857 --> 00:05:30,938
and then kind of amplify with the examples

106
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,558
from the real production,

107
00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:34,679
like the tools that we ended up developing

108
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,100
or approaches that we ended up taking.

109
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:41,294
And so, first one is a game developer versus a specialist.

110
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:43,936
And I'm sure you guys have encountered something like this

111
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:44,876
throughout your career.

112
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:48,638
Maybe you haven't sort of, kind of verbalized it

113
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:51,299
or just analyzed it in this particular angle,

114
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:53,360
but there are different people in this industry.

115
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,322
Some of them care very deeply about their specialization.

116
00:05:56,382 --> 00:05:58,123
They are bad-ass at characters.

117
00:05:58,183 --> 00:05:59,663
They are bad-ass at textures.

118
00:06:00,164 --> 00:06:03,505
And this is what they kind of pay the most attention

119
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:04,606
and the most time to.

120
00:06:05,226 --> 00:06:09,691
But also there are sort of a different group of people that is interesting to see emerge

121
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:15,176
Considering that we get more and more people that actually grew up with video games. They're actually in the video games

122
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:22,884
Precisely to do just that to make video games and making like having a specialization is more of a vehicle for them to be making games

123
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:27,469
They care about making a game more than they care about making the best textures in the world for example

124
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:30,470
And something that we do at Naughty Dog,

125
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,232
and you guys probably heard about it,

126
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:35,095
is that we don't have managers, we don't have producers,

127
00:06:35,176 --> 00:06:37,398
we have an incredibly flat hierarchy.

128
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:41,583
It's very self-managed or mismanaged most of the time.

129
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:47,348
But it's fun, it's the approach that we find to be creative,

130
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:50,090
and also it eliminates a lot of bureaucracy,

131
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,651
where if there's a cause that you feel

132
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:56,474
extremely strongly about, you don't have to go to your boss,

133
00:06:56,494 --> 00:06:58,075
who in turn will go to his boss,

134
00:06:58,115 --> 00:06:59,556
and then he'll talk to the other boss

135
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:01,177
of the other department, they'll figure something out.

136
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:03,498
If there's an issue that a texture artist finds

137
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:04,759
with like how lighting makes,

138
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,040
he can just go talk to lighters and programmers right away

139
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,961
and they're gonna figure it out.

140
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:12,586
on the spot. And what happens, what emerges from that kind of scenario a lot of the time

141
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:17,251
is that different people at different times basically become kind of micro-producers of

142
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:22,517
certain features that they're most passionate about. And I think that kind of allows that

143
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:26,021
mentality of being a game developer more than you are a specialist to flourish.

144
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:33,328
because that way people can actually see through a feature for the game that they're most passionate about

145
00:07:33,348 --> 00:07:37,432
without actually having the capacity to do the entire thing on your own.

146
00:07:37,912 --> 00:07:41,196
So this kind of number one cultural takeaway, I guess, is that

147
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:49,724
at least in our experience and in my personal opinion, it's really great for kind of fluidity of problem solving in your company.

148
00:07:50,545 --> 00:07:53,507
when that ability is only limited by the capacity

149
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:55,429
of the individuals to self-organize

150
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:58,671
and to get buy-in from other people in other departments.

151
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,854
And yes, that sometimes becomes pretty chaotic,

152
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:04,235
but we choose to roll with it

153
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:07,938
and sort of deal with the aftermath.

154
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:10,700
And yeah, organizations tend to be pretty big,

155
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,522
so shifting focus is hard and takes a lot of time,

156
00:08:13,582 --> 00:08:15,024
and that kind of helps alleviate that,

157
00:08:15,084 --> 00:08:17,686
where like, okay, something needs to be done super quick

158
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:18,946
and it does get done.

159
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,231
And that was our takeaway number one.

160
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,634
Okay, this one is a bit more interesting.

161
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:30,895
Or maybe not more interesting,

162
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:32,095
but nevertheless interesting.

163
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:35,337
So doing programming for features

164
00:08:35,397 --> 00:08:37,458
that are inherently visual,

165
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:42,240
you can very clearly see a difference in approaches

166
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,101
between programmers and people coming

167
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:44,961
from the art background.

168
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:48,546
And it's quite prominent and at the end of the day,

169
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:50,548
something that we found in this project is,

170
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:53,212
the programming of these features can actually rely

171
00:08:53,312 --> 00:08:56,396
on a lot of art fundamentals that artists sort of bring over

172
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,298
from their discipline into the logic

173
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,601
and their approach to creation of that code.

174
00:09:01,061 --> 00:09:04,346
And so, one example, and I probably bring.

175
00:09:04,926 --> 00:09:08,307
So this is a picture by Robert Ruppel, our director.

176
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,787
This is his Graphical A-Series,

177
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:11,527
and I probably use an image of his

178
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:13,387
like every single talk that I do,

179
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,888
because it's really fucking badass.

180
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:19,869
But on top of that, it also illustrates a very good point,

181
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:22,369
and that is you can be very graphical,

182
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:25,269
you can do a minimal amount of brush strokes

183
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:26,710
with them being very deliberate,

184
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,770
and you can get something that looks very detailed

185
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,111
and very realistic, even though you don't have to invest

186
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:34,011
in all the details.

187
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:36,732
that go along with making a realistic image.

188
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:37,592
And as far as production,

189
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:40,533
that's an incredibly helpful methodology

190
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:44,834
and that also does apply to producing technology.

191
00:09:45,474 --> 00:09:48,115
And a good example of that would be our wind system.

192
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:49,796
The first implementation of the wind system we had

193
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:53,877
in Uncharted 4 was written entirely within the confines

194
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:54,937
of the programming department.

195
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:57,758
And it was all about multiple layers of...

196
00:09:58,058 --> 00:10:00,059
of complicated three-dimensional noises

197
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:02,720
that had their own frequencies and scales

198
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,761
and you had to balance them out

199
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:05,541
using like a sheet of float values

200
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:07,282
to get something to work right.

201
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:11,443
And eventually, it was just too complicated

202
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:12,444
for the artist to handle.

203
00:10:12,804 --> 00:10:13,604
It was too cumbersome.

204
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:15,645
So we ended up revamping that system

205
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:18,526
and turning it into more of an artist-based iteration

206
00:10:18,606 --> 00:10:20,727
where all we did was a super simple,

207
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,028
almost sign-based function for ambient motion

208
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:25,889
that was just slightly tweaked by like a 3D noise.

209
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:29,638
and the only parameters that we left exposed were the wind intensity

210
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:33,287
basically how far the wind can push a particular sub-object

211
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:34,611
and the speed of it.

212
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:37,027
and that covered the entire game.

213
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:41,048
And so the cool thing is,

214
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:43,568
I'm actually gonna share with you guys

215
00:10:43,588 --> 00:10:44,988
some of the videos that we do internally

216
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:47,549
and that we do for like other Sony meetings,

217
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:50,990
partly because the release of Uncharted 4 got shifted,

218
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,870
so I can't show you a lot of the things from the game

219
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,650
that you haven't seen yet.

220
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,670
So it's cool, because you're gonna get

221
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,251
a sort of a behind the scene look

222
00:10:57,311 --> 00:10:58,371
at some of the stuff that we've done,

223
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:01,211
and this particular video will feature

224
00:11:01,251 --> 00:11:03,032
a lot of the WIND stuff that I just talked about,

225
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:04,872
so you can kind of take a peek.

226
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:14,803
Take that, Neo-Gap.

227
00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:28,315
Thanks guys, that was one of the internal videos we made

228
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:29,776
for like a Sony get together.

229
00:13:30,296 --> 00:13:32,456
And so you're probably some of the first people

230
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:34,417
to see it outside of Sony, so yay.

231
00:13:35,237 --> 00:13:38,818
But yeah, so as you can see a lot of that foliage tech

232
00:13:38,838 --> 00:13:42,439
that we've shown, like even something as complex

233
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:44,639
as like a palm tree that has sort of multiple layers

234
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:45,240
of inheritance.

235
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,722
was entirely done sort of within the art department

236
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:52,044
by just utilizing vertical shaders and big pivots.

237
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:55,767
And the final implementation I think allowed us to have

238
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:58,709
sort of up to four layers of hierarchy

239
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:02,631
as to how we can kind of construct that motion.

240
00:14:03,812 --> 00:14:07,255
And yeah, it was pretty transparent and in general

241
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:09,816
ended up simplifying the work for the artists a lot.

242
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:12,678
I'm assuming there might be more questions about this,

243
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:14,099
but we can talk about them at the end.

244
00:14:15,223 --> 00:14:19,569
So, to move on.

245
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:24,535
You guys have probably heard the saying that

246
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,199
when you're a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.

247
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:31,352
And I think part of it is you're really, really smart.

248
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:34,153
You kind of want to solve a problem in a really cool,

249
00:14:34,193 --> 00:14:35,493
smart and sophisticated way.

250
00:14:37,073 --> 00:14:40,994
And this is something that is very curious

251
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:42,754
because something that I found on this project

252
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:45,215
is being ignorant in some subjects

253
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:46,995
actually ended up helping quite a lot.

254
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:50,076
Because, and I actually had to tone down the title

255
00:14:50,116 --> 00:14:52,756
because it actually initially was being stupid pays.

256
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:55,658
I decided to go for something less incendiary.

257
00:14:56,338 --> 00:15:00,760
So basically, there are problems that have complex solutions.

258
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,161
And sometimes you just cannot afford the proper solution.

259
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:07,783
Or for example, if you're aware of the proper solution,

260
00:15:07,943 --> 00:15:09,904
your mind might just be conditioned

261
00:15:09,964 --> 00:15:12,165
into pursuing that similar avenue

262
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:13,966
without actually branching into all

263
00:15:14,006 --> 00:15:16,067
these other interesting creative directions.

264
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:19,108
So something that helps and something

265
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:21,049
that I try to do as an exercise at this point

266
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:22,990
is whenever I'm researching a new feature.

267
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,871
or just a piece of technology that we need to implement,

268
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:29,572
instead of going and researching the living crap out of it

269
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,313
right away, you sit down and you brainstorm for a little,

270
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,353
you write down every crazy idea of how you think

271
00:15:34,673 --> 00:15:37,034
that can be achieved, and then you go and you research

272
00:15:37,074 --> 00:15:39,855
a little bit more so that they can kind of drive

273
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:42,635
your creative ideation process a little further

274
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:43,876
and a little further, and then when you think

275
00:15:43,896 --> 00:15:44,936
you have a handle on the problem.

276
00:15:45,276 --> 00:15:48,037
you go and you actually look at how other people do it entirely.

277
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:53,239
And that way you kind of end up with a lot of tangents and weird ideas

278
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:57,240
that might serve a different purpose or just be a more simplified version of that feature.

279
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,942
And that helped us a lot because we solved issues that were not necessarily trivial.

280
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:05,203
And actually some of them you've seen, right?

281
00:16:05,243 --> 00:16:09,204
Like the shirt simulation that was in the previous video with the wind,

282
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:10,885
that was like an entirely shader hack.

283
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:15,207
Our hair wind is 100% the same tech that you've seen on the grass.

284
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:20,331
It ties into the same system. There is a global world gust, so they're kind of integrated together.

285
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:26,375
And basically all of these creative solutions that, like, say the hair gravity,

286
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:29,276
because you guys have seen like the Drake's hair, when it's wet it gets droopy.

287
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:31,338
So like, we never in...

288
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:37,151
in our lifetime could probably, well not in our lifetime probably, but in the development time that we had

289
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:40,955
could figure out a cheap enough solution to simulate like individual strands of hair

290
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:45,040
as far as how they behave. So just doing super cheap hacks like this

291
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,924
which was literally three lines of shader code when you have the correct data

292
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:49,405
as to like...

293
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:50,946
Where's the root of the hair?

294
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:53,148
What's the normal of the head underneath?

295
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:55,610
And we just had to pack it all into build,

296
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,711
and we have access to that.

297
00:16:57,012 --> 00:16:58,893
And then we just sort of just droop it down a little.

298
00:16:59,234 --> 00:16:59,974
It looks convincing.

299
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:02,056
It even looks dynamic, even though it really

300
00:17:02,136 --> 00:17:02,797
isn't that much.

301
00:17:02,837 --> 00:17:04,298
There is no secondary motion to it.

302
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,100
But it works, and it's super hacky.

303
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,803
And the only reason we did it is because it was very apparent

304
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:11,205
that we're not going to be able to do anything that's

305
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:13,707
really smart and sophisticated and kind of the proper way

306
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:14,128
to solve it.

307
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:21,335
So I guess it just helps to step back and sort of re-evaluate what you actually want from a feature.

308
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:26,200
And this is another one. It's once again one of those little videos that I send out to the team as to like,

309
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,100
hey, look at this thingy.

310
00:17:27,821 --> 00:17:31,164
So we wanted to have more interactivity in the world.

311
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:37,791
I don't know if you can actually see, but the individual planks under Drake's feet shift and move as he walks on them.

312
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:44,098
And it's a fairly subtle effect, but it's something that we couldn't have done without this tech.

313
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,879
Because it would be just hundreds and hundreds of physicalized objects in the world.

314
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:51,120
But now, it's also a shader trick.

315
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,361
And it's fairly easy to author.

316
00:17:54,821 --> 00:17:59,323
Artists just create sort of a target blend shape that they want for their objects.

317
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:02,704
And then every time Drake goes near, we just transition, and then we transition back.

318
00:18:03,144 --> 00:18:06,025
And if we need to, we read an additional buffer that provides persistence.

319
00:18:06,105 --> 00:18:08,046
As to like, where have you stepped a couple of frames ago.

320
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,808
and that allows us to have more variety

321
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:12,010
than we could have otherwise.

322
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,753
And it's not physicalized, it's not really smart,

323
00:18:14,813 --> 00:18:16,415
and once again, three lines of shader code,

324
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,639
but it's a very silly and simplistic solution

325
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,342
to a complex problem, but it ends up paying dividends.

326
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:24,764
So that's pretty cool.

327
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:30,270
And I think we're gonna move on to the next one.

328
00:18:32,117 --> 00:18:33,900
So this is also slightly incendiary.

329
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,502
And I do apologize.

330
00:18:35,702 --> 00:18:39,607
But I think what the kind of the biggest point

331
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:42,670
that this takeaway is trying to drive home is,

332
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:45,154
and I don't think it's entirely obvious from the get-go,

333
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:47,877
but it's at least my firm belief

334
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:49,920
that in a creative game development environment.

335
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,281
The things that we actually produce are not the goal in a sense.

336
00:18:56,361 --> 00:19:03,423
I do believe that they're a byproduct of relentless self-perfection and the love for the process.

337
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:08,804
They're essentially a byproduct. At least that's what I tend to call them because I think that

338
00:19:08,824 --> 00:19:12,185
if you want to stay competitive and if you want to stay hungry, if you want to keep studying,

339
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,365
then you can be in love with the things you do. You have to be in love.

340
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:18,969
I mean, the results. You can't be in love with the results of the things you do.

341
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:20,831
You have to be in love with the actual process.

342
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:26,258
And that's why sometimes when faced with a decision on whether to throw something away or not,

343
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:30,763
as far as piece of work goes, I mean, we all know as technical artists who probably do art,

344
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:33,846
you know how you can get attached to art and how it's hard to cut levels.

345
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,288
and looks and stuff like that.

346
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:40,270
And the same goes exactly for code and for tools.

347
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,512
But something, once again, that I found on this project

348
00:19:43,552 --> 00:19:46,753
is that every time we cut a particular implementation

349
00:19:46,793 --> 00:19:50,595
of a particular tool, we had to rewrite it

350
00:19:50,715 --> 00:19:51,676
and it was way better.

351
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:54,037
And the idea was that by the time we arrived

352
00:19:54,117 --> 00:19:55,918
at a realization that we might need to cut it,

353
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:59,280
we've probably outgrown the previous implementation.

354
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,661
So if you're ever faced with that choice,

355
00:20:03,563 --> 00:20:05,605
and you have the time and resources to do that,

356
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:07,207
then it pays off.

357
00:20:07,347 --> 00:20:09,310
And a good example, and you've probably seen

358
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,934
in that video at the very end, actually let me go back.

359
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,270
We're not gonna watch the entire thing.

360
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,872
Not the watch.

361
00:20:19,572 --> 00:20:22,473
But, okay, so this is like a little snippet

362
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:23,574
of our imposter pipeline.

363
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:25,194
And imposter.

364
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:27,295
Oh, oh, sorry.

365
00:20:27,996 --> 00:20:28,396
There you go.

366
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:30,857
So, imposters are basically flat cards

367
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:33,458
that are meant to represent 3D objects.

368
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:34,839
There we go.

369
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,600
So, you're now looking at a flat card.

370
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,062
And what you do is you bake a flip book of,

371
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:45,316
all the frames from different angles of this object

372
00:20:45,396 --> 00:20:48,178
and then you just transition through that flipbook

373
00:20:48,218 --> 00:20:49,359
based on the angle of camera.

374
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,742
And our very first implementation of that was horrible.

375
00:20:53,762 --> 00:20:56,425
At first I had to write all the shader code that did that,

376
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:57,726
which was like, hey, yeah, that's cool.

377
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,588
But then after that, there was a Photoshop script

378
00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:02,149
that would arrange all of them in a manner

379
00:21:02,189 --> 00:21:03,250
that we could use for a bake.

380
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,030
Then you'd have to save.

381
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,092
it as a level, you build a level, you run a level, I had a designer write a script that

382
00:21:08,112 --> 00:21:12,194
would actually capture all the material passes for that, and then I had to write a Photoshop

383
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:15,115
script that combined all of them and spit out all the textures, and you actually had

384
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:20,218
to go into our shader editing software, plug all those textures in, and then you would

385
00:21:20,258 --> 00:21:20,638
have something.

386
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:23,379
And then if you had to change something and iterate again,

387
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:24,720
you'd have to wait for another 10 minutes.

388
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,941
It was horrible.

389
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:27,301
It was entirely dumb.

390
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:31,103
And even before rolling it out, even though a couple of weeks

391
00:21:31,143 --> 00:21:32,704
had been spent on it, it was clear

392
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,765
that we just need to throw it out.

393
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:37,607
And because we did, the next iteration, as you see here,

394
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:38,968
literally takes one button click.

395
00:21:40,288 --> 00:21:42,649
I was able to go back to the drawing board, re-evaluate,

396
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:43,769
figure out how to make it better,

397
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:45,749
and that ended up creating a lot of framework

398
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:48,470
for a lot of our other Maya tools.

399
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,490
And that was really awesome,

400
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,491
because at this point, all you do is you select a mesh,

401
00:21:51,531 --> 00:21:54,011
you hit the bake imposter button,

402
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:56,392
and everything's done automatically.

403
00:21:56,412 --> 00:21:58,452
It captures everything in Maya, it sets up the shader,

404
00:21:58,872 --> 00:22:00,133
it creates the imposter card,

405
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,953
it actually cuts off the verts to reduce overdraw,

406
00:22:03,473 --> 00:22:04,514
it puts them in a LOD group,

407
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:06,794
and it even gives you the advisable LOD distance

408
00:22:06,814 --> 00:22:07,854
for that particular card,

409
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:09,275
based on the acceleration of the...

410
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:13,459
of the card and the size of the object.

411
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,983
So, stuff like that was really awesome.

412
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,665
Every time we ended up throwing something out,

413
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:19,967
it was always for the better.

414
00:22:20,187 --> 00:22:23,611
So I wholeheartedly recommend throwing shit out.

415
00:22:23,631 --> 00:22:24,252
It's awesome.

416
00:22:28,256 --> 00:22:28,777
What else?

417
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:34,554
Yeah, and I guess in general, the takeaway from that point is that

418
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:38,638
culturally shifting into a mentality of realizing that

419
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:40,560
tools really don't matter.

420
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,782
What matters is how they solve problems.

421
00:22:43,343 --> 00:22:47,266
And so, if you apply that as a cultural thing, it can help a lot.

422
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:51,707
This is a weird analogy, but I couldn't come up with a better one.

423
00:22:52,907 --> 00:22:59,911
You sort of create a trail of tasks that you think leads you eventually to bigger and better tools, essentially.

424
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:03,793
And this is very important at the beginning of a console generation,

425
00:23:03,853 --> 00:23:07,375
because you're probably going to be stuck with your tools for a good decade,

426
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:08,896
or at least some of them.

427
00:23:09,376 --> 00:23:15,219
So having the forethought and foresight to kind of put in the groundwork into that is...

428
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:21,455
crucial and something that was really interesting is

429
00:23:22,896 --> 00:23:25,638
we did not really anticipate how some of the tools

430
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:28,620
transitioned into solutions to other problems that we had.

431
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,241
And sometimes it wasn't really obvious how,

432
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:33,783
while making a progression of different tools,

433
00:23:33,823 --> 00:23:36,305
you would end up at a place that's entirely different.

434
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:40,256
As a simple example, that proxy thing that you've seen

435
00:23:40,697 --> 00:23:44,779
ended up un-gating an entire proxy lot pipeline

436
00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:47,261
that we had for our buildings.

437
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:49,923
If you've seen our E3 city demo, all of those buildings

438
00:23:50,223 --> 00:23:52,765
were actually allotted out to a super cheap representation

439
00:23:52,785 --> 00:23:54,626
of the building at like 50 to 70 meters,

440
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,127
and you could hardly tell the difference

441
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:58,909
because it was hand-authored geometry

442
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:00,090
with hand-authored UVs,

443
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,931
and then we just automatically bake it out

444
00:24:02,392 --> 00:24:03,893
using almost the exact.

445
00:24:04,253 --> 00:24:05,995
pipeline that we had for impostors.

446
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:08,978
The only different thing that we would do is we would generate a new QV set

447
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:11,440
and we would unwrap the original mesh

448
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,642
and then we would just capture it as if it was an impostor.

449
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,684
And that basically gave us a

450
00:24:16,826 --> 00:24:19,028
very controllable proxy-logged pipeline

451
00:24:19,428 --> 00:24:20,489
made in three hours.

452
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,112
That gave us enough flexibility to

453
00:24:23,472 --> 00:24:24,633
ship an E3 demo and

454
00:24:25,194 --> 00:24:25,874
later on the game.

455
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:28,335
It did have its kinks, but at the end of the day,

456
00:24:28,355 --> 00:24:31,376
like, those things are not fully anticipated

457
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:32,856
at the time you create the original tool,

458
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:34,856
but it can lead to so many more things.

459
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:39,497
If you're curious, or actually, you know what?

460
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:41,998
I think I might show you the next video first.

461
00:24:42,618 --> 00:24:43,858
And this one's gonna be a bit longer,

462
00:24:44,438 --> 00:24:45,958
but it's gonna mention a lot of tools,

463
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,279
and then I'll be able to illustrate

464
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,139
how we went from a tool to a tool to a tool,

465
00:24:49,219 --> 00:24:50,999
and how we ended up in a particular point.

466
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:53,120
So, there he goes.

467
00:24:54,878 --> 00:25:01,319
Also, there are going to be jumps in sound because I had to cut a couple things out because we're not allowed to show them. Sorry.

468
00:25:25,284 --> 00:25:30,486
She came, started a song, Spread her gray neck,

469
00:25:30,506 --> 00:25:38,931
About the one she loved, About the one whose letters she kept.

470
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:45,295
To the one whom you loved,

471
00:25:45,355 --> 00:25:50,278
To the one whom you cherished.

472
00:25:50,358 --> 00:25:53,180
Sing a song, sing a song, my love,

473
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,161
And fly over the bright sun.

474
00:25:58,245 --> 00:26:03,088
Let him remember the simple girl,

475
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,871
Let him hear how she sings,

476
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:10,794
Let him save the native land,

477
00:26:10,894 --> 00:26:13,716
And love for Katyusha will save.

478
00:26:13,736 --> 00:26:19,380
Let him save the native land,

479
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,063
And love for Katyusha will save.

480
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:24,924
Goodbye, my dear.

481
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:42,188
For the glory of the Foreign Power!

482
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:52,777
The one who was loved by the one whose letters she kept.

483
00:26:52,837 --> 00:27:03,821
The one who was loved by the one whose letters she kept.

484
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:06,682
Sing a song, a song for the beloved,

485
00:27:06,702 --> 00:27:09,503
Go and fly over the bright sun of light.

486
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:13,648
Look up!

487
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:13,809
Look up!!!

488
00:27:13,829 --> 00:27:13,989
Look up!!

489
00:27:33,093 --> 00:27:35,975
Let him remember a simple girl,

490
00:27:35,995 --> 00:27:37,777
Let him hear her singing,

491
00:27:37,817 --> 00:27:39,598
Let him save his native land,

492
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:42,581
And love for Katyusha he will save.

493
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:45,363
Let him save his native land,

494
00:27:45,443 --> 00:27:52,289
And love for Katyusha he will save.

495
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,574
Goodbye, my mother!

496
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:13,297
Music

497
00:28:22,213 --> 00:28:28,098
The one whom I loved, the one whose letters I have guarded

498
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:38,709
The one whom I loved, the one whose letters I have guarded

499
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:43,794
Sing songs, songs for the great, and go for the bright sun of light

500
00:28:46,895 --> 00:28:49,237
We'll go to the border, To the land of our forefathers.

501
00:28:49,277 --> 00:28:51,198
We'll go to the border, To the land of our forefathers.

502
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,942
Let him remember a simple girl,

503
00:29:12,082 --> 00:29:14,224
Let him hear her singing,

504
00:29:14,244 --> 00:29:16,625
Let him save his native land,

505
00:29:16,745 --> 00:29:21,128
And love for Katyusha he will save.

506
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:25,351
Let him save his native land,

507
00:29:25,711 --> 00:29:31,895
And love for Katyusha he will save.

508
00:29:31,955 --> 00:29:33,176
Goodbye, my dear!

509
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,182
The song was played, the song was started,

510
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:53,144
About a blue-necked horseman,

511
00:29:53,164 --> 00:29:55,226
About the one who loved him,

512
00:29:55,946 --> 00:30:00,770
About the one whose letters he had sent.

513
00:30:07,135 --> 00:30:09,458
Thank you for watching.

514
00:30:29,457 --> 00:30:32,522
sorry it was a bit long. But yeah, it just has a lot of tech.

515
00:30:32,722 --> 00:30:35,887
These are awesome programmers by the way. I don't know if

516
00:30:35,907 --> 00:30:37,710
they're here, but if you see them, feel free to hug them.

517
00:30:38,191 --> 00:30:38,571
It's fine.

518
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,013
But yeah, so as you've seen, there are a lot of tools

519
00:30:44,173 --> 00:30:45,834
that we had to develop.

520
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:49,916
And what's interesting is, so one of the things,

521
00:30:49,976 --> 00:30:51,637
and you probably were wondering why decals were there,

522
00:30:51,677 --> 00:30:53,318
Naughty Dog never had decals before.

523
00:30:53,938 --> 00:30:56,660
Also, Naughty Dog never made a game with LODs before.

524
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,801
So it was all these interesting challenges

525
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:00,662
that we had to solve that seemed kind of trivial,

526
00:31:00,762 --> 00:31:04,564
but sort of our engine setup wasn't there

527
00:31:04,604 --> 00:31:07,045
because we did things so differently for such a long time.

528
00:31:08,746 --> 00:31:14,810
So some of the most unexpected things ended up arriving at a point that was very helpful.

529
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,291
And so just the list here goes like this.

530
00:31:17,572 --> 00:31:20,974
We started with the imposter attack to generate impostors.

531
00:31:20,994 --> 00:31:22,595
Then we transitioned to the proxy lods.

532
00:31:23,075 --> 00:31:25,857
From there on we transitioned to texture capture.

533
00:31:25,897 --> 00:31:32,381
As you've seen you can take any number of game objects, arrange them on a plane, assign game materials, have them automatically tile, and be...

534
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:35,062
turned into another game material in turn.

535
00:31:35,442 --> 00:31:38,044
So we can populate all kinds of rubble and stuff like that

536
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:39,364
using actual in-game assets.

537
00:31:39,805 --> 00:31:43,567
So from then on we figured, hey, why not do like a

538
00:31:44,347 --> 00:31:46,648
pattern generator that's sort of like Substance

539
00:31:46,668 --> 00:31:49,029
where we could take in-game objects, 3D objects,

540
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:52,411
and then populate them into like a tileable rock texture

541
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:53,612
or a brick texture.

542
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,992
And we made all this tech.

543
00:31:55,052 --> 00:31:56,573
And then from then we realized that,

544
00:31:56,613 --> 00:31:58,534
hey, we have this tech to populate things,

545
00:31:58,554 --> 00:32:00,315
so why don't we actually do it for like,

546
00:32:00,775 --> 00:32:03,076
terrain or any other game objects that you want.

547
00:32:03,096 --> 00:32:04,376
So that transitioned into that.

548
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,417
And the moment we did that at tool times,

549
00:32:06,737 --> 00:32:08,557
it was running Maya, then we figured, hey,

550
00:32:08,617 --> 00:32:12,158
why not just have it run in game so we can control density

551
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:12,738
and stuff like that?

552
00:32:12,778 --> 00:32:15,359
So we ended up porting it into LiveCode.

553
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,300
And then after that, we realized,

554
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,120
and that's the one thing Naughty Dog also didn't have,

555
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,621
live update between Maya and the PS4 DevKit

556
00:32:22,861 --> 00:32:23,741
or even PS3 DevKit.

557
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:26,042
You had to assemble your scenes in Maya,

558
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:27,082
build, and see the result.

559
00:32:27,543 --> 00:32:33,831
But after we got that tech in, we actually managed to get everything moving in Maya and the game simultaneously.

560
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:39,739
And that ungated our decal problem, because we couldn't have a decent preview of decals in Maya,

561
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:43,844
because projected shaders with whatever we have in Maya is horrible.

562
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:47,688
And I'm not even sure we have a depth buffer in there to actually generate the UVs.

563
00:32:47,788 --> 00:32:51,129
So once we did that, we realized that we can have an in-game solution

564
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:54,170
and have it be updated runtime, so we actually finally added decals.

565
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,810
And from then on, the list kind of grew.

566
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,811
And what's interesting is some of the tools in the middle there,

567
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:03,011
like generating patterns, right, like generating tileable textures,

568
00:33:03,331 --> 00:33:05,212
we ended up not using very much.

569
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:07,612
Probably just a handful of people at the studio used them,

570
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,892
but the fact that we went through that stepping stone

571
00:33:10,252 --> 00:33:11,873
allowed us to ungate more things.

572
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:16,614
So I guess this is, in general, just an argument for

573
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:19,654
being aware with every new step that you take

574
00:33:20,094 --> 00:33:21,714
that you might have ungated something

575
00:33:21,754 --> 00:33:23,495
that you had locked before that you want to consider

576
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,715
or reconsider developing now

577
00:33:25,895 --> 00:33:27,355
with all the new tools that you have.

578
00:33:27,776 --> 00:33:30,316
And also that no work is lost

579
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:31,296
if you learn something from it.

580
00:33:31,336 --> 00:33:32,656
If you made something that no one used,

581
00:33:32,956 --> 00:33:35,537
but it ended up yielding you some further benefits

582
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:37,557
down the line, then it's great, and it's awesome,

583
00:33:37,857 --> 00:33:40,038
and we shouldn't treat it as a failure, per se.

584
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,560
leverage that experience for all the other things.

585
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,321
And one thing that helped us a lot also

586
00:33:45,361 --> 00:33:47,984
was that all of these tools were eventually

587
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:51,967
at like a sort of third or fourth offshoot of the ideas

588
00:33:52,387 --> 00:33:55,450
rewritten to have a common sort of class base

589
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,672
and they were very flexible and modular

590
00:33:57,712 --> 00:33:59,653
and we could add functions and reuse

591
00:33:59,673 --> 00:34:01,515
the common functionality across all of these.

592
00:34:02,296 --> 00:34:04,818
And yeah, that ended up helping a lot.

593
00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:08,785
And that would be it for this section.

594
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,228
So we're gonna go to takeaway number six.

595
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:15,691
One thing that we've mentioned is that communication

596
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:17,713
at Naughty Dog flows very freely.

597
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,395
You can go and talk to any department,

598
00:34:19,435 --> 00:34:20,516
any person at any given time.

599
00:34:20,556 --> 00:34:22,157
You can go to talk to the co-presidents

600
00:34:22,237 --> 00:34:25,060
about how our particular stats gathering system works

601
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,441
and they'll listen to you and one of them

602
00:34:26,461 --> 00:34:27,722
will actually go in and implement it,

603
00:34:27,742 --> 00:34:28,523
because he does that.

604
00:34:30,424 --> 00:34:33,086
And one thing that we found that was exceptionally useful

605
00:34:33,226 --> 00:34:36,067
is extending that communication to the technology.

606
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:37,928
One of the bigger things that we did

607
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:42,071
was allowing our particles to freely interact

608
00:34:42,091 --> 00:34:42,871
with our materials.

609
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:46,473
And there are a couple of fun videos

610
00:34:46,533 --> 00:34:48,154
to hopefully illustrate some of the ideas,

611
00:34:48,214 --> 00:34:49,475
and this is from our E3 demo.

612
00:34:49,495 --> 00:34:49,555
But.

613
00:34:50,195 --> 00:34:52,557
Manpower's at the bottom of this hill.

614
00:34:52,577 --> 00:34:53,477
Come on down.

615
00:34:57,886 --> 00:34:58,767
doing stuff like this

616
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:11,238
which seems minute and most people probably never even noticed that in the

617
00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:15,882
demo but because we've invested the time at the beginning to develop a

618
00:35:15,942 --> 00:35:18,084
communication pipeline between effects

619
00:35:18,724 --> 00:35:20,706
and uh... shaders

620
00:35:21,571 --> 00:35:24,452
we were able to ungate this technology very fast.

621
00:35:24,532 --> 00:35:27,413
The entirety of our E3 demo was made in about seven weeks.

622
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:30,894
And that includes the development of the proxy tech

623
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:32,754
for buildings and stuff like this

624
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:34,275
and actually producing things.

625
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:36,415
So it's pretty crazy, pretty hectic.

626
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,856
But the way this works is...

627
00:35:38,876 --> 00:35:47,878
As you run into things, what we do is we...

628
00:35:49,499 --> 00:35:52,561
leverage our existence systems to create a particle.

629
00:35:53,062 --> 00:35:55,703
And that particle is attached to the vehicle that you're shading.

630
00:35:56,144 --> 00:35:59,506
But what that particle is doing is, it's only writing into a buffer

631
00:35:59,566 --> 00:36:00,907
that's being read by the shader.

632
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:05,510
And so the shader reads that buffer and uses it as a layer blend for damage.

633
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:06,951
Now you can see the buffer.

634
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:12,634
Or it uses it as a blend for a vertex color baked blend shape on the geometry.

635
00:36:14,745 --> 00:36:17,708
Once again, we have the, I mean the plane shape tech

636
00:36:17,748 --> 00:36:18,428
is super easy to do.

637
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:21,451
Like you just bake positions into vertex colors,

638
00:36:21,491 --> 00:36:23,032
get into the game and lerp between the two.

639
00:36:23,453 --> 00:36:25,474
These objects were skinned so we had to do some hacker

640
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:27,896
on top of that, but the fact that we had this available

641
00:36:27,916 --> 00:36:31,659
to us basically allowed us to have like a damage model

642
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:34,602
for vehicles that was super easy to set up

643
00:36:34,622 --> 00:36:37,124
because our foreground artist would just crumple a vehicle

644
00:36:37,384 --> 00:36:39,546
and then just bake that data into the original mesh.

645
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:42,808
And then we just had the particles reveal that deformation

646
00:36:42,848 --> 00:36:44,069
every time you hit the.

647
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:49,071
hit the car. So it took about three hours to implement because we had most of the

648
00:36:49,091 --> 00:36:53,332
pieces in there in the first place. And that was really cool that crosstalk

649
00:36:54,092 --> 00:36:57,133
ungated a lot of things like you've seen in the video with a foliage when you

650
00:36:57,153 --> 00:37:01,134
throw a grenade what we do is we spawn a particle that actually just have sort of

651
00:37:01,194 --> 00:37:05,935
direction vectors for where they actually gonna move the foliage and

652
00:37:05,995 --> 00:37:09,856
foliage does move and then as Drake walks through the foliage will leave his

653
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:11,956
footprints as persistent data in the same buffer

654
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:15,860
And same goes for all the NPCs and all kinds of interaction

655
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,282
because basically at this point any additional interaction

656
00:37:18,322 --> 00:37:19,943
is virtually free because the particles themselves

657
00:37:19,983 --> 00:37:22,565
are fairly cheap and we're doing the texture lookup

658
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:24,867
in the shader anyway so you can add as many objects

659
00:37:24,907 --> 00:37:27,009
to form in and affect the environment

660
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:30,592
without actually adding any additional cost.

661
00:37:31,113 --> 00:37:32,214
So that was really cool.

662
00:37:32,814 --> 00:37:39,160
We also use that for ambient effects like when, say, we add a dust blend on the environment as you walk around.

663
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,944
And then what we do is we just have a particle that spawns footsteps that actually exclude from that blend mode,

664
00:37:43,964 --> 00:37:46,307
so you're actually removing dust as you're walking through an environment.

665
00:37:46,967 --> 00:37:49,409
And it creates all these kinds of cool effects.

666
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:55,695
And the other thing we do is we can have our designers script shader values, which is...

667
00:37:56,667 --> 00:38:02,448
Also very helpful, ended up leveraging a lot for characters for when they have to be sweaty, muddy, dirty.

668
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:07,329
Then we have our programmers who actually write into a runtime texture that generates masks

669
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,949
that we can also use in shaders.

670
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:13,610
And we do that for characters for our dirtiness or wetness.

671
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,650
That is also procedural.

672
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,631
We have water detectors and mud detectors on joints,

673
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:21,491
and those just fill in pixels that are easily available in all the shaders.

674
00:38:21,511 --> 00:38:25,372
So we can just go, oh, like Drake's dirty at the right knee but not the left knee.

675
00:38:25,892 --> 00:38:26,793
and same for muddiness.

676
00:38:27,073 --> 00:38:29,133
And actually, if you get Drake dirty

677
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:31,674
and then go into water, it will wash away the mud,

678
00:38:32,234 --> 00:38:34,415
but then if you get muddy again, it will actually dry up.

679
00:38:34,675 --> 00:38:37,156
So it's a whole fun, convoluted system,

680
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:38,176
but it's really cool.

681
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,017
And that kind of technological cross-communication

682
00:38:41,037 --> 00:38:42,177
allowed us to do fun things.

683
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:43,838
Like, another example, I guess, would be

684
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:46,338
we took the fatigue system that animation had

685
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:47,979
for when Drake's running and he's tired

686
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:49,639
and he's changing his animation to look tired.

687
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:52,140
We actually used that to drive a blend value

688
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,321
in the shader that made him really, really sweaty.

689
00:38:56,563 --> 00:38:59,305
So cool stuff, really easy to do,

690
00:38:59,526 --> 00:39:02,789
and definitely, definitely very advisable.

691
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:10,315
And actually, the last takeaway that we have for this talk,

692
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:14,199
and this one is a pretty big one,

693
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:16,421
but before we go into that,

694
00:39:16,961 --> 00:39:21,125
I'm actually gonna finally reveal the Naughty Dog secret.

695
00:39:22,551 --> 00:39:26,017
Which is interesting because when I came into work at the studio, right?

696
00:39:26,037 --> 00:39:28,501
You're kind of thinking, okay, so is there a secret sauce?

697
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:29,202
Like how is this made?

698
00:39:29,222 --> 00:39:30,605
Why is this so fun?

699
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:34,352
And at the end of the day, what it ended up being...

700
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:39,841
is that the secret of Naughty Dog is 100% entirely the people.

701
00:39:41,101 --> 00:39:46,542
They are so relentless and tireless in their pursuit of perfection.

702
00:39:46,963 --> 00:39:49,743
They never, ever give up. They never, ever take compromises.

703
00:39:49,783 --> 00:39:52,064
And that is also part of the studio culture.

704
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:55,845
Up to a point where I'd be waking up a texture artist at 3am

705
00:39:55,885 --> 00:39:58,006
when he's asleep face down on his Cintiq,

706
00:39:58,406 --> 00:39:59,726
saying, dude, you want me to get you an Uber?

707
00:39:59,746 --> 00:40:02,267
And he'd just go, no, I'm napping for an hour and I'm going to keep working.

708
00:40:03,686 --> 00:40:05,428
And they do that for a month.

709
00:40:06,509 --> 00:40:08,712
So, and it was a lot of work,

710
00:40:08,752 --> 00:40:10,674
but what I was relieved to see, I guess,

711
00:40:10,754 --> 00:40:12,956
is the fact that there is no secret.

712
00:40:13,016 --> 00:40:14,918
The secret is that I've never seen anyone

713
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:16,660
work so hard or so much in my entire life.

714
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,222
And that's what we all did.

715
00:40:18,522 --> 00:40:21,605
And in that context, when you think about

716
00:40:21,646 --> 00:40:23,708
the responsibility that technical art has,

717
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,390
it becomes very, very...

718
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:32,575
scary because the responsibility there is immense because pipelines are horrible

719
00:40:33,156 --> 00:40:37,019
and you have a group of people that's not gonna quit until everything's

720
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:40,962
perfect you just end up making the miserable for months and months and

721
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:43,284
months that people don't go home and see their families

722
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:45,526
And that is not a way to go.

723
00:40:45,586 --> 00:40:47,787
And I don't think, and if there's one thing

724
00:40:47,847 --> 00:40:49,628
that you guys take away from this is that,

725
00:40:49,728 --> 00:40:51,029
that responsibility I don't think

726
00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:52,610
should ever be taken for granted.

727
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,192
I don't, and maybe Naughty Dog is more of an extreme case,

728
00:40:56,232 --> 00:40:59,093
but every place you work at, you have the power

729
00:40:59,313 --> 00:41:00,774
to either make everyone miserable

730
00:41:01,114 --> 00:41:03,776
or make everyone feel inspired and empowered

731
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,177
and to do great and creative things.

732
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:08,879
And that should always lay pretty heavy on your minds

733
00:41:08,939 --> 00:41:10,860
because it is a very big responsibility.

734
00:41:12,501 --> 00:41:12,601
And.

735
00:41:17,585 --> 00:41:21,179
Yeah, I guess being very acutely aware of that is something that you definitely need.

736
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,441
But something to tie into that

737
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:27,382
and kind of go back to what we talked about is,

738
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:30,664
I know we said that there is no final product per se.

739
00:41:30,684 --> 00:41:33,305
The final product is your relentless desire

740
00:41:33,346 --> 00:41:34,206
to make something better,

741
00:41:34,486 --> 00:41:36,587
but I think in light of that responsibility

742
00:41:36,607 --> 00:41:38,268
of a technical artist that we talked about,

743
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:41,510
the one thing that I can attribute to the goal

744
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,411
and kind of the endgame of technical art

745
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:44,792
is actually the people.

746
00:41:45,372 --> 00:41:48,574
Because technical art does not have to be about tech

747
00:41:48,814 --> 00:41:50,435
or it does not have to be about art.

748
00:41:51,477 --> 00:41:55,363
because the end game there is making sure

749
00:41:55,403 --> 00:41:57,046
that the people can use what you write.

750
00:41:57,446 --> 00:41:58,068
It's not.

751
00:41:59,103 --> 00:42:01,684
right when you're just write a tool and throw it over the fence and go

752
00:42:02,344 --> 00:42:03,344
use it why aren't you using it

753
00:42:03,785 --> 00:42:05,905
and you're upset and angry that people don't use it because

754
00:42:06,226 --> 00:42:08,646
your job is not writing tools your job is making people

755
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:11,908
empowered with the tools you write your job is making them happy

756
00:42:12,348 --> 00:42:15,609
your job is making sure that they can execute on the things that they need to

757
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:17,210
execute better because you did this

758
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:18,410
so

759
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,271
keeping that always in mind i think is

760
00:42:21,611 --> 00:42:23,592
crucial and at times can be helpful then

761
00:42:24,473 --> 00:42:27,618
than kind of writing super fancy, sophisticated tech

762
00:42:27,638 --> 00:42:29,421
that does not take that into account

763
00:42:29,621 --> 00:42:31,925
or being more oriented towards keeping the team

764
00:42:32,306 --> 00:42:33,228
engaged and empowered.

765
00:42:34,384 --> 00:42:37,025
And one of the things that we did that every single tool

766
00:42:37,545 --> 00:42:40,467
that we've written had were these two buttons that you see there.

767
00:42:40,507 --> 00:42:43,248
There's the help button and then there's an A button.

768
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:46,890
So every tool at all times has to have a help button

769
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,772
that will take you to the web page with all the videos, with all the explanations.

770
00:42:50,092 --> 00:42:54,374
It will explain to people how things work and it's a huge chore to maintain.

771
00:42:54,674 --> 00:42:58,696
All of you probably know, but it's something that is extremely important, at least.

772
00:42:59,057 --> 00:43:03,700
as far as I see, because it makes the life of the people on the team better, and that is your end goal.

773
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,683
And not the fact that you've written something that's just going to lay there on the shelf and no one's going to use it.

774
00:43:08,223 --> 00:43:11,486
But the other part of it is that little A button, and that is...

775
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:15,569
you ended up calling it a bad signal. Basically, every time you press that button, I get a message

776
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:19,291
that tells me who pressed it, what my scene they were in, what tool they were using,

777
00:43:19,612 --> 00:43:23,735
and I make it a point to be at their desk within a minute from when they've pressed it.

778
00:43:24,423 --> 00:43:29,026
Just so that everyone on the team knows that there's constantly a channel of interaction

779
00:43:29,046 --> 00:43:33,690
and it's not a one-way street where we just throw things over the fence and expect them to use it.

780
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,592
It's always about them being engaged and empowered

781
00:43:36,612 --> 00:43:39,674
and it's always about being there for them in the first place.

782
00:43:40,995 --> 00:43:43,337
And one of the other things...

783
00:43:44,231 --> 00:43:49,916
that we did that I find really interesting is a couple of months before crunch hit really hard

784
00:43:49,956 --> 00:43:54,799
I implemented this little tool. It's not even a tool, it's a button that you click and it just prints out like a

785
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:00,422
prints out a random quote of an Uncharted 4 player

786
00:44:00,642 --> 00:44:02,923
from online that I basically went around and assembled.

787
00:44:03,823 --> 00:44:06,704
And they're not kind of the ask Hissy type of quotes,

788
00:44:06,764 --> 00:44:09,865
they're actually there to help people remember

789
00:44:09,925 --> 00:44:11,606
what they're doing this for, because when we're

790
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:14,167
in the midst of a super hectic and crazy production,

791
00:44:15,068 --> 00:44:16,529
Everyone's thinking about getting their work done.

792
00:44:16,569 --> 00:44:20,071
Everyone's probably thinking about how we want to do the most polished,

793
00:44:20,111 --> 00:44:22,052
the best game that has ever been made.

794
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,293
But it's not about that.

795
00:44:23,313 --> 00:44:27,696
The creative people that you have, they're not motivated by what they do.

796
00:44:27,716 --> 00:44:29,317
They're motivated by why they do it.

797
00:44:30,518 --> 00:44:32,859
Technical art does not have to be all about technology.

798
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,601
It can be about people, it can remind people

799
00:44:34,641 --> 00:44:35,821
why they do it in the first place.

800
00:44:36,102 --> 00:44:39,504
That you're not just making polygons and animations,

801
00:44:39,524 --> 00:44:40,945
you're making memories for people.

802
00:44:41,305 --> 00:44:43,266
You're allowing people to experience things together

803
00:44:43,286 --> 00:44:44,707
that maybe they'll remember and cherish

804
00:44:44,747 --> 00:44:46,028
for the rest of their lives.

805
00:44:49,798 --> 00:44:51,718
Yeah, and if there's another thing I'd hope

806
00:44:51,758 --> 00:44:52,999
that you guys could take away from this

807
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:56,199
is that there's a sort of a field that we can experiment

808
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:59,780
with more as far as trying to transcend the disciplines

809
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,661
and have technical art not only be a solution

810
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:04,761
for technical problems, but also to help

811
00:45:05,182 --> 00:45:07,942
and empower people even as far as motivation goes.

812
00:45:09,403 --> 00:45:11,823
And I guess this is it for me.

813
00:45:12,423 --> 00:45:12,943
Thank you so much.

814
00:45:24,587 --> 00:45:26,951
One fun fact, I don't know if you guys want to hear it,

815
00:45:27,211 --> 00:45:27,692
there's a bonus.

816
00:45:27,712 --> 00:45:28,213
Do we have time?

817
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:29,014
I think we have time.

818
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,841
So that quote system that we had,

819
00:45:33,382 --> 00:45:35,723
one of our lead designers ended up implementing that

820
00:45:35,823 --> 00:45:37,463
into our script editing tool.

821
00:45:37,964 --> 00:45:39,484
And so it would just randomly print out

822
00:45:39,744 --> 00:45:40,865
one of these messages sometimes,

823
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:42,926
like occasionally when you compile a script.

824
00:45:43,346 --> 00:45:46,007
And so eventually we had an email thread going

825
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:50,569
where our designer was telling that Sublime,

826
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:52,550
our script tool, was telling her what to do

827
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:54,091
because one of the quotes was,

828
00:45:54,391 --> 00:45:55,991
you guys should really do a dinosaur game.

829
00:45:56,532 --> 00:45:59,013
And she's just compiling a script and Sublime just goes,

830
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:00,394
you should really do a dinosaur game.

831
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:04,056
And so it was fun, it was unexpected.

832
00:46:04,116 --> 00:46:05,457
You end up entertaining people,

833
00:46:05,937 --> 00:46:07,618
having all these emergent situations,

834
00:46:07,818 --> 00:46:11,180
and apparently Alex is pretty down to do a dinosaur game,

835
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,541
so new IP from Naughty Dog confirmed, maybe.

836
00:46:16,052 --> 00:46:19,154
But yeah, so I guess that's pretty much it.

837
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:20,816
If you guys have any questions about any tech

838
00:46:20,836 --> 00:46:24,698
that you've seen, feel free to line up at the microphones.

839
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,280
And I'm assuming we're also going

840
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,420
to do the wrap-up room after.

841
00:46:27,441 --> 00:46:28,882
Thanks for listening.

842
00:46:28,902 --> 00:46:29,022
Thanks.

843
00:46:29,102 --> 00:46:29,262
Thanks.

844
00:46:29,282 --> 00:46:29,462
Thanks.

845
00:46:29,482 --> 00:46:29,662
Thanks.

846
00:46:39,309 --> 00:46:39,430
Thanks.

847
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:39,570
Thanks.

848
00:46:41,011 --> 00:46:42,192
All right.

849
00:46:42,452 --> 00:46:42,732
There you go.

850
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:52,308
I got a question about your relationship with the developers, because you're a technical artist,

851
00:46:53,028 --> 00:46:57,233
and sometimes technical artists have to make some proof of concepts,

852
00:46:57,753 --> 00:47:02,298
and the developers have to make it real in the game or in the runtime.

853
00:47:02,838 --> 00:47:07,844
and sometimes your work is directly used for the final product.

854
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:21,139
What's the part or the proportion between the number of times you need a developer or not in the final result in the game?

855
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,181
Is it clear? Sorry.

856
00:47:23,462 --> 00:47:25,943
So what you're asking is how much,

857
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,064
like what's the proportion of the time

858
00:47:28,104 --> 00:47:30,024
that a technical artist at Naughty Dog

859
00:47:30,104 --> 00:47:33,126
would have their work directly in the game

860
00:47:33,146 --> 00:47:34,266
versus writing the tools?

861
00:47:34,546 --> 00:47:34,886
Exactly.

862
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:37,067
So what's very interesting about Naughty Dog,

863
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,428
we don't have a dedicated technical art department.

864
00:47:39,488 --> 00:47:40,989
It just doesn't exist.

865
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,471
We have what's called technical art department,

866
00:47:44,511 --> 00:47:46,352
but within the studio we call it foreground department

867
00:47:46,392 --> 00:47:49,093
because they handle explosions,

868
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:53,016
like destructible physics, collapsing things,

869
00:47:53,276 --> 00:47:54,216
because we have a lot of that.

870
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:57,138
So basically what it boils down to is

871
00:47:57,278 --> 00:47:59,799
every team has some team members

872
00:48:00,259 --> 00:48:01,560
that are more technical than others,

873
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:02,761
and they end up taking up.

874
00:48:03,201 --> 00:48:06,703
that works, so you kind of cannot be in a situation

875
00:48:06,743 --> 00:48:09,184
at Naughty Dog where you're only doing tools

876
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:12,565
or only doing things that are like the production.

877
00:48:12,585 --> 00:48:14,826
You always have to be contributing to the final project

878
00:48:14,846 --> 00:48:17,588
and I think that's kind of a point that we make

879
00:48:17,648 --> 00:48:19,348
in the company where we don't just have people

880
00:48:19,428 --> 00:48:21,930
who don't have their labor directly in the game

881
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:22,970
most of the time.

882
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,772
Now that being said, depending on the time we are in production,

883
00:48:26,792 --> 00:48:28,152
like when we're gearing up for crunch,

884
00:48:28,252 --> 00:48:30,833
I'd probably spend more time writing tools just

885
00:48:30,873 --> 00:48:32,414
to make sure that artists hopefully

886
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:33,154
have to crunch less.

887
00:48:33,514 --> 00:48:35,895
So it also varies based on time.

888
00:48:36,376 --> 00:48:37,956
But apart from that, you still have to do art.

889
00:48:40,557 --> 00:48:41,898
Hope that answers your question.

890
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:42,758
Thanks for that.

891
00:48:42,998 --> 00:48:43,178
Yeah.

892
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:43,679
OK.

893
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:44,059
Thanks.

894
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:44,479
Thank you.

895
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,241
First, awesome talk.

896
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:48,342
It's really good stuff.

897
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:49,082
Oh, thank you.

898
00:48:49,223 --> 00:48:52,265
Also, you guys should definitely do a dinosaur game

899
00:48:52,285 --> 00:48:53,686
if you can.

900
00:48:54,066 --> 00:48:57,689
But from the E3 demo, one of the things that really stuck

901
00:48:57,729 --> 00:49:00,331
with me was how awesome the destruction you guys have.

902
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:03,274
Like, the bullets will tear apart wooden cover.

903
00:49:03,614 --> 00:49:07,657
And the best one is that if the sand bag gets shot, the

904
00:49:07,697 --> 00:49:09,198
sand will start flowing out of it.

905
00:49:09,558 --> 00:49:10,379
It really stuck with me.

906
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:13,081
Could you speak some more about some of the tools you

907
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:14,142
used to get the destruction?

908
00:49:15,502 --> 00:49:18,083
Sure, sure. So that is mostly in our program department.

909
00:49:18,103 --> 00:49:21,644
They use Havoc a lot, obviously, for all of our physical destruction.

910
00:49:21,664 --> 00:49:26,105
They pre-set up the chunks that will disappear as you shoot them and physicalize and fly away.

911
00:49:26,685 --> 00:49:28,206
So that's how we do that part.

912
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:30,827
And then we basically have environment artists actually populate those,

913
00:49:31,147 --> 00:49:35,548
like specifically based on where you're going to be shot from and all of that to help performance.

914
00:49:36,188 --> 00:49:41,870
But as far as the grain bag goes, that was...

915
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:44,711
I'm pretty sure it was on joints,

916
00:49:44,872 --> 00:49:47,173
and we played an animation when it got hit,

917
00:49:47,253 --> 00:49:49,395
but then as far as the pouring of the green out,

918
00:49:49,675 --> 00:49:50,936
we had to do a bunch of other things.

919
00:49:50,976 --> 00:49:53,578
So there was a particle effect that got spawned on one side,

920
00:49:53,618 --> 00:49:55,500
but then we didn't have tech to actually spawn it

921
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,121
on the other side, like the bullet hole,

922
00:49:57,141 --> 00:49:59,323
so we had to hack around it where we would just do

923
00:49:59,423 --> 00:50:01,204
like a gigantic decal that would go through,

924
00:50:01,925 --> 00:50:03,266
as far as I remember, so we would actually

925
00:50:03,306 --> 00:50:05,387
project on both sides, and then...

926
00:50:07,246 --> 00:50:12,209
where actually we did a second decal that was rotated 180 but was big enough to cover the radius of the grain back.

927
00:50:12,289 --> 00:50:17,032
But then we would just spawn a particle effect on that other side that would do kind of the sipping grain

928
00:50:17,052 --> 00:50:22,095
and then we'd have a different mesh that would actually get spawned at the probe collision with the ground

929
00:50:22,595 --> 00:50:27,658
from that point and then it would start growing based on the animation of that effect.

930
00:50:27,718 --> 00:50:28,639
And then on top of that...

931
00:50:29,019 --> 00:50:32,501
We had to add a feature in the physical shader

932
00:50:32,561 --> 00:50:34,362
that we had separate shaders for particles

933
00:50:34,663 --> 00:50:37,645
and just regular background geometry.

934
00:50:37,665 --> 00:50:39,085
So we had to add a feature for that

935
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:41,047
that would allow particles to drive

936
00:50:41,107 --> 00:50:42,748
the animation of that pile of grain

937
00:50:43,128 --> 00:50:46,310
so that it actually flows down as the pile gets bigger.

938
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,711
And then once the particle stops,

939
00:50:47,731 --> 00:50:48,691
the animation will stop.

940
00:50:49,692 --> 00:50:51,833
And that was a lot of work for one tiny effect.

941
00:50:53,143 --> 00:50:55,584
And that is kind of how we do things at Nighthawk.

942
00:50:55,604 --> 00:50:57,726
And that was very interesting, because one thing that I had

943
00:50:57,746 --> 00:51:01,908
to very quickly unlearn working there is compromising.

944
00:51:01,948 --> 00:51:03,649
Like any other place I worked at, you go,

945
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:04,730
well we have that much time,

946
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,131
so we can probably do that many things.

947
00:51:06,871 --> 00:51:07,872
Doesn't work at Nighthawk.

948
00:51:07,912 --> 00:51:09,733
You have, no matter how much time you have,

949
00:51:09,753 --> 00:51:11,114
if it's awesome, we gotta do it.

950
00:51:11,354 --> 00:51:13,595
And we'll make sure that it happens.

951
00:51:14,956 --> 00:51:17,978
And yeah, I guess there are plenty of effects

952
00:51:17,998 --> 00:51:19,258
like this in the game that hopefully you guys

953
00:51:19,278 --> 00:51:19,879
will appreciate.

954
00:51:19,899 --> 00:51:22,360
Anytime.

955
00:51:23,076 --> 00:51:23,618
Any more questions?

956
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,768
Oh, there you go.

957
00:51:29,372 --> 00:51:31,752
I was wondering what UVs you used to look up

958
00:51:31,832 --> 00:51:35,714
into the dynamic mass that's generated via particles.

959
00:51:36,954 --> 00:51:39,935
So how are the UVs laid out?

960
00:51:40,396 --> 00:51:43,717
Oh, so we had actually two implementations of that.

961
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:45,838
And one of them was a top-down projection.

962
00:51:46,358 --> 00:51:48,559
Literally, we just used the world space position

963
00:51:48,859 --> 00:51:52,300
of the vert or a pixel to look up the texture.

964
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,421
We just had to sort of get it into the range of the camera

965
00:51:55,581 --> 00:51:55,961
for us to.

966
00:51:56,401 --> 00:51:58,102
And then the other one was actually screen space.

967
00:51:59,264 --> 00:52:00,866
So we have just a screen space buffer,

968
00:52:00,947 --> 00:52:03,832
and I used the depth buffer to project some of the,

969
00:52:04,173 --> 00:52:06,116
it's basically like a separate buffer

970
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:08,701
with decals projected into it that we use for blending.

971
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:11,890
It ended up still being fairly expensive

972
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:15,510
because of all the overdraw, like we put it on gunshots.

973
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:18,811
So they would crumble the material around them.

974
00:52:19,571 --> 00:52:20,992
And the more you shoot, obviously,

975
00:52:21,052 --> 00:52:24,032
the more decal cubes we end up creating.

976
00:52:24,092 --> 00:52:26,433
So we had to do all kinds of sophisticated things

977
00:52:26,453 --> 00:52:28,933
to make sure that we actually look up into that buffer,

978
00:52:28,993 --> 00:52:31,994
make sure that the pixel that's in there is not maxed out,

979
00:52:32,034 --> 00:52:33,014
like it's not full brightness.

980
00:52:33,294 --> 00:52:36,895
And if it's not, only then we spawn an additional decal.

981
00:52:37,376 --> 00:52:40,118
But basically, these were either screen space or top down.

982
00:52:43,962 --> 00:52:44,563
Yay, done.

983
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:45,724
Thank you so much, guys.
