00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:10,540
Hi, my name is Patrick Walker, and I'm with the market research company, EDAR.

2
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:17,507
So EDAR collects a lot of video game data to help clients make better business decisions.

3
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:23,737
This is a really fun and exciting time for us in VR because we finally have VR data.

4
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:30,999
It was very hard when there wasn't consumer systems on the market to ask people what they thought about VR.

5
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,519
We've tried VR and we know that you don't really understand it until you've tried it.

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:44,881
And now we have about six months of great data, not only sales but also just consumer engagement, consumer attitudes towards the platform.

7
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:47,141
And that's what I'm going to be showing today.

8
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:53,140
That's also why the focus of my talk is going to be on VR rather than AR.

9
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:55,302
AR is very exciting.

10
00:00:55,742 --> 00:00:57,864
I think a lot of people, including Tim Cook,

11
00:00:58,385 --> 00:01:01,027
think that AR is eventually going to be bigger than VR.

12
00:01:01,808 --> 00:01:04,831
But right now, we have more data on VR.

13
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:08,634
And that both makes for a more interesting presentation

14
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:12,357
and makes it a little bit easier to figure out where VR is going.

15
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:15,127
I'm going to be showing several data sets today.

16
00:01:15,788 --> 00:01:18,730
Data from our Steam Pulse data set,

17
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:22,413
which shows Steam ownership, Steam engagement,

18
00:01:22,653 --> 00:01:25,336
which is really great for understanding the Vive,

19
00:01:25,716 --> 00:01:27,758
and then also data from our consumer tracker

20
00:01:28,178 --> 00:01:29,379
and several consumer surveys.

21
00:01:30,997 --> 00:01:38,106
And then also, with AR, one point, I don't really consider Pokemon Go AR.

22
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:45,234
We do have data on AR, and it mostly tells me that people turn off the AR functionality

23
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:46,476
so that they can save their battery.

24
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:48,939
So this is VR focused mostly.

25
00:01:49,678 --> 00:01:52,400
You may have noticed VR is pretty big right now.

26
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:53,281
It's pretty hot.

27
00:01:53,702 --> 00:01:56,825
This is a picture of the moment that I realized, OK,

28
00:01:56,865 --> 00:01:59,027
I'm going to be speaking about VR from now on.

29
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:00,288
This was GDC 2016.

30
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:04,211
And I was giving a presentation just on the overall market,

31
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:08,035
walked into this hallway of people doing VR presentations,

32
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:10,617
and was like, hmm, I am talking about the wrong thing

33
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:10,978
right now.

34
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:14,832
Why are people so excited about VR?

35
00:02:14,872 --> 00:02:17,413
Well, one reason is the amount of investment dollars

36
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:18,193
that are flooding in.

37
00:02:18,854 --> 00:02:21,535
So year over year, we're seeing significant growth

38
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:22,955
in investment on VR.

39
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:25,276
This chart doesn't even include Magic Leap.

40
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:28,197
And Magic Leap has over a billion dollars

41
00:02:28,657 --> 00:02:29,678
of funding on its own.

42
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:32,359
So we've hit over a billion dollars in 2016

43
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,360
of investment into VR AR.

44
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:36,840
Now.

45
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:44,491
There is also the fact that 2016 became when VR hype had to become VR reality.

46
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:50,617
And my favorite anecdote to explain this shift in thinking, or to think about this shift in thinking,

47
00:02:51,078 --> 00:02:53,000
is the quotes from Facebook.

48
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,986
So in the tail end of 2014, Zuckerberg was talking about the Rift and their $2 billion investment.

49
00:02:59,507 --> 00:03:02,387
And he said, oh, well, for that to be a successful platform

50
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:03,247
or a platform that matters, we're

51
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,428
going to have to move 50 to 100 million units, right?

52
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:09,549
Probably thinking about something like the PS4 install

53
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,789
base or Xbox One install base.

54
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:14,950
And then last year or this year, the CEO

55
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,851
is saying, well, if we can move 1 million units life to date,

56
00:03:18,171 --> 00:03:19,451
then we'll be satisfied.

57
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,171
That'll be great.

58
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:21,091
That'll be fantastic.

59
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:24,152
A little bit of a coming down to Earth

60
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:26,613
in terms of the expectations for the platform, right?

61
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:30,035
So where are we now? What's the VR roadmap?

62
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:32,036
So this is the VR roadmap in November 2016.

63
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:37,440
What we're seeing is really there's two types of platforms being released.

64
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:41,584
There's the accessible platforms, the mobile platforms, able to move more units.

65
00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:43,945
And then there's the more immersive platforms.

66
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:46,707
On the more immersive side, we've got the Oculus and Vive.

67
00:03:47,308 --> 00:03:49,770
Accessible side, we've got Cardboard, Gear VR.

68
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,933
And now we've got the PlayStation VR coming in,

69
00:03:52,953 --> 00:03:55,095
and that's pretty exciting because the install base

70
00:03:55,555 --> 00:03:58,938
of the PlayStation 4, 47 million units end of year,

71
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,360
means we first have the first platform

72
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:05,044
that really has the potential to hit a little bit

73
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:07,126
of that sweet spot, right, where it's both accessible,

74
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,687
a lot of people in the ecosystem,

75
00:04:09,028 --> 00:04:10,589
but also offering that deep immersion.

76
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,391
I also have some exciting platforms on the horizon.

77
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:16,072
We've got the Daydream coming out,

78
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:18,834
which will have a hand controller and Google really

79
00:04:18,894 --> 00:04:20,575
investing into the ecosystem.

80
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,216
And then Microsoft has recently announced

81
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:26,998
that they're going to try to make some third party, lower

82
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:29,099
end, $200 systems over the next couple of years.

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,122
So what does this look like? Well in terms of headset price, you can see that relationship, or as they're more immersive, it increases.

84
00:04:36,863 --> 00:04:40,544
Oculus is now $800 instead of $600, but it started out at $600.

85
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:46,307
Now when we look at our install base, so what's the worldwide install base estimated by the end of the year?

86
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:49,508
There's this inverse relationship, as you might expect.

87
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:52,950
For an $800 system, you're not going to have...

88
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,251
50 to 100 million units, you're probably going to have closer to a couple hundred thousand,

89
00:04:58,711 --> 00:04:59,791
which is where we're at now.

90
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:06,892
You do see that in the middle, the nice position that the PSVR is in where they have both a

91
00:05:06,952 --> 00:05:13,493
pretty high price point, but also the opportunity to move a million or two units, which is really

92
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:17,754
where when we look at the overall revenue number, a billion and a half this year, a

93
00:05:17,874 --> 00:05:20,075
lot of that is being generated by the PSVR.

94
00:05:20,335 --> 00:05:24,638
Because it's the first platform that really has that sweet spot met.

95
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:26,979
And it makes sense.

96
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:28,420
These are expensive systems.

97
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,503
And when we look at people and we ask them, what's the amount that you're willing to spend

98
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:39,268
on a VR headset, it's pretty low percentage when you get to the $700, $800 price point

99
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:41,830
where the Vive and the Oculus exist.

100
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,631
PSVR is a little bit better.

101
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:48,514
I put it at $450 because it's somewhere between $400 and $500 depending on whether you have

102
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:48,994
the camera.

103
00:05:49,635 --> 00:05:53,878
and hand controls. And then when the full market starts to be interested or say

104
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:55,520
that they would be willing to buy that headset,

105
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,503
you're at a lower price point around where the Daydream and the Gear VR are.

106
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:02,786
It's just at that point, you know, we start to lose some of the

107
00:06:03,006 --> 00:06:06,169
aversion and it's a less high-quality VR experience.

108
00:06:07,697 --> 00:06:14,360
We also have an install-based situation where there's only 5 million GPUs that can really

109
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,183
even handle the high-end PC headsets.

110
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:25,807
So even if you attach 10%, you're still in that 250,000 to 500,000 unit range, which

111
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:27,488
is where we're going to be at around the end of the year.

112
00:06:28,549 --> 00:06:32,711
Forty-five million PS4s is a much better install base to hit.

113
00:06:34,755 --> 00:06:38,176
All right, so who are these early VR adopters?

114
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:39,256
What do they look like?

115
00:06:39,336 --> 00:06:41,617
Well, for one thing, they spend a lot of money.

116
00:06:42,297 --> 00:06:44,898
This is their spend on non-VR gaming.

117
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:49,380
We see that for a PC VR owner, it's

118
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,001
significantly higher than just a PC console gamer

119
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:56,402
and higher than someone who is interested in purchasing a VR

120
00:06:56,442 --> 00:06:58,243
headset but has not purchased one yet.

121
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:01,625
Interestingly, they don't necessarily play more

122
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:02,646
than those who are interested.

123
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:04,948
The people who play the most are the ones

124
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:08,310
who can't afford a PC VR headset yet,

125
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,631
but they're excited about it,

126
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:10,872
and they're interested in purchasing.

127
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:12,854
That also is a much larger group,

128
00:07:13,254 --> 00:07:15,516
something like 10x, 15x the size.

129
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:17,938
So there is a lot of excitement about VR,

130
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:19,579
it's just that the price points

131
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,260
make it a little bit difficult at this point.

132
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,411
They're also consumers with money.

133
00:07:25,052 --> 00:07:29,058
So I'm going to say, make about $70,000 a year.

134
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,063
Most have gone to college.

135
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:36,788
72% male, which is higher than the typical 60-40 split

136
00:07:36,808 --> 00:07:37,970
we see for console gaming.

137
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:42,874
As a general rule of thumb, mobile is close to 50-50, male-female split.

138
00:07:43,594 --> 00:07:44,595
Console is usually 60-40.

139
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,637
This is about 70-30.

140
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:50,740
It's a very core gaming group in 20s.

141
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:54,423
And they're spending a lot on VR right now, which is cool.

142
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,566
You know, it's about, you know, of that 1.5 billion,

143
00:07:58,586 --> 00:08:01,268
about 250 million is likely to be software.

144
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:07,433
For the number of people that are in the ecosystem, that's actually pretty good

145
00:08:07,893 --> 00:08:09,474
because people are spending a lot of money.

146
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:12,856
They're also so far satisfied with the systems.

147
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:17,219
When we ask, you know, are you satisfied with the virtual reality headset that you purchased,

148
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,542
over 75% on both platforms say that they are.

149
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:24,804
So have critics.

150
00:08:25,124 --> 00:08:27,086
Critics have been pretty high on these systems.

151
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:31,529
And when we look across five to six, seven top tech sites

152
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:33,891
and look at their reviews on the platforms,

153
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,473
on the VR headsets, we see an average review score

154
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:38,474
for the most part above 80, right?

155
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:41,337
Which is kind of that standard for a good game,

156
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:44,939
which a lot of even like compensation plans

157
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:47,681
are tied to in development studios.

158
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:56,237
And each headset has had pretty much its USP or the thing that was called out about it the most.

159
00:08:56,637 --> 00:09:05,568
So for the Rift, the headset quality, the quality of the games, the length of games, the depth of the games was called out.

160
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:13,476
Vive had the plus of coming to the market with hand controls and the full room immersion,

161
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,598
which got called out in reviews a lot.

162
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:19,542
Oculus has now caught up with that and now has touch controls.

163
00:09:20,223 --> 00:09:23,106
And then for PSVR, it was all about the price point, right?

164
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,608
This is a good enough experience.

165
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:28,011
This is a great VR experience and you don't have to pay as much for it.

166
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:34,682
And there's a lot of VR content that's already out there,

167
00:09:34,903 --> 00:09:37,769
despite maybe that there's not a huge install base yet

168
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:38,471
for these systems.

169
00:09:39,568 --> 00:09:44,390
So this is the Oculus Rift game releases by release date

170
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:45,111
and price point.

171
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:49,833
You can see the launch there with software released

172
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:51,513
at each $10 increment.

173
00:09:52,154 --> 00:09:56,776
If you've released a software for one of these systems,

174
00:09:56,816 --> 00:09:58,336
you're a dot on this chart.

175
00:09:58,956 --> 00:10:00,917
There is the recent PSVR release.

176
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:04,399
Same strategy where at different $10 price points,

177
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:06,139
we have content released.

178
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,285
Now the openness of the Vive and the Valve platform has meant that there's a lot of content on that platform.

179
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:20,713
Generally at a lower price point, but it's already a fairly saturated ecosystem only six months in.

180
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:28,059
Which does mean that in order to stand out, you really need to develop high quality content.

181
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:33,874
These launches, when you look at them compared to traditional platform launches, have actually

182
00:10:33,914 --> 00:10:41,236
had a lot more content than both the 8th gen consoles, but also then I think what was previously

183
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:45,557
the last really big accessory, the Move and the Kinect.

184
00:10:46,257 --> 00:10:51,338
So these have had way more software released across the Oculus, PSVR, and Vive.

185
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:58,172
Now, when we look at must have, you know, the game that critics agree upon, saying that

186
00:10:58,212 --> 00:11:01,213
everyone needs to have, that hasn't really happened yet, right?

187
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:05,474
If we say, all right, the must have game on console has an average review score over 85.

188
00:11:06,695 --> 00:11:11,076
The only one we've seen is one PSVR title that's come out that did that.

189
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,103
So on these PC VR systems, with the install base

190
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,464
of a couple hundred thousand units,

191
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:21,746
there is a path to success of making a little bit

192
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:23,047
over a million dollars.

193
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:25,289
That was something like raw data,

194
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:29,212
where we're moving 30,000 units, $40 a piece,

195
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,774
making a million and a half million dollars.

196
00:11:33,274 --> 00:11:35,996
I'd say that with the PSVR, where the install base would

197
00:11:36,016 --> 00:11:38,278
be higher up, could make $3 to $7 million.

198
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:38,478
But.

199
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,123
The price points that have made this happen are around $40 and then around $20.

200
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:53,786
So the titles that are doing lower price points at $5, $10 are having trouble making as much

201
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:59,849
money if you think about it, when there's only 100,000 users out there, 200,000 users

202
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:06,733
out there, it really is difficult to move software based on price rather than quality.

203
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:11,879
At this point, the way to move software is really to keep the quality high, get a high

204
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:15,163
user score, and keep your price point up around $20 to $40.

205
00:12:15,664 --> 00:12:18,548
Also I'll point out that this is average price.

206
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:22,293
So this is based on the average of daily Steam pricing.

207
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:29,558
So we're not seeing a whole lot of summer steam scale style,

208
00:12:29,638 --> 00:12:35,041
just drastic price cutting down to $5, $10 to move units.

209
00:12:36,202 --> 00:12:40,205
The software that is developing and making more money

210
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:41,806
is keeping the price point high over time.

211
00:12:44,007 --> 00:12:45,528
Those are some of the top titles there.

212
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:47,129
I'll show them on the next slide.

213
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:48,610
That has more call outs, if you want

214
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,351
to take a picture of that one.

215
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:55,492
So one thing that does really matter, and I think it's interesting because I hate to

216
00:12:55,552 --> 00:13:00,735
piggyback on bashing professional critics when Bethesda is doing a lot of that lately

217
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,076
with not giving them early copies, user score really matters.

218
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:10,920
So when you look at the correlation between Steam user score and revenue on the HTC Vive,

219
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,301
there's a really strong correlation.

220
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,323
I should point out that this is max revenue.

221
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:20,566
So this is taking the number of owners, which we have really good data on, and steam average

222
00:13:20,586 --> 00:13:25,309
pricing and multiplying them times each other because of things like giveaways and discounts

223
00:13:25,349 --> 00:13:28,111
and returns that's typically about 15 to 20 percent higher.

224
00:13:28,471 --> 00:13:32,194
But it's a good number for just looking at these overall correlations.

225
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:35,131
Here's some of the titles that have done the best.

226
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:38,235
Your top 15 performers on SteamVR.

227
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:41,400
So Virtual Desktop, Hubbard-Jenner's Call of Starsi,

228
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,643
You to Drift, Raw Data.

229
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,210
What do we got there?

230
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,032
Audio Shield, Space Pirate Trainer,

231
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:48,533
Vanishing Realms, Silent Approach.

232
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:49,874
A lot of these titles are also the ones

233
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:50,955
that have been getting awards.

234
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:53,477
And what we see in these titles is a lot of immersion,

235
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:55,218
right, deep immersion.

236
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:58,781
In general, the titles that are getting the awards,

237
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:01,383
that are moving the needle, that people are talking about,

238
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:06,087
are more about the immersion

239
00:14:06,307 --> 00:14:08,309
and making someone feel like they're being transported

240
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:11,091
than they are about traditional game quality.

241
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:13,956
Things like content length, progression systems,

242
00:14:14,477 --> 00:14:17,463
what we traditionally see moving user scores and review scores.

243
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:23,431
When we ask people, why do you purchase VR content?

244
00:14:24,151 --> 00:14:25,892
These user scores really seem to matter, right?

245
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,673
It's the top endorsed reason that people

246
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,415
say that they purchase these games.

247
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:33,676
Interestingly, price is lower down the list.

248
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:35,757
And I'll tell you what, we ask this question

249
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,338
across a lot of different platforms.

250
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:41,000
This is the only platform that price is lower down the list.

251
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:48,406
If we ask this on mobile, price is not only at the top of the list, it's almost a quarter

252
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:52,069
in percentage past the next one down, which is genre.

253
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:54,412
So when we ask this on mobile, it's price and genre.

254
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:58,096
Is it a game that I know, I know the content type, and what's the price?

255
00:14:58,436 --> 00:14:59,557
And then it goes to word of mouth.

256
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:05,986
So here, on VR, word of mouth isn't as much because most people don't own these systems yet.

257
00:15:06,848 --> 00:15:09,051
Professional reviews are not up there.

258
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:13,518
People are going to user reviews and they're looking in these communities to see what people are saying about the game.

259
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:18,663
Now, one thing that doesn't seem to matter to drive user score, which I think is important

260
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:22,644
when you're thinking about developing this type of content, is the relationship between

261
00:15:22,664 --> 00:15:23,965
user score and play time.

262
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:32,027
We don't see that there's a strong correlation between what your user score is and the total

263
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:34,448
time that people are putting into this content, right?

264
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,328
The average number of minutes.

265
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:39,600
The outlier here, which I think is very interesting,

266
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,880
is virtual desktop, right?

267
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,741
Because that is a type of experience on VR

268
00:15:43,781 --> 00:15:46,682
that works well for putting in a lot of hours.

269
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:49,082
We have the best data for SteamVR.

270
00:15:50,163 --> 00:15:53,164
I do know anecdotally that if this was showing GearVR

271
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:55,464
and showing mobile apps, it's Netflix, right?

272
00:15:55,524 --> 00:15:59,265
That's popping out and showing a ton of average time played.

273
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:01,386
It's in the functional use for VR.

274
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:06,638
But what is heavily correlated is retention,

275
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,221
how often you're coming back to an app.

276
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,885
So this is that same graph showing the max revenue

277
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:16,469
or showing the user score versus how often people have come

278
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,691
back, what percentage have come back in the past two weeks.

279
00:16:20,158 --> 00:16:21,799
A lot of VR is about sharing it.

280
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,662
A lot of VR, I mean, we all remember the first time

281
00:16:24,862 --> 00:16:27,505
we took VR and got into it.

282
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:29,827
We all also know that it's very rare

283
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,368
to put somebody in it for the first time

284
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:34,071
and their jaw not to drop, right?

285
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:35,552
One of the most fun things about VR

286
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:37,714
and what drives a lot of the system purchase

287
00:16:37,874 --> 00:16:39,356
is showing it off to other people

288
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,098
and getting that magical aha moment.

289
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:47,162
And these experiences that are getting the highest user score,

290
00:16:47,622 --> 00:16:52,345
people do feel a need to show them off every couple of weeks or several times a day.

291
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:57,545
This retention metric is actually comparable to AAA at this point.

292
00:16:57,865 --> 00:17:00,547
So this is showing five games or six games.

293
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:03,988
They are games that came out in April of May of 2016

294
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:06,209
around the launch of the Oculus and the Vive.

295
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:12,733
These titles are a couple big AAAs and then popular games on Steam VR.

296
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:17,197
Several of these titles are bundled in, so they're the most owned games on the platform.

297
00:17:17,658 --> 00:17:23,664
I think The Lab, which is Valve's demo, by far the most owned HTC Vive game on the market.

298
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:30,191
So we see that really the only VR experience that even comes close in terms of total playtime

299
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:36,137
to the AAA titles is a functional application, right, is virtual desktop.

300
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,286
But when we look and we say, all right, what about retention?

301
00:17:39,886 --> 00:17:41,247
It's actually very consistent.

302
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:43,989
All these VR titles have been returned

303
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:46,891
to in the past two weeks about as often

304
00:17:47,712 --> 00:17:48,973
as these big AAA titles.

305
00:17:49,813 --> 00:17:53,936
So people are feeling a need to come back and check out

306
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:54,556
this content.

307
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:01,501
When we look at this overall usage patterns,

308
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:07,729
I think we can start to see what are the experiences that are going to be driving the growth on

309
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:08,289
the platform.

310
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:14,434
These are some stock images that I pulled from a great article on the LA Times.

311
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:22,780
So basically it was a pretty funny article that had some great stock images.

312
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,463
If you're looking for stock images that are ridiculous, that's a great link to find them.

313
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:31,489
So, but basically that there are two ways that VR content is being used.

314
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:33,330
One is the functional accessible way.

315
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,492
This is to connect with people.

316
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:41,917
Things like virtual desktop, Netflix, Altspace is a really great social application.

317
00:18:42,718 --> 00:18:45,100
And then there's things that completely transport and immerse people.

318
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,623
So, we're talking about the lab, which is a set of immersive experiences, raw data,

319
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:51,905
which as a game is only four levels.

320
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:54,747
The progression systems aren't even that deep.

321
00:18:55,388 --> 00:18:56,989
But it does a really great job of making

322
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:57,889
you feel like you're there.

323
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,231
And because of that, it's able to get a really high user

324
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:02,952
score and move a lot of units at $40 price point.

325
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:06,775
And then Tilt Brush, just a wonderfully immersive

326
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:10,257
experience of painting in virtual reality.

327
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:13,299
So what does this look like if we

328
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:15,860
want to go and say, what's going to happen over the next two

329
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,361
to three years?

330
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:19,783
What is going to be the roadmaps, the paths,

331
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:21,604
for these different use cases in VR?

332
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:24,730
Well, I think we're at VR 1.0.

333
00:19:25,952 --> 00:19:28,315
And this is the Samsung Gear VR platform.

334
00:19:28,595 --> 00:19:30,897
This has been the early adopters on Steam VR,

335
00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:32,679
really pushing immersion.

336
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,564
There's going to be a bridge over the next year or so

337
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:39,067
where we're going to get a lot more people involved in VR

338
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:41,369
because of PlayStation VR and the amount of units

339
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,390
that it's going to put on the market.

340
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:47,714
The Daydream, right now, it's going to be a little bit limited initially because of

341
00:19:47,774 --> 00:19:52,136
Google support for which phones it's on, but as that pushes out to more Android phones,

342
00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:57,239
that's also going to start to bring more immersion on mobile VR and more use cases because I

343
00:19:57,259 --> 00:19:58,780
think it will be more broadly developed for.

344
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:01,304
We're also going to get the touch controls.

345
00:20:02,445 --> 00:20:06,550
And the thing that's exciting about that is Oculus has pumped $500 million

346
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:11,355
into custom content and proprietary content that's really going to move

347
00:20:11,396 --> 00:20:17,222
the needle in terms of what we would think of as AAA console development.

348
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:22,452
for VR. Then we're going into 3.0, which is I think where we really start to see some

349
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:27,874
growth, right? What this is, is Apple and Facebook, whenever Apple decides that it's

350
00:20:27,914 --> 00:20:32,015
time to enter the space, which will be when they don't need to worry about their stock

351
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:38,777
price taking a dive because VR is here and they can be assured that their hardware is

352
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:44,179
going to be great and sell a lot of units. But then also on PC VR, there's a lot of great

353
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,522
improvements that are coming over the next couple years that will increase

354
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:50,903
this immersion that I'm talking about.

355
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:54,765
The idea of going untethered is big. That's huge. The idea

356
00:20:55,326 --> 00:20:58,588
of eye tracking is big. That lets you do

357
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:04,332
more rapid acceleration without making people sick.

358
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:09,695
And then Microsoft entering the space with AR and mixed reality applications

359
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:11,376
and more accessible VR

360
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:12,697
I think is big as well.

361
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:18,928
Alright, so what does this look like in terms of revenue growth?

362
00:21:20,226 --> 00:21:24,889
Well, one thing that we all agree upon, including John Riccatello at Unity, is that it's likely

363
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,270
to be exponential, right?

364
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:32,054
And the thing about an exponential curve is that you don't really feel the growth until

365
00:21:32,074 --> 00:21:33,475
the growth really happened, right?

366
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:37,718
You're kind of walking along on flat, and then it happens, and you look back and you're

367
00:21:37,738 --> 00:21:38,839
like, wow, I'm really high.

368
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:42,881
But at the point before it happens, you never even really see that you're right at the precipice,

369
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:46,424
about to take a quick acceleration up.

370
00:21:47,378 --> 00:21:51,119
So if we take what I'm talking about and we turn that into an actual VR forecast.

371
00:21:52,431 --> 00:21:53,152
This is our numbers.

372
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:55,654
I think we're at about 1.5 billion right now.

373
00:21:56,694 --> 00:21:59,617
Growth over the next year to about three,

374
00:21:59,717 --> 00:22:00,798
two years to about eight.

375
00:22:01,418 --> 00:22:03,220
And we have those waves pushing that right now.

376
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,262
We're in the phase of early adoption right now.

377
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:07,583
That's kind of what we'd say is VR 1.0.

378
00:22:09,305 --> 00:22:10,746
2.0 is gonna be console VR.

379
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:14,028
Microsoft will likely push into that as well,

380
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:17,111
as it makes sense for helping them catch back up

381
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,312
in the console race.

382
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:20,814
But when it's really gonna take off is mobile VR.

383
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:26,276
The growth of the industry is all about scale and the platforms that have the opportunity

384
00:22:26,396 --> 00:22:26,976
to scale.

385
00:22:27,796 --> 00:22:29,077
And that really comes from mobile, right?

386
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:34,178
And I think that Apple moving in whenever they do will really push that to the next

387
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:36,359
level when we'll really start to see exponential growth.

388
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:39,980
I think that the key for developers is to...

389
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:45,209
realize what the upside is right now on which platforms.

390
00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:50,311
So maybe I can make a million and a half on the PC VR

391
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:54,013
platforms, or I can get a first party deal, which is sweet.

392
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:58,175
Or there's a several million dollar opportunity, PSVR,

393
00:22:58,195 --> 00:22:58,755
over the next.

394
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:02,198
ear until that install base really grows,

395
00:23:02,678 --> 00:23:05,920
but then being prepared to see when mobile VR takes off

396
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,222
and thinking about what type of functional applications

397
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,183
can really move the needle there.

398
00:23:10,484 --> 00:23:12,205
And that's likely to be social, right?

399
00:23:12,245 --> 00:23:14,106
And thinking about how to connect people

400
00:23:15,087 --> 00:23:16,488
with mobile VR applications.

401
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:20,050
OK, that is my talk.

402
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,792
And it is time for questions.

403
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:22,532
Thank you.

404
00:23:24,621 --> 00:23:25,421
Slides are available.

405
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:26,742
I know I threw a lot of data out there.

406
00:23:26,762 --> 00:23:27,783
I already see a question.

407
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,083
We'll go there first.

408
00:23:29,804 --> 00:23:31,344
We also do free EDAR white papers.

409
00:23:31,524 --> 00:23:32,125
Check those out.

410
00:23:33,165 --> 00:23:35,086
Going to be doing one on VR with some of this data

411
00:23:35,126 --> 00:23:37,688
and more of that consumer data over the next month.

412
00:23:38,088 --> 00:23:39,809
So go there and go back there often.

413
00:23:40,209 --> 00:23:41,269
Doing a mobile one as well.

414
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,291
And then there's an email for our EDAR solutions.

415
00:23:45,912 --> 00:23:48,453
And we have several minutes for questions, I believe.

416
00:23:48,853 --> 00:23:49,013
Yes.

417
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,481
I think I did hear the question though, am I including standalone VR?

418
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:01,371
Talking about snap-in VR on your phone?

419
00:24:02,455 --> 00:24:09,457
Absolutely, yeah. And if I go back to that slide, that's already, if you talk about like

420
00:24:09,997 --> 00:24:16,680
the number of units that are out there, that's already the biggest by far. In January, Google

421
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,881
announced that they'd moved over five million cardboards alone, right? I know that retail

422
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:26,303
deals are, there's several million units of Snap and VR is going to move through Walmart

423
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:29,224
this year at least. So, when we say we're probably at...

424
00:24:29,944 --> 00:24:32,351
you know, somewhere between 5 and 10 million right now.

425
00:24:32,392 --> 00:24:35,280
I think after holiday this year, we'll be higher than that.

426
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,195
I'm sure that we've all tried that, right?

427
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:45,479
That is at a point on the scale where accessibility is as high as it can be.

428
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,419
It's super easy.

429
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:50,122
It is going to be an early way that some come into VR.

430
00:24:50,862 --> 00:24:52,143
Yeah, see there we have it.

431
00:24:52,163 --> 00:24:57,486
So at a $20 price point, you're by far the most units that we're seeing.

432
00:24:58,367 --> 00:24:58,767
It's just...

433
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:01,649
Without the ability to hook into the phone,

434
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:03,610
the applications of what you can do are limited.

435
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,832
And I don't see a breakout functional use case

436
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:12,375
happening on that platform before it

437
00:25:12,415 --> 00:25:15,576
would happen on a synced in mobile platform.

438
00:25:16,437 --> 00:25:16,577
Yeah.

439
00:25:17,978 --> 00:25:18,438
Thanks for the question.

440
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:21,890
So first let me say just thank you for this presentation.

441
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:25,432
It's extremely informative for those of us making VR games.

442
00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:27,453
So thank you a lot for that.

443
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:30,274
The question I had was just looking at your stats on the

444
00:25:30,314 --> 00:25:33,995
number of PCs with VR capable GPUs.

445
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:35,136
You had about 5 million.

446
00:25:35,156 --> 00:25:37,357
Can you talk a little bit about where that data came from?

447
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:40,498
I know that NVIDIA's claimed that they had, earlier this

448
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:44,740
year, it was 10 or 13 million VR capable GPUs.

449
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:46,401
Where does that?

450
00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:53,168
So that comes from conversations with other people in the VR hardware space that I would

451
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:56,210
say are more of an expert on that than myself.

452
00:25:57,711 --> 00:26:04,497
And I will say that I think, and it is based on a VR compatible GPU being like a Radeon

453
00:26:04,977 --> 00:26:10,702
970 or above, or an AMD, the one below the 1060.

454
00:26:13,164 --> 00:26:19,050
You mean the Radeon 280 and the AMD, or the NVIDIA 970?

455
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:24,195
Correct, NVIDIA 970 and the 280. Correct.

456
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:33,344
Does that take into account the recent announcement that Rift made about supporting the 960, which is a lower level?

457
00:26:34,273 --> 00:26:40,560
I think what we're seeing too is the movement down where because they're getting the technology

458
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,525
better to support lower that I will say that this is a conservative number and I would

459
00:26:45,565 --> 00:26:46,066
agree that.

460
00:26:46,506 --> 00:26:52,112
Now, I will say that I don't think it's much higher than maybe 10 million at most, but

461
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:53,554
I will say that it could be closer to 10 million.

462
00:26:57,172 --> 00:27:04,294
about geographies. First of all, great, great, great information here. Thank you. With smartphones

463
00:27:04,314 --> 00:27:12,757
and internet penetration growing at massive levels in emerging markets, I haven't, first,

464
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:19,319
the big question is how about emerging markets with this mobile VR penetration and adoption

465
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:25,301
and if it's at some point correlated with the type of content that is going to be offered

466
00:27:25,341 --> 00:27:25,481
there.

467
00:27:26,598 --> 00:27:31,022
So the question is what about regions and what about global regions and what's the opportunity

468
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:31,222
there?

469
00:27:31,562 --> 00:27:35,005
And this actually gets back to talking about kind of the mobile VR because there's something

470
00:27:35,045 --> 00:27:40,030
that I didn't think to mention, which is, okay, so first of all, we do have good region

471
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:45,574
data for these SteamVR games and the HTC Vive, and it is overwhelmingly Western markets.

472
00:27:45,935 --> 00:27:52,163
It's about 50% United States, then a big chunk, maybe 35% Europe, and then the whole rest

473
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:56,889
of the world is coming up with the rest of that, and almost none of it is in emerging

474
00:27:56,929 --> 00:27:57,210
markets.

475
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:01,075
So when we look at the high end, as you would expect because these are expensive systems,

476
00:28:01,355 --> 00:28:04,059
they're almost all Western developed markets.

477
00:28:04,689 --> 00:28:08,871
Now, I think that there is a huge opportunity for growth

478
00:28:08,972 --> 00:28:15,135
of getting people involved in VR and moving low-end VR headsets,

479
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,196
moving $20 VR headsets.

480
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:20,138
The problem is that there's not a lot of money

481
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:21,358
to be made in software right now.

482
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:24,960
There's not a lot of money to be made in premium software

483
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:26,401
on mobile anyway.

484
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:27,182
It's free to play.

485
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:30,443
And then it's just very difficult

486
00:28:30,504 --> 00:28:31,864
to make these experiences.

487
00:28:32,825 --> 00:28:39,535
on a model that will move revenue on for a snap in mobile headset.

488
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:42,744
So what I would say is, and when we look at that pie

489
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:43,744
of that a billion and a half,

490
00:28:44,785 --> 00:28:48,145
not a lot of it is mobile app revenue.

491
00:28:48,885 --> 00:28:52,266
Most of it is moved by those premium headsets.

492
00:28:52,646 --> 00:28:56,327
So if you are gonna make a low-end VR headset

493
00:28:57,287 --> 00:28:59,088
that can snap in a smartphone,

494
00:28:59,368 --> 00:29:01,208
I think there's a huge opportunity in emerging markets.

495
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,349
I also think that's a very competitive space,

496
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:05,149
working with some clients in that space,

497
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:07,650
with razor-thin margins where you need really good

498
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,830
