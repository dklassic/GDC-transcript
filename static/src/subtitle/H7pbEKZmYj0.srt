1
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:14,090
This is crazy.

2
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:20,733
So it's really wonderful to see all your faces, even covered in masks.

3
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:20,993
But, uh,

4
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:31,437
Yeah, let's go. Sorry, I'm new here. Anyways, I'm Lindsay Thompson. I work at Insomniac Games in Los

5
00:00:31,437 --> 00:00:38,879
Angeles, California, and I want to thank everybody for coming today to hear about the animated world

6
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,560
of Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart.

7
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:46,070
I had the great honor of being a senior cinematic animator

8
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,033
from the very beginning of production.

9
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:52,475
I got to work side by side with my lead, Kevin Groh,

10
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:56,459
animating on and also supervising our cinematic team

11
00:00:56,459 --> 00:01:00,982
for this amazing once in a lifetime project.

12
00:01:00,982 --> 00:01:06,367
So I want to give a little bit of a background on my experience

13
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:09,690
in animation and how I got where I am today.

14
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:15,842
I've been animating in film and video games for about 15 years.

15
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,984
I went to Otis College of Art and Design where I studied 3D animation.

16
00:01:18,984 --> 00:01:25,027
After graduating I got hired at Rhythm and Hues in the apprenticeship program where I

17
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:31,991
worked on my first film, Alvin and the Chipmunks, which as an 80s baby was very, very exciting

18
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,191
for me.

19
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:38,414
After that I worked on The Incredible Hulk and a few other movies.

20
00:01:38,838 --> 00:01:42,942
before getting hired at Weta Digital in New Zealand.

21
00:01:42,942 --> 00:01:46,385
I worked on Avatar while I was in New Zealand,

22
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:49,649
which was a really fun opportunity to animate tails.

23
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,775
And then on to Legend of the Guardians in Sydney, Australia

24
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:56,616
at Animalogic.

25
00:01:58,538 --> 00:02:00,381
I continued to hop around the world a bit.

26
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:02,564
I actually ended up back here in San Francisco

27
00:02:02,564 --> 00:02:04,706
at Industrial Light and Magic,

28
00:02:04,706 --> 00:02:10,013
where I worked on Avengers and Transformers 3.

29
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:10,514
One of them.

30
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:12,596
It was one of the better ones, I think.

31
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:22,414
A quick stint at Disney Animation where I worked on Wreck-It Ralph, which I fully consider my entry to video game animation.

32
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:28,720
I got to animate a lot of really cool, different styled animated characters,

33
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,485
and even like Sonic the Hedgehog in a Disney movie, which was totally weird and that was really cool.

34
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:37,960
I went up to Vancouver, Canada for one more final project,

35
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,063
and I knew I was really ready to move on to something different.

36
00:02:41,063 --> 00:02:47,128
I reached out to a former teacher who was actually working at Insomniac Games

37
00:02:47,128 --> 00:02:49,350
and took a big leap and applied,

38
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,034
and I've now been at Insomniac Games for the last nine years.

39
00:02:56,095 --> 00:02:58,257
So my first project was Sunset Overdrive,

40
00:02:58,257 --> 00:03:00,959
and this was a really awesome start to get into video games.

41
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,500
I was working on the cinematics,

42
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,262
and I even got the opportunity

43
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:06,164
to do a little bit of voiceover work.

44
00:03:06,164 --> 00:03:09,627
So you can find me in the game somewhere.

45
00:03:09,627 --> 00:03:11,388
I can tell you about that later.

46
00:03:11,388 --> 00:03:13,210
It's a little not safe for work,

47
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,771
what I ended up doing in that game, so.

48
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:31,363
Next I got to work on Ratchet and Clank PS4, which was very exciting for me because that was the game that really inspired me over the years to keep Insomniac always in the back of my mind as if I ever worked in video games, that is where I want to work.

49
00:03:31,363 --> 00:03:45,530
On that game I got to actually create, direct, do the cinematography for our first shipped cinematic and that was such a huge career highlight for me, that was such a change from coming from film, getting to work on Ratchet.

50
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:53,976
create the entire scene from scratch, which I think is one of the most incredible benefits of doing animation in games as opposed to film.

51
00:03:53,976 --> 00:04:04,222
So after that I worked on Spider-Man PS4, I was on the open world team, tried something different, and then finally

52
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:06,803
to Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart,

53
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:08,925
which we were so excited to do.

54
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:14,765
In this talk I'm going to talk you guys through the process of our cinematic and gameplay animation.

55
00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:21,829
I'll discuss some of the processes and inspiration behind the wide variety of animation,

56
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:26,551
how we worked with other departments, and how we took on such an ambitious project.

57
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:30,373
So first up, let's discuss cinematics.

58
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:35,359
So cinematics are non-playable cut scenes in our game.

59
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,299
These are nearly identical in process

60
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:42,180
to how we create scenes for film or television.

61
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,041
They're used for spots of emotional storytelling,

62
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:49,182
high action transitions, or spectacle moments.

63
00:04:49,182 --> 00:04:51,042
We knew starting out in this game,

64
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,023
we wanted to create cinematics that rivaled

65
00:04:53,023 --> 00:04:54,903
any feature animated movie.

66
00:04:56,292 --> 00:05:02,777
We knew with the PS5 that we were really going to get a chance to test out how far we could really push the quality of our work.

67
00:05:02,777 --> 00:05:08,921
So Cines are typically limited to locked cameras that the player cannot control,

68
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:13,404
and there's more than one way that we applied them in our game.

69
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:16,867
So to start, there's two main types of cinematics in our game.

70
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:19,969
There's cinematic transitions and cinematic cutscenes.

71
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:23,445
So these differ in length and content.

72
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:26,427
Transitions are mostly interstitial, big, exciting

73
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:29,248
moments, whereas cut scenes can be any length, really,

74
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:31,349
and typically help tell the story.

75
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:34,990
As you can see here, we employ the use of a cinematic

76
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,571
as an exciting transition moment with a bit of spectacle

77
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,473
that otherwise may not have had as large of an impact

78
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,874
within the game camera.

79
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:44,254
We're able to transition a character

80
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:46,875
from one area of gameplay to another with ease.

81
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:51,747
Our cinematic cutscenes were able to tell a much deeper story,

82
00:05:51,747 --> 00:05:54,809
show the characters' emotions and thoughts

83
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:56,570
in a much more intimate way,

84
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,453
or sometimes just like blow stuff up and do crazy things.

85
00:06:00,453 --> 00:06:03,915
So first off, cinematic transitions,

86
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:06,797
our game engine technology on the PS5

87
00:06:06,797 --> 00:06:10,319
allowed us to create seamless weaving

88
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,500
from gameplay to cinematic and back again.

89
00:06:13,762 --> 00:06:19,325
So you can go through combat and running through a chaotic environment to a spectacle cinematic moment in an instant.

90
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:24,127
This helped us significantly with world building and fluid storytelling.

91
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:28,729
We can highlight a mechanic or an environment while keeping the pace up in gameplay.

92
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:34,372
These are the ones that you almost feel more than you notice and see,

93
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:37,493
and the goal is just not to stop the player for very long.

94
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:40,674
There's just so many cool things in this game.

95
00:06:44,214 --> 00:06:48,417
So cinematic cutscenes, on the other hand, are where we slow down,

96
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:52,680
which is sometimes only metaphorically or literally,

97
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,462
to highlight a major moment in the game.

98
00:06:55,462 --> 00:07:01,346
This is the heart of our story and the height of our action.

99
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:03,787
So how do you build a cinematic?

100
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:07,450
How do we take it from something that's rudimentary and representative

101
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,271
to something polished and final?

102
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:14,285
I'm going to share with you here, this is an example of a scene that I was lucky enough

103
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:20,988
to get to pre-vis the entire scene, as well as animate a large chunk of it myself all

104
00:07:20,988 --> 00:07:22,108
the way to final.

105
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:27,730
So I consider this, again, to be one of the biggest perks in working in game development

106
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,470
on a cinematic team.

107
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:36,533
You get the chance to be a director, and a cinematographer, and an animator, and cinematic

108
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:39,293
building is really one of the most rewarding aspects of our job.

109
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:45,389
So first off, we start with the script.

110
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:48,490
We read a script and talk to the narrative team

111
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,372
about the plot, what we want to achieve with the scene,

112
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:53,433
what we want to get across.

113
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:55,294
During Rift Apart, we worked really closely

114
00:07:55,294 --> 00:07:56,534
with our writing team.

115
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:59,016
We actually, when we were still in the studio,

116
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:01,957
I sat back to back with one of our writers,

117
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:04,138
who was also born in Jupiter, Florida,

118
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:05,479
and it was the weirdest thing ever.

119
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,956
So oftentimes in the past, I've worked at plenty of places

120
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:13,477
where these two departments are kept on an island.

121
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:14,658
They're separated, you know,

122
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:16,839
the writer's in their own creative hole,

123
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,440
and then once it gets to animation,

124
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,941
we're just building this thing.

125
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:21,902
Working back and forth,

126
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:25,324
but through some really big, difficult scenes.

127
00:08:26,765 --> 00:08:28,605
This helped us write the best story.

128
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:33,247
It helped us create the best visuals while remaining friendly to the budget.

129
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:38,809
In our finale of our game, we got a big team together in a group chat

130
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,670
and we said, how are we going to do this?

131
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,450
How are we going to show it?

132
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,612
How can we fit this into the budget but also make it cool?

133
00:08:46,612 --> 00:08:48,513
And they were just happy to give and take with us.

134
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:51,094
We knew how things are made.

135
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:52,094
They knew how to tell that story.

136
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:57,859
But yeah, so once we get the script, we move on to previs.

137
00:08:57,859 --> 00:09:00,880
We were fortunate to be able to previs most,

138
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,541
if not all of our cinematics in Rift Apart.

139
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:09,363
So this would basically be taking a really rough pass

140
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:12,765
after reading the script, doing a quick pass on cameras,

141
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:13,985
editing, staging, and timing.

142
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:16,426
This laid the groundwork for our animators

143
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:18,407
to focus on creating their performances.

144
00:09:19,073 --> 00:09:24,341
What you see here is a bit of a Previs Plus, it's kind of a hybrid between Blocking and Previs.

145
00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:28,889
A lot of times, even in Previs, you won't show the character popping from pose to pose,

146
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:31,032
they'd just be sliding into their positions.

147
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:38,098
So for this one, Rivet just won the part that she needs to fix Clank's communicator,

148
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:44,345
and she's gloating about it, and so that was kind of the initial main thing of her walking in,

149
00:09:44,345 --> 00:09:49,591
is she's being a little bit of a jerk about it. Not a jerk, she's just proud.

150
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:58,796
So after the previous process, we'll start gathering assets to set up the animator with the scene to begin working on.

151
00:09:58,796 --> 00:10:08,962
We'll make sure they have the set, the actors, props, anything that they're going to interact with available to them to block everything out.

152
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:13,965
In Rift Apart we keyframed nearly everything, so our scenes were built from the ground up.

153
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:21,446
This differs from a game more like Spider-Man, where a lot of the time we're capturing motion capture data

154
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:23,788
and doing more human-type characters.

155
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:30,333
This game was so full of non-human characters that we were kind of forced to animate everything,

156
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,815
which doesn't really bother an animator.

157
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:37,556
So scenes begin with a kickoff and performance discussion.

158
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:39,496
We'll discuss acting choices and emphasis

159
00:10:39,496 --> 00:10:42,257
on getting the best performance possible.

160
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:44,637
Animators would show an initial pass for sign-off,

161
00:10:44,637 --> 00:10:47,618
and I consider this the most creative process.

162
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:49,538
This is when our animators are empowered

163
00:10:49,538 --> 00:10:53,199
to make creative choice at this stage.

164
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:56,319
Oops, oh no, what have I done?

165
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:57,019
Hold on, okay.

166
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:02,140
So this brings us to our polish stage.

167
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:10,228
So this is once the performance and acting choices are approved and we can really start putting in extra time to all the

168
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:15,750
ears and tails and props and bits and bobs and all that stuff.

169
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,371
And this is the stage where we really wanted to push our work to film quality.

170
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:32,195
Our animators really got to dig into our incredible facial rigs and we had amazing facial blend shapes that allowed our animators to create the most expressive performances that we had ever created in a Ratchet game.

171
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:39,754
But of course, this is not the final work that goes into making our scenes film quality.

172
00:11:39,754 --> 00:11:45,919
Final lighting, effects, audio, environment, secondary cloth, hair simulation,

173
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:48,180
they all go into making these scenes feel so cinematic.

174
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,443
You can see in the background in our levels,

175
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:55,905
they're filled out with vignettes and NPCs

176
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:58,167
created by our gameplay animation team.

177
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,915
This particular level in the game actually has a lot of really fun easter eggs,

178
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:08,238
so I recommend you play it and you walk around and wander and dance and all the things that you can do in there.

179
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:15,202
So clearly we would be nothing, not nothing, but not much without our other departments.

180
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:20,806
We wouldn't have a game, effects, lighting, fur tech, rain, wet fur, atmosphere, sound, music,

181
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,708
it all goes into grounding us into the world of Rift Apart.

182
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:30,124
So another huge part of what made this game so special for many of us

183
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,966
was getting to craft and develop our newest hero, Rivet.

184
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:37,788
Rivet was a dream come true for the team and for me personally.

185
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:39,669
It was an opportunity to create a new hero

186
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:42,071
from one that we'd already known for so many years.

187
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:46,954
So when we started to do some development work on our character,

188
00:12:46,954 --> 00:12:47,934
we started with, who is she?

189
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,276
As you can see, early in production,

190
00:12:51,276 --> 00:12:53,777
we really explored the possibilities of who she could be.

191
00:12:55,145 --> 00:13:00,067
We thought about strong, quirky characters that have inspired us throughout our lives.

192
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:03,149
We wanted her to be tough and strong.

193
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:10,332
She had a different background than Ratchet, but who they are at the core remains the same.

194
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:13,273
We wanted them to be alike but different.

195
00:13:13,273 --> 00:13:15,855
In thinking of her backstory,

196
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:19,056
Rivet, unlike Ratchet, has been on her own for her whole life.

197
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:22,278
She never had a best friend like Clank to help her through her struggles.

198
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:28,716
We asked what has her life as a lone wolf in a dangerous world made her into?

199
00:13:28,716 --> 00:13:30,837
Who is she at her heart?

200
00:13:30,837 --> 00:13:36,742
Has her time alone made her a bit awkward when she finally gets the chance to interact socially?

201
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:40,464
These were all questions that we asked ourselves before going into full production

202
00:13:40,464 --> 00:13:45,588
to make sure our animators had a real good grasp on how she would behave in certain situations.

203
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,063
At her heart, she's kind, determined, resourceful, but always level-headed.

204
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,645
She'll take an enemy down with a smile on her face,

205
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:57,887
knowing that they're no match for her strength and wit.

206
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,648
As we would be passing her off to many different animators to work on,

207
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:03,310
it was crucial that we figured this stuff out.

208
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,111
And we also made a concerted effort to figure out who she isn't.

209
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:10,994
So despite her tough exterior and perceived coolness,

210
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:12,755
she's never cynical, dark or cruel.

211
00:14:13,373 --> 00:14:16,615
Sure, she may not know the best way to act in a social situation,

212
00:14:16,615 --> 00:14:18,356
but she sure as hell isn't shy.

213
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:21,478
She's on a mission for good.

214
00:14:21,478 --> 00:14:24,940
So shown here, we have some early concept character art

215
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,222
to show off the various aspects of her personality.

216
00:14:27,222 --> 00:14:32,085
I volunteered myself early on to help figure her out.

217
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:33,726
So when I first saw these concepts,

218
00:14:33,726 --> 00:14:37,928
I quickly wanted to dig into an early rig that we had of her face

219
00:14:37,928 --> 00:14:41,130
and see how far we could push her expression and appeal.

220
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:46,686
So this is my test that I did here.

221
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,247
Fortunately for us, we had amazing character artists

222
00:14:49,247 --> 00:14:54,408
and rigging team to help facilitate this reality for us.

223
00:14:54,408 --> 00:14:57,489
These were very early 3D pose tests that I created

224
00:14:57,489 --> 00:15:00,870
to show the team that we would be able to embody

225
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,511
the appeal that we see in the best feature films.

226
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:10,099
I was then able to create a pose library for our animation team from these poses.

227
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:17,125
And obviously each scene and facial performance was ultimately handcrafted and keyframed.

228
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,067
But these came in great handy for previs process.

229
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:24,251
When we were trying to sell an idea of what was happening in the scene,

230
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:28,274
sometimes that blank default face doesn't quite go all the way.

231
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:31,216
And this was a quick tool for our animators to be able to do that.

232
00:15:32,538 --> 00:15:35,522
This also helped with keeping our characters on model.

233
00:15:35,522 --> 00:15:38,546
That's a term that definitely comes from the 2D world

234
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:40,929
where they would create character sheets

235
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:43,272
showing what the character looked like on model

236
00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:45,315
and otherwise you would push it too far

237
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:46,877
and it would start not to look like our character.

238
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:50,601
So these guides were really helpful for the team as well.

239
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,434
So it was really important that we got enough early development time in to capture her spirit,

240
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:04,679
and as we were doing this work, we really knew that we were onto something really wonderful.

241
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:09,202
Rivet's an important character to so many of us at Insomniac, and our goal was to do her justice.

242
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:15,765
And just as an aside, she was my favorite part of game development on this project,

243
00:16:15,765 --> 00:16:20,269
and actually my favorite character to animate in the entire 15 years I've worked on anything.

244
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:23,732
And I've worked on a lot of really cool stuff, but she's amazing.

245
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:30,697
A lot of love really went into her, and...

246
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:31,578
Hold on, sorry.

247
00:16:33,297 --> 00:16:36,720
Anyway, it's just been really exciting to see all the community response to the character.

248
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,342
We thought that we had something great,

249
00:16:39,342 --> 00:16:43,965
and everything since then has just really backed that up for us,

250
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:45,586
and it feels really wonderful.

251
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:51,550
So next up, I want to speak about our gameplay animation team

252
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:56,133
and the incredible work they put into making this entire game feel so alive.

253
00:16:58,674 --> 00:17:04,536
So the first stage of any game feature or animation is concepting it out.

254
00:17:04,536 --> 00:17:06,257
All animation starts off from an idea.

255
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:14,360
At the beginning we would concept and explore what exactly we wanted to focus on with our heroes, enemies, and living world actors.

256
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:20,703
Who they were, what type of environment they lived in, or why they were the way they are.

257
00:17:21,928 --> 00:17:26,029
We had the opportunity on this project to create the most unique

258
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:29,869
and varied cast of characters we have ever put into a game before.

259
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:33,630
And the PS5 simply begged us to keep adding more.

260
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,151
One of the main starting ideas we had was,

261
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:41,792
how can we make gameplay and combat even more awesome?

262
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:44,172
We had so many previous games to build off,

263
00:17:44,172 --> 00:17:47,813
but we knew that we were going to have an opportunity to push it much further.

264
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,251
Variety, personality, and humor were key pillars of our production.

265
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:59,554
So, first up we have crowds and living world.

266
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:04,196
We were looking to create moments in the game that not only made the world feel alive,

267
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:08,178
but also creating moments that technically could just happen

268
00:18:08,178 --> 00:18:12,300
if the world existed and the player wasn't even watching.

269
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,262
Sort of like the day-to-day was still happening regardless if the player chose to look at it or not.

270
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,111
We wanted moments in the game where you could see a reaction and recovery happening in real time,

271
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:26,613
like after a fight broke out between a hero and an enemy,

272
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:32,195
or if the hero roamed around the world, how would the civilians or NPCs react around them?

273
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,035
We wanted our worlds to feel very lived in.

274
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:39,668
So in this clip we're in Sargasso, which is our lush, wild planet.

275
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:44,651
And this moment with the dinosaur was created as a moment that you may or may not see

276
00:18:44,651 --> 00:18:49,555
if you don't pan that camera up while you're walking through that section of the game.

277
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:52,577
But it's part of what makes every corner of this game so special.

278
00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:58,441
This attention to detail was something that we insisted on getting in each level and each planet of our game.

279
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:02,689
So we even have like the speedles and flyers

280
00:19:02,689 --> 00:19:05,111
that are roaming around freely in this world.

281
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:09,354
These ambient actors exist with their own unique animation.

282
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:11,877
We worked with design, environment, and rigging

283
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:13,778
to make sure that all of these actors were placed

284
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,860
and integrated into their own unique spaces.

285
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,823
In our Nefarious City mission,

286
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:24,227
we made good use of our buddy follow mechanic

287
00:19:24,227 --> 00:19:25,288
as a tutorial tool,

288
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:28,591
as well as a storytelling and visual experience.

289
00:19:29,526 --> 00:19:31,307
Animation along with our programming team

290
00:19:31,307 --> 00:19:34,368
was able to create this super successful gameplay experience

291
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:35,749
that educated the player,

292
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:39,790
while still making them feel very empowered with traversal.

293
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:46,173
So another aspect that we wanted to improve upon

294
00:19:46,173 --> 00:19:48,034
in our next-gen Ratchet & Clank game

295
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:50,155
was making smarter and more interactive NPCs.

296
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,448
We built out more robust NPCs with more animation

297
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:58,290
so that the reactions could be specific to any enemy type

298
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,510
or direction that they're moving.

299
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,692
Pathing was improved as well as variety.

300
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:05,453
And of course, we were also able to include

301
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:12,336
some really fun standalone vignettes for more life.

302
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,196
Another really cool thing that we introduced

303
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:16,457
in Rift Apart was the Speedle.

304
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:19,158
This was a totally new mechanic for us at Insomniac.

305
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,761
This feature was really fun to iterate on, and just exactly how fast this thing could move,

306
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:30,883
how Rivet held on while she was riding, how she made it go faster.

307
00:20:30,883 --> 00:20:33,705
As it's less frequently used as a mechanic in the game,

308
00:20:33,705 --> 00:20:38,807
we also were able to leverage these characters for inside-of-our-pocket dimension puzzle challenges.

309
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:49,443
You'll notice the blurred shape on the legs when it's going full speed, and we actually used blurred texture cards animated to get that rapid-looking effect on the legs.

310
00:20:49,443 --> 00:21:00,632
I love all the details that were added as well to Rivet when she's going at such high speeds, all the fluttery ears and tail and fur, all of that stuff goes into feeling the speed.

311
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:07,629
So moving on to our enemies.

312
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:10,492
Our team initially focused on how we can make

313
00:21:10,492 --> 00:21:14,775
enemy interacts engaging as well as immersive.

314
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:17,077
We wanted each faction to have their own personality

315
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:19,098
as well as their own attack styles

316
00:21:19,098 --> 00:21:21,480
that felt unique to each character.

317
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,862
Whether it was the goons for less faction

318
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:25,563
or the nefarious bot enemies,

319
00:21:25,563 --> 00:21:27,424
our team made sure that their personalities

320
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,286
came to life through movement.

321
00:21:29,286 --> 00:21:33,509
So we have three main types of enemies in Rift Apart.

322
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,273
So first off we have our popcorn enemies,

323
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:42,917
and these are our fun little one-hit kill guys,

324
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:45,879
like our sand sharks or our toads.

325
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:47,281
Attacks cause damage quickly,

326
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:49,843
especially when they swarm the player.

327
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:51,284
So we include these types of enemies

328
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:53,886
because it's important to maintain a variety during combat

329
00:21:53,886 --> 00:21:56,329
for the best possible feel.

330
00:21:56,329 --> 00:21:59,571
These were some of the less complex to create animation for,

331
00:21:59,571 --> 00:22:02,014
as they lacked any sort of stun or stagger.

332
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:07,733
But it's always fun to be able to amp up these really over-the-top deaths for these one-hit-kill guys

333
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:09,955
because that's pretty much all they do is die.

334
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:15,800
So they had much smaller anim sets than our main enemy factions.

335
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:22,366
So our enemy factions in Rift Apart consisted of three different types.

336
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:27,610
We had the goons for less, who were working for Nefarious.

337
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,872
We had the pirate robots.

338
00:22:29,872 --> 00:22:31,373
And we had the Nefarious troopers.

339
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:37,104
So we made a concerted effort to differentiate the style and personality of each faction.

340
00:22:37,104 --> 00:22:44,591
For the goons for less, we went for a total gym bro who always skips leg day and never

341
00:22:44,591 --> 00:22:47,894
misses an arm day.

342
00:22:47,894 --> 00:22:53,159
We really wanted to make a leg day goon for less, but we just didn't have time.

343
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:54,080
Just giant legs.

344
00:22:55,789 --> 00:23:00,610
So pirate factions are most over the top and cartoony faction.

345
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,930
They have tons of squash and stretch.

346
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:06,271
They are like our classic old school animation.

347
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:09,731
It was so much fun to work on these guys.

348
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:15,852
And there's actually some pretty great smear frames in some of their animations

349
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:19,113
if you use that photo mode really well.

350
00:23:19,113 --> 00:23:21,513
Nefarious troopers are also really over the top.

351
00:23:22,355 --> 00:23:27,498
They had a much different type of traversal that ranged from hovering to octopus-style

352
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:28,818
mech legs.

353
00:23:28,818 --> 00:23:34,401
Personality-wise, what they lack in brains, they make up for in overconfidence.

354
00:23:36,013 --> 00:23:40,674
So the enemy factions had a much greater sized anim set than our popcorn enemies.

355
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:45,155
So for example, if you would hit them from below, the reaction would be like a stumble.

356
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:50,197
Or if you hit them from the side, you would actually feel them stumble or fall left or right, back.

357
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:56,098
All of these animations were keyframed, and each has their own flair when it comes to reacts.

358
00:23:56,412 --> 00:23:59,232
From defining runs and walks, attacks and reacts,

359
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,833
we got to add a lot of squash and stretch to our anims,

360
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,214
and the team had a particularly fun time

361
00:24:05,214 --> 00:24:06,535
with all the death animations.

362
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:10,656
You can also see how much work went into all these enemies

363
00:24:10,656 --> 00:24:13,577
due to the fact that we have so many custom weapons

364
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,818
in the game that will stun or kill differently.

365
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:21,645
And these aren't really your typical shooter weapons.

366
00:24:21,645 --> 00:24:26,067
I wish I could share some of the weapon pitches that didn't make the cut into the game.

367
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:32,190
The best thing about working on a game like Rift Apart is thinking up something like a topiary gun

368
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,491
that would transform your enemy into a topiary bush

369
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:38,312
and then adding some sprinklers to water it

370
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:40,754
and then adding some flowers growing out of it

371
00:24:40,754 --> 00:24:43,295
and then some butterflies.

372
00:24:43,455 --> 00:24:46,257
and how does the enemy bust out of it?

373
00:24:46,257 --> 00:24:47,118
This, all this stuff, you know,

374
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,080
this stuff was pitched by our animators,

375
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,523
and it's, a Rift Apart game is so fun

376
00:24:53,523 --> 00:24:56,306
because you, if you've played them,

377
00:24:56,306 --> 00:24:58,808
you know the guns are crazy.

378
00:24:58,808 --> 00:25:00,409
It's as fun as it looks, so.

379
00:25:03,658 --> 00:25:06,560
So finally we had our boss enemies to tackle.

380
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,762
So our bosses in the game range from a mechanical flying caterpillar

381
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:18,445
to a giant robot emperor nefarious who uses rifts to shove his laser-shooting

382
00:25:18,445 --> 00:25:19,745
giant head at the player.

383
00:25:19,745 --> 00:25:25,127
Our small but mighty boss team created such exciting unique player experiences

384
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:28,989
that stood alone, completely outside of regular enemy combat.

385
00:25:29,497 --> 00:25:31,839
This one in particular is my favorite.

386
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:37,925
Working on our Rift functionality, our team made one of the most unique gameplay experiences I know that I've had.

387
00:25:37,925 --> 00:25:41,008
And like, seriously, how fun is that? It's so cool.

388
00:25:41,008 --> 00:25:45,272
My jaw dropped the first time that I saw it. I was like, what?

389
00:25:45,272 --> 00:25:47,313
I didn't even know we had a giant nefarious bot.

390
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:52,298
So last but not least, we have our heroes.

391
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:57,475
In focusing on gameplay for both heroes,

392
00:25:57,475 --> 00:26:00,597
it meant refining the base that was there with Ratchet

393
00:26:00,597 --> 00:26:03,759
and building on it to create Rivet.

394
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,380
We wanted to make sure that these two heroes

395
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,862
could be told apart in their own distinct way.

396
00:26:08,862 --> 00:26:11,144
We focused on a ton of new mechanics and platforming

397
00:26:11,144 --> 00:26:14,346
that felt fun and relevant to the world of Rift Apart

398
00:26:14,346 --> 00:26:16,587
and created some distinct personality idols

399
00:26:16,587 --> 00:26:18,188
for both Ratchet and Rivet.

400
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,360
This meant that for active or even still moments,

401
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,841
we got to instill personal touches for both characters.

402
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:29,561
And of course, we also had our clank and glitch,

403
00:26:29,561 --> 00:26:33,102
rounding out some secondary hero puzzle missions as well.

404
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:42,364
So, with two heroes in our game,

405
00:26:42,364 --> 00:26:44,064
we wanted to make sure that each one felt unique

406
00:26:44,064 --> 00:26:46,724
while still being able to maintain some economy

407
00:26:46,724 --> 00:26:48,245
of reusing assets.

408
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:54,040
And if anybody says that they don't reuse assets,

409
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,000
I know you guys now.

410
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,925
This is a great way to build off something tried and true that

411
00:26:59,925 --> 00:27:01,506
leaves room to embellish and improve.

412
00:27:01,506 --> 00:27:03,948
We were able to differentiate them with unique idols

413
00:27:03,948 --> 00:27:06,871
and idiosyncrasies, as well as their own unique weapon

414
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:10,614
of choice, hammer versus wrench.

415
00:27:10,614 --> 00:27:12,355
Based on our heroes traveling to different planets

416
00:27:12,355 --> 00:27:13,957
throughout the game, they also picked up

417
00:27:13,957 --> 00:27:15,858
some of their own unique mechanics.

418
00:27:18,145 --> 00:27:23,229
So here are some examples of personalized traversal and some idle flare.

419
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:27,693
Rivet was able to use the speedle mechanic while Ratchet got his own hover boots,

420
00:27:27,693 --> 00:27:35,659
which are so fun, by the way.

421
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:40,263
So what were our main challenges in this project?

422
00:27:40,263 --> 00:27:45,488
The PS5 really helped us in many ways, but it also set up some huge challenges.

423
00:27:47,062 --> 00:27:51,485
How could we best take advantage of the incredible speed that we were now afforded?

424
00:27:51,485 --> 00:27:54,467
From this we developed things like the rift tether mechanic

425
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:58,289
and our epic fixer battle on the grind rails.

426
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:01,051
We were also able to have so many more characters

427
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:03,952
and things moving on screen at the same time.

428
00:28:03,952 --> 00:28:06,334
So this forced us to create some of the greatest variety

429
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:08,755
in character animation that we've ever put into a game.

430
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:16,681
So another snag that was discovering that those real-time reflections turned our sweet

431
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:20,209
little clank's head into one big reflective ball.

432
00:28:21,932 --> 00:28:25,393
So we noticed looking back at some of our scenes finally in Engine

433
00:28:25,393 --> 00:28:30,836
that he was reflecting some parts of himself off camera that were not animated

434
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:33,777
and mainly in cinematics obviously.

435
00:28:33,777 --> 00:28:36,999
So we had to hop back in to quite a few scenes

436
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:41,921
and make sure that there was motion happening that you could see reflected

437
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,482
on the underside of his chin.

438
00:28:44,971 --> 00:28:49,736
The sheer massive scale of this game was just a huge challenge.

439
00:28:49,736 --> 00:28:57,305
We had heroes, enemies, NPCs, creatures, fauna, spacecraft, sheep, you name it.

440
00:28:57,305 --> 00:28:57,945
It was a lot.

441
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:02,330
So how did we get it done?

442
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,693
Lots of ways.

443
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:12,143
We keyframed a ton of this animation to keep that fun style of Ratchet & Clank.

444
00:29:12,143 --> 00:29:14,404
But we did use mocap in instances

445
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:17,366
where it made sense to keep our teams moving fast.

446
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:23,689
Enemies, NPCs, and even heroes benefited from this from time to time.

447
00:29:23,689 --> 00:29:27,551
Partnering with an amazing outsourcing team at VASG

448
00:29:27,551 --> 00:29:30,013
to work hand-in-hand with our cinematic animation team.

449
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:38,545
So one of the best benefits of working during the pandemic was kind of the level playing field of what Zoom did for teams,

450
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:42,026
especially when everybody was working in different spots.

451
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:45,027
It really felt like we were one team.

452
00:29:45,027 --> 00:29:50,289
I worked with our VASG team all week, every week.

453
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,149
We were one.

454
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:54,470
And it was really I'm so grateful to work with them.

455
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,330
They did such an amazing job.

456
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:02,194
And then finally, quick iteration and quick implementation.

457
00:30:02,194 --> 00:30:04,476
Not being afraid to try something fun

458
00:30:04,476 --> 00:30:05,918
and working cross-departmentally

459
00:30:05,918 --> 00:30:08,921
to get our craziest ideas actually in the game.

460
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:10,983
I cannot tell you how many things in this game

461
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:14,887
somebody worked at their desk, made something funny,

462
00:30:14,887 --> 00:30:16,349
sent it to the team, and we're like,

463
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:17,590
okay, it's going into the game.

464
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,532
How do we get this into the game?

465
00:30:19,532 --> 00:30:20,393
There's a lot of that.

466
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:27,050
So I hope you enjoyed hearing a bit about our animation team

467
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:30,191
and our experience on Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart.

468
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:32,392
I could not be more proud of the project.

469
00:30:32,392 --> 00:30:35,993
It was such a joy every day to think of something crazy,

470
00:30:35,993 --> 00:30:38,014
pitch it, and actually put it in the game.

471
00:30:38,014 --> 00:30:41,055
And I want to give another shout out to our incredible team

472
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:43,216
at Insomniac and our partners at BASG

473
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,797
for taking home the coveted Annie Award

474
00:30:45,797 --> 00:30:48,338
for Outstanding Game Animation just a couple weeks ago.

475
00:30:48,338 --> 00:30:49,298
I'm just so proud of them.

476
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:55,959
This team could not have deserved it more, and I'm truly thankful to have been a part of it.

477
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:58,861
So thank you, that's my talk.

478
00:30:58,861 --> 00:30:59,201
Applause

479
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:15,392
So if anybody has any questions, I think there's some microphones.

480
00:31:15,392 --> 00:31:18,734
I'm just gonna dance until somebody has a question.

481
00:31:20,896 --> 00:31:22,717
Yeah.

482
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:23,578
Yay.

483
00:31:23,578 --> 00:31:24,339
Hey, Lindsay.

484
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:25,039
Hi.

485
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:25,280
Oh, wow.

486
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,180
That's pretty good.

487
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:26,340
Yeah.

488
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:26,781
Great talk.

489
00:31:26,781 --> 00:31:32,165
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the rigs and the squash and stretch.

490
00:31:32,165 --> 00:31:32,405
Yes.

491
00:31:32,405 --> 00:31:38,090
If there's anything special that you were doing, if there was any tests that you had

492
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:43,715
to do, and if you worked with the rigging team to try and find the best sort of process

493
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:44,215
and pipeline.

494
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:50,775
Yeah, so he's basically asking about the squash and stretch for the team,

495
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:55,097
if there was anything special that we had to work on with rigging to really get this stuff working.

496
00:31:55,097 --> 00:31:56,257
Yeah.

497
00:31:56,257 --> 00:32:04,942
So we had a rigging team of three people for the whole game.

498
00:32:04,942 --> 00:32:06,742
We may have had an intern come through here and there,

499
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,965
and our interns at Insomniac are amazing, and they do work on the games, and it's awesome.

500
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:20,809
So our team was small but mighty, and we would typically send them case-by-case requests,

501
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:26,072
like I really need to be able to stretch these arms, and we'd send them a little note,

502
00:32:26,072 --> 00:32:31,415
an Ajira, and then sometimes they'd go, oh, we can't do that, but most of the time

503
00:32:31,415 --> 00:32:35,056
they were able to go in and make sure that it worked for us.

504
00:32:35,568 --> 00:32:39,229
We have never had as many different rigs in a game,

505
00:32:39,229 --> 00:32:41,851
because you'll know working on teams,

506
00:32:41,851 --> 00:32:45,412
you typically have shared rigs for certain enemy types,

507
00:32:45,412 --> 00:32:47,093
even if their mesh is different.

508
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:50,314
There's every size and shape here.

509
00:32:51,564 --> 00:32:54,225
It was definitely the animation team getting creative.

510
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:56,346
We definitely broke stuff.

511
00:32:56,346 --> 00:32:57,927
We're just breaking things.

512
00:32:57,927 --> 00:33:01,428
It's, you know, it looks fancy, but yeah,

513
00:33:01,428 --> 00:33:03,029
we're just pulling things off their IK

514
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:05,990
and you know, all that stuff.

515
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,371
But yeah, but the rigging team really came through

516
00:33:08,371 --> 00:33:10,752
and made sure that we had the ability to scale things

517
00:33:10,752 --> 00:33:12,012
when we had that request.

518
00:33:12,012 --> 00:33:13,873
And that back and forth was also something

519
00:33:13,873 --> 00:33:18,655
that was rapid and awesome for us to be able to do our job.

520
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:19,275
Cool, thanks very much.

521
00:33:19,275 --> 00:33:19,735
Awesome talk.

522
00:33:19,735 --> 00:33:20,395
Thank you.

523
00:33:26,345 --> 00:33:26,785
Hi.

524
00:33:26,785 --> 00:33:27,005
Hi.

525
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,570
So I was wondering if the team always

526
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,833
knew that mocap was going to be a part of the process,

527
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:34,555
or if you always knew keyframe was

528
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:36,197
going to be a part of the process,

529
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:39,961
or if realizing how many different moving characters

530
00:33:39,961 --> 00:33:43,526
you can now have on the screen sort of made that a reality.

531
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:46,851
I think it's a little, yeah, a little of everything.

532
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:50,134
We certainly, going into Ratched and Clank,

533
00:33:50,134 --> 00:33:52,476
that is a very keyframe-heavy project

534
00:33:52,476 --> 00:33:54,238
that always has been that way.

535
00:33:54,238 --> 00:33:55,839
It's always been super stylized.

536
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,402
If you look at the old games, they're really over the top.

537
00:33:59,402 --> 00:34:04,787
Like, we've definitely grounded it back a bit

538
00:34:04,787 --> 00:34:06,128
in certain aspects.

539
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,950
So, keyframe was always on the table.

540
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:15,975
Mocap was something that clearly we had become more and more familiar with over the years.

541
00:34:15,975 --> 00:34:18,538
Obviously, insomnia, because, you know, use mocap for...

542
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:24,132
Sunset Overdrive for Resistance, for our Spider-Man games.

543
00:34:24,132 --> 00:34:26,873
It's something that we're familiar with,

544
00:34:26,873 --> 00:34:31,395
so we have that already built into our team,

545
00:34:31,395 --> 00:34:32,476
knowing how to use that.

546
00:34:32,476 --> 00:34:34,577
So when we had certain scenes that we knew

547
00:34:34,577 --> 00:34:37,338
this does not need to be over the top,

548
00:34:37,338 --> 00:34:40,120
none of us were afraid to take advantage of that.

549
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,381
I would say we had a few specific shoots for the game,

550
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:47,183
and it was really the gameplay team more that was using it.

551
00:34:47,344 --> 00:34:50,869
I mean, I'm trying to recall many if...

552
00:34:51,787 --> 00:34:56,008
if any cinematics actually used mocap, it's possible.

553
00:34:56,008 --> 00:34:56,909
I don't want to say that we didn't,

554
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,169
and someone's like, hey, I did.

555
00:34:58,169 --> 00:35:04,911
But yeah, it came out of doing things smarter, not harder.

556
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:07,172
So it works where it works,

557
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:09,293
and then there was other places you put,

558
00:35:09,293 --> 00:35:11,534
throw a little bit of mocap on a weird

559
00:35:11,534 --> 00:35:13,174
little alien character, and you're like,

560
00:35:13,174 --> 00:35:14,655
that looks like a guy in a suit, you know?

561
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:19,517
So it was really taking advantage of all the tools we had

562
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:20,697
to make the best.

563
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:22,641
animation.

564
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:23,062
Thank you.

565
00:35:23,062 --> 00:35:23,302
So, Helou?

566
00:35:23,302 --> 00:35:23,382
Hi.

567
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:28,707
I wanted to know for the hairs and the tail, did you use some physics or it's all keyframed

568
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:29,067
for this part?

569
00:35:29,067 --> 00:35:29,187
Ah, well.

570
00:35:29,187 --> 00:35:29,628
I'm not sure.

571
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,649
I'm not sure.

572
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:32,010
I'm not sure.

573
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,591
I'm not sure.

574
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:33,891
I'm not sure.

575
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:34,452
I'm not sure.

576
00:35:34,452 --> 00:35:35,313
I'm not sure.

577
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:36,454
I'm not sure.

578
00:35:36,454 --> 00:35:37,895
I'm not sure.

579
00:35:37,895 --> 00:35:39,276
I'm not sure.

580
00:35:39,276 --> 00:35:40,637
I'm not sure.

581
00:35:41,648 --> 00:35:43,590
We animated the ears and tails.

582
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,392
Yes, yes.

583
00:35:45,392 --> 00:35:48,435
I think there were tests done.

584
00:35:48,435 --> 00:35:51,377
And I think animators, it's sometimes,

585
00:35:51,377 --> 00:35:53,700
you know, we have tools that help us

586
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,521
kind of generate stuff like that.

587
00:35:57,026 --> 00:35:59,708
But it's still kind of keyframe animated.

588
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:03,290
I don't know that much was simmed.

589
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:07,193
Again, I don't want to say, hey, I simmed all those ears.

590
00:36:07,193 --> 00:36:11,496
No, but at least on our team in cinematics,

591
00:36:11,496 --> 00:36:12,857
yeah, we animated them.

592
00:36:12,857 --> 00:36:14,478
All those ears and tails, yeah.

593
00:36:14,478 --> 00:36:16,820
Thank you.

594
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,280
Thank you.

595
00:36:18,408 --> 00:36:20,071
Hi, Lindsay, fantastic talk.

596
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:24,076
Cinematic transitions are deceptively complex.

597
00:36:24,076 --> 00:36:27,481
I was curious if you could talk a little bit about

598
00:36:27,481 --> 00:36:29,865
like how Insomniac balanced that difficulty between.

599
00:36:30,642 --> 00:36:39,430
level design changing and gameplay beats changing and lerping between player controlled character and camera and cinematic camera and just how you dealt with all.

600
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,511
Okay. Yeah. Yes.

601
00:36:40,511 --> 00:36:42,133
You know where I'm coming from.

602
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,775
Yes, I hear you.

603
00:36:43,775 --> 00:36:46,137
Man, it was a lot.

604
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:51,082
It's that's that's where the teamwork really comes into play.

605
00:36:51,082 --> 00:36:53,344
That is where you.

606
00:36:54,035 --> 00:36:56,337
You're saying all of our problems.

607
00:36:56,337 --> 00:36:59,959
Yes, they are deceptively difficult,

608
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:02,401
and I would say they're much more difficult

609
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:04,443
than putting a cut scene in.

610
00:37:04,443 --> 00:37:07,765
While we do have, you know, we've learned a lot

611
00:37:07,765 --> 00:37:11,749
on our other games, you know, in Spider-Man and beyond

612
00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:14,231
of getting things going from cinematic

613
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:15,692
back to seamless gameplay.

614
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:18,054
We do a ton, we've done a ton of that already

615
00:37:18,054 --> 00:37:21,056
in like our Miles game, Spider-Man.

616
00:37:22,077 --> 00:37:30,579
And that was something that we actively wanted to do in Rift Apart, where these transitions were seamless.

617
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:35,020
So we did get a lot more practice on our big scenes, and that did help us with our action scenes,

618
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,180
but yes, those changed a lot.

619
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:41,601
And those are those scenes that you start at the beginning of production,

620
00:37:41,601 --> 00:37:43,922
and you're still finishing them at the end,

621
00:37:43,922 --> 00:37:47,243
because, oh, now the level design changed, the beats changed.

622
00:37:48,243 --> 00:37:59,107
It's building a really good relationship with your designer on your mission and quick, rapid iteration.

623
00:37:59,107 --> 00:38:09,090
And that goes to getting things in actually as early as possible, because that's how you develop, you know, that's how you figure out these issues.

624
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:15,872
If we were to animate our beautiful little cinematic transition moments and hang on to them and keep them close...

625
00:38:16,513 --> 00:38:21,177
That was a big lesson for me too, getting into game dev.

626
00:38:21,177 --> 00:38:24,539
I worked on film where you animate your perfect little spot

627
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:26,981
and then turn it into something.

628
00:38:26,981 --> 00:38:28,181
Oops, sorry.

629
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,103
And never see it again.

630
00:38:30,103 --> 00:38:33,105
So it's much more collaborative.

631
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:35,306
It is hard.

632
00:38:35,306 --> 00:38:39,449
But we care deeply about that transition feeling good.

633
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:41,230
And games are about feel.

634
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:43,981
Yeah, I can't give you too much technical information

635
00:38:43,981 --> 00:38:45,924
because I'm like, I don't know,

636
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:49,510
someone who's smarter than me makes it work.

637
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,933
That's fine, thank you so much.

638
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:52,334
Thank you.

639
00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:55,546
Hey, Lindsay, Xavier from Free Agents.

640
00:38:55,546 --> 00:38:57,787
We work with a lot of production companies.

641
00:38:57,787 --> 00:39:01,369
We do a lot of cinematics with gaming companies.

642
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:04,792
With timing, and you touched upon this a little bit,

643
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:07,453
with timing getting shorter in terms of the ability

644
00:39:07,453 --> 00:39:11,075
to really finesse the animation and the process,

645
00:39:11,075 --> 00:39:13,837
what are you working with internally with those timeframes

646
00:39:13,837 --> 00:39:16,519
when you're looking at creating these cinematics?

647
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:17,459
You obviously have a...

648
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,882
a toolkit and a lot of the shading, a lot of the designs,

649
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:24,564
a lot of the animation already from the in-house team.

650
00:39:24,564 --> 00:39:27,226
When you're being asked and tasked with creating

651
00:39:27,226 --> 00:39:29,928
these narrative cinematics, what's the timeframes

652
00:39:29,928 --> 00:39:31,449
that you guys are working with internally?

653
00:39:31,449 --> 00:39:34,932
Okay, his question, sorry, I have not been repeating

654
00:39:34,932 --> 00:39:38,814
these questions for the camera, but he's asking about

655
00:39:38,814 --> 00:39:42,437
the kind of the timeline for cinematic creation

656
00:39:42,437 --> 00:39:44,658
and what kind of deadlines and timelines

657
00:39:44,658 --> 00:39:45,999
we're working on creating these?

658
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:46,560
Correct.

659
00:39:46,741 --> 00:39:52,624
They're quick, and that was another rude awakening coming from film to games.

660
00:39:52,624 --> 00:40:00,309
You know, we... sometimes these games, and you guys know, we're making like two or three feature films worth of cinematics.

661
00:40:00,309 --> 00:40:04,031
These are three hours of cinematic. That's a lot.

662
00:40:05,077 --> 00:40:09,802
But we're making a ton, and so we're on a very quick schedule, and we typically have smaller teams.

663
00:40:09,802 --> 00:40:14,827
And I know that sometimes that lends itself to maybe less polished animation.

664
00:40:14,827 --> 00:40:20,633
But I would say that our scenes in Rift Apart were anywhere...

665
00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:25,759
You know, you would have maybe a week or two to pre-vis the scene out.

666
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:27,080
And then we would...

667
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:31,301
go anywhere from three to six weeks,

668
00:40:31,301 --> 00:40:34,083
sometimes they go longer on really big,

669
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:37,045
complex, multi-character action scenes.

670
00:40:37,045 --> 00:40:41,049
And that goes to the, is mo-cap gonna help us here?

671
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:42,930
All these background characters,

672
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,212
is it gonna be helpful if I can fill these people out

673
00:40:45,212 --> 00:40:48,655
with animation, rather than animating like a weight shift

674
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,776
on an NPC, which is so hard.

675
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:56,963
So yeah, I mean, definitely faster than film.

676
00:40:56,963 --> 00:40:59,644
But yeah, we are on rapid schedules

677
00:40:59,644 --> 00:41:04,387
and we're always trying to figure out.

678
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:09,054
what's going to help us here once this gets in lighting.

679
00:41:09,054 --> 00:41:12,276
And we always want to get it in as soon as possible

680
00:41:12,276 --> 00:41:13,696
because we want to start problem solving

681
00:41:13,696 --> 00:41:15,897
or seeing what environmental aspects

682
00:41:15,897 --> 00:41:19,659
are going to cause us trouble as soon as possible.

683
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:23,520
So in the previous stage, we try to get it exported

684
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,341
into the game looking really rough

685
00:41:25,341 --> 00:41:28,182
and then working on those problems right away.

686
00:41:28,182 --> 00:41:31,324
So it's fast, it's very fast iteration

687
00:41:31,324 --> 00:41:33,165
and the team is amazing.

688
00:41:33,165 --> 00:41:33,585
And yeah.

689
00:41:33,585 --> 00:41:34,185
Thank you.

690
00:41:37,643 --> 00:41:38,684
Hi, that was a great talk.

691
00:41:38,684 --> 00:41:40,985
You said something I really empathize with,

692
00:41:40,985 --> 00:41:44,186
which is remote work really leveled the playing field.

693
00:41:44,186 --> 00:41:46,087
You get to work with your outsourcers.

694
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:50,909
And I was curious if that changed the way you defined

695
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:52,929
how something was done.

696
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:55,390
Like, when did you determine something was finished

697
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,551
when you had that much more cross-collaboration

698
00:41:57,551 --> 00:41:58,271
between teams?

699
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,152
Like, did that change your approach at all?

700
00:42:01,105 --> 00:42:06,311
So he's asking, did the level playing field of Zoom

701
00:42:06,311 --> 00:42:09,534
affect how we determine when things were finished,

702
00:42:09,534 --> 00:42:14,339
because we had so much more communication?

703
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:19,225
I will say that I think it sped the process up,

704
00:42:19,225 --> 00:42:19,886
because

705
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:25,142
Again, it felt like we weren't kept on separate islands.

706
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:26,704
We were all in this Zoom meeting.

707
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:28,565
There wasn't like, well, the outsourcing team's

708
00:42:28,565 --> 00:42:30,586
going to show up on the camera on the wall,

709
00:42:30,586 --> 00:42:33,388
and we're all here in person as a team.

710
00:42:33,388 --> 00:42:35,389
We were all together.

711
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,611
So just it feels like.

712
00:42:38,007 --> 00:42:43,932
the pandemic really upped our ability to be more available for quick communication because there

713
00:42:43,932 --> 00:42:50,158
was no tapping somebody on the shoulder so you had to be a lot more cognizant of your presence

714
00:42:50,158 --> 00:42:51,679
online and your availability.

715
00:42:53,867 --> 00:42:59,532
That said, I'm not sure how much it affected how far we would push things.

716
00:42:59,532 --> 00:43:02,114
We still always have budgets and timelines and

717
00:43:02,114 --> 00:43:04,716
how much time we can put into something.

718
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:07,819
And we try to make the best choices.

719
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:09,560
You know, there are times when you're like, well,

720
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,902
we may need to sacrifice a little bit here.

721
00:43:11,902 --> 00:43:15,505
But as long as this part of it's looking good, it's gonna feel good.

722
00:43:15,505 --> 00:43:19,088
So that really came down to some of the decisions.

723
00:43:19,088 --> 00:43:19,729
Great, thank you.

724
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:19,829
Mm-hm.

725
00:43:22,919 --> 00:43:30,502
Hi, when it comes to building a scene and you've got your previous stage and at some points you're

726
00:43:30,502 --> 00:43:34,944
going to be adding in all your background assets and your characters and you've got a team of

727
00:43:34,944 --> 00:43:40,387
people who are working individually, how do you find yourself coming together with all these assets

728
00:43:40,387 --> 00:43:44,889
that synergize well instead of just having a really busy scene that's kind of got a bit of

729
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:50,451
a visual fatigue to it or is that all kind of sorted out previously blocking out before you

730
00:43:50,451 --> 00:43:52,212
start adding everything together?

731
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,871
That's a good question.

732
00:43:54,871 --> 00:43:57,352
She's asking about how do we work

733
00:43:57,352 --> 00:43:59,293
with all these different teams

734
00:43:59,293 --> 00:44:02,215
to make sure that all the gameplay teams

735
00:44:02,215 --> 00:44:05,476
and everybody's placing their own stuff in the level

736
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,977
and making that not some kind of visual fatigue

737
00:44:07,977 --> 00:44:11,799
of too much stuff, how do we coordinate all of that?

738
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:17,052
that goes to getting this stuff in game as soon as possible.

739
00:44:17,052 --> 00:44:20,554
So when it comes to cinematics,

740
00:44:20,554 --> 00:44:23,096
we definitely do drive the visuals,

741
00:44:23,096 --> 00:44:25,918
and oftentimes, there's plenty of times

742
00:44:25,918 --> 00:44:28,279
in a lot of the games that we've worked on

743
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:31,641
where I need to show an establishing shot of this,

744
00:44:31,641 --> 00:44:33,423
and I need this person to show up

745
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:34,483
and walk in here and be here,

746
00:44:34,483 --> 00:44:37,325
but ugh, there is a table right in the way.

747
00:44:37,325 --> 00:44:40,527
Can you please take this table out of this scene?

748
00:44:40,527 --> 00:44:42,268
And environments usually like.

749
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:43,590
Yes, we can.

750
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,192
And we're like, thank you.

751
00:44:45,192 --> 00:44:48,697
But then, every now and then, you

752
00:44:48,697 --> 00:44:51,721
find out this table is critical to game play.

753
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:53,664
And we go, oh, OK.

754
00:44:53,664 --> 00:44:55,126
So then we have to adjust.

755
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:56,268
So it's really.

756
00:44:57,325 --> 00:45:02,670
I will say that all of the teams at the studio are typically very, very nice to us cinematic animators.

757
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,394
And can we make sure...

758
00:45:06,394 --> 00:45:08,796
What's really cool is that you'll be like,

759
00:45:08,796 --> 00:45:12,960
this is what's happening in this scene and this is actually a really emotional moment.

760
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,504
Is there any way we can make sure that there's a light highlighting this thing?

761
00:45:18,024 --> 00:45:20,386
and lighting's like, cool, thank you for telling me that.

762
00:45:20,386 --> 00:45:22,047
Yes, I'll make sure that that's lit.

763
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,468
I'll make sure that that is important in the scene.

764
00:45:24,468 --> 00:45:27,610
So we are working together with every department

765
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:29,211
to do this visual storytelling.

766
00:45:29,211 --> 00:45:31,833
And then going to put it in game,

767
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:33,494
a lot of that stuff you saw in that scene

768
00:45:33,494 --> 00:45:35,956
that I was animating is done by gameplay animation,

769
00:45:35,956 --> 00:45:37,777
and that is what is playing.

770
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:40,459
That's all happening real time in the game,

771
00:45:40,459 --> 00:45:42,700
and then once we return to gameplay, they're all there.

772
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,722
So every now and then, we're like,

773
00:45:46,762 --> 00:45:49,483
So we did that scene and that scene ends up being a little bit emotional.

774
00:45:49,483 --> 00:45:51,744
That's the first time she talks to Ratchet, all this stuff.

775
00:45:51,744 --> 00:45:57,767
And then we noticed in the background that there's like one of the Morts like riding a bull.

776
00:45:57,767 --> 00:46:01,409
And it was like when we first shot it with our cameras we were like,

777
00:46:01,409 --> 00:46:04,611
oh, that's a little, that doesn't feel right.

778
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:08,673
But we couldn't really take the Mort out of the bull because when you go back he's riding it

779
00:46:08,673 --> 00:46:12,135
and we didn't create animations of him jumping off and jumping back on.

780
00:46:12,135 --> 00:46:14,316
So we're going to take that camera and...

781
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:18,670
make sure that we can't see him during this really emotional part of the game.

782
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:21,655
So it's totally just constant collaboration.

783
00:46:21,655 --> 00:46:22,657
Thank you.

784
00:46:22,657 --> 00:46:22,857
Hello.

785
00:46:29,405 --> 00:46:35,188
Just real quick, I'm curious in the early level design process when we're building a level

786
00:46:35,188 --> 00:46:36,909
We have lots and lots of cinematics that need to go in

787
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:37,789
Yeah

788
00:46:37,789 --> 00:46:44,252
And what we usually have in the beginning is I guess kind of a black screen with text that describes what's supposed to happen here

789
00:46:44,252 --> 00:46:49,974
Do you guys do the same thing when you're stubbing in these gameplay transition cinematics and the proper full cinematics?

790
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,615
What does it look like in the earliest version?

791
00:46:53,172 --> 00:46:54,313
Great question.

792
00:46:54,313 --> 00:46:57,574
He's asking, what does the cinematic look

793
00:46:57,574 --> 00:47:00,175
like in really early production when we're stubbing everything

794
00:47:00,175 --> 00:47:02,816
in and when the designers are really going

795
00:47:02,816 --> 00:47:05,677
to work on laying out the level?

796
00:47:05,677 --> 00:47:08,978
We do black cards for sure.

797
00:47:08,978 --> 00:47:13,499
Those are usually put in by the designer very early.

798
00:47:13,499 --> 00:47:16,900
That's even sometimes before we've even, on our team,

799
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,061
started playing through the mission

800
00:47:18,061 --> 00:47:20,002
and feeling the beats of that.

801
00:47:20,602 --> 00:47:26,283
So that's a tool that they'll use to make sure that anybody playtesting is going to know that a cinematic is coming there.

802
00:47:26,283 --> 00:47:35,625
There are some times that we're able to get some kind of a 2D animatic in where it starts to at least have a little bit of timing and some dialogue.

803
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:39,326
I record a lot of scratch audio at the studio.

804
00:47:39,326 --> 00:47:43,947
I've played every female character in every one of our games.

805
00:47:43,947 --> 00:47:44,047
So...

806
00:47:45,367 --> 00:47:49,332
We do that a lot and then once we get our previous pass,

807
00:47:49,332 --> 00:47:51,914
we try to, we hook those up as quickly as possible

808
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:55,658
because it really helps the designer with flow

809
00:47:55,658 --> 00:47:56,820
and we always have to work with them.

810
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,821
How do we come into this?

811
00:47:57,821 --> 00:47:58,622
How do we go out?

812
00:47:58,622 --> 00:48:00,263
In's and out's, all that stuff.

813
00:48:00,263 --> 00:48:01,985
So yeah, there's definitely some black cards

814
00:48:01,985 --> 00:48:02,786
in the game at first.

815
00:48:04,573 --> 00:48:08,235
Do you guys work with storyboard animators, or is it something you guys do?

816
00:48:08,235 --> 00:48:13,737
It's really, on Ripped Apart, we really did everything in 3D.

817
00:48:13,737 --> 00:48:18,519
So, it was all 3D previs. We didn't really have...

818
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:24,522
I think sometimes designers would grab some concept art from our amazing concept artist, Dave Gurton,

819
00:48:24,522 --> 00:48:30,784
and I think we had a few others on the project, and sometimes that's used as visual representation,

820
00:48:30,784 --> 00:48:33,645
but we typically did all of our previs in 3D.

821
00:48:34,907 --> 00:48:36,408
Okay, great, thank you.

822
00:48:36,408 --> 00:48:36,529
Mm-hmm.

823
00:48:36,529 --> 00:48:36,889
Close riveted.

824
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:38,310
What time is it, anybody?

825
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:40,972
Yes, okay, we have 10 minutes.

826
00:48:40,972 --> 00:48:41,292
Hi, Lindsay.

827
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:41,372
Hi.

828
00:48:41,372 --> 00:48:41,913
Ooh, that's loud.

829
00:48:41,913 --> 00:48:45,816
Hey, what's up, James?

830
00:48:45,816 --> 00:48:47,778
So, you let us know that Rivet

831
00:48:47,778 --> 00:48:51,681
is one of your favorite characters.

832
00:48:51,681 --> 00:48:52,101
Yeah.

833
00:48:52,101 --> 00:48:56,144
What was your favorite animation

834
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:58,646
that you did for Rivet and why?

835
00:48:58,646 --> 00:49:00,308
Okay, and why?

836
00:49:00,695 --> 00:49:05,838
He's asking what my favorite animation I got to do with Rivet.

837
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:10,280
It's actually, I think it is in that scene that I showed,

838
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:15,002
just when she just mean mugs Clank after he giggles.

839
00:49:15,002 --> 00:49:19,584
Animating Clank giggling and her reaction to it was really fun.

840
00:49:19,584 --> 00:49:24,866
And I just, I mean it's all, like, it's me.

841
00:49:24,866 --> 00:49:25,626
Like, that is, she is me.

842
00:49:25,626 --> 00:49:28,888
It was fun to relate to a character for once.

843
00:49:30,285 --> 00:49:34,888
My career has been full of big hulking monsters and robots.

844
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:39,031
So to actually feel like you get to put yourself into a character

845
00:49:39,031 --> 00:49:45,175
and she's smart and kind of sarcastic and all that stuff.

846
00:49:45,175 --> 00:49:49,778
So just any time I get the chance to do a really funny facial expression on her.

847
00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:56,262
was fun. And then I didn't actually get to animate, but I did get to lay out and

848
00:49:56,262 --> 00:50:02,966
previs our final scene of the game with Rivet and Kit having a moment.

849
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:09,650
And I definitely cried a little bit the first time I saw the two of them in

850
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:13,632
game with the beautiful sunset. So yeah, that scene was really special too.

851
00:50:13,632 --> 00:50:16,293
Thank you. Thank you, James.

852
00:50:19,765 --> 00:50:22,127
Hi, oh God, it's so loud, sorry.

853
00:50:22,127 --> 00:50:26,030
Thank you so much, a really incredible talk.

854
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:29,513
I'd love to hear you speak more on,

855
00:50:29,513 --> 00:50:32,135
when your team is sort of white boarding out

856
00:50:32,135 --> 00:50:34,036
all of these different bespoke animations

857
00:50:34,036 --> 00:50:39,380
that they want to have happen in the background of a world,

858
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,061
how do you go about?

859
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:48,552
like prioritizing what can be built out of everything they want to build and then

860
00:50:48,552 --> 00:50:50,555
How do you as a lead help?

861
00:50:50,555 --> 00:50:57,984
Help like protect the motivation of your team when things that they want to do aren't just aren't able or just not in the production

862
00:50:57,984 --> 00:50:58,225
budget

863
00:50:58,575 --> 00:51:01,777
Yeah, that's a good question.

864
00:51:01,777 --> 00:51:06,860
They're asking about when there's so much ideas

865
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,761
and so many characters to work on,

866
00:51:08,761 --> 00:51:11,383
how do we parse that out of what gets in the game

867
00:51:11,383 --> 00:51:13,404
and what doesn't, and how do we protect

868
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:16,446
the team and their intentions in making sure

869
00:51:16,446 --> 00:51:17,666
that that vision is seen?

870
00:51:19,548 --> 00:51:25,762
It's hard and there are so many pitches on the cutting room floor that are really fun.

871
00:51:25,762 --> 00:51:29,130
But, you know, often times we...

872
00:51:30,927 --> 00:51:36,410
In a game like this you can get so creative and so many ideas.

873
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:38,291
It's a well of creativity.

874
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:41,573
And we do oftentimes think of things that are super fun,

875
00:51:41,573 --> 00:51:44,034
but they're not right for the world

876
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:46,255
or right for the character necessarily,

877
00:51:46,255 --> 00:51:49,877
even though it's the most fun thing you've ever done or seen.

878
00:51:49,877 --> 00:51:53,058
So there's a lot of does it fit into the world?

879
00:51:54,201 --> 00:51:56,002
Does it add to the game?

880
00:51:56,002 --> 00:51:58,183
Is the game okay without it?

881
00:51:58,183 --> 00:52:02,564
Obviously, when it comes to all those smaller NPC characters,

882
00:52:02,564 --> 00:52:04,665
the critical stuff is obviously the main moves

883
00:52:04,665 --> 00:52:06,646
that they have to be able to do.

884
00:52:06,646 --> 00:52:10,748
Directional attacks, directional reacts,

885
00:52:10,748 --> 00:52:12,588
traversal.

886
00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:13,949
Stuff like that.

887
00:52:13,949 --> 00:52:16,490
So that stuff definitely gets prioritized.

888
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:17,450
But we do get to a stage,

889
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,631
I mean, every character that can idol

890
00:52:19,631 --> 00:52:22,692
also has personality idols.

891
00:52:22,692 --> 00:52:27,433
So we make sure that you have your basic standing,

892
00:52:27,433 --> 00:52:29,414
but what are they doing when they stand

893
00:52:29,414 --> 00:52:30,434
for a really long time?

894
00:52:30,434 --> 00:52:32,555
Everything gets something like that.

895
00:52:32,555 --> 00:52:34,875
And there's other characters that we realize

896
00:52:34,875 --> 00:52:35,816
that you see more.

897
00:52:36,376 --> 00:52:40,439
And so we put more time into those, knowing that the player's going to get to experience that a lot.

898
00:52:40,439 --> 00:52:44,782
And every now and then, you know, you put a ton of work into some...

899
00:52:44,782 --> 00:52:50,166
There's some really fun pirate stuff that actually gets totally hidden by some of the weapons.

900
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:56,490
We were like, you know, like the squash and stretch and all this stuff, and you see it, and then there's just like a cloud of smoke.

901
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:01,594
But you still feel it. You do see it. It's in the game.

902
00:53:01,594 --> 00:53:01,774
But...

903
00:53:02,299 --> 00:53:08,322
That again is another reason why it's so important to get this stuff hooked up as quickly as possible

904
00:53:08,322 --> 00:53:11,543
to start seeing how often is the player going to interact with this.

905
00:53:11,543 --> 00:53:15,946
How often are they going to see this? Realizing that when these popcorn enemies show up,

906
00:53:15,946 --> 00:53:21,688
you kind of just take them out right away. So maybe they don't need idle flair because

907
00:53:21,688 --> 00:53:25,310
how often are you going to stand and just watch them all hanging out in a field?

908
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:33,455
So that's kind of a bummer sometimes, but we do try to make sure that anything somebody's really passionate about,

909
00:53:33,455 --> 00:53:36,157
that they're able to put it into the game.

910
00:53:36,157 --> 00:53:41,060
And that goes to reaching out to other departments and getting support.

911
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:44,482
And, you know, we have a very supportive team that's, this is cool.

912
00:53:45,479 --> 00:53:48,522
Let's get this in the game, let's get Spider Cat in the game.

913
00:53:48,522 --> 00:53:50,465
So, stuff like that.

914
00:53:50,465 --> 00:53:51,986
And you know, there are budgets,

915
00:53:51,986 --> 00:53:55,190
but if the team is really passionate about it,

916
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,311
we'll try to make it work.

917
00:53:56,311 --> 00:53:58,273
Cool, thank you so much.

918
00:53:58,273 --> 00:53:59,034
Thank you.

919
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:08,670
Hi.

920
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:08,790
Hi.

921
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:10,912
I was wondering how early you start

922
00:54:10,912 --> 00:54:14,035
working with the visual effects department,

923
00:54:14,035 --> 00:54:16,877
and what that kind of collaboration looks like,

924
00:54:16,877 --> 00:54:18,959
if you're under the same umbrella for trying

925
00:54:18,959 --> 00:54:20,681
to get things like the direction, or the feeling,

926
00:54:20,681 --> 00:54:21,942
or the timing of animations incorporated.

927
00:54:21,942 --> 00:54:22,282
Yeah.

928
00:54:22,282 --> 00:54:23,944
So you're saying that you work in visual effects?

929
00:54:23,944 --> 00:54:25,445
I was curious how you kind of collaborate.

930
00:54:25,445 --> 00:54:29,469
How we work with the visual effects department?

931
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:33,212
Yeah, between animation and visual effects.

932
00:54:33,802 --> 00:54:36,964
Again, it's very collaborative.

933
00:54:36,964 --> 00:54:41,768
We oftentimes, as scenes are in their really early phase,

934
00:54:41,768 --> 00:54:44,530
we'll show a blocking pass to other departments

935
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:46,811
and we start talking about content.

936
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:51,054
We start talking about things that we'll need from other departments.

937
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:57,560
So, you know, if we have a moment where a character's, like, moving and then, like,

938
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:02,785
their arm catches on fire, we definitely have to work side by side, giving them...

939
00:55:02,785 --> 00:55:07,830
It's important for us to give them what they need, sorry, to do that.

940
00:55:08,234 --> 00:55:13,542
We have to make sure that they get our blocking pass as early as possible so that they can do their blocking pass and then

941
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:19,590
We were fine side by side a lot of people think that production is like step one writing step two

942
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,293
Then we block it is

943
00:55:22,831 --> 00:55:25,072
That's the path of game development.

944
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:27,453
It's constantly passing stuff back and forth

945
00:55:27,453 --> 00:55:29,395
and back and forth, and I changed that arm,

946
00:55:29,395 --> 00:55:31,456
so now you gotta change that fire, I'm sorry.

947
00:55:31,456 --> 00:55:35,138
And we locked that, and no, we're unlocking it.

948
00:55:35,138 --> 00:55:40,521
Yeah, it's nonlinear, and it's hoping,

949
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:43,102
hopefully you're getting each team of the department

950
00:55:43,102 --> 00:55:47,024
kind of working on the different various phases together

951
00:55:47,024 --> 00:55:50,886
and going back and forth and, you know, all of that stuff.

952
00:55:50,886 --> 00:55:52,467
So, yeah, it's definitely not linear.

953
00:55:53,428 --> 00:55:54,950
Cool, thanks.

954
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:55,290
Mm-hmm.

955
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:55,350
Oh.

956
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:55,690
Okay, thank you.

957
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:56,311
Hey, I have a question.

958
00:55:56,311 --> 00:56:01,274
How many animators are involved in playtesting?

959
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:05,357
And if you would be able to say

960
00:56:05,357 --> 00:56:14,364
if all the team basically finished the game,

961
00:56:14,364 --> 00:56:16,045
like played the whole thing.

962
00:56:16,045 --> 00:56:18,927
And played the whole thing?

963
00:56:18,927 --> 00:56:19,328
Yeah.

964
00:56:20,123 --> 00:56:26,739
So he's asking like how many animators are involved in playtesting and do I know if the whole team played the whole game?

965
00:56:26,739 --> 00:56:27,621
during production

966
00:56:29,369 --> 00:56:31,170
we're always playing the game.

967
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,092
So we are always play testing,

968
00:56:33,092 --> 00:56:34,573
whether it's not official or not,

969
00:56:34,573 --> 00:56:37,235
we're constantly, it's really important

970
00:56:37,235 --> 00:56:39,036
for us to get in the game.

971
00:56:39,036 --> 00:56:42,378
Gameplay, especially, are constantly playing their levels,

972
00:56:42,378 --> 00:56:44,140
making sure that things are placed correctly,

973
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,242
working with design, and that everything looks right.

974
00:56:47,242 --> 00:56:49,203
And then cinematics, it's really important for us

975
00:56:49,203 --> 00:56:50,544
to see how these things are flowing

976
00:56:50,544 --> 00:56:51,905
from gameplay in and out,

977
00:56:51,905 --> 00:56:54,207
and then especially those transitional cinematics.

978
00:56:54,207 --> 00:56:57,829
Those are high action, those should not slow you down

979
00:56:57,829 --> 00:56:58,810
or bog you down.

980
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:01,832
And so we have to make sure that that's feeling good.

981
00:57:01,832 --> 00:57:03,833
As for the team playing the whole game,

982
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:06,535
I definitely didn't play the whole game during production,

983
00:57:06,535 --> 00:57:09,597
but I totally platinumed it after it came out.

984
00:57:09,597 --> 00:57:12,678
And it was really fun.

985
00:57:12,678 --> 00:57:15,080
That was my first platinum ever on any game.

986
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,781
I just really had fun playing it.

987
00:57:17,781 --> 00:57:21,984
So, yeah, I think I would say probably like designers.

988
00:57:21,984 --> 00:57:23,145
We're close, yeah.

989
00:57:23,145 --> 00:57:26,146
Yeah, designers definitely play, you know.

990
00:57:26,892 --> 00:57:30,073
We're just like in the animation world sometimes, so yeah.

991
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:31,953
All of that, but yes, I play the game.

992
00:57:31,953 --> 00:57:33,434
Cool, thanks.

993
00:57:33,434 --> 00:57:35,695
I think, is that it?

994
00:57:35,695 --> 00:57:37,435
Are we good?

995
00:57:37,435 --> 00:57:39,356
Thank you guys so much.

996
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:41,897
This was really scary, but it was really fun.

997
00:57:41,897 --> 00:57:47,038
So I think I might be in another room to do follow-up

998
00:57:47,038 --> 00:57:49,159
and rate and review me.

999
00:57:49,159 --> 00:57:52,260
I don't know, smash that subscribe button.

1000
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,501
I think there's something in your passes.

1001
00:57:54,501 --> 00:57:56,162
But thank you guys so much for coming.
