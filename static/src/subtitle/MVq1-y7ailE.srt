1
00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:06,536
I guess we're starting.

2
00:00:06,536 --> 00:00:11,537
Hi, thanks for everybody for coming to Rules of the Game

3
00:00:11,537 --> 00:00:12,618
for 2017 here.

4
00:00:12,618 --> 00:00:15,459
I guess I wanted to say thanks to anybody

5
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:17,159
who came from outside the US.

6
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:18,760
I know this is a time you might be worried

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,780
about that sort of thing.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,621
Most of my friends fortunately made it in OK.

9
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:24,442
I'm glad to see everyone here, and you're certainly

10
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,943
welcome at my session to talk game design, regardless

11
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,063
of your country of origin.

12
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:31,292
So in this session, if you're not familiar with the format,

13
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:34,554
we take five illustrious speakers

14
00:00:34,554 --> 00:00:36,194
who you see listed here on the screen,

15
00:00:36,194 --> 00:00:38,155
and we give them each 10 minutes to talk

16
00:00:38,155 --> 00:00:40,376
about one of their personal rules about game design.

17
00:00:40,376 --> 00:00:42,698
So we've done this a few times before.

18
00:00:42,698 --> 00:00:47,180
We did this in 2015 when we got these five cool rules,

19
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,701
and then we did it again last year with these five speakers.

20
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:51,042
If you want to check these talks out,

21
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:54,323
they're both up on the vault, and the first one is free.

22
00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:56,184
If you search for five rules on GDC Vault,

23
00:00:56,184 --> 00:00:57,265
these come right up.

24
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:19,024
So why are we talking about rules, you know why do we get game designers care about rules obviously as game designers our job is creating rules basically to make a game work, you know many of us like rules because you know we like games in the first place games are built out of rules they make a very noble world they make a world that's consistent that seems fair when you're playing bridge.

25
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:23,571
You know the order of how the players go,

26
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:27,136
you know how you bid for a contract, you know you win a contract.

27
00:01:27,136 --> 00:01:32,284
It's always clear cut who wins or loses a game because of the rules.

28
00:01:32,284 --> 00:01:34,327
Even a more advanced game like, say, Diplomacy...

29
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:37,856
You know, the rules can be simply more complex

30
00:01:37,856 --> 00:01:39,077
and open to interpretation,

31
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:41,218
but you might have some house rules or something like that,

32
00:01:41,218 --> 00:01:42,879
but you discuss this ahead of time, you agree on it.

33
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,861
And if anyone who's in the middle of playing a game

34
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:46,982
with diplomas, he starts changing the rules,

35
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,543
you might get upset about that.

36
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:50,885
And you know, so we as game designers like rules,

37
00:01:50,885 --> 00:01:53,547
and I think we appreciate them in other places too,

38
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,368
like say, in forms of governments.

39
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:56,709
You know, we may appreciate systems

40
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:59,451
that are put in place for good reason,

41
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:01,813
that even when someone may go off the rails in one branch,

42
00:02:01,813 --> 00:02:03,294
you know, the system hopefully keeps them

43
00:02:03,294 --> 00:02:04,194
from destroying everything.

44
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:10,718
And we as designers recognize that these rules are important even when the guy we like is in charge.

45
00:02:10,718 --> 00:02:13,140
Anyway, so moving back to game development,

46
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,103
the sad reality is that in the creative endeavor of game development or anything,

47
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:22,866
there are no hard and fast rules, right? It's much more open to

48
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:26,868
interpretation and personal taste. Rules are a personal taste when it comes to creating games.

49
00:02:27,528 --> 00:02:31,070
So these are some of the designers who have been, you know, who were highly inspirational

50
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,011
to me growing up and over the years.

51
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:36,673
I think if you ask these people, like, what their rules about game design were, you would

52
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:38,173
get some very different answers.

53
00:02:38,173 --> 00:02:40,134
They would each have their own thing that they did.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,121
So as you hear the rules from our illustrious speakers here today think

55
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:48,523
about that these are their personal rules, you know they may or may not

56
00:02:48,523 --> 00:02:52,525
apply to you right now in this moment or not right now anyway.

57
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:57,608
We think about the cycle of game development as we're all familiar with

58
00:02:57,608 --> 00:03:01,570
it. You may be aware of the dark doldrums in the middle of a project

59
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,432
when things are not going so well when you think maybe I should have been a

60
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:04,932
mailman.

61
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:15,840
You know when you're stuck on that problem, you can look back to the session and look at these rules and say maybe one of these rules will help me now I didn't see the use of it there GDC, but now I can use this and this actually happened to be recently

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:25,708
I'm working on my game the church in the darkness. I was building a level for a long time for a new demo for GDC and it was actually due to some life issues and other things became

63
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:34,374
like a really dark place for me creatively and building this and a lot of it because the level looked like this for a long time it lacked any show we say pizzazz

64
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:38,777
Later, as I was getting towards the end of making the demo, it started looking like this.

65
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:42,399
I started adding in all of these things, and this is taking a scene where I just stubbed in,

66
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:47,342
here's some cages for this cult group, you know, and it doesn't really look very cool at all.

67
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:50,304
But now, you know, I've put in a guy and he's shooting a pig's head on the side,

68
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:54,006
and you can interact with him, and different versions of this scene play out.

69
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:56,407
This is all very cool, and I did it in about an hour, right at the end,

70
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:59,829
and suddenly the level was fun to play now, and I no longer dreaded working on this thing.

71
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,712
And I think, why didn't I do this earlier?

72
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:05,254
If only someone had told me I should think about Pizazz.

73
00:04:05,254 --> 00:04:07,096
Well, last year at this very session,

74
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:10,339
Lee Perry did a talk called Pizazz First, Polish Later,

75
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:13,382
where he talked about that dark trough of game development

76
00:04:13,382 --> 00:04:14,423
where everything is bad.

77
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:16,726
And he talked about, particularly on solo projects,

78
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:19,248
you can lose your momentum, lose your focus.

79
00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:20,589
But if you add some Pizazz earlier,

80
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,392
you get motivated again, you get feeling good.

81
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:24,493
So think about it that way.

82
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:25,954
I should be aware of this talk,

83
00:04:25,954 --> 00:04:29,137
because it was in this session that I ran last year too,

84
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:30,197
but I'd forgotten about it.

85
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:32,419
So when you're in those moments of darkness and despair,

86
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:33,380
look back to this session,

87
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,722
see if one of these things can inspire you

88
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:38,764
to keep going on your project, even in those dark days.

89
00:04:38,764 --> 00:04:40,086
The other thing to think about

90
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:43,368
with these rules as you hear them.

91
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:47,815
is the theme that emerged.

92
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:49,756
I don't usually give the speakers a theme for these.

93
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,896
I just let them come up with their own rules.

94
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:53,417
But some sort of theme emerged this year.

95
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:57,237
And that theme is everything you know is wrong, which

96
00:04:57,237 --> 00:04:59,418
seems kind of timely to 2017.

97
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:02,239
But our speakers today are going to challenge

98
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:05,159
some common assumptions you may have about how to make games

99
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:06,040
and how to design them.

100
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,105
And it kind of makes sense too that I think as game designers,

101
00:05:10,105 --> 00:05:14,151
we got into this medium, we got into doing this instead of going for some safe career,

102
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:15,433
some more profitable career, right?

103
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,375
We decided, no, I want to do this thing I love.

104
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:21,141
Even if our family thought it was crazy, we decided, hey, we're going to go make video games.

105
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:25,156
And as you're in this industry for a long time, you'll hear a lot of

106
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:28,457
you know, commonly held wisdom about what you should do and what you shouldn't do.

107
00:05:28,457 --> 00:05:31,918
If you're here even longer, you'll see all those things disproven over time.

108
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,839
So for example, you may have heard the old chestnut,

109
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,960
you should never make a game that requires a peripheral

110
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,241
until someone makes one that breaks that rule.

111
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:43,202
You should certainly never make a Western game because those never sell

112
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:46,563
until one does, and adventure games are dead.

113
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:52,107
Or it goes even farther into sort of game design rules like everyone online is an asshole.

114
00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:56,752
That's why we should only make shooters until someone figures out you can subvert that.

115
00:05:56,752 --> 00:05:58,734
Or that players only want to win.

116
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,035
They want everything explained to them.

117
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:01,857
They don't want to have to work hard to do anything.

118
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:05,681
Or the most dreaded of all, well that doesn't sound like very much fun.

119
00:06:08,146 --> 00:06:12,829
So it's in breaking these rules that I think we can, you know, go off and make some of

120
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:13,349
these new things.

121
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:17,052
So as you hear these things, realize again, they're not absolute, they apply in different

122
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:18,453
times, but they can also help you.

123
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:22,736
And I think these are the type of rules in saying that everything you know is wrong,

124
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:26,338
you know, go with that, that a good rule doesn't close down possibilities, it really opens

125
00:06:26,338 --> 00:06:29,520
them up and helps you think of things in a different framing.

126
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:42,691
So with that our theme everything you know is wrong. We're going to have 5 speakers get up here talk for 10 minutes each as I said. Coming up a little later we're going to have Damian Schubert is going to remind us who our true player base really is.

127
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:52,140
Christina Norman is going to show you how your assumptions about what you need out of a feature may be entirely wrong. Hal Barwood is going to suggest that maybe the way we do rules is wrong.

128
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:57,565
And finally Luke Muscat is going to question the very existence of well you'll just have to wait for his.

129
00:06:58,445 --> 00:07:02,709
But first, Chelsea Howe is going to tell you

130
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:05,632
maybe you've been doing things to the wrong sort of scale.

131
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:07,213
She is a designer who's worked on everything

132
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:10,035
from Family Guy to Farmville to indie projects

133
00:07:10,035 --> 00:07:11,777
and is now the creative producteur

134
00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:13,939
and OWL overseer at Owlchemy Labs.

135
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:14,859
I give you Chelsea Howe.

136
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:15,880
All right, sweet.

137
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:31,116
So my rule is designed by Fractal.

138
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:31,556
Why Fractals?

139
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:34,136
Our human brains are hardwired to find patterns.

140
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:36,457
They help us cluster and predict the constant flow

141
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,597
of information streaming into our brains,

142
00:07:38,597 --> 00:07:41,638
which lets us survive and act and optimize our performance

143
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:42,898
in an otherwise overwhelming world.

144
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:45,699
Now, some patterns are really easy to see.

145
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,839
Songs have choruses versus bridges.

146
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,200
Novels have three-act structures, heroes journeys,

147
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,040
politics ebb and flow, conservative to liberal,

148
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,560
and back again.

149
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:56,550
But games aren't simple nor linear entities.

150
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,791
They're these really vast and complex systems,

151
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,911
multifaceted and multilayered.

152
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:02,872
Even games with the simplest underpinnings

153
00:08:02,872 --> 00:08:05,193
can have these vast and unpredictable results.

154
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:05,953
And that's the beauty of fractals too.

155
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:10,294
Fractals are these patterns that exist across scale

156
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:12,155
that describe infinite systems.

157
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:15,196
The defining property of a fractal is that it is self-similar

158
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:17,817
which means you can see the same basic shapes and patterns

159
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:19,938
no matter how far you zoom in and out,

160
00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:22,438
in or out, and often when you translate your view as well.

161
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:25,525
And all of that infinite complexity

162
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:28,027
comes from one tiny little set of variables.

163
00:08:28,027 --> 00:08:29,228
All fractals have at their heart

164
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:30,509
some sort of equation or algorithm

165
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,290
that defines that repeating pattern.

166
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,112
This one is for the Mandelbrot set.

167
00:08:34,112 --> 00:08:37,174
That single algorithm feeds back in on itself,

168
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:41,017
multiplying outward, downward, upward.

169
00:08:41,017 --> 00:08:43,599
With just one underlying and foundational set of variables,

170
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,762
an infinite and beautifully resonant pattern emerges.

171
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:49,424
And ultimately, that's exactly what we want with our games.

172
00:08:49,424 --> 00:08:50,545
We want coherent design

173
00:08:50,545 --> 00:08:52,406
across massive interrelated systems.

174
00:08:53,538 --> 00:08:55,278
This means that your vision as a designer

175
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:57,499
needs to be like that algorithm.

176
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:59,019
We use a bunch of different words for this,

177
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:00,960
whether it's your vision statement, x statement,

178
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,820
one-liner, but at its heart, it's the aggregate of values

179
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,821
from which the rest of your game can be derived.

180
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:08,722
Now as designers, we usually tend to go a little bit deeper.

181
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:11,782
We have these pillars, usually we call them,

182
00:09:11,782 --> 00:09:12,983
and those are the variables.

183
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:15,164
Now the clearer those pillars are,

184
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:17,685
the better we empower our teams to bring the game to life

185
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:19,285
at whatever scale they're working at.

186
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:22,206
If your team can really grok this basic algorithm,

187
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:25,687
they can generate code, content, and be creative

188
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:27,428
without designers always looping over them.

189
00:09:27,428 --> 00:09:29,588
So that's the general gist,

190
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:31,269
and I wanna show you a few examples

191
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:32,629
of how I've put that into practice.

192
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,691
The first is in terms of thinking about teaching mechanics to players.

193
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:39,312
They really help when conveying information.

194
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,352
A dominant learning paradigm is called scaffolding,

195
00:09:41,352 --> 00:09:43,813
where you teach a small concept, practice it until mastery,

196
00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:46,454
and then build off of that at higher and higher levels.

197
00:09:46,454 --> 00:09:47,694
These are essentially learning fractals.

198
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:52,016
We did this a lot in Family Guy, where we started by teaching about items.

199
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:54,477
Then we talked about characters who need multiple items.

200
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:57,097
Then we introduced them to districts which have multiple characters,

201
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,158
and finally the overarching storyline, which contains several districts.

202
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:03,530
We started at that most basic level of our fractal

203
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,071
and zoomed out over time.

204
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,913
Fractals are also really good at creating player emotion.

205
00:10:07,913 --> 00:10:10,635
There's something really magical that happens

206
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:12,616
when you feel that order of magnitude change.

207
00:10:12,616 --> 00:10:15,618
Your possibility space suddenly opens up and cracks open.

208
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:17,459
It's this wonderful sublime feeling.

209
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,161
And we can use that scale shift

210
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,043
to evoke more complex feelings in our players.

211
00:10:23,043 --> 00:10:26,005
One game jam we made this incredibly simple game

212
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:28,587
where you fly up into hovering water in the sky.

213
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:33,191
As you go up that water, the clouds kind of fade out,

214
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:35,713
and you wind up on the very beach that you started on.

215
00:10:35,713 --> 00:10:37,914
This was an incredibly simple game,

216
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:40,575
and most of the Let's players weren't super intrigued

217
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:40,896
initially.

218
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:43,697
When they got to this point, we saw this deep emotional

219
00:10:43,697 --> 00:10:44,738
response.

220
00:10:44,738 --> 00:10:47,820
We realized that, or we saw them realize

221
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,201
that this was a repeating pattern,

222
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:51,462
that the whole world was this Mobius loop, this fractal.

223
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:54,884
And you can also do it to create stakeholder emotions.

224
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:56,325
When you're pitching something to someone,

225
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:58,346
you want them to have those mind-blowing moments.

226
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:02,957
Again, here's a simplified version of a little prototype that we worked on.

227
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:04,579
This was called CityStream.

228
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:10,524
So essentially in CityStream, every person in a Twitch chat is represented on the world.

229
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:11,245
It's a city builder.

230
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:13,406
You're building up this one little tower.

231
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:17,167
and then you're building up the towers around it.

232
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:20,470
And then you learn that each of those towers is specialized.

233
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,992
And then you learn that all of those towers are at risk

234
00:11:22,992 --> 00:11:25,234
by these massive influxes of enemies.

235
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:28,336
And then you realize that your city is just one of many

236
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:30,718
and every streamer on Twitch actually has access

237
00:11:30,718 --> 00:11:32,099
to their own little world,

238
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:34,301
which again can battle and destroy other cities.

239
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:37,263
So we worked on this fractal of building and maintaining

240
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,785
and we tried to see how far we could scale it up.

241
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:42,893
When you want pitch, you want to blow people's minds.

242
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:44,134
And designing with fractals means

243
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:45,554
asking what your game would look like

244
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:46,795
if you zoomed out even further,

245
00:11:46,795 --> 00:11:49,535
if you ramped it up another order of magnitude,

246
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:51,116
or if you translated your design

247
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:53,076
into some space where it hasn't been done before.

248
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:53,836
Fractals are also really useful

249
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:55,717
for understanding player engagement.

250
00:11:55,717 --> 00:11:58,858
I use fractals for virtually any element

251
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:01,379
that can hold a player's attention,

252
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:04,259
whether that's narrative, difficulty curve,

253
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:05,440
level unlocks, marketing.

254
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:09,884
A narrative fractal might start with a single line of dialogue

255
00:12:09,884 --> 00:12:12,484
or flavor text, zoom out to conversations, quests,

256
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:15,565
story arcs, and eventually that entire hero's journey.

257
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:19,146
So when you're working on a different area of your game

258
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:21,967
and you want to test your concept for completeness,

259
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:22,947
go ahead and look at those different scales.

260
00:12:22,947 --> 00:12:25,768
Fractals are also really useful for communicating design.

261
00:12:25,768 --> 00:12:29,229
And a lot of us are really familiar with this already.

262
00:12:29,229 --> 00:12:32,349
You have the one-liner, the elevator pitch, the concept

263
00:12:32,349 --> 00:12:34,030
deck, all the way up to the systems doc

264
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,830
or that often lamented design bible.

265
00:12:36,805 --> 00:12:38,366
Thinking of them all as the same basic entity,

266
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:39,826
just at different scales,

267
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,608
helps me keep the ideas consistent throughout.

268
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:44,669
And realizing that different people on my team

269
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:45,789
work at different scales,

270
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:47,310
helps me give them the documentation

271
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,391
that's going to be most beneficial.

272
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:52,193
A global exec team obviously doesn't need your design Bible.

273
00:12:52,193 --> 00:12:54,154
A technical artist isn't going to do much use

274
00:12:54,154 --> 00:12:54,774
with a one-liner.

275
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,835
I've also noticed that when some people design,

276
00:12:56,835 --> 00:12:58,977
they tend to have a default scale.

277
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:02,671
I tend to revert to a concept doc, for instance.

278
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:07,154
I think it's important to figure out what that default scale you're comfortable at is

279
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,635
and then practice scaling up or down.

280
00:13:08,635 --> 00:13:14,319
Fractals are useful for understanding other IP as well, not just communicating your own.

281
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:18,943
If you're aware of patterns across scale, you can identify the keystones of other franchises.

282
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,707
I've designed for a bunch of different licensors and a bunch of different IPs, and unlike a

283
00:13:23,707 --> 00:13:25,570
lot of folks, I love that work.

284
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,596
There's something really special about seeing a pattern across a brand and being able to

285
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:31,839
vocalize it with a clarity that most people can't.

286
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:36,691
Once you've seen the consistent themes in a celebrity's Twitter feed or Instagram, interviews,

287
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,774
concerts, filmography, you start to understand how you could bring that over into a game,

288
00:13:40,774 --> 00:13:41,775
how to translate it.

289
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:45,077
And there's something really magical that happens when you go to a licensor and you're

290
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:47,839
able to articulate their core values in a meaningful way.

291
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,442
Core values are what makes us human, they're what we're most passionate about.

292
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:54,124
That's why we get so enraged about things like politics.

293
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:58,487
When you can tell someone, when you can echo back their core values to them, it creates

294
00:13:58,487 --> 00:14:01,569
the trust and bonding and faith that's really useful for external partnerships.

295
00:14:03,262 --> 00:14:06,323
Fractals are also really useful for understanding our future.

296
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:09,065
Once we can see the pattern, we can look back at where it's gone

297
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:12,127
and start predicting where it's going.

298
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:13,728
When my UX designer and I were concepting

299
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:17,550
one of our unannounced games, we found this really interesting

300
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:17,991
trend.

301
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,112
We saw that despite mobile gamers always complaining

302
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:22,874
about lack of real gameplay, they would almost always

303
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:25,055
use an Automate button if it was offered to them.

304
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:27,513
We also saw the rise of idle games

305
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:29,234
becoming increasingly popular.

306
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:30,935
And we kind of put these things together

307
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:32,396
and realized that games for the most part

308
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:34,297
are switching away from immediate moment

309
00:14:34,297 --> 00:14:36,399
to moment, at least in the free to play category

310
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,140
that we cared about, to more of this metagame level

311
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,081
of strategy.

312
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:43,103
We essentially looked over and saw the trend somewhere

313
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:46,525
and put it into our different genre.

314
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:47,585
A bunch of other teams had also been working

315
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:50,647
on getting their concepts greenlight,

316
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:51,388
some for over a year.

317
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:55,690
Our design was greenlit in less than two months.

318
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,520
And finally, fractals help us understand the world.

319
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,401
A team is a small, small microcosm of society.

320
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:06,843
Every team has its own quirks and its own dynamics,

321
00:15:06,843 --> 00:15:10,684
but it will always in some way reflect bigger issues.

322
00:15:10,684 --> 00:15:12,345
When small things happen in your team,

323
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,506
don't let them slide.

324
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:15,467
Don't accept them as part of a bigger pattern.

325
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:18,308
Because change at any scale affects the others.

326
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:20,829
One simple correction can make all the difference.

327
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:22,190
When we think in fractals,

328
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,971
we're no longer helpless individuals.

329
00:15:23,971 --> 00:15:25,011
We're simply at a different scale

330
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,232
and we can create vast change.

331
00:15:26,232 --> 00:15:26,452
Thank you.

332
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,632
Thank you, Chelsea.

333
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:41,175
You know, a great, great way to start

334
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:44,462
thinking of reframing your problems, which we will come

335
00:15:44,462 --> 00:15:46,285
back to a little bit later in the session.

336
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:46,626
But up next.

337
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:54,734
You may know Damian from his many years of working in the MMO space, culminating as being lead designer on Star Wars The Old Republic.

338
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:57,716
He now works on the mobile RPG Dungeon Boss.

339
00:15:57,716 --> 00:16:05,041
And some years ago back, some years back Damian gave a somewhat famous design talk on how you were doing your design documents wrong.

340
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,043
And now he's going to tell you how you're thinking about your player base wrong.

341
00:16:08,043 --> 00:16:08,703
Damian Schubert.

342
00:16:18,397 --> 00:16:22,664
Free is the default.

343
00:16:22,664 --> 00:16:24,386
I now make free-to-play games.

344
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:26,770
I've made free-to-play games that have made

345
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,314
hundreds of millions of dollars.

346
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:31,358
I haven't actually gotten much for that.

347
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:36,504
But the thing that I have actually done that has been most important is to never lose sight

348
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:42,048
of the fact that most of the players playing them aren't giving me any money.

349
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:44,530
This is really, really important.

350
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:50,254
Now when we talk about free plays, it's really natural to think about how to make money.

351
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:51,094
I mean, it's...

352
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:55,576
why our bosses give us paychecks and we would really like to pay the rent and we

353
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:58,237
would really like to have a nice cars and things like that

354
00:16:58,237 --> 00:17:02,879
uh... and that's completely reasonable but there's a whole other track

355
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,061
at this conference i believe on how to make money from games i want to talk

356
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:08,602
about the other half of that

357
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:10,062
which is the fact that

358
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:14,524
we really need to spend more time thinking about the free players

359
00:17:14,524 --> 00:17:18,486
i look long and hard for publicly available data and uh... most commonly

360
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:20,426
cited number is this number which is

361
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:27,091
Back in the heyday of Zynga, they would say that a 2% conversion rate for any game that

362
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:29,733
they made was a blockbuster success.

363
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:35,578
That means that of everybody who downloaded Mafia Wars or one of those games, if they

364
00:17:35,578 --> 00:17:38,840
got a 2% conversion rate, great success!

365
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:43,249
and that means that 98% of those players never spend a dime.

366
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:46,152
Now that number is slightly weighted.

367
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:50,176
Really the numbers look more like this when you look at the day-to-day-to-day,

368
00:17:50,176 --> 00:17:53,299
because if you spend, you're more likely to come back.

369
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:54,761
So any given day...

370
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:59,365
10%-ish of your population has spent money.

371
00:17:59,365 --> 00:18:04,909
That still means that 90% of your players are freeloaders.

372
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:05,289
Right?

373
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:06,830
That's a big deal.

374
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,753
Most of your players are playing for free.

375
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:12,875
That is the normal gameplay mode of your game.

376
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,717
That is the default for your game.

377
00:18:15,717 --> 00:18:19,420
For most people, free means exactly that.

378
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,042
They download your game, they play the game,

379
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:24,684
and they do it all intending to never spend a dime.

380
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:28,000
For many of them, that's the point,

381
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,860
even if they love the game.

382
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,081
Now, today's kids have so many options

383
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:34,381
that they no longer have to worry

384
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:36,702
about getting mom's credit card in order to play something.

385
00:18:36,702 --> 00:18:38,142
There's so many free-to-play games

386
00:18:38,142 --> 00:18:40,142
as well as free music, free movies,

387
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:42,563
any entertainment medium you can think of,

388
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:44,463
they can get a whole bunch of it for free.

389
00:18:44,463 --> 00:18:45,303
That's your competition.

390
00:18:45,303 --> 00:18:49,304
And some people see playing for free as a badge of honor.

391
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:51,865
How many people in this room played Candy Crush

392
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:53,965
as far as they could for free

393
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:55,686
just to prove that they friggin' could?

394
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:58,488
So what does that mean for us designers?

395
00:18:58,488 --> 00:19:04,472
What does it mean for those of us who are like me?

396
00:19:04,472 --> 00:19:09,396
I make free-to-play games because I am a massive hippie

397
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:13,539
and I like the idea of giving the gift of gameplay away

398
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:15,620
to as many people as possible.

399
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,903
To me, that is exactly a beautiful notion,

400
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:21,184
a big socialist notion,

401
00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:23,286
and yeah, if a handful of heavy spenders have to pay for that,

402
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:25,067
I'll live with that.

403
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:27,603
But what does this mean for those of us

404
00:19:27,603 --> 00:19:29,844
who are battling evil project managers' intent

405
00:19:29,844 --> 00:19:31,485
on picking up our customers

406
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:33,506
and shaking them for loose change?

407
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,867
Well, it really means keeping in mind

408
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:37,888
that most of your players will never spin.

409
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:40,749
Remember that 2% number we talked about before?

410
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:43,330
Let's imagine you're an amazing monetization designer.

411
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,071
Let's imagine that you manage to double that.

412
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:48,232
That's what that looks like.

413
00:19:49,098 --> 00:19:56,307
Right? Now 4% of your population is paying you money and 96% of your population is still playing for free.

414
00:19:56,307 --> 00:19:57,709
That's normal.

415
00:19:57,709 --> 00:20:03,896
Keep that in mind. Keep that in focus and really think about how that frames not only how you design your game,

416
00:20:03,896 --> 00:20:07,861
but how you develop your game and how you support that game in live.

417
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:07,941
So...

418
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:12,157
Free players are not just freeloading.

419
00:20:12,157 --> 00:20:15,758
So they do all sorts of good things for the game in general

420
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:17,678
and for the game that your spinners are playing.

421
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:20,419
For one thing, the free players are the source

422
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,419
of the virality of the game.

423
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:24,040
Free players are going to be the reason

424
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,000
you go to the top of the charts.

425
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,240
They're going to be the reason

426
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,980
you become a cultural phenomenon.

427
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,081
Free players provide rivals.

428
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:33,762
They provide people for your spinners to beat up on

429
00:20:33,762 --> 00:20:35,602
as well as for each other to beat up on.

430
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:40,217
Free players can create content for other players to play.

431
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:42,719
Like in Second Life, you could actually create content

432
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:45,201
and upload them for other people to play with.

433
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:48,043
They actually do your job for you.

434
00:20:48,043 --> 00:20:51,586
In Star Wars, The Old Republic, the free players provided,

435
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:54,008
we had a real problem before we went free to play.

436
00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:56,069
When our game stalled, we didn't have enough people

437
00:20:56,069 --> 00:21:00,212
to run dungeons, to launch battlegrounds and fire raids.

438
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:03,395
Free players provided a population of people

439
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,036
so that those things could actually happen.

440
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:11,784
Free players provide a whole lot of cannon fodder for your spinners to beat up on.

441
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:14,825
And lastly, free players are very often the bedrock of the community.

442
00:21:14,825 --> 00:21:17,266
Like the, the, the, there's not necessarily a cross section between people who like to

443
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:21,227
spin and people who like to run message rewards, manage your Reddit threads and do all of this

444
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:23,728
other invaluable services that actually make your game an event, a thing, a place to be.

445
00:21:23,728 --> 00:21:24,328
So takeaway three.

446
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:26,529
And if you're a fan of the channel, be sure to subscribe.

447
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:27,650
And I'll see you in the next video.

448
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:27,890
Take care.

449
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:27,950
Bye.

450
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,010
Bye.

451
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:28,090
Bye.

452
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:28,290
Bye.

453
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:28,370
Bye.

454
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:28,510
Bye.

455
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:28,770
Bye.

456
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:28,850
Bye.

457
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:28,910
Bye.

458
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,010
Bye.

459
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,090
Bye.

460
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:29,210
Bye.

461
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:29,350
Bye.

462
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,490
Bye.

463
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:29,590
Bye.

464
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:29,711
Bye.

465
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:29,771
Bye.

466
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:29,851
Bye.

467
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:29,931
Bye.

468
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:30,131
Bye.

469
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:30,271
Bye.

470
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:30,371
Bye.

471
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:30,451
Bye.

472
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:30,551
Bye.

473
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:30,611
Bye.

474
00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:30,671
Bye.

475
00:21:35,622 --> 00:21:40,987
Please, for the love of God, if free-to-play is normal in your game, and it probably is

476
00:21:40,987 --> 00:21:45,652
if you're making a game that's called free-to-play, treat it like it's normal.

477
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,642
It's really easy and it's really seductive to give all of your employees free money.

478
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:57,185
And you might want to do that from time to time, but every now and then you have to force them to play like a free player.

479
00:21:57,185 --> 00:22:00,667
You have to force them to actually play with the crappy heroes.

480
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:06,910
You have to force them to actually hit all the pop-ups that free players hit when they actually log into the game.

481
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,452
And you have to force them to wipe their accounts and do it again every now and then.

482
00:22:10,452 --> 00:22:16,375
Because we have this tendency to layer on more stuff in our games and it always hits the free players the worst.

483
00:22:16,895 --> 00:22:22,063
you guys need to really focus on being sure that your designers and your QA departments in general

484
00:22:22,063 --> 00:22:25,368
realize that free play is the default way to play this game.

485
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:34,247
And watch the paywalls.

486
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:38,712
A paywall is when designers put in a big cliff in the game

487
00:22:38,712 --> 00:22:42,236
design that's designed to make people either spend money or

488
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,600
seek some kind of free alternative, usually wait a day

489
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,204
or grind some levels or do something that in order to

490
00:22:49,204 --> 00:22:50,025
prompt some spending.

491
00:22:50,585 --> 00:22:56,088
The most common problem I have seen in most of the mobile games that I have downloaded

492
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:58,829
is that they put too harsh paywalls too early.

493
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:02,671
They go up before players have a chance to fall in love with the game.

494
00:23:02,671 --> 00:23:06,133
When this happens, your brain actually extrapolates that pattern.

495
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:09,634
If you ask me for money at 5 minutes and 10 minutes, I'm going to assume it's going to

496
00:23:09,634 --> 00:23:14,016
do it at 15, 20, 25, 30, so on and so forth, and I'm going to realize that your game is

497
00:23:14,016 --> 00:23:14,937
not free at all.

498
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:21,273
By contrast, one of the design battles I won when we converted Star Wars The Old Republic

499
00:23:21,273 --> 00:23:27,575
to free-to-play was to not have any paywalls or pretty much any spend opportunities at

500
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:29,516
all on the first planet of the game.

501
00:23:29,516 --> 00:23:31,397
That's three to four hours of gameplay.

502
00:23:31,397 --> 00:23:32,978
I had a really good reason for that.

503
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:38,720
When we were a premium game, we tested the bejesus out of that first planet to the degree

504
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,481
that the people running the test said that

505
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:48,783
our first planet was the single best testing MMO starting experience they had ever seen.

506
00:23:48,783 --> 00:23:49,904
Why fuck that up?

507
00:23:49,904 --> 00:23:51,204
Right?

508
00:23:51,204 --> 00:23:53,945
Instead, let them fall in love with the game.

509
00:23:53,945 --> 00:23:56,545
Give them a whole planet so that they want to spin,

510
00:23:56,545 --> 00:23:58,526
so that they want to help your developers out,

511
00:23:58,526 --> 00:24:00,707
so that they want to take the developer's side.

512
00:24:04,238 --> 00:24:07,945
Remember how I said free-to-play players are good cannon fodder for big spinners?

513
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:10,169
You have to be real careful with that.

514
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:12,233
I mean it's not fun to get stomped.

515
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:16,040
Now I'm not saying that free players should always be paired with other free players.

516
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:21,878
But it's really important that if you have a PvP experience

517
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,959
that you're giving them people that are just out of reach.

518
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:26,699
That you're giving them something where maybe

519
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,460
if they spent a little or if they invested

520
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,641
a little more time or got a little more free gems

521
00:24:30,641 --> 00:24:32,801
that they would be able to beat that stuff.

522
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:35,302
You don't want people to run into a wall

523
00:24:35,302 --> 00:24:38,443
and say that the only way it could possibly compete

524
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:38,883
is to drop $1,000.

525
00:24:38,883 --> 00:24:41,904
Or you will drive them out of those game systems

526
00:24:41,904 --> 00:24:44,005
if you don't drive them out of the game altogether.

527
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:49,562
In Dungeon Boss, the characters in our gem portal

528
00:24:49,562 --> 00:24:52,104
are much more powerful than the free players.

529
00:24:52,104 --> 00:24:55,806
And people who have spent them at a much easier time

530
00:24:55,806 --> 00:24:56,907
actually winning in PvP.

531
00:24:56,907 --> 00:24:58,568
This was a harsh lesson for us,

532
00:24:58,568 --> 00:25:00,109
that we really had to spend a lot of time

533
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:03,291
massaging our matchmaking in order to bring that in line.

534
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:06,053
Yeah, David beat Goliath, but this is a great story,

535
00:25:06,053 --> 00:25:12,457
largely because of how improbable it actually was.

536
00:25:12,457 --> 00:25:13,858
Most of the time,

537
00:25:14,462 --> 00:25:18,284
Goliath stomps David and David throws his iPad across the room.

538
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:18,985
And then the last point is this.

539
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:25,109
If you take all this together and you say, yeah, we really do need to get our free players

540
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:31,953
to spend, be sure that they have a fun time, be sure that it's not too obnoxious, and then

541
00:25:31,953 --> 00:25:37,097
try to hint at them that spending just a little is going to have a big impact.

542
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,935
Don't try to make them whales from day one.

543
00:25:43,935 --> 00:25:45,777
Try to get them to spend one dollar.

544
00:25:46,702 --> 00:25:49,623
make that first dollar really really an amazing value for them.

545
00:25:49,623 --> 00:25:53,044
Give them glimpses of what spending that first dollar is going to be like

546
00:25:53,044 --> 00:25:57,065
and then once you do, try to stair-step them up gradually.

547
00:25:57,065 --> 00:26:01,045
Now it's always going to be the case inside of free-to-play that the heavy

548
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:04,006
spenders are going to do the heavy lifting in terms of supporting the

549
00:26:04,006 --> 00:26:07,107
gameplay. That is either a fortunate or unfortunate

550
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,848
way of life for the free-to-play market right now, depending on your point of view.

551
00:26:11,768 --> 00:26:14,832
But at the same time, we have to keep in mind that most people

552
00:26:14,832 --> 00:26:15,393
aren't that.

553
00:26:15,393 --> 00:26:18,376
Most of our player base are free players,

554
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,679
and they still add enormous value to the game.

555
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:21,420
That's fine, and get used to it.

556
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,401
In conclusion, free players are the normal ones.

557
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:22,882
Design your game as such.

558
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:23,503
Thank you very much.

559
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:39,798
Thank you, Damien.

560
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,162
I think those of us not working on free-to-play games

561
00:26:42,162 --> 00:26:43,845
can think of this too as a way of addressing

562
00:26:43,845 --> 00:26:44,806
your player base.

563
00:26:44,806 --> 00:26:46,529
You know, thinking, are we spending too much time

564
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:47,931
on the people who've been playing for 30 hours

565
00:26:47,931 --> 00:26:49,674
and not enough on most of the players

566
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:50,736
who aren't gonna get that far?

567
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,897
I think you can easily easily extrapolate this to other types of games.

568
00:26:53,897 --> 00:26:57,179
Next up, we have Christina Norman.

569
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:00,801
She was a programmer and then a designer at Bioware on the Mass Effect series

570
00:27:00,801 --> 00:27:04,742
and now works on that little other free to play game League of Legends.

571
00:27:04,742 --> 00:27:07,744
And she's here to say the problem you think you have,

572
00:27:07,744 --> 00:27:09,885
well, maybe it's not actually a problem at all.

573
00:27:09,885 --> 00:27:11,566
I give you Christina Norman.

574
00:27:11,566 --> 00:27:11,786
Hello, hello.

575
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:26,733
So today I want to convince you guys to willingly embrace radical constraints.

576
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,470
Now, designers generally hate constraints.

577
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,191
We look at constraints as restrictions on what we can do.

578
00:27:34,191 --> 00:27:35,892
And who wants to be restricted?

579
00:27:35,892 --> 00:27:38,454
We want to do whatever we want to do.

580
00:27:38,454 --> 00:27:43,216
But constraints can also really help us focus our creativity.

581
00:27:43,216 --> 00:27:45,417
I think we all have stories of situations

582
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:48,099
where we've been working under the absolutely harshest

583
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,900
restrictions, and we've done incredible things.

584
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,982
Constraints can really inspire us to solve hard problems

585
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:57,664
and innovate as designers when we accept them.

586
00:27:58,732 --> 00:28:02,575
So I'm gonna take you through three constraint scenarios

587
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:05,177
and I'm gonna introduce a constraints framework to you

588
00:28:05,177 --> 00:28:09,160
and show you how I solve two impossible problems solving it.

589
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,642
Whoops.

590
00:28:11,642 --> 00:28:13,944
And, ah, why is Shepard a panda?

591
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:14,464
Wait a second.

592
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,864
Okay, we got this.

593
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:19,679
There we go.

594
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,500
And I will be using industry standard three panda notation,

595
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,421
which I believe originated at NYU,

596
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:29,462
to indicate how the team felt through all of this,

597
00:28:29,462 --> 00:28:32,423
because changing constraints can be really stressful.

598
00:28:32,423 --> 00:28:35,244
So throughout this, when you see a happy panda,

599
00:28:35,244 --> 00:28:38,264
that's a developer who is working contentedly

600
00:28:38,264 --> 00:28:39,185
within constraints.

601
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:42,385
When you see a sad panda, that's a developer

602
00:28:42,385 --> 00:28:45,106
who is feeling frustrated and restricted by constraints.

603
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:48,026
And when you see a sneaky panda, that's

604
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:51,027
a developer who is ignoring constraints to solve problems.

605
00:28:51,027 --> 00:28:55,747
And the size of the panda indicates the level of impact.

606
00:28:55,747 --> 00:29:00,048
So let's start off by going through the story of Mass

607
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:00,968
Effect 1.

608
00:29:00,968 --> 00:29:04,549
Now, Mass Effect 1 started like all possible games

609
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:06,749
with a blank slate.

610
00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:08,650
It really could have been anything.

611
00:29:09,452 --> 00:29:12,714
For example, we could have made it a pure dating sim.

612
00:29:12,714 --> 00:29:15,036
And there's probably an alternate universe out there

613
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:18,278
where we did that, and it's probably a pretty cool universe.

614
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:22,981
But we wanted to focus on other aspects as well.

615
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:26,964
So we wanted it to be a epic space opera RPG

616
00:29:26,964 --> 00:29:29,446
in which you could explore the galaxy,

617
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:32,608
save the universe, command an elite squad of superheroes,

618
00:29:32,608 --> 00:29:33,989
you know, pretty basic stuff.

619
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:34,309
And...

620
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:41,675
We had a schedule and a budget, so as we went through that initial concepting phase,

621
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:43,476
we realized we had to get specific.

622
00:29:43,476 --> 00:29:48,099
So we fleshed out the plot, we figured out who the characters were going to be,

623
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:53,643
we identified the RPG rules, we figured out key systems for conversations and gameplay

624
00:29:53,643 --> 00:29:56,966
that would make the game really great, and we made some tough calls.

625
00:29:57,871 --> 00:30:01,435
Then we prototype key systems, verifying that they were both

626
00:30:01,435 --> 00:30:03,338
possible and valuable.

627
00:30:03,338 --> 00:30:05,961
It was becoming more and more clear to us as a team what

628
00:30:05,961 --> 00:30:08,124
Mass Effect would be and what it wouldn't be.

629
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:13,376
Then E3 happened and we had to show Mass Effect to the world.

630
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:16,077
So we developed this vertical slice

631
00:30:16,077 --> 00:30:18,258
that would capture all the key experiences

632
00:30:18,258 --> 00:30:19,999
that players would have in Mass Effect,

633
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:23,181
like explorations, cinematic conversations,

634
00:30:23,181 --> 00:30:25,102
and intense squad combat.

635
00:30:25,102 --> 00:30:28,223
This was really hard, but the team gave it their all.

636
00:30:28,223 --> 00:30:30,685
And overall, we were really happy with the results

637
00:30:30,685 --> 00:30:31,945
and players were excited.

638
00:30:33,361 --> 00:30:40,045
But then as we set out to realize this vision across the entire game, we encountered huge problems executing at scale.

639
00:30:40,045 --> 00:30:45,548
Like most developers, our E3 demo was visionary but it wasn't real.

640
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:49,270
And as we tried to create real experiences at a galactic scale...

641
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:55,098
we ran into horrendous technical problems with our engine, with our workflow.

642
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:57,021
They kept slowing us down.

643
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:02,148
And now for the first time as a team, we collectively felt we were being constrained in a way

644
00:31:02,148 --> 00:31:05,232
that was taking all of us away from the game we wanted it to be.

645
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:09,236
And then it got worse.

646
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:11,837
As we got closer and closer to our ship date,

647
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:14,698
we realized that we were not trending well.

648
00:31:14,698 --> 00:31:16,719
So we started cutting features.

649
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:20,120
We started cutting entire planets from the game.

650
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,861
We had to not just make new content,

651
00:31:22,861 --> 00:31:25,522
but we had to rebuild our existing content and systems

652
00:31:25,522 --> 00:31:27,142
to make them more efficient.

653
00:31:27,142 --> 00:31:28,803
All of this was slowing us down,

654
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,604
and we felt like Mass Effect was slipping away.

655
00:31:32,244 --> 00:31:36,891
So we crunched, because that solves all problems, right guys?

656
00:31:36,891 --> 00:31:40,355
Through force of will, talent, focus, and Red Bull,

657
00:31:40,355 --> 00:31:44,641
we dragged Mass Effect back closer to where we wanted it to be,

658
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:48,106
but the cost on the team was really, really high.

659
00:31:49,272 --> 00:31:51,353
But in the end, despite all this adversity,

660
00:31:51,353 --> 00:31:54,475
we shipped Mass Effect and it was awesome

661
00:31:54,475 --> 00:31:55,675
and players loved it.

662
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:59,257
It wasn't exactly what we'd wanted it to be.

663
00:31:59,257 --> 00:32:02,159
It's getting outside of that original space

664
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,439
we wanted it to be in,

665
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:05,640
but it was definitely a great game.

666
00:32:07,497 --> 00:32:10,999
And reflecting on that journey from Blank Slate to Mass Effect,

667
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:15,382
I started to see how constraints were a roadmap for our progress.

668
00:32:15,382 --> 00:32:20,366
And I started wondering if we could use them to help get the team

669
00:32:20,366 --> 00:32:22,647
pointed towards better games with fewer sad pandas.

670
00:32:22,647 --> 00:32:25,389
And we all wanted Mass Effect 2 to be a better game.

671
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:29,091
We wanted to fix all the problems with the first one.

672
00:32:29,091 --> 00:32:31,153
We wanted it to be refined.

673
00:32:31,153 --> 00:32:33,614
We wanted it to be polished.

674
00:32:33,614 --> 00:32:37,116
And we wanted the team to not be miserable, sad pandas.

675
00:32:38,578 --> 00:32:41,761
So when we started with that blank slate of Mass Effect 2,

676
00:32:41,761 --> 00:32:45,123
we knew that the first thing we had to do

677
00:32:45,123 --> 00:32:46,965
was figure out how we were gonna address

678
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,246
those problems from Mass Effect.

679
00:32:48,246 --> 00:32:52,009
And inventory was one of those top of mind problems.

680
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:53,390
For those of you who didn't play,

681
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,952
Mass Effect's inventory was slow, it was clunky,

682
00:32:55,952 --> 00:32:58,394
and you had to interact with it constantly.

683
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:02,898
It was universally disliked, so it was a clear must fix.

684
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:06,500
Thus, one of the constraints we established early on

685
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,422
was that we were gonna have a good inventory system.

686
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:13,424
And we designed a great inventory system,

687
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,866
but then what we found was,

688
00:33:15,866 --> 00:33:18,788
as we were rebuilding our UI pipeline

689
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:22,050
and finding that we had some programmers who quit

690
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:24,692
and we couldn't hire some other programmers,

691
00:33:24,692 --> 00:33:26,593
things were not trending well.

692
00:33:26,593 --> 00:33:29,335
It became clear that the inventory we wanted to build

693
00:33:29,335 --> 00:33:31,456
for Mass Effect 2 was not possible.

694
00:33:32,517 --> 00:33:35,182
So we designed a lower scope inventory, right?

695
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:37,506
But the problem was that wasn't possible either.

696
00:33:37,506 --> 00:33:40,532
Our UI problems were that bad.

697
00:33:40,532 --> 00:33:41,835
So we changed our approach.

698
00:33:43,182 --> 00:33:46,223
We designed a possible inventory system,

699
00:33:46,223 --> 00:33:50,105
but the problem now was it wasn't really very good,

700
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:51,966
and to make it possible,

701
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:54,407
we knew we'd have to cut some big things from the game.

702
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,988
And those things we were gonna have to cut

703
00:33:56,988 --> 00:33:58,329
were pretty awesome.

704
00:33:58,329 --> 00:33:59,990
This felt really bad,

705
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,191
and no one was happy with the situation.

706
00:34:03,191 --> 00:34:04,492
So then I had an idea.

707
00:34:04,492 --> 00:34:06,693
Why don't we just cut the inventory itself?

708
00:34:06,693 --> 00:34:09,515
It seemed like it was the source of all the problems.

709
00:34:10,651 --> 00:34:15,015
And I proposed this idea to the team and they were confused.

710
00:34:15,015 --> 00:34:19,478
Everyone knows Mass Effect was a Bioware RPG

711
00:34:19,478 --> 00:34:22,641
and Bioware RPGs have inventories

712
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:24,483
and wasn't the whole point to make sure

713
00:34:24,483 --> 00:34:25,964
that we had a good inventory?

714
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:27,185
Wasn't that what we were setting out to do

715
00:34:27,185 --> 00:34:28,366
in the first place?

716
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,802
So I reframed the problem and I said,

717
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:34,503
I don't think we really need a good inventory system.

718
00:34:34,503 --> 00:34:36,765
The problem was we had a bad one.

719
00:34:36,765 --> 00:34:38,946
So if we don't have a bad inventory,

720
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:41,428
haven't we really solved that original problem?

721
00:34:41,428 --> 00:34:44,089
I didn't convince the team at this point,

722
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:45,950
but I opened their minds up a bit

723
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,292
to see that maybe there'd be another way.

724
00:34:49,312 --> 00:34:50,473
But people were skeptical.

725
00:34:50,473 --> 00:34:53,936
What would Mass Effect even look like without an inventory?

726
00:34:53,936 --> 00:34:55,177
Would it even be an RPG?

727
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,698
Would it be fun?

728
00:34:56,698 --> 00:34:59,160
These were important questions to answer.

729
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,042
So the design team dug in really deep,

730
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:04,464
deconstructing why we needed an inventory

731
00:35:04,464 --> 00:35:05,604
in the first place,

732
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,626
and identifying the problems we'd have to solve

733
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:09,487
if we removed it.

734
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:12,990
One by one, we proposed solutions to those problems

735
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,691
and built confidence in the new direction

736
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:16,593
until we had buy-in from the team.

737
00:35:17,763 --> 00:35:20,946
And in the end, Mass Effect 2 didn't have an inventory,

738
00:35:20,946 --> 00:35:22,567
and it was a much better game.

739
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:24,749
By going out of our comfort zone,

740
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:26,871
we'd solved an impossible problem

741
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:29,073
and unlocked a new way of thinking about things

742
00:35:29,073 --> 00:35:31,035
that helped lead us to other changes

743
00:35:31,035 --> 00:35:34,318
that made Mass Effect more focused and polished.

744
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:38,335
And reflecting on that experience,

745
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:39,936
I wanted to generalize this.

746
00:35:39,936 --> 00:35:41,116
Like, was this just a fluke?

747
00:35:41,116 --> 00:35:44,218
Had we got lucky with a random idea?

748
00:35:44,218 --> 00:35:45,899
So I thought about the whole process

749
00:35:45,899 --> 00:35:48,160
and what had happened and tried to generalize it.

750
00:35:49,575 --> 00:35:53,177
So first, the thing I saw is that we had to identify

751
00:35:53,177 --> 00:35:55,078
that we had an impossible problem.

752
00:35:55,078 --> 00:35:58,159
Teams don't like to admit that things are impossible.

753
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,920
They don't like to acknowledge being blocked.

754
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,841
They wanna work harder and realize their original vision.

755
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:05,802
But when repeated attempts to solve problems

756
00:36:05,802 --> 00:36:07,783
creatively and analytically fail,

757
00:36:07,783 --> 00:36:09,604
it's important to acknowledge

758
00:36:09,604 --> 00:36:12,285
that you are not trending towards success.

759
00:36:12,285 --> 00:36:14,366
This helps open up the team's mind

760
00:36:14,366 --> 00:36:16,686
so they're willing to look at a different approach.

761
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:19,815
Then you need to ideate.

762
00:36:19,815 --> 00:36:22,038
Clearly, at this creative ideation stage,

763
00:36:22,038 --> 00:36:23,760
you must ignore constraints,

764
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,545
and you must not allow analysis to shoot down ideas.

765
00:36:27,545 --> 00:36:29,767
There are no buzzkill pandas at this zone.

766
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:34,786
Dangerous ideas must be allowed and even encouraged.

767
00:36:34,786 --> 00:36:38,688
But then, as you go into the reframing stage,

768
00:36:38,688 --> 00:36:41,789
you find a way to reframe those original constraints

769
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:44,451
in a way that allows your solution to be possible.

770
00:36:44,451 --> 00:36:48,052
And you identify all the issues that are going to come about

771
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:49,373
because there will be issues.

772
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,574
You probably had good reasons why those constraints

773
00:36:51,574 --> 00:36:52,814
were there in the first place.

774
00:36:53,695 --> 00:36:55,676
Then you have to solve those issues.

775
00:36:55,676 --> 00:36:58,398
One by one, you work through them.

776
00:36:58,398 --> 00:37:00,920
You prioritize and you solve quickly.

777
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,542
Your goal at this point is to determine

778
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:05,063
if this is a viable direction,

779
00:37:05,063 --> 00:37:06,624
to build buy-in from the team.

780
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,386
You are not building production code or content

781
00:37:09,386 --> 00:37:11,567
because you don't know if this is going to work out.

782
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:15,084
Then lastly, you reintegrate.

783
00:37:15,084 --> 00:37:19,608
This process must end with a cohesive, whole vision

784
00:37:19,608 --> 00:37:22,270
for where the product is going, and clear constraints

785
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,592
that the team can accept and work happily in.

786
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:27,574
That's how you end up with happy pandas working

787
00:37:27,574 --> 00:37:28,795
within new constraints.

788
00:37:28,795 --> 00:37:32,398
So this looked great on paper, but to figure out

789
00:37:32,398 --> 00:37:35,380
if this actually worked, I needed

790
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,162
to solve another impossible problem.

791
00:37:37,162 --> 00:37:39,744
But luckily, Game Dev, those happen every week.

792
00:37:41,268 --> 00:37:43,629
So when we moved into Mass Effect 3,

793
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:45,511
we knew we wanted to do something big.

794
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:48,173
Mass Effect 2 had been a really big success,

795
00:37:48,173 --> 00:37:49,794
so we wanted to do something big

796
00:37:49,794 --> 00:37:51,775
to make it more than Mass Effect 2.

797
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:54,437
And multiplayer was big.

798
00:37:54,437 --> 00:37:56,758
We'd actually always wanted to have multiplayer

799
00:37:56,758 --> 00:37:59,020
in Mass Effect, but we hadn't had the time

800
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,701
or resources to do it.

801
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:03,483
It was pretty scary to add this on in the third game,

802
00:38:03,483 --> 00:38:06,085
and the team was nervous, but they were also excited

803
00:38:06,085 --> 00:38:07,406
by this ambitious goal.

804
00:38:08,473 --> 00:38:09,954
So then we did some research,

805
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,774
and that research proved very troubling.

806
00:38:12,774 --> 00:38:15,075
All of our data and surveys said that multiplayer

807
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:16,835
was a winner-take-all market

808
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:19,256
that was dominated by big PvP games.

809
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:22,357
Even worse, when we surveyed Bioware players,

810
00:38:22,357 --> 00:38:25,237
we found out they had low engagement in multiplayer,

811
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:27,158
and they really weren't that excited

812
00:38:27,158 --> 00:38:28,978
by the idea of a multiplayer Mass Effect.

813
00:38:28,978 --> 00:38:30,699
Seriously, like, the most common response is,

814
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:32,759
can you just make more single-player levels, please?

815
00:38:34,222 --> 00:38:37,323
So to make successful high-quality multiplayer,

816
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:40,344
we knew we had to build a different kind of multiplayer,

817
00:38:40,344 --> 00:38:41,624
Bioware multiplayer.

818
00:38:41,624 --> 00:38:45,446
And that meant a co-op game that had everything

819
00:38:45,446 --> 00:38:47,126
that Bioware players love,

820
00:38:47,126 --> 00:38:51,268
like an exclusive multiplayer story,

821
00:38:51,268 --> 00:38:52,508
co-op level mechanics,

822
00:38:52,508 --> 00:38:55,709
and levels that you couldn't choose solo.

823
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,190
We needed new enemies, powers, and weapons,

824
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,671
content you could only access in multiplayer.

825
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:08,434
Plus, we needed social network integration, so recruiting your friends to play would be really easy.

826
00:39:08,434 --> 00:39:14,819
And this was basically the scope of an entirely new game, and it was a pretty cool concept for a game,

827
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:18,902
but it wasn't feasible Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.

828
00:39:18,902 --> 00:39:23,345
We were back with an impossible problem and a great chance to test the framework.

829
00:39:24,775 --> 00:39:31,624
So, first of all, we just had to acknowledge that the plan we had for multiplayer was not going to work.

830
00:39:31,624 --> 00:39:38,233
The scope was too high to ship, even though we had planned on dedicating a pretty sizable dedicated multiplayer team.

831
00:39:39,258 --> 00:39:42,401
Then we ideated to find an alternate approach.

832
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:46,826
And what we kind of landed on was our base assumption

833
00:39:46,826 --> 00:39:50,350
that players would not want to play Mass Effect multiplayer.

834
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:54,634
What if co-op plus Mass Effect's gameplay was super fun?

835
00:39:54,634 --> 00:39:56,797
How would that change the situation?

836
00:39:56,797 --> 00:40:00,621
Then we reframed our original constraints.

837
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:04,627
we would make a game with co-op Mass Effect gameplay

838
00:40:04,627 --> 00:40:06,547
that was really fun, and then we'd

839
00:40:06,547 --> 00:40:08,668
identify the problems we'd still need

840
00:40:08,668 --> 00:40:12,409
to solve to make it a great multiplayer for BioWare players.

841
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:15,670
Then we solved those problems.

842
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,311
First, we validated our original assumption

843
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:21,992
by doing a horde mode prototype of Mass Effect's multiplayer

844
00:40:21,992 --> 00:40:23,232
to verify it was fun.

845
00:40:24,165 --> 00:40:26,466
We improved it by adding on objectives,

846
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:29,067
limited powers, and a high difficulty.

847
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:31,808
Then we identified that we needed additional stickiness

848
00:40:31,808 --> 00:40:34,749
to keep players coming in and to entice them

849
00:40:34,749 --> 00:40:37,070
to come in in the first place.

850
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:40,531
So we fleshed out some pretty intense progression systems.

851
00:40:40,531 --> 00:40:44,473
And in the end, with a strong co-op horde mode demo

852
00:40:44,473 --> 00:40:48,354
that was really fun, and that updated vision,

853
00:40:48,354 --> 00:40:50,915
we got buy-in from the team and moved forward

854
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,436
with Mass Effect's multiplayer.

855
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:55,761
Now, about this time I actually left Bioware,

856
00:40:55,761 --> 00:40:59,685
but the multiplayer team took that prototype

857
00:40:59,685 --> 00:41:02,628
and they built it out to be Mass Effect 3's multiplayer

858
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:04,370
and they did an amazing job.

859
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:07,653
That same team has now gone on to build Andromeda

860
00:41:07,653 --> 00:41:09,535
and I cannot wait to check it out.

861
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:14,461
And just to be clear, we did what we set out to do.

862
00:41:14,461 --> 00:41:18,324
We made multiplayer that Bioware players wanted to play.

863
00:41:18,324 --> 00:41:21,026
In fact, they wanted to play it so much,

864
00:41:21,026 --> 00:41:23,007
they spent more time in multiplayer

865
00:41:23,007 --> 00:41:24,428
than they did in single player.

866
00:41:24,428 --> 00:41:29,431
For the third game in a primarily single player RPG franchise,

867
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:32,453
that was success beyond what we'd ever imagined.

868
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:38,003
So to kind of sum up, I really want to encourage you guys,

869
00:41:38,003 --> 00:41:41,765
when your teams get blocked, take a step back,

870
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,667
consider adjusting your approach

871
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,588
and embrace radical constraints.

872
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:46,048
Thank you.

873
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,419
Thank you, Christina.

874
00:41:57,419 --> 00:42:00,822
So moving on here to our next speaker.

875
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:04,525
Our next speaker is not Christina Norman.

876
00:42:05,386 --> 00:42:08,046
is Hal Barwood.

877
00:42:08,046 --> 00:42:10,307
He is somewhat special in that he's

878
00:42:10,307 --> 00:42:12,887
one of the main inspirations behind this session.

879
00:42:12,887 --> 00:42:16,048
Years ago, he worked on probably the most beloved Indiana Jones

880
00:42:16,048 --> 00:42:20,369
games of all time, and also was an illustrious game design

881
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:23,350
speaker at GDC for many years that inspired me

882
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,370
in my first years coming here, and actually worked

883
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:28,150
on a first framework of establishing rules for game

884
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,751
design called the 400 Project.

885
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:33,492
And he's here today to talk a little bit about that.

886
00:42:33,932 --> 00:42:36,734
and what went right and what went wrong with that,

887
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:37,655
and also some other stuff.

888
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:38,896
I give you Hal Barwood.

889
00:42:38,896 --> 00:42:39,056
Thanks.

890
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:39,196
Hi there.

891
00:42:39,196 --> 00:42:45,081
Let's look at some history.

892
00:42:54,113 --> 00:43:00,056
I delivered the first talk on game design rules at GDC 16 years ago in 2001.

893
00:43:00,056 --> 00:43:01,396
It was called For the 400.

894
00:43:01,396 --> 00:43:05,718
I had observed that most arts have a lot of rules,

895
00:43:05,718 --> 00:43:08,199
and the practitioners need them and use them

896
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:10,820
in order to be able to cope with the difficulties of their work.

897
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,682
But I also noticed that game designers did not seem to participate.

898
00:43:14,682 --> 00:43:16,503
And I wondered, why not?

899
00:43:17,468 --> 00:43:22,071
Well, were games just too new back then to have developed any rules?

900
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:26,013
Are we guided by formal principles instead, as some have advocated?

901
00:43:26,013 --> 00:43:29,595
Or is it just the libertarian streak in game designers that says,

902
00:43:29,595 --> 00:43:30,916
we don't need no stinking rules?

903
00:43:30,916 --> 00:43:33,897
Well, I thought that rules must exist.

904
00:43:33,897 --> 00:43:36,999
But I thought they were mostly unstated.

905
00:43:37,557 --> 00:43:41,099
They were intuitive, implicit, foggy, vague, and therefore,

906
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:41,900
very unreliable.

907
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,781
And I wanted to change that.

908
00:43:43,781 --> 00:43:46,683
And when I look back, I think I was on the right track.

909
00:43:46,683 --> 00:43:50,665
Because here we are, 16 years later, still identifying rules

910
00:43:50,665 --> 00:43:53,067
and advocating for their use.

911
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:55,989
Noah Falstein and I did a couple of follow-up talks at

912
00:43:55,989 --> 00:43:59,851
GDC, and we started the 400 Project, inviting developers

913
00:43:59,851 --> 00:44:02,553
to come to us with rules, which we would then publish up.

914
00:44:03,513 --> 00:44:09,878
We compiled and collected more than a hundred of these before we moved on to other things.

915
00:44:09,878 --> 00:44:14,362
Let's look at some representatives of these rules that are typical.

916
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,811
Let the player turn the game off.

917
00:44:16,811 --> 00:44:20,893
Bad save game systems cause players to repeatedly trudge

918
00:44:20,893 --> 00:44:23,154
through vast tracts of a game they can't figure out.

919
00:44:23,154 --> 00:44:25,836
They learn to hate the developer, and they quit.

920
00:44:25,836 --> 00:44:28,157
A good save game system lets you stop and start

921
00:44:28,157 --> 00:44:30,078
wherever you want.

922
00:44:30,078 --> 00:44:32,959
If you add a small amount of randomness to AI calcs, the

923
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:35,941
stupid NPCs that are running around may give you the

924
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:37,622
illusion of intelligence.

925
00:44:37,622 --> 00:44:39,683
And things that look alike should behave alike.

926
00:44:41,084 --> 00:44:45,206
The items that an avatar can pick up and use should have a graphic emphasis over and above

927
00:44:45,206 --> 00:44:51,210
mere decor. Well, these are good rules. These, the ones I've just discussed, are very much

928
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:57,333
like the rest of them. But they're small rules. They're minor. It's hard to believe that game

929
00:44:57,333 --> 00:45:02,116
designers would be guided by rules like this in their thought processes. And I was wondering

930
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:06,499
why in all the hundred rules we got, we didn't uncover anything more important or deeper.

931
00:45:07,382 --> 00:45:08,943
And I think there are a couple of reasons.

932
00:45:08,943 --> 00:45:11,906
Deep rules are very hard to articulate.

933
00:45:11,906 --> 00:45:14,488
And I think that there's a faction of game designers that

934
00:45:14,488 --> 00:45:16,610
feel that resorting to rules is to make

935
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:17,631
use of shallow tricks.

936
00:45:18,668 --> 00:45:22,492
Well, I think that rules are the summation of prior experience

937
00:45:22,492 --> 00:45:23,873
and carry with them great wisdom.

938
00:45:23,873 --> 00:45:28,478
And the important rules are big rules, rules that hold sway,

939
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:31,301
rules that actually can become part of your guidebook

940
00:45:31,301 --> 00:45:33,283
for how you go about your work.

941
00:45:33,283 --> 00:45:34,805
I want to discuss one such rule today.

942
00:45:34,805 --> 00:45:37,427
It's one of mine.

943
00:45:37,427 --> 00:45:38,869
It's personify your problems.

944
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:43,814
And what it means is to use characters to solve design difficulties.

945
00:45:43,814 --> 00:45:48,176
When you have a problem in front of you that might be solved mechanically,

946
00:45:48,176 --> 00:45:52,117
instead, see if you can get an NPC to take on that job.

947
00:45:52,117 --> 00:45:54,517
Well, this is fundamental to the sort of games that I like to play

948
00:45:54,517 --> 00:45:56,558
that involve lots of character interaction,

949
00:45:56,558 --> 00:46:02,039
a certain amount of righteous combat, and traversal and exploration.

950
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:05,540
Well, character interaction, combat, exploration,

951
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,441
this is the domain of narrative games.

952
00:46:08,483 --> 00:46:13,105
They don't cover the waterfront of game design, but they cut a broad swath through it.

953
00:46:13,105 --> 00:46:17,366
And I confess, the rule originates with my career as a screenwriter.

954
00:46:17,366 --> 00:46:22,448
Let's see how the rule applies to an old movie that I worked on, Close Encounters of the

955
00:46:22,448 --> 00:46:23,668
Third Kind.

956
00:46:23,668 --> 00:46:26,770
Steve Spielberg wanted his ending to be an awesome spectacle.

957
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:31,191
The problem in a movie is that awesomeness only goes so far.

958
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:31,891
It's very dry.

959
00:46:33,222 --> 00:46:37,106
Bearing that in mind, when Matthew Robbins and I revised Steve's script, we invented

960
00:46:37,106 --> 00:46:38,247
Little Barry.

961
00:46:38,247 --> 00:46:41,892
We got him abducted by aliens in the first act, and we delivered him to his mother's

962
00:46:41,892 --> 00:46:46,056
arms in the finale in order to give that awesomeness some emotional heft.

963
00:46:47,694 --> 00:46:52,036
When Matthew's in my movie, Dragonslayer, it's all about a romp and stomp and very scary

964
00:46:52,036 --> 00:46:52,396
dragon.

965
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:56,878
But the dragon is an animal, a force of nature, and not a dramatic villain.

966
00:46:56,878 --> 00:47:02,761
So we invented creepy King Cassiodorus and his hateful sacrificial lottery that he uses

967
00:47:02,761 --> 00:47:05,863
to appease the dragon to give the movie dramatic structure.

968
00:47:05,863 --> 00:47:10,485
So does that mean that what I'm talking about is just storytelling?

969
00:47:10,485 --> 00:47:10,925
Not at all.

970
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,862
Show don't tell in movies, which is a perfectly fine principle,

971
00:47:14,862 --> 00:47:17,724
becomes play don't show when you come to games.

972
00:47:17,724 --> 00:47:19,746
So when my rule moves to the world of games,

973
00:47:19,746 --> 00:47:23,068
it's all about design, how to weld the story and the game

974
00:47:23,068 --> 00:47:23,569
play together.

975
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:24,869
Let's look at some examples.

976
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:29,533
Here's one, how to keep danger alive before it arrives.

977
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:32,717
In my old adventure game, Fate of Atlantis,

978
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:35,238
the player's gonna spend hours running around

979
00:47:35,238 --> 00:47:37,339
before you ever arrive at the mysterious lost city.

980
00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:41,201
So we invented a companion for Indy, Sophia Hapgood.

981
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:43,863
And we outfitted her with a necklace

982
00:47:43,863 --> 00:47:44,763
that comes from that city

983
00:47:44,763 --> 00:47:48,265
that carries with it a supernatural, unhealthy aura.

984
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:51,787
Indy's a little doubtful that she's turned into a psychic,

985
00:47:51,787 --> 00:47:53,768
but we learn right away

986
00:47:53,768 --> 00:47:55,729
that her claims are not entirely imaginary.

987
00:47:56,787 --> 00:48:01,768
and a series of spooky puzzles involving her stand in for the mystery of the city until

988
00:48:01,768 --> 00:48:08,150
we actually arrive there. Well, here's a different kind of problem. Star Wars items and the poverty

989
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:14,511
thereof. A while ago, I made a little replayable action-adventure game called Yoda Stories.

990
00:48:14,511 --> 00:48:18,472
There are 15 scenarios. There are hundreds of ways to put them together. You can go through

991
00:48:18,472 --> 00:48:19,853
it each time in less than an hour.

992
00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:23,171
When we made it, we didn't know how to categorize this,

993
00:48:23,171 --> 00:48:25,133
but we now just call these things casual games.

994
00:48:25,133 --> 00:48:27,215
And it's just a little applet on your desk.

995
00:48:27,215 --> 00:48:31,219
But the problem is that progress through a game like this

996
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:33,360
is gated by a series of puzzle chains.

997
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,903
And we scoured the Star Wars Bible,

998
00:48:35,903 --> 00:48:39,186
and we found very few useful keys and tools.

999
00:48:39,186 --> 00:48:41,588
You're looking at a lot of them right here.

1000
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:44,150
What would you do with a Lomite crystal?

1001
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,212
Well, we invented a new puzzle type

1002
00:48:46,212 --> 00:48:47,673
to go along with keys and tools.

1003
00:48:47,982 --> 00:48:53,287
and tools, we invented valuables, items that only have human meaning.

1004
00:48:53,287 --> 00:48:58,812
So if you're a super-deformed Boba Fett and you demand a Lomite crystal, you super-deformed

1005
00:48:58,812 --> 00:49:02,875
Luke Skywalker better go and get one if you want to advance the action.

1006
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:10,322
This idea allowed us to create dozens of transactional puzzles involving lots of dialogue and characters

1007
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,244
to warm this little game up.

1008
00:49:13,244 --> 00:49:15,826
Now a slightly larger question is how do you take

1009
00:49:16,977 --> 00:49:22,883
a Jones story, which originated in film, and translate that into the world of games.

1010
00:49:22,883 --> 00:49:27,267
Jones stories always take place in an exaggerated version of the here and now.

1011
00:49:27,267 --> 00:49:29,609
And so does my game, Infernal Machine.

1012
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:33,856
And these games always demand, and the stories,

1013
00:49:33,856 --> 00:49:37,218
always demand adventure and the supernatural.

1014
00:49:37,218 --> 00:49:39,578
Of course, the supernatural could be accomplished

1015
00:49:39,578 --> 00:49:43,160
with visual effects, but you can also do it with characters.

1016
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,161
Here we are in Shambhala, in an abandoned monastery

1017
00:49:46,161 --> 00:49:47,861
inhabited by a lonely old woman.

1018
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:50,062
If you run around and find a plant bulb,

1019
00:49:50,062 --> 00:49:53,944
nurse it into growth, and hand that thing to the old woman,

1020
00:49:53,944 --> 00:49:55,784
when it blooms, she's magically transformed

1021
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,005
into a beautiful young princess.

1022
00:49:58,005 --> 00:50:00,366
Well, as beautiful as you can be with 100 polygons.

1023
00:50:01,655 --> 00:50:04,576
And anyway, she now requires the supernatural strength

1024
00:50:04,576 --> 00:50:08,577
to crack open a gate and send you on to even stranger things.

1025
00:50:08,577 --> 00:50:11,898
The adventure side, you need a pal and a guide.

1026
00:50:11,898 --> 00:50:14,798
We brought back Sophia Hapgood, this time

1027
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:16,899
as an untrustworthy CIA agent.

1028
00:50:16,899 --> 00:50:19,059
But we didn't just want her to hang around.

1029
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:21,020
So in the Palawan volcano level, she's

1030
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,721
kidnapped by Russian Spetsnaz soldiers.

1031
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:26,661
Meanwhile, Indy discovers a gate that blocks his path.

1032
00:50:27,146 --> 00:50:28,387
And there's a switch.

1033
00:50:28,387 --> 00:50:29,788
When pressed, the gate goes up.

1034
00:50:29,788 --> 00:50:31,790
When released, it comes right back down,

1035
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,471
forcing him to rescue Sophia,

1036
00:50:33,471 --> 00:50:35,393
who then becomes his assistant.

1037
00:50:35,393 --> 00:50:36,934
She stands by the switch

1038
00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:38,995
as he readies himself to whip across a gap.

1039
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:41,658
She presses the switch and holds it down long enough

1040
00:50:41,658 --> 00:50:43,099
for the gate to rise,

1041
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:44,760
and Indy to whip his way across

1042
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,161
and sneak inside just in time.

1043
00:50:46,161 --> 00:50:48,263
It's a co-op puzzle that anchors Sophia

1044
00:50:48,263 --> 00:50:50,525
into the gameplay, one of many.

1045
00:50:52,055 --> 00:50:56,997
The finale is a boss fight. We needed to pull the player through a long slog, and we needed

1046
00:50:56,997 --> 00:51:03,679
to give everything a supernatural twist. So the winged god Marduk, imagining that Sophia

1047
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:08,681
might be a like-minded menace, captures her and melds with her. So when you fight and

1048
00:51:08,681 --> 00:51:13,183
win, you don't just earn a victory badge. You resolve a relationship and rescue a friend.

1049
00:51:13,183 --> 00:51:13,403
Now...

1050
00:51:16,314 --> 00:51:20,719
Here's a completely different kind of problem where you have a very mechanical game

1051
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:23,122
and you need to introduce the NPCs and make them function.

1052
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:28,649
So, not long ago I made a game involving Queen Titania and King Oberon

1053
00:51:28,649 --> 00:51:31,092
late of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream.

1054
00:51:32,302 --> 00:51:35,023
They're quarreling again and you need to reunite them.

1055
00:51:35,023 --> 00:51:35,824
It's an adventure RPG,

1056
00:51:35,824 --> 00:51:38,846
but it takes the form of slider puzzles.

1057
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:41,868
The player maneuvers icons around the game board

1058
00:51:41,868 --> 00:51:45,630
in order to reveal and assemble the game elements.

1059
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:47,531
Well, some of those icons turn into characters

1060
00:51:47,531 --> 00:51:50,713
and they speak, and that gives the game some human warmth.

1061
00:51:50,713 --> 00:51:53,195
And other characters need to be assembled

1062
00:51:53,195 --> 00:51:54,856
in order to be able to deal with them at all.

1063
00:51:54,856 --> 00:51:57,377
You even have to assemble the final boss

1064
00:51:57,377 --> 00:51:58,398
in order to do battle.

1065
00:51:59,622 --> 00:52:04,084
Well, if you think what I'm talking about is old-fashioned or adventurey and static,

1066
00:52:04,084 --> 00:52:10,988
antique, not so. Here's a perfectly modern game, The Last of Us. Joel, the hero, has

1067
00:52:10,988 --> 00:52:17,631
to deliver a serum across the country where it might become a cure for a fungus that's

1068
00:52:17,631 --> 00:52:18,632
destroyed civilization.

1069
00:52:19,621 --> 00:52:23,142
And that serum might have been liquid in a little glass vial in his pocket.

1070
00:52:23,142 --> 00:52:28,125
But if that were the case, the entire experience would be as dismal as this scene.

1071
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:32,947
So instead, the serum resides in the immune system of a young woman, Ellie, his protege.

1072
00:52:32,947 --> 00:52:38,709
And the Naughty Dog designers didn't just want her to hang around either, so there are lots of co-op puzzles.

1073
00:52:39,044 --> 00:52:42,967
boosting her over walls, letting her crawl through tiny ducts to reach the far side of

1074
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:47,030
a gate that Joel can't open from this side, and because she can't swim in at least three

1075
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:52,593
instances, Joel has to find a raft to convey her across a body of water where she can do

1076
00:52:52,593 --> 00:52:53,954
her stuff.

1077
00:52:53,954 --> 00:52:56,056
She even has a level of her own.

1078
00:52:57,175 --> 00:52:59,998
Well, what's the takeaway from this sort of thing?

1079
00:52:59,998 --> 00:53:01,359
There are two.

1080
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,020
One, humanize your design.

1081
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,922
It's never a mistake to add characters,

1082
00:53:04,922 --> 00:53:09,446
especially if you can do so in unusual and functional ways.

1083
00:53:09,446 --> 00:53:12,928
But more generally, try to state the rules that do actually

1084
00:53:12,928 --> 00:53:16,071
guide you as explicitly as possible,

1085
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:18,033
because that gives them power.

1086
00:53:18,033 --> 00:53:21,095
And try to run through them like a checklist,

1087
00:53:21,095 --> 00:53:22,656
deliberately, as you work.

1088
00:53:22,656 --> 00:53:23,437
You'll find that if you do.

1089
00:53:24,438 --> 00:53:27,559
your design vocabulary will be greatly enlarged.

1090
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:31,480
This is my website, finitearts.com.

1091
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:35,701
Here you can take a look at that rule collection,

1092
00:53:35,701 --> 00:53:38,522
see my old rule talks, play Thorne or play Yoda.

1093
00:53:38,522 --> 00:53:46,704
Thank you.

1094
00:53:46,704 --> 00:53:48,625
So weird that I just introduced Hal

1095
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:50,445
after having seen him talk 15 years ago.

1096
00:53:51,297 --> 00:54:00,547
So, you know, the interesting thing about that rule set, I think, is, you know, his rule there is, you know, these are principles Hal's been using in games for ages.

1097
00:54:00,547 --> 00:54:03,650
Why can't everybody get on board with this at last?

1098
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:09,437
Anyway, finally, we're coming up to Luke Muscat here, who...

1099
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:16,281
You know, he's most known perhaps as the designer of games like Fruit Ninja, Jetpack Joyride.

1100
00:54:16,281 --> 00:54:23,824
He's now the creative director at Pretty Gate, where they worked on landsliders and other titles.

1101
00:54:23,824 --> 00:54:26,425
You know, and every year I do a talk like this, someone says,

1102
00:54:26,425 --> 00:54:29,566
yeah, really like a rule? Like, why are we doing rules?

1103
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,207
And this year that person is Luke.

1104
00:54:31,207 --> 00:54:31,647
Here he is.

1105
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:52,268
Okay, hi. Yeah, my name is Luke Muscat. I've made some stuff.

1106
00:54:52,268 --> 00:54:54,909
We're going a bit over time, so I'm gonna go a little bit faster.

1107
00:54:54,909 --> 00:54:59,171
So I'm basically here to say, forget your rules.

1108
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:02,952
Make goals your king. It's all about just having strong goals.

1109
00:55:02,952 --> 00:55:07,394
Or, if you want the shorter, snappier, more twitterable

1110
00:55:07,394 --> 00:55:09,455
title for this talk, fuck rules.

1111
00:55:11,419 --> 00:55:16,541
Here's the problem I have with rules. Every time that I'm thinking about rules

1112
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:18,182
or, you know, trying to kind of

1113
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:22,384
process all of the knowledge and wisdom I've gotten from other designers and

1114
00:55:22,384 --> 00:55:23,124
through

1115
00:55:23,124 --> 00:55:25,285
making lots of games over the years,

1116
00:55:25,285 --> 00:55:28,906
it lets me take something, a feature that I'm making, and go from like

1117
00:55:29,287 --> 00:55:33,612
crap feature to something really good, and then all of a sudden I realize I've actually

1118
00:55:33,612 --> 00:55:35,334
been making the wrong thing all along.

1119
00:55:35,334 --> 00:55:38,198
So this is why I love goals.

1120
00:55:38,198 --> 00:55:41,763
It's always for me about keeping goals just to make sure I'm making the right thing.

1121
00:55:41,763 --> 00:55:43,044
And I'm going to give you an example.

1122
00:55:44,255 --> 00:55:47,138
So let's say this could be like a design document or

1123
00:55:47,138 --> 00:55:50,281
whatever, for this will be like a user story and a

1124
00:55:50,281 --> 00:55:52,143
sprint backlog.

1125
00:55:52,143 --> 00:55:54,185
We're going to make a health bar.

1126
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:57,409
And we have a list of tasks there to make that health bar,

1127
00:55:57,409 --> 00:56:00,272
and then a kind of estimate of how long we think it might

1128
00:56:00,272 --> 00:56:01,533
take to make it.

1129
00:56:01,533 --> 00:56:02,674
So here we go.

1130
00:56:02,674 --> 00:56:03,535
Here's our health bar.

1131
00:56:03,535 --> 00:56:03,776
And.

1132
00:56:05,898 --> 00:56:07,819
Like that health bar sucks, right?

1133
00:56:07,819 --> 00:56:09,520
That's one shitty health bar.

1134
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,480
So what do I do?

1135
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,561
Well, I think about the first thing

1136
00:56:12,561 --> 00:56:14,703
that I learned as a designer, which is it's

1137
00:56:14,703 --> 00:56:16,383
all about player feedback.

1138
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:18,344
You've got to make it juicy and exciting,

1139
00:56:18,344 --> 00:56:21,146
and then that's going to make this health bar really good.

1140
00:56:21,146 --> 00:56:23,407
So let's iterate this health bar real quick.

1141
00:56:23,407 --> 00:56:26,409
We can add a little bit of art, so at least it

1142
00:56:26,409 --> 00:56:27,109
doesn't look so placeholder.

1143
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:27,649
And then, whoops.

1144
00:56:31,505 --> 00:56:34,326
we can add a bit of animation there as well.

1145
00:56:34,326 --> 00:56:37,707
So now you can see really clearly exactly how much health

1146
00:56:37,707 --> 00:56:38,767
you've lost.

1147
00:56:38,767 --> 00:56:40,188
And then we add particles.

1148
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,348
Yeah, particles.

1149
00:56:41,348 --> 00:56:43,189
Everyone loves particles, right?

1150
00:56:43,189 --> 00:56:46,750
And then we can step it up and add some screen shake as well.

1151
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,871
And now we have a health bar that's kind of cool.

1152
00:56:48,871 --> 00:56:51,212
And of course, we can just keep on going and going and going

1153
00:56:51,212 --> 00:56:52,373
and make this better and better.

1154
00:56:53,033 --> 00:56:55,236
And what we've done is we've taken an idea

1155
00:56:55,236 --> 00:56:57,539
and then we've implemented it and then we've iterated

1156
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:00,022
on that implementation to make it as good as possible

1157
00:57:00,022 --> 00:57:01,764
and then we're done.

1158
00:57:01,764 --> 00:57:05,149
And even kind of like the dangerous part of this

1159
00:57:05,149 --> 00:57:06,771
is I love that health bar, right?

1160
00:57:06,771 --> 00:57:08,994
Like I just sunk a whole bunch of time into that health bar.

1161
00:57:10,122 --> 00:57:12,924
But, I mean, why was I making a health bar again?

1162
00:57:12,924 --> 00:57:15,786
Like, clearly I thought it was a good idea at some point,

1163
00:57:15,786 --> 00:57:17,447
but at this point I've completely forgotten

1164
00:57:17,447 --> 00:57:18,988
what the purpose of this health bar was.

1165
00:57:18,988 --> 00:57:21,329
And even if I remember why it's on there,

1166
00:57:21,329 --> 00:57:23,251
in the design document or whatever,

1167
00:57:23,251 --> 00:57:25,372
you can bet my programmers and artists don't know.

1168
00:57:26,993 --> 00:57:30,657
So this is the thing, this is, you know, we always have like, you know, the vision, which

1169
00:57:30,657 --> 00:57:33,800
is like our really big goal for the game, and then we have the design pillars, which

1170
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,863
are like the ones in the middle, and then like the user stories, or like, you know,

1171
00:57:36,863 --> 00:57:40,426
the feature kind of goals, and then all of a sudden we're implementing it, and for me,

1172
00:57:40,426 --> 00:57:43,269
like, I just completely forget all that other stuff.

1173
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:45,251
And you know, implementation is hard.

1174
00:57:45,772 --> 00:57:48,555
And I think that's why it kind of goes over the top of all of that.

1175
00:57:48,555 --> 00:57:52,961
I mean, a lot of the talks at GDC are about the best way to implement something.

1176
00:57:52,961 --> 00:57:54,302
How do you make something more efficient?

1177
00:57:54,302 --> 00:57:57,867
How do you make it even better, have a better emotional response?

1178
00:57:59,221 --> 00:58:03,502
And so what I try and do is actually make it really explicit

1179
00:58:03,502 --> 00:58:07,503
that I need to hit my goals. And you can do that with a few really simple little

1180
00:58:07,503 --> 00:58:11,484
tweaks. So instead of a user story, I can set a goal here and go, okay, the player can

1181
00:58:11,484 --> 00:58:14,924
take multiple hits and knows when they will die. I mean, that's basically like

1182
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:17,005
the goal of a health bar, right?

1183
00:58:17,005 --> 00:58:21,826
And now, instead of having a list of tasks, we have a list of possible solutions.

1184
00:58:21,826 --> 00:58:24,426
There is definitely more than one way to skin this cat.

1185
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:27,249
Tricky part is, is now effort.

1186
00:58:27,249 --> 00:58:29,572
We don't know exactly what we're making, right?

1187
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:31,374
So how do we calculate the effort?

1188
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:32,776
Well, I think that's fine.

1189
00:58:32,776 --> 00:58:34,018
We could do even better.

1190
00:58:34,018 --> 00:58:35,720
Let's set a budget instead.

1191
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,323
How important is it that we hit this goal

1192
00:58:38,323 --> 00:58:39,605
and really nail it?

1193
00:58:39,605 --> 00:58:41,307
And let's scale the amount of work

1194
00:58:41,307 --> 00:58:43,229
based on not how much there is to do,

1195
00:58:43,229 --> 00:58:44,310
but how important it is.

1196
00:58:45,577 --> 00:58:49,020
And this way it really explicitly allows us to iterate on an idea first

1197
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,624
before we iterate on the implementation.

1198
00:58:52,624 --> 00:58:55,027
And really, I put this goal everywhere

1199
00:58:55,027 --> 00:58:57,830
just so that I invoke my inner three-year-old,

1200
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:00,073
which is just to keep asking why.

1201
00:59:00,073 --> 00:59:02,435
Why? Why are we doing this? To make it more fun.

1202
00:59:02,435 --> 00:59:04,277
Yeah, but like, why? Does it need to be fun?

1203
00:59:04,277 --> 00:59:07,200
And just keep on drilling back further and further.

1204
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:10,322
And you know, we can make this goal way better as well.

1205
00:59:10,322 --> 00:59:12,263
We can iterate on the goal and go,

1206
00:59:12,263 --> 00:59:14,885
okay, let's try and create exciting moments

1207
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,986
where the player barely scrapes through an area.

1208
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:19,167
That's really what this health bar was about

1209
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,047
in the first place, right?

1210
00:59:20,047 --> 00:59:22,588
And there's so many ways we could do that.

1211
00:59:22,588 --> 00:59:24,249
Health bar is totally one of those ways.

1212
00:59:24,249 --> 00:59:26,130
This isn't saying like, don't do health bars.

1213
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,251
Maybe that is the best way,

1214
00:59:27,251 --> 00:59:29,852
and maybe for, you know, the amount of budget we have,

1215
00:59:29,852 --> 00:59:30,773
maybe that's what works.

1216
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:36,485
So, when I was doing Jetpack Joyride, we had this exact problem, right?

1217
00:59:36,485 --> 00:59:39,407
This is basically what it looked like at one point. It's a cave flyer.

1218
00:59:39,407 --> 00:59:42,469
One touch, dodge stuff, if something hits you, you die.

1219
00:59:42,469 --> 00:59:43,510
And that's it.

1220
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:47,813
And you know, it was already looking like this. It was quite polished and pretty fun, but we just...

1221
00:59:47,813 --> 00:59:49,954
I mean, I wasn't quite feeling it.

1222
00:59:49,954 --> 00:59:52,636
It just wasn't quite there yet, I didn't think.

1223
00:59:52,636 --> 00:59:55,078
It felt a little one-note and a little repetitive.

1224
00:59:55,078 --> 00:59:58,921
So I go, okay, my goal is obviously to add some variety.

1225
00:59:58,921 --> 00:59:59,881
How am I gonna add variety?

1226
01:00:01,018 --> 01:00:06,662
power-ups. Duh. Like that's obviously the way that I'll do it. And we spent ages

1227
01:00:06,662 --> 01:00:10,365
working on power-ups and it just, I mean, it helped. There was more variety, there

1228
01:00:10,365 --> 01:00:16,150
was more things to do, but it just wasn't quite there. And really the reason is, is

1229
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:20,954
this goal sucks. Make the game more interesting? Like what does that even

1230
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:24,496
mean? My possible solutions are power-ups and maybe something else.

1231
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:30,142
We really gotta give that goal a bit of love and make that a better goal.

1232
01:00:30,142 --> 01:00:35,146
And so we realized after a while playing around with it, it wasn't just that it needed more

1233
01:00:35,146 --> 01:00:40,290
variety, like the intensity really specifically needed more variety.

1234
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:45,113
Because the game starts slow and then speeds up and you're always one hit away from death.

1235
01:00:45,113 --> 01:00:49,536
And so your intensity just starts low, ramps up and then you're just like maxed out the

1236
01:00:49,536 --> 01:00:50,217
whole time.

1237
01:00:50,217 --> 01:00:52,499
And then that makes it feel really one note.

1238
01:00:53,279 --> 01:00:57,040
And I realize, like, you know, the variety problem isn't necessarily about power-ups

1239
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,060
or having different things to do.

1240
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:01,261
It's actually a health problem, right?

1241
01:01:01,261 --> 01:01:05,422
If I add three hearts, for example, all of a sudden we get a dramatically different intensity

1242
01:01:05,422 --> 01:01:05,822
curve.

1243
01:01:05,822 --> 01:01:10,103
You start off really low, you hit something, and all of a sudden you're like, ooh, okay,

1244
01:01:10,103 --> 01:01:13,024
I've only got one more hit left and then I'm on my last hit.

1245
01:01:13,024 --> 01:01:16,284
Or we could do, like, a regenerating health thing, like in a Call of Duty or whatever.

1246
01:01:16,284 --> 01:01:19,905
And they all give really different intensities and feeling to the game.

1247
01:01:19,905 --> 01:01:22,706
It's really about health, not about adding power-ups.

1248
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:27,568
And we kind of ended up with this system, which is the vehicle system, where every now

1249
01:01:27,568 --> 01:01:32,529
and then you'll find a vehicle and it'll actually change the controls and everything.

1250
01:01:32,529 --> 01:01:38,332
And you know, it stops and slows down the whole game and it kind of starts you off again.

1251
01:01:38,332 --> 01:01:42,633
Really the vehicle is just the most elaborate health pack pickup you've ever seen.

1252
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:47,375
Eventually I'll hit something and blow up and now you're back into the same cadence

1253
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:47,875
as before.

1254
01:01:48,655 --> 01:01:52,179
And this gives us this really interesting intensity curve.

1255
01:01:52,179 --> 01:01:55,181
It's just this kind of weird love child of a health system

1256
01:01:55,181 --> 01:01:56,363
and a power-up system.

1257
01:01:56,363 --> 01:01:58,585
And it became a really iconic part of the game

1258
01:01:58,585 --> 01:02:00,246
and a big factor of its success.

1259
01:02:02,376 --> 01:02:05,978
So some pros to kind of working this way, I mean, other than the ones I've kind of

1260
01:02:05,978 --> 01:02:07,599
obviously already laid out,

1261
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:11,442
my favorite thing is that it really helps the team all pull in the same

1262
01:02:11,442 --> 01:02:12,342
direction.

1263
01:02:12,342 --> 01:02:13,883
You know, like when a programmer

1264
01:02:13,883 --> 01:02:17,125
comes to you and has some crazy feature that they just worked on on the side,

1265
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:20,887
they come up with some, you know, batshit crazy thing that they

1266
01:02:20,887 --> 01:02:24,610
really like and sometimes, like fifty percent of the time it's super cool and ends up in

1267
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:28,212
the game and fifty percent of the time you're like, well that's cool but like,

1268
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:28,952
why did you do that?

1269
01:02:30,013 --> 01:02:35,816
If your goals are always really explicitly stated everywhere, it means there's a really good chance

1270
01:02:35,816 --> 01:02:38,997
that they'll be pulling in the right direction and come up with something cool that you didn't

1271
01:02:38,997 --> 01:02:44,680
even think of that helps you achieve that goal. Even better, it helps them kind of check me to

1272
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:48,923
make sure I'm trying to hit those goals because I might start implementing something and they're

1273
01:02:48,923 --> 01:02:51,564
like, what are you sure that actually achieves what you were trying to do?

1274
01:02:53,001 --> 01:02:57,462
Some of the cons, well, you know, if you're in a company of 500 people

1275
01:02:57,462 --> 01:03:00,823
and you're the UI designer, maybe you have to make a health bar.

1276
01:03:00,823 --> 01:03:04,644
Because maybe it's on a contract that you have with a giant publisher or whatever.

1277
01:03:04,644 --> 01:03:08,385
It's not necessarily completely possible to go, well, I don't know what I'm making,

1278
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:10,766
I just know what I want it to feel like.

1279
01:03:10,766 --> 01:03:13,426
But even still, I feel like as long as you're constantly going back,

1280
01:03:13,426 --> 01:03:16,627
I'm making a health bar, like, why is the health bar important?

1281
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:17,927
What are the important parts of this?

1282
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,128
What do I want to convey?

1283
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:21,388
You can still use goals to help make that even better.

1284
01:03:22,903 --> 01:03:24,644
Goals can be really weird.

1285
01:03:24,644 --> 01:03:28,505
One of the big goals we had when we made Fruit Ninja was we wanted players to be able to

1286
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:30,046
smell the fruit.

1287
01:03:30,046 --> 01:03:32,867
Like it was some weird kind of smell-o-vision thing.

1288
01:03:32,867 --> 01:03:37,169
So this is like obviously a completely outrageous goal, but what it helped do was make us really

1289
01:03:37,169 --> 01:03:41,271
focus on the splatters and the feedback, and it guided us in other ways.

1290
01:03:41,271 --> 01:03:44,972
The fruit is always perfect and always cut perfectly in half, because we didn't want

1291
01:03:44,972 --> 01:03:48,534
to do anything that would invoke the smell of rotten fruit, for example.

1292
01:03:49,914 --> 01:03:54,333
And then, even better, this is what I really, really like about goals, is goals can be selfish.

1293
01:03:54,963 --> 01:03:58,185
goals can be about you as a designer or your team, they don't need to be about the

1294
01:03:58,185 --> 01:03:59,086
player at all.

1295
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:02,328
You can do something just because you want to use a new bit of kit and

1296
01:04:02,328 --> 01:04:02,928
try something out.

1297
01:04:02,928 --> 01:04:07,051
You can do things because you want to see what is possible, or maybe you know it's a

1298
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:10,253
business objective, you want to just see what you can do.

1299
01:04:10,253 --> 01:04:12,314
You can just come up with goals

1300
01:04:12,314 --> 01:04:15,216
that are to push yourself and push your team

1301
01:04:15,216 --> 01:04:16,657
and see what's possible.

1302
01:04:16,657 --> 01:04:19,799
And I mean that's what we're doing right now and I can tell you it is pushing us,

1303
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:20,500
oh my god.

1304
01:04:22,337 --> 01:04:26,460
And so, yeah, I just use goals for everything, including this talk, right?

1305
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,582
So, I really hate PowerPoint and Keynote,

1306
01:04:29,582 --> 01:04:31,723
because I think it is a really limiting way of...

1307
01:04:31,723 --> 01:04:35,285
There's just certain kinds of experiences that you can't create.

1308
01:04:35,285 --> 01:04:37,987
And so I had this, like, really ridiculous idea in my head that,

1309
01:04:37,987 --> 01:04:40,989
you know, one thing that I couldn't do in Keynote is, like,

1310
01:04:40,989 --> 01:04:44,311
step back and shoot my own presentation with a machine gun,

1311
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:46,812
which is, like, the dumbest kind of goal ever.

1312
01:04:46,812 --> 01:04:50,535
But, I mean, that's kind of the reason that I made my entire presentation in Unity.

1313
01:04:55,513 --> 01:04:58,619
uh...

1314
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:03,588
when i showed this to Richard he was like hmm

1315
01:05:03,588 --> 01:05:04,850
you don't have kids do you?

1316
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:08,759
And this is the thing, right?

1317
01:05:08,759 --> 01:05:11,101
Like with goals and restrictions, even when

1318
01:05:11,101 --> 01:05:14,323
they're, sorry, with rules and restrictions is sometimes

1319
01:05:14,323 --> 01:05:17,305
they're gently nudging you to do a particular thing, right?

1320
01:05:17,305 --> 01:05:20,107
Like with GDC, there's no rule saying don't do this,

1321
01:05:20,107 --> 01:05:22,768
but it's telling you download the PowerPoint,

1322
01:05:22,768 --> 01:05:24,409
download the keynote template.

1323
01:05:24,409 --> 01:05:26,351
And those are all really reliable ways

1324
01:05:26,351 --> 01:05:30,013
to make a really good that kind of presentation.

1325
01:05:30,013 --> 01:05:32,174
But the problem is, it's like rules rarely

1326
01:05:32,174 --> 01:05:33,935
lead to something new.

1327
01:05:33,935 --> 01:05:35,696
It's only through kind of breaking rules.

1328
01:05:37,607 --> 01:05:39,509
that you can really try and do something new.

1329
01:05:39,509 --> 01:05:42,032
And don't get me wrong, doing something that's new

1330
01:05:42,032 --> 01:05:43,654
just for the sake of, you know,

1331
01:05:43,654 --> 01:05:46,177
something new isn't the be-all and end-all.

1332
01:05:46,177 --> 01:05:50,442
You can, but I think sometimes we,

1333
01:05:50,442 --> 01:05:52,565
we lose sight of just how powerful kind of surprise

1334
01:05:52,565 --> 01:05:53,285
and novelty can be.

1335
01:05:55,937 --> 01:06:01,624
So yeah, I'm like way over time, so I'm going to skip my very carefully constructed metaphor

1336
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:07,351
and just skip straight to the end, because really, my actual goal, all I was trying to

1337
01:06:07,351 --> 01:06:14,259
achieve is to do whatever I could to make you guys remember to go for your goals.

1338
01:06:27,706 --> 01:06:30,267
Let's get out of this madness.

1339
01:06:30,267 --> 01:06:31,608
So thanks everyone for coming.

1340
01:06:31,608 --> 01:06:35,250
Remember that everything you know so far is wrong.

1341
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:37,592
I hope these speakers help subvert your thoughts

1342
01:06:37,592 --> 01:06:38,912
about game design.

1343
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:41,194
Remember too that the corollary of everything you know

1344
01:06:41,194 --> 01:06:43,715
is wrong is that no one knows anything,

1345
01:06:43,715 --> 01:06:45,316
Kara of William Goldman.

1346
01:06:45,316 --> 01:06:47,878
So the rules you saw here today may not apply to you now,

1347
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,799
they may not apply to your project right now,

1348
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:50,899
they may never apply to you,

1349
01:06:50,899 --> 01:06:52,460
but keep them for when you're in the darkness

1350
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:53,381
and you're wondering what to do.

1351
01:06:54,142 --> 01:06:56,866
figure out what your own rules are and make

1352
01:06:56,866 --> 01:06:57,868
and make great games.
