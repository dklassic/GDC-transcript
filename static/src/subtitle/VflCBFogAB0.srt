1
00:00:11,688 --> 00:00:17,191
So, hello everyone. I'm Anthony Johnston, and these days I'm best known for Atomic Blonde,

2
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:23,495
the Charlize Theron movie that was based on my graphic novel. But within games, I'm known

3
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:29,838
for titles like Dead Space, Zombie U, Shadow of Mordor, and Resident Evil Village.

4
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,810
I'm also a novelist, screenwriter, nonfiction writer,

5
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,011
podcaster, and general insomniac.

6
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:42,211
So I get around and I do so as a freelancer.

7
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:47,012
And I mentioned that because that is the perspective

8
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:48,713
from which I'm talking today.

9
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:51,833
You might be a staff writer or a narrative producer,

10
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,154
or you might also be freelance.

11
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,282
whatever your situation and position, it might be different to mine.

12
00:00:58,282 --> 00:01:02,344
So you may not be able to do things exactly the way I do them.

13
00:01:02,344 --> 00:01:05,607
I mean, hell, even I can't always do things the way I like to,

14
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:09,529
because anyone who's worked on more than one game knows

15
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:15,113
that every project is different, unique and presents an entirely new situation

16
00:01:15,113 --> 00:01:17,154
compared to whatever we worked on last time.

17
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:19,722
So it's important to be flexible,

18
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:23,666
take everything I'm about to say as a guideline,

19
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,327
as guardrails, if you like,

20
00:01:25,327 --> 00:01:27,749
within which to shape your own vision

21
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:30,751
and your own way of working.

22
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:31,451
Apart from this,

23
00:01:31,451 --> 00:01:35,214
that's really important.

24
00:01:35,214 --> 00:01:37,216
Everything else, flexible.

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,988
So let's start with the most important and obvious first question.

26
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:45,871
What is a writer's room?

27
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:50,318
Or rather, what do we mean by a writer's room in the context of games?

28
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:55,603
In TV, the writer's room is both a physical space

29
00:01:55,603 --> 00:01:56,664
and a methodology.

30
00:01:56,664 --> 00:01:59,546
The room is populated by a number of writers

31
00:01:59,546 --> 00:02:01,827
with different skill levels and experience.

32
00:02:01,827 --> 00:02:04,688
And one of those writers, sometimes two,

33
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:07,610
but normally just one, is the showrunner,

34
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,071
which basically means they're in charge.

35
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:14,854
It can often be more complex and nuanced than that.

36
00:02:14,854 --> 00:02:17,215
I am simplifying a lot of things here

37
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:18,676
for the sake of brevity.

38
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:20,897
So Hollywood people, please cut me some slack.

39
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,221
Normally, the showrunner also wrote the pilot's script

40
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:30,304
and has a vision for how it can become a series.

41
00:02:30,304 --> 00:02:31,825
So they assemble a room,

42
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:34,426
communicate their vision to the writers

43
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:37,108
who brainstorm ideas for that series,

44
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:40,070
condense those ideas into stories

45
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,310
that can become a season of TV,

46
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,632
outline those stories as episodes,

47
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:47,574
and then write, revise, and polish the scripts

48
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:48,875
for those episodes.

49
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:55,379
What's important is that almost all of that is done together,

50
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,282
collectively, in collaboration as a room.

51
00:02:58,282 --> 00:03:01,564
And that is one of the big ideological points

52
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:02,185
of this method.

53
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:06,782
Even some films now use writers' rooms.

54
00:03:06,782 --> 00:03:09,922
Big blockbusters will put together a small room,

55
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:10,982
often just for a couple of weeks,

56
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,123
right at the start of development

57
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:15,723
to brainstorm plots and story ideas,

58
00:03:15,723 --> 00:03:17,464
break character arcs and so on.

59
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,764
It's not the norm by any means,

60
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:22,385
but it is happening more and more.

61
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:25,425
So why do they do this?

62
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:28,346
Why has TV worked this way for decades

63
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:30,647
and now even movies are starting to do it as well?

64
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,686
because it works.

65
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:35,887
Whether it's for a whole season of TV

66
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:38,748
or just a few weeks of film pre-production,

67
00:03:38,748 --> 00:03:41,069
the writer's room is valuable.

68
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:44,291
Now, that's worth noting because it's

69
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,913
one of the ways games can take this idea and make it our own.

70
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:52,414
Rooms don't have to be a permanent arrangement.

71
00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:55,436
You might assemble one for just a few weeks

72
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,737
in order to break the spine of your narrative

73
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,178
and then revert back to a smaller staff

74
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:01,038
to write the script.

75
00:04:02,262 --> 00:04:04,523
or you could opt to keep a room running

76
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:07,084
throughout development, especially if you have

77
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:10,745
a lot of content to generate.

78
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:14,006
So what's the difference between a writing team and a writer's

79
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:14,226
room?

80
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:20,980
A writer's room generally has a flatter structure and less rigidly defined roles.

81
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,625
There is a single leader, the showrunner, to use the TV term,

82
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:29,672
but everyone else's duties can and often will change from day to day

83
00:04:29,672 --> 00:04:33,117
according to what the showrunner determines needs doing.

84
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:36,543
One day you might write the script for a cut scene.

85
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,684
The next you might write the character's backstory and bio.

86
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:43,026
And the next, the whole room might spend all day

87
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:45,907
brainstorming ideas for a story arc.

88
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:51,529
This requires flexibility and agility on everyone's part,

89
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:55,350
but the benefits can be enormous,

90
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,371
in particular, the sense of teamwork

91
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:59,012
and camaraderie it builds.

92
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,298
Now, at this point, some of you may think,

93
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:05,541
well, actually, we already do things this way.

94
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,142
And if so, congratulations,

95
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:10,026
you may now feel very smug indeed.

96
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:13,109
But names are important.

97
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:14,371
We know that better than anyone.

98
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:18,157
And we also know that names can influence

99
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:20,597
how people think about things.

100
00:05:20,597 --> 00:05:23,858
So if you're already doing this, or if you come away

101
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:27,019
from this talk thinking, we should definitely do this,

102
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:31,560
I encourage you to own it and call yourself a writer's room.

103
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,081
It can alter perceptions and make a big difference

104
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:37,682
to the work you get done, the work you're

105
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:40,223
expected to get done, and even how

106
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,964
that work is received by your non-writing colleagues

107
00:05:43,964 --> 00:05:44,864
and clients.

108
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:51,585
A moment ago, I said the showrunner, to use the TV term.

109
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,746
But we're not TV.

110
00:05:52,746 --> 00:05:55,008
And while we're cribbing from them,

111
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:56,449
we're not trying to be TV.

112
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:59,632
So we do need our own nomenclature.

113
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:02,595
Names are important.

114
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,837
Names and terms also continually evolve in this business.

115
00:06:05,837 --> 00:06:08,199
And I am sure that that will happen here in the years

116
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:08,640
to come.

117
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,923
But for now, I call that person, the one running the room,

118
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:14,164
the head writer.

119
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:17,979
I know it's not as glamorous as Showrunner,

120
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:19,919
but it is a more accurate description

121
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,680
of what the role means in games.

122
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,820
So let's go with it.

123
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,481
Speaking of evolution, it is important to remember

124
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:30,442
that writers' runs in games are still a pretty new idea.

125
00:06:30,442 --> 00:06:33,522
And in many respects, we're playing catch up.

126
00:06:33,522 --> 00:06:38,683
But that also gives us an opportunity to lead.

127
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:43,689
to shape and establish practices and norms right now

128
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:47,711
at this moment, which will become accepted standard

129
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:50,312
practice within the industry.

130
00:06:50,312 --> 00:06:53,013
Let's seize that opportunity for the good of game writers

131
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:53,934
everywhere.

132
00:06:53,934 --> 00:07:00,777
With all of that in mind, what is the aim of a writers' room?

133
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:03,418
What are we trying to achieve to foster the best

134
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:06,380
environment for creativity and productivity?

135
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,073
Assemble a staff of good writers.

136
00:07:11,073 --> 00:07:14,016
Create a space for ideas to flourish.

137
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,839
Encourage collaborative brainstorming.

138
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,201
Produce consistent, unified material

139
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:22,605
and meet the producers' needs.

140
00:07:22,605 --> 00:07:25,428
Let's use those as our chapter headers, as it were,

141
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:28,431
and see how we go about doing just that.

142
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:30,393
So we'll begin with

143
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,912
assemble a staff of good writers.

144
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:35,473
And the first step is hiring the room,

145
00:07:35,473 --> 00:07:37,653
because before you can run the room,

146
00:07:37,653 --> 00:07:40,074
you must hire writers to be in the room.

147
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:46,076
This is exciting, but it's also time consuming.

148
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:48,137
So make sure you allow plenty of time.

149
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:50,598
Putting a room together at the last minute

150
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:53,338
can lead to hiring the wrong people

151
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:55,799
or not getting a good mix of writers

152
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:58,040
and then later having to replace some of them,

153
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,000
which is never fun.

154
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:04,954
If you're not the one hiring or selecting writers for your room,

155
00:08:04,954 --> 00:08:10,918
if you're taking over an existing room or working with a studio that has internal writing staff,

156
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:17,022
I strongly advise you to talk with everyone beforehand and to anyone who's worked with

157
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:24,688
them before because one of the most important things in a room is the dynamic between different

158
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:25,889
kinds of writers.

159
00:08:26,802 --> 00:08:32,185
The best rooms feature a diverse variety of voices, styles,

160
00:08:32,185 --> 00:08:35,107
and points of view.

161
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:37,769
Now, I use the word diverse deliberately.

162
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:40,351
Yes, you should put in the effort

163
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:44,513
to hire writers who are not cis white men.

164
00:08:44,513 --> 00:08:47,255
And it's for the same reason that you should also

165
00:08:47,255 --> 00:08:52,059
hire writers who are diverse in their experience, resumes,

166
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:54,700
approach, style, and personality.

167
00:08:55,968 --> 00:09:03,435
Hiring a room of writers who are all the same, or worse, who all basically think like you,

168
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:10,942
is pointless. It defeats the main reason to have a writer's room, which is bouncing ideas off each

169
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:16,147
other and working collaboratively to create something greater than the sum of its parts.

170
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:16,227
So,

171
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:22,794
Ideally, you want at least one veteran,

172
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:25,556
someone who has seen everything the industry has to offer

173
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:27,398
and lived to tell the tale.

174
00:09:27,398 --> 00:09:29,920
They might even be more experienced than you,

175
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,302
but willing to be your trusted second.

176
00:09:32,302 --> 00:09:33,243
Happens all the time.

177
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:36,865
you should also try to hire at least one junior,

178
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:41,488
someone either brand new or very inexperienced.

179
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:44,170
This is often how you'll find those writers

180
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,652
from marginalized communities,

181
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,674
and you can help them gain experience

182
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:51,016
to become the veterans of tomorrow.

183
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:54,278
And it's not purely altruistic.

184
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:58,882
Junior writers can be a source of insight and ideas

185
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:01,524
that the more battle-scarred among us

186
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:03,125
simply wouldn't consider.

187
00:10:05,352 --> 00:10:11,856
In between those two extremes, fill the room with solid midfielders, writers with good

188
00:10:11,856 --> 00:10:15,439
track records but who aren't household names.

189
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:22,164
In so much as any gamed writer is a household name, but you know what I mean.

190
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:23,385
Diversity of resume.

191
00:10:23,385 --> 00:10:29,770
If you're writing a shooty-shooty war game, it makes sense to hire writers who've worked

192
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,273
on other Call of Battlefield, Spec Duty, Tank Ops games, right?

193
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:36,053
Well, not always.

194
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,014
And sure, one or two is good.

195
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:39,555
And if it's not your own speciality,

196
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,578
I strongly recommend that your trusted second

197
00:10:42,578 --> 00:10:45,320
should be someone who is a veteran of the genre.

198
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,363
But for the rest of the room, what's more important

199
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:51,826
is the kind of games they've worked on before

200
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:53,988
in terms of size, budget, style,

201
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,810
and whether they've worked as part of a team.

202
00:10:59,507 --> 00:11:04,976
Diversity of approach can be tricky to gauge when hiring people you don't know or haven't

203
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:08,963
worked with before, but there are several things you can do.

204
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:13,491
First, you can talk to other people a writer's worked with to see how they operate.

205
00:11:14,613 --> 00:11:16,413
Second, you can pose a hypothetical.

206
00:11:16,413 --> 00:11:20,874
I like to present candidates with several very different

207
00:11:20,874 --> 00:11:22,855
high concepts in the relevant genre,

208
00:11:22,855 --> 00:11:25,735
let them pick their favorite, and tell me

209
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:26,996
how they'd approach it.

210
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:30,356
Just spitballing ideas to find out what attracts them

211
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,617
and how they think about stories.

212
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:35,598
When you're talking writer to writer,

213
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:37,318
the answers to a question like that

214
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:38,978
can be extremely revealing.

215
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,885
And finally, you can just ask people how they like to work.

216
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:48,711
Are they detail-orientated or more about big picture plots?

217
00:11:48,711 --> 00:11:51,875
Do they prefer being given firm direction

218
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,598
or to find their own way to an idea, and so on?

219
00:11:57,053 --> 00:12:00,734
Diversity of personality is why, wherever possible,

220
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:02,855
you should be the one talking to candidates

221
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,235
and getting to know them.

222
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:07,916
So you've had at least two or three conversations with them

223
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,217
by the time you get to final selection.

224
00:12:10,217 --> 00:12:13,538
Now, of course, everyone's on their best behavior

225
00:12:13,538 --> 00:12:15,299
when being interviewed for a job,

226
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:18,179
but people also loosen up over time,

227
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:22,140
especially if you're open and honest with them

228
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,902
about your aims and expectations for them and the project.

229
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:30,380
This is important because you and your writing staff

230
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,401
are going to spend a lot of time together.

231
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:36,223
You must be confident you'll get along.

232
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:41,925
And that brings us to create a space for ideas to flourish.

233
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:44,766
In other words, how you're going to spend all that time

234
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:49,828
together.

235
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:51,008
Now, let's be clear up front.

236
00:12:52,353 --> 00:12:56,996
As head writer, you won't actually originate as much material as everyone else.

237
00:12:56,996 --> 00:13:01,399
There are some things you should keep ownership of, the master timeline,

238
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:06,662
a broad overview of the law, compiling the world Bible, if there is one.

239
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:11,246
But most of your time will be spent brainstorming with your writing staff

240
00:13:11,246 --> 00:13:17,850
and facilitating them to be creative and generate the material you need.

241
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,671
Here's how you do that.

242
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:20,111
First,

243
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:27,447
Establish ground rules. These are mine. I state them up front at the very start of the very first

244
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:34,611
session of any room where I'm head writer. Nobody stands on ceremony, don't wait for good ideas,

245
00:13:34,611 --> 00:13:41,055
my virtual door is always open, and don't be a dick. Now, you might be tempted to skip over this.

246
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:43,676
It feels like you shouldn't even need to say these things, right?

247
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:48,078
But remember, many game writers have never been in a room before.

248
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,960
When you establish ground rules, you're

249
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,525
making sure nobody is in any doubt that you are in charge,

250
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:56,669
that everyone knows how to behave,

251
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,934
and that this is a safe, collaborative space

252
00:13:59,934 --> 00:14:01,335
for creativity.

253
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:02,156
So let's run through them.

254
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:05,329
Nobody stands on ceremony.

255
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:08,912
I mean, without this, the room doesn't work.

256
00:14:08,912 --> 00:14:10,353
You may be head writer,

257
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:14,776
but if the junior writer thinks your story idea stinks,

258
00:14:14,776 --> 00:14:18,579
they must feel comfortable enough to say that.

259
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:21,741
And you should positively encourage them to do so.

260
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,602
When you're brainstorming or discussing story solutions,

261
00:14:26,602 --> 00:14:29,365
try to keep the room as flat as possible.

262
00:14:29,365 --> 00:14:32,809
A junior who feels like they dance suggests an idea,

263
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:36,112
or a veteran who pulls rank all the time

264
00:14:36,112 --> 00:14:38,515
are equally useless to you.

265
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:41,198
Which leads to, don't wait for good ideas.

266
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:47,729
If you're trying to figure something out and someone else has an idea, you want them to offer

267
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:54,655
it up, even if they don't think it's a very good idea. Because sometimes, in fact quite a lot of

268
00:14:54,655 --> 00:15:02,902
times, discussing and dissecting bad ideas is what leads to good ideas. So nobody should feel bad or

269
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:09,428
be criticized for thinking out loud and voicing their ideas. Again, that is the point of the room.

270
00:15:11,892 --> 00:15:13,833
My virtual door is always open.

271
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,954
Part of a head writer's responsibility

272
00:15:15,954 --> 00:15:20,136
is to be a sounding board and a source of knowledge.

273
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:23,637
Your staff will have follow-up questions, or sometimes

274
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:26,859
things they want to discuss outside of the room,

275
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,980
and you should be there for them.

276
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,361
Set yourself up a Slack or Discord just for the writers

277
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:35,803
room, and tell everyone they can message you or arrange

278
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:38,324
to have a one-on-one meeting at any time.

279
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:45,221
You do not get the privilege of not being interrupted.

280
00:15:45,221 --> 00:15:50,084
Part of your role is to be there when the writers need you.

281
00:15:50,084 --> 00:15:52,605
And if that means you have to work in fragments

282
00:15:52,605 --> 00:15:55,367
or catch up on things in your free time,

283
00:15:55,367 --> 00:16:00,130
well, cash the check and suck it up.

284
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,791
Don't be a dick doesn't need any explanation,

285
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,953
but it does sometimes need reiterating.

286
00:16:05,953 --> 00:16:07,214
So that's the ground rules.

287
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:08,915
Now let's look at the day to day.

288
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:15,758
In TV, the showrunner has the vision.

289
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:20,120
Everyone else's job is to interpret and support that vision

290
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,061
and work to make it a reality.

291
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:26,983
So a good showrunner communicates their vision to all staff

292
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:31,905
and everyone knows in which direction they're going.

293
00:16:31,905 --> 00:16:35,747
In games, as always, it's more complicated.

294
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:42,194
If you're also the game's creative director, narrative director, a senior producer, maybe

295
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:48,380
even the studio head, then yes, sure, you may well be the visionary and everyone dances

296
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,521
to the beat of your drum.

297
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:53,806
But let's face it, that is not the normal situation.

298
00:16:54,515 --> 00:17:06,738
Instead, you as head writer are more likely to be honoring someone else's vision, the creative director, a senior producer, the studio head, or maybe one person who is all of those things.

299
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:19,600
For the sake of simplicity, from here on, I'm going to refer to those people as the producers. Just take it as read that it might not literally be the case, but it's a convenient shorthand.

300
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:25,309
So your job as head writer is now to communicate

301
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:28,194
the producer's vision to the writer's room

302
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:29,836
and lead them in that direction.

303
00:17:29,836 --> 00:17:34,663
You are the bridge between the producers and the writers

304
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:38,028
in both directions, which I'll return to later.

305
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,829
So the first thing you should do is absorb the producer's vision.

306
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,351
Spend whatever time you can, perhaps while you're

307
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:49,154
interviewing candidates, going over all the existing

308
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:53,938
material for the project before you open the writer's room.

309
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:56,481
As head writer, it is vital that you

310
00:17:56,481 --> 00:17:58,643
know the material intimately.

311
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,707
In TV, that's easy because the showrunner normally

312
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:03,868
wrote the pilot script.

313
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:08,211
But in a game situation where someone else is the visionary

314
00:18:08,211 --> 00:18:10,552
or development is already underway,

315
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:12,814
you need to learn the material so

316
00:18:12,814 --> 00:18:16,536
that you can communicate the vision to the writing staff,

317
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:19,498
and they can trust that you're leading them

318
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:23,941
in the right direction.

319
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:26,603
Some days, the room will meet for several hours at a time.

320
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:37,255
Other days, everyone already has their assignments to get on with, but get into the habit of having a regular 10-minute check-in every day anyway, and do it at the same time every morning.

321
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:45,480
Now, if you're working in person, of course, this can be a stand-up. If you're working remotely, it's a virtual run, but make it a regular thing.

322
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:52,765
Just check what people are working on. Tell them if anything is coming up soon that they need to prepare for.

323
00:18:53,645 --> 00:18:57,229
Ask if there are any problems or blockers you can help deal with.

324
00:18:57,229 --> 00:19:01,112
Don't make it complex, but do it every day.

325
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:06,197
It builds the team's camaraderie and subtly reinforces that the working day has begun.

326
00:19:06,197 --> 00:19:12,883
On the days when you are holding a longer room, though, maybe even all day,

327
00:19:12,883 --> 00:19:18,208
then go in knowing what work needs to be done and who's going to do it.

328
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:23,988
If you walk into the writers room with no idea what you should all be doing today,

329
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:26,949
or what assignments you're going to hand out to your staff,

330
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:30,970
you will quickly lose their confidence and trust.

331
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,131
You will also inevitably find that you don't get much done,

332
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:40,113
because if there's one thing writers are really good at, it's not writing.

333
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:43,034
We all know the dangers of procrastination.

334
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:47,741
So on the days when you need to brainstorm ideas

335
00:19:47,741 --> 00:19:50,743
or break a story or hand out new assignments,

336
00:19:50,743 --> 00:19:54,086
you must prep before you open the room

337
00:19:54,086 --> 00:19:57,208
and know what you want to achieve.

338
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,770
I'm not talking about a detailed syllabus,

339
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,612
but just consider things like,

340
00:20:01,612 --> 00:20:03,713
do you want the room to brainstorm together?

341
00:20:03,713 --> 00:20:07,756
Do you want the room to break an outline together?

342
00:20:07,756 --> 00:20:11,099
Do you need to pass on feedback from the producers?

343
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:13,661
Do you need to pass on feedback from yourself?

344
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:17,710
Who should take and write up today's notes, if anyone?

345
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:22,695
What assignments do you have for everyone today?

346
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:24,217
If you can answer those questions,

347
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:26,499
if you can be clear about what you

348
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:29,162
want to achieve on any given day,

349
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:32,526
you will have good and productive sessions.

350
00:20:32,526 --> 00:20:36,030
Now, some of those things might take several days.

351
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:41,969
If you're brainstorming a core story arc and then need to break the outline beats as well,

352
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:46,993
that might be all you do for several days or even weeks at a time.

353
00:20:46,993 --> 00:20:51,537
That's okay, so long as you know that it's what you should be doing.

354
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:55,493
Another aspect of being a head writer

355
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:58,116
is to be the big brain of law.

356
00:20:58,116 --> 00:21:00,979
Your writers are busy focusing on their own assignments,

357
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:04,103
and it's up to you to take the wider view,

358
00:21:04,103 --> 00:21:08,908
to keep everything in check, and ensure they get the law right,

359
00:21:08,908 --> 00:21:12,212
as well as answer questions about that law from all sides,

360
00:21:12,212 --> 00:21:13,393
not just your writing staff.

361
00:21:14,418 --> 00:21:17,161
If the developer is using your wiki, Confluence, whatever,

362
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:20,666
then within it, carve out a space for narrative

363
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:21,827
to keep track of stuff.

364
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:24,450
Don't rely on remembering everything

365
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,872
because you have enough to do already.

366
00:21:25,872 --> 00:21:30,398
And along those lines, make a virtual inbox.

367
00:21:31,313 --> 00:21:34,094
Not an email inbox, but one for documents.

368
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:37,855
Make an area online, a folder on Google Drive or in Dropbox,

369
00:21:37,855 --> 00:21:42,537
whatever, that is only for you and the writing staff

370
00:21:42,537 --> 00:21:43,837
to upload all your drafts.

371
00:21:43,837 --> 00:21:45,518
Why somewhere separate?

372
00:21:45,518 --> 00:21:49,479
Because as head writer, you are going

373
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:55,341
to read everything before the producers even lay eyes on it.

374
00:21:56,477 --> 00:22:02,540
Sometimes you'll approve it right away, but most of the time it'll probably need some rewriting.

375
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:09,464
And non-writers have a habit of reading work in progress and assuming it's intended to be

376
00:22:09,464 --> 00:22:15,287
untouchable gospel. That can lead to a lot of frustration, so you can mitigate that

377
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:19,790
by making sure the producers only see work you've already approved.

378
00:22:21,921 --> 00:22:24,683
The other thing about a common repository

379
00:22:24,683 --> 00:22:28,186
is that it allows everyone in the writer's room

380
00:22:28,186 --> 00:22:29,867
to read each other's work.

381
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:32,129
Now, that can be intimidating to some, I know.

382
00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:35,671
But it is a really great way to build that sense of teamwork

383
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:39,034
in the room, not to mention maintain continuity

384
00:22:39,034 --> 00:22:42,476
and coherence without them having to consult you

385
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:44,478
over every single point of law.

386
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:55,023
Now let's talk more about direction and clarity.

387
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:58,267
You're trying to communicate the project vision to the writing

388
00:22:58,267 --> 00:23:00,589
staff so that you can all produce

389
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:05,835
consistent, coherent work that meets the producers' needs.

390
00:23:05,835 --> 00:23:09,700
To do that, you have to be clear about what you want from them.

391
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:13,494
Now, that doesn't mean you have to know the content of what

392
00:23:13,494 --> 00:23:14,594
you're trying to figure out.

393
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:16,976
If you're having a room brainstorming session,

394
00:23:16,976 --> 00:23:19,657
the whole point is to come up with new ideas

395
00:23:19,657 --> 00:23:21,778
you haven't thought of yet.

396
00:23:21,778 --> 00:23:25,480
But what you should know is the form and shape

397
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,341
of what you're trying to achieve.

398
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:31,663
Maybe the aim is to write a loose bullet point

399
00:23:31,663 --> 00:23:35,385
outline of one major story arc, or to drill down

400
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:36,945
into a character's backstory.

401
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:41,001
Or perhaps you've already done a bunch of brainstorming,

402
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:44,503
and now you need four character bios and the backstory

403
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:47,564
timeline of an enemy faction.

404
00:23:47,564 --> 00:23:50,506
These are all solid aims about which

405
00:23:50,506 --> 00:23:52,947
you can and should be clear.

406
00:23:52,947 --> 00:23:57,470
Tell the room what you want to achieve by the end of the day.

407
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,311
Tell them if there are any constraints.

408
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:03,958
If certain avenues are off limits or there's existing law,

409
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:06,579
but whatever you come up with mustn't contradict,

410
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:11,061
then set their imaginations free and let them have fun.

411
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:13,222
Guide them if you have to.

412
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:16,363
Keep them within whatever guardrails you set.

413
00:24:16,363 --> 00:24:20,665
And of course, contribute your own ideas as well.

414
00:24:20,665 --> 00:24:25,327
But don't be shy about telling your staff what you expect to get done.

415
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,551
That goes for writing assignments too.

416
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,815
When you hand out assignments, tell them

417
00:24:31,815 --> 00:24:34,317
what you need back from them.

418
00:24:34,317 --> 00:24:38,181
Do you expect 1,000 words of lore text written out

419
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:39,122
in a Google Doc?

420
00:24:39,122 --> 00:24:43,526
Or do you want a character bio as a 10-slide deck,

421
00:24:43,526 --> 00:24:44,787
including key dates?

422
00:24:45,763 --> 00:24:48,085
Don't be afraid to make templates

423
00:24:48,085 --> 00:24:49,285
where they'll be useful.

424
00:24:49,285 --> 00:24:52,046
If you need, say, character bios to be laid out

425
00:24:52,046 --> 00:24:56,488
in a specific format with consistent information in each,

426
00:24:56,488 --> 00:24:59,890
produce a sample and give everyone a copy to work from.

427
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:03,952
If you're reluctant to do that because it feels limiting,

428
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:07,193
remember, you're not limiting their creativity.

429
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:11,827
you're making sure that creativity isn't wasted

430
00:25:11,827 --> 00:25:15,971
by making them reinvent the wheel

431
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:20,715
or try to read your mind every time they hand in a document.

432
00:25:20,715 --> 00:25:22,276
We are not mind readers.

433
00:25:22,276 --> 00:25:26,000
Isn't that the cry of exasperated writers everywhere

434
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,802
when producers are vague with us?

435
00:25:28,802 --> 00:25:30,524
Be better than that.

436
00:25:30,524 --> 00:25:32,726
Be better for your writers.

437
00:25:34,135 --> 00:25:38,036
Be clear about what you want them to deliver back to you,

438
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,117
but within that shape, that form,

439
00:25:41,117 --> 00:25:45,779
give them freedom to express their creativity.

440
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:49,200
You hired these writers because you liked their work,

441
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,820
so let them work.

442
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,182
As a rule of thumb, always give your staff

443
00:25:54,182 --> 00:25:58,766
as much creative freedom as possible on first drafts.

444
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:03,009
You can always ask for revisions or even rewrite it yourself

445
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:06,752
if it's just too zany or doesn't quite fit what you need.

446
00:26:06,752 --> 00:26:10,795
But giving your writers that initial freedom

447
00:26:10,795 --> 00:26:13,197
will keep them motivated.

448
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:17,240
And sometimes those zany, unpredictable ideas

449
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,841
turn out to be the ones worth keeping.

450
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:23,429
So now let's talk about one of the main strengths

451
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:25,771
of a writer's room and something that any project

452
00:26:25,771 --> 00:26:27,772
with a decent narrative component

453
00:26:27,772 --> 00:26:30,215
will need, breaking story.

454
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:36,500
Now, not all sessions are the same.

455
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,604
Sometimes you need to simply brainstorm,

456
00:26:40,604 --> 00:26:42,866
throwing out ideas until something sticks.

457
00:26:43,622 --> 00:26:48,229
Sometimes you'll have already done that or you'll be working with existing ideas,

458
00:26:48,229 --> 00:26:53,057
but now you need to mold those ideas into the bullet points of a story and so on.

459
00:26:54,544 --> 00:26:57,446
Whether you're figuring out a plot, a timeline,

460
00:26:57,446 --> 00:27:00,307
a story arc, a character backstory,

461
00:27:00,307 --> 00:27:02,389
a fantasy religion, a sci-fi society,

462
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:07,092
that is where the writer's room shines.

463
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,133
Bringing the collective imaginations

464
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:11,854
of the writers together to collaborate,

465
00:27:11,854 --> 00:27:15,537
generate ideas, and come up with solutions

466
00:27:15,537 --> 00:27:17,798
and concepts that none of you,

467
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:20,560
not even you or I, would have achieved alone.

468
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,021
These are things.

469
00:27:24,286 --> 00:27:31,108
you simply can't do as easily in Slack or over email. And it's a lot of fun throwing out ideas

470
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:38,110
and seeing everyone build on top of them, being inspired by a chance notion from someone else's

471
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:45,593
pitch, projecting ahead to imagine if this idea will work or that idea will cause problems,

472
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:51,995
whether in person or virtually, the writer's room is where this creativity is elevated to produce

473
00:27:51,995 --> 00:27:53,055
amazing results.

474
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:58,313
But room sessions like this can also be chaotic.

475
00:27:58,313 --> 00:28:02,315
And that's why it's important to lead the room,

476
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:06,717
to take your role as head writer seriously.

477
00:28:06,717 --> 00:28:09,859
Here are some of the things you can do

478
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:13,621
to make the room run smoothly.

479
00:28:13,621 --> 00:28:16,022
First, someone must take notes.

480
00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:19,766
Now, in a TV room, that is generally the role

481
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:21,166
of the most junior staffer,

482
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,606
often called the writer's assistant

483
00:28:22,606 --> 00:28:24,567
or the writing assistant.

484
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:26,327
Literally, almost their entire job

485
00:28:26,327 --> 00:28:28,548
is to take notes of everything discussed

486
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:30,988
and then type them up and email them around

487
00:28:30,988 --> 00:28:33,148
to the writing staff.

488
00:28:33,148 --> 00:28:36,009
If you have the budget for that, knock yourself out.

489
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:39,130
It could be a great position for an inexperienced writer,

490
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:42,910
a way to give someone a foothold in the industry.

491
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,571
But realistically, most game budgets won't pay for that.

492
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:52,135
So instead, have the session notes taken by whoever's going to write up the results.

493
00:28:52,135 --> 00:28:58,617
If today's session is breaking a story arc and you know that it's Carlos who'll be writing up

494
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:06,179
the final version of this document, get Carlos to take the notes. We all take notes differently.

495
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:12,181
My notes probably won't make much sense to you or yours to me, so whoever needs to refer to them

496
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:13,582
should make them.

497
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:17,788
Now, taking notes while also contributing

498
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:19,469
is something of a skill.

499
00:29:19,469 --> 00:29:22,011
So make sure the room doesn't run away too much

500
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:24,554
while poor Carlos is trying to scribble things down.

501
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,977
You can help them by, every so often,

502
00:29:27,977 --> 00:29:31,400
and especially at the end, summarizing the story points

503
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,122
you've landed on so far.

504
00:29:33,122 --> 00:29:36,585
That will also help cement it in everyone else's minds,

505
00:29:36,585 --> 00:29:39,468
which can be valuable for law and continuity.

506
00:29:41,306 --> 00:29:46,107
What if several writers are going to be working up different materials from the same session?

507
00:29:46,107 --> 00:29:51,849
Say you're brainstorming ideas for a faction's backstory and you want one writer to type up the

508
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:59,571
backstory and two others to create bios of faction characters. Well, now everyone needs to take the

509
00:29:59,571 --> 00:30:05,753
notes that are relevant to them, whether that's the backstory, character ideas, or whatever.

510
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:09,830
And remember that the person I'm talking about here,

511
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:13,092
the one who needs to make notes because they're writing it up,

512
00:30:13,092 --> 00:30:14,873
that might be you.

513
00:30:14,873 --> 00:30:16,834
Just because you're the boss doesn't

514
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:20,575
mean you're above taking notes if what you're brainstorming

515
00:30:20,575 --> 00:30:23,197
is something over which you have ownership.

516
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:28,679
Keep in mind the aims of the session as well.

517
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,061
This is where you sometimes have to be the party pooper.

518
00:30:33,368 --> 00:30:39,432
In a writer's room, there will always be tangents, divergences, bad jokes,

519
00:30:39,432 --> 00:30:44,835
chatter about last night's TV, whatever. That is normal and it's fine. And sometimes it's

520
00:30:44,835 --> 00:30:50,018
even valuable because it can spark ideas that are relevant to the session.

521
00:30:50,018 --> 00:30:52,760
But you cannot let it dominate the conversation.

522
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,244
At some point, and often sooner rather than later,

523
00:30:57,244 --> 00:31:01,728
you must get the session back on track and refocus everyone's minds

524
00:31:01,728 --> 00:31:06,372
on the story content you're actually trying to figure out.

525
00:31:06,372 --> 00:31:11,357
Don't just tell people to shut up, but remember that your job is to lead everyone

526
00:31:11,357 --> 00:31:15,040
over those mountains, and you can't do that if every five minutes

527
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,042
they wander off the path completely.

528
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:27,204
By contrast, though, be careful not to dominate the conversation yourself.

529
00:31:27,204 --> 00:31:30,866
Put your ego aside and let other people have the big ideas.

530
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:34,948
This is easier said than done, I know.

531
00:31:34,948 --> 00:31:38,429
If you're the head writer, then chances are you're the most experienced person

532
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:42,291
in that room and you're being paid more than everyone else.

533
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:45,133
It is natural, therefore, to think that you must be the one

534
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:48,655
who has all the great ideas and who contributes the most.

535
00:31:50,157 --> 00:31:56,178
But running a room well means having the confidence and wisdom to not do that,

536
00:31:56,178 --> 00:32:03,300
and to let others find their way to things you sometimes might already know.

537
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:08,961
You're in a unique position because your relationship with the producers

538
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:12,642
means you literally know more than everyone else in the room.

539
00:32:12,642 --> 00:32:17,083
But again, you hired these people for their skills and imaginations.

540
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:19,683
So sit back and let them use them.

541
00:32:21,078 --> 00:32:29,900
At times, that means someone else will have a big idea that makes a significant contribution to the project.

542
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,320
That's great.

543
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,581
Don't let your ego be jealous that someone else had that idea.

544
00:32:34,581 --> 00:32:40,283
Instead, be proud that the idea came out of your writer's room,

545
00:32:40,283 --> 00:32:44,644
because the truth is when your staff look good, you look good.

546
00:32:44,644 --> 00:32:49,265
If someone is working through an idea out loud and you have a solution, wait.

547
00:32:49,975 --> 00:32:56,778
Let them finish their train of thought. And if they still need a solution, sure, speak up. But if

548
00:32:56,778 --> 00:33:02,501
instead they land on their own solution, and you might be surprised how often it's the same idea

549
00:33:02,501 --> 00:33:10,465
you had, let them own it. Give them that moment. Tell them what a great idea it is. It's good for

550
00:33:10,465 --> 00:33:16,848
morale. It encourages your staff to continue coming up with great ideas. And you still look

551
00:33:16,848 --> 00:33:19,170
like a genius because it happened on your watch.

552
00:33:21,781 --> 00:33:27,643
Along similar lines, you should also make sure veteran writers don't dominate the conversation.

553
00:33:27,643 --> 00:33:32,044
Encourage young and new writers to contribute, especially in the early days.

554
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:39,487
It is very easy for inexperienced writers to feel overwhelmed when they walk into a writer's room

555
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:43,168
and find themselves sitting across from well-known writers,

556
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:47,190
perhaps even people who made games the young writer has played and admired.

557
00:33:48,663 --> 00:33:51,648
Now, let's be clear, none of us is that famous,

558
00:33:51,648 --> 00:33:54,292
and if you think you are, get over yourself.

559
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:58,017
But new writers can still feel like they have less to offer

560
00:33:58,017 --> 00:33:59,600
or that they should be quiet

561
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,503
when the big-name writer is talking.

562
00:34:02,855 --> 00:34:08,260
If you see this happening, turn to them. Don't make a big deal of it and call them out.

563
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,744
They'll be mortified and clam up even harder. But just say something like,

564
00:34:12,744 --> 00:34:18,249
Jenny, we haven't heard from you on this subject yet. What are your thoughts? Don't make it a yes

565
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:25,116
or no question. Invite them to put forward their opinions and ideas. Make it clear that you want

566
00:34:25,116 --> 00:34:28,719
them to speak and you value their contribution.

567
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:34,882
Finally, remember that these sessions can be mentally exhausting.

568
00:34:35,652 --> 00:34:42,816
If you're doing an all-day session, take a full lunch hour at some point and keep an eye on everyone's energy levels.

569
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:48,559
If you're all flagging and punch drunk by three in the afternoon, just call it a day.

570
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:56,604
Tired people do not have great ideas, and keeping everyone in the room for the sake of an arbitrary clock is a bad idea.

571
00:34:56,604 --> 00:35:02,547
Better to call it a day and let everyone return next morning fully refreshed and ready to go again.

572
00:35:06,912 --> 00:35:09,673
Produce consistent, unified material.

573
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:12,693
Now, remember I said that you won't actually be originating

574
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,714
that much material.

575
00:35:14,714 --> 00:35:16,334
Here's why.

576
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:19,635
First, if you hired right, you'll

577
00:35:19,635 --> 00:35:23,496
already have an idea of each writer's skills, strengths,

578
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,096
and weaknesses.

579
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:27,337
Those will become more apparent over time, too,

580
00:35:27,337 --> 00:35:30,917
and you'll start to recognize how to get the best

581
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:32,338
work out of your staff.

582
00:35:33,372 --> 00:35:37,718
One writer might be great at generating raw ideas,

583
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,922
but their execution of those ideas maybe isn't so hot.

584
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:45,108
But by contrast, you may have a writer who's quiet

585
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:46,430
when it comes to the ideas,

586
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:49,013
but he's great at taking someone else's

587
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,676
and really working through the world logic.

588
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:58,546
Some writers have trouble staying inside the lines of an assignment and need to be reminded

589
00:35:58,546 --> 00:36:04,008
what the parameters are. Others might need to hear the brief two or three times before

590
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:07,289
they fully grok it, but once they do, they are off and away.

591
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:12,894
All of these are valuable and useful.

592
00:36:12,894 --> 00:36:15,874
None of us is the perfect all-around writer.

593
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:18,295
And frankly, I don't think such a person exists.

594
00:36:18,295 --> 00:36:22,876
The key with every writer's room is balancing those skills,

595
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:27,277
habits, and tendencies so that the room collectively

596
00:36:27,277 --> 00:36:33,219
becomes that unified, harmonious, fully-rounded writer.

597
00:36:33,219 --> 00:36:37,780
So if you realize Jenny is great at creating alien races,

598
00:36:38,743 --> 00:36:40,804
give her ownership of that area.

599
00:36:40,804 --> 00:36:45,288
If Russell excels at writing in-character viewpoint pieces,

600
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:48,010
getting to do more, it's a no-brainer.

601
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:48,070
But.

602
00:36:51,014 --> 00:36:56,598
Every now and then, don't be afraid to throw people a curveball and challenge their creativity.

603
00:36:56,598 --> 00:37:03,903
Give them assignments outside their creative comfort zone. Doing this helps your writers

604
00:37:03,903 --> 00:37:08,767
grow. It gives them confidence and helps them develop, and they will repay that to you

605
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:13,790
in trust and motivation. But it's not only about personal development.

606
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:17,520
Giving an assignment to someone who doesn't normally

607
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,821
do that sort of thing really can deliver a fresh perspective.

608
00:37:21,821 --> 00:37:24,762
They will come up with ideas that someone

609
00:37:24,762 --> 00:37:30,284
more familiar with their area maybe wouldn't have.

610
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:31,905
So now let's talk about rewriting,

611
00:37:31,905 --> 00:37:35,246
which is fundamental to the philosophy of a writer's room.

612
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:40,164
You may not realize it, but almost every episode of TV

613
00:37:40,164 --> 00:37:46,389
you watch has been rewritten to some extent by the showrunner.

614
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,751
The reason you may not realize it

615
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:52,113
is that showrunners rarely take credit for those rewrites.

616
00:37:52,113 --> 00:37:54,975
We'll return to that in a moment.

617
00:37:54,975 --> 00:37:56,616
Why do they rewrite?

618
00:37:56,616 --> 00:38:00,919
Because a TV show must be coherent from week to week

619
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:02,661
and consistent in its vision.

620
00:38:03,442 --> 00:38:05,882
And this is very applicable to games.

621
00:38:05,882 --> 00:38:10,264
Most of the time, we're producing large amounts of material

622
00:38:10,264 --> 00:38:12,944
that can appear in many different places,

623
00:38:12,944 --> 00:38:16,245
often in a variety of sequences and orders,

624
00:38:16,245 --> 00:38:18,746
but featuring many of the same characters.

625
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:22,607
It is vital that if Carlos writes one scene

626
00:38:22,607 --> 00:38:24,027
and Jenny writes another,

627
00:38:24,027 --> 00:38:27,348
that they feel tonally and stylistically similar.

628
00:38:28,903 --> 00:38:30,864
Now, you might say, well, just tell everyone

629
00:38:30,864 --> 00:38:32,584
to write the same way to begin with.

630
00:38:32,584 --> 00:38:35,346
But that's difficult. It's not especially realistic.

631
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,227
And remember, the best rooms are filled

632
00:38:38,227 --> 00:38:41,729
with writers of very different styles and approaches.

633
00:38:41,729 --> 00:38:44,930
You don't want everyone to write in exactly the same way.

634
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:48,992
But that does mean, if you put Carlos and Jenny's work

635
00:38:48,992 --> 00:38:51,453
side by side, you can probably tell it was

636
00:38:51,453 --> 00:38:53,374
written by two different people.

637
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:55,435
And that's where you come in.

638
00:38:57,222 --> 00:38:59,925
One of the head writer's most important tasks

639
00:38:59,925 --> 00:39:03,008
is to potentially rewrite everything

640
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:06,131
before it goes to the producers, not just

641
00:39:06,131 --> 00:39:08,353
to fix typos or errors in the law,

642
00:39:08,353 --> 00:39:10,895
but to make sure all the material has

643
00:39:10,895 --> 00:39:15,160
a consistent tone and style that fits the creative vision.

644
00:39:16,274 --> 00:39:20,458
By doing so, you lift that burden away from your writing staff.

645
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:25,924
You free them to be creative and fearless because you're their safety net.

646
00:39:25,924 --> 00:39:30,889
If they write something that doesn't fit, you simply won't let it go to the producers.

647
00:39:30,889 --> 00:39:34,753
You'll either tell them to rewrite it or you'll rewrite it yourself.

648
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,080
Now, let's be clear.

649
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,862
You should not wield what we call a heavy pen.

650
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:43,344
Don't rewrite material just because it's not exactly

651
00:39:43,344 --> 00:39:44,644
what you would have written.

652
00:39:44,644 --> 00:39:47,646
You must let your staff express themselves creatively.

653
00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:50,788
If there are strict content requirements,

654
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,409
hammer those out in the room beforehand

655
00:39:52,409 --> 00:39:55,370
and make them part of the assignment brief.

656
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:58,512
If the writer still hasn't followed that brief, sure,

657
00:39:58,512 --> 00:40:00,453
send it back to them with notes.

658
00:40:00,453 --> 00:40:02,434
But if they have done what's required,

659
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:05,116
just in a different way to how you would have done it,

660
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:05,476
leave it be.

661
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,655
What you should rewrite, apart from those law errors

662
00:40:09,655 --> 00:40:13,338
and typos, obviously, are things like character voice and lingo,

663
00:40:13,338 --> 00:40:16,982
especially if the material is final VO scripts,

664
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:19,484
to ensure that everything really is consistent.

665
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:23,248
But before you reach that stage when you're world building,

666
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:26,631
writing bios, internal law documents, and so on,

667
00:40:26,631 --> 00:40:28,052
try to keep a light touch.

668
00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:32,187
So when should you send it back to a writer?

669
00:40:32,187 --> 00:40:34,690
And when should you rewrite it yourself?

670
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,711
Well, like I said, if they literally

671
00:40:36,711 --> 00:40:39,254
haven't followed the brief correctly, of course,

672
00:40:39,254 --> 00:40:41,496
hand it back to the writer with notes.

673
00:40:41,496 --> 00:40:43,938
But don't automatically absolve yourself either.

674
00:40:43,938 --> 00:40:47,141
Now that you have their first draft in front of you,

675
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:50,384
you may realize the assignment wasn't clear enough.

676
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:52,065
And now that you know where the problem is,

677
00:40:52,065 --> 00:40:53,787
you can be a lot more specific.

678
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:56,149
That happens more often than you might think.

679
00:40:57,892 --> 00:41:01,214
When the material is at a stage that it's broadly fine,

680
00:41:01,214 --> 00:41:03,935
whether that's the first draft or the third,

681
00:41:03,935 --> 00:41:06,336
and now it really does only need to be fixed

682
00:41:06,336 --> 00:41:07,337
for voice and style,

683
00:41:07,337 --> 00:41:12,379
that is when you should get in there and do your rewrites.

684
00:41:12,379 --> 00:41:15,540
You can imagine that trust is a big part of this process.

685
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,421
Your writers have to trust

686
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:20,663
that you're not gonna simply rewrite all of the material

687
00:41:20,663 --> 00:41:22,964
from the ground up just for the sake of it.

688
00:41:22,964 --> 00:41:24,705
Not that you have the time to do that anyway.

689
00:41:26,363 --> 00:41:31,829
One way to build this trust is by sharing your finished edits with the writer.

690
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:34,071
Let them see your rewrite.

691
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:36,774
It gives them a better handle on what it was you wanted.

692
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,326
which will help them in delivering future assignments

693
00:41:40,326 --> 00:41:42,466
and over time reduce the need for you

694
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,667
to rewrite in the first place,

695
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:48,448
but it also shows that you trust them and their work.

696
00:41:48,448 --> 00:41:51,730
They will see that you're respecting their creativity

697
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,170
and have got their back

698
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:56,992
because your rewrites are simply ensuring their work

699
00:41:56,992 --> 00:41:58,812
is presented in the best light possible.

700
00:42:03,424 --> 00:42:08,747
Now, remember I said that most TV showrunners don't take credit for their rewrites,

701
00:42:08,747 --> 00:42:11,649
even though their fingerprints are on every script?

702
00:42:11,649 --> 00:42:16,112
Do you remember I also said that when your staff look good, you look good?

703
00:42:16,112 --> 00:42:22,215
Well, there's your equation. There are a few showrunners who take that credit,

704
00:42:22,215 --> 00:42:26,878
and they're often the ones nobody likes working for. Don't be that person.

705
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:31,761
Remember, even if you're not the project's main visionary, you are the head writer.

706
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:38,769
Your final credit on the game will probably be head writer or lead writer or narrative lead or

707
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:46,472
something equally senior. And inside the writer's room, you are the visionary. You are in charge of

708
00:42:46,472 --> 00:42:53,155
and responsible for everything that comes out of the room. Everyone understands that, whether it's

709
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:59,057
officially recognized or not. And all of this means you can be magnanimous.

710
00:42:59,935 --> 00:43:06,862
You don't need to take credit for every single word, even if you've rewritten it extensively,

711
00:43:06,862 --> 00:43:14,309
because it came out of your rum. It all reflects on you anyway. That's how leadership works.

712
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:18,233
And this too is not all altruistic. It's also insurance.

713
00:43:19,282 --> 00:43:21,782
There will be times when things are going badly,

714
00:43:21,782 --> 00:43:24,023
when the project looks like it's falling apart,

715
00:43:24,023 --> 00:43:26,384
or you're given an impossible deadline,

716
00:43:26,384 --> 00:43:29,845
or even face pushback from other departments.

717
00:43:29,845 --> 00:43:32,725
Times when you all have to pull together,

718
00:43:32,725 --> 00:43:35,406
and you may even need the support and backing

719
00:43:35,406 --> 00:43:37,647
of your writing staff.

720
00:43:37,647 --> 00:43:39,707
And if you've been a credit hogging dick,

721
00:43:39,707 --> 00:43:40,728
well, good luck with that.

722
00:43:42,055 --> 00:43:43,816
But if you've supported your writers

723
00:43:43,816 --> 00:43:46,637
and given them shout outs when you were on top,

724
00:43:46,637 --> 00:43:48,838
they'll remember that and fight for you.

725
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:52,580
You can't buy that with a contract.

726
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,700
So give your staff the credit.

727
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,041
Let them take the compliments.

728
00:43:57,041 --> 00:44:00,303
Be known as a generous head writer

729
00:44:00,303 --> 00:44:02,964
whom people want to work for.

730
00:44:02,964 --> 00:44:06,525
Let your room be the envy of the industry.

731
00:44:07,972 --> 00:44:12,914
and let the producers marvel at the quality of your room

732
00:44:12,914 --> 00:44:19,296
because you have endeavored to meet the producer's needs.

733
00:44:19,296 --> 00:44:21,516
Another foundational part of a writer's room

734
00:44:21,516 --> 00:44:23,997
is your relationship with the producers.

735
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:25,537
Now, remember here that I'm using producers

736
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,858
as a catch-all term for everyone

737
00:44:27,858 --> 00:44:29,378
who isn't in the writer's room,

738
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:31,319
but is in some position of authority.

739
00:44:33,035 --> 00:44:37,779
Most of the time you will act as that bridge I mentioned earlier between the producers and your

740
00:44:37,779 --> 00:44:43,924
writing staff. You meet with the producers, you establish their needs, you return to the room

741
00:44:43,924 --> 00:44:50,029
and fulfill those needs by handing out assignments to the writers. Then you take and review their

742
00:44:50,029 --> 00:44:55,093
material, send it to the producers and go meet with them and the cycle begins again.

743
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:59,151
This means you're living in two camps.

744
00:44:59,151 --> 00:45:01,432
And to an extent, you must play the politician,

745
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:06,735
trying to satisfy both sides and weigh up the best way forward.

746
00:45:06,735 --> 00:45:09,116
When you meet with the producers,

747
00:45:09,116 --> 00:45:11,958
you are representing the writers room.

748
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:16,160
You have to walk a careful line between the pragmatism

749
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,202
of what's in the best interests of the project

750
00:45:19,202 --> 00:45:22,764
and protecting the creative integrity of your writing

751
00:45:22,764 --> 00:45:23,104
staff.

752
00:45:24,419 --> 00:45:31,263
What this means is that you should advocate for your writer's work as if it were your own.

753
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:35,785
Remember, nothing leaves the room without first crossing your desk.

754
00:45:35,785 --> 00:45:43,810
You must have full confidence in everyone's material so that you can explain and defend it as if you've written it yourself.

755
00:45:45,114 --> 00:45:48,495
If there appear to be cracks in the armor, as it were,

756
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:52,236
if the producers sense that the room isn't unified

757
00:45:52,236 --> 00:45:54,736
or you don't have confidence in your staff,

758
00:45:54,736 --> 00:45:56,856
it will diminish their trust in you

759
00:45:56,856 --> 00:46:01,497
and their confidence in the work coming out of your room.

760
00:46:01,497 --> 00:46:05,718
Then, in reverse, when you have new feedback and assignments

761
00:46:05,718 --> 00:46:08,079
from the producers, you must present these

762
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,560
to the writing staff as if the producers' aims are your own.

763
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:20,568
Sometimes you and the producers will have argued about those aims and you might have lost that argument.

764
00:46:20,568 --> 00:46:24,631
But just like advocating for your staff's work as if it were your own,

765
00:46:24,631 --> 00:46:28,394
you must also present the producer's vision as if it was yours.

766
00:46:28,394 --> 00:46:36,700
Again, if your staff sense that's not the case, if they can tell you don't really believe in the notes you're giving

767
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,382
or the direction in which you're leading them, they won't give you their best work.

768
00:46:42,004 --> 00:46:49,533
Part of your role as head writer is to insulate your staff from politics, from whatever internal

769
00:46:49,533 --> 00:46:55,240
conflict may be going on between the producers, because let's be honest, there will be,

770
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:00,767
so that the writers can just get their heads down, unleash their imaginations and write.

771
00:47:03,943 --> 00:47:06,724
None of this is easy, by the way.

772
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:10,025
Being able to present other people's work or notes

773
00:47:10,025 --> 00:47:13,066
as enthusiastically as if they were your own

774
00:47:13,066 --> 00:47:16,888
is not part of a creator's everyday skill set.

775
00:47:16,888 --> 00:47:21,349
But it is something you will need to learn in your role

776
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:22,129
as a head writer.

777
00:47:22,129 --> 00:47:25,690
A good mantra to keep in mind in all of these situations

778
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:28,631
is one that I followed for many years.

779
00:47:28,631 --> 00:47:30,832
Defend your ideas vigorously.

780
00:47:32,551 --> 00:47:36,114
but recognize when someone else has a better idea.

781
00:47:36,114 --> 00:47:39,117
I find that's a good rule of thumb

782
00:47:39,117 --> 00:47:41,138
for life in general, to be honest.

783
00:47:41,138 --> 00:47:45,082
Finally then, the big question

784
00:47:45,082 --> 00:47:47,544
as far as producers are concerned, is it worth it?

785
00:47:47,544 --> 00:47:50,146
Well, it would be a funny old thing

786
00:47:50,146 --> 00:47:53,789
if I'd sat here for an hour talking about this

787
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:56,772
and then told you not to bother.

788
00:47:56,772 --> 00:47:58,213
So yes, of course I think it's worth it.

789
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:07,412
But let me explain why in terms producers will understand.

790
00:48:07,412 --> 00:48:09,873
I mean, it's true, though.

791
00:48:09,873 --> 00:48:11,414
Now, don't misunderstand me.

792
00:48:11,414 --> 00:48:13,715
It's not always cheap in absolute terms,

793
00:48:13,715 --> 00:48:16,996
and you should always pay writers well.

794
00:48:16,996 --> 00:48:22,978
But writers rooms bring a huge return on investment.

795
00:48:22,978 --> 00:48:25,099
Let's say you're the narrative lead on a AAA.

796
00:48:26,105 --> 00:48:33,251
You can hire four veteran, highly experienced freelance writers for a room for somewhere

797
00:48:33,251 --> 00:48:37,755
between $50,000 to $60,000 per month and get 80 working days out of it.

798
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:42,653
If you run that room for six months, that is 480 days.

799
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,975
And let's allow for some slack and round it down to 450.

800
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:50,879
That's still an enormous amount of work for 300k.

801
00:48:50,879 --> 00:48:56,343
And remember, that's for a room filled with veteran writers.

802
00:48:56,343 --> 00:48:59,185
If you spread out the experience levels,

803
00:48:59,185 --> 00:49:02,768
you can do the same for more like 200, 250k.

804
00:49:03,728 --> 00:49:08,870
Now, if you're a AAA release, that is not a large amount of money.

805
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:13,292
And yet, think of how much quality work you'll get out of it.

806
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:18,273
There are more than a few titles where that's enough to literally write the whole game from

807
00:49:18,273 --> 00:49:21,354
start to finish. Now, that's AAA.

808
00:49:21,354 --> 00:49:27,476
But even if you're a smaller title, you could build a room of three writers who work two days

809
00:49:27,476 --> 00:49:33,138
per week for a month and get 24 combined days of work out of them for around 30 grand.

810
00:49:34,132 --> 00:49:37,235
Now, like I said, I know that's not nothing,

811
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:41,038
but you'll get better work than you would from a single writer.

812
00:49:41,038 --> 00:49:43,240
You'll get much more of it.

813
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,082
And if you build the room right, you

814
00:49:46,082 --> 00:49:48,484
will even help give younger writers a leg up

815
00:49:48,484 --> 00:49:49,665
into the business.

816
00:49:49,665 --> 00:49:54,068
If your project has a significant narrative element,

817
00:49:54,068 --> 00:49:55,109
this is a no-brainer.

818
00:49:57,616 --> 00:49:59,837
And what about from the writer's perspective?

819
00:49:59,837 --> 00:50:03,538
Why should we as senior writers in this industry

820
00:50:03,538 --> 00:50:05,058
advocate for it?

821
00:50:05,058 --> 00:50:08,919
Well, quite simply, because a good, well-run writer's room

822
00:50:08,919 --> 00:50:14,021
both produces good work and builds a camaraderie

823
00:50:14,021 --> 00:50:16,701
that means less churn and less turnover

824
00:50:16,701 --> 00:50:19,022
in your writing staff, even the freelancers.

825
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,271
If you're working on a large project,

826
00:50:22,271 --> 00:50:26,072
then maintaining a core writer's room throughout the process

827
00:50:26,072 --> 00:50:29,854
will keep your writers engaged and loyal,

828
00:50:29,854 --> 00:50:32,615
and certainly only make your game's narrative better.

829
00:50:32,615 --> 00:50:32,655
So.

830
00:50:36,935 --> 00:50:39,355
This is a lot to take in, and it's a lot to do.

831
00:50:39,355 --> 00:50:42,916
Head writers have a lot on their plate

832
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:44,337
and a lot of responsibility.

833
00:50:44,337 --> 00:50:48,078
Staff the room, run the room, interpret the vision,

834
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:51,459
relay the vision, lead story-breaking sessions,

835
00:50:51,459 --> 00:50:53,920
maintain the lore, hand out assignments,

836
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,280
check and rewrite work, give notes, answer questions,

837
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,081
deal with the producers, deal with problems,

838
00:50:59,081 --> 00:51:00,562
tap dance backwards in heels,

839
00:51:00,562 --> 00:51:03,963
and do it all with a smile on your face.

840
00:51:03,963 --> 00:51:06,163
But that's the gig.

841
00:51:07,403 --> 00:51:10,405
As head writer, you get to bask in the glory

842
00:51:10,405 --> 00:51:14,386
and take the credit while having fun into the bargain.

843
00:51:14,386 --> 00:51:15,667
Now, I don't know about you,

844
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:18,147
but that is a trade-off I'm willing to make.

845
00:51:18,147 --> 00:51:23,149
I sincerely believe that the writer's remodel

846
00:51:23,149 --> 00:51:26,190
will become increasingly common for games

847
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:27,991
over the next five to 10 years,

848
00:51:27,991 --> 00:51:32,573
and may even soon become the standard on major titles.

849
00:51:34,028 --> 00:51:42,689
We have an opportunity to set that standard, to define the template, to establish how these

850
00:51:42,689 --> 00:51:52,631
rooms work and operate. We can teach future generations how to do it well and how to foster

851
00:51:52,631 --> 00:51:59,053
a positive work environment filled with creativity and imagination to collectively

852
00:51:59,053 --> 00:52:03,633
write better work than any of us could do by ourselves.

853
00:52:05,015 --> 00:52:09,186
All it takes is for us to stand up and run the room.

854
00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:11,793
Thank you.

855
00:52:17,198 --> 00:52:20,941
Now, before we get to Q&A, I want to give thanks

856
00:52:20,941 --> 00:52:24,204
to Harvey Greer-Markswatch, a TV writer and producer

857
00:52:24,204 --> 00:52:27,066
who advocates for good, healthy writers' rooms

858
00:52:27,066 --> 00:52:28,427
in that industry.

859
00:52:28,427 --> 00:52:30,949
He makes a podcast called Children of Tendu

860
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:33,471
with Jose Molina, and he also wrote a polemic

861
00:52:33,471 --> 00:52:35,672
called The 11 Laws of Showrunning,

862
00:52:35,672 --> 00:52:39,235
both of which have been useful to me on this subject,

863
00:52:39,235 --> 00:52:41,917
so you should definitely check them out yourselves.

864
00:52:42,557 --> 00:52:48,831
So again, thank you all for coming. And I think we've got seven or eight minutes for Q&A. So let's go for it.

865
00:52:51,275 --> 00:52:54,438
So we have one question from the chat.

866
00:52:54,438 --> 00:52:58,101
In an industry where story has been historically relegated

867
00:52:58,101 --> 00:53:01,784
as secondary or even tertiary to core gameplay mechanics,

868
00:53:01,784 --> 00:53:04,566
such as level design, big money set pieces,

869
00:53:04,566 --> 00:53:08,389
and bottom line numbers, how do we advocate for the importance

870
00:53:08,389 --> 00:53:10,611
of a strong writer's room or team

871
00:53:10,611 --> 00:53:13,033
when audiences indeed demand

872
00:53:13,033 --> 00:53:15,395
and expect mature story-driven games?

873
00:53:17,037 --> 00:53:21,673
Well, I think the answer to that, the key to that is the second part of the question.

874
00:53:21,673 --> 00:53:23,198
We know that.

875
00:53:24,014 --> 00:53:30,698
the audience and reviewers highly value the stories in games.

876
00:53:30,698 --> 00:53:34,440
It's, you know, a source of rating.

877
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,342
It's something that is taken into account a lot

878
00:53:38,342 --> 00:53:40,623
when giving scores, you know,

879
00:53:40,623 --> 00:53:43,405
that all-important Metacritic.

880
00:53:43,405 --> 00:53:46,486
So that's really a question of advocating in general

881
00:53:46,486 --> 00:53:48,828
for the importance of narrative.

882
00:53:50,028 --> 00:54:05,379
With regards to writers' rooms, as I've just talked about here, within narrative, I think they're a great way, especially for larger projects, to really get a lot of value out of a group of writers.

883
00:54:05,379 --> 00:54:08,662
But the bigger question is always...

884
00:54:09,585 --> 00:54:13,006
making other people realize that game narrative is important.

885
00:54:13,006 --> 00:54:16,127
I mean, that's a battle that we've been fighting for 20 years

886
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,888
and we'll fight for 20 more, I'm sure.

887
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:22,210
But yeah, you know, the point to the review scores

888
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:23,930
and the comments and reviews

889
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:27,311
and remind people that they always talk about the story.

890
00:54:27,652 --> 00:54:36,577
You know? I mean, Last of Us 2 is a great game, but the story is what most people talk about when they review that game, or even fans when they discuss it.

891
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:44,721
Even though, you know, everything else about the game is great as well, it's the story that really made headlines.

892
00:54:44,721 --> 00:54:49,644
So, yeah, you know, this is just a general advocacy thing, I think.

893
00:54:49,644 --> 00:54:53,746
Do we have any questions from the room? There are mics there, I believe.

894
00:54:55,429 --> 00:54:57,613
Hi, thank you so much for this talk.

895
00:54:57,613 --> 00:55:03,262
I know that like having a writer's room in person is sort of the ideal for being able

896
00:55:03,262 --> 00:55:08,431
to break story and, but obviously with the pandemic, you know, a lot of us have had to

897
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:09,653
do things remotely and they're.

898
00:55:09,933 --> 00:55:13,876
there are advantages to that in terms of being able to hire diverse candidates who maybe can't

899
00:55:13,876 --> 00:55:19,820
change jobs or can't pick up and move locations every couple of years for different contracts,

900
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:26,744
but how would you maybe modify the advice you've given for running writers rooms remotely instead

901
00:55:26,744 --> 00:55:32,928
of in person? Well, funnily enough, the last two rooms that I've run have been remotely because

902
00:55:32,928 --> 00:55:36,651
they've been during the pandemic. So yes, it...

903
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:43,148
Everything applies, you know, all of this applies whether it's in person or virtually

904
00:55:43,148 --> 00:55:50,399
If you're running a virtual room, then you probably need to make more use of things like slack or discord

905
00:55:50,399 --> 00:55:53,684
Or whatever you use and obviously you will need

906
00:55:54,552 --> 00:55:56,092
dare I say it, a Teams account.

907
00:55:56,092 --> 00:55:58,353
I hate Teams, but if you have a 365 account,

908
00:55:58,353 --> 00:56:01,835
you get to use Teams for free.

909
00:56:01,835 --> 00:56:04,997
Or some other form of reliable video conferencing

910
00:56:04,997 --> 00:56:08,318
that you can use potentially all day if need be.

911
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:11,380
And of course, everybody needs the ability to take part

912
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,841
in those video conference calls.

913
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:15,802
But it can absolutely be done because yeah, I've done it.

914
00:56:15,802 --> 00:56:18,443
And all of these principles apply

915
00:56:18,443 --> 00:56:21,385
just as equally in person or remotely.

916
00:56:21,385 --> 00:56:22,405
There is no...

917
00:56:23,097 --> 00:56:28,421
reason why you cannot have a good, successful run online.

918
00:56:42,051 --> 00:56:46,114
Second of all, I was wondering about, have you ever,

919
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:48,496
or actually, how often does it happen to you

920
00:56:48,496 --> 00:56:51,959
that you've kind of overdone it on diversity?

921
00:56:51,959 --> 00:56:54,701
And I'm not talking about ethnicity or gender.

922
00:56:54,701 --> 00:56:56,942
I'm talking about difference in approach

923
00:56:56,942 --> 00:56:59,284
to the extreme where, you know,

924
00:56:59,284 --> 00:57:02,206
sometimes you get someone that, you know,

925
00:57:02,206 --> 00:57:05,308
working with them is getting counterproductive

926
00:57:05,308 --> 00:57:06,709
to some extent, right?

927
00:57:06,709 --> 00:57:09,852
And I wonder how often it happened to you

928
00:57:09,852 --> 00:57:11,113
and how did you deal with that?

929
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:16,444
I'm fortunate that it's never happened to me when I've been running a room.

930
00:57:16,444 --> 00:57:21,390
I have been in rooms that have had the occasional disruptive member.

931
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:22,571
Most of the time...

932
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,322
People don't realise they're being disruptive.

933
00:57:26,322 --> 00:57:30,485
And especially when it's a matter of employment,

934
00:57:30,485 --> 00:57:34,248
they can be persuaded not to be,

935
00:57:34,248 --> 00:57:36,710
if you take them aside and tell them.

936
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:40,773
I mean, a common one, there's a nickname for it

937
00:57:40,773 --> 00:57:43,155
in TV writing terms, the Doctor No.

938
00:57:43,155 --> 00:57:45,396
Somebody who just shoots down everybody else's ideas.

939
00:57:46,497 --> 00:57:52,379
And a good way to deal with that, for example, is to institute a rule where you can't shoot

940
00:57:52,379 --> 00:57:55,240
down an idea unless you have one of your own to offer.

941
00:57:55,240 --> 00:58:03,503
So simple, positive things like that, rather than just giving someone a bollocking, can

942
00:58:03,503 --> 00:58:08,265
really help to sort of keep the atmosphere of the room good, stop it from getting bad,

943
00:58:08,265 --> 00:58:10,366
but deal with problematic people.

944
00:58:10,366 --> 00:58:13,087
If you have someone who is genuinely just bad and disruptive...

945
00:58:13,996 --> 00:58:17,498
hopefully you'd weed them out at the recruitment stage.

946
00:58:17,498 --> 00:58:20,720
If that doesn't happen, or if you're handed a staff

947
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,361
and it turns out one of them is problematic,

948
00:58:22,361 --> 00:58:24,702
then that is a question of management.

949
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:26,463
That's something that you may well need

950
00:58:26,463 --> 00:58:28,965
to sort of kick up the chain, as it were,

951
00:58:28,965 --> 00:58:30,666
to somebody's manager.

952
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:32,547
All right, thank you.

953
00:58:32,547 --> 00:58:35,288
But like I say, I've been fortunate that I,

954
00:58:35,288 --> 00:58:37,149
you know, it hasn't happened to me.

955
00:58:37,149 --> 00:58:40,231
I've been lucky in choosing people

956
00:58:40,231 --> 00:58:41,632
who take part in my own rooms.

957
00:58:41,632 --> 00:58:42,913
Great to hear, thank you.

958
00:58:45,535 --> 00:58:51,497
Bear in mind, by the way, I cannot see who's at the mic, so take the initiative.

959
00:58:51,497 --> 00:58:53,918
Hello, my name is Sharan Janna.

960
00:58:53,918 --> 00:58:58,859
So a lot of the stuff you're talking about reminds me a lot like running a D&D campaign,

961
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:04,321
where you're the DM and everyone else is the people in your campaign.

962
00:59:04,321 --> 00:59:05,701
It's a lot of similar ideas.

963
00:59:05,701 --> 00:59:07,822
But my main question is that...

964
00:59:10,032 --> 00:59:13,253
Hopefully someday, I want to run my own studio, probably not anytime soon.

965
00:59:13,253 --> 00:59:21,197
But, I mostly come from a programming design background, but you know, I have a huge passion for writing and what not.

966
00:59:21,197 --> 00:59:27,660
So if I do eventually make my own indie game, God bless, I'd like to hire people that are a lot better at it than me.

967
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:30,361
You know, like who know how to write and...

968
00:59:30,481 --> 00:59:36,088
stuff and how like, so I guess the question is how do I manage that relationship between me as an

969
00:59:36,088 --> 00:59:41,274
inexperienced bright eyed visionary who's mostly a programmer and the writer who's like had

970
00:59:41,274 --> 00:59:45,800
decades of experience and knows way more than me but like I still want them to sort of like see

971
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,821
my vision I guess.

972
00:59:48,005 --> 00:59:55,389
Well, that is the difference. I'm glad you expressed it that way, because that is the difference between a visionary and an experienced writer.

973
00:59:55,389 --> 01:00:01,172
Anybody can be the visionary, you know. Plenty of writers are, but you don't have to be.

974
01:00:01,172 --> 01:00:10,378
And you don't need to be an experienced writer. You don't need to know how narrative works necessarily to have that vision.

975
01:00:10,378 --> 01:00:16,241
But what you do have is trust in whoever is heading up narrative on your project.

976
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:20,132
and might be leading a narrative team.

977
01:00:20,132 --> 01:00:23,193
And that is simply a question of trust

978
01:00:23,193 --> 01:00:26,913
and finding the right person to work with.

979
01:00:26,913 --> 01:00:29,534
In the same way that we as writers trust

980
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:32,794
that the programmers know how to do inverse kinesthetics

981
01:00:32,794 --> 01:00:33,814
or whatever.

982
01:00:33,814 --> 01:00:35,315
I mean, I've probably said that wrong even.

983
01:00:35,315 --> 01:00:36,335
I know nothing about it.

984
01:00:36,335 --> 01:00:37,515
I trust them to do it.

985
01:00:37,515 --> 01:00:37,935
Kinematics.

986
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:40,656
All we ask in return is that everybody else trusts

987
01:00:40,656 --> 01:00:43,856
that we know what we're doing when it comes to narrative.

988
01:00:43,856 --> 01:00:45,337
It's kinematics, isn't it?

989
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,681
It's, like I say, it's just a question of mutual trust.

990
01:00:49,681 --> 01:00:52,982
Now that's easier said than done, I realize that.

991
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,563
But it really is that simple.

992
01:00:54,563 --> 01:00:59,505
If you know that you are not experienced in narrative,

993
01:00:59,505 --> 01:01:02,846
hire somebody who is, make sure that they're on board

994
01:01:02,846 --> 01:01:05,327
with your vision, and then trust them.

995
01:01:05,327 --> 01:01:05,767
Thank you very much.

996
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:15,912
So, in a game where the mechanics are a big part of telling the story,

997
01:01:15,912 --> 01:01:20,077
would you recommend maybe having a game designer or two in the writer's room?

998
01:01:20,077 --> 01:01:23,220
Possibly, so long as they behave.

999
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,683
Can you say more on that?

1000
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:35,124
I mean, this is, when I refer to this sort of collective outside group as the producers,

1001
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:40,046
normally I'd expect the game designer to be one of those people and that's where the leadership

1002
01:01:40,046 --> 01:01:44,929
of being a head writer comes in because the head writer will talk with the game designer

1003
01:01:44,929 --> 01:01:51,112
about those things and the game designer will have input into the things they discuss and

1004
01:01:51,112 --> 01:01:53,733
their ideas and what have you, but then normally...

1005
01:01:54,533 --> 01:02:00,418
in the ideal scenario, the head writer will take the decisions and what they've learned from those

1006
01:02:00,418 --> 01:02:06,743
meetings and discussions back to the writer's room and relate it to the writers, rather than

1007
01:02:06,743 --> 01:02:12,588
the designer being in the room. And it's only because, and the reason I joked about behaving,

1008
01:02:12,588 --> 01:02:17,272
as I said at one point in the talk, it is very easy for non-writers

1009
01:02:17,492 --> 01:02:24,141
to glom on to something that's in progress and think that it's the final thing.

1010
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:29,288
Think that we've carved it in a stone tablet and it can never be changed.

1011
01:02:29,288 --> 01:02:30,790
And we as writers know that's not the case.

1012
01:02:31,837 --> 01:02:34,659
But often for non-writers, that's difficult to grasp.

1013
01:02:34,659 --> 01:02:37,562
They hear us talking about something enthusiastically

1014
01:02:37,562 --> 01:02:39,945
and think, oh my God, this is all going horribly wrong.

1015
01:02:39,945 --> 01:02:41,927
No, no, no, I've got to change it.

1016
01:02:41,927 --> 01:02:45,590
Not realizing that we will have that realization ourselves

1017
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:48,173
and in a more productive fashion, you know,

1018
01:02:48,173 --> 01:02:51,256
in half an hour's time or two days time or whatever.

1019
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:56,033
So that's the only reason that I sort of make that crack.

1020
01:02:56,033 --> 01:02:59,476
If it is a designer who understands that

1021
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:02,138
and who maybe has experience

1022
01:03:02,138 --> 01:03:04,020
with some form of narrative themselves,

1023
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:06,842
then by all means, invite them in maybe, you know,

1024
01:03:06,842 --> 01:03:08,103
once or twice a week.

1025
01:03:08,103 --> 01:03:11,746
But there's no reason that they should need to be

1026
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,227
permanently in the room

1027
01:03:13,227 --> 01:03:17,150
unless they are also part of the writing team.

1028
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:19,512
Thank you very much, Anthony.

1029
01:03:19,512 --> 01:03:20,533
That's all we have time for.

1030
01:03:21,314 --> 01:03:22,955
All right. Wonderful presentation.

1031
01:03:22,955 --> 01:03:25,476
Thank you, everyone.

1032
01:03:25,476 --> 01:03:29,437
If you have other questions or you want to talk to me,

1033
01:03:29,437 --> 01:03:31,178
that is my Twitter handle on the screen.

1034
01:03:31,178 --> 01:03:33,058
I am always available on social media.

1035
01:03:33,058 --> 01:03:36,920
Go have fun. Enjoy the rest of GDC and I will see you all next year.
