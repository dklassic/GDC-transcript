00:00:06,292 --> 00:00:11,297
Hello and welcome to Press Y to Cry, Generating Emotions in Video Game Narrative.

2
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:16,542
My name's Andrew Walsh, I'm a writer, director and narrative designer who's worked in TV,

3
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:18,404
theatre, film, animation and comics.

4
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:23,568
I've also got 85 games credits to my name, including Prince of Persia, Fable Legends,

5
00:00:23,568 --> 00:00:27,732
The Division 2, Watch Dogs Legion, and I'm currently working as a senior writer with

6
00:00:27,732 --> 00:00:30,615
Girl Games, as well as a lead writer on an NDA project.

7
00:00:31,235 --> 00:00:35,058
I'm also involved with the Writers Guild of Great Britain's Video Games Committee and I hope you can

8
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:40,121
come along to some of the events that we organise. So today we've got half an hour to look at

9
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:44,804
emotions in video games. I've got a lot to cover so I will be moving quickly.

10
00:00:44,804 --> 00:00:51,249
The aim of this talk is to give you a set of toolkits to analyse emotion in games and see

11
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:55,491
how techniques from other media need to be adapted to fit into interaction.

12
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,294
Please note that I said toolkit and analyze.

13
00:00:58,294 --> 00:01:01,237
I'm not giving you a strict rigid process.

14
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:04,160
What I want to do is give you a set of things that you can use at

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,042
any point in the process to

16
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:08,304
analyze the emotion that you find in games.

17
00:01:10,646 --> 00:01:14,468
So let's get started. How did I come to choose this subject and title?

18
00:01:14,468 --> 00:01:18,330
Well, way back in the mists of time, EA published this as an advert.

19
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,652
It was intended to start a debate about the creative goals for the industry

20
00:01:23,652 --> 00:01:25,473
and to set down the challenge.

21
00:01:25,473 --> 00:01:28,114
Could you make video games that made players cry?

22
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:33,490
By this stage, the medium was already decades old, and yet while music, books, films, TV

23
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,837
and theatre knew how to create all sorts of emotional change in people, to some it appeared

24
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:44,825
that this new, immersive medium wasn't able to explore the same range of emotional responses,

25
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:46,247
despite it being immersive.

26
00:01:47,165 --> 00:01:54,832
Why? Well, two sets of very clever people tried to solve this problem, but humanity being humanity,

27
00:01:54,832 --> 00:01:59,256
they each tried to solve it from opposite ends, often without talking to each other

28
00:01:59,256 --> 00:02:00,818
and sometimes in direct conflict.

29
00:02:01,734 --> 00:02:06,035
On one side of this divide were the programmer designers who were forging the code, verbs

30
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:08,496
and models that modern games rely on today.

31
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,356
They were defining interactivity.

32
00:02:10,356 --> 00:02:15,558
But many of these individuals saw emotion and story as problematic.

33
00:02:15,558 --> 00:02:18,859
Games were about verbs and interactivity.

34
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:24,260
Emotion and story where it was to be found should and could only be emergent.

35
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:29,456
And even though many leading luminaries on this side of the divide continue to talk about

36
00:02:29,456 --> 00:02:34,899
emotion and immersion, the question, can a computer make you cry, for many more from

37
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:38,542
a challenge to a statement.

38
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,363
Game can't make you cry.

39
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:41,784
Stories don't need game.

40
00:02:41,784 --> 00:02:44,726
Games don't need stories, was the cry.

41
00:02:44,726 --> 00:02:46,146
All of which is not.

42
00:02:47,283 --> 00:02:52,004
Sure, you don't need a linear narrative in a game, but all games are emotional.

43
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:57,066
Triumph, loss, joy, frustration, elation. We define the games that we play by the emotions

44
00:02:57,066 --> 00:03:04,048
that they make us feel, meaning that emotion itself is interactive. In fact, when games

45
00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:08,090
fail to create an emotional response in the player, that's because they've ceased to immerse

46
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,391
or challenge them. And in that case, they've ceased to be a game.

47
00:03:12,434 --> 00:03:19,760
Yet despite that, many people on the designing and programming side rejected or ignored Emotion.

48
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:29,509
In fact, things got so bad that one chap had to go away and write a book reminding people that games were supposed to be, you know, fun.

49
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:36,996
Now remember, there were two sides involved here, and on the other side of the divide were writers and storytellers.

50
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:42,601
After all, reasoned many an executive, if we need to tell stories and explore emotion,

51
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:47,024
we should go to the experts in doing this. We'll get some screenwriters and novelists and they

52
00:03:47,024 --> 00:03:53,008
will bring a whole understanding and toolkit for emotion straight into our industry. Simple, right?

53
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:58,208
Well, the problem is that many of those talented individuals and the execs who employed them

54
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:02,969
brought problems as well as solutions. Just as many early filmmakers had simply set up

55
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:07,370
their cameras and filmed theatre plays, people seemed to think that they could make games

56
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,131
in just the same way that they made films. They thought that players should come to them

57
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:15,952
and find their meaning, just as audiences did in cinema.

58
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:21,188
they were sure that if only the people making games fitted the interactivity in a round

59
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:25,998
or to the side of the incredible filmic experiences they were making, then the door to emotion

60
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:27,762
in games would be open.

61
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:31,505
And it's not like either of the sides were completely wrong.

62
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,406
No one had come up with the solutions at that time,

63
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:37,147
and they were trying to build a whole new industry.

64
00:04:37,147 --> 00:04:39,768
And it made sense to embrace emergence and interactivity,

65
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:41,568
as that's what made the medium different.

66
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:44,389
But it also made sense as a medium

67
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:46,129
that games should explore and generate

68
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:49,210
a wider range of emotions than they were.

69
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,651
The two sides needed to stop solving the problem from the end

70
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:54,371
and start it from the middle.

71
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:57,192
They needed to focus on the player.

72
00:04:58,503 --> 00:05:01,284
Now the legacy of this divide continues to today.

73
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:05,365
You will still hear people that were proposing the use of Heroes Journey in games.

74
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:09,486
You will still hear people telling you that the only true game is Emergent.

75
00:05:09,486 --> 00:05:15,387
Whereas actually, the player is often sitting in the middle.

76
00:05:15,387 --> 00:05:18,648
To get there, let me ask a strange and difficult question.

77
00:05:18,648 --> 00:05:20,708
Who is feeling the emotion in your game?

78
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,703
It sounds obvious, I just said the player, right?

79
00:05:24,703 --> 00:05:29,707
Well, yeah, but how often have you heard developers talking about war is hell,

80
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:33,630
and how they want to put the player right into the realities of combat?

81
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,892
But is that really what they want?

82
00:05:35,892 --> 00:05:39,255
To expose the player to some of the worst horrors of humanity,

83
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:45,200
to tear them apart with a set of emotions that cause PTSD and an increased chance of suicide?

84
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,423
Was the question really, can games tear your soul apart in the name of entertainment?

85
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:56,064
At the heart of the problem is a confusion between the emotions we're exploring in the game

86
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,065
and the emotions we actually want the player to feel.

87
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:04,147
And when we fail to align the emotional content of the game with the emotional reaction of the player,

88
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:11,251
the play will be left either feeling confused, amused, angry, or feeling nothing at all.

89
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:15,012
The dreaded Ludo narrative dissonance will eject them from the game.

90
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:17,133
So how do we fix that?

91
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,303
Well, for each game that we make, for each moment in the game and each emotion that we're exploring,

92
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:30,066
we need to ask if it is a simulation, a representation, or an abstraction.

93
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:35,609
For a simulation, the emotion in the game matches the one that we seek to trigger directly in the

94
00:06:35,609 --> 00:06:38,831
player. Here we want the player to feel exactly what's in the game.

95
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:44,670
For a representation, the emotion in the game doesn't match the one that we see to trigger in

96
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:51,674
the player. It's triggered indirectly or both. Here we put some distance between the emotion

97
00:06:51,674 --> 00:06:57,178
in the game and the player's emotion. And to bridge this gap, the player will need to interpret

98
00:06:57,178 --> 00:07:03,642
what we've given them. Abstraction. In an abstraction, we present the emotions only as

99
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:07,364
a concept. We don't intend the player to have an emotional reaction at this point.

100
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:10,115
Okay, let's look at each of these in turn.

101
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:11,256
Simulation.

102
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:13,478
In this VR simulation game,

103
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:18,762
the player is asked to walk over a plank that's suspended over a big drop.

104
00:07:18,762 --> 00:07:21,524
Here, the emotional reaction the developer seeks to create

105
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:25,808
calls on the player's own natural response to height.

106
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:29,051
The game intends to generate fear directly in the player.

107
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:36,304
In a Formula One driving simulation, the intention is to create the same emotional experience for the player as if they were driving the real car.

108
00:07:36,304 --> 00:07:38,648
Exactly what Sid Meier was asking for.

109
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:44,387
But remember though, when we're talking about emotions, we're not necessarily simulating

110
00:07:44,387 --> 00:07:50,011
the environment or the subject. Pong is not a tennis simulator. There's no tennis court

111
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:55,755
and the rules are different. Pong is a skill game. What's important here is that the emotions

112
00:07:55,755 --> 00:08:01,719
the game intends to create, success, win, loss, are the ones that the game intends to

113
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:05,021
generate directly in the player. The emotions match the mechanics.

114
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:11,470
Such emotional simulations can be so powerful that they're being used to change how people

115
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,013
behave in the real world.

116
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:18,927
Some companies are putting people into virtual situations to help them recognise racial or

117
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:23,830
gender bias in themselves when interviewing. Doctors are being trained how to tell patients

118
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:29,994
bad news. In each case, the participants enter the scenario as themselves and are then asked

119
00:08:29,994 --> 00:08:35,337
to respond to it directly. The emotions they're intended to feel are the ones that they would be

120
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:37,558
feeling if they were in the real situation.

121
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:44,291
But when it comes to representation, the experience is no longer direct.

122
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:48,315
The game places something between the player and the emotion in the game.

123
00:08:48,315 --> 00:08:50,857
An obvious example of that would be a character.

124
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:56,482
If we were to take the same VR training in the same doctor, but we were to ask the doctor

125
00:08:56,482 --> 00:09:00,864
to play a character this time, then the scenario would switch from being a simulation to a

126
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:07,186
representation. Same doctor, same scenario, same emotional content. But the doctor wouldn't

127
00:09:07,186 --> 00:09:11,987
be playing and feeling as themselves. Their emotion is no longer direct. We've changed

128
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:15,568
the way that we've asked the participants to react to it, so we've changed the experience.

129
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:22,413
Similarly, when the plank game puts the player in a place where they're asked to feel the terror of

130
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:30,235
crossing over that divide, when we put a character in the place, it's no longer the player who's in

131
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:36,157
virtual danger, it's the character. Here the game doesn't ask the player to feel the same emotions

132
00:09:36,157 --> 00:09:41,599
as the character. Instead of terror, the game is asking us to feel thrill or excitement or to feel

133
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:44,560
scared for the character rather than from ourselves.

134
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:50,312
So we're putting a distance here between the player's own feelings and those in a game.

135
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:51,834
Why would we want to do that?

136
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:55,580
Well, for a start, interpretation isn't necessarily bad.

137
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,988
Interpretation is itself an active verb. It's a way to make emotion interactive.

138
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:07,037
Another plus with representation is it can allow us to present the player with a wider

139
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:10,901
range of experiences than we can in straight simulation.

140
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:15,505
We don't want to expose players to the true horror of war, but we can represent it.

141
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:18,767
We can use a character as a barrier to this negative emotion.

142
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:23,652
This can give the player an emotional distance to explore such difficult subjects.

143
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:28,293
Using this technique, the character can be put through all sorts of potentially negative emotional

144
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:34,034
states such as loss, rage, grief, hate, revenge, without asking the player to experience those

145
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:40,836
emotions themselves directly. As the character feels loss, the player can feel sorry for them.

146
00:10:40,836 --> 00:10:45,398
They can connect to the character but without feeling exactly the same emotion that's in the game.

147
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:49,875
And it's not just emotion that representation can filter.

148
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,918
Just as Pong distills tennis into a simpler interactive

149
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,699
and emotional experience,

150
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:57,381
we can deconstruct other scenarios

151
00:10:57,381 --> 00:10:59,683
into their emotional components

152
00:10:59,683 --> 00:11:01,564
to find a way that suits our game

153
00:11:01,564 --> 00:11:03,866
or the emotions that we want to explore.

154
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,368
When we portray love in a game,

155
00:11:06,368 --> 00:11:09,230
for instance, we're generally not presenting the player

156
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,631
with the whole experience,

157
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:12,532
just as we don't in games with war.

158
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,823
In a lot of dating games, we don't deal with the choice of what to wear, the stress of

159
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:22,205
another person taking 20 minutes to text back.

160
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:27,109
Generally, games seek to shorten and focus the experience.

161
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:31,852
The design wants to find the active verbs, not the moments of sitting and waiting for

162
00:11:31,852 --> 00:11:32,273
the text.

163
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:36,658
But in doing so, we are taking the player away from that simulation.

164
00:11:36,658 --> 00:11:39,180
We're taking them out of the real experience,

165
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,402
and that requires them to interpret and believe.

166
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,245
In a shorter time than it takes in a real day to cover...

167
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:47,367
How did you get here tonight? Fancy a drink?

168
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:49,949
Oh my God, you're into Pirate Topiary 2?

169
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:55,697
Shepard in the game is already asking you to bang X for some trans-stellar inter-species

170
00:11:55,697 --> 00:12:00,123
frolicking. The game shortcuts that experience to give the player the representation,

171
00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:03,768
and with it comes the risk that we eject them out of that experience.

172
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:06,199
Is that what happens?

173
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:08,161
Well, anyone who's been stuck on a table

174
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,524
next to someone explaining the complex physical gymnastics

175
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:12,366
they'd like to perform with Gareth,

176
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:14,088
while the person next to them keeps shouting,

177
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:15,909
but he's a fascist,

178
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:18,832
will tell you that representation can indeed

179
00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:21,735
elicit very strong emotional responses in players.

180
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:24,618
We have to be aware of the change and build around it

181
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,441
and take it into account, but we can still create emotion.

182
00:12:28,265 --> 00:12:32,968
Abstraction, though, is where the emotion is represented only as a concept.

183
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:35,910
We don't expect an emotional response from the player here.

184
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,212
A good example of that would be player stats.

185
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:43,315
When a stat changes, there's not an expectation that the player will then suddenly feel an

186
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:46,797
increase of 10% affection, trust, or suspicion in themselves.

187
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:50,340
They may experience a sense of achievement,

188
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,682
but the stat's not there to evoke a direct emotional response.

189
00:12:54,823 --> 00:12:59,865
Okay, so simulation, representation and abstraction can help you bridge the divide between

190
00:12:59,865 --> 00:13:05,387
between emergence and authored narrative. It defines how you're aligning the content in the

191
00:13:05,387 --> 00:13:10,349
game and the player's emotional response to it. Please note too that this isn't a set of three

192
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:16,071
distinct options, it's a spectrum. Each decision we make about our game can move the player closer

193
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:21,153
to simulation or to abstraction, so we can fine-tune the player's relationship with the

194
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:22,253
game and emotions as we go.

195
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:29,039
Note, too, that many games contain a mix of all three elements, sometimes even in the same moment.

196
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,763
Role-playing games, for example, are generally representations that find moments to move the

197
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:40,368
player closer to simulation, whilst at the same time defining elements of the character's emotional

198
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:45,092
makeup through abstract stats. All right, so we've talked about who is feeling, let's discuss

199
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:46,613
what they're supposed to be feeling.

200
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:54,093
To some people or for some projects,

201
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:56,514
theme can come quickly and naturally.

202
00:13:56,514 --> 00:13:58,415
For others, it's hard to distill

203
00:13:58,415 --> 00:14:01,516
the whole experience down to a few words.

204
00:14:01,516 --> 00:14:03,816
So here's a way that we can look at themes for games.

205
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:05,977
You can have a simple theme,

206
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:07,818
or you can have a complex theme.

207
00:14:07,818 --> 00:14:09,398
A simple theme is just a topic,

208
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:12,299
and that topic can be a subject or an emotion.

209
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:14,200
For more complex themes,

210
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,880
we take the topic and select a lens

211
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,521
through which we'll examine it.

212
00:14:17,521 --> 00:14:18,881
Essentially, we take the topic

213
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:20,442
and we ask questions about it.

214
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:24,820
Now, when we're asking those questions,

215
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,841
if we're creating our own project,

216
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:28,222
we often start with theme.

217
00:14:28,222 --> 00:14:29,083
What do I want to say?

218
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:32,046
Then you can find the best mechanics to explore it.

219
00:14:32,046 --> 00:14:33,607
But chances are, if you're hired to work

220
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:34,387
on someone else's game,

221
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:36,049
that a lot of the mechanics, art,

222
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:38,591
and even story sections might pre-exist your arrival.

223
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,553
So in those cases, you need to look at what exists

224
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:43,555
and find a theme that suits them.

225
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:45,196
And a good place to start, as my role

226
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:47,858
and what I have shown you, is with genre.

227
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:50,500
So here we are back with the plant game again.

228
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:56,246
Genre is the type of game that you're making, and it can be great, you can make great games with

229
00:14:56,246 --> 00:15:01,808
simple emotions and simple themes. All that this game asks for is the simple theme of fear.

230
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:07,731
It works by delivering that emotion directly to the player. So the chances are if you try and use

231
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:12,833
crossing the plank as a way to examine the fall of western civilization, you're probably going to be

232
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:18,396
overdoing it. And adding such complexities can actually push the player out and away from the

233
00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:19,957
emotions that you want them to feel.

234
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:26,423
where you want to remember, where you want the player to enter an emotional state swiftly

235
00:15:26,423 --> 00:15:33,367
or feel it directly, try to minimise interpretation. And that means keeping the theme simple.

236
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:40,012
Other games like Pong or FIFA or Formula One simulators set out challenges of skill instead

237
00:15:40,012 --> 00:15:45,616
of focusing on a single emotional response. But the player is still responding directly

238
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:49,719
in a simulation. So a simple theme or challenge can work here.

239
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,622
The problem is that whilst these are really great games, they're all quite similar.

240
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,424
Their verb sets are all about timing and reaction.

241
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:02,165
As a result, they only explore a narrow band of emotions.

242
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:05,887
This is where many designers got stuck at the time of the Great Divide.

243
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:11,050
And it meant that the range of games produced only appealed to certain players.

244
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,292
To widen the pool of players, they needed to widen the pool of verbs.

245
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:17,393
And some verbs don't fit simulations as well.

246
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:23,170
Kick, run, drive can work quickly in simulations because they don't need interpretation.

247
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:30,573
But you can't talk, romance, explore, interpret, or negotiate to win on a button press,

248
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:35,475
not without understanding the wider context in which that action is set.

249
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:37,976
And context means a more complex theme.

250
00:16:37,976 --> 00:16:41,357
A lens takes the topic and asks questions about them.

251
00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:45,098
Those questions can give our gameplay verbs context.

252
00:16:46,653 --> 00:16:50,354
Take love as a topic. You can look at it in all sorts of ways. Are we saying that love

253
00:16:50,354 --> 00:16:53,175
is good or bad? Are we saying it's good or bad for the character?

254
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:59,117
Theme gets us to ask important questions. Why does the character hate love? What situations

255
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:03,278
will provoke the character to question their feelings and what role does the player take?

256
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:05,459
What do we want them to feel about the theme?

257
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:16,249
These are the very questions that the character in the story need to ask about the theme as we progress through the experience.

258
00:17:16,249 --> 00:17:17,390
It's where the emotions come from.

259
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:24,159
Now if you find short descriptions like this don't actually convey the emotion, you can always write them out as a sentence.

260
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:29,220
and then build out this mind maps, mood boards, whatever works for you. If you're stuck for

261
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,782
a theme, you can start by having the list of questions and then boil it down to get

262
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:37,524
to here. Just make sure that when you get there, the central theme is clear and concise.

263
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:42,487
That way it's easy as it communicates to yourself, to the rest of the team and to the player.

264
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:46,349
And don't forget the player or the game verbs. Just because the game can allow a more complex

265
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:52,572
theme doesn't mean you can lob in any theme that you want without consequence. The theme

266
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,613
still has to be one that can...

267
00:17:53,683 --> 00:18:00,249
investigate with the genre, setting and verbs that you've been given or that you've given yourself.

268
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:04,512
Aligning the verbs in the theme is the biggest step that you can take to align the game's

269
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:09,616
emotional content to the player's emotional reaction. Now does that mean that we can't

270
00:18:09,616 --> 00:18:11,658
challenge the genre? Absolutely not!

271
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:16,579
Spec Ops The Line takes war as the topic for its theme.

272
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:19,901
That meets the player's genre expectations.

273
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:25,225
The game also embraces a lot of the expected gameplay tropes from the gameplay genre.

274
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:30,809
That also meets the player's genre expectations for a shooter.

275
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,511
In doing these two things, the game produces a satisfying experience that keeps the player

276
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:35,432
engaged and immersed.

277
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:43,116
So it's a good shooter. So what's the fuss about? Well, having brought the player in,

278
00:18:43,116 --> 00:18:48,077
Spec Ops then turns the lens on the topic of war and begins to ask questions about the mental

279
00:18:48,077 --> 00:18:53,399
impact that conflict can have on the soldiers that fight it, and in particular the character

280
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:54,380
that we're playing.

281
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:05,267
Interestingly, one of the ways that the game examines war's negative mental impact on the character is by moving the player between simulation and representation.

282
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:12,592
In changing the player's distance from the character, it simulates the way that the character is mentally separating themselves from the actions in the game.

283
00:19:13,947 --> 00:19:17,549
Now by inviting the player into what appears to be a recognisable situation,

284
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:20,451
it's a shooter, then aligning the player with a character,

285
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:24,553
the game's theme is able to contradict the gameplay experience

286
00:19:24,553 --> 00:19:26,914
the player is expecting to have.

287
00:19:26,914 --> 00:19:28,395
In fact, it tells them, spoiler,

288
00:19:28,395 --> 00:19:32,878
that everything they've been doing is wrong.

289
00:19:32,878 --> 00:19:37,120
And it manages to do that while keeping the player in the experience.

290
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,941
Now, an important way that SpecOps achieved this

291
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:42,103
is it did it over a matter of time.

292
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,413
Game designers design for immersion.

293
00:19:46,413 --> 00:19:48,174
Creating immersion is a balancing act.

294
00:19:48,174 --> 00:19:51,396
Increase the complexity of a game too fast over time,

295
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:53,318
and it can become frustrating for the player.

296
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:56,500
Increase it too slowly, and it can become boring.

297
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,903
Both risk breaking immersion and ejecting the player

298
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:01,544
out of the game.

299
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:04,026
And it's the same for emotional immersion.

300
00:20:04,026 --> 00:20:07,209
Introduce new context, emotions, or information

301
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:10,071
too quickly or too slowly,

302
00:20:10,071 --> 00:20:12,753
and the player can be dropped out of the experience.

303
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:23,655
The good news is, it also means that new context, emotions or information can be used by game designers as one of the things to keep the player engaged within the game over time.

304
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:28,479
Nine hours in, you're shooting guys again, but now you're doing it to rescue your buddy.

305
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:34,684
OK, so we've talked about what we're saying, but how do we communicate emotion in the game?

306
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:39,148
Let's go look at some of those verbs that we've been talking about.

307
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:43,211
We can tell emotion, we can show emotion and we can do emotion.

308
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:51,307
tell. Okay, what's this guy feeling? No idea. Oh, so now we know that the character is happy.

309
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:57,734
Telling is a quick and direct way that avoids the need for interpretation.

310
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:04,321
When we tell, we are simply informing the player what the character is feeling as fact.

311
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,311
But this can be emotionally unsatisfying.

312
00:21:07,311 --> 00:21:11,613
Without context, the player is likely to take the information

313
00:21:11,613 --> 00:21:13,513
and not feel a response.

314
00:21:13,513 --> 00:21:15,454
We're close in this form to an abstraction.

315
00:21:15,454 --> 00:21:15,714
We can show.

316
00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:18,595
So here, we can show that the character is happy.

317
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:21,616
In showing, we're asking the player to interpret.

318
00:21:21,616 --> 00:21:24,677
So there is a risk that they might get it wrong, hopefully

319
00:21:24,677 --> 00:21:26,358
not with smiling.

320
00:21:26,358 --> 00:21:29,459
But on the positive side, we are making the player active.

321
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:32,099
And we're also asking them to respond

322
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:34,040
as they would on seeing a smile in real life.

323
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,482
That means that showing is closer to a simulation.

324
00:21:38,482 --> 00:21:42,324
It also means that showing is more likely to generate an emotional response

325
00:21:42,324 --> 00:21:46,986
in the player than telling. It's a stronger method.

326
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:49,868
And we can do emotions, can we? Well this can work.

327
00:21:55,205 --> 00:21:58,546
But even though we've added interactivity, this is really just telling with a button.

328
00:21:58,546 --> 00:22:04,729
The problem with press Y to cry or X to be happy is it assumes emotions are turned off

329
00:22:04,729 --> 00:22:08,011
and on in both the player and the character.

330
00:22:08,011 --> 00:22:13,294
But by adding interactivity, we change something into something greater just by making it a

331
00:22:13,294 --> 00:22:13,634
doing action.

332
00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:17,916
OK, it does shift us on by involving the player a bit, but we're still telling the player,

333
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,057
so let's rate this as telling plus.

334
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:25,312
Note also that this is not just representing how the character feels,

335
00:22:25,312 --> 00:22:28,334
it's representing a change in the character's emotion.

336
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:33,337
And that's because interaction is better at action than passivity.

337
00:22:34,818 --> 00:22:38,419
This is one way that games are different from films and books.

338
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:40,500
It's not just that we can do things,

339
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,742
it's that not doing things can be confusing or difficult

340
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:45,462
to represent.

341
00:22:45,462 --> 00:22:47,363
And that means when we talk about interactivity,

342
00:22:47,363 --> 00:22:49,944
we often have to combine tell, show, and do

343
00:22:49,944 --> 00:22:52,625
to communicate certain emotions and story points

344
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:55,667
in the strongest way possible.

345
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,168
We can tell or show the context so that we

346
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,948
can do the moment of change.

347
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:06,689
Okay, so if this is only telling plots, how can we improve do to match the things that I've been

348
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:13,301
talking about? Well, remember our theme. We need a lens. We need context.

349
00:23:14,571 --> 00:23:19,234
By shifting to pet the dog, we've created an emotional context.

350
00:23:19,234 --> 00:23:22,576
It's exactly the same mechanic, press X, the same result,

351
00:23:22,576 --> 00:23:24,237
the same representation.

352
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:27,219
But because we've asked the player to interpret not just an emotion,

353
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:31,462
but an emotional situation, the player's more likely to respond

354
00:23:31,462 --> 00:23:33,704
with an emotional response.

355
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,624
They're more likely to feel.

356
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:37,966
We're closer to a simulation, and one that's

357
00:23:37,966 --> 00:23:39,387
been proven to work rather well.

358
00:23:39,387 --> 00:23:43,670
But can we do this with more complex emotions than happy?

359
00:23:45,187 --> 00:23:49,008
The more complex the emotion, the sillier it can feel to communicate it by tell.

360
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:53,310
And the harder it can be for the player to just read the emotion from show.

361
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,671
Is this character morally conflicted or are they constipated?

362
00:23:56,671 --> 00:24:00,993
Hearing is somewhere where perhaps do can come into its own.

363
00:24:00,993 --> 00:24:05,375
What we can do is give the player a moral dilemma.

364
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,355
Pet the dog or kick the dog.

365
00:24:06,355 --> 00:24:11,738
Such situations can create moral conflict not just for the character but also for the player.

366
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:19,293
Or they may. But remember, we've added another layer of complexity, and that means there's an increased chance the player won't feel what's intended.

367
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:22,776
Part of the issue here is that the choice is binary.

368
00:24:22,776 --> 00:24:28,241
Some people would never kick the dog, meaning that this was never going to be a choice.

369
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:32,785
So they never are going to feel morally conflicted, at least not about the choice.

370
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:35,027
They might now feel conflicted about the character.

371
00:24:35,027 --> 00:24:37,950
What an asshole for even considering kicking the dog.

372
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:42,738
Other people will kick the dog because they find it funny, even if the character doesn't.

373
00:24:42,738 --> 00:24:49,802
And in both situations, we divorce the player from the character, the situation, and the emotion.

374
00:24:49,802 --> 00:24:56,465
The same can be true if we add an outcome. Pet the dog for a 10% increase in trust.

375
00:24:56,465 --> 00:25:00,608
Kick the dog for a 10% decrease in trust. Here we need to ask ourselves,

376
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:04,510
is the player now making a moral decision or a game decision?

377
00:25:05,598 --> 00:25:10,179
In each case, a big part of the problem is the fact that this choice is happening in a vacuum.

378
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:14,821
To really make this count in a linear case or even in an emergent case, because I know this

379
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:20,283
feels like it's linear, it's also true in emergent cases, to really make this count to align the

380
00:25:20,283 --> 00:25:26,345
player with the theme, character and emotion, they need thematic context. Let's imagine if the game's

381
00:25:26,345 --> 00:25:32,007
theme is one of the ones that we discussed earlier, love is hate. Here the character is faced with a

382
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:33,907
loving action and a hateful one.

383
00:25:35,228 --> 00:25:38,770
And so when the player chooses, they're using that choice

384
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,932
to interrogate the character's feelings.

385
00:25:40,932 --> 00:25:42,933
If we communicate our theme,

386
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:45,354
the player should understand why the character

387
00:25:45,354 --> 00:25:46,315
is facing this choice

388
00:25:46,315 --> 00:25:48,756
and what the emotional responses from the player,

389
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:51,217
what from the emotional response of the character are

390
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:54,099
after the player has made the choice.

391
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:56,560
Context is vital to bring us into this

392
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,321
because now we're attached to the character

393
00:25:58,321 --> 00:26:01,583
and can understand why we're making the choice.

394
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:04,284
It allows us to attach more emotion to the situation.

395
00:26:05,403 --> 00:26:09,087
So that brings us to the question, why does the player feel emotion?

396
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:11,390
Well, in simulations this should be obvious.

397
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:15,315
As we've said, the player is responding to the emotion in the mechanics.

398
00:26:15,315 --> 00:26:19,520
There's always a chance that they won't understand, but as the mechanics are the context,

399
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,664
the player should really know what to feel and why they're feeling it.

400
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,906
I drove fast, I'm excited.

401
00:26:26,744 --> 00:26:29,466
For representation, though, we need context.

402
00:26:29,466 --> 00:26:31,549
And that context can come from story.

403
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:36,033
That's not to say that every story needs to be linear or even authored,

404
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:37,275
but it does need context.

405
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:39,417
And when we think of story in games,

406
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:43,841
it's often helpful to think about setting up a series of emotional boxes.

407
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:47,425
Each box contains an emotion and a set of questions.

408
00:26:47,645 --> 00:26:50,386
and a question about it that relates to your theme.

409
00:26:50,386 --> 00:26:51,726
Box, emotion, question.

410
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:54,607
For each box, you need to think about the context

411
00:26:54,607 --> 00:26:56,547
that the player has when they approach it.

412
00:26:56,547 --> 00:26:58,448
What will the genre have told them?

413
00:26:58,448 --> 00:27:01,708
What elements of the game will have they experienced?

414
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:03,409
Will the player have the context

415
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:05,689
to interpret the emotion in each box,

416
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:07,749
just as they did with the moral question over the dog?

417
00:27:07,749 --> 00:27:10,070
Where the answer is no or unclear,

418
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,210
you can think of each box

419
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,471
as requiring its own mini three-act structure.

420
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:21,033
What I mean by that is an introduction which sets the context, the middle which is the

421
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:27,075
emotion and how it's split between tell, do, and show, and as a result simulation, representation,

422
00:27:27,075 --> 00:27:33,278
or abstraction. And at the end some sort of emotional payoff or state change for both the

423
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:39,060
player and the character at the end. Now that can be as simple as I have the ball, I kick the ball,

424
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,501
I score a goal. Yay! Or it can be more complex.

425
00:27:43,511 --> 00:27:47,294
So let's look at an emotional moment in a game that's all about simulation,

426
00:27:47,294 --> 00:27:53,039
that's told through representation, and see how it deals with one of its emotional boxes.

427
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,161
Or in this case, a cube.

428
00:27:55,161 --> 00:28:02,788
In the first Portal game, the player enters a chamber and encounters the weighted companion cube.

429
00:28:02,788 --> 00:28:07,512
In essence, this is the same as the functional storage cubes they've encountered elsewhere,

430
00:28:07,512 --> 00:28:09,534
only this one has a heart drawn on it.

431
00:28:10,327 --> 00:28:13,689
and the player is told to pick it up and to carry it through the level.

432
00:28:13,689 --> 00:28:18,592
As the player encounters the cube and continues through the level,

433
00:28:18,592 --> 00:28:22,755
the new emotional context comes from a handful of lines from the antagonist, Lados.

434
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:26,068
The cube is not a threat, but you're not to care for it.

435
00:28:26,068 --> 00:28:30,591
Now up to this point, the player's only contact with the world, with any other being,

436
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:34,433
has been with GLaDOS. But by this stage, the player is beginning to doubt her.

437
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:41,136
Our suspicion gives context to what we're doing, so the telling here becomes more than that.

438
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,358
We're suspicious, so we doubt, so we interpret, we interrogate.

439
00:28:44,358 --> 00:28:47,620
The fact that the things that we're told are contradictory

440
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,922
also invites us to find our own truth in it, deepening the telling.

441
00:28:53,425 --> 00:28:59,029
When the player reaches the end of the level, the player is asked to euthanise the cube,

442
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,691
essentially to press X to kick the dock.

443
00:29:01,691 --> 00:29:07,655
But it's not a dock, it's a cube, a box, that says and does nothing.

444
00:29:07,655 --> 00:29:12,879
Yet player after player reached the incinerator and looked for a way to cheat the test,

445
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:17,002
so that they didn't have to destroy the cube, only to realise there is no choice.

446
00:29:17,002 --> 00:29:18,743
They had to drop it into the pit.

447
00:29:18,743 --> 00:29:22,266
What the team does brilliantly in the space of one level is make you care.

448
00:29:23,073 --> 00:29:27,636
for a cube. In fact, most of the dialogue in this level is written for after this moment,

449
00:29:27,636 --> 00:29:32,259
with Lados insisting that you have to destroy the cube. The team had constructed something

450
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:36,761
where they knew and could predict the player's emotional reaction to the character's situation.

451
00:29:36,761 --> 00:29:40,623
They knew that they were going to have to cope with the fact that the player hadn't

452
00:29:40,623 --> 00:29:45,526
put the box in there. Now, to achieve this, Portal ticked all the boxes we discussed earlier.

453
00:29:45,906 --> 00:29:54,190
Just like Spec Ops, Portal embraces the gameplay genre, allowing the player to become immersed in the mechanics so they can add complexity elsewhere.

454
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,832
Portal builds its theme from the game's abstract, repeated gameplay.

455
00:29:57,832 --> 00:30:02,414
What would otherwise have been a series of excellent but disconnected puzzles becomes something deeper.

456
00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:11,638
As the player completes abstract tasks after abstract tasks, they begin to wonder who they are, what their role is in this world, and whether they have any power over it.

457
00:30:11,638 --> 00:30:14,700
The team created a story of free will.

458
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:19,837
The cube, like the player, is innocent, trapped in this bizarre environment.

459
00:30:19,837 --> 00:30:22,639
And we're used to being bossed around by Gladys.

460
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:26,321
We now want to reject what we're being told.

461
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:28,642
So when we reach the end, when we reach the incinerator,

462
00:30:28,642 --> 00:30:31,423
we're identifying with the cube.

463
00:30:31,423 --> 00:30:33,825
The companion cube in this world is the same as the player.

464
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,974
And this pushes the game from abstract mechanics

465
00:30:37,974 --> 00:30:40,875
through representation and into simulation,

466
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:45,977
the result being people developed feelings for a cube.

467
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:49,218
Can a computer make you cry?

468
00:30:49,218 --> 00:30:49,758
Yes, it can.

469
00:30:51,161 --> 00:30:57,262
So to sum up, when you're examining emotion in games, there are four main things that are useful to think about.

470
00:30:57,262 --> 00:31:01,243
Who is feeling the emotion in your game? Simulation, representation, abstraction.

471
00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:05,184
What emotion is the player supposed to feel? Theme, genre.

472
00:31:05,184 --> 00:31:08,885
How do we communicate emotion in a game? Tell, show, do.

473
00:31:08,885 --> 00:31:11,406
And why does the player feel emotion?

474
00:31:12,393 --> 00:31:17,738
context, structure. By looking at emotions as interactive, as something to interpret,

475
00:31:17,738 --> 00:31:23,504
you can go forth and help the player to fall in love, cry, hope, dream and explore another

476
00:31:23,504 --> 00:31:30,571
thousand different emotions, all while keeping them in the game. Good luck. Thank you very much

477
00:31:30,571 --> 00:31:36,357
for coming along today. I hope that's very useful for you. Have fun and be emotional out there.
