1
00:00:06,302 --> 00:00:09,123
My name is Nick Van Vught. I'm the community lead at Yukon Games.

2
00:00:09,203 --> 00:00:11,984
We're a mobile game studio located out of Toronto, Canada,

3
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,846
which you can probably tell because after one day in San Francisco, I have a sunburn.

4
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:20,988
Today I'll be talking about balancing community and business from a community-focused angle.

5
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:24,130
I've been asked to remind people about silencing their noisemakers,

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,932
and please remember to fill out your evaluation forms when you get the email notification.

7
00:00:28,712 --> 00:00:31,713
They're extremely useful in helping improve the Community Management Summit.

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,421
At Yukon, we're currently refocusing our brand with Kings of Pool and Sony partnered titles

9
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:42,402
such as Who Wants to be a Millionaire and Jeopardy World Tour.

10
00:00:44,223 --> 00:00:46,543
But it's not just these games that we have experience in.

11
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:52,105
We have a decade of history in the mobile market with RPGs, MMOs, action adventure,

12
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:55,106
sports and casual titles that we've worked on in the past.

13
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:59,467
I've been at Yukon for almost seven and a half years now, but our company history reaches

14
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:00,548
even further back than that.

15
00:01:02,843 --> 00:01:05,504
So what am I talking about when I say the tightrope of needs?

16
00:01:06,604 --> 00:01:09,105
It's better to not think about walking a tightrope like this.

17
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:12,426
It should be more enjoyable like this.

18
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,547
Community managers act as intermediaries

19
00:01:15,587 --> 00:01:17,527
between the community that we're responsible for

20
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:20,708
and the company itself, be that the product team,

21
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:22,889
designers, project or general managers,

22
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,330
anyone who's making decisions as to what the game looks like

23
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,750
or how features are brought to life.

24
00:01:28,977 --> 00:01:32,739
The problem is that for the most part, this is often in direct conflict, especially in

25
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:33,540
mobile free-to-play.

26
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:40,104
The needs of the business, with key performance indicators like revenue, engagement, and retention,

27
00:01:40,404 --> 00:01:43,026
are almost always at odds with our responsibilities.

28
00:01:43,986 --> 00:01:47,288
Our community's needs can easily be outweighed by the company's goals.

29
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,200
The biggest problem is that most people see the relationship between product and community

30
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,401
like this, and not like this.

31
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,641
And please forgive the cheesy photos.

32
00:01:58,241 --> 00:02:01,302
This isn't a presentation about holding hands and singing Kumbaya.

33
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:05,163
In fact, most of the decisions I've come up against from the product team have led to

34
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:07,423
massive increases of complaints and concerns.

35
00:02:07,923 --> 00:02:12,304
But ultimately understanding where both perspectives are coming from can ease not only your working

36
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:16,225
relationship with these people, but help your community get what they want and need out

37
00:02:16,245 --> 00:02:17,045
of this relationship.

38
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:22,935
There are three techniques I've used to attempt to better bridge the gap between these two

39
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:24,776
worlds which I'm going to be talking about today.

40
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:28,478
The first is to think like a product team member.

41
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:33,400
It's not necessarily about changing your ideology to match theirs, but to see concerns from

42
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,140
their perspective.

43
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:39,603
Next is to investigate vocal members of your community, preferably ones that can help your

44
00:02:39,623 --> 00:02:41,243
product team understand player concerns.

45
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:44,876
Finally, increase community visibility.

46
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:49,099
This will help your product team along with the rest of your company understand what players

47
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:49,919
are passionate about.

48
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:55,803
Before we can dig into those ideas, you have to understand why the product team may not

49
00:02:55,863 --> 00:02:57,684
take everything you say so seriously.

50
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:01,887
One of the biggest reality checks I've done at Ukin was investigating players who would

51
00:03:01,987 --> 00:03:04,588
email us or post on social media that they were quitting the game.

52
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:10,028
As a community manager, whenever I've heard that someone's going to quit, I've thrown

53
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:11,469
up warning signs to our product team.

54
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:15,692
For my gut reaction, it means that something that the product team has introduced is not

55
00:03:15,732 --> 00:03:17,153
performing as well as they had planned.

56
00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:21,936
It can often feel empowering to prove to the product team that what they're doing is wrong

57
00:03:22,156 --> 00:03:23,977
and that the dissent from the community should be heard.

58
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:26,139
But that's not always the case.

59
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:31,917
Many users would email us over and over again saying that they were going to quit if the

60
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:36,003
feature that we introduced was not removed or changed, but this couldn't be the case.

61
00:03:36,543 --> 00:03:40,809
If players kept threatening us and yet continued to play, it was at direct odds with their

62
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:41,049
threat.

63
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:43,862
I was a bit frustrated.

64
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:47,504
It felt like regardless of how many players threatened to quit, no one on the product

65
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:48,425
side seemed to care.

66
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:53,369
So I decided to do an investigation for my own sanity, cataloging hundreds of emails

67
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,712
over multiple years of the company's history where players specifically threatened to quit.

68
00:03:58,513 --> 00:04:03,017
I then cross-referenced the data with our user reports and found that 13% of the users

69
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:07,180
who threatened to quit did so within 24 hours, 5% within a week of contacting us, 4% more

70
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,720
within two weeks.

71
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,970
An additional 4% at the 30-day mark,

72
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:17,691
nine more percent at 60 days,

73
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:21,792
but overall, 65% of those users didn't quit.

74
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:26,454
I then cross-checked the email churn rates

75
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,595
against the industry gaming average churn rates,

76
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:29,895
and it was even more clear

77
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:31,595
that the players who were threatening to quit

78
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:34,336
had a 50% lower chance than even the average,

79
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:37,017
making this even less of a concern for our product team.

80
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,761
Even though we had the metrics indicating

81
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,282
that some players were lapsing,

82
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:43,884
the 65% of players who didn't lapse

83
00:04:43,904 --> 00:04:44,924
were the most interesting.

84
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:47,806
These players give context to community complaints

85
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:49,787
and give the product team a better idea

86
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:51,528
of what the vocal members of the community

87
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:52,509
were tolerant of.

88
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:55,170
Sometimes players just need an outlet to vent

89
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,911
and we have to act as the punching bag.

90
00:04:59,393 --> 00:05:00,373
While doing the investigation,

91
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,815
I wanted to look into the day-to-day volume

92
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:04,015
of the complaints that we were getting

93
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:05,376
from our players around the time

94
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,697
we rolled out specific features.

95
00:05:07,852 --> 00:05:09,533
You can see little bumps in the complaints

96
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:11,394
each time we introduced something,

97
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:13,855
or nerfed the economy, or rolled out something new.

98
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:15,717
And since the product team knew

99
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:16,957
that it could be more aggressive

100
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:18,639
and not lose players who are unhappy,

101
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:20,400
they continued to roll out features

102
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,540
that had a bigger impact.

103
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,522
This include more nerfing

104
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:25,483
and introducing more aggressive features.

105
00:05:25,963 --> 00:05:27,945
And that's where you start to see these bumps.

106
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:31,267
These fluctuations accounted for more than a 50% increase

107
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:32,608
in our daily email volume,

108
00:05:32,888 --> 00:05:34,609
with over 40% of that volume

109
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:35,910
coming from new tickets alone.

110
00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:41,704
When comparing these peaks and valleys of community concerns to our MAU, the pattern

111
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:42,785
becomes a bit more clear.

112
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:48,107
Our contact rate is increasing not only because players may be vocal, but because we're gaining

113
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,347
more daily active users.

114
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:53,569
And it's hard to look at the big picture from an analytical standpoint when you're used

115
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:56,090
to being bombarded by negative emails on a daily basis.

116
00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:01,588
A similar pattern can be seen in our revenue growth as well, though, with an increase of

117
00:06:01,648 --> 00:06:05,469
over 10% week over week during some of the more vocal increases of complaints.

118
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,732
For a product or development team, the negative feedback is inconsequential if it means that

119
00:06:10,772 --> 00:06:14,373
the changes that they're making are having a larger impact on the KPIs that mean the

120
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:15,274
most to the company.

121
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:19,616
Some players may leave or be driven out by these changes, but as long as the metrics

122
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:23,978
are moving in a positive way, it's difficult to point at negativity as being bad for the

123
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:24,358
company.

124
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:29,224
So how are you supposed to keep players happy and work with your product team if you spend

125
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:33,328
your whole day dealing with the fallout of their choices and responding to players whose

126
00:06:33,428 --> 00:06:37,352
understanding of how the game works may shift on a weekly or even daily basis?

127
00:06:39,194 --> 00:06:42,177
I think when I tell people that they need to think like a product manager, they feel

128
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:42,898
a lot like this.

129
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,501
But I have an art degree, they say.

130
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:48,263
I promise you it's not nearly as terrifying.

131
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:52,569
It's easy to think the product team and developers as the enemy.

132
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:56,450
They have a tendency to make your life more difficult, and all the anger from their decisions

133
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,251
is usually directed squarely at you.

134
00:06:58,872 --> 00:07:02,894
And I can't believe that I'm using a prequel GIF in this presentation, but I've often found

135
00:07:02,934 --> 00:07:06,335
myself thinking like I'm on the light side of the force trying to battle against the

136
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:07,536
evil that is the product team.

137
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:12,238
I also feel like being a community manager has aged me just as poorly as it has Yoda.

138
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:17,901
The first and easiest solution to combat feeling like it's you versus them is to think like

139
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:18,661
a product manager.

140
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:23,913
What I mean by that is just understand what their motivations are and find ways to appeal to them.

141
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:28,736
Get into their headspace and approach feedback and concerns from where they will inevitably position

142
00:07:28,776 --> 00:07:33,660
themselves. As I mentioned before, the key performance indicators that appeal most of

143
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,564
these teams include revenue, engagement, and retention. But the most important by far in

144
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,685
free-to-play is revenue.

145
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:44,300
Since we're talking about vocal players and spending players,

146
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,502
it's important to put this in context on an even larger scale.

147
00:07:48,262 --> 00:07:52,184
So when looking at the total number of combined posts in our game's most active forums,

148
00:07:52,524 --> 00:07:55,426
we were able to find out the percentage of users who had posted

149
00:07:55,546 --> 00:07:57,427
and were participating in community discussion.

150
00:07:58,007 --> 00:07:59,028
About 0.6% of our total active users.

151
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:06,853
Then when you break down that 0.6% into how many of those vocal players had also spent

152
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:10,619
within the game, and remember, these are the users that the product team actually cares

153
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:15,006
about, you're looking at an even smaller fraction, under 1% of the 0.6% we've already established.

154
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,833
What this effectively means is that of all the players

155
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:23,114
who have active accounts in the game

156
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:24,695
and who have spent at least a dollar,

157
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:28,738
we were only hearing from 0.006% of them.

158
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:31,480
And those are the people that product cares about.

159
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:33,982
So this number can help you immediately understand

160
00:08:34,022 --> 00:08:36,684
why they might not care about a vocal player's concerns.

161
00:08:38,045 --> 00:08:39,626
Knowing how to communicate with your product team

162
00:08:39,806 --> 00:08:42,548
means helping them target the KPIs that matter most to them

163
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:44,410
and figuring out what spending players

164
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,270
want out of the game.

165
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:47,632
This can help you better connect with your players

166
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:48,613
and give them what they want.

167
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:54,797
The fastest way to put this kind of ideology in check was to run an in-game survey asking

168
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:58,338
players for their opinion on a feature that wasn't performing as well as designed.

169
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:01,959
By default, the feature would automatically play the game for you.

170
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:03,539
No user input required.

171
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:07,300
We had heard some grumblings from players in the past who were a bit confused about

172
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,681
the automatic option, but it was never enough to lead to any definitive changes or warrant

173
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:12,502
a major overhaul.

174
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:17,391
We wanted to ask players directly if the manual option would make the feature more appealing.

175
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,455
So I asked a few quick questions to determine if the lack of traction was due to the feature's

176
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:26,960
design and if there was a way to tweak it to make it work better for players.

177
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,083
68% of the respondents were positive in their reply about a potential change, allowing a

178
00:09:31,123 --> 00:09:35,648
manual override, with 17% being neutral, not caring one way or another.

179
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:39,275
Although the 16% negative to change was intimidating,

180
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:41,597
the remaining 84% who were positive,

181
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,438
or at least neutral to the idea

182
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,939
of implementing a manual option,

183
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,581
was enough for the team to attempt to salvage the feature.

184
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:49,803
Based on the feedback alone,

185
00:09:50,043 --> 00:09:52,285
we implemented a change and introduced the option

186
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:54,827
for players to toggle between automatic and manual,

187
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,168
giving them the freedom to choose

188
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,429
how they wanted to use the feature.

189
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,711
Doing so improved day one retention by 40%,

190
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:03,592
all because we listened to player feedback.

191
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:05,613
So this was enough to show product

192
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:07,094
that we can work well together

193
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:08,955
and provide them with the feedback necessary

194
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:10,916
to improve the metrics they hold so dearly.

195
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:13,117
In order to circle back around

196
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:14,578
and close off my Star Wars reference,

197
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:15,818
with these kind of results,

198
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:17,679
you start to feel like the response from the dark side

199
00:10:17,739 --> 00:10:18,740
is more attuned to this.

200
00:10:21,161 --> 00:10:22,021
So let's switch gears

201
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:24,383
and talk about investigating vocal players.

202
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:30,133
Most high-spending players provide feedback that's contradictory to a product team's

203
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:30,853
ideologies.

204
00:10:31,654 --> 00:10:34,935
Suggestions for features that allow them to play for longer or not have to spend any

205
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:39,057
money in the game come up frequently through our channels, but there are still many pieces

206
00:10:39,077 --> 00:10:41,919
of user feedback that are extremely valuable to your product team.

207
00:10:43,782 --> 00:10:46,863
I wanted to spend a bit of time talking about a user who I'll call Martha.

208
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:51,724
Martha is an extremely vocal player who plays both our Jeopardy World Tour and Who Wants

209
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:56,666
to be a Millionaire apps and emails us a few times a week just telling us what she thinks

210
00:10:56,726 --> 00:10:57,226
about the game.

211
00:10:58,046 --> 00:11:01,507
Anytime we mention her around the community team, the result is pretty similar to this.

212
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,929
Since November, Martha has emailed us 80 times.

213
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:11,592
And that doesn't count back and forth responses,

214
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,354
which usually average anywhere between 10 to 12 times

215
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:16,215
every single time she emails us.

216
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:20,738
Now, Martha isn't mean to us, she's just very vocal

217
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:22,639
and has a lot of feelings about the game.

218
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:24,500
If she was a non-spending user,

219
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,681
the feedback would be lost to our product team.

220
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:30,323
But fortunately, Martha has spent $3,000 in the game.

221
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:33,825
This isn't a huge whale in mobile terms,

222
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:36,246
but it's someone with enough purchases under their belt

223
00:11:36,407 --> 00:11:37,447
to warrant some attention.

224
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:43,635
The problem was Martha had been complaining for a while that she hasn't wanted to spend

225
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:46,635
recently because nothing we were offering her was a good deal.

226
00:11:47,676 --> 00:11:51,016
We wanted the game to perform well and we want our VIPs to feel like they're getting

227
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:55,377
a good deal, but if Martha was complaining about this, I felt at the very least it was

228
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:56,438
something we should look into.

229
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,839
Product is usually looking at overall trends that show change in the KPIs that they're

230
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:05,920
tracking, but they don't usually look on a per-user basis unless there's an anomaly.

231
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:10,545
Since we had a connection with Martha, I wanted to spend some time seeing what her behavior

232
00:12:10,585 --> 00:12:11,326
was like in the game.

233
00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:15,369
I found this incredibly helpful in making a better connection to what's important to

234
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:19,072
our players, so you can understand why they're passionate about certain elements in the game.

235
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:24,416
Using products tools, I didn't see anything outside of the ordinary from looking at her

236
00:12:24,556 --> 00:12:28,479
action count or number of sessions or even win rate within the game.

237
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,943
But when I started looking at her soft currency, I noticed a glaring issue.

238
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,053
Effectively, Martha's soft currency wallet, which allowed her to keep playing more games,

239
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:39,954
was completely out of control.

240
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:44,457
For months, it just continued to climb higher and higher to a point where she didn't have

241
00:12:44,517 --> 00:12:46,559
to make any more in-app purchases to play the game.

242
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:51,402
The general wallet size of our players wasn't segmented in a way that allowed us to drill

243
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:56,345
down into specific player concerns like this, so I manually checked other high-spending

244
00:12:56,385 --> 00:12:58,947
players who were around the same user level as Martha.

245
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:03,736
We had around 150 unique users who fit a similar trend.

246
00:13:04,356 --> 00:13:06,358
They had climbing soft currency wallets

247
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,621
and weren't spending as much as they once did.

248
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:11,384
The only commonality is that they had maxed out

249
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,767
the content in the game and had found an exploit

250
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,409
that effectively allowed them to play almost indefinitely.

251
00:13:18,202 --> 00:13:20,446
Here you can see the massive amounts of soft currency

252
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:21,327
these players were getting.

253
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:23,911
Regardless of how much they were putting into the game,

254
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:24,992
they always got more out.

255
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,177
And to decode this graph, the purple you see

256
00:13:28,237 --> 00:13:29,739
is the entry cost to play a stage,

257
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,482
and the pink is the rewards.

258
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:36,808
So I was able to identify a player concern

259
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:38,549
that tied into a product concern

260
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:40,770
targeting their most important KPI.

261
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:43,152
This made it easy for me to then work

262
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:44,633
with the product team on a solution.

263
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:47,355
Our vocal players and VIPs were going to affect

264
00:13:47,395 --> 00:13:49,816
their bottom line, and in order to find a solution,

265
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,197
we needed to implement a change.

266
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:54,720
So we decided to put out a new stage

267
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,161
that should address some of the end game balancing concerns

268
00:13:57,181 --> 00:13:57,762
that we were hitting.

269
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,344
It needed to be accessible after the current highest level

270
00:14:01,384 --> 00:14:03,706
to encourage players to spend for larger rewards.

271
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:07,580
And it also needed a lower return to player investment,

272
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,502
a higher entry cost, and a higher win rate.

273
00:14:11,103 --> 00:14:12,564
If players were winning more often,

274
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:15,527
the thrill of that success may outweigh or outbalance

275
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:17,909
the less frequent big wins that they were used to.

276
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:21,032
From a product perspective,

277
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:22,894
implementing the stage was a huge hit.

278
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:25,516
Breaking down the results from the level buckets

279
00:14:25,536 --> 00:14:26,998
who had access to the new stage

280
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:29,640
showed that average revenue per daily active user

281
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,120
increased by 22%.

282
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:36,438
A downside was that total engagement along with the number of matches played on the main

283
00:14:36,478 --> 00:14:40,741
screen decreased, but this made sense as we were throttling the number of games users

284
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:43,263
could play in these stages by increasing the stage cost.

285
00:14:43,964 --> 00:14:48,528
Although engagement is an important KPI, as I mentioned, it's nowhere near as important

286
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:49,088
as revenue.

287
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:55,634
Finally, the amount of soft currency spent in this level group doubled, meaning that

288
00:14:55,654 --> 00:14:59,537
we had introduced a feature that was successfully addressing the bloated wallets of this player

289
00:14:59,557 --> 00:14:59,737
group.

290
00:15:00,808 --> 00:15:03,229
leading to more opportunities to spend within the game.

291
00:15:04,229 --> 00:15:06,089
Since implementing the new stage,

292
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,590
Martha has started spending again

293
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,251
and hasn't complained about any in-app purchase options.

294
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:17,172
Finally, let's talk about increasing community visibility

295
00:15:17,192 --> 00:15:18,332
within your organization.

296
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:23,053
There's a common misconception to protect the company

297
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:25,813
from player negativity if it isn't directly bug-related.

298
00:15:26,762 --> 00:15:31,664
Negativity can cause issues with company performance or morale, but without being aware of the

299
00:15:31,704 --> 00:15:36,145
temperature of your community or knowing which issues players are passionate about, product

300
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:40,307
may make incorrect assumptions about what your community enjoys or doesn't enjoy within

301
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:40,707
the game.

302
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:45,468
In my opinion, qualitative feedback should always come hand-in-hand with quantitative.

303
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:50,950
Each and every time we launch a new game, we create a Slack channel that automatically

304
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,071
funnels feedback from reviews and emails.

305
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:58,075
We intentionally pull reviews from Google and iTunes that are three stars and below

306
00:15:58,195 --> 00:16:00,258
to get the most constructive feedback we can.

307
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,344
We also leave the Slack channels open for the entire team to view and encourage anyone

308
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,225
in the company to join.

309
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:10,535
The functionality we're using also allows QA and product

310
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:12,737
to notice glaring issues as they happen.

311
00:16:13,197 --> 00:16:14,759
We track user device information

312
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:16,660
and the speed in which player reports come in.

313
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:20,143
Again, it's important to consider these comments in context

314
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:21,304
and with a grain of salt.

315
00:16:21,805 --> 00:16:23,686
Not every comment holds the same weight as the next,

316
00:16:23,887 --> 00:16:26,969
but it still allows your team to see what is going on

317
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:28,851
and get the general temperature of the community.

318
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,782
The fortunate part is we didn't even have to twist the arms

319
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:33,963
of our product team to join.

320
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:36,185
They wanted to hear what our players were saying.

321
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,447
And we found that traction on player feedback

322
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:40,649
through these channels was much more effective

323
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:41,990
than a weekly email summary,

324
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,731
which can often get lost in the day-to-day.

325
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:47,715
Increased community visibility on its own

326
00:16:47,735 --> 00:16:48,875
can be a bit problematic.

327
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:51,338
Even though we were pumping a lot of comments

328
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,099
of varying quality into the channels,

329
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:55,481
it's easy to get bogged down by negativity

330
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:57,543
where players don't offer additional feedback.

331
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,785
Make sure product is aware that there's lots of comments that have no additional context

332
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,968
and could potentially be there to ruin morale.

333
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:10,094
There are quite a few comments where players imply that the game is bad, dreadful, terrible,

334
00:17:10,254 --> 00:17:15,641
garbage, trash, or that it sucks, but no additional information is ever given as to why they don't

335
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:16,162
like the game.

336
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:19,616
Community is more accustomed to these comments

337
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:20,797
and can mentally weed them out

338
00:17:20,837 --> 00:17:21,997
instead of getting hung up on them.

339
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:23,898
But it's important for the product team

340
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,899
to be aware of the toll a bombardment of negativity can have

341
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,279
and find coping mechanisms in the same way

342
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,600
that the community team has to.

343
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,361
At the very least, this allows the product team

344
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:35,761
to understand and sympathize

345
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:37,242
with what the community has to go through.

346
00:17:38,662 --> 00:17:40,443
It's helpful for the team to also understand

347
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:42,023
that these comments are just the tip

348
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:43,323
of the iceberg for negativity.

349
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:49,959
Likewise, we sometimes get the exact opposite, where players will sometimes shower us in

350
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:54,242
praise and give us one star, which causes a lot of confusion for our product team.

351
00:17:54,983 --> 00:17:58,947
It's difficult to explain to them that there's simply a disconnect, and even if we were to

352
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:03,531
ask for more information or details or encourage players to rate us higher if they are indeed

353
00:18:03,591 --> 00:18:06,133
enjoying the game, they will often ignore us.

354
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:09,255
On the plus side, this type of feedback can help product

355
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:11,636
understand where to place rating prompts within the game

356
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,858
and help identify when issues

357
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:16,139
with the first-time user experience happen.

358
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,041
So despite some confusing comments,

359
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:22,223
exposing our product team to our players' feedback

360
00:18:22,523 --> 00:18:24,984
created a level of compassion that I was unprepared for.

361
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:27,446
Shortly after being exposed

362
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:29,427
to one of our public-facing community channels,

363
00:18:29,787 --> 00:18:30,848
one of our product team members

364
00:18:30,888 --> 00:18:32,389
was encouraged by player feedback

365
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:34,450
to preemptively curb complaints

366
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,511
by creating a Make It Right campaign.

367
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:42,132
The thought was that before players could even complain,

368
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:44,453
we would communicate the changes being proposed

369
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:47,214
and gift them with some currency to avoid some frustration.

370
00:18:48,055 --> 00:18:49,775
In mobile free-to-play, this type of campaign

371
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,156
can happen for balancing changes,

372
00:18:51,456 --> 00:18:53,297
but this was the first time a product team member

373
00:18:53,337 --> 00:18:55,917
at our company was the first to preemptively suggest it

374
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:58,438
without community needing to scramble last minute.

375
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:04,689
Logging in, players would be greeted with a pop-up that said that we appreciated them

376
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:07,993
as members of our community and alert them to the fact that there's been a change in

377
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:08,333
the game.

378
00:19:09,955 --> 00:19:13,718
It also had an explanation of what players were getting out of this change, in this case

379
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:14,319
a free gift.

380
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,445
And finally and most importantly, where to find this gift, which honestly is a lifesaver

381
00:19:20,485 --> 00:19:23,268
because players can never understand when something's added to their account.

382
00:19:27,737 --> 00:19:28,538
So were players happy?

383
00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:34,740
I mean, the short answer is no, but it wasn't nearly as much dissent as we were used to

384
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,721
because we were preemptively transparent about what was happening.

385
00:19:38,682 --> 00:19:43,244
Players will always hate changes, especially when those changes affect their ability to

386
00:19:43,284 --> 00:19:46,865
play more frequently or change the payouts of features within the game.

387
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,104
Even with the Make It Right campaign alert, we still saw a nearly 300% increase week over

388
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:58,028
week in complaints, which sounds bad, but compared to other features we've rolled out

389
00:19:58,048 --> 00:20:01,050
in the past, this was a walk in the park.

390
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:06,735
For instance, in this example, we had an issue with a feature that wasn't communicated well,

391
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:09,738
and then also broke, which led to an over 1,000% increase in emails.

392
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:16,885
The point is, even when it's not perfect and players are still frustrated, it helps to

393
00:20:16,946 --> 00:20:20,008
know that you're doing everything in your power to make things better by helping your

394
00:20:20,028 --> 00:20:23,071
product team understand the frustration that players are experiencing.

395
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:29,877
Here's another example of increased visibility, where players consistently complained about

396
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,579
a cool-down feature in one of our games.

397
00:20:33,043 --> 00:20:37,206
In Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, you can use something called an expert, who has expertise

398
00:20:37,246 --> 00:20:41,288
in specific subjects, and will assist you in responding to questions as a lifeline.

399
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:46,031
Players can collect experts and upgrade them to increase their efficiency, but due to a

400
00:20:46,131 --> 00:20:50,514
built-in cooldown, they'll have to wait for them to become available to use again.

401
00:20:51,655 --> 00:20:55,437
There was no communication about a cooldown anywhere in the game, and when a player's

402
00:20:55,537 --> 00:21:00,160
expert couldn't be used, there was no indication as to when they could be used again, which

403
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,201
led to a lot of player confusion.

404
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,579
We would receive multiple complaints every day asking what they were, how did they work,

405
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,402
and why they couldn't use them anymore.

406
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:15,349
So we alerted the product team about the concern and decided to work on better communicating

407
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:16,270
the cool-down feature.

408
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:22,117
Where before players had to guess which of their experts were resting, we now had a little

409
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,939
clock icon as indication.

410
00:21:25,423 --> 00:21:28,986
And additionally, where there was no cool down timer before, we now had a very noticeable

411
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:33,129
alert that said when the expert was going to be made available again to our players.

412
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:38,953
Now there certainly couldn't be any excuse as to why players didn't understand expert

413
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:39,814
cool down, right?

414
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:45,235
I mean, it's all well and good that we tried addressing such an overwhelming concern like

415
00:21:45,255 --> 00:21:47,938
this, but players were more confused than ever.

416
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,964
We were getting more and more complaints indicating that players had eventually adapted and learned

417
00:21:53,004 --> 00:21:58,029
how to use the previous lack of user interface and we're now struggling to understand how

418
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:00,412
to use something that made the feature much more clear.

419
00:22:01,884 --> 00:22:04,585
Here's another graph indicating the volatility of complaints

420
00:22:05,446 --> 00:22:08,407
about this feature prior to us implementing the fix.

421
00:22:09,148 --> 00:22:10,588
And you can probably tell where this is going

422
00:22:10,648 --> 00:22:11,949
because here are the metrics

423
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:14,270
from after we implemented the fix.

424
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,071
A major spike like this isn't unheard of,

425
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:19,493
but it felt completely opposite to the results

426
00:22:19,513 --> 00:22:20,713
that we were expecting to see.

427
00:22:21,914 --> 00:22:25,075
As community managers, we have to try to assist our players

428
00:22:25,115 --> 00:22:26,456
in better understanding changes,

429
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:28,857
even if it's a painful outcome like this.

430
00:22:30,935 --> 00:22:35,239
Last winter when we implemented avatar customization in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, players

431
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,081
were again very confused.

432
00:22:37,802 --> 00:22:41,645
The idea was to give players the opportunity to show off events they've completed by decorating

433
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:43,908
their profile with hats and unique borders.

434
00:22:44,568 --> 00:22:49,453
But product had assumed that the functionality of the feature was very clear and self-evident,

435
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,576
but based on the feedback we were receiving, this wasn't the case.

436
00:22:54,689 --> 00:22:56,291
Players were introduced to customizations,

437
00:22:56,571 --> 00:22:58,613
but the feature was sparse and only displayed

438
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:01,535
a default option that was enabled automatically

439
00:23:01,575 --> 00:23:02,116
for everyone.

440
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:05,599
There was no FAQ or even pop-up about the feature.

441
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:08,161
Players were just supposed to unlock more customizations

442
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:08,761
as they played.

443
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:12,425
We convinced the product team to show players

444
00:23:12,585 --> 00:23:15,327
what kind of rewards and customizations they could unlock

445
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,329
by showcasing them directly on the screen.

446
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,231
Players could now see what kind of customizations

447
00:23:20,271 --> 00:23:20,892
were available.

448
00:23:21,387 --> 00:23:23,909
And somehow, we even managed to convince the product team

449
00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:25,570
to throw in an FAQ tool tip,

450
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,551
just to help with any other stragglers

451
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:28,492
who still had questions.

452
00:23:30,733 --> 00:23:33,395
The initial spike, there you go,

453
00:23:33,815 --> 00:23:35,896
was the first week rolling out the feature,

454
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:39,378
a considerable increase week over week on our email count.

455
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:41,860
The initial confusion wore off

456
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,081
and we were able to respond to players with custom macros,

457
00:23:44,481 --> 00:23:47,563
but we were still receiving dozens of reports every week

458
00:23:48,023 --> 00:23:49,925
until we implemented the update.

459
00:23:51,061 --> 00:23:54,204
Once we introduce the FAQ and the additional visual aspects

460
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,886
to help clear things up, emails about the subject

461
00:23:56,946 --> 00:23:58,808
in the last month have stopped almost entirely.

462
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:02,171
Player feedback can be a bit of a mixed bag.

463
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,713
Sometimes it works out, and sometimes it doesn't.

464
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:07,315
The important thing is to let the team know

465
00:24:07,436 --> 00:24:08,917
what the community is passionate about.

466
00:24:09,718 --> 00:24:11,039
Let their voice be heard in order

467
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:12,540
to better get across concerns,

468
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,022
and ultimately attempt to make the game more clear,

469
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:17,284
even if there are road bumps along the way.

470
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:20,519
Remember, it's important to think like a product team member.

471
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:25,301
The number of emails we get aren't a main indicator of an improvement's success.

472
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:28,122
Look at the metrics and see how these features are performing.

473
00:24:29,922 --> 00:24:31,723
It's my hope that with some of these insights,

474
00:24:31,963 --> 00:24:35,104
you'll be encouraged to work more closely with your product and gaming teams

475
00:24:35,244 --> 00:24:37,805
in a way that enforces and encourages collaboration.

476
00:24:39,046 --> 00:24:40,646
Remember to think like your product team.

477
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,227
Understand what makes them tick

478
00:24:42,587 --> 00:24:45,068
and how to be able to effectively communicate what your players want.

479
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:47,922
Investigate vocal members.

480
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:50,584
Identify if these players are able to affect

481
00:24:50,684 --> 00:24:52,866
or enforce any change in your product team's eyes.

482
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,608
Finally, increase community visibility.

483
00:24:57,109 --> 00:24:59,310
Don't wait for people to ask how the community feels

484
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,571
about a change made in the game.

485
00:25:00,972 --> 00:25:02,453
Give them every opportunity to see

486
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:04,795
how it affects perception as quickly as possible.

487
00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:10,994
Working together helps your team understand the point of view of more people in your organization.

488
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:15,397
And in a perfect world, your team will start considering how the community may react to

489
00:25:15,437 --> 00:25:16,838
features before they release them.

490
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:20,600
Maybe one day you can hopefully call yourselves best friends.

491
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,931
So thanks so much for listening.

492
00:25:25,231 --> 00:25:27,832
This is a goofy photo of me and the product team.

493
00:25:27,892 --> 00:25:30,293
We really do work together literally every single day.

494
00:25:30,353 --> 00:25:31,514
I talk to every single one of them,

495
00:25:32,174 --> 00:25:34,375
and we try our best to make things work.

496
00:25:35,696 --> 00:25:38,297
In the interest of time, I can take some questions outside,

497
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:41,438
I think would be best, or at the Overlook, 3022 and 3024.

498
00:25:41,478 --> 00:25:42,159
Thanks again, everyone.
