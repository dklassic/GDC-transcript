1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,981
Welcome to GDC, everybody.

2
00:00:07,901 --> 00:00:10,663
Today we're gonna talk about my project, Keyforge,

3
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:12,824
on board game design day, Keyforge,

4
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:14,465
creating the world's first unique deck game.

5
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:16,986
I'm Brad Andrees, and let's get to it.

6
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:20,948
So, first of all, who am I?

7
00:00:21,328 --> 00:00:25,650
Well, as I just told you, I'm Brad Andrees.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,921
I'm a card game developer for Fantasy Flight Games.

9
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:33,142
I've been working there for about eight years now.

10
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:34,543
And during my time there,

11
00:00:34,563 --> 00:00:36,204
I've worked on a lot of different projects.

12
00:00:36,664 --> 00:00:38,105
So let's quickly talk about a few of them.

13
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:40,527
First game I worked on was Warhammer Invasion,

14
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:41,748
one of our LCGs.

15
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:44,810
Then another LCG, Call of Cthulhu.

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,872
Warhammer 40,000 Conquest was the next game I designed,

17
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:49,893
working with Eric Lang.

18
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:52,855
Then Legend of the Five Rings,

19
00:00:52,895 --> 00:00:55,816
the card game with Nate French and Eric Dahlman.

20
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:58,888
And last but not least, I guess this game,

21
00:00:59,188 --> 00:01:01,549
Key Forge, Call of the Archons with Richard Garfield.

22
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,511
But for today's presentation,

23
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:05,832
we're gonna talk about a couple different things.

24
00:01:06,292 --> 00:01:08,293
First of all, what the heck is Key Forge?

25
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:12,075
Then we'll talk about some of the challenges we faced

26
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,196
on making such a weird, different game,

27
00:01:14,236 --> 00:01:16,818
and we'll get exactly why this game is so weird in a minute.

28
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,940
Then we'll talk about what's next for Key Forge,

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,020
what's coming up in the future,

30
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,702
and where are we taking this concept?

31
00:01:24,362 --> 00:01:25,243
And then hopefully at the end,

32
00:01:25,263 --> 00:01:26,403
we'll have some time for questions.

33
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,851
So, what is Keyforge?

34
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:34,192
Well, Keyforge is, as you saw in the talk's title,

35
00:01:34,692 --> 00:01:36,033
the world's first unique deck game.

36
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,974
It's designed by legendary game designer Richard Garfield,

37
00:01:39,414 --> 00:01:41,634
of Magic the Gathering, Netrunner,

38
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:43,255
and recently Artifact fame.

39
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:47,916
It's very different than a traditional TCG

40
00:01:49,017 --> 00:01:49,897
in the following ways.

41
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,758
So, you know, two decks have the exact same composition.

42
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,599
Each and every deck has a unique name.

43
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:59,347
Each and every deck has a unique card back,

44
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:01,388
and decks are not customizable.

45
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:05,410
These set it apart and make it a really weird thing,

46
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,252
but how exactly do we wanna make a game like this?

47
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:14,614
We started Key Forge with a really distinct philosophy,

48
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:19,335
and I think it's best put in a quote by Richard Garfield

49
00:02:19,876 --> 00:02:20,736
that we had in the rule book.

50
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:22,857
I've always been attached

51
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:24,578
to good procedurally generated content.

52
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:29,192
Game worlds generated in this way really feel as though they belong to me, the player.

53
00:02:30,373 --> 00:02:32,795
I am often discovering them as I play.

54
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:34,897
The designer didn't even know they existed.

55
00:02:35,678 --> 00:02:39,061
Often games with such content are extremely managed experiences.

56
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:43,185
Everyone goes through the same storylines and can experience the same gameplay by making

57
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:43,986
the same decisions.

58
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:46,348
Everything they experience feels planned.

59
00:02:46,928 --> 00:02:50,191
The contrast feels to me like the difference between exploring a jungle and walking in

60
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:50,892
an amusement park.

61
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:55,630
Now what he meant by this is when you go to an amusement park, when you go to Disney World,

62
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:57,871
you know where all the rides are.

63
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:01,832
You get a map right at the beginning, you know where to get on the roller coaster, where

64
00:03:01,852 --> 00:03:05,114
to do the tilt-a-whirl, where to get your cotton candy, and where to go to the bathroom.

65
00:03:06,154 --> 00:03:09,395
And you know the kind of fun that you're going to have on all those things.

66
00:03:09,435 --> 00:03:12,056
You know how you like roller coasters, you know how you like the tilt-a-whirl.

67
00:03:14,043 --> 00:03:16,025
You walk through the jungle, you go on a safari,

68
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:18,846
you're going down a trail and you're not quite sure

69
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:19,547
what you're gonna see.

70
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:21,528
You're not sure what you're gonna experience,

71
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,609
but you know it's gonna be uniquely yours.

72
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,671
You could walk down that same trail a thousand times

73
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:29,133
and each and every time you would see different things.

74
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:30,774
You would have a different experience.

75
00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:33,655
Richard really wanted to take that concept

76
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:35,336
and capture it in a game.

77
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:37,698
One where no matter what happened,

78
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:39,339
you weren't going to run into the same decks

79
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:40,079
week after week.

80
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,161
You weren't going to have the same matchups

81
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:42,861
week after week.

82
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:43,701
You weren't.

83
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:46,585
He's gonna know what you were going to run into every week.

84
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:50,207
And so that's where his impetus for Keyforge came from.

85
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:53,868
So, what makes Keyforge unique?

86
00:03:55,148 --> 00:03:57,009
Each and every deck is an archon.

87
00:03:57,749 --> 00:04:00,130
Now, our archon is our player insert.

88
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,451
It's the way you interact with the game world,

89
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,312
and it's representative of your deck.

90
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:08,213
That character is made of a combination

91
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:11,734
between a unique card back and a unique name.

92
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,343
Now again, each and every one of these

93
00:04:14,683 --> 00:04:16,764
completely distinct throughout the entire world.

94
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:23,948
Now, each deck is made out of 37 cards.

95
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:26,430
12 of those cards are from three different houses,

96
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,872
the game's factions, and the last is an Archon card

97
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:33,154
representing your character, and on the back of it,

98
00:04:33,594 --> 00:04:36,376
showing the deck list, all the cards that are in your deck

99
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,236
and their rarities.

100
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:40,934
Now that deck consists of action cards, artifacts,

101
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,315
creatures, and upgrades, just to show you guys

102
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,637
the kinds of variety we have in there.

103
00:04:47,218 --> 00:04:49,820
Now, Key Forge is played very differently

104
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,061
than many other TCGs.

105
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:56,484
Oftentimes those games devolve into a attempt

106
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,405
to beat the other player in the face, if you will.

107
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:02,128
Whereas Key Forge is you're trying

108
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:03,308
to beat your opponent to the punch.

109
00:05:04,132 --> 00:05:05,192
It's a race to the finish.

110
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:08,694
And players will do that by collecting a resource,

111
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:11,235
or a victory point, called amber.

112
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:14,396
Now, players will collect amber throughout the game

113
00:05:14,436 --> 00:05:15,356
by doing various things.

114
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:17,577
This includes using their creatures,

115
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:21,499
playing cards, and a whole host of other ways.

116
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,400
But, as players collect amber,

117
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:27,822
if they start their turn with six of them,

118
00:05:28,582 --> 00:05:30,163
they will spend them and forge a key.

119
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:34,826
The first player to forge three keys wins the game.

120
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:39,191
However, there's a unique twist to Keyforge,

121
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:41,814
and that is that it doesn't have a resource.

122
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:45,438
Like many other games that have a mana or credits

123
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:48,421
or any sort of point you spend to play cards,

124
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:51,104
in Keyforge, you're instead going to choose

125
00:05:51,404 --> 00:05:52,886
one active house each turn.

126
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:57,004
I told you earlier that each deck consists of 12 cards

127
00:05:57,044 --> 00:05:58,085
of three different houses,

128
00:05:58,806 --> 00:06:00,527
which means that you're roughly activating

129
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,949
one third of your deck every turn.

130
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,812
When you have a house as your active house,

131
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:08,534
you're gonna be able to play cards at that house,

132
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:11,576
use cards in play, and discard cards.

133
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:14,518
So you need to really be careful how you're managing

134
00:06:14,618 --> 00:06:17,781
both the cards that are in your hand and in play,

135
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,602
so you can have the maximum amount of effect

136
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:20,403
on the game space.

137
00:06:22,345 --> 00:06:22,465
Now.

138
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,460
let's talk a little bit about the flavor of the Crucible.

139
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,640
Excuse me, Kiefforge.

140
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,301
So, Kiefforge takes place on a world called the Crucible.

141
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:33,922
It's an artificial planet in the center of the universe,

142
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:36,803
and it's made by some mysterious beings

143
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:38,863
that people don't really know that much about

144
00:06:38,923 --> 00:06:39,503
on the Crucible.

145
00:06:39,603 --> 00:06:40,664
They're called the Architects.

146
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:42,844
At least, that's what everyone calls them.

147
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:45,525
And, the only native inhabitants

148
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:47,385
of the Crucible are the Archons.

149
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:53,797
They show up mysteriously and do various deeds across the land and earn their names that

150
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:53,997
way.

151
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:57,238
The other native thing to the crucible is amber.

152
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:03,180
As we previously talked about, it grows pretty much everywhere and is a psychoreactive substance,

153
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,921
meaning that it responds to the hopes, dreams, and thoughts of the people that hold it or

154
00:07:07,981 --> 00:07:08,541
try to use it.

155
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:12,722
Of course, the Crucible being an artificial planet,

156
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:16,825
it is made of the pieces of hundreds of thousands

157
00:07:16,865 --> 00:07:18,786
of different worlds from across the universe.

158
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,968
Now, that means when you take a piece of the world,

159
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:24,890
put it on the Crucible, it means that all the wildlife,

160
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,472
all the people, all the different things come with it,

161
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:29,893
merging together and bringing countless

162
00:07:29,953 --> 00:07:31,014
alien cultures together.

163
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:34,556
Now those cultures work together to try and survive

164
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:36,217
such a weird and strange world.

165
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:39,239
And let's talk a little bit about those cultures.

166
00:07:40,382 --> 00:07:41,882
First of which is the Bravnar,

167
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,803
which are our Viking techno-barbarians.

168
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:47,605
They're full of giants and goblins,

169
00:07:47,685 --> 00:07:51,246
and they believe that the strongest are the most right,

170
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:52,167
the most correct,

171
00:07:52,707 --> 00:07:54,087
and so that's how they live their society.

172
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:58,069
Now, mechanically, that means they focus on fighting.

173
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:00,530
They love getting in a good scrap,

174
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,371
and they have the powerful creatures

175
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:05,432
that they need to back it up.

176
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:08,905
They also have lots of abilities to deal direct damage.

177
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:10,646
You know, just playing a card

178
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,407
and dealing three damage to something.

179
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:16,689
The Deice are bizarre demons and imps

180
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:18,410
that live below the surface of the crucible.

181
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,012
And they are entirely incapable of emotion themselves,

182
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:26,113
so they need to steal the emotions of others

183
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,274
by capturing an enabler.

184
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:31,195
Now their mechanics focus on board control,

185
00:08:31,536 --> 00:08:33,156
hand manipulation, and parrying effects,

186
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:36,038
making them kind of our catch-all control faction.

187
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:41,156
The Logos, my personal favorite,

188
00:08:41,716 --> 00:08:43,858
are the mad scientists of the Crucible.

189
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:47,880
They tinker and experiment constantly

190
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,362
and have kind of forgotten what their previous bodies

191
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:53,904
looked like as they've modified themselves with cybernetics.

192
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:57,105
They're very much science for the sake of science,

193
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:59,827
asking can they rather than should they.

194
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:02,128
Mechanically.

195
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,001
They focus on hand management, drawing cards,

196
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:07,522
putting cards aside for later,

197
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:11,024
discarding cards from their hand to improve their draw,

198
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:14,367
and cross-faction play, letting them continue

199
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:16,448
to manage that hand and the board state.

200
00:09:16,908 --> 00:09:19,030
They also have more artifacts than any other faction,

201
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,071
which makes sense for all the gizmos

202
00:09:21,131 --> 00:09:22,692
and gadgets they're always creating.

203
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:26,695
Next, a little closer to home, is Mars.

204
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:30,570
which literally classic sci-fi Martians.

205
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,772
They live in a two-tiered society

206
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:36,576
with the taller Martians being in control

207
00:09:36,596 --> 00:09:37,336
of the shorter ones,

208
00:09:37,396 --> 00:09:39,258
and I don't know where that idea came from.

209
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,682
But they're very, very xenophobic.

210
00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:45,705
They don't, at least the taller ones are,

211
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:48,207
and they don't get along as well

212
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:49,508
with everyone else on the crucible.

213
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,460
Now this is reflected in their mechanics

214
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,760
in that they're very self-synergistic.

215
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:57,041
They work very well with themselves,

216
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:58,901
but not with other factions.

217
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:01,602
They also have powerful abduction effects,

218
00:10:01,682 --> 00:10:04,262
causing your opponent to capture their own amber,

219
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:07,103
so when you destroy their creatures, you get it instead.

220
00:10:08,063 --> 00:10:09,963
In addition to that, they have key defense effects,

221
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:12,103
increasing the cost of your opponent's keys,

222
00:10:12,624 --> 00:10:14,544
so they have to gather more and more amber

223
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:15,904
in order to be able to beat you.

224
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:18,985
The Sanctum.

225
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,139
a religious order of knights and spirits.

226
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:26,400
They live on floating cities throughout the crucible

227
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,521
and try and maintain law and order the best they can.

228
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:33,361
And they're on a quest for enlightenment,

229
00:10:33,742 --> 00:10:36,542
trying to figure out exactly why they're here

230
00:10:36,562 --> 00:10:39,883
on the crucible and gain transcendence from it.

231
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:44,304
Mechanically, they're very defense-focused.

232
00:10:44,805 --> 00:10:47,425
They have more armor in their faction than any other.

233
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:50,407
and armor allows them to shrug off damage.

234
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:54,493
They also, to benefit that, have a lot of healing,

235
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:56,075
so if you do manage to damage them,

236
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,438
they have the capability to heal that right up.

237
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,723
They'll also prevent their opponent

238
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:04,407
from being able to forge keys by taking their amber away

239
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:05,708
and holding onto it for a bit.

240
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:12,377
The Shadows is a sneaky society of thieves full of dark elves,

241
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,959
and they love, love amassing treasure.

242
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:16,240
They can't get enough of it.

243
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:19,723
And more just the physical act of taking it and hoarding it

244
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:22,385
rather than exactly what that treasure is.

245
00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:26,808
So after coming to the Crucible, they fell in love with Amber.

246
00:11:29,797 --> 00:11:31,798
Now, mechanically, it makes sense.

247
00:11:31,838 --> 00:11:32,879
They have amber control.

248
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,060
They are the best faction at stealing amber

249
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,462
from their opponent, which is an extremely effective way

250
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:40,423
of gaining it yourself.

251
00:11:41,723 --> 00:11:42,544
And also hard to hit.

252
00:11:42,824 --> 00:11:44,605
They have a lot of the keyword elusive,

253
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:46,806
which means that your opponent will have to spend

254
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:48,707
two creatures for every one they attack.

255
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,068
And they get some pinging damage

256
00:11:51,148 --> 00:11:52,328
for harrying their opponent,

257
00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:53,789
doing a point of damage here and there

258
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:55,330
and softening them up for some of their

259
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,151
smaller creatures to finish off.

260
00:11:58,724 --> 00:12:01,025
Last but not least, it's the untamed.

261
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,225
They represent the flora and fauna of the crucible.

262
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:07,926
The beasts, fairies, and witches that live in the wilds,

263
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:11,267
either by choice or because they've been shunned

264
00:12:11,307 --> 00:12:12,067
by their communities.

265
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:15,008
And using the effects of amber,

266
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:16,388
they have mutated themselves,

267
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:19,509
often into bigger, stranger, and more powerful forms.

268
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:25,370
Mechanically, untamed is the best house at gaining amber,

269
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,991
just pure amber gain.

270
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:30,857
And that coupled with their ability to instant ki-bai

271
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:32,838
outside of that first step of the turn

272
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:34,980
makes them a formidable force.

273
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,562
They also can get their cards back from the discard pile

274
00:12:38,602 --> 00:12:39,783
more frequently than any other.

275
00:12:41,324 --> 00:12:43,385
So what challenges did we face during the development

276
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:43,905
of this game?

277
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:46,727
So I'm going to talk to you about three

278
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:47,988
different categories of challenges

279
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:49,909
today, the first of which being mechanical.

280
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:53,091
Next, we'll talk about the testing we did,

281
00:12:53,852 --> 00:12:55,952
and then we'll talk about the user experience,

282
00:12:56,032 --> 00:12:57,812
how we made this game work

283
00:12:58,532 --> 00:13:00,573
with such a strange and different concept.

284
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:03,914
So, mechanical.

285
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:06,334
What types of challenges did we face?

286
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:10,135
We had to figure out how we were gonna make decks

287
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:11,775
that were entirely unique,

288
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:13,415
how we were gonna ensure

289
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:15,316
that those decks were entirely unique,

290
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:17,416
how we were gonna figure out

291
00:13:17,456 --> 00:13:18,977
how each of these decks was gonna be named.

292
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:22,153
and how we were gonna, how the heck we were gonna

293
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:24,215
possibly make card backs unique

294
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:25,556
for every single deck out there.

295
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:29,679
So, how does a deck mean?

296
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,642
We have the almighty algorithm to thank for that.

297
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:39,246
The algorithm is a collection of tons of different rules,

298
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:44,429
regulations, and restrictions that cause a deck to, whoa,

299
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,239
be in the form that we desire.

300
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,960
When a deck, when we hit the button to make a deck,

301
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,620
the first thing the algorithm does

302
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,041
is collect all those rules.

303
00:13:54,961 --> 00:13:57,381
Gets them together, some of these are as simple as like,

304
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:01,442
there's 37 cards in the deck, and one Archon card.

305
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:04,243
There's three houses, those sort of things.

306
00:14:04,283 --> 00:14:06,603
Basic stuff all the way up to very, very,

307
00:14:07,403 --> 00:14:10,004
very interesting stuff I wish I could tell you more about.

308
00:14:10,124 --> 00:14:15,445
But, the next step is it's gonna choose houses for that deck.

309
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:20,605
And this is important because those houses

310
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:22,727
are gonna dictate all the other choices

311
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:25,189
that the algorithm is making when it's building a deck.

312
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,672
Then it's gonna start to generate some cards.

313
00:14:30,393 --> 00:14:31,734
And it goes one faction at a time,

314
00:14:32,535 --> 00:14:35,597
filling in the deck list with all of the different cards

315
00:14:36,318 --> 00:14:37,959
that can possibly be in it.

316
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,303
Now, when it's doing that, each time it's generating a card

317
00:14:42,803 --> 00:14:44,445
it's making a rarity calculation

318
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:46,306
when it's rolling that card individually.

319
00:14:47,312 --> 00:14:50,035
Then it's looking if there's any variance of that card.

320
00:14:50,796 --> 00:14:53,899
Now this would be example that some cards in Key Forge

321
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:55,621
have more than one version of that card.

322
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,726
Master of one, two, and three is a perfect example.

323
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:02,750
It's a card that all of the numerical values on the card

324
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,352
change for each different version.

325
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:06,334
And you never know which one you're gonna get.

326
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:07,335
Now.

327
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:09,614
There's also some companion cards,

328
00:15:10,215 --> 00:15:12,956
a card that always comes with a different card.

329
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:14,837
And if you look under the logos,

330
00:15:14,857 --> 00:15:15,757
the center section there,

331
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:17,918
you can see that there is a time traveler

332
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,279
and help from future self there.

333
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,541
Now, those cards always come together.

334
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:24,341
You never see them separate.

335
00:15:24,642 --> 00:15:26,823
And they have a strong synergy with one another

336
00:15:26,963 --> 00:15:27,723
and interact well.

337
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:31,945
Now, brace yourselves.

338
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:33,786
We got a math alert.

339
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,751
So if you have a weak constitution,

340
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,032
I'd recommend leaving the room now.

341
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:42,074
Because we're going to talk about ensuring uniqueness.

342
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:46,236
Now, to do this, we're first going to talk

343
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:48,858
about the maximum number of decks.

344
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:52,339
There's 369 non-fixed cards in Keyforge,

345
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,840
and 36 card per deck.

346
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,821
Which means we can take 369 to the 36th power,

347
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:57,282
which gives us 259 Novemvignantelian decks.

348
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:09,687
Now, big number, but most of these decks ignore our rules.

349
00:16:10,688 --> 00:16:12,690
They're just an abstract possibility.

350
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,012
We have cards that are divided by house,

351
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:17,574
we have cards that are different rarities,

352
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:20,416
and we have a ton of other rules that dictate

353
00:16:20,476 --> 00:16:22,778
exactly what cards can possibly go into a deck.

354
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:26,120
Now, if we take all of those into consideration,

355
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:29,343
we get a much, much more reasonable 104 octillion decks.

356
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,716
which is still enough for each person on the planet

357
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:36,338
to have billions and billions of decks unique to them.

358
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:41,461
But how do we solve this?

359
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:46,023
We actually have a really interesting mathematical problem

360
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:47,144
called the birthday problem,

361
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:50,445
and that states that if you get a group of people together,

362
00:16:50,826 --> 00:16:51,986
such as we are here today,

363
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:55,328
that the possibility that they have a shared birthday

364
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:58,189
between two of the people in a particular group,

365
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:01,321
is dictated by this equation.

366
00:17:02,082 --> 00:17:05,485
Now, at 23 people in a room,

367
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:09,909
there's a 50% probability that two people have the same birthday.

368
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:15,014
And at 70 people, there's a 99.9% probability.

369
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,696
So I think we probably have two people

370
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,198
that have the same birthday in the room today.

371
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,987
Now, we've analyzed this for Keyforge,

372
00:17:22,448 --> 00:17:24,609
where D is the number of possible decks,

373
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,869
and N is the number of decks we generate,

374
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,370
we can get a table that looks something like this.

375
00:17:30,931 --> 00:17:34,973
So, on the left is the number of decks we generate,

376
00:17:35,773 --> 00:17:38,494
and in the center is the expected number of duplicate decks.

377
00:17:38,514 --> 00:17:43,296
So you can see that it takes us making 15 trillion decks

378
00:17:43,716 --> 00:17:46,817
before we can even expect to see one duplicate.

379
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:47,918
And...

380
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:50,542
I can tell you we haven't made that many.

381
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:56,325
But just in case, we also do a uniqueness check.

382
00:17:56,526 --> 00:17:58,887
That checks a code against every other deck

383
00:17:58,907 --> 00:18:00,928
that's been generated just to ensure

384
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:02,810
that no two decks have the same composition.

385
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,132
So, there you go.

386
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:09,474
Now, in terms of making card backs,

387
00:18:09,694 --> 00:18:11,395
we use a multi-part construction

388
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:13,216
consisting of seven different pieces.

389
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:17,059
Now, first is the body, the head,

390
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:18,640
the left and right arm.

391
00:18:19,613 --> 00:18:22,654
the background, the symbol in the center of the card,

392
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:23,535
and the color.

393
00:18:23,555 --> 00:18:26,136
Now these are all randomly generated

394
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:29,298
because well, there's no other way

395
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:31,859
to do this part of the card.

396
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:35,501
But it's very interesting because the only way

397
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:37,762
we can make this game is through digital printing.

398
00:18:39,362 --> 00:18:42,264
Traditional printing methods for a card game

399
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:43,985
or even a board game don't apply here

400
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:47,687
because typically board games use a process

401
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:49,047
called black plate replacement.

402
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:53,275
They print their cyan, magenta, and yellow layers first,

403
00:18:53,695 --> 00:18:55,357
and then they leave the black layer separate

404
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:58,359
so that they can print in multiple different languages

405
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:01,882
and they don't have to pay for more plates that way.

406
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,745
Now, we have to use digital printing because Key Forge,

407
00:19:06,225 --> 00:19:08,246
well, we're only printing one of each deck.

408
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:10,728
We're not trying to print a ton of the same deck.

409
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:13,110
So, that's the only way we could go.

410
00:19:14,493 --> 00:19:18,095
Additionally, we do a uniqueness check for card backs

411
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,216
by giving each and every piece of a card back

412
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:22,996
a unique part of a code.

413
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,017
When you line those codes all up,

414
00:19:25,337 --> 00:19:27,698
we can quickly check those numbers against one another

415
00:19:28,138 --> 00:19:30,479
and tell if we've used the same card back before.

416
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,280
Now, another unique thing we have to do

417
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,401
is figure out how decks get named.

418
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:38,962
To do that,

419
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,072
we have built a series of blueprints

420
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:43,794
that look sort of like this,

421
00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:45,496
and by sort I mean exactly like this,

422
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:50,501
that generates all of those different names

423
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:51,282
that you might have seen.

424
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:56,188
Now, those blueprints are filled out by word lists.

425
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:58,230
We have 18 different ones.

426
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,952
I'd tell you exactly what they were,

427
00:20:00,072 --> 00:20:01,513
but that'd be telling too much.

428
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,877
But those word lists are pulled in

429
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:08,580
to fill in those blueprints based on the different

430
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:11,602
qualities of the cards in the deck.

431
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,204
Whether it's a card that's more aggressive,

432
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:17,667
deals damage, prevents your opponent from forging keys,

433
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:21,831
all of those factor in to the eventual name of that archon.

434
00:20:22,331 --> 00:20:25,193
They qualify that deck for those different word lists.

435
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,556
And once the deck has gone through

436
00:20:28,616 --> 00:20:30,418
and checked for all the word lists it qualifies for,

437
00:20:31,218 --> 00:20:32,999
Then, all the word lists get,

438
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,019
the blueprints get filled out,

439
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,940
and you can see we get stuff like

440
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,961
Enforcer Wessel RepoFace,

441
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:41,402
the man who notably yearns for height,

442
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:42,143
that's not me,

443
00:20:43,363 --> 00:20:44,864
and the king that surrounds porridge.

444
00:20:46,384 --> 00:20:49,406
And again, we take these and we do a uniqueness check

445
00:20:49,806 --> 00:20:51,947
to make sure we're not repeating ourselves

446
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:54,388
and that each and every name is unique

447
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:55,888
to the person that opens it.

448
00:20:57,762 --> 00:21:01,264
Now, so that gets past some of our mechanical hiccups

449
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:02,564
we had to figure out and solve,

450
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:05,205
but how did we test this game?

451
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:07,986
I'm gonna talk about a little bit about our methodology

452
00:21:08,626 --> 00:21:10,887
and some of the questions we wanted to answer

453
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:12,268
from our testing.

454
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:14,769
So, in terms of methodology,

455
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,170
we used an advanced specialized technique.

456
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,071
We played it a lot.

457
00:21:21,871 --> 00:21:23,512
We used over 40 different groups,

458
00:21:23,592 --> 00:21:25,733
which is much more than typical for Key Forge.

459
00:21:26,347 --> 00:21:28,629
And we had over two years of testing,

460
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:31,932
both internally, externally, and through our beta tests.

461
00:21:32,512 --> 00:21:33,833
This was an intense period,

462
00:21:34,053 --> 00:21:36,535
and we used a lot of different internal techniques

463
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,638
to answer some of the most compelling questions to us

464
00:21:40,738 --> 00:21:43,000
about what makes Key Forge tick.

465
00:21:43,981 --> 00:21:47,323
Those focused on player skill versus deck strength.

466
00:21:48,286 --> 00:21:51,869
which is more influential to the success of a player.

467
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:55,711
And to do that, we broke it down into three different tasks.

468
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:57,813
The first two I'm gonna tell you about right now,

469
00:21:57,953 --> 00:22:01,936
and we'll get to the third in the third section of the talk.

470
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,999
Now, how influential is deck composition?

471
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,320
Task one.

472
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:12,584
We created 60 different decks and divided those 60 decks

473
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,765
into 10 groups of six.

474
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:15,906
Then we.

475
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:21,452
split those groups among our testing groups,

476
00:22:21,832 --> 00:22:23,913
doing this four times for our 40 different groups.

477
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:26,953
Now, group A, or excuse me, group one,

478
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:30,074
would receive decks from set A and B,

479
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:33,135
two from B and C, and so on and so forth.

480
00:22:33,535 --> 00:22:34,896
This ensured that each deck

481
00:22:35,616 --> 00:22:37,776
existed in two different environments,

482
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:39,257
and we could see how.

483
00:22:41,168 --> 00:22:43,468
its success in those different environments would vary.

484
00:22:43,969 --> 00:22:45,429
And this would give us an idea

485
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:47,469
of how important that composition was,

486
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:49,290
regardless of who was playing that deck.

487
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,711
Now, when we did this,

488
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:54,331
we had some really encouraging meta-implications.

489
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:56,592
We had some decks that would dominate

490
00:22:56,952 --> 00:22:58,772
in both different groups they were in,

491
00:22:59,272 --> 00:23:00,953
some that would only dominate in one,

492
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,153
and some that would dominate in neither.

493
00:23:04,294 --> 00:23:05,874
And to us, that felt like,

494
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:10,055
man, there's a lot of possibilities for Key Forge.

495
00:23:10,415 --> 00:23:10,555
And...

496
00:23:11,176 --> 00:23:14,098
your local meta is going to be so interesting,

497
00:23:14,338 --> 00:23:16,040
and when you go to a different tournament,

498
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,921
that can be completely different.

499
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:21,124
That furthers the idea of discovery

500
00:23:21,184 --> 00:23:23,786
that we wanted to bring forth for the players,

501
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:26,128
and it's always been at our core

502
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,509
of what makes Key Forge so fun and interesting,

503
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:29,970
is there's always something to discover.

504
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:34,574
Now, task two, we wanted to figure out

505
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,036
how important is player skill?

506
00:23:38,955 --> 00:23:41,296
So we had players take some of their favorite decks

507
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,416
from the first part of testing

508
00:23:42,877 --> 00:23:45,377
and play a series of 20 matches with them.

509
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:49,279
Now, after 10 matches, the players would switch decks.

510
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:53,000
That way we could see whether it was the player skill

511
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,040
or the deck strength that was really

512
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:56,941
the culprit behind the success.

513
00:23:57,861 --> 00:24:00,742
And we often found that higher skilled players

514
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:02,623
would in fact win more games in total

515
00:24:02,863 --> 00:24:04,323
regardless of what deck they were using.

516
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:08,211
This is very encouraging because it meant that a player

517
00:24:08,351 --> 00:24:11,533
could, in fact, be more skilled at Keyforged than another,

518
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:14,935
which with a game with such variety

519
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,937
was really an important thing for us to find out.

520
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,159
Now, last but not least,

521
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,401
let's talk about the user experience.

522
00:24:24,101 --> 00:24:25,422
How do you engage a player base

523
00:24:25,462 --> 00:24:28,084
with a game that's so bizarre and different?

524
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:30,126
How do you make them feel like

525
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,347
this is something they can rely on and invest in?

526
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:38,470
We focused on ease of entry, flexibility in product,

527
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,311
and making sure that players had tons of resources

528
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:45,392
to aid their engagement, involvement in Key Forge.

529
00:24:47,212 --> 00:24:49,953
So first of all, ease of entry started

530
00:24:50,293 --> 00:24:52,393
from day one in design.

531
00:24:53,094 --> 00:24:55,774
We wanted to create a low barrier of entry

532
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,915
just in how the game was put together.

533
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:01,516
We did this by creating a streamlined series

534
00:25:01,556 --> 00:25:02,436
of decision points.

535
00:25:03,347 --> 00:25:07,289
Now this means that each turn, you're selecting an active house.

536
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,811
This unclutters a turn.

537
00:25:11,071 --> 00:25:15,914
It makes it much more easy to process and go through because you're making your hardest

538
00:25:15,954 --> 00:25:17,275
decision right at the beginning.

539
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:22,517
After you've made that hard decision, you're just left with a series of smaller, lighter

540
00:25:22,557 --> 00:25:25,219
decisions of what order are you going to do things in.

541
00:25:26,122 --> 00:25:28,965
This alleviates a lot of analysis paralysis

542
00:25:29,025 --> 00:25:31,527
that players face, because once they've made

543
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,769
that hard decision, they just can go to the races.

544
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,773
We also used a lot of warm language on cards,

545
00:25:38,353 --> 00:25:40,034
making it really easy to read

546
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:41,676
and understand what effects did.

547
00:25:42,637 --> 00:25:44,518
This is important because players can often

548
00:25:44,538 --> 00:25:46,380
feel intimidated when they pick up a card

549
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:48,542
and they have no idea how it functions.

550
00:25:49,363 --> 00:25:53,306
So, that was something we made sure to focus on very early.

551
00:25:54,323 --> 00:25:57,546
We also wanted to have simple card effects be at common.

552
00:25:57,826 --> 00:26:00,769
Now, common cards are the most frequently pulled into decks.

553
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,672
And so by having more simple effects there,

554
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:08,295
ones that were easy to grok, understand, and play with.

555
00:26:09,315 --> 00:26:12,977
we made sure that we kept the complexity of the game lower.

556
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:17,159
In fact, the main philosophy behind rarity in Key Forge

557
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:20,520
is focused not on power level, like in many other games,

558
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:24,542
but on how complex the card is, how involved the card is

559
00:26:24,602 --> 00:26:27,224
for a player to use, and how much game knowledge is

560
00:26:27,264 --> 00:26:27,744
required.

561
00:26:28,244 --> 00:26:30,725
That way, as a player buys and continues

562
00:26:30,745 --> 00:26:34,287
their Key Forge career, they can learn those complexities

563
00:26:34,307 --> 00:26:35,428
a small bit at a time.

564
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:38,069
Each time they play a game and encounter a new rare.

565
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:40,769
then they'll learn something more about the game.

566
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,013
We often have players, even now,

567
00:26:44,473 --> 00:26:46,816
discovering new rares that they've never seen before,

568
00:26:47,477 --> 00:26:50,019
which, again, is another point of discovery

569
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,661
and fun for a player.

570
00:26:53,643 --> 00:26:56,967
We also wanted to have ease of entry in product design.

571
00:26:57,548 --> 00:26:59,370
We focused on a low cost for decks.

572
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:01,830
early, early on in the process.

573
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,572
We determined we wanted decks to be $9.95

574
00:27:05,112 --> 00:27:07,634
so that anyone could come in, pick up a deck of Keyforge,

575
00:27:07,674 --> 00:27:08,414
and just start playing.

576
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:14,298
Now, also coupled with only needing a single purchase

577
00:27:14,338 --> 00:27:15,179
to play Keyforge.

578
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,220
Sure, you can buy our starter set,

579
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:19,582
but any player is just as well equipped

580
00:27:19,642 --> 00:27:22,124
by going to their store and picking up a single Archon deck.

581
00:27:23,405 --> 00:27:25,826
And I've often heard players say something like, hey,

582
00:27:26,327 --> 00:27:27,528
I'll get your first Keyforge.

583
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:30,812
just implying that they'll walk into the store

584
00:27:30,892 --> 00:27:33,835
and both buy Archon decks and sit down and play a new game,

585
00:27:34,335 --> 00:27:37,317
having again that moment of discovery of this new deck.

586
00:27:38,598 --> 00:27:40,199
We also included quick start rules,

587
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,101
both online and in the starter set,

588
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,303
that allowed a player to get going in 10 to 15 minutes.

589
00:27:46,004 --> 00:27:48,926
That way there's no fumbling through a rule book

590
00:27:48,986 --> 00:27:49,826
for an hour or two.

591
00:27:50,027 --> 00:27:52,008
You can get going and start playing Key Forge

592
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:52,949
as soon as possible.

593
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,572
This flexibility in product is also reflected

594
00:27:57,712 --> 00:27:57,852
in our...

595
00:27:59,861 --> 00:28:02,162
enormous pile of formats, of which I'll share

596
00:28:02,202 --> 00:28:03,443
just a few with you guys today.

597
00:28:05,304 --> 00:28:08,085
Formats meaning how a player plays the game

598
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:11,627
and what structure is a tournament set up in.

599
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:15,688
So, sealed, meaning that you show up to your game store,

600
00:28:15,889 --> 00:28:18,170
you buy a single Archon deck, you open it up,

601
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,670
and then you play a tournament with it.

602
00:28:20,691 --> 00:28:24,292
This fosters so many different interesting discovery moments

603
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:26,053
as you're learning how your deck plays,

604
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:28,134
along with everyone else that's learning

605
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:28,895
how their deck plays.

606
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,043
Archon format is our bring your best deck

607
00:28:33,544 --> 00:28:34,946
and play a tournament with it format.

608
00:28:35,487 --> 00:28:37,730
It's our most bread and butter vanilla format,

609
00:28:38,672 --> 00:28:43,419
which more TCG players will be at ease with,

610
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,822
and will be able to understand.

611
00:28:47,302 --> 00:28:49,943
Adaptive is one of our more interesting formats

612
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:53,124
in which players will bring their decks,

613
00:28:53,344 --> 00:28:54,264
they'll play a game with them,

614
00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:57,205
and then they'll switch decks with their opponent,

615
00:28:57,745 --> 00:28:58,785
playing a second game.

616
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:03,307
Then, if each player has won one game at that point,

617
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:05,927
players will then bid chains for the deck

618
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:06,908
that won both games.

619
00:29:09,788 --> 00:29:11,509
We'll get to what chains are in a minute, excuse me.

620
00:29:12,787 --> 00:29:13,948
We also have survival format,

621
00:29:14,268 --> 00:29:15,990
in which players will bring multiple decks,

622
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,612
and each time they lose with one of those decks,

623
00:29:19,032 --> 00:29:20,233
that deck is out of the tournament.

624
00:29:20,774 --> 00:29:22,555
The last player with decks left wins.

625
00:29:24,677 --> 00:29:27,999
Then, reversal, in which players bring a deck

626
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,102
they feel like they can beat, they know how to beat.

627
00:29:31,923 --> 00:29:33,604
And, at the beginning of each tournament round,

628
00:29:33,844 --> 00:29:35,245
they'll switch decks with their opponent,

629
00:29:35,345 --> 00:29:38,168
who has also brought a deck they feel like they can beat.

630
00:29:38,984 --> 00:29:40,605
and you'll play against the same deck

631
00:29:40,966 --> 00:29:42,307
every single round of the tournament

632
00:29:42,888 --> 00:29:46,472
instead of playing and play with a new deck every round,

633
00:29:47,893 --> 00:29:50,296
which has been a really fun and exciting format

634
00:29:50,476 --> 00:29:52,999
that has added a lot of value to decks

635
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:56,503
that players may not feel like are up to par

636
00:29:56,543 --> 00:29:57,544
with some of their other decks,

637
00:29:57,904 --> 00:30:01,068
meaning that more of your purchases are in fact valuable.

638
00:30:03,118 --> 00:30:07,599
So, I mentioned I'd talk about chains and task three earlier, and here they are.

639
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:12,080
Chains are a handicapping mechanic we've added to Keyforge.

640
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,701
And it's really important because it allows players to even the odds.

641
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:22,443
No matter what decks that you open, you can always use chains to bring those decks into

642
00:30:22,503 --> 00:30:23,383
parity with one another.

643
00:30:23,983 --> 00:30:28,304
So even if you only want to go out and buy two decks and play with a friend.

644
00:30:29,386 --> 00:30:30,886
you'll be able to play those two decks

645
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:31,927
no matter how good they are.

646
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:36,988
Chains are a mechanic that restrict the number of cards

647
00:30:37,008 --> 00:30:38,589
you're allowed to draw at the end of your turn,

648
00:30:39,189 --> 00:30:41,389
slowing down decks that earn more of them

649
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,670
and giving decks that don't have chains

650
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,851
a better chance against them.

651
00:30:46,531 --> 00:30:48,971
There's also powerful cards in the game

652
00:30:49,392 --> 00:30:50,932
that cause a player to gain chains,

653
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:53,633
meaning that if you push too hard,

654
00:30:54,073 --> 00:30:55,373
you may be causing yourself.

655
00:30:56,931 --> 00:30:57,931
the game because of it.

656
00:30:59,552 --> 00:31:02,213
Additionally, our weekly tournament type

657
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:03,754
is called a chain-bound tournament.

658
00:31:04,314 --> 00:31:07,676
This lets us use chains to help regulate a local metagame.

659
00:31:08,877 --> 00:31:10,498
Every week that a player comes and plays,

660
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,559
depending on how successful they are during that week,

661
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,921
their chains are added to their deck,

662
00:31:16,681 --> 00:31:19,202
which will then be there in subsequent weeks of the tournament.

663
00:31:20,243 --> 00:31:21,123
So, as...

664
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:25,091
The weeks go on, the meta at the local level

665
00:31:25,191 --> 00:31:26,251
will be changed by this.

666
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,832
Players that will rank up their decks in chains

667
00:31:30,112 --> 00:31:32,133
will then have to either continue playing

668
00:31:32,193 --> 00:31:35,713
with a handicapped deck or switch to a different deck.

669
00:31:36,073 --> 00:31:38,474
Meaning that every week you come to play at Key Forge

670
00:31:39,054 --> 00:31:40,594
is a different, different story,

671
00:31:40,695 --> 00:31:42,295
giving you another moment of discovery.

672
00:31:44,355 --> 00:31:47,356
We also wanted to give tons of different player resources.

673
00:31:47,876 --> 00:31:50,957
And these all focused on our Master Vault app and website.

674
00:31:52,017 --> 00:31:52,137
Yeah.

675
00:31:52,974 --> 00:31:56,262
Master Vault app and website provides a reference hub for players.

676
00:31:56,562 --> 00:31:58,888
A place to go and find all things Keyforge.

677
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:02,523
There we track the decks, how many chains they have,

678
00:32:03,164 --> 00:32:05,705
and the number of wins and losses they've had in tournament play.

679
00:32:06,346 --> 00:32:09,869
It also shows off a mechanic we call the power level of the deck.

680
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:12,851
Now this ensures that decks that are doing well

681
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:14,952
are increasing in power levels,

682
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:19,636
and each different type of tournament or experience we have for players

683
00:32:19,996 --> 00:32:21,837
has a power level regulation

684
00:32:22,058 --> 00:32:26,141
in which you can't play decks above a certain power level in that.

685
00:32:26,641 --> 00:32:26,981
That means...

686
00:32:27,787 --> 00:32:30,068
For example, we just had a vault tour this last weekend.

687
00:32:30,888 --> 00:32:32,789
It's our premium play experience.

688
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:36,470
Each deck that won the vault tour is now power level eight,

689
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,791
meaning that those decks can't compete

690
00:32:39,911 --> 00:32:41,872
at those weekly chain-bound tournaments anymore

691
00:32:42,472 --> 00:32:43,633
because those decks have proven

692
00:32:43,673 --> 00:32:44,993
exactly how powerful they are.

693
00:32:45,593 --> 00:32:47,874
And we can let the chain-bound tournaments

694
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:49,635
that those decks would normally participate in

695
00:32:49,975 --> 00:32:50,875
evolve and change.

696
00:32:52,476 --> 00:32:55,337
The Master Vault website also allows players

697
00:32:55,357 --> 00:32:56,957
to find stores with Key Forge events.

698
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,282
I'm also happy to say that that number of decks registered

699
00:33:00,302 --> 00:33:01,142
you see down in the corner,

700
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,726
passed 700,000 just a couple days ago.

701
00:33:08,228 --> 00:33:09,970
But, what's next for Keyforge?

702
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:14,474
And that is our first new set called Age of Ascension,

703
00:33:14,754 --> 00:33:16,415
just announced about a month ago.

704
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:21,320
Now, Age of Ascension is gonna add 204 new cards

705
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,641
to the Keyforge environment.

706
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,794
It's also gonna bring along 166 cards

707
00:33:26,914 --> 00:33:28,757
from the first set, Call of the Archons.

708
00:33:29,418 --> 00:33:31,501
Now this is really intriguing and interesting

709
00:33:32,002 --> 00:33:33,705
because most other TCGs.

710
00:33:34,437 --> 00:33:35,758
wouldn't be able to do something like this

711
00:33:35,878 --> 00:33:37,498
because players already have those cards.

712
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:39,159
They wouldn't want more of them.

713
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:43,801
But in Key Forge, those 166 cards are given new life,

714
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,602
a new experience because they're alongside

715
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:48,303
204 completely new cards.

716
00:33:48,743 --> 00:33:52,524
The value of those 166 cards changes inherently

717
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,705
based on the other cards that are in your deck.

718
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:56,686
So you'll see powerful favorites,

719
00:33:57,186 --> 00:33:59,507
but they're gonna be in a completely new context

720
00:33:59,887 --> 00:34:03,308
allowing you to discover them all over again.

721
00:34:05,747 --> 00:34:09,191
Additionally, we also have a legacy card mechanic.

722
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:13,155
Now, legacy cards are rare cards

723
00:34:13,696 --> 00:34:15,298
that are from previous sets,

724
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,661
and they're pulled into the current set.

725
00:34:18,585 --> 00:34:19,966
Again, only very rarely.

726
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:23,289
This means that every single card that is in

727
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:25,611
Call of the Archons can be found

728
00:34:25,991 --> 00:34:27,152
in an Age of Ascension deck.

729
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,614
And when a player finds one of those legacy cards,

730
00:34:29,994 --> 00:34:32,436
it acts as another cool moment of discovery.

731
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:33,897
Something new, something different,

732
00:34:34,278 --> 00:34:35,479
something they weren't expecting.

733
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,840
And so, whenever you open a Key Forge deck,

734
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,202
you never know what you're gonna get.

735
00:34:40,176 --> 00:34:42,436
We've also introduced a bunch of new mechanics

736
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:45,377
that you can check out the Fantasy Flight Games website

737
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:47,917
to see what we've been premiering so far.

738
00:34:48,578 --> 00:34:50,758
It should release in the second quarter of this year

739
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,558
and we're incredibly excited.

740
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:55,599
But that's it for me today.

741
00:34:56,619 --> 00:34:57,979
We have time for some questions now.

742
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,880
There is a microphone stand right in the center of the room

743
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,940
so if you have any questions you'd like to ask,

744
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,201
please line up there and we'll get to it.

745
00:35:09,472 --> 00:35:11,554
Oh, and please say your name and where you're from.

746
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:13,877
Thank you very much.

747
00:35:19,022 --> 00:35:20,003
Hello, my name is Jay.

748
00:35:20,124 --> 00:35:21,345
I'm from Southern California.

749
00:35:21,685 --> 00:35:21,986
Hey, Jay.

750
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,420
Can I call you Quicksilve?

751
00:35:24,881 --> 00:35:25,801
Yeah, sure, go for it.

752
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,043
There was a meme not too long ago

753
00:35:28,764 --> 00:35:30,565
involving Quicksilve, the card,

754
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:34,028
and someone saying they wanted a person just like Quicksilve

755
00:35:34,068 --> 00:35:36,890
and then underneath was like, I am that person.

756
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:37,550
Yeah.

757
00:35:38,091 --> 00:35:39,072
Did that actually happen?

758
00:35:39,772 --> 00:35:40,473
No, no, no.

759
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,280
So they just made that meme for good times,

760
00:35:45,081 --> 00:35:45,821
based on the art.

761
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:48,641
I premiered it earlier in one of my first slides,

762
00:35:49,082 --> 00:35:52,722
but after you've been at Fantasy Flight Games for five years

763
00:35:53,103 --> 00:35:55,503
you get to put your face into a game,

764
00:35:55,803 --> 00:35:59,464
and it just so happened that my five year lined up

765
00:35:59,684 --> 00:36:02,005
right when we were starting development on Key Forge,

766
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:05,926
so I'm the card, Quixo the adventurer, in quotes.

767
00:36:07,606 --> 00:36:08,166
Thank you very much.

768
00:36:08,406 --> 00:36:09,087
Thank you very much.

769
00:36:11,513 --> 00:36:14,974
Hi, my name is Mark from Creative Assembly in the UK.

770
00:36:15,414 --> 00:36:17,535
Having developed a game like Conquest

771
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:20,657
in a very large, predefined world,

772
00:36:21,157 --> 00:36:23,478
and creating a game like Key Forge in your own,

773
00:36:24,278 --> 00:36:25,859
what do you find more enjoyable?

774
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:29,460
Oh, they're both special in their own way.

775
00:36:30,341 --> 00:36:32,241
Working on Conquest was...

776
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,933
a big lifelong dream for me.

777
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:38,496
I'd been a really big Games Workshop fan for a long time.

778
00:36:38,556 --> 00:36:41,861
And so getting to really immerse myself in that world

779
00:36:41,901 --> 00:36:45,866
and work with them was a really interesting experience.

780
00:36:45,926 --> 00:36:48,570
But definitely one that was.

781
00:36:50,828 --> 00:36:51,449
tailored in a way.

782
00:36:51,629 --> 00:36:54,351
They definitely had things about their IP

783
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:56,073
they wanted to make sure came forth,

784
00:36:56,553 --> 00:36:59,635
regardless of any personal predilection that I had.

785
00:37:00,496 --> 00:37:03,939
But Keyforge allows me and my team

786
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:06,381
to really do what we'd like

787
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:09,043
and build a world that we're happy with.

788
00:37:09,303 --> 00:37:10,604
And it's been a ton of fun.

789
00:37:11,945 --> 00:37:14,707
Comparability, I guess I prefer working on Keyforge,

790
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:16,429
making my own stuff and...

791
00:37:18,702 --> 00:37:20,724
Making the jokes I want to make, to be honest, too,

792
00:37:22,226 --> 00:37:23,748
is a very freeing experience.

793
00:37:24,128 --> 00:37:30,315
And building something for yourself is also a real treat.

794
00:37:31,797 --> 00:37:33,119
I hope that answers your question.

795
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:33,399
Thank you.

796
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,171
I'm Kurt, I'm from Richmond, Virginia.

797
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:39,612
I have two questions.

798
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:41,753
Oh, so the first question is,

799
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:44,115
the beginning of your talk was really exciting

800
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:48,037
because I did not know a lot about the world building

801
00:37:48,277 --> 00:37:50,679
until those few slides.

802
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:52,900
And I was actually thinking back to the cards

803
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,021
and there's not a lot of.

804
00:37:54,858 --> 00:38:00,199
world, like, there's not a lot of, like, flavor text in it, so was that, like, a very deliberate

805
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,440
decision from your team?

806
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,200
Because you are focusing on uniqueness, so that's the first question.

807
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:10,341
And then the second question is, how do you balance the legacy cards?

808
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:15,922
Because it's pretty elegant how you have sort of the more powerful decks come to retirement

809
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:16,603
by themselves.

810
00:38:16,883 --> 00:38:20,203
So is there, like, a really strict time frame for the legacy cards?

811
00:38:20,243 --> 00:38:23,744
Like, do you watch the meta in real time, or is it just through playtesting?

812
00:38:23,764 --> 00:38:24,304
Mm-hmm.

813
00:38:24,324 --> 00:38:24,444
Mm-hmm.

814
00:38:27,144 --> 00:38:28,724
Okay, so first question was?

815
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:31,366
The flavor.

816
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:31,926
Yes.

817
00:38:32,086 --> 00:38:33,367
There's not a lot of flavor on the cards,

818
00:38:33,427 --> 00:38:34,688
I learned everything in this talk.

819
00:38:34,728 --> 00:38:39,450
So we use flavor very deliberately in Key Forge.

820
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,311
We wanted to make sure that one,

821
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:44,233
we kept the lightness and the approachability

822
00:38:44,253 --> 00:38:47,494
of the universe, so where we could inject humor

823
00:38:48,015 --> 00:38:49,756
was often a time where we decided

824
00:38:49,816 --> 00:38:51,497
that we wanted flavor text to be here.

825
00:38:52,217 --> 00:38:53,378
There's a couple of different bits

826
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:54,638
of world building here and there.

827
00:38:54,658 --> 00:38:55,339
Oh, excuse me.

828
00:38:56,598 --> 00:38:57,218
bagel this morning.

829
00:38:58,759 --> 00:39:01,820
But we also wanted to make sure the cards felt

830
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,501
clean and approachable.

831
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:10,444
So we made sure to leave some cards just very open and,

832
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:14,265
again, readable, so that when you're picking up a deck for

833
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:17,627
the first time, fanning out your cards, you don't feel

834
00:39:17,707 --> 00:39:18,287
intimidated.

835
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,221
Second question, in terms of legacy cards,

836
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:26,383
we did a lot of testing both with decks from the first set

837
00:39:27,184 --> 00:39:28,384
and decks from the second set,

838
00:39:28,544 --> 00:39:31,406
ensuring that both would be good in the same environment.

839
00:39:32,086 --> 00:39:34,788
And so that helped with a lot of our legacy testing

840
00:39:34,868 --> 00:39:37,510
to make sure that we weren't bringing anything forward

841
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:38,470
that would be ridiculous.

842
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:42,472
We also made sure to pair most cards that we saw

843
00:39:44,534 --> 00:39:46,015
and ensure that there wasn't anything

844
00:39:46,055 --> 00:39:47,515
going to be ridiculously broken.

845
00:39:49,777 --> 00:39:52,198
just in terms of looking at the pool all together.

846
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:55,839
Yeah, I was thinking more like,

847
00:39:55,899 --> 00:39:57,179
maybe like five years down the line,

848
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,640
how many Legacy cards would survive, but.

849
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,941
Yeah, and we'll figure that out as we go, I think.

850
00:40:03,641 --> 00:40:06,101
You know, that's one of the things about Key Forge is,

851
00:40:06,982 --> 00:40:08,982
it is a big experiment, it's very different,

852
00:40:09,122 --> 00:40:12,323
it's very strange, and so we're figuring out

853
00:40:12,703 --> 00:40:14,163
a lot of stuff as we go as well.

854
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:17,219
Hi, my name's Miles.

855
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:18,440
I'm from here in San Francisco.

856
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:22,864
I'm interested in the digital printing aspect of the game.

857
00:40:23,644 --> 00:40:26,006
So firstly, from a production standpoint, how you're able to

858
00:40:26,046 --> 00:40:29,690
keep the cost down to $10 a deck when obviously digital

859
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,512
printing is a lot more expensive than mass production

860
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:32,752
printing.

861
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:36,295
And then secondly, as a designer, is Fantasy Flight

862
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:38,097
looking at other games using this sort of thing?

863
00:40:38,117 --> 00:40:40,719
Because obviously it opens up a world of possibilities.

864
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:47,334
So in terms of digital printing, we did a lot of investigating

865
00:40:47,354 --> 00:40:50,717
into exactly how we were going to make this deck and game.

866
00:40:52,038 --> 00:40:52,178
And.

867
00:40:52,991 --> 00:40:55,853
So that was one thing we spent a lot of time on,

868
00:40:55,873 --> 00:40:57,135
especially the production department.

869
00:40:57,415 --> 00:41:00,077
But we finally found a digital printer in Germany,

870
00:41:01,518 --> 00:41:04,221
ran by this mad German scientist, essentially,

871
00:41:04,841 --> 00:41:07,964
trying to pioneer exactly how we were gonna

872
00:41:07,984 --> 00:41:08,905
put these decks together.

873
00:41:09,025 --> 00:41:12,668
And he got this insanely interesting assembly line,

874
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:14,630
which I wish I could talk more about, figured out,

875
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:18,473
and has tons of different uniqueness checks

876
00:41:18,633 --> 00:41:19,354
all the way through.

877
00:41:20,134 --> 00:41:23,755
and essentially each and every deck is assigned a code

878
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:26,076
at the beginning and that code is rechecked

879
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:27,816
every single step of the process.

880
00:41:28,997 --> 00:41:30,417
I can't go too, too much into it,

881
00:41:30,957 --> 00:41:33,958
just because again, that's part of our trade secret,

882
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:36,639
but that's not much I can tell.

883
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:40,080
In term, what was your second question again?

884
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,880
Just whether Fantasy Flight is interested in going

885
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,401
Yes, yes, yes, sorry.

886
00:41:45,161 --> 00:41:46,161
Short term memory and whatnot.

887
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:51,389
Definitely, we're very interested in the space it creates

888
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:52,971
and you know, as the talk is,

889
00:41:53,071 --> 00:41:55,673
it's the world's first unique deck building game.

890
00:41:56,794 --> 00:41:59,317
I would imagine we'd wanna explore the space in the future,

891
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:01,359
especially since we put all the groundwork in,

892
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:02,980
but I can't say anything

893
00:42:03,661 --> 00:42:05,082
about any future plans at the moment.

894
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:06,043
Okay, thank you.

895
00:42:08,706 --> 00:42:12,409
Hi, I'm Quinn from Atherton, California, just south of here.

896
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:23,146
And my question is, so the kind of the selling point of this is the deck uniqueness, but I suspect that a lot of players will at some point kind of want to maybe start.

897
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:25,552
designing their own decks, putting them together

898
00:42:25,612 --> 00:42:26,653
like a traditional card game.

899
00:42:27,453 --> 00:42:31,015
And it seems like that's something that is not that hard

900
00:42:31,055 --> 00:42:34,458
to support given people could take cards from various decks

901
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:35,238
and sleeve them.

902
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:39,561
But the concern with that is that maybe that might undermine

903
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:42,422
your business model a little bit with people wanting to have

904
00:42:42,442 --> 00:42:44,484
to buy several decks to kind of find one they like.

905
00:42:44,624 --> 00:42:47,746
And I'm wondering how if that sort of started to happen,

906
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:50,407
or a community started to grow up around that, how you would

907
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,308
support that or not support that and what

908
00:42:52,328 --> 00:42:53,209
your thinking on that is.

909
00:42:54,842 --> 00:43:00,805
My take on players building their own decks is that we've given them the tools, and if

910
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:04,447
that really is something they want to do, then I'd say go for it.

911
00:43:05,027 --> 00:43:10,930
If they want to create the rules for it, and they want to do that, that's their own thing.

912
00:43:11,771 --> 00:43:17,714
I feel like the way we present Key Forge is the most exciting and compelling way that

913
00:43:17,754 --> 00:43:18,835
the game can be played.

914
00:43:20,752 --> 00:43:24,996
I would encourage players to do that, but far be it from me to tell players exactly

915
00:43:25,016 --> 00:43:25,877
how to play their games.

916
00:43:27,278 --> 00:43:32,743
In terms of official support, again, we believe that the format that Keyforge is in is the

917
00:43:32,783 --> 00:43:36,146
strongest format, and that is the one we're determined to support.

918
00:43:37,888 --> 00:43:39,550
But again, who knows?

919
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:40,571
Everything's possible.

920
00:43:42,103 --> 00:43:46,347
I suspect that it would be because you didn't really test for that, that the constructed

921
00:43:46,367 --> 00:43:50,030
format would be kind of degenerate, which is probably why it wouldn't work out as well.

922
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:50,711
Likely.

923
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:56,376
There's a lot of back-end rules that players can't see that regulate how decks are put

924
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:57,777
together and whatnot.

925
00:43:58,498 --> 00:44:04,664
And obviously players can make their own deck building restrictions or changes, but it's

926
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:07,486
not something we're interested in pursuing ourselves.

927
00:44:08,293 --> 00:44:10,494
But again, if the player community wants to go for it,

928
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:11,555
go for it.

929
00:44:11,575 --> 00:44:12,696
All right, thank you.

930
00:44:15,437 --> 00:44:16,278
Hi, my name is Lionel.

931
00:44:16,498 --> 00:44:17,259
I'm from New York City.

932
00:44:18,339 --> 00:44:19,740
I wanted to know, I have a couple questions actually,

933
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,842
but first of all I wanted to know what are your thoughts

934
00:44:23,283 --> 00:44:25,524
on procedurally generating the cards themselves

935
00:44:25,784 --> 00:44:27,805
during development and what it looks like

936
00:44:27,826 --> 00:44:28,426
for the future for that?

937
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:31,521
as far as procedural generation of actual cards.

938
00:44:32,682 --> 00:44:35,362
It's definitely something that's been really intriguing

939
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:38,503
and we talked a lot during the development of the game.

940
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,644
And it's something Richard's definitely interested

941
00:44:40,684 --> 00:44:43,584
in pursuing, but the exact implementation of it

942
00:44:44,345 --> 00:44:47,305
is pretty difficult and not something we've figured out yet.

943
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,866
But it is something we're definitely looking at

944
00:44:50,466 --> 00:44:53,367
and hopefully we'll see what happens in the future.

945
00:44:54,047 --> 00:44:55,027
Wish I could say more, but.

946
00:44:56,214 --> 00:45:03,399
And my second question was, how did you handle the, perhaps, disparity between a player's

947
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:05,801
play style and the play style of their deck?

948
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:07,522
Definitely.

949
00:45:07,582 --> 00:45:08,203
Great question.

950
00:45:09,724 --> 00:45:12,426
So, a player's play style versus the play style of the deck.

951
00:45:12,826 --> 00:45:19,791
And yeah, it can be really, really intriguing how you can pick up a deck and it plays either

952
00:45:19,911 --> 00:45:23,194
exactly like you'd want it to or completely differently.

953
00:45:23,494 --> 00:45:23,654
You...

954
00:45:26,168 --> 00:45:30,410
I find that the best combinations are when you can find a deck that fits your own playstyle.

955
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:34,931
But one of the things we wanted to make sure through development is that there were tons

956
00:45:34,971 --> 00:45:38,673
of different playstyles available through those randomized processes.

957
00:45:39,393 --> 00:45:40,634
And I think we've achieved that.

958
00:45:40,814 --> 00:45:44,675
There's lots of different types of decks out there, lots of decks doing well at tournaments,

959
00:45:45,716 --> 00:45:48,317
even decks that go counter to what the meta...

960
00:45:48,937 --> 00:45:49,818
it says is best.

961
00:45:49,978 --> 00:45:51,558
For example, with the vault tours

962
00:45:51,578 --> 00:45:52,619
that just happened this weekend,

963
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:55,860
Shadows has been very much thought of as the best house,

964
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,700
but the deck that won in Seattle

965
00:45:57,741 --> 00:45:59,241
didn't have Shadows in it at all.

966
00:46:00,141 --> 00:46:01,922
And so players are scratching their heads

967
00:46:01,982 --> 00:46:03,923
and trying to figure out that aspect of the game.

968
00:46:04,943 --> 00:46:09,185
And so, yes, you can find decks

969
00:46:09,205 --> 00:46:10,945
that aren't going to be exactly your play style,

970
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:13,206
but I think you're most effective

971
00:46:13,246 --> 00:46:14,627
continuing to look for one that is.

972
00:46:15,687 --> 00:46:16,748
Thank you. You're welcome.

973
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:19,612
Hey, Brad.

974
00:46:20,112 --> 00:46:20,653
Hey, handsome.

975
00:46:20,933 --> 00:46:21,213
Hey.

976
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:22,755
How's it going, Brad?

977
00:46:22,795 --> 00:46:23,516
This is Jonathan.

978
00:46:23,896 --> 00:46:24,677
We used to work together.

979
00:46:25,018 --> 00:46:25,378
It's true.

980
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:29,763
But, so, my question is actually about the design of the starter sets.

981
00:46:29,943 --> 00:46:34,969
In the original Call of the Archons for the new player experience, you included two non-randomized

982
00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:37,892
decks that were intended to be teaching decks.

983
00:46:39,493 --> 00:46:43,116
I understand that in the newest set, that is no longer the case, that it is just two

984
00:46:44,116 --> 00:46:45,477
completely unique decks, is that true?

985
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:46,338
Yes, it's true.

986
00:46:46,698 --> 00:46:50,760
Yeah, so what motivated that decision to change the format of those starter decks and include

987
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:56,164
more tokens instead of those two theoretically generic teaching decks?

988
00:46:56,464 --> 00:46:56,744
Yes.

989
00:46:57,304 --> 00:47:04,609
So, as John put, in the first set we included, in the core set, two non-randomized decks,

990
00:47:04,709 --> 00:47:07,611
the only two randomized decks, which aren't legal in tournament play.

991
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:12,653
that have, are hand-picked and hand-designed

992
00:47:12,874 --> 00:47:16,155
to be easier for players to use and play with.

993
00:47:16,496 --> 00:47:19,557
This includes additional reminder text on the cards

994
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:22,359
to explain mechanics, and these are designed

995
00:47:22,379 --> 00:47:23,680
to be played along with the quick start.

996
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,481
Now, our feeling for the game was always that,

997
00:47:26,922 --> 00:47:28,563
very much like many other TCGs,

998
00:47:28,663 --> 00:47:31,624
players would not be typically learning

999
00:47:31,664 --> 00:47:32,405
through the rule book.

1000
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,026
They'd use it as more of a reference,

1001
00:47:34,046 --> 00:47:35,386
which is why we, again, have a

1002
00:47:36,135 --> 00:47:37,356
rulebook and a quick start.

1003
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:39,197
The rulebook has all of our FAQ,

1004
00:47:39,617 --> 00:47:41,118
all of our clarifications there.

1005
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:43,019
So when the game was first coming out,

1006
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,381
players were going to need that to get a base install

1007
00:47:46,441 --> 00:47:48,102
of players that knew how to play the game.

1008
00:47:49,023 --> 00:47:53,406
Then, moving forward, our biggest portion of players

1009
00:47:53,706 --> 00:47:56,047
were not going to be wanting those starter decks.

1010
00:47:56,087 --> 00:47:57,128
They already knew how to play.

1011
00:47:57,268 --> 00:47:59,149
They were looking for those new cards

1012
00:47:59,289 --> 00:48:00,530
and those new experiences.

1013
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,452
So we focused on more tokens and

1014
00:48:04,275 --> 00:48:06,517
more things that a player that's already invested

1015
00:48:06,537 --> 00:48:07,978
in Key Forge would be interested in,

1016
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,421
and could use to teach new players.

1017
00:48:13,202 --> 00:48:14,743
So that became our motivation.

1018
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:18,146
Additionally, in the future, by not setting a trend

1019
00:48:18,386 --> 00:48:20,888
of doing those starter decks, we free ourselves up

1020
00:48:21,048 --> 00:48:24,391
for different exciting things to be in those starter sets,

1021
00:48:24,912 --> 00:48:27,994
giving us more just wiggle room with our budget.

1022
00:48:29,255 --> 00:48:29,415
Cool.

1023
00:48:32,177 --> 00:48:32,658
Oh, there we go.

1024
00:48:33,432 --> 00:48:39,416
Hi, my name's Thomas. I'm from Cincinnati. A question on your testing methodology. So,

1025
00:48:39,797 --> 00:48:45,320
I have a deck that's the library access, draw your deck, four, three keys in one turn, and

1026
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,483
our store opened a double horseman deck. Were those sort of combinations...

1027
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:53,975
specifically built during your testing phase,

1028
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,656
and how do you feel about them right now?

1029
00:48:56,696 --> 00:48:58,137
Are they just an acceptable consequence

1030
00:48:58,437 --> 00:49:00,017
of the variability of what decks can be?

1031
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:02,798
And with the specifically draw your deck,

1032
00:49:03,378 --> 00:49:04,919
loop type of decks,

1033
00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:07,640
is that informing any future design

1034
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,960
on trying to limit that or lean into that design space?

1035
00:49:10,811 --> 00:49:14,112
You know, it's a really interesting, intriguing part of the design space.

1036
00:49:14,892 --> 00:49:17,092
You know, we never even talked about the double horseman decks

1037
00:49:18,132 --> 00:49:19,832
when we were working on the game.

1038
00:49:19,912 --> 00:49:21,533
And so it was kind of a pleasant surprise.

1039
00:49:22,153 --> 00:49:24,473
And, you know, I printed one out and tested it.

1040
00:49:24,673 --> 00:49:26,894
And it was fun and powerful,

1041
00:49:27,014 --> 00:49:29,394
but definitely not the most powerful deck I had experienced.

1042
00:49:29,854 --> 00:49:34,655
I also happened to open up one of the library access combo decks

1043
00:49:34,815 --> 00:49:36,395
on our stream a while back.

1044
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:39,296
And, you know, I lost that game.

1045
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:40,036
And...

1046
00:49:41,165 --> 00:49:44,646
It was really cool to me to have this combo deck

1047
00:49:44,686 --> 00:49:45,946
be present in the environment,

1048
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:48,666
because combo decks are always something I used to play

1049
00:49:48,706 --> 00:49:50,247
when I used to play a lot of TCGs.

1050
00:49:50,967 --> 00:49:52,587
That was a fun archetype.

1051
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:55,568
However, we wanted to make sure that

1052
00:49:56,688 --> 00:50:01,049
that archetype didn't dominate and has weaknesses.

1053
00:50:01,129 --> 00:50:01,850
And that's the key.

1054
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:05,230
Combo decks are good for an environment

1055
00:50:05,811 --> 00:50:07,291
only when there's counterplay.

1056
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:09,786
When there's counterplay that exists,

1057
00:50:10,106 --> 00:50:11,766
then those combo decks don't run rampant.

1058
00:50:11,786 --> 00:50:13,767
There aren't the be all, end all.

1059
00:50:14,207 --> 00:50:17,168
And again, our results from this weekend's Vault Tour

1060
00:50:17,228 --> 00:50:18,968
is very promising that those combo decks

1061
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:20,609
didn't do that well.

1062
00:50:21,489 --> 00:50:22,149
They did okay.

1063
00:50:22,529 --> 00:50:23,029
They were fun.

1064
00:50:23,149 --> 00:50:26,450
I saw one that went four and two, I believe in Eindhoven.

1065
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:30,411
But they weren't bringing home the bacon every time

1066
00:50:30,491 --> 00:50:33,552
because consistency is important.

1067
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:37,492
and those combos can be slow, they can be raced out.

1068
00:50:38,352 --> 00:50:41,214
And so, that's I think an important part.

1069
00:50:41,434 --> 00:50:44,456
And so, am I interested in having experiences

1070
00:50:44,516 --> 00:50:46,437
in decks like that, that feel like they have

1071
00:50:46,457 --> 00:50:47,437
that kind of synergy?

1072
00:50:47,817 --> 00:50:50,759
Yes, I am interested, but ones that

1073
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,261
make other decks obsolete, no.

1074
00:50:55,701 --> 00:50:58,043
I think that is not something we're interested in.

1075
00:50:58,783 --> 00:51:01,484
And as we continue designing and developing the game,

1076
00:51:01,504 --> 00:51:03,325
that's something we want to keep a close eye on.

1077
00:51:04,569 --> 00:51:04,890
Thank you.

1078
00:51:07,853 --> 00:51:09,955
Hi, I'm Hans from Stockholm, Sweden.

1079
00:51:10,775 --> 00:51:11,176
Hi Hans.

1080
00:51:12,217 --> 00:51:13,458
I wanna ask a couple of questions

1081
00:51:13,518 --> 00:51:15,280
about the algorithm there.

1082
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,463
I realize it's the sort of secret sauce to everything,

1083
00:51:19,023 --> 00:51:20,305
but I'm sure we all wanna go home

1084
00:51:20,325 --> 00:51:22,407
and kinda try to make our own, right?

1085
00:51:23,227 --> 00:51:24,709
How complex is it?

1086
00:51:24,769 --> 00:51:26,711
How many weird little rules are there in there?

1087
00:51:27,213 --> 00:51:30,894
So the algorithm is a little bit of two-stage.

1088
00:51:31,695 --> 00:51:35,296
There is a long series of rules that dictate

1089
00:51:35,616 --> 00:51:37,576
the exact deck construction.

1090
00:51:38,676 --> 00:51:41,137
And then there is a longer list of rules

1091
00:51:41,417 --> 00:51:42,918
that apply to individual cards.

1092
00:51:44,198 --> 00:51:47,759
And so we have kind of a two-stage process there

1093
00:51:48,419 --> 00:51:50,740
in that a deck is generated, and then it's

1094
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,240
checked against those individual card rules.

1095
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,601
And if it violates those, it's kicked out.

1096
00:51:57,022 --> 00:52:01,225
So in terms of how complicated, man, pretty complicated.

1097
00:52:02,587 --> 00:52:04,148
It's definitely a sight to behold.

1098
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:05,429
And so when I start to...

1099
00:52:07,637 --> 00:52:10,078
dive into that algorithm when I start to work on a new deck,

1100
00:52:10,298 --> 00:52:11,319
or excuse me, a new set,

1101
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:13,620
because we make sure to look at that

1102
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:15,501
every time we make a new set,

1103
00:52:15,922 --> 00:52:18,783
and sometimes we'll need to add a new rule to,

1104
00:52:19,664 --> 00:52:21,545
even on the base list of rules,

1105
00:52:21,945 --> 00:52:23,506
we've had to add rules to be like,

1106
00:52:23,626 --> 00:52:26,848
okay, I made this rule to accommodate this single card,

1107
00:52:27,829 --> 00:52:30,370
but it's important that it functions exactly this way.

1108
00:52:31,579 --> 00:52:34,722
So, man, I wish I could answer more about how complicated it is.

1109
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:36,143
Seven.

1110
00:52:36,603 --> 00:52:37,444
Seven complicated.

1111
00:52:37,524 --> 00:52:39,105
Right.

1112
00:52:39,305 --> 00:52:42,788
And just a quick follow-up though, like, if you find a combo or a mechanic that is super

1113
00:52:42,808 --> 00:52:46,170
overpowered, do you balance that only through frequency in the algorithm?

1114
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:49,413
We can tackle it in many different ways.

1115
00:52:49,493 --> 00:52:53,616
If we find it in playtesting, we can always alter the card and change it.

1116
00:52:54,361 --> 00:52:58,103
Algorithm-wise, yeah, if we need to, we can dictate,

1117
00:52:58,223 --> 00:53:01,024
okay, only one of this card can be in a deck,

1118
00:53:01,585 --> 00:53:04,066
and it would be a combo if there was ever two.

1119
00:53:05,327 --> 00:53:08,988
And from that, we can mitigate that type of thing.

1120
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:12,130
So we can take a ton of different strategies

1121
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,911
that are novel to a game like Key Forge

1122
00:53:15,271 --> 00:53:16,912
that you couldn't normally take, you can't,

1123
00:53:17,353 --> 00:53:17,753
or would be.

1124
00:53:18,299 --> 00:53:20,820
intrusive to take because in a TCG,

1125
00:53:21,421 --> 00:53:23,042
a lot of players will dislike when you're like,

1126
00:53:23,142 --> 00:53:24,643
okay, you can only run one of this card.

1127
00:53:25,404 --> 00:53:28,606
But if there's never more than one of that card anyways,

1128
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:31,128
then players will perceive it very differently.

1129
00:53:32,308 --> 00:53:34,310
And as a good friend once told me,

1130
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:35,671
perception is often reality.

1131
00:53:35,691 --> 00:53:37,912
All right, thank you.

1132
00:53:38,073 --> 00:53:38,433
Love the game.

1133
00:53:38,693 --> 00:53:39,213
Thank you very much.

1134
00:53:41,948 --> 00:53:44,870
Hi, my name is David. I come from Montréal, Québec.

1135
00:53:45,811 --> 00:53:50,175
I come from a technical background. Actually, I'm a game developer who specializes in procedural gaming.

1136
00:53:50,915 --> 00:53:56,060
And I was wondering, because you talk about the gazillion decks you can produce with the algorithm,

1137
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:00,103
what were the challenges to actually start making the first rules?

1138
00:54:00,263 --> 00:54:04,266
I mean, we all have that white paper syndrome when we want to try something,

1139
00:54:04,747 --> 00:54:08,610
but what was your first step on that, and how did you actually manage to go through it?

1140
00:54:09,368 --> 00:54:12,589
So some of the earliest steps we took was

1141
00:54:13,729 --> 00:54:15,850
determining how many houses we wanted in the game

1142
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:18,211
and then how many houses we wanted in a deck.

1143
00:54:18,231 --> 00:54:20,231
And I don't remember the exact combination.

1144
00:54:20,251 --> 00:54:23,672
I had a long discussion with Richard

1145
00:54:23,712 --> 00:54:24,652
about this at one point.

1146
00:54:25,152 --> 00:54:28,593
But with seven houses and three in each,

1147
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:30,753
I'm trying to remember the probability

1148
00:54:31,194 --> 00:54:32,814
that when you sit down to play with someone

1149
00:54:33,094 --> 00:54:35,535
that you're sharing one house is,

1150
00:54:35,555 --> 00:54:36,875
I think in like 60 to 70% range.

1151
00:54:39,129 --> 00:54:44,915
And because of that, it means that you'll have this very interesting overlap between

1152
00:54:44,995 --> 00:54:47,177
those houses and how they interact with one another.

1153
00:54:47,697 --> 00:54:52,322
If you have, say, shadows overlapping, you'll have this really interesting game where you

1154
00:54:52,342 --> 00:54:56,406
guys are stealing amber back and forth, trying to figure out who can come out on top and

1155
00:54:56,446 --> 00:54:57,287
forge those keys.

1156
00:54:58,368 --> 00:55:02,012
And those different overlaps will create really...

1157
00:55:03,045 --> 00:55:05,746
compelling experiences.

1158
00:55:06,406 --> 00:55:08,987
And so that's some of the earliest stuff we knew about.

1159
00:55:09,027 --> 00:55:10,708
When Richard originally brought the game to us,

1160
00:55:11,528 --> 00:55:13,789
it had seven houses and three houses of each,

1161
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:18,191
and even the idea of having 36 cards, 12 of each,

1162
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:21,772
would give enough variety that you'd see,

1163
00:55:21,953 --> 00:55:24,434
and there'd be enough just base material

1164
00:55:24,494 --> 00:55:25,794
filling out that deck that you'd get

1165
00:55:25,834 --> 00:55:27,115
that variety that you wanted.

1166
00:55:27,535 --> 00:55:29,336
So a lot of it was from a mathematical,

1167
00:55:30,516 --> 00:55:33,599
what makes sense to create good experiences.

1168
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,821
And that's where we kind of put our first marks

1169
00:55:36,881 --> 00:55:38,142
on that white page, if you will.

1170
00:55:39,243 --> 00:55:40,164
OK, excellent.

1171
00:55:40,685 --> 00:55:43,887
And just to finish up, thank you for bringing back

1172
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:45,048
Legion of the Fibering.

1173
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:47,370
It's a game I really liked, and you did an awesome game

1174
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:47,931
with that.

1175
00:55:48,131 --> 00:55:48,731
Thank you very much.

1176
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,760
for sure, here we go, all right.

1177
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,000
Hi, I'm Kira, I'm from Nashville, Tennessee.

1178
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,961
I've got kind of general questions

1179
00:55:57,041 --> 00:55:59,221
about just the card development process,

1180
00:55:59,501 --> 00:56:01,001
the pipeline of that, so to speak,

1181
00:56:01,181 --> 00:56:02,982
from just the general idea of how,

1182
00:56:03,382 --> 00:56:06,142
what is the cycle for the development of a single card,

1183
00:56:06,242 --> 00:56:08,463
as well as in the development cycle of then a set?

1184
00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:10,383
Is it when you guys are doing testing,

1185
00:56:10,423 --> 00:56:12,904
are you testing individual cards that you're introducing

1186
00:56:12,944 --> 00:56:14,484
with a new type of mechanic,

1187
00:56:14,864 --> 00:56:17,625
or is it that you create the set as a whole

1188
00:56:17,725 --> 00:56:19,345
and then do another round of testing

1189
00:56:19,405 --> 00:56:21,505
to see how the set actually functions together?

1190
00:56:22,017 --> 00:56:25,619
So with Key Forge, it's very much a design the whole set

1191
00:56:25,759 --> 00:56:27,220
and design the whole environment,

1192
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,082
because unlike most other TCGs,

1193
00:56:30,562 --> 00:56:32,803
Key Forge is about crafting in those environments.

1194
00:56:33,144 --> 00:56:35,445
It's about crafting each house in a set

1195
00:56:35,865 --> 00:56:37,807
to feel the way we want it to,

1196
00:56:38,207 --> 00:56:40,628
and then generating a ton of decks to make sure

1197
00:56:40,648 --> 00:56:44,131
that that house is consistently feeling that way.

1198
00:56:44,311 --> 00:56:47,753
So when we created Call of the Archons,

1199
00:56:48,493 --> 00:56:50,275
Logos plays a particular way.

1200
00:56:51,095 --> 00:56:51,295
But.

1201
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,682
In Age of Ascension, Logos might have a different take on it.

1202
00:56:55,222 --> 00:56:56,402
It might play a different way.

1203
00:56:56,502 --> 00:56:59,764
It might have a twist on what you've come to know and love.

1204
00:56:59,824 --> 00:57:02,586
And so crafting that environment first for this game

1205
00:57:02,966 --> 00:57:03,626
is integral.

1206
00:57:05,787 --> 00:57:08,749
In terms of individual testing, we do do some of that,

1207
00:57:09,789 --> 00:57:11,751
especially with the amount of rares that we have.

1208
00:57:11,771 --> 00:57:13,431
Because as many players have noticed,

1209
00:57:13,792 --> 00:57:15,933
there are more rares than any other type of card.

1210
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:20,663
which is bizarre and different for a game anyways,

1211
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:23,866
but we often will ask players to take decks

1212
00:57:23,886 --> 00:57:26,068
that we've generated and play some games

1213
00:57:26,388 --> 00:57:28,510
and then swap out some of the rares in their deck

1214
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:30,592
with some of the other rares in that house

1215
00:57:31,172 --> 00:57:33,494
to try and give additional testing to those cards.

1216
00:57:34,055 --> 00:57:35,576
One, because of their complexity level,

1217
00:57:36,016 --> 00:57:39,379
and two, I mean, just because they're cool and they're fun.

1218
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,702
All righty, thank you so much, appreciate it.

1219
00:57:42,802 --> 00:57:43,063
Thank you.

1220
00:57:46,528 --> 00:57:48,170
Hey, I'm Daniel from New York.

1221
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,192
This isn't so much as a question,

1222
00:57:50,232 --> 00:57:51,913
it's just for everybody in the audience

1223
00:57:51,973 --> 00:57:53,355
who maybe hasn't played it before.

1224
00:57:53,395 --> 00:57:56,158
I'm a volunteer at the Shut Up and Sit Down game lounge

1225
00:57:56,278 --> 00:57:57,859
and we have Key Forge over there

1226
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,962
and volunteers would love to play it with you.

1227
00:58:00,622 --> 00:58:02,344
So just for everybody in the audience

1228
00:58:02,504 --> 00:58:03,425
who wants to check it out.

1229
00:58:03,665 --> 00:58:04,325
Thank you very much.

1230
00:58:05,506 --> 00:58:08,366
We have time for, I think, one more question, which is good,

1231
00:58:08,386 --> 00:58:09,827
because it looks like there's one more person in line.

1232
00:58:10,707 --> 00:58:12,607
I'm also Daniel, but from San Francisco.

1233
00:58:14,388 --> 00:58:16,308
How did you guys handle prize support

1234
00:58:16,428 --> 00:58:18,048
for tournaments and stuff?

1235
00:58:18,868 --> 00:58:21,549
Most card games would give foils and alternate art cards,

1236
00:58:21,569 --> 00:58:23,289
but it seems like it would be difficult for a game

1237
00:58:23,309 --> 00:58:23,669
like this.

1238
00:58:23,989 --> 00:58:24,270
Yeah.

1239
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:27,010
So let me pop back a couple slides.

1240
00:58:28,877 --> 00:58:32,239
to our Master Vault app and website

1241
00:58:32,359 --> 00:58:35,341
because you can take your decks that you own

1242
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,903
and register them on the Master Vault app

1243
00:58:38,584 --> 00:58:40,305
to your personal profile.

1244
00:58:40,645 --> 00:58:42,406
And for every deck that you register,

1245
00:58:42,446 --> 00:58:44,408
you're going to get our digital currency

1246
00:58:44,508 --> 00:58:45,429
called an Amber Shard.

1247
00:58:46,469 --> 00:58:48,531
Now, when you're participating in a tournament,

1248
00:58:48,891 --> 00:58:50,973
you're going to get additional Amber Shards

1249
00:58:51,013 --> 00:58:52,674
for each round that you play and win in.

1250
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:58,302
Now, our amber shards can be spent at our prize walls

1251
00:58:59,062 --> 00:59:01,763
at all of our Vault Tour events to get various things

1252
00:59:01,823 --> 00:59:05,904
like hoodies, pins, play mats, all sorts of different

1253
00:59:05,944 --> 00:59:07,005
Key Forge merchandise.

1254
00:59:07,345 --> 00:59:11,186
There's even a, the top level is a customized

1255
00:59:11,266 --> 00:59:14,267
Key Forge gaming table that players can purchase

1256
00:59:14,427 --> 00:59:16,048
if they have enough amber shards.

1257
00:59:16,868 --> 00:59:20,769
So that is how we distribute prizes for Key Forge.

1258
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:25,692
prize wall that you can go to and enjoy.

1259
00:59:25,732 --> 00:59:28,294
It encourages players to come to our vault tours

1260
00:59:29,094 --> 00:59:32,357
and have a good time and pick up some great prizes.

1261
00:59:32,817 --> 00:59:35,559
It also means that a player that's at their store every week

1262
00:59:36,099 --> 00:59:39,021
playing games can be just as rewarded as a player

1263
00:59:39,381 --> 00:59:41,523
that goes out and can win any tournament.

1264
00:59:42,344 --> 00:59:43,044
Okay, thank you.

1265
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:46,867
Thank you guys all very, very much for having me today.

1266
00:59:46,967 --> 00:59:47,687
It's been a pleasure.

1267
00:59:47,707 --> 00:59:49,008
Enjoy the rest of your GDC.
