1
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:11,322
Okay. Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:14,924
So yes, I'm Kristy Diener, and I'll be talking to you

3
00:00:14,924 --> 00:00:18,226
about the secrets to creating an indie game franchise.

4
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:22,989
But why are these secrets, first of all?

5
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,771
You know, why aren't the techniques

6
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:28,892
to develop a franchise actually common knowledge?

7
00:00:28,892 --> 00:00:29,813
And I mean that.

8
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:33,255
Why aren't we all learning how to do this as part of our craft?

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,303
You may be thinking, well, Christy, franchises are about revenue streams,

10
00:00:39,303 --> 00:00:43,046
but that's the business etymology, the historical origins of the term,

11
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:46,368
which kicked in about the 16th century onwards.

12
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:50,291
But for us here at the Narrative Summit, as writers, as designers,

13
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:54,134
as narrative designers, as directors, we have the problem

14
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:58,557
of crafting multiple art forms into a whole experience.

15
00:00:59,117 --> 00:01:04,640
Games, films, books, soundtracks, whatever.

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,101
Why isn't this common knowledge?

17
00:01:06,101 --> 00:01:13,264
Well, it's because there's a lot of resistance to making multiple art forms.

18
00:01:13,264 --> 00:01:17,466
I know I've been battling these resistances for over 20 years.

19
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:23,061
You've heard of the 10,000 hour rule?

20
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:26,163
Well, that's the idea that people,

21
00:01:26,163 --> 00:01:28,205
the idea that stuck with people is this.

22
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:30,567
If you hope to be any good at anything,

23
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:33,950
then you have to be doing one thing over and over again

24
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,111
for a very long time.

25
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:38,074
And what's associated with that is the idea

26
00:01:38,074 --> 00:01:40,956
that you will be a jack of all trades

27
00:01:40,956 --> 00:01:44,179
and a master of none if you actually work in more than one.

28
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:50,387
So we all believe that working in multiple art forms either dilutes or corrupts your

29
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:52,828
creative development rather than enhancing it.

30
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:54,949
That is a factor that stops us.

31
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:58,211
It's also the not us resistance.

32
00:01:58,211 --> 00:02:05,315
It's the belief that each art form is so substantially different that it's not what we actually do.

33
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:07,917
Writers don't talk about media.

34
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:10,398
Game devs don't talk about linear media.

35
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:11,979
If it's not interactive, it's not us.

36
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:14,816
It's also the not now.

37
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:18,957
It's the fear that maybe your interest in more than one art form

38
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:23,738
is perhaps some elaborate procrastination exercise,

39
00:02:23,738 --> 00:02:24,518
that you shouldn't do it now.

40
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:26,819
You should actually focus on one art form.

41
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,899
And it's also the not you resistance.

42
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:34,740
It's the idea that you couldn't possibly be a polycreative,

43
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,301
a polymath of creativity,

44
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:41,022
someone who could create great things in more than one art form.

45
00:02:42,186 --> 00:02:45,850
It's also the idea that a franchise is not art.

46
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,575
But I've created, consulted, and mentored, and judged

47
00:02:49,575 --> 00:02:51,818
hundreds and hundreds of transmedia projects

48
00:02:51,818 --> 00:02:52,599
around the world.

49
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:56,524
And I'm here to tell you that a franchise is something

50
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:59,107
you can learn to craft, and I'll show you how.

51
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:04,722
So this is where you probably start.

52
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:07,646
You look at AAA franchises and think

53
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,690
that you need to create webisodes on YouTube,

54
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,274
bring out novelizations and graphic novels, a feature film,

55
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:16,817
some merchandise, and a soundtrack,

56
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:18,520
and maybe do an alternate reality game.

57
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:22,225
But you can't do those on an indie budget.

58
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:25,168
You can do scaled down versions like a PDF and a webisode

59
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:26,129
perhaps.

60
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:30,415
But even then, how do you decide which one to actually pursue?

61
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:34,219
Just knowing what art forms are available to you is not enough.

62
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,304
The common wisdom is choose the art forms that have the most market penetration.

63
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,745
In other words, that most people are actually using.

64
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:49,630
But the thing that's great about Indies is you can decide what's best for the project

65
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,691
rather than those constraints.

66
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:50,951
So step one.

67
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:58,717
Step one is to actually start with the premise that your franchise is shit.

68
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:05,905
Here's a book by Steven Pressfield who wrote The Legend of Bag of Ants when he was 51.

69
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:08,947
The book is called Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit.

70
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:13,768
And he learnt this when he was working in advertising when no one wants to read your

71
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:14,949
stuff.

72
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:20,011
And he explains that once you start with the idea that nobody automatically wants to read

73
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:23,212
your shit, that you develop empathy.

74
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:25,973
You ask yourself, why don't they want to read it?

75
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:27,673
Why don't they want to play my game?

76
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,393
And with this, quote here, you acquire the skill

77
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:35,875
that is indispensable to all artists and entrepreneurs.

78
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,237
That the ability to switch back and forth

79
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,619
between your imagination from your own point of view

80
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:43,821
as a writer developer to the point of view of your player.

81
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:46,363
You're thinking about what the player is thinking

82
00:04:46,363 --> 00:04:48,124
and experiencing at each point.

83
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:51,567
And this approach is behind successful projects

84
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:52,928
in all art forms.

85
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:56,290
So let's have a look at how you can action this

86
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,911
and how this relates to franchises.

87
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,704
Here we have, in Hollywood, there is a technique called the sequence approach,

88
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:08,365
which some of you will be familiar with here.

89
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:12,068
It was developed by Frank Daniel, who, after analyzing hundreds

90
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:16,291
of successful screenplays, realized it was an emerging best practice

91
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,233
that would help us all make great screenplays.

92
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:22,095
Frank was a screenwriter himself, a playwright, a novelist,

93
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:25,798
had a master's degree in music, and a doctorate in film.

94
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:29,461
And he influenced generations of filmmakers in his role

95
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:31,923
as the director of the Australian Film Institute,

96
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:35,165
sorry, the American Film Institute,

97
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:38,148
as well as he was head of film at USC,

98
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:40,770
as well as Columbia, and he was artistic director

99
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,752
of Robert Redford's Sundance Institute,

100
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:44,873
the first artistic director.

101
00:05:44,873 --> 00:05:48,256
And interestingly for us, his sequence approach focuses

102
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:50,498
on how the audience will experience the story

103
00:05:50,498 --> 00:05:53,460
and what the writer can do to make that experience better.

104
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,903
So just quickly, what is the sequence approach?

105
00:05:56,903 --> 00:06:01,007
So basically, what it does is it take the existing structure

106
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:03,008
that we all use, and you can see here

107
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:05,010
with the beginning, middle, and end,

108
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,711
and adds shorter sequences.

109
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:10,378
But the emphasis here is not on the shorter sequences,

110
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:14,843
but that these sequences are driven by an audience question.

111
00:06:14,843 --> 00:06:17,126
The crucial point to this approach

112
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,770
is to think about what drives the audience interest

113
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,911
at each point in your film.

114
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:23,814
What questions drive them?

115
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:25,115
What are they thinking about?

116
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:32,400
And so you are the one then that designs that interest with a ticking clock, with dramatic irony,

117
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,042
which is when we know more than the characters know, and importantly with dramatic tension,

118
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:42,986
when we are withholding an anticipated resolution. Now this thinking about the audience experience,

119
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:48,128
what is in their mind, and what they know right now, and what they're expecting next,

120
00:06:48,128 --> 00:06:50,270
is common to all successful works.

121
00:06:52,372 --> 00:06:55,513
So for example, Brian Upton, who is the co-founder of Red

122
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:58,754
Storm Entertainment, where he designed the original Rainbow

123
00:06:58,754 --> 00:07:01,675
6 and Ghost Recon, and was senior game designer at Sony,

124
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:05,996
he talks about situational design, where the nexus of

125
00:07:05,996 --> 00:07:07,937
play is not in the transactions.

126
00:07:07,937 --> 00:07:10,258
It's not in the actions.

127
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:11,518
It's not in the interface.

128
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:15,019
The nexus of play is in the player's mind.

129
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:17,400
And he talks about the importance of designing for

130
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,720
player anticipation.

131
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,521
Okay, so how does this actually work in a game?

132
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:25,683
Let's have a look at what remains of Edith Finch.

133
00:07:25,683 --> 00:07:29,926
So, our first question is one that seems that it would drive us right to the end of the game,

134
00:07:29,926 --> 00:07:33,888
and that is, what remains of Edith Finch?

135
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:37,330
Like, what does that actually mean?

136
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:42,160
And then, when we actually are going through the beginning of the play,

137
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,941
we find another one that comes in very early,

138
00:07:44,941 --> 00:07:47,103
and that is, how do I get to the house?

139
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:50,565
The designers have strategically placed a house in the distance,

140
00:07:50,565 --> 00:07:53,187
a weenie, as we know,

141
00:07:53,187 --> 00:07:56,769
to get us to think about where we are to go and what we are to do.

142
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,961
And then they mention that we have a key.

143
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:03,462
So the developers have us thinking,

144
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:05,042
what does this key open?

145
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:08,544
I need to find something that needs this key.

146
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:11,585
You see how these questions also work as objectives.

147
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:15,847
We have a writing approach, a design approach,

148
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:17,087
all operating together.

149
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:22,197
And then, if we've had these previous small questions

150
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:25,241
answered to our satisfaction, then it

151
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:28,445
is more likely that the players will actually

152
00:08:28,445 --> 00:08:30,988
continue through to the rest of the game.

153
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:31,168
In fact.

154
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,800
Brandon Sanderson, a best-selling science fiction and fantasy writer,

155
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,121
talks about this technique as a promise.

156
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:41,783
He doesn't see it as a question, but as an open bracket and a closed bracket.

157
00:08:41,783 --> 00:08:45,444
You promise that something will happen, and then you follow it through.

158
00:08:45,444 --> 00:08:49,326
You indicate to the reader that your story will be about something,

159
00:08:49,326 --> 00:08:50,467
and then you deliver on it.

160
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:54,869
Now, you all know this in terms of genre.

161
00:08:54,869 --> 00:09:00,352
You know that if you promise a player that it's a party game, it's a first-person shooter,

162
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:04,754
it's an open-world game, it's a horror, it's a comedy, whatever it is, you actually have

163
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:07,295
to deliver on the expectations of those genres.

164
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:14,199
It's a feedback loop where our players engage in a continuous reappraisal, and these promises

165
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:18,021
are one factor in how they decide and why we must deliver.

166
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:24,560
I really like the notion of a promise because it's about what the players are thinking about.

167
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,226
It's also what we're signaling, what we will provide, and also with the word promise, it

168
00:09:31,226 --> 00:09:34,029
implies that we have a responsibility to honour it.

169
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:41,798
Okay, so how can we use this for our shit franchise?

170
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:47,582
If we agree we all have this best practice of switching between our point of view and

171
00:09:47,582 --> 00:09:52,706
our players, of designing for leading promises and keeping them, then we have an approach

172
00:09:52,706 --> 00:09:55,988
that we can use across art forms in our franchise.

173
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,495
You see, we can think about the questions in our players' minds

174
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:02,957
before they get to the game.

175
00:10:02,957 --> 00:10:05,640
Why do our players want to play our game?

176
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,144
Then, why do they want to watch our webisode?

177
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:11,266
Why do they want to read our graphic novel?

178
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:13,068
Why do they want to listen to our soundtrack?

179
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:15,408
And we're not alone.

180
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:21,089
A study by Kultima and Stan Ross looked at game experience models and they thought, well,

181
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:27,391
if we really think about this from the perspective of the player, there need not be any separation

182
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:29,291
of the different parts of the experience.

183
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:33,933
The experience of the player starts before they've opened the game and continues after

184
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:34,973
in the other art forms.

185
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:40,417
And here, James Ernest, founder of CheapAssGames,

186
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:42,478
former writer at Wizards of the Coast,

187
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:44,679
and former game design manager at Microsoft,

188
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:49,322
he says, if I had to pick one thing that games should have,

189
00:10:49,322 --> 00:10:50,383
it is a reason to play.

190
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,324
He continues saying, I don't like to say hook

191
00:10:53,324 --> 00:10:55,566
because that implies superficiality.

192
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:57,467
It's not just a foot in the door,

193
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:59,488
it's the reason you keep coming back.

194
00:10:59,488 --> 00:11:02,289
It's what distinguishes a hit from a flop

195
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:04,951
between two games that are empirically identical.

196
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:07,112
So what are these promises?

197
00:11:08,437 --> 00:11:10,538
What are these promises for a franchise?

198
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:13,820
What are the promises that invite your players

199
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,302
to play the game and then watch the film,

200
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:18,783
listen to the music, to read the book?

201
00:11:18,783 --> 00:11:19,964
Now, you already know a few.

202
00:11:19,964 --> 00:11:21,805
Here's some, you experience them all the time.

203
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:25,408
We've got personality, nostalgia, spectacle,

204
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:26,929
and novelty, to name a few.

205
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:30,991
I'll just do a quick shout out here to Marygold Bartlett,

206
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,374
who's the artist for all of these illustrations

207
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:35,014
that we have here.

208
00:11:36,432 --> 00:11:38,013
Okay, so personalities.

209
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:42,354
You all know the promise of the personality, or stars, right?

210
00:11:42,354 --> 00:11:45,174
It's Angelina Jolie playing Lara Croft,

211
00:11:45,174 --> 00:11:48,155
or Stephen Merchant voicing Weasley,

212
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:50,375
or it's the actual characters themselves,

213
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,176
or tour directors.

214
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:54,136
It's the reason why Eli Roth was brought in

215
00:11:54,136 --> 00:11:56,337
to do the animated trailer for Dark Souls III.

216
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:59,457
It's musician and filmmaker Rob Zombie being brought in

217
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:02,098
to do an animated short for Assassin's Creed Unity.

218
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:06,339
It's the appeal of Rami for Vlambeleague Games.

219
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,603
So what is the personality promise?

220
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:14,889
The personality promise can be credibility, assurance of credibility, but it can also

221
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:21,036
be the promise of being with someone who lives a life we want to live, that we want to be.

222
00:12:21,036 --> 00:12:25,061
Nostalgia is something that you may be familiar with.

223
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:31,427
It's the 8-bit games, it's pixel games such as Sword and Sorcery and Nidhogg,

224
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:33,188
the 1930s animated game Cuphead.

225
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:38,370
What the nostalgia promise does is it delivers on positive memories.

226
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,071
It's the comfort that you feel with those memories.

227
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:44,733
The thing about nostalgia is if you don't have positive memories

228
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:46,874
with them, it won't be a promise you're after.

229
00:12:46,874 --> 00:12:50,075
If 8-bit games are not something that you remember fondly,

230
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:51,136
it won't appeal to you.

231
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:54,533
Spectacle is a promise that we know too.

232
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:57,413
Think of a Transformers trailer,

233
00:12:57,413 --> 00:12:59,373
and you get what a spectacle is about.

234
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:01,034
It can be many things, however,

235
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:03,714
that widen our eyes in some way.

236
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:06,575
It can be the visual beauty of the blue and green

237
00:13:06,575 --> 00:13:08,575
of Marine Life of Abzu,

238
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:11,836
or the black splatter on white in The Unfinished Swan,

239
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:14,936
or the photorealism of Assassin's Creed.

240
00:13:14,936 --> 00:13:16,576
What is the promise of the spectacle?

241
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:20,577
It's the promise that you will experience awe, A-W-E, awe.

242
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:30,390
So related to spectacle is novelty and how things that aren't the status quo actually

243
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,531
draw our attention.

244
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:36,475
It's Pokemon Go which for many introduced them to augmented reality gaming.

245
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:41,879
It's Johann Sebastian Joust where you're not using screens but move controllers and dancing

246
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:42,659
around each other.

247
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:47,583
It's keep talking and nobody explodes where instead of playing a game by yourself in a

248
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,465
VR headset, you're yelling out commands to a mate.

249
00:13:51,423 --> 00:13:54,683
But in those sorts of games, there's also a social promise

250
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:55,944
operating, too.

251
00:13:55,944 --> 00:13:59,404
So indeed, it may be that the more of these promises

252
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:01,705
that you actually offer and deliver on,

253
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:05,406
the higher likelihood of not just player acquisition, which

254
00:14:05,406 --> 00:14:08,126
is gaining new players, but also player retention,

255
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:09,547
keeping your players.

256
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:12,307
So what are the out-of-the-promises

257
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:15,448
that your players want and you can provide

258
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:17,468
in a multi-platform context?

259
00:14:17,468 --> 00:14:20,809
Why is it that they stay with your IP?

260
00:14:22,465 --> 00:14:26,510
So here are the key cross-art form promises.

261
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:30,295
The promises that help your players cross art forms.

262
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:33,298
They are, if you like, the genres of crossing art forms.

263
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:35,401
They are why your players go from your game

264
00:14:35,401 --> 00:14:37,323
to your soundtrack to your graphic novel.

265
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:40,206
They are the promises you signal and then need to keep.

266
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,186
So let's zip through a few.

267
00:14:44,186 --> 00:14:46,447
The first one, the revealing promise.

268
00:14:46,447 --> 00:14:47,908
It's about revealing more.

269
00:14:47,908 --> 00:14:49,989
It's more information, more characters,

270
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,030
new mechanics, new stories.

271
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,991
It's a sequel, it's a prequel.

272
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:57,192
It's anything that primarily offers a new insight.

273
00:14:57,192 --> 00:15:00,494
It's when you get to the end of Kentucky Route Zero,

274
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:01,574
a Kentucky Route Zero episode,

275
00:15:01,574 --> 00:15:03,575
and you want the story to continue.

276
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:05,456
You want to find out what happens next.

277
00:15:05,977 --> 00:15:08,119
Let's have a quick look through some examples.

278
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,762
The revealing promises in the card game,

279
00:15:10,762 --> 00:15:13,264
Consenticle, where you're engaging

280
00:15:13,264 --> 00:15:17,449
in a mutually satisfying and consensual intimate encounter

281
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,590
with an alien.

282
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,472
And you can go straight into playing the game,

283
00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:23,034
but the Kickstarter backers also have the option

284
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:24,316
of a 12-page prequel.

285
00:15:24,896 --> 00:15:31,039
where they can find out how the characters actually meet and what stands in their way.

286
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:38,082
So it's something that can be enjoyed before playing the game or after, either setting up character motivations or

287
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:39,042
giving context.

288
00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:42,516
And then there is the game, That Dragon Cancer,

289
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:46,338
that tells the true personal story of Ryan Green

290
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:49,299
and his family as they raise their son, Joel, who is

291
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:51,580
diagnosed with terminal cancer.

292
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,881
We follow the family through the hospital treatments,

293
00:15:53,881 --> 00:15:57,203
the playgrounds, the church, and then Joel's afterlife

294
00:15:57,203 --> 00:15:58,464
when he dies at age five.

295
00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:01,385
In what is perhaps the most heart-wrenching prequel

296
00:16:01,385 --> 00:16:03,766
there is, the book released almost a year

297
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:06,988
to the day before his passing is titled He's Not Dead Yet.

298
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,845
And the point of this is that these are techniques

299
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:14,650
that you can action in any way.

300
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,194
And how about the hidden object game, Hidden Folks,

301
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:19,896
where you can also keep playing more

302
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,760
games on the playable t-shirt and the playable poster?

303
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,183
The point being that the revealing promise

304
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:26,765
is not always about narrative.

305
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:32,480
The Revealing Promise is also meeting the interest

306
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,145
of revealing more about the actual creation of the game,

307
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:40,110
the games or the games in the case of 120 Years of Lambir.

308
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,813
Their collection includes art, but also their game

309
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:45,477
and audio design and studio beginnings.

310
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,472
So, you may notice I've also got the reliving card,

311
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:52,233
reliving promise there as well,

312
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:56,154
because in some ways players are reliving moments from the games.

313
00:16:56,154 --> 00:16:59,274
But if we look at fan interest in art books,

314
00:16:59,274 --> 00:17:03,135
we see a definite leaning towards the revealing promise more

315
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:04,056
than the reliving one.

316
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,456
Many say that they prefer to see more works

317
00:17:07,456 --> 00:17:10,197
in progress than the final art.

318
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:13,018
And so, this is an example of how knowing these,

319
00:17:13,018 --> 00:17:15,918
how these promises operate can help with your decisions.

320
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:19,579
So on to the reliving promise.

321
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:23,887
So the reliving promise, it's about providing

322
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:25,751
a dependable pleasure.

323
00:17:26,885 --> 00:17:31,808
What that dependable pleasure is, is determined by you and the players.

324
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:35,970
It's the eternal question of what stays the same and what changes.

325
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:36,991
Right?

326
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:39,732
Often audio moments continue across projects.

327
00:17:39,732 --> 00:17:44,975
It's a submarine clang that Grant Kirkhope took from the Golden Eye film

328
00:17:44,975 --> 00:17:46,116
and put into the game.

329
00:17:46,116 --> 00:17:49,858
Or the music, an opening flying sequence over the pine trees

330
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:51,979
and mountains in the Twin Peaks.

331
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:55,862
So changes can happen around those dependable pleasures.

332
00:17:57,697 --> 00:18:03,478
The example is Papers, Please, which gives us key moments

333
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:04,979
that we know from the game.

334
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:06,459
I haven't got that here for some reason.

335
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:07,400
It's disappeared.

336
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,800
OK, I'm going to skip that.

337
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,221
But you know Papers, Please, and basically it's

338
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:14,042
the short film of the game with a lot of the mechanics

339
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:17,023
that we see in the game also happening in the film.

340
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,532
Here's another example, Brandon Brain's Burly Man at Sea.

341
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:25,093
Some of you would have played this.

342
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:28,055
They promise a great reliving experience.

343
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:33,339
After playing through their folktale adventure, which you can play through again and again

344
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:38,982
exploring different regions, at the end of each playthrough you are given a code which

345
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:41,764
is depicted in a digital book which is on the bookcase there.

346
00:18:42,585 --> 00:18:47,630
And then you can go to their website, put in the code and order a printed book version

347
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,733
of your personal playthrough through the game.

348
00:18:51,355 --> 00:18:58,500
But the art, while the same as being in the game, was different, was so different in key

349
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,463
places that I didn't feel as if I was experiencing the key moments I wanted again.

350
00:19:03,463 --> 00:19:08,847
So this is an example of what Donald Norman calls the gulf of execution, where the actions

351
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:14,691
that we provide do not correspond with the intentions of our users, not meeting the promise.

352
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:18,896
But if we as creators know what our players are expecting,

353
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:23,703
so then we can nuance the emphasis between the familiar and the unfamiliar accordingly.

354
00:19:27,404 --> 00:19:28,645
I don't know what's happening to my slides.

355
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:28,685
OK.

356
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:32,329
Another example here is Kentucky Route Zero,

357
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:36,874
which has lots of interludes between all of their acts,

358
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:38,175
games and stories.

359
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:41,198
The most recent features a live action video footage

360
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:43,501
of the local community television station

361
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:45,142
and a digital game version of it.

362
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:50,368
Having the same event juxtaposed in two art forms

363
00:19:50,368 --> 00:19:55,633
forces you to look at the differences between them in an exciting way.

364
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:59,257
And the creators are very aware of the player experience of these projects

365
00:19:59,257 --> 00:20:03,461
and rewards them with lots of intertextual references between the two works.

366
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,462
So for instance, in the live action video,

367
00:20:05,462 --> 00:20:10,285
the character there, Rita, she mentions,

368
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:12,266
oh, we're about to have a guest on,

369
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:14,808
who you may have already met,

370
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:16,789
referring to the fact that if you'd played the game

371
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:18,970
before watching the video, you would have met her there.

372
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,266
And their references actually go quite further,

373
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,288
and Robert Yang has written a post about the fact

374
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:28,331
that they also do references

375
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:31,215
to player discussions there as well.

376
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:32,797
And the one thing that Cardboard Computer,

377
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:35,921
that Cardboard Computer devs also use a lot of

378
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:37,383
is the inhabiting promise.

379
00:20:39,393 --> 00:20:45,096
There are two key ways that the inhabiting promise can be met, which is basically about

380
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:48,419
the promise to be inside a creative world.

381
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:53,462
Inhabiting can occur via transportation to the creative world, or it can happen when

382
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:56,144
the creative world transports to us.

383
00:20:56,144 --> 00:20:57,745
Let me explain that a bit further.

384
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:05,444
It's being able to explore the alien world of Pandora at the theme park or being able to enter

385
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:11,187
Van Gogh's in the bedroom painting as you can see in the picture there

386
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:16,249
You could actually hire out this room when the Art Institute of Chicago teamed up with Airbnb

387
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:21,171
So you can transport away from your world and immerse yourself into the created world

388
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:26,308
An example is, you must be 18 or older to enter,

389
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:29,790
where the conceit is you're alone at home

390
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,912
and you heard about this thing called porn at school.

391
00:21:33,912 --> 00:21:35,833
Opportune cough.

392
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:41,576
So this installation that was actually set up at Slamdance,

393
00:21:41,576 --> 00:21:44,818
the nifty thing about this experience

394
00:21:44,818 --> 00:21:47,760
is that on the other side, you can see a window there.

395
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,140
On the other side of the window, that's

396
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,121
where people were getting their photograph taken.

397
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:54,102
And so there were moments in the game where it suddenly

398
00:21:54,102 --> 00:21:56,103
takes over with all the moaning sounds of porn.

399
00:21:56,103 --> 00:21:59,284
So you quite literally feel the embarrassment

400
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,565
of having other people witnessing you feeling porn,

401
00:22:01,565 --> 00:22:04,646
which is exactly what the game is designed to do.

402
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:07,767
And so the key essence of the end point

403
00:22:07,767 --> 00:22:10,488
of the game experience is then articulated

404
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:11,388
in the installation.

405
00:22:13,163 --> 00:22:18,389
So the reverse of transportation is when the created world enters your world, enters the

406
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:20,071
player's world.

407
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:25,097
An example is QuestGen's The Magic Circle, which is a metafictional game where you play

408
00:22:25,097 --> 00:22:27,660
the protagonist in an unfinished game.

409
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,745
You can wander through the unfinished world and hear the trials of the designers stuck

410
00:22:31,745 --> 00:22:32,586
in development hell.

411
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:39,730
Now the company Quistion also have their usual website and their press kit, but they've also

412
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,612
created a website for the fictional developers with their own social media and their own

413
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:46,393
press releases.

414
00:22:46,393 --> 00:22:48,314
So the world actually overlaps with our own.

415
00:22:49,838 --> 00:22:53,880
Another one is Jacob's Game Paradigm,

416
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,922
which is a surreal adventure game set in a strange,

417
00:22:56,922 --> 00:22:59,683
post-apocalyptic Eastern European country.

418
00:22:59,683 --> 00:23:04,005
Jacob has the protagonists actually existing on Tinder.

419
00:23:04,005 --> 00:23:07,807
There is a travel guide for the fictional country you can get

420
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:09,928
and a book on the fictional religion.

421
00:23:09,928 --> 00:23:13,250
There's also a floppy disk that you can buy for the game,

422
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,531
which doesn't work, but there's a bit

423
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:16,811
of a nostalgia promise there.

424
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:20,613
Now, I have bought the floppy disk, but not the game yet.

425
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:24,875
So this is an example of different art forms appealing

426
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,077
to different people, but also potentially being

427
00:23:27,077 --> 00:23:28,477
a conversion tool.

428
00:23:28,477 --> 00:23:31,819
There are so many examples of the inhabiting promise.

429
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:36,402
The Ellen Wakefiles book that is credited to the in-game author.

430
00:23:36,402 --> 00:23:39,303
The play in Kentucky Route Zero that you can buy

431
00:23:39,303 --> 00:23:41,624
and is credited to the in-game character.

432
00:23:41,624 --> 00:23:45,086
The Pip-Boy that you could actually purchase and use.

433
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:52,215
In fact, this inhabiting promise is such an allure that in the upcoming Star Wars theme

434
00:23:52,215 --> 00:23:57,401
park there are areas that you will only be able to get infection merchandise.

435
00:24:02,229 --> 00:24:04,590
So the shaping promise, the final one here,

436
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,850
is something different.

437
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,211
We all know fan fiction and the creations

438
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:12,493
that fans make in response to your creative projects,

439
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,173
if you're lucky.

440
00:24:14,173 --> 00:24:16,034
You have no control over that.

441
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:18,115
Players do that if they want.

442
00:24:18,115 --> 00:24:20,616
But when you as developers facilitate

443
00:24:20,616 --> 00:24:22,636
that happening in your creative projects,

444
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:24,497
you're working with the shaping promise.

445
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:27,638
It's the promise of being able to make,

446
00:24:27,638 --> 00:24:30,319
allowing the players to make it more like them.

447
00:24:30,984 --> 00:24:33,466
An example is mods.

448
00:24:33,466 --> 00:24:38,749
And recently we had one with the Game Masters Toolkit that Defiant Development have offered

449
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:41,871
for players to make their own encounters and full challenges.

450
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:47,495
And it's something that they said they knew that their community would want.

451
00:24:47,495 --> 00:24:52,858
It's also figurines, which can be a way for us to play out our own adventures with the

452
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:57,622
characters we love and want more of, like Boba Fett and Maisie.

453
00:24:59,145 --> 00:25:02,848
Indeed, you could conceivably say that the more of these

454
00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:06,151
promises that you offer and deliver on, the more likely you

455
00:25:06,151 --> 00:25:10,034
are to appeal to a range of players and keep them.

456
00:25:10,034 --> 00:25:12,195
And I have mentioned some key ones today.

457
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:18,315
So when you're deciding what media you'll choose,

458
00:25:18,315 --> 00:25:21,396
it isn't about what the big studios do

459
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:24,638
or even what art form is popular necessarily.

460
00:25:24,638 --> 00:25:27,039
Everyone may be doing graphic novels,

461
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,760
but it may not be of any interest to you personally

462
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,241
or fit your game world.

463
00:25:31,741 --> 00:25:37,165
The key that we've learned today is not to decide purely based on the object, the media.

464
00:25:37,165 --> 00:25:43,009
The critical aspect that will make or break the design of your indie game franchise is

465
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,570
to think about what your players are looking for.

466
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:51,054
They're looking beyond your media to something else, to the revealing, reliving, inhabiting

467
00:25:51,054 --> 00:25:52,935
and shaping promises.

468
00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:56,717
But lastly, there's something even more powerful than all of these.

469
00:25:57,438 --> 00:25:59,583
It is the ultimate multiplier.

470
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:02,250
It's something that once again operates in all art forms

471
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,174
because it operates in all people.

472
00:26:08,363 --> 00:26:10,445
and it's the values promise.

473
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:12,746
The promise of giving the player something

474
00:26:12,746 --> 00:26:15,687
they believe in being.

475
00:26:15,687 --> 00:26:18,849
Shalom Schwartz in the Journal of Cross-Cultural Marketing

476
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:21,190
explains how our values have been shown

477
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,811
to influence our career choices,

478
00:26:22,811 --> 00:26:26,833
our political persuasions, our feelings of well-being,

479
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:30,575
and for us now, what entertainment we choose to engage with.

480
00:26:31,276 --> 00:26:36,223
And he researched the recurring values that have happened across 20 countries

481
00:26:36,223 --> 00:26:40,811
and has published the results, which I use in my design.

482
00:26:40,811 --> 00:26:42,614
I use this on top of theme.

483
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:52,445
Indeed, Nina Simone, the executive director at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History,

484
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:57,526
talks about the importance of relevance and drawing visitors into museums.

485
00:26:57,526 --> 00:27:02,247
She warns that it doesn't matter how powerful the experience is inside the room,

486
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:08,269
how great your game is, film, TV or whatever, if most people don't even choose to enter it.

487
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:11,910
So you have to think about why they come to you

488
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,932
and what value they actually get.

489
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:17,013
And the more you start to matter to people, she explains,

490
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:19,235
the more they will desire opportunities

491
00:27:19,235 --> 00:27:21,696
to actually go deeper.

492
00:27:21,696 --> 00:27:24,778
They will come back and they will ask for more.

493
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:26,219
If you, and I will add this,

494
00:27:26,219 --> 00:27:29,841
that if you actually don't think about values in your design

495
00:27:29,841 --> 00:27:31,522
they will still be there.

496
00:27:31,522 --> 00:27:34,364
But they will default to the values of the status quo.

497
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:41,480
But if you consciously think about them, they may be different and will resonate with players.

498
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,460
Take David Reilly's everything.

499
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:49,563
You have the game, you have the 10-minute gameplay film and you have the soundtrack

500
00:27:49,563 --> 00:27:54,104
and you also have the Alan Watts recordings that were specially made for the game that

501
00:27:54,104 --> 00:27:55,545
you can also purchase.

502
00:27:55,545 --> 00:28:01,007
And throughout all of them are the values of self-direction, for instance, and universalism.

503
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,705
You can be introduced to the values through the film,

504
00:28:05,705 --> 00:28:08,448
you can purchase the soundtrack to relive the game,

505
00:28:08,448 --> 00:28:11,532
but you can also purchase the voiceover recordings

506
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:14,716
of Alan Watts to take those words,

507
00:28:14,716 --> 00:28:16,138
to listen to them and let them change you.

508
00:28:18,543 --> 00:28:23,666
So creating your own indie game franchise is possible.

509
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:26,948
You experience lots of art forms every day as players.

510
00:28:26,948 --> 00:28:29,969
It's time to practice it as designers.

511
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:31,910
Resist all the forces that are holding you back.

512
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,671
The secrets have actually been right in front of us.

513
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,953
Indeed, if we look even further back in history,

514
00:28:37,953 --> 00:28:40,254
beyond when the term franchise

515
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:42,755
was all about commercialization and rights.

516
00:28:43,075 --> 00:28:47,577
we find that it actually derives from the French verb franchir,

517
00:28:47,577 --> 00:28:50,357
with apologies, franchir,

518
00:28:50,357 --> 00:28:53,398
which means to go beyond the limits of something,

519
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:58,400
to jump over, to cross a threshold, to give liberty to, to make free.

520
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,561
So go forth and free the art forms that you have inside you

521
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:04,401
and make that indeed franchise.

522
00:29:04,401 --> 00:29:05,422
Thank you for your time.
