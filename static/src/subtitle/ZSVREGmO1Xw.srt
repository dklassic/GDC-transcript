1
00:00:02,957 --> 00:00:06,440
I'm going to get really close to a grown man, talk about stickers for an hour.

2
00:00:09,502 --> 00:00:10,423
My name is Rob Davio.

3
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:14,687
I've been a game designer for 18 years, board game designer professionally most of that

4
00:00:14,707 --> 00:00:15,488
time with Hasbro.

5
00:00:16,468 --> 00:00:18,010
I'll get into that a little bit as we go.

6
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:20,773
And out of all the games I've done,

7
00:00:20,793 --> 00:00:22,914
and I don't have an exact count,

8
00:00:22,954 --> 00:00:25,555
but I've done 70 or 80 games in various forms

9
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:28,396
over those 18 years, nothing has quite resonated

10
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:31,777
more than the three games that I put out,

11
00:00:31,837 --> 00:00:34,057
Risk Legacy, Pandemic Legacy, and Seafall.

12
00:00:36,658 --> 00:00:38,059
And I couldn't figure out why,

13
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:40,739
and I'm still not sure I figured out why,

14
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:42,200
but I'm gonna give an attempt today

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,541
to talk about why these games

16
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:46,021
have sort of caught on how they have,

17
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:47,421
why they are controversial.

18
00:00:49,196 --> 00:00:50,596
where they might go from here.

19
00:00:52,577 --> 00:00:55,938
I'm gonna talk for 35 to 45 minutes

20
00:00:56,018 --> 00:00:58,078
and then we'll take questions from people here.

21
00:00:58,098 --> 00:01:00,559
But before I begin, I just wanted to kind of get a sense

22
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:04,020
of what you're looking for in the talk.

23
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,581
So who has played a Legacy game here?

24
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:07,961
All right, so most of you.

25
00:01:08,895 --> 00:01:11,376
I will keep it spoiler free for those of you who haven't.

26
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:12,736
It's just second nature now.

27
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:14,776
It's like some sort of deep training, if you want.

28
00:01:14,796 --> 00:01:15,737
I'm an operative.

29
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:17,477
I just maintain cover the entire time.

30
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,918
Who is thinking of designing a Legacy game?

31
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:23,699
OK, a few brave souls out there.

32
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:28,000
So I'll give some tips on what I've learned and what I do now

33
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,561
when I approach new ones, because I have one that's

34
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:33,962
coming out later this year, and I'm working on three other

35
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:34,502
ones right now.

36
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,951
So just to give a little background of where I am

37
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,651
and what I'm doing and to kind of warm up

38
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:39,752
with some shameless plugs.

39
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:42,132
I do non-legacy stuff.

40
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:43,733
I know it's a big surprise to many people

41
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:45,333
and I have some games coming out later this year

42
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:46,094
or early next year.

43
00:01:46,114 --> 00:01:48,514
I've got a game based on the Lock and Key comic book,

44
00:01:49,555 --> 00:01:51,775
a game in the middle based on

45
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:53,916
Mountains of Madness by Lovecraft.

46
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:56,697
That one's a little different because I think

47
00:01:56,737 --> 00:01:59,198
it's really boring when the characters get to go insane

48
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:00,798
but the players don't, so I tried to.

49
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:03,273
I tried to change that for this one.

50
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:06,374
And then a game for the Titans of Gaming,

51
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:08,255
which is about opposite from a legacy game

52
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,575
in my usual work, as you can do.

53
00:02:09,855 --> 00:02:12,937
I'm also the chief restoration officer

54
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:15,058
in a new game company called Restoration Games,

55
00:02:15,098 --> 00:02:17,879
where we take old, out-of-print games

56
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:19,880
and restore them and put them back in print.

57
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,100
And this is our first year's line

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,541
that we're just finishing up right now,

59
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:23,741
and they'll be out later this year.

60
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:24,661
So, Stop Thief from 1979.

61
00:02:26,662 --> 00:02:30,943
uh... indulgence in down force a renamed from the game called dragon master and a

62
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:32,004
game called top race

63
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:35,665
uh... so that's fun so sometimes i'm just mining the ball for

64
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:36,645
old ideas

65
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:39,406
and bring them back but what i'm really gonna talk about

66
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,206
today is

67
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:42,286
covenants

68
00:02:43,147 --> 00:02:43,407
and

69
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:46,407
i had a ton of really bad are for the covenant

70
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:47,368
jokes

71
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,028
uh... that i'm not going to get into

72
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:54,537
and you're welcome for that because when I woke up this morning I realized how awful

73
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:58,141
they were. They were so clever when I wrote them, like awful clever, but they're not clever

74
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:04,346
whatsoever. And by covenants I mean nothing legal, nothing binding, nothing biblical,

75
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:09,071
but almost every human interaction, especially when you're dealing with strangers, has some

76
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:10,452
sort of underlying covenant.

77
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:19,669
you don't expect the cook to poison your food at a restaurant, you don't expect to be punched in the face when you buy coffee or walk down the street, right?

78
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:26,170
Some things are illegal, and then there's some things that are just sort of culturally inappropriate and vary from culture to culture,

79
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,832
and it's no different as a game designer, I realize, that when you make a game as a game designer,

80
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:39,554
you have a covenant with the players and there are certain expectations that are sort of unspoken and perhaps even unknown to both parties

81
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,614
that you are agreeing to.

82
00:03:41,174 --> 00:03:44,617
to deal with and basically be beholden to.

83
00:03:44,677 --> 00:03:48,741
What I realize is that legacy games are disruptive in a way

84
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:52,644
and controversial because when I came up with the idea,

85
00:03:52,684 --> 00:03:55,226
I accidentally broke a number of these covenants,

86
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,129
which makes it sort of exhilarating in one sense

87
00:03:58,189 --> 00:03:59,870
and off-putting in another to some people

88
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,771
who don't want them broken.

89
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:01,552
This is the same thing.

90
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:04,652
and I'm not comparing myself to him or his success,

91
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:07,753
but that George R. R. Martin did with Game of Thrones,

92
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:10,054
which is there is a covenant that the main character

93
00:04:10,114 --> 00:04:12,514
cannot be really killed, just set back.

94
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:15,735
And he made a pretty good point of saying

95
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:17,296
he could abuse that main notion,

96
00:04:17,316 --> 00:04:19,836
and he did it so that the reader would always be nervous

97
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:21,697
and care more about every character

98
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:24,678
because no one was truly safe.

99
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:27,358
So I think sometimes, you know,

100
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:28,619
if you're designing something creative

101
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,259
and you're designing something new,

102
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:35,101
if at all possible, and I don't know how possible this is

103
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:37,463
because this is me looking back eight years later

104
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:39,725
and spending a lot of time thinking about it,

105
00:04:40,206 --> 00:04:41,747
being able to identify covenants

106
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:45,470
between the person that you're designing something for

107
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,272
and yourself and figuring out if these are actual covenants

108
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:51,495
that are inviolate and need to be maintained

109
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:55,918
or if it's something that's just a cultural shorthand

110
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,320
that can be broken or otherwise manipulated.

111
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,330
That's about as heady as we're going to get in this.

112
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,211
After this, we're going to talk about games and stickers.

113
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:07,873
So what path led me to deciding one day that it was going to be

114
00:05:07,913 --> 00:05:10,535
really fun to make a game that you write on and that you rip

115
00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:11,195
up cards for?

116
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:12,756
So it all starts in the 70s.

117
00:05:12,796 --> 00:05:14,937
That's not exactly me, but it might as well be me.

118
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:19,299
Everyone was blonde, and the world was orange from the

119
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:21,560
friction from the corduroy or something like that that was

120
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,040
going on.

121
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,161
So I grew up.

122
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:24,161
I grew up in the 70s.

123
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:26,743
And then when I got to about 1980, I discovered D&D, which

124
00:05:26,763 --> 00:05:28,243
is storytelling.

125
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,501
One game leads to another.

126
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:33,582
And I got so good at it, I moved on to advanced D&D.

127
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:34,943
So that's why I get to be up here,

128
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:36,103
because I became advanced.

129
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,584
And so whole new things changed there.

130
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:41,925
D&D remains a through line through a lot of my designs

131
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:42,966
and a lot of my thinking.

132
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:46,807
And when I was 12 years old, I played a lot of it.

133
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,308
When people ask me now, what's your favorite game?

134
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,108
I say, it's very simple.

135
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:51,169
It's playing first edition D&D with my friends

136
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:52,109
and my brothers when I'm 12.

137
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,190
But I don't get to do that anymore.

138
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:58,573
But it's maintained and the idea of getting up one morning and then saying like,

139
00:05:58,593 --> 00:05:59,734
where were we yesterday?

140
00:06:00,535 --> 00:06:01,375
What was happening?

141
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:04,898
And then something happens and then a character dies or you lose something,

142
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:08,961
you get that bad die roll and you fudge it all the time in D&D.

143
00:06:08,981 --> 00:06:11,823
But in general, you get this sense of things have just moved forward and

144
00:06:11,844 --> 00:06:13,285
you're just picking up where you left off.

145
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:16,133
So that's always been in my mind.

146
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:18,455
And I discovered D&D when I was at camp at age 12.

147
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:20,616
And at the same time, because I didn't really want to go away to camp,

148
00:06:20,656 --> 00:06:23,818
my parents let me bring my first comic books.

149
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:25,979
That was the exact one that I, well, not the exact one.

150
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:29,921
It's a picture of the exact one that I got to bring with me.

151
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:32,222
And again, this also, this episodic storytelling,

152
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:33,583
what happens in the next chapter.

153
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:35,484
And it's not uncommon.

154
00:06:35,504 --> 00:06:36,204
It's television.

155
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:37,005
It's comic books.

156
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,466
It's serialized novels of the 19th century.

157
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:41,007
But the idea is.

158
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:45,179
pick up where you left off. And then, you know, I went through and I played a ton of

159
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:51,461
I played a ton of Infocom games. I still get nostalgia seeing that blue on cyan screen.

160
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:56,223
Like, that's like, why isn't this still the default user interface in the world? Nothing

161
00:06:56,283 --> 00:07:02,165
has been improved upon since that. So I played a lot of those games. And then, let's see

162
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:05,727
if anyone, I did, had two deep nerd cuts I wanted to bring up. I was a member of the

163
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:09,988
Star Wars fan club and got Bantha Tracks magazine delivered to me.

164
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,822
which got me so hyped for Empire Strikes Back

165
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:18,184
because I was seven to 10 reading a quarterly, I think,

166
00:07:18,844 --> 00:07:20,685
fan news magazine, they're sending pictures,

167
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:23,206
and I was out of my mind, like only a kid could be,

168
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:25,367
and then somehow the movie was better.

169
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:28,548
So I also will maintain that that is the best movie

170
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:30,069
ever made because it was for me.

171
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:31,369
And on the right is something called

172
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,470
Adventure Construction Kit.

173
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,471
Has anyone seen this or played with it?

174
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:35,611
Couple people?

175
00:07:35,711 --> 00:07:37,012
Oh wow, of course, I'm at the GDC.

176
00:07:39,153 --> 00:07:42,995
This was something put out 1985, 84, 86,

177
00:07:43,655 --> 00:07:47,397
which basically let you create your own little world.

178
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:49,879
And you had characters and you could set different genres

179
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,500
and write dialogues and walk around

180
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,660
and open chess and do stuff.

181
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,701
And I played around and I sort of fell in love

182
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:55,662
with the theory of it.

183
00:07:55,702 --> 00:07:58,283
I think in the reality, either I was using it wrong

184
00:07:58,323 --> 00:08:00,004
or they were missing one vital point,

185
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:01,385
which is when you play tested it

186
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:03,446
and kind of move people around and did things,

187
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:04,407
when you wanted to reset it,

188
00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:06,208
you had to go manually put everything back.

189
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,729
You couldn't just be like, let's reset.

190
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:10,050
And so you test them, like this is great.

191
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,432
Move this guy back, put that in the chest, lock this door.

192
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:14,154
So I never really moved on.

193
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:18,878
So these are some of the things that formulated my life

194
00:08:18,938 --> 00:08:20,259
as a kid, and I never thought for a moment

195
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,740
it would lead to anything professional.

196
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,561
When I grew up at age 28,

197
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:26,123
I became a professional game designer,

198
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:29,806
which still seems, even though it is a ton of work,

199
00:08:29,846 --> 00:08:32,188
it seems in some way like it can't actually be

200
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:33,249
what I've been doing for a living.

201
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:35,975
I mean, my career is old enough to vote and smoke,

202
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:38,637
so it should feel normal right now.

203
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:42,160
Along the line, a couple games that I worked on,

204
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,862
Risk 2210 AD, which started to talk about

205
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,804
making bigger games and factions

206
00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:49,605
and working with an engine already,

207
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,266
in this case, the Risk engine to do more.

208
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:54,689
interesting things and you know that's part of the thread that would lead to

209
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:55,350
Risk Legacy.

210
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:59,373
I was one of the three people

211
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:04,136
who all claim 70 percent of the design work on Betrayal at House on the Hill

212
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:07,519
which is probably fair because it's a big game.

213
00:09:08,776 --> 00:09:10,338
And then I think the math holds.

214
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,700
I was not the original inventor on that,

215
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,742
but I worked on it for about a year and a half at Hasbro,

216
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:17,165
some sort of either second designer or developer,

217
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:18,326
there's really no word for it.

218
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:20,088
But I kind of fell in love with the fact

219
00:09:20,128 --> 00:09:20,929
that you start a game

220
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:22,771
and then it goes in an unexpected direction.

221
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:25,534
Like you're halfway and like, you got surprised by the game.

222
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:27,596
You literally don't know when you're starting the game,

223
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:30,739
what's going to happen or even how to win.

224
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:33,606
So the idea that a game can sort of come out

225
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,507
and surprise you while you're playing it

226
00:09:35,527 --> 00:09:37,628
was something I inherited from the inventor of this

227
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:39,089
and get to spend a lot of time with

228
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:40,149
and sort of internalized.

229
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,951
I was one of the designers on HeroScape.

230
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,912
So then again, like narrative storytelling

231
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:48,394
and campaign development,

232
00:09:48,514 --> 00:09:51,035
and I'm still really proud of this game.

233
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:52,076
The fact that we sold it as,

234
00:09:52,616 --> 00:09:55,518
take your toy box and shake it out onto your Lego set

235
00:09:55,598 --> 00:09:56,818
and then you've got a game.

236
00:09:57,912 --> 00:10:03,054
Unfortunately, the price of plastic is tied into the price of petroleum, and from when

237
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:06,795
we conceived the idea until like five years later, it became sort of cost ineffective

238
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:07,096
to me.

239
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:13,258
But the one game that I think is the direct predecessor to the legacy idea is something

240
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:16,579
that most people don't even know of and would be very surprised to find out what it is,

241
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,360
which is Lord of the Rings Trivial Pursuit DVD.

242
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,461
I'm sorry, Trivial Pursuit Lord of the Rings DVD, the Trivial Pursuit brand comes first.

243
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:27,954
This was something I worked on.

244
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:29,475
I worked on a number of DVD games

245
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:30,656
in the middle of last decade.

246
00:10:32,277 --> 00:10:33,918
If you think you have restrictions

247
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,380
in the code you have to work with,

248
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,302
DVDs were a whole other exciting world.

249
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:41,044
There was no real standard to them.

250
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:44,226
Different DVD players would make different calls

251
00:10:44,286 --> 00:10:47,148
to different code at however they wanted to do it

252
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:48,670
because most of the time you put it in

253
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,971
and you played a movie.

254
00:10:51,171 --> 00:10:52,552
But this was a fad and this was a thing

255
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:53,833
and Hasbro jumped on board

256
00:10:53,873 --> 00:10:54,894
and I did a number of things with it.

257
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,014
And what I did with Lord of the Rings, I was doing a lot of work with Trivial Pursuit at the time,

258
00:10:59,755 --> 00:11:01,598
is, Trivial Pursuit is a box of cards,

259
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:05,623
and you take out a card and you read it. I don't know why I'm telling you this, you kind of understand how that works.

260
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,441
But there's something interesting about themed trivia.

261
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:13,462
Themed trivia, the person buying this

262
00:11:13,602 --> 00:11:15,283
probably knows Lord of the Rings.

263
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,384
You wouldn't buy it for them

264
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:17,704
or you wouldn't buy it for yourself

265
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:19,185
unless you had an interest in Lord of the Rings.

266
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,306
But that person playing a trivia game

267
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:23,247
is probably with people who don't know

268
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,748
as much as they do about Lord of the Rings.

269
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:26,369
So you have a dilemma as a designer,

270
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:27,810
which is do you write easy questions

271
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,990
or do you write hard questions?

272
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:31,472
Because either way, you're alienating

273
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:33,253
about half of your audience

274
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,393
who's likely to be playing this.

275
00:11:35,014 --> 00:11:37,115
So what you usually end up doing is doing a mix of both,

276
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:38,257
and then you put it in a card box,

277
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,378
and you randomly draw it out.

278
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:42,400
And you get a question, and now again,

279
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,782
you've got a 50% chance of the person who's good at it

280
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:46,304
getting some really obvious question,

281
00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:47,625
and the person who's not good at it

282
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,467
getting some ludicrous question,

283
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:51,148
and they both feel frustrated by the experience.

284
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,550
So I had what I thought was a clever idea.

285
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:58,196
of on the DVD, sort of turning the box of cards,

286
00:11:58,236 --> 00:11:59,899
which is randomly shuffled into something,

287
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,320
and this is an analog version,

288
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,923
which is a more controlled experience.

289
00:12:03,543 --> 00:12:07,108
So there are different pre-programmed games on the DVD,

290
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:09,391
and game one starts in the Shire

291
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:11,534
and contains very easy questions in game...

292
00:12:12,955 --> 00:12:19,296
15 or 18 was on Mount Doom and contained all hard questions so you could, as a group, decide

293
00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:21,537
how you were going to play and which level you were going to play in.

294
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:27,138
It essentially took the random box of cards and just sorted it from easy to hard.

295
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:33,640
People lost their shit because I made a consumable game that had an end.

296
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:37,334
Amazon reviews were difficult.

297
00:12:37,894 --> 00:12:39,055
When you're done, you're done.

298
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:40,335
You can't go back and replay it.

299
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,698
The fact that a box of cards has the same number

300
00:12:43,738 --> 00:12:46,199
of questions, but I just sort them in order,

301
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,940
was an argument that I couldn't make.

302
00:12:48,621 --> 00:12:52,363
Because the box is perceived to be infinitely replayable,

303
00:12:52,383 --> 00:12:53,764
and there's this weird psychological thing

304
00:12:53,784 --> 00:12:55,405
where if you draw out a question you've had before,

305
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:57,306
you just go, I've had that before,

306
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:58,167
and you read another one,

307
00:12:58,327 --> 00:12:59,447
because you just don't know.

308
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:02,029
Somewhere in that box is a magic new question

309
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:03,610
that you haven't found before.

310
00:13:04,728 --> 00:13:07,890
So it was weird, because I'm thinking, Hasbro had researched this.

311
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,732
So it was an active game family plays like twice a year.

312
00:13:13,913 --> 00:13:16,194
So that box can last a long time.

313
00:13:16,234 --> 00:13:18,275
And this DVD can last a long time.

314
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:20,516
And I thought I had done something very interesting

315
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:22,237
to make a better user experience.

316
00:13:22,697 --> 00:13:27,099
But what I realized is that perceived infinite replay is highly valued.

317
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:31,055
in the board game. So I'm going to talk about a lot of covenants and a lot of assumptions

318
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:35,798
right now and they all apply to board games. I realize that a lot of these don't apply

319
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:43,983
to digital games and I stole or I guess borrowed or was inspired by a lot of digital pieces

320
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:49,606
when I was porting them over to the analog world. So somehow infinite replay was highly

321
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:49,966
valued.

322
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:56,382
And what I had done is I had broken a covenant that I didn't even realize, and I don't think anyone realizes existed,

323
00:13:56,822 --> 00:14:02,191
which is the player of the board game decides how much a game is played.

324
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:04,350
And that's always been the case.

325
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,953
When you buy a board game, it is up to you to decide how long

326
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:08,693
that game is played.

327
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,275
It is not up to me as a designer.

328
00:14:10,295 --> 00:14:12,837
And what I had done is I had taken away sort of a

329
00:14:13,017 --> 00:14:15,058
fundamental agreement from the players that said, no, no,

330
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:15,919
this is my decision.

331
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:17,120
This is my decision now.

332
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:19,062
I'm deciding how much you play.

333
00:14:19,362 --> 00:14:21,203
And even though it was basically more than they would

334
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:24,286
ever play and gave them a better experience when they

335
00:14:24,326 --> 00:14:28,189
played, I had accidentally violated this covenant of who

336
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:29,750
gets to make this decision.

337
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,962
And that is something that continues

338
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:34,052
with the Legacy game series.

339
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,493
Not really getting into what the legacy is,

340
00:14:37,513 --> 00:14:38,694
but I guess I'll take a quick brief thing.

341
00:14:38,714 --> 00:14:40,515
I assume if you're here, you know how they play,

342
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:42,717
but I guess for 30 seconds, I'll say some of the actions

343
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:43,757
you take place in one game,

344
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:45,578
carry forward into the next game.

345
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:47,700
That's wrapped up within a narrative

346
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,822
that has emergent content through packets and envelopes.

347
00:14:50,882 --> 00:14:52,443
And then at the end of this campaign,

348
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:53,904
the game is either completely finished

349
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:56,385
in the case of a pandemic or sort of stabilizes

350
00:14:57,486 --> 00:14:59,147
and you can play it in its final state

351
00:14:59,207 --> 00:15:01,728
in the case of Risk Legacy and Seafall.

352
00:15:03,873 --> 00:15:06,818
But some reason this covenant, I took it away.

353
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:09,241
Even yesterday on a different panel I did

354
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:11,584
on pandemic legacy, one of the questions at the end,

355
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:12,366
someone said, well, yeah,

356
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:13,728
given that you can only play it once.

357
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:16,716
And it was sort of like this lead thing,

358
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:18,336
and I don't think it meant to be confrontational,

359
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,617
but when you hear that for about eight years running,

360
00:15:20,657 --> 00:15:22,538
it gets confrontational.

361
00:15:22,558 --> 00:15:23,338
And I said, well, hold on,

362
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:26,219
you get to play it about 16 or 18 times,

363
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,939
and instead of being something

364
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:29,960
where you can only play it 16 or 18 times,

365
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,901
I've given you a reason to play it 16 or 18 times.

366
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:34,281
But that's a very interesting argument

367
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:35,141
because it's very emotional

368
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:35,902
because it's about this covenant.

369
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:37,742
If you took something away, that's my choice.

370
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:40,556
And you can do it at a restaurant, well,

371
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:42,056
you can do it at restaurants now,

372
00:15:42,116 --> 00:15:43,617
like oh, just whatever the chef wants,

373
00:15:43,657 --> 00:15:45,438
or give me the tasting menu and I'm not gonna pick,

374
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,738
but you can still see what's coming,

375
00:15:47,018 --> 00:15:49,819
and you can opt out, or not go to the restaurant

376
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:50,499
or something like that.

377
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:52,400
So it's interesting of whether the creator

378
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,021
gets to decide how much they decide versus the end user.

379
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:57,252
And so I thought about it.

380
00:15:57,292 --> 00:15:59,294
I realized that people really want games

381
00:15:59,354 --> 00:16:00,576
to be like Groundhog Day.

382
00:16:01,236 --> 00:16:02,718
They want to start in the same place

383
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:03,739
when they wake up in the morning,

384
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,320
and they want to make little different choices

385
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,702
in their day to see where it ends,

386
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:10,165
and they want to do it as much as possible.

387
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:11,366
Do they want to save the,

388
00:16:11,827 --> 00:16:13,228
who is it, the kid who falls out of the tree?

389
00:16:13,248 --> 00:16:14,049
Do they want to, you know, and,

390
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:16,691
but Groundhog's Day is this sort of analogy

391
00:16:16,711 --> 00:16:18,873
in that the main character does mature and learn

392
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:20,755
and go on and know things different.

393
00:16:22,193 --> 00:16:24,756
People really like the conception of a board game

394
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:28,178
being in their control and that there's these safe parameters

395
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:30,580
around what they can do, which led

396
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,702
me to think about different experiences,

397
00:16:32,982 --> 00:16:36,345
different creative experiences if you're a consuming

398
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:37,026
narrative.

399
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:39,964
for the most part, or you're consuming something.

400
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:41,725
Some things are very repeatable,

401
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:43,706
and when you repeat them, they're exactly the same thing,

402
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:45,226
and some things are more experiential,

403
00:16:45,266 --> 00:16:47,067
which is like when you do it, you're done,

404
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,668
and you can't do it again,

405
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,169
or you can't do it exactly the same way.

406
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,030
And sort of the traditional ones,

407
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,671
and this is deliberately off-center,

408
00:16:53,691 --> 00:16:56,692
is there's a movie, and then you see the movie again,

409
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:58,793
and it's the movie, and then there's a book,

410
00:16:58,873 --> 00:17:02,415
and there's music, and when you put on Sergeant Pepper,

411
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:04,396
you're going to get the same songs in the same order.

412
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:06,518
And no one's upset about this.

413
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:09,820
In games, people want them to be largely repeatable,

414
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,742
but I moved the letter E over the line to be like,

415
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:13,643
but I want to experience it in a different way.

416
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:15,725
I want to come in at different angles and play with it,

417
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:18,007
but I want it to be a repeatable experience.

418
00:17:19,228 --> 00:17:20,389
But almost all of these things

419
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:21,650
which are traditionally repeatable

420
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,412
also have sort of an experiential equivalent.

421
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:26,694
So instead of going to a movie,

422
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:29,396
which granted, it's repeatable now

423
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,777
that you can just get it into your home

424
00:17:30,837 --> 00:17:32,718
or you can own it 50 years ago, it's different.

425
00:17:32,738 --> 00:17:33,999
But if you go to see a play,

426
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:36,420
which is a lot like a movie.

427
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,661
It's gonna be different every time.

428
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:40,922
You buy a ticket, depends like who the actors are,

429
00:17:40,982 --> 00:17:42,703
an understudy or what choices they made

430
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:43,503
or what theater it in.

431
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:45,344
And even if you see the exact same people do it

432
00:17:45,384 --> 00:17:46,185
three nights in a row,

433
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,046
it's going to have these little nuances.

434
00:17:48,086 --> 00:17:49,507
And if you don't like the play in the middle,

435
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:52,668
you can leave, but you don't get your money back

436
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:54,329
from your ticket and no one else can come in

437
00:17:54,629 --> 00:17:55,670
and take where you left off.

438
00:17:57,321 --> 00:17:58,802
you know if you want to see it again you gotta buy a new ticket.

439
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:01,884
It's the same thing with a concert, which is a musical equivalent to theater.

440
00:18:02,044 --> 00:18:05,947
And you know for books there are coloring books and there are crossword puzzles and

441
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:09,669
no one gets mad when they go back to their coloring book that they colored in and

442
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,410
they're like, God, you used up, like this.

443
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:13,504
This is ridiculous.

444
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:16,287
My other book isn't used up, but this one is.

445
00:18:16,947 --> 00:18:19,790
These had these sort of alternate versions

446
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,292
where you could experience them one and manipulate them

447
00:18:22,753 --> 00:18:23,473
and then be done.

448
00:18:23,814 --> 00:18:27,097
But the board game world didn't really have this equivalent.

449
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:28,938
And I'd like to say that I really sat down

450
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:30,280
and thought this all through at the time.

451
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,002
But again, this is looking back over years

452
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:35,004
of sort of unconscious thinking made conscious.

453
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:38,468
Now, there's one flip side that I just sort of made an analogy to,

454
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:41,771
and I put this out as a design challenge to all of you

455
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:43,553
that I hope no one takes me up on it,

456
00:18:43,613 --> 00:18:46,035
which is food is a consumable experience,

457
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:49,879
and no one has made a repeatable food experience yet.

458
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,401
So it can go the other way.

459
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:55,104
So that's an open space, free for you to design in,

460
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:56,905
however you like.

461
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:03,967
So some years pass and just circumstances,

462
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:06,208
and I've talked about this a lot in other talks and things,

463
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,869
so I'll kind of gloss over here

464
00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:09,190
because I'm trying not to duplicate

465
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,451
from other things you can find me talking about online.

466
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:14,133
There was this brainstorm where we were talking about Clue,

467
00:19:14,513 --> 00:19:16,995
and there was this big moment where I made a joke,

468
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,916
as I like to do in corporate meetings,

469
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:21,638
where I said, I don't know why they keep inviting

470
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:23,599
these people back to dinner every night.

471
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:24,839
They always kill someone.

472
00:19:25,912 --> 00:19:27,212
And everyone's like, ha ha ha.

473
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,773
And I was like, oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

474
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,455
And I said, well, what if the game didn't reset?

475
00:19:30,495 --> 00:19:32,296
What if it really was Tuesday after Monday

476
00:19:32,316 --> 00:19:33,637
and we knew that mustard killed someone?

477
00:19:34,377 --> 00:19:38,280
And my boss, who's a big game designer and things,

478
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,801
kind of gave me this like, oh, like we had this look,

479
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:43,303
like, well, that might be something.

480
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:44,304
And then everyone else was like,

481
00:19:44,364 --> 00:19:45,665
oh, that was a good joke about dinner.

482
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:48,266
So I kind of put it off to the side.

483
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:50,628
And then I, you know, I realized,

484
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:52,909
okay, I had found that thing.

485
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,611
I found a thing where you play a game and then the next day the game's kind of like,

486
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:57,812
it's the next day.

487
00:19:58,052 --> 00:19:58,852
It's, we're used to that.

488
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:00,253
We go to bed and we wake up, it's the next day.

489
00:20:00,273 --> 00:20:04,896
Like this is not a radical thought for any place except this gaming space.

490
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:06,376
And I got excited about that.

491
00:20:07,257 --> 00:20:07,857
And I'm like, well...

492
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,681
what really makes it the next day,

493
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:12,962
like when, what actions and consequences and things,

494
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:13,842
and how does this work?

495
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:14,743
And started playing around,

496
00:20:14,783 --> 00:20:16,384
and I came up with something,

497
00:20:16,404 --> 00:20:18,444
I realized what everyone's gonna do is one of two things.

498
00:20:18,604 --> 00:20:20,425
It's either they're going to start playing,

499
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:21,566
and they're gonna be playing Clue,

500
00:20:21,626 --> 00:20:23,827
and I had this, it was called Clue, the usual suspects,

501
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,388
and you're getting grudges and enemies,

502
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:26,308
and you need a little rap sheet,

503
00:20:26,348 --> 00:20:27,548
like in your world it's mustard,

504
00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:28,689
in your world it's peacock,

505
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:31,170
and there's a couple of things that are gonna happen.

506
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,631
One, people are gonna get to the point

507
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:33,871
where they don't like a decision

508
00:20:33,891 --> 00:20:34,972
they made a couple of games ago,

509
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:36,773
and they're going to rewind it.

510
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:39,613
they're going to be like, nope, revert to save.

511
00:20:40,353 --> 00:20:42,375
Okay, here's before I got the merchant mad

512
00:20:42,435 --> 00:20:44,436
and then I had the people chasing me in Skyrim,

513
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,777
so I'm gonna just back up to there.

514
00:20:47,218 --> 00:20:48,099
Because that's what you wanna do.

515
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:49,380
You wanna control your experience

516
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,082
so that you're always the hero of the story

517
00:20:52,202 --> 00:20:53,063
or the villain or whatever.

518
00:20:53,103 --> 00:20:54,304
You wanna be able to choose that

519
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:55,705
and you wanna be able to manipulate that

520
00:20:55,725 --> 00:20:57,927
and most games give you the ability to do that.

521
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:00,208
And that felt like cheating a bit to me.

522
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,084
And then I also realized, to be very selfish, is if...

523
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:06,906
How are you gonna track this?

524
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:08,768
How are you gonna get up and play a game?

525
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:10,390
I remember if you're playing twice a year or something,

526
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,111
even if it was a couple weeks,

527
00:21:11,151 --> 00:21:12,112
and you're like, what happened?

528
00:21:12,492 --> 00:21:15,135
And there was gonna be tokens and bags and markers,

529
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:16,436
and you would have to have this...

530
00:21:17,057 --> 00:21:20,059
very elaborate craft project about how this all goes together.

531
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:22,460
I'm like, if you just kind of wrote on it and put a sticker on it,

532
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:25,823
then it's just done and you don't have to worry about it coming apart.

533
00:21:25,903 --> 00:21:28,745
So part of this whole permanent was to prevent cheating,

534
00:21:28,785 --> 00:21:32,027
but a large part of it was to make my job easier and to make the game,

535
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:34,268
which I thought at the time was going to be like 10-year-olds playing Clue,

536
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:36,150
easier to manage.

537
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,372
And so then you get this idea of permanent change.

538
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:42,034
Now, the game doesn't tell you to burn things,

539
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,076
but some people are very, very excited about

540
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:50,495
the fact that they can finally abuse a game component.

541
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:53,937
Cause we don't, don't touch that,

542
00:21:53,957 --> 00:21:55,218
and don't eat your chips near it,

543
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:57,740
and sleeve that, and don't rifle shuffle this thing.

544
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,242
And it's just like, they're so precious

545
00:22:01,742 --> 00:22:02,943
when they're really pieces of cardboard.

546
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,205
Which I recognize, and I don't like take a game

547
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,807
and step on it just to prove a point and things like that.

548
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:11,308
Like I take care of my games as well.

549
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:12,789
There was a nice release.

550
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:16,590
for doing this. And this comes back, remember I talked about comic books, that was one of

551
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,571
the things I collected. And I put them in backs and sleeves because this was going to

552
00:22:19,611 --> 00:22:23,652
be my retirement fund in the 80s. Everyone's going to want, you know, the silver Wolverine

553
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:31,295
cover or whatever it is. And then I bought some, basically they were just fall off the

554
00:22:31,335 --> 00:22:35,396
back of a van comic books off a scruffy guy in New York City right after I graduated from

555
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:37,317
college. It was literally like, hey man, you want some comics?

556
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,482
10 bucks. And I'm like, sure, here you go.

557
00:22:39,502 --> 00:22:41,164
And they were already beat up.

558
00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:43,488
And I brought them back to my little New York apartment

559
00:22:43,568 --> 00:22:46,352
and I threw them everywhere and I stepped on them.

560
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:49,757
And it was this release of not having to take care of something.

561
00:22:49,777 --> 00:22:51,119
And it was really freeing.

562
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,302
So that was in my mind when I thought of this.

563
00:22:54,321 --> 00:22:55,422
So this has been probably,

564
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:57,983
especially the destruction of components,

565
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,966
the biggest sticking point on a lot of these legacy games.

566
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:03,486
A lot of people are very, very happy

567
00:23:03,526 --> 00:23:04,887
to go along with everything except that.

568
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:06,548
And if you've only tangentially heard of it,

569
00:23:06,568 --> 00:23:07,129
a lot of times it's like,

570
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,990
oh, that game where you rip up a card.

571
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,571
Cause it's just feels wrong.

572
00:23:12,092 --> 00:23:15,934
So I realized that there's a second covenant

573
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:17,014
that comes to board games

574
00:23:17,074 --> 00:23:20,537
and that they allow for consequence-free exploration.

575
00:23:21,328 --> 00:23:23,709
The whole point of a board game is probably most of us

576
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:25,690
really don't want to fight a war,

577
00:23:27,511 --> 00:23:31,913
or necessarily crush our enemies into the ground economically,

578
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:36,394
or be hunted by a serial killer, or a number of things

579
00:23:36,434 --> 00:23:37,415
that games can explore.

580
00:23:37,455 --> 00:23:39,856
Probably most of us also don't want to be bean farmers,

581
00:23:40,156 --> 00:23:41,396
for different reasons.

582
00:23:42,737 --> 00:23:44,938
So the theme of a game, it lets you basically

583
00:23:45,018 --> 00:23:48,119
try things that are conservative or radical.

584
00:23:49,703 --> 00:23:51,364
or just different, but the idea is that, you know,

585
00:23:51,524 --> 00:23:53,265
at the end of the game, it all goes back in the box

586
00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:54,105
and it didn't happen.

587
00:23:55,505 --> 00:23:56,986
So there's this covenant that you can play on,

588
00:23:57,006 --> 00:24:00,727
but this is kind of, there's a very, very other big,

589
00:24:00,827 --> 00:24:06,009
big, very successful branch of gaming called casinos.

590
00:24:07,288 --> 00:24:09,369
which play upon the exact opposite,

591
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:12,230
which is the thrill of making it matter.

592
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,611
So one of the thing I thought about is like,

593
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:16,092
well, poker's a very, very bad game

594
00:24:16,132 --> 00:24:18,252
unless you have stakes in the game

595
00:24:18,312 --> 00:24:20,893
that hurt just enough that you don't wanna lose them.

596
00:24:21,414 --> 00:24:23,714
You know, it's a game about money played with people

597
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,295
that happens to have cards on the table.

598
00:24:26,655 --> 00:24:28,796
And so I was like, can we kinda take some of this,

599
00:24:28,956 --> 00:24:30,177
can we break this covenant?

600
00:24:30,257 --> 00:24:31,397
Again, it wasn't this conscious.

601
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:33,078
And basically say, let's try it.

602
00:24:34,032 --> 00:24:35,093
let's put some skin in the game.

603
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:36,214
Here's a card, rip it up.

604
00:24:36,614 --> 00:24:37,655
Here's a decision you make.

605
00:24:37,695 --> 00:24:39,157
You can't take that decision back.

606
00:24:39,197 --> 00:24:42,199
Does that get the blood going or does it make people mad?

607
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:43,240
And I don't really have an answer,

608
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,662
but it was sort of exciting enough to give it a try.

609
00:24:46,263 --> 00:24:48,244
So I present all this stuff to Hasbro for Clue

610
00:24:48,364 --> 00:24:50,046
and they looked at me like I had lost my mind,

611
00:24:51,807 --> 00:24:52,448
which is fair.

612
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,092
So it went away again for like another year or six months.

613
00:24:57,172 --> 00:24:59,554
And then we're thinking about things doing for risk

614
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:00,494
and

615
00:25:02,082 --> 00:25:04,263
And I was like, well, you know, that idea might work for risks.

616
00:25:04,323 --> 00:25:06,605
And my boss and I talked, I was like, I think you should give it a try.

617
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:08,947
And it was one of many things we were going to do with risk and really kind of

618
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:12,330
dug into it and decided to start designing what became risk legacy.

619
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:18,174
Permanent change, putting stuff on the board, building factions, games,

620
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:18,795
carrying to the next.

621
00:25:18,855 --> 00:25:22,638
And so without getting too much into the like the nitty gritty design,

622
00:25:22,658 --> 00:25:24,539
you can ask about it after if you want more details.

623
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,041
Yeah, the tension was there.

624
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:31,694
People were really nervous about what's going to happen next and don't ruin this and oh

625
00:25:31,714 --> 00:25:34,438
this happened in the game and it's going to be there and it was sort of like hitting all

626
00:25:34,478 --> 00:25:36,600
these notes that I was hoping it would.

627
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:39,524
Then something magical happened which is cliffhangers.

628
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:42,889
Come back next week and see what happens.

629
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:44,791
It's like you get to the end of the game and people were like...

630
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,469
I wanna play this again

631
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:48,829
cause I wanna see what happens next.

632
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:50,329
And it was this, oh, there's a reason

633
00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:51,510
that you wanna play the game again.

634
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,030
The game finally spoke up and said,

635
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,311
here's a reason not to put me back in the closet.

636
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:56,591
Total accident.

637
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:59,452
But I was like, let's mine this for where it's worth.

638
00:25:59,472 --> 00:26:01,052
And then what happened with Risk Legacy is

639
00:26:01,232 --> 00:26:03,793
I just decided I was gonna give up most rational thought

640
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,073
of what a game was supposed to do.

641
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:08,934
And just any crazy idea I had, I put in there

642
00:26:08,954 --> 00:26:10,994
and we'll get to this craziest one in a little bit

643
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:11,794
that you probably know about.

644
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,035
So an interesting side effect is that games,

645
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,643
all games, almost all life experiences, you have the sense of

646
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:22,984
I don't know what I'm doing and then you have to gain mastery and there's this

647
00:26:23,064 --> 00:26:26,145
thrill of learning how to play a game and Eric Lang mentioned this yesterday on a

648
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:26,706
different panel, he's

649
00:26:27,006 --> 00:26:30,207
another game designer, that some of the most exciting parts of a game are

650
00:26:30,787 --> 00:26:33,848
the end of the first game into like game three or four where you know what's

651
00:26:33,888 --> 00:26:35,568
going on but you don't know how to do it well.

652
00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:40,562
And then everyone reaches a point where you've gained mastery and now you're sort of getting

653
00:26:40,602 --> 00:26:44,006
into like secondary and tertiary strategies and it's like comfort food.

654
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:48,572
But a lot of people, and part of the reason people don't go back to games again and again

655
00:26:48,612 --> 00:26:52,918
and again, especially now in the board game world, is you want to get that sort of hit

656
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:54,680
of the new and learned mastery.

657
00:26:55,977 --> 00:26:57,779
And this is Fischer random chess.

658
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:00,943
Bobby Fischer came up with, I'm not a chess expert,

659
00:27:00,983 --> 00:27:01,784
I'm not an expert on this,

660
00:27:01,824 --> 00:27:03,806
but he scrambles the pieces in the back row.

661
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:04,787
So there's certain rules.

662
00:27:04,887 --> 00:27:06,909
The king is always between the rooks,

663
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,732
black mirrors white, and there's a black and white bishop.

664
00:27:10,473 --> 00:27:12,195
Well, now you're in the mid-game from the first turn.

665
00:27:12,676 --> 00:27:14,057
You've just taken away the mastery

666
00:27:14,097 --> 00:27:15,419
of learning the opening moves to chess

667
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:16,820
because there is no more opening moves.

668
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:20,815
So it tests chess skill instead of chess knowledge.

669
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:23,817
And I thought, wow, if we just keep changing this game,

670
00:27:23,877 --> 00:27:25,577
we can kind of duplicate some of this

671
00:27:25,637 --> 00:27:29,179
and keep people in that first couple games,

672
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:31,700
the entire experience that they're playing.

673
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,501
So part of this is preventing people

674
00:27:34,581 --> 00:27:36,781
from ever feeling like they know how to play

675
00:27:36,842 --> 00:27:38,282
because whatever they did in the last game,

676
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:40,643
it's only 90% relevant to this game.

677
00:27:42,404 --> 00:27:43,704
And so that was a kind of fun thing.

678
00:27:43,724 --> 00:27:44,444
But then I made mistakes.

679
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,252
And the big mistake I made was everything was sort of random.

680
00:27:49,153 --> 00:27:52,836
Now, risk, I'm assuming most people here have played risk,

681
00:27:52,856 --> 00:27:54,617
and most people here don't play risk anymore.

682
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:00,481
Risk is, in some sense, sort of like this Skinner box

683
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:03,203
experience of how well people psychologically handle

684
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,144
the edge of the bell curve.

685
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:09,687
It's like there's no reason why you should have just lost all those troops, but you did.

686
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:14,509
And so one of the things I had was, you know, like you roll three sixes when you're attacking

687
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:21,031
and the area is destroyed in a giant nuclear devastation.

688
00:28:21,051 --> 00:28:23,532
And that sounded really cool because every die roll was tense.

689
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:27,091
Well, as a designer, I'd given up way too much control.

690
00:28:27,111 --> 00:28:28,652
That could happen the very first roll of the game.

691
00:28:28,812 --> 00:28:29,852
It might never happen.

692
00:28:29,872 --> 00:28:31,672
It might happen on the last roll or the same.

693
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:33,473
Like there was just not enough control

694
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:34,953
over when this happened.

695
00:28:35,373 --> 00:28:36,454
And I realized if you're gonna ask people

696
00:28:36,474 --> 00:28:37,934
to make permanent changes in a game,

697
00:28:38,294 --> 00:28:39,834
they should be the ones doing it.

698
00:28:39,854 --> 00:28:41,055
And that's one of the things

699
00:28:41,695 --> 00:28:43,815
that I've put in all the legacy games,

700
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:45,936
which is you may not understand what you just did,

701
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,612
You may not understand why you just did it,

702
00:28:48,712 --> 00:28:50,554
but in almost every single case,

703
00:28:50,614 --> 00:28:53,057
you were responsible or it was preventable,

704
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:55,119
or you had some sort of general under,

705
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:56,900
you were an agent of that.

706
00:28:57,181 --> 00:28:58,662
In Risk Legacy, you had full control.

707
00:28:58,962 --> 00:29:01,905
So, which is right here, which is, you know,

708
00:29:01,925 --> 00:29:04,188
you know, there was a sticker that's on a card

709
00:29:04,228 --> 00:29:06,049
and you choose when to put a sticker on a board.

710
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:09,833
And later on, you might really regret it, but you did it.

711
00:29:10,637 --> 00:29:12,498
So it's like actions have consequences.

712
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:14,820
And what I always wanted was when you look back at it,

713
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,462
it always makes sense in retrospect why that happened.

714
00:29:19,323 --> 00:29:20,904
So that leads to another covenant, which is,

715
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:24,167
board games, the designer always controls the materials.

716
00:29:24,927 --> 00:29:27,890
Here's the game, it's done, play with it.

717
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,511
They're never like, here's most of the game.

718
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:33,074
Here's a bunch of stickers, here's some plastic pieces.

719
00:29:33,174 --> 00:29:35,195
Just kind of put them together however you like

720
00:29:35,235 --> 00:29:36,036
and it'll all work out.

721
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:39,671
You have this trust as a player, which is,

722
00:29:40,451 --> 00:29:42,452
okay, you've done your job and my job is now

723
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:45,234
to enjoy your job, and what the legacy games do

724
00:29:45,294 --> 00:29:47,455
is they sort of stop 80% along the way

725
00:29:47,515 --> 00:29:50,917
and say I've done or we've done, if we're a co-designer,

726
00:29:51,477 --> 00:29:54,098
this much of the game, now together we're going

727
00:29:54,178 --> 00:29:55,499
to do the last part of the game.

728
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:59,541
You are now become like an unwilling co-designer

729
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:02,402
who has very limited knowledge of what you're designing.

730
00:30:03,587 --> 00:30:08,751
And I think that that's like, you know, it's exhilarating to some people in every gamer as a game designer.

731
00:30:09,532 --> 00:30:13,735
So, you know, you get to sort of get in and put your fingerprint on things,

732
00:30:13,755 --> 00:30:15,957
and it's just basically like permission to make house rules.

733
00:30:19,143 --> 00:30:21,084
But the downside to the giving people all these cards

734
00:30:21,784 --> 00:30:23,845
is because it was so new and because it was so powerful

735
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:24,866
and because it was so different,

736
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:27,767
it was like giving matches to a toddler

737
00:30:28,347 --> 00:30:30,168
in the sense that I would give out 10 stickers

738
00:30:30,188 --> 00:30:32,489
and they'd be gone within the first two turns of the game.

739
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:33,490
Like, well, I'm gonna do this,

740
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,750
well, I'm gonna do this, well, I'm gonna do that.

741
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,771
And then you get to the second game

742
00:30:35,811 --> 00:30:37,852
and you have this incredible hangover of why'd we do that?

743
00:30:37,872 --> 00:30:39,072
There's nothing fun left to do

744
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:40,953
and we've made a mess of our board.

745
00:30:41,954 --> 00:30:43,294
So I was like, well, I can't give them

746
00:30:43,454 --> 00:30:44,555
all the materials right now.

747
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:46,496
I need to wait and say like, here's a couple things,

748
00:30:46,796 --> 00:30:47,856
learn how to use your tools.

749
00:30:49,045 --> 00:30:50,886
play for a while, integrate those,

750
00:30:51,006 --> 00:30:53,628
and now here's some new tools.

751
00:30:53,648 --> 00:30:56,570
And I'm like, well, I gotta put them in a box or something

752
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,210
or lock them up.

753
00:30:58,571 --> 00:31:00,532
And which led to the second big moment,

754
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,173
which is these secondary goals.

755
00:31:03,213 --> 00:31:05,214
And the box lid was deliberately designed to be open

756
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:05,935
so you could see them.

757
00:31:05,955 --> 00:31:07,315
And I'm like, well, this is cool.

758
00:31:07,335 --> 00:31:08,876
There's a chance for some narrative here, right?

759
00:31:08,896 --> 00:31:10,537
Instead of saying open this at the end of game three,

760
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:14,399
it's like open this, you know, one of them is when,

761
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:15,560
I'm trying to think what the exact thing is,

762
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,221
when one person, when a person wins for the second time.

763
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:21,214
And so I could do the math and be like, well, that's not going to be game one.

764
00:31:22,074 --> 00:31:25,635
And in a five-player game, it might be like all the way to game nine or

765
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,395
something like that.

766
00:31:26,435 --> 00:31:28,156
But most of the time, it would be like game three or four.

767
00:31:28,216 --> 00:31:31,357
So it gave me enough control as a designer to figure out, here's when

768
00:31:31,397 --> 00:31:31,977
stuff comes out.

769
00:31:33,257 --> 00:31:35,138
And I was like, this is neat.

770
00:31:35,178 --> 00:31:37,739
This is just like, if you play a game and people go like, here's the

771
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:40,019
beginner rules, the intermediate rules, and the advanced rules.

772
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:41,240
And you're like, OK.

773
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:44,930
I'm really cool, I'm gonna start with the advanced rules

774
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,451
and then you play it.

775
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:47,132
And you're like, this game's hard, I don't like it.

776
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,994
But you know, it's like, I just took that and sort of,

777
00:31:50,014 --> 00:31:51,555
it was kind of the reverse thing.

778
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:52,976
Instead of saying, I'm gonna give you that choice,

779
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:54,337
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna leave it here.

780
00:31:54,357 --> 00:31:55,857
I'm gonna make you play the beginner game

781
00:31:55,978 --> 00:31:59,140
and then you earn your way to the intermediate game,

782
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,981
but you earn it in a thematic way.

783
00:32:01,521 --> 00:32:03,062
And I have seen with these legacy games,

784
00:32:03,242 --> 00:32:05,944
totally unexpected side effect is people are like,

785
00:32:06,064 --> 00:32:08,125
open a pack and they're like, oh, new rules!

786
00:32:08,686 --> 00:32:10,727
No one gets excited about rules.

787
00:32:12,225 --> 00:32:15,808
That just doesn't happen, but I'm like, wait, wait, wait, wait.

788
00:32:15,989 --> 00:32:16,769
Oh, wow, right?

789
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,991
Like you're drawn into this thing.

790
00:32:19,051 --> 00:32:20,953
So it's just a matter of opening something.

791
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:22,915
So in my mind, I'm like, well, that kind of works,

792
00:32:22,935 --> 00:32:23,835
because sometimes you're playing a game,

793
00:32:23,855 --> 00:32:25,457
and the game doesn't work out, and you're not winning.

794
00:32:25,517 --> 00:32:27,999
And you can look over there, like, well, I'm not winning,

795
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:31,021
but maybe I can do one of those things, and sort of feel like.

796
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:34,084
And so I'm like, OK, this is how I had it in my head.

797
00:32:34,124 --> 00:32:35,345
This is how this works.

798
00:32:35,405 --> 00:32:36,846
I'm like, that's cool.

799
00:32:36,887 --> 00:32:38,808
I provided sort of secondary features to that.

800
00:32:39,948 --> 00:32:41,808
Huge misunderstanding on my part,

801
00:32:41,848 --> 00:32:43,488
because the rest of the world saw it as this.

802
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,149
What's in there?

803
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:49,110
How do I get to it?

804
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,490
How fast do I get to it?

805
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,410
When does this happen?

806
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,430
Why don't you and I work together?

807
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,931
I'll lose so you can win, just so we can open that thing.

808
00:32:59,632 --> 00:33:01,412
And so that's when I learned the power

809
00:33:01,452 --> 00:33:03,532
of anticipation and the unknown.

810
00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:05,993
This was not until the game came out

811
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:08,153
that I really got a sense that, for me,

812
00:33:08,213 --> 00:33:09,693
what had been, again, sort of like.

813
00:33:10,124 --> 00:33:12,686
the permanence was a way to make the game trackable.

814
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,888
The locked up content was to make the game

815
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,609
that you didn't abuse the game

816
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,511
with the first part that I made permanent.

817
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:21,813
And it's only in retrospect and I'm like,

818
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,654
oh yeah, it was this total narrative thing

819
00:33:23,694 --> 00:33:26,476
that I was doing and the power of foreshadowing

820
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:27,237
and everything like that.

821
00:33:28,618 --> 00:33:30,539
So but once I kind of realized like this is the,

822
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,502
this is the sticker that closes the risk legacy box.

823
00:33:33,522 --> 00:33:34,623
I'm like, well, like I said,

824
00:33:34,663 --> 00:33:35,663
now I'm just gonna do whatever.

825
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:38,766
I'm gonna put a note on there and make it a ritual.

826
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,489
and you have to cut it and then you're breaking the seal

827
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:42,369
on something like that.

828
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,351
Then there's another covenant that kind of comes in here,

829
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:48,091
which is game's gonna tell you everything that's in the box.

830
00:33:49,932 --> 00:33:51,313
Hasbro is a big corporation.

831
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:54,514
It's got a lot of layers of lawyers and safeties and checks.

832
00:33:54,974 --> 00:33:56,455
So the meetings I had in where they're like,

833
00:33:56,475 --> 00:33:58,435
well, we need to put the box contents on the outside.

834
00:33:58,455 --> 00:33:59,376
I'm like, well, you can't.

835
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:02,837
Those were some interesting meetings.

836
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:04,498
There were two meetings that I had many times.

837
00:34:04,618 --> 00:34:07,179
One is making sure they, I'm like, can we say and more?

838
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:08,479
Can we say at least?

839
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,524
we say and and and like old again they want to things that they rise had to be

840
00:34:12,564 --> 00:34:15,147
in there did not have to be in there they were just customs they were lost

841
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:15,708
the other one was

842
00:34:16,328 --> 00:34:18,931
least three times i'd be in a meeting in some production present like out

843
00:34:19,511 --> 00:34:22,314
you would uh... you'd mark the stickers a permanent but i i switched it so you

844
00:34:22,334 --> 00:34:25,117
could kill moffitt remove them because you know i know i was permanently

845
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,440
yet that means you you can't pick them up again a minute

846
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:29,170
but you don't want that.

847
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:29,630
Yes, I do.

848
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:30,331
Right?

849
00:34:30,391 --> 00:34:31,572
And then three months later,

850
00:34:31,752 --> 00:34:32,733
some other person would be like,

851
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:34,615
hey, we noticed you had put permanent stickers,

852
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:35,596
so we made them repeal.

853
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:37,058
I'm like, no, nope.

854
00:34:37,438 --> 00:34:39,600
I want them to be where even if you accidentally

855
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,362
put the corner on something, like that's it.

856
00:34:41,402 --> 00:34:42,864
Like it's gonna be there

857
00:34:42,884 --> 00:34:44,065
or you're gonna rip off your board.

858
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:47,308
But so this is another covenant.

859
00:34:47,348 --> 00:34:48,710
It's like when you buy a board game.

860
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:51,532
we're telling you what's in the box,

861
00:34:51,552 --> 00:34:52,512
we're telling you here's the rules,

862
00:34:52,572 --> 00:34:53,893
here's the factions, here's what you get.

863
00:34:53,953 --> 00:34:54,833
You can look on the bottom,

864
00:34:54,853 --> 00:34:56,474
and then when you open the rule book at the beginning,

865
00:34:57,134 --> 00:34:59,995
you can just kind of go down,

866
00:35:00,055 --> 00:35:01,956
and some people just do it as an accounting

867
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,957
to make sure that they got everything they were supposed to

868
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:04,857
and there wasn't a production error.

869
00:35:04,877 --> 00:35:06,638
Some people like to get their head around the project,

870
00:35:06,678 --> 00:35:07,898
and so I'm like, no, I'm not gonna tell you.

871
00:35:08,659 --> 00:35:10,379
There's a whole bunch of stuff in sealed boxes,

872
00:35:10,439 --> 00:35:11,880
and hopefully we produced it right.

873
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,321
Sometimes we don't.

874
00:35:15,061 --> 00:35:16,702
CFAL's fun because I've seen people,

875
00:35:16,762 --> 00:35:17,922
there's a battery warning,

876
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:19,803
which you are required to put on.

877
00:35:22,516 --> 00:35:25,318
Nothing with batteries that you'll see for.

878
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:29,481
So then it led to very quickly to,

879
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:31,402
well, if I'm not telling you everything,

880
00:35:31,442 --> 00:35:32,603
am I telling you the truth?

881
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:34,844
There's a certain amount of trust

882
00:35:34,865 --> 00:35:37,246
that I as a game designer am being truthful with you,

883
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:41,549
and I break this covenant every Legacy game that I do.

884
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,092
It's just like an author, it's narrative surprise.

885
00:35:46,293 --> 00:35:50,536
And I'm like, okay, well, how can we really use this?

886
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:53,269
And that's when I did this idea.

887
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,931
I don't know if all of you know about this.

888
00:35:56,232 --> 00:35:57,853
It still continues to entertain me.

889
00:35:58,274 --> 00:35:59,194
What I realized is.

890
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:02,649
people aren't gonna wanna rip up a card.

891
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:06,290
And the first thing that Risk Legacy asks you to do

892
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,610
is take out a card with two stickers on it,

893
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,491
apply one sticker to the faction you're playing

894
00:36:10,511 --> 00:36:13,411
and then rip up the card that contains the other sticker.

895
00:36:13,431 --> 00:36:15,352
Like the first thing is A or B,

896
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,132
and you can't go back and it's being torn up.

897
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,653
And what I wanted was the people go, nope,

898
00:36:20,193 --> 00:36:21,113
and just quit right there.

899
00:36:21,153 --> 00:36:22,234
Like don't torture them.

900
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,974
Like I just like, it's this little litmus test

901
00:36:25,014 --> 00:36:26,195
of whether you're up for this.

902
00:36:27,495 --> 00:36:29,035
But I also realized that everyone's gonna go,

903
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:31,442
I'm not gonna rip it up.

904
00:36:32,103 --> 00:36:35,506
There's this big black plastic vacuum form tray in the box.

905
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,248
And you're like, eh, there's no real way to put this.

906
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:38,730
I know, I'll put it under the tray.

907
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:42,493
And when you pick up the tray, that is taped to the bottom.

908
00:36:44,915 --> 00:36:46,057
Some people find it right away.

909
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,239
Some people don't find it until they played 15 games

910
00:36:48,279 --> 00:36:49,880
because that tray's in there tight.

911
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,264
So basically it was a way to torture people

912
00:36:53,864 --> 00:36:54,945
who were meticulous.

913
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:04,766
And I had joked around at first that I was going to put in an envelope that said,

914
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:07,609
do not open until instructed and then never instruct them.

915
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:13,354
So to be fair, I am nicer than I threatened to be.

916
00:37:13,374 --> 00:37:19,760
And there's been a whole fascinating bits of psychology here around.

917
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:23,827
groups finding this and then spontaneously again,

918
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,248
I've given creative control over them,

919
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:27,029
house ruling how they're gonna,

920
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:28,449
we'll do it after everyone wins once,

921
00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:29,670
we'll do it after eight games,

922
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,391
we'll do it after Bill finally wins

923
00:37:32,411 --> 00:37:34,392
because he hasn't won, we won't open it all,

924
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:35,472
we'll open it right now.

925
00:37:37,073 --> 00:37:38,874
And just to make sure that no one could find out

926
00:37:38,894 --> 00:37:41,455
what it was, there are four random packets at the bottom.

927
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:46,257
Two are bad for everyone, just messes up your world.

928
00:37:47,257 --> 00:37:48,598
One is bad only for the people

929
00:37:48,638 --> 00:37:49,878
who were there when it's opened.

930
00:37:50,963 --> 00:37:53,604
And one is only good if you're there when it's opened.

931
00:37:54,825 --> 00:37:56,385
Because even if you wanted to Google it,

932
00:37:57,385 --> 00:37:58,826
you wouldn't have an answer of whether you

933
00:37:58,866 --> 00:37:59,846
wanted to be there or not.

934
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:07,168
So then people open it, and it's more often than not bad.

935
00:38:08,688 --> 00:38:10,009
And then something very interesting

936
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:11,309
happens with the psychology.

937
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,290
They integrate these rules into the game

938
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,711
and play with this bad expansion.

939
00:38:19,594 --> 00:38:21,555
because they opened something they shouldn't.

940
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:27,199
There is no reason why they have to, right?

941
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:30,641
If you're playing a game and you are like,

942
00:38:30,661 --> 00:38:32,162
someone's like, do you want to play with this expansion?

943
00:38:32,182 --> 00:38:33,863
Like, I don't like it, it's kind of a downbeat.

944
00:38:33,883 --> 00:38:35,263
You're like, okay, cool, we'll leave it out.

945
00:38:35,484 --> 00:38:37,445
I just gave you an expansion and you're like,

946
00:38:37,605 --> 00:38:40,086
pah, well, we got to do it.

947
00:38:45,193 --> 00:38:45,834
And then they do.

948
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:47,295
And then people get mad at me.

949
00:38:47,315 --> 00:38:49,196
It's like, I opened this envelope that you told me not to

950
00:38:49,256 --> 00:38:50,417
and it was bad and you're a jerk.

951
00:38:50,457 --> 00:38:50,837
And I'm like.

952
00:38:50,857 --> 00:38:53,499
Okay.

953
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,702
So I haven't done anything that crazy since then,

954
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,763
but that is one of the more enjoyable moments

955
00:38:59,803 --> 00:39:01,104
of my professional career.

956
00:39:04,647 --> 00:39:07,408
Actually, so I was at a game convention last year,

957
00:39:07,448 --> 00:39:08,869
and someone was auctioning away one of these,

958
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:11,069
and the people doing the auction asked me to open the box

959
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:13,410
and change one component, so that when they found it,

960
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,471
they had a customized version.

961
00:39:14,491 --> 00:39:15,771
And because it was a last-minute request,

962
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:16,931
and I panicked, I didn't know what to do,

963
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,012
so I opened up that envelope,

964
00:39:18,352 --> 00:39:19,632
and then put my cell phone number,

965
00:39:19,652 --> 00:39:22,093
and said, text this to this cell phone when you open it.

966
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:25,895
Figuring I'd have this wonderful plan when they texted me.

967
00:39:25,935 --> 00:39:27,495
So nine months later, when someone texts me,

968
00:39:27,535 --> 00:39:31,256
and I'm like, Unpub 27, what does that mean?

969
00:39:32,565 --> 00:39:35,086
And I'm like, oh, I was supposed to think of something.

970
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:41,990
So I'm like, are you playing now?

971
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:42,970
They're like, yeah, we're playing.

972
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:43,510
We're in the middle.

973
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,011
We're waiting.

974
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:48,473
Okay.

975
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:48,853
One sec.

976
00:39:50,862 --> 00:39:54,463
And luckily I just came up with an idea that I was running,

977
00:39:55,023 --> 00:39:58,244
I was a secret scientific bunker running,

978
00:39:58,984 --> 00:40:01,044
teleporting portals between places

979
00:40:01,064 --> 00:40:03,004
and they could text this number for the next two hours

980
00:40:03,044 --> 00:40:05,345
and I would open up two random portals.

981
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:08,185
But if they went through, something good might happen

982
00:40:08,225 --> 00:40:09,226
or something bad might happen,

983
00:40:09,246 --> 00:40:10,666
but they could get their jump on their enemy.

984
00:40:10,686 --> 00:40:12,386
And they were so excited, like, we need a portal.

985
00:40:12,686 --> 00:40:13,386
Actually, no, they would do it.

986
00:40:13,406 --> 00:40:15,607
We need a portal between Brazil and France,

987
00:40:15,627 --> 00:40:16,487
like coming online.

988
00:40:16,507 --> 00:40:18,387
And then I would literally roll percentile dice.

989
00:40:20,272 --> 00:40:22,013
Oh, sorry, you lost three troops on the way.

990
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:23,293
And we had a great time.

991
00:40:23,513 --> 00:40:24,634
And then we shut the portal down.

992
00:40:25,374 --> 00:40:26,294
Actually, it worked out really well.

993
00:40:26,314 --> 00:40:29,395
At the end of that game, they opened up another envelope,

994
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:33,317
which opened up this like really big, dramatic point

995
00:40:33,357 --> 00:40:35,617
with this like big new bad guy in this dramatic twist.

996
00:40:35,638 --> 00:40:38,178
And I was like, they've tapped into our signal.

997
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:40,279
I'm sorry we helped cause this.

998
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:41,520
Signing off.

999
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,180
And then just didn't answer any more of their texts.

1000
00:40:47,021 --> 00:40:47,321
Thank you.

1001
00:40:52,594 --> 00:40:55,055
So these are some of the covenants and where there's a little bit more to talk

1002
00:40:55,075 --> 00:40:57,876
about but these are some of the covenants I broke with with risk legacy

1003
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:58,616
and ultimately

1004
00:40:59,596 --> 00:41:02,637
it ended up here where the players were in the control of sort of these spokes

1005
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:05,018
which were these different packets in the sandbox play

1006
00:41:05,758 --> 00:41:08,159
which is meant to be open in nearly any order.

1007
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:10,420
I think it's possible to actually open them in

1008
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,801
almost every order or every order.

1009
00:41:13,101 --> 00:41:16,642
And then you get to 15 games and then it's just the ending was like you're done.

1010
00:41:16,962 --> 00:41:18,783
It doesn't lead to any sort of climax like

1011
00:41:18,823 --> 00:41:19,723
15 games thank you for playing.

1012
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:22,971
And so it sort of looks like this,

1013
00:41:23,011 --> 00:41:25,392
and it came out and I expected it to,

1014
00:41:26,532 --> 00:41:29,093
I had like no F's to give at this point

1015
00:41:29,113 --> 00:41:30,553
because Hasbro had moved my job

1016
00:41:30,594 --> 00:41:32,374
and I knew I was leaving Hasbro.

1017
00:41:32,394 --> 00:41:34,515
And I'm like, I don't think I can make it on my own.

1018
00:41:34,555 --> 00:41:36,295
I'm probably gonna have to find a different career.

1019
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:37,135
It was a good run.

1020
00:41:38,676 --> 00:41:40,656
Let's just do something crazy on the way out the door

1021
00:41:40,696 --> 00:41:41,636
just to see what happens.

1022
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:43,317
I don't get royalties from it.

1023
00:41:43,357 --> 00:41:44,017
I don't own a piece.

1024
00:41:44,237 --> 00:41:45,557
If it failed, I didn't make less money.

1025
00:41:45,577 --> 00:41:46,778
There was no business thought in it.

1026
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:47,978
I'm like, I saw eight copies.

1027
00:41:48,018 --> 00:41:48,558
This will be fun.

1028
00:41:49,844 --> 00:41:53,886
So I was really thrilled when it was received very, very well.

1029
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:56,967
So I set out and I'm on my own and I'm like,

1030
00:41:57,647 --> 00:41:58,768
okay, I'm gonna do another one.

1031
00:41:58,788 --> 00:41:59,728
And what became C-Fall.

1032
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:02,889
And I had 14 years of doing kids games and I'm like,

1033
00:42:02,969 --> 00:42:05,531
I'm gonna make the biggest thing that's ever been made ever.

1034
00:42:07,571 --> 00:42:08,232
Yeah.

1035
00:42:08,912 --> 00:42:11,173
So I wanted to do like longer play time

1036
00:42:11,213 --> 00:42:12,613
and more narrative and more unknown.

1037
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:13,974
I'm like, oh, you want Christmas presents?

1038
00:42:14,014 --> 00:42:15,815
I'm gonna give you an empty board.

1039
00:42:16,295 --> 00:42:16,975
How's that?

1040
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,556
And you're gonna explore it and do stuff.

1041
00:42:19,712 --> 00:42:20,813
And then it took three years.

1042
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:22,234
But we'll get back to it.

1043
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:23,115
It's called foreshadowing.

1044
00:42:24,957 --> 00:42:26,658
So in the meantime, Matt Leacock comes up to me

1045
00:42:26,698 --> 00:42:29,781
and he's like, hey, let's take this idea for pandemic.

1046
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:32,243
And I'm like, I don't think it's gonna work as a co-op, man.

1047
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:37,008
Sorry, but let's give it a try.

1048
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:40,591
So we sat down and we did a whole talk on this yesterday.

1049
00:42:40,931 --> 00:42:42,533
So I'm not gonna get into in detail here

1050
00:42:42,873 --> 00:42:43,734
because you can find it.

1051
00:42:45,506 --> 00:42:46,066
online after.

1052
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:47,807
But one of the first things we did is like,

1053
00:42:47,847 --> 00:42:49,108
well, we want more of a story.

1054
00:42:49,388 --> 00:42:50,548
We want more of a movie feel.

1055
00:42:50,608 --> 00:42:53,030
So we came up with something completely radical.

1056
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,090
Feel free to take pictures.

1057
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,531
It's called a three act structure.

1058
00:42:58,972 --> 00:43:00,573
We created a timeline of months

1059
00:43:00,653 --> 00:43:02,414
and we did upbeats and downbeats.

1060
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:05,455
And we ended up basically taking this sort of free form

1061
00:43:05,515 --> 00:43:06,976
sandbox thing that'd be done in risk.

1062
00:43:07,016 --> 00:43:08,857
And we turn it into a tightly scripted legacy deck

1063
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:09,918
where you start with card one

1064
00:43:10,618 --> 00:43:12,359
and we go through and you get to card,

1065
00:43:12,379 --> 00:43:14,500
I think it's 60 or something in season one.

1066
00:43:15,146 --> 00:43:17,168
And along the way, like we are presenting

1067
00:43:17,188 --> 00:43:20,971
a fairly linear narrative that you get to sort of wobble

1068
00:43:21,251 --> 00:43:22,052
in different places.

1069
00:43:22,112 --> 00:43:23,513
But if you played Pandemic Legacy

1070
00:43:23,554 --> 00:43:25,055
and we had a little breakout session here,

1071
00:43:25,816 --> 00:43:27,777
most of you would have similar experiences,

1072
00:43:27,817 --> 00:43:30,179
but you might say like, oh no, we never use that character.

1073
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,181
Or for us, Europe was more problematic.

1074
00:43:32,201 --> 00:43:33,282
For us, it was South America.

1075
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:35,084
But so you're having your own experience,

1076
00:43:35,124 --> 00:43:37,946
but it's within the, it's starting.

1077
00:43:40,665 --> 00:43:44,928
But the big question we had to do, and this is for people who are interested in doing legacy games,

1078
00:43:44,948 --> 00:43:48,610
a little bit of a design sidebar now, we're getting away from Covenants and design things,

1079
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:51,271
is, uh, is...

1080
00:43:52,612 --> 00:43:55,574
You as a designer have less and less control the longer the games go.

1081
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:56,715
Like, people are like, why is it 15?

1082
00:43:56,835 --> 00:43:59,016
And for us, I'm like, well, because that's a pretty big commitment already.

1083
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:00,837
And I've had two people ask me this weekend,

1084
00:44:00,857 --> 00:44:03,579
I'm like, can we have like a six pack legacy game experience,

1085
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,640
just like a long weekend.

1086
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,521
And I'm like, okay, two separate people asked me,

1087
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:07,861
so I'll think about it.

1088
00:44:07,901 --> 00:44:09,562
But 15 felt like you got your money's worth,

1089
00:44:10,363 --> 00:44:12,024
but it's sort of capped because I felt like

1090
00:44:12,044 --> 00:44:13,885
people weren't gonna wanna play after a certain point.

1091
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:17,427
And the design cone of where the game was gonna go

1092
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:19,168
was gonna get so wide that as a designer,

1093
00:44:19,248 --> 00:44:21,389
I was gonna have no idea if the game broke.

1094
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:23,190
Like it will break eventually

1095
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,311
if you give people the ability to keep changing it.

1096
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:30,273
But what happened in Risk and what happens in Seafall is it's a competitive game,

1097
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:35,500
so I'm relying on the players, again, unwitting co-designers to keep the game balance

1098
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,344
by beating up on the leader.

1099
00:44:39,085 --> 00:44:41,268
Well, you don't have that in a co-op game, right?

1100
00:44:41,288 --> 00:44:43,451
So in a co-op game, you're like...

1101
00:44:44,354 --> 00:44:46,575
Matt and I just had these fears of literally the game just

1102
00:44:46,876 --> 00:44:48,656
kicking the players in the fetal position,

1103
00:44:48,697 --> 00:44:51,758
like game after game after game, and losing leading to losing,

1104
00:44:51,798 --> 00:44:52,839
and winning leading to winning.

1105
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:55,740
And we get into this in more detail in our talk.

1106
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:58,682
But basically, you need to, if you're designing,

1107
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:02,524
have some way where losing doesn't lead to more losing,

1108
00:45:03,124 --> 00:45:04,885
and winning doesn't lead to more winning,

1109
00:45:05,085 --> 00:45:06,306
but winning is always better.

1110
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,448
And so there's a series of weird incentives.

1111
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:12,189
And what we did was something called funding.

1112
00:45:13,004 --> 00:45:15,465
In Pandemic Legacy, most of you probably know this,

1113
00:45:16,366 --> 00:45:17,246
but there are event cards.

1114
00:45:17,286 --> 00:45:18,987
Event cards are good because they give you actions

1115
00:45:19,047 --> 00:45:20,767
and they pad a deck to give you more time.

1116
00:45:20,807 --> 00:45:22,348
So every time you win in Pandemic Legacy,

1117
00:45:22,388 --> 00:45:23,409
we took two cards away.

1118
00:45:23,869 --> 00:45:26,150
And every time you lost, we gave you two extra cards

1119
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,191
so that you could stay in this zone.

1120
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,443
Also, this is important in a co-op game.

1121
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:33,484
There's a safety net.

1122
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:36,667
When we were play testing and people would win, sorry, lose,

1123
00:45:37,287 --> 00:45:39,530
I had some friends lose first game in January,

1124
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,412
second game in January, first game in February.

1125
00:45:41,432 --> 00:45:42,813
And they said, well, we're your friends,

1126
00:45:43,353 --> 00:45:45,315
and we'll keep playing, testing this if you ask,

1127
00:45:45,335 --> 00:45:47,037
but we're pretty sure that we would throw this away

1128
00:45:47,057 --> 00:45:47,998
because we broke the game.

1129
00:45:48,018 --> 00:45:49,380
I'm like, no, you didn't.

1130
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,901
They're like, we just lost the first three.

1131
00:45:50,921 --> 00:45:52,042
There's no way we're coming back.

1132
00:45:52,443 --> 00:45:53,864
And we kept playing and they kept going.

1133
00:45:54,495 --> 00:45:57,118
and they had a good time and Matt and I were talking about it and we realized

1134
00:45:57,858 --> 00:46:02,282
we put this box in that says open if you lose four games in a row and all this

1135
00:46:02,322 --> 00:46:07,146
does is provide a psychological anchor of you are doing fine until you lose

1136
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:09,848
four games in a row. Now if you lose four games in a row

1137
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:12,650
there's stuff in there that will help you but basically if you're like we lost

1138
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,452
the game like that happens you lost two games like

1139
00:46:14,732 --> 00:46:17,574
okay we lost three games this is horrible now at least we didn't lose

1140
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:17,974
four

1141
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,802
If four, we'd be in trouble, but if we lose four,

1142
00:46:23,523 --> 00:46:24,523
we get what's in that box.

1143
00:46:24,563 --> 00:46:26,885
And they're like, okay, let's keep going then.

1144
00:46:26,945 --> 00:46:29,367
And until we let them know when they should panic,

1145
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:32,529
they would panic after two losses or after three losses.

1146
00:46:32,549 --> 00:46:33,910
So all this does is sort of say like,

1147
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:35,851
I know I'm gonna lie to you.

1148
00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:36,872
I know I'm gonna trick you.

1149
00:46:36,932 --> 00:46:38,433
I know I'm gonna do unexpected things,

1150
00:46:38,893 --> 00:46:41,495
but really, honestly, we want you to have a good time

1151
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,276
and we got your back if things get bad.

1152
00:46:44,957 --> 00:46:46,978
And so that became a pandemic legacy.

1153
00:46:46,998 --> 00:46:49,600
Some takeaways from there is a linear story can work.

1154
00:46:51,772 --> 00:46:54,293
Cooperative can work and in fact, maybe even better

1155
00:46:54,793 --> 00:46:57,174
because you all integrate and learn new rules together

1156
00:46:57,234 --> 00:46:59,135
and you can think through and as you open things,

1157
00:46:59,195 --> 00:47:01,095
it's not like one person is better at figuring out

1158
00:47:01,115 --> 00:47:02,136
how to use this new tool.

1159
00:47:03,396 --> 00:47:05,737
And timed unlocks can work, whereas Risk Legacy,

1160
00:47:05,757 --> 00:47:07,378
you sort of chose how things happen.

1161
00:47:07,418 --> 00:47:08,958
For the most part in pandemic, we're like,

1162
00:47:09,218 --> 00:47:10,399
here's your next bit of content.

1163
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,120
Now we've heard criticisms that it's a little too railroady,

1164
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,380
but people enjoyed it.

1165
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,701
So in season two, there's a little more creative choice.

1166
00:47:19,759 --> 00:47:22,900
So let's go back to C fall and I realize I'm I'm talking too much I want to get

1167
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,461
the questions it got big and it stayed shaggy and it got some mixed reviews,

1168
00:47:27,701 --> 00:47:30,422
although now I've seen later reviews and later people playing is I think the

1169
00:47:30,442 --> 00:47:34,703
people who I wanted to have play it are finding it I think a lot of people who

1170
00:47:34,743 --> 00:47:38,224
played earlier people would play pandemic legacy and expected this to be

1171
00:47:38,264 --> 00:47:42,165
like a season 2 but it's a much heavier game it was designed to be but it is

1172
00:47:42,245 --> 00:47:43,346
because it was a heavier game.

1173
00:47:44,971 --> 00:47:47,271
There's some things, longer play time discourages binge play.

1174
00:47:47,311 --> 00:47:50,032
I think with risk and pandemic, they're 45 minutes to an hour.

1175
00:47:50,092 --> 00:47:51,613
You get done and you say, let's play again.

1176
00:47:52,153 --> 00:47:53,333
Seafall can be two hours.

1177
00:47:53,353 --> 00:47:54,433
You don't say, let's play again.

1178
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,874
And then mentally, when people are like,

1179
00:47:55,894 --> 00:47:56,734
do you want to play another game?

1180
00:47:56,754 --> 00:47:59,375
You might be like, I don't know if we have time tonight.

1181
00:47:59,655 --> 00:48:01,936
Right, so with this game where I'm giving you reasons

1182
00:48:01,956 --> 00:48:03,076
to play again and again and again,

1183
00:48:03,096 --> 00:48:04,156
one of the things I need to give you

1184
00:48:04,237 --> 00:48:06,217
is a quick, cleaner experience.

1185
00:48:09,032 --> 00:48:11,093
The rules start heavier and ramp up more,

1186
00:48:11,694 --> 00:48:14,436
which means the early games need to be more of a tutorial.

1187
00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:15,556
They need to be handled.

1188
00:48:15,596 --> 00:48:16,777
I had to take a lot of rules out,

1189
00:48:16,817 --> 00:48:18,018
which made some of the early games like,

1190
00:48:18,038 --> 00:48:19,259
ah, this is a little flat.

1191
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,821
And then you open up some stuff and you're like,

1192
00:48:22,161 --> 00:48:23,422
oh, this is where the game gets good,

1193
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,403
which is where I had started it,

1194
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,544
but then people were confused.

1195
00:48:25,584 --> 00:48:27,665
So moving the whole complexity scale up

1196
00:48:28,066 --> 00:48:30,588
leads to a lot of issues in those early games,

1197
00:48:30,628 --> 00:48:32,489
which get compounded by a longer play time.

1198
00:48:32,929 --> 00:48:34,850
But I will tell you, there's some really cool stuff in there.

1199
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:39,192
So if you're into like a big, sprawling, Lord of the Rings,

1200
00:48:39,872 --> 00:48:42,193
D&D campaign sort of longer thing,

1201
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:44,694
I think there's a lot of fantastic stuff in there.

1202
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:45,675
And I'm very happy with it.

1203
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:48,136
It just didn't meet the expectations

1204
00:48:48,156 --> 00:48:49,877
that had been set with the first two games that had come out.

1205
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:53,228
So other people have jumped into this pool.

1206
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:56,932
So going downstream, right after Risk Legacy came out,

1207
00:48:56,972 --> 00:48:58,474
the Pathfinder Adventure card game,

1208
00:48:58,754 --> 00:49:00,055
sorry, I should say card game on there,

1209
00:49:01,537 --> 00:49:03,299
it came out and Mike Selinker, the designer,

1210
00:49:03,339 --> 00:49:04,660
said he had played Risk Legacy.

1211
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,362
He's like, oh, that's cool, we're allowed to do that now?

1212
00:49:07,023 --> 00:49:08,745
All right, you can make things change

1213
00:49:08,785 --> 00:49:10,347
and continue and create campaigns, cool.

1214
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:12,089
And then he went off and did this.

1215
00:49:14,105 --> 00:49:16,406
There's this game that just came out now called Gloomhaven.

1216
00:49:17,006 --> 00:49:19,507
That is not two boxes stacked together.

1217
00:49:19,547 --> 00:49:22,789
That is the Gloomhaven box, which I was going to bring out

1218
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:23,869
and play with some friends out here

1219
00:49:23,889 --> 00:49:25,710
until I realized it was the suitcase.

1220
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:28,191
Like, I mean, it's huge.

1221
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:28,951
It's a big map.

1222
00:49:29,031 --> 00:49:31,052
It's a tactical dungeon crawling thing

1223
00:49:31,072 --> 00:49:32,293
with branching characters

1224
00:49:32,313 --> 00:49:33,553
and all these little boxes in there.

1225
00:49:35,834 --> 00:49:38,676
And Mechs vs. Minions is a board game

1226
00:49:38,696 --> 00:49:40,436
that came out from Riot last year.

1227
00:49:43,088 --> 00:49:46,430
which has like a box with a miniature in it and a campaign play.

1228
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,191
And then even a card game called Fabled Fruit.

1229
00:49:49,631 --> 00:49:51,672
What most of the games I just went through

1230
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:55,714
are doing though is they took that second moment, the aha moment where I said,

1231
00:49:55,734 --> 00:49:57,534
oh, there's going to be narrative contents locked up.

1232
00:49:58,425 --> 00:50:01,608
Fabled Fruit makes a point of saying this is not a legacy game, it's not a legacy game,

1233
00:50:01,628 --> 00:50:05,271
like on the back it's almost like, hey Rob, this is not one of your games.

1234
00:50:06,372 --> 00:50:09,195
Because they didn't do the permanent change, they didn't do that permanent change, they

1235
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:13,900
just said, oh, we can lock up content or otherwise keep you from doing it or have a deck that

1236
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,942
as you play the game you bring new stuff in.

1237
00:50:16,502 --> 00:50:19,925
So people are sort of taking the less controversial half of things.

1238
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:23,827
and implementing games and I think it's fantastic that you know all of this is

1239
00:50:23,867 --> 00:50:28,448
happening because now again like giving you a reason to play the game again and

1240
00:50:28,488 --> 00:50:31,829
again again to ramp up in complexity to start you out simple to give you some

1241
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:33,069
actions moving forward.

1242
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:37,630
And then for me like I said I'm working on 3 other ones right now.

1243
00:50:39,631 --> 00:50:42,531
And then you just pitching whole boy myself just

1244
00:50:43,352 --> 00:50:45,032
right in there, my brother that told me.

1245
00:50:45,972 --> 00:50:47,493
He said, hey, I'm from Boston.

1246
00:50:47,514 --> 00:50:48,975
He's like, David Ortiz doesn't bunt.

1247
00:50:49,275 --> 00:50:50,936
He's like, just keep making these legacy games

1248
00:50:50,976 --> 00:50:53,518
until everyone tells you to stop making them.

1249
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,482
So I have this coming out in the third quarter.

1250
00:50:57,822 --> 00:50:59,023
Matt and I have this coming out.

1251
00:50:59,143 --> 00:51:00,724
Excited, it's very different from the first one.

1252
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:04,007
The box bottom just leaked so I can say things now

1253
00:51:04,067 --> 00:51:06,449
like it takes place 71 years in the future

1254
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:08,050
and the world's already ruined.

1255
00:51:09,532 --> 00:51:09,832
Good luck.

1256
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:14,551
So here are some of the covenants that we talked about.

1257
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,452
I can leave those up if anyone want to ask about them.

1258
00:51:16,472 --> 00:51:18,472
But we've got about 10 minutes now to take questions.

1259
00:51:19,032 --> 00:51:21,353
There's two microphones there if you want to line up.

1260
00:51:22,093 --> 00:51:23,554
I can't really see you because of the lights on

1261
00:51:23,594 --> 00:51:24,334
either side of those.

1262
00:51:25,334 --> 00:51:27,055
Or you can shout from your seats if you like.

1263
00:51:27,455 --> 00:51:31,736
Also, I need to tell you to fill in your evaluations.

1264
00:51:33,537 --> 00:51:34,897
And we'll start over here.

1265
00:51:36,398 --> 00:51:36,558
Hello.

1266
00:51:37,173 --> 00:51:42,157
Yep. So one of the big differences between board games and video games is that the video game kind

1267
00:51:42,177 --> 00:51:46,481
of enforces the rules for you. Yep. Whereas in board games the players have to do that. Yep.

1268
00:51:47,182 --> 00:51:50,125
I've heard a bunch of stories of people who started a pandemic legacy campaign,

1269
00:51:50,705 --> 00:51:54,609
messed up the rules in their first game and then never went back to it. Okay. I was wondering when

1270
00:51:54,629 --> 00:51:57,451
you were designing whether you put much consideration into the fact that people

1271
00:51:57,471 --> 00:52:01,975
might just get the rules really wrong and maybe get a different experience than what was meant.

1272
00:52:02,598 --> 00:52:04,061
Well, that's the problem with any board game.

1273
00:52:04,742 --> 00:52:06,644
And I've made this analogy before in other talks, which

1274
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:09,709
is learning a board game would be like if you're going to

1275
00:52:09,749 --> 00:52:12,353
learn a new TV show, and you have to spend 20 minutes doing

1276
00:52:12,393 --> 00:52:14,716
a reading comprehension test and answering questions.

1277
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:17,079
And then when you watch the show, scenes are out of place

1278
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,263
and one character speaks in Spanish for no reason.

1279
00:52:20,163 --> 00:52:21,003
And you get to the end and you're like,

1280
00:52:21,023 --> 00:52:22,144
I don't really like that.

1281
00:52:22,164 --> 00:52:23,384
I didn't like the Spanish speaking guy.

1282
00:52:23,404 --> 00:52:23,884
And they're like, what?

1283
00:52:23,904 --> 00:52:25,045
No, that's not supposed to be right.

1284
00:52:25,065 --> 00:52:25,765
And then you're like, oh, hold on.

1285
00:52:25,785 --> 00:52:26,826
And then you take the test again.

1286
00:52:26,846 --> 00:52:27,666
And then you get to watch it.

1287
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,307
Like, it's a really unfair burden put on people

1288
00:52:30,787 --> 00:52:32,548
that gets compounded in the legacy games.

1289
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,408
Now, what Matt and I put at the end of the book is like,

1290
00:52:34,508 --> 00:52:35,109
it's all cool.

1291
00:52:35,169 --> 00:52:35,889
You're not going to break it.

1292
00:52:35,929 --> 00:52:37,530
If you mess something up, just cut your funding

1293
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:39,490
or add your funding and just keep rolling with it.

1294
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:42,771
So of course, like, you know, it's discouraging.

1295
00:52:42,852 --> 00:52:44,092
Or, you know, tell me who they are.

1296
00:52:44,112 --> 00:52:44,972
I'll tell them it's OK.

1297
00:52:45,012 --> 00:52:45,713
And they can keep playing.

1298
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:47,153
They can keep playing up after one game.

1299
00:52:48,372 --> 00:52:50,034
I would hate to have that happen, right?

1300
00:52:50,054 --> 00:52:51,576
There were some people who were playing a C fall game

1301
00:52:51,616 --> 00:52:52,597
and they found out in game nine

1302
00:52:52,617 --> 00:52:53,978
they were playing some rule horribly wrong

1303
00:52:53,998 --> 00:52:56,682
and they went on BGG and asked about it

1304
00:52:56,782 --> 00:52:59,165
and everyone's like, no, it's fine.

1305
00:52:59,832 --> 00:53:01,152
It's good, just keep rolling with it,

1306
00:53:01,172 --> 00:53:02,193
you're all playing under the same role.

1307
00:53:02,233 --> 00:53:05,174
So it's a necessary problem of board games,

1308
00:53:05,254 --> 00:53:06,414
it gets compounded in legacy games,

1309
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:09,215
and Matt and I, to an extent in season one,

1310
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:10,936
and religiously in season two,

1311
00:53:10,996 --> 00:53:13,377
tried to do forms and factors and numbers

1312
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:15,278
and reminders and cards and putting things

1313
00:53:15,338 --> 00:53:18,299
in certain places to guide this experience even more.

1314
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:19,239
Thank you.

1315
00:53:21,149 --> 00:53:21,289
Hi.

1316
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:22,991
John Arnold from Handelabra Games.

1317
00:53:23,692 --> 00:53:27,516
I was curious, as you mentioned, video games

1318
00:53:27,596 --> 00:53:30,499
inspired a lot about what's going on in legacy games.

1319
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:33,182
Do you have any thoughts about digital versions

1320
00:53:33,442 --> 00:53:34,884
of legacy tabletop games?

1321
00:53:35,444 --> 00:53:38,227
Any opportunities or challenges that you could think of?

1322
00:53:38,567 --> 00:53:40,349
Yeah, well, I mean, the challenge is what is it?

1323
00:53:41,222 --> 00:53:43,724
Because a digital game already has campaign modes,

1324
00:53:43,744 --> 00:53:45,865
and they already have branching narratives,

1325
00:53:45,885 --> 00:53:47,666
and unlockable content, and a lot of the stuff

1326
00:53:47,686 --> 00:53:48,967
that I cribbed and put back in here.

1327
00:53:49,007 --> 00:53:50,247
And so what I don't want to do is

1328
00:53:50,307 --> 00:53:53,489
end up having a photocopy of a photocopy going backwards.

1329
00:53:53,529 --> 00:53:56,371
I mean, the joke I always make is when you finish the game,

1330
00:53:56,411 --> 00:53:58,352
it uninstalls itself, and you have to buy it again for $5

1331
00:53:58,752 --> 00:53:59,392
or something.

1332
00:54:00,313 --> 00:54:02,174
But I don't think that anyone's going

1333
00:54:02,194 --> 00:54:03,174
to let us get away with that.

1334
00:54:05,438 --> 00:54:09,099
I don't know, I suspect it would be something like a series of board games in campaign mode

1335
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,440
where actions have consequences.

1336
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,241
But I don't know exactly what it is.

1337
00:54:13,301 --> 00:54:16,682
It's something that people have been asking me about lately and I don't have a clear answer

1338
00:54:16,722 --> 00:54:19,683
for it because it feels like, again, it's going back to a medium where a lot of stuff

1339
00:54:19,703 --> 00:54:20,063
came from.

1340
00:54:20,563 --> 00:54:21,284
But there's an answer.

1341
00:54:21,304 --> 00:54:22,524
Like potion explosion sort of.

1342
00:54:22,584 --> 00:54:22,804
What's that?

1343
00:54:23,064 --> 00:54:24,265
Sort of like potion explosion.

1344
00:54:24,785 --> 00:54:25,425
I haven't played that yet.

1345
00:54:25,545 --> 00:54:30,627
Oh, it's a physical bejeweled that's also gone back to a digital version.

1346
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:36,255
Hi uh thanks for the talk. Also I'd say uh to that idea a

1347
00:54:36,515 --> 00:54:39,996
server side, lock everybody in, can't undo your save, pay

1348
00:54:40,056 --> 00:54:43,937
fifteen dollars for the legacy style expansion pass, I would do

1349
00:54:43,977 --> 00:54:47,238
that with co-op prints. Anyway my question is the play testing

1350
00:54:47,278 --> 00:54:48,818
process. Especially when you are

1351
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:54,361
explicitly breaking covenants and you are trying to make a game that is essentially

1352
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:58,643
fucking with some players' expectations but also want to playtest a long game.

1353
00:54:58,723 --> 00:54:58,843
Yep.

1354
00:54:59,043 --> 00:55:02,985
Like, I'd love to hear how you go after that and what you really look for in that feedback

1355
00:55:03,005 --> 00:55:03,885
that's actually valuable to you.

1356
00:55:03,905 --> 00:55:07,687
Yeah, so there's three different games that I've done, or four if you include season two,

1357
00:55:07,727 --> 00:55:10,028
which is done and with, you know, they finished that last year.

1358
00:55:10,669 --> 00:55:15,210
They all had a slightly different playtesting methodology,

1359
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:16,271
and the one that worked the best

1360
00:55:16,311 --> 00:55:17,651
was the one from Pandemic Legacy,

1361
00:55:17,671 --> 00:55:19,512
which is qualitative over quantitative.

1362
00:55:19,852 --> 00:55:22,293
At Hasbro, it was just the usual playtest group.

1363
00:55:22,313 --> 00:55:23,753
CFAWL, Plaid Hat did a great job

1364
00:55:23,773 --> 00:55:25,214
of doing their usual thing that you would do

1365
00:55:25,254 --> 00:55:25,894
for something like a.

1366
00:55:26,414 --> 00:55:28,355
a deck-building game, which is to get a lot of data

1367
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:29,415
from a lot of different groups.

1368
00:55:30,516 --> 00:55:32,437
But what Matt does with all his games

1369
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:33,897
when we do a pandemic legacy is we gave it

1370
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:35,198
to two to four groups at a time

1371
00:55:35,258 --> 00:55:37,679
and had them video their entire experience,

1372
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:39,519
including before the game and then after the game.

1373
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:40,760
And then we watched all of these

1374
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,381
and made hundreds and hundreds of notes.

1375
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:45,262
Because you can't get enough data,

1376
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:47,743
meaningful data across the spectrum,

1377
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:51,204
it's more important to get really good data focused in,

1378
00:55:51,484 --> 00:55:53,265
because they're more of an experiential game.

1379
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:58,327
it's a little bit less important whether is this costed 2 or costed 3

1380
00:55:58,607 --> 00:56:01,388
because it's something you can make a different choice on later.

1381
00:56:01,428 --> 00:56:02,508
We still try to get it right.

1382
00:56:02,908 --> 00:56:04,909
What's more important is people got confused.

1383
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:06,149
This text was too long.

1384
00:56:06,209 --> 00:56:07,270
This didn't fit on the board.

1385
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:11,051
This rule is, they stopped play for 7 minutes figuring out this rule.

1386
00:56:11,091 --> 00:56:12,371
This rule shouldn't come out in the middle of the game.

1387
00:56:12,431 --> 00:56:14,492
It should come out at the end of the game because it's longer to integrate.

1388
00:56:14,532 --> 00:56:18,333
So with legacy games now going forward to me, it's a video.

1389
00:56:19,351 --> 00:56:20,572
It's a lot of work.

1390
00:56:20,652 --> 00:56:22,976
It's hundreds of hours of video watching and making notes,

1391
00:56:23,076 --> 00:56:26,801
but that's how you find all the things that aren't in the game

1392
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,944
but above the game, like above the table.

1393
00:56:30,212 --> 00:56:32,873
I've got four minutes, so I can probably take these three questions.

1394
00:56:32,893 --> 00:56:38,995
Okay, I'm interested in the covenant that the players make with each other to continue

1395
00:56:39,035 --> 00:56:39,795
playing the game.

1396
00:56:41,296 --> 00:56:46,578
With like an RPG, you say, oh, we're going to play D&D once a month, whatever, and it's

1397
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:47,998
effectively infinite.

1398
00:56:48,379 --> 00:56:48,559
But

1399
00:56:48,859 --> 00:56:49,019
Yeah.

1400
00:56:49,819 --> 00:56:53,403
And with regular board games, we're going to play board games every week.

1401
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:54,284
It's going to be different.

1402
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:56,386
It's whatever we sit down to play.

1403
00:56:56,766 --> 00:57:00,590
But here I'm finding it difficult to find a group

1404
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:04,734
who's going to commit to pandemic legacy or see fall. Yep.

1405
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:11,420
Basically, the campaign nature of D&D is I inherited a lot of things from D&D or took

1406
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:11,880
a lot of things.

1407
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,403
And one of the things I also took is the how do we get a group together problem.

1408
00:57:16,344 --> 00:57:17,685
It's like forming a band, right?

1409
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:20,328
Like everyone has great ideas and then it just falls apart.

1410
00:57:22,988 --> 00:57:26,490
It's different. It lives in that space of, hey, we're going to do this thing and it's going to take,

1411
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:30,193
we're going to play, you know, the first game we played our game group every week is going to be

1412
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:34,776
Pandemic Legacy and that will take our time for the next three months. That's one of the reasons

1413
00:57:34,816 --> 00:57:38,738
people said they wanted a six-pack. They wanted like five games and I'm done or eight games and

1414
00:57:38,758 --> 00:57:42,321
I'm done because I was so concerned about adding the value.

1415
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,781
that we put the number at like 12 or 15,

1416
00:57:45,322 --> 00:57:48,403
but I'm discovering now that maybe that's not as important

1417
00:57:48,463 --> 00:57:50,144
as doing something where you can get a group together

1418
00:57:50,184 --> 00:57:52,186
and committing and maybe a smaller number makes sense.

1419
00:57:52,726 --> 00:57:54,047
I don't have a magic answer other than

1420
00:57:54,107 --> 00:57:56,448
it's the same issues that come from D&D.

1421
00:57:58,329 --> 00:58:00,110
And we've made a point with Pandemic Legacy

1422
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:01,731
to make it a two-player game because it's a good

1423
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:04,173
couples game or parent and child game, right?

1424
00:58:04,213 --> 00:58:05,173
It doesn't need a large,

1425
00:58:05,553 --> 00:58:07,635
it's easier to get one person together than three.

1426
00:58:08,695 --> 00:58:09,316
Right. Okay?

1427
00:58:09,796 --> 00:58:10,516
Okay.

1428
00:58:10,717 --> 00:58:11,817
I don't have an answer, unfortunately.

1429
00:58:13,247 --> 00:58:21,977
Hi. What were some of the lessons you learned about tuning and balancing on a game like Betrayal at House on the Hill that you applied to the Legacy game?

1430
00:58:22,157 --> 00:58:27,522
Yeah, well that's probably the first time I've heard the phrase tune and balance associated with Betrayal at House on the Hill.

1431
00:58:27,643 --> 00:58:29,605
Yeah, it's surprising.

1432
00:58:33,054 --> 00:58:38,236
Yeah, my take is sometimes tuning and balance is not as vital as the experience.

1433
00:58:38,536 --> 00:58:41,617
What happens in Legacy is there's always a chance to fix it later, right?

1434
00:58:41,637 --> 00:58:43,598
You make a chance and like, oh, that was a bad idea.

1435
00:58:43,618 --> 00:58:48,219
It's like, well, at the end of this game, we now have to do this to correct for that

1436
00:58:48,299 --> 00:58:51,300
because it didn't work how we wanted to give enough people enough tools

1437
00:58:52,141 --> 00:58:54,301
that they can solve whatever problem they created.

1438
00:58:54,341 --> 00:58:56,442
That's when Matt and I will talk about what designing like, well,

1439
00:58:56,462 --> 00:58:58,263
if they really mess up this portion.

1440
00:58:59,343 --> 00:59:00,164
we'll give them these tools.

1441
00:59:00,224 --> 00:59:01,444
If they don't pay attention to that,

1442
00:59:01,545 --> 00:59:02,465
we'll give them these tools.

1443
00:59:02,485 --> 00:59:04,206
So I don't know what problems you're gonna have

1444
00:59:04,226 --> 00:59:06,027
in your world, but we should have found a solution

1445
00:59:06,067 --> 00:59:06,567
for all of it.

1446
00:59:06,607 --> 00:59:09,048
So you may say like, well, we never use these stickers.

1447
00:59:09,068 --> 00:59:10,229
And it's like, well, you didn't end up

1448
00:59:10,249 --> 00:59:11,029
with a problem there.

1449
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,570
So for me, it's not about balancing it.

1450
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:15,211
It's trying to think of every problem

1451
00:59:15,231 --> 00:59:17,572
and giving them the ability to balance it themselves.

1452
00:59:17,592 --> 00:59:18,593
Okay.

1453
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:23,430
You showed some of the other games that are starting to do more sort of

1454
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:28,072
continuing campaigns and stuff like that, but that none of them are doing the more

1455
00:59:28,172 --> 00:59:32,273
permanent changes that the legacy games are doing. Do you think more games will

1456
00:59:32,293 --> 00:59:34,714
start doing, you know, writing on the boards and stickers? Are you excited

1457
00:59:34,754 --> 00:59:36,575
about that and will they be called legacy games?

1458
00:59:37,055 --> 00:59:40,616
They can be called legacy games if they want. I mean, I'm associated with it but I

1459
00:59:40,936 --> 00:59:44,318
control or own nothing to it because I thought of the idea why I work for a

1460
00:59:44,358 --> 00:59:47,299
corporation so thank you Hasbro for not locking that down.

1461
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:50,330
Some people are doing it.

1462
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:51,591
Gloomhaven's doing it a little bit.

1463
00:59:52,132 --> 00:59:54,313
I was a little behind on time, so I didn't get into his detail.

1464
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:57,615
But that is multiple groups can be exploring the same world

1465
00:59:57,655 --> 00:59:58,296
at the same time.

1466
00:59:58,336 --> 01:00:00,537
So group A might raid this tomb and shut it down

1467
01:00:00,577 --> 01:00:02,259
before B gets there on a different night.

1468
01:00:02,879 --> 01:00:04,040
One of the things about a legacy game

1469
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:06,642
is you can't leave it at a library and everyone plays it.

1470
01:00:06,662 --> 01:00:07,642
But Gloomhaven, you could.

1471
01:00:07,662 --> 01:00:09,364
You could walk and be like, oh, that other group that

1472
01:00:09,384 --> 01:00:10,825
plays on Tuesday got that sword.

1473
01:00:11,545 --> 01:00:12,626
So there's some interesting things

1474
01:00:12,646 --> 01:00:14,527
that are going on with permanence now.

1475
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:16,709
And I think when Risk came out, people

1476
01:00:16,829 --> 01:00:18,250
saw it as an interesting fad.

1477
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:20,251
or an interesting idea.

1478
01:00:20,271 --> 01:00:21,332
A number of people tried it and said,

1479
01:00:21,352 --> 01:00:23,454
this is ridiculously difficult to do

1480
01:00:23,934 --> 01:00:26,116
and probably is never gonna be successful again.

1481
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:28,077
And then pandemic came out and everyone now said,

1482
01:00:28,237 --> 01:00:30,139
okay, maybe there's something to this.

1483
01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:31,700
And I keep hearing through the grapevine

1484
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,761
that there are more coming out.

1485
01:00:32,801 --> 01:00:35,303
I think we're starting to see other people doing it

1486
01:00:35,663 --> 01:00:36,163
based on it.

1487
01:00:36,203 --> 01:00:37,845
And they'll come up with all sorts of new ideas

1488
01:00:37,865 --> 01:00:38,945
that I couldn't possibly think of.

1489
01:00:39,005 --> 01:00:40,286
Cause I'm now at the point where I'm like,

1490
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:41,087
this is how it's done.

1491
01:00:41,107 --> 01:00:43,449
Like it's gone from crazy idea to here are the rules

1492
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:44,930
of how to do it really quickly.

1493
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:48,232
So I'm looking forward to people shaking up my assumptions

1494
01:00:48,272 --> 01:00:48,473
of what.

1495
01:00:49,013 --> 01:00:52,463
what this can do. It's 10 31 so I'm afraid they're going to kick us out now

1496
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:55,050
so I want to thank you all for taking the time this morning.
