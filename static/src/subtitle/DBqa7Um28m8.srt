1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,362
So welcome to our presentation, Building a Living World from Ancient Ruins.

2
00:00:07,623 --> 00:00:10,266
My name is Benjamin Hall, World Director on Assassin's Creed Odyssey,

3
00:00:10,686 --> 00:00:12,448
and I'm joined today by my good friend and colleague.

4
00:00:12,788 --> 00:00:16,052
Thierry D'Ancero, so I was the art director on Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

5
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:20,576
So Ben and I have been working around three years together on that project,

6
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:24,641
and we are very, very happy to be with you guys today for today's talk.

7
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:26,743
And we do hope that you'll enjoy it.

8
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:34,590
So in terms of takeaways, one of the big things

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,733
that we'd like to share today is the philosophy

10
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:38,255
of how we went about building the world

11
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:39,797
of Ancient Greece for Assassin's Creed,

12
00:00:40,218 --> 00:00:41,820
and some of the things that we learned along the way,

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,463
and some of the things that we are really proud

14
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:46,907
of what we accomplished along that route.

15
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:48,649
So one of the big things for us

16
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:50,371
was by remaining true to our vision.

17
00:00:51,232 --> 00:00:52,513
and disciplined in how we worked,

18
00:00:52,613 --> 00:00:54,833
trusting in each other and with our team as well.

19
00:00:55,273 --> 00:00:56,954
We were able to build a world that was everything

20
00:00:56,994 --> 00:00:59,475
we wanted it to be while keeping the team engaged

21
00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:01,195
and empowered and building a world

22
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:02,955
that laid the foundations for a game

23
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:03,996
that was critically acclaimed.

24
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:07,557
Yes, and you'll see throughout this presentation,

25
00:01:07,577 --> 00:01:09,957
there's key aspects that for us were very important

26
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:11,098
in the production of this world.

27
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,938
Those are the six main key points

28
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,119
that will go back at the very end of this presentation,

29
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:18,000
and it will be detailed throughout also the presentation.

30
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,474
So of course, there's gonna be a lot of content

31
00:01:21,494 --> 00:01:22,614
shared with you guys today.

32
00:01:23,214 --> 00:01:26,035
So to make it clear and very understandable as possible,

33
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:28,455
we've separated this presentation in parts.

34
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,615
So we'll go through the project overview.

35
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:32,656
We'll speak on how we did establish

36
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:33,616
the vision for this game.

37
00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:35,676
We'll talk about the world phases

38
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,017
that we've put in place for the production of this game.

39
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:40,037
And then we'll conclude and you'll be able

40
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:41,937
to ask us questions at the very end.

41
00:01:42,758 --> 00:01:44,538
So you'll be able to know where we're at

42
00:01:44,598 --> 00:01:46,018
at any given moment just by looking

43
00:01:46,038 --> 00:01:47,618
at the upper bar on the presentation.

44
00:01:50,113 --> 00:01:51,954
So as always, in Assassin's Creed,

45
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:54,195
we wanted to create and pick a setting

46
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:55,956
that is a pivotal moment in a story,

47
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:59,417
a period that deeply impacts the story of mankind,

48
00:01:59,757 --> 00:02:02,218
which will allow for plenty of gameplay opportunities.

49
00:02:02,898 --> 00:02:04,559
So we also wanted a setting and a period

50
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:06,600
that are connected to the story we want to tell,

51
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,421
that idea of a place torn between the order and free will,

52
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:14,342
a time, the old world and the new world,

53
00:02:14,442 --> 00:02:17,243
a setting where mankind is at the eve of its more

54
00:02:17,657 --> 00:02:22,999
astonishing progress and discovery, but at the same time risking of looting it all to war and violence.

55
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,980
And that war was the Peloponnesian War.

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,982
The onset of the Peloponnesian War allowed us to focus on the picture postcard of Greece while at the same time

57
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:37,204
implementing the little bubbles and pockets of the contrast of war and of the onset of war in ancient Greece.

58
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:41,246
So really ancient Greece in its golden age was the perfect setting for what we wanted to do.

59
00:02:43,655 --> 00:02:45,136
But to do that, we needed a vision.

60
00:02:45,736 --> 00:02:47,217
So the vision was laid out at the very beginning

61
00:02:47,277 --> 00:02:49,678
of the project by the creative director, Jonathan Dumont.

62
00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:52,380
And the vision that was gonna be part of the pillars

63
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,801
of every single part of the game,

64
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:55,221
the world, the narrative, the art,

65
00:02:55,702 --> 00:02:58,403
was to, during the golden age of ancient Greece,

66
00:02:58,964 --> 00:03:01,585
determine your path on the epic odyssey

67
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:03,146
of a legendary Greek hero.

68
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:05,988
So this was something that was defined very, very early on,

69
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:07,288
as with a lot of video games,

70
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,089
and was something that was gonna filter down

71
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,031
into everything we did for the next three years.

72
00:03:13,052 --> 00:03:17,354
So the first thing we really started to do is to try to gather as much reference as possible.

73
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:26,418
So the first thing we did is to get to see what type of movie were produced with the ancient Greece or the Greek mythology as a main topic.

74
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:33,802
So we've been watching a lot and a lot and a lot of movie and screenshot them to make sure that we've nailed what they had in common.

75
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:36,932
We did the same exercise with all the games that were produced

76
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:40,153
with the Greek mythology or the Greek as the main setting.

77
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:47,234
So the key thread here were to see what were the key thread

78
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:50,655
in those game and movies to see if we could either tap into them

79
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:52,675
or reinvent them in some cases.

80
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:55,976
And we did the same exercise with contemporary painters.

81
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:59,257
So we wanted to see how they painted

82
00:03:59,357 --> 00:04:01,497
or visualized those that time period.

83
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:05,508
So artists like John William Goodward or John William

84
00:04:05,748 --> 00:04:08,291
Waterhouse were very inspirational for us.

85
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:13,116
And of course, being an Assassin's Creed game,

86
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:14,678
everything's based on history.

87
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,401
So we wanted to make sure we tapped into the rich, ancient

88
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:19,763
history of Greece, which was something that was incredibly

89
00:04:19,804 --> 00:04:21,866
diverse and something that we realized we didn't know very

90
00:04:21,906 --> 00:04:22,346
much about.

91
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,608
So we needed help.

92
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:30,210
So our goal was to build a living world, an authentic, credible world based on this ancient setting.

93
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:34,414
But today, most of that world is only a few centimeters above the ground.

94
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:37,837
Quite a lot of that world is still actually many feet below the ground.

95
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,280
So we needed to find somebody who could help us understand what this world was

96
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,203
so that we could best create it and we could make credible choices creatively.

97
00:04:46,758 --> 00:04:48,840
So our help arrived when we met Stephanie Arruato, who's

98
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,102
a doctor in Greek history.

99
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:54,905
And we met her during the reference trip to Greece,

100
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:56,466
which Thierry will talk about a little bit later on.

101
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,788
And it became apparent very quickly that the things that

102
00:04:58,828 --> 00:05:00,970
she knew about Greece were things that we needed to know,

103
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,972
things that we could tap into, things that we could

104
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,573
utilize, and things that were going to help

105
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:05,434
us make a better game.

106
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:08,476
Stephanie also had a really cool LEGO figure made after

107
00:05:08,496 --> 00:05:10,218
her, so hint, hint.

108
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,521
So here's a few words from Stephanie.

109
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:18,545
Reconstructing ancient Greece was quite a challenge.

110
00:05:19,206 --> 00:05:23,007
For some city, it was harder to find some specific data.

111
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:26,649
For example, on Mykonos, nothing is remained.

112
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:32,192
So it was quite hard to reproduce exactly the city

113
00:05:32,372 --> 00:05:34,733
as it was during antique time.

114
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:39,264
We try to capture the importance of mythology for the ancient Greeks.

115
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:43,185
Mythology is an integral part of their society,

116
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:48,766
their social behavior, their belief, their religious tradition.

117
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:53,387
Mythology also inspired them in their art,

118
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:56,427
in their decoration of their temple.

119
00:05:56,887 --> 00:06:01,348
Also, mythology was used during that time period as a political propaganda.

120
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:07,120
Working with Stephanie-Ann and other experts

121
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,601
made us realize that, as game developers,

122
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,282
we knew nothing about ancient Greece.

123
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:15,524
And so the best way to get to learn about Greece

124
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:17,365
and its richest story was to get there.

125
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:21,207
So some of us did that detrimentous chance.

126
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,868
In fact, three groups were sent to do a scouting trip in Greece.

127
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,861
which was an amazing experience.

128
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:28,223
Each group were accompanied by experts

129
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,904
so we could ask any questions.

130
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:32,226
And the goal of this Scouting Trip

131
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:34,648
was to gather as much knowledge as possible.

132
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:36,809
And when we say everything,

133
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:38,611
we did ask questions for everything

134
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:41,173
because we had to build that world from ground up.

135
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:43,755
So we asked questions about topology,

136
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:47,237
history, temple, architectures, animal life, food,

137
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:50,100
everything you can think of, we asked.

138
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:54,093
We took around 13,000 pictures and video during those trips.

139
00:06:54,593 --> 00:06:56,673
We visited numerous historical sites.

140
00:06:57,013 --> 00:07:00,934
We went to Athens, Sparta, Olympia, Delphi, Crete,

141
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,375
Thassos, Macedonia, only to name a few.

142
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,375
Extensive academic research were done.

143
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:09,036
Workshop were given by experts to our team as well.

144
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:14,117
Since most of the prop and statue are now kept in museum,

145
00:07:14,157 --> 00:07:15,277
we visited all of them.

146
00:07:15,677 --> 00:07:18,317
So museum database were used also extensively.

147
00:07:19,178 --> 00:07:20,518
And in addition to that.

148
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:23,650
another team of researchers worked with Stephanie-Anne

149
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,091
to create a web-based resource bank

150
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:28,072
called the World Texture Facility,

151
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:30,373
or what the fuck by most people on the team.

152
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:35,955
So, and those data were not only used by the world team,

153
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:38,656
it was, the data was used by the quiz designer,

154
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:42,838
animator, character modelers, world director,

155
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:46,240
everyone, in fact, used that data to help us.

156
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,339
to create a more credible but also a very creative world.

157
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,502
So more than 1,000 reference pages

158
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:53,404
have been written to support the team

159
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:54,545
throughout the whole project.

160
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:59,091
So before we move to the second part of this presentation,

161
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:02,895
here's a quick video extract of our scouting trip in Greece.

162
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:39,385
you

163
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:14,539
So there was me rocking the GDC t-shirt in Athens

164
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:16,140
like it was all planned from the beginning.

165
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,321
So the next step that we moved into

166
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:20,981
was defining the visual pillars.

167
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:22,642
So we'd been on this massive epic trip.

168
00:09:22,702 --> 00:09:24,403
We'd come back with thousands of photographs.

169
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:27,064
We'd been through them, started doing metadata

170
00:09:27,104 --> 00:09:28,804
so that we could understand where they all were.

171
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:31,945
And to define the visual pillars, what we decided to do

172
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,766
was actually to define what we are not.

173
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:35,426
We thought it was easier to go down that route.

174
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:39,732
So after going through all of the previous media that we've been through, watching loads of cool movies,

175
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:47,263
quite often Greece was depicted as an overcast, brown, desaturated world that was quite often monochromatic and quite dry and arid.

176
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:50,328
And that was definitely not what we experienced when we went to Greece.

177
00:09:50,868 --> 00:09:52,229
Instead, we discovered a world that

178
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:55,150
was filled with lush biomes, different fauna and flora

179
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,511
around the world, diverse and surrounded

180
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:59,351
by that clear turquoise blue water

181
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,052
that you just wanted to jump in and go swimming.

182
00:10:01,452 --> 00:10:03,732
And that was the grease that we wanted to try and recapture

183
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:06,213
to give to the player to go on their own journey.

184
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:08,354
We wanted to create a world that felt as though it

185
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,755
had been birthed by the gods and have much more variety

186
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:13,575
than just that dry, arid landscape that

187
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:14,616
was often depicted.

188
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:16,816
So.

189
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:20,301
Like based on our earlier search in Scottish and Greece,

190
00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:22,803
those keywords were chosen as guidelines for the art

191
00:10:22,843 --> 00:10:24,044
and world direction of the world.

192
00:10:25,065 --> 00:10:28,027
So all the art opportunities that an artistic decision

193
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:30,228
that were made along the way were to make sure

194
00:10:30,248 --> 00:10:33,091
to create the most diverse, visually appealing,

195
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:34,832
and art-inspiring world to play in.

196
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:37,594
So from a visual point of view,

197
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:39,696
the player will experience a magnificent world

198
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:41,077
filled with mountains and sea,

199
00:10:41,497 --> 00:10:43,438
giving the landscape a render never seen before

200
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,159
within the brand.

201
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:48,798
the player will discover and experience a massive, vibrant,

202
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:51,860
colorful, and diverse world filled with contrast,

203
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,061
and that not only in its biome,

204
00:10:53,081 --> 00:10:55,022
but also in its architectures and props

205
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:59,025
because it was very important for us to achieve that.

206
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:03,368
So here in the next slide, you'll see the early concept art

207
00:11:03,388 --> 00:11:05,909
that we've produced to define our art intention,

208
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:07,830
but also to inspire the team.

209
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:11,112
So as you can see, we wanted to make sure

210
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:13,354
to have epic visual elements throughout the world,

211
00:11:13,414 --> 00:11:14,835
like those giant big statues.

212
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,561
We also wanted to push the color and the saturation as an overall.

213
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:22,662
Remember, we didn't want to create a monochromatic world.

214
00:11:24,562 --> 00:11:26,803
And here you can see that even the marketing image

215
00:11:26,823 --> 00:11:28,944
that were produced were produced with that in mind.

216
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:31,665
So that means that the vision that we had at the very beginning

217
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:34,586
stayed until the very end of the project, which is very great.

218
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:38,627
Contrast became a key pillar for us.

219
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:42,108
So it was something we really wanted to make sure

220
00:11:42,128 --> 00:11:43,568
that we ran through the art of the world.

221
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:47,553
And alongside the notion of contrast is dynamism.

222
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:49,393
So blending those two pillars

223
00:11:49,773 --> 00:11:51,454
were also very important for us.

224
00:11:55,175 --> 00:11:57,695
So that's why we've created a systemic weather system

225
00:11:58,095 --> 00:12:00,756
that allowed us to go from full power thunderstorm

226
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:03,977
to a rainy afternoon, to searing blue skies

227
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:05,317
and also sun-kissed beaches.

228
00:12:07,137 --> 00:12:08,778
We wanted the world to change around you

229
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:11,258
and continue to offer new sensation as you travel.

230
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,919
We've paid a lot of attention to a dynamic time of day.

231
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,978
to truly support a world contrast between tradition and modernity,

232
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:23,263
religion and science, and the war between Sparta and Athens.

233
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:26,987
Greece is epic and grandiose.

234
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:30,751
In fact, 85% of the Greek landscape is made out of mountains,

235
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:33,134
which makes the whole country pretty epic by itself.

236
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:35,216
But it's extended beyond the landscape.

237
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:41,124
We've learned through our research to the ancient Greeks

238
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:43,725
that building and art were being produced in this period

239
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:46,526
were colossal compared with anything that's seen before.

240
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:50,567
So it was really important for us to recapture

241
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:51,787
that feeling for the player.

242
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:57,809
So building, statues, and natural landscape

243
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:00,170
all needed to feel like they had been created by the gods.

244
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,081
So once we'd established the visual pillars as a group,

245
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:09,482
it was time to start looking at the world pillars.

246
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,023
What did we want the player to experience

247
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,044
as they traveled around the world?

248
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:15,885
What did we want them to feel as they explored?

249
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:19,367
So we tapped into the nature of the contrast.

250
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:21,728
So contrast was a pillar that was from the very top

251
00:13:21,788 --> 00:13:23,569
of the game, was running right the way

252
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:25,330
through the art direction, and we tapped into that

253
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,171
with the world as well.

254
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:27,591
So as they're traveling around the world.

255
00:13:27,912 --> 00:13:30,373
they get to feel this change as they move around.

256
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,995
So we tapped into the contrast of nature versus man,

257
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,777
land versus sea, reason versus myth, beauty versus war,

258
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,699
and of course, Sparta versus Athens.

259
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,701
Here's a sneak peek at the way the world

260
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:43,442
actually transformed throughout production

261
00:13:43,482 --> 00:13:45,303
from the very first map in the top left,

262
00:13:45,683 --> 00:13:47,705
transitioning right the way through to the final version.

263
00:13:48,205 --> 00:13:49,626
You can see from the very early stages

264
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,087
before we'd even been to visit Greece,

265
00:13:51,127 --> 00:13:53,548
we wanted to try and capture the entire Greek empire,

266
00:13:53,588 --> 00:13:56,050
which actually was including Persia as well.

267
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,932
And the reason that we decided not to do that in the end

268
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,812
turned out to be the fact that we wanted to capture

269
00:14:00,852 --> 00:14:02,013
this grandiose landscape.

270
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,974
So what we needed to do was to expand on the landscape

271
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:06,315
to be able to build the Peloponnese,

272
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,656
build Mount Taigatos and its mountain ranges

273
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:12,518
to show the scale and diversity of the landscape,

274
00:14:12,838 --> 00:14:16,120
but also the relationship between the urban sanctuaries

275
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,301
of the world and how they related to the terrain.

276
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:21,302
And of course the water, 60% of our world was water.

277
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:24,143
We were bringing naval back as an open world gameplay

278
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,424
for the first time since Black Flag.

279
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:27,886
And it was incredibly important that we gave the player space

280
00:14:27,946 --> 00:14:30,367
to be able to explore the world on their boat.

281
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:34,510
One of the key core philosophies of the actual world itself

282
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,971
was the idea of honeycomb.

283
00:14:36,111 --> 00:14:37,973
So the notion of honeycomb actually

284
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:40,634
copies quite significantly the way

285
00:14:40,675 --> 00:14:42,956
the ancient Greeks used to own their landscape, which

286
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,937
is different city states would actually

287
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:47,379
utilize the land between different mountain ranges.

288
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,602
And both Sistine Saints would know that the region on the other side of that mountain

289
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:55,463
wouldn't cross into their region because that was their region.

290
00:14:56,124 --> 00:14:59,365
And I wanted to tap into that, we wanted to tap into that, so that we could utilize the

291
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:02,947
different regions as a separate space. We could change the thematic, we could change

292
00:15:03,347 --> 00:15:07,930
the type of people, the type of work that you'd see going on in the different regions

293
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,831
based on this honeycomb building mountain ranges between the different areas.

294
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,572
So the player as they're adventuring,

295
00:15:13,592 --> 00:15:14,573
they'd climb up a mountain

296
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,353
and they get a cool view of the next vista,

297
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:18,554
and then they can move down into that region

298
00:15:18,594 --> 00:15:19,634
and play inside of that region.

299
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:22,816
So now that our visual pillars were done

300
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:24,516
for both the art and the world,

301
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:27,297
it was time for us to move into the production phases

302
00:15:27,537 --> 00:15:29,038
so the real fun could begin.

303
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:31,999
So before moving to the phase three of this presentation,

304
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,320
let's have a little bit of fun.

305
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:42,092
Choose life.

306
00:15:42,713 --> 00:15:43,333
Choose a job.

307
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:46,717
Choose a career.

308
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,597
Choose a family.

309
00:15:52,862 --> 00:15:54,444
Choose leisure wear and matching luggage.

310
00:15:54,464 --> 00:15:57,867
Choose a three-piece suite on higher purchase in a range of fabrics.

311
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:02,131
Choose a fucking big television.

312
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:06,314
Choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players and electrical tin owners.

313
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:14,506
Choose good health, low cholesterol, and dental insurance.

314
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:17,547
Choose fixed interest mortgage repayments.

315
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:20,768
Choose a starter home.

316
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:23,949
Choose your friends.

317
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:29,590
Choose DIY and wondering who the fuck you are on a Sunday morning.

318
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:35,792
Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing, spirit-crushing game shows,

319
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:37,773
stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth.

320
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:40,563
that she's rotting away at the end of it all.

321
00:16:40,843 --> 00:16:42,504
Pissing your last in a miserable home,

322
00:16:42,704 --> 00:16:44,204
nothing more than an embarrassment

323
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:45,844
to the selfish, fucked up rats

324
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:47,765
you spawned to replace yourself.

325
00:16:47,805 --> 00:16:48,805
Choose your future.

326
00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:49,565
Choose life.

327
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:09,925
So now we've done the shameless plug,

328
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:11,646
we'll move on to the rest of the presentation.

329
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:13,107
Sorry, we couldn't resist.

330
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:17,330
So in order to build this monster,

331
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,311
we needed to be disciplined in how we built it,

332
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:22,493
and we needed to be free to iterate and scale,

333
00:17:22,513 --> 00:17:25,035
scope as we work without costing the art at the same time.

334
00:17:26,616 --> 00:17:28,837
And this massive enterprise couldn't have been possible

335
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:30,678
without the help of our world managers.

336
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,800
They played a key role in organizing the production

337
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,702
and supporting the director's vision was the key here.

338
00:17:38,987 --> 00:17:41,709
So we did change the team structures to be more agile,

339
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:44,391
so not fully agile, but our own version of agile.

340
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:48,473
So each core art department had their own product owner,

341
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,435
empowering the experts to be responsible for the quality

342
00:17:51,455 --> 00:17:53,957
and quantity of asset produced for the game world.

343
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,999
So by trusting our people,

344
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:59,941
we've created engagement and commitment amongst them,

345
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:02,382
and we can say that they all had a huge impact

346
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:03,643
on the final look of the game

347
00:18:03,723 --> 00:18:05,945
because they were part of the decision-making process.

348
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:10,450
So the notion of one team became something

349
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,391
that was incredibly important for us throughout production

350
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:14,572
and the slogan was something that we built on as we went.

351
00:18:15,212 --> 00:18:17,173
Coming off the back of Assassin's Creed Syndicate,

352
00:18:17,353 --> 00:18:18,874
we wanted to build on the relationships

353
00:18:18,914 --> 00:18:20,314
that we'd created to build that game.

354
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:24,396
And we wanted to work together as one team under one vision.

355
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:28,698
So we actually utilized the skill sets of nine other teams, led from Ubisoft Quebec,

356
00:18:29,218 --> 00:18:32,379
to utilize the skill sets of multiple different studios around the world,

357
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,500
all focusing together and channeling their energy on this one vision,

358
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,502
making sure that we could build a world that was cohesive and playable as one whole thing.

359
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,363
So next came the world phasers.

360
00:18:44,304 --> 00:18:46,786
Now this phaser system isn't something

361
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,167
that's brand spanking new.

362
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:49,528
It's not rocket science, but it's something

363
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:51,189
that I've been working, the way I've been working

364
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:53,631
for many years, working back on games like Need for Speed.

365
00:18:54,172 --> 00:18:56,273
And it's a way of making sure that we can clearly define

366
00:18:56,354 --> 00:18:59,556
at separated gates how the world's gonna be

367
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:01,738
and how you're gonna be able to play inside of that world

368
00:19:01,878 --> 00:19:04,060
at any different given time during production.

369
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:13,994
So we knew that the scope of what we were trying to do was huge, so we needed to make sure we worked in a disciplined way to make sure we could make informed decisions at each step of the production process.

370
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,935
So phase one was all about learning.

371
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:18,577
So we'd been doing all this research,

372
00:19:18,597 --> 00:19:20,219
we'd gone back to school, we'd been getting help

373
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:21,821
from a historian who was now in-house,

374
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:24,284
but it was now time for the team to get that empowerment.

375
00:19:24,304 --> 00:19:26,867
It was time for the level artists, level designers,

376
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:28,869
texturers, narrative team, everyone to start

377
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:30,190
to understand this information.

378
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,852
So at this point in the project,

379
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,696
the level artists and level designers are working together

380
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:35,977
as one world-building team.

381
00:19:37,018 --> 00:19:42,459
learning each other's skill set, understanding how each other's disciplines are important to each other.

382
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:46,660
And they start to work on the information that we've put together as a group,

383
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,620
and they start to input into that information.

384
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,001
So we created lots of documentation, and this one specifically was interesting

385
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:57,242
because it was a visual map that we created that had a host of different elements of information

386
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,542
that could be tapped into, looking into the actual historical data

387
00:20:00,582 --> 00:20:02,543
of each of the different regions of ancient Greece.

388
00:20:03,023 --> 00:20:04,904
tapping into the trade, the population,

389
00:20:04,984 --> 00:20:07,505
whether it was an oligarchy or a monarchy,

390
00:20:08,286 --> 00:20:09,646
how big their army was,

391
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:12,348
especially what kind of things they were making or doing,

392
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:14,489
because that tapped into then what we wanted to do

393
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:16,190
with that region to give it its thematic.

394
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,452
From that, the team then started to build

395
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:21,573
their own world documents, which we could then look into,

396
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:24,254
giving them the creativity to take all this information

397
00:20:24,295 --> 00:20:27,116
we've been giving them and start to build up the plans

398
00:20:27,196 --> 00:20:28,577
for what they want to do with the world

399
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:29,958
and how the world's going to be built

400
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:31,238
based around this information.

401
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,726
As part of the phase one, we built what we call the paper maps.

402
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:39,447
So we created 2D Photoshop maps of every single region of the world.

403
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:42,848
And we looked into how the topology was going to work.

404
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:46,308
What we were going to see in terms of, is it going to be foresty?

405
00:20:46,368 --> 00:20:47,889
Is it going to be fields?

406
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:50,550
And what kind of cultivation is going to be happening?

407
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,110
And we did this for the entire Greek world before we did anything in 3D,

408
00:20:54,491 --> 00:20:57,931
allowing us to communicate clearly with each of the different departments

409
00:20:58,311 --> 00:20:59,072
what they were going to get.

410
00:20:59,312 --> 00:21:01,732
Obviously, this is not final, things are going to change.

411
00:21:02,172 --> 00:21:04,973
But it allowed the quest team to start looking at where their quest hubs are going to be.

412
00:21:05,273 --> 00:21:08,334
The narrative team could tap into the different thematics we were planning on doing,

413
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:09,874
so they could write stories around that

414
00:21:10,214 --> 00:21:13,255
and start to decide where key characters are going to be positioned throughout the world.

415
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:18,254
So there comes thematization or pizza slice

416
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:20,275
as we love to call this.

417
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:24,319
So building such a massive world made out of tons of cities,

418
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:29,523
villages, sanctuaries, and everything you can think of.

419
00:21:29,844 --> 00:21:32,046
For us, thematization was super important

420
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,168
because we didn't want our player to have a sentiment

421
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:36,930
or deja vu as we say in French.

422
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,553
So we work a lot with thematization and simplification.

423
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:42,435
So let's say, for example, within a city.

424
00:21:43,117 --> 00:21:46,458
like Athens, which would be made out of several districts.

425
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:48,959
Each district had their own thematic,

426
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,400
so let's say the pottery zone will have only potteries

427
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,781
and maybe oven to cook potteries,

428
00:21:52,821 --> 00:21:55,122
but we would avoid placing too much prop in it

429
00:21:55,162 --> 00:21:56,823
so the player could easily identify

430
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:59,404
what that region was about.

431
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:02,185
And we did that same recipe throughout the old world

432
00:22:02,205 --> 00:22:04,126
to make sure that the player will never encounter

433
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:05,707
the same recipe all over the place.

434
00:22:08,992 --> 00:22:12,094
With the documentation and paper maps in place and approved,

435
00:22:12,154 --> 00:22:14,636
we started to look at how the terrain was going to work.

436
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,597
The terrain forms the foundation of everything

437
00:22:16,617 --> 00:22:17,138
we're going to do.

438
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:19,700
And it was incredibly important to the ancient Greeks.

439
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,421
They used the terrain very logically

440
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:23,503
to use it for fortification and use it

441
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:25,724
for where they're going to plan to place their cities.

442
00:22:26,165 --> 00:22:29,267
So we referenced elements such as digital elevation data

443
00:22:29,287 --> 00:22:31,008
from NASA, a lot of Google Earth.

444
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:33,130
I think a lot of people were zooming in on Greece

445
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,291
quite often during this project.

446
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,452
And then as well as that, the reference that we took

447
00:22:36,492 --> 00:22:38,754
when we went out to Greece to build up a visual picture

448
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:41,296
of the simplification of the terrain at this point,

449
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:43,658
so that we could create these honeycomb elements

450
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:45,059
around the different regions of the game.

451
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:47,060
And jumping forward a little bit,

452
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,922
what we did with that terrain then was hand it off

453
00:22:48,962 --> 00:22:50,243
to our three terrain artists

454
00:22:50,323 --> 00:22:53,505
who covered the entire 256 square kilometers of Greece,

455
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:56,988
working that basic terrain through Mudbox,

456
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:58,849
sculpting it into something that's more defined,

457
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,271
and then adding the erosion paths through World Machine

458
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:02,852
to give us the final version of the terrain

459
00:23:02,872 --> 00:23:04,073
that we see in the game today.

460
00:23:06,423 --> 00:23:09,045
So now that our terrain was giving shape,

461
00:23:09,465 --> 00:23:11,907
we could start kicking in the biome team and the loop.

462
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:14,288
So under the leadership of Rensana Muteng,

463
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:15,889
which was the biome leader,

464
00:23:16,949 --> 00:23:17,810
we established that

465
00:23:20,175 --> 00:23:23,337
The world needed great visual diversity,

466
00:23:23,657 --> 00:23:25,699
so the biome played a key role into that.

467
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,921
So we had to make sure that each of our biome

468
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,342
were contrasted from one another.

469
00:23:30,482 --> 00:23:32,664
And in fact, there's probably two biome in Greece,

470
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,126
but we decided to play with season and exotic biome

471
00:23:35,146 --> 00:23:37,107
to make sure that the land look and feel different

472
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:37,787
as an overall.

473
00:23:38,828 --> 00:23:40,909
So here we did apply the same technique

474
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:42,130
as we did for everything else.

475
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,851
Based on our study and research,

476
00:23:44,251 --> 00:23:46,893
we started to create like elevation stripes.

477
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:49,995
So based, we took so many picture

478
00:23:50,075 --> 00:23:51,916
and we found also picture all over the place.

479
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:54,177
We established like which type of plant

480
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:57,479
were growing at different type of elevation

481
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,520
in the Greek landscape,

482
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,402
because that's how our biome recipe

483
00:24:01,422 --> 00:24:03,123
were applied by per elevation.

484
00:24:03,723 --> 00:24:06,845
So we did that same technique for every biome.

485
00:24:06,885 --> 00:24:07,585
And once we were.

486
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,363
happy with the result and making sure that each biome look and feel different from one another,

487
00:24:12,443 --> 00:24:17,947
we could start the production of them. So when we do a biome, we need to produce every asset

488
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:25,132
that takes place in it. So we need to produce all the trees, bushes, clutter, name it. There's a lot

489
00:24:25,152 --> 00:24:32,317
of them. And also we needed to produce all the textures for all those vegetation assets. And

490
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,918
the same thing applies to the rocks, boulders, ground textures.

491
00:24:36,189 --> 00:24:38,350
For this production, and we'll talk it very soon,

492
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,210
we use substance designers, substance painters

493
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,571
to produce all our material and texture.

494
00:24:45,872 --> 00:24:47,713
Water, Ben briefly talked about water,

495
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:49,273
but the water play a massive role

496
00:24:49,293 --> 00:24:50,574
in our role in gameplay experience.

497
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:54,235
Since 60 percent of our world's surface is made out of water,

498
00:24:54,355 --> 00:24:56,236
we try to create the most awesome

499
00:24:56,276 --> 00:24:59,337
and diversified experience when it comes to water,

500
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:00,717
and we treat it as a main character.

501
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:05,618
So we wanted to be able to convey a feeling of embarking on a true odyssey,

502
00:25:05,658 --> 00:25:08,967
which means being able to travel by boat and engage in naval combat.

503
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,383
So the agency is the host of many dangers and treasures

504
00:25:12,443 --> 00:25:13,924
which will tempt the player to set sail,

505
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:16,506
explore its farthest reach and dive into its depth.

506
00:25:17,126 --> 00:25:19,148
And so we are pretty happy to have created

507
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:20,669
a seamless naval experience.

508
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:27,293
So here you'll see the first volumetric foam

509
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:31,095
and crashing wave test that we did with our friends

510
00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:34,437
in Bucharest which were in charge of our water.

511
00:25:34,477 --> 00:25:37,419
So flowing wave and volumetric foam were super important

512
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:38,240
in the big challenge.

513
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:41,144
As you can see, it's even lagging because it's a prototype.

514
00:25:41,385 --> 00:25:46,272
But once we saw that, we knew that we had something very special in our end,

515
00:25:46,352 --> 00:25:49,658
and we are more than happy with the in-game result that we have right now.

516
00:25:52,406 --> 00:25:55,669
But even with seven key biomes, we thought it was not enough.

517
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,173
Our landscape is so huge that we needed more.

518
00:25:59,233 --> 00:26:01,835
So we've created sub-biomes to make sure

519
00:26:01,855 --> 00:26:04,879
to offer the most visual diversity to our players.

520
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:09,203
So we've created here the clay mine, the snow peak,

521
00:26:09,263 --> 00:26:12,226
cap mountains, marshland, and also burnt forest as example.

522
00:26:16,098 --> 00:26:18,279
So running in parallel with the biome work,

523
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,240
the world building team are starting to put together

524
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,120
what we called phase three, which is gray blocking.

525
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,841
Again, not a new notion whatsoever.

526
00:26:24,241 --> 00:26:27,082
The one thing that was incredibly important to us

527
00:26:27,482 --> 00:26:29,462
was to make sure that we did this gray blocking pass

528
00:26:29,482 --> 00:26:31,303
for the entirety of the Greek landscape

529
00:26:31,363 --> 00:26:32,863
so that we could make informed decisions

530
00:26:32,943 --> 00:26:34,584
on how things were laying in the land,

531
00:26:34,664 --> 00:26:36,984
the relationship between the urban sanctuaries

532
00:26:37,024 --> 00:26:38,145
and villages and cities

533
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:40,285
and the natural terrain and landscape

534
00:26:40,645 --> 00:26:43,806
so that we could move forward with a logical step

535
00:26:43,846 --> 00:26:44,746
at each phase of the way.

536
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:48,009
but also so that the entire game could be played very, very early on.

537
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:51,412
You could explore the entire world and we could have the Quest team play it

538
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:53,234
and they could start planning where things are going to be,

539
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,157
sight lines between quest givers and quest objectives.

540
00:26:56,457 --> 00:26:58,859
So it was very important for us to get this in very, very quickly.

541
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,863
The top two screens there are actually from Athens that we built in 2016

542
00:27:03,303 --> 00:27:05,565
and the layout of Athens hasn't really changed that much.

543
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:07,367
It's just that we've evolved on it over time.

544
00:27:08,356 --> 00:27:11,819
One of the other big things that Thierry tapped on as one of our six key points was the notion of

545
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,264
two weekly sprints. So every two weeks we would get together with the entire team

546
00:27:17,584 --> 00:27:21,528
and showcase the work of the world team. And this was the entire world, we'd make a video

547
00:27:21,748 --> 00:27:26,472
over the weekend before the week before, the presentation would be on the Monday,

548
00:27:26,852 --> 00:27:32,397
and we could showcase to everybody the world that was going to be available to play that week in the build.

549
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,740
and it allowed us to have constant communication,

550
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,101
constant feedback from the team,

551
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:39,205
and be able to see the progression of the world

552
00:27:39,385 --> 00:27:40,126
as we move forward.

553
00:27:41,228 --> 00:27:43,550
To do that, we're gonna need architecture, and lots of it.

554
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:46,534
So this was the product owner for architecture,

555
00:27:46,574 --> 00:27:47,796
who is Dominique Ladut-Party.

556
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:51,197
who had a lot of experience working on previous Assassin's Creed titles,

557
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:55,499
so he was a great person to take on the architecture mandate for us during Odyssey.

558
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:59,220
And again, he started the process, and you'll hear us repeat this a couple of times more,

559
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,402
making sure he tapped into the historical information that was available for architecture,

560
00:28:03,422 --> 00:28:08,964
because while the notion of Greek architecture is something I think most people can picture,

561
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:13,825
the number of details and fine elements that actually go into making these buildings is incredible,

562
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:16,707
and it was important for us to make sure that we built them in a correct manner.

563
00:28:17,915 --> 00:28:19,756
So throughout our research, we've learned something

564
00:28:19,796 --> 00:28:20,917
that we did not expect.

565
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,338
Archaeologists have found that everything

566
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:24,719
was painted back then.

567
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,760
So from an art direction point of view,

568
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,121
that kind of was a blessing.

569
00:28:28,221 --> 00:28:31,323
So we took that opportunity and add colors

570
00:28:31,383 --> 00:28:32,864
almost all man-made structures,

571
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:37,247
which gave us a very unique, incredible way

572
00:28:37,327 --> 00:28:40,509
of how ancient Greece could have looked like

573
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:42,830
2,500 years ago, which I think is fairly incredible.

574
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,711
So historically, colors have always been seen

575
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:48,912
as a status symbol, and our collective tastes

576
00:28:48,932 --> 00:28:50,472
have definitely changed over centuries.

577
00:28:50,532 --> 00:28:53,293
So seeing those statues, classic statues,

578
00:28:53,593 --> 00:28:55,294
recreated in vivid colors seems gaudy,

579
00:28:55,354 --> 00:28:56,494
almost obscene to us today,

580
00:28:56,514 --> 00:28:58,855
because we expect ancient Greek statuary

581
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,176
to bear that dignified blank white look.

582
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:03,257
But then when they were created,

583
00:29:03,317 --> 00:29:05,477
bright colors helped them to give detail

584
00:29:05,497 --> 00:29:06,678
and depth to the sculptures,

585
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,598
and even according to the artists

586
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:10,159
and art lover of that time period.

587
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:13,425
their statues were considered ugly and unsightly.

588
00:29:13,946 --> 00:29:16,008
So that's why you're seeing a lot of painted statues

589
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:18,272
in Assassin's Creed Odyssey, because we wanted to stay true

590
00:29:18,312 --> 00:29:19,954
to how they were back then.

591
00:29:21,734 --> 00:29:24,917
But just because we're making a game based in history doesn't mean we're making a recreation.

592
00:29:24,957 --> 00:29:28,321
There's still an awful lot of creativity that goes into building this world.

593
00:29:28,721 --> 00:29:31,424
And we relied heavily on our concept artists, especially early on,

594
00:29:31,484 --> 00:29:35,828
because like we said, a lot of the things that we were going to try and build in our game don't exist anymore.

595
00:29:35,868 --> 00:29:38,931
They're merely just bricks in the ground, or in most cases,

596
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:42,154
they've been rebuilt on top of from many other civilizations.

597
00:29:42,735 --> 00:29:44,316
So with all this information about color,

598
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:48,620
we started to tap into the concept of how we were going to compose the different elements of the game,

599
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:54,244
especially for some of the things like the suburbs and places that aren't concentrated on so much by archaeologists.

600
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:57,467
And they were able to start producing these strips that we created

601
00:29:57,527 --> 00:29:59,408
that would then be used by the world building team

602
00:29:59,469 --> 00:30:02,151
to build the composition of cities and villages throughout the world.

603
00:30:02,491 --> 00:30:04,212
But also looking at the materials and the colors,

604
00:30:04,593 --> 00:30:06,654
a lot of elements in Greece were actually built out of wood,

605
00:30:06,694 --> 00:30:08,256
which was something that we never expected.

606
00:30:08,756 --> 00:30:12,083
So wooden temples was something that was a bit of a surprise to us and allowed us to bring a

607
00:30:12,163 --> 00:30:15,189
flavor and a thematic to Greece that I think most people didn't expect to see.

608
00:30:16,517 --> 00:30:17,738
As well as that, we wanted to be,

609
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,940
it was important to us to make sure we tapped into

610
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,562
the history beyond the history that we were recreating.

611
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,703
So the ancient Greeks of our time period

612
00:30:25,743 --> 00:30:28,925
were aware of the Mycenaean and the Minoan civilizations

613
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:31,027
that had come before, so it was important for us

614
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:33,289
to make sure we captured that, and the team went ahead

615
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:35,330
and made the Mycenaean and Minoan kits for us

616
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,351
to be able to utilize on the world-building side

617
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:39,133
to create some of the really interesting POIs

618
00:30:39,153 --> 00:30:41,755
that you can explore, play, and in most cases, fight in.

619
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:46,631
Here's a few examples of some of the other architecture kits that were built for the project.

620
00:30:47,152 --> 00:30:53,058
In total we built over 35 architecture kits and while you see them on this big one page there's a lot of similarities between them.

621
00:30:53,458 --> 00:31:05,170
As we mentioned before it's all about the fine details making sure that the columns are the correct type of column making sure that the pediments the correct type of pediment and these details were something that we really wanted to pay attention to to make a credible world.

622
00:31:07,505 --> 00:31:11,470
I think you will all agree that a world without texture would be missing something.

623
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:15,694
So of course we have texture in Assassin's Creed Odyssey, but we did change something

624
00:31:15,734 --> 00:31:16,475
in our pipeline.

625
00:31:17,196 --> 00:31:21,160
And that wouldn't have been possible without the help of those two guys who did the talk

626
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,584
on Tuesday and it's available, it's called Texturing the World of Assassin's Creed.

627
00:31:25,204 --> 00:31:29,349
So Vincent Desrosiers and Pierre Flo did make this change happen.

628
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:30,050
So what?

629
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,192
Prior to Assassin's Creed, I'd say most of the time,

630
00:31:33,212 --> 00:31:34,513
textures were created in Photoshop

631
00:31:34,553 --> 00:31:38,197
and exported in our in-house engine, which is Anvil.

632
00:31:38,757 --> 00:31:40,919
It's a proven technique. It's working very well.

633
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:44,022
It can give awesome results,

634
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:48,165
but we wanted something more homogeneous.

635
00:31:49,606 --> 00:31:53,109
And also that would react well under every lighting condition,

636
00:31:53,149 --> 00:31:55,311
so we wanted all our materials to be PBR,

637
00:31:55,351 --> 00:31:56,973
which means physically based rendering.

638
00:31:57,466 --> 00:32:00,908
So we integrated substance designer, substance painter

639
00:32:00,948 --> 00:32:02,248
throughout our pipeline.

640
00:32:02,729 --> 00:32:07,811
So meaning that every texture were, material were built using

641
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:08,632
those two software.

642
00:32:09,192 --> 00:32:12,273
And also what they did is they used both software strings.

643
00:32:12,293 --> 00:32:16,215
So they used painter and substance main key points to

644
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:17,316
create our materials.

645
00:32:17,956 --> 00:32:19,657
So the thing is the whole thing.

646
00:32:20,057 --> 00:32:23,299
converted and started to use those software as an overall.

647
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:25,821
So every texture that you're seeing in Assassin's Creed Odyssey

648
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:28,022
have been created using those two software.

649
00:32:28,923 --> 00:32:32,204
They've created a total of 1,500 textures

650
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:35,867
with a relatively small team, which is very good.

651
00:32:35,907 --> 00:32:36,287
And the other...

652
00:32:36,947 --> 00:32:40,692
big aspect of working with substance designers is that we can iterate and very

653
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:45,357
fast. It's a procedural software so we could ask for changes and they could

654
00:32:45,598 --> 00:32:49,602
react very fast and we could then polish our game which was a bit more difficult

655
00:32:49,903 --> 00:32:50,864
using the old technique.

656
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,370
So the next part of the project,

657
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,951
we're around about halfway through at this point,

658
00:32:55,991 --> 00:32:57,051
about one and a half years in,

659
00:32:57,211 --> 00:32:59,171
was what we called phase four, which was intent.

660
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:00,812
So at this point of the project,

661
00:33:00,952 --> 00:33:02,272
especially on the world building side,

662
00:33:02,312 --> 00:33:04,073
was the first time we actually split the team

663
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:06,414
between level art and level design specific disciplines

664
00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:08,014
so that we could start to focus in

665
00:33:08,394 --> 00:33:10,755
on the very key details of each of the two disciplines.

666
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,436
The level designers making sure

667
00:33:12,476 --> 00:33:14,896
that they could make the most fun areas that they could,

668
00:33:15,196 --> 00:33:16,917
concentrating on the forts, the caves,

669
00:33:17,317 --> 00:33:19,558
making sure that the tombs were fun to explore

670
00:33:19,618 --> 00:33:21,818
and navigate and had a little bit of challenge and puzzle.

671
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:25,802
while at the same time the level artists were making sure that the placement of every single

672
00:33:26,102 --> 00:33:30,746
object in the world was just perfect. So this came down to the two product owners for each

673
00:33:30,766 --> 00:33:35,350
of the disciplines. Mathieu Lechance was lead level designer and Safi Sader was in charge

674
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,954
of the level art and these guys were the guys responsible for pushing the world to what we call

675
00:33:40,075 --> 00:33:40,315
alpha.

676
00:33:41,196 --> 00:33:50,008
So Alpha for us was one year before launch, an incredibly important milestone for us to ensure that we've got enough time to be able to polish the world to its full max that we can,

677
00:33:50,388 --> 00:33:55,135
making sure that we can change the world and tweak the world to make sure that the quests have got everything that they need,

678
00:33:55,455 --> 00:33:58,840
and we can tell the stories that we want the player to experience as they travel around the world.

679
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:01,870
To do this, we made some pretty cool tools,

680
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,730
and here's just a couple.

681
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,891
This is one of my favorites. It's called the Cave Tool.

682
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:06,912
It was built by a multidisciplinary team,

683
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:09,194
and it allowed us to be able to create Lego kits

684
00:34:09,294 --> 00:34:11,815
that had a logical system with a logical UI

685
00:34:12,075 --> 00:34:13,736
that could allow pretty much anyone on the team,

686
00:34:13,796 --> 00:34:15,097
and we tested it with producers,

687
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,458
and producers could make caves that were fun.

688
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:18,678
They had lighting.

689
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,420
They had navigation, parkour, and collectibles,

690
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,461
and this system allowed us to create the vast amount of caves

691
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:25,762
that we built throughout the world.

692
00:34:26,162 --> 00:34:28,303
The system was built on top of the Entity Maker,

693
00:34:28,363 --> 00:34:31,345
which was a tool that was created to tap into,

694
00:34:31,425 --> 00:34:33,506
allow us to create the numerous statues

695
00:34:33,526 --> 00:34:34,306
that you see in the world.

696
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:36,647
There's thousands and thousands of different iterations

697
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:39,749
of the statues, and basically it was built on the same system.

698
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:42,671
Lego kit statues that could plug into each other,

699
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:44,411
all with logic and data to make sure

700
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:46,272
you couldn't do wacky different poses.

701
00:34:46,773 --> 00:34:48,694
And we also used the same system for the market

702
00:34:48,734 --> 00:34:50,254
so that we could allow the level artists

703
00:34:50,294 --> 00:34:51,775
to concentrate on doing cool stuff

704
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:54,416
instead of placing pots after pots.

705
00:34:55,217 --> 00:34:55,697
After pause.

706
00:34:56,118 --> 00:34:57,683
And there's a lot of props in our game.

707
00:34:59,047 --> 00:35:01,213
So speaking of prop, in order to make a vibrant,

708
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:03,721
and vibrant, and dense world, we needed a lot of props.

709
00:35:04,343 --> 00:35:06,443
So the proctor-coroner for the props

710
00:35:06,724 --> 00:35:09,324
was responsible for the creation of the props

711
00:35:09,344 --> 00:35:11,845
for the entire world and to ensure that each of them

712
00:35:11,885 --> 00:35:13,265
were compliant with the technical

713
00:35:13,305 --> 00:35:14,526
and also gameplay guidelines.

714
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,607
So the props were under the leadership of Ariane Trottier.

715
00:35:18,207 --> 00:35:20,647
So since most of the props have long time gone,

716
00:35:20,808 --> 00:35:23,448
since our time period was 2,500 years ago,

717
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,929
we needed to add the concept artists into that team.

718
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:31,410
to conceptualize needs given by either the quest designer,

719
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:34,451
level artist, level designer as well.

720
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:38,771
So they could actually illustrate those prop

721
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:39,811
that don't exist anymore.

722
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:43,192
The team was also responsible for making all the boats

723
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,092
that you see in the game.

724
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:45,472
So they did all the archetypes,

725
00:35:45,653 --> 00:35:49,233
like the Spartan, Athenian, and also pirate boats.

726
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:50,593
But also they did the player boat

727
00:35:50,613 --> 00:35:54,114
with all this customization and also upgrades.

728
00:35:55,296 --> 00:35:57,598
They did all the statues in Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

729
00:35:57,618 --> 00:35:59,920
There's a lot of statues, around 120 of them.

730
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,503
And it adds up with the Entity Maker

731
00:36:04,523 --> 00:36:06,105
where you can make tons of variation

732
00:36:06,445 --> 00:36:08,086
of most of the statues.

733
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:11,529
So they've been doing also all the props

734
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:13,591
that were placed in the Entity Maker

735
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:14,532
as been as just shown.

736
00:36:15,392 --> 00:36:16,974
And of course, all the texture and material

737
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:19,335
used or created for those prop

738
00:36:19,355 --> 00:36:20,957
were done also in Substance Designer

739
00:36:21,037 --> 00:36:23,559
and Substance Painter, sorry about that.

740
00:36:24,611 --> 00:36:30,519
So in Assassin's Creed Odyssey, we've created around 4,000 props, which is a lot, but they

741
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,125
were used in specific regions, so it helped us to thematize each zone of the world.

742
00:36:36,047 --> 00:36:40,172
So we've created a showroom to have an overview because there were so many of them, so the

743
00:36:40,212 --> 00:36:41,714
main challenge was to use them all.

744
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,812
So we've now built a beautiful world.

745
00:36:46,252 --> 00:36:47,914
It's got incredible gameplay.

746
00:36:47,954 --> 00:36:48,755
It's fun to play in.

747
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:51,119
But it's not yet a living world, and our goal

748
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,220
was to create a living world.

749
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,783
So this is where we brought in Mikiel Lejaguar-Gigal.

750
00:36:54,803 --> 00:36:56,145
That's a bit of my Quebec co-author

751
00:36:56,165 --> 00:36:57,887
that I learned while I was up there.

752
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,630
And he was the product owner for Living World.

753
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:05,354
What Mike did is, surprise, surprise, he did his research and working with a historian,

754
00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:09,737
we made sure that he understood the people of ancient Greece, how the people lived, how they

755
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:14,179
worked, where they slept, what tools they used, what did they wear, did they wear hats. Hats

756
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:16,381
became incredibly important for some reason at some point.

757
00:37:18,182 --> 00:37:23,825
So he basically went in and did all of that research and then started working with his team to build the living world of Ancient Greece.

758
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:31,769
So building on top of the meta AI system that was created for Assassin's Creed Origins, an incredibly powerful tool that meant that each NPC in the world has their own schedule.

759
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:37,432
They need to go to work, they need to go to sleep, they need to go and pee, and they will have their life and they will do it.

760
00:37:37,812 --> 00:37:41,795
So you can follow them around and you can watch people as they move around the world living their life.

761
00:37:42,435 --> 00:37:49,120
One of the new things that we brought for Assassin's Creed Odyssey was the fact that they would actually not just do this live without paying attention to you, the player.

762
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,044
If you get caught by an NPC in Assassin's Creed Odyssey doing something that you shouldn't do, the thing that we introduced was the notion of smart objects.

763
00:37:56,405 --> 00:38:00,027
An NPC will react to the fact that you are doing something that you shouldn't be.

764
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:03,432
If they're a courageous person, they will then go and find a nearby prop.

765
00:38:03,472 --> 00:38:06,496
It might be a spade, it might be a shovel, it might be a sword if they're lucky.

766
00:38:06,797 --> 00:38:09,801
And they'll bring that fight to you so that the loop of fighting continues.

767
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:12,144
And some of them are pretty tough to beat as well.

768
00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:14,848
This also included the animal pass.

769
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:20,275
We created over 450 individually motion captured stations

770
00:38:20,315 --> 00:38:21,696
for Assassin's Creed Odyssey,

771
00:38:21,796 --> 00:38:23,458
and we also built all of the props that we needed

772
00:38:23,478 --> 00:38:25,480
to make sure that they were using the correct items

773
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,380
that they would do.

774
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:29,403
But also using the system of Metair AI,

775
00:38:29,503 --> 00:38:31,525
it created thousands of different possibilities

776
00:38:31,705 --> 00:38:33,367
of living world scenarios that you could see

777
00:38:33,407 --> 00:38:34,568
taking place throughout the world.

778
00:38:35,678 --> 00:38:40,321
This also moved on to animals. We also wanted to bring mythology to the world

779
00:38:40,341 --> 00:38:43,363
and we haven't talked about it much but we drenched the world in different

780
00:38:43,383 --> 00:38:46,765
mythology and one of the ones we tapped into was the 12 labors of Hercules.

781
00:38:47,145 --> 00:38:50,767
So scattered throughout the world are these incredibly awesome legendary animals

782
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:54,109
and these were part of the open living world that you could experience as you

783
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:54,669
traveled around.

784
00:38:56,632 --> 00:38:58,634
So we're coming towards the end of production at this point

785
00:38:58,674 --> 00:38:59,875
and we move into phase five,

786
00:38:59,915 --> 00:39:01,596
which is what we call the final level pass.

787
00:39:01,616 --> 00:39:02,537
It's the quality pass.

788
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:05,420
At this point, level artists are really taking the time

789
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,963
to move each little item just a few centimeters,

790
00:39:09,364 --> 00:39:11,185
checking it from every angle like they like to do

791
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:12,847
and making sure it's perfect.

792
00:39:13,207 --> 00:39:15,169
At the same time, the level designers are making sure

793
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:16,991
that all of the NPCs have got everything they need

794
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:18,232
to fulfill their actions,

795
00:39:18,372 --> 00:39:19,673
make sure that if you attack a fort,

796
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:21,435
they've got all the weapons they need to attack you.

797
00:39:21,936 --> 00:39:26,081
make sure they've got places that they can go and sleep and go and eat without leaving the fort undefended,

798
00:39:26,182 --> 00:39:27,543
which did happen at one point.

799
00:39:28,124 --> 00:39:32,811
And we're getting to the point now where we're making a world that's starting to feel like it's ready to be played.

800
00:40:02,605 --> 00:40:03,926
So it's nearly the end, guys.

801
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:07,749
So by remaining true to our vision, focus, and discipline

802
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:09,650
in how we worked, trusting in each other,

803
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:13,693
we were able to create a world that we wanted to create

804
00:40:13,733 --> 00:40:15,855
while keeping the game engaged and empowered

805
00:40:16,295 --> 00:40:17,476
without any major scope.

806
00:40:18,276 --> 00:40:20,138
And then building at the same time the foundation

807
00:40:20,178 --> 00:40:22,379
that was for a game that was critically acclaimed.

808
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,882
So for us, the six keywords, the thing that changed.

809
00:40:26,649 --> 00:40:30,433
Everything to this production is that we started to do our own work.

810
00:40:30,613 --> 00:40:31,694
We gathered the knowledge.

811
00:40:32,095 --> 00:40:33,336
We didn't rush in production.

812
00:40:33,376 --> 00:40:36,279
We took the time to get to know about what was ancient Greece.

813
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,982
We studied so much, and not only at the beginning,

814
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:40,143
but throughout the whole production.

815
00:40:40,183 --> 00:40:43,206
And even today, we still think we can learn about ancient Greece.

816
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:50,613
Essential to the to the products as well was the team engagement and empowerment by giving product ownership to the experts. We

817
00:40:50,653 --> 00:40:55,955
were able to tap into their their knowledge and expertise to allow them to control their own vision control their own

818
00:40:55,995 --> 00:41:02,798
quality control their own backlog and really build upon their own department which were filtering down into the quality that we

819
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:03,318
ended up with.

820
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:06,120
On top of that, the world phases by sticking to that.

821
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,861
We rigidly fought for that to make sure

822
00:41:07,881 --> 00:41:09,822
that we could continuously build the world up

823
00:41:09,862 --> 00:41:11,744
in these different layers from beginning to end

824
00:41:11,804 --> 00:41:13,945
to make sure that we could continuously

825
00:41:13,985 --> 00:41:16,467
make empowered decisions as we worked.

826
00:41:16,787 --> 00:41:18,868
Yes, and the integration of Substance Designer

827
00:41:18,908 --> 00:41:21,250
and Painter to our pipeline truly changed things.

828
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,132
Not only gave us the homogeneity we were looking for,

829
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:26,673
but it gave us the possibility to iterate easily

830
00:41:26,973 --> 00:41:28,755
so we can polish the game quite a lot.

831
00:41:29,485 --> 00:41:33,627
The sprint review every two weeks also at first was perceived as a big burden by most teams,

832
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:39,870
but then the turnaround happened and people were quite happy to showcase what they were working on.

833
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:42,110
It helped us greatly on the communication side,

834
00:41:42,571 --> 00:41:45,692
so everyone could have inside the vision of their old project,

835
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,713
so it proven to be very efficient for us.

836
00:41:48,766 --> 00:41:51,049
Sounds super cliched, but we're making a video game,

837
00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:52,611
so having fun was definitely something

838
00:41:52,651 --> 00:41:53,612
that was important for us.

839
00:41:53,672 --> 00:41:55,594
We're like two kids, so we like to mess about,

840
00:41:55,634 --> 00:41:57,957
so it was important the rest of the team got to mess about too.

841
00:41:58,418 --> 00:41:59,860
And I think that's something that you can see

842
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,441
as you play the game for yourself.

843
00:42:01,802 --> 00:42:02,022
True.

844
00:42:02,743 --> 00:42:05,206
So I can speak for Ben, and I want

845
00:42:05,226 --> 00:42:07,809
to ask that we're the most proud of is definitely the fact

846
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:08,630
that as a team.

847
00:42:08,987 --> 00:42:10,968
we've managed to produce this massive world,

848
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,529
and it was an enormous challenge.

849
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,631
And we did it, built it, always trying to improve the game,

850
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:18,173
frequently questioning ourself, having the courage

851
00:42:18,213 --> 00:42:19,234
to change things when needed.

852
00:42:19,874 --> 00:42:22,156
So the willingness and the commitment of the team

853
00:42:22,216 --> 00:42:24,378
is something that we're definitely proud of.

854
00:42:25,439 --> 00:42:27,340
So that's it, guys.

855
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,261
This is the end of our presentation.

856
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:30,702
We hope you enjoyed it.

857
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:32,003
Thank you very much.

858
00:42:44,047 --> 00:42:47,330
Before we jump into questions, we've got somebody who's just got a message for everybody in

859
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:47,610
the room.

860
00:42:48,811 --> 00:42:52,274
Alexios, tell us when AC Japan's coming out.

861
00:42:53,975 --> 00:42:56,737
Let me tell you what I know about Assassin's Creed Japan.

862
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,300
Nothing!

863
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:04,203
There is no place more glorious than Sparta!

864
00:43:17,545 --> 00:43:19,246
So if some of you have any questions,

865
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:20,587
there's a mic in the room.

866
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:27,891
Hello, first off, brilliant talk, thank you very much.

867
00:43:30,097 --> 00:43:32,318
It was a really tiny part of the presentation,

868
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:35,020
but you touched on a cave tool that you built.

869
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,421
And it was just after you spoke about level designers

870
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:38,442
and artists working together.

871
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:41,923
Can you just talk through the process

872
00:43:42,023 --> 00:43:44,785
that you went through with creating those small caves?

873
00:43:44,865 --> 00:43:48,747
Obviously, was it a case of the artist fed the tool,

874
00:43:48,827 --> 00:43:50,568
and the designers built the caves from that?

875
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:54,270
And overall, how many cave systems

876
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,450
did you end up building for the game?

877
00:43:56,952 --> 00:43:59,073
So in terms of process, it definitely wasn't art driven.

878
00:43:59,113 --> 00:44:01,293
It was a multidisciplinary team that got together.

879
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,094
So we had a level designer, level artist,

880
00:44:03,154 --> 00:44:04,854
and technical director that was in the room

881
00:44:05,654 --> 00:44:07,535
when we first kicked off building that tool.

882
00:44:08,615 --> 00:44:09,995
And it needed that technical input

883
00:44:10,035 --> 00:44:12,636
to make sure we had all the data labeled correctly.

884
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:15,657
It was very much design driven from that point onwards,

885
00:44:15,837 --> 00:44:18,497
building out all of the gray block versions of the caves

886
00:44:18,557 --> 00:44:20,318
to create all the pieces that we need

887
00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:22,638
to create interesting navigational routes,

888
00:44:22,998 --> 00:44:25,459
make sure we're hitting all the different lighting requirements

889
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:26,199
in terms of GI.

890
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,921
And then once we got that locked down,

891
00:44:29,061 --> 00:44:30,882
we got the art team involved with building

892
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:32,404
the actual final versions of the cave,

893
00:44:32,424 --> 00:44:33,445
because they're expensive, right?

894
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:35,426
So we want to make sure that we've got it right

895
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:36,387
before we move forward.

896
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:41,111
And then it was kind of empowerment for level designers

897
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:43,252
and artists to be able to create caves in the world.

898
00:44:43,673 --> 00:44:46,315
And we ended up with, I think off the top of my head,

899
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:48,817
it's about 400 cave systems in the world.

900
00:44:48,837 --> 00:44:50,138
Thanks very much.

901
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:55,445
Hello. So if you look at a game like Zelda Breath of the Wild,

902
00:44:55,605 --> 00:44:58,427
they're super disciplined about reserving certain colors,

903
00:44:58,527 --> 00:45:01,649
silhouettes, and shapes for their visual language

904
00:45:01,689 --> 00:45:04,810
to communicate gameplay information diegetically in the world.

905
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:08,572
And I'm pretty sure you have a very different process than they did,

906
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:11,474
but I'm curious whether you have any high-level rules

907
00:45:11,614 --> 00:45:15,356
or takeaways from developing a visual language like that in your world.

908
00:45:16,277 --> 00:45:21,779
Yeah, absolutely we did. We created a palette of objects that were going to be utilized by the different factions throughout the game.

909
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:26,762
So the military had their specific types of asset that we would use to communicate.

910
00:45:26,782 --> 00:45:30,904
Okay, you're going to get involved with the military at this point, so you know what kind of gameplay you're going to get.

911
00:45:31,324 --> 00:45:35,426
And then similarly the different factions of the game, the daughters of Artemis, the followers of Ares,

912
00:45:35,746 --> 00:45:40,808
they had a very specific palette of props that we used to communicate clearly as you were arriving.

913
00:45:41,149 --> 00:45:44,131
And then on top of that, we layered the dynamic banners

914
00:45:44,231 --> 00:45:46,634
with the logos and things to really just push it on.

915
00:45:46,694 --> 00:45:48,756
After iterating it through play test,

916
00:45:48,796 --> 00:45:50,337
we just wanted to make sure that was hammered home.

917
00:45:51,278 --> 00:45:51,478
Thanks.

918
00:45:52,734 --> 00:45:58,597
So the scale of your world is really impressive and the sheer amount of detail you're packing

919
00:45:58,637 --> 00:46:00,138
into pretty much every square meter.

920
00:46:00,698 --> 00:46:06,902
I was wondering if you could talk at all about your approach to working with a world on that

921
00:46:06,962 --> 00:46:14,086
scale like did you use procedural techniques and how do you manage so many artists working

922
00:46:14,326 --> 00:46:15,586
on one world at the same time?

923
00:46:17,157 --> 00:46:21,040
Well, of course, we did use procedural generation,

924
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,641
especially for the biome.

925
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:25,844
So every plant, trees that you see that are not in cities

926
00:46:25,924 --> 00:46:27,906
are procedurally generated.

927
00:46:28,927 --> 00:46:31,188
So that's one of the...

928
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,491
Without that, it would have been impossible

929
00:46:34,551 --> 00:46:36,873
to put that word on the box

930
00:46:36,913 --> 00:46:38,635
because there's so many ground to cover.

931
00:46:39,395 --> 00:46:39,836
And the...

932
00:46:42,442 --> 00:46:43,282
Managing artists?

933
00:46:43,683 --> 00:46:47,105
Yeah, the world is so big that it was kind of easy to manage

934
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:50,188
every artist because they've been put in each section.

935
00:46:50,228 --> 00:46:52,910
So each of them had their own sections to work on.

936
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:56,552
The workload was shared also with other studios.

937
00:46:56,572 --> 00:46:58,394
Singapore was heavily involved with the islands

938
00:46:58,434 --> 00:46:59,515
that you see in the game.

939
00:47:00,055 --> 00:47:03,378
So each artist or group of artists had their own zone.

940
00:47:03,438 --> 00:47:04,498
So it was quite simple.

941
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:06,180
Plus we had rock star leads as well.

942
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:10,260
I'm just curious, how do you split up the world between artists?

943
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:15,293
Do they check out tiles of the world, or do they work on that data in other ways?

944
00:47:16,529 --> 00:47:18,590
So the system that we've got is a little bit more dynamic

945
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:19,671
than checking out tiles.

946
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,212
But what we tried to do, so in the early phases,

947
00:47:23,272 --> 00:47:25,173
we were actually very kind of hippy

948
00:47:25,273 --> 00:47:26,734
with how we worked on the world

949
00:47:26,774 --> 00:47:27,554
to make sure that we could,

950
00:47:28,014 --> 00:47:30,055
everyone kind of got a little bit of input into everything.

951
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:31,836
And then as we got throughout the phases,

952
00:47:31,876 --> 00:47:33,337
we started to solidify the world,

953
00:47:33,357 --> 00:47:35,037
we also started to solidify the team.

954
00:47:35,217 --> 00:47:37,518
So then we'd have a level artist, level designer,

955
00:47:37,558 --> 00:47:38,879
by an owner who'd be working together

956
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:40,120
specifically on a region

957
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,900
so that we had clear points of contact.

958
00:47:42,841 --> 00:47:43,361
Thank you very much.

959
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:58,147
So one of my favorite things about Origins was the history that went into all the work and essentially just like using historians to discover things that we didn't actually know before some of the research that your company had done.

960
00:47:58,987 --> 00:48:04,870
Is there you know how how much of that did you did happen with Odyssey and is there any chance of a discovery tour as well?

961
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:08,171
I think that was one of the most fantastic things about Origins.

962
00:48:10,067 --> 00:48:10,848
So I'll jump onto that one.

963
00:48:10,868 --> 00:48:12,990
So the world actually, we really,

964
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:15,672
it was really important to us to tap into the history.

965
00:48:15,732 --> 00:48:17,473
So pretty much everything we put in the game,

966
00:48:17,513 --> 00:48:20,135
even though there's a massive amount of creativity,

967
00:48:20,536 --> 00:48:23,979
has some fine, some type of historical link back to it.

968
00:48:23,999 --> 00:48:26,280
So if it's a mythical statue we've placed out

969
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,903
in the countryside, it relates back to a paragraph

970
00:48:28,943 --> 00:48:30,644
of a book somewhere that's been researched

971
00:48:30,704 --> 00:48:31,905
and we're tapping into that.

972
00:48:32,505 --> 00:48:34,306
And then when it comes, so they're actually all in the game

973
00:48:34,326 --> 00:48:37,128
and there is actually a massive amount of historical detail

974
00:48:37,288 --> 00:48:39,989
in the historical POIs that most people don't find.

975
00:48:40,029 --> 00:48:41,390
You have to change the filter on the map.

976
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:45,712
And yes, I can confirm that there will be a Discovery Tour

977
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:46,913
for Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

978
00:48:46,933 --> 00:48:48,754
Awesome.

979
00:48:48,834 --> 00:48:49,254
APPLAUSE

980
00:48:53,236 --> 00:48:54,177
I think we're going to go that way.

981
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,001
Yeah, hi.

982
00:48:55,441 --> 00:48:58,542
So first of all, thank you so much for coming down and

983
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,542
sharing your insights with us.

984
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:00,623
The talk was really amazing.

985
00:49:00,823 --> 00:49:01,183
Loved it.

986
00:49:02,104 --> 00:49:05,485
I was really impressed by the amount of research, the extent

987
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,846
of research that had gone into the project right from the

988
00:49:07,886 --> 00:49:08,426
very beginning.

989
00:49:09,387 --> 00:49:12,288
I wanted to know, because I know that there are a lot of

990
00:49:12,348 --> 00:49:14,869
companies out there that still do not invest the amount of

991
00:49:14,909 --> 00:49:16,490
time and budget in research.

992
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:17,930
So what does it take?

993
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:21,912
How much of a budget goes into researching before you actually

994
00:49:21,952 --> 00:49:23,012
get started with a project?

995
00:49:24,393 --> 00:49:30,265
and how would you encourage younger companies to invest time in research and development

996
00:49:30,305 --> 00:49:33,652
before they actually get into production for a project?

997
00:49:34,732 --> 00:49:37,214
So I won't talk about it in terms of money cost,

998
00:49:37,234 --> 00:49:38,535
but in terms of people cost,

999
00:49:38,655 --> 00:49:39,776
it was incredibly important to us.

1000
00:49:39,816 --> 00:49:41,837
And like Thierry said, as one of the takeaways,

1001
00:49:42,137 --> 00:49:44,318
the fact that we put that time up front was important

1002
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:46,500
because not only did we start to learn more

1003
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,581
about what we were dealing with,

1004
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:49,842
but also being an Assassin's Creed game,

1005
00:49:49,882 --> 00:49:51,343
history was incredibly important.

1006
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,064
And we want to make sure that we do justice

1007
00:49:53,104 --> 00:49:54,745
to the culture that we're working with as well.

1008
00:49:54,785 --> 00:49:57,587
It's a Greek culture, it's rich, it's very passionate.

1009
00:49:57,627 --> 00:50:01,109
We wanted to make sure we were looking at that properly.

1010
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,010
And I just say that,

1011
00:50:03,951 --> 00:50:11,264
Doing that homework up front was definitely a benefit and if you're going to be doing something along those lines, it's definitely worthwhile.

1012
00:50:11,665 --> 00:50:12,406
All right. Thank you.

1013
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:16,209
Thanks for the great presentation.

1014
00:50:16,649 --> 00:50:19,790
I would like it if you could touch a little bit

1015
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,531
about VFX integration with the world,

1016
00:50:22,911 --> 00:50:25,151
and at what point did you start integrating things

1017
00:50:25,251 --> 00:50:28,152
like the weather systems and other interactive effects,

1018
00:50:28,232 --> 00:50:32,273
ambient effects, and did the world artists

1019
00:50:32,353 --> 00:50:34,653
or anybody else have to do anything in particular

1020
00:50:34,713 --> 00:50:38,034
to make the world work well with those effects?

1021
00:50:39,424 --> 00:50:47,617
We started right from the beginning working on our time of day and weather system and we iterated on them throughout the whole production until we were satisfied with it.

1022
00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:52,701
The workload for the artist is mostly on the material and texture, so they had to make

1023
00:50:52,741 --> 00:50:57,382
sure that when it's raining, let's say, those materials will go wet and reflective.

1024
00:50:58,623 --> 00:50:59,383
And also the wind.

1025
00:50:59,543 --> 00:51:06,446
The wind has a huge impact on the perception of weather, so we had to make sure that our

1026
00:51:06,586 --> 00:51:10,467
trees and every process, in fact, that has tissues and stuff like that, would react well

1027
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:10,947
to the wind.

1028
00:51:12,828 --> 00:51:13,168
Thank you.

1029
00:51:13,288 --> 00:51:13,528
Thank you.

1030
00:51:15,553 --> 00:51:20,418
I am super interested in hearing more about the processes of the historical research that

1031
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:21,039
went into it.

1032
00:51:21,419 --> 00:51:25,924
You mentioned that you guys consulted with a historian who later became an in-house historian,

1033
00:51:26,485 --> 00:51:31,630
and I wanted to ask what their job is like, what are their duties, what contributions

1034
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:34,493
does that particular position give to the project?

1035
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:37,240
I'll speak for Stephanie.

1036
00:51:38,421 --> 00:51:41,684
She's basically a powerhouse who knows everything

1037
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,305
we needed to know about the history of Greece.

1038
00:51:43,365 --> 00:51:46,267
But also, being a doctor in this already,

1039
00:51:46,307 --> 00:51:47,528
she knows how to research.

1040
00:51:47,668 --> 00:51:48,729
And that was the important thing,

1041
00:51:48,749 --> 00:51:50,991
was she knew where to go to get the information, which

1042
00:51:51,051 --> 00:51:51,971
book she needed to read.

1043
00:51:52,352 --> 00:51:55,034
And literally, her desk was just littered with books.

1044
00:51:55,134 --> 00:51:56,755
And they're everywhere, right?

1045
00:51:57,295 --> 00:51:58,416
She can read ancient Greek.

1046
00:51:58,656 --> 00:52:00,918
Yeah, she can read ancient Greek.

1047
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:02,899
And she was reading books that I think probably

1048
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,822
haven't been read by anyone for many, many years.

1049
00:52:06,962 --> 00:52:10,065
And finding things that probably haven't been read again

1050
00:52:10,145 --> 00:52:10,785
for many, many years.

1051
00:52:10,825 --> 00:52:12,747
So there's things that we were able to put into it,

1052
00:52:12,987 --> 00:52:15,629
into the world, that probably people

1053
00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:17,790
didn't expect because it had been forgotten somewhere.

1054
00:52:18,171 --> 00:52:19,031
That is awesome.

1055
00:52:19,091 --> 00:52:19,451
Thank you.

1056
00:52:24,337 --> 00:52:24,557
Hi.

1057
00:52:25,077 --> 00:52:26,317
First off, wonderful talk.

1058
00:52:26,497 --> 00:52:28,057
Thank you so much.

1059
00:52:28,658 --> 00:52:30,098
Something I'm really curious about

1060
00:52:30,118 --> 00:52:33,579
is you said that there are 10 different studios working

1061
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:34,419
on the same project.

1062
00:52:34,919 --> 00:52:37,460
So all across the world, different time zones

1063
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,320
and everything.

1064
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:43,701
And how did art directing so many teams work?

1065
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:46,001
And how were you able to keep them all on the same page?

1066
00:52:46,702 --> 00:52:47,142
Caffeine.

1067
00:52:49,182 --> 00:52:50,963
Yeah, well, there's caffeine, of course.

1068
00:52:51,303 --> 00:52:51,423
But.

1069
00:52:52,463 --> 00:52:56,325
The thing that every studio has its own art director or associate art director,

1070
00:52:56,545 --> 00:53:01,627
so they are managing their team on their side. And we talk about trusting people.

1071
00:53:01,647 --> 00:53:07,650
You know, as art directors, you establish a frame, but it's to your people to define what's

1072
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:12,112
within the frame. So, of course, we're always there as director to make sure that the vision

1073
00:53:12,152 --> 00:53:16,133
stays true to the initial intent, but then it's up to them to put the...

1074
00:53:16,846 --> 00:53:20,269
water to the mill, so they were all participants

1075
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:22,791
in the overall art direction of the game in a way.

1076
00:53:23,632 --> 00:53:25,934
And then we did the weekly communication with them,

1077
00:53:25,954 --> 00:53:27,615
like conf, call on link, Skype.

1078
00:53:28,656 --> 00:53:29,997
So sometimes it was morning for us,

1079
00:53:30,158 --> 00:53:31,839
evening for them, and vice versa.

1080
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:34,642
So we do try to, because the secret of that

1081
00:53:34,702 --> 00:53:36,543
is communication, so we need to talk with them

1082
00:53:36,603 --> 00:53:37,764
the more often as possible.

1083
00:53:38,445 --> 00:53:38,885
Thank you.

1084
00:53:38,985 --> 00:53:39,326
Thank you.

1085
00:53:40,627 --> 00:53:40,907
Hey there.

1086
00:53:41,627 --> 00:53:45,314
I'm curious what the relationship between the researcher and the directors were.

1087
00:53:45,674 --> 00:53:46,876
Was it a good relationship?

1088
00:53:46,916 --> 00:53:47,938
Was there ever any tension?

1089
00:53:51,894 --> 00:53:54,655
When we came up with history for the win, that was a good day.

1090
00:53:54,855 --> 00:53:57,757
So, no, Stephanie was incredible and we worked very closely together.

1091
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:04,181
So when we were defining a lot of the early on research and we were starting to put things on maps and put things into documents,

1092
00:54:04,221 --> 00:54:06,562
she was involved in pretty much every single meeting.

1093
00:54:07,222 --> 00:54:12,826
Like I said, she's a powerhouse, Stephanie, and she worked like crazy for us throughout the project.

1094
00:54:14,287 --> 00:54:16,207
just the amount of information she was bringing to us,

1095
00:54:16,267 --> 00:54:18,028
it was always something new for us to play with.

1096
00:54:18,728 --> 00:54:21,969
And I wouldn't say that there was tension,

1097
00:54:22,029 --> 00:54:24,030
but she obviously wanted to make sure

1098
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:26,231
everything we were doing is as credible as possible.

1099
00:54:27,211 --> 00:54:29,252
So whenever we got a little bit too crazy

1100
00:54:29,292 --> 00:54:31,653
with our creativity, she'd try and rein us back in again.

1101
00:54:31,673 --> 00:54:33,033
And that was the only time where we had

1102
00:54:33,073 --> 00:54:34,074
kind of the ying and the yang,

1103
00:54:34,554 --> 00:54:36,935
and we feel like we managed to balance everything.

1104
00:54:37,735 --> 00:54:38,015
Thank you.

1105
00:54:41,982 --> 00:54:44,524
You mentioned procedural tools for the terrain generation,

1106
00:54:44,584 --> 00:54:45,845
as well as for the vegetation.

1107
00:54:46,546 --> 00:54:48,207
And also you had this cool thing about the statues,

1108
00:54:48,227 --> 00:54:49,147
which was really inspiring.

1109
00:54:49,608 --> 00:54:50,328
What about the buildings?

1110
00:54:50,568 --> 00:54:51,849
Were they all individually created,

1111
00:54:51,869 --> 00:54:54,171
or was there any kind of way to automate some of that?

1112
00:54:55,092 --> 00:54:58,074
Well, all the level art that you see in the game is placed by hand.

1113
00:54:58,574 --> 00:55:01,036
So, but though working with the architecture,

1114
00:55:01,056 --> 00:55:02,777
it's made out of modules,

1115
00:55:02,817 --> 00:55:05,499
so we can assemble like houses and kits.

1116
00:55:06,413 --> 00:55:07,954
The all gain of that is memory.

1117
00:55:08,094 --> 00:55:11,275
So we can, it's a relation of the same module.

1118
00:55:11,315 --> 00:55:14,557
So, but everything that you see that is level art

1119
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:15,577
is basically made by hand.

1120
00:55:15,597 --> 00:55:17,778
So we have exclusion zone in our world.

1121
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:20,800
So where the vegetation won't be generated.

1122
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,161
So it's kind of off the map.

1123
00:55:22,461 --> 00:55:24,342
So we have ton of those area and those area

1124
00:55:24,382 --> 00:55:27,723
were very work in detail by our level artists.

1125
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:33,551
And of course, the final message.

1126
00:55:34,612 --> 00:55:38,476
Ubisoft are hiring, so if you're interested in joining us on one of our incredible projects,

1127
00:55:39,156 --> 00:55:41,919
you can visit the Ubisoft lounge on the second floor of the West Hall.

1128
00:55:42,279 --> 00:55:43,900
There'll be people there to chat with you.

1129
00:55:44,701 --> 00:55:45,562
Thank you very much for coming.
