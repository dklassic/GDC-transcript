00:00:05,763 --> 00:00:08,083
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:11,885
Welcome to my very brief presentation

3
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:15,846
on the VFX process behind Battleborn,

4
00:00:15,846 --> 00:00:18,326
where I'm just going to kind of scratch

5
00:00:18,326 --> 00:00:24,068
the surface of how we came about to create our game's

6
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:25,909
very unique style of VFX.

7
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:31,070
So before we get started, I would like to introduce myself.

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,210
My name is Ashley Lyons.

9
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:37,425
And I'm one of the senior VFX artists at Gearbox Software,

10
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:39,567
where in addition to Battleborn,

11
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:42,169
I also worked on Borderlands the pre-sequel.

12
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:43,389
And I've currently been at Gearbox

13
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:44,910
for a little over five years.

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,813
So for those of you who are unfamiliar with Battleborn,

15
00:00:48,813 --> 00:00:52,696
I'd like to show you just a quick video introduction

16
00:00:52,696 --> 00:00:56,358
featuring some of the VFX that we'll be discussing today.

17
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:25,566
So threatening!

18
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:20,137
All right.

19
00:02:20,137 --> 00:02:22,539
Okay, so what is Battleborn?

20
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:27,602
Essentially, Battleborn is a fast-paced,

21
00:02:27,602 --> 00:02:30,484
lighthearted team FPS with a stylized aesthetic,

22
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,206
and it incorporates MOBA-like elements.

23
00:02:33,206 --> 00:02:36,388
All right, so now that the introductions

24
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:40,171
are out of the way, during today's presentation,

25
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:44,794
the topics that I'm gonna be covering

26
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:46,916
are why we decided to feature stylized effects,

27
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,692
how we concepted many of our ideas,

28
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:53,913
and finally, how we implemented those ideas

29
00:02:53,913 --> 00:02:55,334
to come about with our final product.

30
00:02:55,334 --> 00:03:00,657
So why did we decide to go with this specific stylized look?

31
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:05,659
Well, for one, it was a great way to stand out

32
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:07,080
amongst other FPS games.

33
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,201
And by doing so, it allowed us to create

34
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:11,182
some super creative and original VFX.

35
00:03:11,182 --> 00:03:16,685
And, the characters themselves were...

36
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,932
they had this already exaggerated look to them,

37
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:24,876
and by adding in our specific effect style,

38
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:27,938
we were able to complement and enhance

39
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:29,359
the already cartoon-like aesthetic.

40
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:34,884
And finally, the animated VFX also really complemented

41
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:36,285
our already colorful environments.

42
00:03:36,285 --> 00:03:41,309
All right, so one of the nice things about deciding

43
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:44,612
on our stylized look was the ability.

44
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:48,758
to experiment with different techniques and styles,

45
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:52,279
which also led itself to the creative investigation

46
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,520
of trying to land a specific look.

47
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,181
And having visual effects somewhat based in reality,

48
00:03:57,181 --> 00:04:01,022
in my opinion, tends to somewhat restrict an artist

49
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:04,144
to how far visually that realistic style can be pushed.

50
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:08,045
But with Battle Born, we were able to experiment

51
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:11,186
with many different variations of the same type of effect.

52
00:04:11,186 --> 00:04:14,247
So in addition, sorry, in certain cases,

53
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:20,033
we would have five or six different types of explosions going off

54
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:24,357
and each one would look and feel entirely different from the other.

55
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:34,346
So, for example, this is one of them.

56
00:04:34,346 --> 00:04:34,866
And here's another.

57
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:45,244
And one more.

58
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:59,108
Okay, so during the concepting part of Battleborn,

59
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:01,108
we were fortunate enough to gain the talents

60
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:01,748
of Michel GagnÃ©.

61
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:04,709
If you're not familiar with Michel's work,

62
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:07,890
he has been an effects animator on The Iron Giant,

63
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,351
the My Little Pony movie,

64
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:13,132
and most recently Into the Spider-Verse.

65
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:17,550
Now, Michel is an amazing animator,

66
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,050
but when we first started working with him,

67
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,171
he was unfamiliar with Game VFX

68
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:24,252
in regards to what we wanted.

69
00:05:24,252 --> 00:05:26,632
But he did have Game VFX experience

70
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:29,493
in the form of Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet,

71
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:32,154
which is a 2D platformer.

72
00:05:32,154 --> 00:05:34,294
So getting into first-person shooters

73
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:35,495
was something entirely new for him.

74
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:36,315
This is an early effects concept image.

75
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:47,893
where we were trying to imagine how one character's

76
00:05:47,893 --> 00:05:50,854
ultimate would cast during our game.

77
00:05:50,854 --> 00:05:53,254
So Michelle was off-site the majority of the time,

78
00:05:53,254 --> 00:05:56,135
so explaining some of the details of our requests

79
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:58,056
at first was kind of difficult.

80
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:00,316
But in a few months time, we eventually developed

81
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:02,477
a system that would maximize our time

82
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:04,977
and work began to flow a lot more steadily.

83
00:06:04,977 --> 00:06:07,778
So basically, it was just a lot of video conferencing

84
00:06:07,778 --> 00:06:09,058
and instant messaging.

85
00:06:10,964 --> 00:06:14,286
But once we got all the initial growing pains out of the way

86
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:17,188
our feedback to Michel became a lot faster

87
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:22,050
and his iterations on our VFX assets followed suit.

88
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,052
And this is a closer look at the concept image from earlier.

89
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,114
So I'm using this as an example of one of the methods

90
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:32,436
that we use to concept our ideas.

91
00:06:32,436 --> 00:06:36,878
So what we have here is Michel's initial ideas

92
00:06:36,878 --> 00:06:39,340
drawn over still frames of the game animation.

93
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:45,816
So with this in hand, we would go over it and basically figure out what works, you know,

94
00:06:45,816 --> 00:06:53,718
what won't work, and you know, what might need to, what might need to be altered later. Now, we

95
00:06:53,718 --> 00:06:59,440
have another effects artist on staff. He's an effects animator named Sung Kim, and he

96
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,981
worked very closely with Michelle, and he had the most contact with him.

97
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:06,620
So Song would be the one that drew the in-betweens

98
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,882
of the animation assets, and he would get everything ready

99
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:11,343
to be imported into our game engine.

100
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:15,346
And once development on the game was complete,

101
00:07:15,346 --> 00:07:21,750
we had well over 30,000 frames of individual animation.

102
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,013
See, and here are a few more constant images

103
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,795
like the ones before that were worked on

104
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:31,496
both by Song and Michelle.

105
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:38,780
So over the course of the game development,

106
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,781
our creativity grew and expanded

107
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:44,582
with our animation requests.

108
00:07:44,582 --> 00:07:49,903
So for example, if we wanted a type of basic ground impact,

109
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,284
so Michelle would animate that for us.

110
00:07:52,284 --> 00:07:55,185
Eventually, we fell into the groove of Battleborn's,

111
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:57,205
you know, like, we fell into the groove

112
00:07:57,205 --> 00:08:00,806
of Battleborn's universe, and a basic ground impact

113
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:03,107
would turn into something closer to this.

114
00:08:20,024 --> 00:08:24,005
Also, towards the end of development,

115
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:28,447
so we started to notice that many of our older assets

116
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:30,627
weren't up to the standards of what we were currently,

117
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:33,228
you know, what were currently being produced.

118
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:35,629
So we actually had to go back and polish

119
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:36,789
many of those older assets,

120
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,650
giving them like a more precise and crisp look

121
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,631
akin to something that was being, you know,

122
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:45,792
being worked on at the time.

123
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:49,213
So this is an example of one of those reworked assets.

124
00:08:49,784 --> 00:08:56,970
for one of our, one of our characters named Miko.

125
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,993
And here we have another example.

126
00:08:59,993 --> 00:09:02,575
So as you can see, the later asset,

127
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,477
the one on the right,

128
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,900
is, has a much cleaner look with less usage of gradients.

129
00:09:16,187 --> 00:09:19,209
So one of the advantages of having two animators

130
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:22,151
on the effects team was being given the opportunity

131
00:09:22,151 --> 00:09:27,214
to observe and then apply some of the principles

132
00:09:27,214 --> 00:09:29,995
of animation to our effects, namely timing,

133
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:33,637
anticipation, exaggeration, and secondary action,

134
00:09:33,637 --> 00:09:38,020
which in turn aided us in having our effects

135
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,241
mimic the character animations.

136
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:44,964
So each animation asset was drawn frame by frame,

137
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:45,264
meaning.

138
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,261
no frames were skipped.

139
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:50,782
If a flipbook needed 36 frames,

140
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:53,863
then 36 frames of animation were drawn.

141
00:09:53,863 --> 00:09:55,804
So nothing was animated and then shortened

142
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:59,025
or frames cut to fit a certain frame length.

143
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:02,467
So because of that, we were able to break down

144
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:04,847
whatever animation asset we were using,

145
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:07,889
examine the frames, and integrate that technique

146
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,589
used into whatever particle effect

147
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:10,810
that we were creating at the time.

148
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:21,824
So this is that last image animated.

149
00:10:21,824 --> 00:10:25,287
And this is that image, that asset in game.

150
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:42,099
So being able to break down the animations by frame,

151
00:10:42,469 --> 00:10:46,030
also aided us in incorporating the technique

152
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:50,612
of adding a quick spark, like a spark type effect,

153
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:52,073
to many of our explosions.

154
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:56,194
So many times the spark itself would be random shapes

155
00:10:56,194 --> 00:11:03,257
or almost unnoticeable, but it did aid us with the timing

156
00:11:03,257 --> 00:11:06,158
and giving them a little something extra.

157
00:11:06,158 --> 00:11:07,839
So this is an image of some early concept sparks.

158
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,780
And these are some explosions with that spark.

159
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:26,770
technique added in.

160
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:34,675
So in order to maximize our texture space, Michelle and Song came up with a frame rate

161
00:11:34,675 --> 00:11:38,938
guide that helped them better organize each texture sheet according to how many frames

162
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:41,280
of animation were needed for each asset.

163
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:47,790
And at the end, in addition to the 30,000 frames

164
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,351
of hand-drawn animation, we ended up with

165
00:11:50,351 --> 00:11:54,294
well over 3,600 individual particle effects.

166
00:11:54,294 --> 00:12:03,861
Okay, so developing a style guide.

167
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:06,884
And with all that was going on in Battleborn,

168
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:11,587
we needed a style guide in order to keep things consistent.

169
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,702
We had five different factions with a total

170
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,465
of 30 different characters in each faction,

171
00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:21,727
and each character had their own custom stylized effects.

172
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:26,191
So by creating this style guide,

173
00:12:26,191 --> 00:12:28,933
we were able to cement the look of each faction

174
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:31,015
while still keeping each character's effects

175
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:33,097
feeling uniquely their own.

176
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:38,541
So for example, we had the Generate faction,

177
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,683
which is in the bottom left.

178
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:45,957
which incorporated mostly stark red geometric shapes

179
00:12:45,957 --> 00:12:49,360
compared to the Eldred faction in the top right,

180
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,182
which consisted of more organic and natural tones.

181
00:12:52,182 --> 00:13:03,692
And here is an example of an effect from the Eldred faction.

182
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:08,996
And in this effect is actually from the LLC faction.

183
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:12,614
which is a group that focused mostly on money

184
00:13:12,614 --> 00:13:14,714
and robots, like robotics,

185
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:18,335
which we represented with electric blue

186
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:19,635
and some golden yellow hues.

187
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:30,418
So once we acquired the animation assets for a character,

188
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:33,099
we would begin assembling and adding them

189
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:36,380
into our materials and particle effects.

190
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,300
So each asset we kept at around two to three colors.

191
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:41,834
with little to no gradients,

192
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:46,598
sorry, with little to no gradients in them.

193
00:13:46,598 --> 00:13:50,200
This was in order to keep colors consistent

194
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,663
once we began gray packing everything.

195
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:55,444
So unless we actually needed a,

196
00:13:55,444 --> 00:13:58,867
unless we needed a specific color,

197
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:02,329
most of the stuff that we did was gray packed.

198
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:04,731
So if you are unfamiliar with the process of gray packing,

199
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:07,553
it's where you just store a black and white texture

200
00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:09,895
into the red, green, or blue channels.

201
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:12,029
of a single texture.

202
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:13,990
So at the end of the project,

203
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:19,214
we had gray-packed about 90% of the VFX textures.

204
00:14:19,214 --> 00:14:23,056
So in order to have our 2D animations exist

205
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:25,698
in our 3D environment,

206
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:30,662
our particle effects use many different types of meshes,

207
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,543
each with a specific UV mapping

208
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:36,526
to give each animation that extra dimension it needed.

209
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:38,967
In this example here, you can see a,

210
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:43,770
couple of concepts for a whirlwind type effect.

211
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,851
So in order to achieve a similar look

212
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:45,632
of the hand-drawn concept,

213
00:14:45,632 --> 00:14:50,517
we did include the UV mapping mesh strips,

214
00:14:50,517 --> 00:14:53,200
which did wrap around like a central core.

215
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,862
And this is that final whirlwind effect.

216
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:18,296
And this is another example of how an asset

217
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:21,519
would go from concept to an in-game effect.

218
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,282
So here we have the initial concept for this nuke impact.

219
00:15:25,282 --> 00:15:28,585
And as fantastic as this animation looks,

220
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:30,967
applying it in-game as a one-to-one asset

221
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:33,249
would not work from all directions.

222
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:34,891
So with something like we just saw,

223
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:36,252
we would tell Michelle,

224
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:40,756
imagine that you are looking directly down into it.

225
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:41,577
How would that look?

226
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:45,670
And this right here is that concept broken down

227
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,890
into two of its core elements.

228
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:58,113
And this is the in-game effect for that nuke explosion.

229
00:15:58,113 --> 00:16:00,814
So as you can see, many of the animations

230
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:03,134
are mapped onto a variety of meshes

231
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:06,235
in order to give that effect a more volume,

232
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:09,836
like more volume and escape that flat billboard type look.

233
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:24,186
So getting each effect to work with their specific character

234
00:16:24,186 --> 00:16:27,887
resulted us in, as I had mentioned earlier,

235
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:31,508
applying the principles of animation.

236
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:34,849
Sorry, applying the principles of animation.

237
00:16:34,849 --> 00:16:40,790
Namely, squash and stretch and timing.

238
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,152
With the exaggerated look of our character animations,

239
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:48,072
many of the effects needed to correspond

240
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:50,413
and match with their respective characters.

241
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:55,378
As a result, this conveyed a sense of ownership

242
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:57,659
to every effect of its player character.

243
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:02,422
So for example, this is Pendels.

244
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:07,024
He is a bipedal snake assassin

245
00:17:07,024 --> 00:17:10,886
whose passive ability was this slight invisibility.

246
00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:15,148
Like he gave off this predator type shimmer during the game.

247
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:19,904
So we had the idea of giving him this ninja vanish

248
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:23,687
like smoke puff whenever he did activate his passive.

249
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:26,850
And on top of that, we also decided to give him

250
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:31,695
a snake theme for all of his effects.

251
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:36,319
And here's his smoke bomb that he does before his passive

252
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,760
broken down into some of its main parts.

253
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,365
So this right here is the main part of the smoke bomb.

254
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,882
This is another part, and as you can see,

255
00:17:51,882 --> 00:18:00,587
it's a heavily implied snake theme.

256
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:08,292
And here we have more snakes.

257
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:10,393
And this is the smoke bomb effect in game.

258
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,243
So another example I have is the character Ernest.

259
00:18:24,243 --> 00:18:26,404
And as you can see, he's like a bird.

260
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:29,546
And so many of his effects were egg, yoke,

261
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:30,286
and feather-based.

262
00:18:30,286 --> 00:18:39,991
So here's one.

263
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:41,772
And another one's very yoke-like.

264
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:48,937
And we have some feathers.

265
00:18:54,929 --> 00:19:14,280
And this is an earnest effect in-game.

266
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,582
Okay, so one of the things we fought with heavily

267
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:19,563
in creating Battleborn's VFX

268
00:19:19,563 --> 00:19:23,185
was avoiding what we on the team called effects soup.

269
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:27,357
or basically color vomit,

270
00:19:27,357 --> 00:19:29,559
which basically meant having too many effects

271
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,942
on the screen at once.

272
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:34,043
So with the nature of the effects we were making

273
00:19:34,043 --> 00:19:38,327
and how easily it was to get carried away with it,

274
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:43,312
it was a challenge straddling the line of over the top

275
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:45,714
versus over abundance.

276
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:49,878
So to dial back much of what we put into the game,

277
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:56,539
we held numerous critiques within the effects team itself.

278
00:19:56,539 --> 00:19:59,681
And we also used player feedback

279
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:00,721
from a lot of our play tests.

280
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:06,324
In addition to that, we also did a huge polish pass

281
00:20:06,324 --> 00:20:10,887
at the end of development where we added a fade

282
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:13,088
to all of the particle systems

283
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,809
any time the player got close to them.

284
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:17,490
So that also helped cut down on too much

285
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,812
impeding the player's view during the game.

286
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:26,718
Okay.

287
00:20:26,718 --> 00:20:27,318
So, in conclusion,

288
00:20:27,318 --> 00:20:30,240
with the experience of Battleborn behind me,

289
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,382
here are some of the things that I would recommend

290
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:39,124
when considering incorporating stylized effects

291
00:20:39,124 --> 00:20:42,266
into your game.

292
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:44,007
You should ask yourself

293
00:20:44,007 --> 00:20:47,269
why use stylized effects in the first place,

294
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:50,351
and how will this decision affect your game?

295
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:52,212
So once you know the answer to that question,

296
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:57,414
You can ask yourself, is the universe cohesive?

297
00:20:57,414 --> 00:21:00,295
Does everything belong?

298
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:02,837
If you're going to add a specific effect style

299
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:06,298
into your games, like I said, does it belong there?

300
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:13,481
Now, once you're ready to go into the concepting part,

301
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,703
don't be afraid to try new things

302
00:21:16,703 --> 00:21:20,725
and really go wild with the type of effects

303
00:21:20,725 --> 00:21:21,445
that you can create.

304
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:24,409
but also know when to dial it back.

305
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:27,631
You want to avoid that effects soup look.

306
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:30,774
And also consider this,

307
00:21:30,774 --> 00:21:33,857
think of effects not only as screen filler

308
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:37,640
or a way to cover up transitions in animations,

309
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,302
but also as a character in itself.

310
00:21:40,302 --> 00:21:42,804
Give them life, give them attitude,

311
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:44,446
give them personality.

312
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:49,791
Really push the limits of what you can achieve.

313
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,182
Okay, so with that being said,

314
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:57,305
thank you all for coming to my very brief presentation

315
00:21:57,305 --> 00:21:59,327
on Battleborn's visual effects.

316
00:21:59,327 --> 00:22:02,290
I'd also like to thank Michelle Gagne

317
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:06,354
and the Gearbox effects team.

318
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:08,056
They helped me with this a lot.

319
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:10,679
I'd like to thank GDC,

320
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,281
and thank you audience for coming to see my presentation.

321
00:22:21,678 --> 00:22:24,540
And if you like, you can follow me on Twitter.

322
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,400
That's my handle.

323
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,662
Let's see, thank you again.

324
00:22:28,662 --> 00:22:30,142
And if there are any questions,

325
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:32,243
feel free to step up to the mic at this time.

326
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:37,414
Hey, how are you?

327
00:22:37,414 --> 00:22:37,514
Hi.

328
00:22:37,514 --> 00:22:40,295
Thanks for the presentation.

329
00:22:40,295 --> 00:22:42,515
I noticed you showed mostly the 2D assets.

330
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:45,516
How much emissive or different properties inside of the engine

331
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:48,957
did you guys apply to the effects?

332
00:22:48,957 --> 00:22:50,457
How much emissive?

333
00:22:50,457 --> 00:22:54,378
Right, like different things that you didn't showcase here.

334
00:22:54,378 --> 00:22:56,938
Different emissive properties or anything.

335
00:22:56,938 --> 00:23:01,199
OK, so you want to know how much emissives we added to the-

336
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:02,139
I guess non-2D aspects.

337
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:03,499
Non-2D assets.

338
00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:04,900
Emissive-wise.

339
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:09,957
I think it misses.

340
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:11,658
Maybe you didn't do any.

341
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:14,760
It's, well, it was, we did add, like, a lot of it was

342
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,222
the basic 2D assets that you did see,

343
00:23:18,222 --> 00:23:24,166
but we did add a lot of, like, simulated smoke effects,

344
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,666
some fire effects and things like that,

345
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:29,149
so we did not, so we didn't just stick with the 2D assets,

346
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:32,010
like, as just, like, one-to-one, but, like, we did add,

347
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,232
you know, just basic.

348
00:23:34,973 --> 00:23:37,334
as smoke, like as you saw with the Pendle's effect,

349
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:39,595
we did add some gradient smokes.

350
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:42,916
One of the things we wanted to avoid a lot of

351
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:45,917
was we wanted to avoid a lot of gradients

352
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:49,539
and just kind of adding things that didn't look like

353
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:51,880
they belonged in the world, if that makes sense?

354
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,220
Sure.

355
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,341
Yeah, so we did add, like we did add them,

356
00:23:55,341 --> 00:23:58,422
but it was very, on a smaller scale.

357
00:23:58,422 --> 00:24:01,043
Like we were very, we kind of wanted to restrict ourselves

358
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:01,383
and kind of.

359
00:24:01,835 --> 00:24:06,156
and going too far from the hand-drawn 2D look.

360
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:06,636
Okay.

361
00:24:06,636 --> 00:24:07,276
That makes sense.

362
00:24:07,276 --> 00:24:07,956
Yep, thanks.

363
00:24:07,956 --> 00:24:08,896
Thanks.

364
00:24:08,896 --> 00:24:16,658
Anyone else?

365
00:24:16,658 --> 00:24:17,818
Okay.

366
00:24:17,818 --> 00:24:23,859
Yeah, I'll be, if anyone has any other questions,

367
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:26,720
I'll be walking around.

368
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,900
So, but thank you.
