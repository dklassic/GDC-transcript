1
00:00:06,185 --> 00:00:11,809
All right. Hello everybody. As Tom said, I'm Jamie Antonese and today I'm going to talk

2
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:16,733
with you a little bit about narrative paper prototyping. This talk is going to have three

3
00:00:16,853 --> 00:00:22,637
main parts. First I'm going to be talking about the problems that a narrative paper

4
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:25,819
prototype is designed to solve, sort of why prototype.

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,802
for narratives and uh... what a narrative prototype is

6
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:32,865
i'm gonna talk you through a building process how you can actually

7
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,507
make a narrative paper prototype effectively

8
00:00:36,048 --> 00:00:39,191
and i'm going to uh... finish up with just a couple notes on running

9
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:42,073
fixing and using that prototype you've created

10
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:44,235
to improve your final game

11
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:45,876
uh... first a little bit about me

12
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:48,277
I'm a game designer and a writer.

13
00:00:48,597 --> 00:00:52,839
I'm working at Disney, I have a great job at Disney Digital Publishing.

14
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,400
I make interactive children's storybooks and apps.

15
00:00:57,321 --> 00:01:00,422
But that's my current job.

16
00:01:00,742 --> 00:01:02,483
That's not everything that I've done.

17
00:01:02,803 --> 00:01:05,544
I've had a lot of different sort of...

18
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:10,363
made many different kinds of games over the years that cover a wide range of interests.

19
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:16,156
First, I've made games that allow players to be creative with their choices.

20
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:21,611
I've been really interested in games that create positive and lasting player outcomes.

21
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:24,092
I've worked in games for health and games for change.

22
00:01:25,192 --> 00:01:29,854
I've worked on a few games where the focus was to really generate powerful and unexpected

23
00:01:29,914 --> 00:01:35,516
experiences for the player, whether that's fear, as in Hush, delight and happiness, as

24
00:01:35,556 --> 00:01:41,438
in my work with Matt Corbin on Winterbottom, or tranquility or sorrow or some weird mix

25
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:43,439
of emotions, as in the game The Pond.

26
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,784
And I've also been really interested in games that connect players to story in new and interesting ways.

27
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:58,592
So in this process, as you can see, I'm sort of interested in games that don't fit right into a clear mold.

28
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:03,957
I'm interested in innovating a little bit, and to do that, I've really turned to paper prototyping.

29
00:02:03,997 --> 00:02:08,741
And I'm huge on this concept of paper prototyping as a way to make great games.

30
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:14,526
So, first of all, let's define our terms. This is pretty basic, but what is a prototype?

31
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:19,150
A prototype is a mock-up or draft of a potential game.

32
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,432
And it's made to sort of

33
00:02:22,612 --> 00:02:25,295
narrow the risk of making something that doesn't work.

34
00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:27,396
Let's say I wanted to buy a tuxedo.

35
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:32,013
But I'm not sure if it's really going to work for me.

36
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:35,915
I'm not sure if it's going to be a good investment.

37
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:39,297
This shirt is sort of my prototype of a tuxedo.

38
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:45,601
It is focused, so the tuxedo shirt is not focused.

39
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:51,685
But a prototype, a good one, is usually focused on a core aspect of the experience.

40
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:55,767
I guess in this case, just this is the core of the tuxedo.

41
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,068
It's playable.

42
00:02:58,106 --> 00:03:01,489
Tuxedo is not playable, but a game prototype is.

43
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,613
And it's playable so that you basically

44
00:03:05,713 --> 00:03:09,136
want to make sure that people can really test it out.

45
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:10,417
It's made quickly.

46
00:03:11,118 --> 00:03:12,779
And it's basically a disposable practice

47
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,080
run of a larger project.

48
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,841
So.

49
00:03:17,057 --> 00:03:18,818
here's something that you might be used to seeing

50
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:22,781
as prototype. This is a very common prototype in games. It's something

51
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:23,762
that's used a lot.

52
00:03:24,382 --> 00:03:25,703
The digital sandbox. It's

53
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:30,207
something that game makers use to early on determine the game feel.

54
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:32,068
You sort of put players

55
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,810
in a area with not much art, with

56
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,573
pieces of the game all over the place and just see how they interact with the

57
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:39,153
controls.

58
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:42,396
And you figure out the moment to moment and what feels good.

59
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:44,697
And that is incredibly important.

60
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:50,712
But it doesn't tell you everything about the experience of a game.

61
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:53,535
In fact, there's a lot that that prototype doesn't tell you.

62
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:57,999
It really focuses on that single moment of first contact with the game,

63
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,682
where you're sort of feeling through and excited by this notion of,

64
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:02,163
oh, I can jump and swing my sword.

65
00:04:03,064 --> 00:04:04,945
It's goal-free. It's free of context.

66
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:09,368
And it doesn't really address this larger experience of a game.

67
00:04:09,888 --> 00:04:11,289
It doesn't address the game's narrative.

68
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:14,951
So before I go too far into that statement,

69
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:17,232
I'm going to talk about what's a game narrative,

70
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:21,554
and I'm sure that there are many different answers to that question in this room,

71
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,595
since we're at the Narrative Summit.

72
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:26,957
But I'm going to take a stab at what I think a game narrative is.

73
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:28,898
And bear with me for a moment.

74
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:33,362
First, I'm going to sort of point out the traditional narrative.

75
00:04:33,782 --> 00:04:34,923
This is going to be very reductive.

76
00:04:35,023 --> 00:04:40,147
In a traditional narrative, in books, in TV, in movies,

77
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:44,450
a hero is often called to action, and through a series of events,

78
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,474
they strive to overcome challenges in order to achieve a goal.

79
00:04:50,894 --> 00:04:57,276
And why is this? And audiences really enjoy these narratives, that you see this form,

80
00:04:58,236 --> 00:05:03,118
this sort of basic structure, in all sorts of narratives that audiences relate to.

81
00:05:04,118 --> 00:05:08,319
And why? Because they can step inside the shoes of at least one of these characters.

82
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:15,481
They can empathize. And suddenly, they feel like they get the rush of, that they're overcoming a challenge,

83
00:05:15,561 --> 00:05:17,942
and they get the excitement of trying to achieve a goal.

84
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:23,864
In a game narrative, it's a little bit like this traditional narrative structure,

85
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:25,845
but it's a little bit different as well.

86
00:05:26,205 --> 00:05:30,447
In a game narrative, the player is performing the actions that influence events,

87
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:36,610
and they're learning to master a system and rules that you put in front of them to achieve their goal.

88
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:42,033
So, basically a game narrative structure, the player is the hero.

89
00:05:43,413 --> 00:05:45,995
And I just want to emphasize that because that's really important.

90
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:48,897
The player is the hero.

91
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:57,307
So, a lot of games take a lot of time to try to create an association between an avatar and the player.

92
00:05:57,507 --> 00:06:00,490
They try to make you feel like you are this collection of pixels.

93
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,873
You're Mario, you're Batman, you're Q-Bert.

94
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:11,107
But the avatar is not the hero. The avatar's story is completely directed by an outside force.

95
00:06:11,387 --> 00:06:19,633
It's the player that is chasing a goal that's in their head, overcoming challenges that feel real to them.

96
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:25,317
It's the player that's taking the action. They are the hero of the game narrative.

97
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,914
So now that we've talked a little bit about game narrative and prototyping,

98
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:33,119
I'm going to talk a little bit about narrative, prototyping for narrative,

99
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:35,742
which is not the normal mode.

100
00:06:36,593 --> 00:06:45,423
of game prototyping, but it is extremely popular and useful in other storytelling mediums.

101
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:56,775
So in books, before an author spends months or years trying to create, write a story,

102
00:06:57,647 --> 00:06:59,948
they'll often go to an outliner, to some notes,

103
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:04,091
because they want to do a smaller risk write-up

104
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,493
to see if their narrative,

105
00:07:05,853 --> 00:07:07,534
the narrative that they have planned, makes sense.

106
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:11,837
In film or TV, now we have a medium

107
00:07:11,857 --> 00:07:13,298
that's a little bit more complicated.

108
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:16,729
and there are a couple prototypes.

109
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,612
First, there's a script,

110
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:20,634
which is just getting the ideas down on the page,

111
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,436
seeing if the ideas make sense in themselves,

112
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:26,180
and then, once you've gotten through that big risk,

113
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:28,042
you go to the next level of risk.

114
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:29,044
Do these ideas make sense?

115
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:29,784
Visually.

116
00:07:30,345 --> 00:07:31,306
You create a storyboard.

117
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:36,518
In animated films, it's an even more complex medium.

118
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:39,459
There's so many technical steps between the idea

119
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:40,439
and the final product.

120
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,861
And basically, it's a much bigger production.

121
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,042
So prototypes get even more important.

122
00:07:46,602 --> 00:07:48,663
Script, storyboard, then an animatic

123
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:51,264
where you see how this storyboard looks

124
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:53,625
set up in a camera so that you're not wasting time

125
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,085
on shots that don't matter.

126
00:07:56,406 --> 00:08:00,228
All of these narrative prototypes address huge risks.

127
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:02,847
and then smaller and smaller risks

128
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:05,269
that these elaborate ideas

129
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,851
that people have for their stories

130
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:09,392
only make sense in their head.

131
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:12,674
So games, as a narrative medium,

132
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,336
are undeniably complex.

133
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:18,359
They have everything that animated movies have

134
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:19,379
and more.

135
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,881
You have to make all your pieces from scratch very often

136
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:23,562
for this very literal presentation.

137
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,685
Turn an idea to art and sound and animation and logic,

138
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:28,726
but that's not the biggest risk.

139
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:30,952
in your game narrative.

140
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:33,613
The biggest risk, and unknown in games,

141
00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:34,933
is the player.

142
00:08:36,494 --> 00:08:40,115
So, if your premise and goals and choices and challenges

143
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:43,056
don't make sense to the player, if they don't line up,

144
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:45,517
then you're sunk.

145
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:49,579
Because the hero is not interested in continuing on this journey.

146
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:51,480
So let's put the hero in the narrative

147
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,121
as cheaply as possible, as early as we can.

148
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:55,561
Basically...

149
00:08:56,835 --> 00:09:02,260
I think it's really useful when you're addressing this risk of games as a narrative to create

150
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,905
a narrative prototype, a playable and flexible outline of the premise, the rules, the events

151
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:13,211
and the choices that's made to answer some really fundamental question of what's the

152
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:14,392
hero's journey for the player?

153
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:19,377
Do all your pieces fit together into a compelling experience and does it all make sense?

154
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:20,998
So

155
00:09:22,448 --> 00:09:26,851
that's a big question that's a really heavy question to try to tackle

156
00:09:27,671 --> 00:09:30,293
uh... and architecting something like that digitally

157
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:33,415
seems to me at least a bit overwhelming uh... because

158
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:36,537
we want this narrative prototype to be flexible

159
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:39,099
and to be something that uh...

160
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:43,301
that players can interact with in a sort of fluid way we wanted to have lots of

161
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:44,862
small and uh... sort of

162
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:48,425
address a bunch of the features that you see from your larger game

163
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:50,946
and uh... respond to the player intelligently

164
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:57,269
In code, trying to build a prototype like this could itself become a cumbersome and

165
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,991
overreaching mess like Matrix Reloaded.

166
00:10:00,011 --> 00:10:03,312
So that is why.

167
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:09,035
I suggest doing a narrative prototype on paper.

168
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,537
Paper is quick and easy and disposable.

169
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:14,119
It allows for improvisation and imagination.

170
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:17,741
Basically, if your game is a show starring the player,

171
00:10:18,462 --> 00:10:20,023
the easiest way to get them engaged early

172
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:21,884
is to basically create this little

173
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:24,846
narrative paper prototype, set up a cardboard TV,

174
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:27,048
essentially, and invite them inside.

175
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:30,370
Or put another way, make your narrative outline

176
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:31,391
as a board game.

177
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:36,262
uh... so you met one or two of two reactions at this point you might be

178
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:40,451
saying oh cool okay i'll get started or you might think okay i have no idea

179
00:10:41,032 --> 00:10:44,018
how to do that i don't know how to make a narrative outline as a game uh...

180
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:55,097
I've done this a lot. I've done this for a few different projects and so I'm going to walk you through my steps for creating a narrative prototype effectively.

181
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:59,640
The first thing is what you want before you get started.

182
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,202
And this is a set of the things that you really need to have before you begin prototyping.

183
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:05,963
You need an idea.

184
00:11:06,643 --> 00:11:07,944
which is pretty obvious.

185
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:10,305
You need an idea that you're excited about for a game

186
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:11,545
and a willingness to expand it.

187
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:14,326
The second thing, believe it or not,

188
00:11:14,446 --> 00:11:15,686
I would say for a narrative prototype,

189
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:16,787
is you need a deadline.

190
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:20,448
And I try to make this thing quickly if I can

191
00:11:20,608 --> 00:11:22,629
because it should be disposable.

192
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:23,549
It will change.

193
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:26,130
I spend at most three days or a hundredth

194
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,990
of my total time frame on this prototype.

195
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,799
You need some people who are willing to make this thing.

196
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,000
That's probably you.

197
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:36,246
And you can have someone else work on this with you too,

198
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:40,091
but I'd say one or at most two people should be involved in the actual construction of a prototype.

199
00:11:40,842 --> 00:11:43,743
If you have a lot of collaborators, that doesn't mean that you can't brainstorm

200
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,724
and come up with ideas beforehand.

201
00:11:46,224 --> 00:11:47,685
But the people that are doing the building,

202
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:50,826
you want to keep that small because you have such a short time frame

203
00:11:50,886 --> 00:11:52,647
and want ideas to be really pure and clean.

204
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:55,748
And you want some simple supplies.

205
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:59,850
So, a couple things that are important here.

206
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,811
A little dry erase board can be very useful.

207
00:12:04,252 --> 00:12:06,574
playing cards, a couple pieces from old board games,

208
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:09,677
post-it notes are great because they're sticky but not too sticky,

209
00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:10,498
you can move them around.

210
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:12,220
But basically most of this stuff,

211
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,623
you're going to either have around

212
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:16,224
or you're going to be able to get when you need it.

213
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:19,859
you also based on your idea you need

214
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,620
some narrative reference points

215
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:23,661
at least one game that has

216
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:25,402
real similarities to your idea

217
00:12:25,702 --> 00:12:27,403
and thoughts about its player narrative

218
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:31,165
uh... you'd so this is a game where the premise

219
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:34,146
or the mechanics or something is really in line

220
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:38,509
and where you uh... and where you played through the game

221
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:40,169
you don't need to like the game

222
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,371
that your that is your narrative reference point but you should have

223
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:44,171
thoughts about

224
00:12:44,672 --> 00:12:45,772
what you went through as a player

225
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:47,248
in that game.

226
00:12:47,828 --> 00:12:51,751
So, last is, second to last, is a personal storytelling experience.

227
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,172
And this is a little bit touchy-feely.

228
00:12:54,293 --> 00:12:59,877
But you really want a time to look back at a time when you felt engaged and empowered

229
00:12:59,918 --> 00:13:00,578
as a storyteller.

230
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:00,938
You want...

231
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:07,274
to look for your comfort zone as a storyteller and hold on to that because you're going to use that later.

232
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:13,037
For you this may be telling a story around a campfire, telling a joke to a laughing audience or painting a picture.

233
00:13:13,498 --> 00:13:19,442
But me, I always think personally about being 10 years old and my first experience with role-playing games.

234
00:13:19,962 --> 00:13:25,246
So my friends and I didn't have rule books, but I made up a pretend world, my friends made up characters

235
00:13:25,826 --> 00:13:29,048
and we rolled dice and told collaborative stories that are, it's still this...

236
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:33,150
place of warmth and comfort where I feel like anything is possible when I think back at that time.

237
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:38,733
So finally, of course, you need that focus on the central question of game narrative

238
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:41,374
as you go forward and as you get ready to make this thing.

239
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:44,135
You want to keep this about how the premise, rules, and actions

240
00:13:45,036 --> 00:13:48,037
come together to create a player's story.

241
00:13:48,337 --> 00:13:54,300
You're not testing the mechanics, the look and feel, or the game balance.

242
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:57,742
And you want to keep in mind that those are not what's on the table here.

243
00:13:59,027 --> 00:14:05,511
So, once you have that all ready, basically my first step is an initial write-up.

244
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:11,275
I lay out the narrative elements of my game. These can be notes, they can be totally informal, they only have to make sense to you.

245
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:16,018
And I'll go through these pieces in the order that I like to use because this is the order that makes sense to me.

246
00:14:16,758 --> 00:14:17,799
First of all, the premise.

247
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:22,070
this is the going to be the most fun part of this read up just go nuts

248
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,552
write down everything that's exciting to you

249
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:25,972
about your game

250
00:14:26,372 --> 00:14:26,813
uh... so

251
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,394
you know you know you might be like oh uh...

252
00:14:29,754 --> 00:14:30,814
my game is a is

253
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:35,416
this world where stories come to life and there are luck dragons and rock

254
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:36,717
biters and empresses

255
00:14:37,457 --> 00:14:40,719
uh... write all the stuff that you think is really exciting but only

256
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:42,219
uh... do this

257
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,841
for about ten minutes because that'll force you to stick with the things that

258
00:14:45,861 --> 00:14:46,521
you think are most

259
00:14:46,922 --> 00:14:47,802
exciting and important

260
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:54,504
And it'll cut you off because if you don't do this you could waste a lot of time just writing down exciting things about your game

261
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:57,364
before you get to the meat of it, which is the player.

262
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:02,546
The second thing is putting the player in that world. Think about the player role.

263
00:15:03,706 --> 00:15:09,167
Does the player actually assume a role in the game? Are we gonna put them in the shoes of a character in the narrative?

264
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:10,668
Are they going to be John Malkovich?

265
00:15:12,473 --> 00:15:15,139
How much of an identity are we asking them to take on here?

266
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,225
Or are they really just playing the game as themselves?

267
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,008
This is the second question you want to answer.

268
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:25,704
the goals of the player. So what's the carrot on the stick?

269
00:15:26,104 --> 00:15:27,925
What's pulling them through the experience?

270
00:15:28,706 --> 00:15:32,808
So I always go back to Scrooge McDuck, man. Scrooge is so great.

271
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,171
Scrooge loves getting money.

272
00:15:36,431 --> 00:15:39,973
And you might think that that is his goal. It's nice, it's simple.

273
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:42,195
But money itself is not his goal.

274
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,356
His goal...

275
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:48,239
is to get all this money and then to swim around in a huge pile of his own money.

276
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,662
Like most players, his goal is experiential.

277
00:15:51,923 --> 00:15:54,224
There's an experience that he wants to get out of this.

278
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:56,646
And your players are going to be the same way.

279
00:15:58,068 --> 00:15:58,628
Conflict.

280
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:02,751
So what obstacles are in the way of that goal in your story?

281
00:16:02,771 --> 00:16:04,873
What are the barriers to efficient victory?

282
00:16:05,454 --> 00:16:08,896
And I say efficient victory because a player can play your game

283
00:16:09,117 --> 00:16:11,098
for as long as they are intrigued by it.

284
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:14,241
So Sisyphus here, his goal is to get the rock up the mountain.

285
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:21,019
and his conflict is with gravity and for some reason he keeps on playing this game, it's compelling to him, I don't know why.

286
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:28,525
So then we start to get into more of the meat of where narrative comes in, player choices.

287
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:39,174
Jot down the big interactive choices and basically this is where you want to look at in the abstract, big picture.

288
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:41,995
what is the player trying to do?

289
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:43,376
Are these choices tough?

290
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:46,157
Are they meaningful, like deciding whether or not

291
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:47,137
to get on that plane?

292
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:49,358
Are they strategic?

293
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:51,118
Or are they more tactical?

294
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:52,699
Is it more a matter of who to aim at

295
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:54,219
and who to shoot in a moment?

296
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,420
These are all choices, and whether they're large or small,

297
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,241
you want to write them down.

298
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:02,402
And you also want to write down actions here.

299
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:06,740
So, actions and choices, that's sort of a fine-grained distinction, but

300
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:09,442
think about it in terms of this one-man band.

301
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:12,643
His choices are where to play and when to play,

302
00:17:13,223 --> 00:17:15,864
and his actions are his player verbs.

303
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:19,566
His guitar, his cymbals, his drum kit.

304
00:17:20,626 --> 00:17:22,047
When he plays those things, those are his...

305
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:24,848
playing the drums, playing the guitar, those are his verbs.

306
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,921
resources so this is where you've talked a lot about the player can do

307
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:33,362
and this is where you are the first clear connection between your world

308
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:34,463
and your player

309
00:17:35,043 --> 00:17:38,985
what in the world can the player use uh... and these these resources should

310
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:40,946
be simple to understand if possible but elegant

311
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:41,826
uh...

312
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:46,489
you know in monopoly monopoly is you know a little bit maligned as a game

313
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,509
uh... but

314
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,252
As a resource, Monopoly Money is great.

315
00:17:51,873 --> 00:17:53,894
It gives an opportunity to the player.

316
00:17:54,354 --> 00:17:57,777
It provides information when you look around and see how much money people have compared

317
00:17:57,797 --> 00:17:58,698
to how much you have.

318
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:03,021
And it also limits your actions in a challenging way when you don't have the money you need.

319
00:18:04,322 --> 00:18:08,045
So for the final element, we're going to go a little farther into the world in the story.

320
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:14,370
we're going to outline our game events. Now you don't want to think about this as a formal system of rules. Not yet.

321
00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:18,454
We still want to keep it high level and think about what sort of changes are taking place.

322
00:18:18,874 --> 00:18:20,495
Are these changes regular and predictable?

323
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:25,699
Or are they, you know, are they clockwork or are they big and dramatic?

324
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,363
Put in biblical terms, does it rain twice a week in your world?

325
00:18:31,264 --> 00:18:34,286
Or is there a flood on the way that's going to hit at hour two?

326
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:36,888
These are the things you want to think about.

327
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:39,010
So now that you've done that, you've sort of...

328
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:42,792
written down some elements in this area that crosses

329
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:45,774
formal and informal you sort of laid out

330
00:18:46,715 --> 00:18:47,916
narrative elements of your game

331
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:50,478
and uh... you thought about how the players gonna

332
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,120
interact with that world

333
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,221
so now it's time to start building out your story

334
00:18:54,722 --> 00:18:58,145
doing this well may take you back into your right of to make changes and that's

335
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:58,505
okay

336
00:18:59,226 --> 00:18:59,366
uh...

337
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:03,750
but i want to go through a couple examples of games that do this well uh...

338
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,353
as and a couple principles that i think really work first of all

339
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,531
you when you're thinking about story you want to think about how you're going to show the player your goal in journey

340
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:14,632
you see the mountain with the light

341
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:16,912
and you don't need to be told

342
00:19:17,492 --> 00:19:17,953
to go there

343
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,213
you know if you can make something like that

344
00:19:20,753 --> 00:19:21,333
fantastic

345
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:24,634
uh... give meaning to rules in your game

346
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:26,695
this is a a screen from dino run

347
00:19:27,215 --> 00:19:27,935
uh... which is

348
00:19:28,495 --> 00:19:32,336
a game where you know the rules are pretty simple you're it's a little running game

349
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:33,436
and there's a timer

350
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:35,477
that where if you fall too far behind

351
00:19:35,777 --> 00:19:36,817
you're gonna have to restart

352
00:19:37,557 --> 00:19:37,677
but

353
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:44,329
But story was used to really narrativize this goal in a really interesting way.

354
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:48,470
In Dino Run, an asteroid hits and you have a wall of destruction.

355
00:19:48,711 --> 00:19:51,472
This is sort of the extinction level event coming up from behind you.

356
00:19:51,912 --> 00:19:55,434
Staying one step ahead of that is much more interesting than a timer.

357
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:57,835
Use characters.

358
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,136
If you can.

359
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:00,736
People are funny.

360
00:20:00,756 --> 00:20:01,916
They see characters everywhere.

361
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:04,678
And once they start seeing characters, they start caring.

362
00:20:05,722 --> 00:20:06,062
Use that.

363
00:20:07,302 --> 00:20:08,202
Characters can be goals.

364
00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:09,342
Keep Clem safe.

365
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,043
Characters can be resources.

366
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,763
In classic JRPGs, your options for play

367
00:20:13,863 --> 00:20:15,284
are personified as characters.

368
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:17,224
Characters can be conflict.

369
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:20,565
Now, sometimes a character can work in many narrative

370
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:23,365
elements at once, which is fantastic, like Donkey Kong.

371
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:24,746
He's a source of conflict.

372
00:20:24,786 --> 00:20:26,926
I mean, he's holding your goal, this damsel in distress.

373
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:29,607
But he's also throwing obstacles in your path.

374
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:33,851
He's also disappearing back up the level and driving you onwards for a long-term goal.

375
00:20:34,331 --> 00:20:39,917
He's such a central part of the game narrative that even though he's not playable,

376
00:20:40,237 --> 00:20:41,379
the game is named after him.

377
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,841
The game is not called Mario, it's called Donkey Kong.

378
00:20:44,462 --> 00:20:48,946
Because this character is so key to the understanding of the story.

379
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,133
Finally, you've got your story events that you've been interested in, the things that

380
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:54,493
happen.

381
00:20:54,934 --> 00:20:58,917
Try to tie them into the player's actions as much as possible, the things that you know

382
00:20:58,937 --> 00:20:59,858
the player will be doing.

383
00:21:01,682 --> 00:21:03,384
and that will make them meaningful.

384
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:09,210
So, finally now, you want to cut story points that don't do any of these things,

385
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,715
that don't reinforce or showcase goals, call the player to action, give them feedback,

386
00:21:13,955 --> 00:21:15,136
or provide a break or reward.

387
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:19,080
I think I don't have as much time as I think I do, so I'm going to go fast.

388
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:22,864
Okay, so next, drafting the rules.

389
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:24,025
Basically...

390
00:21:25,157 --> 00:21:31,741
when you're figuring out the rules of the game, now that you've got the elements, now that you've figured out the story, remember, you're playing as the computer, so keep these rules simple.

391
00:21:32,181 --> 00:21:33,762
Remember, you're not testing mechanics.

392
00:21:34,563 --> 00:21:42,488
So, if you can substitute, but you can substitute a challenge for another moment of excitement and test different outcomes.

393
00:21:42,808 --> 00:21:43,949
If you can do that, that's great.

394
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:47,251
So, dice are a good simple way to do this.

395
00:21:47,311 --> 00:21:51,634
They may not be the same test to a player as combat, but...

396
00:21:52,114 --> 00:21:53,955
they can provide that little challenging moment.

397
00:21:54,335 --> 00:21:56,716
But let's say you really want to test a player's skill to some degree.

398
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:57,957
Alright, you can do that.

399
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,078
Let's say you think it's important for the game narrative

400
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:07,081
to basically test their accuracy as a shooter will do.

401
00:22:08,082 --> 00:22:11,323
So, okay, make a little micro-prototype.

402
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,804
Put up a dartboard and make that a little part of your game

403
00:22:14,405 --> 00:22:19,407
and success or failure can sort of depend on where they hit on the dartboard.

404
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:24,348
So, rules will be different for every game, but there's one more thing I want to emphasize.

405
00:22:24,628 --> 00:22:29,731
You may be simplifying actions, but you want to keep the elements of choice strong in your game,

406
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:32,833
or else the player is not going to be doing anything in this narrative prototype.

407
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:37,035
Identify your most important choice points and figure out what's behind either door.

408
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:41,627
So now, it's time to actually start building.

409
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:42,867
And I'm going to rush through this,

410
00:22:42,927 --> 00:22:44,028
because it's pretty straightforward.

411
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:47,770
Choose your pieces, and use simple familiar materials,

412
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,551
as I said before.

413
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,252
One quick note, don't use anything too light.

414
00:22:52,273 --> 00:22:53,733
So you're going to be tempted to draw on paper,

415
00:22:54,314 --> 00:22:56,355
and just make a little resource that way.

416
00:22:56,795 --> 00:22:58,076
But once you start playing these games,

417
00:22:58,156 --> 00:22:59,377
that's going to go all over the place.

418
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:03,159
Weight it down on something like a coin, or it'll scatter.

419
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:05,240
Making the board.

420
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:12,466
So your final step is setting up a space that's going to abstractly, for the player, represent their world.

421
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,687
Or more accurately, their screen.

422
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:19,852
This is your game board and you want it to have weight, you want it to be flexible and sticky,

423
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:23,175
and you want it to have some simplicity and focus to it as well.

424
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:27,639
You really don't want to overcomplicate this with the UI elements that you'll need down the road.

425
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,041
Just think about what the player needs in that space.

426
00:23:30,902 --> 00:23:43,106
So now we've got a premise, a goal, a board to play on, resources that the players can use to achieve their goals, choices, rules that create conflicts and opportunities, and events that affect and inform play.

427
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:51,349
So, I know I started a little bit late, so I'm going to keep on going for a minute or two. You guys can obviously leave if you want.

428
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,171
So, finalizing your prototype. Basically...

429
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:02,772
what you need to do now that you've created this formal system so it makes sense to you

430
00:24:03,172 --> 00:24:07,673
is build out your presentation and this is where you're using that comfort, that comfortable

431
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:14,996
place, that storytelling place that really makes you feel like you're conveying a good

432
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:15,316
story.

433
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:20,743
So, for some of you it may be visual or written or some performative,

434
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:26,371
but this is where you're figuring out how to communicate those rules and systems to the player.

435
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:27,873
You're presenting that.

436
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,339
Now that you've done that presentation...

437
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,859
it's you're ready finally to start rehearsing the running of this prototype

438
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:36,639
phase one

439
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,962
run the prototype on yourself you want to be able to do one successful solo run

440
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:41,583
if possible

441
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:45,365
but it has to be possible you need to do a successful run

442
00:24:45,966 --> 00:24:46,466
on your own

443
00:24:47,106 --> 00:24:47,807
and uh... just

444
00:24:48,347 --> 00:24:50,028
see this is a conversation between you

445
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:54,191
the uh... the developer who's made this game and knows all the rules

446
00:24:54,872 --> 00:24:55,252
and you

447
00:24:55,712 --> 00:24:56,232
the player

448
00:24:56,713 --> 00:24:58,214
who knows nothing about this game

449
00:24:59,503 --> 00:25:01,684
You're going to find that you missed a lot of things.

450
00:25:01,784 --> 00:25:02,425
That's okay.

451
00:25:03,626 --> 00:25:07,348
You can just expect imperfection, fix those mistakes, run it again.

452
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:14,574
Phase two, once you've gotten a successful run yourself, do a rehearsal with someone

453
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:18,497
who will love you even if you totally flub the entire thing.

454
00:25:19,277 --> 00:25:23,741
You want to leverage their patience to work out the kinks in those presentation elements

455
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:25,422
that you put together.

456
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:31,274
uh... and then once that has worked and you've got the presentation worked out

457
00:25:31,414 --> 00:25:33,435
and you figured out from the first play testers

458
00:25:34,096 --> 00:25:34,836
this person you love

459
00:25:35,476 --> 00:25:36,477
what is really unclear

460
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:39,559
now it's time to bring in some people whose opinion

461
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:41,500
of this prototype really does matter

462
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,422
bring back your conspirators the uh... so

463
00:25:44,902 --> 00:25:48,084
either the collaborators or people whose opinions you trust

464
00:25:48,884 --> 00:25:49,605
uh... and

465
00:25:50,205 --> 00:25:54,127
this is pretty obvious just uh... just listen to this feedback

466
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:55,528
my

467
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,421
My cut off?

468
00:25:57,501 --> 00:25:58,501
OK.

469
00:25:59,061 --> 00:25:59,261
Great.

470
00:25:59,402 --> 00:26:01,803
Listen to their feedback and look at what they enjoyed,

471
00:26:01,843 --> 00:26:03,884
what's fun, frustrating, boring, or unclear,

472
00:26:04,284 --> 00:26:07,566
and adjust that prototype as you prepare for play testing.

473
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,168
Deborah did such a good job talking about play.

474
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:13,889
It was so cool talking about deeper user testing.

475
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:15,210
This stuff is going to be very light.

476
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,390
I'm just going to wrap up on this.

477
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:19,012
I used to have a list of questions here.

478
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:19,632
I got rid of it.

479
00:26:21,453 --> 00:26:23,614
I will put it up on the GDC vault.

480
00:26:24,174 --> 00:26:25,915
But write down a few questions beforehand,

481
00:26:25,955 --> 00:26:27,756
because you won't want to think about them afterwards.

482
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:31,378
You want to write down questions.

483
00:26:31,418 --> 00:26:33,078
And also, if you can, you want to think

484
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:34,219
about recording the play tests.

485
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,981
Do use video if possible, but you

486
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:40,562
need to get permission from play testers.

487
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:43,183
And if you want to improve your presentation style,

488
00:26:43,203 --> 00:26:43,863
you can do that.

489
00:26:44,122 --> 00:26:46,864
point the camera at yourself. If you want to improve your game,

490
00:26:46,884 --> 00:26:50,367
you're going to learn a lot more though by turning the camera on someone else.

491
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:51,948
So playtesting,

492
00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:55,691
I'm just going to sort of roll through that because that's super basic

493
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:57,993
stuff about what it means to playtest.

494
00:26:59,174 --> 00:27:02,676
But the real important thing here is this is not a scientific playtest.

495
00:27:03,077 --> 00:27:03,837
It doesn't matter

496
00:27:03,857 --> 00:27:08,901
if your variables are all super clean and all your ducks are lined up in the road.

497
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:12,784
This is something that you, this is a crucible, a trial by fire to make your game better.

498
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:14,385
So you can improvise.

499
00:27:15,126 --> 00:27:17,787
If you listen for choices from the player,

500
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,729
allow them to skip things that you believe they could skip.

501
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,290
And if they have a smart suggestion,

502
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,591
if they want to grab the mic and say,

503
00:27:24,631 --> 00:27:25,672
hey, this is what I want to do,

504
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:28,433
incorporate it into your play.

505
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:31,835
Just let it happen and see if it improves the game,

506
00:27:31,895 --> 00:27:32,916
as long as it doesn't seem like

507
00:27:32,936 --> 00:27:34,157
it's going to mess up the game too much.

508
00:27:34,517 --> 00:27:36,778
But whatever you do in those play tests,

509
00:27:37,418 --> 00:27:39,119
just note it so that you know.

510
00:27:40,365 --> 00:27:42,685
so that you have a sort of log of those changes.

511
00:27:42,986 --> 00:27:45,806
So, people are polite, so have a third party

512
00:27:46,587 --> 00:27:47,727
ask questions for you.

513
00:27:48,587 --> 00:27:50,548
And also set aside time to review,

514
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:51,928
again another really basic thing.

515
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:54,329
So, almost done here.

516
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,090
So, once you've got all that, you've got playtest notes.

517
00:27:58,851 --> 00:28:00,371
And you want to look at the biggest problem

518
00:28:00,411 --> 00:28:01,111
with your prototype.

519
00:28:01,552 --> 00:28:02,492
Is the goal unclear?

520
00:28:02,552 --> 00:28:03,252
Is it too hard?

521
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:06,053
Is it, are there dead ends in the gameplay

522
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:07,193
or is it just not that awesome?

523
00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:11,876
This prototype, that's the nice thing about the fact that you made this thing in three days.

524
00:28:12,955 --> 00:28:13,635
it's disposable.

525
00:28:15,435 --> 00:28:17,796
Figure out some bold solutions to your problems,

526
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,197
discard, kill your darlings, and try again.

527
00:28:22,778 --> 00:28:24,458
So when you finally achieve something

528
00:28:24,478 --> 00:28:26,999
that feels like a narrative outline that

529
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,140
is interesting and exciting to players,

530
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,640
there's a couple ways you can go.

531
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,501
You can expand that prototype.

532
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:34,201
You can generalize, because you're

533
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:36,462
going to learn a lot from having someone run that prototype

534
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:36,822
on you.

535
00:28:36,902 --> 00:28:38,823
So that's a matter of getting the rules in sort

536
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:41,083
of a really formal setup so that you.

537
00:28:41,843 --> 00:28:44,424
can be a player of your game which will be useful later on.

538
00:28:44,904 --> 00:28:46,865
But you can also use this narrative outline,

539
00:28:46,905 --> 00:28:49,746
it's sort of this, if your collaborators

540
00:28:49,846 --> 00:28:50,846
and everyone all feels like, yeah,

541
00:28:50,886 --> 00:28:51,926
this is the game we want to make,

542
00:28:52,307 --> 00:28:54,007
this is an extraordinary production tool.

543
00:28:54,847 --> 00:28:56,428
You can bust it out into asset lists,

544
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:59,629
into, think about the animations and all the pieces

545
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:03,790
that you were sort of need to create as part of this game.

546
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,531
And then you're also gonna see some areas

547
00:29:06,591 --> 00:29:08,631
where this narrative, obviously,

548
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:10,792
where the narrative outline.

549
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,654
this paper prototype you made really hasn't...

550
00:29:16,335 --> 00:29:19,157
where it's really not addressing issues.

551
00:29:19,237 --> 00:29:20,738
So then shift your focus.

552
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,539
Maybe it is now time for that digital sandbox.

553
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,761
So go back and prototype the next big question in your game.

554
00:29:28,522 --> 00:29:28,642
So...

555
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,529
That's all a lot of stuff. It's a lot of work.

556
00:29:31,829 --> 00:29:34,311
Even though it's disposable and quick, it's a lot to do.

557
00:29:34,851 --> 00:29:36,813
Why do I go through this process?

558
00:29:36,873 --> 00:29:38,234
Why do I think about it this deeply?

559
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,835
Basically because a narrative paper prototype

560
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,236
is going to help me save time and money.

561
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:45,098
It helps me see if my premise, rules, and choices are compelling

562
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:48,381
to see if the pieces fit together coherently.

563
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,783
It helps me form a shared vision of this whole game

564
00:29:51,983 --> 00:29:54,505
with my collaborators as early as possible.

565
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:57,387
It shows me, of course, the player's perspective.

566
00:29:57,887 --> 00:29:58,728
But most of all...

567
00:29:59,858 --> 00:30:05,028
because it can turn early development, which can be very difficult and unsure, into a fun

568
00:30:05,128 --> 00:30:06,331
and empowering experience.

569
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:07,373
Thank you.
