1
00:00:06,127 --> 00:00:07,668
Okay, good morning.

2
00:00:07,668 --> 00:00:07,768
Hey.

3
00:00:07,768 --> 00:00:11,550
I have two pieces of housekeeping to start with.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,354
First, I need to remind you all to please

5
00:00:17,354 --> 00:00:20,716
fill out your evaluations after the talk,

6
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:22,577
not 15 minutes before the end,

7
00:00:22,577 --> 00:00:25,098
but you'll receive them then,

8
00:00:25,098 --> 00:00:27,600
and yeah, then fill them out and do that thing.

9
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:32,245
And the second is to turn off your phones or put them on silence.

10
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:37,111
I've been told to say that, I would say that anyway because you should.

11
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:42,618
And right now I'm praying my phone is off or on silence.

12
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:45,822
I'm pretty sure it is. Pretty sure it is.

13
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:51,245
First, thank you all, so many of you, for coming this morning.

14
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:57,327
I know it is early and there are lots and lots of other brilliant talks you could be at.

15
00:00:57,327 --> 00:01:01,069
It means, it genuinely means a lot to see you here.

16
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:07,652
I had a bet last night that there would be 13 people in the room and there's more than that.

17
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:09,953
Maybe there's 13 at Sid Meier's talk, I don't know.

18
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:20,129
Thanks also to GDC for inviting me. It is genuinely an honour to be here, it's an honour to be part of the conference.

19
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:27,713
It's an honour to be part of the advocacy track, which is always special and feels particularly important this year.

20
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:36,778
My name is Steve Curran, I'm a game designer. I do other things apart from games as well, but also I talk and that's why I'm here.

21
00:01:38,112 --> 00:01:41,278
I don't know how many people in this room have seen me talk before.

22
00:01:41,278 --> 00:01:45,706
I always feel like before I start I should kind of warn people a bit.

23
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:49,913
I don't want to disappoint anyone because life is short and the worst thing you can

24
00:01:49,913 --> 00:01:51,276
do is waste time.

25
00:01:53,651 --> 00:01:56,714
Double Tap is a story.

26
00:01:56,714 --> 00:01:58,455
I mean, it's a bunch of stories, really.

27
00:01:58,455 --> 00:02:01,358
It's arranged around thoughts on life and game design.

28
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:04,000
I write something like this every year,

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,783
present them around the world, these things,

30
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:09,445
at conferences, colleges, wherever I get invited.

31
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:11,668
This is actually my seventh piece.

32
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:13,390
It's about an hour long.

33
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,554
There is no downloadable PowerPoint.

34
00:02:15,554 --> 00:02:18,680
There is no succinct, tweetable takeaway

35
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,782
on workflow pipelines.

36
00:02:19,782 --> 00:02:24,090
You will not get any advice about shader techniques today.

37
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,511
Sorry.

38
00:02:25,454 --> 00:02:29,496
There's no easy headline at the end of the talk to report back to your studio.

39
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:34,597
And there will not be a Q&A at the end either, though you can talk to me.

40
00:02:34,597 --> 00:02:37,058
I'd love you to find me here or online.

41
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:39,939
I'd love to talk to you either Twitter, email, whatever.

42
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:45,181
One of the reasons, one of the main reasons I do these talks is to meet new people.

43
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:45,982
So please do that.

44
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,232
Double Tap was written in 2016.

45
00:02:51,232 --> 00:02:53,874
Preparing for today meant revisiting words

46
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,397
that I had not seen in nearly a year.

47
00:02:56,397 --> 00:02:58,258
And so much has changed since then.

48
00:02:58,258 --> 00:03:01,461
And so much of that has changed for the worse.

49
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:05,345
The rise of the populist right feels like a nightmare.

50
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:07,487
I want to stop this tumbling dissent,

51
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:11,651
this asphyxiation of empathy.

52
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:12,772
And I don't feel like I can.

53
00:03:12,772 --> 00:03:14,753
I am just one person.

54
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:20,448
And that's how I feel as a straight white male privilege incarnate.

55
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:25,471
I'm sure the way the world has changed has affected some of you out there

56
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,072
far more directly than it's affected me.

57
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:32,115
So I wanted to say at the start that I stand with all of you, my friends,

58
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:36,477
who fight as they have their rights stripped away,

59
00:03:36,477 --> 00:03:41,080
with Muslims, people of colour, the LGBTQ community, with women.

60
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,522
I stand with anyone who feels targeted by power.

61
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:46,163
I love you.

62
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:49,931
and I will fight for you and I will look after you as much as I can.

63
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,091
That feels like a dumb, pointless thing to say.

64
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:54,713
Like, what does it actually mean?

65
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:56,574
It's just words.

66
00:03:56,574 --> 00:03:57,775
What can I do?

67
00:03:57,775 --> 00:04:02,557
Privileged or not, I am just one voice.

68
00:04:02,557 --> 00:04:05,959
Not rich, not clever, not anything.

69
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,580
Just, you know, a snowflake.

70
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:10,825
But it is not pointless.

71
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:12,307
Words do matter.

72
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:13,709
Taking a stand matters.

73
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,354
At the very least, taking a stand means other people

74
00:04:17,354 --> 00:04:19,036
feel like they can stand too.

75
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:19,877
Stand with you.

76
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,892
So I wanted to say this before we started.

77
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:26,434
I wrote Double Tap a year ago

78
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,797
as a collection of fragments around a theme.

79
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:30,798
And please, I want you to take whatever you want

80
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:32,620
from those fragments.

81
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,863
My intention at the start was to make you ask questions

82
00:04:35,863 --> 00:04:38,285
about the games that we choose to make

83
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:40,087
and the games that we choose to play.

84
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:44,210
But there are other threads in the piece too,

85
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,392
and some of those feel more relevant now than ever.

86
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:51,549
Our lives are short, often much shorter than we expect or deserve.

87
00:04:51,549 --> 00:04:54,691
And when we die, all of us, whoever we are,

88
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:57,252
rich, powerful, poor, privileged or not,

89
00:04:57,252 --> 00:04:59,493
get to leave two things behind.

90
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:02,534
The first is our work, whatever that is,

91
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:05,875
and the second is the impact we have on other people.

92
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:10,672
That is how we are remembered and measured.

93
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:14,858
That is how future generations will remember and measure those in power

94
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:17,803
making spiteful, selfish decisions today.

95
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:20,948
And that is how you will be remembered and measured too.

96
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:27,023
So leave a positive effect on the world in everything you have,

97
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:31,066
everything you make, every conversation you have,

98
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,767
in every person you touch.

99
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,147
That is all we can do.

100
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:35,868
We can stand up.

101
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,350
That's what Double Tap means for me now,

102
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,051
and I hope you find some meaning in it too.

103
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:47,828
So

104
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:58,480
You

105
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,206
The most human I've ever felt inside a video game

106
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:25,772
was while I was lying face down in a bush doing nothing.

107
00:07:27,617 --> 00:07:31,420
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon was published 16 years ago, in 2001.

108
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:36,664
A third-person shooter developed by Clancy's own Red Storm Entertainment,

109
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:40,127
the player takes the role of the leader of a squad of ghosts.

110
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:45,452
This is a video game, but these are not fun, bright Pac-Man ghosts.

111
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:51,096
This is a Tom Clancy video game, and the ghosts here are gruff American soldiers,

112
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:55,780
so called because they are skilled enough to ghost through combat situations unseen.

113
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:02,714
Like all of Clancy's work, Ghost Recon is lead heavy with power fantasy and military

114
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:07,619
pornography, though its rhythm is more cautious, more thoughtful than arcade shooters like

115
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:08,640
Call of Duty.

116
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,484
This is the sort of game that requires patience, that takes guns seriously and demands that

117
00:08:13,484 --> 00:08:14,145
you do the same.

118
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:18,687
This is the sort of game that feels like it belongs on a PC,

119
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,068
controlled by players whose hallow skin

120
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:24,549
seems permanently illuminated by centuries of monitor glow,

121
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:28,910
spines curved to accommodate keyboard and mouse gameplay,

122
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,392
dank caves echoing to military barks

123
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:35,092
issued over air traffic control headsets.

124
00:08:35,092 --> 00:08:37,113
But 15 years ago, I was a console gamer,

125
00:08:37,113 --> 00:08:42,015
and so I played the game with my friends on Xbox Live,

126
00:08:42,015 --> 00:08:44,035
not long after Microsoft's service launched.

127
00:08:45,843 --> 00:08:48,543
And it was an awkward fit, as ports often are.

128
00:08:48,543 --> 00:08:51,244
Ghost Recon's keyboard controls,

129
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:54,044
digital inputs that let you issue binary pulses

130
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:55,705
to your character's nervous system

131
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:57,665
and communicate simple commands to your squad

132
00:08:57,665 --> 00:09:00,266
are mapped across more than a dozen different buttons.

133
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:05,247
And, as fans of dumb internet arguments doubtless know,

134
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:09,087
controlling even the simplest shooter on a console

135
00:09:09,087 --> 00:09:11,268
is very different to controlling one on a PC.

136
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,141
Aiming and firing with a mouse is so simple, as effortless as finding and double-clicking

137
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:22,882
on the Microsoft Excel icon after your first cup of coffee on a Monday morning.

138
00:09:22,882 --> 00:09:25,783
But to aim a gun on a console, that's more challenging.

139
00:09:25,783 --> 00:09:30,584
You push the crosshairs, you correct course, and you lock on.

140
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:36,265
Firing the gun, though, that's basically the same on both formats.

141
00:09:36,265 --> 00:09:38,326
With a mouse, you press a button.

142
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:39,986
With a joypad, a trigger.

143
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:41,467
It's just a gentle squeeze.

144
00:09:42,664 --> 00:09:46,566
or two, if you want to be absolutely sure.

145
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:57,471
Games are about cause and effect, input and output, call and response.

146
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:04,235
While most media does its best to entertain through instruction alone, tireless preachers

147
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:07,956
deliver in calculated, manipulative monologues just like this one.

148
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:11,905
Games are, or at the very least pretend to be, dialogues.

149
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:14,106
That is what makes us different.

150
00:10:14,106 --> 00:10:15,147
That is our strength.

151
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:18,209
That's what game design is.

152
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:22,431
When designing a game, you are considering two things,

153
00:10:22,431 --> 00:10:25,013
consciously or otherwise.

154
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:28,415
What are the questions that I want to ask the player?

155
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:30,616
And how will they answer those questions?

156
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:35,575
The questions that we ask, those are the shape of the game.

157
00:10:35,575 --> 00:10:36,935
Can you save the princess?

158
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:38,296
Can you make that headshot?

159
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:40,517
But the player's experience is defined

160
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:42,719
by the limited answers they can give,

161
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:45,180
defined by the actions that we let them perform

162
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:45,940
inside our world.

163
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,402
We put words in their mouth,

164
00:10:49,402 --> 00:10:52,264
so we have to choose those words so carefully,

165
00:10:52,264 --> 00:10:53,485
and that is game design.

166
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:56,566
What are the answers we create for the player?

167
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:58,648
Which of those answers do we think they'll choose?

168
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:02,452
Which do we want them to choose?

169
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:03,052
And so on.

170
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:06,433
Those responses must be delivered by the player

171
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,534
to the game via an interface,

172
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:12,195
and that interface inevitably forms part of the answer too.

173
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:14,636
A first-person shooter controlled with a joypad

174
00:11:14,636 --> 00:11:15,356
is one thing.

175
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:18,397
The same game controlled with a keyboard and mouse

176
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:19,778
is very, very different.

177
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:22,262
Neither is a perfect simulation.

178
00:11:22,262 --> 00:11:24,142
The latter is more instinctive.

179
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,543
The former more interesting, I think.

180
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:28,543
Both give the impression of aiming,

181
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:30,664
but are not the same as aiming.

182
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:33,745
The way you fire on each format is a better match.

183
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:36,605
Just a gentle flex of the index finger.

184
00:11:36,605 --> 00:11:39,826
So the player's experience is this.

185
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:42,606
Our answers to our questions,

186
00:11:42,606 --> 00:11:45,587
and the manner in which they deliver those answers.

187
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:49,641
As designers, there aren't many ways we can solicit a response,

188
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:55,747
and so our choice often comes down to two things, analog or digital.

189
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:56,108
Analog or digital.

190
00:11:56,108 --> 00:12:01,954
Analog systems measure the degree of input, the pressure, the direction,

191
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,715
the weight applied by the player.

192
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:08,920
Digital systems, they simply register a change of state.

193
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,622
A button can be on or off.

194
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,105
Analog systems offer nuance.

195
00:12:14,105 --> 00:12:17,007
They let the player express caution in their answer.

196
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:19,248
They can edge towards a blind corner,

197
00:12:19,248 --> 00:12:21,030
then change their mind.

198
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,132
Digital systems, they're useful for decisions.

199
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:29,776
When you play a video game, you are the captain of a vessel.

200
00:12:29,776 --> 00:12:32,358
The system turns to you and says,

201
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:37,562
Captain, the button gives the yes or the no.

202
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:40,384
The button tells the system to fire.

203
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:42,347
There is no maybe.

204
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:47,609
If you want to feel something, demonstrate humanity,

205
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:52,070
which is often rooted in doubt and uncertainty.

206
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,851
Analog systems matter.

207
00:12:53,851 --> 00:12:55,792
If you only want to do something,

208
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,252
you can think digitally.

209
00:12:57,252 --> 00:12:58,112
You tap a button.

210
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:02,454
And in some systems, to show you are absolutely certain,

211
00:13:02,454 --> 00:13:03,154
you double tap.

212
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:14,007
M02 Farm is a multiplayer map in Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon.

213
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:23,090
As the name suggests, the map is centered around a ruined farmhouse in clearing, surrounded

214
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,930
by what I remember to be dense jungle.

215
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,831
I might be misremembering.

216
00:13:27,831 --> 00:13:31,694
The map takes place at night, and I never saw the jungle close up.

217
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:36,038
I didn't see much beyond the dirty white texture of a farmhouse wall

218
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:41,282
and a jagged pixel plane of some billboard bushes intersecting my soldiers' feet.

219
00:13:41,282 --> 00:13:44,545
There were four of us on my team.

220
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:48,769
There was me, my friend Simon, my colleague Mark, and my boss, Xiao.

221
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,035
This was our first match together.

222
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:54,557
We sat in a 4v4 team deathmatch lobby

223
00:13:54,557 --> 00:13:57,420
and we waited for the opposition slots to fill.

224
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,423
We made in-joke small talk, war movie cliches.

225
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,105
Mark, Mark would be the brains.

226
00:14:04,105 --> 00:14:07,067
Simon, Simon would be the maverick.

227
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:10,150
João, he would be the tough love leader.

228
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,272
Cool under pressure, ready to take the heat.

229
00:14:12,272 --> 00:14:12,952
I, I would be the first to die.

230
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:28,444
With a soft chime, the four empty slots for the other team filled up all at once.

231
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:31,787
Each new player's name had square brackets at the front.

232
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:35,410
What does that mean? I asked.

233
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,051
Nothing good, muttered Joe.

234
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:41,536
And we all chuckled, pleased with the Hollywood dialogue.

235
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:45,379
This was going to be great! Ha ha ha.

236
00:14:47,795 --> 00:14:52,476
Yeah, but what does it mean though? asked Simon.

237
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:55,217
Mark the Brain spoke up.

238
00:14:55,217 --> 00:15:00,159
They're from the same clan. It means they do this a lot.

239
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,559
It means they know what they're doing.

240
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,900
Oh dear, I said. Ha ha ha.

241
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:17,194
I remember the night that Xbox Live launched in the UK.

242
00:15:17,194 --> 00:15:23,016
The only people were journalists like I was in 2001, or Microsoft employees, or players

243
00:15:23,016 --> 00:15:26,497
who had applied to beta test, who'd understood what a beta test is.

244
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:33,260
We call those players the hardcore, an adjective that implies obsessive dedication and often

245
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,500
anti-social behaviour.

246
00:15:35,537 --> 00:15:38,920
But the atmosphere that night was not aggressive or even competitive.

247
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,042
It was singing with joy and curiosity and friendship.

248
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:48,786
A thousand strangers on their first night on an internet cruise ship,

249
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:50,647
marvelling at the vessel, fumbling for the right etiquette.

250
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:57,392
Deathmatch is the first-person shooter term for a simple kill-or-be-killed multiplayer fight,

251
00:15:57,392 --> 00:16:02,035
where death, as so often in video games, is an inconvenience.

252
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:04,056
It's a quick restart and on with the show.

253
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:09,487
Like lots of video game neologisms, we don't think about the etymology.

254
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:13,871
It's so universal that it's its own thing now, like the word video game itself.

255
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:19,556
From Masters of Doom, David Kushner's 2004 History of Id Software,

256
00:16:19,556 --> 00:16:21,838
John Romero comments on the word's origin.

257
00:16:23,894 --> 00:16:29,918
Sure, it was fun to shoot monsters, but ultimately they're soulless creatures controlled by a computer.

258
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:33,061
Now gamers could play against spontaneous human beings,

259
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:37,244
opponents who could think and strategize and scream.

260
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:39,666
We can kill each other!

261
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,549
If we can get this done, this is going to be the fucking coolest game

262
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:46,952
that the planet Earth has ever fucking seen in its entire history.

263
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:47,773
And he was right, I guess.

264
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:56,586
In a death match game of Unreal Championship

265
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:59,068
on the very first night of Xbox Live

266
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:02,650
inside a science fiction warehouse on an empty server,

267
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,251
I hopped and skipped and bounced around

268
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:07,772
until I stumbled upon a second player,

269
00:17:07,772 --> 00:17:09,814
a low-poly space marine,

270
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:12,255
spinning and staring at the ceiling.

271
00:17:12,255 --> 00:17:13,476
It seemed poor form to just, you know, shoot him.

272
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:27,178
So I called down from my position, high up on the scaffolded gantry.

273
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:27,498
Hello?

274
00:17:27,498 --> 00:17:31,119
I offered cautiously.

275
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,501
Oh, hey there,

276
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:43,265
he said, turning his spacesuit, his body, his head, and his gun to face me.

277
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:46,426
He performed this kind of double hop.

278
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:48,656
and I read it as delight.

279
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:51,317
And then he ran off to another corner of the room,

280
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:52,718
and then he ran back again.

281
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:52,998
Sorry, he said.

282
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:57,640
I'm just trying to see the sun.

283
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,841
If it's there, I haven't found it yet.

284
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:04,422
I took a look at the roof above me,

285
00:18:04,422 --> 00:18:07,303
nothing more than dull rivets and gunmetal panels,

286
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:10,084
and then I climbed down the ladder to join my new friend.

287
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,511
Hello again, I said.

288
00:18:13,511 --> 00:18:15,852
I thought about offering my hand,

289
00:18:15,852 --> 00:18:19,753
but it was attached to my gun, so I hopped instead.

290
00:18:19,753 --> 00:18:20,853
What's the weather like up there, he asked,

291
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:24,835
twisting his whole body towards the gantry.

292
00:18:24,835 --> 00:18:29,776
No sun either, I'm afraid, I said.

293
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,617
I love a good skybox, he said.

294
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:37,359
I love the feeling there's more in the world to explore,

295
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,060
even when there probably isn't.

296
00:18:42,398 --> 00:18:43,759
I double-hopped in agreement and we both fell silent.

297
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:44,799
This is weird, isn't it? I said.

298
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,900
It is a bit, he replied. More silence, headset static.

299
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,420
It is a bit weird, he added.

300
00:19:10,518 --> 00:19:12,921
We began to explore the level together.

301
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:16,324
In another room, god rays cut through precisely engineered rips

302
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:18,626
in a rusting metal ceiling,

303
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:23,351
cast our darting shadows as ballroom dancers

304
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:25,653
on the dirt texture floor.

305
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:27,335
But we still couldn't see the sun.

306
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:29,276
Eventually, we were back where we started.

307
00:19:29,276 --> 00:19:31,439
The gentle conversation drifted to silence,

308
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:35,903
and we both knew that we had to bring this relationship to a close somehow.

309
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:47,922
So, he ventured, slowly twisting to face me, eyes dead as a mannequin, ugly heavy weapon

310
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:49,283
pointed squarely at my gut.

311
00:19:49,283 --> 00:19:50,024
Should I, er, shoot you now?

312
00:20:02,757 --> 00:20:06,559
The phrase double tap predates video games

313
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,181
and has an established meaning outside our weird parochial language.

314
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:13,442
It is not just a second press of X.

315
00:20:13,442 --> 00:20:17,464
Developed by British police chiefs in Shanghai in the 30s,

316
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:19,925
the double tap is the practice of firing two shots

317
00:20:19,925 --> 00:20:23,187
in quick succession into the same location.

318
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:24,928
It is an exercise in pragmatism,

319
00:20:24,928 --> 00:20:28,770
the purpose being to ensure a target is functionally disabled.

320
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:35,094
For example, a person may, rolling the dice, survive a single shot to the head.

321
00:20:35,094 --> 00:20:37,657
But to survive two is vanishingly unlikely.

322
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:45,504
So force those odds. Pull the trigger twice. Double tap.

323
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:51,390
In an online essay for NRA magazine, American Rifleman, entitled,

324
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,171
The Art of the Double Tap.

325
00:20:54,353 --> 00:21:00,315
Writer Matt Lindler describes the practical difficulties of executing what in theory sounds

326
00:21:00,315 --> 00:21:01,816
like a simple maneuver.

327
00:21:01,816 --> 00:21:09,318
It takes time and ammunition to learn to rebound from recoil quickly enough to conduct a second

328
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:12,199
tap, writes Lindler.

329
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:16,540
Begin by quickly firing two aimed shots at a target with a safe background.

330
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,382
Continue until you can consistently put two shots within five inches of one another in

331
00:21:21,382 --> 00:21:22,422
one to two seconds.

332
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:27,371
Under a subheading, why not a triple tap?

333
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:30,593
Lindler argues that a case can be made

334
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:33,575
for putting as many bullets as it takes into a bad guy.

335
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:37,818
The NRA often refer to their targets as bad guys.

336
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:40,380
Before arriving at the conclusion

337
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,622
that really, two shots should probably be enough.

338
00:21:43,622 --> 00:21:47,044
These days, he laments,

339
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:49,166
you have to defend your actions to the world.

340
00:21:53,037 --> 00:22:01,262
Language changes as we change, and Double Tap has taken on an even more sinister meaning in the last few years.

341
00:22:01,262 --> 00:22:09,066
It describes the practice adopted by terrorists of a secondary attack in the same location as the first, designed to target first responders.

342
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:17,450
Abdelhamid Aboud, one of the ringleaders of the Paris attacks, returned to the Bataclan.

343
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,652
He stood outside as the emergency services struggled to deal with the unthinkable.

344
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:25,287
And then he ran.

345
00:22:25,287 --> 00:22:30,570
Inside the theater, gunmen moved from body to body,

346
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,272
checking to see if their targets were still alive.

347
00:22:34,272 --> 00:22:35,232
Double tap.

348
00:22:35,232 --> 00:22:47,678
Games highlighted by Google in a search for Game of the Year 2015.

349
00:22:49,313 --> 00:23:00,224
The Witcher, Bloodborne, Metal Gear Solid V, Until Dawn, Fallout 4, Rise of the Tomb Raider,

350
00:23:00,224 --> 00:23:06,570
Arkham Knight, Halo 5, Splatoon, Call of Duty Black Ops 3, and Rocket League.

351
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,407
Downwell, a short, playful indie game from that same year, is described as delightful

352
00:23:17,407 --> 00:23:22,333
and charming, and I do not disagree with that. It is kinetic, responsive, instinctive, stylish

353
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:28,600
and fun. But it is a game where your objective is to destroy everything you can, firing guns

354
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,143
from your feet as you fall down a well.

355
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:36,272
Blackroom, Romero's first-person shooter pitch,

356
00:23:36,272 --> 00:23:38,914
describes itself on its abandoned Kickstarter page

357
00:23:38,914 --> 00:23:42,598
as a return to vast, violent, and masterful play.

358
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:46,562
It promises that each weapon has a specific use

359
00:23:46,562 --> 00:23:49,125
and does the damage that makes you feel good.

360
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:56,463
Gunsport is a bright, beautiful, smart take on volleyball

361
00:23:56,463 --> 00:23:59,724
that is intelligently designed and so fun to play,

362
00:23:59,724 --> 00:24:03,566
where you use sleek, expensive, sports-styled weaponry

363
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:06,568
to shoot a ball over a net and into a goal.

364
00:24:06,568 --> 00:24:09,390
20 million people have played

365
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,091
the cartoon-style Team Fortress 2 on Steam,

366
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:15,353
collectively spending 1.4 billion hours

367
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,994
killing each other for fun.

368
00:24:18,787 --> 00:24:23,851
A patch for GTA V still riding high in the sales charts nearly four years after release.

369
00:24:23,851 --> 00:24:29,216
The fastest selling game of all time allows you to play it in VR and it looks like this.

370
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,967
Of the 50 best-selling video games in the UK in 2015,

371
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:47,428
41 of them involve some kind of shooting mechanic.

372
00:24:47,428 --> 00:24:49,429
And of those 9 that are left, 8 of them are sports games.

373
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:50,829
The other one is Mortal Kombat.

374
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:55,531
It's a running joke in video games that lovable rogue Nathan Drake

375
00:24:55,531 --> 00:24:56,511
is actually a mass murderer.

376
00:25:09,628 --> 00:25:14,852
Your first action in Uncharted 2 is to kill some minimum wage security guards

377
00:25:14,852 --> 00:25:16,713
who are trying to protect a national museum.

378
00:25:16,713 --> 00:25:23,178
You will have triggered the death animations of around 800 more simulated people

379
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:24,739
by the time the credits roll.

380
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:27,641
Ha ha ha.

381
00:25:35,245 --> 00:25:41,024
The night of the Paris shootings felt grimly familiar, viewed through the telescopic lens of the internet.

382
00:25:42,362 --> 00:25:47,883
Like a bad dream, unreal, inescapable, closing your eyes and knowing what's about to happen

383
00:25:47,883 --> 00:25:49,584
and praying that it's not.

384
00:25:49,584 --> 00:25:53,825
A cold news ticker reads gunfire reported.

385
00:25:53,825 --> 00:25:59,086
The absence of information is slowly shaded in with gruesome detail and there is nothing

386
00:25:59,086 --> 00:26:04,907
you can do as your stomach drops, just gawk at the live blogs as the horror unfolds and

387
00:26:04,907 --> 00:26:06,207
the numbers rise.

388
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:10,733
Keep watching as the body count climbs. You know that you're being ghoulish,

389
00:26:10,733 --> 00:26:13,998
but you can hardly return to the game you were playing. Not now.

390
00:26:16,312 --> 00:26:20,333
Many of my friends who make video games, the people who read when I write,

391
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:23,733
who listen when I talk, who come to events like this,

392
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:28,715
people like you, a young, empathic, anti-gun, outspoken.

393
00:26:28,715 --> 00:26:32,856
And whenever there's another mass shooting in the US every other fucking day,

394
00:26:32,856 --> 00:26:35,996
I see the ones who live there speak out.

395
00:26:35,996 --> 00:26:36,977
Fuck the NRA.

396
00:26:36,977 --> 00:26:39,177
The Second Amendment has to change.

397
00:26:39,177 --> 00:26:40,237
America has a problem.

398
00:26:40,237 --> 00:26:43,838
What will it take before we are compelled to do something about that?

399
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:49,288
The Europeans, they offer sympathy and words of advice.

400
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:52,731
They are horrified and relieved.

401
00:26:52,731 --> 00:26:54,452
It's not our problem.

402
00:26:54,452 --> 00:27:01,097
Just like when we hear gunfire televised from the Ukraine,

403
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:01,878
from Syria, from Palestine, from Iraq.

404
00:27:01,878 --> 00:27:06,101
The day after Paris, I watched the same people

405
00:27:06,101 --> 00:27:08,763
struggle to deal with bloodshed much closer to home.

406
00:27:09,982 --> 00:27:14,946
There was so much sadness and anger and above all, a lack of comprehension.

407
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:18,610
How could anyone do this? How could anyone do this here?

408
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:23,054
That phrase thrown into the void with no expectation of an answer

409
00:27:23,054 --> 00:27:28,520
because the question is drowning in thousands of years of politics and religion and history and hate.

410
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,423
But still, how could anyone do this?

411
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:34,210
How could anyone, anyone do this?

412
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:39,474
How could anyone switch off another human like a light?

413
00:27:39,474 --> 00:27:42,836
How can you look at a gun and not feel revulsion

414
00:27:42,836 --> 00:27:44,478
at a tool designed to do just that?

415
00:27:44,478 --> 00:27:51,722
And then, slowly, the red mist of other people's blood fades.

416
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:54,807
and we drift back to our lives,

417
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:57,968
where we play and we write about and we promote and we create games,

418
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:01,508
so many of which fixate on and profit from those same tools.

419
00:28:01,508 --> 00:28:04,229
The game began and our team spawned outside the farmhouse.

420
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:06,069
It was a nighttime map, pitch black.

421
00:28:20,981 --> 00:28:25,044
Put on your night sights, commanded Xiao, you'll see better.

422
00:28:25,044 --> 00:28:30,288
The grey and black world became a green and black world,

423
00:28:30,288 --> 00:28:32,650
but that felt fancy and military.

424
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:32,851
Sure.

425
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:38,715
I scanned the jungle in the distance.

426
00:28:38,715 --> 00:28:42,699
Can't see much, but they're out there.

427
00:28:42,699 --> 00:28:44,840
I paused for dramatic effect.

428
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,501
Somewhere.

429
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:49,384
Then, from nowhere, gunfire.

430
00:28:52,993 --> 00:28:56,234
move, get inside, shouted Joao,

431
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,875
and our group made a dash for the farmhouse entrance.

432
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:00,356
But there was no entrance,

433
00:29:00,356 --> 00:29:02,456
or we couldn't find it at least,

434
00:29:02,456 --> 00:29:05,237
perhaps because we had our night sights on

435
00:29:05,237 --> 00:29:08,158
and everything was green and confusing.

436
00:29:08,158 --> 00:29:09,899
So we kept running and we ended up

437
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:11,800
on the other side of the house,

438
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,740
crouching in different bushes.

439
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,660
Okay, said Simon, what now?

440
00:29:21,957 --> 00:29:24,999
Joao changed his stance from prone to crouch walk.

441
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:31,084
I've got this, he said with comforting confidence.

442
00:29:31,084 --> 00:29:32,726
The entrance is over here somewhere.

443
00:29:32,726 --> 00:29:38,891
His words were abbreviated by two precise shots

444
00:29:38,891 --> 00:29:40,172
from somewhere in the darkness.

445
00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:43,315
And I watched his bright green body slump

446
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:44,476
into the shadows on the floor.

447
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,828
I don't know how this is going, right?

448
00:29:53,828 --> 00:29:55,849
I have no idea how this is going.

449
00:29:55,849 --> 00:29:57,611
I do not know what you're thinking.

450
00:29:57,611 --> 00:29:59,132
I don't get to control that.

451
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:03,555
I do not have complete control over this situation.

452
00:30:03,555 --> 00:30:03,855
I have some.

453
00:30:03,855 --> 00:30:04,276
Here is a theory.

454
00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:12,502
Life is a terrifying collision of a billion events

455
00:30:12,502 --> 00:30:14,984
that are all out of your control.

456
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:22,339
From beginning to end, we are offered choices, decisions, questions, and the answers we give

457
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:24,660
have little to no bearing on the result.

458
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:30,042
You take the dream job and it makes you miserable.

459
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:32,423
You find the right guy, but you're the wrong girl.

460
00:30:32,423 --> 00:30:35,124
You live a cautious life, and then you get hit by a stray bullet.

461
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:46,510
That unpredictability, that lack of foresight is important,

462
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:52,395
because if this thing was a movie, if we knew what was going to happen,

463
00:30:52,395 --> 00:30:55,177
then we would sleep our way through it.

464
00:30:55,177 --> 00:30:57,699
The question marks, they keep us awake.

465
00:30:57,699 --> 00:31:02,603
The unknown is terrifying and confusing, but it is also thrilling.

466
00:31:02,603 --> 00:31:03,264
We cannot see the future.

467
00:31:03,264 --> 00:31:05,305
Except sometimes, sometimes, for a moment, we can.

468
00:31:12,212 --> 00:31:16,914
There are brief, tiny moments in life where things feel wholly under our control,

469
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:21,075
where we get to decide what happens, and they are relief.

470
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:25,697
When I hit the light switch and I know that the light is going to turn on,

471
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:28,098
and then the light turns on,

472
00:31:28,098 --> 00:31:31,940
for a microsecond, I am a prophet.

473
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:35,741
And the more complex and skillful that action,

474
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:39,184
the more weight and satisfaction the action carries.

475
00:31:39,184 --> 00:31:43,869
The right key goes in the right lock, and it turns first time.

476
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:47,132
I change the batteries in the remote, and it works again.

477
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:49,714
If I can throw this ball of paper in that bin,

478
00:31:49,714 --> 00:31:53,678
I will find true love.

479
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:54,019
Next time.

480
00:32:00,714 --> 00:32:05,679
In each case, we imagine what happens, we make it happen,

481
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,942
and that makes us momentarily happy.

482
00:32:07,942 --> 00:32:11,386
That we have managed not just to predict the future,

483
00:32:11,386 --> 00:32:12,408
but engineer it.

484
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:16,072
We are gods, tiny gods who operate light switches.

485
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:23,967
Video games are that level of control, inconsequential satisfaction offered in a completely safe

486
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:24,928
environment.

487
00:32:24,928 --> 00:32:29,410
We are asked a question, we supply an answer from the choices that were offered, we think

488
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:35,694
we know what's going to happen next, and then usually it does, over and over again.

489
00:32:35,694 --> 00:32:41,497
Each action we perform has some kind of predictable consequence, and shooting is a perfect example

490
00:32:41,497 --> 00:32:42,138
of that.

491
00:32:42,138 --> 00:32:46,700
You aim, you see the future, you fire, and the enemy falls down.

492
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,162
But it's not the only example.

493
00:32:51,162 --> 00:32:54,045
So why are we so fixated on firearms?

494
00:32:54,045 --> 00:32:56,187
I mean, history plays a part, of course.

495
00:32:56,187 --> 00:32:58,029
We've been killing things since space war

496
00:32:58,029 --> 00:33:00,752
and every game prepares you for the next.

497
00:33:00,752 --> 00:33:03,435
The performance side of firing a weapon matters too.

498
00:33:03,435 --> 00:33:06,498
Players are actors, guns are the perfect prop,

499
00:33:06,498 --> 00:33:09,101
the sound and the fury, the glamor, the forbidden cool.

500
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:14,616
Those things play the part, but I think the main reason is that shooting is such an easy,

501
00:33:14,616 --> 00:33:19,257
understandable solution to challenge for us as designers.

502
00:33:19,257 --> 00:33:25,258
It's a discrete action with a binary result that can be layered to alter difficulty.

503
00:33:25,258 --> 00:33:30,400
You make a digital choice, touch a trigger, and after that you lose control.

504
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,161
The bullet continues towards a future that you can no longer alter, but one that you

505
00:33:35,161 --> 00:33:36,341
have anticipated.

506
00:33:36,341 --> 00:33:38,062
You're a tiny god.

507
00:33:39,314 --> 00:33:45,376
Now, can you shoot two things?

508
00:33:45,376 --> 00:33:48,097
What about four, but they're further away?

509
00:33:48,097 --> 00:33:49,778
Don't worry, they're bad guys.

510
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:53,940
Fine, but the game designer's portrayal is, by necessity,

511
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,741
an idealized, sanitized sketch of a gun.

512
00:33:56,741 --> 00:33:58,482
When we point and click,

513
00:33:58,482 --> 00:34:01,423
when we respond to the violent, leading question

514
00:34:01,423 --> 00:34:02,663
asked by the developer

515
00:34:02,663 --> 00:34:05,924
with the only answer that they let us give,

516
00:34:05,924 --> 00:34:07,645
yes and yes again.

517
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:11,408
The result is unemotional. A one or a zero.

518
00:34:11,408 --> 00:34:14,130
As quick and effective as turning out a light.

519
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:18,373
There is no recoil beyond the spinning whir of our haptic feedback.

520
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:20,555
It is clean and it is satisfying.

521
00:34:20,555 --> 00:34:23,737
A headshot is always an instant kill.

522
00:34:23,737 --> 00:34:30,342
If the consequences of shooting a real gun were that kind, clinical, binary,

523
00:34:30,342 --> 00:34:32,284
the double tap would not exist.

524
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:40,359
A bullet is not fictional, but physical.

525
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:44,963
A piece of metal, maybe the size of the tip of your little finger.

526
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:48,146
At the rear of the bullet is a primer, which when struck,

527
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:49,287
creates a small explosion.

528
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:54,592
That explosion ignites the propellant in the middle section of the bullet.

529
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,595
The propellant produces gas, which accelerates the bullet down the gun barrel.

530
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,926
As it leaves, it's traveling around 300 meters a second,

531
00:35:02,926 --> 00:35:05,569
a speed so fast we can't register it as movement.

532
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:09,492
The result of firing a gun is effectively instantaneous to us.

533
00:35:09,492 --> 00:35:10,012
Point, click, done.

534
00:35:10,012 --> 00:35:10,773
We avoid detail.

535
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:16,678
We do not think about what actually happens

536
00:35:16,678 --> 00:35:18,920
when a bullet strikes skin and bone.

537
00:35:19,728 --> 00:35:23,632
We know this is not really an off switch, but it feels like one,

538
00:35:23,632 --> 00:35:27,035
partly because of its treatment in media, Hollywood and our own,

539
00:35:27,035 --> 00:35:30,599
and partly because of the speed at which it happens.

540
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,481
We want to feel the challenge.

541
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:34,042
We don't want to feel the horror.

542
00:35:35,623 --> 00:35:40,204
So, slow it down. Slow it all the way down.

543
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:44,905
The bullet, which has no mind of its own and simply follows our instructions,

544
00:35:44,905 --> 00:35:49,966
leaves the barrel of the gun and moves forward until it reaches something

545
00:35:49,966 --> 00:35:52,306
that will provide resistance.

546
00:35:52,306 --> 00:35:57,767
Perhaps that is a wall or perhaps that is the floor.

547
00:35:57,767 --> 00:35:59,588
In this instance, it is a person.

548
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:07,875
On contact, the bullet punches through the skin in slow motion, millisecond by millisecond,

549
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:08,336
a tiny metal fist.

550
00:36:08,336 --> 00:36:12,198
The skin gives way to tissue and the bullet continues pushing.

551
00:36:12,198 --> 00:36:15,180
It strikes bone and only slows it down a fraction.

552
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:19,502
The bone, tough but brittle, cracks first and then it splinters.

553
00:36:19,502 --> 00:36:25,005
The bullet pushes the shattered bone to the side and continues forward, cuts through more

554
00:36:25,005 --> 00:36:27,567
tissue, tears through another layer of skin, out the other side.

555
00:36:29,124 --> 00:36:33,426
Blood rushes into the hole and spills to the floor.

556
00:36:33,426 --> 00:36:36,668
Someone cries out, or perhaps they can't speak

557
00:36:36,668 --> 00:36:39,749
because their throat is full of blood and they are choking.

558
00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:40,750
A producer at a major games publisher

559
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:45,872
shows me their World War II first-person shooter,

560
00:36:45,872 --> 00:36:49,434
which begins with an epic opening

561
00:36:49,434 --> 00:36:51,495
based on the Normandy landings.

562
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:55,009
Yeah, we wanted it to be as realistic as possible, they say.

563
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:58,831
We wanted you to feel what it was like to be there, the fear, the confusion, the chaos.

564
00:36:58,831 --> 00:37:00,972
I notice there's no blood in your game, I say.

565
00:37:00,972 --> 00:37:02,132
Yeah, that's a certification issue, they reply.

566
00:37:22,986 --> 00:37:29,807
After Paris, I decided that, for a while at least, I would stop playing games about shooting.

567
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:34,368
I settled on this definition, games where any core mechanic sees the player firing a

568
00:37:34,368 --> 00:37:36,388
projectile intended to cause damage.

569
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:42,910
That usually means guns, but is a wide enough definition to include missiles, arrows, lightning

570
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:49,331
bolts, fireball spells, tiny clusters of 2D pixels in side-scrollers and red shells loosed

571
00:37:49,331 --> 00:37:50,331
from the front of your cart.

572
00:37:51,956 --> 00:37:54,717
Most games are about shooting, it turns out.

573
00:37:54,717 --> 00:37:55,758
It was a restrictive rule.

574
00:37:55,758 --> 00:37:58,779
What did I discover apart from that?

575
00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:03,822
Right from the start, it made me ask questions all of the time,

576
00:38:03,822 --> 00:38:05,422
of the material and myself.

577
00:38:05,422 --> 00:38:07,823
Was it guns I was objecting to or violence?

578
00:38:07,823 --> 00:38:08,924
What about knives?

579
00:38:08,924 --> 00:38:11,925
What about gun-laden stealth games that give you the option,

580
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:15,587
even encourage you, to finish them without ever shooting?

581
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:16,768
Would I play Mirror's Edge?

582
00:38:16,768 --> 00:38:18,509
What about The Last of Us?

583
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:19,589
Would I still play Downwell?

584
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,580
And I found these answers as I went.

585
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,321
Knives are real.

586
00:38:24,321 --> 00:38:26,042
So is knife violence.

587
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:28,804
But as my exploration was specifically about gun violence

588
00:38:28,804 --> 00:38:30,565
and how that dominates the form,

589
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:33,027
I would not play Metal Gear Solid.

590
00:38:33,027 --> 00:38:34,508
I would not play Metal Gear

591
00:38:34,508 --> 00:38:36,649
because its questions are framed around guns,

592
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:38,250
even if a valid answer is to avoid them.

593
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,591
And I wouldn't play Mirror's Edge either,

594
00:38:40,591 --> 00:38:43,593
though I completed the first one without firing a shot.

595
00:38:43,593 --> 00:38:44,854
I stopped playing Danwell.

596
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:52,689
Those answers, and my frustration at trying to find games I could play, made me more sure

597
00:38:52,689 --> 00:38:54,050
how I feel.

598
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:59,672
I am uncomfortable with games' part in how we perceive guns as a clean, clinical, digital

599
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:06,755
solution to a problem, and their fetishisation as shiny, beautiful collectibles or fast,

600
00:39:06,755 --> 00:39:07,855
fun solutions.

601
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:14,840
My silent, or not so silent right now, protest was initially against that.

602
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:22,031
I don't want to be part of a system that I believe is playing a very real part in sanitising gun violence.

603
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:26,988
But I also started to wonder how our preoccupation with guns

604
00:39:26,988 --> 00:39:29,489
affects the questions that game designers are asking.

605
00:39:29,489 --> 00:39:31,930
Because again, that is what makes us different.

606
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:34,691
That is what games are, a story framed

607
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:37,132
by a series of questions then answered by the player.

608
00:39:37,132 --> 00:39:40,714
And the only question we are asking time and time and time

609
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:41,855
again is this.

610
00:39:41,855 --> 00:39:44,596
Can you predict where the object will

611
00:39:44,596 --> 00:39:45,796
be in a fraction of a second?

612
00:39:45,796 --> 00:39:48,418
Can you stop the bad guy who's in the way?

613
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:52,210
It will be clean, simple, I promise.

614
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,251
Point and click, maybe a splash of red,

615
00:39:55,251 --> 00:39:56,211
maybe not even that.

616
00:39:56,211 --> 00:40:00,612
The player, human and predictable,

617
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:02,333
optimistic and violent to the last,

618
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,153
returns the only answer we give them.

619
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:04,313
Yes.

620
00:40:04,313 --> 00:40:05,834
Red Eye, Edge 129, November 2003.

621
00:40:22,107 --> 00:40:29,853
On the evening of June 25, Aaron Hamill, a 45-year-old nurse from Knoxville, Tennessee,

622
00:40:29,853 --> 00:40:32,956
was driving on the I-40 highway through nearby Newport.

623
00:40:32,956 --> 00:40:37,840
His cousin Denise was in the passenger seat.

624
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,344
The pair were on their way back from a day out in the mountains.

625
00:40:43,053 --> 00:40:46,054
We were driving down the interstate back from a great trip,

626
00:40:46,054 --> 00:40:48,114
Denise later told ABC News.

627
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:49,975
My cousin said,

628
00:40:49,975 --> 00:40:51,555
Hey, look at these flowers.

629
00:40:51,555 --> 00:40:55,816
And then all of a sudden, through the window came a bullet.

630
00:40:55,816 --> 00:40:59,357
The heat was so much I could feel it.

631
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:01,778
On my lap, I saw lots of glass and lots of blood.

632
00:41:01,778 --> 00:41:02,598
I thought that I'd been shot.

633
00:41:02,598 --> 00:41:04,218
But she hadn't.

634
00:41:04,218 --> 00:41:07,739
The blood belonged to Aaron, her cousin,

635
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:10,660
the driver of a car now out of control,

636
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,760
traveling at 70 miles per hour against traffic.

637
00:41:14,298 --> 00:41:17,983
Imagine that, covered in blood and glass and God knows what else,

638
00:41:17,983 --> 00:41:20,066
in a speeding vehicle you have no way of stopping.

639
00:41:20,066 --> 00:41:24,111
And when the car finally, fortunately, grinds to a stop against a guardrail,

640
00:41:24,111 --> 00:41:26,214
imagine looking to the driver's seat

641
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:29,879
and seeing blood gushing from a wound in your cousin's temple.

642
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:31,361
Headshot. Instant kill.

643
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:37,170
On August 28th, 13-year-old Joshua Buckner

644
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,552
and his 16-year-old stepbrother William pled guilty

645
00:41:39,552 --> 00:41:42,535
to the reckless homicide of Aaron Hamill.

646
00:41:42,535 --> 00:41:45,337
Joshua had stolen two .22 caliber rifles

647
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:48,079
from his parents' closet the week before the shootings

648
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,741
and hidden them in the nearby woods.

649
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:53,724
On the evening of June 25th, the pair headed to a small hill

650
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:55,665
with a line of sight to the I-40.

651
00:41:55,665 --> 00:41:59,488
Their intention was to shoot at the sides of passing trucks.

652
00:41:59,488 --> 00:42:00,769
They were bored.

653
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:02,351
They'd been inspired by Grand Theft Auto.

654
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:09,131
Red Eye was a column that I wrote at Edge for four years,

655
00:42:09,131 --> 00:42:11,812
the magazine's only voice under a style guide

656
00:42:11,812 --> 00:42:15,153
that was pointedly poker-faced and anonymous.

657
00:42:15,153 --> 00:42:17,393
The editorial staff were very close,

658
00:42:17,393 --> 00:42:20,074
Mark, David, my editor Joao and I,

659
00:42:20,074 --> 00:42:23,895
and I did my best to voice the thoughts

660
00:42:23,895 --> 00:42:26,736
that I felt we couldn't express elsewhere in the magazine,

661
00:42:26,736 --> 00:42:27,056
in theory.

662
00:42:28,597 --> 00:42:34,581
Truthfully though, Redeye was my opportunity to show off and say things that might make people cross.

663
00:42:34,581 --> 00:42:35,762
A little like today.

664
00:42:38,642 --> 00:42:43,166
So, it was the early 2000s and games were under attack, as always.

665
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:47,669
It seemed to me that the industry's defence back then was largely to refer to the treatment

666
00:42:47,669 --> 00:42:50,691
of heavy metal music or horror films from decades past.

667
00:42:50,691 --> 00:42:54,775
I watched Friday the 13th as a kid, it didn't turn me into a serial killer,

668
00:42:54,775 --> 00:42:58,477
it's just hysteria from old folk who don't understand our medium.

669
00:42:58,477 --> 00:42:58,958
Dismiss it.

670
00:43:01,117 --> 00:43:03,138
I didn't think this was right.

671
00:43:03,138 --> 00:43:06,600
I believe in games because they are different from other forms.

672
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,762
I believe they can change people for better and for worse.

673
00:43:10,762 --> 00:43:15,145
Those questions that they pose, the answers they suggest, force the player to change the

674
00:43:15,145 --> 00:43:16,646
way they think.

675
00:43:16,646 --> 00:43:19,008
And that is our medium's strength.

676
00:43:19,008 --> 00:43:21,409
But that power works without conscience.

677
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,152
Anecdotal evidence.

678
00:43:25,152 --> 00:43:27,374
I know games affect me.

679
00:43:27,374 --> 00:43:29,575
I play Tetris all day.

680
00:43:29,575 --> 00:43:32,796
If I play Tetris all day, I see blocks when I close my eyes.

681
00:43:32,796 --> 00:43:34,917
And I know I'm not alone there.

682
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:36,378
That's like a phenomenon, right?

683
00:43:36,378 --> 00:43:38,299
The Tetris effect, that's a known thing.

684
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:41,821
And when I play Grand Theft Auto all day,

685
00:43:41,821 --> 00:43:44,843
if I spend eight hours stealing cars like it's nothing,

686
00:43:44,843 --> 00:43:46,523
and then I go out into the real world,

687
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:50,285
and I walk past a car parked on my street in real life,

688
00:43:51,317 --> 00:43:56,721
I can feel a tiny part of me, tiny part of me, want to try the lock.

689
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:57,462
And I'm not alone in that.

690
00:43:57,462 --> 00:44:00,445
I hope I'm not alone in that.

691
00:44:00,445 --> 00:44:03,247
So I wrote this piece for Edge, right?

692
00:44:03,247 --> 00:44:11,514
The first part was a plea for the games industry to take the consequences of their actions

693
00:44:11,514 --> 00:44:15,018
seriously and adopt a defence less digital than,

694
00:44:15,018 --> 00:44:18,841
no, nothing we make can ever influence anyone, shut up.

695
00:44:19,643 --> 00:44:23,387
Because why would I care about games if I thought that was true?

696
00:44:23,387 --> 00:44:27,612
But there was a second target as well.

697
00:44:29,937 --> 00:44:34,621
The kids who shot Aaron Hamill were not trying to kill him.

698
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:36,862
They weren't even trying to shoot people.

699
00:44:36,862 --> 00:44:39,444
They were being reckless with a gun they'd stolen,

700
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:41,266
messing around on a hill, attempting

701
00:44:41,266 --> 00:44:44,248
to hit the back of trucks as they sped down the freeway.

702
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,449
That was what they'd done in GTA.

703
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:49,492
And some part of them should have been screaming,

704
00:44:49,492 --> 00:44:53,335
this is a terrible idea, had been worn away

705
00:44:53,335 --> 00:44:56,757
by hours of pixel-perfect gunplay in a digital world.

706
00:44:58,165 --> 00:45:03,956
It turns out that aiming in real life is more difficult than push correct on an analog stick,

707
00:45:03,956 --> 00:45:07,303
and actions have more serious consequences.

708
00:45:09,586 --> 00:45:16,232
I was tired, and I still am tired, of the way we position guns, tools explicitly designed

709
00:45:16,232 --> 00:45:21,276
to switch off humans like light switches, as glamorous, cool, fun toys.

710
00:45:21,276 --> 00:45:26,921
The way we smooth over the violence just enough to sell it.

711
00:45:26,921 --> 00:45:30,244
And even more tired of the way we sell those games to children.

712
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:35,407
We know that high schoolers form a huge part of gaming's audience.

713
00:45:35,407 --> 00:45:36,607
We knew it back then.

714
00:45:36,607 --> 00:45:39,348
We know how seriously their parents took 18 ratings.

715
00:45:39,348 --> 00:45:40,969
And we know that today, too.

716
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:46,310
And we didn't, and we still don't, fully understand

717
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:49,031
how games affect people.

718
00:45:49,031 --> 00:45:52,712
But we choose to look the other way.

719
00:45:52,712 --> 00:45:54,013
So Red Eye went to work.

720
00:45:56,532 --> 00:46:04,434
Magazine covers are full-color adverts for an 18-rated product aimed directly at under-18s.

721
00:46:04,434 --> 00:46:14,796
Magazine covers are full-color adverts for an 18-rated product aimed directly at under-18s.

722
00:46:14,796 --> 00:46:20,678
I wrote, Red Eye would be interested to hear Take-Two's defense against accusations

723
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:23,378
that it's been selling an adult experience to minors.

724
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:29,145
He wouldn't mind hearing UK magazine publishers doing the same thing,

725
00:46:29,145 --> 00:46:31,187
since from where Red Eye is sitting,

726
00:46:31,187 --> 00:46:34,830
there are an awful lot of people covered in Aaron Hamill's blood.

727
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:35,451
On page 22 of Edge 129,

728
00:46:35,451 --> 00:46:41,616
I accused my employer of acting as an accessory to murder.

729
00:46:41,616 --> 00:46:43,958
It was not a great career move.

730
00:46:49,756 --> 00:46:53,737
Worse, apparently, was that I'd said the same of Take Two,

731
00:46:53,737 --> 00:46:55,278
who were one of the company's main advertisers.

732
00:46:55,278 --> 00:46:58,899
They called the magazine the same day, furious,

733
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,459
demanding an explanation.

734
00:47:00,459 --> 00:47:03,060
Our publisher, who signed off the pages,

735
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,841
perhaps without reading them,

736
00:47:04,841 --> 00:47:06,881
called our editor into the office.

737
00:47:06,881 --> 00:47:10,883
And Joao, my boss, took responsibility for my words.

738
00:47:10,883 --> 00:47:16,084
In the end, the whole magazine was collectively disciplined,

739
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:18,485
placed under the oversight of a new senior editor.

740
00:47:19,328 --> 00:47:22,732
And within six months, we'd all left Edge.

741
00:47:22,732 --> 00:47:36,906
Actions have consequences.

742
00:47:36,906 --> 00:47:40,770
João's lifeless, khaki-mapped body fell to the floor,

743
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,271
and our team was without a leader.

744
00:47:43,257 --> 00:47:45,719
The question the game was asking of us was clear.

745
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:46,680
What now?

746
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,460
What now?

747
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,382
But there was no one ready to answer.

748
00:47:49,382 --> 00:47:51,063
Someone had to take control,

749
00:47:51,063 --> 00:47:54,766
and it was the brain's mark who moved first.

750
00:47:54,766 --> 00:47:57,108
Clear-spoken and assertive with faultless logic,

751
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:58,989
he made a decision.

752
00:47:58,989 --> 00:48:00,550
Our enemy must be on the left side of the farmhouse,

753
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:01,571
so he would lead us to cover on the right.

754
00:48:01,571 --> 00:48:02,091
He stood up.

755
00:48:02,091 --> 00:48:03,392
Wait here, he said, edging around the building.

756
00:48:03,392 --> 00:48:04,053
I'm going to check.

757
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:18,336
which left Simon and I alone.

758
00:48:18,336 --> 00:48:28,279
Which left Simon and I alone, completely alone.

759
00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:31,800
Last men standing, except not standing,

760
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,621
lying face down in some bushes.

761
00:48:33,621 --> 00:48:43,124
I know there are people in this room

762
00:48:43,124 --> 00:48:45,545
who are working on games that involve shooting.

763
00:48:46,585 --> 00:48:48,045
I am not telling you to stop.

764
00:48:48,045 --> 00:48:50,247
I've started shooting again now.

765
00:48:50,247 --> 00:48:52,508
I can tell you about that later if we have time.

766
00:48:52,508 --> 00:48:56,770
I know people like clear lessons from talks.

767
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:57,590
That's the way, right?

768
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:59,732
That's why I gave that warning at the start.

769
00:48:59,732 --> 00:49:03,093
40 slides and then a summary telling you how to feel.

770
00:49:04,627 --> 00:49:08,771
I like experiences that ask questions and let you answer them in your own way.

771
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:10,953
That's why I like video games.

772
00:49:10,953 --> 00:49:17,198
But some questions are more complex than a trigger can answer.

773
00:49:17,198 --> 00:49:17,659
So, I know and I believe.

774
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:24,605
I know games are obsessed with guns and the act of killing, specifically shooting.

775
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:30,001
You could claim that other parts of pop culture are as much at fault for glamorising firearms,

776
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:34,885
or at least argue that they have more history. But our form is different.

777
00:49:34,885 --> 00:49:39,067
Only games let you fire the gun, feel the impact, the power, the pleasure.

778
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:43,771
Only games give you control, let you answer a leading question yourself.

779
00:49:43,771 --> 00:49:49,554
And this is the hard bit. I believe that only games erode a little bit.

780
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:55,980
of the human part of us that should recoil in absolute horror at the idea of shooting

781
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:56,621
someone.

782
00:49:56,621 --> 00:49:57,382
I know gaming can change people.

783
00:49:57,382 --> 00:50:00,585
I have felt it change me.

784
00:50:00,585 --> 00:50:06,070
I want to make games that change people for the better.

785
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:09,793
And I believe that you do too.

786
00:50:12,205 --> 00:50:18,192
I believe gaming's obsession with guns is making the world worse, by inches or feet

787
00:50:18,192 --> 00:50:19,654
or miles.

788
00:50:19,654 --> 00:50:20,955
I don't know.

789
00:50:20,955 --> 00:50:21,957
But even if I'm wrong...

790
00:50:22,738 --> 00:50:29,040
I am certain, I know that the default recourse to firing projectiles is limiting games as

791
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,241
a form, limiting our audience and the stories that we tell.

792
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:37,243
I know that shooting is a fundamentally satisfying mechanic, but most of that comes from the

793
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,283
controller.

794
00:50:38,283 --> 00:50:43,164
It comes from the way that maps to those singular moments of control, prophecy and execution.

795
00:50:43,164 --> 00:50:47,066
And I believe that there are other mechanics out there as well.

796
00:50:47,066 --> 00:50:51,427
Mechanics that can provide the same feedback, offer the same feedback to the player.

797
00:50:51,427 --> 00:50:52,447
More interesting answers.

798
00:50:54,038 --> 00:50:56,660
And I know that finding those answers is not easy.

799
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,401
Finding those mechanics is not easy either.

800
00:50:59,401 --> 00:51:01,882
And it will limit your commercial opportunity.

801
00:51:01,882 --> 00:51:04,783
I believe that Uncharted 4 would have been

802
00:51:04,783 --> 00:51:07,964
a much better experience without shooting.

803
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:09,124
I know I'm not alone in that.

804
00:51:09,124 --> 00:51:12,306
But the shooting sells, that's why it's there.

805
00:51:12,306 --> 00:51:15,087
And shooting sells because we haven't taught

806
00:51:15,087 --> 00:51:17,928
enough people yet that there are more to games than shooting.

807
00:51:17,928 --> 00:51:18,968
And I know that earning money is important.

808
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:27,671
We all have to do that and sometimes that does come

809
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:30,913
at the cost of making the world a tiny bit worse.

810
00:51:30,913 --> 00:51:35,256
What's another bullet in the infinite rain of digital gunfire?

811
00:51:35,256 --> 00:51:37,398
Probably doesn't matter.

812
00:51:37,398 --> 00:51:39,999
But I believe you can make a difference, all of you.

813
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:46,603
I believe it's worth taking a stand because then others stand with you.

814
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,924
So if you want to,

815
00:51:47,924 --> 00:51:48,985
look at what you're doing.

816
00:51:53,063 --> 00:51:58,509
Look at what you're playing, look at what you're making, look at the impact of your creative

817
00:51:58,509 --> 00:52:03,955
choices, think about the questions you ask and the words you force players to repeat over and

818
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:10,302
over and over again. Think about how you produce analogue systems from digital inputs,

819
00:52:10,302 --> 00:52:13,906
moments that don't just destroy humanity but amplify it.

820
00:52:15,443 --> 00:52:17,445
Because I believe we can do better.

821
00:52:17,445 --> 00:52:21,628
And I know that because I have seen glimpses of humanity in games.

822
00:52:21,628 --> 00:52:24,510
And the most human I ever felt in a video game

823
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:26,831
was when I was lying face down in a bush,

824
00:52:26,831 --> 00:52:28,152
holding a gun that I would never use,

825
00:52:28,152 --> 00:52:32,195
searching for the right answer to an impossible question.

826
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:47,248
Simon and I are face down in the bushes and Hollywood, brave, beautiful, gun-happy Hollywood

827
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:48,749
writes the script from here.

828
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:53,350
This is a buddy picture, comedy and tragedy, the maverick and the rookie fighting near

829
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:58,611
blind against the odds, against a team of teenagers who know exactly what they're doing.

830
00:52:59,561 --> 00:53:02,082
Likely the rest of the story runs like this.

831
00:53:02,082 --> 00:53:03,423
Adrenaline kicks in.

832
00:53:03,423 --> 00:53:05,404
We surprise ourselves with fast reactions,

833
00:53:05,404 --> 00:53:08,766
animal instinct honed over a lifetime of shooting.

834
00:53:08,766 --> 00:53:12,288
We fight back to a situation where maybe we might,

835
00:53:12,288 --> 00:53:15,290
just might, beat the odds and win.

836
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,491
The gunfire is loud.

837
00:53:18,491 --> 00:53:20,412
The body count is high.

838
00:53:20,412 --> 00:53:22,233
It is still nothing like Uncharted's.

839
00:53:22,233 --> 00:53:27,636
Near the end, one of us, almost certainly me,

840
00:53:27,636 --> 00:53:28,837
gets shot, pop, pop.

841
00:53:29,657 --> 00:53:33,420
delivers an inspirational monologue as we're dying, I'm dying.

842
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:40,065
The other one, almost certainly Simon, is the hero in a one-on-one fight against the

843
00:53:40,065 --> 00:53:40,805
team's leader.

844
00:53:40,805 --> 00:53:45,369
There is some bullet ballet, the boss drops, and we win.

845
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:49,052
For Joao, whispers Simon.

846
00:53:49,052 --> 00:53:49,412
Credits roll.

847
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,631
But here's what actually happened.

848
00:53:58,631 --> 00:54:01,172
Simon and I stayed exactly where we were,

849
00:54:01,172 --> 00:54:02,272
face down in the bushes,

850
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:04,493
where we knew we were safe and we couldn't be seen.

851
00:54:04,493 --> 00:54:08,494
And twice, I glimpsed someone from the other team

852
00:54:08,494 --> 00:54:11,015
duck out of the jungle and then retreat.

853
00:54:11,872 --> 00:54:17,237
I tracked them in my crosshairs, but I couldn't be sure I would make the shot, or even if

854
00:54:17,237 --> 00:54:20,360
a single shot would be enough, because death is not always digital.

855
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:25,584
And besides, I knew the gunfire would attract attention, so why bother?

856
00:54:25,584 --> 00:54:28,287
I took my finger off the trigger, and I didn't put it back.

857
00:54:30,565 --> 00:54:33,367
And in those moments, Simon and I were human,

858
00:54:33,367 --> 00:54:35,609
freed from a script that we'd been given,

859
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:38,491
vulnerable, blind to the future, aware death would come,

860
00:54:38,491 --> 00:54:40,513
but enjoying the world while we could.

861
00:54:40,513 --> 00:54:43,195
We made jokes, we talked about the game, the world,

862
00:54:43,195 --> 00:54:46,998
considered plans we knew we would never execute.

863
00:54:46,998 --> 00:54:49,740
We didn't know how to answer the game's questions.

864
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:52,002
We barely even knew how to stand up.

865
00:54:52,002 --> 00:54:58,587
We lay there and we giggled under a bush for seven minutes,

866
00:54:58,587 --> 00:54:59,728
and it was glorious.

867
00:55:01,156 --> 00:55:06,718
I looked around and everything was beautiful.

868
00:55:06,718 --> 00:55:09,300
I looked up, but I couldn't see the sun,

869
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:13,001
not even through my night sight.

870
00:55:13,001 --> 00:55:16,303
Seven and a half minutes after the game started,

871
00:55:16,303 --> 00:55:18,664
about seven minutes after Mark and Joao's deaths,

872
00:55:18,664 --> 00:55:19,664
I heard footsteps.

873
00:55:19,664 --> 00:55:24,246
Simon's prone form slowly span on the spot

874
00:55:24,246 --> 00:55:26,968
as a luminous green ghost ran towards him.

875
00:55:28,919 --> 00:55:31,441
he didn't have time to make any kind of speech.

876
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:38,967
And then the bad guy turned to face me.

877
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:40,388
Hello?

878
00:55:40,388 --> 00:55:42,911
I said, hopefully.

879
00:55:42,911 --> 00:55:47,755
Half a question, only one answer.

880
00:55:47,755 --> 00:55:48,255
Double tap.

881
00:56:02,313 --> 00:56:17,721
That's the end of it.

882
00:56:17,721 --> 00:56:18,241
So...

883
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:22,103
I have...

884
00:56:22,103 --> 00:56:22,383
I have...

885
00:56:22,383 --> 00:56:24,044
I don't know how long do we have left?

886
00:56:24,044 --> 00:56:26,065
Three minutes.

887
00:56:26,065 --> 00:56:26,325
Okay.

888
00:56:27,644 --> 00:56:35,631
Okay, I have an epilogue but I can tell you the epilogue in the wrap-up room, which is 2022, I think.

889
00:56:35,631 --> 00:56:36,952
That's where I'll be going anyway.

890
00:56:36,952 --> 00:56:41,235
Thank you all so much for coming and thank you for your patience.

891
00:56:41,235 --> 00:56:45,699
Sorry about my voice, which went a little bit, but you all did very well.

892
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:46,740
Now we can all nap, I think.

893
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,121
See you later.
