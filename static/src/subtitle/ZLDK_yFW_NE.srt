1
00:00:06,292 --> 00:00:08,894
Hello, my name is Yoshifumi Hashimoto,

2
00:00:08,894 --> 00:00:11,516
the executive officer and CCO of Marvelous AQL.

3
00:00:11,516 --> 00:00:12,597
Today, I'm going to talk about how to make an RPG.

4
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:14,318
My main focus is the role of a producer.

5
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:15,119
In terms of the work involved,

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:15,879
I take helm of various projects.

7
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:16,640
But depending on the game,

8
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:40,579
I'll take on the role of an all-around supporter or write the scenario and even come up with

9
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:43,041
settings and names, and at times attend voiceover recordings and act as an audio director.

10
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:47,545
When I get heavily involved, I'll get into the game design and decide what kind of game

11
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:48,926
we're going to make.

12
00:01:06,337 --> 00:01:10,818
I simply love making things, so I try to get involved on various aspects of the projects

13
00:01:10,818 --> 00:01:11,198
that we're doing.

14
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:14,779
The RPG titles I've worked on, as you can see here, are Rune Factory, Muramasa, the

15
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,153
Lesser-known niche games also include Avalon Code and Valhalla Knights.

16
00:01:38,153 --> 00:01:43,798
I also worked on an online compatible RPG called Grand Knights History, which was only released in Japan.

17
00:01:43,798 --> 00:01:47,761
I've also made simulation games like Harvest Moon, but today I'll focus on talking about making RPGs.

18
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:11,115
So enough with the introductions, and this is the outline of our session today.

19
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:14,736
It'll probably be difficult to convey the work involved by simply describing them,

20
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:17,678
so I'll go into talking about things that actually happened

21
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:21,220
and what we decided to do at those instances.

22
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,401
I think that'll make things easier to understand.

23
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:32,470
and you'll get much more useful information out of it.

24
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,870
So we'll talk about actual concerns, problems, issues,

25
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,971
and challenges that we face with these titles.

26
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:35,792
Let's first talk about RuneFactory.

27
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:05,153
The concept of this game is living the fantasy life.

28
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:11,135
The main theme isn't necessarily about the often used premise of

29
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:11,975
adventure.

30
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:14,876
It's about living a relaxed life in a fantasy world, and

31
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:15,977
eventually passing away.

32
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:18,198
I wanted to make a game rooted in such a premise.

33
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:32,507
In JRPGs, you see a lot of settings where the main

34
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:33,487
character is a hero and as someone special or of some

35
00:03:33,487 --> 00:03:34,908
status. But I wanted to make a game where you as a main

36
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:36,308
character may not necessarily be a hero, but you still live a

37
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:36,729
very rich life.

38
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,393
For example, in the very beginning of Lord of the Rings,

39
00:03:59,393 --> 00:04:00,994
there's the Hobbit village.

40
00:04:00,994 --> 00:04:03,516
The game is similar to that, but you don't find the ring

41
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:04,836
and instead live a very peaceful, long life.

42
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:05,837
I also wanted to make a gameplay system

43
00:04:05,837 --> 00:04:07,878
that is different from RPGs that has come before it.

44
00:04:24,952 --> 00:04:30,856
We did our best to avoid having the villagers repeat the same message over and over.

45
00:04:30,856 --> 00:04:34,118
And instead of just being simple NPCs,

46
00:04:34,118 --> 00:04:36,720
they act like main characters and act under their own AI.

47
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,742
Everyone in the village, even the old men and the women,

48
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:40,883
they have their stories to tell.

49
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:55,888
and they have their own existence.

50
00:04:55,888 --> 00:04:57,049
They have their own opinions and concerns, just like any other person.

51
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:59,430
Getting into a battle doesn't mean you'll come away with gold and treasures.

52
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,792
The main character has to work very, very hard, raise crops to earn a livelihood in

53
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:02,432
order to exist.

54
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:29,186
It's more like a game that features the realistic side of things that most tend to ignore in the fantasy worlds and settings.

55
00:05:29,186 --> 00:05:31,028
When you step outside the village, there are dungeons about.

56
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:31,628
These dungeons have bosses.

57
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:32,229
And once you leave for an adventure.

58
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:54,609
The road is very, very long and pearls about.

59
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:55,890
Then I thought about the concept of water stations during a real

60
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,091
life marathon as if it was a similar long, long road.

61
00:05:57,091 --> 00:06:01,354
If you take breaks during your dungeon crawl, just like at the

62
00:06:01,354 --> 00:06:06,038
water station, I felt that people would be able to overcome

63
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:07,419
them without giving up.

64
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:26,634
But to capitalize on the game systems,

65
00:06:26,634 --> 00:06:28,635
we also put fields in the middle

66
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:30,257
so that you can raise crops to revitalize yourself,

67
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,479
give yourself more energy.

68
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,820
And this happened to work out in the end.

69
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,360
People who are good at the game

70
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,002
do not need to rest and cultivate crops.

71
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:38,083
While people who feel that the game is hard,

72
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:55,093
can do so that the game design adapts to the player's play style.

73
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:57,395
Then in the summertime, the characters change into swimwear.

74
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:24,684
When this happens, female characters sometimes put on a tattoo-like symbol on their bodies.

75
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:27,005
This is actually a form of sunblock in this particular fantasy world.

76
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:30,006
At the time, because of the way we built the characters, we couldn't make them tan, and

77
00:07:30,006 --> 00:07:30,826
we were looking for a way to get around this.

78
00:07:46,848 --> 00:07:50,090
We also figured that even in this fantasy world, there would be girls who would like to tan and those who wouldn't.

79
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:56,133
From there, we embraced the idea that in this fantasy world, people didn't use sunblock as we do in real life, but instead put on tattoos to avoid the sun.

80
00:08:14,938 --> 00:08:16,360
It was a way to take something realistic and put a fantasy spin on it.

81
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,621
Also in terms of outfits, because it's about people who work in the fields,

82
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:18,682
a lot of us would assume that they wouldn't care much about their

83
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:19,382
appearance and what they're wearing.

84
00:08:37,672 --> 00:08:39,953
But we figured that because everyone is doing the same day in and day out,

85
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,915
that they wanted to do something to stand out and maybe be noticed.

86
00:08:42,915 --> 00:08:44,475
When we went out to the real farms and asked young farmers,

87
00:08:44,475 --> 00:08:45,436
they actually felt the same way.

88
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:46,396
So we decided to implement this idea.

89
00:09:10,571 --> 00:09:12,412
As such, when you put in little bits of realism from real life, it helps resonate with the

90
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:17,595
players and makes it much easier to feel as though if it were real.

91
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:23,578
Even if you have a great idea, a unique idea, if your users don't understand it, what is

92
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:25,119
the point, right?

93
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:46,154
They're certainly not going to think it's fun unless they really understand what you're

94
00:09:46,154 --> 00:09:46,635
trying to communicate.

95
00:09:46,635 --> 00:09:47,496
It's the same thing with movies.

96
00:09:52,603 --> 00:09:56,386
After you finish watching a movie and walk out of the theater, you sometimes feel as

97
00:09:56,386 --> 00:09:59,869
though you could do what you just saw.

98
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:04,833
For instance, if you saw a superhero movie, you feel like you've become powerful.

99
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:10,978
And if you see a movie about magic, you almost feel as though you could actually cast magic,

100
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,539
but you just didn't realize it until now.

101
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:18,169
This, I think, is proof that bits of realism from real life

102
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:20,291
is connecting with the audience.

103
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,674
I want to make a game where we don't just lean on the

104
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:27,460
fantastical and instead make it feel somehow real and relatable.

105
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:45,187
With games, we have an advantage over movies in that players can also do what they want to do.

106
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:48,488
They can choose their route, the way they want to live.

107
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:52,430
For example, in Room Factory, when you become friends with the girl, you can get married and even have a baby.

108
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,831
In the latest version, you can even play as a girl.

109
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:56,212
And when they become friends with the boy, they can get married and have a baby together.

110
00:11:12,832 --> 00:11:13,692
How far can we go in living our life in this game?

111
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:14,753
If you want to simply live together with your partner, you can.

112
00:11:14,753 --> 00:11:15,995
And if you want to go defeat the demon together, you can also do that.

113
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:17,296
We wanted to make a game where people felt like they didn't want the world to end.

114
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,230
as if they didn't want to clear it because then that world would be over.

115
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,090
Next, I'm going to talk about Muramasa, the Demon Blade.

116
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,211
As you may know, this is a Japanese themed swordplay action RPG.

117
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:42,731
The motif is very Japanese.

118
00:11:42,731 --> 00:11:43,231
There are 108 swords in the game.

119
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:11,809
This number of swords is significant, as the number of 108 is known as the number of earthly

120
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:17,291
desires human beings are born with in Japan.

121
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:25,114
Also, the oni characters that appear in the game were created to be different from ogres

122
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:26,435
that originate in the West.

123
00:12:40,824 --> 00:12:44,867
I often see oni translated as ogres, but I like to treat oni

124
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:46,868
as oni and design them as such.

125
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:49,709
As for the characters that appear in Muramasa, there are

126
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:51,210
some Japanese, there are some characters that Japanese people

127
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:51,431
recognize.

128
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,029
In the Japanese version, the conversations were written in

129
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,229
such a way that it would be slightly difficult to

130
00:13:12,229 --> 00:13:13,530
understand, even for a Japanese person.

131
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,691
Let me just give you a quick example.

132
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:16,172
The girl, Momohime, is the princess, and the boy, Onisuke,

133
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:16,852
Kisuke, are the main characters.

134
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:43,699
Momohime is a princess and speaks like royalty, and Kisuke is a ninja, so he speaks with a

135
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:44,439
thrilling Edoko-style dialect.

136
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:47,681
In addition, in the case of Momohime, she'll take on other souls, which also cause her

137
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:48,482
to switch up the way she speaks.

138
00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:50,503
So even if the situation presented in front of them is the same between these characters,

139
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,990
Depending on which role they play, we change up the way they talk and the way they grow.

140
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,631
Also in the game, there are lots of edible things and items that appear along the way.

141
00:14:12,631 --> 00:14:13,952
It's said that all foods contain life energy called Seiki.

142
00:14:38,473 --> 00:14:40,694
And foods that are special even have a soul.

143
00:14:40,694 --> 00:14:41,755
By eating the food, the main characters gain its strength from

144
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,297
Seiki and uses that strength to increase the power of their

145
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:44,758
blades.

146
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:50,802
In terms of the setting, it takes place during the Genroku

147
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:53,765
era, which encompasses the Edo period.

148
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,458
It covers the latter years of the 17th century and into the

149
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:09,498
18th.

150
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:11,559
At the time, fatty tuna, or as we know it here, toro, was not

151
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,960
valued like it is now. The less fatty red meat was actually more

152
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,120
valuable.

153
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:41,036
and maguro sushi, the tuna sushi, was not very expensive at all.

154
00:15:41,036 --> 00:15:42,417
At the time, they also started farming sea bream and flounder.

155
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:43,477
So while the prices were high, they could buy them.

156
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:09,784
We wanted to show a food world that is different from what we know today.

157
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:10,624
But of course, this world did not actually exist.

158
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:11,525
This is still a Japanese-styled fantasy world.

159
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:13,826
Just like in Rune Factory, however, by injecting some realistic elements into the world,

160
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:39,824
it made it much easier to play and believe.

161
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:46,386
Also, we made it so that you can change characters at any time,

162
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:49,928
as well as change difficulties at will.

163
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:52,309
We wanted players to be able to pick their own route

164
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:54,870
and play the way they want.

165
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,131
Having player choice is what makes games

166
00:16:58,131 --> 00:16:59,771
different from other mediums.

167
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:10,786
So I'm going to talk a little bit about the emphasis on action, even though we're talking

168
00:17:10,786 --> 00:17:11,567
about RPGs.

169
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:18,611
I often make RPGs and simulation games, but I feel that there needs to be an emphasis

170
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:21,152
on action within these games.

171
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:27,676
Because they're meant to be games that you play for a very long time, you almost have

172
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:32,018
to have controls that feel even better than actual action games.

173
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:37,581
For example, let's say if it takes a very, very long time

174
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:40,263
to close a window to the point you get irritated.

175
00:17:40,263 --> 00:17:42,065
And then on top of that, whenever that window closes,

176
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:42,946
it makes a weird system noise.

177
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:45,548
You would think that as you play, you'll get used to it.

178
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:21,965
But in reality, the stress actually begins to build until it gets to a point where players may actually stop playing, or they may just end up hating the game altogether, even though they actually like the game, the inside of the game.

179
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:23,065
Not everyone who plays games is a hardcore fan.

180
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:37,582
This may not apply to a lot of you here today, but it is true.

181
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:40,024
And so, because of this, you really have to emphasize good action.

182
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:41,265
But I think for me, perhaps this comes from my roots.

183
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:07,695
I've worked on many action games and fighting games in the past.

184
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:09,235
And to just give you an example, when you have a character jump, you don't just repeat

185
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:09,735
the same up and down movements.

186
00:19:09,735 --> 00:19:10,616
You need to have acceleration to feel it.

187
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:10,896
Or when you punch.

188
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:34,047
You get the punch to feel good by having the punch come out

189
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:37,550
very, very quickly, followed by a slower reset.

190
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,771
I learned a lot of this through trial and error.

191
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:40,892
I think this kind of tuning in relation to timing

192
00:19:40,892 --> 00:19:41,993
is something that I still value.

193
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:06,655
So now I'm going to talk a little bit about the volume

194
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:11,438
and flow of information using a specific example

195
00:20:11,438 --> 00:20:12,138
that you see here.

196
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:23,670
When making a game, the creator must control the amount of

197
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,672
information along with the course of development or

198
00:20:27,672 --> 00:20:31,434
progress of the game. In my early days when I was designing

199
00:20:31,434 --> 00:20:33,035
a stage in an arcade game, I thought of this gimmick. The

200
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:35,477
ground splits halfway through, as you can see, and beneath it

201
00:20:35,477 --> 00:20:36,037
lays a pool of magma.

202
00:20:49,636 --> 00:20:50,897
If you proceed straight, the path is a dead end,

203
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:51,457
and there's a switch.

204
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:52,858
By explaining the elements in this fashion

205
00:20:52,858 --> 00:20:53,519
and not overthinking it, one may wonder,

206
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,500
something's going to happen if I put on the switch, right?

207
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,220
But when we actually did a focus group,

208
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,161
the reaction confirmed that it was wishful thinking.

209
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:20,176
I thought for sure the players would turn on the switch, but I was wrong.

210
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:22,177
Instead they plunged right into the magma.

211
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:23,758
That's an instant game over, and many felt it was pretty unreasonable.

212
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:26,720
So instead of instantly dying, we adjusted it so you would gradually lose health.

213
00:21:44,986 --> 00:21:46,447
but that actually didn't do much either.

214
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:47,388
In fact, they would run into the magma even more

215
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:49,569
and would die one after another.

216
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:50,710
In this case, in addition to not being able

217
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,310
to understand what to do,

218
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,032
there was simply just too much going on.

219
00:21:53,032 --> 00:21:53,912
We were asking for more decisions to be made

220
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:54,233
than one can handle.

221
00:22:12,086 --> 00:22:18,589
So there was a dead end, there was a switch, the enemies were approaching, and then you

222
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:18,809
had magma.

223
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:20,450
These conditions made it very difficult to figure out what your next move was going to

224
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:20,490
be.

225
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,811
By adjusting the condition of magma from instant death to loss of health, it's possible to

226
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:24,812
say that the players briefly forgot about what to do with the switch and ran right into

227
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:25,192
the magma instead.

228
00:22:42,255 --> 00:22:45,698
In the end, we didn't want to scratch the idea, so we added the word

229
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:49,701
pool to the switch and assigned that command to the controller stick

230
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:54,265
as if you were actually pulling. There may have been other ways to solve this,

231
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:57,868
but when the players finally understood it, I learned two things.

232
00:22:57,868 --> 00:23:02,191
How challenging it is to communicate your intentions to the player,

233
00:23:02,191 --> 00:23:05,734
and the relief and joy when you succeed at doing just that.

234
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:15,180
In RPGs, there are various missions and side quests.

235
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,201
In a way, this is a result of needing

236
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:17,262
to control the amount of information

237
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,243
presented to the player.

238
00:23:18,243 --> 00:23:19,604
When players leave a game, they often

239
00:23:19,604 --> 00:23:20,645
forget where they left off, unlike a movie,

240
00:23:20,645 --> 00:23:21,325
as we just mentioned earlier.

241
00:23:21,325 --> 00:23:22,146
And when there's too much information,

242
00:23:22,146 --> 00:23:22,786
they can't figure out what to do.

243
00:23:40,383 --> 00:23:42,244
Maybe a week will go by and you may start to forget about the story.

244
00:23:42,244 --> 00:23:44,104
Because of these situations, the developer must streamline how the information is not

245
00:23:44,104 --> 00:23:46,345
forgotten but remembered, and create an invisible-like staircase for the player, basically to guide

246
00:23:46,345 --> 00:23:46,425
them.

247
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:13,589
In doing so, there's no need to prepare every single step or hold their hands for them.

248
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:15,451
The player should be able to figure out the more important things.

249
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:16,772
So I just touched on side quests, but I'm going to take it one step further.

250
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:46,135
For example, there's a remedy medicine in the location of the forest, so you head out.

251
00:24:46,135 --> 00:24:51,780
And then along the way, there's a village where you collect information and ultimately

252
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,361
you return to the castle.

253
00:25:10,263 --> 00:25:13,144
If that quest is made exactly how I explained it, it'll become very repetitive and eventually

254
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:13,705
boring.

255
00:25:13,705 --> 00:25:13,805
No fun.

256
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:15,886
So what if we change it to, enter the neighboring village, then someone leaves in need of the

257
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:16,006
cure.

258
00:25:16,006 --> 00:25:17,327
When you finally arrive at that forest...

259
00:25:33,088 --> 00:25:36,890
The person has fallen, and if you return to the castle,

260
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,031
you find out that the person was trying to get the cure

261
00:25:40,031 --> 00:25:41,271
for his girlfriend.

262
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:43,412
The girlfriend is in the village.

263
00:25:43,412 --> 00:25:44,532
The flowchart, I know, might be a bit confusing,

264
00:25:44,532 --> 00:25:47,974
but in this scenario, we're able to link the village

265
00:25:47,974 --> 00:25:49,814
and the castle, as well as the relationship

266
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:50,714
between the two people.

267
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:54,616
This way, you feel less obligated to do the quests

268
00:25:54,616 --> 00:25:55,576
just for the sake of doing them.

269
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:07,682
As such, it becomes less tiring and boring when you shape your idea in a circular form.

270
00:26:07,682 --> 00:26:10,525
Additionally, rather than realizing you've been fooled or tricked, this approach gives

271
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:12,006
a deeper sense of gameplay.

272
00:26:12,006 --> 00:26:16,030
In RPGs, the cycle or circular movement applied to the story, as well as the system, helps

273
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,292
to keep things at an exciting pace.

274
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:32,348
And when that happens, we are sometimes pleasantly surprised by the unexpected moves and plays

275
00:26:32,348 --> 00:26:32,829
performed by the user.

276
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:34,910
So a little bit about making RPGs and where are they headed.

277
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,531
When you really, really think about it, people don't really have to play games.

278
00:26:51,858 --> 00:26:53,519
There's really no inconvenience to us if they're not around.

279
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,040
But personally, I think they are a necessity, and I hope you feel the same way since we're all here today.

280
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,162
The thought, though, is that it's no fun if they come out as expected.

281
00:26:58,162 --> 00:27:01,044
In a way, by implementing ideas that are different or unexpected and unpredictable,

282
00:27:01,044 --> 00:27:02,524
it'll help make the game something beyond the player's expectations.

283
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:25,688
It's difficult to know if you'll be able to deliver at that level, but all you can

284
00:27:25,688 --> 00:27:26,548
do is trust yourself.

285
00:27:26,548 --> 00:27:27,868
So it was the same with Room Factory.

286
00:27:51,622 --> 00:27:54,082
There were opinions about why we're making the game when we already have Harvest Moon,

287
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:55,042
or why are we even adding combat to Harvest Moon.

288
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:56,943
We don't think anyone is wanting something like that, people said.

289
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:59,944
And we were even more surprised when we publicly announced the game.

290
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,644
The fans didn't want a Harvest Moon where you wield a sword.

291
00:28:20,987 --> 00:28:26,389
It wasn't easy, and it was a very unusual situation to have very, very few allies who

292
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:26,869
understood my plan.

293
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:27,669
I was in a very awkward position.

294
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:32,751
In the case of Muramasa, the development of the game itself went smoothly, but because

295
00:28:32,751 --> 00:28:33,331
of the Japanese motif.

296
00:28:50,653 --> 00:28:51,894
and I'm talking about very traditional elements,

297
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:53,054
many thought this wasn't going to be an easy sell overseas,

298
00:28:53,054 --> 00:28:54,375
and also even in Japan.

299
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:54,515
However,

300
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:56,416
because we went all out with a Japanese fantasy theme and setting,

301
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:59,138
rather than trying to accommodate a Western style or elements,

302
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:00,178
players overseas said the game was fantastic.

303
00:29:20,674 --> 00:29:24,838
So if you believe in it, you can create a path for it,

304
00:29:24,838 --> 00:29:26,680
and you'll have a sense of accomplishment.

305
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,601
The most important thing is if you don't believe in it,

306
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:31,444
it won't be communicated to the player.

307
00:29:31,444 --> 00:29:33,986
But if and when they do get it, it's the best feeling.

308
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:51,355
Especially when the players get something that was rejected by

309
00:29:51,355 --> 00:29:55,598
others, they get it. And then those who read rejected my idea,

310
00:29:55,598 --> 00:29:57,119
they didn't initially get it. That moment, that sense of

311
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,320
feeling, it can get very, very addictive. And that's probably

312
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,142
why I can't stop making games, even though it requires a lot of

313
00:30:03,142 --> 00:30:03,823
stamina and strength.

314
00:30:17,014 --> 00:30:18,635
To make an RPG isn't really that difficult is what I think, but however, if you're serious

315
00:30:18,635 --> 00:30:20,077
about making one, you need to find some friends who'll come along the ride with you, as well

316
00:30:20,077 --> 00:30:20,737
as an idea and obviously some knowledge.

317
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:21,478
It can be over the top or something realistic.

318
00:30:51,193 --> 00:31:03,659
That was the same situation for me, for Room Factory and Muramasa.

319
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:08,062
I had a group of friends who believed in the idea that I presented to them.

320
00:31:15,981 --> 00:31:24,666
And if there's something you feel is missing, or slightly off, or inconvenient in RPGs that

321
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:27,608
are available in the market today, you might be able to come up with something entirely

322
00:31:27,608 --> 00:31:31,029
different or new just by tweaking that one element.

323
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:35,032
Even for myself, if it weren't for an idea I had one day to make an RPG.

324
00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:51,420
I probably wouldn't have made this many RPGs and I wouldn't be standing here today in front

325
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:51,600
of you.

326
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,761
If there's one person after this session who is inspired to make an RPG, that's at least

327
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:56,082
a new beginning for them, right?

328
00:31:56,082 --> 00:32:02,324
For me, I want to continue to provide excitement and entertainment.

329
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:15,941
And I also want to be happy at the same time with what I've

330
00:32:15,941 --> 00:32:17,703
accomplished. I have a list of ideas I want to challenge and

331
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:18,605
world the settings I want to create.

332
00:32:31,777 --> 00:32:39,040
Back in the days, there was a game, unrelated to Harvest Moon, where the overseas publisher

333
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:44,382
requested us to change the second playable character to a male character.

334
00:32:44,382 --> 00:32:47,904
Originally, the game had one male and one female playable character.

335
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:51,145
As part of the process of what we call culturization.

336
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:10,723
As much as we wanted to respond to their expectations, because it was a game where I wanted both

337
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:15,025
the male and female characters to have a chance, I want both characters to enjoy the game.

338
00:33:15,025 --> 00:33:18,567
I want to bring a smile to everyone, as long as we're making games.

339
00:33:32,203 --> 00:33:35,926
I want people to be happy and enjoy the games.

340
00:33:35,926 --> 00:33:40,268
That becomes my motivation.

341
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:52,056
And every time I see that and see the feedback, it keeps me long hours at work, and I want

342
00:33:52,056 --> 00:33:54,337
to continue to spend my time making games.

343
00:34:02,264 --> 00:34:07,949
What would be sad for me is if people stop playing games.

344
00:34:07,949 --> 00:34:11,573
As long as people love playing games

345
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:14,135
and they wanna explore and experience new games,

346
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,856
I will continue to make games.

347
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:29,643
In closing, I have a few stories to tell about Harvest Moon.

348
00:34:29,643 --> 00:34:34,867
As you all know, this is published by Natsume, the publisher out here in the West.

349
00:34:48,288 --> 00:34:54,931
I myself have and still continue to visit farms in various parts of Japan.

350
00:34:54,931 --> 00:34:55,752
What are they growing?

351
00:34:55,752 --> 00:34:57,373
What kind of vegetables are in season?

352
00:34:57,373 --> 00:34:59,714
I just like to check in and see what the land is like.

353
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:03,515
But one day, I hope to do the same out here.

354
00:35:03,515 --> 00:35:05,116
Whenever I have a chance to talk to the farmers,

355
00:35:18,185 --> 00:35:22,066
I'm reminded of their dedication and hard work.

356
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:33,330
But it wouldn't make sense to simply turn that into a game, just how challenging it

357
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:38,652
is and how hard it is and the dedication these farmers have.

358
00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:42,874
So while including some of the hardships and lessons in the game.

359
00:35:44,537 --> 00:35:45,998
I make sure there's a great deal of satisfaction while playing.

360
00:35:45,998 --> 00:35:48,000
When I included a cultivation method in the game where you go two different crops in the

361
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,961
same year, there's an actual farmer who contacted me.

362
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:49,161
He asked me.

363
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:16,522
if I really knew how that method worked.

364
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:18,203
What does that mean?

365
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:23,164
Well, he asked me if I was aware that the soil loses its

366
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:28,266
nutrients during harvesting, and that land actually starts to

367
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:28,686
deteriorate.

368
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,006
Well,

369
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:37,394
You know, of course, I did know about the fact that, but if I were to reimagine the

370
00:36:37,394 --> 00:36:39,215
entire process step by step, the true process in real life, it would have been a little

371
00:36:39,215 --> 00:36:40,296
too difficult.

372
00:36:40,296 --> 00:36:44,480
So what I did was I applied the part I thought was interesting and fun and fitting for the

373
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:44,640
game.

374
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,781
As with the RPG topic earlier.

375
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:03,652
I left an element of realism in the game.

376
00:37:03,652 --> 00:37:05,213
It's been about 17 years since the first Harvest Moon game was released, and we still continue

377
00:37:05,213 --> 00:37:05,993
to receive letters and feedback from our users.

378
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:27,033
A parent will write and say, my child was plowing a field in the

379
00:37:27,033 --> 00:37:29,355
game and it brought a smile to my face. I started laughing. I've

380
00:37:29,355 --> 00:37:30,817
never seen my son do that in real life. These letters

381
00:37:30,817 --> 00:37:32,998
instantly make me want to make a bunch of these games. And I feel

382
00:37:32,998 --> 00:37:35,641
very lucky as a creator. And that is why I make games.

383
00:37:50,856 --> 00:37:56,660
Another cute story I heard several years ago is when a child raised in the city saw an

384
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,422
insect die.

385
00:37:58,422 --> 00:38:02,465
He told his mom that the battery died, not the insect.

386
00:38:02,465 --> 00:38:08,029
And when I heard that, I thought to myself, even if it's a game, maybe he can learn something

387
00:38:08,029 --> 00:38:12,392
about insects or other subjects that exist in real life.

388
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:17,096
So he doesn't grow up thinking that insects can be recharged like a battery.

389
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:24,309
We've also had users share their thoughts on how sad it is that animals get sick in

390
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:25,690
the game.

391
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:30,274
But instead of condemning the players that this happened because you didn't care for

392
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:37,161
the animals, I would take a slightly different approach by communicating the obvious in a

393
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:38,422
much more natural way.

394
00:38:40,877 --> 00:38:46,518
I realize our cultures are different in Japan and in the West in general and with specific

395
00:38:46,518 --> 00:38:49,619
subjects such as farming, but one day I hope to make an RPG and a Harvest Moon game that

396
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,100
goes with the different cultures.

397
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:51,900
Thank you very much.

398
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,520
Thank you.

399
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,001
So we have about 10 minutes left, and we'd like to open it up for Q&A.

400
00:39:13,223 --> 00:39:22,608
So if anyone has any questions, there are two mics, one on the left, one on the right,

401
00:39:22,608 --> 00:39:30,852
and if you could just walk up to the mic and ask the question, we'll go ahead and ask Mr.

402
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:34,694
Hashimoto and get the answer from him and translate that as well.

403
00:39:40,372 --> 00:39:57,440
Hello, I was wondering, JRPGs sometimes have a bit of a reputation here in America for

404
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,543
occasionally talking a little bit too much, like going on a little bit more.

405
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:10,830
then isn't necessary, but then conversely some people accuse the American audience of

406
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:16,093
being interested in nothing but shooting the next guy as quickly as possible.

407
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:29,401
Do you have any opinions on how much dialogue and story to gameplay is the correct ratio?

408
00:40:29,401 --> 00:40:30,562
How do you think that should be approached?

409
00:40:34,177 --> 00:40:34,447
Yeah.

410
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:20,439
Yes, I just answered one of the questions...

411
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:22,420
sorry if there is a mistake.

412
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:28,404
So, a lot of the JRPG scenarios are long.

413
00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:29,024
So, like that.

414
00:41:29,024 --> 00:41:31,786
In other countries, it's the action.

415
00:41:31,786 --> 00:41:37,570
And so, the ratio of the story to the action is how long.

416
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:44,193
So I just want to quickly recap the question, which is, yes, in JRPGs, there's a reputation of just

417
00:41:44,193 --> 00:41:48,196
too much chatter, too much dialogue. And then, but conversely, in the West,

418
00:41:48,196 --> 00:41:54,202
you know, you go out and just shoot people. So what, where is that right balance do we

419
00:41:54,202 --> 00:41:56,884
think there is in terms of story versus non-story?

420
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:06,558
Speaking of which, we've written a scenario for Rune Factory and JRPGs,

421
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:11,080
but I think the JRPG scenario is a bit too long.

422
00:43:09,207 --> 00:43:10,588
So, admitting that, I do agree that the dialogue tends to be a little too long in JRPGs.

423
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,789
I, myself, I not only play J games, but I make sure that I know what's going on in

424
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:12,570
the West, and I do play shooters like Call of Duty.

425
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:13,771
And yes, there's a considerable amount of difference, and there's a huge gap.

426
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:41,530
but I'm always conscious about the ratio, the right balance.

427
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:42,871
And for example, with Muramasa,

428
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:45,471
we really tried hard to bake it into a compact,

429
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:47,492
whether it's a sentence, a line, or a part of the story.

430
00:43:47,492 --> 00:43:49,512
We wanted to make sure that we communicated

431
00:43:49,512 --> 00:43:51,193
what we wanted to in a certain scene or level,

432
00:43:51,193 --> 00:43:52,593
but to try to keep it compact

433
00:43:52,593 --> 00:43:54,214
so that it was a well-balanced game.

434
00:44:11,071 --> 00:44:11,451
Thank you.

435
00:44:11,451 --> 00:44:11,611
Hello.

436
00:44:11,611 --> 00:44:19,556
I thought it was curious how you were talking about when

437
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:21,857
you first started working on RuneFactory how you didn't

438
00:44:21,857 --> 00:44:23,178
have a lot of allies in the company.

439
00:44:24,057 --> 00:44:26,620
And then when you brought it to Harvest Moon fans,

440
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,782
they didn't seem to be too keen on the idea of adding combat

441
00:44:29,782 --> 00:44:31,704
to the Harvest Moon formula.

442
00:44:31,704 --> 00:44:34,326
So I'm wondering who it was who ended up

443
00:44:34,326 --> 00:44:35,487
purchasing Rune Factory.

444
00:44:35,487 --> 00:44:38,610
Was it Harvest Moon fans who were turned on

445
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,191
to the idea of adding combat?

446
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:43,935
Or was it a new audience that weren't Harvest Moon fans

447
00:44:43,935 --> 00:44:45,796
that wanted that experience?

448
00:45:21,925 --> 00:45:34,355
Ok, so my question is there was an old� ルーンファクトリー, but we Domino's are those with harvest moon DNA.

449
00:45:34,355 --> 00:45:40,140
Did the user buy it? Or did the new user buy it?

450
00:45:47,052 --> 00:45:50,857
So I'm just going to quickly recap. So you are curious to which, uh,

451
00:45:50,857 --> 00:45:54,162
what type of users did we, uh, gain a new audience,

452
00:45:54,162 --> 00:45:57,626
new user base, uh, for room factory, or, uh,

453
00:45:57,626 --> 00:46:00,571
did a significant portion of Harvest Moon fans end up purchasing and trying

454
00:46:00,571 --> 00:46:01,812
room factory? That is the question, correct?

455
00:46:07,419 --> 00:46:19,517
Yes, so, before the game was released, the first person who contacted us was someone who had never done Harvest Moon before.

456
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:22,906
And when it was released,

457
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:28,211
the new users and the Harvest Moon users

458
00:46:28,211 --> 00:46:29,131
well, about half of them

459
00:46:29,131 --> 00:46:31,213
both of them bought it

460
00:46:31,213 --> 00:46:34,176
and now we have a series of them

461
00:46:34,176 --> 00:46:35,978
and when we had a series of them,

462
00:46:35,978 --> 00:46:37,159
the Harvest Moon users

463
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:41,082
after the release, they were like

464
00:46:41,082 --> 00:46:44,245
oh, I thought so, but this combination is surprisingly good

465
00:46:44,245 --> 00:46:45,066
and they were happy with it.

466
00:46:46,492 --> 00:46:52,576
So when we first announced the title, so from announcement to maybe pre-release, leading

467
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:56,820
up to the release, I would say that we had new users.

468
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:04,125
So non-Harvest Moon interested consumers and users were keeping up with the information

469
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:06,087
that we were releasing from time to time.

470
00:47:06,087 --> 00:47:07,147
And then once the game hit the shelves...

471
00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:14,551
The Harvest Moon fans, they started to obviously read about the reviews of the game, and I

472
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:18,653
think they had this sort of inkling about, okay, if this has enough elements that resonate

473
00:47:18,653 --> 00:47:19,593
with me since I'm a Harvest Moon fan.

474
00:47:25,416 --> 00:47:27,817
then I should probably give it a try. And so now that, you know, we have both

475
00:47:27,817 --> 00:47:29,898
series and we could talk about kind of the merged audience in a way, I do feel

476
00:47:29,898 --> 00:47:31,639
that the earlier Harvest Moon fans, they feel that it's a nice balance. It's

477
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:34,040
quite a nice balance of blending the elements from Harvest Moon with the new

478
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,961
elements serving for the Rune Factory.

479
00:47:51,847 --> 00:47:55,603
uh... type game so i would say that maybe it's about half-and-half right now

480
00:47:59,824 --> 00:48:09,290
Hello, a common thread I've noticed in many of your games is the relationship building factor.

481
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:16,634
Like you will find an NPC, you will fall in love with them, and eventually that will have significance on the gameplay and story.

482
00:48:16,634 --> 00:48:24,900
I'm wondering what it is about this element you enjoy and how you think it adds to the games and engages the players.

483
00:49:17,868 --> 00:49:21,992
Speaking in Japanese

484
00:49:41,637 --> 00:49:48,419
Okay, so thank you for this question. I'm flattered, and so I want to say thank you for asking me this question.

485
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:52,480
But yeah, it is a core element, a core theme, so I'd like to go ahead and answer.

486
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:52,680
Please do.

487
00:50:03,552 --> 00:50:09,378
Basically, I used to make action games, so I can only make settings that are related to the characters.

488
00:50:09,378 --> 00:50:14,144
For example, I can only make settings that I like, such as fighting games and action games.

489
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:21,452
So basically, I made stories with that desire and wanted to make the relationship deeper.

490
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:24,556
I think that's one of the things I wanted to make more and more.

491
00:50:26,238 --> 00:50:34,966
So one thing that probably is important to me as to why I'm emphasizing this sort of

492
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:39,810
relationship building is that prior to working on these games, I had a lot of experience

493
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:42,273
building action games and maybe fighting games.

494
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:45,155
And in those types of games, there's not a whole lot of this relationship building.

495
00:50:45,155 --> 00:50:48,178
And it's really more about the setting and where you're at and who your opponent is.

496
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:48,498
So I think...

497
00:50:53,343 --> 00:50:59,469
the root of my desire and my intent sort of comes from there.

498
00:50:59,469 --> 00:51:01,732
So it's a different type of approach that I'm taking.

499
00:51:05,233 --> 00:51:19,244
I received a lot of letters from people asking me what I wanted to do with my character.

500
00:51:30,762 --> 00:51:40,970
So, there's a character who speaks a language, and you want to be friends with that character, so you go to a language school.

501
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:47,996
When I hear stories like that, I think that's why I want to have an impact on people's lives.

502
00:51:49,662 --> 00:51:54,067
and so that was kind of you know how it all got started but

503
00:51:54,067 --> 00:51:59,133
Back in the days and even until now and maybe this is more of a Japanese thing

504
00:51:59,133 --> 00:52:03,918
I'm not sure but originally we when we started receiving a lot of fan letters

505
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:10,726
you know, they would look at us or the company or the people behind this game

506
00:52:10,726 --> 00:52:14,991
and think, oh, you know, this character, these characters actually live in this

507
00:52:14,991 --> 00:52:17,534
world. And if I send a letter, if I send a fan letter, that it maybe I can have a

508
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,456
conversation with them, or I can, you know, have a relationship with them. And

509
00:52:26,985 --> 00:52:33,208
Shortly after this may or may not come as a surprise to you, but there are people who are asking

510
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:39,230
You know to how do I get to speak the language speak the lingo that we are seeing in games?

511
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:39,931
in your games

512
00:52:39,931 --> 00:52:44,513
And is there a school that I can attend or is there is there any way that I can learn how to speak the language?

513
00:52:44,513 --> 00:52:45,673
Because I want to build this

514
00:52:45,673 --> 00:52:47,594
relationship with the characters that you guys created

515
00:52:50,475 --> 00:52:54,977
So that really got me thinking and that you know what some of these people really think that

516
00:52:54,977 --> 00:52:57,798
there's a character that they can relate to and

517
00:52:57,798 --> 00:53:04,000
they they want to build this very nice relationship with and I think that just continued to roll on and

518
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,220
has naturally become a very core component of

519
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:06,901
our storytelling

520
00:53:06,901 --> 00:53:07,501
Thank you, thank you

521
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:09,982
So I think we can take one last question if that's okay

522
00:53:22,889 --> 00:53:29,192
Thanks for the presentation. You mentioned that in Rune Factory you had

523
00:53:29,192 --> 00:53:35,694
introduced the farming so that less skilled or maybe less hardcore players

524
00:53:35,694 --> 00:53:39,635
would be able to keep up and enjoy the game whereas skilled players could go

525
00:53:39,635 --> 00:53:44,797
right ahead go ahead into the dungeons and progress more quickly.

526
00:53:46,443 --> 00:53:51,858
Do you feel that this was a successful solution and are you planning to do something similar

527
00:53:51,858 --> 00:53:52,560
in future titles?

528
00:54:33,282 --> 00:54:43,125
So, just to recap, it was in one of the slides earlier, but during a very long dungeon,

529
00:55:00,645 --> 00:55:02,507
uh... path

530
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:06,011
or a crawl that uh... for the less skilled players that

531
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:09,934
you know uh... like in real life in a marathon that you would have these

532
00:55:09,934 --> 00:55:13,918
breakpoints and that they can sort of regain their energy back and then

533
00:55:13,918 --> 00:55:17,862
make sure that they don't you know give up and feel that it's boring or they

534
00:55:17,862 --> 00:55:20,665
they need to go back and uh... redo something

535
00:55:21,015 --> 00:55:24,876
that that would be a motivating factor to keep them going and the skilled

536
00:55:24,876 --> 00:55:26,537
players can you know

537
00:55:26,537 --> 00:55:28,798
basically go straight out if they wanted to

538
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:33,039
and uh... if that was effective or not and that if i would be taking a similar

539
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:35,100
approach for other games in the future

540
00:55:39,865 --> 00:55:45,850
So, I'd like to answer this question.

541
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:51,875
I think the suction point in the marathon was very effective.

542
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:55,998
I think the system is the same for everything,

543
00:55:55,998 --> 00:55:58,880
but it's not the creators who push it,

544
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,342
but the users play with it in various ways.

545
00:56:02,452 --> 00:56:04,354
and you need to arrange and enjoy it,

546
00:56:04,354 --> 00:56:06,977
you don't have to do it, you can do it,

547
00:56:06,977 --> 00:56:09,919
and if you don't do it, there's a service,

548
00:56:09,919 --> 00:56:12,181
and if you do it, you can say,

549
00:56:12,181 --> 00:56:14,944
I can go without using that,

550
00:56:14,944 --> 00:56:18,487
and you can get a sense of superiority.

551
00:56:18,487 --> 00:56:20,810
I think it was a very good system

552
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,191
because you can get that kind of thing.

553
00:56:23,985 --> 00:56:28,428
So as a result, yes, I think it was very, very effective.

554
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:30,749
And as a creator, as a developer,

555
00:56:30,749 --> 00:56:34,231
we're creating content, delivering that to the users.

556
00:56:34,231 --> 00:56:38,134
And what we want to avoid is to say, hey,

557
00:56:38,134 --> 00:56:39,415
this is how you're supposed to do it.

558
00:56:39,415 --> 00:56:40,876
Basically, force upon.

559
00:56:41,256 --> 00:56:43,897
how you're supposed to get through this specific part of the game

560
00:56:43,897 --> 00:56:46,217
by doing X, Y, Z. I want to make sure that there is

561
00:56:46,217 --> 00:56:48,298
some level, some extent of player choice.

562
00:56:48,298 --> 00:56:50,899
So if you're a less skilled player and you feel like, oh, well, this is an option

563
00:56:50,899 --> 00:56:51,139
that I can take

564
00:56:51,139 --> 00:56:53,019
and you're still getting rewarded, you know, in a small way

565
00:56:53,019 --> 00:56:54,520
every step you make, then that will make that player happy.

566
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,160
If you're very confident, you know you can get through it in one try,

567
00:57:09,424 --> 00:57:15,187
and there's a reward that's appropriate, you know, scaled to that type of experience,

568
00:57:15,187 --> 00:57:18,850
then I think that player will continue to maybe take that approach in the next level,

569
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:19,851
in the next dungeon.

570
00:57:19,851 --> 00:57:24,994
So I just want to make sure that there is an option and that that will be something

571
00:57:24,994 --> 00:57:30,378
that will entice the players of varied levels to be able to play our game.

572
00:57:30,378 --> 00:57:35,301
So yes, I do think that it's an approach that I will keep in mind for future games as well.

573
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,672
So thank you very much. Thank you for attending today.
