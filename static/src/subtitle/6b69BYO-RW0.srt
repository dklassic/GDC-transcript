1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,562
Hi guys, thank you for coming today.

2
00:00:08,562 --> 00:00:09,603
My name is Weori.

3
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:13,387
I'm a game developer from Osaka, Japan.

4
00:00:15,168 --> 00:00:18,271
I would like to send my gratitude to you guys here.

5
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:23,836
I have important information for this panel.

6
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:28,399
I will touch about all of the stories of the mission today.

7
00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:31,841
So it means I will talk about big spoiler.

8
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:34,522
Yeah, please notice that.

9
00:00:35,843 --> 00:00:39,845
And one more, you might not able to a lot of laugh

10
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,187
as like my panel at Indie Softbox,

11
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:48,610
because I would like to show my serious side for you guys today.

12
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:51,711
Okay, let's start.

13
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,532
Okay, let's move. I will talk in Japanese because I have a great translator for today. She's Kyoko-san.

14
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:05,653
Please listen to the translation of my weird, bizarre talk.

15
00:01:06,493 --> 00:01:06,773
Yeah.

16
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:09,474
Ja, sumimasen. Nihongo de hajimemasu.

17
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:11,495
Alright, let's get started.

18
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:14,856
The missing no kihon johou iimasu.

19
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:17,476
So then, what is the missing?

20
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:22,358
Ichiban, mizukara no karada wo kizuzukete susumu puzzle platformer de aru.

21
00:01:22,378 --> 00:01:23,018
The puzzle platformer de aru.

22
00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:25,966
So we're going to start off with the basics.

23
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:32,192
It's a puzzle platformer where you need to damage or hurt your own body in order to proceed.

24
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:35,395
Secondly, this is our debut title for the studio, White Owls Inc.

25
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:40,279
Secondly, this is our debut title for the studio, White Owls Inc.

26
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:45,644
There are a lot of awards, including the Navigator Award.

27
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:52,696
And this title received many nominations and won some awards, including the Navigator Awards.

28
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:07,635
The categories we won are Best Original Adventure and Original Song.

29
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:10,176
Two categories, very important categories.

30
00:02:10,637 --> 00:02:16,520
Two, which is the same amount or number of categories that Red Dead Redemption 2 won in.

31
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,140
Yes.

32
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:18,281
Yes.

33
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:19,001
Yeah.

34
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:20,362
How about that?

35
00:02:20,382 --> 00:02:21,303
Thank you.

36
00:02:22,604 --> 00:02:24,605
Yeah, but God of War is in volume 16.

37
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,946
But then again, okay, God of War won in 16, so...

38
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:27,386
Yeah.

39
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:34,480
The most unique feature of the game system is that it's a system where it creates a cycle of self-mutilation and regeneration through the puzzles.

40
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,902
Where you serve your arm and throw it to knock down something that's high up.

41
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:58,608
Cut your body in half to balance a seesaw.

42
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:03,092
Or you light your body on fire and use it to navigate through the darkness.

43
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:05,934
And you would also slam yourself into a wrecking ball to break your bones and solve a gravity puzzle.

44
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,442
And here I'd like to give a quick summary of the story.

45
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:35,544
The first half of the story is about a hero who visits a island called Tuiokutou with his best friend,

46
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:40,026
and he suddenly loses his best friend on a stormy night and goes to look for him.

47
00:03:40,918 --> 00:03:44,460
So for the first half, the main character visits Memoria Island

48
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,961
with her best friend, who goes missing during a storm.

49
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:50,583
And then the main character heads deep into the island

50
00:03:50,603 --> 00:03:51,683
in order to find her.

51
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:52,984
Speaking Japanese

52
00:04:01,228 --> 00:04:05,392
A sudden strike of lightning gives the main character the power of immortality,

53
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:10,076
which allows her to survive through repeated suffering and regeneration,

54
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,638
all in order to find her friend.

55
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:15,942
And as the story approaches the second half, we're led to the clock tower,

56
00:04:15,962 --> 00:04:16,722
which shouldn't really be there.

57
00:04:27,352 --> 00:04:29,393
So, the player discovers that the main character had actually died, and this is the afterlife.

58
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:32,894
And so, the main character is on the brink of death, teetering on the thin line between life and death with her immortal body,

59
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:34,735
and the world of the island represents the world inside her mind.

60
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:01,045
And then at the ending, or after the ending, the player realizes that this painful adventure wasn't a search for the best friend,

61
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:05,749
but a story of regeneration, where the character found herself again in order to be reborn. That's the storyline.

62
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:26,147
So next, I'd like to talk a little bit about how the gameplay is fused with the game design.

63
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:28,268
So in The Missing, what I call there are two axes of suffering and rebirth.

64
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:59,471
So on the game system side, you have physical pain through self-mutilation and the power to revive infinitely. ストーリーの方では徐々に明らかになっていく心の痛みとそれを打ち破るという再生の物語

65
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:04,697
On the story side, you have mental pain that gradually becomes clear and a story about a rebirth that overcomes it.

66
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:16,530
At the start of the game, most of you here too, probably, the players will likely just get a very superficial impression of,

67
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,372
hmm, this looks like a unique puzzle game or a mysterious world with a charming girl.

68
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:39,910
However, through repeated suffering and rebirth come together as one sensation over the course of the game,

69
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,591
the player ends up sharing the pain, giving them the same experience as the main character.

70
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:09,886
In other words, the game play of self-determination and the pain of the protagonist's temporary experience are synchronized.

71
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:13,229
We aimed to make the player accept the conflict in the ending.

72
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:28,827
So in other words, the pain you put yourself through in The Missing is synchronized with the main character's mental anguish as they waver on the brink of death.

73
00:07:29,347 --> 00:07:34,569
After finishing the ending, the player is able to accept all their contradictory actions.

74
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,250
By the way, I have maybe 30 more slides.

75
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:45,016
So, you're probably wondering which one came first, the chicken or the egg?

76
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:46,077
First, I made a hypothesis.

77
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:48,257
The more the game's story is strongly connected to the gameplay experience,

78
00:07:48,277 --> 00:07:49,638
the more the player will be moved.

79
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:07,631
And by the chicken and the egg, I meant the story or the game design, obviously.

80
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:11,595
So I started by putting together a hypothesis.

81
00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:15,999
The more a game story is strongly fused with its gameplay,

82
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,821
the more it will move its players.

83
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:20,704
I was also convinced that this was something

84
00:08:20,724 --> 00:08:23,126
that could not be achieved in other media besides games.

85
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:32,339
And I knew at that time, I was so sure that this was a method of story writing that cannot

86
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,745
be achieved by any media other than games.

87
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:43,904
So, to prove that hypothesis, I decided not to write the scenario ahead of time.

88
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:49,266
And based on that hypothesis, I decided not to write the scenario ahead of time.

89
00:08:49,286 --> 00:08:53,748
Specifically, I decided to make the story based on gameplay,

90
00:08:53,828 --> 00:08:56,769
and not create a stage for the story, but a story on top of the game.

91
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:07,554
And specifically what I mean by this is that I adopted the method of making all the story beats rely on gameplay.

92
00:09:08,074 --> 00:09:13,877
So the gameplay is not created for the story, but rather placing the story beats on top of gameplay.

93
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:30,947
And then I also decided to keep the very strange and sort of bizarre hooks

94
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:32,669
separate from all the story beats.

95
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:36,754
They only exist as parts of the performance within the cut scenes.

96
00:09:46,846 --> 00:09:51,149
And I decided on locations beforehand that would ensure that the story flowed together,

97
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:53,070
even though I hadn't started writing it.

98
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,673
And I picked locations that would make sense and work that way.

99
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,684
So for example, forest, waterfall, fields, a waste plant, diner, factories.

100
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:17,066
These could be placed in any order,

101
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:21,549
and they wouldn't break the mood or the atmosphere and wouldn't affect the storyline.

102
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,032
I'll explain it in a more simple flow.

103
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:29,715
So let's put the process into simpler terms.

104
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:32,257
It would look something like this.

105
00:10:32,277 --> 00:10:36,039
First, we'll decide the basic system of the game.

106
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:43,423
So first of all, the story decision process, basic game system decisions.

107
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,043
Those are the decisions we make.

108
00:10:47,824 --> 00:10:49,485
And next we have the synopsis.

109
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:53,786
And then next it says death methods, but what kind of puzzles would we implement?

110
00:10:53,846 --> 00:10:56,287
And we talked about those and made the decisions.

111
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:11,436
Location details and the order.

112
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:14,337
And then the various level design details, what kind of puzzles.

113
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:16,217
And lastly, only after all the above, the main story writing began.

114
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:41,474
It actually ended up being a little bit more complicated.

115
00:11:41,554 --> 00:11:43,414
So this is what it really looked like.

116
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:45,516
I won't read this, so please take a picture quickly.

117
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:47,637
Yeah, so this is now your chance to take a picture,

118
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:48,837
because I won't go into detail.

119
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:50,078
OK. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

120
00:11:50,638 --> 00:11:50,678
Go.

121
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:59,238
Next, I will talk about the relationship between the game system and the main character.

122
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:01,680
In order to make the game experience the two-axis play and the two-axis play,

123
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,883
the first thing you need to do is to make a strong connection with the game system.

124
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:21,746
So in order to make the mechanics of suffering and rebirth

125
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:25,089
into a game experience, the first thing

126
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:28,011
that needs to be put together is a game system

127
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:31,313
that is strongly fused with the story and the main character.

128
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,316
So here's a question.

129
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,837
Why is the main character a girl

130
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:38,459
rather than an undead creature or a dark hero?

131
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:50,150
How did I decide on this?

132
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:57,655
It depends on what the player wants to experience.

133
00:12:58,135 --> 00:12:59,836
So how do you think I decided on this?

134
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:03,638
What sort of story is it? What sort of main character would be best?

135
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:08,121
We needed to decide on what we want the player to experience

136
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:09,722
before we decided on that.

137
00:13:09,742 --> 00:13:13,644
For example, in the case of gun shooting,

138
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,106
So here's an example if we're talking about a game with a gun combat. 基本のゲームは銃を撃って敵を殺すということにしましょう。

139
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:30,102
Okay, so let's say the basic system of our game involves shooting a gun to take down targets. Very simple.

140
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,638
I'll give you three examples of what kind of feeling you want to give the player.

141
00:13:34,718 --> 00:13:38,899
It can be a sense of excitement, mission, or accomplishment.

142
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:42,561
Or it can be a sense of determination or reality.

143
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:43,661
It all depends on that.

144
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:46,882
So then, what is the sensation you want to give the player?

145
00:13:47,322 --> 00:13:51,984
This is very crucial in determining the main thrust of the story of the protagonist.

146
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:54,225
So let me give you a few examples.

147
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:58,106
The sensation of exhilaration, a sense of duty.

148
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,969
or accomplishment, is it urgency or is it reality?

149
00:14:01,989 --> 00:14:09,675
So, seen here, there are certain kinds of stories that would be fitting for each sensation.

150
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:19,857
If you had a game where an ex-Special Forces character who became a cook or a chef

151
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:22,979
goes around shooting up zombies, it would be difficult to express something other than exhilaration.

152
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:26,321
I think the sense that the player gives is the most important part to decide the story and the character.

153
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:49,789
So this is the area highlighted in the yellow box.

154
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:56,033
This is the most important sort of aspect to look at when determining the factors.

155
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:03,299
So then let's talk about or apply that to the missing.

156
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,401
So our basic system, as I've been saying,

157
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:08,243
is one in which you solve puzzles using self-mutilation and regeneration.

158
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,953
And using that, the sensations I wanted the player to experience were pain and salvation.

159
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:24,816
Which, as you can see here, naturally led to my decisions regarding the story and main characters.

160
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:55,594
And then, you need to feed back the main character and the story.

161
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:57,835
However, you're not done there.

162
00:15:58,035 --> 00:16:01,716
Because once the story and main protagonist are decided,

163
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:05,536
you then proceed to feed that back into the game design.

164
00:16:05,576 --> 00:16:07,377
You need to feed back on how the girl is destroyed

165
00:16:07,657 --> 00:16:08,717
and how the story is created.

166
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:19,676
So for example, how would a young girl go about self-mutilation? How would she regenerate?

167
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:25,439
So moving on, in order to make it so people can sort of empathize with the story,

168
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:29,882
there are a variety of techniques I use this time around, which I will like to explain here.

169
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:53,115
The first thing is, the initial hook to the story should be as simple as possible.

170
00:16:53,135 --> 00:16:55,417
So for The Missing, it's very simple.

171
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:58,699
You fall asleep with your best friend, only to await to discover that they are gone.

172
00:16:58,719 --> 00:16:59,280
That's really it.

173
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:19,569
And if you want to present something strange or unusual,

174
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:24,011
have it acted out on screen in a very minimal manner as possible,

175
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,693
but don't stretch that out into a large act.

176
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,794
It might be difficult to do it one by one,

177
00:17:28,854 --> 00:17:30,695
but we'll do it in a way that doesn't affect the stage,

178
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:33,156
where the beautiful starry sky suddenly turns into rain and there's lightning.

179
00:17:38,728 --> 00:17:46,713
And what I mean by this is that a quick example is that in this scene,

180
00:17:46,793 --> 00:17:49,274
it was a beautiful starry sky just moments before.

181
00:17:49,855 --> 00:17:54,057
Now some light rain is falling, the wind is blowing, and lightning is crashing down.

182
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:59,520
The sequence of events can be set in a very minimalistic manner.

183
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,659
But I also made it so that once you push things along,

184
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:13,603
the story's depth is supported by three parallel axes.

185
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:16,605
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA So those three are first, present,

186
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,126
second, past, and third, a future that

187
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:19,868
begins from the past and present events overlapping.

188
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:42,558
So in the present, you proceed along set stages,

189
00:18:42,698 --> 00:18:46,579
but since the past is comprised of events that already happened,

190
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:49,860
there is no impact on how we went about creating the stages.

191
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,481
Sorry, I already covered that past.

192
00:18:58,087 --> 00:19:01,529
And since the future is only related to the last boss and ending,

193
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:05,471
the way we went about making the missing allowed us to work in some depth.

194
00:19:05,531 --> 00:19:06,292
OK, we're at halfway point now.

195
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,073
And then we made the decision to make it a platformer.

196
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:30,295
So doing so makes it so that the player doesn't need to be told where to go.

197
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:33,776
All you're doing is just go to the right. Anyone can understand that.

198
00:19:52,004 --> 00:19:56,387
What that meant is it made it possible to cut down on the amount of events and text

199
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:58,849
dedicated to instructing the player.

200
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:03,012
And I think this was the biggest sort of invention or discovery for us,

201
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:06,034
is that discussions from the past, which I mentioned previously,

202
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:07,916
can now be viewed here as a log on the smartphone.

203
00:20:21,397 --> 00:20:23,698
So what we do here is we depicted JJ's relationships with the people around

204
00:20:23,718 --> 00:20:26,539
as an indirect way of showing who she really is.

205
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,661
Okay, so we're going to speed it up a little bit here.

206
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:53,331
Okay.

207
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:54,992
Next, I was thinking that I wanted this game, The Missing,

208
00:20:55,012 --> 00:20:58,052
to be played by the young people, the younger generation players and gamers.

209
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:18,092
And so writing the story, there are a few things that I kept in mind.

210
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:24,173
First is I made the main character's problem something life-sized and very personal.

211
00:21:28,014 --> 00:21:32,895
Next point is that there is no need for any of the story to be about saving the world.

212
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:49,455
And I did a very thorough sort of surveying and discussion

213
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:52,596
and really almost like interviewing the younger

214
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:53,717
generation folks.

215
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,218
And what I learned from that is that there

216
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:01,940
was a desire for recognition and self-actualization.

217
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,421
And so I really wanted to hone in and focus on those topics.

218
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:15,139
I don't know if I can say it in English, but I'm using my university life as a second writer to express the blueness that I can't express to an old man.

219
00:22:19,716 --> 00:22:24,359
Next, I actually hired a graduate student as a secondary writer

220
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:29,502
to bring out the youthfulness that I may not have anymore

221
00:22:29,602 --> 00:22:32,843
because I am a ojisan, an old man.

222
00:22:33,824 --> 00:22:34,544
Yeah, me.

223
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:37,146
And so that was very helpful.

224
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:40,968
And also, to make it easier for people to read the text,

225
00:22:40,988 --> 00:22:43,229
I used a tool that young people usually use to read the story.

226
00:22:46,002 --> 00:22:50,224
And then I used text messages on a smartphone, a very common everyday,

227
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:51,804
we're on it all the time.

228
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:57,947
And it felt very much more like a daily thing that you're already used to doing.

229
00:22:59,388 --> 00:23:02,009
So, now we're going to talk about some of the scenario creation rules

230
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:03,970
that I applied for The Missing.

231
00:23:15,148 --> 00:23:19,690
So I showed this to the younger graduate student that I just mentioned.

232
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:24,593
I'll just say that you shouldn't look at the wiki and write.

233
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:30,096
Okay, well, one that I want to mention is that don't look it up on the wiki and then write.

234
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:33,918
Can I move forward?

235
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,200
Yes, okay.

236
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:41,133
I wanted to create a work that never pauses,

237
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:48,637
just like a movie that never has a scene cut, like Gravity Zero.

238
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:54,020
So I'm going to try to put this in a way that hopefully sounds pretty cool.

239
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,682
I wanted to create a work that never pauses,

240
00:23:56,782 --> 00:24:01,345
just like a movie that never has a scene cut, like Gravity Zero.

241
00:24:02,954 --> 00:24:05,837
It's not that you shouldn't do it because it's indie,

242
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:09,161
but it's important to know how much the game will reach the real world

243
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,042
beyond the screen,

244
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:13,526
and how much it will attract players from outside the game.

245
00:24:13,546 --> 00:24:14,507
If you don't think with enthusiasm,

246
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:16,330
you won't be able to impress people.

247
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:25,751
And I spent a lot of time thinking about how to make that possible as an indie developer.

248
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:29,412
How do I make the game world such that it bleeds out of the screen,

249
00:24:29,892 --> 00:24:31,352
extends into the real world,

250
00:24:31,732 --> 00:24:35,213
or what can be done to bring the player into the world within the screen?

251
00:24:35,653 --> 00:24:39,014
This is something that I believe always needed to be kept in mind.

252
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:45,316
Next, I will talk about the main character, JJ McFeild.

253
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:50,537
Okay, so now we're going to do a deep dive into our main character, JJ McFeild.

254
00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:54,989
I thought long and hard about how to go about making a very appealing main character.

255
00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:57,089
And I questioned myself. I really want to find a character who I've never seen before.

256
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,343
In order to make her character loveable,

257
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:21,008
I thought it was essential to have admiration and empathy.

258
00:25:21,148 --> 00:25:22,912
So I decided to create a portrait of her.

259
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,163
And to get people to love this character,

260
00:25:30,183 --> 00:25:33,606
I hypothesized that there were two essential elements,

261
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:35,868
admiration and sympathy.

262
00:25:36,449 --> 00:25:37,590
And I started from there.

263
00:25:38,191 --> 00:25:38,851
To realize these two,

264
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,873
I decided that it would be best to depict

265
00:25:40,894 --> 00:25:42,515
the person I see and feel from the inside

266
00:25:42,535 --> 00:25:43,316
that everyone has.

267
00:25:43,356 --> 00:25:44,157
And that's how I made JJ.

268
00:25:51,613 --> 00:25:53,934
So try to bring these to life.

269
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:56,554
I determined that the best choice would be to depict

270
00:25:56,654 --> 00:25:59,255
the two sides that any person possesses.

271
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,776
The you that other people see

272
00:26:02,776 --> 00:26:05,237
and the you that exists within yourself.

273
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:08,398
That and how to go about depicting it

274
00:26:08,778 --> 00:26:10,518
brought me to my next problem.

275
00:26:12,845 --> 00:26:15,806
I was sure I could accomplish my goal of making players feel a sense of admiration for JJ

276
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:19,528
through her regenerative abilities and her mission to save her best friend,

277
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:23,130
but I spent a great deal of time thinking about how to inspire sympathy for the character.

278
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:48,520
But at some point, I realized that I had to face prejudice

279
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:53,762
in order to gain people's sympathy.

280
00:26:54,182 --> 00:26:58,423
Then one day I realized that in order to inspire a sense of sympathy

281
00:26:58,823 --> 00:27:03,565
that transcends boundaries such as gender, race, language, and ideology,

282
00:27:04,305 --> 00:27:07,606
I concluded that it was necessary to come face to face

283
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,126
with the reality that is prejudiced.

284
00:27:11,074 --> 00:27:14,716
So I am of the opinion that all people in some way are simultaneously both in the majority and also in the minority.

285
00:27:14,736 --> 00:27:17,197
Since I am Japanese, I am a minority, but if I go back to Japan, I am an overwhelming majority.

286
00:27:32,954 --> 00:27:38,116
So here today, as I stand in front of you, I'm a Japanese, so I'm in the minority.

287
00:27:38,396 --> 00:27:43,118
But when I fly back to Japan, of course, that's my home country, I'm in the majority.

288
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:46,119
And with those thoughts in mind, upon reaching the ending,

289
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:49,061
I was hoping that players would have realized the same truth on their own.

290
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:49,261
Bless you.

291
00:28:00,073 --> 00:28:00,533
Bless you.

292
00:28:00,893 --> 00:28:08,296
Okay, so here's the flow of the fusion between admiration and sympathy that I aim for with

293
00:28:08,316 --> 00:28:09,477
The Missing.

294
00:28:09,517 --> 00:28:15,319
Here's the flow of the fusion between admiration and sympathy that I aim for with

295
00:28:24,517 --> 00:28:26,099
So at the very beginning of the game,

296
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,682
players start playing under the assumption

297
00:28:28,843 --> 00:28:31,105
that as a human, they're in the majority.

298
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:34,870
And then synchronization with the main characters

299
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,854
begin naturally as you start controlling the character.

300
00:28:45,186 --> 00:28:48,150
But in this game, from the beginning to the middle,

301
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:52,095
you can see that you are a minority in this world.

302
00:28:52,115 --> 00:28:53,937
You can see that in the gameplay,

303
00:28:54,017 --> 00:28:56,100
and the story is a mysterious story.

304
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,201
It's all ingrained in the game.

305
00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:03,668
However, from the beginning to the middle part,

306
00:29:03,728 --> 00:29:07,810
the game suddenly imprints the idea that in the world of this,

307
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:13,653
the missing, you're a minority, from both monsters or enemies

308
00:29:13,713 --> 00:29:15,434
appearing or from the storyline.

309
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:19,475
It does this from both gameplay and story perspectives.

310
00:29:31,238 --> 00:29:34,419
And doing so completes the first stage of empathy.

311
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:38,700
This includes the bond the player feels towards Emily,

312
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,881
who is a fellow member of the minority.

313
00:29:40,901 --> 00:29:45,602
As the story progresses, the game becomes more and more difficult.

314
00:29:45,722 --> 00:29:48,683
The protagonist actually took the blame for being a minority and died.

315
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:53,024
Knowing that this is the story, the player's pain reaches its peak.

316
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,462
And upon reaching the second half of the game,

317
00:29:58,602 --> 00:30:01,224
you learn that the protagonist ended her own life

318
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,646
due to her suffering as a minority,

319
00:30:04,246 --> 00:30:07,068
and the game's difficulty increases in kind,

320
00:30:07,128 --> 00:30:09,030
which brings the suffering of the player

321
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,531
to kind of a peak at that point.

322
00:30:12,508 --> 00:30:16,970
However, upon reaching the ending, we expected that the players would be both proud of JJ

323
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,953
and themselves for overcoming their suffering, and feel like this was a story about themselves.

324
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:43,638
And then having experiences as both the majority and the minority,

325
00:30:43,658 --> 00:30:45,620
and also having lived through that suffering,

326
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,422
I thought people might become aware of more diverse points of view and perspective.

327
00:31:09,544 --> 00:31:17,587
This time, I was able to dig into JJ's character and discover another big discovery.

328
00:31:18,407 --> 00:31:24,349
And then, digging into the character of JJ, I found a way to articulate something I had discovered.

329
00:31:24,369 --> 00:31:31,772
The status of gender and LGBTQ is not a character's individuality.

330
00:31:31,812 --> 00:31:33,933
You should not misunderstand it as individuality.

331
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:41,017
So, and this was something that I was already cognizant of, but was never able to state clearly.

332
00:31:41,618 --> 00:31:46,863
The LGBTQ status should not be misunderstood as a character trait.

333
00:31:46,883 --> 00:31:50,866
This is because, just like American or Japanese characters, LGBTQ is only a trait.

334
00:31:50,906 --> 00:31:55,671
What's important is the person's personality, and what should be expressed is the only part of the character.

335
00:32:02,492 --> 00:32:06,774
And quite often you will have works where characters' entire background will stop,

336
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:09,576
and start and stop with them being gay or lesbian.

337
00:32:09,616 --> 00:32:10,877
This is the same as saying,

338
00:32:11,217 --> 00:32:15,340
this character is a man or a woman, or American or non-American,

339
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,461
which isn't a character trait.

340
00:32:18,342 --> 00:32:21,304
If you don't draw the character's personality, life, and thoughts

341
00:32:21,704 --> 00:32:23,045
as more important than their status,

342
00:32:23,085 --> 00:32:25,426
the character won't be attractive.

343
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:34,106
And from my own personal experience, and I hope you too, you are the same way too,

344
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:38,911
if you spend time with these people, they are clearly far more defined

345
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:44,897
by their individual personalities, ideals, and the lives that they've led.

346
00:32:45,118 --> 00:32:46,859
And those are the things that you remember.

347
00:32:48,206 --> 00:32:51,028
In my previous development experience, I would react to such biases and ignorance with

348
00:33:13,097 --> 00:33:17,858
discussed and would reject them just outright without really explaining why.

349
00:33:18,338 --> 00:33:25,240
But in the process of explicitly detailing my thoughts, I learned how to explain why this is wrong.

350
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:31,841
The one wonderful thing about discovering or realizing this is how it can be applied to

351
00:33:41,804 --> 00:33:44,105
any character or how any character is shaped.

352
00:34:08,577 --> 00:34:13,239
And as just stated in this slide, it could be an antithesis for, let's say,

353
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:19,021
for an easy female character or female protagonist idea, which you can then explain

354
00:34:19,061 --> 00:34:23,563
and correct as needed, and the same goes for deciding what race to make a character.

355
00:34:24,123 --> 00:34:27,264
You know, like, okay, we're talking about a Japanese character.

356
00:34:27,604 --> 00:34:29,225
Okay, Japanese people are samurais.

357
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:34,927
Chinese people are chefs or kung fu masters or making Americans as soldiers.

358
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:36,147
I think you get the point.

359
00:34:38,116 --> 00:34:45,203
Next, I'd like to talk about the characters that surround the main character.

360
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:51,529
OK, so I think we'll be able to fit all of my content in, so I'm gonna go through the next point,

361
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:55,754
which is the importance of characters who surround the main character.

362
00:34:55,774 --> 00:34:59,798
I've summarized the elements to define the character's personality.

363
00:35:02,652 --> 00:35:08,335
Okay, so I put together some elements that are used for defining personality when deciding on characters. これまでの人生

364
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:10,276
Life up to this point. 趣味・趣向と技能

365
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,417
Likes, hobbies, and skills. 興味の対象とその熟練度

366
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:15,679
Proficiency as an object of interest. 両親や友人、近親者の環境

367
00:35:27,955 --> 00:35:31,038
parents, a friend, and family environment,

368
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:38,084
the objective assessment from a family or family member,

369
00:35:38,104 --> 00:35:41,627
the surface level acquaintances and their objective assessment.

370
00:35:48,392 --> 00:35:49,733
And your own self-image.

371
00:35:49,753 --> 00:35:54,476
So these seven points I listed here, I actually, during my presentation in 2011 here at GDC,

372
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,418
I mentioned these in building a character resume.

373
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:21,349
This is necessary to determine the personality of the story,

374
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:24,031
not simulation or learning.

375
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:27,933
So, let's see what it's like in JJ's case.

376
00:36:28,093 --> 00:36:31,935
So, you see the additional red phrases here.

377
00:36:32,296 --> 00:36:36,878
Now, these elements were needed to give personality fitted to the story,

378
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:38,259
so they're not real life.

379
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:42,338
simulation based on science or theories or anything like that,

380
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:44,560
but more recipes for entertainment.

381
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,082
And so for The Missing, I really sort of emphasize on points 5 and 6.

382
00:36:47,162 --> 00:36:47,242
5 and 6.

383
00:36:47,282 --> 00:36:48,943
The people around JJ are the ones who are expressing 5 and 6.

384
00:37:06,022 --> 00:37:09,964
So those in 5 and 6 are people who surround or around JJ.

385
00:37:09,984 --> 00:37:12,906
Actually, the characters other than Emily don't appear in the 3D model.

386
00:37:12,926 --> 00:37:16,527
But they play a very important role in understanding JJ's personality.

387
00:37:19,354 --> 00:37:25,258
So Emily is actually the only one side character in this game who appears with a 3D model,

388
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:29,441
but she is crucial to understanding JJ's personality.

389
00:37:38,878 --> 00:37:45,122
So if you're wondering why that is, it's because side characters in this game don't fulfill defined roles.

390
00:37:45,822 --> 00:37:53,127
In other words, that character will always act in a way that seems natural and realistic for them, and the same goes for their speech.

391
00:38:03,555 --> 00:38:08,738
Essentially, it's precisely because they do not exist for the purpose of pushing the story forward.

392
00:38:25,091 --> 00:38:28,073
And here we have one of the most important points,

393
00:38:28,554 --> 00:38:31,856
is the character, the fourth wall breaker character.

394
00:38:32,297 --> 00:38:35,159
Breaking the fourth wall is something supernatural,

395
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:38,722
just as the metaphor suggests, and it's very important. 文字通り壁越えですよね。 壁越えする登場人物は、

396
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:41,404
自由に壁のこちら側と向こう側を行き来できる必要がある。 And characters who break the fourth wall

397
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,826
need to always be able to freely travel between both sides.

398
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:59,029
This time, FK, the stuffed animal, is playing the role.

399
00:38:59,649 --> 00:39:02,271
He is... Is it okay to say he?

400
00:39:02,311 --> 00:39:07,434
He has given depth to the world by crossing the boundaries of the water island and the real world.

401
00:39:07,895 --> 00:39:11,417
So in this game, the wall breaker character is FK.

402
00:39:12,438 --> 00:39:14,499
Is it a he? I think it's okay. Is this he?

403
00:39:15,499 --> 00:39:19,702
A stuffed animal who can travel between the real world and Memorial Island.

404
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:23,397
And characters such as these, such as FK, are extremely important.

405
00:39:23,457 --> 00:39:27,961
I believe how forcefully and sort of keenly a wall breaker like this could be used as

406
00:39:27,981 --> 00:39:31,985
tremendous impact on the quality of the final story and work.

407
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:51,876
And to close things out, I would like to talk about something that was added at the very, very end of development.

408
00:40:11,198 --> 00:40:18,362
So this message that you see here, this game was made with the belief that nobody is wrong for being what they are.

409
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:23,005
This message originally was not displayed at the beginning.

410
00:40:23,025 --> 00:40:33,011
However, after speaking with my advisor for this game, I decided that it was necessary.

411
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:38,734
However, after speaking with my advisor for this game, I decided that it was necessary.

412
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,511
to put this at the beginning of the game.

413
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:07,399
So despite holding this belief from the beginning,

414
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:10,540
it never occurred to me that it should be displayed.

415
00:41:11,321 --> 00:41:13,402
We had several meetings where we had discussed

416
00:41:13,462 --> 00:41:16,243
whether or not to include a message along the lines of,

417
00:41:16,784 --> 00:41:19,545
this work was created by people of various races,

418
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:20,886
faiths, and genders.

419
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:23,907
But looking back at it now, all I can think about

420
00:41:24,127 --> 00:41:26,249
is how distasteful it would have been,

421
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:27,949
and almost sounds like an excuse.

422
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:31,930
It was like an excuse.

423
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,871
But the advisor told me what I wanted to say.

424
00:41:35,051 --> 00:41:38,792
So I decided to just say it.

425
00:41:39,192 --> 00:41:42,133
And so, yeah, sounding like an excuse, the advisor...

426
00:41:42,953 --> 00:41:45,113
And I spoke to other friends who happened to be my...

427
00:41:45,673 --> 00:41:48,194
The friend who happened to be my advisor, she said,

428
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:51,495
well, isn't this what you really want to say, Swery?

429
00:41:53,262 --> 00:41:56,287
At the end of development, we were about to finish bug checking,

430
00:41:56,327 --> 00:41:57,589
but the programmer was so angry that he said,

431
00:41:57,669 --> 00:42:00,112
even if the producer is angry, just put it on.

432
00:42:00,152 --> 00:42:00,593
So we did our best.

433
00:42:05,979 --> 00:42:09,601
And this was really basically at the end of development.

434
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:13,024
The work had finished, we were doing our bug checking.

435
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:16,346
The programmer was not happy to get this message.

436
00:42:16,406 --> 00:42:18,948
The producer was not happy to get this message either.

437
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:23,832
But we were able to somehow get it into the beginning of the game.

438
00:42:25,033 --> 00:42:26,014
What I want to say is...

439
00:42:26,034 --> 00:42:30,597
Do what you have to do, don't get caught up in development.

440
00:42:33,419 --> 00:42:36,823
And after all that, what I'm really trying to say here is,

441
00:42:37,423 --> 00:42:40,406
don't become a prisoner of your own development schedule.

442
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,988
Do what you need to do.

443
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,732
If you make this decision,

444
00:42:45,852 --> 00:42:47,173
the project may end on schedule,

445
00:42:47,193 --> 00:42:48,775
but you may lose the time and passion you put into it.

446
00:42:48,855 --> 00:42:49,395
Please remember that.

447
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,467
if you make the wrong call on this front,

448
00:43:00,068 --> 00:43:02,009
your game may release on schedule,

449
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,431
which seems like a good thing,

450
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:05,993
but it might not become something that reflects

451
00:43:06,553 --> 00:43:09,516
all the time and effort you put in creating it.

452
00:43:09,696 --> 00:43:13,078
So this is advice and guidance for you all

453
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:15,180
from my own experience.

454
00:43:18,102 --> 00:43:18,183
De.

455
00:43:18,203 --> 00:43:18,303
Eh.

456
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:19,183
Eh.

457
00:43:20,584 --> 00:43:20,785
Eh.

458
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:23,787
Eh.

459
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:23,947
Eh.

460
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:24,007
Eh.

461
00:43:24,027 --> 00:43:24,828
Arigato.

462
00:43:24,848 --> 00:43:25,328
Arigato gozaimasu.

463
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:30,849
The Missing is currently on sale.

464
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,413
It's 33% off on Switch, Xbox, PS4, and Steam.

465
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:52,085
It's 33% off on Switch, Xbox, PS4, and Steam.

466
00:43:52,745 --> 00:43:55,327
But I don't know why, but the PlayStation Store for the US, for the North American users,

467
00:43:55,868 --> 00:43:58,210
somehow it's not on sale. Don't blame me, it's not my fault, but sorry.

468
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,061
Please include the bit about the sale in the article.

469
00:44:12,682 --> 00:44:18,064
This is part of my talk today, so anyone who's reporting and writing an article about today's talk,

470
00:44:18,145 --> 00:44:20,146
please include the bit about the sale.

471
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:23,067
In bold, font, highlight, please.

472
00:44:23,087 --> 00:44:24,128
Yeah, that's all. Thank you.

473
00:44:41,862 --> 00:44:47,326
We have time for Q&A, but I had a pleasant surprise delivery of an audio message from a good friend of mine.

474
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:48,467
Would you like to hear that?

475
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:14,113
Does it work?

476
00:45:14,414 --> 00:45:15,354
Oh, does it?

477
00:45:15,454 --> 00:45:15,915
Oh, does it?

478
00:45:15,995 --> 00:45:16,996
Oh, does it?

479
00:45:17,717 --> 00:45:17,917
What?

480
00:45:18,037 --> 00:45:18,437
Not tonight.

481
00:45:19,038 --> 00:45:19,398
Not tonight.

482
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,120
Audio is on?

483
00:45:22,821 --> 00:45:23,081
It is?

484
00:45:27,746 --> 00:45:28,126
One more time.

485
00:45:30,108 --> 00:45:32,630
Hey, Zack, did you enjoy Swery's talk?

486
00:45:33,851 --> 00:45:34,592
No, don't tell me.

487
00:45:34,952 --> 00:45:35,893
I don't need your opinion.

488
00:45:37,254 --> 00:45:39,716
By the way, congratulations on the success of The Missing.

489
00:45:40,257 --> 00:45:40,597
It's great.

490
00:45:41,803 --> 00:45:42,464
That's all.

491
00:45:42,884 --> 00:45:45,904
Sorry, I got this message, so I played it.

492
00:46:10,724 --> 00:46:11,244
Hello, Sueri.

493
00:46:11,744 --> 00:46:11,945
Hi.

494
00:46:12,825 --> 00:46:14,565
I can't see you.

495
00:46:14,966 --> 00:46:15,406
It's okay.

496
00:46:16,646 --> 00:46:23,889
So if Japanese characters are samurais, Americans are soldiers, what are the French?

497
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:24,729
Chef.

498
00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:24,849
Chef.

499
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:25,029
Chef.

500
00:46:25,129 --> 00:46:27,450
Any other countries?

501
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:27,810
Difficult.

502
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:28,510
I don't know.

503
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:29,151
I don't know.

504
00:46:29,191 --> 00:46:29,691
I don't know.

505
00:46:29,711 --> 00:46:30,231
I don't know.

506
00:46:30,431 --> 00:46:30,831
I don't know.

507
00:46:31,011 --> 00:46:31,531
I don't know.

508
00:46:31,691 --> 00:46:32,812
I don't know.

509
00:46:32,852 --> 00:46:33,452
I don't know.

510
00:46:33,472 --> 00:46:34,612
I don't know.

511
00:46:34,732 --> 00:46:35,453
I don't know.

512
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:38,200
You.

513
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:38,761
Hi.

514
00:46:39,684 --> 00:46:40,385
Thank you for the talk.

515
00:46:40,526 --> 00:46:41,669
I have not played the game.

516
00:46:41,709 --> 00:46:42,872
I'm excited to get it on sale.

517
00:46:43,032 --> 00:46:44,616
Spoiler alert!

518
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:45,037
Yeah, I know.

519
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:45,618
You should have guessed.

520
00:46:45,638 --> 00:46:45,839
It's okay.

521
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:50,592
In the beginning, you talk about the kind of starting with the basic system of self-mutilation

522
00:46:50,612 --> 00:46:54,473
and regeneration as a way to inform the sensations you hope the player to feel and then find

523
00:46:54,513 --> 00:46:54,913
the character.

524
00:46:54,933 --> 00:46:59,514
I'm curious if you ever tried reversing that and starting with the sensation you wanted

525
00:47:00,214 --> 00:47:02,535
the player to feel as a way to inform the puzzle design.

526
00:47:02,715 --> 00:47:07,677
So for example, a puzzle that tells the story or makes the player feel separation anxiety.

527
00:47:08,661 --> 00:47:11,443
In today's conversation, you talked about the flow of the game,

528
00:47:11,503 --> 00:47:15,407
where you had to feel the joy of replaying and self-destruction.

529
00:47:15,447 --> 00:47:19,071
Have you ever thought about the design in the opposite direction?

530
00:47:19,131 --> 00:47:20,031
In terms of the story?

531
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:30,651
There are quite a few cases when you just make a normal story, but in a previous game…

532
00:47:30,712 --> 00:47:34,695
Sorry, I wanted to understand wants you can feel directly from this.

533
00:47:34,715 --> 00:47:38,879
This time, I don't think we developed it that way.

534
00:47:38,919 --> 00:47:39,739
The reason is...

535
00:47:47,874 --> 00:47:50,136
I heard people say that Swelly's games are interesting.

536
00:47:50,157 --> 00:47:53,301
I heard people say that Swelly's games are interesting.

537
00:47:53,341 --> 00:47:57,026
So I wanted to make an interesting game, and that's why I started with that approach.

538
00:48:01,703 --> 00:48:06,706
So for this game, not that we didn't think about it,

539
00:48:06,746 --> 00:48:10,327
but we definitely went the way that we explained today.

540
00:48:10,747 --> 00:48:15,129
And the reason for that is because I think I know enough

541
00:48:15,209 --> 00:48:17,510
about the reputation of my own games,

542
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:21,672
how the players have responded.

543
00:48:22,052 --> 00:48:23,153
And it's two things.

544
00:48:23,293 --> 00:48:26,554
One is story is great, it's fun, it's entertaining,

545
00:48:27,015 --> 00:48:29,636
but the game sometimes a little like so-so.

546
00:48:30,236 --> 00:48:39,163
That's how I felt. So for this time, for The Missing, I knew that the game had to really shine and to really stand on its own feet.

547
00:48:39,263 --> 00:48:45,689
So I had a mission or a must do for me was to make a great game.

548
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:47,630
Cool. Thank you.

549
00:48:51,252 --> 00:48:52,372
Thank you for your great talk.

550
00:48:52,752 --> 00:48:55,233
And I have a question about making characters.

551
00:48:56,133 --> 00:49:01,295
And I agree that it is very ridiculous, superficial,

552
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:05,136
that making a character with some nouns, like Americans,

553
00:49:05,596 --> 00:49:11,118
male, female, sister, or French maid, or have cat ear,

554
00:49:11,758 --> 00:49:12,518
that is very, uh,

555
00:49:14,299 --> 00:49:17,419
Maybe it is efficient, but superficial and ridiculous.

556
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:22,420
But in the larger team, about 100 people,

557
00:49:24,701 --> 00:49:30,722
some people cannot understand very long trait like yours.

558
00:49:32,962 --> 00:49:36,523
And in my position, I must make about 100 or 120 characters.

559
00:49:39,864 --> 00:49:44,666
and must make understand all of my steps.

560
00:49:44,766 --> 00:49:50,009
So I have some difficulty with this,

561
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:53,871
so is there any good idea with Raja team?

562
00:49:54,695 --> 00:49:56,156
With larger team.

563
00:49:56,596 --> 00:49:57,356
Larger team.

564
00:50:22,242 --> 00:50:26,865
In my case, when I create a character with a 100 characters, I get a lot of feedback.

565
00:50:26,925 --> 00:50:31,108
So when I create or select characters for a big production team,

566
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,349
it's a very difficult task.

567
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:33,870
I have some advice for you.

568
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:37,752
I understand that it's difficult to create a good character for a big team.

569
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:41,134
The answer is...

570
00:50:49,987 --> 00:50:53,289
I think we should go out for a drink.

571
00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:54,330
All of us.

572
00:51:18,824 --> 00:51:19,504
Buy alcohol.

573
00:51:19,724 --> 00:51:27,431
Thank you so much.

574
00:51:27,491 --> 00:51:29,973
I just want to make sure there's no one standing there, right?

575
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:33,496
Oh, thank you for the talk.

576
00:51:33,816 --> 00:51:35,478
It was just as great as your drinking one.

577
00:51:37,279 --> 00:51:38,880
Great to have two Swery talks and one GDC.

578
00:51:40,902 --> 00:51:43,244
You're one of the only, I guess, prolific,

579
00:51:43,264 --> 00:51:46,086
one of the many prolific developers who

580
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:49,409
usually have their name attached to their game as Swery.

581
00:51:49,629 --> 00:51:50,690
Sorry, can you speak up?

582
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:52,031
There's a crowd in the back.

583
00:51:52,992 --> 00:51:59,214
like you know a Swirly65 game, and I think deservedly so. A lot of times people have commented

584
00:51:59,234 --> 00:52:05,197
about your games being very unique and having like you know a distinct style whether it's

585
00:52:05,277 --> 00:52:13,039
surrealist you know scenarios or you know dark subject matters and what have you. My question is

586
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:18,521
how would you sort of define like what actually makes up a Swirly65 game and I guess what kind of

587
00:52:19,442 --> 00:52:24,547
expectation or emotion do you want a player to feel when they purchase one of your games?

588
00:52:25,848 --> 00:52:27,870
Can I make sure that I understand the question?

589
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:29,011
My question is

590
00:52:30,032 --> 00:52:33,175
how would you personally define like what is a

591
00:52:33,415 --> 00:52:37,879
Swery 65 game and what emotion or expectation do you want players to feel when they buy your game?

592
00:52:38,849 --> 00:52:41,611
What do you think about the game?

593
00:52:41,911 --> 00:52:45,653
What do you think about the game?

594
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:48,395
What do you think about the game?

595
00:52:48,735 --> 00:52:56,540
What do you think about the game?

596
00:52:57,421 --> 00:52:58,681
It's a difficult question.

597
00:53:00,463 --> 00:53:01,643
What do I think about my game?

598
00:53:01,683 --> 00:53:03,444
Basically, the most important thing is

599
00:53:05,527 --> 00:53:06,148
Experience.

600
00:53:06,168 --> 00:53:11,536
I want to make a game that is as experiencing as going on a trip, watching a movie, or playing with friends.

601
00:53:11,957 --> 00:53:13,740
That's the Swelly game I'm thinking of.

602
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:25,923
So if I were to define what is a sweary game

603
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:28,805
with my own words, the most important thing

604
00:53:29,025 --> 00:53:34,448
is that you earn or you get to experience something.

605
00:53:35,008 --> 00:53:37,729
Very similar to when you go travel

606
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:39,150
or when you watch a film

607
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:41,111
or you're just hanging out with your friends.

608
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:43,793
Those are very important experiences.

609
00:53:44,313 --> 00:53:48,175
So similar to that, I would want you to feel that

610
00:53:48,515 --> 00:53:50,736
and go through that experience when you play my game.

611
00:53:50,957 --> 00:53:51,957
That would be a sweary game.

612
00:53:52,857 --> 00:54:01,620
The games that users will feel the swelling of are coffee, donuts, and deer.

613
00:54:03,221 --> 00:54:03,421
Deer.

614
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:06,582
So from a user perspective,

615
00:54:07,882 --> 00:54:12,383
how I think they view it is coffee, and donuts, and deer.

616
00:54:12,403 --> 00:54:14,844
That's it.

617
00:54:15,424 --> 00:54:15,724
Thank you.

618
00:54:15,745 --> 00:54:22,167
Hello.

619
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,961
First of all, thank you very much for your talk.

620
00:54:26,061 --> 00:54:27,883
Very enlightening, very educational.

621
00:54:29,544 --> 00:54:33,926
So, I think that the game's message

622
00:54:34,227 --> 00:54:39,070
that everyone has the right to be who they are

623
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:40,391
is a very beautiful message.

624
00:54:41,412 --> 00:54:44,175
But while you were planning out the game

625
00:54:44,195 --> 00:54:45,556
and throughout the development cycle,

626
00:54:46,017 --> 00:54:49,260
did you have any concerns about the reception

627
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,581
due to the themes?

628
00:54:52,443 --> 00:54:53,924
Considering that, I mean, of course,

629
00:54:54,104 --> 00:54:55,266
I mean, just to clarify,

630
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:57,488
I am a supporter of the LGBTQ community.

631
00:54:57,848 --> 00:55:00,671
However, to many on an international scale,

632
00:55:00,771 --> 00:55:02,392
it is a debated topic.

633
00:55:03,794 --> 00:55:12,165
Did you consider or worry about the reception this game would receive both within Japan and on an international scale?

634
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,458
I am a big supporter of the LGBTQ community,

635
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:24,741
and I think this is one of the themes of the game.

636
00:55:24,781 --> 00:55:29,104
I was also concerned and worried about the reactions in Japan or globally.

637
00:55:38,324 --> 00:55:41,285
I didn't have to worry about the reaction.

638
00:55:41,465 --> 00:55:44,245
Basically, I just had to push forward what I wanted to express.

639
00:55:44,265 --> 00:55:46,766
But I still had to adjust a lot with the publisher.

640
00:56:06,668 --> 00:56:08,429
what the reaction was going to be,

641
00:56:08,889 --> 00:56:13,012
because it was the ultimate sort of conclusion

642
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:17,055
of after having all these thoughts and planning things out,

643
00:56:17,155 --> 00:56:18,496
that was the kind of answer.

644
00:56:19,222 --> 00:56:22,023
that was there, so I marched on with that.

645
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:27,906
But working with a publisher and having a relationship with an external partner,

646
00:56:28,706 --> 00:56:32,708
there were certain sort of discussions and maybe adjustments

647
00:56:32,908 --> 00:56:35,350
that were brought up onto the table.

648
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:40,272
That, in fact, did happen, but I, myself, was not concerned at all.

649
00:56:41,013 --> 00:56:42,853
The publisher understood what we were saying,

650
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:49,999
The problem I'm talking about is that

651
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:51,720
after the game is released,

652
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,641
we can tell the media and the community

653
00:56:54,681 --> 00:56:55,622
that there is no problem.

654
00:56:55,642 --> 00:56:58,003
That's what I'm talking about.

655
00:56:58,644 --> 00:57:00,565
And throughout these discussions,

656
00:57:01,705 --> 00:57:03,686
we had these discussions, they were brought up,

657
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:05,627
but what happened was,

658
00:57:07,468 --> 00:57:10,790
once the game came out and we saw the reaction

659
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:13,232
or whatever article or reviews or commentary,

660
00:57:13,695 --> 00:57:15,777
within the community and the media,

661
00:57:16,257 --> 00:57:21,541
we were able to say that these were really of high concern.

662
00:57:22,462 --> 00:57:25,584
So that was the result of, they were concerned,

663
00:57:25,664 --> 00:57:27,065
but we were able to sort of prove

664
00:57:27,145 --> 00:57:32,229
that they weren't as sort of as critical

665
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:34,250
as maybe they thought it was going to be.

666
00:57:36,192 --> 00:57:37,433
Thank you, and a quick question.

667
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:39,134
What's your favorite liquor?

668
00:57:40,717 --> 00:57:41,237
And whiskey.

669
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:44,481
Do you have one for him?

670
00:57:44,922 --> 00:57:45,563
I'm sorry.

671
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:46,884
Anybody, anybody?

672
00:57:46,924 --> 00:57:47,625
Anybody, yeah.

673
00:57:48,146 --> 00:57:48,747
Accepting.

674
00:57:49,367 --> 00:57:49,728
Kidding.

675
00:57:49,788 --> 00:57:53,973
Okay, maybe we have one more.

676
00:57:54,294 --> 00:57:54,974
One and okay.

677
00:57:54,994 --> 00:57:55,495
Yeah, two more.

678
00:57:56,616 --> 00:57:57,457
Do you want to go first?

679
00:57:57,477 --> 00:57:57,837
You first?

680
00:57:58,578 --> 00:57:58,738
OK.

681
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,042
I was wondering if during the development of the game

682
00:58:03,082 --> 00:58:06,264
you had any concerns that players would take away

683
00:58:06,725 --> 00:58:09,567
or make light of self-mutilation as opposed

684
00:58:09,667 --> 00:58:12,269
to the actual message that you wanted to deliver

685
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:15,752
or you wanted them to drive by the end about self-acceptance

686
00:58:15,812 --> 00:58:16,693
and restoration.

687
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:19,175
And what length did you go to ensure that they

688
00:58:19,235 --> 00:58:20,556
derived the correct message?

689
00:58:21,408 --> 00:58:22,869
When we were developing the game,

690
00:58:22,889 --> 00:58:25,650
their message was that we should value our own existence.

691
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:27,631
It was a big message for us.

692
00:58:27,651 --> 00:58:30,832
We were thinking about whether we could convey that message to the players,

693
00:58:30,872 --> 00:58:32,333
and how we could incorporate it.

694
00:58:32,353 --> 00:58:34,714
I think it was a very difficult thing to do.

695
00:58:48,173 --> 00:58:49,294
As I said on Twitter,

696
00:58:49,314 --> 00:58:50,494
JJ's experience and story

697
00:58:50,554 --> 00:58:53,956
is not only because she has the characteristics of an LGBTQ person.

698
00:58:53,976 --> 00:58:59,779
But I think that everyone around the world has the experience of being bullied

699
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:00,920
or being a part of the bullying.

700
00:59:12,164 --> 00:59:14,666
I could tell that the story would be my own and

701
00:59:14,746 --> 00:59:17,228
if I could visualize that by using the experiment

702
00:59:17,248 --> 00:59:23,693
I felt like I had full confidence that everyone would raffle off and be right.

703
00:59:28,709 --> 00:59:33,711
Yes, so I've commented from time to time maybe over Twitter, so maybe you've seen bits and

704
00:59:33,731 --> 00:59:36,452
pieces of my sort of feelings and thoughts around that.

705
00:59:36,572 --> 00:59:41,654
But in the case of JJ, it's really based on her experience and story.

706
00:59:42,054 --> 00:59:48,856
Yes, she is a member of the LGBTQ community, so there's already that kind of setting.

707
00:59:49,357 --> 00:59:52,477
that you can sort of start believing in and engaging in.

708
00:59:52,557 --> 00:59:56,418
But in real life, I think we've all, to a certain level,

709
00:59:56,598 --> 00:59:59,139
experienced something similar, or you were bullied,

710
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:01,539
or you were actually on the side that you bullied someone.

711
01:00:02,379 --> 01:00:04,840
And so from your own personal experiences,

712
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,481
I had a very sure feeling

713
01:00:10,061 --> 01:00:12,742
that we had gone through experiences ourself

714
01:00:13,302 --> 01:00:17,182
that would be either brought up as you played the game,

715
01:00:17,382 --> 01:00:17,743
or that,

716
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:28,045
you were there at one time. So I sort of assured myself that we would all lead to the realization

717
01:00:28,185 --> 01:00:32,886
at the ending of the story that you would feel the manner that we explained in the slide. So

718
01:00:32,906 --> 01:00:38,688
I kind of had that really gut feeling assurance from the very beginning. Okay, thank you.

719
01:00:40,961 --> 01:00:55,450
Hi, firstly I want to say thank you. I've appreciated this talk. I really like the part of the character design of the embassy and the LGBTQ is not that important, but they're

720
01:00:55,851 --> 01:01:00,357
identity, not an identity but their personality. That part I really like it.

721
01:01:00,778 --> 01:01:05,464
And secondly, that is not a question, but I want to say thank you for following us

722
01:01:05,664 --> 01:01:11,393
back on Twitter. You're so kind in this industry and I hope your game will sell well.

723
01:01:11,673 --> 01:01:14,614
First of all, I really liked the presentation of creating characters.

724
01:01:14,634 --> 01:01:16,334
Not only the visual, but also the community,

725
01:01:16,374 --> 01:01:17,234
and how you accept yourself.

726
01:01:17,254 --> 01:01:18,315
It was beautifully expressed.

727
01:01:18,335 --> 01:01:20,075
Second, I don't want to ask a question.

728
01:01:20,115 --> 01:01:22,256
I'm really grateful for your comments and follow-ups on Twitter.

729
01:01:22,296 --> 01:01:22,656
Thank you.

730
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:48,561
No, thank you. I really enjoy talking about something with you guys. It's true. Thank you.

731
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:50,363
Thank you so much.
