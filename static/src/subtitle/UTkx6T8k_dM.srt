00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,961
Hi, I'm Guha Bala, president of Valance Studios.

2
00:00:09,501 --> 00:00:12,942
I'm Kartek Bala, Guha's brother, CEO of Valance Studios.

3
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:16,544
You know, previously we were founders of Vicarious Visions,

4
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:21,145
which we started when we were both in high school back in 1991 in our parents' basement.

5
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:24,027
Now, Vivi became part of Activision Blizzard in 2005.

6
00:00:24,087 --> 00:00:27,988
We led the studio for 25 years and worked on some good games.

7
00:00:28,588 --> 00:00:31,890
And then we set out on a new adventure to become entrepreneurs again.

8
00:00:32,735 --> 00:00:34,937
We founded Vellum Studios in 2016

9
00:00:35,037 --> 00:00:37,439
to build a studio focused on discovery.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,782
Our desire is to build a sustainable studio

11
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:42,583
with creative and financial independence

12
00:00:42,663 --> 00:00:44,685
where industry veteran teams

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,767
could take the sort of creative risks

14
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:49,429
and create new kinds of game experiences.

15
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,431
We're a studio of around 90 employees right now

16
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:54,353
based in Troy, New York.

17
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:59,837
And simply put, our mission is to create breakthrough games

18
00:00:59,877 --> 00:01:00,438
that are magical.

19
00:01:02,243 --> 00:01:06,527
Our first couple of games, you know, first one we launched last fall, super proud of it,

20
00:01:06,907 --> 00:01:11,471
Mario Kart Live Home Circuit, released October 2020 in partnership with Nintendo.

21
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:17,375
Now that's a mixed reality video game that brings the Mario Kart experience into the real world

22
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:25,022
by merging an AR camera-enabled RC kart and a video game world into one. It was a prototype

23
00:01:25,142 --> 00:01:31,667
that was invented at Valon and then developed into a fully realized game in partnership with Nintendo.

24
00:01:33,188 --> 00:01:36,069
and just announced recently is Knockout City,

25
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,832
a new kind of online multiplayer team-based action game

26
00:01:40,312 --> 00:01:42,193
in partnership with EA Originals.

27
00:01:43,113 --> 00:01:45,595
The core mechanic is based on the simple premise

28
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,516
of throwing and catching a ball

29
00:01:48,036 --> 00:01:51,398
and amplified into a dodge-crawling online game.

30
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:54,840
There were so many technical and design challenges

31
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,042
with this title, with latency being a key issue,

32
00:01:58,662 --> 00:02:00,683
that the team had to build a new game engine

33
00:02:01,103 --> 00:02:02,444
from the ground up to pull it off.

34
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:06,364
Just a quick plug, we've got an upcoming cross-play beta,

35
00:02:06,624 --> 00:02:07,844
April 2nd through the 4th.

36
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:10,166
We'd love for you to join and check it out.

37
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:10,966
We think you'll like it.

38
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:13,207
Now, the game will be coming out in May

39
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:16,349
and in partnership with EA Originals.

40
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,590
Now, the games couldn't be more different,

41
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:24,153
but their path to discovery and creation have a lot in common.

42
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:30,397
You know, when we talk about the culture of discovery at Velen,

43
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:32,918
for us, it's essential.

44
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:36,917
to think about convergent and divergent thinking.

45
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,898
They're starkly different approaches to creativity.

46
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:43,239
It's not that one is better than the other,

47
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:44,940
but they serve very different goals.

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,501
Now we hear everyone talking about innovation,

49
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:48,541
but what does that really mean?

50
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:51,282
Is it making something that exists better

51
00:02:51,302 --> 00:02:53,683
or doing something totally new?

52
00:02:53,703 --> 00:02:57,744
A lot of great developers focus on being the best

53
00:02:57,804 --> 00:02:58,325
in their craft.

54
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,902
Now, this often overlaps with the goal of being best at what exists.

55
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:09,366
There are existing game genres. There are established game behaviors for consumers.

56
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:13,569
It's easy to understand when described, or you pitch, or you show a trailer.

57
00:03:14,649 --> 00:03:16,331
And craftsmanship is key.

58
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:22,675
And these are examples of convergent thinking where you're best in class.

59
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,477
You know, most franchise extensions are based on this.

60
00:03:26,682 --> 00:03:30,284
easier to plan for, communicate, fund, and publish.

61
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:36,709
Then there are developers who focus on something new.

62
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:40,572
At first, every pitch starts with, hey, this is really new.

63
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:43,194
But we found that really new ideas

64
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:44,655
have a few things in common.

65
00:03:45,896 --> 00:03:46,917
Uniqueness is key.

66
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:49,159
You feel different when you play.

67
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:51,821
It has a unique emotional response.

68
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:54,703
The moment-to-moment interaction is different,

69
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:56,364
whether it's narrative.

70
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,660
or it's a new kind of Twitch-based mechanic.

71
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,161
It feels different at its core.

72
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:02,884
It's hard to describe it with just video and text.

73
00:04:02,984 --> 00:04:03,845
Playing is believing.

74
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:06,006
You've got to get it in a player's hands.

75
00:04:07,988 --> 00:04:15,074
So it's really important overall to make an explicit choice

76
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,557
in which way you want to go, because it

77
00:04:18,577 --> 00:04:21,500
becomes the basis of your culture as a studio

78
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,881
and the business model.

79
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:27,925
When we decided to be game developers,

80
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:29,466
as creative people often do,

81
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:32,247
we often think about the new things

82
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:34,649
we're setting out to invent, to think differently.

83
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:36,970
But we quickly discovered

84
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,051
that most of the commercial opportunities

85
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,073
that are out there were built on convergent thinking

86
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:43,273
rather than divergent.

87
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:45,234
There's a lot of reasons why.

88
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:49,116
Convergence is iteration and craftsmanship.

89
00:04:49,897 --> 00:04:53,358
It's the only way to become and stay the best in class

90
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:55,591
in a very competitive marketplace.

91
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,412
Companies iterate for a variety of reasons.

92
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:00,812
First, they're committed to their value chains

93
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:02,253
and their business models.

94
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:05,833
The value chain is a set of organizational choices

95
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:08,574
that they've made, people, infrastructure,

96
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:11,114
management bias, like how you think

97
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:13,495
about business in the industry.

98
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:18,296
These things are woven together in a system of activities,

99
00:05:18,356 --> 00:05:20,036
how they're gonna deliver for their customers.

100
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:23,177
Their business models in particular.

101
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:26,054
are sort of areas of focus.

102
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:27,675
They really specialize and differentiate

103
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:28,535
in their business models.

104
00:05:28,615 --> 00:05:30,636
Some companies are committed to free to play games.

105
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:33,198
Some are very category specific,

106
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:36,779
MMOs or MOBAs as the case may be.

107
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,441
And some are premium price publishers.

108
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:42,402
And no matter what they do to do things differently,

109
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,863
they come from that place.

110
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:45,964
Each of these companies strategies

111
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:48,505
are as much a factor of their current resources

112
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:50,807
and expertise as they are about

113
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:51,967
where they'd like to be in the future.

114
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:59,237
Second big reason that companies iterate, all companies need to focus, usually around how

115
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:06,123
they're currently delivering their cash flows from their customers to their shareholders.

116
00:06:07,143 --> 00:06:13,168
And it sounds really smart to have a complex strategy. The problem is complex ones don't

117
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:19,533
usually work. Simple strategies with focused execution is what really works. And that's a

118
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:21,755
lot of the reasons why companies iterate as well.

119
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:23,725
There's also more reasons.

120
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:25,906
There's lower market acceptance risk.

121
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:30,090
When you put all the capital into building a game,

122
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,552
all the costs, the money, the effort, the time,

123
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,295
it's much easier to know, is there anyone out there

124
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:38,616
that's an audience for your title?

125
00:06:39,176 --> 00:06:41,578
It's easier to focus test and research it,

126
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:43,680
however formally or informally.

127
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,162
Iteration is much easier to do this.

128
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:48,564
It's a lot easier to forecast financials.

129
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:50,085
You can look at similar titles out there.

130
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:53,182
and say, hey, I can make this a little bit better, a little bit plus 10%.

131
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:59,466
So the bottom line is, is that it's a lot easier to invest in a bigger bet.

132
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:04,829
That's even better for customers by giving them more of what they already love.

133
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:09,771
You know, finally, and this is one thing that's always been a little uncomfortable

134
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:13,073
for people to admit, it's something that we've gone through as well.

135
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:15,274
There's a lower chance of failure.

136
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:18,516
At least until the idea gets old.

137
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:21,846
There's a lower chance of failure in iterative ideas

138
00:07:21,926 --> 00:07:24,948
because when was the last time someone got promoted

139
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:26,828
at a company for failing in the marketplace?

140
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:30,630
Well, typically if you fail in the marketplace,

141
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:34,953
you blow up and it's a sort of a career limiting move.

142
00:07:36,093 --> 00:07:37,654
So you tend to iterate rather

143
00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:39,175
than do something completely different.

144
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:43,517
Everyone seems to have the story of the brand

145
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:46,798
that they helped create as executives in a company.

146
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,734
I was part of X team or Y team.

147
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:51,415
Usually people don't talk about,

148
00:07:51,435 --> 00:07:54,296
I was part of a team that took a risk and it didn't work out.

149
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:58,138
And then finally, and this is a big one,

150
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:00,999
it's a lot easier if you're in a $100 million business

151
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,500
to get the extra 10%, the over $10 million of revenue,

152
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:06,581
or in a billion dollar business

153
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:07,802
and get an extra 100 million.

154
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:09,523
Wow, that sounds really like a big number, right?

155
00:08:10,343 --> 00:08:12,484
Then it is to get to the first 10 million of revenue

156
00:08:12,544 --> 00:08:13,204
on a new idea,

157
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:17,086
or the first $100 million of a new idea.

158
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,441
And so for someone looking to build a career,

159
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:24,643
jumping off the deep end with a brand new idea,

160
00:08:25,344 --> 00:08:27,245
it's the reason why creative people sometimes

161
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:27,945
get in the business.

162
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:31,727
But it's not the best path for the most predictable career.

163
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:36,129
Frankly, if all creative companies was divergent

164
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,231
thinking, and so everybody in the world

165
00:08:39,271 --> 00:08:41,752
was doing things differently, then eventually, luck

166
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:42,393
might run out.

167
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:45,194
Even the most divergent of innovators

168
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:47,335
need some convergence and iteration.

169
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:52,854
But of course, the same old, same old, as we say, gets old.

170
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:59,298
There's always room for something new, especially now.

171
00:09:00,058 --> 00:09:03,080
Now, that's a lot of the reasons why we got into balance studios

172
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,921
and started our studio in the first place.

173
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:10,023
But especially now, it's a good time to recognize

174
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:12,445
that the industry is very cyclical.

175
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:16,607
It's always in a process of consolidation and fragmentation.

176
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:21,160
And they're always breakthrough new products coming supposedly out of nowhere.

177
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,061
Usually it's a team that worked for ten years to get the right idea going,

178
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:26,561
been incubating forever.

179
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:28,582
And supposedly all the new ideas come out of nowhere.

180
00:09:29,922 --> 00:09:35,064
Established game categories are getting bigger, that's a truism.

181
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:36,564
That's where the consolidation is happening.

182
00:09:36,704 --> 00:09:39,985
Only the top few MOBAs are getting the consumers today,

183
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:43,146
the top few Battle Royales, the top few match three games.

184
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:46,867
And they have staying power because they can invest at scale.

185
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:55,254
And before that, before today, or now,

186
00:09:55,814 --> 00:10:00,495
big publishers controlled access to capital, distribution, marketing, and PR.

187
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:03,496
But at the same time,

188
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:07,457
we've never experienced a time where each of these areas are more disaggregated.

189
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:13,078
When it comes to new types of experiences, there's always new capital or

190
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:14,758
always capital chasing new creatives.

191
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:17,669
The different distribution options,

192
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:19,930
virtually for any business model.

193
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,671
And there's world-class marketing PR

194
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:26,393
that's looking to support the best new creative.

195
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:30,574
So we frankly don't see many advantages

196
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:32,575
of being within a single large organization,

197
00:10:32,595 --> 00:10:36,517
especially if you wanna get something done that's new.

198
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:40,958
There are multiple routes for unique experiences

199
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:42,899
if you're deliberate in your choices.

200
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:43,940
It's not.

201
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,677
It's not actually the field of dreams where build it and they will come.

202
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:51,159
It does take a few very deliberate steps.

203
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,302
We'll talk about our perspective on doing divergence.

204
00:10:58,143 --> 00:11:02,445
The key is for us to build ideas that are simple.

205
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:09,069
By simple, we mean sort of really easy to get, easy to understand, accessible.

206
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:10,830
It's easy to get into and start playing.

207
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,412
It's something that is emotional or captivating.

208
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,301
within the first few minutes of play.

209
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:18,002
It doesn't take a long exposition,

210
00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:22,925
a long sort of experience to really understand what it is

211
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:24,566
and say, ah, this feels different.

212
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:27,288
But simple doesn't mean it's complex under,

213
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:28,849
it's not complex under the hood.

214
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:31,351
A lot of times simple ideas haven't been done before

215
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:32,431
because they're super hard to do.

216
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:35,173
Second principle, defensible.

217
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:38,735
Is there a secret sauce that makes this hard to copy?

218
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:41,177
You know, I remember when the first couple

219
00:11:42,238 --> 00:11:44,199
Battle Royals came out and we went to that.

220
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:49,255
E3 with our working prototype for Knockout City.

221
00:11:49,815 --> 00:11:52,957
This was 18 months in incubation, we got it to feel really good and

222
00:11:52,997 --> 00:11:53,897
we want to show it to others.

223
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:57,999
And so many people thanked us for not showing them another Battle Royale.

224
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:00,661
It was about 50 to 100 other Battle Royales in development.

225
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:04,622
Because the ones that had been established had quickly gotten to scale.

226
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:08,945
And the new ones that were coming out were just competing for

227
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:09,985
diminishing audiences.

228
00:12:11,026 --> 00:12:14,307
Not great barriers to entry once competitors were already at scale.

229
00:12:15,228 --> 00:12:18,170
So think about secret sauce, why is it hard to copy?

230
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,251
But also what the set of capabilities on your team

231
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:22,032
that makes your team unique

232
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:24,613
and probably the best to do it as well.

233
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:26,274
Third principle, is it scalable?

234
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:29,216
Scalable in a sense of player engagement,

235
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:32,518
can it engage a player for hours, days, weeks, and months?

236
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,340
And second, can you engage numbers of players?

237
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,681
Can you do hundreds of thousands of users?

238
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:40,703
Can it go to millions of players?

239
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:42,524
These tend to be very important

240
00:12:42,564 --> 00:12:44,205
because when you're taking very risky bets.

241
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,712
Hopefully, there are many, many people willing to enjoy it

242
00:12:48,172 --> 00:12:49,253
over long periods of time.

243
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,615
Sometimes takes a while to figure those things out.

244
00:12:54,216 --> 00:12:56,317
So, when we started Valorant Studios,

245
00:12:56,337 --> 00:13:00,239
our initial focus was not about any specific game idea.

246
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,801
It was all about defining what kind of culture

247
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:04,782
we wanted to cultivate,

248
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:06,903
the type of team we wanted to assemble.

249
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:10,085
We really wanted to bring together veteran talent,

250
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:11,286
as well as new talent,

251
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:14,468
who are all about going after bold new ideas.

252
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,091
And so that kind of divergent thinking, it starts with the team.

253
00:13:18,891 --> 00:13:24,213
So it's really around building a core team and giving them the room to explore.

254
00:13:25,073 --> 00:13:30,534
Now, it's amazing how we hear all the time that a lot of brilliant, creative,

255
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:34,975
and technical folks, they weren't given the room to explore.

256
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:41,477
And these are folks who are deeply curious, deeply curious about new play patterns.

257
00:13:41,497 --> 00:13:43,798
They're not just dreamers, but they're makers.

258
00:13:45,187 --> 00:13:48,949
And at Vellum, there's no separation between inventors and developers.

259
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:53,270
It's not like we hand it off to some other team to go build.

260
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,671
You know, we build it.

261
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:58,012
You know, come up with the ideas and start building and prototyping and

262
00:13:58,912 --> 00:14:00,133
proving or disproving the fun.

263
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:06,135
And it's all about trying to have the smallest possible team

264
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:12,737
to find that atomic core unit of fun, you know, that makes the game work.

265
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:19,135
above all, the team needs to have permission to fail. Failing needs to be seen as equally

266
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:24,958
as good outcome as success. It's when you don't know which one it is that makes it really difficult.

267
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:31,120
But the team needs to have that permission to fail so they can actually take some bold steps.

268
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:39,284
So, the core limits to this test is, can the team build it? And then hand the controller over to

269
00:14:39,324 --> 00:14:40,785
someone else to feel that magic.

270
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:50,571
people just stop playing and they walk away or they can't let go. That's a really important metric.

271
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:59,933
The second thing is once you've kind of defined that culture and you've kind of assembled a team,

272
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:07,015
then it's really about a sort of structured R&D process that comes second. And I'm not

273
00:15:07,055 --> 00:15:11,096
talking about pre-production. Pre-production comes after this sort of period of R&D.

274
00:15:12,641 --> 00:15:19,342
You know, quite frankly, we place sort of minimal value on pitch decks or, you know,

275
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,363
videos and all that kind of stuff.

276
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:28,604
You know, it's really about let's go prototype something and build something and prove whether

277
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:29,584
something is fun or not.

278
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:34,865
And it's really sort of investing against the magic that the team finds.

279
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:41,627
You know, it's the team being really passionate about going after.

280
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:46,845
you know, specific problems that they're trying to solve. It's finding the magic in these core

281
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:53,690
interactions that are really novel and unique and different. And you got to build it and iterate on

282
00:15:53,750 --> 00:16:00,175
it until we can put it in the outsider's hands, you know, and subject to a peer review and see

283
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:06,400
what other people think. And this is, you try and be as rapid as you can. You try and not put a lot

284
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,861
of frills around it. This isn't about.

285
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,771
And unless the game is about an aesthetic

286
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:12,491
that you're trying to define,

287
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:13,751
and that's what's unique about it.

288
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,432
You know, if it's about moment to moment mechanics

289
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:18,292
as an example, you don't need a lot of art.

290
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:21,332
You kind of focus down on what is really necessary

291
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:23,993
to prove or disprove a concept.

292
00:16:25,453 --> 00:16:27,574
And you iterate as rapidly as you can.

293
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:33,054
Now the trick is, and this is challenging,

294
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:36,075
is that it requires independent funding

295
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:38,095
from the actual project fund.

296
00:16:39,523 --> 00:16:42,805
you need to have a lot of patience because the prototype might not work out. You may just have

297
00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:47,768
to throw it away and do something else completely different. If you're prescriptive about the

298
00:16:47,848 --> 00:16:54,653
project from the get-go, when you haven't proven like the core magic in something,

299
00:16:55,533 --> 00:17:00,497
that becomes really hard and you kind of box yourself in. So really, if you can decouple

300
00:17:00,557 --> 00:17:06,821
a different funding source in that R&D period when you're looking for that magic, then

301
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:13,351
you can, you have something that you can then take into pre-production with more of a project

302
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:17,553
financing approach. So I mean just a couple of quick examples like with Mario Kart Live,

303
00:17:17,573 --> 00:17:21,576
for example, when the prototyping began, it was not about making a Mario Kart game.

304
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:26,038
You know, it was actually inspired from drone racing and it was about bringing this visceral

305
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:31,742
feel of driving an RC car in the real world, but making it drive as easily as a video game car.

306
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:34,703
Then it was bringing video game rules around it.

307
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,793
to make it a fun game experiment. And this was a self-funded prototype, which was risky,

308
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:44,616
especially since we didn't know if there was a dare there with this sort of experience.

309
00:17:45,757 --> 00:17:50,760
And we were lucky. We actually found that magic kind of early. It was about in that

310
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:58,184
seven to nine month type of window that we were able to unlock what was special about it.

311
00:17:59,185 --> 00:18:03,607
With Knockout City, we had this core idea of throwing and catching a ball.

312
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:10,238
And every three months or so, we thought we had this core figured out. We put it in the hands

313
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:15,940
of trusted peers and it failed. It wasn't fun. There were problems with it. But the team kept

314
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,243
at it. And it actually took 18 months to really nail that core experience that felt great in

315
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:28,705
people's hands. Sometimes it's really hard to know when you should cut bait on an idea and move on

316
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:31,967
or keep going. And at the end of the day, you got to trust the team.

317
00:18:32,902 --> 00:18:37,907
and decide as a team whether you want to keep going or do something else.

318
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:47,316
At the end of the day, when you're green lighting a project and you're going into full

319
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:52,480
pre-production and production with the intention of building it, we believe that the creative

320
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:54,663
should drive the go-to-market strategy.

321
00:18:55,702 --> 00:19:01,905
This is often like the opposite of what actually happens in companies and large scale companies.

322
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:11,749
It's usually identifying a market opportunity and saying, hey, we need to go after these kinds of consumers or Battle Royales are awesome.

323
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:18,152
They're really hot. Let's go make a Battle Royale. By the way, we play Battle Royales.

324
00:19:18,672 --> 00:19:23,754
Nothing wrong with Battle Royales, but like it's more of a methodology, you know, where.

325
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,301
companies often focus on the market and then say,

326
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:29,661
hmm, what products should we build?

327
00:19:30,582 --> 00:19:34,023
As opposed to you figure out something special and new.

328
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,584
And again, this is the path of divergent new ideas

329
00:19:37,205 --> 00:19:39,426
that creative drives the go-to-market strategy.

330
00:19:39,506 --> 00:19:41,987
And so when you do have that magic,

331
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:44,808
when you do have that prototype

332
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:46,929
that's really special and unique,

333
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:50,090
you then figure out what the right go-to-market strategy is.

334
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,731
Sometimes you can go at it on your own.

335
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:53,972
Other times you need the right kind of partner

336
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:54,732
to be able to.

337
00:19:55,922 --> 00:20:02,564
take it out to market. And if you've, again, proven the fun and you can put in their hands,

338
00:20:03,265 --> 00:20:07,506
it's a lot easier to go find the right partner where it really just kind of clicks, the vision

339
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:15,629
clicks, they really understand the game experience and the audience. But you can do it independently.

340
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:20,731
And if you do it that way, you can start small, but you want to get it really community-focused

341
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:24,213
and into players' hands as quickly as possible.

342
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:30,068
Now, like Mario Kart Live, it was a very different set of go-to-market challenges than Knockout City.

343
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:36,291
With Mario Kart Live, we had a hardware and software experience that we needed to build at scale,

344
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:40,474
and Nintendo was a great partner for us for that project.

345
00:20:41,314 --> 00:20:50,079
And with Knockout City, it's a digital-only, live-service game with a lot of infrastructure requirements to pull that off.

346
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:53,420
And we talked to a number of different potential partners when we had our prototype.

347
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:57,079
And EA, and particularly with the EA Originals label,

348
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,061
became the right partner for us.

349
00:21:00,862 --> 00:21:04,165
Ultimate goal is getting it into gamers' hands.

350
00:21:04,986 --> 00:21:06,827
That's what we're really trying to do.

351
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:14,453
Now, we've talked a lot about divergent thinking.

352
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,596
There's a point at which you've got to make the sucker.

353
00:21:18,256 --> 00:21:22,240
So this is where the dreamer has to become the horse.

354
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,974
transition from divergent to convergent in order to build it and ship it and evolve it.

355
00:21:28,094 --> 00:21:31,997
So sustainability is all about saying, hey, look, we found the magic.

356
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:35,720
We know what really is something special and new.

357
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,703
We figured out here's a risky but viable pathway to market.

358
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:42,344
Here are the partners that we need to do it.

359
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:44,806
You got to put it on a timeline.

360
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:45,867
You have to make it.

361
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:49,570
Building and shipping it and then evolving it.

362
00:21:50,615 --> 00:21:56,897
is really how we think about this as a complete package. Building is iterative.

363
00:21:58,638 --> 00:22:06,621
It extends beyond launch. And part of that is because player feedback is key. This is something

364
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:11,962
totally new. So you think you know how players will respond to it. You can even focus test it

365
00:22:11,982 --> 00:22:16,944
along the way and that kind of thing. But you don't really know until your experience is out in a while.

366
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:23,771
You know, we didn't really, we put track creation into Mario Kart Live,

367
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:27,852
but there isn't a native sharing feature in Mario Kart Live.

368
00:22:28,632 --> 00:22:30,993
We were astounded that there's so many makers out there

369
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:34,194
that are building amazing courses and posting them

370
00:22:34,694 --> 00:22:36,354
and making the experience really their own.

371
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:40,056
Gives us a real insight into UGC in the real world.

372
00:22:40,116 --> 00:22:41,156
Something that we found out,

373
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:44,397
we knew that building was a fun part of what we're doing.

374
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:46,938
We didn't think that the community would embrace it

375
00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:47,698
quite the way that they.

376
00:22:48,412 --> 00:22:55,397
wind up doing it. So shipping it is just a step along the way of delivering an amazing experience.

377
00:22:56,218 --> 00:23:02,863
But, and then budgeting and planning is harder in this context, because when you're looking at,

378
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:05,825
okay, well, how much do I have to build into this before it needs to get out?

379
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:12,229
What kind of break-even do I need to have? They don't have easy comparables.

380
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:17,913
So keeping it as tight as possible in that initial feature spec is super important.

381
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:21,697
because you are taking a risk, because eventually the market

382
00:23:21,737 --> 00:23:22,578
needs to accept it.

383
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:24,899
And then you need to go from there.

384
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,761
Now, the fundamental truth, and I

385
00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:30,303
think every developer has encountered this, especially

386
00:23:30,363 --> 00:23:32,584
on new stuff, everything takes a lot longer and costs

387
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,305
more than you think.

388
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,347
To build some safety margin in there in your system

389
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:38,789
as well as you're doing this.

390
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:41,650
Importantly, though, and we've heard a lot

391
00:23:41,691 --> 00:23:44,993
of talk about this in software and startup culture.

392
00:23:45,975 --> 00:23:49,698
Minimal viable product is a really hard concept for us to get our heads around.

393
00:23:50,618 --> 00:23:53,801
Minimal viable product often means, hey, look, you just have this little bit

394
00:23:53,821 --> 00:23:56,302
and people are going to pay you for it.

395
00:23:56,883 --> 00:23:59,284
And then you can take it to whatever future it needs to have.

396
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,627
What we think we need to do is determine the scope of the experience

397
00:24:04,128 --> 00:24:07,970
that feels complete at launch, but has the potential to grow.

398
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,432
It represents a value for your pricing model,

399
00:24:11,072 --> 00:24:12,573
but then you can evolve it from there.

400
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:17,594
Fundamentally, it's about finding your audience,

401
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:20,275
listening, and evolving it with the player community.

402
00:24:21,055 --> 00:24:23,937
And all of this is a combination of iteration,

403
00:24:24,617 --> 00:24:28,019
about being as rigorous as you can be, patient as you can be,

404
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:29,719
and getting the thing out.

405
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,382
So all of these are sort of a four-part concept.

406
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,564
We summarize it in our business plan

407
00:24:39,584 --> 00:24:40,604
that we've actually posted here.

408
00:24:40,825 --> 00:24:43,606
This is a bit complicated, as you can see.

409
00:24:44,856 --> 00:24:48,697
Now, just a little bit of background, you know, Carthick and I both have MBAs.

410
00:24:49,638 --> 00:24:53,419
There's a proverb in Silicon Valley, you take the number of engineers, multiply it by 10,

411
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:59,022
divided by the number of MBAs that you have, and that's your IQ as a company.

412
00:25:00,062 --> 00:25:04,985
So fortunately, there's just the two of us, and there's lots of great people here at Valiant.

413
00:25:06,045 --> 00:25:09,327
We've experienced being indie before it was cool, when we first started.

414
00:25:10,387 --> 00:25:12,188
We've been in large studio environments as well.

415
00:25:13,857 --> 00:25:15,179
and with mega franchises.

416
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,801
Now being back at NDA, it's fine for a different,

417
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,702
it was important for a different kind of plan.

418
00:25:21,584 --> 00:25:23,826
You know, beyond the 50 to 100 page decks,

419
00:25:24,547 --> 00:25:26,769
beyond all the market studies and things like that,

420
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:29,611
we really laid it out to the simplest possible method

421
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:30,292
that we can have.

422
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:32,373
So build an awesome team.

423
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:36,657
Find the magic in something new

424
00:25:37,017 --> 00:25:39,079
that the team is truly passionate about

425
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:41,041
because passion drives the patience.

426
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,039
and the insight for innovation.

427
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:44,820
Figure out how to get the market,

428
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,860
because if it's really great,

429
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,021
there's probably a way to do that.

430
00:25:47,861 --> 00:25:50,462
Probably partners that can help you do it as well.

431
00:25:51,603 --> 00:25:53,764
And then build and ship it, evolve it with a community.

432
00:25:53,784 --> 00:25:55,945
So that's what we set out in October, 2016.

433
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:01,847
And look, some of this is a work in progress.

434
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,349
We've had some success with Mario Kart Live.

435
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:07,310
We have great expectations for Knockout City.

436
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,470
We think you're gonna love that too.

437
00:26:09,727 --> 00:26:13,829
But what we found overall is that simple is hard.

438
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,191
So it's always easier said than done.

439
00:26:17,852 --> 00:26:19,773
So every bit of the plan, you know,

440
00:26:19,793 --> 00:26:21,574
simple plans have a shot at working

441
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,855
because there's a million details to execution

442
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:26,096
and execution has to be great,

443
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:29,658
both for consumers as well as the competing marketplace.

444
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:32,900
Complex strategies tend to fail

445
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,881
because you're stacking complex strategies

446
00:26:34,941 --> 00:26:36,442
on top of complex execution.

447
00:26:37,594 --> 00:26:40,456
So the most important thing for you to do in all of this

448
00:26:41,196 --> 00:26:41,997
is to be able to say,

449
00:26:42,397 --> 00:26:45,159
how simple can I make my effort and my proposition?

450
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,821
Well, we're on a journey.

451
00:26:49,242 --> 00:26:50,542
Good luck on your journey.

452
00:26:50,963 --> 00:26:52,904
You know, when we look for ideas,

453
00:26:52,984 --> 00:26:55,306
we look for the best ideas that are simple and powerful

454
00:26:55,726 --> 00:26:57,107
with hidden depth and nuance.

455
00:26:57,947 --> 00:26:59,808
We try to find them in creative people everywhere

456
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:02,210
and bring them together in an awesome team.

457
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:04,371
Our effort at Balanced Studios

458
00:27:04,411 --> 00:27:06,433
is to build a sustainable model to do this.

459
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:16,116
We just wish that as many people that can do this are doing this, because I think that'd be great for the industry, great for consumers, great for players everywhere. Thank you.

460
00:27:16,797 --> 00:27:23,806
Thanks for spending 30 minutes with us and listening to this talk. Appreciate it. Take care.
