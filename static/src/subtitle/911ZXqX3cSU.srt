1
00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:08,031
All right, so today's talk for me,

2
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:11,052
designing great UX into your board game pieces,

3
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,513
game board and pieces.

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,834
So first, who am I?

5
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:16,796
This is my first board game track to be talking to,

6
00:00:16,796 --> 00:00:19,037
so I actually haven't had a chance to meet a lot of you,

7
00:00:19,037 --> 00:00:21,919
and a lot of you haven't obviously met me.

8
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:24,480
I started way back on judge and jury decision making,

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,862
like how juries would make decisions

10
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,164
in cases involving complex scientific testimony

11
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:32,925
like DNA evidence or economic damage models.

12
00:00:33,627 --> 00:00:36,849
I burned out of that and joined a bunch of other grad school,

13
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:39,851
psychology grad school burnouts at Microsoft Game Studios.

14
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:42,813
And we worked in the usability and play testing labs there.

15
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:45,695
And we basically studied how groups of people played games

16
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:48,237
and what made the games fun and what made them not fun.

17
00:00:48,237 --> 00:00:51,279
I decided I wanted to build a bunch more games, actually,

18
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:52,060
and learn how they're made.

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,641
So I joined up with Big Huge Games.

20
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:56,063
And as a sort of producer, designer, UX person,

21
00:00:56,063 --> 00:00:59,945
shipped a bunch of PC and console games.

22
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:02,283
Burned out of that, went to Amazon,

23
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:05,025
learned about social computing.

24
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:09,108
So how do we encourage people to, oh.

25
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:10,849
No, but, I don't know.

26
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:14,972
So how do you encourage people to, oh, do you need,

27
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:20,556
oh, stick this in, sorry.

28
00:01:20,556 --> 00:01:24,739
Sorry about that, everyone.

29
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:27,841
All right, now I gotta figure out how this guy goes.

30
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:27,941
Okay.

31
00:01:28,564 --> 00:01:30,905
All right, yeah, so went to Amazon, learned things like,

32
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:34,446
how do we convince people to write better reviews

33
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:39,007
or convince people who haven't ever written a review before

34
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:41,188
to write a review or to upload a video of them

35
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:42,188
demonstrating a product?

36
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:43,508
And then how do we, on the consumer side,

37
00:01:43,508 --> 00:01:45,369
help surface that information to purchasers

38
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:47,329
in their buying pipeline so they can make

39
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:48,550
a more informed purchase decision?

40
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:53,929
Myst Games went to Zyngo where I did more social games that was kind of related a little bit to the stuff

41
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:58,478
I was working on at Amazon and then ended up at Disney Mobile made some mobile games and then for the past five years or

42
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:00,081
So I have been a consultant

43
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:03,585
The things that I do, I study human beings.

44
00:02:03,585 --> 00:02:05,807
I like watching people do things.

45
00:02:05,807 --> 00:02:07,969
I identify user experience issues.

46
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:09,891
I recommend fixes to teams.

47
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:13,494
I mentor game designers, PMs, and UXers,

48
00:02:13,494 --> 00:02:15,056
and provide some sort of strategy

49
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:17,318
so that we can figure out how to mesh your business

50
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:19,460
and creative goals with your actual user experience,

51
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,421
the way people perceive and interact with things.

52
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:24,524
Why I do it, the top reason is probably the same reason

53
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:25,725
why you all are in it.

54
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:26,986
We love games, right?

55
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:27,747
So that's number one.

56
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:30,298
I love watching people play games.

57
00:02:30,298 --> 00:02:33,199
I might have mentioned that a few times already.

58
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,260
And I love helping people make games.

59
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,582
I'm not the person with the idea for the next great game,

60
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:42,404
but I love helping people achieve their goals.

61
00:02:42,404 --> 00:02:45,506
One thing I don't do is make board games.

62
00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:48,528
I do run an elementary school board game club,

63
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:51,870
and they make games, and I give them little hints

64
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,831
or suggestions or whatever, and it's super fun,

65
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:55,452
but I myself don't actually make them.

66
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,202
Maybe I can get some part marks for doing some digital versions of board games.

67
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:04,304
So Catan is something that I worked on for Xbox Live Arcade,

68
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:07,386
helped out with how do you make the trade interface understandable and fun?

69
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:10,408
How do you communicate with people across different languages?

70
00:03:10,408 --> 00:03:12,930
Also heavily involved in designing the tutorial and

71
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,072
onboarding experience for new players who'd never played before.

72
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:22,496
Similarly with a Star Wars card battler that existed for maybe a month or two.

73
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,177
Again, player progression, combat,

74
00:03:24,177 --> 00:03:25,998
how do you get people into the core loop of the game?

75
00:03:26,484 --> 00:03:28,426
but also the tutorial and onboarding.

76
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:29,847
And the reason why I'm focusing a bit

77
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:32,991
on the tutorial and onboarding is that it gets,

78
00:03:32,991 --> 00:03:35,153
when a lot of my work that I was doing in this area

79
00:03:35,153 --> 00:03:37,696
made me think about the ideal way of learning,

80
00:03:37,696 --> 00:03:39,158
and it's learning as you play,

81
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:40,960
not learning then playing, right?

82
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,861
Learn as you play.

83
00:03:42,582 --> 00:03:44,443
And this can happen in board games, right?

84
00:03:44,443 --> 00:03:46,084
We all have the friend, or maybe you

85
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:47,926
are the friend, who is very knowledgeable about games,

86
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:49,286
knows all the games, knows all the rules.

87
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:51,748
Not only knows all the rules, but is really

88
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:53,609
good at teaching the rules and teaching them

89
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,230
in the context of actually playing the game.

90
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,111
So it's actually a fun experience

91
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,272
to get onboarded to a new game.

92
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:02,587
But typically, or fairly commonly, right,

93
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:03,928
we're all learning the game together

94
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:05,389
and trying to struggle to figure it out.

95
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:07,650
And you can see, you know, this is a familiar scene to folks,

96
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,591
right, piecing things together.

97
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:11,632
Someone's scouring through the rule book

98
00:04:11,632 --> 00:04:13,933
and hoping that at some point or other

99
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,034
you'll get to fun gameplay.

100
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:22,834
So the board game exercise that I'm going to be talking about today is something I've run on all sorts of different groups.

101
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:28,618
Elementary school kids, college students, game industry professionals, other UX professionals.

102
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:30,800
I run them in cities all over the world.

103
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,701
It sounds exciting.

104
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:34,743
It's not that exciting, except for me, because I like watching people play games.

105
00:04:34,743 --> 00:04:37,145
The basic exercise is this.

106
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:38,666
The players group up.

107
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:43,710
I give them a game that they've never played before, and I tell them, go figure out how to play.

108
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,671
You got 20 or 30 minutes.

109
00:04:46,063 --> 00:04:49,526
And I observe players without helping them.

110
00:04:49,526 --> 00:04:51,388
So no manual, and they can ask me questions,

111
00:04:51,388 --> 00:04:52,909
but I'm not gonna answer any of them.

112
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:57,322
After about 20 or 30 minutes,

113
00:04:57,322 --> 00:05:00,324
when I see that all the teams have some sort of game

114
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:02,886
going on and they're playing, we break it down.

115
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,308
So the team explains what they came up with

116
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:07,149
based on the board game in pieces.

117
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:09,311
We diff the version that they came up with

118
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:10,852
with the actual rule set,

119
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,893
and then we discuss how the board and the pieces

120
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:15,995
helped or hurt their learning of the game,

121
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:18,878
where it steered them right and where it steered them wrong.

122
00:05:18,878 --> 00:05:20,759
And then we brainstorm fixes together.

123
00:05:22,783 --> 00:05:25,864
So why would I be so cruel?

124
00:05:25,864 --> 00:05:27,724
Why would I bring board games that we all love

125
00:05:27,724 --> 00:05:29,304
and put them in front of people who've never played them

126
00:05:29,304 --> 00:05:30,645
before and force them to struggle?

127
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:33,345
As it turns out, as we'll find out at the end,

128
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:36,226
this is a super enjoyable exercise for people,

129
00:05:36,226 --> 00:05:38,027
a wide variety of people.

130
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:40,427
It's fun to play with these essentially toys

131
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:42,908
because they're just pieces and boards.

132
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:44,888
But my biggest, the reason why I do this,

133
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:47,229
and it's been kind of something that I've talked about

134
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:48,049
for years and years, is.

135
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:50,607
I believe that game improvement only comes

136
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:51,708
through pain transference.

137
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,369
So we need to take the pain from the player

138
00:05:54,369 --> 00:05:57,049
and put it on the shoulders of the developer.

139
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:58,610
And also, we're designing these days

140
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,111
for a world where no one reads.

141
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,251
And so what other tools do we have?

142
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:05,232
Well, of course, the board and the pieces.

143
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:09,254
So my background is more traditionally in video games.

144
00:06:09,254 --> 00:06:11,014
And the neat thing about video games

145
00:06:11,014 --> 00:06:12,715
is they have board and pieces, but they also

146
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:14,595
have computer feedback, which helps a lot.

147
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:15,536
When you're playing a board game,

148
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:17,116
the board game doesn't necessarily

149
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:17,837
give you feedback.

150
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:21,852
actively based on your decisions.

151
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:23,933
So for Pac-Man, for instance, on the left,

152
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:27,733
the game starts, whether I'm holding the joystick or not,

153
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:29,854
my Pac-Man starts swooping off.

154
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:31,994
I hear the bloop, bloop, bloop of things being eaten.

155
00:06:31,994 --> 00:06:33,634
I see them disappearing.

156
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:35,475
I see the score incrementing.

157
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:38,415
I might notice that there's some interesting blinking things

158
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:39,956
that maybe I should investigate at some point,

159
00:06:39,956 --> 00:06:42,296
but whoa, there's this red, angry-looking ghost,

160
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:43,016
and he's coming at me.

161
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:44,257
I should probably avoid him.

162
00:06:45,032 --> 00:06:46,772
And the other thing I want you to notice about that

163
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:52,035
is the cherry at the bottom right.

164
00:06:52,035 --> 00:06:53,636
This is in terms of progression, right?

165
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:56,397
So we've set the mode on easy to start with.

166
00:06:56,397 --> 00:06:58,318
So new people coming into the game

167
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,219
will have a better chance of surviving for a bit

168
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:00,839
and figuring it out.

169
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,580
If we started on peach or pretzel,

170
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,760
new players would just get wiped out

171
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,421
before they could even figure out how to play the game.

172
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:07,966
On the right, you have StarCraft.

173
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:09,026
You start in a world.

174
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:10,448
You have a little base.

175
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:11,749
You've got a bunch of machines going.

176
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:12,709
They're gathering things.

177
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:13,750
They're bringing to the base.

178
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,011
You can see the counters on the right.

179
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:16,833
We're accumulating resources.

180
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,635
Maybe I can use those resources to build things.

181
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:21,877
You start to see the edge of the map, the fog of war.

182
00:07:21,877 --> 00:07:23,638
It's like, oh, there's more to this.

183
00:07:23,638 --> 00:07:24,939
Maybe I should go out exploring.

184
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:27,081
And then you look at the mini-map on the bottom left.

185
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,702
And you're like, oh, this is a big world.

186
00:07:28,702 --> 00:07:31,904
And there might be other people who are not my friends

187
00:07:31,904 --> 00:07:33,065
out there, and I need to be careful.

188
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:42,074
And the other thing is, too, talking again about how to make content so that it's easier for people to learn how to play.

189
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:44,295
Starcraft starts always with the Terrans, the humans.

190
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:47,016
They're the most human-like and they have a very traditional build structure.

191
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:55,399
So people can get a sense of the game before they start to introduce them to the more exotic races.

192
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,400
So how does this apply to the board game in context?

193
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:02,252
So these are three of the games that I use. I use a variety of games

194
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:07,901
I'm going to talk most more about Castle Panic and Cartagena and not about Deus Ex today

195
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:09,363
But yeah, how does this translate?

196
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,478
And as it turns out, like, as most of you know,

197
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:15,139
this is probably the first thing that you all do

198
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:17,060
when you open up a new box, right?

199
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,881
Most people, most of these groups that I ran

200
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:21,523
who'd never played these games before

201
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:24,284
knew to assemble the board in a way that made sense.

202
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:26,065
They knew to match like things together.

203
00:08:26,065 --> 00:08:29,827
And with this, their sort of intuitive first guesses,

204
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:32,849
they started to figure out like what kind of game this is

205
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:34,210
and how they might begin to play it

206
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,871
and maybe what some of the victory conditions are.

207
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,731
The question I have though is how do we go from here

208
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:42,133
where you're sorting the cards, it's all new and exciting,

209
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:44,995
to here where you're actually having fun,

210
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:47,757
enjoying the game, learning the strategy,

211
00:08:47,757 --> 00:08:48,898
having your sodas and popcorn.

212
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:54,075
So from my perspective, when I think about game user experience,

213
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:58,959
the largest job that I tend to do and a lot of us tend to do is what I call removing the suck, right?

214
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,662
There are just a lot of sucky things about figuring out the game,

215
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:03,704
and they're not intentional by the game designers.

216
00:09:03,704 --> 00:09:08,168
But the problem is, is that the designer has the world in their mind,

217
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:11,891
and players have to sort of share that world and be a part of it.

218
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:14,754
And there are a lot of things that can impede that sharing.

219
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:20,130
So for instance, like, is this a great initial experience

220
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:20,530
of a game?

221
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,831
Like, I bought a game because I wanted to learn,

222
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:24,973
I wanted to play as a pirate escaping

223
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:26,654
from a medieval dungeon, right?

224
00:09:26,654 --> 00:09:30,156
I didn't want to buy a game to read a whole bunch of rules.

225
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:32,957
So when I wrote, when I put Cartagena through these groups,

226
00:09:32,957 --> 00:09:34,458
here are some of the things that emerged.

227
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,340
The pause, on the positive side,

228
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,641
board set up was super intuitive, right?

229
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:40,482
They have all these pieces, puzzle pieces

230
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:41,502
that fit together nicely.

231
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:43,624
People figured that out quickly.

232
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:43,944
Oops.

233
00:09:43,944 --> 00:09:43,984
Ah.

234
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,512
The, yeah, they figured that out.

235
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:51,994
They figured out that there's some sort of maze aspect to it

236
00:09:51,994 --> 00:09:53,775
and you start at one end and where you wanna get

237
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:57,877
is to the boat, because the boat's how you escape, see?

238
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:59,798
Then you can see one person's holding cards in their hand

239
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,219
and they say, okay, we'll deal out some cards,

240
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:02,960
we'll spend some cards to move our pieces around

241
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,140
and somehow or other we'll figure out

242
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,742
how we draw cards to replenish our hand.

243
00:10:06,742 --> 00:10:08,383
And the victory conditions are, get on the boat.

244
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,883
So a couple things emerged, though, that were troublesome for groups and how they got things

245
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,245
wrong when they're figuring out.

246
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:20,427
The first thing was that the icon flavoring.

247
00:10:20,427 --> 00:10:23,550
So this is one of the, it's a theme that I'm going to talk about a couple more times.

248
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:26,294
where art and UX can be in conflict.

249
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:28,696
So the idea is you've got a bunch of pirates

250
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:30,477
you're trying to escape, but they're pirates.

251
00:10:30,477 --> 00:10:31,938
So they see shiny objects on the ground

252
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:33,319
and maybe they pause and take a look

253
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:34,440
and examine it for a second.

254
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,360
And it makes sense.

255
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,702
There's keys to treasure chests,

256
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:39,903
there's gems, there's bottles of rum.

257
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:43,466
But where people got stuck was on the skull, for instance.

258
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:45,027
So if you see the skull on the board,

259
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:46,888
they thought if they landed there,

260
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:48,610
maybe they would die, right?

261
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:53,413
And then if you look at the gun and the knife cards,

262
00:10:53,413 --> 00:10:56,114
they thought, well, this game must involve combat

263
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,315
because, like, why would we have knife and gun cards

264
00:10:58,315 --> 00:10:59,715
if we couldn't attack other pirates, right?

265
00:10:59,715 --> 00:11:02,336
Well, actually, none of that exists in the game, right?

266
00:11:02,336 --> 00:11:04,457
These are just all abstract things

267
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:07,318
that pirates might collect on the way out of the dungeon.

268
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:09,960
And so it led them to come up with different rules

269
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,901
and ways to play the game, some involving combat even.

270
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:16,042
And they created card battler games out of Cartagena.

271
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:20,286
And then the core mechanic of drawing cards and playing cards.

272
00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:23,069
They understood that playing cards moved them forward on the board,

273
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:24,590
but they didn't understand, and who could blame them

274
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,351
if you haven't played card-taking before,

275
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:29,854
the way that you get new cards is you move your player backwards

276
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:34,418
to the closest occupied space and you get that number of cards.

277
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:37,581
Not very intuitive, but once you learn it, it makes sense.

278
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,911
So the teams came up with suggestions.

279
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:42,633
One is, hey, let's just remove the misleading icons.

280
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:45,095
Why do we need a skull and a gun and a knife?

281
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:46,916
We can replace them with a crown and

282
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,598
a treasure map and a goblet or something like that.

283
00:11:49,598 --> 00:11:51,920
The other thing for the card drawing rules,

284
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,221
they already included this arrow card which you had to read

285
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:58,324
the rules to understand why it even existed or how to use it.

286
00:11:58,324 --> 00:12:01,987
Well, replace that with a quick reference card that explain

287
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,990
the basic rules of moving forward by spending cards,

288
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,491
getting cards by moving backwards.

289
00:12:08,998 --> 00:12:11,922
King of Tokyo was another game that I ran a whole bunch of.

290
00:12:11,922 --> 00:12:17,569
Again, it's a beautiful manual, but what can we figure out

291
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:21,013
without that manual?

292
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:24,738
So really intuitive, the idea this is a monster brawl game.

293
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:27,481
The figures are all posed like they want to kill each other.

294
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:29,629
There's Tokyo, it's on fire,

295
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:31,870
so they're trying to invade Tokyo, obviously.

296
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,850
There's a bunch of dice that look exciting.

297
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,491
They have claws, which are the way you damage people,

298
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:39,172
of course, and hearts, the way you heal yourself.

299
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:41,793
And, you know, there's monsters,

300
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:42,973
and you win the game by killing

301
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:46,514
all the other monsters, right?

302
00:12:46,514 --> 00:12:48,195
The things that didn't go so well here was,

303
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:51,096
one of the core mechanics is these special cards.

304
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:53,756
So you see the four energy zombify card.

305
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:57,280
People intuitively thought that, well, this is here,

306
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,001
so we're gonna deal them out to everyone.

307
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:02,142
Everyone has a handful of cards that we'll play with.

308
00:13:02,142 --> 00:13:03,943
Well, actually, you're supposed to collect,

309
00:13:03,943 --> 00:13:05,403
when you roll the dice, you're supposed to collect

310
00:13:05,403 --> 00:13:08,144
energy cubes based on the number of energy bolts you roll,

311
00:13:08,144 --> 00:13:11,926
and then spend those during your turn to earn those cards.

312
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:15,187
And so we figured out that it was the disconnect

313
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:17,848
between going from bolt to cube to then bolt again

314
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:19,809
on the card that caused some confusion there,

315
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:21,089
and people didn't necessarily get that.

316
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:25,532
They knew that you could enter and exit Tokyo and that not everyone could live in Tokyo,

317
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:30,059
but they didn't know the rules for why people would come into Tokyo and why they would have

318
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:30,781
to leave.

319
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:31,943
And then victory conditions.

320
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,111
They understood when you look at the top card there

321
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:37,072
and you see the 19 beside the star in blue,

322
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:38,453
they understood that went from zero to 20.

323
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:40,875
They're like, well, zero is probably where you start

324
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,936
and 20 is probably where you win,

325
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:44,817
but how do we get those victory points?

326
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:46,738
And really, we have cryptic clues

327
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:48,860
on the bottom left of the map there

328
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,261
where you've got the arrow and one star

329
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:54,844
and then the square brackets and the plus two stars,

330
00:13:54,844 --> 00:13:56,184
but they were a little bit cryptic.

331
00:13:56,893 --> 00:13:58,394
Also, there was no way for them to guess

332
00:13:58,394 --> 00:14:00,495
that the numbers on the dice actually

333
00:14:00,495 --> 00:14:02,415
referred to victory points.

334
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:04,756
And you needed to get sets of three or more

335
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:07,237
to earn some victory points.

336
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:09,858
So some of the suggestions we came up with was, well,

337
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:11,399
if you're already kind of torn between,

338
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,979
like, you don't want to ruin the art of your game

339
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:14,480
by putting a whole bunch of UX elements on it, right?

340
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,561
You've already made the decision to put some icons and text

341
00:14:18,561 --> 00:14:19,142
on there.

342
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:22,523
Why not just actually make it sort of stand out and clean it

343
00:14:22,523 --> 00:14:25,524
up a bit so that people can figure out what's going on?

344
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,289
by looking at it, and it's not quite so cryptic.

345
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:30,951
And that's the bottom left that I'm referring to there.

346
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:33,213
Iconography, so for energy, for instance,

347
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:35,194
why not have it always be cubes, right?

348
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:37,576
So the dice have a cube on it,

349
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:38,637
the card has a cube as the icon,

350
00:14:38,637 --> 00:14:40,338
and then you've got these cubes.

351
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,319
That's one way to go about it.

352
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:43,800
The other way is the aftermarket way.

353
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,222
You can actually buy, I don't know how many of you guys,

354
00:14:46,222 --> 00:14:48,003
you all play King of Tokyo,

355
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:51,085
but you can buy the little aftermarket lightning bolts,

356
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:52,366
energy bolts, so that you can have

357
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:53,547
this consistent experience.

358
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,755
And then the victory points, the dice,

359
00:14:56,755 --> 00:14:59,497
how do we make it so that the dice indicate

360
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:01,658
that there's a way to get victory points to the dice,

361
00:15:01,658 --> 00:15:02,399
maybe coloring them.

362
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,579
We weren't really sure,

363
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:05,941
but some sort of pattern matching or coloring

364
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:07,262
and making that consistent with the color

365
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:09,003
of the victory points.

366
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:12,084
Castle Panic was next.

367
00:15:12,084 --> 00:15:15,566
So a lot of the positives here,

368
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,648
people really quickly picked up

369
00:15:17,648 --> 00:15:18,868
and learned a lot about the game

370
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:19,929
just by looking at the board.

371
00:15:20,873 --> 00:15:24,434
They looked at the middle of the board, it said castle.

372
00:15:24,434 --> 00:15:26,775
Okay, we've got a castle, there's monsters

373
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:28,655
who are gonna enter, they're gonna enter from the forest

374
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:30,056
far away from the castle.

375
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:32,096
Right, that made sense, then monsters are gonna move

376
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:35,237
towards the castle and attack the castle.

377
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:37,438
They understood that by looking at the cards

378
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:39,018
that they would get, they'd use the cards

379
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:41,439
to combat the monsters and there were certain zones

380
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:44,780
that they could attack based on what card they had.

381
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,120
And the victory conditions, interestingly enough,

382
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,681
almost every group that I've played with this ever,

383
00:15:49,284 --> 00:15:52,129
knew it was cooperative right from the beginning.

384
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:54,473
They knew it was the world against them.

385
00:15:54,473 --> 00:15:56,677
A couple of them riffed on some ideas

386
00:15:56,677 --> 00:15:58,260
about player versus player,

387
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,663
but almost unanimously they knew

388
00:15:59,663 --> 00:16:01,185
it was a cooperative experience.

389
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:12,101
So, the board set up, you can see on the circle here at the bottom right, they have all the

390
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:16,143
walls and the towers on the outside, which is not exactly correct.

391
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:19,245
You want the walls on the outside and then the towers are kind of the keep in the middle

392
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:22,227
and it's when the keep falls down entirely that that's when the game's over.

393
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:25,237
The rules of play, so the help text,

394
00:16:25,237 --> 00:16:27,337
they had actually help text on the board

395
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:29,658
and in these player cards that everyone

396
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:32,459
could take their little player reference card,

397
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,859
but they were vaguely worded,

398
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:36,340
and they were worded more for reminding

399
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,860
as opposed to learning.

400
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,561
So they had more vague statements like draw up,

401
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:41,662
well how many cards do I draw,

402
00:16:41,662 --> 00:16:43,522
how many cards am I supposed to have?

403
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:47,463
They had play cards, well how am I supposed

404
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:48,644
to play the cards, am I supposed to use them

405
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:49,684
to attack or do other things?

406
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:51,853
They had one that's move monsters.

407
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:53,313
Well, how many do I move?

408
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:54,814
Do I move all of them, some of them?

409
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:55,594
Do I, you know, what do I do?

410
00:16:55,594 --> 00:16:58,715
And then another problem that emerged was combat resolution.

411
00:16:58,715 --> 00:17:00,836
So you've got these trolls that look big

412
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:02,216
and they count to one, two, and three,

413
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:06,758
and then you got orcs who are smaller and are one and two.

414
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:08,978
But you know, what are those numbers really mean?

415
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:10,099
Are they hit points?

416
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:10,759
Are they strength?

417
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,100
Is that how much damage they do?

418
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:12,340
Is it both?

419
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:17,321
So some of the suggestions that the group came up with

420
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:17,841
were.

421
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:21,397
First, marking the board.

422
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:25,440
So again, this is another art versus UX trade-off thing

423
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,462
where maybe there's ways that we can elegantly,

424
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:30,804
so that it looks nice, put some silhouettes

425
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:32,265
of where the footprints of the walls

426
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:34,827
versus the key pieces would go.

427
00:17:34,827 --> 00:17:36,788
Decoupling hit points from attacks.

428
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:38,569
So imagine if we used on the bottom right here,

429
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:41,251
if we used specific icons to indicate damage,

430
00:17:41,251 --> 00:17:43,013
the cards dealt those damage to the icons,

431
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:45,614
and then you map those icons onto the pieces.

432
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:48,509
And then tidying up the help text wording

433
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:51,692
to make it relevant to both, or useful to both players

434
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:54,395
and returning players who might have just forgotten

435
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:55,916
some of the rules.

436
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,279
So adding things like drop to five max cards,

437
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:03,825
move all your monsters.

438
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:06,367
And finally, Quirkle.

439
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:10,197
A really neat game, anyone who, I mean,

440
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:11,879
every group always had at least a few people,

441
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:14,061
if not everyone, who'd played Dominoes or Mahjong

442
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:14,742
or something like that.

443
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:16,825
And so they quickly figured out, you know,

444
00:18:16,825 --> 00:18:18,647
okay, we got a tile pile in the middle,

445
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:20,449
we draw them, we make racks,

446
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:21,871
and then we match them together

447
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:24,434
and somehow we win or lose.

448
00:18:25,712 --> 00:18:26,753
That was the problem though.

449
00:18:26,753 --> 00:18:29,033
These pieces are so abstract that there were like

450
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:31,314
an infinite number of ways they could possibly

451
00:18:31,314 --> 00:18:31,994
put them together.

452
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:34,095
And so they spent a lot of time trying to figure out

453
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:36,175
what the rules of this game were.

454
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:37,956
And that meant that they couldn't really figure out scoring

455
00:18:37,956 --> 00:18:40,957
or when the game was supposed to end.

456
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:44,878
And this was a case where we kind of threw our hands up

457
00:18:44,878 --> 00:18:45,178
in the air.

458
00:18:45,178 --> 00:18:46,339
We're like, board and pieces?

459
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:47,619
Well, there really are only pieces

460
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:49,139
and there's not much we can do with those

461
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:51,960
that won't even make it more confusing potentially.

462
00:18:52,837 --> 00:18:55,078
But we did talk about optimizing the scoring sheet.

463
00:18:55,078 --> 00:18:56,839
You can see on the left, the Quirkle score sheet's

464
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:57,780
pretty generic.

465
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,861
It's just columns of numbers.

466
00:18:59,861 --> 00:19:01,723
It doesn't really have any guidance whatsoever

467
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,384
about scoring and how to play the game.

468
00:19:03,384 --> 00:19:05,145
Whereas you can compare that with the rule

469
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:05,845
through the ages one.

470
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:11,749
You've got both scoring and some rules that are helpful.

471
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:13,490
So how does this help you?

472
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,311
I mean, none of you, I don't think,

473
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:17,113
are going to come up with the next Cartagena expansion

474
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:18,113
or whatever.

475
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:20,356
The reason why I'm presenting this stuff is more about

476
00:19:20,356 --> 00:19:22,437
to talk about a process that might be useful to you.

477
00:19:22,437 --> 00:19:24,077
And it's a process that supplements

478
00:19:24,077 --> 00:19:25,818
your normal play testing.

479
00:19:25,818 --> 00:19:28,639
So you don't use this process for early game development

480
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,439
where you're iterating with your core group of designers

481
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:32,480
and trying to figure out what are the fun

482
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,440
and interesting strategic things about a game

483
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,240
that you want to make.

484
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,161
They're not about balance feedback

485
00:19:37,161 --> 00:19:39,241
or about testing for degenerate conditions

486
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:42,582
or golden paths or anything like that.

487
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:47,635
The idea is to help you think differently about your design decisions, and think hard

488
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:52,820
about the tradeoffs between art and usability, and rely less on the, well, we'll just solve

489
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,104
it with the manual kind of mentality, or people will Google it to figure it out.

490
00:19:57,104 --> 00:20:01,067
With the end result being, let's make it easier for people to pick it up and play it, because

491
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,528
you can't ship yourself with the game.

492
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:06,212
So in terms of directing your energies,

493
00:20:06,212 --> 00:20:09,273
I consider the gold standard to be, you know,

494
00:20:09,273 --> 00:20:11,534
iterating on the board and pieces themselves.

495
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:15,375
When you fix the issues at the top of the funnel,

496
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,656
it means you can make for more efficient use

497
00:20:17,656 --> 00:20:19,196
of any kind of additional documentation, right?

498
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:20,937
If you can clarify a whole bunch of stuff

499
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:21,977
through the actual board,

500
00:20:21,977 --> 00:20:25,258
that means you can eliminate maybe sections of the manual

501
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,679
and replace it with things that people will,

502
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,860
that are known to struggle with.

503
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,220
And so you can prioritize.

504
00:20:31,141 --> 00:20:33,123
what content goes into the manual,

505
00:20:33,123 --> 00:20:35,344
and you can actually cut with confidence

506
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:37,046
things that maybe don't need to appear there

507
00:20:37,046 --> 00:20:38,547
because you only have limited space.

508
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:41,769
The late production iteration is more costly

509
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:43,190
than earlier iteration,

510
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,852
but there's new tools to make it cheaper,

511
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:46,473
like laser cutters and 3D printers.

512
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:47,834
This is from Matt Leacock.

513
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:50,756
It was a paper prototype for a chariot racing game,

514
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:53,618
and he got himself a Kickstarter laser cutter

515
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:55,860
and made himself a fancy little board and everything.

516
00:20:58,302 --> 00:21:00,924
Another vector of attack is, you know,

517
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:02,905
QRCs, scorecards, and help text, right?

518
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:05,187
Remember when you're designing these,

519
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:06,308
it's for two audiences.

520
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:07,769
One is for the players who wanna learn

521
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:09,850
how to play the game, but the other is,

522
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,712
sometimes it's a party game or something like that.

523
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:12,993
It comes out only during social events,

524
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:14,273
and you don't maybe play it more than once

525
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,835
every few months, and it's a mix of new

526
00:21:16,835 --> 00:21:18,857
and experienced players to it.

527
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:21,359
The reminders are different than the learning how to play,

528
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,000
and so make sure you're designing for both

529
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,720
and testing for both.

530
00:21:24,098 --> 00:21:25,979
This is also from Matt Leacox here,

531
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:27,259
the role through the ages.

532
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:30,141
He's got a really cool time lapse video on his website

533
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:32,001
that shows 24 different iterations of this card.

534
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:34,562
So it's important to keep iterating through these

535
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:36,123
during your play sessions.

536
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:40,683
The fancy manual, when I worked in video games

537
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:43,065
at the beginning, we actually shipped paper manuals

538
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:44,726
with games, that hasn't happened in years.

539
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:47,568
But the only things I ever cared about were the center fold,

540
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:49,410
it had to be controller mapping layout,

541
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,612
and then the last page had to be the,

542
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:54,114
oh my God, I'm stuck, we need to have the top three things

543
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:57,216
that we know people get stuck on and list them there.

544
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:59,398
Because my thought was, you're only gonna go to the manual

545
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:00,258
if you're stuck, right?

546
00:22:00,258 --> 00:22:02,400
So we might as well make it easy.

547
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,131
The other thing you can do with the manual

548
00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:06,653
is kind of repurpose it a little bit.

549
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:08,235
I talked a little bit about how you can,

550
00:22:08,235 --> 00:22:10,859
when you focus on the UX at the higher levels,

551
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:12,381
it means you can streamline your manual,

552
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:13,883
maybe even cut sections of your manual

553
00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:15,666
and replace it with other stuff,

554
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,108
like the stuff that people find confusing.

555
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:21,911
But also, I think it's really useful to consider adding these quick start modes to your game.

556
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:25,333
I learned, I sort of first learned about this when I was working on Catan for Xbox Live

557
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:30,156
and I discovered that one of the later versions of Catan actually started with the starting

558
00:22:30,156 --> 00:22:31,037
map for beginners.

559
00:22:31,037 --> 00:22:35,180
It's a nice balance board, it takes away the early decisions that are overwhelming to users

560
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,281
like where do I put my initial settlement and road.

561
00:22:37,962 --> 00:22:42,869
And it makes it so that players start collecting resources right away because it's a balanced board

562
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:47,695
And then so they start building things early trading early and gets them really into the fun parts of it early on

563
00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:50,980
And so investing more time into that kind of mode would be great

564
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,525
Especially if you can reduce the content you need to include as the traditional manual

565
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,963
And then for your digital content,

566
00:22:57,963 --> 00:22:59,565
again, this sort of helps you streamline.

567
00:22:59,565 --> 00:23:03,348
Between when my game ships or hits the shelves and now,

568
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:07,372
I might only have time to make one or two videos.

569
00:23:07,372 --> 00:23:10,435
What videos do I make in terms of explaining the game?

570
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:11,696
Well, you'll have studied.

571
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:13,478
You'll know what some of the key problems are.

572
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:14,759
And you'll get a chance to make those videos

573
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:18,082
to supplement that.

574
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,353
I talked a lot about making, you know,

575
00:23:21,353 --> 00:23:23,174
finding the sock and eliminating the sock,

576
00:23:23,174 --> 00:23:24,455
but one of the other cool things

577
00:23:24,455 --> 00:23:25,436
about doing these exercises,

578
00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:27,198
and this is what I'm gonna wrap up on,

579
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:30,561
is that actually you get a chance to see people

580
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:32,422
using what you've made in delightful ways

581
00:23:32,422 --> 00:23:33,924
that might be totally unexpected.

582
00:23:33,924 --> 00:23:36,205
So in Cartagena, we had some people

583
00:23:36,205 --> 00:23:37,827
who experimented with the tiles and said,

584
00:23:37,827 --> 00:23:39,248
well, what if an earthquake happened

585
00:23:39,248 --> 00:23:41,110
or something happened where we shifted around the tiles

586
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,531
partway through the game based on an event?

587
00:23:43,612 --> 00:23:45,233
We had another group who said,

588
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:47,395
well, this isn't a free-for-all game, this is a team game.

589
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:49,536
And we've got the pirates on the right team

590
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:50,817
and the pirates on the left team

591
00:23:50,817 --> 00:23:53,739
racing toward the boat, fighting each other over the boat,

592
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:54,839
and the first team to get on the boat

593
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,320
and leave the island win.

594
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,543
Not necessarily what Cartagena was going for,

595
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:04,205
but these are ideas for expansions maybe that you can make

596
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:07,127
or other ideas, maybe you've got some other game ideas

597
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:09,288
you're noodling on, and some of these mechanics

598
00:24:09,288 --> 00:24:10,729
might inspire you to try something different.

599
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:13,801
And the final one is.

600
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,859
Now, I doubt the inventor of Quirkle

601
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:32,499
really wanted to make Jenga out of Quirkle.

602
00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:35,120
But maybe the inventor of Quirkle is like,

603
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,001
you know, Jenga's a pretty fun game.

604
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:37,721
Quirkle, I like.

605
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:40,022
Maybe there's some new variant of Jenga that I can make up.

606
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:42,323
And so it gives you new ideas and creative ways

607
00:24:42,323 --> 00:24:43,243
to sort of expand what you do.

608
00:24:43,243 --> 00:24:44,523
And I'll end on that.

609
00:24:44,523 --> 00:24:46,324
So we have a few minutes left to take some questions.

610
00:24:46,324 --> 00:24:46,624
Thank you.

611
00:24:46,624 --> 00:24:46,964
Thank you.

612
00:24:46,964 --> 00:24:47,364
Thank you.

613
00:24:47,364 --> 00:24:47,904
Thank you.

614
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:48,065
Thank you.

615
00:24:48,065 --> 00:24:48,225
Thank you.

616
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:55,147
Thank you.

617
00:24:55,147 --> 00:24:55,567
Thank you.

618
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:55,987
Thank you.

619
00:24:55,987 --> 00:24:56,207
Thank you.

620
00:24:58,214 --> 00:24:59,455
Do we want people to come up to the mic?

621
00:24:59,455 --> 00:25:00,776
No, OK, I'll just repeat the question.

622
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:02,438
So if you can shout it out, or you can feel

623
00:25:02,438 --> 00:25:07,883
free to come to the mic.

624
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:11,066
I was just wondering if there's any common UX pitfalls

625
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:14,108
that you saw amongst all the games you were testing.

626
00:25:14,108 --> 00:25:16,731
That is the million dollar question.

627
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:19,713
The question's about, are there common pitfalls?

628
00:25:19,713 --> 00:25:19,933
And I think

629
00:25:20,378 --> 00:25:22,239
If I could write that book, I would probably

630
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:24,659
be like a millionaire and retired a million times over.

631
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:27,280
But I think the biggest thing is having this

632
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,120
as part of your process.

633
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,620
Because you start to, within your own genre of game

634
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,181
and the games that you make, you start to learn

635
00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:33,801
the patterns of what happens.

636
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:37,702
So that's one thing is I can't give you a common answer,

637
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,802
but I can say that the process works if you let it work.

638
00:25:40,802 --> 00:25:44,423
But one of the common things is where I talk about this.

639
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:46,123
Usually it's a creative direction problem

640
00:25:46,123 --> 00:25:46,643
where it's like.

641
00:25:47,431 --> 00:25:49,252
We want the game to be immersive,

642
00:25:49,252 --> 00:25:50,813
and so we want the art to be beautiful,

643
00:25:50,813 --> 00:25:52,394
but also we want the game to be immersive

644
00:25:52,394 --> 00:25:53,694
and we want it to be understandable.

645
00:25:53,694 --> 00:25:56,136
And that conflict right there,

646
00:25:56,136 --> 00:25:58,857
how much art is too much art and distracts you away

647
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,378
from actually learning how to game play.

648
00:26:00,378 --> 00:26:03,079
And as I mentioned during some of those examples,

649
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,480
those were some key issues.

650
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,241
It's like the art looked great,

651
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:09,282
but it was unintentionally distracting

652
00:26:09,282 --> 00:26:10,343
and not in a good way.

653
00:26:10,343 --> 00:26:15,846
Thank you.

654
00:26:16,338 --> 00:26:17,679
I don't know if this is working.

655
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:18,360
Oh, yeah.

656
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:18,740
OK.

657
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,864
So I noticed that you were saying that for the test,

658
00:26:22,864 --> 00:26:24,706
at least, you take the rule books out,

659
00:26:24,706 --> 00:26:27,068
but leave the quick reference cards in.

660
00:26:27,068 --> 00:26:28,990
Would you say that quick reference cards

661
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,191
are superior to rule books?

662
00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:31,573
And if you could simplify it enough,

663
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:33,355
would you say a game would be better

664
00:26:33,355 --> 00:26:35,857
if it was just two or three quick reference cards

665
00:26:35,857 --> 00:26:36,718
with no rule book at all?

666
00:26:37,824 --> 00:26:39,446
That's an interesting question.

667
00:26:39,446 --> 00:26:41,629
So could we just eliminate the need for manual

668
00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:43,371
and have these awesome quick reference cards?

669
00:26:43,371 --> 00:26:44,272
I think that would be great.

670
00:26:44,272 --> 00:26:46,695
I think you're always going to need some sort of manual,

671
00:26:46,695 --> 00:26:48,617
especially for, like there are some games that

672
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:49,458
don't lend themselves well.

673
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:52,902
I picked specifically games that they take an hour to play,

674
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,825
they're more partyish games, they're not as deep.

675
00:26:55,431 --> 00:26:58,052
And I think for those types of games, yes, exactly that.

676
00:26:58,052 --> 00:26:59,972
Want to move away from the manual

677
00:26:59,972 --> 00:27:02,053
into just like, let's start sorting things out

678
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,774
and figuring out how to play from the cards themselves.

679
00:27:04,774 --> 00:27:05,894
So I can't give you like the overall,

680
00:27:05,894 --> 00:27:08,055
like I don't, like I'm fighting for a world

681
00:27:08,055 --> 00:27:09,495
where we never have to have another,

682
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,536
no, I'm not arguing for that at all.

683
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:13,336
But I think there are definitely classes of games

684
00:27:13,336 --> 00:27:14,757
where it's not necessary to have one,

685
00:27:14,757 --> 00:27:16,597
or that doesn't have to be the expectation

686
00:27:16,597 --> 00:27:17,358
that I need to read the manual

687
00:27:17,358 --> 00:27:18,278
before I can learn how to play it.

688
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:23,656
Hi, I'm Krzysztof from Asmode Poland.

689
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:31,420
Have you thought while this testing about the some information that you put on a board is language dependent.

690
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:37,343
And while developing the game, you want to keep some of the components language independent, language neutral.

691
00:27:37,343 --> 00:27:40,465
Have you find any? Do you?

692
00:27:40,465 --> 00:27:46,948
Can you tell us any good thoughts about that that you that you saw while you were exploring this topic?

693
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,948
Yeah, that's a good question.

694
00:27:48,948 --> 00:27:51,672
So about game localization, and obviously it's

695
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,134
much cheaper and more streamlined

696
00:27:53,134 --> 00:27:54,656
to be able to design a game once and ship it

697
00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:56,538
across all languages.

698
00:27:56,538 --> 00:27:59,903
The suggestion that some of the teams made for King of Tokyo,

699
00:27:59,903 --> 00:28:03,347
where let's tidy up the wording or some of the cards

700
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:05,771
for Castle Panic.

701
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:14,282
Yeah, it's a tricky situation when you want to focus on words themselves as a solution.

702
00:28:14,282 --> 00:28:20,931
First of all, just because words can clarify things, but people read the words as Moses

703
00:28:20,931 --> 00:28:22,754
from the mountain kind of thing.

704
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,862
If you write something in a way that doesn't exactly make sense,

705
00:28:25,862 --> 00:28:28,365
you might actually harm them more than help them.

706
00:28:28,365 --> 00:28:30,066
In terms of localization, though, we

707
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:32,368
didn't see any specific trends.

708
00:28:32,368 --> 00:28:36,132
We just noticed that it's, I think, as a process thing,

709
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,014
you'll just want to iterate more on them

710
00:28:38,014 --> 00:28:41,517
to make sure that those non-verbal hints are

711
00:28:41,517 --> 00:28:44,039
being effective and effectively conveying what you want.

712
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:45,901
And one thing that we struggle at is that,

713
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:47,482
like on the King of Tokyo board, it's like,

714
00:28:48,047 --> 00:28:49,928
those icons were kind of meaningless to people,

715
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,789
and they didn't really explain what was going on.

716
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:54,290
Now, again, that also, you bring that back to the fact

717
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:58,072
that, as a reminder, it works great if I already

718
00:28:58,072 --> 00:29:00,293
know the rules, basically, but as a new player

719
00:29:00,293 --> 00:29:01,053
to discover them.

720
00:29:01,053 --> 00:29:02,754
And then you just make the trade-off yourself.

721
00:29:02,754 --> 00:29:06,835
You say, well, yeah, we can't localize this

722
00:29:06,835 --> 00:29:07,856
across a bunch of languages.

723
00:29:07,856 --> 00:29:13,058
And so we're just going to, just for the sake of the business,

724
00:29:13,058 --> 00:29:16,960
we're going to make sure that we just use the icon-only version.

725
00:29:21,357 --> 00:29:23,779
The others.

726
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:26,241
All right, I think I'm supposed to remind everyone

727
00:29:26,241 --> 00:29:29,303
that I guess you'll get an email asking for feedback.

728
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:31,705
So feedback encouraged.

729
00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:36,029
I love to learn and make my speeches and talks better.

730
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:37,710
And I'm happy to stick around at the end

731
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,311
and talk to people individually.

732
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:40,052
Thanks very much.
