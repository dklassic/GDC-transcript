00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:07,809
Hello.

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,611
So, hi.

3
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:12,311
I'm Nicolae Barbecem.

4
00:00:12,672 --> 00:00:15,153
I'm an indie game developer from Romania,

5
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:18,354
and also the founder of Those Awesome Guys,

6
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:21,195
which is quite ironic because legally,

7
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:23,096
I'm the only one in the company.

8
00:00:24,837 --> 00:00:27,058
People also know me as Xelu,

9
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,800
and I've been making games for about,

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,541
I think, five or six years.

11
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:36,983
The number always differs every time I say it.

12
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:40,958
And I've been making a lot of browser games made in Flash.

13
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:43,201
I've took part in many game jam.

14
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:46,484
And for the past two years, I've been

15
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,525
working on my most ambitious project yet,

16
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:52,589
called Move or Die, which is this four-player party

17
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:55,912
game based around the idea that if you stand still,

18
00:00:56,413 --> 00:00:56,873
you explode.

19
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:04,446
And I'm not only mentioning this because, well, I've been working on it for, wait, three

20
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:05,186
years, not two years.

21
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:09,387
And also because it's coming up later this year.

22
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:14,188
But also because I'm going to use it in the context of game feel.

23
00:01:14,548 --> 00:01:18,650
I'm going to use it to talk about why your death animation sucks.

24
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,351
So I want to talk a bit about feedback.

25
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:25,851
I'm sure all of you know what...

26
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,812
Feedback is, but I'm not referring to the kind of feedback you get from a person.

27
00:01:31,473 --> 00:01:37,196
I'm referring to the type of feedback that you get from pressing a physical button.

28
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:44,580
When you press a button on a controller, it feels much better than using a touchscreen.

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,981
And I think we can all agree on that.

30
00:01:47,802 --> 00:01:50,963
That's probably why I'm not such a big fan of mobile games.

31
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:56,472
And the thing is, Game Feel doesn't only apply to games.

32
00:01:57,032 --> 00:02:00,553
It's basically feel with game appended to it.

33
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:05,634
So we can see it being applied in other areas,

34
00:02:05,694 --> 00:02:08,835
like have you noticed when you're typing a message

35
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:11,055
on your phone or when you're sending an email,

36
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:14,476
how whenever you press a letter,

37
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:18,376
it pops above your finger and it makes a little sound effect

38
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:19,876
or maybe the phone vibrates.

39
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:27,179
All of these are not cosmetic only, they're also functional because now you no longer

40
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:34,042
have to offset your vision from the keypad to the actual message to see if your input

41
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:34,563
registered.

42
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:38,405
You already know it did because you heard that little clicky sound or you felt the phone

43
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:38,845
vibrate.

44
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,947
So it makes the act of typing a message much, much faster and more enjoyable.

45
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,470
And this is how Game Feel can make an experience better.

46
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:54,277
I want to show a few examples of Game Feel, when it's done right and when it's not done

47
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:54,538
right.

48
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,341
And this is the first example.

49
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:08,464
Yeah, so I don't know what that was.

50
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:11,746
It's just a random game I found on YouTube.

51
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:12,986
I don't even know the name of it.

52
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:18,509
But yeah, that game looks like it feels horrible.

53
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:23,971
I mean, there's no muzzle flash on the shotgun.

54
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:27,593
There's like a smoke asset that lasts for like three frames.

55
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:29,534
And the sound effect is really cheap

56
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:31,174
and it doesn't make you feel

57
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:32,355
like you're shooting a real gun.

58
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,316
It kind of feels like you're playing around with a toy gun.

59
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,201
and it doesn't give weight to the weapon.

60
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:42,263
So, that feels bad, without even mentioning the way the guy died,

61
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:45,285
and that he has 24 rounds in a pump-action shotgun.

62
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:47,366
But that doesn't count.

63
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:50,287
This is an example of a weapon done well.

64
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,744
Right, so that's Bulletstorm and that feels amazing.

65
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:07,669
That's a flail gun, if I'm not mistaken, and it shoots two bombs

66
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:11,013
chained together and you can see them wrap around your enemy and you can

67
00:04:11,053 --> 00:04:13,997
remotely detonate them and see the guts fly all over the screen

68
00:04:14,097 --> 00:04:15,739
and that's so good.

69
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:23,597
In conclusion, the thing is, game feel is the kind of thing that when it's there, nobody

70
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:27,040
notices it, but when it's not there, everybody notices it.

71
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,843
It's the kind of thing that makes you say, this game feels good, but I don't know why.

72
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:41,733
I'm going to create a death animation in the context of move or die without using any hand-drawn

73
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:46,598
frame-by-frame explosions or anything like that, and I'm going to try to make it feel good.

74
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:51,463
So, let's see. I am going to assume we don't have anything, so I'm going to start with the basics,

75
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:54,486
and I'm going to need movement and a death condition. So...

76
00:04:55,427 --> 00:05:00,793
I'm going to skip the movement part because you can pretty much find all over the internet

77
00:05:00,813 --> 00:05:04,116
the building blocks of game development, how to create physics.

78
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:08,821
But for the sake of this presentation, I'm going to take the life mechanic out so you

79
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:13,887
won't explode if you stand still, but I'm going to say that whenever a player jumps

80
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:16,549
on another player, that player will explode.

81
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:24,488
I'm talking about games here, and I could be showcasing this using photos or images,

82
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,278
sorry, or videos, but I'm talking about the game, so let's make this interactive.

83
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:30,919
So.

84
00:05:31,926 --> 00:05:33,787
And it's going to be stupid, and I really hope it works.

85
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:36,068
What I have here is two controllers.

86
00:05:36,368 --> 00:05:38,489
And what I'm going to attempt to do

87
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:41,030
is have two people from the audience

88
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,131
play the game in real time as I'm building it.

89
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:46,312
So who wants to try this?

90
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:47,693
I want to see some hands up.

91
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:55,896
And somebody help me spread these out.

92
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,157
Give it to somebody around there.

93
00:05:59,538 --> 00:05:59,678
So.

94
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:02,047
or you.

95
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:05,869
Cool, so what I'm gonna need you two to do

96
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,690
is whenever the game appears on screen,

97
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:10,392
run at each other and jump on each other's heads.

98
00:06:11,272 --> 00:06:13,153
What I'm gonna need everybody else do

99
00:06:13,654 --> 00:06:15,895
is give them a round of applause anytime they do so

100
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:19,417
to show our appreciation for them helping me make this work.

101
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:22,158
So, let's see if this work.

102
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:23,239
Go.

103
00:06:41,755 --> 00:06:47,937
cool! Except it's not cool. It's horrible. It's not good enough. There are no animations,

104
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:52,779
the characters disappear instantly, it feels bad. It doesn't feel rewarding to eliminate

105
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,140
your opponent. So.

106
00:06:55,807 --> 00:07:00,130
what should we add? We should add animations. So I'm going to create an animation,

107
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:04,774
talk a bit about sprite sheets versus asset sheets, export back, and implement them.

108
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:11,819
So the first thing I do in Move or Die is I split the character into many tiny pieces that I can

109
00:07:11,859 --> 00:07:15,762
later import in Adobe Flash, where I make all my animations.

110
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,103
and I animate them in Flash,

111
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:22,867
and then I have to decide how I implement

112
00:07:23,628 --> 00:07:24,589
the graphics in the game.

113
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,133
The most common method is sprite sheets,

114
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:31,357
and I'm sure all of you know what a sprite sheet is,

115
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:32,938
and just in case somebody doesn't,

116
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:35,061
it's basically all the frames of the animation

117
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:36,162
stored in a bigger image.

118
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:45,910
So I don't use this. The reason I don't use this is because it's quite a big image and

119
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:52,215
it takes a lot of resources and especially if you have a game with really high resolution assets

120
00:07:53,016 --> 00:07:57,279
and a lot of animations it can basically make your computer catch on fire.

121
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,861
So what I am using is something I call asset sheets,

122
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:05,362
which I'm still not sure if it has an official name,

123
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,403
but that's what I call them,

124
00:08:07,023 --> 00:08:08,323
which is basically the same thing,

125
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:10,964
but instead of exporting each frame of the animation,

126
00:08:10,984 --> 00:08:13,645
I export each part of my character,

127
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:15,666
and then export the animation separately

128
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,907
using a custom exporter as a text file.

129
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,868
So this is how a frame looks like in the animation,

130
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:24,829
and I have there the X, Y coordinates.

131
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:28,770
scale, rotation, alpha, and I can interchange

132
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,011
these variables very easy.

133
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:34,292
So, as a comparison, this is how the sprite sheet

134
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:37,133
would look for those, like, what, four or five animations

135
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:39,734
I showed before, and this would be 5700 by 3100 pixels,

136
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:40,334
which is quite a lot.

137
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,494
In comparison, this is the asset sheet,

138
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,555
which is 460 by 210, which is less than 1%

139
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:45,395
of the number of pixels.

140
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:59,549
The advantage with asset sheets is that they're small, they're flexible, optimized.

141
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,391
You have individual control over many variables.

142
00:09:02,631 --> 00:09:08,073
I could, for example, if I wanted a different character with a bigger right leg, I wouldn't

143
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:12,095
have to export another, like, sprite sheet and go through the whole process again.

144
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:16,457
I could just change the scale number in the code and have it done real time.

145
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:17,857
So that's awesome.

146
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,857
And another awesome thing is interpolation.

147
00:09:20,277 --> 00:09:21,658
I'm sure you all play the game that

148
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:24,699
uses sprite sheets animations and tries

149
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:25,619
to go into slow motion.

150
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,539
And it looks really choppy because it plays the same frame

151
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,720
multiple times.

152
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,141
But with asset sheets and having the frame as text,

153
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:36,742
you can spread them apart and interpolate between them

154
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:38,722
and create data where there is none.

155
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:41,443
So you can have really smooth slow motion, which

156
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:42,483
looks really awesome.

157
00:09:42,903 --> 00:09:44,884
And it's really awesome to have as a tool.

158
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:45,844
So.

159
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:49,937
Let's see how the game looks with animations in it.

160
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:51,739
Go! ♪♪♪

161
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:57,203
Nice.

00:09:57,984 --> 00:09:59,385
It already looks much better. ♪♪♪

163

You're the yellow. Who's the blue one?

Oh, by the way, let's do something.

167
00:10:14,437 --> 00:10:15,378
One more. Cool.

168
00:10:17,848 --> 00:10:22,492
Enough of that. It's not good. It's still not good enough. There are animations, but

169
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:30,877
it still doesn't feel rewarding. So what could I add to make this feel better? Any suggestions?

170
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:38,982
Just yell it out loud. Screen shake! Sound effects. Somebody said sound. Good. So I'm

00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:46,347
going to add sound effects. So for sound effects I'm going to do movement, death, and the environment.

172
00:10:48,403 --> 00:10:52,225
Sound effects are really important and they make a huge difference.

173
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:58,509
And it's really sad to see that developers leave this at the last step in the development.

174
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,211
And they're really important because they completely change the feel of the game.

175
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:03,792
So here are some examples.

176
00:11:03,952 --> 00:11:08,175
I've sent some gameplay footage to some sound designers,

177
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:11,617
and I asked them to do sound effects without any context.

178
00:11:11,697 --> 00:11:15,619
I just gave them a piece of footage without any sound in it.

179
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,160
So this is how it sounds.

180
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:30,782
Okay, fair enough.

181
00:11:31,782 --> 00:11:34,944
The thing is, I did this with multiple sound designers.

182
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:36,865
So here is another example

183
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:47,029
and how it completely changes the way the game feels.

184
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:53,772
As you can see, this one was a bit more moody.

185
00:11:53,832 --> 00:11:56,853
There was a lot of echo and it felt like a bigger

186
00:11:57,073 --> 00:11:59,735
environment only by changing the sound effects.

187
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:04,685
Lastly, this is a last third example, which is my personal favorite.

188
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:16,669
See why.

189
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,370
Right, so you can see how important sound effects are.

190
00:12:25,737 --> 00:12:33,859
So let's add sound effects. I'm going to add sound effects for movement and it's really important to have them be very subtle and a lot of variation.

191
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:38,941
So let's start with the jumping sound effect. It's going to sound like this.

192
00:12:41,842 --> 00:12:44,423
Cool. So this is a simple jumping sound effect.

193
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:49,668
The thing is, it repeats a lot, and it's really annoying when you have, like, when you play

194
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:53,471
a game and there are, like, only two footstep sounds, and it's really freaking annoying.

195
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:56,973
So what I'm going to do is make it subtle, and I'm gonna turn down the volume.

196
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:00,588
which is right off the bat much better.

197
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:02,469
But I want to add variation.

198
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:04,630
So I'm going to use a little trick here.

199
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,551
Instead of using multiple sound files, what I'm going to do

200
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:10,272
is bend the pitch of the sound in real time

201
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:11,373
every time it plays.

202
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:15,114
So with that, it's like one line of code, and you get this.

203
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:21,917
Only by adding a slight pitch bend.

204
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:24,858
So that's a simple jumping sound effect.

205
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:27,199
When it comes to footsteps.

206
00:13:29,217 --> 00:13:31,619
Really subtle and a lot of variation.

207
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,361
I didn't add any footsteps in Move or Die

208
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:36,503
because they're four characters, they're really small,

209
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:38,084
and they run really, really fast.

210
00:13:38,524 --> 00:13:41,146
So having footsteps for those would be kind of suicidal.

211
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:45,369
So I skipped that and jumped to the death sound effect,

212
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,411
which I'm going to combine multiple sounds

213
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:49,332
to create a satisfying end result.

214
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:51,314
So I'm going to start with a strong impact

215
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:52,255
that sounds like this.

216
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:53,736
Awesome.

217
00:13:54,536 --> 00:13:57,178
I'm going to layer it on top of a smaller impact.

218
00:13:58,675 --> 00:14:01,316
Cool. And finally I'm going to need a really

219
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:06,158
satisfying squishy sound. Yeah. It doesn't make much sense

220
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:07,519
but it's going to make more sense later on.

221
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:10,100
So I'm going to combine all of these to

222
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,582
create this sound effect. Nice. Now this sounds like satisfying

223
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:17,383
when you kill somebody you want to hear this.

224
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:20,864
And one last thing, the environment. It's really important to

225
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,025
add sound effects to your environment. You notice those little

226
00:14:23,265 --> 00:14:25,426
two blocks that disappear when you touch them? They're

227
00:14:25,446 --> 00:14:26,147
going to make this sound.

228
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:31,674
And that's it. It's really important because you want to add context to the world around you.

229
00:14:31,794 --> 00:14:36,055
When you play a first-person shooter and you knock over a chair, you want to hear it hit the ground.

230
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:38,096
Otherwise, it doesn't have weight to it.

231
00:14:38,936 --> 00:14:40,196
So, bless you.

232
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:43,697
Let's see how the game sounds with sound effects in it.

233
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:48,518
[♪ Music and sound effects ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪

234
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:48,978
Nice!

235
00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:51,818
Quickly, pass the controller!

236
00:14:57,073 --> 00:14:57,553
Come on.

237
00:14:58,753 --> 00:14:59,314
Ah, nice.

238
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:03,175
Cool.

239
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:06,196
I have to go really fast through these because I don't have much time.

240
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:07,557
So you know what I'm going to say?

241
00:15:07,577 --> 00:15:08,977
It's not good enough.

242
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:10,238
So, um.

243
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,472
What I'm going to do next is I'm going to add something I call death paint.

244
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:21,296
I need a way to show where a character died and reward you for eliminating your opponent

245
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:24,217
by leaving a little splatter on the background.

246
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:29,180
So what I did is I went on the internet and found these assets and I changed them to match

247
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,401
the colors of the player.

248
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:36,064
And what I'm going to do is spawn one in the background whenever somebody dies.

249
00:15:36,224 --> 00:15:37,725
So they're going to look like this.

250
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:42,446
I'm going to add a bit of variation by rotating them and changing their scale,

251
00:15:43,387 --> 00:15:47,130
but they will match the player's color. So they're going to look like this,

252
00:15:48,011 --> 00:15:54,976
which is absolutely horrible, and it looks ugly. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to render

253
00:15:55,036 --> 00:16:01,461
them behind everything except the background. So that's much better, but it's still not good

254
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:07,125
enough. I wanted to also make an impact on the floor and on the tiles around you.

255
00:16:08,754 --> 00:16:14,537
Sorry, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create an alpha mask for the ground and the tiles

256
00:16:15,378 --> 00:16:20,301
and I'm going to apply that on a second layer of paint that's going to go on the foreground. So

257
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:27,645
that's going to look like that, which is much, much better. Also, it's on additive blending mode.

258
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:31,508
But before the demo, I want to add one more thing.

259
00:16:32,234 --> 00:16:35,096
because we all love particles, I'm going to add particles

260
00:16:35,716 --> 00:16:38,238
that fly out of the player that died

261
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:39,900
and they're gonna leave a little splatter

262
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,463
everywhere they touch the ground or the tiles around them.

263
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:47,966
So, let's see how the game looks with those.

264
00:16:47,986 --> 00:16:48,286
Make a mess.

265
00:16:48,346 --> 00:16:48,627
♪ Make a mess ♪

266
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:48,927

♪ Make a mess ♪

273
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:57,434
Come on, we need some blue.

274
00:16:57,454 --> 00:16:57,874
There we go.

275
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,851
Imagine this with four players.

276
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:04,131
Nice.

277
00:17:05,652 --> 00:17:11,393
Now these splatters also fade out in time, so it tells you when a player died in time.

278
00:17:12,753 --> 00:17:13,214
Enough of that.

279
00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:15,934
You know what I'm gonna say.

280
00:17:17,014 --> 00:17:18,595
It's not good enough. So,

281
00:17:19,595 --> 00:17:23,436
what should I add to make this feel even better? Somebody said something around here.

282
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:28,157
Screen shake. Is anybody from Vlambeer in the audience?

283
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:33,137
So, I'm going to add a few final touches.

284
00:17:33,257 --> 00:17:35,938
I'm going to add screen shake, chromatic aberration,

285
00:17:36,698 --> 00:17:38,178
shockwave, and haptic feedback.

286
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:41,099
So, screen shake, it's really simple.

287
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,560
It's gonna play out whenever somebody dies.

288
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,881
This is a bit too much for the sake of the presentation,

289
00:17:45,961 --> 00:17:48,161
so I'm going to tone that down a little bit,

290
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:51,382
and it's gonna look like, come on, oh, there we go, cool.

291
00:17:51,783 --> 00:17:54,563
So that looks good, but it's still not good enough.

292
00:17:54,803 --> 00:17:56,624
I'm going to add chromatic aberration.

293
00:17:57,736 --> 00:18:01,262
For those who don't know, it's basically splitting the color channels and offsetting them,

294
00:18:01,762 --> 00:18:05,007
which is slowly becoming the new lens flare of 2015.

295
00:18:06,489 --> 00:18:09,113
So I'm going to do that and animate it whenever somebody dies,

296
00:18:09,313 --> 00:18:10,775
and it's going to look like this.

297
00:18:12,478 --> 00:18:12,718
Cool.

298
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,140
Which is, again, a bit exaggerated.

299
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:17,983
And also I mentioned shockwave.

300
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:20,584
I'm going to create basically a white donut

301
00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:23,044
that keeps growing, and I'm going to apply that

302
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:25,965
as a displacement map on the whole screen

303
00:18:26,145 --> 00:18:29,065
whenever somebody dies and is gonna make this ripple

304
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:31,586
in the screen, which looks really satisfying.

305
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:34,486
And finally, haptic feedback.

306
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:36,227
The controller will vibrate whenever you die.

307
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:38,087
You guys won't be able to tell this,

308
00:18:38,147 --> 00:18:39,387
but those who are playing will,

309
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:41,127
so go ask them after the presentation.

310
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:43,288
And.

311
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:47,157
Let's see how all that comes together in the game.

312
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:50,499
Nice.

313
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:01,584
You're having fun.

314
00:19:04,806 --> 00:19:08,587
Cool, so all of all of these are really important because, um...

315
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:12,737
not, not only do they look good, like the

316
00:19:12,757 --> 00:19:14,498
chromatic aberration and the screen shake and all that,

317
00:19:14,938 --> 00:19:17,439
they also let you know that somebody else died

318
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,581
somewhere else on the screen without you having to

319
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:24,643
look there. So it gives you, like, contextual, peripheral vision.

320
00:19:25,403 --> 00:19:30,006
So I'm gonna say that's good enough, at least

321
00:19:30,146 --> 00:19:30,506
for now.

322
00:19:32,553 --> 00:19:35,435
But there are a lot of things you might have missed.

323
00:19:36,315 --> 00:19:39,237
There are, have you noticed the little props

324
00:19:39,657 --> 00:19:41,519
that are on the ground that characters can kick around?

325
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:45,561
It also gives weight and depth to the universe of the game.

326
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,103
The landing dust, this is really important.

327
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:50,184
There is a mode in the game where every player

328
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:52,206
is invisible on the same screen,

329
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:54,587
and you have to figure out where you and the other players

330
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:56,929
are only based on that little puff of dust.

331
00:19:58,109 --> 00:20:00,610
The eyes, the characters look at each other all the time,

332
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,130
and this is really important to have personalities

333
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,611
injected in your characters.

334
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:09,211
And in the full game, they're happy when they win,

335
00:20:09,231 --> 00:20:11,432
they cry when they lose, and when you're tied

336
00:20:11,472 --> 00:20:14,112
with somebody score-wise, they give each other mean looks.

337
00:20:15,232 --> 00:20:16,013
And finally, rhythm.

338
00:20:16,553 --> 00:20:18,593
All the background elements pulsated

339
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:20,894
on the rhythm of the music, so that gives the game

340
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:22,394
a nice rhythm to it.

341
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:27,656
One last thing before I end this.

342
00:20:28,656 --> 00:20:29,997
I want to end this on a high note,

343
00:20:30,017 --> 00:20:31,478
so I'm going to try to make something epic.

344
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:35,640
Can the yellow player go in the other corner of the screen

345
00:20:35,841 --> 00:20:36,781
and the blue one in this one?

346
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:38,662
OK, stay there.

347
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:41,704
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a countdown.

348
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:44,866
And when I say go, I want you to run at each other

349
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:46,387
and jump on each other's head.

350
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:49,709
Except I'm going to make this a bit more epic.

351
00:20:50,489 --> 00:20:51,310
Let's see if this works.

352
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,851
So stay there.

353
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:54,569
Ready?

354
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:55,990
3, 2, 1, go!

355
00:20:56,371 --> 00:21:02,195
Go, go, go, go!

356
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:12,142
Blue, let him kill you, let him kill you!

357
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:13,143
The timing...

358
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:13,543
Nice!

359
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:25,971
Thank you!

360
00:21:32,914 --> 00:21:33,614
Thank you very much.

361
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:36,255
This was just a small demonstration.

362
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,476
The whole game is currently in early access on Steam.

363
00:21:38,536 --> 00:21:40,837
You can get it there and give it a try.

364
00:21:41,358 --> 00:21:47,180
And again, thank you for having me here and let's keep this conversation going.

365
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,622
You can find me on Twitter, Skype, Facebook, whatever.

366
00:21:51,062 --> 00:21:52,102
If you're using email, do that.

367
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:58,462
Let's keep this conversation going and if any of you have any questions or if we have

368
00:21:58,502 --> 00:21:59,142
time for questions.

369
00:21:59,162 --> 00:22:00,143
Yeah, we have time for questions.

370
00:22:00,163 --> 00:22:00,463
Go ahead.

371
00:22:03,344 --> 00:22:03,664
Anyone.

372
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:06,686
I could, I could leave the game.

373
00:22:06,706 --> 00:22:07,987
Alright, thank you.

374
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:08,267
In the banana.

375
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:09,107
Ah, that won't work, never mind.

376
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:10,268
Alright, thanks.

377
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:13,129
If anyone has any questions for us, please give us a call and we will be happy to answer

378
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:13,430
any questions.

379
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:13,650
Thank you.

380
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,010
Alright, thank you.

381
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,170
Bye, bye.

382
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:14,350
Bye, bye.

383
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:14,430
Bye.

384
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:14,510
Bye.

385
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:14,610
Bye.

386
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:20,013
Bye.

387
00:22:20,033 --> 00:22:20,093
Bye.

388
00:22:20,113 --> 00:22:20,173
Bye.

389
00:22:20,193 --> 00:22:20,273
Bye.

390
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:20,353
Bye.

391
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:20,433
Bye.

392
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:20,513
Bye.

393
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:20,593
Bye.

394
00:22:20,613 --> 00:22:20,693
Bye.

395
00:22:24,365 --> 00:22:24,588
Thank you.
