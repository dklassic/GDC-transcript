1
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,880
Okay. So, hey everybody.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,681
I want to thank you all so much for coming today.

3
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:10,862
It's really nice to see you here.

4
00:00:11,822 --> 00:00:14,043
Before we get started, I've been asked to do a little housekeeping

5
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:15,764
and remind you all to please mute your phones

6
00:00:15,804 --> 00:00:16,865
if you haven't already done that.

7
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:19,526
And also, if you'd be so kind as to please fill out the survey

8
00:00:19,546 --> 00:00:20,586
at the end, that would be great.

9
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:24,368
On behalf of all the speakers at GDC, we do take your feedback

10
00:00:24,388 --> 00:00:26,069
to heart, so thank you in advance for that.

11
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:26,990
We really appreciate it.

12
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:30,060
So with all that out of the way,

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,203
I should take a minute to introduce myself.

14
00:00:32,243 --> 00:00:33,244
My name is Amy Dallas.

15
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:35,607
I am one of the four co-founders of Clutch Play Games

16
00:00:35,647 --> 00:00:36,568
out of Portland, Oregon.

17
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:39,271
And I'm also on the board of directors of OGO,

18
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:41,273
which is the Oregon Games Organization.

19
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,275
So I gotta say, it's a really big honor to be here today

20
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,017
representing both Clutch Play and OGO

21
00:00:45,518 --> 00:00:47,940
on a subject that I think is becoming increasingly important

22
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,823
especially for indies in the mobile space.

23
00:00:52,107 --> 00:00:56,208
And that's this question of, how do we keep our businesses afloat given the volatility

24
00:00:56,508 --> 00:00:58,789
of the mobile games market at this point in time?

25
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,310
I don't think it's a big secret here when I say that it's becoming a lot harder to make

26
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,732
a living solely from game revenues as an indie developer.

27
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:08,632
At least it has been for the last couple of years.

28
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:10,953
So what do we do about that?

29
00:01:10,993 --> 00:01:11,893
What are our options?

30
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:15,935
So one option is we just say, screw it.

31
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:16,997
We know this is risky.

32
00:01:17,057 --> 00:01:18,058
We're just going to double down.

33
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:20,943
We're going to make as many games as possible, as efficiently as possible,

34
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:24,328
and hope that at least one or more of them is going to produce

35
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:25,590
enough revenue to keep us going.

36
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:26,491
That's an option.

37
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:27,072
We can do that.

38
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:31,304
Option two, we can look for more predictable ways

39
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:33,646
to bring in income, such as contracting.

40
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:35,447
We can just turn our back on all that risk

41
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,949
and just say, all right, we're gonna become a contract studio

42
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:39,250
and that's how we're gonna make our money.

43
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:42,513
Or option three is we do some combination of both.

44
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:44,915
We juggle the chainsaws and we find a way to make that work.

45
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:50,254
So I've got to say, I've been on both sides of this equation.

46
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:52,055
I've been on all sides of it, as a matter of fact.

47
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:54,677
And I don't think there are any right or wrong answers,

48
00:01:54,717 --> 00:01:55,878
to be perfectly honest.

49
00:01:56,018 --> 00:02:00,061
I think there are a lot of hard questions.

50
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:01,982
This is a hard question to answer.

51
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:05,544
And I don't think there are any right or wrong answers here.

52
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:08,426
What essentially this boils down to is a math problem.

53
00:02:13,495 --> 00:02:14,635
anxiety dry mouth here.

54
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:18,116
So essentially, this is a math problem.

55
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:20,317
And because it's a math problem, unfortunately for me,

56
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:22,297
that means I'm going to have to do some math in front

57
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:25,338
of a live studio audience, which is a little bit horrifying

58
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,738
for me, I'm going to be honest with you.

59
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:28,959
This is a little bit like one of those anxiety dreams,

60
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:30,839
like, oh my gosh, I'm back in high school

61
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,940
and I forgot to wear clothes.

62
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,860
How did this happen?

63
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,780
This is mortifying.

64
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,621
But I'm actually going to throw myself on that grenade

65
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:37,761
because I think it's really important.

66
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:43,203
So if nothing else, at least you can hopefully find some amusement in my discomfort. So there is that.

67
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:50,066
So anyway, so let's get started. To give you a little background on ClutchPlay,

68
00:02:51,026 --> 00:02:52,327
ClutchPlay was founded back in early 2012.

69
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:57,495
And like a lot of indies, we do divide our time pretty evenly

70
00:02:57,535 --> 00:02:59,676
between doing work for hire and developing our own titles.

71
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:01,858
So again, we're juggling the chainsaws there.

72
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,360
And in terms of our clients, we have

73
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,602
a lot of really cool clients we work with all over the country.

74
00:03:08,842 --> 00:03:10,823
Some of them are actually down here in San Francisco,

75
00:03:10,884 --> 00:03:11,524
in the Bay Area.

76
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:12,985
We've got KickSci, Telltale.

77
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:18,128
We work with Intel and a number of other really cool companies.

78
00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:20,628
It's been a really great experience

79
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:22,670
doing that kind of work.

80
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,971
And we've had a chance to work on a lot

81
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:24,911
of really great products.

82
00:03:26,092 --> 00:03:28,254
But our first love, of course, is doing our own games.

83
00:03:28,434 --> 00:03:29,955
And as far as our own games go, we

84
00:03:29,995 --> 00:03:32,297
have a couple that are out there and one in development.

85
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:34,538
Our first one is a game called Little Chomp.

86
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:36,079
And I'm going to talk about that in a couple minutes

87
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,541
in some detail, because I think it's

88
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:40,703
a great example of a critical success

89
00:03:40,843 --> 00:03:41,884
and a financial failure.

90
00:03:41,904 --> 00:03:43,525
So I'm going to look at that in a little more detail.

91
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,822
Our second game is a game called Skullduggery, and Skullduggery actually did pretty well.

92
00:03:48,882 --> 00:03:51,423
I've got to say, I'm not at all unhappy with how it did.

93
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:56,145
I think by a lot of indie standards, it would be considered a success, because it was a

94
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:58,506
really expensive game, and we did make our money back.

95
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:03,928
But I think that that's a big problem with a lot of indies, is that we often confuse

96
00:04:03,988 --> 00:04:08,270
breaking even with success, and from a business standpoint, that's just not the case.

97
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,712
If we're looking to be successful,

98
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,375
we're looking for at least a two to three time return

99
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:17,017
on investment for our games.

100
00:04:17,838 --> 00:04:20,100
So a break-even is not a great option,

101
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,861
but certainly given how expensive it was,

102
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:23,063
I can't complain about it.

103
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,745
So then we have another game that's coming out

104
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:30,209
in the next year, so we'll talk about that at another point.

105
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,753
So, I want to start off, pardon me.

106
00:04:36,535 --> 00:04:38,158
by talking a little bit about Little Chump,

107
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,122
because I think it's a really good case study,

108
00:04:40,182 --> 00:04:41,064
as I mentioned before,

109
00:04:42,307 --> 00:04:45,433
for what can happen when you don't have a success.

110
00:04:46,737 --> 00:04:49,598
So normally, I actually don't share specific information

111
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:50,438
about game revenues.

112
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:51,019
I just don't.

113
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:52,939
But in this case, I'm going to make an exception,

114
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,921
because so often in mobile, when a team shares information

115
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:57,962
about revenues, it's usually a success story.

116
00:04:58,422 --> 00:05:00,163
So it's really hard to gauge what

117
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:05,265
does a typical kind of failure look like.

118
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:06,726
So let's look at that.

119
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:08,867
So here we go.

120
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:10,147
We're going to do a little bit of math here.

121
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:12,856
So Little Chomp was our first game,

122
00:05:13,716 --> 00:05:15,597
and we wanted to keep our costs low.

123
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:17,578
So at the time, we were a team of four people.

124
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:21,779
So we tried to keep our development amongst the four of us.

125
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,201
So that was four people working for about 10 months,

126
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:27,562
so that comes out to 40 weeks,

127
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:29,843
working about 40 hours a week, usually more,

128
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:32,344
but for the sake of argument, let's just actually say 40.

129
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,085
So that comes out to about 1,600 hours.

130
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,386
40 hours a week times 40 weeks, 1,600 hours per developer.

131
00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:46,479
times four developers, that comes out to 6,400 hours total.

132
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:49,459
So that's not an insignificant amount of time.

133
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,480
So let's look at what that actually turned into

134
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,921
in terms of revenue.

135
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:59,042
So our total revenue for that 6,400 hours

136
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:00,422
turned out to be 10K.

137
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,523
So when you break that down, this is the sad math here.

138
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,163
When you break that down per partner,

139
00:06:06,263 --> 00:06:06,964
so that's $2,500 per person.

140
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:12,148
And when you divide that by 1600 hours,

141
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:15,230
the revenue comes out to about $1.56 per hour.

142
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:18,833
So just out of sheer perverse interest,

143
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:20,454
I actually did a Google search on

144
00:06:20,494 --> 00:06:22,036
what was minimum wage in Oregon in 2012?

145
00:06:22,436 --> 00:06:25,778
And as you can see, minimum wage was $8.80.

146
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:31,103
So unfortunately, we made $7.24 less than we would have

147
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:32,724
if we were working a minimum wage job.

148
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:38,328
So there's failure, and then there's poverty-level failure.

149
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:45,023
So given that most of us aren't in a position to live on poverty-level wages, that brings

150
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:48,706
us to the big question, you know, what do you do in those circumstances?

151
00:06:48,746 --> 00:06:53,190
And this is actually how we found ourselves going down the contracting route.

152
00:06:55,613 --> 00:07:01,218
So at a larger level, let's talk about why it's so hard to make a living on mobile right

153
00:07:01,258 --> 00:07:01,378
now.

154
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:08,994
So last year, I did a talk here at GDC called

155
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:11,217
Free-to-Play versus Premium, the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,

156
00:07:12,078 --> 00:07:13,980
where I looked at some of the pros and cons of both

157
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,681
free-to-play and premium.

158
00:07:16,262 --> 00:07:18,124
And I think some of those conversation points

159
00:07:18,164 --> 00:07:19,445
are really relevant here today.

160
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,588
Let's talk about premium first.

161
00:07:23,654 --> 00:07:26,275
So I think there are a lot of people who think that premium is dead.

162
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:27,536
It's just not a good model.

163
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:30,077
It's being choked to death by free to play.

164
00:07:30,578 --> 00:07:32,579
And I understand where everybody's coming from.

165
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:36,901
I actually think that premium is really a viable option for a lot of Indies.

166
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:40,283
Um, as I said, we did reasonably well with that on skullduggery.

167
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:44,073
But there are some obvious downsides.

168
00:07:44,474 --> 00:07:46,255
It's an inherently smaller market.

169
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:50,038
And as an industry, we've kind of trained our players

170
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,800
to not want to pay us for the entertainment

171
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,361
that we make for them up front.

172
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:55,323
And there are so many free-to-play options,

173
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:58,506
most people feel like they don't have to pay up front

174
00:07:58,526 --> 00:08:00,528
for something when they can just get something else for free.

175
00:08:00,588 --> 00:08:02,650
So there's inherently a smaller number of people

176
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,751
who are willing to do that.

177
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:07,185
And then there's the fact that there's also

178
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:10,289
a smaller potential of revenue.

179
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:12,572
So one of the great things about free-to-play

180
00:08:12,852 --> 00:08:14,754
is over the lifespan of your game,

181
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,698
you have the potential to make tens, hundreds, thousands

182
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:20,781
of dollars off a single player over the span of your game.

183
00:08:21,883 --> 00:08:23,364
With premium, not so much.

184
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:27,307
So of the people who are willing to spend money on premium,

185
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:29,909
generally they do so because they like the fact

186
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:31,931
that they've paid once and you're not bugging them

187
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:33,492
constantly to give them more money.

188
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:36,875
So if you're charging, for example, $5 for a game,

189
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:40,358
then your ability to make money is limited

190
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:42,100
by the number of people who will actually give you $5.

191
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:47,539
Another challenge of premium is that the long tail is really not so long.

192
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:52,285
So if you think of premium like a Hollywood movie, that's I think a very good analogy.

193
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:58,352
In Hollywood I think they often consider success a great opening weekend because they understand

194
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:00,195
that after the hype of that opening weekend.

195
00:09:01,104 --> 00:09:05,206
the sales are going to taper off. So if you don't come out of the gate pretty strong with

196
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:09,547
premium, it's very unlikely that you're going to have some huge spike of sales later on.

197
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:14,029
It's possible, but not too likely. And it usually coincides with you releasing more

198
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:18,490
content, which is expensive. So you may make more money, but you obviously have to spend

199
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,672
more money to get it. And then, of course, there's the issue of piracy. So piracy...

200
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:27,396
is a big problem, obviously, in premium.

201
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:29,359
For our first game, Little Chomp,

202
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:31,561
we ran some numbers last year, and we

203
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:35,827
found that for every one person who would pay us $1,

204
00:09:36,027 --> 00:09:38,390
over 150 people would just pirate the game.

205
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:42,512
And so you'd think, OK, well, iOS, that's

206
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:43,213
going to be a lot better.

207
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,055
It's a closed system, much harder to pirate.

208
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:48,640
And yet we found on Skullduggery that at least a third

209
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,562
of our players that were playing the game

210
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:52,664
were actually also pirating.

211
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:56,329
So at $5 a copy, that's a pretty significant loss.

212
00:09:58,273 --> 00:09:59,734
So that certainly makes free-to-play

213
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:01,074
a lot more attractive, right?

214
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:03,675
Everybody's heard all the great things about free-to-play.

215
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:07,316
But the reality of free-to-play is that it's a market

216
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:09,717
dominated by large companies with deep pockets.

217
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:15,459
So in my talk last year, I cited a research paper

218
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:17,559
that was actually done by a company called Midia.

219
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,801
And in it, they looked at 700 apps on the App Store,

220
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:24,181
top grossing on App Store and Google Play.

221
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:28,008
And of those 700 apps, they found that 81%

222
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:30,088
were produced by the same 50 companies.

223
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:34,389
And this graphic is actually a perfect representation

224
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:36,550
of the fact that this is still happening.

225
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,491
So on the left, you have App Store Top Grossing

226
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:40,551
from March of last year.

227
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:43,112
And on the right, you have App Store Top Grossing

228
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:44,212
for March of this year.

229
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:46,672
As you can see, it's mostly the same titles,

230
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,633
or it's different titles by the same companies.

231
00:10:48,853 --> 00:10:50,353
So clearly, that is still the case.

232
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:55,652
So some other challenges that indies have in mobile

233
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:57,553
is obviously discoverability.

234
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:00,936
We're all competing for the same set of eyeballs,

235
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:02,397
but we don't have the deep pockets

236
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:03,678
that larger companies have.

237
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,500
And success is often dependent on factors

238
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,322
that are completely outside of our control.

239
00:11:09,062 --> 00:11:11,124
And I do a lot of work with other indie studios,

240
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,307
and there's one example recently of some people I know

241
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:15,508
who did an amazing job.

242
00:11:15,548 --> 00:11:16,589
They made a really great game.

243
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:19,031
It was really quirky and funny and weird.

244
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:21,853
and they got some amazing press.

245
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:23,214
It really captured the imagination,

246
00:11:23,254 --> 00:11:25,756
not only of the games press, but of the mainstream press.

247
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:28,017
And yet, unfortunately, that didn't actually

248
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:29,738
translate to dollars.

249
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,640
So you can do everything right,

250
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,182
and things may still not quite work out for you.

251
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:36,744
So where does that leave us?

252
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:39,866
We've just spent a lot of time talking about

253
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:42,188
how risky it is as a studio to put all your eggs

254
00:11:42,288 --> 00:11:44,029
in the original IP basket.

255
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,551
So as indies, how do we get out in front of that?

256
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:47,111
What do we do?

257
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,482
And I've got to say, the only way that I know how to get out in front of that is with quantifiable data.

258
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,653
And that means we have to start asking ourselves some pretty hard questions.

259
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:02,933
So I think most of these are pretty self-explanatory,

260
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:04,713
but to just kind of spin through these,

261
00:12:05,713 --> 00:12:07,774
you need to figure out how much you need as an individual

262
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,774
to keep going in your indie studio,

263
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:13,875
how much your other employees need or co-founders.

264
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,635
So what are the overall company financial needs?

265
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:18,856
How much money do you need to actually complete

266
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:20,056
the product that you want to make?

267
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:22,917
How much potential is there once you've completed it

268
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:23,877
in terms of sales?

269
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,197
Like, how big is your market?

270
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:28,239
And then of course, how much money is available

271
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:30,641
that I have right now to actually make the game

272
00:12:30,661 --> 00:12:31,402
that I wanna make?

273
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:40,690
So as you start to answer all these questions,

274
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:42,192
it begins to form a picture

275
00:12:44,093 --> 00:12:46,195
that essentially turns into a projected P&L.

276
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:49,504
And this is a profit and loss statement, of course.

277
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:50,844
I'm sure most of you know what that is.

278
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,485
And that's going to allow you to track how much money you're

279
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:56,086
actually making or losing at any given time on any of your

280
00:12:56,146 --> 00:12:56,627
projects.

281
00:12:57,927 --> 00:13:00,268
And this is a really critical step to understanding your

282
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:02,769
ability to become or remain profitable as a company.

283
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:05,611
But it's kind of amazing to me how many indies don't

284
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:06,491
actually do that.

285
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:07,631
They just gloss right over this.

286
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:12,118
So I want to talk a little bit about Indie Budgeting 101.

287
00:13:13,238 --> 00:13:15,439
One of the big fallacies of Indie Budgeting

288
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:19,880
is that budgets consist almost entirely of external costs.

289
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:22,902
So I've had this conversation about 12 times

290
00:13:22,922 --> 00:13:25,062
since I've been here at GDC, and I haven't even

291
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:27,403
been here that long, asking people, well,

292
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,063
what are your budgets?

293
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,924
And they're like, well, my engineers cost this,

294
00:13:30,985 --> 00:13:32,065
or my artists cost that.

295
00:13:32,205 --> 00:13:34,086
And that's the extent of what they think their budget is.

296
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:36,386
And it's very much the opposite of that.

297
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:41,540
So if there's nothing you take away from this talk,

298
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,821
let it be this.

299
00:13:43,341 --> 00:13:45,502
The bulk of your internal dev costs,

300
00:13:45,902 --> 00:13:48,044
that is essentially most of your budget.

301
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,405
Which means you have to figure out what

302
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:51,626
your time is actually worth.

303
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,527
That's a really big issue.

304
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:58,529
So again, I do a lot of mentoring with indie studios.

305
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:00,750
And I get asked a lot, well, how do you figure out

306
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:03,232
what your baseline indie hourly rate should be?

307
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:06,634
And there's a couple of ways that you can go about this.

308
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:09,616
You can actually go to the low end and ask yourself,

309
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:11,417
OK, well, what is the minimum amount

310
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:13,218
we need to get by to pay ourselves

311
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:16,219
for the duration of the project, or for a given year?

312
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,400
And then you plug that number in your budget,

313
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,220
and you say, OK, well, that's my budget

314
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,221
plus whatever external costs I have.

315
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:27,923
But that's not necessarily the best indicator, because again,

316
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:29,864
you're kind of living in that world of the lowest

317
00:14:29,884 --> 00:14:30,764
common denominator.

318
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:32,385
What is the minimum amount I can get?

319
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,146
So there are other ways you can look at this.

320
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:39,611
A different way you can cut it is looking at the top end.

321
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:41,233
How much money can I potentially make,

322
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:42,814
given my skills and experience?

323
00:14:42,854 --> 00:14:45,878
So in other words, if I decide to give up my indie dreams

324
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,441
and go back to being a producer at EA, which I once was,

325
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:50,303
I know how much I can make doing that.

326
00:14:50,363 --> 00:14:51,905
It's probably at least a six-figure,

327
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,088
well, it's definitely at least a six-figure job.

328
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:57,110
So if I know I can make six figures elsewhere,

329
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:01,813
I can say, well, OK, then my potential worth is $100,000.

330
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:05,635
So my budget is my time plus everybody else's time

331
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:08,657
plus external costs at a rate of $100,000 per year.

332
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:10,919
So the problem there is that it's going

333
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:12,440
to make your budget look enormous.

334
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,321
It's going to make it look like you can't

335
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:16,402
afford to make your own game.

336
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:20,625
So there's a third option, and that is taking that high end.

337
00:15:20,765 --> 00:15:22,186
Here's how much I'm able to make.

338
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:25,908
and subtracting the amount that you're willing to invest

339
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:29,251
for doing something you love with a potential upside.

340
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:33,234
So for example, if I can make $100,000 at EA,

341
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:37,997
and I maybe need $50,000 to live as an indie,

342
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:42,981
the middle ground maybe is my rate is $75,000,

343
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:46,143
because there's $25,000 worth of value

344
00:15:46,764 --> 00:15:49,065
in actually being able to do the kind of work I love

345
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:51,267
and make a game that potentially could make

346
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:52,088
some additional money.

347
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:57,479
So once you've figured all that out, your value,

348
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,381
as an indie studio, and you've figured out your budget,

349
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:02,241
what then?

350
00:16:03,502 --> 00:16:05,543
What happens if you figure out, OK, well, I

351
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,884
know how much money I need, but I don't have that?

352
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:09,325
What do I do?

353
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:13,612
So there are a couple of options.

354
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,814
Looking for investment is one.

355
00:16:16,214 --> 00:16:19,998
That can take the form of either an angel investor,

356
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:22,339
a family member, crowdfunding.

357
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,601
All of these things are options.

358
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:25,582
You can look for a publisher.

359
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:27,724
But I gotta say, options one and two

360
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:29,245
are a little thin on the ground at the moment.

361
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:30,827
If you're looking for an actual company

362
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:32,528
to invest in you or a publisher,

363
00:16:32,668 --> 00:16:33,989
right now, given the state of mobile,

364
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:35,771
as we just talked about, it's a little bit up and down.

365
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:38,253
So there's a lot less of those opportunities.

366
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:42,815
So a really good option, as I mentioned and has been for us, is doing work for hire.

367
00:16:45,456 --> 00:16:47,916
So let's talk about the benefits of work for hire.

368
00:16:47,976 --> 00:16:50,497
And I'm not necessarily talking about individual work for hire.

369
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:56,159
I'm talking about hiring out your entire studio as a development team to work with an external company.

370
00:16:57,421 --> 00:17:00,767
So a lot of the good things about that is it's a predictable source of income.

371
00:17:00,807 --> 00:17:04,233
Unless something goes horribly wrong, you're going to get paid regardless of whether or

372
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:09,842
not the project is a huge success because you're working on an hourly basis or per project

373
00:17:09,882 --> 00:17:10,243
basis.

374
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:14,925
Another benefit is you have the potential to pay yourself what you're actually worth,

375
00:17:15,186 --> 00:17:18,188
so you can go on the high end of your scale.

376
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:22,392
Generally speaking, in our case, we do tend to pay ourselves more when we're doing work

377
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:26,255
for hire because we're not doing the kind of work that we do necessarily want to do

378
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:26,835
all the time.

379
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:29,998
So again, we're removing that value.

380
00:17:32,838 --> 00:17:33,699
of that middle step.

381
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:36,460
So there's also learning opportunities

382
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,302
and a lot of opportunities for growth as a company.

383
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:42,423
So on a lot of the projects that we've worked on,

384
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:44,024
we've learned things that have helped us

385
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,965
in our own development, so that's actually

386
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:47,666
been incredibly valuable to us.

387
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:50,307
And it's also allowed us to grow as a company,

388
00:17:50,668 --> 00:17:52,328
bring on more people, and of course,

389
00:17:52,348 --> 00:17:54,550
as you bring on more people, that means more profit,

390
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,711
and it enables you to put more money away

391
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,171
towards doing your own development.

392
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:01,348
We started late, so I'm about to get the hook here.

393
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:05,930
So the downsides of work for hire is, obviously, it's less

394
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,770
creative control.

395
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,531
You've got a lower ceiling of return.

396
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:10,491
You're going to make the money that you were promised, but

397
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:12,032
you're not going to necessarily make a huge

398
00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:13,933
amount more, because it's not your project.

399
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,094
And it actually might take more money than you realize.

400
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:19,855
So let's run some numbers.

401
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,936
Let's say our team of four does want to make $100,000

402
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,257
because we're doing contract work.

403
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:27,717
So I actually had this argument with someone on my

404
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:28,798
team not too long ago.

405
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:32,749
He was saying, well, OK, well, all we need to do

406
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:36,172
is make, if we want to pay ourselves $100,000,

407
00:18:36,552 --> 00:18:39,914
there's four of us, let's just make $400,000 in contract work

408
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:40,594
and we're good.

409
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:41,835
So that makes sense.

410
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:43,817
Except it's not that simple.

411
00:18:44,697 --> 00:18:47,959
Because there are other factors to be factored in.

412
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:49,340
So you've got payroll taxes.

413
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,081
As you can see, that's about 10%.

414
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:52,882
You've got benefits, that's another 10%.

415
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:54,223
So tack on 20% to your $400,000, that puts you up to $500.

416
00:18:58,372 --> 00:18:59,492
And there's actually even more.

417
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:00,572
So generally speaking,

418
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:02,073
you've got a lot of business expenses.

419
00:19:02,093 --> 00:19:04,614
You've got contract labor, legal, marketing.

420
00:19:05,054 --> 00:19:07,034
In some cases, when you're actually doing work for hire,

421
00:19:07,054 --> 00:19:08,395
you might have corporate insurance

422
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:09,395
that you have to pay for,

423
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:11,076
like errors and omission insurance.

424
00:19:11,836 --> 00:19:12,716
So all of these things,

425
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,677
there's a whole bunch of costs associated with that

426
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:16,938
that you have to actually add on top of that.

427
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:19,354
And then you also have taxes.

428
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:22,155
So to pay yourself a salary of $100,000,

429
00:19:22,235 --> 00:19:25,816
you're really looking at having to make almost double that,

430
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,456
maybe a little more than that.

431
00:19:28,076 --> 00:19:30,417
So obviously, that is a big factor.

432
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:33,718
Pardon me.

433
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,539
So where does that leave us?

434
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,221
So I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen this.

435
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:45,281
It's Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.

436
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:50,961
It was put out there by Abraham Maslow in a paper in the 1940s called The Theory of

437
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:51,981
Human Motivation.

438
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:57,803
And in it, he establishes that as human beings, we all have these essential needs.

439
00:19:59,044 --> 00:20:03,566
And at the bottom, we have our foundational needs of physiological, which is food, water,

440
00:20:03,606 --> 00:20:06,867
shelter, breathing, everything it takes to just stay alive.

441
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:09,868
And then on top of that, we have safety and security.

442
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,229
So do we actually feel safe enough to...

443
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:17,289
be creative, for example.

444
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:18,949
It's hard to be creative when you're afraid

445
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:20,650
that you're going to lose your home

446
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,531
or not have enough food to eat.

447
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:25,752
So the idea here is that you have to actually meet

448
00:20:25,872 --> 00:20:28,153
all of your needs at these lower levels of the pyramid

449
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:29,774
in order to achieve the higher levels

450
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:31,935
such as creativity and self-actualization.

451
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:34,436
And fear of not meeting those basic needs

452
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:36,337
can actually really hamper your creativity.

453
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,058
So again, this goes back to the question of

454
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:40,558
how do we ensure our basic needs are met

455
00:20:40,598 --> 00:20:41,899
while still doing the work we love?

456
00:20:44,136 --> 00:20:46,719
And do we contract or do we not?

457
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,903
And I think in our case, we've decided to do both.

458
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:51,245
And it's worked out really well for us.

459
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:53,788
So I probably don't have a lot of time.

460
00:20:53,848 --> 00:20:54,869
Does anybody have any questions?

461
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:55,750
I can maybe take one.

462
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,713
Go for it.

463
00:21:03,672 --> 00:21:03,872
Hey.

464
00:21:05,093 --> 00:21:05,553
I think so.

465
00:21:05,593 --> 00:21:05,713
OK.

466
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:08,816
We've been doing Work for Hire and original SAP,

467
00:21:09,096 --> 00:21:11,478
oh, there we go, for quite a while.

468
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:13,879
I wanted to know if you have any suggestions.

469
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,481
Like, we've been doing Work for Hire and freelancing websites.

470
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:21,185
And they tend to be really small or only for a program

471
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:22,086
or two programmers.

472
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,989
And we haven't had a chance to get the whole studio working

473
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:26,749
in Work for Hire.

474
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:29,892
Do you have any suggestions how you can make that transition?

475
00:21:31,744 --> 00:21:32,145
sort of thing?

476
00:21:32,245 --> 00:21:33,666
Yeah, no, that's a good question.

477
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:38,791
Well, it sort of depends on what your pipeline is for sales.

478
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:41,834
We specifically go after jobs that we know are larger

479
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,557
because we don't want to piecemeal our team out.

480
00:21:44,577 --> 00:21:45,979
And that's one of the biggest challenges

481
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,680
of actually being a work-for-hire team

482
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:50,263
is that we want to keep our team all together

483
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:52,145
because you do run the risk of,

484
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:54,427
if you have a few people hired out here and there,

485
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:57,510
then your team isn't really your team anymore.

486
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,331
It's just a stable of contractors

487
00:21:59,371 --> 00:22:02,614
that you're sort of hiring out.

488
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:06,457
And so it's really going after the size of jobs.

489
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:08,398
You said you're doing actually web development

490
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,279
or game development?

491
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,160
No, no, mobile development.

492
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,321
No, no, games, games.

493
00:22:11,341 --> 00:22:11,761
Games, okay.

494
00:22:11,781 --> 00:22:12,161
Mobile games.

495
00:22:12,662 --> 00:22:14,944
But we use like Upwork and Freelancer

496
00:22:14,984 --> 00:22:16,405
and there's only like smaller jobs.

497
00:22:16,525 --> 00:22:16,745
Yeah.

498
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:47,085
Yeah, I think that's actually not always a good way to get contract work. You really want to get into larger companies and find the people who are actually doing outsourcing and put together a pitch deck with all of your information, all the information about your team, what you can do as a team, what your team capabilities are. And there are a lot of companies right now looking for really good outsourcing. So that is really the way to get your whole team together is pitch yourself as a team to companies directly.

499
00:22:47,945 --> 00:22:49,626
Okay, can you tell me the company's after?

500
00:22:50,026 --> 00:22:50,766
What was that?

501
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,306
Can you tell me some of the company's after?

502
00:22:53,347 --> 00:22:55,327
We'll talk, I'll give you my card.

503
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:56,787
Any other questions?

504
00:23:01,668 --> 00:23:02,988
When you're doing work for hire,

505
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,549
what kind of margins do you shoot for?

506
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:07,909
Like what do you decide is worth your time and what isn't?

507
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,170
Oh, that's a really good question.

508
00:23:14,437 --> 00:23:17,578
Like I said, we do tend to go towards the higher end of our scale.

509
00:23:17,658 --> 00:23:21,559
So we have a scale that we pay ourselves or we budget ourselves for when we're doing work

510
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,020
for hire.

511
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,620
That's on the lower end.

512
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,782
On the higher end, we do want to take on jobs that will allow us not only to pay ourselves

513
00:23:29,362 --> 00:23:32,143
at a pretty high rate, but also put some money aside.

514
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:38,586
So at a minimum, 30% is the minimum and going up from there.

515
00:23:39,482 --> 00:23:42,903
And what kind of domains are you working in? Is it always in

516
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:47,084
games or do you do like banks or marketing?

517
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:50,285
Yeah, we do a little bit of both. We do primarily work in

518
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:53,486
games. We have done some app development as well. And in some

519
00:23:53,506 --> 00:23:56,687
cases we've done marketing and things of that nature, some PR.

520
00:23:56,847 --> 00:24:00,308
It's really ‑‑ it depends on what's going on. Obviously with

521
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:01,288
your sales cycle.

522
00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:03,909
You want to make sure that everybody is working.

523
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:06,570
So if maybe you see somebody is, you know,

524
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,371
not everybody is working at the same rate

525
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,932
all the time on all projects.

526
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:12,553
So for example, if there's somebody on the team

527
00:24:13,093 --> 00:24:15,754
who is not as busy and they can actually pick up

528
00:24:15,794 --> 00:24:18,855
a small project, then we would actually put them

529
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:20,896
on a smaller project for a short period of time.

530
00:24:21,496 --> 00:24:26,038
One other thing I want to mention about Work4Hire is that when you're figuring out what your

531
00:24:26,058 --> 00:24:29,279
costs are in Work4Hire, what you're going to charge, it really depends on the kind of

532
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,660
work that you're actually doing.

533
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,262
So for example, we do everything from creative development from scratch to firefighting.

534
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:41,944
And short-term firefighting is always going to be our highest rate because it's intense,

535
00:24:42,004 --> 00:24:44,485
you have to run in, hit the ground running really fast.

536
00:24:45,385 --> 00:24:50,107
and it's usually short term, so if there's a heavy ramp,

537
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,928
it requires a high skill set,

538
00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:53,568
and it's a short duration of time,

539
00:24:53,588 --> 00:24:56,369
you're going to want to get as much from that as you can.

540
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,930
If it's a longer project that's creative

541
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,371
and it has a really long runway,

542
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:02,352
you can actually afford to charge a little bit less.

543
00:25:03,412 --> 00:25:05,153
So we sort of scale that way as well.

544
00:25:05,653 --> 00:25:07,814
And does that require full-time biz dev,

545
00:25:08,234 --> 00:25:09,574
like a full-time biz dev person,

546
00:25:09,654 --> 00:25:12,115
or do you have a network where work sort of comes to you?

547
00:25:12,957 --> 00:25:14,058
A little bit of both.

548
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:16,480
So I am the full-time dev, biz dev person,

549
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,322
but I'm full-time, I say that kind of somewhat tongue

550
00:25:20,342 --> 00:25:23,164
in cheek because I also do work along with the team.

551
00:25:23,884 --> 00:25:27,106
So really I think one of the best things to do when you're,

552
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:28,687
one of the best ways to get work,

553
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:30,588
once you actually get in and start working

554
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:34,351
with larger companies and people see that you do good work,

555
00:25:35,312 --> 00:25:39,876
As we all know, we move around a lot in the games industry. We found one of the ways we've

556
00:25:39,896 --> 00:25:44,380
gotten repeat clients is as people we've worked with have gone to other companies, they will

557
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:49,924
call us and say those guys are great, bring them in. So really your own good work is the best

558
00:25:49,984 --> 00:25:55,428
way to put your name out there and market yourself. That's been our experience. I do a lot

559
00:25:55,468 --> 00:26:00,812
of biz dev. My plate is full here at GDC doing just that. If you're looking to do biz dev,

560
00:26:01,253 --> 00:26:02,814
you're at the right place. Certainly.

561
00:26:04,874 --> 00:26:10,070
Yeah, thank you. Anything else? I think we're good. I'm getting the hook. All right. Thanks,

562
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:10,591
you guys. Appreciate it.

563
00:26:10,631 --> 00:26:10,832
Thank you. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
