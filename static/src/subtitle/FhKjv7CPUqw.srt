1
00:00:02,424 --> 00:00:06,267
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:06,287 --> 00:00:06,327
Hi.

3
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:08,650
So this is a narrative approach to level design.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,472
I just have a quick sound check.

5
00:00:15,597 --> 00:00:16,197
All right, good.

6
00:00:16,578 --> 00:00:17,298
Now we know our levels.

7
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:18,099
Anyway.

8
00:00:20,656 --> 00:00:22,216
So this is a narrative approach to level design.

9
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:24,837
Oh, quick reminder, cell phones off,

10
00:00:25,237 --> 00:00:30,158
do your surveys, high five your CAs, et cetera.

11
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:32,519
Anyway, narrative approach to level design.

12
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:34,699
Has narrative been the title?

13
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:37,100
It's definitely a level design talk, I promise.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,521
This is still a design talk, but.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,761
The reason I'm doing a narrative-focused one is because

16
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:49,003
levels and level design are how the player is experiencing and interacting with the game world.

17
00:00:50,644 --> 00:00:54,105
It's up to the level designer to decide how a story unfolds to the player.

18
00:00:54,685 --> 00:00:56,926
And if you've been to any of the level design talks today, you know that...

19
00:00:57,987 --> 00:00:59,947
if narrative is a big part of your game,

20
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:02,008
it needs to be a big part of your level design.

21
00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:04,789
So, I will introduce myself.

22
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:06,309
I am Jumalee Menzel,

23
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,810
and this is the kind of stuff I was concerned with

24
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,211
when I joined the industry at Telltale Games,

25
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,952
where stories are hand-authored experiences

26
00:01:15,012 --> 00:01:16,173
that the player experiences

27
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:17,473
as they move through the Telltale Games.

28
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:19,374
So, as a level designer

29
00:01:19,574 --> 00:01:22,215
or the Telltale term cinematic artist there,

30
00:01:22,235 --> 00:01:25,576
I was really a big part of how those stories

31
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:26,596
were being shown to the player.

32
00:01:28,077 --> 00:01:31,541
Right now I work at Ubisoft.

33
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:35,285
This is actually my office in Watch Dogs.

34
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:40,810
But I don't work on Watch Dogs 2, I actually work on the new South Park game, South Park

35
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,711
the Fractured But Whole.

36
00:01:42,592 --> 00:01:43,433
And my current...

37
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:45,195
Yeah, you have to think about the title.

38
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:49,440
In my current role there, I am a level designer,

39
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,081
but I'm also a narrative designer

40
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:54,523
because our levels and our missions and our combat

41
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:56,584
are so closely linked to the story

42
00:01:56,604 --> 00:01:59,345
that it's really a big part of my job

43
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,366
to make sure that that story gets across to the player.

44
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:05,068
So similar to my role at Telltale on South Park.

45
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:08,932
Our games are coming from the story, they're coming from the scripts,

46
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:11,796
and they're coming from the IP that we're trying to show the player.

47
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:17,283
Everything in The Fractured But Whole needs to feel like a South Park episode,

48
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:20,507
and the player should feel like they're playing through a South Park episode.

49
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:23,010
This is an actual photo of me at work.

50
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:32,619
What I mean is I'm always looking at the game narrative to understand how our missions and

51
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:33,720
our levels are going to flow.

52
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,784
And the nice thing about that is that even as things change, we have this strong vision

53
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:41,607
of the IP and the story that's been established from the beginning.

54
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:43,448
that continues to shape the game.

55
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:46,810
So even as iteration happens and surprise,

56
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,330
things change during game development,

57
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:51,392
we still have this kind of pillar of the IP

58
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:52,413
in the story to look at.

59
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:54,654
It makes us very nimble, which is important

60
00:02:54,694 --> 00:02:55,814
on something like South Park,

61
00:02:55,854 --> 00:02:58,015
which is inherently a nimble, reactive IP.

62
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:02,498
So that is a narrative approach to level design.

63
00:03:02,518 --> 00:03:05,799
In summary, it's really using the story

64
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,320
as the true vision for your gameplay.

65
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,911
And that means treating games as a storytelling medium.

66
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:13,412
So gameplay and storytelling are one and the same.

67
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:16,373
Meaning your game events are story events,

68
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:18,334
your story beats are gameplay beats.

69
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:21,556
And it means examining the story through themes

70
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:23,917
and expressing them through game design.

71
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:26,518
It's the kind of process we would use at Telltale,

72
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:29,079
taking comic book properties like The Walking Dead

73
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:30,980
and Fables and turning them into...

74
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:32,781
The Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us.

75
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:35,743
It's how we took an action game like Borderlands

76
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:36,964
and turned it into an adventure game.

77
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:40,366
And it's how we're taking 20 seasons of content

78
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:44,089
and developing them into an RPG that feels like South Park.

79
00:03:46,605 --> 00:03:52,851
In summary, this is really just how do I make this game, level, mission, combat, etc. feel like blah.

80
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:59,657
So obviously it has a lot of application to IP games, but it also has application to someone who's creating a new IP.

81
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:02,220
And where that comes in is when you have...

82
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,502
an original IP, but you might have a mood board or things that you're inspired by,

83
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:10,483
it helps you analyze those inspirations

84
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:14,725
and capture their essence in your design. So, for instance,

85
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:19,006
Uncharted 2 nods a lot to Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark

86
00:04:19,546 --> 00:04:21,107
with a lot of its shots and gameplay.

87
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:26,789
It also leans to the Lost World, Jurassic Park, and Mission Impossible.

88
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:31,409
and James Bontemar no guys, and Rodel Dorado.

89
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:35,536
But you know, it's still its own IP,

90
00:04:35,637 --> 00:04:38,342
but you can see when you analyze these things side by side,

91
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,404
you see the inspirations.

92
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,821
So, the beginning of this kind of analyzation is really just asking,

93
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:48,022
what makes up your narrative?

94
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:52,765
That can be summarized pretty easily with the age-old six question words,

95
00:04:52,805 --> 00:04:55,066
your why, who, where, what, when, and how.

96
00:04:56,126 --> 00:04:58,708
So I'm going to break these down into what they mean for the story,

97
00:04:58,728 --> 00:05:01,109
and then we're going to break them down into what they mean for gameplay.

98
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:01,969
So...

99
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,692
From a story perspective, our Y here represents our theme.

100
00:05:06,793 --> 00:05:09,855
And this is the purpose of the thing that you're making.

101
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,577
It's the message you're trying to get to the viewer, player,

102
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:16,140
experiencer, whatever they're calling VR now, et cetera.

103
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,182
Your who is your characters.

104
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:20,603
And often, your characters are going

105
00:05:20,623 --> 00:05:22,164
to embody some part of your theme.

106
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:24,866
They're the vessels by which you're telling the story.

107
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:28,569
There's the setting, so when and where it's happening.

108
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:32,092
The what, which is your plot and events.

109
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:34,213
So this is when we start getting down

110
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:36,654
into the beat by beat progression

111
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:38,175
of the actual story you're telling.

112
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:43,018
When is the time of events relative to each other?

113
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,860
So it's how those things from our plot and events

114
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,381
are what are structured and paced next to each other.

115
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:51,363
And then how is our presentation?

116
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:53,805
So how are you telling the story?

117
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:59,108
How are you showing these characters, these settings, these plots, these time of events

118
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:01,409
to support your theme?

119
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,350
So it kind of is...

120
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,911
It's not really a linear list.

121
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:07,433
It's really a cyclical list, always going back to that theme and that feeling.

122
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:09,755
That might be really confusing.

123
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:15,318
So I'm going to go into an example using a movie you might have guessed that I like a

124
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:15,558
lot.

125
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:17,780
It's Die Hard.

126
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:22,003
So let's analyze Die Hard, let's pretend we're going to make a Die Hard game.

127
00:06:22,023 --> 00:06:23,925
Because who doesn't want to make a Die Hard game?

128
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:29,910
So, we have our six questions, we have our themes.

129
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,413
Above all, Die Hard is about masculinity, it's an 80s movie, of course.

130
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:39,077
And that's expressed by the following your gut instincts of McLean,

131
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:42,961
and also love, he's very motivated by the love of his wife.

132
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:46,403
And then there's some minor themes like greed, and duty, and humility.

133
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:52,139
We have characters, McClane, Hans Gruber the villain, Holly McClane's wife,

134
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,624
those guys embody the themes that we just went over.

135
00:06:57,393 --> 00:07:00,095
Let me dig into our ware. It's the 80s.

136
00:07:00,455 --> 00:07:04,277
It's Los Angeles, specifically this fictional building, Nakatomi Plaza,

137
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,559
which has unfinished floors, these elevator shafts.

138
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:10,681
It's not done being built, but there's still these opulent boardrooms.

139
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:11,941
There's a roof and a helipad.

140
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:17,184
And the important thing about our ware here is the details, of course,

141
00:07:17,284 --> 00:07:20,206
but also the feelings that...

142
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:23,028
those spaces create.

143
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,689
So there's a lot of verticality,

144
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:27,392
it creates feelings of vertigo, of claustrophobia.

145
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:29,133
They make McLean feel very isolated

146
00:07:29,153 --> 00:07:30,454
while he's running from the terrorists.

147
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:33,417
It's also Christmas, yay.

148
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:35,119
Which is actually important to the theme,

149
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:36,800
like the theme is about love and family

150
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,342
and Christmas plays a part in that.

151
00:07:40,464 --> 00:07:40,804
So, our, what?

152
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:47,100
is this is where we actually start digging into the plot,

153
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,220
the events of the movie.

154
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,821
So after coming to LA to patch things up with his wife,

155
00:07:50,881 --> 00:07:54,522
McLean attempts to save her and her co-workers

156
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:56,483
at the Nakatomi Plaza that were taken hostage

157
00:07:56,503 --> 00:07:57,783
by a group of German terrorists.

158
00:07:58,383 --> 00:08:00,784
That's what happens in the game, or in the movie, rather.

159
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:07,532
And then we get into this when, and remember when is how that plot I just described is

160
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:08,233
actually told.

161
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:14,377
So analyzing that it's a linear storyline, so those events happen in chronological order.

162
00:08:14,717 --> 00:08:18,360
This isn't memento, it's not going backwards, it's linear in chronological order.

163
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,891
There's also parallel storytelling.

164
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:22,932
And what I mean by that is we're cutting

165
00:08:22,992 --> 00:08:24,432
between those characters.

166
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:27,373
We're looking at a little bit of what McLean's doing

167
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:29,113
versus what a little bit of the terrorists are doing.

168
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:32,474
And then those moments,

169
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:35,334
we're seeing slow, suspenseful moments.

170
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:38,675
And they quickly ramp into and back out of action.

171
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:41,575
So you can see kind of this cadence of those events

172
00:08:41,615 --> 00:08:44,236
that happen in those linear and parallel storylines.

173
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,149
And then the How, which is a big one.

174
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:49,472
Lots of suspense, it's a thriller.

175
00:08:50,753 --> 00:08:52,615
Lots of action scenes when they do ramp into them.

176
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:56,238
And then it's kind of subset by these

177
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,580
irreverent moments of humor from McLean.

178
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,283
So he has his one-liners, he makes little jokes,

179
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:04,366
he kind of questions the whole conceit of the thing

180
00:09:04,566 --> 00:09:06,408
as he's moving through this crazy building.

181
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:07,969
And then the other thing is it's

182
00:09:07,989 --> 00:09:09,231
an omnidifferent point of view.

183
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,355
What that means is we as the viewer know what every character is doing,

184
00:09:13,516 --> 00:09:18,021
even if McLean and Hans, the villain, do not know what each other is doing.

185
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:22,026
The drama is coming from us watching those two characters discover what's happening.

186
00:09:23,801 --> 00:09:26,783
So that was, so we defined all that about Die Hard.

187
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:30,825
And so we have our six question words

188
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:33,927
and we have the six story things that those complement.

189
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:38,630
So what I do from here is that I separate our top three

190
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,811
into story constants.

191
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,752
So these are things that are just a part

192
00:09:42,772 --> 00:09:43,713
of your story inherently.

193
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:49,146
And then the bottom three are what I call the game variables.

194
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:51,809
So as we start digging into how to make this a game,

195
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:55,094
we kind of already have these top three things defined.

196
00:09:57,548 --> 00:09:59,549
When you have something like Walking Dead or Wolf Among Us,

197
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:01,610
where you are adding in characters to existing IP,

198
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:06,133
you are using the IP's theme to build those characters

199
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:08,275
and build those settings if they are new to the IP.

200
00:10:08,835 --> 00:10:11,336
But it is pretty well defined by the IP or the story already.

201
00:10:12,117 --> 00:10:13,278
Where things get interesting,

202
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:16,039
and we are going to start making these into game things,

203
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,340
is the bottom three.

204
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,722
We are going to turn plot and events into mechanics.

205
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:23,544
So, the things that are happening.

206
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:25,426
are the things that are happening,

207
00:10:25,446 --> 00:10:26,607
they're the mechanics that you're using.

208
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:28,849
Time and events becomes pacing,

209
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,531
and presentation becomes tone,

210
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:33,834
and tone's pretty big, but we'll get to that later.

211
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:36,176
But first, mechanics.

212
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:39,419
So mechanics are the methods by which

213
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:41,060
the player interacts with the game.

214
00:10:42,382 --> 00:10:43,242
Aha.

215
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:44,944
So that's the gameplay definition.

216
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:47,566
From a story perspective, it's the methods

217
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:49,188
by which the player experiences the story.

218
00:10:50,572 --> 00:10:53,118
Now, mechanics are largely going to be defined by your genre.

219
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,365
And what I have here are three different Fallout games.

220
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,628
They're part of the Fallout AP.

221
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,853
But they all have different mechanics.

222
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:05,490
And each of those different genres of Fallout game

223
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,651
support the themes of Fallout in a different way.

224
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,471
So while you have simulation mechanics in Fallout Shelter,

225
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,352
such as building, managing people,

226
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:17,592
versus the open world mechanics,

227
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:19,633
your action, your shooting, your cover,

228
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:22,293
they're all informed by this IP.

229
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:26,634
Where things get interesting is pacing.

230
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:29,515
So pacing, our time and events of our story,

231
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:32,503
the rhythm and tempo of our gameplay.

232
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:36,405
It's the rate of activity or movement and the flow of your gameplay.

233
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:39,467
From a story perspective, it's the exact same thing.

234
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:40,807
It's the flow of the story.

235
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:42,708
It's all about flow, rhythm, tempo.

236
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:47,289
We have our mechanics defined by our game already.

237
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:53,872
Now we want to control the pace of those events and how those mechanics are used.

238
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:57,935
Pace in video games is really just how hard is the player being pushed to move forward

239
00:11:58,435 --> 00:11:59,575
versus asked to stay put.

240
00:12:00,276 --> 00:12:03,278
So movement incentives versus movement deterrents.

241
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:07,880
Movement incentives are pretty obvious.

242
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,282
If you put a threat behind somebody, they are going to go in the other direction.

243
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:14,651
Man, I'm glad you guys know this movie still.

244
00:12:14,671 --> 00:12:15,592
I don't want to feel old.

245
00:12:18,293 --> 00:12:18,893
Objectives.

246
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:23,194
If you played Mario Sunshine, you learn very early on,

247
00:12:23,214 --> 00:12:25,035
you pretty much always want to clear out goo.

248
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:28,336
And so even when the objective of the level

249
00:12:28,396 --> 00:12:29,376
isn't completely obvious,

250
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,317
there's moment-to-moment breadcrumbing

251
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,698
of the objective of, I need to clean this place.

252
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,379
If you haven't played Mario Sunshine,

253
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,779
it's the same concept as the original Super Mario games

254
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:39,600
where there's coins.

255
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,840
You want to collect coins.

256
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,261
You can play Super Mario, I don't know what to tell you.

257
00:12:46,222 --> 00:12:49,643
And then a couple of other incentives, movement, meaning movement around the player.

258
00:12:49,963 --> 00:12:52,624
So other NPCs walking by them.

259
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:58,666
A big trick games like to play is an NPC will take your objective, so combo those things

260
00:12:58,746 --> 00:13:00,106
and that NPC will run away.

261
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:02,187
So double incentive.

262
00:13:03,865 --> 00:13:05,965
And then time limits, which have kind of fallen out of vogue.

263
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:10,287
But you can look to a lot of older games like Sonic 2.

264
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:13,047
There's a time limit to how long you can be underwater.

265
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,788
So you get out of being underwater as fast as you can.

266
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,289
It's a very big incentive to keep going upwards.

267
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:21,190
And then we have our deterrents.

268
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,950
So the first deterrent here is tension.

269
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,870
And that's a perceived threat.

270
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:31,552
It's the difference between seeing a guy over there

271
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:33,652
and wanting to hide from him and think about

272
00:13:33,672 --> 00:13:34,572
how you're gonna deal with him,

273
00:13:35,093 --> 00:13:37,953
versus just getting bombarded by bad dudes.

274
00:13:38,313 --> 00:13:40,334
So it's that perceived threat

275
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:41,574
that's gonna slow a player down.

276
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:45,735
Then we have obstacles, obviously put something away,

277
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:47,636
gonna slow him down, pretty easy.

278
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:50,407
And then we have change in gameplay and movement.

279
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:53,388
The examples I have here are puzzles and dialogue choices.

280
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:55,850
We will dig into that in a moment,

281
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,572
how changing the kind of mode of gameplay your player is in

282
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:00,573
is going to slow them down.

283
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:05,376
But first I want to talk about pacing and storytelling methods.

284
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:07,297
There are a lot of ways to tell a story in a game,

285
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:11,760
and those techniques also have an effect on the pace.

286
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,402
I am going to analyze a couple of storytelling,

287
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,384
not a couple, a few, a few storytelling methods in games.

288
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:20,785
And we're going to evaluate them on two axes.

289
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:25,186
It's their allowing for gameplay and how they tell the story.

290
00:14:26,107 --> 00:14:29,588
Put another way, it's their player agency that they afford

291
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:33,449
and the certainty of delivery, meaning how certain am I

292
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:35,850
that this plot point is going to be expressed

293
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,071
because I'm telling the story in this way.

294
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:46,418
So, to get some examples on the board, cutscenes are a high-certainty, low-agency way to tell

295
00:14:46,438 --> 00:14:52,023
a story because you're making the player look at it and watch it, versus the inverse, which

296
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,185
is environmental storytelling, low-certainty but high-agency.

297
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:59,269
The player chooses to engage or not in your particular story beat.

298
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:02,407
And then we have triggered dialogue and narrative systems.

299
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:05,850
But first, they're better described visually.

300
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:11,553
So here we have a graph explaining player agency and certainty of delivery.

301
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:16,536
So environmental storytelling is up on the high agency, low certainty spectrum.

302
00:15:17,197 --> 00:15:19,078
And cutscenes are kind of complementing that on the other end.

303
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:21,279
So low agency, high certainty.

304
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,244
And then we have some techniques by which triggered dialogue is often shown.

305
00:15:27,484 --> 00:15:31,227
So on our high-end spectrum it is things like shouts, things like barks,

306
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:35,410
stuff the player might miss, but is present in the world and tells a story.

307
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,973
In the middle here we have audio logs and narration,

308
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:42,435
which are great because the player can move around,

309
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:44,977
but they may or may not be listening to them,

310
00:15:44,997 --> 00:15:46,658
and it is hard to account if they have or not.

311
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:49,020
Walk and talks kind of round out.

312
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:57,180
And then we have Overby Cutscenes, just a little bit more player agency than Cutscenes.

313
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,101
Or QTEs, because they're interactive cutscenes.

314
00:16:00,821 --> 00:16:01,321
Let's be honest.

315
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:01,401
And...

316
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:02,062
And...

317
00:16:02,082 --> 00:16:02,142
And...

318
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:02,222
And...

319
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:02,602
And...

320
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:02,682
And...

321
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:03,042
And...

322
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:03,122
And...

323
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:03,202
And...

324
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:04,002
And...

325
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:04,362
And...

326
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:04,443
And...

327
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:04,563
And...

328
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:04,643
And...

329
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:04,723
And...

330
00:16:04,743 --> 00:16:04,823
And...

331
00:16:04,843 --> 00:16:04,903
And...

332
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:04,983
And...

333
00:16:05,003 --> 00:16:05,343
And...

334
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:08,159
So what we're finding here is this kind of curve,

335
00:16:08,219 --> 00:16:11,140
and this curve represents how much the player

336
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,042
is in control of the narrative exposition of the story.

337
00:16:15,262 --> 00:16:16,763
The inverse of this being, of course,

338
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,124
how much control you as a designer have.

339
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:24,047
And these aren't really here to judge these

340
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:25,548
better or worse.

341
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:27,709
What this is here to help you judge

342
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:31,051
is what's more appropriate for your story,

343
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:32,772
and what's gonna apply to your pace better

344
00:16:33,332 --> 00:16:35,273
to get your story and your feelings across.

345
00:16:37,082 --> 00:16:40,605
So, kind of above our curve, which seems very enticing,

346
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:43,227
is dialogue and gameplay choices.

347
00:16:43,947 --> 00:16:44,968
But the caveat with those,

348
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:46,889
even though they have this great high agency,

349
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,971
high delivery, you're asking the player

350
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:50,232
to change how they're playing your game

351
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:53,034
very specifically to a different mode of gameplay.

352
00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:54,615
It might not fit in your genre,

353
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:58,118
it might not fit in your IP or your story at all.

354
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,800
But it can be useful if you want to support

355
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,740
that kind of thing in your game.

356
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:04,961
we had to be very careful with them at Telltale,

357
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:08,922
because they do change how the players flow.

358
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:11,802
So we might have a flow state where a player is kind of just,

359
00:17:12,183 --> 00:17:13,863
this is an example from episode three,

360
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,883
where the player is trying to solve a mystery

361
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:16,863
of who's stealing food.

362
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:19,804
And you're walking around and you're picking up clues,

363
00:17:19,844 --> 00:17:22,964
and then suddenly you tell Kenny you killed somebody.

364
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:25,465
And it can be very jarring,

365
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:26,885
and like changing that kind of gameplay

366
00:17:26,905 --> 00:17:28,705
can kind of pull them out of that flow

367
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:30,586
of solving the mystery and detract them.

368
00:17:31,907 --> 00:17:35,935
It was fine in this situation because inherently this part of the gameplay was in the beginning of the game.

369
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,237
It was very slow.

370
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,652
But something like this isn't appropriate when

371
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:43,434
we want to have the player go into an action moment.

372
00:17:43,654 --> 00:17:45,516
So, you know, when Lee's

373
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:48,578
exploring the kitchen where Clemensine lives,

374
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,122
we're going to use something like a QDE to keep the flow of the pace going.

375
00:17:53,142 --> 00:17:55,844
And often, we'll try to complement the camera angles

376
00:17:56,505 --> 00:17:59,607
to keep our pace, keep that mode of

377
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:01,469
gameplay from changing too much.

378
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,172
So even if the way the player is controlling the game is changing,

379
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:11,196
There's a flow that's maintained because the cameras make sense and they flow like a movie.

380
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:15,480
And that way we can still have moments of character development,

381
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:20,343
but they're kind of sandwiched between these moments of gameplay.

382
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:25,232
Now I'm going to dig into tone.

383
00:18:26,254 --> 00:18:28,556
So tone is how you're presenting your theme.

384
00:18:29,677 --> 00:18:32,741
It's the style or the manner of expression

385
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:34,763
your piece of work has.

386
00:18:35,744 --> 00:18:36,786
It's how you're approaching the theme,

387
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:38,628
and it's how you're attaining the feeling that you

388
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:39,669
want to find in your players.

389
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:43,446
So how to set the tone?

390
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:45,088
There's many ways to set the tone.

391
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:48,731
Cameras and your viewpoint, your lighting,

392
00:18:48,771 --> 00:18:51,714
your color palette, how your characters are written.

393
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:55,757
You know, not only the characters,

394
00:18:55,777 --> 00:18:57,298
but also your menus and your UI,

395
00:18:57,318 --> 00:18:58,860
anything that's telling the player something.

396
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,402
And then also your character's performances.

397
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:07,676
acting and VO. So how the characters are moving, how the characters are delivering their voice.

398
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:12,540
And of course music and sound effects. So these are the kind of things that really need to be

399
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,943
aligned with your original IP if you are using an IP or at least need to be analyzed if you're

400
00:19:17,003 --> 00:19:18,704
using a mood board or a collection of.

401
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:24,772
inspirations. Something we did actually on, especially Wolf Among Us, is we actually,

402
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:31,420
like, well, Among Us is based on Fables, which is a Vertigo comic, and, you know, we didn't have any

403
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,546
cinematic reference from a TV show, but we had the comic, and we actually analyzed the comic.

404
00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:38,487
from a camera viewpoint.

405
00:19:38,587 --> 00:19:40,847
So even if you're not working from a movie

406
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:41,628
or a television show,

407
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:43,648
you can still find those visual inspirations.

408
00:19:44,508 --> 00:19:47,429
With Walking Dead, we even went outside Walking Dead itself

409
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:49,669
because we were very inherently working off

410
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:50,590
of the comic universe.

411
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,910
So we found other horror movies,

412
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,650
other ways that horror was portrayed

413
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,131
and character moments were portrayed within horror

414
00:19:57,151 --> 00:19:58,291
to get that done.

415
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:01,912
So again, tone is really the presentation of your theme.

416
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,532
I have three games up here.

417
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:09,121
The first one is Mafia III, Grand Theft Auto V, and Saints Row.

418
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:13,208
What they all have in common is their open world, their action adventure games.

419
00:20:13,749 --> 00:20:15,012
They all start with a bank robbery.

420
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:19,168
Weirdly? I guess that was a thing.

421
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:26,150
But the way Bank Robbery is portrayed is they're all very different.

422
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:32,371
Mafia is a very serious game. It's about racial tension in the 1960s

423
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:34,391
in the American South. Pretty serious.

424
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:37,772
So the palettes are very... There's a lot of contrast.

425
00:20:38,732 --> 00:20:42,173
They often use one color overlaid on the rest of the game to

426
00:20:42,793 --> 00:20:45,433
get an emotion out of that color and go from there.

427
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,061
GTA, even though this is a very tense scene and it's kind of the one where

428
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:52,862
everything like really goes to shit for the characters,

429
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:55,523
you still see high saturation and lots of colors.

430
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:58,684
GTA is ready to be a cinematic game from the get-go,

431
00:20:58,744 --> 00:21:00,685
even when it has to be a little more muted than normal.

432
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:04,227
You'll see a lot of bright colors while you're driving around, any GTA game.

433
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:06,328
And then Saints Row...

434
00:21:07,228 --> 00:21:09,709
I could not pinpoint the theme of Saints Row, to be honest.

435
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:13,670
I think if you ask why to a Saints Row game, you get the answer, why not?

436
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:18,571
And you can see that in how they portray the game.

437
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:24,413
There's bright colors, it's pinks, it's cyans, it goes ball to the wall, it does not care.

438
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:25,193
And that's great.

439
00:21:25,253 --> 00:21:29,255
It knows what it is, and that's the theme and the feeling that they are trying to find.

440
00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:33,906
So, getting back to Die Hard, why we're all here.

441
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:38,590
So, Die Hard has a game, which I don't know if you guys have played.

442
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:42,514
It's on the PS1. It's the Die Hard trilogy.

443
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:47,858
I just want to show you Part 1 of Die Hard, which is, I guess, based on the first Die Hard movie.

444
00:21:53,363 --> 00:21:54,844
This is a really fun game, by the way.

445
00:21:56,145 --> 00:21:57,886
Out of context, not knowing it's a Die Hard game, but...

446
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,251
is kind of about police brutality.

447
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:05,593
It's a really good soundtrack too.

448
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:40,432
So I can't underscore enough how fun this game is.

449
00:22:41,373 --> 00:22:44,614
But let's look at it critically for a second.

450
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:47,055
The story that we learned about Die Hard for this game.

451
00:22:48,696 --> 00:22:51,978
We had masculinity through violence, primarily.

452
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:56,040
Pretty much only McClane on the characters.

453
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,301
We didn't really see anybody else there.

454
00:22:58,152 --> 00:23:00,073
We're in Nakatomi Plaza, I think.

455
00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:04,757
I'm killing bad guys.

456
00:23:05,157 --> 00:23:07,839
If someone asked me the story of that game, I'd say I shot a lot of guys.

457
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,721
And they said some funny one-liners that were from the movie.

458
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:16,066
And that happened in a very linear, singular, constant flow.

459
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:21,990
It was told through third-person wide shots, there was lots of quippy, constant action,

460
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,592
fast-paced music that kicks ass.

461
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,534
That music's really good. Let's get real.

462
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:31,929
So it's not much as Die Hard as it is kind of a product of its time in video games,

463
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:36,310
which was Doom, Quake, I have Risen Evil down here even.

464
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,731
That's more the feeling of this game because it's very much influenced by the games of its time,

465
00:23:41,251 --> 00:23:42,891
not Die Hard, the movie.

466
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:45,112
Do you guys want to watch Die Hard?

467
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:50,973
Okay, we've all seen Die Hard. We won't watch the whole movie.

468
00:23:51,653 --> 00:23:54,234
I definitely watched this movie twice while making this GBC presentation.

469
00:23:56,932 --> 00:23:59,535
So we didn't get to it. I just realized that's a longer clip than I wanted to show.

470
00:23:59,615 --> 00:24:04,260
But the point of it is that McLean's not running around shooting people.

471
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,905
He uses his gun as a puzzle tool, honestly.

472
00:24:08,945 --> 00:24:10,527
Like, he uses it to open a door.

473
00:24:11,348 --> 00:24:15,352
Later on in that scene, he actually is going to put that gun in the fan to stop it.

474
00:24:16,273 --> 00:24:21,235
He then puts the gun into a vent, or into an elevator shaft, ties a rope to it, and

475
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:23,296
repels down the elevator shaft using that.

476
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:24,997
He doesn't use it as a weapon.

477
00:24:25,057 --> 00:24:27,338
It's a puzzle inventory tool.

478
00:24:28,338 --> 00:24:29,559
He's Sam and Max, basically.

479
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,080
So again, it's really... And again, he was running from those guys.

480
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,601
He wasn't shooting someone like a Doom.

481
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:42,662
It's really less like Doom and more like something like Inside, actually,

482
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:45,063
where you should feel like you're being chased

483
00:24:45,143 --> 00:24:47,663
and feel like you're running away from something that's more powerful than you.

484
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,044
He's a New York Police Department cop.

485
00:24:50,104 --> 00:24:53,245
He's not a German terrorist who's trained to do this as a job.

486
00:24:55,197 --> 00:24:57,678
So really quickly, I just wanna wrap up,

487
00:24:57,798 --> 00:24:59,899
like die hard this elevator shaft scene,

488
00:24:59,939 --> 00:25:01,760
or lead into the elevator shaft scene.

489
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,262
It has that masculinity theme of falling your gut,

490
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:08,283
and love, because he's really doing this for his wife,

491
00:25:08,523 --> 00:25:08,823
I guess.

492
00:25:11,024 --> 00:25:12,985
It's really focused on McClane, but also Carl.

493
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:14,666
Like we see a lot of shots of Carl,

494
00:25:14,726 --> 00:25:16,227
who has this vendetta against McClane

495
00:25:16,507 --> 00:25:18,528
for killing his brother, if you're familiar with the film.

496
00:25:19,508 --> 00:25:21,229
So it's really not just about our hero here,

497
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,850
it's about the enemy as well.

498
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:31,507
Where it's not gonna tell me Plaza, but specifically those shafts and vents before that we talked about that caused those feelings of anxiety and isolation

499
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:34,209
It has

500
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:41,773
So what happens in these scenes? He's mostly escaping and outwitting the terrorists. So he's keeping one step ahead of them by

501
00:25:42,493 --> 00:25:44,174
Using his gun as an adventure game puzzle tool

502
00:25:46,072 --> 00:25:49,635
It's linear, it's that fast action mixed with the slower tense moments.

503
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,716
Die Hard has a lot of slow moments.

504
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:54,078
In fact, a gun doesn't get fired until 18 minutes in.

505
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,442
It takes a lot of time to set itself up, but that's what makes those action scenes feel

506
00:25:58,482 --> 00:25:59,663
so good when you do get to them.

507
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:05,795
And then the how, I can dig into this forever, but on a high level,

508
00:26:06,636 --> 00:26:09,760
the suspense and danger is shown with tight cameras, tense music.

509
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,722
We still get those personal moments with McLean,

510
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:14,825
lots of shots of his eyes bugging out and freaking out about something.

511
00:26:14,845 --> 00:26:16,447
And moments of levity.

512
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:17,549
We didn't get to the...

513
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,671
The part where he is putting the gun in the elevator shaft, but he has a lot of like,

514
00:26:23,252 --> 00:26:26,993
shit, John, what are you doing? And he does that the whole movie.

515
00:26:28,394 --> 00:26:33,035
But that's important to how that feels and how it offsets that suspense and danger.

516
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:41,899
So again, we have our lovely themes. Or our lovely story contents that we are going to put in this

517
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:42,419
little blue box.

518
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,784
And then our red themes we are going to put in this red box.

519
00:26:45,864 --> 00:26:47,866
And then let's make a Die Hard game.

520
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,410
So I'm going to assume this is an action game, as much as I

521
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,851
want to make an adventure game for Die Hard.

522
00:26:53,871 --> 00:26:55,633
I don't know how many producers would say yes to that.

523
00:26:56,593 --> 00:26:57,895
So let's assume we're making an action game.

524
00:26:57,915 --> 00:26:59,036
We're going to use mechanics from that.

525
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:02,956
So our verbs were escape and outwit the terrorists.

526
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:06,059
So we look at escape and we find running,

527
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:07,400
we find looking for cover,

528
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,802
the act of looking for the cover, and outwit.

529
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,664
So stealth, using that cover,

530
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:13,405
being strategic about when you go out

531
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:15,407
and attack somebody, and doing puzzles.

532
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:20,940
from pacing, you know, fast action, slow tense moments.

533
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,901
So our fast moments, we're planning to get the story

534
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:25,942
through with QTEs, cut scenes,

535
00:27:26,002 --> 00:27:27,403
things that we can get by quickly.

536
00:27:28,163 --> 00:27:29,864
Even if the player might lose control for a second,

537
00:27:30,584 --> 00:27:31,965
we're getting the story moments in we need

538
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:32,805
as fast as we can.

539
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:34,726
And then in slow tense moments,

540
00:27:34,746 --> 00:27:36,367
we're giving the player the air to breathe

541
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:38,108
so they can look at the environment,

542
00:27:38,148 --> 00:27:39,128
they can hear shouts,

543
00:27:40,068 --> 00:27:42,510
they can kind of take in things at their own pace.

544
00:27:44,054 --> 00:27:45,455
And then presentation.

545
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:51,060
Again, your story and your source material and your gameplay should be pretty united here.

546
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,323
Tight cameras, tense music, personal moments, moments of levity.

547
00:27:56,224 --> 00:27:59,906
Integrating these things into your game however you can is going to be critical to making

548
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:04,470
it feel like the source material, like the target thing you're trying to make.

549
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:07,993
In a nutshell, that's the narrative approach to level design.
