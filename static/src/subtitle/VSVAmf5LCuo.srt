1
00:00:05,455 --> 00:00:06,175
Thanks for coming here.

2
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:08,676
It's really nice to see a full room.

3
00:00:09,557 --> 00:00:13,719
And first of all, I'd like to kind of warm the crowd

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,541
by asking a show of hands, how many of you

5
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:20,523
have played the game I'm going to be talking about today,

6
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:21,163
Brawl Stars?

7
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:22,624
Nice.

8
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:23,685
OK.

9
00:00:24,185 --> 00:00:27,227
How many of you started with the global launch?

10
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:32,770
Sometime during the soft launch, beta.

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:34,490
Wow.

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,092
How many of you played the game in portrait mode,

13
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:39,514
like this instead of this?

14
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:40,955
Wow.

15
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:41,435
OK.

16
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:43,256
Nice.

17
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,318
I'm sure you have some questions.

18
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:49,981
I hope this talk is going to answer some of them,

19
00:00:51,162 --> 00:00:52,983
or raise more questions that I can answer later.

20
00:00:53,003 --> 00:01:00,168
All right, so the topic of the talk is a bit whimsical.

21
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:02,130
So if you don't get it now.

22
00:01:03,347 --> 00:01:05,068
Well, let's say if you don't get it after the talk,

23
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:06,428
then I didn't do my job.

24
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:13,333
But by core, I mean some core design element of the game.

25
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:20,417
And the talk is about how we, during the soft launch, which

26
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:23,539
went on for a long time, tried a lot of things,

27
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:27,902
a lot of very fundamental changes in our game

28
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:29,803
and what the results were.

29
00:01:31,865 --> 00:01:33,647
But first, a little bit about me.

30
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:37,069
I started at Supercell about eight years ago.

31
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,773
Worked on the very first browser-based MMO.

32
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:50,039
And also have been working on various fun, small projects,

33
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:53,602
iterations, and experiments, prototypes.

34
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:54,583
For example, this one.

35
00:01:55,777 --> 00:02:00,778
This is a world premiere for Forest Ranger, circa 2011.

36
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,340
Just a quick one week prototype with one artist.

37
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,521
And also, after we pivoted to mobile games,

38
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:16,322
I worked on the very first game that was killed by Supercell.

39
00:02:18,563 --> 00:02:18,803
RIP.

40
00:02:19,023 --> 00:02:23,504
It's appropriately in black and white there, very morose,

41
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:24,504
called Project Tower.

42
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:29,726
After that, I worked on Hay Day, Boom Beach,

43
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:33,767
and early on in Clash Royale.

44
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:36,968
And now for the last 2 and 1⁄2 years,

45
00:02:37,028 --> 00:02:38,469
I've been working on Brawl Stars.

46
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,132
So today, I'm going to be covering these topics.

47
00:02:47,812 --> 00:02:49,793
First of all, how we got into beta.

48
00:02:56,507 --> 00:02:57,228
Yeah, right, OK.

49
00:02:57,548 --> 00:03:01,029
How we got into beta, some, and then getting

50
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,491
into the meat of what I just was talking about a moment ago,

51
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:08,893
the iterations we did, trying to find the perfect control

52
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:14,736
scheme, improve player engagement and experience

53
00:03:14,796 --> 00:03:17,958
on the long term with different iterations of the progression

54
00:03:18,018 --> 00:03:18,398
system.

55
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:22,680
And then stuff we overlooked, social gameplay.

56
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:30,055
I wouldn't say overlooked, but I certainly have a different perspective now on the kind

57
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:31,837
of feedback we got from the community.

58
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:35,762
So let's jump right in.

59
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:49,297
Back in 2015, there was a lot of excitement at Supercell about Clash Royale.

60
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:57,280
The game wasn't going to be in beta for several months still, but the promise of a real-time

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,963
multiplayer, at least two-player competitive game was definitely in the air, and we thought...

62
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:12,868
the world is ready for a game that quite a lot of us,

63
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:16,289
a type of game on mobile that quite a lot of us like to play

64
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,791
and didn't exist yet.

65
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:26,974
So after Clash Royale went to beta, this was proven.

66
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,456
And we thought, OK, the market is ready as well, not just

67
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:31,797
the technology.

68
00:04:33,217 --> 00:04:37,719
And but even before Clash Royale went to beta,

69
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:46,964
We were prototyping with a small team on a multiplayer action

70
00:04:47,024 --> 00:04:47,445
shooter.

71
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:57,669
And between 2016 and 2017, we had three internal milestones.

72
00:04:57,969 --> 00:05:00,950
We call them, or the target of these milestones

73
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,230
is always a company playable.

74
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:05,410
Being a relatively small company,

75
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,994
we have the advantage of getting or potentially getting

76
00:05:10,855 --> 00:05:13,937
everybody at the company playing our new game projects,

77
00:05:14,778 --> 00:05:19,643
getting a very wide variety of different backgrounds

78
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:24,347
from finance to legal to marketing to game teams,

79
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:27,430
player support.

80
00:05:29,593 --> 00:05:33,835
engaged in our games and giving feedback

81
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:36,596
from their own perspectives also.

82
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:45,400
This has been kind of a staple of Supercell game development

83
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,541
for years now.

84
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:54,264
We also tested with real players.

85
00:05:55,802 --> 00:06:02,006
Because for us, the major worry was fast-paced controls

86
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:06,668
on a mobile device or any kind of touchscreen device.

87
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:12,611
And we wanted to see if our designs, control scheme designs

88
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:16,753
were actually usable by regular people.

89
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:21,716
We were confident enough to soft launch the game

90
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:22,577
on June 15th of 2017.

91
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:35,286
in Canada and on iOS only. And we'll come back to this decision. Actually, we'll talk

92
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:45,829
about it right now a little bit. So, a lot of you know why games often get soft launched

93
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:53,532
in Canada. For Supercell, the reasons are pretty much the same. It's a little bit more

94
00:06:55,034 --> 00:06:59,595
It's a smaller market that's quite comparable to the US,

95
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:02,816
which is one of our major, has historically

96
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,296
been our most important market.

97
00:07:05,756 --> 00:07:10,937
And it also allows us to compare the performance of the beta

98
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:17,019
to our previous betas and get some insight of how we're doing,

99
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:18,459
what the target should be.

100
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:24,152
It's much easier to develop just for one platform,

101
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:27,515
so an iOS has traditionally been the one

102
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:30,538
we develop for at Supercell.

103
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,424
For Brawl Stars in particular, matchmaking was a concern.

104
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,507
So we wanted to limit ourselves to one geographic region

105
00:07:41,988 --> 00:07:45,831
at first to have people playing in the same time zone.

106
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:47,232
So that's our.

107
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:56,001
beta population wasn't spread out all over the world to make sure that they have good

108
00:07:56,061 --> 00:08:05,869
fast matchmaking experience. And finally, we were concerned about the game spreading,

109
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,332
especially the APK spreading out and...

110
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,611
too many people or more people than we would prefer having

111
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:19,355
the kind of not finished, not polished soft launch

112
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,218
experience of the game instead of saving it

113
00:08:22,258 --> 00:08:23,239
for the global launch.

114
00:08:27,502 --> 00:08:31,265
It turned out to be the longest beta in Supercell history,

115
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:33,687
545 days, which was.

116
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:40,693
a long time for both the players who started early on

117
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:41,974
and for the game team.

118
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:49,717
The reasons for that are, well, again, historical.

119
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:58,240
We have been able to release very popular games before,

120
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,561
and all the new game projects are going to be,

121
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:04,582
all the new games are going to be compared to these games.

122
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:05,763
So we already had.

123
00:09:07,057 --> 00:09:12,361
some fairly ambitious goals going into the project.

124
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:18,045
And in addition, while we're quite

125
00:09:18,706 --> 00:09:22,949
happy to kill poorly performing games in soft launch,

126
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:30,755
we're committed to support the game for years for the players

127
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:33,798
once we go global.

128
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,540
OK, now I'm going to show a quick video.

129
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,761
I'm not sure if the sound's going to work or not,

130
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:43,664
how the game looked when we launched in June 2017.

131
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:47,086
And if you play the game today, you

132
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:51,809
might notice that it looks quite similar to, well,

133
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,092
fairly similar to how the game, I mean,

134
00:09:56,673 --> 00:10:01,856
that state almost two years ago and today look fairly similar.

135
00:10:01,896 --> 00:10:04,198
But almost everything has changed under the hood.

136
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:21,800
Angry noob!

137
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:25,261
Play-tea?

138
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:29,563
Angry ball!

139
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:34,725
You wanna brawl?

140
00:10:34,745 --> 00:10:37,126
Alright.

141
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,928
So let's talk about some of those changes under the hood.

142
00:10:43,678 --> 00:10:48,102
First, I'm going to dial back the time a little bit

143
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:53,946
before we went to beta and talk about various control scheme

144
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:58,930
iterations we had before and during.

145
00:11:03,274 --> 00:11:09,359
We are still pretty proud of how we've

146
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:10,400
been able to innovate.

147
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,480
touch with touchscreen controls.

148
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:20,403
In Hay Day, in Clash Royale, in Clash of Clans even,

149
00:11:21,443 --> 00:11:23,984
we felt that we really raised the bar to how you,

150
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:29,565
for the usability of touchscreen games.

151
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:30,886
And we didn't.

152
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:34,398
want to go with the default option for an action shooter,

153
00:11:34,898 --> 00:11:38,799
which is dual joystick type of game.

154
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:41,560
These games were out already, several of them,

155
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,300
but basically none of the team, the early team,

156
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,062
liked dual joystick controls.

157
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:57,044
So that started a long process of prototyping, experimenting.

158
00:11:58,345 --> 00:11:58,745
With the

159
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:10,403
main objective of trying to take some of the twitchiness, the fast-paced movement and excessive

160
00:12:11,003 --> 00:12:22,165
tapping or control actions out of the game. This is one of the prototypes where the player

161
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:25,506
actually only moves the character by tapping on the screen and you can see a faint outline

162
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:25,646
there.

163
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:25,926
And that's it.

164
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:26,526
I hope you enjoyed this video.

165
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:27,626
If you did, make sure to like, comment, and subscribe.

166
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:28,307
And I'll see you in the next one.

167
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:28,567
Bye for now.

168
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:34,414
that shows the range of the character's weapon.

169
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,695
And once an opponent gets into range,

170
00:12:37,996 --> 00:12:39,797
the character will automatically fire.

171
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:49,102
This was a fairly fun control scheme,

172
00:12:49,742 --> 00:12:50,963
but we thought we could do better,

173
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:54,325
and also felt like we should give the players more control.

174
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:56,166
Also, there were always complaints about the...

175
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:05,854
slow-paced feeling of all the kind of deliberate pace of the gameplay. Here's the following

176
00:13:05,894 --> 00:13:15,417
iteration. And in terms of the core combat, this is pretty much what ended up in the soft

177
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:22,219
launch version. Even though you might notice the game looks fairly different, but that's

178
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,300
a topic for a whole other talk.

179
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:28,806
So in this iteration, you can see the little cursor moving around.

180
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:34,210
The player taps where they want to move and swipes and releases the fire.

181
00:13:35,211 --> 00:13:41,995
And the place where they release is the targeting point of their attack.

182
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:47,298
So now we moved from auto-attacking only to pure skill shots.

183
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:55,161
And we thought this felt like a very good compromise.

184
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:57,281
It didn't feel too hectic, and the controls

185
00:13:57,301 --> 00:14:00,742
were simple and reasonably easy to learn

186
00:14:02,703 --> 00:14:04,483
until we started user testing.

187
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:10,425
This is from March 2017, and an actual user.

188
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:18,127
playing the game for the first time,

189
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:23,390
about to start their first game.

190
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:30,134
And immediately we noticed something strange,

191
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:32,515
or something that was different from the way we play the game.

192
00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:36,017
So in the team, we'd been playing the game.

193
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:40,467
by holding the device on one hand

194
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,969
and then tapping with the index finger of the other

195
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,492
to execute the controls, movement, and firing.

196
00:14:49,352 --> 00:14:52,614
But this is not how people actually use their cell phones.

197
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:58,558
So instead of pecking on the screen like an old person,

198
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,160
our testers.

199
00:15:03,688 --> 00:15:08,010
We're using two thumbs, as if texting the regular way

200
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:08,750
they use their phone.

201
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:15,734
And also our ideas of deliberate and kind

202
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:20,857
of low actions per minute gameplay went out the window.

203
00:15:21,297 --> 00:15:23,358
It turned out to be incredibly hectic,

204
00:15:23,978 --> 00:15:25,279
as you can see on the video.

205
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:34,498
the feedback from shooting wasn't sufficient to let the player know that this is all the

206
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:44,142
actions they can take for the moment. So, the testers and our co-workers alike reported

207
00:15:44,222 --> 00:15:48,703
feeling like, feeling very overwhelmed by the combat because they felt like they had

208
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:56,907
to do 250 actions per minute. So based on this testing, um, we decided to do a test

209
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:00,507
and the feedback we'd been getting.

210
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:04,749
We did one more iteration before going

211
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:07,511
to beta for our control scheme.

212
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:12,793
And this was introducing the dreaded virtual joystick.

213
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:18,496
So we didn't change the game dramatically,

214
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:21,657
unlike between the two previous iterations.

215
00:16:22,362 --> 00:16:23,923
Where, by the way, I forgot to mention

216
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:26,926
that the reason we turned the game into portrait mode

217
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:32,430
was for that more natural way of holding your handheld device.

218
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:39,115
We were designing for phones as the primary platform.

219
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:42,878
And we felt, especially with the experience of Clash Royale,

220
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:45,580
that this was the way to go.

221
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:49,543
So there was one virtual stick at the.

222
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:53,730
Bottom corner, you could customize that

223
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,671
for either left or right-handed.

224
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:59,512
And then you would tap where you wanted to shoot.

225
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:06,694
Now, user testing found that this was also

226
00:17:06,755 --> 00:17:08,055
frustrating for players.

227
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:13,957
And the kind of drifting stick we had designed

228
00:17:14,537 --> 00:17:16,078
ended up drifting all over the screen.

229
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:24,747
However, one thing we found from both the company playables,

230
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:30,711
user testing, and our just playing with the team

231
00:17:30,871 --> 00:17:34,313
internally was that when you played together,

232
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,535
when you were in the same room, you

233
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:41,078
could put three absolute beginners in the same room,

234
00:17:41,738 --> 00:17:44,200
and they would still have fun, even if they

235
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,280
struggled with the controls.

236
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:48,122
This guy is really enjoying himself.

237
00:17:50,513 --> 00:17:53,834
After playing the game, maybe about 10 or 15 minutes,

238
00:17:54,455 --> 00:17:57,736
and there's good communication going on.

239
00:17:58,156 --> 00:18:05,519
And there is a lot of laughter and overall a really nice

240
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:07,360
gameplay experience.

241
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,461
We'll come back to this later.

242
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:16,284
So here are the two control modes we had to choose between.

243
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:26,417
Tap once again, you hold the device however you hold it, and tap by your chosen finger

244
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:33,983
to move, and then swipe and release to fire. Whereas the joystick movement was

245
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:39,608
basically holding the device on one hand, and then with the other hand free

246
00:18:39,928 --> 00:18:43,712
you would tap where you want to shoot. The joystick would control your character.

247
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,330
We couldn't decide.

248
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,611
The user testing was indecisive.

249
00:18:50,691 --> 00:18:55,332
Company playables, I mean, voting after our company

250
00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:58,193
playable gave us no clear winner.

251
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:02,134
So we decided that let's let the players decide.

252
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:07,515
We assigned all new players, decided

253
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:11,236
to assign all new players in the beta with one of these two

254
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:11,876
control models.

255
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:14,177
However.

256
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:16,157
even they couldn't decide.

257
00:19:17,258 --> 00:19:22,802
So looking at the retention, how long players

258
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:26,525
stick with the game, there was no clear winner

259
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:28,286
between the two control models.

260
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:32,509
That left us scratching our heads

261
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:36,732
until our data scientist dug a bit deeper

262
00:19:37,113 --> 00:19:40,115
and found one clear difference.

263
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:44,044
players were switching more to the joystick controls

264
00:19:44,104 --> 00:19:46,725
from tap controls than vice versa.

265
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:51,407
And that led us to eventually phase out the tap controls.

266
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:54,968
They remained as an option in the menus,

267
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:58,450
but everybody got joystick controls as the first choice.

268
00:20:02,252 --> 00:20:06,934
Now, there's a twist, and it's this.

269
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:10,195
Eventually.

270
00:20:11,217 --> 00:20:16,639
About nine months later, we decided to turn the game back to landscape.

271
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:19,481
Well, back. It had already always been in portrait mode.

272
00:20:20,381 --> 00:20:26,864
And this was more or less a natural progression from that single joystick.

273
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:30,186
We had also already experimented with double joystick,

274
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:31,526
even though we hadn't tested it.

275
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:33,627
But on a portrait mode screen,

276
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:39,890
you didn't really have room for your two thumbs to maneuver.

277
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:43,278
if the phone was in portrait mode.

278
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:48,579
So with the popularity and eventual acceptance

279
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:51,479
of victory of the single joystick,

280
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,541
it just felt like a more natural method of controlling the game.

281
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:03,442
Going to one joystick was basically

282
00:21:03,602 --> 00:21:07,022
opening the door for the two joysticks.

283
00:21:07,782 --> 00:21:09,863
And that required this quite.

284
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:11,206
Big change.

285
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:15,430
And of course, it had a huge impact on core gameplay.

286
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,412
We had to teach players who had been playing the game, some

287
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:22,016
of them for nine months, to relearn the shooting

288
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:23,056
controls all over.

289
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:29,302
We had to implement a whole new auto-aim or quick-fire feature

290
00:21:29,342 --> 00:21:31,184
where tapping the right joystick would

291
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:33,065
shoot at the nearest opponent.

292
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:34,827
And

293
00:21:36,284 --> 00:21:41,587
I'll come back to the fallout from this in the community

294
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:42,388
feedback section.

295
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,232
All right, so these are the different control mode

296
00:21:48,252 --> 00:21:52,014
iterations we made before and during the beta.

297
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:55,016
Let's move on to progression.

298
00:21:57,498 --> 00:22:01,781
So when the game went to beta, oh, there's another pun.

299
00:22:06,372 --> 00:22:13,254
upgrade system, well, the upgrade screen looked like this. So we had decided to go with an

300
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:20,137
upgrade system as something for players to strive for, to give them meaningful progression

301
00:22:20,197 --> 00:22:29,521
from one session to the next or one week to the next when they've been playing more and

302
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:29,761
more.

303
00:22:31,404 --> 00:22:35,966
And our first iteration of this that actually went out

304
00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:41,628
to players was very much like, say, an RPG game, where

305
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:47,911
you had points to allocate to different character

306
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:50,252
traits or attributes.

307
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,954
Now, in a competitive game, this is risky,

308
00:22:56,535 --> 00:22:57,395
because the

309
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:08,271
Any kind of power progression means that you'll sometimes face players with more powerful characters than you.

310
00:23:10,053 --> 00:23:15,556
So we tried to walk a fine line here by keeping the power scaling.

311
00:23:16,886 --> 00:23:20,747
very small compared to, for example, Clash Royale has,

312
00:23:21,587 --> 00:23:24,528
if you look at the very maximum of scaling

313
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:27,348
you can have with common cards, it's about 200%.

314
00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:32,009
So we went on the very conservative side.

315
00:23:32,469 --> 00:23:34,170
And if you take into account the fact

316
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,511
that you rarely face, due to matchmaking,

317
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:43,352
have this maximum difference in any one match.

318
00:23:43,912 --> 00:23:44,192
Anyhow.

319
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:46,916
it felt like a good compromise.

320
00:23:46,956 --> 00:23:48,937
And in fact, even though we were quite

321
00:23:49,198 --> 00:23:52,760
concerned about this choice, we had good results.

322
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,142
So players weren't complaining about the game

323
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:57,302
being played to win.

324
00:23:58,023 --> 00:24:01,685
Instead, the progression system, at least in the beginning,

325
00:24:01,905 --> 00:24:03,266
felt meaningful.

326
00:24:07,668 --> 00:24:13,312
So this upgrade resource used for

327
00:24:14,858 --> 00:24:19,242
every kind of upgrade in the game was in loot boxes

328
00:24:20,082 --> 00:24:25,387
and also added much needed content to the loot boxes

329
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:29,691
so that the box we gave the player

330
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:33,494
at the end of every session or at least the end of every day

331
00:24:33,534 --> 00:24:37,037
if you played actively would contain something useful

332
00:24:37,057 --> 00:24:40,660
that would make you feel like you're getting ahead

333
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,260
in the game.

334
00:24:42,842 --> 00:24:43,222
However.

335
00:24:45,173 --> 00:24:50,275
It wasn't very satisfying to get a single Elixir bottle.

336
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:51,856
Anybody remember this screen?

337
00:24:51,876 --> 00:24:53,617
Yeah.

338
00:24:56,258 --> 00:25:01,421
And in fact, even getting massive amounts of Elixir

339
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,262
didn't feel that great.

340
00:25:04,602 --> 00:25:08,784
There was a longstanding misconception among our players

341
00:25:08,844 --> 00:25:09,024
that

342
00:25:11,188 --> 00:25:14,650
Getting 10 elixir cheated you out from getting

343
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:15,831
a legendary character.

344
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:21,594
So people felt really bad, missing out on Spike and Crow,

345
00:25:21,874 --> 00:25:24,056
or so they thought, even though the drop rates were

346
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:25,516
very, very different.

347
00:25:25,937 --> 00:25:27,938
But despite many attempts to communicate that,

348
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:32,621
the rumor or the misconception just stuck.

349
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:37,844
We saw that people went sticking around.

350
00:25:37,864 --> 00:25:37,924
And

351
00:25:41,316 --> 00:25:43,318
assumed that a big part of the reason

352
00:25:43,358 --> 00:25:49,583
was that this progression system wasn't satisfying enough.

353
00:25:49,703 --> 00:25:51,945
And we also saw this from the community.

354
00:25:52,065 --> 00:25:55,128
A lot of complaints about getting duplicate brawlers,

355
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:57,150
which was another thing back then,

356
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,814
and small elixir drops that felt meaningless.

357
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:08,139
So we decided to iterate the progression system.

358
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:17,779
So we, six months into the beta, it looked completely different.

359
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,442
And if you don't get what's going on there,

360
00:26:22,502 --> 00:26:23,203
I don't blame you.

361
00:26:26,945 --> 00:26:30,148
We addressed one issue that people

362
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:31,869
had with the progression system, which was.

363
00:26:33,554 --> 00:26:38,518
having difficulty deciding where to allocate the elixir,

364
00:26:38,818 --> 00:26:40,199
which characters to upgrade.

365
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:44,002
You would always be second-guessing

366
00:26:44,582 --> 00:26:48,065
which character is going to be nerfed in the coming update,

367
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,946
which character is going to be buffed.

368
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:53,409
Am I really going to enjoy playing with this guy?

369
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:55,550
Because once you allocated your resource,

370
00:26:56,611 --> 00:27:00,054
it was gone, or it was permanently allocated

371
00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:02,295
with no chance of respeccing.

372
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:08,147
We took some of that difficulty of choice

373
00:27:08,287 --> 00:27:11,949
out while keeping the same amount of power scaling.

374
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:18,593
So instead of a unified upgrade resource,

375
00:27:18,613 --> 00:27:24,156
we now had these pins, badges, medals, and crests,

376
00:27:24,496 --> 00:27:28,698
which were unique items for each character,

377
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,240
improving one of their stats.

378
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:38,707
And all of these were added to the loot boxes.

379
00:27:39,027 --> 00:27:40,888
So there was a lot more variety now

380
00:27:41,048 --> 00:27:43,630
that you could get when you opened a box

381
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,351
at the end of the session.

382
00:27:47,452 --> 00:27:50,574
And there was even a chance of non-linear upgrades.

383
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:56,037
So you might get lucky and pick up a crest for attack damage,

384
00:27:56,277 --> 00:27:58,318
for example, from just a random box.

385
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:00,079
So now there was a.

386
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:06,039
there was some dynamic range to the boxes you opened,

387
00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:10,924
other than just characters, which were quite few and far

388
00:28:10,964 --> 00:28:13,747
between once you had the common ones and the rare ones.

389
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,233
In addition, we went a step further

390
00:28:21,113 --> 00:28:25,678
by adding a star power to each character, which actually

391
00:28:27,102 --> 00:28:28,724
changed the gameplay.

392
00:28:29,805 --> 00:28:33,428
So as you can see, maybe it's tiny text,

393
00:28:33,908 --> 00:28:39,133
but Shelly's star power gives her the ability

394
00:28:39,173 --> 00:28:43,057
to slow down enemies when she hits them with her super.

395
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,241
There were some downsides to it.

396
00:28:48,402 --> 00:28:50,063
It made balancing between.

397
00:28:52,793 --> 00:28:56,435
characters who do have the star power and don't have it.

398
00:28:56,995 --> 00:28:59,756
A little bit more complicated, you

399
00:28:59,796 --> 00:29:07,279
had to take both into account or just balance for the top level

400
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,241
fully upgraded players.

401
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:11,981
And also, the

402
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:16,483
Having the start powers in the game

403
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,943
made the game a little bit harder to understand.

404
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:21,184
You didn't know exactly what you were facing

405
00:29:21,724 --> 00:29:23,384
when you entered the game.

406
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:26,265
You might be slowed down by Shelly's super or not.

407
00:29:27,325 --> 00:29:31,886
And also, the whole upgrade screen

408
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:35,207
was really hard to explain for first-time players.

409
00:29:36,888 --> 00:29:38,108
It did its job, though.

410
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:44,730
We were able to see a noticeable bump in longer-term retention.

411
00:29:48,156 --> 00:29:52,419
However, here comes the twist.

412
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:55,581
We were going to have to redo the UI anyway

413
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:56,982
when we went to landscape.

414
00:29:59,343 --> 00:30:04,347
And as a leap of faith, we decided to try something,

415
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:06,908
well, tried and true.

416
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:14,273
So only three months later, we released another progression

417
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:14,593
system.

418
00:30:17,242 --> 00:30:18,803
Yeah, you can imagine how the players felt.

419
00:30:18,843 --> 00:30:19,843
Some of you felt it too.

420
00:30:24,585 --> 00:30:27,006
This second iteration during the beta

421
00:30:27,907 --> 00:30:32,969
had an upgrade or progression system that was

422
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:34,590
quite similar to Clash Royale.

423
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:39,552
So similarly to how cards are stacked

424
00:30:40,352 --> 00:30:43,273
until you can upgrade them, now we had.

425
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:51,372
In Clash Royale now we had PowerPoints that are character specific and you use coins to

426
00:30:52,213 --> 00:30:53,114
enact the upgrade.

427
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,100
There were some changes because of that.

428
00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:04,826
There was absolutely no choice anymore when it came to choosing.

429
00:31:06,213 --> 00:31:08,294
which character trait to upgrade.

430
00:31:08,454 --> 00:31:10,195
You could only pick which character

431
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:13,616
to actually finalize the upgrade for with coins.

432
00:31:15,237 --> 00:31:21,179
So to make up for this change, we

433
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:25,680
introduced 10 different upgrade levels

434
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:31,502
and increased the power scaling in order

435
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:35,303
to make each level feel significant.

436
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:40,618
So this was another kind of leap of faith to see.

437
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:43,380
And we had to see how the community would react.

438
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,282
But this was the least of the community's worries.

439
00:31:47,523 --> 00:31:49,885
The game still apparently felt fair.

440
00:31:51,486 --> 00:31:57,610
But even though this new interface was much, much nicer

441
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,631
looking and

442
00:32:02,145 --> 00:32:07,069
There was no more confusion about pins, badges, medals,

443
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:09,270
crests, tokens, et cetera.

444
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:13,013
We had really simplified everything.

445
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:16,997
We couldn't improve metrics.

446
00:32:18,097 --> 00:32:22,241
And a bit later on, I'll be talking about how

447
00:32:22,261 --> 00:32:23,322
the players felt about this.

448
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:29,066
Thanks.

449
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:30,687
All right, now that I've gone.

450
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:35,762
over the control scheme iterations, the progression

451
00:32:35,802 --> 00:32:39,945
system iterations, let's talk about something

452
00:32:40,686 --> 00:32:47,811
we didn't improve for a year, which is playing with friends.

453
00:32:49,332 --> 00:32:55,316
So as I said before, we knew the game is fun

454
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:56,597
when you play it with friends.

455
00:32:57,498 --> 00:32:59,139
That's the best gameplay experience.

456
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:00,420
But.

457
00:33:02,002 --> 00:33:06,004
actually playing with people you know together

458
00:33:06,905 --> 00:33:09,146
was quite difficult.

459
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:11,768
We made you jump through quite a hoop.

460
00:33:13,448 --> 00:33:16,130
You either had to be face-to-face

461
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:21,093
and input this five-character code

462
00:33:21,653 --> 00:33:23,274
to enter your friend's game room,

463
00:33:26,195 --> 00:33:27,856
or you might...

464
00:33:30,495 --> 00:33:33,796
get some people, semi-random people from your clan

465
00:33:34,117 --> 00:33:37,378
that we called bands back then, which are called clubs now.

466
00:33:37,918 --> 00:33:39,119
Yeah, iteration, right?

467
00:33:44,082 --> 00:33:46,003
So you had...

468
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:50,097
by far, the most fun when you manage

469
00:33:50,137 --> 00:33:50,978
to play with your friends.

470
00:33:51,758 --> 00:33:54,200
And for example, our finance team

471
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:59,382
is still playing together ever since the early beta,

472
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:03,364
because they got into the habit of typing in the room code,

473
00:34:04,105 --> 00:34:09,688
even though you don't actually always have to do that.

474
00:34:10,808 --> 00:34:13,970
They play together and have had amazing retention.

475
00:34:16,628 --> 00:34:18,389
You can't say the same for most players.

476
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:24,953
Even though you get a competitive edge from playing

477
00:34:24,973 --> 00:34:27,794
with your friends, you can figure out the team

478
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:30,356
composition that you want to play for a certain map,

479
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:31,316
certain game mode.

480
00:34:32,877 --> 00:34:36,859
For most people, most people ended up playing by themselves,

481
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,001
just trusting the random matchmaking.

482
00:34:42,503 --> 00:34:43,643
And instead of

483
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:53,288
focusing on some way to get your actual friends in the same room with you, we had this...

484
00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:02,415
We only enabled players to invite band members and band members typically they aren't in

485
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:08,280
your close circle of friends and basically anybody who happened to be online might join

486
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:08,460
you.

487
00:35:10,102 --> 00:35:13,144
There was no in-game friends list so if there was somebody...

488
00:35:15,195 --> 00:35:17,516
that you played with, some random person,

489
00:35:17,877 --> 00:35:21,939
there was absolutely no way to connect with them afterwards,

490
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,541
even if you wanted to.

491
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:34,348
And finally, like I said earlier on,

492
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:39,312
this was a very fateful decision for us to go with iOS only.

493
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:40,773
Because.

494
00:35:42,221 --> 00:35:45,484
If you think about a game that is best played with friends,

495
00:35:47,586 --> 00:35:50,929
if you have an iOS device and your friend happens to have an

496
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:53,151
Android device, you just can't play with them.

497
00:35:53,792 --> 00:36:01,279
And that's a hard stop, unless you get them to buy an iPhone

498
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:03,060
or iPad just for Brawl Stars.

499
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:04,421
And that's a hard sell.

500
00:36:06,558 --> 00:36:10,741
So word of mouth and the kind of excitement

501
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:13,342
a fun multiplayer game can achieve

502
00:36:14,023 --> 00:36:19,566
was definitely dampened by going iOS only.

503
00:36:21,307 --> 00:36:25,970
And also, you can't really tell your friends

504
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:30,193
to start playing a game if they can't play the game.

505
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:31,134
All right.

506
00:36:32,355 --> 00:36:34,756
Which kind of gets me to.

507
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,931
community feedback.

508
00:36:38,852 --> 00:36:43,096
So let's start by talking about the way

509
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,497
we handle our community.

510
00:36:45,438 --> 00:36:47,199
Ever since the beginning of the beta,

511
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:50,422
it's been centered on Reddit.

512
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,486
Even though we have some social media presence and a YouTube

513
00:36:54,526 --> 00:36:55,827
channel, the

514
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:03,993
We actually direct people from inside the game to our Reddit

515
00:37:04,113 --> 00:37:06,074
with various in-game news posts.

516
00:37:07,316 --> 00:37:11,359
And we've had several thousand active, more or less

517
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:14,162
active members on Reddit throughout the beta.

518
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:22,870
And we also communicate with our community

519
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,492
through our subreddit.

520
00:37:28,584 --> 00:37:31,568
In return, we get a lot of suggestions, complaints,

521
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:34,311
and all kinds of cool stuff like fan art.

522
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:43,703
However, having a very passionate community

523
00:37:45,285 --> 00:37:47,728
also means that they're going to speak out when.

524
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:51,753
things are not going well from their perspective.

525
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:56,017
So all the stuff I've been telling you

526
00:37:56,057 --> 00:38:00,301
about the iterations we made to core functionality

527
00:38:01,882 --> 00:38:04,304
was very jarring for the player community.

528
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:07,627
So we changed.

529
00:38:08,757 --> 00:38:12,200
The progress system, even though we always refunded everything,

530
00:38:12,381 --> 00:38:16,484
so people got back anything they'd

531
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:20,308
spent on improving their characters and got to respec,

532
00:38:21,229 --> 00:38:24,432
it was still a big jarring change to relearn.

533
00:38:24,472 --> 00:38:28,996
But even more than that, changing the control model

534
00:38:30,317 --> 00:38:32,259
was really tough for a lot of players.

535
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:35,442
They had to relearn very basic.

536
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:39,939
functionality of the game and give up a lot of the skills

537
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:40,700
they'd learned.

538
00:38:43,382 --> 00:38:47,365
And on top of that, we provided very little content

539
00:38:47,705 --> 00:38:50,927
between these big core gameplay changes.

540
00:38:52,028 --> 00:38:54,930
And the thinking was that we already

541
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:59,954
know from the early beta that whenever we release something

542
00:39:00,014 --> 00:39:03,517
new, a new brawler, a new game mode, or something like that,

543
00:39:03,837 --> 00:39:05,058
that is exciting for players.

544
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:08,949
it increases our metrics.

545
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,872
And so now we can focus on something else.

546
00:39:18,115 --> 00:39:24,120
And finally, as hard as it is to say,

547
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,323
there's often been this kind of drop in the bucket mentality

548
00:39:28,403 --> 00:39:32,445
where our beta player base is seen as.

549
00:39:35,092 --> 00:39:36,252
sort of expendable.

550
00:39:37,093 --> 00:39:37,813
Not entirely.

551
00:39:38,073 --> 00:39:41,134
We do listen to them, and we communicate with them

552
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:42,715
and appreciate their feedback.

553
00:39:43,716 --> 00:39:47,898
However, compared to the global player base,

554
00:39:48,098 --> 00:39:50,919
this is a very small amount of players.

555
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:52,240
So.

556
00:39:54,263 --> 00:39:56,425
We take the beta stage as a chance

557
00:39:56,485 --> 00:39:59,027
to make big changes and experiment.

558
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:03,230
And after global launch, those kind of big changes

559
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:06,753
would be very, very detrimental for the future of the game.

560
00:40:07,034 --> 00:40:10,897
So it's a sacrifice we've been willing to make.

561
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:13,179
However.

562
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,684
with an active, passionate, and angry community on Reddit,

563
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:25,970
just two taps away from starting the game, where you can see,

564
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:32,156
a new player can see a wall of, OK, this is not

565
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:36,239
a wall of posts, but just a complaint about how

566
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,781
the community sentiment was.

567
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:45,249
as recently as a year ago.

568
00:40:49,692 --> 00:40:51,954
It's a really big warning sign for somebody

569
00:40:52,114 --> 00:40:56,016
who's starting a new game, checking out the community,

570
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:58,338
what the game has to offer.

571
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:06,023
even our content creators were affected by the state of affairs.

572
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:10,687
So YouTube content creators have been really important for us

573
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:12,789
historically and currently

574
00:41:14,951 --> 00:41:18,954
as people who drive in new players,

575
00:41:19,695 --> 00:41:22,017
who keep the current player base engaged

576
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:26,881
and overall sort of positive...

577
00:41:27,993 --> 00:41:33,957
avatars to show what our games are at their most fun.

578
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:36,679
Here's one of them.

579
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,584
Kairostime has been with us from the very beginning,

580
00:41:42,824 --> 00:41:46,727
and he's one of our most popular YouTubers.

581
00:41:48,428 --> 00:41:51,550
And OK, he looks like he's pretty sad at this point.

582
00:41:53,572 --> 00:41:55,433
But actually, he's acting, because.

583
00:41:58,088 --> 00:42:00,690
We did something different in May 2018.

584
00:42:03,112 --> 00:42:10,578
So this was a stage in the beta where even the game team,

585
00:42:10,638 --> 00:42:13,199
well, the game team was already very frustrated

586
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:19,784
by the apparent lack of movement in metrics.

587
00:42:19,944 --> 00:42:23,287
We weren't able to improve the game sufficiently

588
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:25,949
to feel confident that we could globally launch.

589
00:42:27,234 --> 00:42:33,878
And so after these major core gameplay changes,

590
00:42:33,978 --> 00:42:36,579
we decided to focus on something else.

591
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,862
We'd now gotten all that stuff off the plate.

592
00:42:41,242 --> 00:42:46,206
Even the huge previous update had no significant impact

593
00:42:46,266 --> 00:42:46,746
on metrics.

594
00:42:47,446 --> 00:42:51,729
So instead, we released new characters, new game modes,

595
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,992
and crucially, improved social gameplay.

596
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:58,709
There was now an in-game friends list,

597
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,212
a play again functionality where you could actually

598
00:43:04,093 --> 00:43:06,134
keep playing with the same randoms

599
00:43:06,574 --> 00:43:08,476
if you found them to be a good team,

600
00:43:09,777 --> 00:43:15,501
and improvements to economy and a new focus

601
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:19,804
on rewarding the player for climbing in trophies,

602
00:43:19,904 --> 00:43:20,684
for getting better.

603
00:43:21,585 --> 00:43:23,206
So we, instead of just...

604
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:25,790
in rewarding the grind.

605
00:43:26,451 --> 00:43:32,096
Now we very visibly rewarded the players

606
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:37,841
actually getting better, winning games, and moving ahead.

607
00:43:39,602 --> 00:43:42,085
And for the first time, we kind of reversed course.

608
00:43:42,485 --> 00:43:45,467
We took rewards out of loot boxes

609
00:43:46,008 --> 00:43:52,233
and offered them as rewards for climbing trophies.

610
00:43:58,174 --> 00:44:03,719
And then in June, OK, this is the same lonely spike

611
00:44:03,759 --> 00:44:06,401
in the desert photo pic I showed before.

612
00:44:06,461 --> 00:44:15,269
But actually, it's a teaser for Brawl Stars Android launch.

613
00:44:17,831 --> 00:44:20,713
If I can point your attention to Spike's shadow,

614
00:44:21,794 --> 00:44:22,815
that's where the teaser is.

615
00:44:27,695 --> 00:44:33,278
Ever since Brawl Stars went into beta, every YouTube video

616
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:36,160
we posted, pretty much every YouTube video,

617
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,301
influencers had posted.

618
00:44:38,362 --> 00:44:46,267
Every Facebook post, pretty much every official Supercell

619
00:44:47,467 --> 00:44:50,209
Reddit post on the Brawl Stars subreddit

620
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,252
had a bunch of, where's Android?

621
00:44:54,332 --> 00:44:54,992
Where's Android?

622
00:44:55,032 --> 00:44:55,693
Where's Android?

623
00:44:56,288 --> 00:44:58,749
That was the number one question every time.

624
00:44:59,249 --> 00:45:02,390
We had a lot of followers who didn't even themselves

625
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:06,612
have an iOS device, but we're either Supercell fans

626
00:45:06,692 --> 00:45:08,472
or just wanted to play the game.

627
00:45:09,733 --> 00:45:12,974
And we're committed enough to come back and ask

628
00:45:13,354 --> 00:45:18,155
for the Android release for months and months and months.

629
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:21,816
So this smashed down the wall between.

630
00:45:23,551 --> 00:45:27,573
iOS players and their Android friends and Android-owning

631
00:45:27,633 --> 00:45:27,894
friends.

632
00:45:29,555 --> 00:45:34,177
And we actually still have organic growth

633
00:45:35,378 --> 00:45:39,340
ever since this update in some regions

634
00:45:39,381 --> 00:45:42,743
where we don't actually actively acquire new users.

635
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:50,127
So it's quite amazing what a difference it makes when you

636
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:51,428
allow people to play together.

637
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:59,729
We were, for a while before, talking about how well this

638
00:45:59,789 --> 00:46:00,970
game could do in Asia.

639
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:06,552
And so this was planned as a sort of one-two punch Hail

640
00:46:06,572 --> 00:46:11,214
Mary shot to see if Brawl Stars still had legs

641
00:46:13,134 --> 00:46:14,155
and could be viable.

642
00:46:16,656 --> 00:46:17,676
And yeah, it took us a year.

643
00:46:21,142 --> 00:46:23,444
And what was the result after June 2018?

644
00:46:23,564 --> 00:46:23,705
OK.

645
00:46:23,745 --> 00:46:34,354
I think I broke this slide.

646
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:40,200
Here we go.

647
00:46:41,501 --> 00:46:45,124
So here's what happened.

648
00:46:47,275 --> 00:46:50,678
We'd been very used to hearing, thank you, Supercell,

649
00:46:50,898 --> 00:46:54,021
on Reddit in a very sarcastic tone.

650
00:46:55,602 --> 00:46:57,984
As you can see in the top comment there,

651
00:46:59,045 --> 00:47:01,187
thank you for ruining such an amazing game.

652
00:47:02,728 --> 00:47:07,933
After the May and June updates, it basically

653
00:47:09,601 --> 00:47:15,704
took a 180 turn, and people were super excited and grateful

654
00:47:15,764 --> 00:47:20,926
for us actually listening to the community

655
00:47:21,487 --> 00:47:23,628
and providing this update.

656
00:47:27,229 --> 00:47:33,872
And with the numbers in Asia looking good,

657
00:47:35,327 --> 00:47:37,428
The game team was energized.

658
00:47:38,048 --> 00:47:43,711
Content creators had a lot more to make videos about.

659
00:47:44,311 --> 00:47:52,034
And everything looked good to go global, take that chance.

660
00:47:54,175 --> 00:47:56,516
But I'm not actually going to talk about that now.

661
00:47:57,737 --> 00:48:04,560
I'm going to leave you there and talk about some takeaways.

662
00:48:06,622 --> 00:48:07,502
from the long beta.

663
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:14,348
So first of all, I think we made a lot

664
00:48:14,408 --> 00:48:22,355
of nice, innovative designs, both in terms of controls

665
00:48:22,795 --> 00:48:26,158
and in terms of the upgrade progression systems.

666
00:48:26,758 --> 00:48:29,080
And there are still things, you know, people look back on.

667
00:48:30,121 --> 00:48:31,362
Players and game team.

668
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:44,077
members alike with some nostalgia, there's always a give and take and a compromise when you

669
00:48:44,277 --> 00:48:50,361
decide to iterate and some of the innovations still feel close to heart and might have actually

670
00:48:50,401 --> 00:48:57,746
worked if things turned out differently. However, you shouldn't be

671
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,041
afraid to fall back on proven designs,

672
00:49:02,161 --> 00:49:05,644
as we did both with the controls and the progression.

673
00:49:07,205 --> 00:49:10,227
Everybody in the team agrees that this is the best

674
00:49:10,507 --> 00:49:11,488
Brawl Stars we've had.

675
00:49:16,292 --> 00:49:19,694
The other thing is that looking at retention

676
00:49:19,914 --> 00:49:23,417
to try and gauge how much fun the players are having,

677
00:49:23,457 --> 00:49:26,980
how engaged they are, has its risks,

678
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:28,541
because.

679
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:34,062
There's a lot of things that go to such a broad metric

680
00:49:34,403 --> 00:49:35,123
as retention.

681
00:49:36,463 --> 00:49:42,746
And like we experienced with the iterations we made,

682
00:49:42,786 --> 00:49:46,887
we weren't really able to make a big dent or a big bump

683
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:49,688
with the metrics at any point.

684
00:49:50,008 --> 00:49:54,450
The first metagame iteration was upgrade progression.

685
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:57,651
Iteration was probably the best we had.

686
00:50:00,925 --> 00:50:03,867
And now this might raise a few questions,

687
00:50:04,007 --> 00:50:08,971
but at least for Supercell games, a lot of players

688
00:50:09,031 --> 00:50:10,412
know that they are playing a beta.

689
00:50:10,972 --> 00:50:14,374
So you have to be cognizant of that.

690
00:50:15,135 --> 00:50:23,120
So player behavior will change if they're unsure about where

691
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,200
the game is going.

692
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:24,721
If you don't.

693
00:50:26,772 --> 00:50:28,312
release new characters.

694
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,934
That might affect even you cohorts

695
00:50:31,214 --> 00:50:34,216
when they look back at, hey, what's this game like?

696
00:50:35,396 --> 00:50:39,159
A lot of players are very savvy and have been there

697
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:43,521
before with soft launches, especially

698
00:50:43,561 --> 00:50:45,662
a lot of the more valuable players to you,

699
00:50:45,902 --> 00:50:51,806
the most likely to engage or monetize players.

700
00:50:51,826 --> 00:50:51,866
is.

701
00:50:55,903 --> 00:51:03,307
talked about this, you should implement the most fun features of your game.

702
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:11,332
The things that you know are the best game experience and try to enhance them

703
00:51:11,913 --> 00:51:18,036
and not just believe that, okay, we've proven this or we know this intrinsically

704
00:51:18,857 --> 00:51:24,140
and we can do something else first and try to bump other stuff first.

705
00:51:27,377 --> 00:51:28,738
These could be such important...

706
00:51:32,921 --> 00:51:33,641
The most important

707
00:51:34,562 --> 00:51:37,504
fun in your game might determine the overall

708
00:51:37,824 --> 00:51:41,286
game experience so much that it ends up masking

709
00:51:42,007 --> 00:51:45,469
other improvements you might make. Now this is an assumption

710
00:51:45,929 --> 00:51:47,190
on my part, but

711
00:51:50,092 --> 00:51:51,713
I firmly believe that if we'd...

712
00:51:53,002 --> 00:51:55,464
focused on social gameplay earlier,

713
00:51:56,145 --> 00:52:00,969
we might have been out of the beta much sooner,

714
00:52:01,089 --> 00:52:03,371
or at least confident that the game is

715
00:52:03,391 --> 00:52:04,692
going to fly much sooner.

716
00:52:06,953 --> 00:52:12,598
And then finally, often when you read posts by your community,

717
00:52:13,218 --> 00:52:17,542
it can seem that they're in an echo chamber,

718
00:52:17,622 --> 00:52:22,125
just shouting out the same thing.

719
00:52:22,786 --> 00:52:27,888
and reacting to minor things that you already know

720
00:52:28,308 --> 00:52:32,290
or you feel like aren't the priority right now.

721
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:33,671
And this does happen.

722
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:39,574
But that doesn't mean that the community is always wrong.

723
00:52:39,734 --> 00:52:45,296
Actually, the community was quite right in our case.

724
00:52:45,416 --> 00:52:48,538
So it was a compass that constantly

725
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:49,878
pointed towards Android.

726
00:52:51,688 --> 00:52:54,309
And it just took us a while to navigate there.

727
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:58,971
That's my takeaways.

728
00:53:00,252 --> 00:53:02,293
But wait, there's more.

729
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:11,657
Tomorrow, Frank is going to give a talk on that final push,

730
00:53:12,337 --> 00:53:17,840
well, including the May update, some of the team dynamics.

731
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,566
of how Supercell was able to push Brawl Stars out

732
00:53:24,247 --> 00:53:28,693
and that final push towards global launch and beyond.

733
00:53:29,354 --> 00:53:30,755
So please go and check it out.

734
00:53:36,363 --> 00:53:37,064
Thanks for listening.

735
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,840
All right, any questions?

736
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:51,002
Yeah, could you go into the friends changes a little bit?

737
00:53:51,022 --> 00:53:53,184
I mean, you said you had room codes and went to friends list,

738
00:53:53,204 --> 00:53:54,845
but it was kind of like you went quick over that.

739
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:55,946
Could you go into that a little more detail?

740
00:53:56,806 --> 00:54:04,692
Sure, so we added, I kind of quickly mentioned this,

741
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:08,314
but we added a way to keep playing with friends,

742
00:54:09,855 --> 00:54:11,716
keep playing with strangers

743
00:54:14,498 --> 00:54:16,420
who you'd met in the random matchmaking queue.

744
00:54:17,617 --> 00:54:26,144
and then added them to a suggestion list where you could actually add them as permanent in-game

745
00:54:26,184 --> 00:54:32,129
friends on a friends list and then invite them easily to your game rooms in the future.

746
00:54:35,887 --> 00:54:41,310
Yeah, hi. I have already every Supercell game on this pad.

747
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:47,033
Oh, but for this, this Brawl Stars game, I'm a dead player already.

748
00:54:48,194 --> 00:54:50,175
Not your fault, maybe. I'm too busy.

749
00:54:50,655 --> 00:54:56,358
Okay. So I was playing your game earlier last year,

750
00:54:56,878 --> 00:55:03,542
and I think there is a period, actually you have advertisement which can double the loot boxes.

751
00:55:04,622 --> 00:55:11,449
and I was there and collected a lot of these rewards but suddenly I think it's cancelled.

752
00:55:12,489 --> 00:55:19,476
Do you think it's unsuccessful or it's like you try to find another way to get income from this

753
00:55:19,536 --> 00:55:30,766
game? So you're talking about the coin or token doublers? Yeah, I think you tried but you cancelled

754
00:55:31,979 --> 00:55:37,381
Yeah, we thought there were two different systems that were overlapping at that stage,

755
00:55:37,661 --> 00:55:39,181
and we decided to keep just one.

756
00:55:39,722 --> 00:55:42,903
The one that was more easily understood by players.

757
00:55:43,643 --> 00:55:46,884
You know, not the time-based, we got rid of the time-based one

758
00:55:47,284 --> 00:55:49,645
and kept the one that had a very clear...

759
00:55:51,506 --> 00:55:58,954
you know, a system where this is how many coins or tokens you'll keep doubling in the future.

760
00:55:59,214 --> 00:56:05,741
So yeah, it was also not that well received by players.

761
00:56:05,901 --> 00:56:09,966
We didn't get so many sales on the time-based one.

762
00:56:16,183 --> 00:56:17,584
Hello, thanks for the talk.

763
00:56:18,165 --> 00:56:23,289
On my side I played a lot of Brawl Stars with Swain locally because I think it's really important to communicate to play effectively.

764
00:56:23,769 --> 00:56:28,532
But you don't have any in-game way of communicating, no emotes, no voice recording.

765
00:56:28,973 --> 00:56:33,416
Is this something that you have tested and cut or is it something that you plan to integrate in the game?

766
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:36,858
Yeah, it's another thing we've been talking about for a long time.

767
00:56:36,878 --> 00:56:43,743
I think it would go into that social gameplay section that we were very slow in starting to implement or improve.

768
00:56:45,172 --> 00:56:45,452
Thanks.

769
00:56:48,193 --> 00:56:51,795
For me, I had a question about the general vision

770
00:56:51,855 --> 00:56:53,935
and design philosophy towards the Elder game.

771
00:56:54,356 --> 00:56:57,177
Because it's something I found lacking in both Clash Royale

772
00:56:57,217 --> 00:56:59,197
and Brawl Stars, that once you get your cards,

773
00:56:59,437 --> 00:57:01,238
if you don't want to rank on the leaderboard,

774
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:03,039
you really don't have something to do.

775
00:57:03,399 --> 00:57:07,000
And you definitely see that in your version

776
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:10,041
of the progression bar, where after about 1,000 trophies,

777
00:57:10,061 --> 00:57:12,522
there's just very little content that you get from it.

778
00:57:13,436 --> 00:57:15,197
So yeah, I just wanted to know your design thoughts

779
00:57:15,297 --> 00:57:15,958
on the Elder game.

780
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,482
I'm not sure if I understood.

781
00:57:20,502 --> 00:57:21,222
Can you rephrase?

782
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:21,723
Sure.

783
00:57:21,903 --> 00:57:24,945
So after you progress a certain amount in the game,

784
00:57:25,506 --> 00:57:26,727
and you've got all the characters,

785
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:28,488
maybe you've got a couple of the star powers,

786
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:30,890
there's really nothing for you to do because you're

787
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:31,350
kind of done.

788
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:32,291
All right.

789
00:57:32,311 --> 00:57:39,737
So we're looking at ways to give you more sort of.

790
00:57:42,848 --> 00:57:45,149
More goals when you're climbing in trophies,

791
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:49,570
instead of focusing just on the stuff you can collect

792
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:51,910
from loot boxes or buying from the shop.

793
00:57:52,631 --> 00:57:55,692
So ever since the May update with the trophy road,

794
00:57:55,932 --> 00:57:57,612
that's been a focus for us.

795
00:57:58,172 --> 00:58:01,173
And now we're looking at ways to make it more sustainable,

796
00:58:01,553 --> 00:58:05,234
where it doesn't feel like you hit the ceiling.

797
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,935
So we're looking at different options for that.

798
00:58:09,316 --> 00:58:10,176
And definitely the...

799
00:58:10,736 --> 00:58:13,878
the focus is now going to be on the trophies next.

800
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:17,961
And obviously we're going to add more characters and add more...

801
00:58:19,282 --> 00:58:22,163
Well, obviously with every character there's going to be another star power.

802
00:58:22,924 --> 00:58:26,586
And so the content will keep coming

803
00:58:27,027 --> 00:58:32,630
and also we're looking at ways to improve the trophy grind as well.

804
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:33,771
Got it. Cool, thank you.

805
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:34,191
Thanks.

806
00:58:37,198 --> 00:58:40,879
So thank you a lot for your talk, it was very interesting.

807
00:58:41,959 --> 00:58:44,920
I'm Marie, I work on The Elder Scrolls Blades,

808
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:52,921
and it was really interesting to see all the adventures you had with landscape and portrait.

809
00:58:53,641 --> 00:58:57,162
I kind of gave a talk about that on Monday,

810
00:58:57,182 --> 00:59:01,943
and as you may know, Bethesda decided, because there was no clear winner,

811
00:59:02,663 --> 00:59:09,526
For very similar reasons than the ones you said, we decided to allow players to basically

812
00:59:10,067 --> 00:59:15,249
flip their phones when they want, so we removed the orientation lock, and I was wondering

813
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:19,611
if you had considered it and why you didn't retain the idea.

814
00:59:22,032 --> 00:59:22,252
Right.

815
00:59:23,332 --> 00:59:28,475
So for Brawl Stars being a competitive multiplayer game, it's...

816
00:59:29,894 --> 00:59:33,217
really important that the players are on a level playing field.

817
00:59:34,058 --> 00:59:34,238
Yeah.

818
00:59:34,598 --> 00:59:37,841
And even now we have to do some compromises when it comes to

819
00:59:38,862 --> 00:59:41,544
very wide aspect ratios,

820
00:59:42,065 --> 00:59:44,267
where some of the screen is covered,

821
00:59:44,887 --> 00:59:45,808
you don't have vision there.

822
00:59:46,428 --> 00:59:49,931
If we had both portrait and landscape at the same time,

823
00:59:50,492 --> 00:59:53,234
we would basically need to have a square in the middle

824
00:59:53,935 --> 00:59:56,537
and lose most of the screen real estate

825
00:59:56,657 --> 00:59:57,598
to be able to make it.

826
00:59:58,439 --> 01:00:02,582
fair and even for everyone. It makes a lot of sense. Thank you. Thanks.

827
01:00:05,017 --> 01:00:07,977
I had a question about your early internal playtesting.

828
01:00:07,997 --> 01:00:08,358
Yes.

829
01:00:08,398 --> 01:00:14,159
How many characters and modes you needed to put in there

830
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:17,600
before internal playtesting started to be a lot more fun?

831
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:19,721
Was it probably a lot more than one?

832
01:00:20,081 --> 01:00:21,621
And so that's the question.

833
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:22,001
Right.

834
01:00:22,441 --> 01:00:25,242
So we went to beta with 16 characters.

835
01:00:25,642 --> 01:00:31,164
I think the early, well, you saw actually the character

836
01:00:31,184 --> 01:00:31,804
selection screen.

837
01:00:33,971 --> 01:00:35,051
there earlier on.

838
01:00:35,551 --> 01:00:35,932
And I could cheat.

839
01:00:35,952 --> 01:00:38,332
But even before beta, internally.

840
01:00:38,432 --> 01:00:42,193
Yeah, so these are both internal playtests here.

841
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:46,095
We had six characters in this playtest.

842
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:51,816
And in this one, we had, let me just start it.

843
01:00:54,677 --> 01:00:55,137
Only five.

844
01:00:56,858 --> 01:00:56,998
So.

845
01:00:58,659 --> 01:01:01,721
And this was the game mode in most of the playtests

846
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:02,742
internally.

847
01:01:03,522 --> 01:01:08,265
We only added a second game mode, I think, for the final

848
01:01:08,705 --> 01:01:09,506
internal playtest.

849
01:01:11,118 --> 01:01:12,359
And one clarification question.

850
01:01:12,399 --> 01:01:14,481
It sounded like you were saying that all of these

851
01:01:14,541 --> 01:01:16,822
changes to the meta and controls barely moved the

852
01:01:16,862 --> 01:01:20,385
metrics, and it was really the social changes that

853
01:01:20,565 --> 01:01:21,566
moved everything.

854
01:01:21,766 --> 01:01:22,006
Yeah.

855
01:01:22,146 --> 01:01:27,630
Well, social we can only assume because, well, even

856
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:31,874
after we improved the social gameplay, we didn't see a

857
01:01:32,014 --> 01:01:35,456
massive bump in the previous beta country.

858
01:01:35,516 --> 01:01:39,319
So I don't know if we burned out our user base, what

859
01:01:39,439 --> 01:01:40,240
exactly happened there.

860
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,405
But luckily we launched in Asia as well and got a fresh new place,

861
01:01:46,546 --> 01:01:51,892
especially in Singapore where we had amazing numbers compared to before.

862
01:01:52,432 --> 01:01:59,900
So yeah, one of the progression iterations did give a nice bump in day 30 retention though.

863
01:02:00,761 --> 01:02:01,402
Okay, cool. Thank you.

864
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:07,571
Hi, so if I'm understanding your monetization and progression systems appropriately,

865
01:02:07,611 --> 01:02:11,873
it seems like a core part of it is unlocking new characters and then upgrading those characters,

866
01:02:12,373 --> 01:02:15,694
which seems to be a little bit at odds with, at least for new players,

867
01:02:15,734 --> 01:02:19,255
the gameplay of wanting to master a character,

868
01:02:19,795 --> 01:02:22,616
which for a skill-based game seems like it would be more of an element

869
01:02:22,676 --> 01:02:26,498
than games with the lower skill ceiling in the industry.

870
01:02:26,838 --> 01:02:30,519
Do you guys see that tension as a problem to be solved, something to improve,

871
01:02:30,779 --> 01:02:32,260
or are you happy with where it's at?

872
01:02:34,536 --> 01:02:39,923
So the question is about the amount of skill cap we built in?

873
01:02:41,265 --> 01:02:47,192
The idea that some players are going to want to sort of master a character, play a solo or master, versus unlocking new ones.

874
01:02:47,373 --> 01:02:47,873
I got it, thank you.

875
01:02:50,855 --> 01:02:51,595
One more question, OK.

876
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:54,178
So I'll try to answer this quickly and give one more.

877
01:02:54,598 --> 01:03:00,583
So we see this happening, and it's not the optimal way

878
01:03:00,623 --> 01:03:01,204
to play the game.

879
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:06,308
Actually, you'll get a lot less rewards and progression

880
01:03:06,348 --> 01:03:07,309
in the game if you do that.

881
01:03:07,729 --> 01:03:10,852
So we're hoping that the system where you share trophies

882
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:15,487
Well, each character has individual trophies,

883
01:03:16,267 --> 01:03:20,989
and it's easier to progress early on with every new character.

884
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:25,372
Eventually, it will drive people not to main a certain character

885
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:26,672
or focus on a certain character,

886
01:03:27,052 --> 01:03:30,354
but try to play the game in a different way

887
01:03:30,514 --> 01:03:31,695
from maybe what they're used to,

888
01:03:32,495 --> 01:03:35,857
because the game itself has a wide variety of different events,

889
01:03:36,637 --> 01:03:38,218
and you...

890
01:03:38,839 --> 01:03:44,352
should learn to play at least, you know, several, four or five archetypes of character

891
01:03:44,592 --> 01:03:47,779
to be able to be competitive and play in a team game.

892
01:03:50,845 --> 01:03:52,046
Hope that answers your question.

893
01:03:52,066 --> 01:03:53,648
I have more, but I'm going to take it.

894
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:53,768
OK.

895
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:54,088
Thank you.

896
01:03:54,628 --> 01:03:55,729
Yeah, hi.

897
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:55,789
Hi.

898
01:03:55,829 --> 01:03:56,530
Great talk today.

899
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:56,930
Thanks.

900
01:03:56,970 --> 01:04:02,775
We already know that you have a soft launch for a long time

901
01:04:02,855 --> 01:04:03,476
for these games.

902
01:04:03,996 --> 01:04:07,299
And we also know that you queue a lot of games

903
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,321
before even they come out in your company.

904
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:09,721
Sure.

905
01:04:10,121 --> 01:04:12,683
And so my question is, when it comes to the decision,

906
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:13,564
will it continue to?

907
01:04:14,578 --> 01:04:20,141
make adjustment or just give up and move on to another game, what factor do you consider?

908
01:04:21,081 --> 01:04:28,986
Before going into beta, the team decides if they feel like the game has a chance.

909
01:04:30,447 --> 01:04:33,369
Also, the internal testing company playables,

910
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:36,512
they give very important feedback

911
01:04:36,812 --> 01:04:40,855
from the whole company to the team as a sanity check

912
01:04:42,076 --> 01:04:46,240
to see if the company shares that feeling

913
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,761
or the other employees share that feeling.

914
01:04:48,261 --> 01:04:53,306
But essentially, it's the team who decides to go to beta.

915
01:04:54,346 --> 01:04:56,548
So obviously,

916
01:04:58,442 --> 01:05:05,105
we trust, it has to be based on trust, so we trust every team to be realistic in their

917
01:05:05,145 --> 01:05:12,708
expectations and if the team feels strongly that the game is ready for soft launch, we

918
01:05:12,728 --> 01:05:17,870
go to soft launch and then after that basically the players decide.

919
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:19,210
Thank you.

920
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:22,992
Okay, thank you very much for coming.
