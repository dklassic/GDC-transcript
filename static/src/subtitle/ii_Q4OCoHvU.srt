1
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:04,670
So my name is Greg Street.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,551
I head design on League of Legends.

3
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:08,853
Players call me Ghostcrawler.

4
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:11,555
They call me worse things as well, but we'll get to that.

5
00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:14,637
I've been asked to remind you about keeping an eye on your

6
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:16,939
phones and filling out the review forms at the end of

7
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:17,339
the session.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,481
And here we go.

9
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:23,724
So I want to start by explaining the title, Balancing

10
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:25,645
League for Every Player from Bronze to Bengi.

11
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:28,187
This is Bronze.

12
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:31,149
Within ranked League of Legends, there are seven

13
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,589
tiers.

14
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:32,630
Bronze is the first one.

15
00:00:34,265 --> 00:00:36,447
And at the opposite end of the spectrum, this is Bengi.

16
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:38,589
His name is Bae Seong-Eun.

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,872
He's currently the jungler for a Chinese e-sports team

18
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:42,573
named Vici.

19
00:00:43,054 --> 00:00:45,336
But he's better known as a three-time world champion

20
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:47,518
with Korean team SKT.

21
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,640
He's very good at League of Legends.

22
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:51,632
So this is the challenge.

23
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:55,255
How do you balance a game where the skill differential

24
00:00:55,435 --> 00:00:58,117
between players isn't like 10% or 20%,

25
00:00:58,437 --> 00:00:59,438
it's 1,000%, 10,000%.

26
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:03,921
The pros of League are exponentially better

27
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:05,082
than people just starting out.

28
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:08,804
And this is me.

29
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:11,946
I started life as an oceanographer.

30
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:14,768
That actually isn't me, but that's the kind of stuff I did,

31
00:01:14,828 --> 00:01:16,530
dropping muddy things off the back of boats.

32
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,111
It was before digital cameras.

33
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:23,642
I got my start in game design working on the Age of Empires franchise where I was at

34
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:24,883
Ensemble Studios for ten years.

35
00:01:26,844 --> 00:01:30,707
From there I went on to World of Warcraft where I led systems design for about six

36
00:01:30,727 --> 00:01:30,967
years.

37
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:35,811
And I've been at Riot Games working on League of Legends for the past three years.

38
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:40,495
On all three of these franchises I either oversaw balance directly or was

39
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:42,837
accountable for it. I've been doing this a long time.

40
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:44,678
I like to nerf things.

41
00:01:47,143 --> 00:01:50,166
I use a crab as my avatar, getting back to the Marine theme.

42
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:51,647
This is Ghostcrawler.

43
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:52,807
This is Ghostcrawler.

44
00:01:53,328 --> 00:01:55,189
And more recently, I've switched to the Rift Scuttler.

45
00:01:58,011 --> 00:01:58,992
And this is League of Legends.

46
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:02,014
Hopefully, most of you are familiar with this, and that's why you came.

47
00:02:02,474 --> 00:02:07,478
But just in case, it is a 5v5 MOBA, free to play with cosmetic content.

48
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:10,480
We like to think of it looking like the image on the left,

49
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,081
but of course, it actually looks like the image on the right.

50
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:16,177
I'm going to use a lot of League examples in the talk today, but not everything.

51
00:02:16,197 --> 00:02:18,038
And I'll mention some other games as well.

52
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:22,420
My hope is that this topic is broadly applicable to the kind of games you guys work on

53
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,301
and not just a story of League of Legends.

54
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,584
And this is a champion. This is Leona the champion.

55
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:31,985
League has 134 champions. We add new ones every year.

56
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:37,711
Champion is a unique character with a passive and four different abilities.

57
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:40,393
We often abbreviate these abilities QWER,

58
00:02:40,814 --> 00:02:43,617
which I say because I'm going to end up calling them QWER.

59
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:45,059
That's just our shorthand.

60
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,741
I'm going to talk a lot about champion balance,

61
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:50,324
because champions are kind of the basic molecule

62
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:52,406
by which players interact with League of Legends.

63
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:55,810
So a lot of the balance considerations that we deal with are about champions.

64
00:02:58,403 --> 00:03:01,045
So my topic outline, why is balance important?

65
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:03,206
I'm going to cover this super quickly because I'm going to

66
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:05,026
make the assumption you guys are kind of on board with this

67
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:05,747
concept already.

68
00:03:06,847 --> 00:03:09,308
How we balance for different skill levels, balance for a

69
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:11,689
massive audience, and then finally, I'm going to spend

70
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:14,811
the majority of the talk talking about how tactically

71
00:03:14,871 --> 00:03:16,652
how does Riot balance League day to day.

72
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:18,733
And I'll try to end with plenty of time for questions.

73
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:22,014
So why is balance important?

74
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:29,080
I like the definition that Game Balance is a contract with the player.

75
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:34,665
Because contract implies a business transaction where players are getting goods and services for their payment.

76
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:40,010
And it can be literal payment if they're purchasing a character, but it doesn't have to be real money.

77
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:44,954
If you play a warlock in World of Warcraft, you may have 10 years invested in that character,

78
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:48,758
and you want some guarantee that Game Balance isn't going to stop you from playing her.

79
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:55,086
Now League is a competitive PvP game with a very, very small PvE component.

80
00:03:55,847 --> 00:03:57,808
And skill in League is supposed to matter.

81
00:03:57,868 --> 00:04:01,711
This is why players play League of Legends, to demonstrate their skill.

82
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,293
And we don't ever want the state of balance to trump skill.

83
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:13,438
When you have a game that's imbalanced, it makes it too easy to solve the game.

84
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:17,161
And if you have a game that is very solvable, players tend to get bored.

85
00:04:17,181 --> 00:04:19,642
And when players tend to get bored, they stop playing your game.

86
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:22,970
Options are also really good for longevity.

87
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:25,495
If you have a game like League that we hope that players

88
00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:28,961
interact with for a long time, once they get tired of playing

89
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,064
one champion, there's a lot of other ones out there that they

90
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:31,625
can try out.

91
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:37,131
Now, Riot as a company cares a lot about player trust.

92
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:39,313
This is something we focus on a lot.

93
00:04:39,594 --> 00:04:41,916
We try to be very player focused in every decision we make.

94
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:45,579
And if the game is in an imbalanced state for too long,

95
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,921
that kind of suggests to the players that we don't care.

96
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:50,123
And so it's kind of violating, you know,

97
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:52,566
trying to hold up player trust as being so important.

98
00:04:55,568 --> 00:04:57,770
Now, tragically, balance is really hard.

99
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,391
And as important as it is for your game and for players,

100
00:05:01,772 --> 00:05:03,252
the development cost is super high.

101
00:05:03,272 --> 00:05:06,073
And I'm going to talk throughout the rest of the talk about why this is

102
00:05:06,593 --> 00:05:08,874
and some strategies and tactics that may help you mitigate it.

103
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:13,816
So balance for different skill levels, part two.

104
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:19,178
This is what a pro championship of League of Legends looks like.

105
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,980
Pros can do amazing things that we mere mortals cannot possibly conceive of doing.

106
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,983
And balance at high skill level, and especially at pro skill level,

107
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:30,905
is really different from balance for the rest of the game,

108
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:32,086
and certainly for newer players.

109
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:36,890
And I'm going to talk about some of these differences that manifest in any game

110
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,713
that make it difficult to balance for extreme skill differentiation.

111
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,557
So, next few slides I'm just coming at you with a list, be forewarned.

112
00:05:45,617 --> 00:05:47,859
Some of these are differences you don't want to avoid necessarily,

113
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:48,920
but you do want to be aware of them.

114
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:56,381
So to start off, you can break down player skills being tested in a game into a lot of different buckets.

115
00:05:56,461 --> 00:06:01,465
Things like good decision making, good team communication, fast reflexes, and so forth.

116
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:05,668
Now one of the biggest differences between highly skilled and normal skilled players

117
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:07,349
comes in execution difficulty.

118
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,513
As developers, we sometimes balance, often balance, the power of an ability

119
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:14,715
with it being difficult for a player to pull off.

120
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:19,319
So this is a basic skill shot, League of Legends is full of them, rather than...

121
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:24,632
clicking on the enemy target with your mouse and then just hitting a button that will always hit them,

122
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:28,794
you have to line up the attack and take into consideration things like, you know,

123
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:31,354
leading them, predicting where the enemy's going to be, and so forth.

124
00:06:35,676 --> 00:06:40,937
But it's not just skill shots. Anything involving timing or multitasking or often just the speed of clicking,

125
00:06:40,957 --> 00:06:43,978
you know, APM, is much easier for highly skilled players.

126
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:48,938
Some of the ultimates in League of Legends, the R ability, are channeled.

127
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:52,981
And a channeled ability, you can think of the champion as like winding up, casting a spell.

128
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:57,765
And during that time, if they get interrupted, it either cancels a spell outright or it might have a diminished effect.

129
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:01,849
This is Fiddlesticks, our evil, magical scarecrow.

130
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:07,314
He has an ult called Crowstorm where he summons a lot of crows, but he does have to channel it.

131
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:08,795
And this is the kind of thing that...

132
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:14,525
makes it a little harder to use at the pro level because, or even at highly skilled players,

133
00:07:14,585 --> 00:07:16,106
because it will get interrupted.

134
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:18,907
You have to keep in mind when you're talking about these, you know,

135
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:22,089
1% of skilled players,

136
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:25,410
anything whose cost is easy to interrupt is going to be interrupted.

137
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:28,912
And anything whose cost is hard to pull off, they will pull off.

138
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:33,630
It's not just feats of dexterity, though.

139
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,114
Skilled players understand the higher-level strategies of the game as well.

140
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:39,577
They can pull from a lot of knowledge,

141
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:43,442
including knowing strengths and weaknesses of champions almost reflexively.

142
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,390
This is Garen.

143
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:49,394
He is very powerful at the lower tiers of League of Legends

144
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:51,616
and not so successful at the higher tiers.

145
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:54,638
He likes to hide in bushes and spin around in circles,

146
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,220
which players call spin to win.

147
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,882
It's very effective if you don't know how to get out of it.

148
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:01,244
At higher level, you can crowd control him

149
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:02,165
and it kind of shuts him down.

150
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,507
We'll talk a little more about Garen in a minute.

151
00:08:07,374 --> 00:08:09,615
So, going way back to my roots at the Age of Empires,

152
00:08:09,835 --> 00:08:12,516
this is one of the first balanced nemesis I ever faced.

153
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:15,297
Two of the most powerful traits you can give

154
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:19,379
a unit character champion are long range and fast movement.

155
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,480
And the two together is amazing.

156
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,321
Cavalry archers were the bane of my existence

157
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:25,181
on Age of Empires.

158
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:27,362
There's a reason the Mongols were so effective with them.

159
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,404
You run up, you shoot, you run away.

160
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:31,944
They're experts at kiting.

161
00:08:31,964 --> 00:08:34,245
It makes it very difficult for other units

162
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:35,806
or other players to be able to catch up with them.

163
00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:42,576
This extends to League of Legends. We have champions like Vayne and Lucian who are highly mobile yet ranged.

164
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:48,862
And skilled players who are great at micromanagement are going to be able to do a lot of damage with never having to take damage themselves.

165
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:55,879
Now this is an interesting one. Most league players experience the game solo.

166
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,062
We have matchmaking. We'll find you a team and we'll find you an enemy team.

167
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:02,465
But organized play is a very different experience.

168
00:09:02,505 --> 00:09:04,867
And of course anything professional is organized play.

169
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:07,549
These guys play together all the time. They have plays.

170
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,491
They can almost read each other's minds.

171
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:13,514
You think of like a buddy cop movie where the two cops enter a building

172
00:09:13,534 --> 00:09:15,876
and they immediately know to cover each other's blind spots.

173
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:23,766
Lowelow, on the other hand, because they don't have the guarantee that someone's going to help defend them,

174
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:27,728
tend to gravitate more towards generalists.

175
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:31,009
This cute critter here is Kog'Maw. He's a classic glass cannon.

176
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:35,031
He can do a ton of damage at range, but if you get up in his face, he crumbles very quickly.

177
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:40,813
And as you might imagine, it's difficult for players in solo queue to be able to effectively utilize him

178
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,294
because they just don't know that their team's going to be there backing them up.

179
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:50,135
Highly skilled players are really good at manipulating your economy,

180
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:54,738
and getting an economic advantage in any game can often be really powerful.

181
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,021
In League of Legends, we see this as gold funneling.

182
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:01,884
So basically, in League, you kill things, you get gold,

183
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:03,966
use the gold to buy more items to get powerful.

184
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:07,228
And the idea is that everyone kind of rises in power as the game goes on,

185
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:08,990
and more skilled players rise a little faster.

186
00:10:09,951 --> 00:10:12,894
But skilled players, we see this definitely with pros,

187
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:15,877
can kind of have a lot of the team avoid getting gold

188
00:10:15,897 --> 00:10:18,040
to make sure that one player gets a lot of gold early.

189
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,962
So they have this really powerful spike,

190
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:22,184
and even though it's only one player on the team,

191
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,966
they can leverage that to get an advantage.

192
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:30,227
In World of Warcraft, we would see this with the high-end guilds when they would raid,

193
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:34,170
would do things like, we're going to pass all the gear to the main tank or to, you know,

194
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,031
a really important DPS character.

195
00:10:36,471 --> 00:10:41,435
And this got to the point of running alt raids, where a group would run a raid,

196
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:44,217
all the gear would go to one player while everyone else was on their alt,

197
00:10:44,237 --> 00:10:47,400
they'd switch to the next player and so on and so on, using different raid instances.

198
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,342
It's hard to stop, it's hard to design around that,

199
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:54,925
but it makes balance very difficult for these high-end raiding guilds.

200
00:10:59,024 --> 00:10:59,964
AI-dependent power.

201
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:02,487
We love to put turrets in our games.

202
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:06,091
So here is Heimerdinger from League of Legends, Torbjorn

203
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:08,673
from Overwatch, and the engineer from Team Fortress.

204
00:11:09,963 --> 00:11:13,847
The problem with AI power, in this case the turrets, but it also could be like

205
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:15,528
your character has a pet.

206
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,192
AI power just doesn't scale really well with skill level.

207
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:21,515
If you think of the power as a pie chart,

208
00:11:21,935 --> 00:11:25,819
the AI part of that power takes up a big part of that pie chart. It doesn't really

209
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:28,502
change depending on whether you're talking at lower or high skill level.

210
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:32,984
So as developers, we have to kind of choose where we're going to tune those turrets.

211
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:35,965
And if we tune them to be very, very powerful at high end,

212
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:37,966
they're just going to crush lower end players.

213
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:40,587
On the other hand, if you do what most of us do and make them

214
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,008
relatively reasonably fair at lower levels,

215
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:45,670
at high levels, they're just not going to see them get much play.

216
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,301
Strong windowed power. This is one of those cases where as developers we often

217
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:59,363
make the cost of like, yeah, we're going to give you a lot of power but it's going to last for a really, really short period of time.

218
00:12:00,683 --> 00:12:05,145
The more skilled players won't waste that time. Even if it's a really small window, they can get a lot out of that.

219
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:10,226
This wormy looking monster here is Baron Nashor from League of Legends.

220
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:14,107
When your team kills him, you get a buff to sieging the enemy base,

221
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,868
which is a great way to shut down a game.

222
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:17,408
And at high end...

223
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,834
Baron absolutely decides whether a game is won or lost.

224
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:25,599
But lower skilled players can easily waste this buff.

225
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,681
They die, they don't get their group coordinated,

226
00:12:27,721 --> 00:12:29,964
the buff eventually ticks away before they're able to leverage it.

227
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:36,902
In World of Warcraft, shamans have an ability called Bloodlust, which increases group haste for the entire group.

228
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:42,767
And skilled teams are really good at uniting all of their cooldowns to fire off at once.

229
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:45,769
Your trinkets, whatever your personal DPS or healing cooldowns are.

230
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:52,355
And I'm sure this still happens, the groups will all line up and pop their cooldowns at once for a gigantic power spike.

231
00:12:53,496 --> 00:12:56,418
Particularly at the start of the fight when everyone's still at 100%.

232
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:02,500
Be really, really careful of your early game.

233
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,601
This is a great opportunity for skilled players to get an

234
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:08,403
advantage that later snowballs and makes them impossible to

235
00:13:08,443 --> 00:13:09,164
stop later on.

236
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:12,325
This goes along with the cost of, but you might make a

237
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:14,587
mistake, because the more skilled the players are, the

238
00:13:14,647 --> 00:13:16,088
less likely they are to make a mistake.

239
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:18,349
Their gameplay really can kind of approach perfection.

240
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,451
In regular play, someone has a chance to get back in.

241
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:23,832
But at high-skilled play, the game may be over as soon as

242
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:25,333
someone gets a slight advantage early on.

243
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:28,990
You see this in real-time strategy games, too, like Age

244
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,932
of Empires or StarCraft, where a small economic advantage

245
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:34,013
earlier just pays lots and lots of dividends

246
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:34,653
by the late game.

247
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:39,376
So I've talked most of it game design.

248
00:13:39,396 --> 00:13:41,898
But let's not forget, we're mostly talking about software

249
00:13:41,918 --> 00:13:42,999
running on hardware.

250
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,360
And there are limitations.

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,823
We recently did a study to look at play rates and win

252
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:52,124
rates of certain league champions according to

253
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,966
different ping rates.

254
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:55,286
And we found that.

255
00:13:56,722 --> 00:13:58,382
We found that the, it's back.

256
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,883
A place like Korea, which has a really good internet,

257
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:04,704
actually allowed players to use different champions

258
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:06,684
and have different win rates than maybe somewhere

259
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:09,805
like the US where everyone's bouncing off

260
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:11,065
the same servers in Chicago.

261
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,886
You can mitigate this a little bit by doing things

262
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:16,987
like making sure there's a little bit of space,

263
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:19,207
like instead of giving players a fraction of a second

264
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:22,748
to execute a command, you can extend that to half a second

265
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:24,309
or something like that, which may help

266
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:25,829
overcome latency problems.

267
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:32,278
So this is a pretty nuanced issue I'll try to walk through.

268
00:14:33,578 --> 00:14:35,540
Tactical errors at extreme peaks of skill

269
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,522
tend to be really rare, which means that who wins

270
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:40,863
can often come down to who makes a mistake first.

271
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:44,205
Like, two teams are playing perfectly, somebody misclicks,

272
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:46,006
and that is the entire game ending right there.

273
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:48,308
It can be really exciting as a viewer,

274
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:50,289
but you're kind of left with this hollow feeling

275
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:52,690
that it really wasn't the more skilled team that won,

276
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:55,472
it was just the person who didn't make a mistake.

277
00:14:56,711 --> 00:15:05,638
So my lesson here is make sure that you have high-level strategies that high-level, high-skilled players can exploit, as well as tactical considerations.

278
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:11,422
By tactics, I'm talking about things like where you're positioning your character, when you're, you know, using your different abilities.

279
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:18,588
High-level strategy is more about, do we want to have a, you know, an early power advantage, do we want to try to sneak in their base, are we going to split lanes, things like that.

280
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:22,150
If you have higher-level strategy, the game won't just come down to misclicking.

281
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:30,555
So I highlighted some of the differences in trying to

282
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:32,056
balance for both highly skilled and

283
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:33,096
normal skilled players.

284
00:15:33,657 --> 00:15:35,338
But now we're going to make that even more complicated by

285
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:36,959
layering on the effects of a mass audience.

286
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,103
Any competitive game, any PVP game, is going to have a skill

287
00:15:43,123 --> 00:15:44,123
differential among players.

288
00:15:44,604 --> 00:15:47,145
If you're a small indie developer and you have a small

289
00:15:47,185 --> 00:15:48,826
player group, there's still going to be an enormous

290
00:15:48,846 --> 00:15:51,148
disparity in their ability to play your game.

291
00:15:52,392 --> 00:15:54,293
But League of Legends has about 100 million players.

292
00:15:54,874 --> 00:15:56,675
So that skill differential can get really large.

293
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:59,456
Our bell curve has really long tails at both ends.

294
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,799
And on top of that, we make our lives extra hard.

295
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,061
He's saying the guy controlling the other five

296
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:08,721
units almost won.

297
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,841
Because in League, everyone plays by the same rules.

298
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:16,965
This is different from, say, basketball, where the point

299
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:19,487
lines will change depending whether you're at amateur

300
00:16:19,507 --> 00:16:21,789
college or pro play, or a game like golf where there are

301
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:24,711
different tee boxes that different players will use.

302
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:29,815
This is important to us because there's a virtuous

303
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:33,258
cycle in League of people viewing the game and then

304
00:16:33,298 --> 00:16:35,060
playing the game and wanting to view the game again.

305
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,222
And by viewing, this could be e-sports or streaming or any

306
00:16:39,163 --> 00:16:40,404
games players are watching on the internet.

307
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:46,442
If you're an Asghar fan, chances are good that you're not out racing cars on the weekends.

308
00:16:46,762 --> 00:16:47,663
I don't know, maybe some of you are.

309
00:16:47,863 --> 00:16:52,407
But most people, that's kind of a sport they participate in as viewers, not necessarily as participants.

310
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,014
We think this is important because in League, players look to the pros to get better.

311
00:17:00,414 --> 00:17:04,417
If I'm trying to learn jungling, I might look at, you know, what are the kind of items that Bengi picks.

312
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,558
He certainly knows what he's doing.

313
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:08,909
And there's also this aspiration of the path to pro.

314
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,335
Doesn't apply to me, because I'm old and my reflexes are shot.

315
00:17:12,796 --> 00:17:14,900
But for younger players, they have this promise

316
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,583
that if they just get good enough at League of Legends,

317
00:17:16,623 --> 00:17:17,705
they may make it to the big leagues

318
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,388
and someone may pick them up for their e-sports team.

319
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,911
As an aside though, I just want to offer a counterexample that

320
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:29,292
while messy, multiple rulesets do have some benefits.

321
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:32,614
We get into situations sometimes as developers where

322
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,254
the problems are really over-constrained.

323
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:38,156
Like, we can't buff this unit for the high end because it's

324
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:40,117
already too dominant, but players at the low end can't

325
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:40,917
necessarily use it.

326
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:43,178
I just want to throw that out there, that it's not

327
00:17:43,198 --> 00:17:45,919
necessarily cut and dry, that one ruleset is the

328
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,379
only way to go.

329
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:56,063
So I'm going to spend the rest of the talk talking at a very

330
00:17:56,103 --> 00:17:59,985
tactical level about how Riot balances League of Legends

331
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:00,866
with all of that in mind.

332
00:18:01,926 --> 00:18:03,387
This is the secret sauce.

333
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:06,389
I'm going to try to be as frank as I can about what we do

334
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:08,450
behind the scenes, because that's why we all

335
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,151
come to GDC, right?

336
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,481
So first, we have a philosophy.

337
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:18,023
And I really encourage you to get your studio, your team,

338
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:20,705
your designers aligned on your goals and values.

339
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:23,387
Not just as a development studio, but on individual

340
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:24,167
projects as well.

341
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:27,429
If you have a shared philosophy, it really helps to

342
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:28,610
arbitrate the tough calls.

343
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,612
You aren't debating, are we OK with this, kind of in the

344
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,212
heat of the moment.

345
00:18:32,432 --> 00:18:34,033
You already know what good looks like.

346
00:18:34,094 --> 00:18:36,315
So then when you're missing that target, you can react.

347
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,518
It also provides precedence for the teams of tomorrow.

348
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:44,500
Game development tends to be a highly mobile career.

349
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,822
People will leave studios or leave teams

350
00:18:47,962 --> 00:18:49,242
or move to different teams.

351
00:18:49,702 --> 00:18:52,644
And I feel like we spend a lot of our time doing archaeology,

352
00:18:52,684 --> 00:18:55,545
like trying to understand why did the developers who

353
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:58,066
worked on this game two years ago make this particular decision.

354
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:01,748
So if you have goals and values that you can particularly

355
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:04,649
publish someplace and make sure the whole company understands,

356
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:06,670
it can help to mitigate some of that.

357
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,082
So for example, these are the league design values.

358
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:12,403
I won't go through them all here,

359
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:14,645
but we do make sure that the changes we make

360
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:16,107
are aligned with these values.

361
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:20,371
The idea is that hopefully we're making the game better

362
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:22,373
over time rather than just doing this kind of

363
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:24,315
one step forward, two step back thing where,

364
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:26,557
oh, we made a change, oh, that was a bad change,

365
00:19:26,577 --> 00:19:28,439
let's make another change, oh, that was another bad change.

366
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,641
I mean, don't get me wrong, that still happens for sure,

367
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:33,343
but the intent is that we're making progress.

368
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:35,779
And it's not just design values.

369
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:36,900
Riot has values.

370
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,041
League of Legends as a product has values.

371
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:41,083
There are values for particular, you know,

372
00:19:41,123 --> 00:19:42,043
very small project.

373
00:19:42,163 --> 00:19:43,044
It could be as narrow as,

374
00:19:43,324 --> 00:19:45,606
hey, we really need to nerf Leona's late game.

375
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:50,850
And then, once you have that philosophy,

376
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,291
make sure you actually do stick with it.

377
00:19:53,387 --> 00:19:56,988
We really like to work this way because it helps to mitigate against designers tinkering.

378
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:59,809
And by tinkering I mean someone's driving into work and they're like,

379
00:20:00,189 --> 00:20:02,450
I had a crazy idea, let's do this and see what happens.

380
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,791
That could be fun as a designer, it's really pretty painful for players.

381
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:11,153
And it also solves the mythical, oh I had a bad game last night,

382
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:14,234
Leona beat me so I'm going to go in and make sure the team nerfs Leona.

383
00:20:16,274 --> 00:20:17,535
Players think we work that way.

384
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:22,239
So instead we're trying to solve specific problems

385
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,223
like X is too strong in the laning phase

386
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:28,047
rather than, hey, something popped into my head

387
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:28,508
out of the blue.

388
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:34,727
Now as an aside, Riot as a company really likes to work this way overall because it helps to empower our teams.

389
00:20:35,427 --> 00:20:39,528
It makes the growth of the company more scalable because instead of the same decision makers

390
00:20:39,568 --> 00:20:42,989
kind of having to swan dive into every single discussion that's going on,

391
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:45,830
we can spend our time getting aligned on what the values are,

392
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,571
and then the teams can go off and make the decisions themselves without having to like,

393
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:53,772
reopen every discussion because we've already kind of agreed on what the high-level goals are.

394
00:20:56,682 --> 00:20:58,324
But you won't always get it right.

395
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:00,447
One of my leads the other day said,

396
00:21:00,848 --> 00:21:03,090
even the best design that you've really thought about

397
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,173
and beat up probably has about a 70% chance

398
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:06,234
of hitting your bullseye.

399
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:08,597
So having a risk mitigation plan

400
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:10,259
can help to avoid panic when that happens.

401
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:15,490
You need good KPIs and key performance indicators.

402
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,731
You need to understand what you're going for here.

403
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,652
If you're nerfing a champion in League,

404
00:21:19,992 --> 00:21:22,273
do we want to see her drop rate go down by 2%?

405
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,415
Are we worried players aren't playing this champion

406
00:21:25,455 --> 00:21:27,576
because they're too complicated?

407
00:21:27,596 --> 00:21:29,757
They don't understand the synergies between their abilities.

408
00:21:31,117 --> 00:21:33,238
When you have good KPIs, it helps that you can agree.

409
00:21:34,312 --> 00:21:36,975
if you've missed your goals rather than debating, did we miss our goals or not.

410
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:40,378
You immediately evaluate, okay, we missed our goals, and then you can enact the plan.

411
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,102
For example, when you make a new champion, the champion designer might say,

412
00:21:44,882 --> 00:21:50,207
her weakness is supposed to be that she's not very strong in early lane,

413
00:21:50,328 --> 00:21:55,112
so if she ends up being a lane bully, nerf her Q, and that'll kind of skew her back towards the late game.

414
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:01,916
Now we do focus on a target. We aspire to balance for all players,

415
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:05,597
but being able to focus helps us avoid insanity.

416
00:22:06,098 --> 00:22:08,799
And this is particularly relevant because we patch the game very frequently

417
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:10,780
and don't always have a lot of time in between patches.

418
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,561
We do look at outliers at all levels,

419
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:16,163
but I'll kind of walk you through the sweet spot for game balance.

420
00:22:18,954 --> 00:22:25,475
So if you look at how many players the changes are impacting, imagine the bottom scale here is number of players in a particular tier.

421
00:22:25,555 --> 00:22:29,936
There's a lot of bronze players, fewer silver players, only a few dozen pro players in the world.

422
00:22:32,356 --> 00:22:34,497
And this other axis is sensitivity game changes.

423
00:22:35,497 --> 00:22:42,158
So we change a champion's attack by five, a newer player isn't even going to notice that.

424
00:22:42,218 --> 00:22:43,958
They're much better off just playing ten more games.

425
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:48,299
That will improve their win rate much more than anything that we're going to do in terms of balance.

426
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,671
And then you can see the sweet spot here where these two curves intersect

427
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:54,933
is right around high platinum, low diamond.

428
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:59,176
That's kind of an area that we think we're impacting a lot of players still

429
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:03,119
rather than the super rarefied air of the Challenger Master Pro tiers.

430
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,501
But we still do look for outliers at all levels.

431
00:23:05,701 --> 00:23:09,725
If Garen or Master Yi is stomping Bronze, we'll take action there.

432
00:23:10,065 --> 00:23:12,647
If there's a champion that's 100% pick-ban at the Pro level,

433
00:23:12,907 --> 00:23:14,488
we'll try to take action there as well.

434
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:18,351
Now...

435
00:23:20,035 --> 00:23:24,341
Players will assume that you should and do balance for high ELO only.

436
00:23:24,561 --> 00:23:25,943
That's the important thing to a lot of players.

437
00:23:25,963 --> 00:23:29,968
They don't necessarily understand why you're making changes that will help out less experienced players.

438
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:34,574
But this would remove a lot of the 130 champions from those players.

439
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,893
We do have to constantly reinforce the goals of balance to all within the community.

440
00:23:40,273 --> 00:23:44,617
I'll watch prominent streamers discussing the state of balance in League

441
00:23:44,637 --> 00:23:48,561
and they're always talking about, oh well now the pros are going to pick this or that,

442
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:50,182
what is Riot thinking here?

443
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:54,126
A lot of this stuff is publishing, and by publishing I mean

444
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:57,389
the messaging you're sending to your communities to make sure

445
00:23:57,629 --> 00:24:01,572
they understand what your goals are and why you're making the wacky changes to the game that you're making.

446
00:24:04,366 --> 00:24:08,228
Now interestingly, pro balance itself is largely about viewers.

447
00:24:09,568 --> 00:24:12,069
We don't want to make life terrible for our pros, obviously,

448
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:16,251
but when we make a change, it's often with the idea of our viewers

449
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,292
having a fun time watching League of Legends.

450
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:23,014
We will make changes if, for example, the game gets a little stale

451
00:24:23,054 --> 00:24:26,415
and viewers are saying, yeah, it's still fun to see the end game,

452
00:24:26,435 --> 00:24:28,936
but I skipped the first 20 minutes because it's really boring.

453
00:24:29,256 --> 00:24:30,617
That might lead us to make a change.

454
00:24:30,977 --> 00:24:33,298
In this case, balance could be fine, but we just think that, you know.

455
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:38,423
the we're going to hurt our virtuous cycle of viewing and playing and viewing

456
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:40,524
if people start tuning out of e-sports.

457
00:24:44,507 --> 00:24:46,568
I want to stress again, this stuff is hard.

458
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:51,070
You can't hand this to one guy at the end of the cycle as a part-time job.

459
00:24:51,851 --> 00:24:53,672
Believe me, I was that guy in Age of Empires.

460
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:54,772
It doesn't work.

461
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:57,874
Certainly not with the expectations for players these days.

462
00:24:59,835 --> 00:25:01,076
It really takes a dedicated team.

463
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:04,238
And I realize that may be challenging if you're a smaller

464
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:07,121
indie dev, in which case I would say you're just going to

465
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:09,543
have to leverage the feedback from your players a lot more.

466
00:25:09,864 --> 00:25:11,786
It's going to be hard for you to get tuning right.

467
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:15,749
So if you ship your changes, listen to what players are

468
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:17,131
saying, and then react to that.

469
00:25:17,671 --> 00:25:19,693
And I'll talk a little more about that in a second.

470
00:25:22,836 --> 00:25:22,936
So.

471
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:27,136
The team structure for League of Legends, we have a dedicated live team.

472
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:31,719
These are the men and women who are largely responsible for patch-to-patch balance.

473
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:34,661
You can think of them like the first responders or the MASH unit.

474
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:38,605
Someone is bleeding on the curb, they have to get out there and fix them.

475
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:43,608
They deal with problems that can't wait for a holistic or systemic solution.

476
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:45,390
They got to get in there right now and fix things.

477
00:25:46,851 --> 00:25:47,992
We patch every two weeks.

478
00:25:48,896 --> 00:25:51,018
Since you all are game developers, you understand

479
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:52,760
that that doesn't mean they actually have two weeks to

480
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,360
make changes.

481
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:55,342
When you take into consideration things like

482
00:25:55,382 --> 00:25:58,605
build stability and QA testing and localization, often they

483
00:25:58,645 --> 00:26:02,648
have three days to decide something's amiss, make

484
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:05,671
changes, test those changes, make additional changes, and

485
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:06,752
then get it out there to players.

486
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,297
Our live team is backed up by a play test team of very

487
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:12,978
skilled players.

488
00:26:13,078 --> 00:26:14,659
Many of these players are ex-pros.

489
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:19,231
The playtest team is critical for us to get early impressions and data.

490
00:26:19,531 --> 00:26:23,894
You can think of it as being able to deploy your patch early or having a beta even before your beta.

491
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,508
I've been able to create a playtest team at all three

492
00:26:27,548 --> 00:26:30,189
studios where I've worked, at Ensemble, Blizzard,

493
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,009
and now at Riot.

494
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:34,310
It can be a hard sell when you're trying to convince the

495
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,130
studio to hire.

496
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:39,111
In this case, we need over 10 players to be able to play a

497
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:39,851
10-player game.

498
00:26:40,252 --> 00:26:43,832
But it's worth it when you consider that the designers in

499
00:26:43,872 --> 00:26:46,813
QA who are probably in the trenches can't play the game

500
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:47,653
all day long.

501
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:49,974
They have to actually sit at the computer and make changes

502
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:50,354
as well.

503
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:53,275
So without someone playing the game constantly, you may only

504
00:26:53,315 --> 00:26:54,795
get two or three games in during the day.

505
00:26:56,207 --> 00:26:58,789
Again, I understand for a small studio or an indie dev,

506
00:26:58,809 --> 00:26:59,850
this isn't going to be feasible.

507
00:27:01,191 --> 00:27:03,853
And as a warning, high ELO players are going to suggest

508
00:27:03,893 --> 00:27:04,794
high ELO changes.

509
00:27:04,934 --> 00:27:06,716
You just have to keep that in mind when they're talking

510
00:27:06,756 --> 00:27:09,078
about, hey, I thought of a way to fix this that's probably

511
00:27:09,098 --> 00:27:12,120
going to fix it for them and not necessarily all the rest

512
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,760
of the skill tiers.

513
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:20,106
I talked about how we had a focus team, and we focus on a

514
00:27:20,146 --> 00:27:22,508
target ELO, but we also have a focus target time.

515
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:25,889
Just as with our professional game, ranked play in league

516
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:26,749
follows a season.

517
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,372
The ranked season turns on, players progress, and then at

518
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:31,413
the end of the year it turns off.

519
00:27:32,654 --> 00:27:34,936
And we know that systemic changes, or even things like a

520
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:38,338
new champion launch, we recently launched Camille.

521
00:27:38,618 --> 00:27:40,019
Her win rate did not hit our targets.

522
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:46,352
We know these changes are going to compromise balance and disrupt the game for players.

523
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:52,395
This past preseason we made a massive change to the assassin characters in League of Legends.

524
00:27:52,655 --> 00:27:56,617
This not only involved individual champions, but their items, their masteries.

525
00:27:56,637 --> 00:28:01,439
We even changed the way stealth works, since stealth is really tied into assassin characters.

526
00:28:03,775 --> 00:28:07,457
And again, we do this deliberately, make these kind of disruptive changes knowing that it's worth it,

527
00:28:07,637 --> 00:28:09,318
but also knowing that balance will take a hit.

528
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:12,020
And during these times, players are going to say,

529
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:15,402
WTF, Riot? Why is your balance team asleep at the wheel?

530
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:20,145
When really, we've made life hard on the balance team by making all these other changes to the game.

531
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:25,148
So we try to constrain the most disruptive changes to pre-season and mid-season.

532
00:28:26,306 --> 00:28:30,232
Messaging here is super important so the players understand what's going on and understand that,

533
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:33,957
hey guys, things will be a little crazy for a while, we're putting plants in the game,

534
00:28:34,177 --> 00:28:35,860
we're trying a new pick-ban system, whatever.

535
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,604
We know that's going to come at a balanced cost,

536
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,789
and because we patch quickly, we're going to try to get things back to a stable place.

537
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,626
Now, I have a few slides here on using data.

538
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,907
We gather a lot of data, right?

539
00:28:51,987 --> 00:28:54,007
It has a really powerful insights team,

540
00:28:54,327 --> 00:28:56,068
and they help us to collect a lot of analytics

541
00:28:56,108 --> 00:28:58,608
about the game, and then help us to interpret that as well.

542
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:02,749
I know I talk about win rate a lot.

543
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,189
That is an important stat for us.

544
00:29:04,249 --> 00:29:07,750
We target a 50% win rate for champions at all skill tiers,

545
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,591
but it's not the only stat,

546
00:29:09,651 --> 00:29:11,011
and it doesn't tell the entire story.

547
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,063
The story here is that most players do not think that

548
00:29:15,143 --> 00:29:16,984
Yasuo is scary, funny, or cute.

549
00:29:17,365 --> 00:29:20,668
But they do think he is a badass, powerful, unique, and

550
00:29:20,888 --> 00:29:22,069
maybe beautiful in North America.

551
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:26,973
So here's an example of win rate.

552
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:28,594
But we're looking at win rate by skill level.

553
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:32,738
So on the left of each of these curves is the bronze

554
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:34,099
players, and at the right is kind of

555
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,160
challenger master tier.

556
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,742
You can see a character, a champion like Veigar, hovers at around a 50% win rate.

557
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:44,624
It does go down a little bit at high ELO, but overall, we're pretty happy with that. That's not too bad.

558
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:50,988
Whereas Twisted Fate here, if you are a bronze player, that's not a great champion choice for you.

559
00:29:51,008 --> 00:29:57,952
You're probably going to lose a lot, while as you climb in ELO, his win rate's going to get pretty respectable borderline overpowered there at 55%.

560
00:30:00,283 --> 00:30:04,408
Next to him is Garen, who I talked about before, and you can see, just like I promised, his

561
00:30:04,448 --> 00:30:07,672
win rate goes down a lot as you get to the higher tiers of difficulty.

562
00:30:08,493 --> 00:30:13,499
And I also have Aatrox here, and the asterisk is because he appears to fall off a cliff

563
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,683
and go down to a 40% win rate, which just wouldn't be acceptable.

564
00:30:17,063 --> 00:30:19,887
But what's really going on here is the sample size is very, very low.

565
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:22,451
high tier players just don't even play him a lot.

566
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:24,954
So the data we're getting from that isn't awesome.

567
00:30:25,275 --> 00:30:27,358
This is just an example of you have to really look at the

568
00:30:27,418 --> 00:30:28,901
data, not just make assumptions.

569
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,183
Oh my god, his win rate is low.

570
00:30:30,223 --> 00:30:30,763
We have to buff.

571
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,270
Similarly, here are

572
00:30:37,017 --> 00:30:39,678
the number of games on a champion, irrespective of ELO.

573
00:30:40,218 --> 00:30:42,619
You can see a character here like Aurelion Sol.

574
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:45,560
Your first game of Aurelion Sol, you may lose.

575
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,321
In fact, you may lose a lot of games with Aurelion Sol

576
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:49,801
before you really understand what's going on

577
00:30:49,821 --> 00:30:50,481
with this champion.

578
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:54,143
The far right on this slide could be 40 or 50 games,

579
00:30:54,223 --> 00:30:56,123
which is a pretty hefty commitment for a player.

580
00:30:57,824 --> 00:30:58,804
On the other end of the spectrum

581
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:00,245
is a champion named Volibear.

582
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:02,786
After you've played Volibear two or three times,

583
00:31:02,806 --> 00:31:05,046
you've probably seen about all that Volibear has to offer.

584
00:31:06,137 --> 00:31:08,598
This is not the sign of a really well-designed champion,

585
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:12,041
and he's the kind that is up for an update at some point.

586
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:14,543
Now, Aurelion Sol is not awesome either.

587
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:16,584
That's a really steep skill curve.

588
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:20,968
We would rather the win rate not be so low at the low end.

589
00:31:26,502 --> 00:31:28,602
This is why it's so important to interpret your data.

590
00:31:29,122 --> 00:31:31,923
If you're playing against a Lee Sin, a popular jungle

591
00:31:31,943 --> 00:31:34,324
champion, the player you're playing against may very well

592
00:31:34,364 --> 00:31:36,625
have three times the number of games that you do on that

593
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:39,326
champion, because it takes that long to get good at Lee

594
00:31:39,346 --> 00:31:41,547
Sin, so if he's showing up at all, you may be playing

595
00:31:41,587 --> 00:31:42,667
someone who really knows what they're doing.

596
00:31:43,247 --> 00:31:45,228
In this case, it's not that Lee Sin is overpowered.

597
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:46,888
It's just you're playing against a very experienced

598
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:47,849
player on that champion.

599
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:51,170
This is why you have to look at things like win rate based

600
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:54,951
on games played and win rate based on ELO to really

601
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:55,832
understand what's going on.

602
00:31:59,343 --> 00:32:00,064
Here's another example.

603
00:32:00,745 --> 00:32:04,127
Pro champion choice has an immediate effect

604
00:32:04,187 --> 00:32:05,028
on the rest of the game.

605
00:32:05,668 --> 00:32:07,950
Once we see a pro player pick a champion,

606
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,072
we know that Spike is immediately going

607
00:32:10,092 --> 00:32:11,053
to show up around the world.

608
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:17,235
It's interesting. Part of it, I'm sure, is just, oh, the pros are really, really skilled players.

609
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:19,838
If they know that this champion's good, they're probably good.

610
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:23,702
I also think it's players kind of hate to be accused of not being up to date.

611
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:28,246
Sometimes I think players would prefer to be known for poor skill

612
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:30,228
than to be known that, you know, they were uninformed.

613
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:32,230
Everyone hates to be wrong about things.

614
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:38,277
So when you see particularly silver, bronze, silver, gold players pick up these pro choices,

615
00:32:38,697 --> 00:32:40,919
it's going to be an ineffective choice for them,

616
00:32:40,939 --> 00:32:44,243
because they're not going to be able to pull off the things that the pros can pull off.

617
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:48,747
This is, uh, Froggen is known for picking Anivia.

618
00:32:51,078 --> 00:32:55,400
And speaking of Anivia, she's a great case study for why you

619
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,161
need to use your judgment to make calls.

620
00:32:57,622 --> 00:33:00,063
We don't use machine learning to balance League of Legends.

621
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:04,466
We hire people that can use their own experience as game

622
00:33:04,486 --> 00:33:07,567
designers and QA to help make these decisions.

623
00:33:08,768 --> 00:33:11,990
Anivia often turns up red flags, where her win rate can

624
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:12,450
be as high as 55%.

625
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:16,393
Yet we think if we nerfed her, players would be like, why did

626
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:17,013
you nerf Anivia?

627
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:17,753
She's not a problem.

628
00:33:18,945 --> 00:33:21,386
And when we reflect on that, we agree with them.

629
00:33:21,446 --> 00:33:24,807
Like, she has reasonable strategic counterplay,

630
00:33:24,827 --> 00:33:27,148
meaning that you can counterpick her in champion select.

631
00:33:27,648 --> 00:33:30,089
And she has reasonable tactical counterplay,

632
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:32,170
meaning that when you're actually out on the map playing,

633
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,231
there are things you can do to avoid her spells.

634
00:33:35,231 --> 00:33:36,152
So is she a balanced?

635
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:39,153
The data says yes, but our gut says no.

636
00:33:43,014 --> 00:33:44,075
And this leads to another topic,

637
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:46,456
which is that we don't share our data publicly.

638
00:33:47,883 --> 00:33:50,807
We didn't do this on World of Warcraft or Age of Empires either.

639
00:33:51,788 --> 00:33:57,375
The reason is we were scared that we end up dictating choices to players.

640
00:33:57,855 --> 00:34:00,979
If they see that a champion has a low win rate, they may just not play that champion.

641
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:04,023
And really, we'd rather players just play League of Legends and have fun,

642
00:34:04,283 --> 00:34:07,166
and not obsess about becoming armchair statisticians.

643
00:34:09,908 --> 00:34:13,830
On the other hand, as a developer, or as a player, it feels really flippant when the developer says,

644
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:17,392
well, that's not what our secret data says, and we're not going to show you our secret data.

645
00:34:17,812 --> 00:34:19,973
Makes it very hard for a player to argue against it.

646
00:34:20,654 --> 00:34:23,115
And it's possible that we could provide context. We could say, look,

647
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:26,517
yes, this item build looks good on paper,

648
00:34:26,877 --> 00:34:30,899
but that's only with a really strong team coordination that you may not have in solo queue.

649
00:34:31,883 --> 00:34:33,724
So I just want to present this as an ongoing discussion.

650
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:36,585
We're not changing our stance on this immediately, but we do

651
00:34:36,605 --> 00:34:37,986
discuss it a lot internally.

652
00:34:38,026 --> 00:34:40,327
And maybe it would be an interesting experiment.

653
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,851
So when you detect a balance problem, how do you know what

654
00:34:46,891 --> 00:34:47,471
to change?

655
00:34:48,091 --> 00:34:49,612
In the case of League of Legends, it could be the

656
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:52,454
champion, it could be the item, it could be the mastery.

657
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:55,675
This is the pregame system for League of Legends, similar to

658
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:56,436
Talents and WoW.

659
00:34:57,803 --> 00:34:59,644
Is it the strategy players are using right now?

660
00:34:59,924 --> 00:35:03,087
Is it the synergy with other champions on that team?

661
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,471
There's an example of Poppy, this cute little yordle

662
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:08,112
with the big hammer.

663
00:35:08,835 --> 00:35:12,758
We recently updated Poppy. Objectively, it was a really good rework.

664
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:14,159
Super happy with the way that came out.

665
00:35:14,499 --> 00:35:16,220
But her win rate did spike.

666
00:35:16,841 --> 00:35:19,843
And it spiked at the same time that we changed one of our masteries.

667
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,665
This is Courage of the Colossus, the green guy here.

668
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:26,908
Courage of the Colossus gives you a shield when you crowd control a champion.

669
00:35:27,148 --> 00:35:28,650
And Poppy has a lot of crowd control.

670
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,151
She's already pretty tanky. With Courage of the Colossus,

671
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,513
she would get this shield and become even more tanky.

672
00:35:34,073 --> 00:35:36,794
It felt overpowered. We knew we needed to do something.

673
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:40,915
And we debated a lot. Was Poppy the problem or was Courage of Colossus the problem?

674
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:43,236
We definitely needed to nerf Courage of Colossus.

675
00:35:43,496 --> 00:35:45,357
The question was, did we also need to nerf Poppy?

676
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:48,318
We went back and looked at the data in this case, and we saw that

677
00:35:48,558 --> 00:35:52,059
her win rate had started to spike even before the Courage of Colossus changed.

678
00:35:52,379 --> 00:35:53,919
So in this case, we did change both.

679
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:56,920
We nerfed both the Mastery and the Champion at the same time.

680
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,181
And if we hadn't done that, we would have had to, like, go in the next patch,

681
00:36:00,461 --> 00:36:01,762
and she still wouldn't have been fixed.

682
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:08,317
I'm a big advocate of playtesting your own game.

683
00:36:10,057 --> 00:36:12,378
Having a playtest team, having a lot of data from players,

684
00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:14,238
is no excuse not to play the game yourself.

685
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,679
If you don't, you'll miss stuff.

686
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,720
You won't really understand the player experience.

687
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,860
Numbers just can't tell you the entire story.

688
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,241
And sometimes it's going to be really obvious.

689
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:24,862
You're like, oh, I understand the win rate of this champion.

690
00:36:24,902 --> 00:36:27,062
It's because nobody can tell what's going on with their

691
00:36:27,082 --> 00:36:27,783
spell visuals.

692
00:36:27,823 --> 00:36:29,563
They don't know if they're standing in the fire or not.

693
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:33,784
On the other hand, I want to caution you not to go too far

694
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:34,565
here in the other direction.

695
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,611
it can be really easy to take your experience as a player

696
00:36:38,711 --> 00:36:40,192
and assume that applies to all players.

697
00:36:40,652 --> 00:36:41,893
And I definitely see this happen

698
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,434
when as a development team matures,

699
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:45,614
meaning we're all getting older,

700
00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:48,356
it's easy for us to forget just how many games

701
00:36:48,396 --> 00:36:50,777
and how engaged some players can be with our games.

702
00:36:51,237 --> 00:36:53,778
So don't play one game and make a lot of balanced decisions

703
00:36:53,818 --> 00:36:54,719
based on that one game.

704
00:36:55,659 --> 00:36:57,680
This is in fact how we used to balance Age of Empires.

705
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,761
We would go play a game, make tuning changes,

706
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,362
go play another game, make tuning changes.

707
00:37:02,362 --> 00:37:03,843
Just doesn't fly, I think, anymore.

708
00:37:05,037 --> 00:37:06,338
I try to play League every day.

709
00:37:06,779 --> 00:37:07,659
I don't always succeed.

710
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:10,122
I've been at GDC, not playing a lot of League right now.

711
00:37:10,482 --> 00:37:12,444
But it does help to stay in touch with what players are

712
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:12,984
talking about.

713
00:37:16,387 --> 00:37:17,508
This is the best slide in the deck.

714
00:37:17,548 --> 00:37:18,329
I'll just give you a second here.

715
00:37:22,932 --> 00:37:25,274
I think the best thing is that he's just kind of, assuming

716
00:37:25,294 --> 00:37:26,235
it's a he, he's just kind of commenting.

717
00:37:26,255 --> 00:37:27,837
He's like, oh, I just noticed this.

718
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:28,557
Kind of surprised me.

719
00:37:28,938 --> 00:37:29,598
No judgment call there.

720
00:37:32,077 --> 00:37:37,082
You do need to listen to players. We listen to our own forums, Reddit, Twitter,

721
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:41,446
rioters who tell us they noticed something wrong, pros, streamers.

722
00:37:41,946 --> 00:37:44,629
I could give you an entire talk on leveraging player feedback.

723
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,593
This doesn't mean always do immediately what the players are asking for.

724
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,554
You'll often be really sad if you do that.

725
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:52,857
But, you know, ignore them at your peril.

726
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:55,519
They're giving you feedback. They want to see the game improved.

727
00:37:57,063 --> 00:38:00,264
You do need a good solution for other regions, other languages.

728
00:38:00,584 --> 00:38:03,245
And again, smaller studios may struggle more with this.

729
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,647
Riot is fortunate enough that we have regional offices in

730
00:38:06,707 --> 00:38:08,428
all the countries where League is played.

731
00:38:08,868 --> 00:38:11,609
And we rely a lot on those teams to tell us, hey, did you

732
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:14,750
know that players in Vietnam are talking about this problem

733
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,771
in the game that may not have filtered out

734
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:17,691
to other regions yet?

735
00:38:17,912 --> 00:38:20,653
That helps us to kind of pay attention to what Vietnamese

736
00:38:20,693 --> 00:38:22,914
players are saying, because I certainly

737
00:38:22,954 --> 00:38:23,714
can't speak Vietnamese.

738
00:38:27,202 --> 00:38:31,044
Like many companies, we also use beta tests for the changes we're going to put out.

739
00:38:32,405 --> 00:38:36,448
Betas are really good for bugs, and they're really good for impressions.

740
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:39,070
So a player may say, wow, this is complicated,

741
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:41,552
or I'm not exactly sure how I'm supposed to be using that.

742
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:44,414
In general, sweeping statement here, but in general,

743
00:38:44,434 --> 00:38:46,156
betas are not good for balance testing.

744
00:38:46,736 --> 00:38:50,939
And the reason is because players understandably don't try that hard.

745
00:38:51,754 --> 00:38:54,697
If they're going to devote 10 hours this week to your game,

746
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:57,400
they probably want to spend time in the actual game,

747
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,444
not on your beta realm, trying things out that may very well

748
00:39:00,484 --> 00:39:03,287
never get shipped at the end of the day anyway.

749
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:06,130
So you end up with smaller populations, which means

750
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,553
matchmaking is not awesome, and so forth.

751
00:39:10,275 --> 00:39:12,017
I will add that on World of Warcraft.

752
00:39:12,763 --> 00:39:16,906
Testing the PvE game, meaning dungeons and raids, worked pretty well on beta,

753
00:39:16,926 --> 00:39:22,030
and that's because the high-end raiding guilds would want to get a jumpstart on the content and practice.

754
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,251
So in this case, practicing did actually work out for them.

755
00:39:24,732 --> 00:39:30,856
But the PvP balance feedback from World of Warcraft beta was about as not helpful

756
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:34,239
as the balance feedback from League of Legends betas.

757
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:37,843
I would also discourage you from trying things like,

758
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:39,806
oh, well, we'll bribe players to play our beta.

759
00:39:40,647 --> 00:39:42,851
You may get a short-term spike in engagement,

760
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:45,455
but overall, you have to be really careful

761
00:39:45,936 --> 00:39:47,619
to not motivate odd behavior

762
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,161
just because you want them to play a lot of games.

763
00:39:53,112 --> 00:39:55,894
We also just ask players, we don't necessarily wait for them to come to us.

764
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,775
We do player labs, we bring players into the studio, have them play a game,

765
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:01,216
then ask them about their experience.

766
00:40:01,496 --> 00:40:04,878
We do this a lot, say, for new champions or champion updates

767
00:40:05,018 --> 00:40:07,119
or crazy changes that we'd like to make to the game.

768
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,862
We have a micro-survey tool that we leverage extensively.

769
00:40:11,362 --> 00:40:12,943
Anyone who's played League of Legends very long

770
00:40:12,963 --> 00:40:14,943
has probably gotten one of these surveys after a game

771
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:17,725
asking, hey, did you like this change?

772
00:40:17,745 --> 00:40:18,685
What do you think about that?

773
00:40:19,085 --> 00:40:21,867
It's really interesting to look at how the survey feedback

774
00:40:21,907 --> 00:40:24,648
changes over time, how it changes in different regions

775
00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:25,448
around the world.

776
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:33,781
This last preseason we added plants to the summoner's rift map that players can interact with.

777
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:36,502
There's somewhat of a random element to the way plants spawn,

778
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:40,044
and when players first heard about this they freaked out,

779
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:43,205
and they thought, oh we're adding too much RNG to League of Legends, it's going to ruin the game,

780
00:40:43,245 --> 00:40:44,505
this is, you know, sky's falling.

781
00:40:45,425 --> 00:40:48,366
And nowadays, our surveys are showing that most players are

782
00:40:48,386 --> 00:40:49,906
pretty happy with the way plants ended up.

783
00:40:50,306 --> 00:40:53,267
So I'm not saying players are dumb by any stretch.

784
00:40:53,347 --> 00:40:55,548
I'm saying that we didn't necessarily set their

785
00:40:55,588 --> 00:40:57,388
expectations for what the feature was going to be.

786
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:03,970
So now that you have goals, data, and player feedback,

787
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,050
this is the basic iteration cycle that we use.

788
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,591
Make changes, gather data, gather player feedback, make

789
00:41:10,651 --> 00:41:11,231
more changes.

790
00:41:11,251 --> 00:41:12,972
You may have to go through this cycle a few times.

791
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:16,663
Let's take Nidalee, for example.

792
00:41:17,504 --> 00:41:20,065
Nidalee is a champion that can turn into a panther, which

793
00:41:20,085 --> 00:41:20,806
makes her very fast.

794
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,127
She can also throw a spear.

795
00:41:22,507 --> 00:41:22,947
So guess what?

796
00:41:23,287 --> 00:41:24,488
Nidalee is our cavalry archer.

797
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:27,930
And just as with the cavalry archers, we have trouble

798
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:28,531
balancing her.

799
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:32,093
So we'll make a change, doesn't fix the problem, make

800
00:41:32,113 --> 00:41:35,295
another change, doesn't fix the problem, and so on and so

801
00:41:35,395 --> 00:41:37,877
on, spoiler, she still isn't right.

802
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:38,918
Sad Nidalee.

803
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,310
Sometimes problems can't be solved through tuning.

804
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,751
I mentioned before that the live team is like our first

805
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:46,431
responders.

806
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,592
They can get to the scene of an accident, but they can't

807
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,052
fix traffic patterns.

808
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:52,893
They're not empowered to rewire the stop lights to try

809
00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:54,893
to create fewer accidents overall.

810
00:41:55,793 --> 00:41:58,274
We do need sometimes to go through and make more systemic

811
00:41:58,314 --> 00:41:58,694
changes.

812
00:41:58,794 --> 00:42:00,175
We do this a lot through champion updates.

813
00:42:00,965 --> 00:42:03,967
Ryze is kind of infamous here for a champion that we just can't get right.

814
00:42:04,528 --> 00:42:07,910
We'll make a change, we'll put him out. He still is too powerful at high ELO.

815
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,831
Too weak at low ELO, we'll make another change.

816
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:11,372
And this goes on over and over.

817
00:42:15,254 --> 00:42:17,335
As a last resort, you can basement champions.

818
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:22,298
We hate to do this because it feels like it's violating a lot of the player trust

819
00:42:22,338 --> 00:42:24,319
about being able to play the champions they want to play.

820
00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:27,401
But it's also not fair to players to give them a champion

821
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:29,182
that is just going to ruin the experience for everyone.

822
00:42:30,478 --> 00:42:34,441
Azir is a very, very challenging champion for us to balance.

823
00:42:34,882 --> 00:42:37,364
It probably stems from the fact that he can do so many

824
00:42:37,384 --> 00:42:37,924
different things.

825
00:42:37,964 --> 00:42:40,166
He doesn't really have weaknesses that you can

826
00:42:40,206 --> 00:42:40,586
exploit.

827
00:42:41,547 --> 00:42:44,309
If we tried to tune him, given his current set of

828
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:48,893
abilities, his win rate may be 60% at pro and 30% at bronze,

829
00:42:48,973 --> 00:42:50,294
which I'm probably exaggerating there.

830
00:42:50,314 --> 00:42:52,576
But he's definitely a hard to balance champion.

831
00:42:52,616 --> 00:42:55,018
He probably just needs an update and needs to lose some

832
00:42:55,038 --> 00:42:55,558
of what he can do.

833
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,081
So winding down here a little bit.

834
00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:03,620
I've talked a ton about balance, but I want to stress

835
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,880
that balance isn't everything.

836
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,601
And as a systems designer, you can definitely fall into the

837
00:43:07,641 --> 00:43:09,621
trap of looking at everything through the lens of balance.

838
00:43:12,042 --> 00:43:13,942
Champions can be balanced, meaning their win rate could

839
00:43:13,962 --> 00:43:15,643
be perfect, but still really frustrating.

840
00:43:15,943 --> 00:43:19,244
And here are three examples, Riven, LeBlanc, and Yasuo.

841
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:23,145
Yasuo's win rate may be totally fair, and enough

842
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:24,785
players may think he's bullshit that they stop

843
00:43:24,805 --> 00:43:26,205
playing the game, which is not.

844
00:43:26,285 --> 00:43:28,426
As a developer, you don't want to say, but he's balanced.

845
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:34,891
Likewise, remember that players pick champions for a lot of different reasons.

846
00:43:34,991 --> 00:43:38,472
I mentioned the pro example with Froggen's Anivia earlier.

847
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:42,373
This is Jinx. She's a very popular champion to play.

848
00:43:42,933 --> 00:43:45,514
Her abilities are cool, her thematic,

849
00:43:45,594 --> 00:43:49,175
you know, she's kind of an anarchist riot girl, really resonates with players.

850
00:43:49,495 --> 00:43:51,335
We know that Jinx is always going to be popular.

851
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:52,876
It's not necessarily because she's...

852
00:43:53,893 --> 00:43:56,255
unbalanced, and in fact right now she's a little weak of anything.

853
00:43:56,875 --> 00:44:01,398
If you look at her play rate and conclude, oh, people are playing her too much, we should nerf her,

854
00:44:01,418 --> 00:44:02,819
you're just going to make players sad.

855
00:44:07,923 --> 00:44:09,084
Being on a balanced team is hard.

856
00:44:10,124 --> 00:44:12,026
The balanced team is going to hear a lot about how terrible they are.

857
00:44:12,906 --> 00:44:15,508
Is LoL going to suffer the same fate as WoW because of Ghostcrawler?

858
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:18,810
Burnout is really frequent.

859
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:21,251
You're giving this team one tool to solve every problem.

860
00:44:21,271 --> 00:44:22,152
It's like, here's a wrench.

861
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:24,233
No matter what happens, you have a wrench to solve it.

862
00:44:25,574 --> 00:44:27,775
Players and even co-workers are going to focus a lot more

863
00:44:27,815 --> 00:44:28,915
on failure than success.

864
00:44:29,776 --> 00:44:30,716
And there's never a break.

865
00:44:30,837 --> 00:44:32,277
As I said, we patch every two weeks.

866
00:44:32,317 --> 00:44:35,079
So as soon as the team is like, OK, we've made some changes

867
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:37,340
for patch 7.5, now let's start patch 7.6.

868
00:44:38,321 --> 00:44:39,541
There's never really an off cycle.

869
00:44:41,138 --> 00:44:44,259
Some of the solutions we use are to offer side projects for

870
00:44:44,299 --> 00:44:45,039
folks on the team.

871
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:48,580
So not everything is can I buffer nerf 5 attack damage

872
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:48,781
here.

873
00:44:49,881 --> 00:44:51,582
We also try to rotate folks off the team.

874
00:44:51,862 --> 00:44:52,922
That's good for their sanity.

875
00:44:53,182 --> 00:44:55,963
It also helps to add some of the knowledge they've learned

876
00:44:55,983 --> 00:44:57,664
about balance to other teams as well.

877
00:44:58,984 --> 00:45:00,765
And finally, tell them they're doing good.

878
00:45:01,145 --> 00:45:02,485
They're going to hear a lot about how much

879
00:45:02,525 --> 00:45:03,226
they're screwing up.

880
00:45:03,306 --> 00:45:06,207
So it's great to reinforce with these guys how important

881
00:45:06,227 --> 00:45:06,787
their job is.

882
00:45:06,807 --> 00:45:08,908
Because they're honestly not going to hear it often from

883
00:45:08,948 --> 00:45:10,728
players, even when they legitimately are doing well.

884
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,821
So in conclusion, balance matters for longevity

885
00:45:16,841 --> 00:45:17,381
and engagement.

886
00:45:17,401 --> 00:45:20,543
I would encourage you to understand why certain factors

887
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:21,963
affect balance at different skill levels.

888
00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:24,745
I would encourage you to have a philosophy.

889
00:45:25,345 --> 00:45:28,046
Don't just make changes based on data, but making changes

890
00:45:28,086 --> 00:45:29,387
against checking against your goals.

891
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,388
And iterate, iterate, iterate, and follow through when you

892
00:45:32,408 --> 00:45:33,169
don't get something right.

893
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:36,410
You're going to screw up a lot.

894
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,933
I screw up a lot, Wright screws up a lot.

895
00:45:39,494 --> 00:45:40,375
Follow up when it does.

896
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,098
Having a good relationship with your community will help.

897
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:46,502
We work really hard on this because players will give us

898
00:45:46,522 --> 00:45:48,204
the benefit of the doubt when we do make a mistake.

899
00:45:48,224 --> 00:45:49,406
They won't doubt our intentions,

900
00:45:50,007 --> 00:45:51,328
they'll just doubt our competence a little bit.

901
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,191
Good luck, and with that,

902
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:55,653
I'd be happy to take any questions.

903
00:45:55,974 --> 00:45:56,214
Thank you.

904
00:46:05,057 --> 00:46:10,199
Hey. So when nerfing things, how do you mitigate the kind of

905
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:14,981
feel bad effects of loss aversion? Do you actually take

906
00:46:15,001 --> 00:46:16,962
that into account in making your design decisions or is that

907
00:46:17,002 --> 00:46:19,343
mostly a PR community management thing?

908
00:46:20,136 --> 00:46:21,898
I mean, it is a community management thing,

909
00:46:21,998 --> 00:46:24,600
but we involve the people making the changes as well.

910
00:46:25,421 --> 00:46:26,902
I think that's a very real concern.

911
00:46:26,922 --> 00:46:28,363
And I think as developers, we don't always

912
00:46:28,403 --> 00:46:29,324
pay enough attention to it.

913
00:46:29,584 --> 00:46:30,765
It's really easy to focus, again,

914
00:46:30,885 --> 00:46:34,168
on let's make that 50% number show up for every champion

915
00:46:34,509 --> 00:46:36,330
and to forget how it's going to feel for players.

916
00:46:37,443 --> 00:46:40,505
One thing to avoid is the Nidalee example, where you make

917
00:46:40,545 --> 00:46:43,046
a change, you don't quite hit it right, so the next patch,

918
00:46:43,086 --> 00:46:45,087
there's another nerf, the next patch, there's another nerf.

919
00:46:45,988 --> 00:46:47,488
That starts to feel really bad for players.

920
00:46:47,588 --> 00:46:49,469
They know every time they're going to open up patch notes,

921
00:46:49,489 --> 00:46:50,169
they're going to see a nerf.

922
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:54,832
I'd encourage you in those cases to make sure you get it

923
00:46:54,892 --> 00:46:58,113
right, if you've tried a few times, or let it ride for a

924
00:46:58,133 --> 00:46:59,314
little bit, kind of let them recover.

925
00:47:00,154 --> 00:47:01,735
We also work really hard on our patch notes

926
00:47:01,755 --> 00:47:02,735
to provide context.

927
00:47:02,795 --> 00:47:04,856
Like, look, it's not that we hate Nidalee, it's that we're

928
00:47:04,876 --> 00:47:06,377
trying to solve this particular problem.

929
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:10,599
I also think Riot, like many studios, is a little too quick

930
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:12,080
to nerf and a little slow to buff.

931
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,761
I mean, nerfing is much easier than buffing.

932
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:18,263
But when you offset that a little bit, it's not as

933
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:19,443
negative experience overall.

934
00:47:20,124 --> 00:47:20,664
It's a great question.

935
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,386
Hi, you mentioned...

936
00:47:24,126 --> 00:47:25,607
Sorry, I'm stealing the microphone. Thanks.

937
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:27,528
You mentioned basementing?

938
00:47:27,948 --> 00:47:28,128
Yes.

939
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:30,209
What does that mean? Can you explain that?

940
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:32,530
That means you...

941
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,411
Your champion is such a problem in the game

942
00:47:35,451 --> 00:47:37,912
that the only thing to do is just nerf the crap out of them

943
00:47:37,932 --> 00:47:39,033
so the players aren't going to play them.

944
00:47:40,033 --> 00:47:43,937
Players who love that champion will play them, will probably still show up in lower tiers.

945
00:47:44,358 --> 00:47:47,381
It's a really shitty thing to do, particularly for players who love that champion.

946
00:47:47,721 --> 00:47:53,067
But you also, it's hard to justify having that character in the game ruining the experience for everyone else,

947
00:47:53,127 --> 00:47:55,029
just so the players that love that champion can do it.

948
00:47:55,909 --> 00:47:58,512
Quick follow-up, how do you handle messaging around that?

949
00:47:58,552 --> 00:48:01,595
Is there a strategy there, or do you just do it quietly and hope people keep quiet?

950
00:48:02,123 --> 00:48:06,365
My general policy is to be as honest with players as you can.

951
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:06,945
They're smart.

952
00:48:06,965 --> 00:48:07,766
They're going to figure it out.

953
00:48:07,826 --> 00:48:09,466
They're not going to buy your bullshit excuse.

954
00:48:09,546 --> 00:48:12,108
So in those cases, I would say, look, we screwed up.

955
00:48:12,148 --> 00:48:15,009
We can't make this character or unit or whatever game

956
00:48:15,029 --> 00:48:15,449
you're working on.

957
00:48:15,469 --> 00:48:16,710
We can't make this healthy right now.

958
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,971
We're going to temporarily kind of park them, and we are

959
00:48:19,991 --> 00:48:20,691
going to get back to it.

960
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:21,512
You do need to follow up.

961
00:48:21,552 --> 00:48:23,533
You just can't leave them in that state forever.

962
00:48:23,913 --> 00:48:25,854
We did that once with a champion named Olaf, and

963
00:48:25,874 --> 00:48:27,815
players still call it Olafing is the verb.

964
00:48:29,015 --> 00:48:29,215
Thanks.

965
00:48:31,135 --> 00:48:38,383
Hi, great talk. I have a question about the amount of champions you have and as the meta progresses

966
00:48:38,783 --> 00:48:40,946
Some of them will will be underrepresented

967
00:48:41,446 --> 00:48:46,772
So when you're doing updates like buffs and nerves, do you usually look at the underrepresented?

968
00:48:47,413 --> 00:48:49,836
Champions and buff them so they could be more relevant

969
00:48:50,396 --> 00:48:54,840
We look at champions who have a lower win rate and try to buff them to stay relevant,

970
00:48:55,341 --> 00:48:57,562
assuming that we can do so in a healthy way.

971
00:48:59,084 --> 00:49:01,066
Galio is a champion we're working on right now.

972
00:49:01,486 --> 00:49:03,368
His abilities just aren't that exciting.

973
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:04,589
Volibear is another example.

974
00:49:04,629 --> 00:49:06,971
So we'd be hesitant to buff them excessively.

975
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:10,013
We don't buff champions just based on low play rate.

976
00:49:10,454 --> 00:49:13,336
We have champions like Urgot.

977
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,078
He's a creepy dude.

978
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,100
We don't necessarily want to see Urgot as popular as Jinx.

979
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,422
That's part of why players like to play him, is he's a little

980
00:49:20,462 --> 00:49:20,782
weird.

981
00:49:20,862 --> 00:49:23,224
So in that case, we're fine, as long as there are players out

982
00:49:23,244 --> 00:49:24,204
there that love that champion.

983
00:49:24,224 --> 00:49:25,145
All right.

984
00:49:25,405 --> 00:49:25,625
Thank you.

985
00:49:27,487 --> 00:49:31,208
You talked a lot about how higher play rate on champions.

986
00:49:31,228 --> 00:49:33,489
So for example, if a player plays a champion a lot,

987
00:49:33,729 --> 00:49:35,789
their skill will increase with that champion.

988
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:38,770
So if you take this and you add it to the fact

989
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:42,411
that there's 130 champions and only six bands

990
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:46,052
for ranked online, it seems as if you're

991
00:49:46,552 --> 00:49:47,752
encouraging one tricks.

992
00:49:47,972 --> 00:49:51,393
Is that intentional or is that kind of a side effect of?

993
00:49:53,094 --> 00:49:56,577
It's a side effect and I hate it and I think it's one of the biggest design challenges

994
00:49:56,617 --> 00:49:58,198
you have to fix in League of Legends overall.

995
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:03,402
If you ask a skilled player, how do I get better at ranked, they'll tell you, be a one

996
00:50:03,422 --> 00:50:03,902
trick pony.

997
00:50:04,223 --> 00:50:07,325
Find one champion, play the hell out of that champion, know everything there is to know

998
00:50:07,385 --> 00:50:08,146
about that champion.

999
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:12,989
And that is effective, and you will increase your win rate

1000
00:50:13,029 --> 00:50:14,650
and probably the tier you play in.

1001
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:18,352
Unfortunately, it leaves a huge variety of the game

1002
00:50:19,293 --> 00:50:20,053
unavailable to you.

1003
00:50:20,313 --> 00:50:21,834
We try to offer all these champions

1004
00:50:21,854 --> 00:50:22,795
for a lot of diversity.

1005
00:50:23,055 --> 00:50:25,717
In fact, we know that people who play more champions tend

1006
00:50:25,757 --> 00:50:27,098
to stick with the game longer and say that

1007
00:50:27,118 --> 00:50:27,918
they're having more fun.

1008
00:50:28,279 --> 00:50:30,740
You can imagine burnout is probably higher when you've

1009
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,301
played 300 games with Vi.

1010
00:50:33,402 --> 00:50:36,087
You can imagine that when Vi gets nerfed, you may just

1011
00:50:36,127 --> 00:50:37,429
churn out of the game rather than switching

1012
00:50:37,449 --> 00:50:38,191
to another champion.

1013
00:50:38,531 --> 00:50:40,395
So I don't have good solutions to that.

1014
00:50:40,535 --> 00:50:41,717
It keeps me up at night for sure.

1015
00:50:41,737 --> 00:50:42,819
Thank you.

1016
00:50:44,311 --> 00:50:58,574
So I had a question revolving around champion tiering, which is just this sort of construct that other players have constructed to say these champions are tier 1, these champions are tier 2, which basically represents like pick these first and these guys are niche and these guys are useless.

1017
00:50:59,674 --> 00:51:06,416
Do you embrace champion tiering and say we're building this guy to be tier 1 and this other guy is some really niche...

1018
00:51:07,136 --> 00:51:10,118
counter and that's okay and he's not going to be high pick.

1019
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,642
I guess it revolves around are you striving for even pick rates or do you sort of embrace

1020
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:19,305
the tiers? No we don't strive for even pick rates.

1021
00:51:19,645 --> 00:51:22,427
There are champions that are really good at particular things.

1022
00:51:23,228 --> 00:51:26,570
Shen is a good split pusher. If you don't enjoy split pushing or

1023
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,732
that strategy currently isn't super powerful in the game

1024
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:31,273
he may not be a great pick.

1025
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,837
We want that a player who loves a champion to have

1026
00:51:34,877 --> 00:51:35,998
opportunities to play them.

1027
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:39,401
It feels terrible if you love this champion, you've invested

1028
00:51:39,421 --> 00:51:41,323
a lot in them, maybe you've spent a lot of money on skins

1029
00:51:41,343 --> 00:51:43,605
for this champion, and now you feel like you just can't play

1030
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:45,067
them, that's a really terrible experience.

1031
00:51:46,808 --> 00:51:48,850
And then I had a request from another gentleman to go back

1032
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:49,951
to the conclusions page.

1033
00:51:50,612 --> 00:51:51,733
I think he wanted to take some notes.

1034
00:51:53,535 --> 00:51:53,795
There we go.

1035
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:55,829
Hey, how's it going?

1036
00:51:56,109 --> 00:51:56,610
Hey.

1037
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,792
You talked about not only having a philosophy,

1038
00:51:58,832 --> 00:51:59,853
but following it.

1039
00:52:00,054 --> 00:52:02,296
I'm wondering if you can give some example actions

1040
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:04,598
of what you've done to incorporate your philosophy

1041
00:52:04,618 --> 00:52:06,580
into your team, so it's actually part of the culture.

1042
00:52:09,964 --> 00:52:11,686
We talk a lot about it, for starters.

1043
00:52:11,726 --> 00:52:14,709
I make sure that we reinforce with the team.

1044
00:52:16,809 --> 00:52:18,670
We give teams a lot of autonomy at Riot.

1045
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:22,112
And so then when someone makes a mistake, we'll retro it.

1046
00:52:22,132 --> 00:52:22,872
We'll talk about it.

1047
00:52:22,912 --> 00:52:25,853
Like, did we make this change to this champion

1048
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:27,454
because we really thought players would embrace it?

1049
00:52:27,494 --> 00:52:28,835
Or did we make this change to the champion

1050
00:52:28,855 --> 00:52:30,936
because you thought it was fun as a designer?

1051
00:52:31,096 --> 00:52:33,117
I mean, sometimes good things come out of that.

1052
00:52:33,157 --> 00:52:35,238
But again, I feel like it's not super fair to players

1053
00:52:35,498 --> 00:52:38,259
to just use them as our playground like that.

1054
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,641
We retro things, we talk about what went wrong,

1055
00:52:41,681 --> 00:52:43,923
we try not to beat up our teams too much for mistakes,

1056
00:52:44,043 --> 00:52:46,124
unless there's kind of a repeated pattern

1057
00:52:46,384 --> 00:52:48,326
of making the same mistakes and not learning from that.

1058
00:52:48,882 --> 00:52:53,626
So is it really on the onus of the leadership team to make sure they're hitting those talking points then?

1059
00:52:53,866 --> 00:53:00,472
Yeah, absolutely. I describe my job a lot. I do not balance League of Legends. You wouldn't want me to. It would be a travesty.

1060
00:53:01,853 --> 00:53:06,296
What I do is I talk more about creating an ecosystem in which good design decisions get made.

1061
00:53:06,677 --> 00:53:09,759
So I try to make sure people are thinking about things in frameworks.

1062
00:53:09,779 --> 00:53:16,284
And then, frankly, we just hire good people and smart designers and try to make sure they're aligned with our high-level values

1063
00:53:16,384 --> 00:53:18,106
and then turn them loose and get out of their way.

1064
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:18,995
Thank you.

1065
00:53:21,222 --> 00:53:23,964
First, thank you for your inspiring presentation.

1066
00:53:24,945 --> 00:53:28,988
I'd like to ask about the balancing of champions

1067
00:53:29,348 --> 00:53:30,529
in several stages.

1068
00:53:31,069 --> 00:53:33,031
Like, for example, you nerf one of them,

1069
00:53:33,531 --> 00:53:34,872
you see that it's not enough,

1070
00:53:35,332 --> 00:53:37,154
or it's over the edge,

1071
00:53:37,174 --> 00:53:39,355
and the next iteration you buff it a lot.

1072
00:53:39,896 --> 00:53:42,498
So which way do you prefer?

1073
00:53:43,558 --> 00:53:45,280
Do you take one champion,

1074
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,081
apply some changes,

1075
00:53:47,241 --> 00:53:49,903
and then let it sit for a while?

1076
00:53:50,797 --> 00:53:53,579
and come to it later, a lot later probably,

1077
00:53:53,599 --> 00:54:00,383
or do you try to iterate in successful patches

1078
00:54:00,644 --> 00:54:01,384
until he's perfect?

1079
00:54:02,185 --> 00:54:03,666
It really depends on the situation.

1080
00:54:03,806 --> 00:54:05,527
As I mentioned a little bit ago,

1081
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:07,368
I caution you not to like,

1082
00:54:08,209 --> 00:54:10,070
nerf the same character over and over again.

1083
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,591
I mean this happened on World of Warcraft as well,

1084
00:54:11,611 --> 00:54:13,152
where we couldn't quite solve a problem,

1085
00:54:13,192 --> 00:54:15,134
and so patch after patch there's another,

1086
00:54:15,314 --> 00:54:17,175
you know, feral druid nerf or whatever.

1087
00:54:19,076 --> 00:54:20,919
Nerfing tends to be easier than buffing, particularly when

1088
00:54:20,939 --> 00:54:23,663
you're looking at a situation where we have 10 champions that

1089
00:54:23,683 --> 00:54:24,725
are OK and one outlier.

1090
00:54:24,745 --> 00:54:26,508
And players are always like, well, why don't you buff the

1091
00:54:26,528 --> 00:54:29,152
other nine to be equal to that win rate?

1092
00:54:29,713 --> 00:54:31,215
That's just a lot harder to do.

1093
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:36,033
If you keep missing the mark, you need to step back

1094
00:54:36,093 --> 00:54:37,975
and understand why are you missing the mark.

1095
00:54:38,055 --> 00:54:39,657
Is your data collection flawed?

1096
00:54:39,917 --> 00:54:41,499
Are you just changing the wrong thing?

1097
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,901
Are players adjusting as quickly as you can?

1098
00:54:44,222 --> 00:54:47,265
Sometimes it does help just to step back and see what happens.

1099
00:54:47,665 --> 00:54:49,167
It can take the community a while

1100
00:54:49,247 --> 00:54:51,950
to develop a counter strategy to a dominant strategy.

1101
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:56,812
We do try to, you know, we describe our relationship to League's balance as curation.

1102
00:54:56,852 --> 00:55:00,413
Like Riot doesn't kind of let it out in the wild and then whatever happens, happens.

1103
00:55:00,453 --> 00:55:03,355
We do try to step in when players are experiencing too much pain.

1104
00:55:04,395 --> 00:55:04,715
Thank you.

1105
00:55:06,476 --> 00:55:09,797
Hi. I wanted to get some more of your thoughts on the...

1106
00:55:10,781 --> 00:55:13,282
the relationship between viewership and changes.

1107
00:55:14,243 --> 00:55:16,784
Like one contrast to traditional sports like soccer,

1108
00:55:17,224 --> 00:55:18,665
there's no balance changes to the game.

1109
00:55:18,725 --> 00:55:19,926
It hardly ever evolves.

1110
00:55:21,406 --> 00:55:22,427
But on the eSports side,

1111
00:55:22,927 --> 00:55:24,588
every time you're making a change, balancing,

1112
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,169
I know you mentioned that you do keep

1113
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:27,129
viewership into account,

1114
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:29,310
but how much relationship is there?

1115
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:33,512
Is there a risk of them getting out of touch with the game

1116
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,433
and then not understanding what they're watching?

1117
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:41,159
Yeah, absolutely. We do, you know, we have to take that into consideration when we make changes.

1118
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:44,681
We know that the changes we make are going to affect the pros.

1119
00:55:44,701 --> 00:55:47,483
One of the things we try to do is, you know, keep them in the loop.

1120
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:48,664
Like, as part of the discussion, like,

1121
00:55:48,904 --> 00:55:51,445
hey guys, just want to let you know, we're thinking about making this change,

1122
00:55:51,545 --> 00:55:52,526
you know, what's your reaction?

1123
00:55:52,886 --> 00:55:55,808
We don't let them balance the game for us, but we do want to get their feedback,

1124
00:55:55,848 --> 00:55:57,309
because they're very in touch with that.

1125
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:01,651
We also know that making systemic changes, like for example,

1126
00:56:01,931 --> 00:56:04,271
not that long ago we changed the dragon in League of Legends

1127
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:06,792
to actually be five different dragons that kind of spawn at random.

1128
00:56:07,332 --> 00:56:11,773
We rely a lot on our casters and analysts to help explain this to viewers.

1129
00:56:11,813 --> 00:56:14,773
We have Riot is Blessed's very exceptional talent there,

1130
00:56:15,073 --> 00:56:18,094
and they can kind of help bring players along on that journey

1131
00:56:18,114 --> 00:56:19,134
to understand what's going on.

1132
00:56:19,534 --> 00:56:20,775
It's a very complicated game.

1133
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:22,175
Thank you.

1134
00:56:24,066 --> 00:56:28,888
Hello, I wanted to ask about if an AI controlled champion

1135
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,229
being good in high ELO and low ELO,

1136
00:56:31,309 --> 00:56:32,610
like how would you balance that out

1137
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:34,191
if it's very popular on the low ELO?

1138
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:36,431
It's challenging.

1139
00:56:37,212 --> 00:56:40,613
We have a champion named Ivern, who's like a happy tree guy,

1140
00:56:41,053 --> 00:56:44,574
who has an AI, a boulder creature named Daisy.

1141
00:56:45,014 --> 00:56:48,175
And he's been pretty popular, pretty high win rate recently,

1142
00:56:48,215 --> 00:56:49,115
despite the AI.

1143
00:56:49,335 --> 00:56:51,896
I think that's because not that much of his power budget

1144
00:56:51,936 --> 00:56:53,116
is tied up in the AI.

1145
00:56:53,156 --> 00:56:54,977
He can do a lot of cool things in addition to that.

1146
00:56:55,317 --> 00:56:58,658
So if you want to have a champion that uses a lot,

1147
00:56:58,778 --> 00:57:01,179
a character in your game that uses a lot of turrets or AI,

1148
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:03,739
I would say just make sure that the power budget is

1149
00:57:03,979 --> 00:57:04,780
pretty small there.

1150
00:57:05,218 --> 00:57:05,398
OK.

1151
00:57:06,018 --> 00:57:07,639
I think we have about three minutes left.

1152
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:09,761
If we run out of time, I'm going to go over

1153
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:12,042
to the wrap-up room, which is right by the escalators

1154
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:12,462
to the left.

1155
00:57:14,076 --> 00:57:19,100
Different countries have different preferences in aesthetic choices and champions they might choose.

1156
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:25,564
How does that play into how you decide, because different countries have different playstyle choices as well?

1157
00:57:25,765 --> 00:57:26,425
Yeah, absolutely.

1158
00:57:26,925 --> 00:57:29,487
Overall we've found that players are players, and

1159
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:34,131
if a champion is cool in one region, it tends to be popular in other regions as well.

1160
00:57:34,771 --> 00:57:36,532
There are definitely regional differences.

1161
00:57:37,713 --> 00:57:41,616
Chinese players love big guys with swords. We probably couldn't make enough big guys with swords.

1162
00:57:42,537 --> 00:57:46,899
A character like Jinx, who's like this anarchist rebel, that archetype just doesn't resonate as

1163
00:57:46,999 --> 00:57:51,741
much historically in their culture as it does, say, in the West. And that's fine. We know

1164
00:57:51,781 --> 00:57:55,383
there's going to be regional differences. Some places are going to embrace a champion more than

1165
00:57:55,443 --> 00:58:00,046
others. We try to offer diversity there. We do have 130, so hopefully there will be something

1166
00:58:00,086 --> 00:58:00,486
for everyone.

1167
00:58:00,757 --> 00:58:03,498
But do you actually make any choices saying,

1168
00:58:03,518 --> 00:58:06,521
this country may like this aesthetic,

1169
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:10,143
and we want them to maybe try different play styles.

1170
00:58:10,203 --> 00:58:12,765
So we're going to actually give them this aesthetic

1171
00:58:12,805 --> 00:58:14,146
with a varying play style.

1172
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,148
One strategy we use that can help there

1173
00:58:17,188 --> 00:58:19,830
are the champion skins, which change the look and sometimes

1174
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:21,170
the voice of a champion quite a bit.

1175
00:58:21,551 --> 00:58:25,533
So we can introduce a champion or a line of skins

1176
00:58:25,594 --> 00:58:25,794
that

1177
00:58:26,534 --> 00:58:29,618
you know, has to do with a holiday or historical event in some country,

1178
00:58:29,658 --> 00:58:31,520
knowing that they may not have widespread appeal,

1179
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,581
but those players are going to love it.

1180
00:58:33,442 --> 00:58:33,623
Cheers.

1181
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:40,451
How do you feel about players and fan sites gathering and sharing data

1182
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:43,414
in order to help each other to play the game?

1183
00:58:43,434 --> 00:58:44,776
That's a really good question.

1184
00:58:46,238 --> 00:58:48,059
I mean, overall, I don't begrudge them from doing that.

1185
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:49,479
It totally makes sense why players

1186
00:58:49,579 --> 00:58:50,940
want that information, particularly given

1187
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,800
that we don't provide it.

1188
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:54,742
The challenge is that sometimes the data is wrong.

1189
00:58:55,362 --> 00:58:57,943
And in those cases, as developers,

1190
00:58:57,983 --> 00:59:00,204
we don't have the bandwidth to go debug it and explain

1191
00:59:00,224 --> 00:59:01,265
to players why it's wrong.

1192
00:59:01,565 --> 00:59:03,666
So we end up just kind of waving our hands and say, oh yeah,

1193
00:59:03,686 --> 00:59:04,426
that data is bad.

1194
00:59:04,626 --> 00:59:06,407
And then players are left scratching their heads.

1195
00:59:06,827 --> 00:59:08,088
This is why we're talking a lot about,

1196
00:59:08,408 --> 00:59:10,949
does it just make sense to offer the information out there?

1197
00:59:11,449 --> 00:59:14,715
For example, a lot of the fan sites that offer data on League

1198
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:17,659
only look at high platinum, which is not going to tell you

1199
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,783
the whole story because very few of us are high platinum.

1200
00:59:21,646 --> 00:59:22,728
Maybe we have time for one more question.

1201
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:23,108
Are we good?

1202
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:24,330
All right.

1203
00:59:24,451 --> 00:59:24,971
Thank you very much.
