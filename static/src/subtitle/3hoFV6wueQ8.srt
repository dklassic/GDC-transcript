00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:06,754
Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:06,754 --> 00:00:08,875
Good afternoon, depending on where you are in the world.

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,937
Good evening to our developer friends

4
00:00:11,937 --> 00:00:14,459
who are joining us in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.

5
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:17,421
My name is Brian Francis. Welcome to the GDC Twitch channel.

6
00:00:17,421 --> 00:00:21,003
We are here today checking out a wonderful game.

7
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:23,385
I am obsessed with it. Hopefully you're obsessed with it, too.

8
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:24,846
It's called Loop Hero.

9
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:27,248
I'm so excited to have two wonderful guests

10
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:30,029
who are in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.

11
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:38,355
First off, we have Aleksandr Vatazerian, aka FlynnLol, and Aleksandr Gorslavac, aka Blinch,

12
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:40,677
since both of their first names are Aleksandr.

13
00:00:40,677 --> 00:00:42,098
We're gonna call them FlynnLol and Blinch today.

14
00:00:42,098 --> 00:00:46,321
They're the developers from 4QuarterTeam who brought us Loop Hero.

15
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:49,423
FlynnLol and Blinch, would you guys please introduce yourselves?

16
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:49,763
Hello.

17
00:00:49,763 --> 00:00:50,844
You are on the camera, so you go first.

18
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:06,838
Okay, I'm Lynch, I'm a composer and sound designer and partly a game designer at Flute Hero.

19
00:01:06,838 --> 00:01:10,160
Hello, I don't know what to say.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:17,326
And I'm Alexander, I'm a programmer and like, I'm sorry, I'm a programmer and an artist.

21
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:19,568
This, some of that, and some of that.

22
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:22,234
It's so nice to have you guys on the channel.

23
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:27,319
As I said, before we started talking, I am so excited about this game.

24
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,400
It is so much fun.

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,305
I start playing it and then 90 minutes go by and I just don't remember how anything...

26
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:35,067
Like, I just don't remember how time works anymore.

27
00:01:36,027 --> 00:01:41,310
You all might hear some noises from my machine. I'm switching between two machines, so it makes some Windows notification beeps.

28
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:48,253
Sorry about that. That's just trying to manage this whole system by myself. So, Loop Hero, as you can see, we're playing it right now.

29
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:51,074
Let me know in chat if there's any issues with audio or video.

30
00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:56,877
This is a game where your adventurer just sort of goes on a loop,

31
00:01:56,877 --> 00:02:00,718
and you build the environment in which they go with the loop on. That's a very poor way to explain it.

32
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,440
There's a lot of neat backstory game design going on.

33
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:13,043
It's to me. I find this game incredibly compelling. It's incredibly I don't like the word addicting, but it's the shortest word to explain what?

34
00:02:13,043 --> 00:02:19,045
Addictions obviously a big serious thing, but it's so cool. It's a neat game. Um, so Finlow and Blinch

35
00:02:19,045 --> 00:02:22,266
I'm gonna be asking you questions if you are watching in twitch chat

36
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:25,927
Please feel free to ask your own questions. I will grab them

37
00:02:25,927 --> 00:02:29,228
I've got the whole monitor set up here so I can read chat and answer your questions

38
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:32,969
And yeah, whatever you've got for the devs. We want to hear it

39
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:37,671
So to get started, let's just lay some groundwork.

40
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:41,433
Let's go to the beginning of development for Loop Hero.

41
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:49,857
Where did the idea for Loop Hero come from, and how did it change from

42
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:50,898
prototyping the game to finishing the game?

43
00:02:50,898 --> 00:02:55,960
It comes from pretty old conversation with our

44
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,123
main artist and main game designer Dmitri Karimov aka Desira.

45
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:07,570
And we were just talking with him about zero player game genre, where you not directly

46
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,534
control your hero and not actually control game itself.

47
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:11,654
But it's...

48
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:23,565
And yeah, it's come from this conversation that Dmitry just was talking about his idea

49
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:25,507
about little hero who walk in the...

50
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:35,907
a circle road and player must just build some tiles around the road and try to balance

51
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:43,570
this how it's difficult and how main hero getting stronger this monster and battles on this road.

52
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:54,094
So it was not for you know we did not jump in right after it we just okay interesting idea

53
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:55,935
and forgot about it.

54
00:03:56,575 --> 00:04:02,718
Yeah, then we joined Ludum Dare 20... 45?

55
00:04:02,718 --> 00:04:07,821
Yeah, I mean, it was October 20...

56
00:04:07,821 --> 00:04:10,062
Yeah, sorry.

57
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:16,826
Yeah, 19, 2019, and it was Ludum Dare about Start With Nothing.

58
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:25,751
And we have not really good idea for this, but then we remember about...

59
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:33,243
that idea about the little hero who just walking in circles and we're like okay he it's pretty

60
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:41,046
much he start with nothing let's try something and yeah that's where it's come from but yeah

61
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:50,430
yeah it's just where it came from uh deceiver uh said always says that it was like a mental

62
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,311
training for him to come up with um

63
00:04:53,285 --> 00:05:02,049
like mechanics that will allow zero player game to be engaging, because he just likes

64
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:06,671
to think about stuff like that and also he likes clickers.

65
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:09,933
It is, it does feel kind of like a clicker game.

66
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:15,275
What changed, just to sort of repeat the second half of my question, what changed in making

67
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:17,416
Looper from those first ideas?

68
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,537
What were some of the biggest changes the game went through as you worked on it and

69
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:21,178
finished it?

70
00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:24,944
Our idea is pretty like it is right now.

71
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:30,067
It's about the same little hero who just walk in circle.

72
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:36,350
But yeah, but then we're making it complex and complex

73
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:43,434
and add a lot of things like game building, storytelling,

74
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:48,157
tiles, synergy, when it's transformed by each other.

75
00:05:48,157 --> 00:05:49,658
The transformation of tiles.

76
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:54,283
Yeah, and the perk system and many others.

77
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:59,325
So our idea is not change too much,

78
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,946
but we are adding a lot of new things.

79
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:06,448
We can talk a little bit more, like you said,

80
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:10,230
this is a game where the player doesn't control the combat.

81
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,431
They don't control the hero.

82
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:14,592
So there's kind of this automatic combat system

83
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:16,493
that you can see on screen right now.

84
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:33,645
I was worried when I first saw it that it might, I don't know, like, you know, we think of games, we think of combat games, we think, oh, like, combat has to be fun, and the game playing itself for you doesn't automatically seem fun at first, when you first see it.

85
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:35,167
The idea might not be, I guess.

86
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:41,913
What do you think is fun about it? Because it's very strange to be sitting here, you know, we're watching the game right now.

87
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:52,219
And I'm looking back at what I was playing a few days ago, and it's still compelling to just watch the automatic little fights play out, you know, even though it's just kind of numbers.

88
00:06:52,219 --> 00:07:03,206
I know in my head it's just numbers sort of firing off and I have no control over it, but it's there, it's compelling. What do you think works about that?

89
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:06,828
You don't control the button in the game, but...

90
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,981
You control everything else on the screen.

91
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:21,546
You set up your hero builds, inventory perks, some additional stuff from camp.

92
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:32,811
And it's like you set up this mechanism and just watching how it will work.

93
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,320
And it's pretty addictive thing.

94
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,781
And sometimes it works, sometimes it's not.

95
00:07:39,781 --> 00:07:46,322
You can't say how your current action will affect in the long distance.

96
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:48,022
It's really interesting to see.

97
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:49,342
Will it work or not?

98
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:53,863
Maybe I can, you know, little tweak it, try something else next time.

99
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:55,203
And yeah, that is.

100
00:07:55,203 --> 00:08:01,885
And as for why it works, like, it's kind of like watching a stream.

101
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:08,855
You cannot really control the streamer when you're watching him.

102
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:17,279
You still are rooting for them because

103
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,620
you want them to win and

104
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:27,563
when they fail, you get sad, and when they win, you get happy.

105
00:08:27,563 --> 00:08:30,825
That's the kind of thing that goes on here.

106
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:32,405
It's like your little Tamagotchi.

107
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:37,862
Oh, I like that. It feels like Tamagotchi actually.

108
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:42,306
Like, or for me, God, it feels like the, there were these Digimon Tamagotchi.

109
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:45,149
I don't know if you, if you had Digimon in your, uh, or like in the 90s or like

110
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:49,033
there was little toys you could carry around and go on walks with and they

111
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:52,075
would battle automatically. It's actually very similar to that.

112
00:08:53,832 --> 00:09:00,259
Um, okay, so our next question is going to be, um, we can talk about the environment card.

113
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:05,104
So if you're looking at the screen right now on the lower left-hand corner, if you know, loop here, you know, all this, but I'm explaining for the new folks.

114
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:08,588
If you're on the lower left-hand corner of the screen, there are environment cards.

115
00:09:08,588 --> 00:09:12,051
Um, some of them you place on the side, as you can see with all those rocks in the mountain.

116
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:15,933
Other ones you place on the path that the hero walks on.

117
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:24,937
These spawn more monsters and combine in ways to increase the difficulty for the little guy making the loop.

118
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:32,281
How do you feel you've been able to encourage players to try and experiment with these cards, to try new things?

119
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:38,904
Because when you put a card down what you're essentially saying is, okay, I want more monsters and

120
00:09:39,384 --> 00:09:45,666
I can see why someone might, like myself for instance, I was like, I don't know why I would make it harder for myself, I don't know why I would make more monsters.

121
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:54,790
And I sort of figured out why after a while, but I'm curious as developers, like, how did you make players want to try new cards and new experiments?

122
00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:08,355
I guess it's just the core idea of the game is that you have to balance between making it too easy and too hard.

123
00:10:08,355 --> 00:10:08,495
Uh-huh.

124
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:08,755
And...

125
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:13,461
Again, you didn't have...

126
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:22,105
You didn't know why you should place more monsters on the road, but then you tried not doing that and okay, yeah, that is not getting me

127
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:29,750
closer to winning, so I will try to place monsters and then you start to do it because

128
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,731
if you don't, you get bad loot from slimes

129
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:37,594
you cannot summon the boss and if you do, it's very late loop and you die.

130
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:40,370
So you have to basically.

131
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:46,913
Yeah, it's also part of learning about game because firstly you just walk around and

132
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:55,057
yeah, when you're just starting the game, you don't feel it's difficult because you know player, I mean hero just

133
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:55,197
fight

134
00:10:58,085 --> 00:11:00,666
by his own, and it's not difficult.

135
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:04,407
So, okay, I will put these spiders, for example,

136
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:05,687
and it's still not difficult.

137
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:11,069
And the player just starting to place any tiles chaotically

138
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:14,850
because he don't understand how it affect

139
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,951
his run for long distance.

140
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:20,792
And then he dies, and he like, okay.

141
00:11:21,337 --> 00:11:26,000
he recognized, he realized that it's not working.

142
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,841
Maybe I need to place little bit less monster,

143
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:33,584
or maybe I need to try put other monster instead this one.

144
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:37,347
And yeah, and it's only how it started.

145
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:41,410
And it's process during whole game,

146
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,972
like you're just trying to tweak it for your best.

147
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:52,137
um that strategy for game how it will be perfect balance for your hero and

148
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:58,860
i'll be and then and then you just unlock new classes and it's all not work for

149
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,683
them and you need started by a new cycle of this

150
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:05,083
balancing stuff

151
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:12,903
Um, just a fun anecdote I can share. So when I was playing my partner who's also playing this game and she's a few hours ahead of me

152
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:14,725
And she's seeing things I haven't seen yet

153
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:17,269
She walked over while I was playing not this specific run

154
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:21,975
But like a run essentially that where I was playing like this and she just said it screamed out loud

155
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:22,756
Like why have you put?

156
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:26,519
all that stuff together. Like, why have you made this so hard for yourself?"

157
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,321
And I was like, I don't know. And then we just started like, like, as soon as she said that,

158
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:36,204
something like one of the, the, oh yeah, it was, I layered the graveyards on top of each other,

159
00:12:36,204 --> 00:12:40,746
and we had, um, uh, like, it was like, oh, a vampire died, and then there was a ghost,

160
00:12:40,746 --> 00:12:44,008
and then there was a ghost of a ghost, and then the primal matter showed up, and she audibly

161
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:48,070
screamed like, what the hell is that? Like, I haven't seen that. She's, and I'm just like,

162
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,931
I don't know, I'm just...

163
00:12:49,411 --> 00:12:53,794
I push button and loop hero go burr if you get that.

164
00:12:53,794 --> 00:12:59,116
So that was a really fun, like our two different play styles collided right away.

165
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:05,340
And my more aggressive layering approach, which you can see right now, threw her off.

166
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:14,605
And it's always funny to see how people play differently.

167
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:23,100
You know, every people find out some own strategy and it's always interesting to see how they

168
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,661
will be, you know, set up their roles, which tiles they choose.

169
00:13:26,661 --> 00:13:31,282
It's really interesting how many variations these people found.

170
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:36,303
Yeah, I, this isn't something we talked about, this isn't in the questions I sent you guys

171
00:13:36,303 --> 00:13:42,284
before, but I kind of found as I was playing that, um, uh, uh, um.

172
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:49,553
What one thing I experienced was after a while like some cards just weren't fun for me

173
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:52,035
I guess like I might go. Oh, okay

174
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:57,739
Like I've had like the spiders for instance the spider card in my kit for a while

175
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:02,303
But now I've got some new things and I'm making decisions about trading them out and I'm after a while

176
00:14:02,303 --> 00:14:06,706
I was like, I know this thing gives me rewards and there are specific rewards I can get out of this, but I

177
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:12,350
I just like, I just, the swamp is actually a much better example. The swamp, I picked it up because I'm like,

178
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:17,253
Oh, I see what this does. This makes my healing damage. So I need to be careful with this.

179
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:19,395
So I need to build a strategy that's less involved around healing.

180
00:14:19,395 --> 00:14:21,956
And this early in the game, I finally hit a point where I was like,

181
00:14:21,956 --> 00:14:26,780
Oh, but healing's like fun and not like, it was kind of like, I was like,

182
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,942
Wow, this kind of sucks to be in the middle of a swamp and in a longer fight.

183
00:14:29,942 --> 00:14:32,223
And my health was just tanking. And I was just like,

184
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:35,085
Okay, well, I'll just turn off the swamp and try another environment.

185
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:37,106
And I was surprised at like,

186
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:42,011
I was surprised at just how it came how it all worked out

187
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:44,433
And you died at the swamp on the footage

188
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:49,478
Yeah, we get to see my past mistakes here

189
00:14:49,478 --> 00:14:52,642
WL stride is w w1 wf stride

190
00:14:52,642 --> 00:15:00,930
Has shown up in the chat wf stride. Thank you so much for watching

191
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:04,072
WF stride

192
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:10,996
Dut has a question for us, which is where did you get the idea for this type of looping game mechanic?

193
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:14,378
We kind of talked about where it came from before

194
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:21,843
So we don't want to totally retread that ground, but I will say WF stride wants to say great game by the way, so

195
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:24,744
That's one person in chat who's already written for y'all

196
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:30,905
So, I guess we can build on that question about where the looping came from, and more like, um...

197
00:15:30,905 --> 00:15:32,986
It kind of feels like a programming loop, doesn't it?

198
00:15:32,986 --> 00:15:37,850
Like, this game feels like, you know, like, uh, you set up a loop in, you know, when you're coding or whatever,

199
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,192
an if-then, and then the loop just kind of keeps running, um...

200
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:47,594
Where did the idea evolve from, you know, you talked about having a hero you don't control

201
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:52,218
And doing that game jam doing Ludum Dare. I think it was

202
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:58,943
When did you sort of have the idea to like have this kind of a almost like a programming loop come into play?

203
00:15:58,943 --> 00:16:04,068
It was just an in the original idea that yeah

204
00:16:05,628 --> 00:16:13,571
you build the road tile and you have to like leave with it now because it will stay there

205
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:21,274
and you will pass it multiple times. So you build something and then you will interact with this

206
00:16:21,274 --> 00:16:28,637
many times on the loop so yeah it was original idea it's not something which will come later here.

207
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:33,239
Cool yeah. So it's like the very basic part it's like

208
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,182
When did you get the idea that in a shooter you shoot a gun?

209
00:16:38,182 --> 00:16:45,426
Yeah, so Stride, if you didn't catch it, I totally recommend going back to the front of the

210
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:50,689
the top of the stream and seeing the full story they gave about the game's origin.

211
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:57,693
We've also got another question from Video Space Games. They wanted to say they also love this game.

212
00:16:57,693 --> 00:17:00,835
They want to ask, was this game inspired by idle games at all?

213
00:17:03,258 --> 00:17:10,462
It was, as I said before, we were just talking about idle games and about zero player games,

214
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:16,927
but it was not, you know, directly inspired by some specific game.

215
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:24,051
So it was like a conversation about genre itself, but pretty quick Loot Hero has grown

216
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:25,672
up from this genre.

217
00:17:26,153 --> 00:17:27,955
and now it's something different.

218
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:32,340
But yeah, originally it was just our thoughts

219
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,323
about zero playing a game each other.

220
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:40,512
Right. What do you think idle games do so well that, you know, like we talked about earlier,

221
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:44,835
like the sort of the notion that every game must be as interactive as possible. And as,

222
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:51,120
but I know I love idle games. I'm playing one on my phone right now. That absolutely has like the

223
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,323
deepest grind. I'm not going to name it because I don't want to name and shame, but it's good.

224
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:58,786
Just got this really deep grind. And I'm like, oh, this is very hard, but I don't do much,

225
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:03,210
but I like this. Like, what do you guys think is so compelling about idle play?

226
00:18:06,411 --> 00:18:10,353
If you're talking about Loop Hero, it's not actually an idle game.

227
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:15,877
Like, it's health, but it's a little bit part of Loop Hero.

228
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:20,700
It's an idle game if you're talking about hero control.

229
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:28,644
But, you know, after you're playing some time, you understand you need to do a lot of action in this game.

230
00:18:28,644 --> 00:18:33,227
Yeah, it depends on your attention for the game.

231
00:18:33,227 --> 00:18:34,988
So it's not really idle, but...

232
00:18:35,644 --> 00:18:38,705
why idle games are so addictive.

233
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:48,990
I think people just like to see how numbers increase infinity and you just can a little

234
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,531
bit rest while playing them.

235
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:55,172
So maybe because...

236
00:18:55,172 --> 00:19:00,794
Maybe Fennval can know more about idle games.

237
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:01,675
Yeah, yeah.

238
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:04,556
Maybe it's just basically you...

239
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:13,977
your brain gets happy when numbers go up and in idle games you don't really have to...

240
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:20,140
work for it, you can just meditate and see numbers go up and that's it.

241
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,362
Yeah, I do think you guys have done a really good job adapting that

242
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:28,363
and even with with more interactivity like we're seeing like almost every few

243
00:19:28,363 --> 00:19:30,664
seconds you can see me in this footage like moving around

244
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:33,566
and clicking and it's some of it is numbers going up but like

245
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:36,667
you know there's the neatness of making that mountain in the lower left hand

246
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:37,607
corner there's

247
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:43,473
laying out combos on the path. I really think you guys have done a good job adapting

248
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:47,095
both that idle factor even while you increase the interactivity.

249
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:54,079
We're gonna go to our next question in chat from IllmadeCoder. This is a long one so

250
00:19:54,079 --> 00:20:00,022
just give me a second to read if you have to read all of it. IllmadeCoder says that they

251
00:20:00,022 --> 00:20:04,445
were playing around with remaking this game as a side project. Is that a kosher thing to

252
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:05,625
bring up in an interview? I don't know.

253
00:20:05,845 --> 00:20:09,969
That they're trying to remake your game, but hey, I guess you inspired them

254
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:15,495
And I was they were they said they were playing around with the classes being within items

255
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:17,817
Rather than being something you choose

256
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:22,301
So instead you would try to have to form a build for the class via the equipment slots

257
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:27,186
Was that something that was ever thought of in design and do you think that would be tricky to pull off?

258
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:38,954
We actually were talking at some point about kind of system like that, but it's...

259
00:20:38,954 --> 00:20:56,322
Like, it might be not promising anything, not saying it will, but there is a small chance that it will be implemented in the game, kind of system like that is...

260
00:20:58,205 --> 00:21:08,793
your equipment making you more of the class, but don't know.

261
00:21:08,793 --> 00:21:12,596
It was just one talk, one little talk, and that's it.

262
00:21:12,596 --> 00:21:17,739
Blitz, is there anything you want to add?

263
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:22,023
Actually, no. We don't have any plans for it right now.

264
00:21:22,023 --> 00:21:23,664
We talked about some...

265
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:30,626
Making class system more complex, but not something specific, but we can announce right now. So

266
00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:34,387
That's that's totally fair. I'm honestly I'm super I'm

267
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:38,729
Appreciate you guys saying that it was an idea. So good. You're you might do it yourself. Um,

268
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:44,471
We discussed something like that at some point but

269
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:50,953
Not it's it's not in the game as you can see you just pick the class and that's it right

270
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:58,220
Um, yeah, so my next question, um, uh, IllmadeCoder wants to say,

271
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,402
add, uh, by the way, they're just remaking the game for fun and to learn not to try and compete.

272
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:08,624
Uh, yeah, IllmadeCoder, I can only say for myself, uh, I admire you trying to

273
00:22:08,624 --> 00:22:10,644
retro-engineer this game, so I think that's super neat.

274
00:22:10,644 --> 00:22:11,365
Um.

275
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:15,206
My next question is going to be

276
00:22:15,206 --> 00:22:22,208
Were there any challenges when it came to like readability and have having players understand what was going on?

277
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,929
You've got this incredible pixel art aesthetic

278
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:33,551
I personally sometimes myself have trouble seeing exactly what is happening on screen

279
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:38,313
It hits harder in town like when I look if we get back to the town

280
00:22:39,513 --> 00:22:44,756
Part of the game in a bit I can describe it more accurately but sometimes when I'm looking at you know right now

281
00:22:44,756 --> 00:22:49,018
I can sort of clearly see okay. Those are the mountains. That's the grass and I can pick out

282
00:22:49,018 --> 00:22:52,159
You know the swamp the field the vampire mansion the blood trees

283
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,281
There's no vampires out right now because I think I turn them off the goblin camp, but

284
00:22:55,281 --> 00:23:01,884
You know, it's I don't I you understand that after hours of play, you know things become more familiar

285
00:23:01,884 --> 00:23:03,805
But I'm curious when making this game

286
00:23:03,805 --> 00:23:09,008
Did you have any challenges about you know, we're making sure players understood was going on just at a glance

287
00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:29,863
It's DeSiva who drew all the styles and sometimes he redrew a few ones for more readability and

288
00:23:29,863 --> 00:23:39,069
desert for example and rocks and mountains as I remember too. Road as well. So yeah it's

289
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:47,695
it was some challenge for it and maybe we still have a few problems. Maybe we want to for example

290
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:57,318
make something for you and notice your hero is more clearly on late loops when it's you know

291
00:23:57,318 --> 00:24:09,902
too many enemies and you can't see where your hero going so yeah we're planning to

292
00:24:09,902 --> 00:24:14,883
improve it so it was a lot of challenge but

293
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:23,737
Yeah, as I said, Deceiver is a cool artist and who made all the styles and it's definitely

294
00:24:23,737 --> 00:24:27,839
a new task for him, so we just can't answer this for sure.

295
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,619
That's totally fair.

296
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:35,862
I think he did a good job overall, just, you know, it's, I think, as displays have gotten

297
00:24:35,862 --> 00:24:40,804
bigger, pixel art, you know, pixel art was made for smaller screens, smaller computing

298
00:24:40,804 --> 00:24:44,846
power, and sometimes as those two things have scaled up.

299
00:24:45,346 --> 00:24:56,458
I've just noticed that it sometimes creates, you know, sometimes it's just as hard to read as, you know, mushy pixels in less good games from yesteryear might have been.

300
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:59,701
Not this game necessarily, just pixel art as a broad art.

301
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:03,405
Um, let's take kind of a programming tack.

302
00:25:03,405 --> 00:25:06,088
Um, uh, obviously as...

303
00:25:06,608 --> 00:25:14,552
As, um, this, this game, as loops in this game get more and more elaborate and complex,

304
00:25:14,552 --> 00:25:19,094
um, you know, the game is trying to, you know, layer, uh, different, different systems and

305
00:25:19,094 --> 00:25:24,816
remember, okay, you know, if there's a graveyard, then ghosts, you know, are supposed to spawn,

306
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:27,558
um, or enemies are supposed to become ghosts. If there's vampires...

307
00:25:28,158 --> 00:25:32,821
They get regen in you and the stacking complexity gets gets very uh,

308
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:36,964
Uh, it grows and it scales in complexity

309
00:25:36,964 --> 00:25:41,788
As and it may you know, this is still early in the game the footage we're looking at but i'm sure as it goes on

310
00:25:41,788 --> 00:25:46,131
It gets even more and more complex. Um, were there any challenges when it came to?

311
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:51,873
kind of making sure the game and the game's core structure could handle all that information coming

312
00:25:51,873 --> 00:25:56,434
in rapidly. You know, because sometimes when I've talked to game programmers, you know,

313
00:25:56,434 --> 00:26:00,115
and they're working on less graphically complex games, obviously, you know, when you have a game

314
00:26:00,115 --> 00:26:04,096
that has realistic lighting, when you have more realistic features, those are very complex to

315
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:07,536
render. But then, you know, strategy game developers have told me, like, man, like,

316
00:26:07,536 --> 00:26:11,857
when you are trying to, like, make sure your game can store and run all this complex information,

317
00:26:11,857 --> 00:26:16,518
like, that's actually its own challenge that's less visible to players. Did anything like that

318
00:26:16,538 --> 00:26:27,348
come up in development not really I mean storing like an array or a like a

319
00:26:27,348 --> 00:26:35,335
single variable it's very cheap like a computer from 2005 can handle it easily

320
00:26:35,335 --> 00:26:41,841
and oh more than more than that like an enemy is just basically

321
00:26:42,796 --> 00:26:51,942
a number of variables, maybe like a hundred, but a hundred variables is still

322
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:55,445
bytes or kilobytes of data. So

323
00:26:55,445 --> 00:26:55,945
it's, it's not much.

324
00:26:55,945 --> 00:27:01,709
Maybe in strategies, like if it's a global strategy with a

325
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:08,094
thousand of units and they're in 3d and they have vectors and they have like,

326
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,789
3D lightning with the...

327
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:13,571
with like the...

328
00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:14,572
how do you call it?

329
00:27:14,572 --> 00:27:18,395
The lion that goes from the...

330
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:19,876
from the thing.

331
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:22,958
The drace.

332
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:23,359
Yeah.

333
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,540
Then you will

334
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,242
need more memory, but

335
00:27:27,242 --> 00:27:28,062
here, no.

336
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:31,045
It's very easy to store it all.

337
00:27:31,045 --> 00:27:32,906
And for the complexity...

338
00:27:35,682 --> 00:27:43,365
There were challenges because there are only two programmers and one day we are thinking what to do with like four...

339
00:27:43,365 --> 00:27:48,907
There are four chapters in the game. I guess you can spoil it.

340
00:27:48,907 --> 00:27:50,728
Yeah.

341
00:27:50,728 --> 00:27:54,409
Yeah, maybe I shouldn't but it's too late already.

342
00:27:55,537 --> 00:28:02,561
And we were thinking, okay, there are four chapters, how we make enemies more interesting.

343
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:11,947
So some of them have skills, maybe we just make that their skill can proc with more percentage with each chapter.

344
00:28:11,947 --> 00:28:13,107
So like spiders can...

345
00:28:14,284 --> 00:28:18,968
throw a web with 5% at first chapter, 10% at second, and so on.

346
00:28:18,968 --> 00:28:27,774
But then we decided that, no, we can add a new skill for each enemy each chapter.

347
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:31,776
So there are like hundreds of skills.

348
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:35,279
There are more, actually.

349
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,001
Like...

350
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:38,481
Yeah, and...

351
00:28:41,004 --> 00:28:42,927
Two guys had to code 100 skills, which was...

352
00:28:42,927 --> 00:28:43,828
Yeah, it was...

353
00:28:43,828 --> 00:28:55,523
It was hard, and then it turned out that some of the skills didn't work, some did break something, some...

354
00:28:57,851 --> 00:29:07,677
messed with some other parts of the game and we had to test it a lot and people still found some skills really broken in certain circumstances,

355
00:29:07,677 --> 00:29:11,319
despite all the testing, because we just couldn't test everything.

356
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:11,639
Yeah.

357
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:21,264
And there were rare occasions in which the game just soft-locked, basically, because one of the skills...

358
00:29:23,877 --> 00:29:29,028
Um without but we we we are we are working on it honestly

359
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:42,182
Without teaching the audience how to softlock Loop Hero, is there a particular skill or skill interaction that surprised you?

360
00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:50,744
Either something you guys found while you were developing the game, or is there something...

361
00:29:50,744 --> 00:29:57,586
Any type of this interaction, it was some skill combination or skill itself, or even...

362
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:00,480
I don't know.

363
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,744
Any type of this skill activity can break the game.

364
00:30:05,744 --> 00:30:12,210
We have really a lot of testing, trying to catch everyone.

365
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:20,356
But we still find out some skill broken or not working as they must.

366
00:30:20,356 --> 00:30:26,141
So yeah, it was a pretty challenging part of the development.

367
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,753
Was there any skill interaction that was really funny that you didn't expect?

368
00:30:30,753 --> 00:30:37,277
Because I already think there's a lot of funny ones that are by design, but what are the unintentional ones, I think?

369
00:30:37,277 --> 00:30:46,444
I can remember, for example, last one, but it's not really funny and we have a lot of negative feedback because of it.

370
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:49,326
Harpies in the game have ability.

371
00:30:49,326 --> 00:30:54,930
How many punches they get, then the armor is increased by every punch.

372
00:30:56,318 --> 00:31:06,006
every hit I mean. So if you have an archer in a tower of archers from your camp,

373
00:31:06,006 --> 00:31:14,233
so around your campfire, you have some additional support from them and they

374
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:25,482
strike pretty fast. So if you have four archers who strike with like, I don't remember, maybe

375
00:31:26,109 --> 00:31:36,036
to hit in second. This harpies getting like citadel of armor pretty fast.

376
00:31:36,036 --> 00:31:39,798
Yeah. And you can kill them like no chances.

377
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:45,222
And we have no combo. Basically you cannot damage them at all sometimes

378
00:31:45,222 --> 00:31:48,704
because they can have vampirism or regen.

379
00:31:49,145 --> 00:31:58,653
too high and like you did one damage then they heal five so just impossible to yeah and and many

380
00:31:58,653 --> 00:32:07,220
people no it's maybe not many but some people get this softlock and some of them was too angry and

381
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:15,967
try to i don't know shut out for us you know because of this little bug but we've already fixed

382
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:16,747
um and

383
00:32:18,085 --> 00:32:23,147
This sort of things sometimes appears and you can't predict everything.

384
00:32:23,147 --> 00:32:30,109
For example, it's one of the latest enemies in the game.

385
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:39,371
It's Seeran and they have ability to summon jellyfish on the battle.

386
00:32:39,371 --> 00:32:46,573
I'm not remember for sure, but it was some broken ability and they summon not...

387
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:54,375
like infinity jellyfish on the battle map and you can kill them and

388
00:32:54,375 --> 00:33:00,777
uh oh no it was a combination of ability they have a second ability

389
00:33:00,777 --> 00:33:05,619
um about if uh water type of the enemy on the

390
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:09,720
bottom around them they have more um

391
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:17,242
uh evasion yeah percent and its evasion percent was more than 100

392
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,744
And you can kill them, no chances to.

393
00:33:21,744 --> 00:33:25,487
But it was before release of demo and we fixed it.

394
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:31,834
Yeah, it's basically when you kill a jellyfish, like...

395
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,861
The siren counted the dead jellyfish's evasion also.

396
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:38,501
Uh-huh, yeah.

397
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:39,882
Yeah, yeah, so it was like...

398
00:33:39,882 --> 00:33:45,383
It never needs to have 20 evasion for each jellyfish that ever was on the battlefield.

399
00:33:45,383 --> 00:33:51,164
Although it should always have plus 20 and that's it.

400
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:56,886
Even if there are like four jellyfishes at once, just plus 20.

401
00:33:57,462 --> 00:34:03,387
There also was a funny bug with the skeletons cracking.

402
00:34:03,387 --> 00:34:09,672
The skeletons can crack and not die immediately, and you have to find the cracked skeleton.

403
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:17,819
There was a bug in which a skeleton spawned a cracked skeleton every frame of the game,

404
00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:20,681
and there was an infinite amount of them.

405
00:34:20,681 --> 00:34:22,743
Oh no.

406
00:34:22,743 --> 00:34:25,385
So yeah, and...

407
00:34:26,422 --> 00:34:34,267
you attack and you have like 100 damage numbers appearing each uh each frame oh god it was it was

408
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:42,512
funny i i love it when um i love it when bugs in this game are combinations this is something that

409
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:44,874
already happens naturally which is that

410
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,504
the combinations of skills. Oh yeah, this is my first encounter with the boss. We get

411
00:34:51,504 --> 00:34:57,730
to see me die to the boss for the first time. To the lich. I like it, I like how the combinations

412
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:00,532
of skills create interesting thematic...

413
00:35:01,373 --> 00:35:08,276
Elements, you know like when the vampires give everyone regen. That's a basic example. I already like that

414
00:35:08,276 --> 00:35:13,258
I like it when even more when the the bugs, you know create these thematic like it's thematic and it's

415
00:35:13,258 --> 00:35:23,282
Existentially horrifying to consider, you know sirens that just have all the jellyfish and their corpses help them

416
00:35:23,282 --> 00:35:23,442
I

417
00:35:23,442 --> 00:35:29,564
Just sent my favorite bug from the development in the discord. Maybe you can show it somehow. Uh, just send it in chat

418
00:35:29,564 --> 00:35:30,485
Did you type it?

419
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,982
No, it's just a gif in the discord.

420
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:35,683
Oh, it's a gif.

421
00:35:35,683 --> 00:35:37,444
Uh, let me...

422
00:35:37,444 --> 00:35:39,386
Okay, we're gonna pop out.

423
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:40,366
Uh, da da da da da...

424
00:35:40,366 --> 00:35:41,607
I'm gonna get it on screen.

425
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:42,288
Okay, so...

426
00:35:42,288 --> 00:35:47,772
Uh, I need to, uh, fullscreen this.

427
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:48,573
Come on.

428
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:49,693
Okay, so we're looking at...

429
00:35:49,693 --> 00:35:54,657
If you look at the lower left-hand corner of the screen right now...

430
00:35:54,657 --> 00:35:55,838
Uh, oh my god!

431
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:57,099
Oh my god! What happened?

432
00:35:57,099 --> 00:35:59,461
What am I looking at? I'm seeing...

433
00:35:59,461 --> 00:35:59,641
Oh no!

434
00:36:01,297 --> 00:36:02,899
I forgot two breaks in code.

435
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:07,563
Basically, I'm going to, I'm going to try and fullscreen this.

436
00:36:07,563 --> 00:36:07,844
Hang on.

437
00:36:07,844 --> 00:36:09,966
I want to, I want everyone to see this.

438
00:36:09,966 --> 00:36:11,167
Okay.

439
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:13,790
And every of them have their own.

440
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,190
Okay.

441
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,332
So we're popping this out.

442
00:36:16,332 --> 00:36:19,956
We're going to pop this out so that everyone gets a full screen view of this.

443
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:21,177
This is incredible.

444
00:36:21,177 --> 00:36:25,281
So you've got two breaks in the code and what exactly am I looking at here?

445
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:31,402
Well, I don't want to spoil the mechanic of the...

446
00:36:31,402 --> 00:36:31,702
of a few cards.

447
00:36:31,702 --> 00:36:31,882
So, just...

448
00:36:31,882 --> 00:36:32,642
You actually can. You actually can.

449
00:36:32,642 --> 00:36:37,686
It's, you know, game developer conference.

450
00:36:37,686 --> 00:36:39,367
Yeah. Well, let's assume...

451
00:36:39,367 --> 00:36:47,813
Well, you know, we'll give a spoiler warning if you don't want to see the spoiler right now.

452
00:36:47,813 --> 00:36:48,673
I just...

453
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:53,436
I just want to think about this gif as an abstract art.

454
00:36:53,436 --> 00:36:53,897
I do too.

455
00:36:53,897 --> 00:36:55,918
This is beautiful.

456
00:36:56,607 --> 00:37:03,369
Basically, you have a card called Labyrinth.

457
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:06,290
It does nothing, absolutely.

458
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:10,572
It just fills up the boss's...

459
00:37:10,572 --> 00:37:13,133
What do you call it?

460
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:13,313
Bar.

461
00:37:13,313 --> 00:37:14,553
The boss's bar.

462
00:37:14,553 --> 00:37:15,894
Like, I forgot to...

463
00:37:21,525 --> 00:37:26,108
to make that the additional labyrinths didn't spawn their own labyrinths, so

464
00:37:26,108 --> 00:37:30,230
you place one, it spawns 15, those 15 spawn even more,

465
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,212
and so on and so on, and they fill out the whole map.

466
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:37,135
And I also forgot to make it so

467
00:37:37,135 --> 00:37:41,698
the card after labyrinth spawns ghouls,

468
00:37:41,698 --> 00:37:46,001
the monster ghouls, when they're installed. And I forgot the break there, so

469
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:48,502
labyrinths is kind of...

470
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:56,671
asking the code what should I do when I'm installed, when I'm placed on a map, and it

471
00:37:56,671 --> 00:38:02,616
says well do this and then there is no break so it goes to the next line and it says spawn

472
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:03,096
ghoul.

473
00:38:03,096 --> 00:38:03,676
So yeah, that's it.

474
00:38:03,676 --> 00:38:04,597
That's incredible.

475
00:38:04,597 --> 00:38:10,902
I just keep staring at it because just like loop hero this loop of this gif is just, it's

476
00:38:10,902 --> 00:38:12,323
hitting the target.

477
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:13,463
It's my favorite.

478
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:16,366
Oh my god, thank you. Thank you so much for sharing this with us. I

479
00:38:16,366 --> 00:38:20,109
You know, it's it's games, you know

480
00:38:20,109 --> 00:38:26,514
When you're selling games games seem to look as perfect and polished as possible and showing their rough messiness is sometimes

481
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:30,838
Risky actually actually we posted the tweet. Oh, yeah. Well, there you go

482
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:36,402
Hey buy our game. It once looked it once broke like this

483
00:38:36,402 --> 00:38:41,547
This is this is art. It's like you said this is I agree with you. This is fine art. I'm gonna get

484
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:48,790
Shrink it and send it back, but if you want to if you too want to stare at this forever on Twitter

485
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,091
You should absolutely

486
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:54,532
You should absolutely

487
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,013
Go to their Twitter account and just watch it

488
00:38:57,013 --> 00:39:00,435
Stream over and again if you just give me a second. I'm just gonna resize the window here

489
00:39:00,435 --> 00:39:06,417
That was beautiful. That was one of the best things that's ever happened on the switch channel is getting to put a bug like that

490
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:07,818
at full screen

491
00:39:08,363 --> 00:39:14,087
Oh, uh, to look at chat, there's some WF stride is it that that was a bug from before released?

492
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:15,588
So it's not real you can encounter it

493
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:20,851
I just want to make that clear the bug that we just got to stare at over and over again

494
00:39:20,851 --> 00:39:22,552
Will not happen to you

495
00:39:22,552 --> 00:39:28,616
Probably I'm gonna put a disclaimer in there just in case those line breaks showed up again somewhere else

496
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:32,302
Okay, um

497
00:39:32,302 --> 00:39:35,923
Looks like strut. Uh, it looks like NPKNT's question has been answered

498
00:39:35,923 --> 00:39:40,085
You can download loop here on Steam if you want to check it out. It's not on any it's on a gog or anything

499
00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:41,466
It's not any of the stores is it?

500
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:42,666
I think it's also on GOG and the epic store

501
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:58,021
Right, yeah, Loop Hero is also available on the Epic Store and GOG if you want to check it out.

502
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:00,523
I'm going to ask a couple more questions here for my part.

503
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,744
We might need to cut out early here because of something that's popped up at my end.

504
00:40:03,744 --> 00:40:07,306
Um, uh, okay, so I want to ask a question.

505
00:40:07,306 --> 00:40:10,828
This is one of my favorite things in the game.

506
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:13,449
This is when I realized, like, oh, there's something special here.

507
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:14,029
Like, just because...

508
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,095
There's a system where, in the game, you can see it right now,

509
00:40:18,095 --> 00:40:23,523
when mountains and meadows are placed, those boost the player's health.

510
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:32,636
Um, and I think that is so cool and so interesting because it doesn't make a lick of fucking sense to me.

511
00:40:32,636 --> 00:40:39,063
Like, it does not, I, I, there's a, like, the narrative of the game establishes that there's, you know, like, a link between, you know,

512
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:45,470
the objects of the world and, and the hero's conception of the world, and so when Morrowind is back, like, like, there's a, there is a thematic link.

513
00:40:46,241 --> 00:40:50,227
But broadly the idea of, oh, I placed a mountain down.

514
00:40:50,227 --> 00:40:51,249
I have more health now.

515
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:53,472
It just, I can't link it in my head,

516
00:40:53,472 --> 00:40:55,355
but the fact that this game made me

517
00:40:55,355 --> 00:40:56,496
totally accept that logic,

518
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:59,281
I think that's what something games are brilliant at,

519
00:40:59,281 --> 00:41:02,285
is like helping players take abstract ideas and.

520
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:07,850
internalize them. Where did that idea come from? Like where did that system come from and how did

521
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:12,173
it sort of evolve to, you know, then it scales upward obviously, you know, because when mountains

522
00:41:12,173 --> 00:41:16,096
combine together you get the big mountain that spawns the harpies, you know, where did that end

523
00:41:16,096 --> 00:41:20,880
of the system come from to make those meadow and mountain placement integral to the player's health?

524
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:29,007
In the beginning we don't have, we only have three types of the tiles, you know,

525
00:41:29,007 --> 00:41:31,829
one of them is on the road, then we'll...

526
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:38,893
just like okay let them spawn enemies or maybe get you some resources when you're walking.

527
00:41:38,893 --> 00:41:48,738
Second type is by the road like like letter or time crystals or vampires. We decide okay

528
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:54,462
they can also spawn enemy but maybe they will add some additional effects.

529
00:41:55,672 --> 00:41:59,775
And free type, it's out the road.

530
00:41:59,775 --> 00:42:05,899
So we're just thinking if they will spawn many enemies too,

531
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:09,161
this will be too chaotic for control it.

532
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:09,781
So it's not working.

533
00:42:09,781 --> 00:42:11,662
OK, what they also can do?

534
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:16,425
Maybe they can do some bigger additional effect

535
00:42:16,425 --> 00:42:21,588
with bigger areas, like lightning temple or beacon.

536
00:42:22,717 --> 00:42:31,381
but then we're thinking about hero has attributes and maybe they will affect of them because

537
00:42:31,381 --> 00:42:39,345
you know in our game you don't have too many attributes and

538
00:42:39,345 --> 00:42:47,289
variation of interaction with how hero can get him stronger or something like that so

539
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:51,111
yes that's where it's come from so it's what's like written in

540
00:42:51,185 --> 00:42:56,546
decision in the beginning of development.

541
00:42:56,546 --> 00:42:57,566
Gotcha.

542
00:42:57,566 --> 00:43:01,587
And as for how they conflict the narrative, it's actually vice versa.

543
00:43:01,587 --> 00:43:08,729
Its narrative doesn't explain the mountains because at first the game was completely mechanical,

544
00:43:08,729 --> 00:43:14,551
it didn't have any narrative at all, and the narrative is here to explain the mechanics

545
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:14,891
and...

546
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:24,318
So the mountain gives you health because we had to come up with something that mountains do and we thought okay

547
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:31,002
you can pick a mountain and make like a build that is reliant on your health.

548
00:43:31,002 --> 00:43:35,885
So yeah that's what mountains are for.

549
00:43:35,885 --> 00:43:45,550
But then for the lore, so you already have this maximum HP but you know when your hero

550
00:43:46,136 --> 00:43:50,098
creating something that beautiful as that mountain.

551
00:43:50,098 --> 00:43:53,560
He was so happy and uncovered his power.

552
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,321
Or something.

553
00:43:54,321 --> 00:43:58,904
Yeah, it's basically mountains inspire your hero to be healthy.

554
00:43:58,904 --> 00:43:59,164
Yeah.

555
00:43:59,164 --> 00:44:01,785
Yeah, they're really beautiful.

556
00:44:01,785 --> 00:44:05,648
Maybe it's like an alpine air that gives you more health.

557
00:44:06,328 --> 00:44:12,432
Yeah, and he was a life longer for just looking at them as long as possible.

558
00:44:12,432 --> 00:44:15,914
Look, I'll just say that I relate. I live in Los Angeles, California.

559
00:44:15,914 --> 00:44:21,118
I'm surrounded by mountains and on a clear day when I can go see those mountains, I do feel better.

560
00:44:21,118 --> 00:44:23,539
It's, I think, I think you're onto something here.

561
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:25,461
It's work. It's work.

562
00:44:25,461 --> 00:44:25,661
Yeah.

563
00:44:25,661 --> 00:44:26,521
It's realistic.

564
00:44:26,982 --> 00:44:33,603
I mean, I thought I was pointing to... Anyway, yeah, you know what? Okay, so there's a question in chat I want to get to before we sign off.

565
00:44:33,603 --> 00:44:38,584
I'll get to that question from Steaks. If you also want to throw in a question in chat, you can totally do that.

566
00:44:38,584 --> 00:44:46,866
There's one more question from my end that I wanted to ask. It's lore-related. I didn't want to spend too much time on lore and story today,

567
00:44:46,866 --> 00:44:50,247
because I sort of think people should just play this game and check it out for themselves.

568
00:44:50,887 --> 00:44:55,289
This is what, this is another thing that made me go, oh my god, this game is something special.

569
00:44:55,289 --> 00:45:04,493
This game is a fantasy game, there are some conventional fantasy elements, you know, fantasy enemies, slimes, skeletons, monsters, vampires, name it, pick it.

570
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:12,077
And there's a lot of dialogue that goes into like, you know, all of these things are lost or in the void and you're bringing back the world by summoning them.

571
00:45:12,597 --> 00:45:18,902
The first dialogue that you encounter with the vampires, which we're not seeing here because I've already by this point seen the vampire so many times,

572
00:45:18,902 --> 00:45:23,825
the hero and the vampire have an interaction where the hero says, oh, vampires were landowners.

573
00:45:23,825 --> 00:45:30,870
They, you know, they were nobles who saw to the land. They weren't, you know, they weren't just monsters. They...

574
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,551
And I thought, oh my god, that's so cool that like...

575
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:35,645
They're monsters, but they have a role in the world.

576
00:45:35,645 --> 00:45:37,826
And the Harpies also have some dialogue like that.

577
00:45:37,826 --> 00:45:40,208
Like, you know, there was a society and vampires,

578
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:41,949
and this little bit of something, like,

579
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:44,351
made me care more about the vampires

580
00:45:44,351 --> 00:45:47,293
than if they had just shown up in, you know,

581
00:45:47,293 --> 00:45:48,914
if, like, you could have totally presented to me,

582
00:45:48,914 --> 00:45:50,695
I would have been hooked by the mechanics and the loop.

583
00:45:50,695 --> 00:45:52,576
But that one little line, like,

584
00:45:52,576 --> 00:45:54,558
it just made me conceptualize something different

585
00:45:54,558 --> 00:45:56,159
about these vampires, even though it,

586
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:58,901
it sort of barely matters the rest of the game.

587
00:45:59,995 --> 00:46:03,436
Blinch, I think that was more your role, you did more of the writing.

588
00:46:03,436 --> 00:46:06,197
What was your thoughts behind that?

589
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:07,537
Where did that come from?

590
00:46:07,537 --> 00:46:11,398
When did you sort of go, hey, we want players to care a little bit more about these monsters

591
00:46:11,398 --> 00:46:14,319
than just making them things to kill?

592
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:19,741
Yeah, for first, main writer was DeSivir, and that brilliant dialogue is his work.

593
00:46:19,741 --> 00:46:26,022
I, with Spindle, I'll make a little writing for Encyclopedia.

594
00:46:26,022 --> 00:46:28,803
You can find some.

595
00:46:30,451 --> 00:46:37,095
few more stories about vampires by my writing too.

596
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:47,282
So originally, in Loop Hero, your goal not to kill all monsters or revenge to some villain

597
00:46:47,282 --> 00:46:47,722
or something.

598
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:52,585
You basically try to rebuild this world, try to remember it.

599
00:46:52,585 --> 00:46:58,889
So it would be pretty strange if your hero

600
00:46:59,813 --> 00:47:02,335
you know, try to...

601
00:47:02,335 --> 00:47:05,637
His goal was kill all monsters

602
00:47:05,637 --> 00:47:13,141
because you put this monster on his way by your own

603
00:47:13,141 --> 00:47:17,464
so it's a little bit dissonance about it.

604
00:47:17,464 --> 00:47:20,326
So his focus on the story was on rebuilding

605
00:47:20,326 --> 00:47:23,347
and we tried to make some, you know, make more sense

606
00:47:23,347 --> 00:47:28,070
why a hero must kill all these creatures.

607
00:47:28,642 --> 00:47:37,105
just not because they evil maybe not all of them evil but just because they have no other choice and

608
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:51,050
they have some um um how to say right um some their own uh goals for its conflict with what

609
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:52,990
hero try to reach yeah

610
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:59,840
Um, we're gonna get one more we're gonna get this last question here before we go if if our audience here has any more questions

611
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,602
for the the four quarters team

612
00:48:01,602 --> 00:48:02,983
Um, where should they ask them?

613
00:48:02,983 --> 00:48:05,205
Where should they send you all like if and and you know

614
00:48:05,205 --> 00:48:09,208
Where should they ask if they want to learn more about making the making of loop hero?

615
00:48:20,129 --> 00:48:23,711
You could also just say, nowhere, don't have questions.

616
00:48:23,711 --> 00:48:24,852
Live in ignorance.

617
00:48:24,852 --> 00:48:27,654
We made you this game, stop talking to us.

618
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,855
Let us take a rest and let us fix the game

619
00:48:29,855 --> 00:48:30,576
and make it better.

620
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:32,197
You can also, that's a totally valid answer.

621
00:48:32,197 --> 00:48:32,657
You picked the option.

622
00:48:32,657 --> 00:48:33,277
It's an option, we're gonna let it go.

623
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,839
You know what, you have questions,

624
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,920
you can only ask them here.

625
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,422
You can only ask them to me.

626
00:48:40,422 --> 00:48:44,304
These guys are doing us a wonderful service

627
00:48:44,304 --> 00:48:45,705
by making Loop Hero.

628
00:48:45,705 --> 00:48:47,286
Don't go bug them with your questions.

629
00:48:47,286 --> 00:48:48,227
Let them make the game.

630
00:48:48,227 --> 00:48:49,428
But that's.

631
00:48:49,728 --> 00:48:55,292
That said, Steex, I love you for asking the question you have brought, because it's a great question and it's the one I want to ask on.

632
00:48:55,292 --> 00:49:01,197
But for my part, I will just say, if you want to learn more about Loop Hero, they do have a Twitter account.

633
00:49:01,197 --> 00:49:05,100
FourQuarters does have a Twitter account. You can go look that up. I would suggest doing it.

634
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:12,206
And Devolver Digital is obviously the publisher, and you can check out their feed if you want more info on where you can buy it.

635
00:49:12,206 --> 00:49:17,351
Is it going to be on sale? I don't know. It's on Steam. There's going to be a Steam sale for it. Those will pop up.

636
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:21,853
So, we're gonna end on Stix's question.

637
00:49:21,853 --> 00:49:30,356
Did you two, did the Loop Hero team, ever do any experimenting with a more pure, roguelike version of Loop Hero?

638
00:49:30,356 --> 00:49:36,278
One with less persistence and more permadeath, or was it always designed with upgrades and persistence in mind?

639
00:49:36,278 --> 00:49:44,722
At first, there was no upgrades, it was completely permanent.

640
00:49:44,722 --> 00:49:47,523
Then again, we made it on Dudum Dare, which...

641
00:49:48,516 --> 00:49:50,917
in which the team was start with nothing.

642
00:49:50,917 --> 00:49:52,898
And that was it.

643
00:49:52,898 --> 00:49:55,340
You start with nothing and then you go kill some slimes,

644
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:56,520
get some cards, some items,

645
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,181
then you build some more cards.

646
00:49:58,181 --> 00:50:02,003
And the goal was just to get a higher loop and that's it.

647
00:50:02,003 --> 00:50:06,245
And then when, again,

648
00:50:06,245 --> 00:50:10,208
we didn't plan on making it the full game right away.

649
00:50:11,432 --> 00:50:19,543
If the formula didn't work, if it was boring, then okay, we made a game, we spent two weeks, let's go back to something else.

650
00:50:19,543 --> 00:50:27,753
But when we saw that, yeah, okay, people like it, it actually can be interesting, we...

651
00:50:29,122 --> 00:50:32,685
Thought what can we do and the Deceiver said yeah, okay

652
00:50:32,685 --> 00:50:38,610
I have an idea that will turn this like half hour game into a thousand hour game

653
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:44,515
Let's add a camp which you can upgrade and you get resources from the expeditions

654
00:50:44,515 --> 00:50:51,301
So here's your incentive to like live longer and make more loops

655
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:51,501
so

656
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:56,365
Originally it was completely completely

657
00:50:57,674 --> 00:50:59,135
without any progression.

658
00:50:59,135 --> 00:51:04,540
Yeah, but then we don't want to permadeath or something

659
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:11,185
like that, because we try to push a player for experiment

660
00:51:11,185 --> 00:51:16,469
with your card deck, with your building on the camp,

661
00:51:16,469 --> 00:51:20,713
with some various builds for your hero.

662
00:51:20,713 --> 00:51:25,157
And if you try something new in Group Hero,

663
00:51:25,157 --> 00:51:26,578
you're not lost anything.

664
00:51:27,049 --> 00:51:33,940
you just will get new experience, take few resources in any way, even if it will fail.

665
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:41,371
So you not lost nothing. So yeah, we not try to increment that or something.

666
00:51:42,703 --> 00:51:46,204
Uh, gotcha. Well, with that, we're going to wrap things up for today.

667
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:51,125
Uh, um, Blinch, Finlol, thank you so much for joining me. This is...

668
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:54,986
This has been Loop Hero. This game is great for our part. We are the GDC Twitch

669
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:58,047
channel. Um, we're also just GDC. Uh, if you want

670
00:51:58,047 --> 00:52:01,228
to know more about this year's Game Developers Conference, it's going to be

671
00:52:01,228 --> 00:52:03,649
in July. It's going to be all digital. Um, if you

672

675
00:52:17,715 --> 00:52:22,538
We're so excited for it. We're so excited to have developers talk to you about making their games

676

Just like we have today with the loop here developers. So I hope you join us

677
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:31,123
I you know, there's gonna be something for everyone for all for narrative folks artists coders

678
00:52:31,123 --> 00:52:37,266
Producers, it's all there. It's all that's what game developers conferences and that's what we love bringing you

Blinch, Finlol, thank you so much again, and we're gonna wrap and we're just gonna go on home. Bye everyone!

680
00:52:42,651 --> 00:52:42,831
Goodbye.
