1
00:00:05,513 --> 00:00:06,774
All right, so welcome to my talk.

2
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:09,856
This is the development diary of Marvel's Spider-Man.

3
00:00:11,898 --> 00:00:13,740
Specifically, I'm going to be speaking more

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,621
about the cinematic creation in Marvel's Spider-Man,

5
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:17,142
but I worked a little bit on combat

6
00:00:17,163 --> 00:00:18,063
in the beginning of the project.

7
00:00:18,464 --> 00:00:20,265
And we'll just get rolling here.

8
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:22,404
So my name is Brian Weiser.

9
00:00:22,724 --> 00:00:24,425
I'm a lead animator at Insomniac Games.

10
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:27,706
I've been in this animation racket since the last century.

11
00:00:27,726 --> 00:00:28,746
I've been doing this for quite a while.

12
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:29,766
I've worked in VFX.

13
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,507
I've worked in games mostly.

14
00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:33,028
Spent some time in tech

15
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:34,608
and even had a period where I had my own company.

16
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:36,849
About five or six years ago,

17
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:40,090
I came to Insomniac to work on Sunset Overdrive.

18
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,031
And then shortly after we completed Sunset Overdrive,

19
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:44,271
Sony came to us and said,

20
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:47,072
we'd like to work with you guys on a Marvel property.

21
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:47,613
What do you think?

22
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:49,393
So we were obviously excited.

23
00:00:50,354 --> 00:00:53,756
And we, let me hit one thing here, sorry about this.

24
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:54,716
There we go.

25
00:00:55,576 --> 00:00:56,657
Gonna time myself better here.

26
00:00:57,738 --> 00:00:59,719
And we got the opportunity to choose

27
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:00,799
which character we were gonna use.

28
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,220
So me, being the animator or the artist,

29
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,881
I really wanted to do some obscure character,

30
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:05,942
but boy was I wrong.

31
00:01:06,342 --> 00:01:08,123
We chose this guy, Spider-Man.

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,661
So I hope to provide a little bit of insight

33
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:13,923
into our cinematic process and Insomniac Games.

34
00:01:14,343 --> 00:01:16,584
I mean, maybe for some of you this will be a review,

35
00:01:16,684 --> 00:01:18,525
for some of you this is maybe what you do every day,

36
00:01:18,906 --> 00:01:20,707
but hopefully I'll either give you some tips

37
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:22,828
on how you can improve what your storytelling

38
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:24,269
or your projects turn out to be,

39
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:26,410
or I can validate some of the things

40
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,731
that you're faced with every day

41
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:29,632
and you can realize that many of us

42
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,653
face these same problems.

43
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:35,604
The other thing I want to say is there are definitely spoilers in this talk.

44
00:01:35,684 --> 00:01:36,404
I apologize.

45
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:38,846
There's a few moments that I wanted to highlight.

46
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:43,130
And really though, our game has been out since September, and if you haven't played it, maybe

47
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,591
you can't afford it, go borrow it from a friend.

48
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:49,515
What I will say is, swinging through the city is pretty damn fun, and I had nothing to do

49
00:01:49,535 --> 00:01:49,835
with that.

50
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:52,717
That was an entirely different team, but get it.

51
00:01:52,817 --> 00:01:53,077
Try it.

52
00:01:53,097 --> 00:01:53,498
It's awesome.

53
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:54,639
All right.

54
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:55,099
Here we go.

55
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:55,699
Spoilers.

56
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,500
Walk out if you need to.

57
00:01:58,437 --> 00:01:59,939
All right, so early on in Spider-Man, like I said,

58
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,860
I was working on combat.

59
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,002
Our animation director, Bobby Coddington,

60
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,325
he was serving as the main animator.

61
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:06,786
And then a few of us rolled onto the project

62
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:07,407
in pre-production.

63
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:10,250
We spent a lot of time focusing on comic book imagery

64
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,492
as the source material for our posing.

65
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,814
And I'll step through a few of them here.

66
00:02:14,174 --> 00:02:15,836
And at one point in time, my talk

67
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:18,819
had the exact comic slides that would match up

68
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:19,500
with these images.

69
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,521
but I couldn't clear those through legal,

70
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:22,602
so we can't get those.

71
00:02:22,622 --> 00:02:23,122
You can't see them.

72
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:23,663
You can just guess.

73
00:02:23,863 --> 00:02:25,103
Some of these are pretty clear.

74
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:26,524
Some of these are similar to covers.

75
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:28,566
We also jumped into tests.

76
00:02:28,706 --> 00:02:30,747
This is the thing I did on the first day of the project.

77
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:31,848
I was just playing around

78
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:34,129
with our Sunset Overdrive-based Spider-Man.

79
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:35,250
We really didn't have a character yet.

80
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,811
And I was trying to figure out ways for.

81
00:02:39,077 --> 00:02:41,218
us to present an alternate form of combat,

82
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,659
something that isn't just punching and kicking.

83
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,861
And along the way in combat, there was another test

84
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:47,722
we threw in, which I think made it into the game,

85
00:02:47,742 --> 00:02:48,803
the slide under dodge.

86
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:50,904
This was actually something that was introduced

87
00:02:50,924 --> 00:02:53,185
by myself and an engineer during a little bit of downtime

88
00:02:53,205 --> 00:02:54,026
right after a milestone.

89
00:02:54,686 --> 00:02:56,867
The counter and kick after that, I think, got cut,

90
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:58,828
but at any rate, we got some of it to stay.

91
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:01,611
In addition, as you guys can see, there's a theme here.

92
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:04,215
I was really into getting Spider-Man to climb all over his villains.

93
00:03:04,255 --> 00:03:05,456
I didn't want him to just punch and kick.

94
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:10,262
I wanted him to just disable them in other ways that only this villain can to differentiate

95
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:12,425
our project and lean into those differentiators.

96
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:14,968
Again, none of these tests are actually final.

97
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:16,290
This is just something I was throwing together.

98
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:19,369
So to give you a little bit of background,

99
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:23,070
at Insomniac we have a system that is based on Maya.

100
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,530
We export our scenes from Maya,

101
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,971
and they get funneled into our cinematic editor.

102
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:29,331
So this is a view of our timeline in the cinematic editor,

103
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:31,692
and to anyone in here that has edited before,

104
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,292
it's really incredible for us that we have a tool set

105
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:35,832
that looks like a nonlinear editor.

106
00:03:35,852 --> 00:03:38,253
We're able to slide around shots, add tracks,

107
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:39,653
add effects, add lighting,

108
00:03:39,713 --> 00:03:41,173
and all the other aspects of our scenes

109
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,694
can be easily entered into this editor.

110
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:45,814
This is also accompanied by a viewer,

111
00:03:45,914 --> 00:03:46,854
but I didn't want to show you that.

112
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:47,495
It just doesn't.

113
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,495
run as well, and at any rate, it's not there.

114
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:53,496
The other, I think, advantage that we've added

115
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:55,137
to our pipeline is our camera.

116
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:57,397
We've spent a lot of time working on ways

117
00:03:57,457 --> 00:03:59,038
to improve the way we shoot.

118
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:03,839
Most of this work has come from trial and error

119
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,660
and Insomniac, but a lot of us have come

120
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,400
from other studios where we've experienced

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,501
creating films or shooting for other cinematics,

122
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:12,501
and there's benefits to what we do.

123
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:14,502
One of the things we're always trying to think about

124
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:15,502
is where is the camera?

125
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:16,463
Who's operating the camera?

126
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:17,143
Who's holding it?

127
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,911
based on the answer to that question,

128
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:23,613
it'll define how the camera functions

129
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:25,635
with a little bit of frequency and a little bit of noise.

130
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:29,578
To aid in the animation work and make our job faster,

131
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,980
we don't hand animate all that all the time.

132
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:33,542
We have a number of different sliders

133
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:35,103
here that you can kind of see in this initial column.

134
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:37,525
And really, all that these are are a way

135
00:04:37,585 --> 00:04:41,268
to dial in the weights of a number of different frequency

136
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,831
or a number of different wavelengths that apply

137
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:46,132
to the translation channels on the camera.

138
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:47,934
So for instance, shake.

139
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:53,341
is something that you'd often use if you were in a helicopter shot where the operator might be

140
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:56,886
sitting there and something that's vibrating and wave is something we use often when we're trying

141
00:04:56,906 --> 00:05:01,311
to do a little bit of handheld. The other advantage that we or the other addition that we've added to

142
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:01,792
our camera

143
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:04,765
to help us be more cinematic in our thinking

144
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:06,025
and the way we're trying to tell stories

145
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:08,766
is we've actually mirrored real-world lenses

146
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:10,846
from an Alexa Prime camera package

147
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,507
that you would find on a film set.

148
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:15,087
This came from one of our incredibly talented animators,

149
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,168
Josh Gridley, who had joined our team

150
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,569
after leading a number of productions at third floor

151
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:21,809
and working on film previs.

152
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:25,390
So, now back to the story.

153
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,990
After about a year or so working on combat,

154
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,232
our narrative team started to shape the scenes

155
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:35,832
and the overall trajectory of our story

156
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:37,613
in a way that we could start working on it.

157
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:40,094
So I moved from combat over to cinematics,

158
00:05:40,534 --> 00:05:42,014
and we started to realize we were looking at

159
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:43,735
about 90 minutes of story cinematics,

160
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,736
and that's just our story cinematic team

161
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:46,656
that I was the lead of.

162
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:48,937
There was a number of other animators involved

163
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:51,717
in two other animation pods that worked on

164
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:54,618
in-game set pieces and massive moments

165
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:56,499
and other mission-related cinematics.

166
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:58,840
So on my pod we had 12 animators.

167
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,341
That does include myself and the animation director

168
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,002
who were very involved in the scene creation.

169
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,724
We had roughly two years at that time to finish our story.

170
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:08,625
And yes, it was freaking daunting.

171
00:06:08,945 --> 00:06:10,466
I mean, so many of us were really concerned

172
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:12,928
with the fact that we were jumping into a character

173
00:06:12,968 --> 00:06:16,249
that was arguably overly saturated in the market.

174
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,590
Maybe people are bored with him.

175
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,031
What were they going to like what we made?

176
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:20,852
So I was pretty freaked out.

177
00:06:22,052 --> 00:06:25,034
So, just to give you a high-level view of our process when it comes to creating cinematics,

178
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:26,055
we start with Previs.

179
00:06:26,535 --> 00:06:31,437
Most of our animators will jump into doing thumbnails or animatics on their own, but

180
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,739
that's not something that we've actually incorporated into our workflow because in my experience

181
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,821
and in the experience of our team, it's much more efficient for us to jump into 3D as fast

182
00:06:38,861 --> 00:06:39,382
as possible.

183
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,868
Once we identify our previews, we get to a level of time lock,

184
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:49,070
then we'll identify what we can animate with hand-keying,

185
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,311
which is a lot of the Spider-Man work

186
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:51,632
or a lot of the villains that are in the scene.

187
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:55,854
Or we'll identify the scenes that we need to take to PCAP.

188
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:59,475
After we get data back from performance capture,

189
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:00,716
we'll lay the scene out again.

190
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:03,720
Part of that is because we don't want to infect

191
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,081
our animators with, or excuse me,

192
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:06,943
our actors with our previews.

193
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:09,126
In most cases, we don't even show them our previews.

194
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,808
We give them good blocking instruction.

195
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:11,989
We tell them where the cameras will be,

196
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:14,412
but we want them to help bring about the performance.

197
00:07:14,452 --> 00:07:18,076
We want them to help us make a better character

198
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:18,797
or a better scene.

199
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:21,243
which requires us to layout again.

200
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:24,646
After we get through a number of weeks of animating

201
00:07:24,706 --> 00:07:27,648
and working on layout and coming to a final edit,

202
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,210
animation is finally ready to release that scene

203
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,091
to the other departments

204
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:32,392
that will help bring these things to final

205
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:33,613
and actually make them so much better

206
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:34,554
than we can create on our own.

207
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,957
So we lock the edit, we release it to visual effects,

208
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:40,599
lighting and audio and score

209
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,220
and anyone else who has to contribute to the scene.

210
00:07:43,648 --> 00:07:45,814
And finally, concurrently now at that point,

211
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,679
we're polishing the scenes, we're fixing bugs,

212
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,685
and we're banging away on many other scenes.

213
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:52,145
So, Previs.

214
00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:54,386
Generally speaking, at Insomniac,

215
00:07:54,526 --> 00:07:56,086
we assign one scene per animator,

216
00:07:56,106 --> 00:07:57,707
and we try and cast these scenes out

217
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:59,487
to animators that have strengths and weaknesses.

218
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:01,068
But we're not limited to that.

219
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:02,068
We don't want to pigeonhole people,

220
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:03,629
so we allow them to try different scenes.

221
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:07,230
We iterate exhaustively on Previs, especially on i20.

222
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,810
We would meet twice a week,

223
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,891
where we would gather together the entire cinematic team

224
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:12,611
and sit for an hour, hour and a half in a room,

225
00:08:13,111 --> 00:08:15,132
and all go over the scenes, provide feedback,

226
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:17,053
a safe place to weigh in on what we're working on.

227
00:08:17,553 --> 00:08:21,902
This also helped us because we didn't have a singular person shooting them or editing them,

228
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,006
so it helped us to remain connected.

229
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:26,071
And the other benefit of jumping right into Preview is...

230
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,701
is we're readily able to add these into the game,

231
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:31,362
like this little joke that our animator threw in there

232
00:08:31,382 --> 00:08:32,963
at the end of the scene where we didn't have all the pages.

233
00:08:34,144 --> 00:08:36,185
Once the previews is built, we can put this in the game,

234
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,347
we can identify hookups, or as many of the people

235
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:40,948
in this room might know who work on cinematics,

236
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:43,189
that's the point where the character leaves gameplay

237
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:45,110
and goes into cinematic, and then leaves cinematic

238
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,371
and goes back to gameplay.

239
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,332
We spend an incredible amount of time

240
00:08:48,372 --> 00:08:49,773
just focusing on those little bits.

241
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,934
It's actually a disproportionate amount of time.

242
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,591
All right, so as I said, the animators on our team

243
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:56,931
are cinematographers as well.

244
00:08:57,431 --> 00:08:59,452
So we spent a lot of time working through previz

245
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:00,732
and when we get back into layout,

246
00:09:01,053 --> 00:09:02,573
thinking about how we can use the environment

247
00:09:02,593 --> 00:09:03,313
to help tell the story.

248
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:05,714
We're thinking about depth planes.

249
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,674
We're thinking about ways to really work

250
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:09,755
in old 2D animation styles.

251
00:09:09,895 --> 00:09:12,116
And as you can see here in the bottom two images,

252
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:15,097
so we had a shot with Peter or Spider-Man

253
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,397
suiting up in the very beginning of the game.

254
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,698
And in the one on the left,

255
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:21,721
Late on in the project we realized it was a pretty flat shot.

256
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,864
There was a lot of information but it was equidistant from the camera.

257
00:09:24,884 --> 00:09:28,188
So we just threw in this bed to give us a little depth of field element in the foreground

258
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:29,450
and that I think plus the shot.

259
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:33,955
One of the other things we do in my opinion is we shoot scenes overall twice.

260
00:09:34,716 --> 00:09:36,958
The first pass is to get comprehension.

261
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:39,900
It's to allow us to build something that makes sense.

262
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,202
We're not crossing the line of action unintentionally.

263
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:44,043
Scene geography makes sense.

264
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:44,924
You know where actors are.

265
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:46,245
And then we take another pass.

266
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:49,327
We jump back in and try and infuse subtext as best we can.

267
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,609
And that could be altering compositions,

268
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:53,970
moving the character to the center of the screen,

269
00:09:53,991 --> 00:09:55,311
or offsetting and having them look

270
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:56,312
into the short side of the screen

271
00:09:56,352 --> 00:09:57,593
to let the audience feel awkward,

272
00:09:58,494 --> 00:10:01,416
or looking for frames within frames or other opportunities.

273
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:04,198
And again, this is a massive art form in and of itself.

274
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:06,600
I won't go too deep into it, but it's something

275
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,320
that so many people on our team are really

276
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,402
working hard to do in addition to being animators.

277
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:15,124
So another thing, we have to shoot a lot of dialogue scenes

278
00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:17,285
when it comes to the story cinematic pod.

279
00:10:17,305 --> 00:10:17,645
And you're.

280
00:10:22,844 --> 00:10:26,490
It's some people's tendency to want to shoot the words that are coming out of a person's mouth.

281
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,154
And I want to raise the importance here of reaction shots.

282
00:10:29,674 --> 00:10:34,721
Reactions of characters within a scene help the audience understand how they should feel about the scene.

283
00:10:35,182 --> 00:10:37,926
They help us understand the emotional journey that a character is going through.

284
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:41,763
I say no dragnet because that's an example

285
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:43,303
that I found in a Walter Murch book

286
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:45,684
where he describes that old show,

287
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:47,244
I don't know if anyone in this room knows that old show,

288
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:49,305
but the way that they would shoot it

289
00:10:49,345 --> 00:10:51,065
is they would point the camera at the speaker

290
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:52,806
and it ultimately felt like a tennis match.

291
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:54,687
You'd see one person speak and they'd cut

292
00:10:54,707 --> 00:10:55,907
and put another person and they'd cut

293
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:57,367
and they'd put another person and they'd cut.

294
00:10:58,428 --> 00:11:00,468
And you didn't really understand the emotion of the scene

295
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:03,529
and I suppose it will work for a factual based story

296
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,270
but not necessarily something we were working on.

297
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,952
So this scene, again big spoiler, you know what I'll pause this if anyone does not want to watch

298
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:16,536
it and go back. But anyway go back to that again, sorry about that. This scene was actually the

299
00:11:16,596 --> 00:11:22,440
topic of conversation. We got feedback. You knew? That I was told to put the camera on Aunt May when

300
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:28,964
she's talking to Peter. I never wanted you to worry. I did and I am so proud of you.

301
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:35,348
And Ben would be too. All the people you've saved.

302
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,780
And that's just one small example where,

303
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,842
I mean, it's small, but I think it's important

304
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:44,684
in that scene where we understand Peter's journey,

305
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,006
we feel with him.

306
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:47,727
And if the camera was on Aunt May,

307
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:49,449
it wouldn't have had the same impact on the audience.

308
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:51,569
So reaction shots are important.

309
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:53,991
So the other thing that our animators work on is editing.

310
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:56,053
We're animators, cinematographers,

311
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:57,535
and we're also editing scenes.

312
00:11:57,995 --> 00:11:59,417
And just to quickly gloss over some of the things

313
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:01,959
that we think about, we certainly want the edit

314
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:05,002
to mirror the emotion of a shot, of a sequence.

315
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:07,725
So in these initial shots, this is a conversation

316
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:11,048
between Peter and MJ, and it's a very low-tempo,

317
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,070
calm scenario, and...

318
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,851
we give you long shots.

319
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:18,252
We're not cutting around this very frequently.

320
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:19,513
We're not affecting the audience

321
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,513
with how fast we're going from shot to shot.

322
00:12:22,394 --> 00:12:25,095
We're trying to allow the rhythm of the shots themselves

323
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:26,075
to support the action.

324
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:30,117
In contrast, what I'm about to show is a fight scene

325
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,017
where as you can see,

326
00:12:31,077 --> 00:12:32,878
these shot lengths are distinctly shorter.

327
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:34,938
We're bouncing around very quickly.

328
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,019
We're trying to get you to feel the chaos of the action.

329
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,560
And in addition, we keep the camera moving

330
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,281
and really just kind of keep the pace rolling.

331
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:47,141
And lastly, to talk about editing, there's the power of discontinuity.

332
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:52,929
So, sometimes within an action moment, you want to show an action twice, so it heightens the importance.

333
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:58,917
This is seen often in John Woo films and Jackie Chan films, where in one shot they will show...

334
00:12:59,973 --> 00:13:01,754
an impact of a fist hitting the face.

335
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:04,837
And then on a cut, the next shot will show

336
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:06,839
three or four frames prior to that impact,

337
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:07,659
so you're seeing it twice.

338
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,000
Now the audience doesn't catch that,

339
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:11,202
but it adds importance to that shot.

340
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:12,704
It adds importance to that action,

341
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:15,466
and it helps to sell what's happening in the scene.

342
00:13:17,768 --> 00:13:19,769
So in addition to editing, when it comes to timing.

343
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:20,310
We were close.

344
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,071
Go ahead.

345
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:21,731
I'll let this play.

346
00:13:23,132 --> 00:13:23,813
I'll keep trying.

347
00:13:25,274 --> 00:13:26,315
I will find a cure.

348
00:13:26,335 --> 00:13:27,916
I will.

349
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:32,434
I love you, son.

350
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:35,615
So one of the first things we do when we assign previs

351
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:36,855
is we record temp dialogue.

352
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,876
We get our animators in a room, and we record the script

353
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:39,596
as best we can.

354
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:41,476
Some of our animators are better actors than others.

355
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:43,157
I am not one of the good actors.

356
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:46,577
This animator, Alex Zimke, is actually fantastic.

357
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,598
He's a great animator, and he's a great read.

358
00:13:48,638 --> 00:13:50,558
He's in so many of our previs moments.

359
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:53,759
But the point that we want to get at is previs for us

360
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:55,879
is so much about selling the writer's ideas

361
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,840
and selling our ideas to the broader team,

362
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,040
and we can get buy-in to build these moments.

363
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:05,883
To quote Walter Murch, an editor who worked on so many incredible films from Apocalypse Now to a number of other things,

364
00:14:06,264 --> 00:14:09,065
sound is a huge influence on people's attention.

365
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:13,168
And with that in mind, we really try to make sure that our previews contains scores,

366
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:17,870
sound effects, VFX, and really anything we can do to help sell our ideas better.

367
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,232
So...

368
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:24,888
In a mocap-based game, as anyone in this room can attest to,

369
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:26,711
mocap is definitely not everything.

370
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:27,672
I never stop.

371
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:29,315
Even when you have a scene where it's just two people

372
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:30,397
sitting at a table talking,

373
00:14:30,977 --> 00:14:32,640
well, there might be a moment where they gotta kiss.

374
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:35,204
And it's kind of impossible with the HMCs.

375
00:14:40,617 --> 00:14:44,099
So Laura Bailey and Yuri Lowenthal, fantastic actors in their own right.

376
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:48,201
But this is a perfect example of where, you know, mocap is not just going to slide in the game.

377
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:52,343
It just doesn't work. Animators are needed. Don't worry, anyone who animates here, your job is safe.

378
00:14:54,584 --> 00:15:00,106
So something else that we do a lot on Spider-Man that I think is a huge advantage to the way we're telling our stories,

379
00:15:00,126 --> 00:15:04,508
let's see, here we go, is we tend to shoot some of our action sequences...

380
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:08,010
with two actors on the stage at the same time,

381
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:09,953
but delivering a singular performance.

382
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:11,836
While this takes a little bit more time

383
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:13,459
in our prep and our walkthroughs.

384
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,063
All right, we'll pause that.

385
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:21,782
What it gives us is a unified performance with voice actor and stunt actor,

386
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:24,443
and we allow the experts to bring to the table what they're good at.

387
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:29,084
You know, Yuri's fantastic, but I'm not going to ask him to do a backflip on the stage.

388
00:15:29,404 --> 00:15:31,525
We need him. He's too important. He's going to get hurt.

389
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:35,146
But what this allowed us to do, and many of the people in this room probably understand

390
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,306
when it comes to animation and cinematics,

391
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:41,907
you'll often have 80-yard lines or lines that are added after the fact or the script was changed.

392
00:15:42,287 --> 00:15:45,728
And as animators, we need to go in there and add head accents and connect those to the body.

393
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:52,471
This is a very quick way for us to capture and get the complete performance all in one.

394
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:56,853
It also helps us to avoid stitching, which is something that you have to do a lot with mocap,

395
00:15:56,893 --> 00:16:00,694
where we would have, if I was to take this sequence from our Black Cat DLC,

396
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:05,556
you might have a moment where we're working with the performance actor, and the stunt actor comes

397
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:09,418
in, and the performance actor comes in, and then we as animators would have to blend those together.

398
00:16:09,438 --> 00:16:13,019
That's just a big pain in the ass. It's so much easier to have all this together.

399
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:20,810
So another thing that our Previs allows us to do is innovate and solve problems early.

400
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,993
So this was a shot that early in our very first cinematic we were putting into our vertical

401
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:29,155
slices, this is actually the first Previs I put together, on the page it said

402
00:16:30,016 --> 00:16:33,257
A lot of crazy action happens, truck gets, takes off,

403
00:16:33,317 --> 00:16:34,457
and Peter's gonna chase the truck.

404
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:35,937
And we leave Peter on the rooftop,

405
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:36,978
sitting in a perch position.

406
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,099
So as an animator, I just kind of didn't think

407
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:40,859
that was right.

408
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:42,719
Come on, Spider-Man's never gonna wait.

409
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:43,960
He's gonna chase after this action.

410
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,881
So with this, I pushed for our ability

411
00:16:47,961 --> 00:16:51,281
to blend from cinematics to gameplay on the move.

412
00:16:52,022 --> 00:16:53,642
Early on, a lot of people balked at this

413
00:16:53,662 --> 00:16:54,702
and thought this was a big concern

414
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,063
and maybe we shouldn't try that for our...

415
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:58,004
initial vertical slice.

416
00:16:58,804 --> 00:17:00,706
Long story short, we now have a system that allows us

417
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:02,907
to blend into many states throughout the game,

418
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:04,488
most specifically,

419
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,570
falling and in the air, which is actually

420
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,611
quite easy for us, there's no contacts, and we do this

421
00:17:08,671 --> 00:17:09,252
all the time now.

422
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:11,714
Alright, so,

423
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:14,556
the project's going well, everything's fine,

424
00:17:14,596 --> 00:17:16,277
and then you open up your shocker scene,

425
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:17,378
and this is what you see.

426
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:20,940
Or,

427
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,182
you go back to your MJ scene,

428
00:17:23,202 --> 00:17:24,523
where she's in Grand Central Station,

429
00:17:24,683 --> 00:17:25,443
and this is what you see.

430
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,461
And we all know gameplay's messy, so when Otto and Norman talk, this might also be something

431
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:32,782
you see.

432
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:36,063
Now, I'm just pointing this out because, as we all know, there's a lot of problems when

433
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,163
it comes to creating games.

434
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:38,364
There's so many of us involved.

435
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:39,584
Things change every day.

436
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:41,145
No scene stays the same.

437
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:46,067
Trust me, the scene looked better when we shipped it.

438
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:48,868
But to solve this...

439
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:51,616
One of the things, and I'm going to talk about a meeting.

440
00:17:51,656 --> 00:17:52,357
I'm sorry, everybody.

441
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,499
We actually introduced a meeting midway through production

442
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:55,900
where we realized that most of these problems

443
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,001
come from communication gaps.

444
00:17:57,461 --> 00:17:59,223
So we have an assets meeting now.

445
00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:00,464
That's every week.

446
00:18:01,244 --> 00:18:02,806
And what happens in that meeting is

447
00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:05,107
I sit in the front of the room and I go through our previs.

448
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,629
I go through anything that's in production.

449
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:08,390
And we talk about it with all the leads

450
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,512
of other departments to identify holes

451
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:13,054
or identify areas where either they don't have the bandwidth

452
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:15,116
for this coming down the pipe, so we need to change course,

453
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:15,656
or.

454
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:20,318
they can introduce their ideas early on and we can get buy-in and finish our scenes together.

455
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:22,179
So yes, meetings are important.

456
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:26,900
One of the other things we have in Spider-Man is many costumes for Peter

457
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:28,441
when he's as Spider-Man.

458
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:34,903
In general, the narrative team and writing helped us to avoid many of the problems with him where

459
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:38,965
we had to remove his mask and it wouldn't have been very easy for us to do that with all of

460
00:18:39,045 --> 00:18:44,727
the possibilities that he has for his costume. But it wasn't limited to our hero. So we had

461
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:45,227
this moment.

462
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:49,971
in the game where a spider was to stow away on MJ.

463
00:18:51,252 --> 00:18:53,234
And this spanned a couple of different missions

464
00:18:54,054 --> 00:18:55,916
and it was through a number of different cinematics.

465
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:56,977
High alert.

466
00:18:57,817 --> 00:19:00,119
And once that spider got to the feast center,

467
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,120
it was supposed to leave MJ,

468
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,041
as you can see in this incredibly animated scene

469
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:04,482
by one of our animators, Liam Murphy.

470
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:06,964
And then it's gonna go on and bite somebody else.

471
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:08,465
I won't spoil that.

472
00:19:09,735 --> 00:19:10,795
even though I spoiled other things here.

473
00:19:11,696 --> 00:19:14,177
However, this is what we saw, again,

474
00:19:14,257 --> 00:19:15,578
when we went back to the scene later on,

475
00:19:15,658 --> 00:19:17,038
because the designer, rightfully so,

476
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:19,640
had put in the proper suit, and the spider's gone.

477
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,202
So the solution to this was simply brute force.

478
00:19:23,382 --> 00:19:25,303
Unfortunately, we had to assess the problems.

479
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:27,704
We had to go to each of those scenes

480
00:19:27,744 --> 00:19:29,004
and any other mission or anything

481
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:30,385
that's related to those moments

482
00:19:30,425 --> 00:19:32,766
and identify where the least work would be needed,

483
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:34,447
and then we'd fix that.

484
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:37,589
Moving forward, our lead animator, Gavin Goulden,

485
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:41,193
essentially mapped out all of the clothing

486
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,075
that any of the actors can wear in our game,

487
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:45,877
and we had a kind of a timeline of their life.

488
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:46,878
So this is something that,

489
00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:49,060
while it becomes forgotten pretty quickly,

490
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,102
you need to remember that continuity is important.

491
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:54,404
All right, so another problem

492
00:19:54,424 --> 00:19:55,545
when it comes to creating cinematics

493
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:58,127
is it's rare that you're aligned with the rest of the game.

494
00:19:58,567 --> 00:19:59,648
So in this particular moment,

495
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:02,811
we built a scene that was solely based on the concept below.

496
00:20:02,891 --> 00:20:04,692
We shot it, we had this great idea

497
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:06,534
that Spider-Man was gonna be tethered to the ground,

498
00:20:06,554 --> 00:20:07,895
and it was going to be really exciting.

499
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,581
And then midway through production,

500
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:12,783
we realized that gameplay might not even be building that.

501
00:20:12,843 --> 00:20:14,144
We may not even have a tether.

502
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:15,305
It's not a thing that'll work.

503
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:17,247
Unfortunately, we had to pivot,

504
00:20:17,427 --> 00:20:20,830
and we took what was a part of our Sable agent's bola

505
00:20:20,931 --> 00:20:22,792
that worked, but I guess the point I'm trying to make here

506
00:20:22,812 --> 00:20:26,315
is cinematics themselves are often challenging

507
00:20:26,436 --> 00:20:28,137
to keep in alignment with mission development,

508
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:29,578
and you just need to remain aware

509
00:20:29,698 --> 00:20:30,920
and communicate with your teams.

510
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:37,053
Scene rot is a term that we've coined for when you leave a scene alone and something's

511
00:20:37,073 --> 00:20:37,573
going to happen.

512
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:38,994
And this is no one's fault.

513
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:41,596
It's just, there are so many of us making these games.

514
00:20:42,597 --> 00:20:46,861
So many things that are going into them that something is bound to change inadvertently

515
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:49,343
and it will affect the scenes as we go back and edit them.

516
00:20:49,403 --> 00:20:51,684
So you might have a moment where Spider-Man was supposed to be on a building.

517
00:20:51,704 --> 00:20:53,266
You can see the little speck there in the middle.

518
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:54,387
Well, there's no building anymore.

519
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:58,430
Or you might have a moment where one of the Sable agents is also supposed to be on a building.

520
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,811
There's no building there.

521
00:21:01,015 --> 00:21:03,596
Or our villain, after a huge climactic moment,

522
00:21:03,616 --> 00:21:05,357
was supposed to look unconscious in a helicopter,

523
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:07,658
but there's a chair going through his chest.

524
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:11,179
And finally, I think one of the most egregious

525
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,240
of these ones that I'm highlighting,

526
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,821
you saw this a little earlier,

527
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:16,242
where Spider-Man swung through an open space in a billboard.

528
00:21:16,262 --> 00:21:17,382
Well, one day we opened the scene

529
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:18,303
and this is what it looked like.

530
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:20,264
To our team's credit, though,

531
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:21,724
the moment these are identified,

532
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:23,945
everyone jumps to and we fix these very quickly

533
00:21:23,985 --> 00:21:26,327
in all departments, it's great support in Insomniac.

534
00:21:28,076 --> 00:21:29,957
So we've had a bunch of problems.

535
00:21:30,017 --> 00:21:31,819
We've developed a workflow.

536
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:32,799
We're working pretty well.

537
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:35,721
We're starting to rise above and fix those problems.

538
00:21:36,202 --> 00:21:37,683
And we get to the point where we need to start

539
00:21:37,723 --> 00:21:39,244
releasing these scenes to other departments

540
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:40,845
and finish them and finish the game.

541
00:21:41,545 --> 00:21:43,507
And it's at this time in our production

542
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,808
that our animators almost become,

543
00:21:46,028 --> 00:21:47,549
well, they're also polishing animation

544
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:48,490
and finishing their work.

545
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,471
They become shepherds for their own scenes

546
00:21:50,571 --> 00:21:51,752
and they're communicating with others

547
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:55,255
to make sure that the remaining details are completed.

548
00:21:57,739 --> 00:22:01,201
This scene in particular epitomizes the collaboration

549
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:03,602
with other departments and other people to create a performance.

550
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:05,883
So we have an entire fight scene that's

551
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:08,424
on a rooftop at the end of our raft mission.

552
00:22:08,964 --> 00:22:11,125
And I would say there's a.

553
00:22:12,562 --> 00:22:17,664
Not a single animation in this moment that doesn't include the work of a stunt performer,

554
00:22:17,964 --> 00:22:21,126
or an actor, or an animator completely changing the performance.

555
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:25,949
In fact, there's a moment in the beginning of this where Spiderman leaps off of Scorpion's tail,

556
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:27,630
lands on Scorpion, then lands on the ground.

557
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,591
And I happened to be working with one of our stunt actors just the other day,

558
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:33,953
who was involved in this, and he joked to me, he said he was playing through,

559
00:22:34,273 --> 00:22:36,414
and he was watching the scene and said, well, there I am.

560
00:22:36,574 --> 00:22:37,395
Oh, no, that's not me.

561
00:22:37,675 --> 00:22:38,495
No, no, that's not.

562
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:39,296
Oh, there I am again.

563
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:44,120
I'm just kind of identifying how much we kind of work together

564
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,221
to create one performance.

565
00:22:45,681 --> 00:22:46,922
Arguably, I think it would be great

566
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:48,784
if we could go back to crediting the way Disney used to,

567
00:22:48,804 --> 00:22:51,266
where they'd have actors and animators and anyone else

568
00:22:51,306 --> 00:22:53,208
involved in a character credited on the same slide.

569
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:55,830
All right.

570
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,253
So one of the other problems that we have in a massively,

571
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:02,575
well, in an open-world game is we will often

572
00:23:02,616 --> 00:23:03,576
have scenes where we want.

573
00:23:04,898 --> 00:23:11,284
a continuous narrative to move through a number of different locations that are nowhere near

574
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:11,985
one another on the map.

575
00:23:12,905 --> 00:23:15,848
This would have been completely unacceptable to have loading screens between each of these

576
00:23:15,888 --> 00:23:16,288
vignettes.

577
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:20,071
So, we kind of started building these frankincense.

578
00:23:20,252 --> 00:23:22,192
We worked closely with the art department

579
00:23:22,352 --> 00:23:24,433
to identify all of the parts we need,

580
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:26,554
kind of pull them together and make a unique set

581
00:23:26,574 --> 00:23:28,414
that we just throw underground for these cinematics.

582
00:23:29,155 --> 00:23:31,095
So while ideally it would be in the open world,

583
00:23:31,155 --> 00:23:32,376
it was just simply not possible.

584
00:23:32,396 --> 00:23:34,576
And through their support, we were able to complete these

585
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:36,977
in a way that didn't really ruin the game.

586
00:23:36,997 --> 00:23:38,538
Can you, can you-

587
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:40,018
Here's another example of a Franken set

588
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:41,259
where we go from the Feast Center

589
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,219
to MJ speaking at a desk,

590
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:45,000
all the way to Norman's apartment.

591
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,421
But in the interest of keeping my talk moving along here,

592
00:23:47,441 --> 00:23:48,541
maybe I'll get to some questions.

593
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:49,901
I'm going to kind of skip through some of this.

594
00:23:50,615 --> 00:23:52,535
transit points. Throughout the city...

595
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:55,156
Alright. So not only is this

596
00:23:55,676 --> 00:23:57,617
frankenset notion one way we hide

597
00:23:57,677 --> 00:23:59,777
loading, but sometimes we can't do that.

598
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:01,498
The thing we want to hide that's getting

599
00:24:01,518 --> 00:24:02,838
loaded is far too massive.

600
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:06,659
And specifically in the beginning of our game,

601
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,740
Spider-Man shows up at Fisk Tower

602
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,401
and is going to help the police go in and

603
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:13,001
take down Fisk. So we wanted to go from

604
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:16,482
open world directly into this entire

605
00:24:16,562 --> 00:24:19,063
instance of our lobby and the entire

606
00:24:19,103 --> 00:24:19,983
building of Fisk Tower.

607
00:24:21,383 --> 00:24:22,024
Did you see the cut?

608
00:24:22,464 --> 00:24:23,004
See where it happened?

609
00:24:23,744 --> 00:24:24,165
Someone there?

610
00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:28,066
Anyway, so our goal is to, again, work directly

611
00:24:28,086 --> 00:24:29,507
with all of the other departments involved

612
00:24:29,587 --> 00:24:30,887
in creating anything for our game,

613
00:24:30,907 --> 00:24:32,428
and we have to collaborate to make this work.

614
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:34,869
This was really a long process.

615
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:36,730
In fact, to the extent that people told me

616
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,891
we shouldn't be doing any of this, this is not a good idea.

617
00:24:39,731 --> 00:24:43,293
But we work closely with design and lighting and effects

618
00:24:43,673 --> 00:24:46,194
to identify the singular frame on which we are going

619
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,775
to teleport Peter from being within.

620
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:52,358
the open world to going to the instanced interior

621
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:54,139
that he's now going to continue on.

622
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:57,222
The bigger challenge we have here

623
00:24:57,322 --> 00:24:59,904
is constraining our cameras and working with environment

624
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:01,184
to provide visual blockers.

625
00:25:01,545 --> 00:25:03,486
But again, this is something we hope to do more of

626
00:25:03,506 --> 00:25:03,967
in the future.

627
00:25:03,987 --> 00:25:06,088
It is our goal that games at Insomniac

628
00:25:06,188 --> 00:25:08,850
ultimately eliminate the loading screen,

629
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,471
and we'll see if that works, I don't know.

630
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:12,072
It's a big challenge.

631
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:15,635
Facial animation is another challenge that we have.

632
00:25:15,735 --> 00:25:17,076
Sorry, I just burst the mic.

633
00:25:18,744 --> 00:25:21,968
So when it comes to facial animation,

634
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:24,231
it is critical that lighting is involved

635
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:25,212
as early as possible.

636
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,173
I can change in six months.

637
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:29,237
So when we look at these scenes.

638
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,339
Why did you ask me here, Pete?

639
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,001
You can see a dramatic difference between final lighting

640
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:35,663
and even a passive lighting that was pretty close to final.

641
00:25:36,103 --> 00:25:38,385
To the extent that as we're reviewing facial animation

642
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:40,606
that comes from Cubic Motion, incredible team,

643
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:41,987
did some incredible work for our project.

644
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:44,228
Can't thank those guys enough.

645
00:25:44,328 --> 00:25:45,669
You can see the distinct difference.

646
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:47,330
I might not have approved something

647
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:52,212
with that near final lighting versus the final lighting.

648
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:53,753
So really what this boiled down to at the end,

649
00:25:53,793 --> 00:25:54,974
again working with another department,

650
00:25:55,294 --> 00:25:56,715
we got into the cycle where we would get

651
00:25:57,115 --> 00:25:58,176
first pass animation here.

652
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,541
Next time you get in my way, I will not be.

653
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:04,402
We'll get first pass animation in,

654
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:05,802
then we'll get first pass lighting in.

655
00:26:05,822 --> 00:26:08,643
And then we'll go back and get more fixed animation.

656
00:26:08,683 --> 00:26:09,723
We'll adjust head and neck,

657
00:26:09,823 --> 00:26:11,963
because in our facts-based facial animation system,

658
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,644
there are blend shapes that'll emerge

659
00:26:13,684 --> 00:26:15,064
if the head is pushed back too far,

660
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:16,845
things we can't see before the facial animation

661
00:26:16,885 --> 00:26:17,265
goes in there.

662
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:18,845
And then lighting, we'll light again,

663
00:26:18,885 --> 00:26:19,685
and so on and so forth,

664
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:21,266
until we kind of arrive at this final

665
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:24,066
that we can approve and feel is successful

666
00:26:24,086 --> 00:26:24,627
and ready to ship.

667
00:26:25,507 --> 00:26:26,487
And I can change the six points.

668
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:26,847
Head and neck.

669
00:26:29,717 --> 00:26:31,358
One of the other challenges that we have in our game

670
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:32,339
is the living world.

671
00:26:33,461 --> 00:26:35,723
We often had scenes that were in the exterior,

672
00:26:36,744 --> 00:26:38,326
through which we had to contend with the fact

673
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:42,870
that we have this incredible system of vehicles and bots

674
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,774
that is a technical and creative achievement.

675
00:26:47,795 --> 00:26:49,017
If anyone notices, that's my head

676
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:50,118
actually getting beaten down there.

677
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:53,235
But at any rate, so within these scenes,

678
00:26:53,616 --> 00:26:55,899
it would be impossible for us to shoot this

679
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:58,743
as an entire cinematic, to contain every character

680
00:26:58,763 --> 00:27:00,505
that we have here within our scenes

681
00:27:00,545 --> 00:27:01,206
and actually work with it.

682
00:27:01,226 --> 00:27:03,249
There's no way Maya would actually even function.

683
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,274
So we would break these down and try and leverage

684
00:27:07,554 --> 00:27:08,155
the in-game.

685
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:11,883
systems as much as we can to tell the whole story.

686
00:27:12,443 --> 00:27:13,764
And there's a shot that comes up here

687
00:27:14,164 --> 00:27:16,585
that can better articulate what I'm trying to say.

688
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:17,486
Let me pause this one.

689
00:27:17,506 --> 00:27:18,947
So this is a perfect example.

690
00:27:19,227 --> 00:27:21,168
So within this shot, our cinematic is constructed

691
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:23,209
primarily of these three actors.

692
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,171
We have Miles Morales, Rio Morales, and JD Morales.

693
00:27:27,171 --> 00:27:27,391
And then...

694
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,810
We have some mid-ground characters

695
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,551
that are coming from a secondary cinematic that

696
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:33,091
is funneled into that same one.

697
00:27:33,531 --> 00:27:35,532
And then we also have other actors

698
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,012
that are coming from the living world.

699
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,093
So it's in combination with all these other departments

700
00:27:39,313 --> 00:27:40,393
that we can create this one scene.

701
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:42,314
Otherwise, there's no way that we could handle it,

702
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,874
and the scenes would no longer be performing.

703
00:27:45,335 --> 00:27:47,295
So one of the other things we had to contest with

704
00:27:47,475 --> 00:27:50,156
is screens within our scenes.

705
00:27:50,396 --> 00:27:52,897
So often on the page, it'll just simply say,

706
00:27:53,457 --> 00:27:55,318
and Peter walks by a screen and sees x.

707
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,538
Those were often their own cinematics.

708
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,999
We had to actually build those out as their own thing.

709
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:04,320
And it was a challenge and often forgotten

710
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
because it was one of the things

711
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,041
that would either fall on effects or lighting

712
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:08,401
or no one really claimed them.

713
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:10,402
We have another one here where Norman

714
00:28:10,442 --> 00:28:12,522
is supposed to be speaking on a TV the entire time.

715
00:28:12,822 --> 00:28:14,223
If ever you see that in a script,

716
00:28:14,503 --> 00:28:16,263
go back to your writer and make sure they realize

717
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:17,864
they need to write that whole speech.

718
00:28:18,524 --> 00:28:20,044
Whether or not you're looking at Norman,

719
00:28:20,084 --> 00:28:21,645
he should be talking the entire time.

720
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,382
And in addition, we have other reveals that are on screens.

721
00:28:25,582 --> 00:28:27,223
Again, these are their own cinematics

722
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,085
that were unaccounted for,

723
00:28:29,105 --> 00:28:30,246
kind of came up in production,

724
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:31,087
and we had to throw it together.

725
00:28:33,569 --> 00:28:36,752
So in conclusion, I hope that you enjoyed this,

726
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:37,172
first of all.

727
00:28:38,213 --> 00:28:39,454
Secondly, I think at Insomniac,

728
00:28:39,574 --> 00:28:41,556
we've leveled up our storytelling techniques

729
00:28:41,616 --> 00:28:46,320
and our abilities to give the audience emotional journeys.

730
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:49,332
I think cinematics have their challenges.

731
00:28:49,472 --> 00:28:50,613
I think I've highlighted a few of them.

732
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:52,734
I'm sure there are, I mean, I don't have enough time

733
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:55,616
to go through all of the problems and issues that we face.

734
00:28:56,597 --> 00:28:58,278
And many of you, I'm sure, can deal with that here too,

735
00:28:58,358 --> 00:28:59,719
or can speak to that as well.

736
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:03,821
And lastly, I hope there's at least a little bit

737
00:29:03,861 --> 00:29:05,422
that you can take from what I've said here

738
00:29:05,563 --> 00:29:07,625
and maybe it validates what you've already done

739
00:29:07,685 --> 00:29:10,427
in your studio or you can use a little nugget

740
00:29:10,447 --> 00:29:12,449
of information to help improve the way you guys

741
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:14,451
tell stories with more confidence in the future.

742
00:29:15,472 --> 00:29:17,054
And that's pretty much all I got.

743
00:29:17,754 --> 00:29:19,056
I'm open to questions at this point,

744
00:29:19,076 --> 00:29:20,937
but thank you all so much for coming to my talk.

745
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:25,362
Thank you.

746
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:29,226
It's great.

747
00:29:29,246 --> 00:29:31,007
My kids are going to think I did a great job.

748
00:29:32,848 --> 00:29:34,509
So I'll take questions as long as I can.

749
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:37,050
And I know there's another room that we

750
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,991
can walk to if there's more questions after this.

751
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:39,971
So feel free.

752
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:42,532
I can take one question.

753
00:29:42,552 --> 00:29:46,874
All right.

754
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:47,595
You, sir.

755
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:48,630
Hi.

756
00:29:49,011 --> 00:29:51,672
So where, I have two questions and they're

757
00:29:51,712 --> 00:29:52,692
somewhat related to each other.

758
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:56,133
Where in the process do you loop in the downstream teams,

759
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:57,854
like lighting and effects and sound,

760
00:29:57,994 --> 00:30:00,395
into what you're making for a cinematic?

761
00:30:00,495 --> 00:30:03,616
And then you mentioned that you like to include VFX and SFX

762
00:30:03,656 --> 00:30:05,617
in the previous process.

763
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:09,079
Your animator is doing temp versions of those assets,

764
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,799
or is that after you've looped in the other teams

765
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,040
and they're providing temp versions?

766
00:30:12,284 --> 00:30:14,645
So the question was, where do we include the other departments?

767
00:30:14,825 --> 00:30:16,745
And are the animators doing the temp versions?

768
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:18,925
So I'll answer those in the inverse order.

769
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:21,326
So in Previs, the animators are putting those in.

770
00:30:21,846 --> 00:30:23,826
But we're not trying to drive the other department's work.

771
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:24,766
We are not the experts.

772
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:27,007
We're just trying to, again, like I said, sell ideas

773
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,707
and get people to buy into these scenes.

774
00:30:29,647 --> 00:30:32,008
When it comes to when we engage other departments,

775
00:30:32,088 --> 00:30:33,908
we try to do so as early as possible.

776
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:34,868
They see scripts.

777
00:30:35,028 --> 00:30:35,948
They see what we're working on.

778
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:39,229
But with the introduction of that asset meeting

779
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:39,789
that I mentioned.

780
00:30:40,189 --> 00:30:42,170
we actually engage them in early previews now.

781
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,251
We show them the things that we're working on.

782
00:30:44,431 --> 00:30:45,631
They're not actually actively working

783
00:30:45,671 --> 00:30:46,652
on the scenes themselves,

784
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,393
but they at least understand the work that's coming to them

785
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,794
and have the opportunity to tell us

786
00:30:51,814 --> 00:30:52,914
whether or not they can support that

787
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:55,795
or introduce new ideas that'll help us

788
00:30:55,935 --> 00:30:57,196
and improve the scenes in general.

789
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,317
We are not the experts in those departments at all.

790
00:31:00,297 --> 00:31:02,638
I mean, myself, I have a history in animation

791
00:31:02,698 --> 00:31:03,438
and so does my team,

792
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:05,619
and we're branching out into other things

793
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:06,600
as we develop these scenes.

794
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:07,660
Thank you.

795
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:12,019
Thank you, everybody.
