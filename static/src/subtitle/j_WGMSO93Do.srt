00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:21,860
Hi everyone, my name is Sammy. I'm here to give you a talk on how our game worked with our small tester community and Twitch streamers and other types of content creators to launch our game on Steam Early Access.

2
00:00:23,662 --> 00:00:29,225
It is very nice to be here.

3
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:30,826
This is my second GDC.

4
00:00:30,826 --> 00:00:34,068
In 2016, I came to San Francisco for my first GDC,

5
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:38,091
and I went to a lot of talks and learned a lot,

6
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:40,573
and I'm a huge fan of GDC Vault.

7
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:43,915
So it is very, you know, a kind of an emotional experience

8
00:00:43,915 --> 00:00:47,737
to be here to talk about how we developed the game

9
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:49,638
and worked with our community

10
00:00:49,638 --> 00:00:52,200
to launch our game successfully on Steam.

11
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,681
and other platforms.

12
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:57,082
So, okay, I'll jump right in.

13
00:00:57,082 --> 00:01:00,643
So I go by the name Poopy Queen on Twitter and Twitch.

14
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:03,643
It's just a silly nickname that I have

15
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:06,664
because my friends used to tease me in college

16
00:01:06,664 --> 00:01:10,305
that I poop on their strategy when I play games with them.

17
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:13,846
And I thought, you know, if I had this memorable nickname,

18
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:15,027
people will remember me.

19
00:01:15,027 --> 00:01:18,768
And I think it's a tip for a lot of indie studio,

20
00:01:18,768 --> 00:01:19,648
like community managers.

21
00:01:19,648 --> 00:01:21,168
If you have a memorable nickname,

22
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:28,553
they will remember you because there were times in like during alpha or beta a lot of you know

23
00:01:28,553 --> 00:01:34,077
streamers were like who's that girl like poopy something that works on player knows battlefield

24
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:40,461
whatever and they remembered my name so it was very like effective so I think that's a tip.

25
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:45,504
I used to do community management but now I'm focusing more on marketing but

26
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:53,090
For all the India teams out there, you can do it on your own in the beginning,

27
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,093
but don't forget to scale the team in the later phase,

28
00:01:57,093 --> 00:02:00,055
because that's what we are going through right now.

29
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:04,339
Kind of, that's the pain point we're going through.

30
00:02:04,339 --> 00:02:04,759
So moving on.

31
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:10,403
So these are the key takeaways for my talk.

32
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,263
There was an article on New York Magazine titled,

33
00:02:15,263 --> 00:02:17,164
How an Unfinished Game with No Marketing

34
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:19,686
Came Out of Nowhere to Dominate the Internet,

35
00:02:19,686 --> 00:02:23,249
which is kind of true and not true in a sense

36
00:02:23,249 --> 00:02:25,210
because it wasn't out of nowhere.

37
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,513
We started with a small tester community in 2016,

38
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:33,156
and we were snowballing our tester community

39
00:02:33,156 --> 00:02:34,537
until early access.

40
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:37,219
It was invisible to a lot of...

41
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:45,606
gaming media and the mainstream content creators, but we had this community that we worked really

42
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:54,134
closely with to really blow up and give more exposure to our game after the early access launch.

43
00:02:54,794 --> 00:03:01,919
So I'm going to be talking about how we went through different phases to slowly grow the community

44
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:08,723
and give a lot of impact when there was this time where we had to create big momentum

45
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:16,369
without a big marketing budget. We had zero marketing budget in 2016. It was very humble.

46
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:20,411
We started as a small team, so I will go into details about that.

47
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:25,857
And yeah, the third point, how to market your indie game with a zero dollar budget.

48
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:29,100
I think this is some, you know, this is a topic that will be of interest for many people.

49
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,662
Okay, so a little bit about our team. We started with...

50
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:42,609
about 25 people, including a business manager and myself.

51
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:44,311
I started as an interpreter.

52
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,993
I had background in marketing and PR,

53
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:50,378
but my main job in the beginning of the project

54
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:52,441
was to translate and interpret for

55
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,303
Brandon Player Unknown Green and the rest of the devs,

56
00:03:56,303 --> 00:04:00,788
so they can communicate and work together.

57
00:04:00,788 --> 00:04:05,113
Part of the core team was the team that developed

58
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:07,956
DevVillain, which is an action MMORPG.

59
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:12,598
And the team had worked together for such a long time.

60
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:15,779
They had great teamwork and over 10 years of experience

61
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:17,940
in building an online game.

62
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,521
So they had the experience in providing an online service,

63
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:25,862
but didn't have experience in developing a shooter game.

64
00:04:25,862 --> 00:04:27,863
So that's how we started.

65
00:04:27,863 --> 00:04:30,324
Now I think we have about 200 people.

66
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:32,825
We are like continuously growing,

67
00:04:32,825 --> 00:04:35,706
so I don't have the number, but yeah.

68
00:04:37,506 --> 00:04:42,130
So, who has not played PUBG?

69
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:42,450
Show of hands.

70
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:42,750
Okay.

71
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,154
Who has played PUBG on mobile?

72
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:50,456
Ooh, yeah, you should definitely give it a try

73
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,297
if you haven't.

74
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:53,979
It's Valor Reality in a Pocket, yeah.

75
00:04:55,113 --> 00:05:03,475
But, so how we started PUBG was that our producer and the team wanted to develop the first standalone

76
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:04,716
battle royale game.

77
00:05:04,716 --> 00:05:09,117
I don't know if you're familiar with the entire battle royale, like, history of entire battle

78
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:10,157
royale genre.

79
00:05:10,157 --> 00:05:10,998
But, um...

80
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:25,243
When we started our project, the only Battle Royale games that were available in the market was The Culling, H1Z1 King of the Kill, and Arma 3 Battle Royale, which is not an official mode.

81
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:30,928
Our team wanted to develop a standalone Battle Royale game, and we looked at the...

82
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:39,574
industry and there was so much potential that Valorant had and we wanted to use that opportunity and

83
00:05:39,574 --> 00:05:46,459
launch our standalone Valorant game as soon as possible. So the goal was, you know, make a

84
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:51,962
realistic, serious Valorant game with an 8 by 8 kilometer open-world map.

85
00:05:52,675 --> 00:06:00,178
And with that goal, we were just doing some research and thinking about how we should start the project.

86
00:06:00,178 --> 00:06:06,280
And we found this guy who had been working on Battle Royale games for over four years,

87
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,741
and that player is known.

88
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:14,323
He had developed the first Battle Royale game mod on Arma 2,

89
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:16,844
and he had recently...

90
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:22,155
worked with Daybreak Games to help them create H1Z1's King of the Kill,

91
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:25,262
and we thought, you know, we want to make something authentic, and we...

92
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:29,833
had a different direction in the beginning,

93
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:34,456
but realized that we really need to go back to the basics

94
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:38,678
and create a Battle Royale game with the original feel.

95
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:40,059
So we reached out to,

96
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:43,461
our producer reached out to PlayerUnknown,

97
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:45,342
and it was just over a Skype call,

98
00:06:45,342 --> 00:06:48,163
and then within a few weeks, he flew to Korea

99
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:49,304
and joined the dev team

100
00:06:49,304 --> 00:06:51,305
and started developing PUBG together.

101
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:54,907
So that was a little bit about PUBG.

102
00:06:55,996 --> 00:07:04,580
So at the core of our community management programs and strategies, there's community snowballing.

103
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:11,304
We started with this definition in mind and knew that this was going to help us grow because we

104
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:18,627
were a small team of 25 people and no one knew about us. Some people know about Terra, which is

105
00:07:19,368 --> 00:07:26,654
MMO game developed by our mother company Bluehole, but we're a small team that had no, you know, marketing budget with the goal

106
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:33,700
very ambitious goal of launching this standalone Balearic game within a year on Steam Early Access.

107
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:41,906
So that was the goal and we thought, you know, PR and marketing efforts are not that necessary

108
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:43,248
if we build a good product.

109
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:49,049
And with a community snowballing strategy, we thought we could make this work.

110
00:07:50,273 --> 00:07:55,377
and we wanted to tie this with open development.

111
00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:59,961
For those of you who might not heard of snowballing,

112
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:02,783
you've seen in cartoon movies

113
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:06,506
where a Donald Duck picks up some snow

114
00:08:06,506 --> 00:08:11,009
and then just rolls down the snowball down the slope

115
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:12,210
and then it picks up more snow

116
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,791
and grows larger and larger.

117
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,313
That's what we did with our tester community.

118
00:08:18,303 --> 00:08:23,666
So this is just a general definition of community snowballing we had.

119
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:28,469
We wanted to develop a very close-knit, vibrant tester community.

120
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:33,212
So I will go through how we recruited people in the next few slides.

121
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:38,235
To build a community, you have to make them an insider.

122
00:08:38,235 --> 00:08:41,397
We're not a AAA studio, no one is interested in our game.

123
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:43,619
Like, who cares? Who cares?

124
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:46,360
Like, Brandon had his Battle Royale community,

125
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,224
but it was a group of really hardcore fans that love Battle Royale.

126
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:57,388
And it's compared to other gaming communities, it wasn't that big.

127
00:08:57,388 --> 00:09:03,232
So it was very important to us to really understand that core community.

128
00:09:03,812 --> 00:09:07,095
and make them a potential fan of PUBG

129
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:10,657
in the very early phase of development.

130
00:09:10,657 --> 00:09:14,780
And what's important in community snowballing

131
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,861
is that you have to strengthen relationships

132
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:18,462
and build loyalty.

133
00:09:18,462 --> 00:09:22,025
This is important to any kind of community management,

134
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:25,347
but it's much easier to achieve

135
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:27,429
when you have such a small community.

136
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:31,651
Like right now, we have a player base of

137
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:36,114
40 million people just on PC and Xbox,

138
00:09:36,114 --> 00:09:38,935
and it's very difficult to build relationships.

139
00:09:38,935 --> 00:09:42,657
But it's much easier when there's just 500 people.

140
00:09:42,657 --> 00:09:45,559
Like, you can't talk to every single one of them

141
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,381
if you spend like 12 hours a day.

142
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,862
And that was so easy back in 2016,

143
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:57,305
when I had the time just to give personal attention

144
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:01,847
to every single tester that was really active.

145
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:01,887
So.

146
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:08,989
That's really easy when you have a small community and it's also important to get them really involved in the development process

147
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:15,470
There are a lot of great talks and presentation on GDC vault about open development

148
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,831
I was a I was watching a lot of those

149
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:20,151
presentations last year and in

150
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:26,293
2016 to study what other games did to be transparent to their testers and what we did was

151
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,793
we had a discord server for

152
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:32,474
Alpha testers and we would share a lot of information in there

153
00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:38,140
And luckily, they didn't care enough to share it on Reddit or anywhere,

154
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:44,126
so it was just in our Discord and there were like 500 people just checking out web screens

155
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:47,330
and talking to PlayerUnknown and myself.

156
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,833
And that's something you could use for your community.

157
00:10:53,208 --> 00:11:01,711
So what was special about our snowballing was that Battle Royale games in general have higher viewability.

158
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:10,554
People love watching it on Twitch or YouTube because you can follow someone's journey from the beginning to end

159
00:11:10,554 --> 00:11:13,536
until that person becomes the last man standing.

160
00:11:13,536 --> 00:11:16,917
And this is something that we wanted to tap into.

161
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:19,658
So we thought, you know, we have to be...

162
00:11:21,318 --> 00:11:26,121
at least mildly successful on Twitch to promote our game with zero dollar budget.

163
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:33,705
And we knew that this could be, you know, our go-to marketing strategy from the very beginning.

164
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:42,609
And the second thing we thought was that we are a small game, you know, and no one was like

165
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:48,793
expecting us to be a game, like there are people who didn't believe that we would finish the game.

166
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:55,435
and a lot of Battle Royale players were saying they're not going to finish the game.

167
00:11:55,435 --> 00:11:59,736
H1Z1 was dominating the market at the time

168
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:05,058
and a lot of Battle Royale hardcore fans loved Arma 3 BR so much.

169
00:12:05,678 --> 00:12:08,860
and although they were very supportive,

170
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,202
they thought, you know, like,

171
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:12,663
they've never heard of the studio

172
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:16,886
and they knew that these guys didn't have experience

173
00:12:16,886 --> 00:12:20,768
in building a shooter game, so there was some doubt.

174
00:12:20,768 --> 00:12:22,209
And we thought, you know.

175
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:30,913
it's very important to reach out to those who would support us because that would be, you know,

176
00:12:30,913 --> 00:12:39,996
that would help us amplify and give more exposure to our game in the long run. And what was also

177
00:12:39,996 --> 00:12:44,638
important was that content creators are always looking for new content and

178
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:55,064
especially the lower tier ones are looking for something that's unique to differentiate their channels.

179
00:12:55,064 --> 00:13:00,666
A lot of bigger, like, top tier streamers will only play your game if it's mainstream

180
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,127
or if it will, like, grow their viewership as well

181
00:13:03,127 --> 00:13:09,170
or if it's, like, a very, like, hot topic of that, like, week.

182
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:19,894
But we knew that we couldn't, we didn't have the money to pay the top tier streamers to play our game when we did our public alpha test.

183
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:28,237
And we knew that the streamers that are in the mid-tier would be interested because they want to differentiate their channel with low cost.

184
00:13:28,697 --> 00:13:33,641
and they want to create something unique so they can stand out from the crowd.

185
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:41,467
And they don't have the resources or the connection to have access to exclusive content

186
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:47,972
of AAA studios. There was this opportunity for a mutually beneficial relationship.

187
00:13:47,972 --> 00:13:55,378
And we knew that if we gave them exclusive content and a chance to create something unique,

188
00:13:55,378 --> 00:13:56,879
they would support us.

189
00:13:58,193 --> 00:14:02,296
So I've lined out a few points here, but I will.

190
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:05,799
go through all the details later.

191
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:08,981
So we did our first alpha

192
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,923
after developing the game for four months.

193
00:14:11,923 --> 00:14:13,824
You will see that small screenshot.

194
00:14:13,824 --> 00:14:16,585
That's just the key art we had created.

195
00:14:16,585 --> 00:14:18,166
Brandon had tweeted out,

196
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,048
hey guys, I'm finally excited to announce

197
00:14:21,048 --> 00:14:24,230
that I'm working on my own standalone Valorant game.

198
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,732
And you can see that it got like 2,000 likes.

199
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:32,095
And we were very stoked to have this

200
00:14:32,995 --> 00:14:38,042
I'm just having this flashback while I talk about this.

201
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:41,886
And we had 1100 resistor testers.

202
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:45,891
That's a pretty small tester community.

203
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:50,216
And only 600 of them participated, and we had six hours of testing.

204
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:55,689
So this is, you know, I'll be uploading this presentation later on GDC.

205
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:57,390
You can check it out.

206
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,572
We had, you know, we were very scrappy.

207
00:14:59,572 --> 00:15:01,634
This was our Google form.

208
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:05,016
We just posted this on Brandon's Twitter and our website

209
00:15:05,016 --> 00:15:08,039
so people can click this Google form and sign up.

210
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:13,063
And we only looked at their PC specs and a few other things.

211
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:17,126
And on top of this, we invited the streamers that have been

212
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:20,128
long-time fans of Brandon's Battle Royale mods.

213
00:15:22,065 --> 00:15:26,413
So this is just the content and marketing calendar

214
00:15:26,413 --> 00:15:27,755
that I developed.

215
00:15:27,755 --> 00:15:30,279
I wanted to establish a healthy cadence

216
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,285
for content to show to our community.

217
00:15:36,071 --> 00:15:40,013
Brandon was very active, he was writing dev blog posts

218
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:44,276
and showing a lot of the stuff that was in development

219
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,776
on his Twitter and Discord.

220
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:47,878
Like, here are the samples,

221
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:50,499
like you can check them out on our dev blog,

222
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:55,642
and here are a lot of the WIP screens or videos we had.

223
00:15:57,782 --> 00:16:02,845
So the question we had before we moved into our closed alpha was that,

224
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:04,667
do we really want to test this?

225
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,528
Like after four months of development,

226
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:11,051
our build didn't look like what we wanted to, you know, show to the world.

227
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:13,633
And there was like a lot of debate around it.

228
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:15,634
Like, should we really do a public test?

229
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:19,257
Although there was an NDA, we're very insecure about it.

230
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:19,597
But...

231
00:16:20,765 --> 00:16:24,008
you know, this is what our game looked like after four months.

232
00:16:24,008 --> 00:16:28,513
It looks, you know, definitely different from what, you know, you played these days.

233
00:16:28,513 --> 00:16:36,060
The tone is different and there are a lot of bugs and the UI, you know, looks very interesting.

234
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:41,727
So we had this debate for weeks,

235
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,812
do we really want to show this to our small tester community

236
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:48,916
that are really passionate about this project?

237
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,880
And the answer is, you have to do it.

238
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,741
As an indie team.

239
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:58,502
There was no pre-launch hype. We distributed press release, no one really cared about. We got some

240
00:16:58,502 --> 00:17:04,783
coverage, but it didn't give us a lot of exposure and we had no marketing resources. And this,

241
00:17:04,783 --> 00:17:13,164
you know, closed alpha test was a great chance to really communicate to our tester community that we

242
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:18,705
are like committed to this and we have built something just in four months and we're excited

243
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:22,086
to show what we have in store in the next eight or

244
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:30,191
10 months. And we made it a privilege. We were very insecure about showing this build and thought

245
00:17:30,191 --> 00:17:36,234
people are not going to be happy or they're not going to have confidence in us. But

246
00:17:36,234 --> 00:17:41,197
it was a privilege because you had to be invited.

247
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:43,218
and you had to be a streamer,

248
00:17:43,218 --> 00:17:45,919
you had to be Brandon's longtime fan,

249
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,600
or you had to have good PCs to be able to test

250
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,322
that alpha build because it was very heavy back then.

251
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:58,803
And giving them exclusivity worked out very well

252
00:17:58,803 --> 00:18:03,465
because they had access to this exclusive content

253
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:05,626
on the private Discord server,

254
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,306
and we were giving them information

255
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:08,767
that no one had access to.

256
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,087
We didn't even share it.

257
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:19,657
with the media and we did a lot of communication to help every single player and tester understand

258
00:18:19,657 --> 00:18:22,399
that this is a very early version of the build.

259
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:29,525
We communicated that on a daily basis and I don't think it hurts to really iterate that

260
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:34,309
so they truly understand that this is a product that's being worked on.

261
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:41,089
So then after a couple months, we moved to our first alpha.

262
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:44,150
That pubs, that's not a typo

263
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,711
because we used to call pub G like pubs.

264
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:56,132
And in our first pre-alpha, our game looked different and it also started different.

265
00:18:56,132 --> 00:19:00,276
We would have 64 people running out of a starting building.

266
00:19:00,276 --> 00:19:08,043
And a funny story I wanted to share with you guys is that our office in Seoul is close to

267
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:12,227
a military base and we would have C-130 flying over the building all the time.

268
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:17,991
and Brandon thought we have the plane like in other VR modes so maybe this is a sign so we

269
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:25,175
should put the plane like into the game so that's you know how we have the plane in the game if C-130

270
00:19:25,175 --> 00:19:31,039
didn't fly over our office maybe it you know PUBG would start in a starting building 100 people

271
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,662
running out of the you know building that would be pretty hilarious but um

272
00:19:37,502 --> 00:19:40,623
So for the first alpha, we lifted the NDA,

273
00:19:40,623 --> 00:19:43,685
which means we allowed everyone to create videos,

274
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:46,686
share screenshots, and stream it on Twitch.

275
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:51,628
And our performance on Twitch during the test phase

276
00:19:51,628 --> 00:19:55,069
was 44,000 viewers at peak, which is not bad,

277
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,310
but we're like in top 10,

278
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:04,513
and there were a lot of games that had the viewership

279
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:04,653
of 128,000,

280
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:11,435
and we still had a small viewer base and you know this was at peak and

281
00:20:11,435 --> 00:20:18,757
average was much lower than that. So to lift or not to lift we had this debate

282
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:26,859
again before the alpha test because you know we were all insecure again like do

283
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:31,701
we want to show this to the public but this time it was even more scary because

284
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:37,354
If we lift the NDA, everyone will see the game on Twitch.

285
00:20:37,354 --> 00:20:41,639
And we're not very confident that this was at a stage

286
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:45,723
where we can show it to millions and thousands of people.

287
00:20:45,723 --> 00:20:46,103
But...

288
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:52,796
At the end of the day, we knew that we're just showing progress and we have to build, you know

289
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:57,638
some sort of hype towards beta and the next alpha and

290
00:20:57,638 --> 00:21:04,301
Brandon and our producer had this long discussion for days and days and we thought this is going to you know

291
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:07,922
Work for us. We have to show what we have and

292
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:08,463
It will be

293
00:21:10,444 --> 00:21:15,908
you know, great for them because they have access to this test build that no one else has

294
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:19,370
because they were invited or part of the tester community.

295
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,994
So it's really important to, you know, reinforce that sense of, you know,

296
00:21:23,994 --> 00:21:30,919
exclusivity. Like we always communicated this and there were, you know, a small group of people who

297
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:36,643
were wondering how you get access to that test and, you know, we would tell them you have to sign up.

298
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:41,386
Maybe in our next alpha test you will be included, you should wait for that.

299
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:48,949
So that really, you know, drove some interest among people who saw our game on Twitch and got interested.

300
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:53,471
And if there was a Twitch streamer who wanted to participate, we gave them keys.

301
00:21:53,471 --> 00:22:00,314
Like, we wanted to, you know, we wanted the streamers to stream it and give us feedback on their live streams.

302
00:22:03,244 --> 00:22:08,489
So moving on to Alpha 2, we did our Alpha test for four weekends.

303
00:22:08,489 --> 00:22:11,733
And you will see that, you know, our logo looked differently

304
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:15,216
for our Alpha and this time...

305
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:18,190
we had a bigger tester group.

306
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,695
We opened the applications for sign up again

307
00:22:21,695 --> 00:22:26,100
and we also identified and invited more testers and streamers.

308
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,504
A lot of people asked me in 2016 or 2017

309
00:22:29,504 --> 00:22:35,431
how I invited a lot of streamers to our test.

310
00:22:36,112 --> 00:22:37,352
And it's very simple.

311
00:22:37,352 --> 00:22:39,672
You just go to their YouTube and Twitter

312
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:43,353
and find their email address and send cold emails.

313
00:22:43,353 --> 00:22:45,334
So you do that for two weeks, and then you

314
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:46,974
have this long list of 1,000 people.

315
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:50,275
And you just send out a Google form.

316
00:22:50,275 --> 00:22:52,636
That's how it really works.

317
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:57,317
But sometimes it will just end up in their spam folder.

318
00:22:57,317 --> 00:22:59,777
And then after six months, you'll hear back from them.

319
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:01,218
Hey, Sammy, I got your email.

320
00:23:01,218 --> 00:23:02,458
It was in spam folder.

321
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,518
How can I get access to your alpha test?

322
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:11,462
like that happens sometimes but um you know when you send cold emails they don't really

323
00:23:11,462 --> 00:23:15,844
read it or they get interested unless it's something they've heard of but what really

324
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:20,426
works is that if they watch their fellow streamers streaming the game on twitch

325
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:22,227
and they don't have access they want it

326
00:23:22,647 --> 00:23:27,471
They want it and then they will you know somehow find you on Twitter

327
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:29,833
And ask for you know keys

328
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:35,018
So that's what started to happen in our alpha because we had it

329
00:23:35,018 --> 00:23:38,000
You know we had the test for four weekends

330
00:23:38,521 --> 00:23:44,546
and the group of streamers that have been with us from pre-alpha started streaming a lot

331
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:49,170
and they really loved what we had achieved, they saw improvements

332
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,933
and there was a lot of positive word of mouth going around

333
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:55,175
and that spread across Twitch

334
00:23:55,175 --> 00:24:01,200
and other streamers who didn't have access were wondering, like, how do I get access?

335
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,383
and then they would ask their friends, fellow streamers

336
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:10,245
where do you get keys would sometimes you know give more keys to you know streamers so they can

337
00:24:10,245 --> 00:24:15,747
share it with their community or friends or sometimes they would tell you know their fellow

338
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:20,748
streamers like go to Poopy Queen like she's on Twitter and then you know that's a very easy name

339
00:24:20,748 --> 00:24:26,390
to remember so they would come to me on Twitter and then say like where are my keys like how come

340
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,591
I don't get them so I would spend like hours and hours um

341
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:34,324
sending out keys via Twitter and email.

342
00:24:34,324 --> 00:24:37,067
And there was one time that during closed beta,

343
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:40,309
a lot of the streamers just wanted the keys

344
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:44,493
like at that moment that sometimes out hit

345
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:45,854
the limit of Twitter DMs.

346
00:24:45,854 --> 00:24:51,399
So if you send more than like three or 500 DMs in a day,

347
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:52,580
like Twitter shuts you down.

348
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:57,240
So you can't send DMs anymore.

349
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,721
So there were times where I would post on Twitter,

350
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:03,102
hey guys, I've hit my limit again.

351
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,742
I can't send you keys anymore.

352
00:25:04,742 --> 00:25:06,443
Like here's my email.

353
00:25:06,443 --> 00:25:08,683
Or I would just post keys on Twitter.

354
00:25:08,683 --> 00:25:11,744
So that's how you do it when you don't have money

355
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:13,165
and it does work.

356
00:25:14,603 --> 00:25:16,724
So we had 800 streamers participated.

357
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:20,285
You can definitely see that the number has grown from 128.

358
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,666
It's because I was just running around,

359
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:28,469
giving away keys, inviting more streamers.

360
00:25:28,469 --> 00:25:31,290
And for Alpha 2, we also had a couple of...

361
00:25:31,818 --> 00:25:38,461
external teams helping me out to identify more streamers that have not played Arma 3BR, H1Z1,

362
00:25:38,461 --> 00:25:50,346
The Culling, or other games. So the question we had was that if we scale this up by hiring a team

363
00:25:50,346 --> 00:25:57,989
of influencer management experts to identify more streamers, maybe we could grow this bigger. Maybe

364
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,370
we could have a bigger streamer community.

365
00:26:01,577 --> 00:26:09,380
And this is not a firm answer, but what I want to say by saying no to this question is that

366
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,461
they really want to talk to the developers.

367
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:19,324
Like, they really appreciate it when you approach them and give them information,

368
00:26:19,324 --> 00:26:22,105
even if it's just a couple of Twitter DMs.

369
00:26:22,105 --> 00:26:24,626
They want to talk to the developers or the community manager.

370
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:27,487
They don't want to talk to your PR rep.

371
00:26:27,487 --> 00:26:27,968
And...

372
00:26:28,448 --> 00:26:34,253
you know, the folks at the PR agency, they might be, you know, hardworking people,

373
00:26:34,253 --> 00:26:37,035
but they're not as invested as you.

374
00:26:37,035 --> 00:26:39,137
Like, they're not going to wake up at 2 a.m.

375
00:26:39,137 --> 00:26:43,520
and see a Twitter tweet and a streamer is like, where's my key?

376
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,661
I want to play it now.

377
00:26:44,661 --> 00:26:48,965
And then that streamer has like 20,000 viewers on Twitch.

378
00:26:48,965 --> 00:26:50,686
You've got to give them the key now.

379
00:26:50,686 --> 00:26:53,128
But the agency is not going to do that. Right.

380
00:26:53,128 --> 00:26:53,569
And.

381
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:59,014
You're really desperate to get the keys to the hands of the streamers.

382
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:06,101
So it's really important that you have someone that's fully committed to driving this effort

383
00:27:06,101 --> 00:27:11,427
while your test is publicly available and streamable on Twitch and YouTube.

384
00:27:12,553 --> 00:27:21,796
And what really helps is that there are people on Twitch that still remember how I used to work with them.

385
00:27:21,796 --> 00:27:24,577
And that really builds personal relationships.

386
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:29,699
And that pays back because they just want to help you.

387
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:36,041
And they know how you have been scrappy, like sleeping for six hours, you know.

388
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:40,463
And I was always responsive and they really appreciate that because...

389
00:27:40,983 --> 00:27:43,704
I helped them grow their business at one point.

390
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:51,688
When we were small, we were not very helpful in giving them push or helping them grow viewership.

391
00:27:51,688 --> 00:27:59,973
But when we made it, sort of, streaming our game was what they wanted to do and I was available.

392
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:03,497
and they really appreciate that because I gave them access.

393
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:07,202
It sounds very simple, but they remember that and they will help you.

394
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:11,607
They will help you distribute more keys and talk positively about your game.

395
00:28:12,935 --> 00:28:20,718
And I said this in the beginning, they always look for new or better content to build their business on.

396
00:28:20,718 --> 00:28:23,500
Some people still make fun of streamers saying,

397
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,921
like, how do you make money just playing games?

398
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:28,862
Like, they take it very seriously.

399
00:28:28,862 --> 00:28:33,004
All these successful streamers think like an entrepreneur.

400
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:34,305
So it's a business for them.

401
00:28:34,305 --> 00:28:35,405
And you have to think.

402
00:28:36,127 --> 00:28:42,912
like a partner, how do I provide opportunities and unique content for them to, you know,

403
00:28:42,912 --> 00:28:49,136
be differentiated, for them to be different and stand out from millions of other streamers.

404
00:28:49,136 --> 00:28:50,517
So we moved to closed beta in early 2017 and

405
00:28:59,888 --> 00:29:06,391
Then we still had a small community, but much bigger than what we had during our alpha phase.

406
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:15,676
And we wanted to reach a larger target market, so we looked at other games that are not Battle Royale or have Battle Royale game modes.

407
00:29:15,676 --> 00:29:20,158
We looked at casual gamers and top tier streamers and variety streamers.

408
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:24,360
And I continued to send cold emails, you know, Twitter DMs, tweets,

409
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,341
and also asked our community members to...

410
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:32,250
talk to their friends about our game.

411
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,591
And one thing we did during closed beta

412
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:37,872
was that we developed this Discord bot

413
00:29:37,872 --> 00:29:39,853
that was in our private server.

414
00:29:39,853 --> 00:29:42,113
So you would type a command,

415
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,334
and then that Discord bot would send you

416
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:46,315
like five keys via DM.

417
00:29:46,315 --> 00:29:48,035
Like it was a very effective strategy

418
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:51,397
to distribute keys to thousands of people that were.

419
00:29:51,797 --> 00:29:53,879
in our Discord test server,

420
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:55,640
and that was the privilege

421
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,862
that was only given to alpha testers.

422
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,525
So they would type the command and get the keys,

423
00:30:00,525 --> 00:30:03,187
and they could give it to their friends,

424
00:30:03,187 --> 00:30:05,549
or they could do a Twitter promotion.

425
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:09,173
It's very easy to develop.

426
00:30:09,173 --> 00:30:10,974
It's something that I highly recommend

427
00:30:10,974 --> 00:30:14,117
if you don't have a flashy website to distribute keys.

428
00:30:15,794 --> 00:30:22,384
And we started going to conventions like PAX West and we would have printed out like cars

429
00:30:22,384 --> 00:30:26,390
with key codes and it would just you know hand them out like candies.

430
00:30:27,671 --> 00:30:32,696
And our focus for closed beta was maximizing Twitch and YouTube coverage during closed beta.

431
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:39,722
My personal goal was, can we hit the number one streamed game on Twitch during this phase?

432
00:30:39,722 --> 00:30:44,106
So that was my goal, and I had to distribute more keys to streamers

433
00:30:44,106 --> 00:30:47,609
so they would stream the game during closed beta.

434
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:55,874
And this is the charts at the top right corner is a survey we did and it says,

435
00:30:55,874 --> 00:30:58,876
have you participated in previous alphas?

436
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:05,200
And a large portion of closed beta testers hadn't participated in our previous tests,

437
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,184
which means our strategy of promoting this through Twitch streamers were effective.

438
00:31:11,184 --> 00:31:12,464
You know, that was effective because...

439
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:21,771
People had not heard about us in the news, they just saw us on Twitch and found out that we were

440
00:31:21,771 --> 00:31:26,374
you know running closed beta, got interested and came to us for keys.

441
00:31:29,835 --> 00:31:32,737
So this is what we did during closed beta.

442
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:34,978
I will go into more detail in the next slide.

443
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:36,699
We had like a Twitch parachute

444
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:39,141
to celebrate the Twitch streamer community.

445
00:31:39,141 --> 00:31:41,882
We had built from pre-alpha.

446
00:31:41,882 --> 00:31:44,323
We had a small booth at PAX East.

447
00:31:44,323 --> 00:31:46,665
And one of the interesting things we did

448
00:31:46,665 --> 00:31:49,126
is that you'll see on the very...

449
00:31:50,487 --> 00:32:02,755
writes that we had 64 graffitis of streamers like logos or artwork that were placed in the game.

450
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:10,681
So if you went into Erangel and played you would see those like graffitis and this was to celebrate

451
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:14,844
the top streamers that helped us you know promote our game during

452
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:19,547
of second alpha and closed beta and this worked out very well for us.

453
00:32:22,725 --> 00:32:27,286
So we wanted to reward loyal testers and streamers,

454
00:32:27,286 --> 00:32:30,487
and the graffiti event that I showed you

455
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:33,289
is one of the activities we did.

456
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:35,609
And to reward loyal testers,

457
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:39,811
you might have heard of this famous PlayerUnknown set,

458
00:32:39,811 --> 00:32:43,632
where you get that PlayerUnknown coat and mask

459
00:32:43,632 --> 00:32:46,533
that was given out to all the alpha testers.

460
00:32:47,254 --> 00:32:54,020
And for the streamers who have been supporting us since like alpha and who started actively

461
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:59,564
supporting us during beta, we would give them extra keys. There were some streamers who got like

462
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:05,670
100 or 500 keys that they could share with their community and they could do like a

463
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:09,673
gleam giveaway or twitter giveaway to grow their following.

464
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:15,593
And that worked very well because we didn't give out keys ourselves.

465
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:20,075
And having those extra keys to share with whoever wanted them

466
00:33:20,075 --> 00:33:22,636
helped them grow their following on Twitter,

467
00:33:22,636 --> 00:33:26,257
or sometimes random people would stop by

468
00:33:26,257 --> 00:33:30,959
and do like a chat giveaway to get keys from their Twitch chat.

469
00:33:33,466 --> 00:33:40,031
And what we also did was that we were always watching Twitch a lot.

470
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:46,457
During closed beta, a lot of our devs had Twitch up on their screen while they were developing.

471
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:50,200
And there were a lot of interesting feedback from the streamers.

472
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,023
So sometimes we would actually acknowledge the feedback and act on it

473
00:33:54,023 --> 00:33:58,607
and give credit to the streamer or player after implementing that change.

474
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,330
And then, you know, in a couple of days,

475
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,291
it will be our one year anniversary.

476
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:08,231
And so we, you know, launched our early access

477
00:34:08,231 --> 00:34:09,411
on March 23rd.

478
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:13,452
And in 16 days, something happened.

479
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:16,393
Like we were, we got like the Guinness record

480
00:34:16,393 --> 00:34:20,414
for selling 1 million units on Steam as an early access game

481
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:22,094
and then we got six other records

482
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:26,055
for selling too many copies in a very short time,

483
00:34:26,055 --> 00:34:27,495
which was unexpected.

484
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:32,485
No one expected this in our team.

485
00:34:32,485 --> 00:34:35,388
Brandon and I were the most optimistic people.

486
00:34:35,388 --> 00:34:37,129
We were cheerleaders and our devs were like,

487
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:41,273
you guys are crazy, you guys just watch Twitch too much,

488
00:34:41,273 --> 00:34:43,495
you guys hear good things from the streamers,

489
00:34:43,495 --> 00:34:45,917
you guys are too optimistic, you gotta calm down.

490
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,739
But Brandon and I would be like,

491
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:49,140
we're gonna sell two million copies,

492
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,801
and they're like, you guys are being ridiculous.

493
00:34:51,282 --> 00:34:54,848
But, you know, we hit the record and it's all history.

494
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,954
And then during early access, we launched our PUBG Partner Program.

495
00:34:57,954 --> 00:34:59,456
And the PUBG Partner Program is...

496
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:10,852
something we were able to launch during early access because we became a bit successful during early access.

497
00:35:10,852 --> 00:35:16,774
We are now in a position where we were able to reward streamers for streaming our game.

498
00:35:16,774 --> 00:35:24,417
So we had a sign up page on our website where streamers would come and enter their information

499
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:26,958
and we would select streamers that had...

500
00:35:27,718 --> 00:35:31,379
that could be a great part of our community,

501
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,580
and we would give them rewards.

502
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,602
Rewards like VIP access to our parties

503
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,562
and access to custom games.

504
00:35:39,562 --> 00:35:41,563
Custom games is a feature in our game

505
00:35:41,563 --> 00:35:44,004
where you can create custom games for your community

506
00:35:44,004 --> 00:35:47,825
and then change the settings of Val Royale in our game.

507
00:35:47,825 --> 00:35:52,227
And then there were other perks that comes with the program.

508
00:35:54,422 --> 00:36:03,808
So the key points of early access, we continued to give benefits, but now we had the resources

509
00:36:03,808 --> 00:36:09,292
and some money to give back. And we wanted to give them bigger exposure.

510
00:36:10,173 --> 00:36:18,777
We launched a small advertising campaign and we were able to feature a lot of streamers there.

511
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:25,780
So we had a Facebook and YouTube campaign where we would grab clips of Twitch streamers enjoying the game.

512
00:36:26,301 --> 00:36:31,586
it's available on our YouTube channel and you can see, you know, we tried to capture all the crazy

513
00:36:31,586 --> 00:36:36,872
moments they had and it's so fun to watch because their reactions were crazy. This was a new game to

514
00:36:36,872 --> 00:36:43,198
them and there were a lot of, you know, funny bugs and glitches and we just showed it all so that

515
00:36:43,198 --> 00:36:47,963
people would think, oh, like, I want to play that game. What kind of, you know, game is that we...

516
00:36:48,644 --> 00:36:52,027
had that ad campaign and it gives them exposure.

517
00:36:52,027 --> 00:36:56,091
And all the streamers that participated in this

518
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:58,352
just did it for free.

519
00:36:58,352 --> 00:37:01,055
And we later rewarded them.

520
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:04,598
So we also did the in-game graffiti event

521
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,139
that I showed you earlier

522
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:08,881
and it gave them access to custom games.

523
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:09,362
And...

524
00:37:10,137 --> 00:37:17,784
The other thing we did was we created events to really celebrate the community that we built with them.

525
00:37:17,784 --> 00:37:22,508
And one of the most successful events we ever did was the Twitch Charity Invitational.

526
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:28,369
You can find out more about the event if you Google it, but basically it was...

527
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:32,915
We invited 64 streamers from North America and another 64 from Europe.

528
00:37:32,915 --> 00:37:42,547
And we had this huge group of streamers fighting with each other throughout a few games.

529
00:37:43,508 --> 00:37:49,434
we got so much exposure through this and the viewers loved it because they always love when

530
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:57,922
there's rivalry going on among Twitch streamers and we were able to hit an all-time peak in terms

531
00:37:57,922 --> 00:37:58,782
of viewership.

532
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:03,447
And we also had a streamer exclusive Pax East Mixer

533
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,949
where we would invite content creators and Twitch streamers

534
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:09,931
and really, you know, communicate with them.

535
00:38:09,931 --> 00:38:11,752
We had, you know, Brandon come in

536
00:38:11,752 --> 00:38:15,214
and he would talk about what's in store for PUBG,

537
00:38:15,214 --> 00:38:17,676
how we plan to continue to develop the game

538
00:38:17,676 --> 00:38:18,736
until we launch 1.0.

539
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,788
There were other programs and activities we did.

540
00:38:24,788 --> 00:38:27,014
We had Dev Livestreams.

541
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:28,798
You can watch that on our official Twitch channel.

542
00:38:31,451 --> 00:38:35,074
Yeah, we had, we, you know, arranged it ourselves.

543
00:38:35,074 --> 00:38:37,517
There were a lot of audio and sound issues.

544
00:38:37,517 --> 00:38:40,780
You should definitely watch it to learn what not to do in your dev livestreams

545
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:45,884
because there are so many issues and it shows how we are not prepared,

546
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:51,009
but kind of not afraid to give it a go and fail fast and learn quickly.

547
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:52,550
But you should definitely watch if you plan

548
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,853
to do like a dev livestream for the first time.

549
00:38:55,433 --> 00:39:02,859
And we gave rewards to all the alpha testers, which was the player unknown set, which is not available anymore.

550
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:12,046
And we attended Twitch meetups. Twitch is a bit interesting because they have a lot of local meetups in different cities and states.

551
00:39:12,046 --> 00:39:17,310
And we attended those meetups to talk to streamers and talk about our game.

552
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:20,593
So I was like a salesperson for our game.

553
00:39:21,294 --> 00:39:26,693
any months and you have to understand what it's like to be a streamer so

554
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:33,296
I created my own Twitch channel and streamed for three months.

555
00:39:33,296 --> 00:39:37,239
And I highly encourage that to all the community managers

556
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:42,163
who do not stream because it really helps you understand

557
00:39:42,163 --> 00:39:47,967
what it feels like to get donations and grow your following.

558
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:52,411
And that really helped me understand how they think

559
00:39:52,411 --> 00:39:55,433
when they want to grow their business and to viewers.

560
00:39:56,656 --> 00:40:00,158
And it's also important to what it's like to be a viewer or a fan.

561
00:40:00,158 --> 00:40:05,882
So what I did was I watched Twitch like all day long

562
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:10,725
during our alpha or beta phase and wanted to understand what kind

563
00:40:10,725 --> 00:40:13,727
of relationship they build with their viewers.

564
00:40:13,727 --> 00:40:18,770
At one point I was subscribed to 50 streamers and I was just paying that out

565
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,732
of my own pocket. I just wanted to support them for being

566
00:40:21,732 --> 00:40:24,594
such a passionate part of our community.

567
00:40:24,594 --> 00:40:25,894
But it really helps like.

568
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:32,659
because they know that you are from a small team and I'm just, you know, like a fangirl that want to support them

569
00:40:32,659 --> 00:40:35,500
and it also helped me build like a special relationship.

570
00:40:37,995 --> 00:40:41,097
So just to go over the key points,

571
00:40:41,097 --> 00:40:46,080
these are the points that I wanted to really highlight

572
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,661
through today's talk.

573
00:40:47,661 --> 00:40:51,183
Number one, you have to start with a small,

574
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:55,225
like exclusive community of hand-selected members first.

575
00:40:55,225 --> 00:40:59,088
We had the privilege of starting with a small community

576
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:02,370
that Brandon already had built for many, many years,

577
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:05,231
and they were already big fans of Balrial Games.

578
00:41:05,772 --> 00:41:10,592
And what's important is that to really strengthen that sense of exclusivity.

579
00:41:10,592 --> 00:41:14,373
If it's open to anyone, they're not going to be really interested.

580
00:41:14,373 --> 00:41:19,394
They want to be treated special, and they want to have something

581
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:23,155
that's just exclusive to a small group of people.

582
00:41:23,155 --> 00:41:29,556
And if you take good care of them and start treating them differently

583
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:35,137
after a certain time, they just become like genuine ambassadors for your gang.

584
00:41:37,025 --> 00:41:42,149
The second point would be that you have to, you know, especially for streamers,

585
00:41:42,149 --> 00:41:47,152
you have to give them something exclusive, something they can consume.

586
00:41:47,152 --> 00:41:51,255
Even if it's just a small nugget of information that's really important to

587
00:41:51,255 --> 00:41:55,278
their business and you have to make them feel like an insider.

588
00:41:55,278 --> 00:41:56,579
And that really.

589
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:05,244
helps them build their business and for testers, they feel like they belong to the community.

590
00:42:05,244 --> 00:42:11,708
And you know, you allow them to shape your game by allowing them to give feedback and you act

591
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:18,332
on them and you have to communicate the changes you made based on their feedback. And it's also

592
00:42:18,332 --> 00:42:25,096
important to communicate how, what they will gain from being part of this community. It's

593
00:42:26,733 --> 00:42:30,475
they're in it for some reason, they want something back.

594
00:42:30,475 --> 00:42:32,716
It's not that you have to pay them

595
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:36,297
or have to reward them in some way,

596
00:42:36,297 --> 00:42:38,358
but it's always good to provide them

597
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:41,300
with all the perks or benefits you can.

598
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,481
And while it's difficult to do that as a small team

599
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:46,562
without a big budget,

600
00:42:46,562 --> 00:42:48,883
there are a lot of things that you could try.

601
00:42:48,883 --> 00:42:52,225
I've shared the examples, and if you go to our dev blog,

602
00:42:52,225 --> 00:42:54,366
you will find a lot of evidence there.

603
00:42:55,876 --> 00:43:00,838
The things that we could have done but didn't do because we didn't have time,

604
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:04,979
I still kind of feel like if we gave in-game badges for Alpha testers,

605
00:43:04,979 --> 00:43:07,981
that would be really cool because you can brag about that.

606
00:43:07,981 --> 00:43:12,782
And we wanted to launch an activity point program to reword testers

607
00:43:12,782 --> 00:43:16,584
that were more active than the rest of the community,

608
00:43:16,584 --> 00:43:18,125
but we didn't have time to.

609
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:19,705
So it's something that you could look into.

610
00:43:20,446 --> 00:43:27,772
And, you know, it also, we wanted to have like a multi-tiered reward program for the streamers and testers.

611
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:32,577
But we're just busy, I was busy handing out keys and talking to all our testers.

612
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:38,763
So this is something you could, I would like to do if I could turn back time.

613
00:43:40,156 --> 00:43:44,038
The third point, content creators, Twitch streamers,

614
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:47,500
they have to be part of your marketing plan

615
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,860
if you don't have the budget,

616
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,622
and they will help you if you build

617
00:43:51,622 --> 00:43:53,563
the relationship the right way.

618
00:43:53,563 --> 00:43:55,224
But they're not marketing tools.

619
00:43:56,084 --> 00:43:59,428
A lot of publishers pay them to play the game.

620
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:02,131
You're not going to be able to build a relationship by doing that.

621
00:44:02,131 --> 00:44:03,592
And it's just a one-off thing.

622
00:44:03,592 --> 00:44:06,796
Like, they have to be emotionally invested.

623
00:44:06,796 --> 00:44:10,459
And to do that, you have to commit to building

624
00:44:10,459 --> 00:44:13,522
a mutually beneficial relationship with them.

625
00:44:13,522 --> 00:44:15,865
You have to, you know, invest a lot of your time.

626
00:44:15,865 --> 00:44:17,206
That's how I did it.

627
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:21,580
And to do that, you know, you have to understand their business.

628
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:27,347
You have to, you know, you highly recommend streaming yourself

629
00:44:27,347 --> 00:44:33,175
and becoming their hardcore fans and also treat them as your business partners.

630
00:44:35,428 --> 00:44:42,131
The last point I wanted to emphasize was that you have to directly talk to your players and streamers.

631
00:44:42,131 --> 00:44:49,835
Having an agency or outside help is always good when you only have limited time,

632
00:44:49,835 --> 00:44:53,677
but you should only do that when you want to scale things up,

633
00:44:53,677 --> 00:45:02,221
or when you don't really have the time to reach out to someone who's not a hardcore fan or who is like a...

634
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:11,768
streamer that wants to support you, but not as someone, you know, as passionate as your key, like, tester.

635
00:45:11,768 --> 00:45:19,154
Because you have to directly talk to them to build relationships, and that level of intimacy you build

636
00:45:19,154 --> 00:45:22,316
like, grows and then helps you in the end.

637
00:45:24,373 --> 00:45:30,235
If I could turn back time, I would rethink how I want to build a team out.

638
00:45:30,235 --> 00:45:36,217
Because when we came out of early access, we didn't anticipate the kind of success we had.

639
00:45:36,217 --> 00:45:40,479
And we only had a few people in the community.

640
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,300
I was the one who started talking to the streamers.

641
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:50,664
and there were community coordinators and assistant community managers that would interact with the testers.

642
00:45:50,664 --> 00:46:00,751
And I really regret not scaling fast enough to be able to communicate to a community that would grow exponentially in the next few months.

643
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:06,635
And we also failed to maintain the level of transparency we had in 2016 and 2017,

644
00:46:06,635 --> 00:46:12,439
because things grew so fast and we were not ready for that.

645
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:20,314
So I highly recommend growing the team before things take off so you're ready for that kind

646
00:46:20,314 --> 00:46:23,561
of exposure and the need for interaction.

647
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:31,012
So that's it for my talk and thanks for your time.

648
00:46:31,012 --> 00:46:34,574
And we're currently growing our team based in Amsterdam,

649
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:38,835
Seoul, Santa Monica, and other regions.

650
00:46:38,835 --> 00:46:42,137
So if you're interested, hit me up on Twitter.

651
00:46:42,137 --> 00:46:44,618
I'll be able to talk to you about TopG

652
00:46:44,618 --> 00:46:47,659
and other positions that you might be interested.

653
00:46:47,659 --> 00:46:48,519
Thank you.

654
00:46:55,155 --> 00:46:58,577
So it looks like I have a few minutes for questions.

655
00:46:58,577 --> 00:46:59,657
If you have any questions, you can come up,

656
00:46:59,657 --> 00:47:02,499
and then I'll be happy to answer any questions you have.

657
00:47:02,499 --> 00:47:02,839
Got a question.

658
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:02,959
Okay.

659
00:47:02,959 --> 00:47:04,960
To what extent do you validate the identity of streamers?

660
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,640
I find this quite time-consuming.

661
00:47:26,215 --> 00:47:31,056
Okay, so what it takes to validate the authenticity of streamers?

662
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:35,898
My answer would be that you have to spend a lot of time to watch them

663
00:47:35,898 --> 00:47:40,639
and check their Twitter, you know, see what kind of content they've created in the past.

664
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:44,800
It's definitely time-consuming and it's something that...

665
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:58,266
is difficult to overcome, but one thing you could do is look at what other games have worked on.

666
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:02,587
We have a list of partners available on our Twitter. Maybe you could look into that,

667
00:48:02,587 --> 00:48:07,649
because that means we've spent our time and that's the resource you could use,

668
00:48:07,649 --> 00:48:11,491
because we validated them. There are a lot of other games that have a list of partners

669
00:48:11,491 --> 00:48:12,831
available on their websites.

670
00:48:13,312 --> 00:48:15,973
So that's something you could use.

671
00:48:15,973 --> 00:48:18,294
Did you find Keymailer useful at all?

672
00:48:18,294 --> 00:48:19,474
Who?

673
00:48:19,474 --> 00:48:20,574
Keymailer.

674
00:48:20,574 --> 00:48:23,916
It's a system of distributing keys to streamers.

675
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:27,337
Oh, and using what? I didn't get that.

676
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:28,157
Keymailer.

677
00:48:28,157 --> 00:48:34,260
Basically, a YouTuber or a Twitch streamer would register with Keymailer.

678
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,860
Oh, Keymailer.

679
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:41,103
Oh, we used, like, we worked with some...

680
00:48:42,096 --> 00:48:49,124
beta test focus media to distribute more keys and I don't believe we use Keymailer but it was a

681
00:48:49,124 --> 00:48:54,189
platform that we had interest in and if we you know would have used them if we had time to work

682
00:48:54,189 --> 00:48:56,732
with them. Okay thanks. Thank you.

683
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:00,110
I'll switch languages. 안녕하세요.

684
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:05,652
이름이 레진이입니다. And I'm going to switch back to English now.

685
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:10,733
I'm the community manager for a mobile gaming company called Metamoki.

686
00:49:10,733 --> 00:49:16,774
And I know we're rolling out a game and the devs are really keen to bring people in.

687
00:49:16,774 --> 00:49:20,715
So some of these I'm going to try, although it's mobile, so it's a little different.

688
00:49:20,715 --> 00:49:22,156
And my question is this.

689
00:49:22,156 --> 00:49:24,216
Well, first, thank you for sharing your insights and your fails.

690
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:32,600
But that's something I'll probably be tasked with is kind of getting a feel for the key

691
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,162
times to kind of scale that team up, right?

692
00:49:36,162 --> 00:49:39,685
You know, and to expand, and that's something...

693
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:44,667
Can you go a little bit deeper into, like, what those key moments were where you probably

694
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:45,468
should have?

695
00:49:45,468 --> 00:49:51,992
So when did I realize that I should scale up my team?

696
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:53,473
I realized that...

697
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:59,558
few months ago because it has been a very overwhelming experience to have a game that

698
00:49:59,558 --> 00:50:02,919
has like a 40 million player base on Xbox and PC.

699
00:50:02,919 --> 00:50:08,882
But when I think we had this moment during closed beta when streamers were really enjoying

700
00:50:08,882 --> 00:50:13,163
the game they couldn't get enough of the game so they would beg us to extend the testing

701
00:50:13,163 --> 00:50:18,906
time and they were enjoying the whole experience so much they couldn't stop talking about it

702
00:50:18,906 --> 00:50:19,906
on Twitter or Twitch.

703
00:50:20,426 --> 00:50:24,188
And I feel like, oh, we have these like hundreds,

704
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,570
not dozens of people, hundreds of people talking

705
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,291
about our game on Twitch and Twitter.

706
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,292
That's when you should really scale things up

707
00:50:30,292 --> 00:50:33,254
when they are really emotionally invested

708
00:50:33,254 --> 00:50:34,755
and they want your game to succeed.

709
00:50:34,755 --> 00:50:37,456
And they actually talk about it on live stream.

710
00:50:37,456 --> 00:50:41,639
Like we had Shroud saying, I want to support these guys.

711
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:44,721
These guys just made a great game within like a year.

712
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:47,202
And I feel like that's when I should have hired

713
00:50:47,202 --> 00:50:49,163
four people to start building like.

714
00:50:50,284 --> 00:50:53,866
more relationships with content creators.

715
00:50:53,866 --> 00:50:55,327
Thank you.

716
00:50:55,327 --> 00:50:56,248
Thank you.

717
00:50:56,248 --> 00:51:01,191
Hi, so you mentioned that having an initial nucleus

718
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:04,633
of a community which knew of Brendan's work helped,

719
00:51:04,633 --> 00:51:10,196
but what would you suggest to people who are starting out

720
00:51:10,196 --> 00:51:12,378
and have to build that community from scratch?

721
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:17,461
And the second question is that on mobile,

722
00:51:17,461 --> 00:51:21,944
I know you haven't shared that part of your journey here,

723
00:51:21,944 --> 00:51:26,707
but given the context that many similar games

724
00:51:26,707 --> 00:51:30,450
were already there on mobile,

725
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:33,652
how did you choose to launch PUBG Mobile

726
00:51:33,652 --> 00:51:38,735
and how do you plan to expand the community there?

727
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:43,907
Okay, so your first question is, what do you do when you don't have a player unknown, right?

728
00:51:43,907 --> 00:51:44,988
Yeah.

729
00:51:44,988 --> 00:51:51,511
So, you know, what we did was, Brandon had a community, but what you can do is look at

730
00:51:51,511 --> 00:51:57,113
the fan base or community that already exists that are interested in the genre of the game that

731
00:51:57,113 --> 00:52:01,555
you're going to develop. Because there will be a community that's interested in, you know,

732
00:52:01,555 --> 00:52:06,917
your competitors, and you look at them and you can approach them and say, oh, we're going to develop

733
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:07,918
like a similar game.

734
00:52:08,338 --> 00:52:15,145
but differently. That's how you can start building your community and that's what we kind of did

735
00:52:15,145 --> 00:52:20,169
with people who are not really interested in our stand-alone game. And your second question was

736
00:52:20,169 --> 00:52:28,297
how did we decide to launch PUBG Mobile and how we plan to grow the community there.

737
00:52:30,476 --> 00:52:33,877
thought it would be cool to play Battle Royale on your mobile phone

738
00:52:33,877 --> 00:52:39,238
and we worked with, co-developed the game with Tencent

739
00:52:39,238 --> 00:52:43,460
and it was an easy decision, like we want our game to be on all platforms

740
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,981
so that people can enjoy Battle Royale wherever they go

741
00:52:46,981 --> 00:52:52,902
and I got a lot of tweets from our players that it's so cool to play PUBG when they're, you know, pooping

742
00:52:52,902 --> 00:52:58,024
so that's, you know, and it's cool, like

743
00:52:59,024 --> 00:53:03,585
we had the resource and time and we knew that the players wanted that.

744
00:53:03,585 --> 00:53:06,126
It's all about providing what they want.

745
00:53:06,126 --> 00:53:08,826
For mobile, it's going to be a challenge,

746
00:53:08,826 --> 00:53:13,647
but we definitely want to start implementing the same strategies

747
00:53:13,647 --> 00:53:16,728
and introduce similar programs to mobile as well.

748
00:53:16,728 --> 00:53:18,028
Thank you.

749
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:18,108
Hi.

750
00:53:18,108 --> 00:53:22,109
I was just wondering within the grand scheme of things,

751
00:53:22,109 --> 00:53:24,450
what role, if any, did early access play?

752
00:53:24,803 --> 00:53:33,747
play. Yeah. Was it necessary? It was definitely, it was not necessary in terms of community

753
00:53:33,747 --> 00:53:40,650
management. It was the, our dev team's goal to develop a standalone battle royale game

754
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:47,793
as an early access game within a year. And I think it was definitely necessary for development

755
00:53:47,793 --> 00:53:52,755
because it helped us snowball the community as well, because we were pushing out patches

756
00:53:52,755 --> 00:53:53,936
and fixing everything.

757
00:53:54,316 --> 00:53:57,097
on a weekly, bi-weekly basis.

758
00:53:57,097 --> 00:54:00,759
And that really got our community excited

759
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:03,020
because we were listening to their feedback,

760
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,160
we were fixing bugs as we go.

761
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,322
And it was an interesting time for our community

762
00:54:08,322 --> 00:54:12,363
to see the game evolve and change on a weekly basis.

763
00:54:12,363 --> 00:54:16,465
And that, alongside the snowballing strategy

764
00:54:16,465 --> 00:54:20,187
for the community, helped our community grow further.

765
00:54:20,187 --> 00:54:20,887
Thank you.

766
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:30,555
Thank you for the talk. I think you're the greatest community managers in the world.

767
00:54:30,555 --> 00:54:38,840
And I thought you share your knowledge and your experience right now, and I think there

768
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:47,105
will be more people copying it. And if you had a next project, and I think at that time

769
00:54:47,105 --> 00:54:50,427
you have a marketing budget more than this time.

770
00:54:51,432 --> 00:54:57,894
What would you do to expand your community for that new title?

771
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:04,016
If I could turn back time and had more money to do community management for PUBG,

772
00:55:04,016 --> 00:55:10,579
I would spend that money in building platforms for key distribution, which took up a lot of my time.

773
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:17,141
And I'd also spend a lot of time in building well-branded assets.

774
00:55:17,622 --> 00:55:22,464
so that we could raise brand awareness and help the streamers,

775
00:55:22,464 --> 00:55:25,226
help them with...

776
00:55:25,226 --> 00:55:27,607
We want to give them content they can post on Twitter.

777
00:55:27,607 --> 00:55:30,429
We had a very scrappy graphic assets,

778
00:55:30,429 --> 00:55:35,651
and you want the streamers and YouTubers to use your assets

779
00:55:35,651 --> 00:55:37,592
in their content.

780
00:55:37,592 --> 00:55:41,735
So we can get exposure through their channels,

781
00:55:41,735 --> 00:55:43,656
but we're not very good at that.

782
00:55:43,656 --> 00:55:45,997
I would spend a lot of time in graphic design

783
00:55:45,997 --> 00:55:47,338
and provide them with...

784
00:55:47,738 --> 00:55:51,040
all the graphic assets that they can post on Twitter.

785
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:51,240
Yeah.

786
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,441
Okay, thank you.

787
00:55:52,441 --> 00:55:53,282
Thank you.

788
00:55:53,282 --> 00:55:56,323
I was wondering if you could provide a bit more insight

789
00:55:56,323 --> 00:56:00,106
into how you channeled some of your community feedback,

790
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,007
especially as you went through alpha and into beta,

791
00:56:02,007 --> 00:56:03,448
because as communities grow,

792
00:56:03,448 --> 00:56:05,009
you get more and more different groups

793
00:56:05,009 --> 00:56:06,870
pulling in different directions.

794
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:08,871
Did you, would you say you put more time

795
00:56:08,871 --> 00:56:11,953
into that initial alpha group and gave them more weight,

796
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:13,674
or did you try and spread things out evenly?

797
00:56:13,674 --> 00:56:16,056
Or do you have any insight you can provide around that?

798
00:56:16,567 --> 00:56:20,793
So your question is how do we channel all the feedback we had?

799
00:56:20,793 --> 00:56:23,597
Yeah, and did you give any weight to certain groups,

800
00:56:23,597 --> 00:56:25,319
like that initial alpha core group,

801
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:28,143
or the streamers as you brought them on board,

802
00:56:28,143 --> 00:56:31,387
or as things opened up to just everybody,

803
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:34,051
did any group hold more weight to what you brought forward?

804
00:56:34,674 --> 00:56:39,037
Um, well it's not, I don't think it was about giving, you know, weight,

805
00:56:39,037 --> 00:56:42,279
more weight to certain pieces of feedback.

806
00:56:42,279 --> 00:56:45,781
It was more about testing something and then iterating.

807
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:49,303
So we would act on something we think that's going to work and we iterate.

808
00:56:49,303 --> 00:56:52,625
If that works, you know, we implement that to the next build.

809
00:56:52,625 --> 00:56:54,546
That's how, you know, things worked.

810
00:56:54,546 --> 00:56:57,828
There were some feedback that we're not sure of, you know,

811
00:56:57,828 --> 00:57:00,130
in early phase of alpha, we're not sure.

812
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:04,132
that whether we should have like first-person perspective,

813
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:07,134
which is something, you know, ridiculous to think about now

814
00:57:07,134 --> 00:57:11,117
when like a large part of the community enjoys first-person perspective.

815
00:57:11,117 --> 00:57:15,499
But there were a lot of streamers behind that idea and testers that supported that.

816
00:57:15,499 --> 00:57:18,201
And we gave it a try and people just, you know, loved it.

817
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:21,183
And they said this is like the real like Battle Royale.

818
00:57:21,183 --> 00:57:25,306
So I think it's something that you have to learn as you go and implement the changes.

819
00:57:25,306 --> 00:57:27,207
And you just have to iterate.

820
00:57:27,207 --> 00:57:29,789
You might fail, but you'd have to accept it.

821
00:57:29,789 --> 00:57:30,269
Thank you.

822
00:57:31,975 --> 00:57:34,258
Hi, thanks for the talk first.

823
00:57:34,258 --> 00:57:37,301
And my question is that at a certain point,

824
00:57:37,301 --> 00:57:41,285
when your community becomes so large,

825
00:57:41,285 --> 00:57:45,649
I'm pretty sure players all over the world like PUBG.

826
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:49,851
There are players from Brazil, players from Japan, players from Spain.

827
00:57:49,851 --> 00:57:53,352
They speak different languages.

828
00:57:53,352 --> 00:58:01,455
How do you manage the streamers and YouTubers and make sure to give them the same personal

829
00:58:01,455 --> 00:58:03,735
touch and to maximize the effort?

830
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:09,623
So how have we been communicating with a lot of content creators

831
00:58:09,623 --> 00:58:12,345
from different countries that speak different languages?

832
00:58:12,345 --> 00:58:13,186
Yeah.

833
00:58:13,186 --> 00:58:16,549
We didn't have that luxury during early access.

834
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:22,134
We only had someone for Korea and China, as far as I remember.

835
00:58:22,134 --> 00:58:22,674
But...

836
00:58:23,055 --> 00:58:27,361
what we did was we had a lot of Miis for other languages.

837
00:58:27,361 --> 00:58:31,707
So we had one person for Chinese, Japanese,

838
00:58:31,707 --> 00:58:37,114
and then we had one person for French at one point.

839
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:37,215
So.

840
00:58:38,736 --> 00:58:43,499
you could hire freelancers who would do the job to talk to the content creators

841
00:58:43,499 --> 00:58:48,022
if you're not sure about whether your game is going to scale up and have a bigger community.

842
00:58:48,022 --> 00:58:52,565
But it's something that you could definitely train other people to do

843
00:58:52,565 --> 00:58:56,808
and do it on behalf of you if you have the core programs lined out.

844
00:58:56,808 --> 00:58:57,068
Thank you.

845
00:59:01,312 --> 00:59:03,634
Congratulations for PUBG's success.

846
00:59:03,634 --> 00:59:05,575
And thanks for your sharing.

847
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:06,897
I'm curious about that.

848
00:59:06,897 --> 00:59:11,160
We know PUBG's MS do the publishing work and the

849
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,482
reverb do the marketing work.

850
00:59:13,482 --> 00:59:18,067
So you said at the beginning, PUBG is almost a zero budget

851
00:59:18,067 --> 00:59:20,529
for marketing.

852
00:59:20,529 --> 00:59:22,230
So why you say this way?

853
00:59:24,422 --> 00:59:29,664
So you're saying we had some agencies that we worked with and then we had...

854
00:59:29,664 --> 00:59:31,765
Yeah, well, we did the minimum.

855
00:59:31,765 --> 00:59:34,447
We got to get the news out, distribute the press release.

856
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:39,929
So we had a PR agency that distributed the press release and arranged interviews for us.

857
00:59:39,929 --> 00:59:41,930
But that's not really marketing.

858
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:45,932
It's like the minimum you have to do to give you some kind of exposure.

859
00:59:46,552 --> 00:59:54,035
But by saying zero marketing budget, what I wanted to deliver was that those activities weren't effective.

860
00:59:54,035 --> 00:59:58,356
It didn't do us a lot of favor and we didn't get a lot of exposure from that.

861
00:59:58,356 --> 01:00:03,338
And all the results that we had came from the activities we did outside of that.

862
01:00:03,338 --> 01:00:06,819
Of course, you have to have a PR agency.

863
01:00:06,819 --> 01:00:11,820
You don't know if you're going to blow up and then have a lot of media requests coming in.

864
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:12,160
Thank you.

865
01:00:15,507 --> 01:00:22,414
Hi. So you guys have a forum that's on your own site.

866
01:00:22,414 --> 01:00:26,798
You have a forum and discussion boards on Steam and on Xbox

867
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:31,063
and all these different entry points and places for communities.

868
01:00:31,063 --> 01:00:33,605
But I noticed that through your talk you're just saying engaging

869
01:00:33,605 --> 01:00:35,627
with our community as one entity.

870
01:00:36,828 --> 01:00:41,652
But in reality, it's actually very fractured and splintered.

871
01:00:41,652 --> 01:00:46,256
On your own community, there's hundreds of thousands of posts on Steam, there's a factor

872
01:00:46,256 --> 01:00:47,937
of 10 less.

873
01:00:47,937 --> 01:00:52,461
How do you manage all of these different communities?

874
01:00:52,461 --> 01:00:54,442
Is there a strategy to doing that?

875
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:59,226
Is there a desire to have a singular community for all of that?

876
01:00:59,226 --> 01:01:00,467
What are some of your thoughts on that?

877
01:01:00,678 --> 01:01:06,320
So your question is, we have a lot of channels, how do you be efficient and manage them?

878
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:10,822
Do we have a strategy to manage all different outlets?

879
01:01:10,822 --> 01:01:16,464
Well, it's a bit of like a painful question to answer, because that's our pain point right now,

880
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:22,067
because we didn't have time to consolidate everything in like the last few months.

881
01:01:22,067 --> 01:01:25,368
That's what we want to work on this year.

882
01:01:25,368 --> 01:01:29,830
And in the beginning, we only had a few channels like Discord, our forum.

883
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:36,715
and that was it. But now we have a lot of different channels, different players that speak, you know,

884
01:01:36,715 --> 01:01:41,478
different languages. So what we want to do is, we understand that it's going to be difficult to have

885
01:01:41,478 --> 01:01:47,902
a singular community. We just want to find like the right platform or even build one that will,

886
01:01:47,902 --> 01:01:54,547
you know, help our players interact with other community members and really enjoy having a

887
01:01:54,547 --> 01:01:55,987
conversation around PUBG.

888
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:59,790
and that's something we want to explore in the next few months

889
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:03,032
since we've been so busy developing the game and growing the community.

890
01:02:03,032 --> 01:02:03,212
Thank you.

891
01:02:03,212 --> 01:02:04,052
Great talk, thank you for sharing.

892
01:02:04,052 --> 01:02:09,616
During closed alpha, did you allow anyone exclusive access to share what they were doing,

893
01:02:09,616 --> 01:02:15,619
either through a video or a writer or something along those lines,

894
01:02:15,619 --> 01:02:18,141
or did you decide to keep everything closed?

895
01:02:18,775 --> 01:02:22,497
For closed pre-alpha, there was an NDA.

896
01:02:22,497 --> 01:02:25,259
So they're only allowed to talk about it,

897
01:02:25,259 --> 01:02:27,500
but not post any screenshots or share a video.

898
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,441
And then when we started our first alpha,

899
01:02:30,441 --> 01:02:34,263
we lifted the NDA and then allowed people

900
01:02:34,263 --> 01:02:37,304
to share any video screenshots from the previous test.

901
01:02:37,304 --> 01:02:38,745
OK, thank you.

902
01:02:38,745 --> 01:02:39,145
Thank you.

903
01:02:39,145 --> 01:02:41,606
Thanks for your time.
