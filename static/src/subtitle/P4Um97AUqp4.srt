00:00:03,815 --> 00:00:04,435
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:05,955
My name is Justin Ma.

3
00:00:06,115 --> 00:00:08,936
I did the art and half of the design.

4
00:00:09,817 --> 00:00:11,917
And I'm Matthew Davis, and I did the programming

5
00:00:12,018 --> 00:00:13,178
and the other half of the design.

6
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:18,240
We are pretty much the only two creators that were on FTL.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,100
We had a few important contractors,

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,641
like music and for writing, but it was pretty much just

9
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:23,721
the two of us the whole time.

10
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:27,583
It was about an 18-month project that we started shortly

11
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:30,764
after leaving a bigger studio about two years ago now.

12
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:35,919
I'll start by introducing the game for those of you that don't know what FTL is.

13
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:39,941
There's a screenshot that's pretty typical of what you expect in Faster Than Light.

14
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:45,444
The core concept is that we felt that a lot of games were putting you in the pilot's shoes

15
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,405
instead of the commander's shoes in science fiction.

16
00:00:48,606 --> 00:00:52,608
We watched Star Trek and Firefly and we watched the captain and he's the center of everything

17
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:57,611
and it's not the pilot and so we wanted to give you that Captain Kirk feeling, the controlling

18
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:59,852
your crew and telling where to aim and what to do.

19
00:01:00,332 --> 00:01:01,093
And so we have the...

20
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,454
basic game screen that you see all the time is just centered on your ship in the left

21
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:10,538
there and then the enemy ship on the right. And it's a kind of a tactical combat where

22
00:01:10,558 --> 00:01:13,761
you're targeting different systems and you're managing your power and you're commanding

23
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:18,626
your crew to go repair stuff. And it's all very kind of abstracted out because there's

24
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:19,707
no actual ship movement.

25
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:23,393
It's also largely procedurally generated,

26
00:01:23,594 --> 00:01:26,238
and so each time you play the game, it's very different.

27
00:01:26,499 --> 00:01:29,363
And very high difficulty is another hallmark.

28
00:01:29,504 --> 00:01:31,587
It was something that we did intend it to be very hard

29
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:32,188
from the start.

30
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:39,171
So just to introduce this talk a bit, first we're going to go through our design process

31
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:44,715
to come up with how FTL would work, the whole process from the beginning until the game.

32
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:51,980
And then the second half is going to be on how our experiences with actually releasing

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,463
and turning into a commercial product, which wasn't initially in the plan.

34
00:01:57,304 --> 00:02:03,065
So first, the first half, which we call designing without a pitch, I have to clarify, but pitch, you know, pitch can mean a lot of things.

35
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:09,347
In this specific situation, I'm saying it means that a very clear idea of what the game will be.

36
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:12,208
The game mechanics, the structure, the pacing, all that sort of stuff.

37
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:21,270
With FTL, we did not have that. We had a more sort of nebulous, overarching feeling that we wanted to achieve, which Matt will go through.

38
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:25,130
All we had in the beginning was one page.

39
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,310
I wrote a quick page of just kind of a summary

40
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,611
of the type of game that we could picture.

41
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:31,292
But it didn't describe the game.

42
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:34,993
It described more of just an atmosphere and a theme,

43
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:35,693
if you will.

44
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:38,414
And the bottom quote would be pulled straight from it.

45
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:40,375
And it's kind of really captures what we're going for,

46
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:42,056
this concept of we're out of food,

47
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,556
and half the ship is on fire, and there's

48
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:44,716
these aliens in the docks.

49
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:47,238
So we need to vent the rooms and kill some people,

50
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:48,998
but we save the day and meet scorpions.

51
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,420
So the idea is that you have these very layered problems

52
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,781
with a lot of different exits and solutions to them.

53
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:57,202
And that was kind of a core concept,

54
00:02:57,282 --> 00:02:58,743
but not much of a game on its own.

55
00:03:00,503 --> 00:03:02,444
We focused on spaceship simulations.

56
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:03,845
So there's some things we knew we wanted,

57
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:06,486
like we had crew members you'd move around,

58
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:08,187
you had certain systems you'd have to manage.

59
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:10,588
And there's probably a text-based adventure thing

60
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,368
involved as well.

61
00:03:11,788 --> 00:03:14,270
But that on its own, not really a game.

62
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:16,103
We could go anywhere from there.

63
00:03:16,523 --> 00:03:18,125
And we didn't really know where we wanted to go,

64
00:03:18,185 --> 00:03:19,326
but we were eager to get going.

65
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:22,810
The one kind of image, whenever we

66
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,632
try to describe it to friends, as we started,

67
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:27,174
was that maybe it would end up kind of like a SimCity,

68
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:29,236
but for Basel, Galactica, or the Enterprise.

69
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:30,858
We'd have thousands of crew members,

70
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:34,742
and you'd have morale, and food, and kind of a big picture

71
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,544
control instead of the micromanaging

72
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:37,285
that we ended up with.

73
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:40,988
very abstract representations of everything, morale, food, etc.

74
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:44,752
Yeah, that kind of stuff. And then with FORAX, which is very traditional for the space stuff,

75
00:03:45,152 --> 00:03:48,696
would be more trading in open world, maybe even building up a fleet,

76
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:54,101
just a lot more open-ended with a lot more content than what we ended up with.

77
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:57,383
And with the prototyping, there was also one moment

78
00:03:57,423 --> 00:03:59,765
when we were kind of picturing almost a diner dash in space,

79
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:03,148
where it's just these, if you picture one scenario in FTL

80
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:05,409
where you're like, you have that, half your ship is on fire

81
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,251
and you have three borders or something's happening,

82
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:09,492
we would just pre-set up those scenarios

83
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:10,633
and it would be like different levels

84
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:12,195
that you'd get scored on once you beat it.

85
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,536
And that was when we were really kind of desperately

86
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:16,418
trying to figure out a way to turn things into a game,

87
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,999
which we'll go into shortly.

88
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,539
but we had to start somewhere and so the initial focus was

89
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:24,500
because we were eager to just start programming

90
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,382
and get going on it, so the initial focus was a single ship.

91
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:30,843
That's largely because, you know, practicality's sake.

92
00:04:30,883 --> 00:04:32,684
What's the easiest thing to start working on

93
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:33,845
is a single, small ship.

94
00:04:34,205 --> 00:04:37,627
So this drawing was probably the first drawing I did for FTL

95
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:40,028
and you can see how we knew that we wanted

96
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:41,508
a sort of cross section if we're showing

97
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:42,309
the interior of the ship.

98
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:44,310
We weren't certain how big it would be.

99
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,991
You could see they're labeled by color for like,

100
00:04:48,752 --> 00:04:51,173
engineering versus medical or even living spaces.

101
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:54,154
So there's a lot of things that we weren't sure about this

102
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:55,855
at this point.

103
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,037
I even was playing with the idea of having a cargo ship

104
00:04:59,097 --> 00:04:59,837
attached to the bottom,

105
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:02,618
because I like the idea of in Aliens,

106
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,139
when you have to abandon everything

107
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,340
and you basically ruin the whole point of your mission.

108
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,641
Obviously that wasn't used.

109
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:14,300
The strange part is with this image is it was pretty much the description that was on the previous page

110
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:18,064
and that image were all we had for design docs when we started programming.

111
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:22,609
Like, that was what we started with. We had very little as far as structure in mind.

112
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:25,993
Yeah, so we just wanted to dive in and see how things felt because...

113
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,455
I mean, initially we thought this was going to be a three-month project just for fun on the side,

114
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:35,098
so we wanted to just start jumping in and trying things out. So the first thing we thought, you

115
00:05:35,138 --> 00:05:39,060
know, if we're going to have a ship and a layout, the easiest thing is a grid. So all the rooms

116
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,242
would be on the grid. We thought this would be a temporary feature, which turned out to be in

117
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:44,203
the final release as well.

118
00:05:44,383 --> 00:05:46,546
And that's pretty much a running theme on FTL,

119
00:05:46,606 --> 00:05:49,409
is we would have this simplest way to quickly get it

120
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:52,413
into the game, and then intend to maybe improve or make

121
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:53,334
it more complex later.

122
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:55,977
But there are some systems, especially like the grid,

123
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:57,179
that stayed right to the end.

124
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,160
Very surprising.

125
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,703
Even a lot of the code, which can cause problems as well.

126
00:06:02,627 --> 00:06:09,612
So, as you can see in this picture, I was enamored with the idea of working with a negative space in the ship,

127
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:16,637
being able to see if the power goes out to a certain room, you could see the actual power lines that have gotten disconnected.

128
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:20,199
If there are engine breaks, you can see the various things.

129
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:26,444
You could see oxygen flow, like there'd be a series of overlays where you get to see what's working on the interior of the ship.

130
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:27,905
And so...

131
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:32,656
You know, none of that very detailed atmosphere was used,

132
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:35,398
but you could see how I kept trying to want

133
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:36,538
to desperately add that in.

134
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:40,621
Kind of a native desire to always think bigger

135
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:41,641
than what you end up with.

136
00:06:42,121 --> 00:06:42,642
Yeah.

137
00:06:42,662 --> 00:06:44,683
As pretty much everyone in the room probably knows.

138
00:06:46,564 --> 00:06:50,106
So Matt's going to show a little bit of the first playable

139
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:52,327
that we actually had running.

140
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:55,759
So here is the first version of FTL.

141
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,040
You can see it has a lot of the same hallmarks,

142
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:02,043
like crew members that move on a grid, basically,

143
00:07:02,503 --> 00:07:04,264
the different systems in the room.

144
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,566
However, there's no real game.

145
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:10,048
All it is, the only goal is to survive a torrent of asteroids.

146
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:11,929
Open up that shield.

147
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,751
So to clarify, the little squares are breaches,

148
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:16,912
and red squares are fire.

149
00:07:16,973 --> 00:07:20,655
We also have algae, which is kind of the anti-point of fire.

150
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:24,137
It sort of heals crew members and spreads in no oxygen.

151
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,282
And there's a lot of things that are different, obviously.

152
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:32,584
The positional shields, we really both wanted

153
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:36,507
sort of X-Wing versus TIE-Fire style shields.

154
00:07:37,427 --> 00:07:40,670
If you open a door, you can vent your crew out into space,

155
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,372
which happens quite frequently and accidentally.

156
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:46,153
And a little bit more...

157
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:50,181
Oh, there's a bug.

158
00:07:51,301 --> 00:07:53,862
So you can also see an early version of the systems.

159
00:07:53,922 --> 00:07:55,562
We knew that we wanted power management,

160
00:07:55,602 --> 00:07:58,343
but in this build it wasn't particularly successful.

161
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:01,163
There wasn't really much point to changing it.

162
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:03,764
Yeah, you could overclock your systems, which is interesting,

163
00:08:03,924 --> 00:08:05,424
and that would drain fuel.

164
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:08,365
But that wasn't really fun in the end.

165
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:10,525
You pretty much just always have to overclock it

166
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:11,306
if you want to survive.

167
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:13,626
You can notice the cat portraits.

168
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:14,686
Those are Matt's cats.

169
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:20,337
which you'll see as we go through the screenshots, they stay a lot longer than they should have.

170
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:21,357
Yeah, they stay pretty long.

171
00:08:23,718 --> 00:08:24,999
What else? Anything of interest?

172
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:26,079
I think that's the important stuff.

173
00:08:29,783 --> 00:08:35,667
We basically, the first things we added was movement, the systems, fire, oxygen, and like,

174
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:40,471
so from that we started to feel like, okay, now you can feel like there's problems going

175
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:45,235
on in your ship, how can we make you feel like you're a captain, like, guys, go to the

176
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:45,735
engine room.

177
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,236
So those were the first things we had to...

178
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:51,359
We knew that ultimately there would need to be this ship simulation and the stuff

179
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:55,282
that we started with that we felt was fun for a ship simulation was oxygen

180
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:58,884
being probably the very first system in the game, followed by people that could

181
00:08:58,924 --> 00:09:02,447
walk around your ship. And it was just, it was always built from just, let's make a

182
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:05,148
really simple representation of a ship and then we'll figure out where we're

183
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:07,770
actually going to put the ship and what type of game that ship is going to exist in.

184
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:14,679
Yeah, I remember being very shocked by the scene in Battlestar Galactica where they bent

185
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,242
part of that ship and all those people died.

186
00:09:16,262 --> 00:09:18,264
So that was like something we knew we really wanted.

187
00:09:18,585 --> 00:09:21,288
So from this build, which I don't know how long it took.

188
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:22,530
About a month.

189
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,092
About a month into our work.

190
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:31,620
We found out that the micromanaging, well the managing of crew around your ship, dealing with

191
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:37,745
problems, that was pretty enjoyable, focusing on the interior. When problems were very scalable,

192
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:44,511
you get a very small thing which can cascade into a series of impossible to recover from problems,

193
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:48,675
and all that was really exciting, and we thought it worked pretty well. What didn't work pretty well

194
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:50,857
was the abstract.

195
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:54,637
lack of game goal, there's no real game there.

196
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:57,439
The micromanaging, I don't know if you noticed, but

197
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,940
you can move crew based on squares and fire spread based on squares.

198
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,962
So you need to like surround fire and then move around and then work as a group to move

199
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:09,565
like that and that was not fun at all. You would be pausing constantly even more than the

200
00:10:09,605 --> 00:10:11,906
current version of the game and just getting

201
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:13,907
three crew members to fight one fire.

202
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:17,249
otherwise the ship would just completely be destroyed.

203
00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:21,111
Yeah, so I mean it was, I was, if you like micromanagement it was kind of fun,

204
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:23,031
but it was not the direction we wanted, this sort of,

205
00:10:23,432 --> 00:10:27,553
this commander feeling, not this like very detailed focused feeling.

206
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:31,835
So, where could we bring the game from this point?

207
00:10:32,595 --> 00:10:36,716
We felt the most important thing to add next would have to be combat,

208
00:10:36,796 --> 00:10:39,397
because that would have to be in the game in some form or other,

209
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:43,519
so we may as well try and add combat to the mix and see how that feels.

210
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:49,479
We went initially for the very traditional type of combat where you immediately picture

211
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:55,104
with a space two-dimensional shooter type thing where you zoom out and you can manage

212
00:10:55,124 --> 00:10:58,767
your ship on a 2D space and you're just kind of shooting at each other.

213
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:03,411
It wasn't very tactical in that you couldn't target specific systems, you couldn't really

214
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:05,292
do anything other than broadside each other.

215
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:08,276
and you'd have to be zooming in and out on the ship

216
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:09,317
to manage your crew.

217
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:12,742
So you'd manage your crew, zoom out, and position them,

218
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:14,624
and then when you zoom in, half your ship's on fire,

219
00:11:14,764 --> 00:11:17,347
and half your crew's dead while you were managing the space

220
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:17,648
battle.

221
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,533
But it was also a lot of fun to zoom in on the enemy ship

222
00:11:21,673 --> 00:11:23,375
and see half their ship was on fire as well,

223
00:11:23,435 --> 00:11:24,657
and nobody was having a good time.

224
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:31,232
One other aspect, we were pretty, we really wanted to have multiple ships

225
00:11:31,553 --> 00:11:34,998
and this would be an easy way to have like a mini fleet battle.

226
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:41,288
If you played like Weird Worlds or countless space games, an image like this is probably pretty familiar.

227
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:45,491
It also will allow us to do the sort of shield,

228
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:49,433
the positional shields as well as positional based weapons

229
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:52,875
like weapon cones so you have to organize and strategize

230
00:11:52,915 --> 00:11:54,736
where you want to put your weapons based on strategy

231
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,997
and you can also turn your ship to sort of protect

232
00:11:57,057 --> 00:11:57,818
a certain side.

233
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,739
And at this point we were actually generating

234
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,320
a long list of different weapons and designs

235
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,541
that we thought would work really well

236
00:12:03,781 --> 00:12:04,841
with this type of combat.

237
00:12:06,202 --> 00:12:08,203
And that's basically the same.

238
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:09,564
Oh, there was another thought with the,

239
00:12:10,873 --> 00:12:13,194
because of the lack of crew control,

240
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:14,275
because you're zooming in and out,

241
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:16,656
there was a moment that both power and crew control

242
00:12:16,696 --> 00:12:17,816
we'd considered automating it.

243
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:19,937
So you would, when you zoomed out,

244
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:21,298
your crew would still do their thing,

245
00:12:21,598 --> 00:12:22,519
so you wouldn't actually zoom in

246
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,579
and find half the ship dead.

247
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,940
But it was not something actually implemented,

248
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,541
but it was intended for if that actually went forward.

249
00:12:29,102 --> 00:12:33,022
But when we stopped to consider this, well, there were a lot of things we thought were fun,

250
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:38,104
like zooming in and seeing the enemy get destroyed. And some of the positional

251
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:43,185
combat can be interesting. We felt the vast majority of it wasn't fun. And at

252
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:47,325
this point I actually thought the entire game wasn't fun. The micromanagement

253
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:51,446
didn't work, it was too heavy, and then when you're zooming out to do combat, the

254
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:55,407
combat was muddy and didn't work well, and the micromanagement failed.

255
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:59,709
everything, nothing was working together and we weren't capturing the feeling we

256
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:04,092
wanted at all. It was hectic and and difficult to know what was even

257
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:09,634
happening. Instead we realized as we thought about it that the commander

258
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:13,857
aspect, if you're gonna capture Star Trek, if you're gonna capture a Firefly, the

259
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:17,679
positioning of the ship didn't matter. It was flying around wasn't something

260
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:21,901
you ever watched. The most you ever heard a captain yell was Delta formation and

261
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:25,143
that was the extent of the of the movement that you ever saw on Star Trek.

262
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:30,504
And so we started to consider if removing ship movement was even possible.

263
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:33,165
And it wasn't something we could really pull on other games for.

264
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:36,306
The overriding image in my head was Tetris.

265
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:40,608
And this idea that you're sitting here dealing with a bunch of cascading problems

266
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:41,728
as these bricks are falling,

267
00:13:42,148 --> 00:13:45,649
and your enemy or your opponent is dealing with their bricks falling.

268
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:47,990
And then every once in a while, at least in some versions,

269
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,651
if you're successful, you get to throw a bunch of bricks at the other guy.

270
00:13:51,472 --> 00:13:55,905
and that was the basic concept of what we could see FTL working on and that you're both

271
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:59,355
frantically fixing your ship and every once in a while you get to throw a bunch of problems at the other guy.

272
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:05,457
One of the other things that we realized was just that we have to be able to show everything on one screen.

273
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:06,978
There's no two ways about it.

274
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:12,722
The moving between screens to get additional information just would not work.

275
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:20,987
And so from this point, we tried to focus on those feelings as well as consolidating the UI.

276
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:27,192
We became almost phobic of making you ever open anything other than the one main screen.

277
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:27,912
Yeah.

278
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:36,558
So then this was after Matt had the Tetris idea, which really, it was at that point where like, wait a minute, this could actually work.

279
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:41,301
And okay, let's go back in and try really hard, because I think it could possibly work.

280
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:43,202
This screen was...

281
00:14:44,023 --> 00:14:47,425
the first version where we tried to implement that.

282
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:49,367
You can see we still have multiple ships

283
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:50,527
that you can potentially fight.

284
00:14:51,268 --> 00:14:55,471
We still had the very unusual system management

285
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:56,932
which wasn't particularly functional,

286
00:14:57,752 --> 00:14:59,153
and some basic weapons.

287
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:06,885
From this point, this is a mock-up, it wasn't in-game, but you can see at this point we came up with the idea to

288
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:13,867
another turning point in the game was having the power bars, the way the power bars work, having them be

289
00:15:14,587 --> 00:15:17,969
representative of many different things. It was, it's the...

290
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:23,033
how much power is being used, it's the strength of the system, it's the potential strength of the system,

291
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:26,817
it's the damage, it's whether you're repairing it, it's whether it's on fire,

292
00:15:27,137 --> 00:15:34,204
so like all these things are shown in this very small icon which previously was throughout the whole ship.

293
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:45,724
So this was a first trying to add those into the game as well as trying to figure out how we could potentially show weapons and how much information would need to be shown with them.

294
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:50,488
And you also see an early version of what I call the croissant ship.

295
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:57,891
and also the collapsible menus.

296
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,952
So we were still worried that there would be

297
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,712
too much information at any given time,

298
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:04,574
so we were playing with the idea of things being hidden

299
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:06,274
and popping up when necessary.

300
00:16:06,714 --> 00:16:08,655
And that also was abandoned for the same reason

301
00:16:08,695 --> 00:16:11,616
of being just too much movement.

302
00:16:11,816 --> 00:16:13,257
And you really need to see everything.

303
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:15,298
There's no moment that you're like,

304
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:17,639
oh, I don't care about my weapons in the middle of a fight.

305
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,340
So the idea of collapsing was definitely necessary.

306
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:26,128
Now we sort of figured out the basic layout that we wanted to show the information and how to have the weapons

307
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:28,089
fit on the screen more cleanly.

308
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:35,591
We also realized that at least for now we'd have to do a single ship combat. We just wouldn't be able to add

309
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,031
multiple ships for the time being.

310
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:44,093
Other things to note, this is when we started to realize that the size of the ships were a problem.

311
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:52,478
We really felt this project was just going to be just for fun,

312
00:16:52,518 --> 00:16:53,139
a small thing.

313
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,661
So there's a couple structural things

314
00:16:55,721 --> 00:16:57,503
which came back to bite us in the ass,

315
00:16:57,863 --> 00:17:01,226
such as the very limited screen resolution.

316
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:04,188
And so once we realized we were going

317
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:07,091
to use this screen resolution and that we were using

318
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:10,153
this pixel art, things like slightly shrinking the ships

319
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:14,297
or the rooms even, we realized it really wasn't an option.

320
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:15,598
Like, it just doesn't look good.

321
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,341
And so we had to realize we'd shrink the ships down.

322
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:20,942
But that didn't happen yet.

323
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:23,684
If you want to go.

324
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:25,466
Sorry, just a big one on this one

325
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:28,869
was the consolidation of systems into rooms.

326
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:31,371
We used to have systems in individual rooms.

327
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:33,272
I mean, individual squares in the room.

328
00:17:33,312 --> 00:17:34,452
So it wasn't really the engine room,

329
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,133
it was the engines inside of that room.

330
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,534
And so if you had to work on it,

331
00:17:37,554 --> 00:17:38,954
you'd have to go over to that corner.

332
00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:40,635
And there was all these white spaces,

333
00:17:40,675 --> 00:17:44,177
like this long hallway, and this giant middle bit,

334
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,377
which did kind of stick around,

335
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:46,658
but really started putting systems

336
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:47,758
like cloaking into it later.

337
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,079
And it was this consolidation,

338
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,580
so that the system was the room,

339
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,281
and there was no distinction between them,

340
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,601
really helped that.

341
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,183
the streamlining effect and the whole commander feeling.

342
00:17:58,423 --> 00:18:01,945
Because it stopped being, you know, go to A1, B1 of the engine room and do something.

343
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:03,605
It was just, you get to the engine room.

344
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:04,826
You get to the shield room.

345
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:07,867
And it was very straightforward and a much more elegant solution than trying to

346
00:18:07,907 --> 00:18:09,568
pack the rooms with individual details.

347
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,009
Which at one point we were really trying to get

348
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,730
very detailed on, sorry.

349
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:21,779
And also, that was a precursor to us realizing we needed room-based movement for the crew,

350
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:23,761
which didn't come around until a bit later.

351
00:18:23,781 --> 00:18:27,463
We stuck with the micromanaging for far longer than we should have.

352
00:18:27,903 --> 00:18:33,166
And in this mock-up, this was the full-size version of this proto-Kestrel, which...

353
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:39,268
I was, this was me trying to really go back to the atmosphere inside the ship and if we

354
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:42,910
had a much slower paced game, which was, you know, we could have gone in that direction,

355
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,132
we could have had a lot less combat, more trade, all that kind of stuff.

356
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:49,253
If we had gone that way, I would have wanted to have the...

357
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:54,955
inside of the ship be very atmospheric. You could see there's in the airlock there's some little

358
00:18:54,975 --> 00:19:00,936
spacesuits. You guys go walk over there put on a spacesuit go outside and fix a breach or take off

359
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:06,277
a drone that's attached itself to a ship. If a system is under duress it would be smoking and

360
00:19:06,457 --> 00:19:12,379
eventually break and shatter or whatever. And so or like you'd see the captain go walk over into

361
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:17,000
the cockpit and sit down in the chair and then start typing. And so all these things were you know

362
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,645
ideas from bygone age, which I was still trying to cram into the game, but we quickly realized

363
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:28,290
that that wouldn't be possible, especially since we started really figuring out the type

364
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,333
of gameplay that we wanted to have. And so this was...

365
00:19:33,003 --> 00:19:33,103
uh...

366
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,766
when was this? Six months. Six months into the development when we had like

367
00:19:37,347 --> 00:19:38,488
when it

368
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:39,449
when we were uh...

369
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:42,051
preparing to submit to IGF China 2011

370
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:46,796
we basically in three weeks turned a whole bunch of weird ideas and gameplay

371
00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:48,077
systems into an actual game

372
00:19:48,757 --> 00:19:50,439
uh... and so that crunch period was like

373
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,942
pretty intense but it was uh... it was very useful for the whole game

374
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,904
and for example during that period

375
00:19:55,924 --> 00:19:55,964
uh...

376
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,592
my brother, who's also a game designer,

377
00:20:00,212 --> 00:20:02,533
he was like, you gotta get rid of the circles.

378
00:20:02,573 --> 00:20:03,674
You gotta get rid of the circles.

379
00:20:03,694 --> 00:20:05,115
And we're like, what's wrong with the circles?

380
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:05,936
I like the circles.

381
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:08,637
And then, so at this point, we added crew members

382
00:20:08,677 --> 00:20:10,939
and we also separated the subsystems

383
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,340
because we realized we wanted the power management

384
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,722
to be more functional and more interesting

385
00:20:15,742 --> 00:20:17,063
at the core of the game,

386
00:20:17,123 --> 00:20:19,024
and that wasn't the case earlier.

387
00:20:19,338 --> 00:20:21,159
So you see, even though we got rid of the circles,

388
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:23,740
the crew just kind of stand there awkwardly in this version.

389
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,201
And adding consoles was such a major change

390
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:28,141
for the atmosphere.

391
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,943
Like, the biggest thing for me when we first added that

392
00:20:31,383 --> 00:20:33,524
was that instead of the enemy standing around awkwardly

393
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:34,304
while you destroyed them,

394
00:20:34,644 --> 00:20:36,705
you saw the little guys typing furiously away

395
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,665
to destroy you.

396
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,406
And it was just really kind of a scary atmosphere moment

397
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,707
that this was a living ship with people doing things on it.

398
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:44,728
Which, as you can see from this screenshot,

399
00:20:44,788 --> 00:20:46,469
it just doesn't really have that same feeling.

400
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:55,215
And so at this point, we, about six months, we felt like we had the core game.

401
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:59,899
We sort of fumbled around through our ideas constantly and eventually arrived at what

402
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:01,761
would progress to the final game.

403
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:07,847
We had some events, we had seven events, you know, like you fight a pirate, you're fighting

404
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:08,928
a pirate in an asteroid.

405
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:14,039
With that and this sort of very basic sector map,

406
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,544
we had this core game, which we felt

407
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:20,287
like could potentially work.

408
00:21:20,827 --> 00:21:23,851
And then so for the rest of development, a whole year

409
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:26,495
was just spent polishing that game idea.

410
00:21:29,118 --> 00:21:32,399
In this final screenshot, you can see the game at release,

411
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,900
which we basically just added tons of content and polish.

412
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,400
The ship doesn't look as hollow.

413
00:21:38,641 --> 00:21:41,802
There's various alien races and places you can explore.

414
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:45,483
We abandoned the kitties for little crew portraits.

415
00:21:48,184 --> 00:21:53,048
tons of weapons and more complication due to ion versus locking your system

416
00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:57,112
for for when you use it and of course the weapons they that were exterior to

417
00:21:57,152 --> 00:22:01,937
the ship which added tons of atmosphere to the game as well so

418
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:06,916
That is the end of part one.

419
00:22:08,236 --> 00:22:12,037
Just to sort of recap a bit, we started

420
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,778
with this very vague idea for a concept.

421
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:17,799
And we used that as a sort of guiding principle,

422
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:19,540
a guiding light for the whole project.

423
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:27,966
By having this one singular focus we were able to abandon everything else that didn't fit in line

424
00:22:28,006 --> 00:22:33,091
We we felt like we really wanted multi multi ship fights, but eventually that just had to go

425
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:37,355
We want spatial movement, but because that didn't fit in that core feeling

426
00:22:37,895 --> 00:22:43,500
We were we felt the freedom like we could just ditch it and keep on moving keep on going to that singular goal

427
00:22:45,082 --> 00:22:52,432
And so if anyone wants to use this specific thought process in their design, I mean, technically that focus could be anything.

428
00:22:52,492 --> 00:22:56,237
It could be a certain type of visual aesthetic.

429
00:22:56,397 --> 00:23:00,583
It could be one game mechanic that you want to be really focused on.

430
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:02,244
It could be audio, or it could be a story.

431
00:23:02,624 --> 00:23:05,866
So by having this one focus and letting

432
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,227
that direct your whole experience,

433
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:12,769
you can basically approach your builds slightly distance

434
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:17,292
and be able to look at it and find out what's actually fun,

435
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,354
what should we actually keep that will make the game

436
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:22,175
into the experience that we want, which you.

437
00:23:22,355 --> 00:23:25,876
you know very often you can get bogged down when you spend months designing a

438
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:29,157
certain whole gameplay system and it just doesn't work and you just keep

439
00:23:29,177 --> 00:23:34,059
spending months and months like trying to make it cram that in and and so it

440
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,820
was helpful that we didn't have pages of design documents

441
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:39,475
before we got going for that reason.

442
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:42,277
Yeah, we just had this one idea, and then we just dove in.

443
00:23:42,437 --> 00:23:44,618
And it probably doesn't work for everybody,

444
00:23:44,658 --> 00:23:47,240
but it definitely helped us stay agile

445
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,402
and actually find a game mechanic and a gameplay system

446
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:53,403
that A, we didn't know it could exist,

447
00:23:53,483 --> 00:23:56,404
and B, we hadn't had seen precedent for it.

448
00:23:56,765 --> 00:23:58,285
I hear there's other games that we ourselves

449
00:23:58,305 --> 00:23:59,646
hadn't played other games like this.

450
00:24:00,126 --> 00:24:02,247
So it allowed us to sort of stumble on that

451
00:24:02,648 --> 00:24:05,209
and be open to seeing what was interesting in it.

452
00:24:07,897 --> 00:24:13,121
For part two, we'll kind of talk about a lot of the stuff that happened in our final six months of development

453
00:24:13,261 --> 00:24:17,644
as we got to kind of in the public eye through our Kickstarter and a beta.

454
00:24:18,064 --> 00:24:24,109
We finally kind of came out of our cave, if you will, to see how the game and the design got changed because of that.

455
00:24:27,374 --> 00:24:33,539
At this point, right about the time that we released it for China IGF, the FTL was at

456
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,680
a point that it didn't have a lot of the stuff still.

457
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,044
It didn't have boarding, it didn't have cloaking, it didn't have teleporters, it didn't have

458
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:43,607
a lot of the features that you know are really important to the game.

459
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:47,770
And the biggest problem with it then was this lack of the layers.

460
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,552
I still, at this point, didn't think the game was fun.

461
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:56,136
It was, we found success that I'm grateful for at the China IGF, but I was still really

462
00:24:56,176 --> 00:24:59,679
nervous about the game and felt like it just didn't keep you busy enough and there wasn't

463
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:00,459
enough going on.

464
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:06,663
And so the main goal going on from there was this layering of more things to keep you busy.

465
00:25:07,444 --> 00:25:10,326
It was fun though and just the, there was a potential there.

466
00:25:10,346 --> 00:25:12,247
It wasn't any more like we even considered abandoning it.

467
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:14,608
We just knew that we needed more content to keep it going.

468
00:25:17,508 --> 00:25:20,509
Sadly, about a year into development is when we were running low on funds.

469
00:25:20,629 --> 00:25:24,530
Since it started as a hobby project, we never really intended to go as long as we did.

470
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,230
And so, we turned to Kickstarter since it was kind of...

471
00:25:29,591 --> 00:25:31,731
It was not quite as well known back then.

472
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:32,831
It was...

473
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:36,132
We launched about a week after Double Fine's...

474
00:25:37,252 --> 00:25:39,412
Double Fine Adventure game, and

475
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:43,113
we had just known it from friends who had done, like, film projects

476
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:45,213
or starting a farm and that sort of thing.

477
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:49,507
And Double Fine just drove thousands to Kickstarter.

478
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:52,530
And we were lucky enough to be sitting there with a game

479
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,091
that people thought was kind of cool.

480
00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:56,934
And we ended up with 20 times the 10K

481
00:25:56,954 --> 00:25:58,195
that we needed to finish the game.

482
00:25:59,035 --> 00:26:01,478
And it was about 10,000 backers that did that.

483
00:26:02,058 --> 00:26:05,141
And it really influenced the game for the better.

484
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:07,022
But it also caused a few extra stresses

485
00:26:07,063 --> 00:26:08,864
that we might not have known going into it.

486
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:13,907
the first thing I want to talk about is how that having 10,000 people watching

487
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:19,731
us changed the game. And we were very used to being able to cut and move

488
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:23,293
around very agile by ourselves in our cave without really worrying about what

489
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:26,735
other people thought. But when we had this giant audience come that kind of

490
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:31,458
changed everything. We had overnight fans like talking about our game which was

491
00:26:31,498 --> 00:26:34,480
really cool and really weird that there are these other people that were just

492
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,181
as excited about this game as we were.

493
00:26:36,982 --> 00:26:38,903
And so it really drove the motivation,

494
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:41,204
but at the same time it was this immense pressure.

495
00:26:41,765 --> 00:26:42,765
There was only two of us,

496
00:26:43,046 --> 00:26:45,287
and people put their faith and their money into our hands,

497
00:26:45,507 --> 00:26:47,108
and it was absolutely terrifying,

498
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,929
and many sleepless nights knowing

499
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:51,030
that we had to create this product

500
00:26:51,091 --> 00:26:52,131
to make these people happy.

501
00:26:54,141 --> 00:26:55,823
The expectations of course varied.

502
00:26:55,843 --> 00:26:58,465
It was difficult sometimes to balance it,

503
00:26:58,525 --> 00:27:00,827
as you'd expect, 10,000 people have different thoughts.

504
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,371
But we took the time to talk to everyone that we could.

505
00:27:04,411 --> 00:27:06,413
Anytime we got a question posted to our forum

506
00:27:06,473 --> 00:27:08,695
or emailed to us, we took it very seriously

507
00:27:08,715 --> 00:27:11,197
and answered it and tried to talk through it.

508
00:27:11,317 --> 00:27:12,759
And that really helped us as well

509
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,861
in just kind of explaining our own thought process.

510
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,503
Even if the idea were like, that's not at all what we want,

511
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:19,785
but I've never really had to explain why

512
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:20,846
that's not at all what I want,

513
00:27:21,227 --> 00:27:23,529
and so it was fun to have to verbalize it

514
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:25,110
and really structure the game in that manner.

515
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,073
One of the biggest things that was difficult for us

516
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,795
with the Kickstarter was that we had these list of things

517
00:27:30,835 --> 00:27:31,916
we said we'd put in the game.

518
00:27:32,457 --> 00:27:35,100
We put it up there as, of course, these would be fun.

519
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,603
Stuff like the aliens and ship customization.

520
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:40,828
This idea that you would, when you start your game,

521
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,811
instead of choosing a ship, you'd have more of a shell.

522
00:27:44,012 --> 00:27:46,355
And you'd add weapons to it and add systems to it

523
00:27:46,735 --> 00:27:49,158
and kind of min-max what you want for your ship.

524
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:55,584
It sounded fun on paper, and it's still something we get requests for literally every day.

525
00:27:57,165 --> 00:28:00,388
And they, once we got it in the game though, it didn't really work.

526
00:28:00,808 --> 00:28:04,251
And it just, it wasn't as fun, there weren't that many options.

527
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:07,394
When you have every option in front of you, it kind of muddies the options that are actually

528
00:28:07,414 --> 00:28:07,854
available.

529
00:28:08,275 --> 00:28:10,797
And there was an obvious choice and a less obvious choice.

530
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:17,882
we were ready to cut it immediately, but because we had 10,000 people who expected it in the game,

531
00:28:18,262 --> 00:28:22,044
we were very worried about cutting it prematurely, because it was something that they might want.

532
00:28:22,605 --> 00:28:26,607
And so we put on probably another week or two of development time and balance time,

533
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:29,469
trying to see if there was a way to crack this nut and make it work.

534
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:34,252
And it's hard to say the time was wasted, but at the same time, it was a little bit wasted.

535
00:28:34,272 --> 00:28:36,553
We had a lot of stuff to do before we could release the game,

536
00:28:37,034 --> 00:28:39,515
and we spent more time than we should have on ship customization.

537
00:28:39,735 --> 00:28:43,200
especially considering the fact that we had also promised for a release date

538
00:28:43,941 --> 00:28:47,707
which was not too far away. So like every week was super important

539
00:28:48,408 --> 00:28:52,173
during that period. Our release date, we finished the Kickstarter in April

540
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:54,917
and the release date was supposed to be in August.

541
00:28:55,818 --> 00:29:03,066
That's largely because we also thought, you know, we would just get around $10,000, maybe a bit more if we were lucky,

542
00:29:03,506 --> 00:29:09,532
and that we would just work with our small focus for the game, which was considerably smaller than the final game,

543
00:29:09,572 --> 00:29:11,314
and then so that leads us to...

544
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,877
Which leads us to how the money actually changed things.

545
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:15,478
The extra...

546
00:29:16,745 --> 00:29:20,206
twenty times what we needed to kind of do the vision we wanted for the game

547
00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:25,388
was awesome and it let us really think about the bigger content of what we

548
00:29:25,428 --> 00:29:28,989
could do. But it's also really difficult because you have a game and you have a vision

549
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:29,509
for a game

550
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:34,051
and the scope of the game and it's kind of complete in your mind, the design is there

551
00:29:34,671 --> 00:29:38,032
and just because you have some extra money doesn't necessarily mean

552
00:29:38,552 --> 00:29:41,973
you can improve the game. It just doesn't necessarily work that way. You can't just

553
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:43,374
throw money at something and it gets better.

554
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,176
A common request would be something like multiplayer,

555
00:29:47,756 --> 00:29:49,197
for co-op or competitive.

556
00:29:49,937 --> 00:29:51,839
It's just we never saw it in the game

557
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:53,560
and we still don't think it would fit in the game,

558
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,262
but it's something that people kind of think about

559
00:29:56,322 --> 00:29:58,303
when you have extra funds and maybe you could fit it in now

560
00:29:58,323 --> 00:29:59,264
because you have more time

561
00:29:59,324 --> 00:30:00,445
and you could hire people to do it.

562
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:08,796
Just for some perspective, our Kickstarter was also before the whole Stretch Goals was a standard as it was now.

563
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:14,741
So we had zero plan for previously for what we would do if we would reach X amount of money.

564
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:15,842
So we hadn't even thought about it.

565
00:30:16,122 --> 00:30:18,564
The idea that that could even happen was beyond us.

566
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:21,306
We thought 10,000 would be kind of eeked out.

567
00:30:21,626 --> 00:30:23,968
We didn't think that 200,000 would come rolling our way.

568
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:28,594
And so we had this difficult balancing act of how do we improve the game?

569
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:31,859
How do we take advantage of this awesome new clump of resources?

570
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:35,524
But at the same time, how do we hit our release date and keep everyone happy?

571
00:30:36,025 --> 00:30:40,170
And so the easiest way to do that was to kind of improve or...

572
00:30:40,711 --> 00:30:45,034
double the content that we already planned that fit into the pre-existing design.

573
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:47,836
And so some of it was aesthetic, stuff like the music.

574
00:30:48,236 --> 00:30:50,137
The soundtrack is absolutely brilliant.

575
00:30:50,778 --> 00:30:54,360
We could have gotten by without it, but we all know that the game wouldn't be as good without it.

576
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,781
And without Ben, we wouldn't...

577
00:30:57,742 --> 00:31:01,705
He was able to devote a lot more time, because we could pay him a lot better.

578
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,526
And so you could stop working full-time.

579
00:31:05,518 --> 00:31:08,360
He was generous enough to work pretty much for free up until this moment, and so

580
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,882
throwing funds his way let him stop working full-time and put a lot more

581
00:31:12,902 --> 00:31:16,184
time into the soundtrack, which ended up really awesome. It's something that people

582
00:31:16,204 --> 00:31:17,045
love and we love.

583
00:31:17,885 --> 00:31:20,566
One of the things I'm most proud about coming out of the game is that we helped

584
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:22,527
make this awesome thing of music come out too.

585
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:28,310
And similarly, we were able to contract out an extra writer to expand the events.

586
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:33,632
As we were going further into the game, we realized that the text-based events were extremely

587
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:38,995
difficult, more difficult than we expected to kind of get out and keep the variety up.

588
00:31:39,215 --> 00:31:42,877
We thought, mistakenly, that there was some, it's just text, you just write a few more

589
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:45,758
and then you have a lot, and then there's a lot of variety in the game.

590
00:31:45,818 --> 00:31:46,598
How hard can that be?

591
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,642
But it's amazing how many words we needed.

592
00:31:49,762 --> 00:31:53,588
Even something like 15,000 when we brought on the writer

593
00:31:53,908 --> 00:31:55,971
wasn't anywhere near enough words in the game

594
00:31:55,992 --> 00:31:57,434
to create the variety that we needed.

595
00:31:57,954 --> 00:31:59,997
And so with the extra money, we were able to get the guy.

596
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,441
Shubair from in England to help us out and really expand the game greatly which

597
00:32:06,481 --> 00:32:10,542
was awesome. He also helped us expand kind of our alien and ship world in

598
00:32:10,582 --> 00:32:14,283
general and that he gave a lot more backstory and a lot more we just had

599
00:32:14,523 --> 00:32:18,685
little sprites that had no purpose. They were created for game design reasons

600
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:22,806
like we thought it would be cool if an alien could power a system and that was

601
00:32:22,846 --> 00:32:26,987
the extent of why that alien existed and the writer really helped us flesh it out

602
00:32:27,027 --> 00:32:29,047
into something that mattered and changed the game.

603
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:36,654
So about two months after the Kickstarter,

604
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:38,535
we were ready to launch our beta.

605
00:32:38,895 --> 00:32:40,977
The beta was for 3,000 beta players

606
00:32:42,057 --> 00:32:45,119
that paid about $25 to get into that private closed beta.

607
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:47,960
At that point, we thought the game was actually,

608
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,101
I finally felt the game was really coming together.

609
00:32:50,141 --> 00:32:52,303
We had every layer on, and it was a lot of fun.

610
00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:55,724
The only big problem was that there wasn't a lot

611
00:32:55,764 --> 00:32:56,885
of replay value.

612
00:32:56,985 --> 00:32:58,066
There wasn't a lot of reason,

613
00:32:58,166 --> 00:32:59,386
other than finding new events,

614
00:32:59,726 --> 00:33:01,788
which as I just said, we were having troubles filling out,

615
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,068
to come back and play.

616
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:05,552
And so we needed stuff like the ship unlocks

617
00:33:05,612 --> 00:33:07,495
and the achievements and the things we would add

618
00:33:07,556 --> 00:33:09,799
that would help drive people to come back.

619
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,123
And we were hoping that during the beta,

620
00:33:12,163 --> 00:33:14,207
we could figure out what made people play the game

621
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:16,611
and then kind of capitalize on that.

622
00:33:19,985 --> 00:33:22,225
So since there were the 3,000 players that paid $25,

623
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:25,426
and more than anybody else has paid for FTL,

624
00:33:25,846 --> 00:33:27,607
these were our most hardcore fans.

625
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:30,367
These were people that loved games like FTL

626
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:31,788
and wanted games like FTL.

627
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:35,029
We had already started with a game being very difficult.

628
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:36,249
As we talked about in the beginning,

629
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:38,309
it was intended to be something that was challenging.

630
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:41,110
It was harder going into the beta.

631
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,551
We did reduce the difficulty,

632
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:45,871
but we reduced it down to a level for players that...

633
00:33:47,051 --> 00:33:49,313
love that type of game and are good at that type of game.

634
00:33:49,693 --> 00:33:53,175
So that's why we still ended up with the difficulty that FTL is known for.

635
00:33:54,096 --> 00:33:56,557
We feel that balancing to that group,

636
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,859
the group that plays it for 300 hours,

637
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,762
was a good idea. The game was taken off because of that difficulty.

638
00:34:04,123 --> 00:34:07,105
The people that love it really appreciate that it's tailored to that

639
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:08,445
type of experience.

640
00:34:09,246 --> 00:34:11,227
And it also helps that replayability issue.

641
00:34:11,888 --> 00:34:14,009
If the game was too easy, then you beat it,

642
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:14,990
and then you're done.

643
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,891
And if you beat it every time, there's

644
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:17,892
not a lot of interest there.

645
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:20,294
But getting your ass kicked every time you played

646
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,195
actually kind of drove you back to play it more.

647
00:34:22,575 --> 00:34:24,597
And so it got that replayability that we needed.

648
00:34:25,738 --> 00:34:28,860
For example, the easy mode was added.

649
00:34:31,006 --> 00:34:34,127
a few weeks before release or something, like a month before release.

650
00:34:34,247 --> 00:34:38,528
And so, like, that's why, you know, that's why it's labeled easy versus normal,

651
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:42,228
because normal, as opposed to being absurdly difficult mode,

652
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:45,929
but that was the experience that we were actually trying to create for people.

653
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:48,530
Because we wanted to make a game that we ourselves would enjoy.

654
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,450
That was the highest goal early on.

655
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,151
Yeah, not all 3,000 of them loved the difficulty, I guess.

656
00:34:54,211 --> 00:34:56,171
There were a few that wanted it slightly easier.

657
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:58,673
They were also very effective.

658
00:34:58,713 --> 00:35:00,814
I mean, anything out of a beta that you'd hope to get

659
00:35:01,054 --> 00:35:02,735
is effective bug hunting and feedback.

660
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:04,936
And these guys were awesome for that as well.

661
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:06,997
What was interesting going into the beta

662
00:35:07,177 --> 00:35:09,838
is that we had a lot of these visual effects

663
00:35:10,098 --> 00:35:11,759
that we had put into the game very early

664
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,040
that we weren't sure about.

665
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,801
The stuff like that jump animation that was made.

666
00:35:16,662 --> 00:35:17,643
eighteen months ago now

667
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:21,627
that was put into the game in an hour to just we need a jump animation let's get

668
00:35:21,947 --> 00:35:22,888
let's get that in

669
00:35:23,428 --> 00:35:25,070
we always intended to go back and change it

670
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:29,514
and the same idea that we had about five backgrounds and half a dozen planets

671
00:35:29,955 --> 00:35:32,797
and that was all we had in the game and we always assumed that that's all part of

672
00:35:32,817 --> 00:35:35,180
the visual polish we do leading up to release

673
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,312
but it's something that nobody mentioned during the beta.

674
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:41,213
There were tons of complaints and issues and feedback

675
00:35:41,233 --> 00:35:43,375
that we got, but not one of them had anything

676
00:35:43,395 --> 00:35:46,076
to do with our really crappy jump animation.

677
00:35:46,556 --> 00:35:48,598
And so that animation's still in the game.

678
00:35:50,919 --> 00:35:52,420
All that stuff kind of fell to the back burner.

679
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,801
There was no reason to do it, we felt,

680
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:55,061
because that's not what players wanted.

681
00:35:55,462 --> 00:35:58,103
what players were talking about, it was the gameplay.

682
00:35:58,463 --> 00:36:00,404
It was more content, it was more balancing,

683
00:36:00,444 --> 00:36:02,645
it was the stuff that they were really latching onto

684
00:36:02,685 --> 00:36:04,946
that mattered, and so we pretty much forgot about that,

685
00:36:04,986 --> 00:36:06,546
threw it out the window and focused on that.

686
00:36:06,986 --> 00:36:09,488
Yeah, or the fact that the only ship

687
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:12,289
that actually has thrusters that do anything

688
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:13,069
is the Kestrel.

689
00:36:13,669 --> 00:36:15,870
No one has ever mentioned that to us either, yeah.

690
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:23,591
As a result, though, you can cater a little bit too much to this group of hardcore players.

691
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:29,013
And one of them, as we talked about, as I just said, the gameplay that we were expanding,

692
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:30,953
kind of started to lean on feature creep.

693
00:36:31,393 --> 00:36:36,154
We had, at this point, the bombs and the iron weapons and a lot of different types of weapons,

694
00:36:36,634 --> 00:36:41,535
but it was so many types of weapons that we still envisioned, and if we had piled those

695
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:46,517
into the game, any new player, or even medium player, wouldn't figure anything out.

696
00:36:47,097 --> 00:36:48,957
Am I a roguelike-snatcher?

697
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:53,018
everything's open from the beginning. It's just there it is when you start the

698
00:36:53,058 --> 00:36:57,199
game and we didn't want to overwhelm it with this top-heavy advanced gameplay

699
00:36:57,259 --> 00:37:03,020
which is what the new weapons would be. Naturally they lead to tiny small places

700
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,440
you'd need it for, little strategic holes that we wanted to plug in the gameplay

701
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:10,161
but it was just not necessary and it would make the game bloated and we were

702
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:13,482
warned by some of our play tester friends as well that we needed to just

703
00:37:13,802 --> 00:37:16,842
leave it the way it was and and make sure it was just balanced.

704
00:37:19,346 --> 00:37:21,889
One thing that happened from it was in the very beginning,

705
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:25,674
we made it very simple decision for how to unlock player ships.

706
00:37:26,255 --> 00:37:27,736
If you've played the game, there's

707
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:30,800
events that you randomly come across.

708
00:37:31,181 --> 00:37:32,422
That if you have certain equipment,

709
00:37:32,442 --> 00:37:34,204
like you have your engines and your med bay

710
00:37:34,244 --> 00:37:34,945
and your teleporter.

711
00:37:35,325 --> 00:37:36,526
then you can unlock a player ship.

712
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:40,108
And the event plays through into the level story,

713
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:42,690
and you can kind of figure out what you need based

714
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,531
on what happens in the story.

715
00:37:44,571 --> 00:37:45,631
Like, oh no, he died.

716
00:37:46,172 --> 00:37:47,652
If only we had a better med bay.

717
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:50,274
It's not that obvious, but enough to kind of make

718
00:37:50,294 --> 00:37:50,954
you figure it out.

719
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:52,715
And it was more of a quick solution

720
00:37:52,755 --> 00:37:54,656
so we could get it out the door to the beta players

721
00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:56,617
and figure out something from there.

722
00:37:56,998 --> 00:37:58,258
But the beta players really liked it.

723
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:03,215
They thought it was a lot of fun to discuss the puzzle of how to unlock the ships.

724
00:38:03,555 --> 00:38:07,441
Our forum had long threads of people really talking about all the different ways they

725
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:09,383
might be able to do it and kind of solve this puzzle.

726
00:38:09,724 --> 00:38:12,688
And so we thought that was really cool and they were enjoying it and so we kept it in

727
00:38:12,728 --> 00:38:13,809
the game and we made all the...

728
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:18,492
ship unlocks like that. But once the game came out and it stopped being this

729
00:38:18,552 --> 00:38:22,413
very small audience of people solving the problems it just became a list of

730
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:26,295
things you had to do. People just can google the list of everything you need

731
00:38:26,335 --> 00:38:29,776
there's no more discussion and it becomes a waiting game of just hoping

732
00:38:29,836 --> 00:38:33,118
that the random universe will give you what you need to unlock the ship and

733
00:38:33,158 --> 00:38:38,420
it's one of the most common complaints and it kind of fell out of the the beta

734
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,521
appearing that it was fun but in the actual open world it wasn't.

735
00:38:45,474 --> 00:38:53,336
So, as we neared the release, we realized we really just had to focus on a single focused game.

736
00:38:53,436 --> 00:38:56,477
So, like Matt was saying, we really just needed to stop adding stuff.

737
00:38:56,517 --> 00:39:03,439
We really needed to find out what is a good, you know, structured system that has enough events.

738
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,301
enough variety, enough weapons, enough things you could learn

739
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:10,824
as you play the game, and enough skill caps and all that kind of stuff.

740
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:15,908
And so, part of that, as you can see in this image, like this is in the final game even,

741
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:20,171
that super clean, simple power bar, which represented a lot of things,

742
00:39:20,511 --> 00:39:24,794
became ridiculously bloated, and there's a lot of information being conveyed,

743
00:39:25,274 --> 00:39:28,697
so that could be, like Matt was saying, really terrifying to new players and that sort of thing.

744
00:39:28,797 --> 00:39:30,578
Or old players. I mean, look at this, so...

745
00:39:31,558 --> 00:39:34,259
The poor power bars, we just piled onto them.

746
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:34,779
Yeah.

747
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,820
But that was because we were trying desperately

748
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,220
to have everything in one game screen.

749
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,381
And if we added more things that were requested,

750
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:44,462
or even planned, like hacking systems,

751
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:49,123
or various things that could really

752
00:39:49,163 --> 00:39:50,403
make it feel quite bloated.

753
00:39:50,463 --> 00:39:53,824
So we knew in this time that we really just

754
00:39:53,864 --> 00:39:56,685
wanted to have a good, coherent, solid game, release it,

755
00:39:56,745 --> 00:39:57,825
and there you go.

756
00:39:57,865 --> 00:39:58,385
There's our game.

757
00:39:59,686 --> 00:40:06,512
So, just some of the ideas that got cut that we had really wanted to be in the game, or the sort of like...

758
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,452
In the same way that you have the asteroid field as a special environment,

759
00:40:10,472 --> 00:40:13,174
you have these special encounters, such as cloaked saboteurs,

760
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:14,735
who would wander around your ship,

761
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:17,397
and you'd need to have a person in that room to be able to see them,

762
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:20,399
and they'd lay bombs, and they would destroy parts of your ship,

763
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:22,960
and you'd need to find them, or have a slug guy to help you out.

764
00:40:24,281 --> 00:40:27,223
Various monsters, like an aliens monster, an egg that hatched,

765
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:29,325
or would infect crew members, or spread,

766
00:40:29,685 --> 00:40:32,307
and become a disaster aboard your ship, potentially killing everybody.

767
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:35,209
I really liked the energy-based...

768
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:40,151
entity which would wander around and suck out energy from your reactor and that kind of thing.

769
00:40:40,191 --> 00:40:44,013
The sad part is all of these I still think would be awesome and I would love to have in the game

770
00:40:44,373 --> 00:40:48,615
but at the same time just because it would be good doesn't necessarily mean it would improve

771
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:53,657
the game. In the end we felt like it wasn't even cutting features because it would make it because

772
00:40:53,697 --> 00:40:58,699
it would be not fun, it was cutting features because it was good the way it was. Why poke

773
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:02,201
the deck of cards or the the house of cards if you don't need to and...

774
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:08,538
that it's sad. It really was precarious. To look at some of these but we know that it was the right decision to keep them out.

775
00:41:08,938 --> 00:41:10,759
The other things like gas-based weaponry

776
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,261
like uh... kind of like bombs that would explode in the room and then

777
00:41:14,661 --> 00:41:18,203
gas would spread out based on how doors would be opened and it could do various

778
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:19,744
things like knockout crew members or

779
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:20,945
heal them or

780
00:41:20,965 --> 00:41:23,606
uh... damage systems, ink, stuff like that.

781
00:41:24,287 --> 00:41:27,288
something else that we always initially dreamed was being able to

782
00:41:28,429 --> 00:41:33,751
go to a station, kind of like Starcraft, and be separate from your ship and have certain systems

783
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:39,354
maybe that would be helpful for station boarding as your crew members are trying to rescue a VIP

784
00:41:39,814 --> 00:41:44,936
from inside a prison facility or something like that. And so there's a link at the end,

785
00:41:44,976 --> 00:41:50,839
but we actually put this slide online in addition to a document which has Matt's original

786
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:53,420
kind of stream of consciousness.

787
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:59,745
idea for the game as well as just this giant laundry list of features that we wanted and we didn't get to add.

788
00:42:02,874 --> 00:42:06,756
So, but in the end, we had to come to the release date.

789
00:42:06,836 --> 00:42:10,339
And we were able to get a game that we were happy with,

790
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:13,521
released September last year.

791
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:16,163
And we released it on Windows, Mac, and Linux,

792
00:42:16,263 --> 00:42:19,805
which had its own slew of problems and difficulties,

793
00:42:20,126 --> 00:42:23,908
which we don't really suggest new developers to do three

794
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,430
operating systems for their first game.

795
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,451
But it worked out in the end.

796
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:34,995
And it was especially interesting to us because we had never intended for this to be a commercial product.

797
00:42:35,075 --> 00:42:39,201
It was just this weird flurry of growing interest.

798
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:43,567
And so to be able to release the game was amazing,

799
00:42:43,587 --> 00:42:45,991
especially since there were so many situations where we just felt up.

800
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:50,714
I've got to scrap this, go find a job, go do something else.

801
00:42:50,934 --> 00:42:54,397
And I also have to thank this community,

802
00:42:54,497 --> 00:42:57,539
because about two years ago I was here.

803
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,521
I went to the IGF, all the indie game talks,

804
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:03,623
and I was really inspired.

805
00:43:03,683 --> 00:43:05,784
And I knew from that point on that I

806
00:43:05,824 --> 00:43:06,845
wanted to make indie games.

807
00:43:06,925 --> 00:43:07,425
I just knew it.

808
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,207
And then that convinced me to quit my job,

809
00:43:10,267 --> 00:43:12,008
and luckily I was able to work with Matt.

810
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:14,910
to be able to do this, and then two years later,

811
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:18,552
I'm coming here and showing off our game, which is crazy to us,

812
00:43:18,713 --> 00:43:22,515
and potentially and hopefully could inspire some of you

813
00:43:22,595 --> 00:43:25,497
out there to make something awesome.

814
00:43:25,517 --> 00:43:28,099
Although I'm not encouraging you all to quit your jobs.

815
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:29,940
Yeah.

816
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,002
We're a good example that you don't necessarily

817
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,123
have to know what you're doing to stumble upon something

818
00:43:34,143 --> 00:43:34,643
kind of cool.

819
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:37,777
So, thank you to everybody who helped us

820
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:40,282
and our family and friends to keep us sane.

821
00:43:40,823 --> 00:43:42,426
And thank you to everybody else.

822
00:43:42,446 --> 00:43:43,929
We probably ran a little fast here,

823
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:47,055
but we'd be excited to answer anyone's questions

824
00:43:47,115 --> 00:43:48,057
for as long as you'd like.

825
00:44:02,842 --> 00:44:03,342
Hi guys.

826
00:44:03,883 --> 00:44:05,524
Firstly, just a great game.

827
00:44:06,064 --> 00:44:08,085
My sons and I have put many hours into it,

828
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:09,886
and they've unlocked everything in the game.

829
00:44:10,306 --> 00:44:10,966
It's great.

830
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:13,268
Now obviously, the randomness of the game

831
00:44:13,408 --> 00:44:15,068
can be a bit punishing at times.

832
00:44:16,729 --> 00:44:18,990
But as you said, it makes you come back to the game.

833
00:44:19,571 --> 00:44:24,693
Did you try to solve the negative feedback loops that

834
00:44:24,713 --> 00:44:28,615
can occur when you get damaged, you have to spend money

835
00:44:28,675 --> 00:44:29,756
repairing your ship?

836
00:44:30,274 --> 00:44:33,200
and then you can't spend the money to upgrade your ship and then eventually

837
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:36,648
you know you just have to quit the game and start again

838
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:39,314
or did you sort of think players would just do that?

839
00:44:40,227 --> 00:44:44,068
I mean, I personally, I really like that that is in the game.

840
00:44:44,288 --> 00:44:47,388
And I do think it's a sort of different type of person who

841
00:44:47,408 --> 00:44:49,869
would get in a situation like that and be like, oh, quit,

842
00:44:49,929 --> 00:44:50,269
restart.

843
00:44:50,769 --> 00:44:53,330
And as opposed to us, who would be playing that,

844
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,870
and you get in that awful situation,

845
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:57,191
you barely scrape through, and then you keep going,

846
00:44:57,231 --> 00:45:00,232
and now it's a considerably more intense experience.

847
00:45:00,252 --> 00:45:01,272
You now have one crew member.

848
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,832
And I love that that's in the game,

849
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:05,253
even if it isn't ideal for some people.

850
00:45:08,154 --> 00:45:13,658
At the same time, there is a slight balancing for it, and the scrap increase through the sectors is actually very high.

851
00:45:14,018 --> 00:45:18,622
By the time you get to that last sector, or the seventh sector, you're getting so much money,

852
00:45:18,722 --> 00:45:22,424
you'd be amazed how much you can buy last minute, right before getting to the box.

853
00:45:22,805 --> 00:45:28,089
So the quitters don't win in the end, you've got to kind of stick at it and get to the last level.

854
00:45:28,661 --> 00:45:30,382
I mean, if you don't enjoy that, you don't have to.

855
00:45:31,063 --> 00:45:31,723
Some people do.

856
00:45:32,344 --> 00:45:34,045
Like other people I hear, they just

857
00:45:34,145 --> 00:45:36,327
replay the first sector until they find weapons.

858
00:45:36,407 --> 00:45:38,849
And if that's the way you want to play, go for it.

859
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:39,809
Thanks.

860
00:45:40,049 --> 00:45:41,210
Go for it.

861
00:45:41,631 --> 00:45:44,753
So like you said, one of the biggest complaints

862
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,574
is the locked ships and everything.

863
00:45:47,515 --> 00:45:48,776
Have you guys thought about a way

864
00:45:48,856 --> 00:45:51,518
to deal with that now as an update,

865
00:45:51,738 --> 00:45:56,081
or maybe even allow people to purchase them just for cash?

866
00:45:57,048 --> 00:45:57,828
Well, we will never do...

867
00:45:57,848 --> 00:45:58,749
We never can do that.

868
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:00,789
Oh yeah, we will never do any form of...

869
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:07,392
Just largely because, like, the same way we wanted, you know, we were making a game that

870
00:46:07,412 --> 00:46:09,933
we wanted to play, we wouldn't particularly enjoy that.

871
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:19,003
It's a little bit of an odd situation because we really did want to move on to a next project.

872
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:23,905
And even now we're still working on the various things that are associated with the game as well.

873
00:46:24,485 --> 00:46:30,409
It's maybe possible to be able to do small updates, but it really wasn't something we were planning to do.

874
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:32,830
It was just keep adding things to the game because it could just...

875
00:46:33,722 --> 00:46:36,224
I don't know, it could ruin the experience that we were shooting for.

876
00:46:36,284 --> 00:46:37,845
It's kind of that house of cards thing.

877
00:46:37,865 --> 00:46:41,427
I'd be worried about tipping anything and making a decision that would actually make it worse.

878
00:46:41,907 --> 00:46:43,649
I think it is functional the way it is.

879
00:46:44,109 --> 00:46:49,953
And if I had to go back, I might say more stuff like the layout B unlocks,

880
00:46:50,093 --> 00:46:52,394
where it's kind of gameplay based and achievement based.

881
00:46:53,855 --> 00:46:57,917
But I think that it if anything I would probably just want to reduce the randomness

882
00:46:57,937 --> 00:47:03,000
But keep the same style because it's kind of fun to unlock it through the event and it's kind of a story that you help

883
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,941
This race and that's why you get the ship. There's still elements of it

884
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:12,344
We like it's just stuff like the crystal the crystal ship that is just purely a exercise in randomness is excessive

885
00:47:12,404 --> 00:47:17,967
I would rather remove the randomness than remove the design entirely

886
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:19,308
Over there, okay

887
00:47:20,808 --> 00:47:26,954
As you stated that you're a team of one programmer and one artist who kind of shared the design,

888
00:47:27,615 --> 00:47:31,398
sounded like 50-50, did you have any major creative differences

889
00:47:31,759 --> 00:47:34,461
as you went through the project and how did you address them?

890
00:47:34,973 --> 00:47:41,156
We were pretty lucky in that this sort of same focal point for the game, we kind of both

891
00:47:42,197 --> 00:47:46,199
intrinsically had the same image, even though we weren't able to describe it to other people,

892
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:51,061
like we wouldn't be able to explain the game. So we got really lucky that we just for some reason

893
00:47:51,081 --> 00:47:55,663
had a click like that. In terms of design... Nothing major, small stuff.

894
00:47:55,883 --> 00:47:58,284
just small details, we would definitely get in fights

895
00:47:58,344 --> 00:48:01,226
about small details, but nothing, yeah,

896
00:48:01,266 --> 00:48:02,587
the major direction of the project

897
00:48:02,607 --> 00:48:04,268
was always very singular and focused.

898
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,329
Impressively so, still doesn't make any sense to me.

899
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:08,631
So you're always able to kind of come back to that

900
00:48:08,691 --> 00:48:11,873
and say, well, what serves the vision best?

901
00:48:12,834 --> 00:48:14,114
What serves the vision of?

902
00:48:15,295 --> 00:48:17,597
I'm just saying that you were able to come back to that

903
00:48:17,677 --> 00:48:19,738
and just kind of ask what serves the vision best

904
00:48:20,238 --> 00:48:21,339
to resolve those things.

905
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:22,820
Yeah, yeah, I just made a comment.

906
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,381
Cool, thanks.

907
00:48:25,399 --> 00:48:28,623
I think when people talk about your game and they're trying to describe it in a hurry,

908
00:48:28,663 --> 00:48:31,666
I often hear them describe it as a roguelike in space.

909
00:48:32,447 --> 00:48:33,828
And it does have roguelike elements.

910
00:48:34,288 --> 00:48:38,853
I didn't see you mention permadeath or any of these specific elements in your initial

911
00:48:39,634 --> 00:48:40,575
kind of grand division.

912
00:48:40,635 --> 00:48:44,399
Was that something you just kind of wandered into or did you always want permadeath to

913
00:48:44,419 --> 00:48:44,960
be part of the game?

914
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,984
That actually, while it wasn't explicitly said in that initial vision, and if you go

915
00:48:49,004 --> 00:48:53,209
read that vision it's not there, there's another document, I don't know if we put it up, that

916
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:57,053
has five gameplay elements that I thought were really cool in games.

917
00:48:57,654 --> 00:48:59,676
And one of those five was permadeath.

918
00:49:00,077 --> 00:49:01,698
Permadeath was intended from the beginning.

919
00:49:01,818 --> 00:49:03,560
I think that having that...

920
00:49:05,563 --> 00:49:05,783
Basically.

921
00:49:05,903 --> 00:49:07,164
Actual, like your decisions mattered.

922
00:49:07,184 --> 00:49:08,966
It was so vital, especially for being

923
00:49:09,006 --> 00:49:10,567
the captain of the starship.

924
00:49:10,687 --> 00:49:12,469
Like, I wanted, when you're making

925
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:14,710
the decision for your crew, that that decision mattered.

926
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,732
That there was depth to it, and you were stressed about it.

927
00:49:16,752 --> 00:49:18,554
And you wanted to be in the shoes of that captain.

928
00:49:18,874 --> 00:49:20,515
And without permadeath, you don't have that.

929
00:49:20,915 --> 00:49:24,318
And so the consequences of your game play and your actions

930
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:26,280
is something that I really enjoy,

931
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,161
and I always, and we both really enjoy.

932
00:49:28,502 --> 00:49:30,003
And so we always wanted and intended

933
00:49:30,023 --> 00:49:31,084
to have in the game from day one.

934
00:49:31,364 --> 00:49:32,605
It definitely works in this game.

935
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:33,246
Yeah, thank you.

936
00:49:34,746 --> 00:49:35,787
Awesome game, huge fan.

937
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:37,408
So at the beginning of the talk, you

938
00:49:37,448 --> 00:49:39,729
talked about how you're reducing the pitch down

939
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:40,830
to the core concept.

940
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,631
If you were to, since you guys are working on your second

941
00:49:43,671 --> 00:49:46,413
project now, or going to be sometime or something,

942
00:49:46,473 --> 00:49:48,714
who knows, something's going to happen, we hope.

943
00:49:50,295 --> 00:49:52,397
Would you do the same thing again?

944
00:49:52,437 --> 00:49:54,198
Would you modify that process in any way?

945
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:04,625
I mean, I have a few various ideas that we've discussed for what potentially could be another project.

946
00:50:05,066 --> 00:50:09,070
Some of them involve more, like, I want this type of gameplay structure, and some are more...

947
00:50:11,365 --> 00:50:13,527
just the sort of experience, but I do think that that,

948
00:50:14,668 --> 00:50:16,049
even just thinking about it now, yeah,

949
00:50:16,269 --> 00:50:17,750
like pretty much always we're just,

950
00:50:18,251 --> 00:50:19,552
I at least am trying to find,

951
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,014
what do we want the player to feel like

952
00:50:22,094 --> 00:50:23,335
when he's playing this game, and that,

953
00:50:23,735 --> 00:50:25,817
that, cause probably, I wouldn't be surprised

954
00:50:25,837 --> 00:50:27,438
if we also just started cutting things

955
00:50:27,478 --> 00:50:31,222
that didn't fit into that experiential feeling, so yeah.

956
00:50:31,342 --> 00:50:33,903
And as a programmer first, I probably

957
00:50:34,263 --> 00:50:35,743
lean towards just diving into it,

958
00:50:36,123 --> 00:50:37,884
getting things working and moving and tinkering,

959
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:40,345
because the code is just as related to the design

960
00:50:40,485 --> 00:50:41,346
as the design is.

961
00:50:41,626 --> 00:50:44,687
So I think that just go for it and move forward

962
00:50:44,867 --> 00:50:47,348
on this kind of core random idea is definitely

963
00:50:47,388 --> 00:50:49,049
how I would still want to approach it.

964
00:50:49,209 --> 00:50:52,270
Yeah, we probably still wouldn't make some sort of project

965
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:54,491
where we have global design documents

966
00:50:54,511 --> 00:50:56,872
for every single aspect of the game and then try and make that.

967
00:50:57,572 --> 00:50:59,213
I couldn't picture even trying that.

968
00:51:00,262 --> 00:51:01,302
Yeah, thank you.

969
00:51:01,802 --> 00:51:05,963
Hey, as a fan of FTL, I'm really glad that the process kind of worked out to produce

970
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:10,785
what it did, but there's probably countless anecdotes about how the process of just sort

971
00:51:10,805 --> 00:51:14,146
of, we have an idea and we're just going to kind of attach features as we go, could go

972
00:51:14,286 --> 00:51:15,346
horribly, horribly wrong.

973
00:51:16,626 --> 00:51:20,607
What process did you use to kind of prioritize and vet out which features you would work

974
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:25,989
on first or develop first, and then kind of where the line was of what went in the game

975
00:51:26,009 --> 00:51:26,409
and what didn't?

976
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:30,492
It was never anything particularly formal.

977
00:51:30,512 --> 00:51:34,035
I think that it kind of what we covered in the first half

978
00:51:34,095 --> 00:51:36,778
with this idea that if it served that core feeling,

979
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:38,860
it would work.

980
00:51:40,081 --> 00:51:40,682
There wasn't...

981
00:51:40,882 --> 00:51:42,523
In terms of like specific features

982
00:51:42,564 --> 00:51:45,346
that would still all fit within that feeling,

983
00:51:47,128 --> 00:51:48,069
I guess just a whim,

984
00:51:48,469 --> 00:51:50,511
just like what we felt like at the time maybe.

985
00:51:50,551 --> 00:51:51,612
Which isn't helpful, I know.

986
00:51:52,945 --> 00:51:57,027
Just like, well, you know, I really feel like there should be some weapon that can counter

987
00:51:57,387 --> 00:52:04,731
shields and the defense drone, aka bombs, you know. So, like, just playing the game a lot,

988
00:52:05,171 --> 00:52:07,933
figuring out what you feel is missing, and that sort of thing. Thanks.

989
00:52:08,253 --> 00:52:09,073
I forget the order now.

990
00:52:09,373 --> 00:52:10,534
I think we're over there. We'll go that way.

991
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:16,445
You talked about your Kickstarter backers coming on board with your testing early on.

992
00:52:17,286 --> 00:52:22,332
How did you deal with that shift in feedback from just being a very close-knit team of two

993
00:52:22,352 --> 00:52:25,635
to suddenly having 5,000 people's worth of feedback?

994
00:52:25,655 --> 00:52:27,838
How did you prioritize which feedback was important?

995
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:30,361
We didn't deal with it very well, I can tell you that.

996
00:52:31,466 --> 00:52:33,787
But we worked too hard, mostly.

997
00:52:33,867 --> 00:52:37,869
I mean, we used getSatisfaction to have the actual feedback

998
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:38,389
coming through.

999
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:44,011
With 3,000 people, there was a vocal 500, maybe 250

1000
00:52:44,492 --> 00:52:45,012
in the beginning.

1001
00:52:45,392 --> 00:52:47,853
And there was actually enough of a flow

1002
00:52:47,893 --> 00:52:49,554
that we could manage that while developing.

1003
00:52:50,354 --> 00:52:57,458
We were lucky enough, I was terrified going into it that it was going to be this mass of people just barraging us with questions and concerns.

1004
00:52:57,958 --> 00:53:04,501
But it did actually end up with a manageable flow that we didn't really have to stress about that too much and be able to do it.

1005
00:53:04,561 --> 00:53:05,902
We stressed about it a lot and did it.

1006
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:13,385
Part of it is also just that we had a core group that would go and answer a lot of the basic simple questions for us.

1007
00:53:13,445 --> 00:53:18,409
Just like people who just were active in the forum and the Get Satisfaction page.

1008
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,952
And just really help us out in that way.

1009
00:53:23,294 --> 00:53:24,975
In terms of prioritizing...

1010
00:53:26,439 --> 00:53:28,841
I, as a programmer, I was focusing on the bugs.

1011
00:53:29,321 --> 00:53:30,222
I would always look at bugs.

1012
00:53:30,342 --> 00:53:31,783
Bugs had to come first no matter what.

1013
00:53:32,164 --> 00:53:33,325
Everything else had to be put back.

1014
00:53:33,745 --> 00:53:36,227
And it was definitely, and luckily Get Satisfaction,

1015
00:53:36,267 --> 00:53:38,930
the website, as I advertise it for them here,

1016
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:42,273
has a problem section and an idea section

1017
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:43,313
and a question section.

1018
00:53:43,694 --> 00:53:46,056
And so my day would start in the problem section,

1019
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,377
and if I solved all that stuff,

1020
00:53:47,477 --> 00:53:48,878
then I would move on to the other sections.

1021
00:53:48,998 --> 00:53:51,360
So did you find the community was quite disciplined

1022
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,282
in not posting duplicates of bugs?

1023
00:53:54,302 --> 00:53:56,143
So you get 10,000 bugs that were the same, and then?

1024
00:53:56,243 --> 00:53:58,024
Again, a great thing about Get Satisfaction

1025
00:53:58,124 --> 00:54:00,226
is that when you type in your initial bug,

1026
00:54:00,286 --> 00:54:02,207
it runs a search to find if it's already posted.

1027
00:54:02,808 --> 00:54:05,209
It doesn't even let you post without running a search.

1028
00:54:05,229 --> 00:54:08,211
In general, though, they were pretty good about it.

1029
00:54:08,571 --> 00:54:11,293
And in general, they were pretty good about not posting

1030
00:54:11,393 --> 00:54:14,275
bugs or ideas as bugs or vice versa that

1031
00:54:14,295 --> 00:54:15,376
can sometimes get in the way.

1032
00:54:15,696 --> 00:54:17,017
But they were a great community.

1033
00:54:17,237 --> 00:54:17,657
In terms of

1034
00:54:18,677 --> 00:54:20,879
the design which I was spending more time on,

1035
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,562
most of it was just ended up being like, you know,

1036
00:54:24,282 --> 00:54:26,344
this isn't something that fits in our view, you know,

1037
00:54:26,404 --> 00:54:29,327
like we just, it was, a lot of suggestions were either,

1038
00:54:29,367 --> 00:54:30,608
you know, things that we had thought about,

1039
00:54:30,888 --> 00:54:33,750
things that we conceived but could never do

1040
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,772
and very few things that we never even thought of.

1041
00:54:36,213 --> 00:54:37,874
But for example, like I wrote.

1042
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:41,055
save, we wrote save game in the little screenshot there.

1043
00:54:41,115 --> 00:54:43,095
Oh yeah, that save game was the big issue.

1044
00:54:43,195 --> 00:54:44,435
We didn't have it in the beta.

1045
00:54:44,655 --> 00:54:46,216
You couldn't save and quit from the very beginning.

1046
00:54:46,236 --> 00:54:47,576
And we didn't want to add it.

1047
00:54:47,716 --> 00:54:49,456
And we were fighting them for like months.

1048
00:54:49,936 --> 00:54:51,917
And that was the most complained about thing,

1049
00:54:51,937 --> 00:54:53,377
to not have a save game.

1050
00:54:53,417 --> 00:54:56,878
They're like some sort of temporary save feature.

1051
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,218
And eventually that was the one thing

1052
00:54:59,238 --> 00:55:00,798
that we really like caved on.

1053
00:55:00,818 --> 00:55:02,499
We're like, fine, here you go.

1054
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,079
Have your save game.

1055
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:07,120
Yeah, OK, thanks.

1056
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:11,201
First of all, I want to thank you for the great game.

1057
00:55:12,082 --> 00:55:17,008
I spent, personally, I spent a huge amount of time trying to beat it on easy mode.

1058
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:20,232
I managed to do so.

1059
00:55:21,513 --> 00:55:28,621
And the question is, could you please share a percentage ratio of user base on different

1060
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:29,562
operating systems?

1061
00:55:31,168 --> 00:55:31,508
I'm sorry.

1062
00:55:31,608 --> 00:55:32,569
Operating system.

1063
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:33,770
How many people?

1064
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:34,890
Percentage ratio, yeah.

1065
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:35,611
Yeah, percentages.

1066
00:55:35,631 --> 00:55:36,371
Do you have any idea?

1067
00:55:36,531 --> 00:55:37,372
Oh, I have no idea.

1068
00:55:37,412 --> 00:55:37,892
I'm sorry.

1069
00:55:39,674 --> 00:55:40,994
Vast majority of Windows.

1070
00:55:41,655 --> 00:55:43,296
The vast majority is Windows, as you'd expect.

1071
00:55:44,056 --> 00:55:45,417
And then I would.

1072
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:47,198
5% maybe for Linux?

1073
00:55:47,659 --> 00:55:48,799
I would, no, no, smaller.

1074
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,841
And I would guess that Mac and Linux is nearly equal.

1075
00:55:52,877 --> 00:56:00,022
The Linux community really did respond to us putting it on there, and while it was extremely

1076
00:56:00,062 --> 00:56:05,947
difficult for me to release as the programmer the three operating systems day one, the Linux

1077
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:09,670
community really made it worth it because they were so grateful for having us take the

1078
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:10,290
time to do that.

1079
00:56:10,811 --> 00:56:15,734
But they were definitely still a small minority compared to the Windows team.

1080
00:56:16,395 --> 00:56:16,635
Thank you.

1081
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,641
Linux on Steam really boosted it as well.

1082
00:56:20,482 --> 00:56:23,823
We doubled the Linux users at this point.

1083
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:30,246
So you guys had quite a large following after the Kickstarter and everything.

1084
00:56:31,807 --> 00:56:35,808
I'm sure you guys are aware of the community that kind of popped up and created mods for it,

1085
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:38,770
especially with new ship layouts and everything.

1086
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:42,811
I was kind of curious your opinions of that, and if you guys were to make another game in the future,

1087
00:56:42,851 --> 00:56:44,932
would you kind of accommodate something like that from the beginning?

1088
00:56:46,818 --> 00:56:52,500
When we were starting, you know, like I was saying, we, ideally we, you know, for this

1089
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,741
community, ideally we would have structured the game to be able to support modding.

1090
00:56:55,781 --> 00:56:59,522
So like, you could see, if you follow that community, there's a lot of struggles to sort

1091
00:56:59,542 --> 00:57:05,224
of work within the sort of crappy framework that we gave them.

1092
00:57:05,244 --> 00:57:06,965
So there's very limited things that they can do.

1093
00:57:07,385 --> 00:57:07,885
In terms of...

1094
00:57:10,807 --> 00:57:15,750
In terms of like for the next project, I mean obviously it would be smarter to do that,

1095
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:20,333
especially if we will get a lot of fans who enjoyed FTL and be able to have the same sort

1096
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:24,376
of situation of people wanting to like, you know, own it and like work with it and that

1097
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:24,836
sort of thing.

1098
00:57:24,876 --> 00:57:26,017
We definitely should.

1099
00:57:27,618 --> 00:57:28,078
Will we?

1100
00:57:28,098 --> 00:57:28,638
I don't know.

1101
00:57:29,263 --> 00:57:33,985
I would, a more moddable game is inherently a probably better developed game.

1102
00:57:34,486 --> 00:57:38,967
It's easier for us to add content if we have convenient ways to mod and alter it.

1103
00:57:38,987 --> 00:57:39,888
Less easier to break.

1104
00:57:40,068 --> 00:57:43,909
So I would hope if only for selfish reasons that it would be easier to mod in the future,

1105
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:45,870
or a future game would be.

1106
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:49,051
And it is a lot of fun. It's a little frightening at first,

1107
00:57:49,191 --> 00:57:51,132
seeing a community take apart your game.

1108
00:57:51,492 --> 00:57:54,073
We spent a year and a half slaving over it,

1109
00:57:54,474 --> 00:57:57,575
and then digging through your private notes and private scripts.

1110
00:57:57,595 --> 00:57:58,835
It's like going through your underwear drawers.

1111
00:57:59,055 --> 00:58:02,157
and then posting, look, you made a typo in this completely

1112
00:58:02,217 --> 00:58:03,578
private packaged file.

1113
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:08,780
And it's a bit creepy or weird, but we've gotten used to it.

1114
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,561
And it's a lot of fun seeing the amazing what some of the people

1115
00:58:11,581 --> 00:58:12,002
come out with.

1116
00:58:12,342 --> 00:58:16,744
And the devotion to the style and the art and the new layouts

1117
00:58:16,824 --> 00:58:20,185
and stuff, a real impressive understanding of the game.

1118
00:58:20,426 --> 00:58:22,426
And it still blows me away.

1119
00:58:22,867 --> 00:58:26,250
like one guy who actively knew that he was turning the ship

1120
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:30,514
into an AI ship, a player ship, so that it could be AI ships,

1121
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:32,196
by definition, regenerate systems.

1122
00:58:32,236 --> 00:58:35,619
So there's one ship that you can regenerate everything slowly.

1123
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,662
So it's awesome to follow it.

1124
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:40,284
Thank you, guys.

1125
00:58:40,304 --> 00:58:40,504
Thanks.

1126
00:58:43,113 --> 00:58:43,513
Hey, guys.

1127
00:58:44,134 --> 00:58:45,776
In the earlier phases of your development,

1128
00:58:46,016 --> 00:58:47,357
when you were doing all the prototypes

1129
00:58:47,397 --> 00:58:49,400
and you had the basic prototype and the spatial prototype,

1130
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,741
et cetera, before the Kickstarter,

1131
00:58:51,181 --> 00:58:52,583
did you look for a lot of feedback

1132
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:54,425
from people outside your group?

1133
00:58:54,585 --> 00:58:55,746
Or was it just you two?

1134
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:57,088
How did that kind of work?

1135
00:58:57,568 --> 00:58:59,510
When did Matt, or when did Amit Shih jump in?

1136
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:02,051
About five months into the project, I think, is when we first...

1137
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:05,333
other than our girlfriends who would see it from the beginning.

1138
00:59:06,713 --> 00:59:07,934
That was about it for a while.

1139
00:59:08,014 --> 00:59:10,415
Then there were maybe two or three people that we gave it to

1140
00:59:10,435 --> 00:59:12,736
at about the five-month mark.

1141
00:59:13,196 --> 00:59:18,038
And were definitely incredibly important to the balance and design of the game.

1142
00:59:18,438 --> 00:59:23,261
about once we got close to that IGF build where the game was more complete then we started

1143
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:29,783
reaching out to various indie developers and people who that we had contacted and they helped

1144
00:59:29,823 --> 00:59:36,666
us test a lot as well but we didn't do any sort of massive QA in any sort at that time or trials.

1145
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:41,208
Thank you. One more? Okay.

1146
00:59:42,629 --> 00:59:45,470
What was it like living in China and how did that affect your game?

1147
00:59:46,961 --> 00:59:51,504
Yes, so for those of you who don't know we were both living in China for a few years before we started

1148
00:59:52,304 --> 00:59:58,948
Working on FTL. We were working from our separate apartments for most of the time. We didn't have a studio or anything and then

1149
01:00:00,328 --> 01:00:03,530
Near the end of development. I at least came to live in the US for a while

1150
01:00:05,311 --> 01:00:10,934
How did it affect China's awesome? I mean China's a it's it's a especially Shanghai

1151
01:00:11,298 --> 01:00:13,120
Yeah, Stronghide is such an international city,

1152
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,163
and there's a slightly lower, cheaper cost of living.

1153
01:00:18,664 --> 01:00:21,546
And so as an independent developer, that was big.

1154
01:00:21,786 --> 01:00:24,388
The fact that we could live on a shoestring budget,

1155
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:28,190
and you can go get lunch for $0.50, less than that,

1156
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:29,651
and it would be a good lunch, too.

1157
01:00:30,152 --> 01:00:32,593
And so there was definitely just the financial benefit

1158
01:00:32,693 --> 01:00:33,834
of China was awesome.

1159
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,216
And it was fun being over there.

1160
01:00:36,776 --> 01:00:38,177
It's a great place.

1161
01:00:38,397 --> 01:00:39,198
Yeah, definitely.

1162
01:00:40,566 --> 01:00:44,568
I mean, I'm not exactly sure how much it has affected development,

1163
01:00:44,648 --> 01:00:47,489
other than enhancing the feeling like we were in a cave.

1164
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:52,012
Like, because we, like, it was just, especially during those times, we...

1165
01:00:52,952 --> 01:00:55,313
I left the apartment every once in a while.

1166
01:00:56,414 --> 01:00:57,874
There was no point. I didn't...

1167
01:00:58,912 --> 01:01:01,254
We released the game, and then like two months or a month

1168
01:01:01,314 --> 01:01:03,136
after we released the game, I came to California

1169
01:01:03,196 --> 01:01:03,977
to go to IndieCade.

1170
01:01:04,277 --> 01:01:06,759
And that was the first time I met any of our Kickstarter

1171
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:09,462
backers or really met anybody who knew what FTL was,

1172
01:01:10,002 --> 01:01:11,703
even though that we had been building publicity

1173
01:01:11,743 --> 01:01:14,666
and things for a year prior to that.

1174
01:01:15,026 --> 01:01:17,489
And so it did definitely enhance that cave-like feeling

1175
01:01:17,649 --> 01:01:20,651
of developing over there, which was not necessarily a bad thing.

1176
01:01:22,113 --> 01:01:23,754
I guess that's all we have time for.

1177
01:01:23,894 --> 01:01:24,975
So thank you, everybody.

1178
01:01:24,995 --> 01:01:25,175
Thank you.
