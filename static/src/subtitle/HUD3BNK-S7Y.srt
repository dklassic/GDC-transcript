1
00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:15,501
I trust everyone's GDC is treating them wonderfully.

2
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:20,063
I hope you took some time off work this week to actually digest all the stuff you're learning.

3
00:00:21,084 --> 00:00:26,487
So you're here for Finding Character Voice with Your Voice, and lucky you, this talk

4
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:27,368
is virtual.

5
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:31,951
Back when I planned on doing it in person, there was going to be some audience participation,

6
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,932
so yeah, you dodged a bullet.

7
00:00:34,793 --> 00:00:38,835
Anyway, if people still hashtag, you can use the hashtag vocalwriting.

8
00:00:40,058 --> 00:00:42,880
All right, so what are we learning today?

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,003
Well, there's only one point I'm really here to make,

10
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:48,184
and that's that adding vocal performance

11
00:00:48,224 --> 00:00:50,806
in the writer's room can add depth to your characters,

12
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:51,967
whether they're voiced or not.

13
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:54,309
I mean, just look at Gordon Freeman here.

14
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:55,890
He doesn't have a lot to say vocally,

15
00:00:55,991 --> 00:00:58,533
but he says things with his face,

16
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:00,334
at least that's how I interpret it.

17
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:03,396
So why are you even listening to me?

18
00:01:04,112 --> 00:01:10,233
Well, my name is Cyrus Nemadi, and at one point here at GDC not too long ago, I was

19
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,474
probably begging you for voice acting jobs.

20
00:01:13,134 --> 00:01:16,695
Some of you said yes, and so I've had a lot of fun doing voice acting for games.

21
00:01:17,055 --> 00:01:18,575
You can see some of the titles I've been in.

22
00:01:18,675 --> 00:01:21,856
You may have heard me in Hades last year.

23
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,996
It was, yeah, that was a good game.

24
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:24,756
It was a good game.

25
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:28,877
I won't do the voices now, but perhaps I can be convinced.

26
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:37,062
I've since transitioned into writing full-time because there is such a thing as a guaranteed

27
00:01:37,523 --> 00:01:38,543
full-time writer.

28
00:01:39,044 --> 00:01:43,467
The hustle is tough as a voice actor, so please hug your voice actors.

29
00:01:44,047 --> 00:01:44,828
They work hard.

30
00:01:45,668 --> 00:01:50,171
I'm a lead writer for June's Journey and Tropic Cats at Wooga, where we develop narratively

31
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,072
driven mobile games.

32
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:56,900
It's done pretty well for us as it happens, because a good story and good characters,

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,889
surprisingly, well, not surprisingly at all, keep the audience coming.

34
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:05,985
So, most of us are here to make characters.

35
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:07,906
It's kind of daunting, isn't it?

36
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:12,409
Creating a fully fleshed out, believable, sentient being

37
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:15,811
from absolutely nothing but our own imaginations.

38
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:18,113
That's intense.

39
00:02:18,553 --> 00:02:20,755
It sounds really impressive when I put it like that.

40
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:22,896
So, how do we do it?

41
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,619
Well, there are a few basic necessities

42
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:27,839
to understanding a character.

43
00:02:28,673 --> 00:02:32,075
You can get the gist from a description, some keywords, and imagery.

44
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:34,316
This is a character from Tropicats.

45
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:40,360
We've got some basic descriptors, a minor bit of backstory, and the character art that

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,981
we settled on.

47
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:46,024
From there we can get a start on writing dialogue from this character's perspective, but

48
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,942
This isn't a lot of information.

49
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,605
There is so much about this cat that we don't know.

50
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:57,650
We want to give our characters depth, but how can we possibly create something with

51
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:03,876
a real personality and history without knowing their life story or lore, for lack of a better

52
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:04,076
word?

53
00:03:04,782 --> 00:03:07,725
And you may ask yourself, does my character just need more lore?

54
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:08,906
Well, no.

55
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:12,950
Lore is not the only solution to giving your character

56
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:13,911
a strong background.

57
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:16,893
The reason your character doesn't necessarily

58
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:20,537
need more lore is that you will never, ever,

59
00:03:21,626 --> 00:03:26,891
ever be able to turn them into a complete, three-dimensional character with all the memories

60
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:31,195
and history of a sentient being without living out their entire lifetime.

61
00:03:31,936 --> 00:03:36,521
You couldn't even write the full lore for a baby, because its life is going on at the

62
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:37,422
same rate as yours.

63
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,654
You can try, but I don't know how much fun you're going to have, or how much fun your

64
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:44,355
audience will have.

65
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:46,817
So let's just not write for babies.

66
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:52,422
Anyway, this is a screenshot from Batman Arkham City, with a bio for one of Batman's most

67
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:54,764
timely foes, Calendar Man.

68
00:03:55,265 --> 00:04:00,189
We will never know enough about Calendar Man, though the masses may beg for more of him.

69
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:06,090
Now we could get together and give him loads and loads of backstory, and it might please

70
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,272
a few hardcore Calendar Man fans.

71
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:10,414
Raise your hands if you're in that group.

72
00:04:10,674 --> 00:04:14,278
But very few people are actually going to dig into that lore.

73
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,602
You might find it important, and maybe it is.

74
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:20,224
Maybe it's vital information for this character's backstory.

75
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:22,006
But how does your audience know that?

76
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:26,688
You're just telling them facts. Facts, in this case, about Calendar Man.

77
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:32,369
I mean, the guy based his identity upon calendars. Is lore going to do much for this poor lost soul?

78
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:40,371
So you can convey lore without telling. Lore provides explicit characterization, but the

79
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:45,192
often easier and more rewarding route is through implicit characterization.

80
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:49,333
So what is implicit characterization, you ask?

81
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:54,805
Well, it's basically any context that we can pick up without being explicitly told.

82
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:59,413
We can get implicit characterization most clearly through visuals.

83
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:03,339
Through character art, we can pick up an incredible amount of information.

84
00:05:04,044 --> 00:05:06,605
This is a character from Luga's hit game, June's Journey.

85
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:09,087
Without reading a line of text, you

86
00:05:09,127 --> 00:05:11,828
can tell me probably a good amount about this character.

87
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:13,789
Without seeing her character brief,

88
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:16,090
you can tell me about her general attitude,

89
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,332
her social class, her age, where she might be from,

90
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:22,333
and how her moods manifest themselves.

91
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:26,936
This is all right here on the page in the form of her,

92
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:31,978
how she dresses, the expressions on her face, her general style,

93
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,219
and her body positioning.

94
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:39,767
But we can learn similar things from voices, and they can help us with our dialogue, just like visuals.

95
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,951
But my dialogue is already pretty good, you say.

96
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:49,037
Well, how do you know that your dialogue is good? Have you heard it out of your character's mouth?

97
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:57,305
I came across this tweet a while ago by Mike Bethel of Thomas Was Alone fame, and I had to save it. It resonated with me.

98
00:05:58,092 --> 00:05:58,473
He wrote,

99
00:05:59,216 --> 00:06:03,672
My writing gets ten times better once I've settled on my dream casting for the character

100
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:04,294
I'm working on.

101
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:05,953
It's a good tweet.

102
00:06:06,553 --> 00:06:08,254
It's actually a really good point, too.

103
00:06:09,115 --> 00:06:11,216
Mentally assembling a cast of actors

104
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:12,256
who could play your character

105
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:14,318
is already providing characterization.

106
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:16,979
Imagine you're struggling with a character,

107
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,061
making their dialogue sound consistent and iconic,

108
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:22,103
and you realize, huh, you know,

109
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:24,504
Sylvester Stallone kind of sounds like this,

110
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:26,905
and the dialogue starts to flow naturally.

111
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:29,027
Well, you know, at least as naturally

112
00:06:29,147 --> 00:06:30,928
as Sylvester Stallone's dialogue does,

113
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:33,690
because you know what he sounds like.

114
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:39,764
That's the point. A character is much easier to solidify when you know how they sound.

115
00:06:41,145 --> 00:06:46,850
Let's talk about Super Mario. You look at him now, and you know what he sounds like.

116
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:48,652
But it wasn't always this way.

117
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:57,844
Mario Bros. was Mario's first self-titled game, but back in 1983, he didn't look anything like the Mario we're familiar with.

118
00:06:58,405 --> 00:07:05,451
Only with the release of Super Mario Bros. 2 in 1988 did we start to get closer to the idea of Mario that we have today,

119
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:10,014
with the big eyes, the bulbous nose, and the squat figure that he's had ever since.

120
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:15,912
And that was the extent of our understanding of Mario's character, which continued with

121
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:19,536
1988's Super Mario Bros. 3 and 1990's Super Mario World.

122
00:07:19,977 --> 00:07:26,986
Now, I want you to erase everything you know about Mario and just focus on these images

123
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,210
and the explicit lore that we knew at the time.

124
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:35,060
He's a plumber, he's Italian, he jumps around a lot,

125
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:36,922
he uses pipes.

126
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:40,005
So what does this guy sound like

127
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:41,947
based on purely what we see?

128
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:49,893
Hey, I'm Mario! Hey, I'm flying! I'm riding on a dinosaur! I don't know, something like that.

129
00:07:49,913 --> 00:07:55,859
I mean, this visual was all that we knew about Mario. Unless you watched the Super Mario Brothers

130
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,104
Super Show, which is maybe where I'm getting this kind of voice from. But that's all we knew

131
00:08:00,144 --> 00:08:03,247
at the time, and that is indeed all we knew about Mario until 1996.

132
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:08,837
when Mario 64 came out, it shocked the industry.

133
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:12,119
Not only was Mario in 3D for the first time

134
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,142
with a huge array of animations, but he actually spoke.

135
00:08:15,782 --> 00:08:18,064
And that gave him instant characterization

136
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:20,426
that not even an army of writers could provide.

137
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:22,127
Let's listen.

138
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:25,610
Wah!

139
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,130
Boo!

140
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,191
Mama mia!

141
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:28,112
Okie dokie!

142
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:29,473
Bloop bloop bloop!

143
00:08:29,513 --> 00:08:31,714
Thank you so much for playing my game.

144
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:32,375
Oh-oh!

145
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:32,755
Oof!

146
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:33,116
Ah!

147
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:39,182
It's me, Mario!

148
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:39,523
Yeah!

149
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:40,043
Yeah!

150
00:08:40,244 --> 00:08:40,384
Ooh!

151
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:40,864
Ooh!

152
00:08:41,065 --> 00:08:41,305
Ooh!

153
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,306
Here we go!

154
00:08:42,766 --> 00:08:42,987
Ooh!

155
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:44,068
Ooh!

156
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:44,468
Ooh!

157
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:45,850
Ooh!

158
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,070
Ooh!

159
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:46,230
Ooh!

160
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,971
Let's go!

161
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:47,351
Yeah!

162
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:47,992
Ah-ha!

163
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:48,933
Yahoo!

164
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:49,374
Uh!

165
00:08:49,534 --> 00:08:49,874
Yeah!

166
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:50,135
Yeah!

167
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:50,855
Whoa!

168
00:08:50,995 --> 00:08:52,617
Okay, all right, you get the point.

169
00:08:53,098 --> 00:08:53,598
Sorry, whoops.

170
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:57,002
Let me go back, I got a little ahead of myself.

171
00:08:57,322 --> 00:08:58,123
Mario, quiet down.

172
00:08:58,464 --> 00:08:58,604
Okay.

173
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,221
This guy is ridiculous.

174
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:02,562
What is that?

175
00:09:03,103 --> 00:09:06,227
The guy who defeated a fire-breathing dinosaur sounds like this?

176
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,190
Well, he does.

177
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,511
Because he does.

178
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:14,137
And suddenly we know an incredible amount about Super Mario's character.

179
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,078
He's a maniac.

180
00:09:16,498 --> 00:09:19,659
He is absolutely thrilled just to be alive,

181
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,740
whooping with every jump.

182
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,241
He's never known true sadness,

183
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:27,022
only surprise or temporary dismay,

184
00:09:27,082 --> 00:09:28,422
thanks to all the lives he's got,

185
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:30,763
as he falls down a pit screaming.

186
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:31,904
Whoa!

187
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:36,310
Thank you so much for playing my game.

188
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,412
Okay, Mario, quiet down. We're not here for you anymore.

189
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:41,014
Okay, so there's not a serious bone in Mario's body,

190
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:44,837
and it has been a part of his characterization ever since we heard his voice.

191
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:47,919
Even when Mario games are more narratively driven,

192
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:50,001
such as in the Mario & Luigi series,

193
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:52,883
Mario still expresses himself in the same way.

194
00:09:53,464 --> 00:09:57,247
We've picked up an incredible amount of information just by hearing him speak.

195
00:09:58,027 --> 00:09:58,608
And you may say,

196
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:01,430
I don't need that. I'm not making Mario.

197
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:01,770
Well...

198
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:07,941
Why aren't you? Mario is as iconic a character as video games have ever made, and his voice

199
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,322
is part of what makes him iconic.

200
00:10:11,222 --> 00:10:15,183
Here's another extreme example of how performance can positively affect your game.

201
00:10:15,944 --> 00:10:20,605
This is one of the most iconic characters to come out of a video game in the last decade.

202
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,486
And you probably have no clue who he is.

203
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:28,876
How about now? Do you recognize him? Yeah, that's the same guy.

204
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:35,819
Voss from Far Cry 3 was originally your typical big ol' angry brute of a character,

205
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:42,061
but when Michael Mando simply auditioned for the role, the character changed dramatically.

206
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:48,984
The depth that the actor provided gave Voss nuance that he didn't have. A reason for his rage

207
00:10:49,304 --> 00:10:53,746
that not only improved the character, but altered the identity for the entire game.

208
00:10:54,719 --> 00:11:00,247
If you haven't played it—minor spoiler—Vas isn't even the main villain, but look who's

209
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:00,968
on the cover art.

210
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:07,537
He became the identity of the game through a strong, unsettling, nuanced performance

211
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:09,280
that changed the writing for the character.

212
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,641
And then Far Cry 4 came out with another charismatic, memorable villain driving the action.

213
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:17,702
And it happened again in Far Cry 5.

214
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:23,023
And it will happen once more, well probably not once more, in Far Cry 6.

215
00:11:23,103 --> 00:11:30,784
So it wasn't only one game, but an entire franchise that was uplifted by a performance

216
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,765
that changed the way a studio viewed character building.

217
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:39,486
Michael Mando, my man, I really hope you're getting royalties, cuz, damn.

218
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:44,428
But this is all big budget craziness, you say.

219
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:46,870
My game doesn't even have voiced characters,

220
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,192
so what good is all this going to do me?

221
00:11:49,873 --> 00:11:52,815
Well, surprise, you don't even need to have

222
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,537
voiced characters for performance to make a big difference.

223
00:11:56,675 --> 00:12:00,919
At Wooga, we do mobile games, and as many of you know, the number of people playing

224
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,881
mobile games with sound on is really, really low.

225
00:12:04,382 --> 00:12:09,326
Whether sound is worth having on during a typical mobile game is another GDC talk that

226
00:12:09,366 --> 00:12:13,650
I'm not qualified to give, but the fact remains that the day players will routinely

227
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,192
hear the sound of their mobile games is still quite far away.

228
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:21,137
But we still weave performance into our process at Wooga on June's journey.

229
00:12:22,004 --> 00:12:24,125
This is our standard simplified process.

230
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:29,126
Of course, we plot our overarching scenes, we write our story, we test our dialogue,

231
00:12:29,386 --> 00:12:30,246
and we implement it.

232
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:35,288
But the testing is where we can get a lot of hints about characters and have some fun.

233
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:37,148
This is my team.

234
00:12:37,908 --> 00:12:40,169
They're going to do a typical scene reading.

235
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:42,130
Don't worry, it's short.

236
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,510
Yeah, let's just play it.

237
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:09,728
I've got some shifts that need covering.

238
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:11,409
Let's bump you up to 20 hours a day.

239
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:12,470
I can't.

240
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,271
I need rest.

241
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:14,572
I already work all day.

242
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:15,813
I'm taking care of my grandmother.

243
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:17,254
Oh, you poor thing.

244
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:18,595
I'll make you a deal then.

245
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:20,737
I can give you all the rest you need.

246
00:13:21,337 --> 00:13:27,182
I can just cross off all your shifts and you can put up those filthy little feet.

247
00:13:27,622 --> 00:13:28,443
Okay, you get the point.

248
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,094
That's not that great.

249
00:13:32,474 --> 00:13:35,998
When you're just reading, you get maybe flubs in your dialogue.

250
00:13:36,018 --> 00:13:39,381
You may have heard that there was a little bit of a typo that was corrected,

251
00:13:39,421 --> 00:13:40,623
but that's kind of all we get.

252
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:44,687
But you don't need to have actors in the writer's room

253
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:46,509
to be able to put forth a performance.

254
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:50,132
I want to start with a writer's bit.

255
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,613
Sorry, I want to start with a writer's biggest strength, and that is empathy.

256
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:59,758
Think about how your character feels on a very basic level, line by line.

257
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:03,581
How would they react to the situation that they're facing?

258
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:06,283
Don't be afraid to get physical.

259
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:09,946
I'm not saying punch your colleagues in the face if that's what your character is doing,

260
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,648
but go ahead and punch the air if it helps.

261
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:12,929
Slam the table.

262
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:17,032
Actually laugh, because this physicality gets put into character.

263
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:19,354
Slow down.

264
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:22,435
This isn't a script reading anymore.

265
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:24,636
The objective isn't to get it over with.

266
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,037
Give your characters the same respect

267
00:14:27,097 --> 00:14:28,677
you give them in dialogue writing.

268
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,618
Finally, just have fun.

269
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:33,438
You are being paid, hopefully,

270
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,539
to do creative things for a living.

271
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,239
Life is good.

272
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,900
This is a justified part of the process.

273
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,161
So don't feel bad about enjoying it.

274
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:44,442
I want to play that same clip again,

275
00:14:44,482 --> 00:14:46,542
and this time, turn on a little bit of character.

276
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:48,209
and whenever you're ready.

277
00:15:12,184 --> 00:15:16,849
I can't, I need rest. I already work all day, and I'm taking care of my grandmother.

278
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:21,393
Oh, you poor thing. I'll make you a deal then. I can give you all the rest you need.

279
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:25,577
I'll just cross off all your shifts and you can put those filthy little feet up.

280
00:15:25,597 --> 00:15:29,061
Sir, I need those hours. How will I pay the rent?

281
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:30,102
That's your problem, you see.

282
00:15:35,152 --> 00:15:42,538
Alright, so we got a few benefits out of this more characterful meeting, out of this more

283
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:45,200
characterful run-through of our dialogue.

284
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:49,324
First, we are hearing the lines as if a human delivered them.

285
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:51,245
Which is always a good start.

286
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:53,607
It helps us avoid unnatural dialogue.

287
00:15:54,507 --> 00:15:56,609
We've gotten a tonal check on our work.

288
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,011
Does a line sound angry enough?

289
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:02,273
Does the character feel insulted, hurt, hangry?

290
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:03,514
Well, we know now.

291
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:06,996
Third, we have a possible hint at our character's background.

292
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:08,577
You heard some accents.

293
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:11,019
That we can use for characterization.

294
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,401
We might also pick up an appropriate age.

295
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:15,382
Maybe there's a little grit in their voice

296
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:17,844
that speaks to a troubled childhood, or a drinking

297
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:19,285
problem, or maybe they smoke.

298
00:16:19,706 --> 00:16:24,478
Who knows, maybe they sound like Gilbert Gottfried with all of the challenges that that entails.

299
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:29,441
Fourth, through this characterization, we have some idea about how our characters express

300
00:16:29,461 --> 00:16:29,862
themselves.

301
00:16:30,342 --> 00:16:33,744
We can almost see in our mind's eye how they'll move when they speak.

302
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:38,528
If you've ever seen old clips of Disney animators, they'd keep a mirror at their

303
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:43,111
desks so that they could act out scenes to ensure that characters were making the right

304
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:43,511
faces.

305
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:49,336
What this all amounts to is that vocal performance gives character depth at a very slight cost

306
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:52,058
of putting ourselves out there and getting into character.

307
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:57,743
As a result of characterful readings, we regularly change the direction of our characters, especially

308
00:16:57,823 --> 00:16:59,064
early on in the writing process.

309
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:04,127
They grow in complexity and personality and end up with more depth than they would in

310
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:04,587
a vacuum.

311
00:17:05,587 --> 00:17:09,129
If you've been here at GDC before, you've probably met Sara Elmaleh.

312
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:13,912
She's been an incredible champion for collaboration between voice actors and game developers,

313
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:18,454
and I think she's got a fantastic example of how performance changed character for the

314
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:19,514
better in Gears 5.

315
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:25,927
I was getting worried.

316
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:27,228
You didn't report back.

317
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:30,610
Radio died, and these guys pulled me out of a jam.

318
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,571
Calvary's here.

319
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:36,074
I was brought in to play Lizzie Carmen in Gears 5.

320
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:38,315
She started very tough, and she was always

321
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,516
meant to be very tough, very durable, and kind

322
00:17:40,536 --> 00:17:41,477
of intimidating and cool.

323
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,154
And as I was recording her for the single player,

324
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,855
she got a bit wilder.

325
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:47,215
She kind of had more gusto.

326
00:17:47,956 --> 00:17:50,177
The writers took that and ran with it.

327
00:17:50,457 --> 00:17:52,518
And it took on this like feedback loop feeling

328
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:54,739
of affirmation as I was wild in these sessions

329
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,880
and they added to her wildness and made her funnier.

330
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,841
And I was like, yes.

331
00:17:57,901 --> 00:17:58,721
And so it was this feeling

332
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:00,042
like you're building off of each other

333
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:03,444
and finding a truer, purer, more instinctive,

334
00:18:03,524 --> 00:18:05,265
more elevated version of this character

335
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,006
that just takes on a life of its own.

336
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,854
One of the things I really like about Sarah's approach is that it is truly collaborative.

337
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:16,918
Writers are fueled by her perspective and her understanding of character from a vocal

338
00:18:16,978 --> 00:18:20,902
performance perspective, and that bond creates a better end product.

339
00:18:21,783 --> 00:18:23,664
Oops, let me, okay, there we go.

340
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:25,325
So I wanna talk a little bit more

341
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:26,805
about that bonding aspect.

342
00:18:27,285 --> 00:18:30,726
Most of us can recognize when writing is uninspired

343
00:18:30,806 --> 00:18:32,387
or when it's done just to fulfill

344
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:33,967
some sort of narrative checkbox.

345
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:36,628
If your studio acts as though writing

346
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,969
is just the thing one must do to push the player along,

347
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:42,090
it is up to you to bring that enthusiasm for writing.

348
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,831
And the best way to do that is really to have fun with it.

349
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,452
This is my team again, this time reading a scene

350
00:18:47,832 --> 00:18:50,033
where a parrot holds the answer to a mystery.

351
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:59,030
That's my money, I'll give you the right to it!

352
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,912
You're quite the talker, aren't you, Mooty?

353
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:04,794
You're French, man!

354
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:06,635
No, you are French, this is correct.

355
00:19:06,655 --> 00:19:08,517
I was trying to say it, but...

356
00:19:08,677 --> 00:19:10,838
It was just through me.

357
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:14,381
That's my money, I'll give you the right to it!

358
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:16,502
You're quite the talker, aren't you, Mooty?

359
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:18,564
Get your filthy hands off me!

360
00:19:19,097 --> 00:19:22,379
Let's see if you can find that little guy something to eat.

361
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:24,519
Okay, you get it. This is just us having a good time.

362
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,221
But that good time helps us bond as a team,

363
00:19:27,281 --> 00:19:30,462
which is certainly a good thing to have in your writer's room.

364
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:33,423
The comfort that comes with a strong bond

365
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:37,665
allows you to explore and find a character's unique voice.

366
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:40,186
And voice makes your characters unique.

367
00:19:40,986 --> 00:19:43,507
My holy grail for written dialogue

368
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:46,028
is for the reader to know exactly who is speaking

369
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:47,209
without a name tag.

370
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:53,512
Kreia from Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2 is one of my favorite written characters in all

371
00:19:53,532 --> 00:20:00,094
of video games. Her dialogue is impressive and nuanced and, most importantly, there's no line

372
00:20:00,114 --> 00:20:03,076
that she speaks that could be said by any other character in the game.

373
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:08,958
She's expertly voiced by Sarah Kestelman, whom you will know from absolutely nothing.

374
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:13,800
Unless you're an avid fan of the Royal National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company,

375
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:17,741
and although I can't confirm that her performance influenced the writing,

376
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:20,722
it's hard to imagine it didn't. Let's hear a clip.

377
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,183
Do you seem to?

378
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:26,445
What? What are you doing? Get out of my head!

379
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:31,066
Stop struggling. Let me follow the current deep.

380
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:33,685
deeper to its source.

381
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:35,646
Stop! Stop!

382
00:20:36,046 --> 00:20:36,926
Aaaaah!

383
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:42,429
Ah, with the fear is mingled guilt.

384
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:45,830
It squirms in you like a worm.

385
00:20:47,491 --> 00:20:48,271
And the why?

386
00:20:50,412 --> 00:20:54,334
Ah, and there is its heart.

387
00:20:54,614 --> 00:20:58,056
You surprise me. I could not feel it before.

388
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:02,235
Your feelings are a powerful shield, indeed.

389
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:02,515
Do not...

390
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:03,595
Whew.

391
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:05,916
Oh man, she is so good.

392
00:21:06,236 --> 00:21:09,757
That character just holds so much weight.

393
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:16,500
She is deliberate, careful, even, despite the very obvious power that she holds.

394
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,501
And this we can tell from her voice, and it's got to influence our writing.

395
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:26,511
One of the things that we pick up certainly from this performance is that we probably

396
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,953
can't write this particular character a fart joke.

397
00:21:29,673 --> 00:21:34,857
Now, you may hear this and think, oh dang, I can't summon up this kind of performance.

398
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:42,352
Yeah, I hear you. Admittedly, I'm not sure I can, although I definitely like to make an attempt,

399
00:21:42,712 --> 00:21:48,034
and yes, I am open for voiceover work. But still, I recommend that you still give it a try.

400
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:52,995
But if you're saying, no, I want Hollywood quality or nothing, I've actually got some

401
00:21:53,015 --> 00:21:57,337
really interesting news for you. If you plan on hiring union actors,

402
00:21:57,457 --> 00:22:00,018
you can make use of the Help Network's SWAT team.

403
00:22:00,978 --> 00:22:05,862
I was kindly pointed out to the existence of SWAT by the immensely talented and friendly

404
00:22:05,922 --> 00:22:07,483
Sissy Jones, who you see here.

405
00:22:07,783 --> 00:22:09,265
You probably know her from Firewatch.

406
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:15,029
With SWAT, you can get skilled, professional union actors to do a couple of table reads

407
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:19,233
of pre-production material at a grand cost of nothing, because you won't be recording

408
00:22:19,253 --> 00:22:19,753
those sessions.

409
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:24,314
But this is an opportunity to get the chance to help your characters become fully realized

410
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:29,796
much earlier in the writing process, which I think is worth a lot more than zero dollars.

411
00:22:30,336 --> 00:22:32,456
And your product owners probably do too.

412
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:43,039
So what's the point? Use your voice. Perform. Have fun. There is absolutely no reason not to

413
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:47,740
do this in your writer's rooms. It costs you nothing. And the benefits are massive.

414
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,997
Even if you're the only writer on your team, perform your dialogue.

415
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,898
Grab somebody from marketing.

416
00:22:54,078 --> 00:22:55,919
Grab somebody from facilities.

417
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:56,379
Whatever.

418
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:59,280
Like just get those voices out there.

419
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,341
They will help you.

420
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:03,723
And if you are that uncomfortable, hire a voice actor.

421
00:23:03,803 --> 00:23:06,024
Consider it part of your pre-production process.

422
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:10,966
It's way cheaper than a million pages full of lore and can reveal depth to your character

423
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:12,027
that you wouldn't expect.

424
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,984
So thank you for listening. I hope you had a little fun and came away with some renewed

425
00:23:18,024 --> 00:23:22,568
excitement for your writer's rooms. If you'd like to get more insights into writing and vocal

426
00:23:22,608 --> 00:23:26,731
performance, I strongly recommend you check out Greg Kasavin and Darren Korb's talk,

427
00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:32,555
Breathing Life into Greek Myth, The Dialogue of Hades. I swear I'm not biased, man.
