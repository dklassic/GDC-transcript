1
00:00:05,837 --> 00:00:09,237
Wow, when they invited me to come up here and talk,

2
00:00:09,277 --> 00:00:11,498
I was kind of expecting maybe a classroom

3
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:12,858
with 20, 30 people in it.

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,160
Thank you all so much for getting up this early.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,760
If I hadn't been assigned this slot,

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,921
I would still be in bed right now.

7
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:26,262
There are a couple things I'm supposed to remind you of.

8
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:30,283
One is please shut off your,

9
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:32,904
put your phones on do not disturb or whatever.

10
00:00:35,084 --> 00:00:37,345
The other is there are evaluations.

11
00:00:38,265 --> 00:00:42,107
Please fill those out so the organizers will know

12
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,788
whether to bring me back someday.

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,551
So this is what we're here to talk about.

14
00:00:55,132 --> 00:01:00,153
Somehow, I got old and this game I worked on 15 years ago

15
00:01:00,754 --> 00:01:03,435
is now considered a classic, classic game post-mortem.

16
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:08,112
And who am I?

17
00:01:09,353 --> 00:01:12,615
I was the second employee at Treyarch.

18
00:01:12,716 --> 00:01:15,778
The founders, Peter and Don, were friends of mine

19
00:01:15,798 --> 00:01:17,920
from college, so like they say, it's who you know.

20
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:20,357
Lucky to know the right people.

21
00:01:20,877 --> 00:01:24,698
And also lucky that when the Spider-Man games came around

22
00:01:24,758 --> 00:01:27,918
and Activision gave us the license to do those games,

23
00:01:28,098 --> 00:01:30,159
I was in the, I had just come off the,

24
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,679
working on some Tony Hawk ports,

25
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,199
so I was in the perfect position

26
00:01:33,779 --> 00:01:36,520
to take over as lead programmer on those titles.

27
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,100
And that gave me the opportunity

28
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:43,061
to put a unique thumbprint on things,

29
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:45,241
or get a unique thumbprint started.

30
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:46,942
That metaphor makes no sense.

31
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:59,769
After Spider-Man, I went indie, and this is not so well known, I made a solo project called

32
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:04,713
Energy Hook that was continuing to investigate the idea of swinging game mechanics.

33
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:12,088
It's probably more famous for having a Kickstarter funding goal of $1.

34
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:19,675
I am in the Guinness Book of World Records video game edition for the highest percentage

35
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,737
funded Kickstarter project.

36
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:23,759
Some insane percentage.

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,265
It raised $40,000, which is not much compared to the budget of Spider-Man 2.

38
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:32,647
It did not do well.

39
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:35,969
It got mixed reviews to

40
00:02:36,149 --> 00:02:36,669
be kind.

41
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,371
And so I've got some imposter syndrome going on right now.

42
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,892
It's like do I really should I really get up here and talk about how

43
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:45,434
to make a swinging game when some some people

44
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:46,854
really didn't like Energy Hook.

45
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:50,736
That said.

46
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:54,923
Let me tell you the story about,

47
00:02:54,943 --> 00:02:58,185
oh actually, let me, sorry, getting ahead of myself.

48
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,187
Speaking of EnergyHook, I have open sourced it.

49
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:02,649
I just set this up yesterday.

50
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:05,771
I took all the stuff in the project

51
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,552
that I'm not allowed to share, took it out,

52
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:10,394
put the bulk of the project up here.

53
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:11,935
If you go down to the bottom of the page,

54
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:14,677
energyhookgame.com, you can start downloading

55
00:03:14,717 --> 00:03:17,039
the EnergyHook Unity project now

56
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:18,560
and play with some of these.

57
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,980
I'm glad you guys are excited about that.

58
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,321
And then you can start playing with the ideas you would talk about.

59
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:31,102
If anybody wants to use that source code to violate a certain famous intellectual IP,

60
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:32,142
I can't stop you.

61
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,883
Bad news, I did not get it up to Unity 2018.

62
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:42,344
It's still in Unity 5, so if anybody wants to do that for me,

63
00:03:43,464 --> 00:03:44,805
let me know and I'll put that up instead.

64
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:56,628
Anyways, the story is that when I was at Treyarch, I was lead programmer, Spider-Man 1, things

65
00:03:56,648 --> 00:03:58,690
had been going along and I wasn't happy with the swinging.

66
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,111
It didn't feel like Spider-Man to me.

67
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:05,135
And this was, and so I would come in late at night and try to make my own ideas, make

68
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:09,439
my own prototypes, and eventually those prototypes took on a life of their own.

69
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,261
And by the time Spider-Man 2 rolled around, we were able to...

70
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:16,845
keep iterating on those and eventually end up with what is now, you know,

71
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:21,528
considered a classic game. And up until last year when the Insomniac guys made

72
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:25,892
made their Spider-Man game, it was the reigning champion of Spider-Man games.

73
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:33,537
So 15 years, pretty good run. And let me get into it. I am mostly going to talk

74
00:04:33,597 --> 00:04:40,082
about intrinsic motivation today. And extrinsic motivation is playing

75
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,381
playing the game or doing a thing

76
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:46,281
because you're getting some kind of reward,

77
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:50,362
like money, levels, unlocks, in-game currency

78
00:04:50,402 --> 00:04:52,583
to buy new stuff, achievements, leaderboards.

79
00:04:53,643 --> 00:04:56,344
Extrinsic motivation can be easier to talk about.

80
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:59,105
It's easier to analyze, it's easier to tweak parameters

81
00:04:59,185 --> 00:05:01,265
and see if your customers are coming back or not.

82
00:05:02,806 --> 00:05:03,106
And so,

83
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:06,678
And it's what people, it's generally what people talk about

84
00:05:06,718 --> 00:05:08,299
when they talk about gamification,

85
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,001
taking things and adding game elements to them.

86
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:12,462
They're talking about adding leveling systems.

87
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:15,264
What they're not talking about is

88
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:18,567
Jesse Schell's definition of fun,

89
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:20,648
which is doing things because we don't have to.

90
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,011
That is intrinsic motivation.

91
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:26,173
That is, I am just doing this activity

92
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,054
because it is a joy in itself.

93
00:05:32,222 --> 00:05:34,003
Intrinsic motivation is harder to talk about.

94
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:37,124
It's harder to analyze.

95
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:40,366
It becomes more of an art than a science

96
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:42,107
when we start talking about intrinsic motivation

97
00:05:42,147 --> 00:05:46,268
and why is one activity more pleasant than others.

98
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,951
So we've got these Spider-Man games.

99
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,192
And this is back.

100
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,513
2000, there's one on the PlayStation where

101
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:01,555
swinging is kind of like jumping.

102
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,916
You jump from building to building.

103
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:05,158
Your webs are cosmetic.

104
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:08,661
Spider-Man 1, the game I first made,

105
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,924
swinging, you're flying through the air

106
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,106
and your webs are attaching to the sky

107
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:15,728
and the webs are just cosmetic.

108
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:17,469
And these activities

109
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:21,673
were kind of anemic.

110
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:26,028
They're kind of not doing it for us.

111
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:28,550
And then for some reason, Spider-Man 2 does it for us.

112
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,870
So how do we get there?

113
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:39,055
I'm gonna skip that.

114
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:41,937
I think it's a combination of some insights and some luck.

115
00:06:44,498 --> 00:06:49,281
We still need game designers to have insights

116
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:51,662
and to prototype those and to see how they feel.

117
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:53,912
And we need luck.

118
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:56,414
Like, I've made a bunch of prototypes over my career,

119
00:06:57,114 --> 00:07:01,277
and very few of them have had the impact of Spider-Man.

120
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:07,462
And so it's sort of a seat of our pants

121
00:07:08,142 --> 00:07:09,183
development system, right?

122
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:12,285
We're not able to say, oh, if we...

123
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:19,511
If we increase this number, then scientifically we'll get to this better experience.

124
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:21,352
It's more of a...

125
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,133
You make a prototype.

126
00:07:24,273 --> 00:07:25,394
You say, hey, will this work?

127
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:26,794
We try it, it doesn't work.

128
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:28,335
We try something else, it does work.

129
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:33,258
And over and over again, this process is sort of how we get there, and some people are going

130
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:35,059
to be more likely with this process than others.

131
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,381
One thing I can say though, is in this process

132
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:42,943
of making intrinsic, of attempting to make

133
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:44,404
intrinsically motivating prototypes

134
00:07:44,945 --> 00:07:46,466
and activities that people will just do

135
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:47,427
for the sake of doing them,

136
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,529
is to keep extrinsic motivation out of it.

137
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,492
It's tempting to start adding your score systems

138
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,535
and your achievements and your leveling up

139
00:07:58,055 --> 00:08:00,017
into these early prototypes,

140
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:03,760
but don't because A, that

141
00:08:05,332 --> 00:08:06,153
That corrupts your data.

142
00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:08,814
You don't know if people are coming back and playing longer

143
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,856
to get those points and the extrinsic rewards,

144
00:08:11,276 --> 00:08:12,337
or if they're doing it because it's a,

145
00:08:12,837 --> 00:08:14,098
if the core is a fun activity.

146
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:17,380
And B, the extrinsic motivation can actually

147
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:20,102
damage the intrinsic motivation.

148
00:08:21,323 --> 00:08:23,444
You probably heard, it may be an apocryphal study,

149
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:24,945
but you may have heard of the study where

150
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:25,966
there's two classrooms.

151
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,208
One set of kids draws for free.

152
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:31,049
The other set of kids is paid to draw.

153
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,290
And the set of kids that are paid to draw, the next day,

154
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,191
they don't want to do it anymore.

155
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:39,598
I tried to track down that study for this talk.

156
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:40,339
I couldn't find it.

157
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,901
It may be mythical.

158
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:45,165
And obviously, we all know from making games ourselves

159
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:47,888
and looking at analytics, when you add extrinsic motivators

160
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:49,670
to a game, it helps people come back.

161
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:53,848
But there's something powerful about that,

162
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:55,969
and it comes back to what Jesse Schell said about fun.

163
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:58,250
Once you start making it an obligation to play your game

164
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,551
because you're getting those goodies,

165
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:02,452
then people start talking about farming and grinding,

166
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:06,054
and they're doing it not because the intrinsic activity

167
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:08,675
is giving them joy, but just because

168
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,236
they're trying to get the next level.

169
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:18,020
So what turned out to work for us with Spider-Man 2?

170
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,322
So I'm here, I'm going, I feel like Spider-Man,

171
00:09:26,622 --> 00:09:28,403
this game is not satisfying me personally.

172
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:30,204
I think that's probably where a lot of you

173
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:36,546
can also find motivation to improve game mechanics

174
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:38,007
and make them more intrinsically satisfying.

175
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:42,389
And for me, the webs that attach to midair

176
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:43,249
were a big part of the problem,

177
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:46,751
but also it was just sort of the slow, sedate feeling.

178
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,884
Back then, I thought it was about realism.

179
00:09:56,905 --> 00:09:59,765
I thought, this isn't realistic.

180
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:01,466
This game should be realistic.

181
00:10:01,826 --> 00:10:08,307
And I'm lately learning that that's not what it was about.

182
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:11,388
It wasn't so much that people wanted realism, it's that

183
00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:12,748
people wanted to be Spider-Man.

184
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,685
When you imagine what it's like to be Spider-Man,

185
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,907
webs attaching to the sky is not part of the fantasy.

186
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,028
It violates the fantasy of being Spider-Man.

187
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:29,212
Because it turned out that there were a whole bunch

188
00:10:29,232 --> 00:10:32,013
of physical impossibilities that people are just fine with.

189
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:37,337
Gravity in Spider-Man 2 is about 10 times Earth normal.

190
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:39,118
That's the only way we can sort of.

191
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:46,196
make the speed of the game, the speed of Spider-Man, have sort of an exciting, dynamic feel.

192
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:51,098
Spider-Man can jump an amazing number of stories in that game.

193
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:53,679
It feels like he's not jumping as high as he is.

194
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:02,882
And Spider-Man can steer in mid-air, like in a lot of games, Spider-Man can steer in mid-air.

195
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:09,005
Here is a real-world situation where I'm at camp with my daughter on a rope swing.

196
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:10,990
Look at that!

197
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,590
Yeah!

198
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,693
Give me a hand up there!

199
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,916
Yeah!

200
00:11:18,016 --> 00:11:18,577
Video!

201
00:11:18,617 --> 00:11:21,339
Video is your seat!

202
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,722
I did not come as close to that tree as it looks like,

203
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:28,906
but I can tell you, I was not able to steer in mid-air.

204
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,981
And yet, in our video games, when we can steer in midair,

205
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:36,802
lots of games do it.

206
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,163
Spider-Man 2 certainly wasn't the first.

207
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:41,104
Although physics has nothing to say about that,

208
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:42,105
it just feels right.

209
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:47,468
I think it's a little like when you go bowling,

210
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:49,530
and you let that bowling ball go,

211
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,510
and it's heading towards the gutter,

212
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,492
and with your whole body, you sort of tense up.

213
00:11:52,532 --> 00:11:55,193
And it's like you think you can push that bowling ball just

214
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:56,214
with the effort of your mind.

215
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:57,915
Video games make that real.

216
00:11:57,935 --> 00:11:59,596
In general, people.

217
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:06,045
have, what's the word,

218
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:14,672
that our preconceptions about physics are often wrong.

219
00:12:14,712 --> 00:12:19,815
Like a child will assume that a heavier object

220
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,297
is gonna fall faster than a light object.

221
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:25,680
And we have these broken notions of physics.

222
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,881
And when a video game takes those broken notions of physics

223
00:12:28,842 --> 00:12:30,343
and gives them life in a virtual world,

224
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:32,204
it doesn't bother us.

225
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:43,931
Another good thing about Spider-Man 2 was we decided to do something that had never been done before.

226
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,938
The advantage of doing something like this is...

227
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,939
We gave game reviewers something to love,

228
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:56,980
and it's part of the reason, I think, that Spider-Man 2 was,

229
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,102
as people look back to it to this day, it's like, wow,

230
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:02,823
this came out of nowhere, there's nothing like it.

231
00:13:03,543 --> 00:13:05,825
Once I start to master this thing,

232
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,686
it's incredibly expressive.

233
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,064
But like I said, I made a bunch of prototypes over the years, and most of them,

234
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:19,868
although very few of them are maybe as unique as Spider-Man was,

235
00:13:20,188 --> 00:13:23,192
they're all unique, they're all, I want to do stuff that hasn't been done before, right?

236
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:25,975
And most of them don't resonate with people.

237
00:13:26,235 --> 00:13:27,196
So it's a huge risk.

238
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:31,981
Maybe the risk-reward is worth it in the long run? I am not sure.

239
00:13:36,368 --> 00:13:37,289
Let's talk with Flo.

240
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:42,133
Who here is familiar with Csikszentmihalyi's Flo State stuff?

241
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:44,435
Yeah, I figured a lot of you.

242
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:48,738
One of the hardest parts of this talk was learning how to pronounce Csikszentmihalyi.

243
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:53,782
There is a YouTube video, fortunately, with 80,000 views,

244
00:13:53,842 --> 00:13:56,485
that teaches people how to do it.

245
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,423
For those of you who don't know, what he calls flow is that feeling of being in the zone,

246
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:10,787
of intensely concentrating on something so hard that time sort of loses meaning and the

247
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:11,948
rest of the world goes away.

248
00:14:12,729 --> 00:14:17,051
It's something that a lot of games like to mine and benefit from.

249
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:22,012
One thing about the flow state, if it's too easy, you get bored.

250
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:24,914
The rest of the world comes back, time comes back.

251
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:28,977
And if it gets too hard, you get frustrated and stop.

252
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:36,844
We never had a problem, really, with people being bored.

253
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,564
of the Spider-Man swinging, the frustrating and too hard part was what we were sort of

254
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:48,426
constantly battling with through the life of the project.

255
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:55,776
Okay, sorry about this high-density information slide.

256
00:14:56,657 --> 00:14:57,577
There will not be a test.

257
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:01,719
So when I'm first thinking about Spider-Man

258
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,620
and getting ready to make that first prototype,

259
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,841
I'm like, okay, I have this idea.

260
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:08,642
I don't want the webs to attach to the sky.

261
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,403
I want them to attach to points in the world.

262
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:13,644
I want to be basically a bob on a pendulum.

263
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:18,386
But that is an insanely difficult problem

264
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:19,847
for players to play.

265
00:15:20,147 --> 00:15:21,428
We were asking players to.

266
00:15:22,394 --> 00:15:25,635
in a simulated 3D environment,

267
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:28,537
when they're given a certain trajectory,

268
00:15:29,257 --> 00:15:32,739
pick a point in the world to attach a rope to,

269
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:38,062
which will then give you the direction and speed

270
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:40,983
to end you up where you wanna be.

271
00:15:41,784 --> 00:15:45,426
Like, I can't think of a mass market game

272
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,847
that we intend millions of players to play

273
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:51,729
that has a mechanic that challenging.

274
00:15:53,257 --> 00:15:56,699
And so I think, okay, maybe there's some way

275
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:58,300
we can assist the players in doing this.

276
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,682
Existing at the time, we had the Quake grappling hook mod.

277
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:06,884
That was one example of movement and swinging together,

278
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:09,946
where you pick, where first person shooter,

279
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:12,047
you pick with the center of the screen crosshairs

280
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:13,968
exactly where you want your grappling hook to attach.

281
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:18,591
We also had Jak and Daxter, which had points in the world.

282
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:22,765
that were clearly marked that you could swing from.

283
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:25,708
It was a sub-game, a mini-game in Jack-O-Lantern,

284
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:26,808
just a tiny part of it.

285
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,713
I thought, well, maybe we can go somewhere between those.

286
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:36,516
Maybe we can have lots of points at intelligent places,

287
00:16:36,756 --> 00:16:38,077
corners of buildings, let's say,

288
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:42,340
that probably Spider-Man's only gonna wanna swing

289
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,401
from the corners of buildings, right?

290
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:47,944
You don't want to swing from the middle of the building

291
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:49,125
because you'll just run right into it,

292
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:50,566
but if you're always swinging from the corner

293
00:16:50,586 --> 00:16:52,588
and you're going parallel to the building,

294
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,832
you'll be able to use those points to slalom.

295
00:16:56,112 --> 00:16:59,976
That was my first prototype was going in engineering level

296
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,600
and marking certain points as ideal points to swing from.

297
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:09,186
And that prototype wasn't there yet.

298
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:12,059
that wasn't quite good enough.

299
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:15,861
It was good enough, with a couple other modifications,

300
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,441
it was good enough to sort of get to the point

301
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:19,142
of like, okay, let's keep investigating this.

302
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,022
Let's see if we can make a game out of this.

303
00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:23,483
But it had issues.

304
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,244
It's like, how come my web sometimes

305
00:17:25,284 --> 00:17:26,104
don't attach to anything?

306
00:17:26,624 --> 00:17:29,185
How come my web sometimes attach to this corner over here

307
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:30,906
when I thought they'd attach to that corner?

308
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:33,847
Tomo Moriwaki, the creative director,

309
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:35,528
and Eric Pavone, one of the designers,

310
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,989
said, well, let's just keep adding points to the levels

311
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:38,769
and see what happens.

312
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:41,605
And they found that the more points,

313
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:43,646
the more of these invisible points we added to the levels,

314
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:45,767
the less confused the player got.

315
00:17:45,787 --> 00:17:47,989
The more it's like, yeah, that's kind of where,

316
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:49,490
kind of in the general vicinity

317
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,792
of where I wanted my web to attach.

318
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,753
And so we carried that on,

319
00:17:56,314 --> 00:17:57,394
we carried that on all the way

320
00:17:57,434 --> 00:17:58,775
by then having a programmer say,

321
00:17:59,156 --> 00:18:01,517
okay, let's, what if,

322
00:18:02,257 --> 00:18:03,618
what if there's infinite points

323
00:18:03,638 --> 00:18:05,079
and we're just intersecting with surfaces?

324
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,721
Sending out rays, sort of like feelers.

325
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:11,896
where they intersect the surface,

326
00:18:12,777 --> 00:18:13,898
that's the point we swing from.

327
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:18,482
And we can bias the way the feelers go

328
00:18:18,582 --> 00:18:19,903
by pushing the joystick.

329
00:18:21,104 --> 00:18:21,645
Let's try that.

330
00:18:22,105 --> 00:18:23,086
And that felt really good.

331
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:29,832
We were finally at a point where it was less mysterious.

332
00:18:30,212 --> 00:18:31,933
You almost always had a point to swing from

333
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:33,034
unless you were above the buildings.

334
00:18:33,971 --> 00:18:37,174
And the point usually was around where you wanted,

335
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:40,818
and usually not stupid, usually not crashing you straight

336
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:41,218
into a wall.

337
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:45,618
After Spider-Man shipped, a game came out

338
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:50,142
called Bionic Commando Rearmed, sequel to Bionic Commando,

339
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,705
probably one of the very few 3D swinging games out there.

340
00:18:54,205 --> 00:18:57,228
They had a different solution, and they marketed their game

341
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:58,409
as more of a skill game.

342
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,311
They didn't actually call Spider-Man 2 out by name,

343
00:19:01,331 --> 00:19:02,832
but they said, this is a swinging game,

344
00:19:02,852 --> 00:19:05,955
and this one is about skill, like Spider-Man 2

345
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:06,655
wasn't hard enough.

346
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:11,439
And what they did was it was an over-the-shoulder.

347
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:19,825
aiming shooter, the center of the screen, where your crosshair was, would determine

348
00:19:20,205 --> 00:19:22,927
the vertical plane of where you attached.

349
00:19:23,487 --> 00:19:26,769
And it was sort of like, sort of like you're chopping down and where you're...

350
00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:31,935
and where your hand, where your invisible feeler hits an object,

351
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:33,095
that's the point you swing from.

352
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:36,757
So it was much more precise, and it was much more clear

353
00:19:37,097 --> 00:19:38,557
how you were picking points in the world.

354
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,778
It also did require a lot more skill.

355
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,519
I thought it was a very cool game.

356
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,580
As I understand it, it did not make a profit.

357
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,382
I don't necessarily think that's because it was, like, hardcore.

358
00:19:50,863 --> 00:19:52,883
I think it was mostly because it didn't have Spider-Man in it.

359
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,158
I mentioned Energy Hook.

360
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,889
I had a, and this, I can kind of, you can kind of visualize the way the beams work in

361
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:06,311
Spider-Man by playing Energy Hook.

362
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,237
My solution to sort of compromise between precision

363
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:13,820
and a lack of difficulty in energy hook,

364
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:16,182
is that in energy hook, this...

365
00:20:17,063 --> 00:20:19,304
A, I made the beams visible, the feelers visible,

366
00:20:19,725 --> 00:20:21,906
that are determining which points to swing from,

367
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:27,510
but B, the cone of feelers starts out very narrow and precise,

368
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,491
kind of like bionic commando rearmed,

369
00:20:30,072 --> 00:20:34,014
and then it expands as you hold the button down.

370
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:34,555
So...

371
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,071
skilled players, precise players,

372
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,212
pressing the button as necessary

373
00:20:39,832 --> 00:20:42,013
will target the things they want,

374
00:20:42,353 --> 00:20:44,414
and then if they have trouble finding a spot,

375
00:20:44,554 --> 00:20:45,935
eventually the cone widens up

376
00:20:46,235 --> 00:20:47,295
so it'll intersect with something

377
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:48,296
and you'll swing from something.

378
00:20:49,136 --> 00:20:52,757
Got a little video here to demonstrate it.

379
00:20:53,698 --> 00:20:54,738
There's the cone getting wider,

380
00:20:54,918 --> 00:20:56,019
just from a standing position.

381
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:57,499
Here it is in action.

382
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,681
So particularly with bridges,

383
00:21:06,178 --> 00:21:10,160
the narrow beams enable much more precision

384
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,200
than the feelers from Spider-Man 2.

385
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:21,544
And then when you're going next to a wall, the, sorry,

386
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:24,104
all tongue-tied, when you're going next to a wall,

387
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:27,145
the wider cone helps do the slaloming action

388
00:21:27,806 --> 00:21:29,506
that we're familiar with from Spider-Man 2.

389
00:21:37,418 --> 00:21:38,059
Let me hydrate.

390
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:52,283
So picking the right points in the world's not enough.

391
00:21:54,323 --> 00:21:57,244
Beginning players still have trouble with the game.

392
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:02,646
And so we ramp way back on how fast the player can move.

393
00:22:04,452 --> 00:22:06,535
how high he can jump, we increase air resistance.

394
00:22:08,475 --> 00:22:10,896
And this makes the game more accessible for the new players,

395
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,437
but it would make the game a little less interesting

396
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,278
for the advanced players.

397
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:17,359
So that's why, as you go through the game,

398
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:20,341
once you've demonstrated that you have the chops

399
00:22:20,401 --> 00:22:22,722
and you're ready for it, we allow

400
00:22:22,762 --> 00:22:27,224
you to have more speed, higher jumps, further jumps.

401
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:30,506
And in other words, we kind of introduce shopping to the game.

402
00:22:31,106 --> 00:22:33,227
Spider-Man could go into a little store

403
00:22:33,647 --> 00:22:34,708
and buy superpowers.

404
00:22:35,785 --> 00:22:38,887
I talked about how we shouldn't violate the super,

405
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,468
violate the Spider-Man fantasy,

406
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:42,130
and that kind of like violates it.

407
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,752
I can't imagine, you know, in a Spider-Man movie,

408
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:46,753
seeing him going into a store and buying superpowers.

409
00:22:47,253 --> 00:22:51,176
But the benefits this gave us in terms of

410
00:22:52,612 --> 00:22:55,815
Being able to ramp the players up slowly into the difficulty curve,

411
00:22:55,955 --> 00:23:01,419
sort of like acclimatizing them like lobsters into the challenge,

412
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:02,680
helped a lot.

413
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,944
There's a bunch of other valuable things about buying upgrades.

414
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:12,728
which is you get to learn the parts piecemeal

415
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:14,789
as you go through the game.

416
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:18,150
And now it's time we're adding extrinsic motivators

417
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:19,631
is actually kind of cool.

418
00:23:19,891 --> 00:23:21,572
We're far enough along in the project

419
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:24,273
that we feel safe about adding these things.

420
00:23:26,991 --> 00:23:28,172
Spider-Man 2 had a tutorial.

421
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:30,774
A lot of people complained about tutorials.

422
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:35,238
You know, perfect world, your game mechanic is so simple

423
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:38,360
or so well designed that people can learn it

424
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,221
without a tutorial.

425
00:23:40,702 --> 00:23:42,604
Some games though, you really want it

426
00:23:42,924 --> 00:23:45,266
and I've definitely found with a lot of my games,

427
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:48,508
I have a game I'm working on right now

428
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:51,971
where if I accidentally break the tutorial,

429
00:23:52,988 --> 00:23:54,930
I see it immediately in the game's analytics,

430
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,572
like session length drops, retention drops.

431
00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:00,714
I say, oh no, what did I do, what did I break?

432
00:24:00,754 --> 00:24:02,516
I look in, it's like, oh, I accidentally broke the tutorial.

433
00:24:02,636 --> 00:24:06,679
Okay.

434
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,242
So, some players are getting so frustrated

435
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,445
with the Spider-Man 2 and the Kleenex.

436
00:24:13,545 --> 00:24:15,186
Oh, everybody know Kleenex testing?

437
00:24:15,226 --> 00:24:16,727
Who doesn't know what Kleenex testers are?

438
00:24:17,488 --> 00:24:19,309
So Kleenex testers are testers that you bring in,

439
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:22,332
watch them play the game once, and then throw them away.

440
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:25,028
Will Wright's term, I think,

441
00:24:25,448 --> 00:24:28,650
and because they get poisoned.

442
00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:30,491
Once they start learning the mechanic,

443
00:24:30,832 --> 00:24:32,713
you can't have them see the mechanic again

444
00:24:32,753 --> 00:24:35,094
for a second time and say, oh yeah, cool,

445
00:24:35,114 --> 00:24:36,695
I fixed it because now they're able to play

446
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,736
because the reason they're able to play the second time

447
00:24:38,756 --> 00:24:40,217
is because they did it before.

448
00:24:41,698 --> 00:24:43,199
So some people are getting so frustrated,

449
00:24:43,219 --> 00:24:45,020
some of the Kleenex testers are getting so frustrated

450
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,842
playing Spider-Man, they'd see that next objective

451
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:49,363
and instead of swinging there,

452
00:24:50,512 --> 00:24:52,712
they would just stop and they'd run through the street

453
00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:54,693
to their next objective.

454
00:24:55,113 --> 00:24:56,053
We called it the running man.

455
00:24:57,594 --> 00:24:59,154
No offense to the Insomniac guys, you're still here.

456
00:24:59,174 --> 00:25:00,295
It still can be a problem.

457
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:02,515
My nine-year-old daughter, I was watching her play Spider-Man.

458
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:04,716
She swung a few times, and then she's like,

459
00:25:04,976 --> 00:25:06,356
I don't care, I'm just gonna have fun

460
00:25:06,396 --> 00:25:07,217
running through the streets.

461
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,298
Streets look much more cool in the new game

462
00:25:10,518 --> 00:25:12,198
than they did back in the Spider-Man 2 days,

463
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:13,999
so I can kinda see how you'd wanna do that

464
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:15,859
just to enjoy the graphics.

465
00:25:19,176 --> 00:25:25,959
So one of the best things we did when trying to get the players to learn the swinging system

466
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:26,379
was this.

467
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,580
Okay.

468
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,160
Hold up.

469
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,641
Last time I checked, you were still Spider-Man.

470
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:36,543
You know, fancy outfit, fights crime while swinging from building to building.

471
00:25:37,123 --> 00:25:38,063
So where's the swinging?

472
00:25:38,844 --> 00:25:42,025
If you're just going to run everywhere, then I'm going to be forced to say hurtful things

473
00:25:42,065 --> 00:25:44,846
that I'll regret later, and neither of us want that.

474
00:25:45,626 --> 00:25:46,307
So just swing.

475
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:48,868
It takes some practice, but I'm sure you can do it.

476
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:51,776
eventually with time.

477
00:25:54,357 --> 00:25:55,557
How many people don't know who that is?

478
00:25:57,298 --> 00:25:57,758
Nice.

479
00:25:58,879 --> 00:26:01,660
Yeah, so Bruce Campbell does the tutorials

480
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,001
and in between commentary, voiceover narration

481
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:06,582
in both the Spider-Man games I worked on.

482
00:26:07,303 --> 00:26:13,345
And a theme of this talk is actually

483
00:26:13,385 --> 00:26:16,667
what I would tell young Jamie, it occurs to me.

484
00:26:16,727 --> 00:26:18,648
Like young Jamie thought realism was important.

485
00:26:19,392 --> 00:26:21,895
young Jamie thought you shouldn't make fun of your players.

486
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:26,239
But here we found that if you make fun of your players,

487
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:27,541
we saw this in Kleenex testing,

488
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,302
they'd be doing the running man thing,

489
00:26:29,623 --> 00:26:30,904
we'd eventually detect it and say,

490
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:31,905
they've been running too long,

491
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:33,607
Bruce Campbell would give them crap,

492
00:26:34,248 --> 00:26:36,290
and they'd say, he's on to me,

493
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,351
and they'd start swinging again.

494
00:26:45,052 --> 00:26:47,274
Cheek set me high, stole the word flow,

495
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:49,296
and so now we can't use it

496
00:26:50,116 --> 00:26:53,499
when we're talking about games behaving fluidly.

497
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,761
So I'm gonna call that fluidity.

498
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,044
Sometimes people, I think,

499
00:26:59,404 --> 00:27:01,125
sometimes game definers conflate those two terms,

500
00:27:01,225 --> 00:27:02,006
flow and fluidity.

501
00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:04,428
So flow is being in the zone.

502
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:07,971
Fluidity is having a game that's curvy.

503
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:15,235
It doesn't stop you, jar you, it's not linear.

504
00:27:16,956 --> 00:27:20,217
I have no scientific evidence for this, but I think we just prefer

505
00:27:20,997 --> 00:27:23,518
curvy, non-linear things. I think that's why

506
00:27:24,098 --> 00:27:27,819
when we animate, we always use tweens, even if they're UI elements.

507
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:35,063
There's just something about a UI element coming in and gracefully coming to a stop

508
00:27:35,103 --> 00:27:41,786
rather than linearly coming in and jarring to a stop that we appreciate and that goes

509
00:27:41,847 --> 00:27:43,447
for our game mechanics as well.

510
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:50,351
So with Spider-Man, I had to retool some stuff.

511
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,653
The original Spider-Man engine.

512
00:27:54,207 --> 00:27:55,668
evolved from a game called Draconis,

513
00:27:55,688 --> 00:27:56,649
which was a fighting game.

514
00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:00,132
And all the animations drove the behavior in that game.

515
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:02,754
It wasn't like a lot of the shooters at the time.

516
00:28:02,854 --> 00:28:06,276
It was to move from one spot to another,

517
00:28:06,777 --> 00:28:10,439
we play an animation and then update the character's route.

518
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,621
So I had to turn that around.

519
00:28:13,462 --> 00:28:15,303
There were also lots of places in the engine

520
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:16,944
which just literally stopped the character,

521
00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:18,005
set his velocity to zero.

522
00:28:18,326 --> 00:28:19,767
That was a simple process of going through

523
00:28:19,807 --> 00:28:21,308
and commenting out a bunch of lines of code.

524
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,473
And things started feeling better there.

525
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:32,176
When Spider-Man would land on the ground,

526
00:28:34,658 --> 00:28:35,778
at first he would just stop.

527
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:36,899
That didn't feel as good.

528
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,941
When we took that velocity canceling thing out,

529
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:42,123
he lands on the ground, he takes a few steps.

530
00:28:42,943 --> 00:28:44,304
That felt a lot better.

531
00:28:45,545 --> 00:28:48,988
Another way we introduced fluidity, Spider-Man 1,

532
00:28:49,788 --> 00:28:51,710
Spider-Man automatically stuck to walls.

533
00:28:54,427 --> 00:28:56,568
you just brush a wall and he sticks to it.

534
00:28:56,688 --> 00:28:57,989
And in Spider-Man 1, that was great.

535
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:00,591
It was what we wanted, Spider-Man sticky.

536
00:29:01,011 --> 00:29:04,413
In Spider-Man 2, that would be really frustrating.

537
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:08,135
You're swinging along and suddenly, boom, you're stopped.

538
00:29:10,076 --> 00:29:15,179
So turning that off was one of the biggest things

539
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:16,920
that turned that initial crappy prototype

540
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,761
that didn't get greenlit into a game

541
00:29:18,781 --> 00:29:20,502
that we could continue exploring.

542
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:23,123
And then taking that,

543
00:29:23,827 --> 00:29:24,828
There was a problem with that though.

544
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:28,751
The problem being even when you bounce into walls,

545
00:29:29,412 --> 00:29:30,473
it still looks dumb.

546
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:33,836
Doesn't feel particularly Spider-Man-y or superheroic

547
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:34,937
to bounce into a wall.

548
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:37,519
And the way we dealt with that,

549
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,564
we didn't have any magical technology to prevent you

550
00:29:42,624 --> 00:29:44,465
from bumping into the walls in the first place back then.

551
00:29:44,726 --> 00:29:45,626
But what we did do is,

552
00:29:48,443 --> 00:29:51,785
is a play cool-looking animations when you did hit a wall.

553
00:29:52,186 --> 00:29:54,167
Little surfer moves, your hands on the wall,

554
00:29:54,187 --> 00:29:56,289
you do a spin, your feet run along the wall

555
00:29:56,309 --> 00:29:57,570
for a little bit, and suddenly,

556
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,752
even though the game mechanics are exactly the same,

557
00:30:01,212 --> 00:30:02,293
physics are exactly the same,

558
00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:04,835
character's motion, trajectory, velocity all the same,

559
00:30:05,315 --> 00:30:06,176
suddenly it feels good.

560
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:07,617
It's like, yeah, I meant to do that.

561
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,420
We took it even further later

562
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,601
when we brought in the wall running.

563
00:30:23,374 --> 00:30:27,156
And you can just see how that wall running,

564
00:30:28,297 --> 00:30:34,600
it's like you can sort of imagine this continuous looping

565
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:40,843
thread through the world as you traverse the level.

566
00:30:42,984 --> 00:30:47,026
And that feels so much better than a janky angular motion.

567
00:30:53,544 --> 00:30:58,686
I was, young Jamie was really afraid of just how hard the game was to control even after

568
00:30:59,106 --> 00:31:02,388
all the effort we took to make it accessible.

569
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:06,838
And as I'm thinking about this talk,

570
00:31:06,858 --> 00:31:08,399
we had a snow day up in Washington.

571
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,560
We had a bunch of snow days up in Washington

572
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,942
a few weeks back, and I went out with my daughter.

573
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:18,343
We were on our saucer sleds going down the hill.

574
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,684
Saucer turns backwards, as saucer sleds do.

575
00:31:21,204 --> 00:31:22,325
I can't see where I'm going.

576
00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:24,386
It's scary, I don't know what I might hit.

577
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:25,866
But it was also fun as hell.

578
00:31:26,647 --> 00:31:28,988
And a lot of people came up to me after Spider-Man 2

579
00:31:29,408 --> 00:31:30,068
and said, you know, I...

580
00:31:32,063 --> 00:31:35,724
have trouble controlling it, I'll like swing and I'll go somewhere

581
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,005
and it won't be where I intended to go, but I don't care.

582
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:42,106
I'm having fun. I don't really care where I end up.

583
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:48,347
And it suddenly clicks, oh yeah, this is what Richard Garfield

584
00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:52,168
and Greg Kostikian are talking about when they say how

585
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:56,009
uncertainty and

586
00:31:56,069 --> 00:31:57,430
randomness in games is important.

587
00:31:58,526 --> 00:32:02,069
Speaking of dumb young Jamie, I used to be like,

588
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:03,450
oh, randomness in games is bad.

589
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,711
Chess is the perfect game.

590
00:32:05,071 --> 00:32:07,473
It removes as much randomness as possible,

591
00:32:07,513 --> 00:32:09,034
so it's all about the player's skill.

592
00:32:11,716 --> 00:32:15,779
And it wasn't until later, hanging out with Richard

593
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:19,061
and reading Greg's book, that first book,

594
00:32:19,101 --> 00:32:19,942
Luck in Games, by the way,

595
00:32:19,962 --> 00:32:21,202
is required reading for game designers.

596
00:32:24,085 --> 00:32:27,391
where they pointed out that randomness actually

597
00:32:27,671 --> 00:32:28,693
is what games are all about.

598
00:32:28,733 --> 00:32:30,816
Uncertainty is what games are all about.

599
00:32:31,397 --> 00:32:35,283
Greg goes as far to say that uncertainty is pretty much

600
00:32:35,323 --> 00:32:36,565
what makes games game.

601
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,519
It's not a series of interesting,

602
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,581
it doesn't have to be a series of interesting decisions.

603
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:45,823
Candyland is not a series of interesting decisions,

604
00:32:46,143 --> 00:32:47,384
but it's still a game, it's still,

605
00:32:47,704 --> 00:32:49,665
you're playing Candyland and you don't know

606
00:32:49,705 --> 00:32:50,686
if you're gonna win or lose,

607
00:32:51,226 --> 00:32:54,388
and that uncertainty can keep you going to the end

608
00:32:54,468 --> 00:32:56,429
just to find out the answer to that question.

609
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:02,673
The challenge for game designers at this point becomes

610
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,061
How do we control that uncertainty?

611
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:09,242
How do we get it to the point where it is possible to master,

612
00:33:09,262 --> 00:33:14,644
where we don't have players going, this game is too random,

613
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:18,006
but still keep that feeling of life

614
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,167
and feeling of not knowing what's going to happen there.

615
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:27,170
Final thing, cosmetics, more required reading,

616
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,431
read Steve Swink's Game Feel

617
00:33:29,731 --> 00:33:32,072
and Martin Jonasson's and Petri Berho's

618
00:33:32,192 --> 00:33:34,513
Juice It or Lose It GDC talk.

619
00:33:36,274 --> 00:33:42,296
Young Jamie, very into just the math of things.

620
00:33:43,117 --> 00:33:49,361
Like, Young Jamie probably would have thought that Spider-Man 2 would have been just as

621
00:33:49,381 --> 00:33:56,886
fun if you were just a sphere on a line segment navigating through a world of colored blocks.

622
00:33:58,367 --> 00:33:59,508
Young Jamie was kind of dumb.

623
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:05,048
that would not have sold the Spider-Man experience.

624
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:07,351
To sell the Spider-Man experience,

625
00:34:07,531 --> 00:34:08,973
you need all the cosmetic stuff.

626
00:34:09,294 --> 00:34:13,018
You need particle systems, animations, audio,

627
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,803
motion blur, wind trails, camera changes,

628
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:18,566
all of these things.

629
00:34:20,465 --> 00:34:22,826
All of these things are there to sell the experience

630
00:34:23,086 --> 00:34:25,708
and make us start empathizing also with the hero.

631
00:34:25,748 --> 00:34:27,829
Suddenly we feel the danger the hero feels.

632
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,950
You wouldn't feel any danger if a sphere

633
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,072
or a pendulum bob falls from a great height.

634
00:34:33,632 --> 00:34:36,073
But when a human, even if he's a cartoon,

635
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:38,735
falls from a great height, you feel for him.

636
00:34:38,755 --> 00:34:39,575
You feel it in your gut.

637
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:42,096
I don't know why, but we have this empathy

638
00:34:42,136 --> 00:34:43,197
for the cartoon character.

639
00:34:45,238 --> 00:34:46,859
And the more we can sell that experience, the better.

640
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:50,602
Yeah, it's beyond the scope of this talk, really,

641
00:34:51,182 --> 00:34:54,543
but these two resources are great for it.

642
00:34:54,563 --> 00:34:59,284
But just as an example, just in the audio track,

643
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:03,485
we had the whoosh of being really high up.

644
00:35:05,225 --> 00:35:09,807
We had a whooshing sound that increased and decreased

645
00:35:09,827 --> 00:35:11,107
depending on the character's velocity.

646
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:13,688
And when you would boost your character,

647
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:15,308
there was also, on top of that, a whoosh.

648
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,981
noise for the speed boost.

649
00:35:20,942 --> 00:35:24,483
I'm going to finish with Insomniac's game.

650
00:35:26,844 --> 00:35:28,424
A journalist, Nick Robinson,

651
00:35:28,444 --> 00:35:31,645
AKA Babylonian, took some video of me playing

652
00:35:32,445 --> 00:35:35,847
the Spider-Man game for the first time. The new one.

653
00:35:38,047 --> 00:35:41,088
I'm going to play this a couple times, but you can sort of see the contrails

654
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:44,910
in that very first shot, and you can see the way the

655
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,710
camera gets closer and further away from you.

656
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,921
Oops, went the wrong way.

657
00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:58,524
And we did not have the technology to do motion blur

658
00:35:58,544 --> 00:36:00,665
like that back then, or at least it was not ready

659
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:01,465
for prime time yet.

660
00:36:03,526 --> 00:36:06,087
You can really, in this very final shot, you can sort of,

661
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:07,928
I don't think that's a video compression artifact.

662
00:36:07,968 --> 00:36:09,929
You can see the motion blur at work.

663
00:36:10,729 --> 00:36:12,610
All those things really do a great job of

664
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,551
selling the experience.

665
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:17,472
And the more graphic detail you have in the city, the more

666
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:18,173
it feels like.

667
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,277
Yes, I am a person.

668
00:36:21,398 --> 00:36:23,039
I am this many stories above the ground.

669
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:24,099
I am in danger.

670
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,280
I'm going to die.

671
00:36:28,722 --> 00:36:31,524
And so that, in a nutshell, is a lot of the things

672
00:36:31,644 --> 00:36:33,605
I learned while working on Spider-Man 2.

673
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:41,049
I will leave you here with one last bit from Bruce Campbell

674
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:42,170
and then we can have questions.

675
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:44,251
Well, hang on.

676
00:36:44,712 --> 00:36:45,532
Stop the music.

677
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:46,413
Cut.

678
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,152
Okay, you and me, we need to have some words.

679
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:51,492
The swinging.

680
00:36:52,372 --> 00:36:52,553
What?

681
00:36:53,073 --> 00:36:53,673
You don't like it?

682
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:55,474
You think you're too good for it?

683
00:36:56,654 --> 00:36:58,094
Maybe like not good enough, right?

684
00:36:58,795 --> 00:36:59,475
Is it the pressure?

685
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:01,676
You got a little performance anxiety going on?

686
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:03,116
Well, that's all right.

687
00:37:03,276 --> 00:37:05,597
Now, personally, I don't know anything about that,

688
00:37:05,637 --> 00:37:06,477
but I've heard it's rough.

689
00:37:07,244 --> 00:37:09,525
Anyway, let's ease up on you for a little bit.

690
00:37:09,565 --> 00:37:12,628
Just slow everything down, take away the pressure.

691
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:13,088
Just breathe.

692
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:14,269
Just get to class in your own good time, OK?

693
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:15,931
So yeah, you guys have any questions?

694
00:37:15,951 --> 00:37:15,991
OK.

695
00:37:16,011 --> 00:37:16,291
Thanks a lot.

696
00:37:16,311 --> 00:37:16,511
Thanks.

697
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:17,072
Thank you all for coming.

698
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:17,492
I appreciate it.

699
00:37:17,512 --> 00:37:17,712
Thank you.

700
00:37:17,752 --> 00:37:17,872
Hi.

701
00:37:17,892 --> 00:37:17,932
OK.

702
00:37:20,695 --> 00:37:20,895
Thank you.

703
00:37:20,915 --> 00:37:21,035
Thanks.

704
00:37:21,055 --> 00:37:21,235
All right.

705
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:21,475
Bye.

706
00:37:21,495 --> 00:37:21,615
Thanks.

707
00:37:21,695 --> 00:37:21,795
Bye.

708
00:37:21,815 --> 00:37:21,876
Bye.

709
00:37:21,896 --> 00:37:21,956
Bye.

710
00:37:21,996 --> 00:37:22,056
Bye.

711
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:22,176
Bye.

712
00:37:22,236 --> 00:37:22,436
Thanks.

713
00:37:22,456 --> 00:37:32,004
Bye.

714
00:37:32,024 --> 00:37:32,084
Bye.

715
00:37:32,104 --> 00:37:32,144
OK.

716
00:37:32,164 --> 00:37:32,224
Bye.

717
00:37:32,244 --> 00:37:32,304
Bye.

718
00:37:32,324 --> 00:37:32,404
Bye.

719
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:32,484
Bye.

720
00:37:32,504 --> 00:37:32,905
Thank you.

721
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:33,045
Thanks.

722
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:33,125
Bye.

723
00:37:34,236 --> 00:37:36,598
So I teach at a university in the Netherlands,

724
00:37:37,178 --> 00:37:39,939
and one of the things I've been trying to do

725
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,661
while I'm here is pick up some tips

726
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:46,383
on how to get our students to be a little more creative,

727
00:37:46,563 --> 00:37:48,364
because we're like laser focused

728
00:37:48,404 --> 00:37:49,625
on putting people into the industry,

729
00:37:50,265 --> 00:37:52,366
and the result is being great

730
00:37:52,506 --> 00:37:53,727
for what we were trying to achieve,

731
00:37:53,887 --> 00:37:56,648
but like their ideas are getting a little more risk-averse.

732
00:37:57,229 --> 00:37:58,570
And there was something you said there that,

733
00:37:59,516 --> 00:38:01,717
Extrinsic motivation is kind of easier to balance

734
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:04,739
and parameterize than intrinsic motivation.

735
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,401
And I'm wondering if you feel like maybe,

736
00:38:08,922 --> 00:38:12,324
you know, we picked up the Ubisoft rational game design

737
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:15,046
stuff and we started implementing that.

738
00:38:15,206 --> 00:38:17,808
So there's a lot of information out there

739
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,289
on how to balance and how to break your game down.

740
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,111
But the more you're talking about that,

741
00:38:23,131 --> 00:38:26,033
the more I was realizing that's all extrinsic motivators.

742
00:38:26,233 --> 00:38:27,694
How do you structure things?

743
00:38:27,754 --> 00:38:28,935
How do you guide the player?

744
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:33,121
Do you think maybe we're getting so good at extrinsic motivation,

745
00:38:33,882 --> 00:38:36,624
we're not spending enough time exploring

746
00:38:36,704 --> 00:38:39,367
what we can do to get more intrinsic motivation in there?

747
00:38:41,508 --> 00:38:46,113
So the question is, has, I guess,

748
00:38:46,233 --> 00:38:48,915
our obsession with gamification and extrinsic motivation,

749
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:52,258
is that one of the many things that sort of hurts creativity?

750
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:55,541
I don't know.

751
00:38:55,561 --> 00:39:00,943
I mean, I personally feel, after seeing

752
00:39:01,683 --> 00:39:03,164
a lot of the interesting game mechanics

753
00:39:03,664 --> 00:39:06,285
fail to be financially successful,

754
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:10,246
I think a lot of the risk aversion is just from,

755
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:12,046
we tried that and it didn't work.

756
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:13,447
Let's do something safe.

757
00:39:13,627 --> 00:39:15,607
Let's make a Battle Royale clone.

758
00:39:19,263 --> 00:39:21,624
But, you know, that said, though, that's not safe either,

759
00:39:21,684 --> 00:39:23,984
because then people just say, oh, been there, done that.

760
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:28,746
That it's also a huge risk to try to slavishly copy

761
00:39:28,786 --> 00:39:29,326
something else.

762
00:39:29,806 --> 00:39:33,187
So, yeah, game making is hard.

763
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:36,248
That's cool, though.

764
00:39:36,368 --> 00:39:38,028
It's cool that you're trying to push for creativity.

765
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:48,019
Hi, so one of the other things I really liked about the game

766
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:49,620
was the combat mechanics and such.

767
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,582
And so grabbing people, putting them in a web,

768
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:55,324
hanging them on a street lamp, and then a human punching

769
00:39:55,364 --> 00:39:55,904
bag or something.

770
00:39:57,485 --> 00:39:59,847
But did you work on that at all?

771
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:01,608
And then if you did, did that ever

772
00:40:01,628 --> 00:40:05,170
kind of evolve over the course of the project and evolve

773
00:40:05,991 --> 00:40:08,873
from the new web-swinging mechanics and such?

774
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:11,625
Spider-Man 2 combat mechanics.

775
00:40:11,665 --> 00:40:14,626
So I was definitely not as intimately involved with those

776
00:40:14,786 --> 00:40:17,787
as I was with the swinging.

777
00:40:19,747 --> 00:40:20,907
And how did they evolve?

778
00:40:21,007 --> 00:40:24,968
Just like the rest of the game, they did evolve as we go.

779
00:40:26,029 --> 00:40:28,329
One of my favorite stories about it

780
00:40:28,689 --> 00:40:35,531
was games with two punch buttons or a slow attack, fast attack.

781
00:40:36,626 --> 00:40:38,126
were very popular back then.

782
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:42,587
And most action games had that.

783
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:44,467
And so Activision was like,

784
00:40:45,448 --> 00:40:47,428
a higher ups at Activision were like,

785
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:48,808
why don't you have more attack buttons?

786
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:51,569
Like, this isn't a real game.

787
00:40:51,609 --> 00:40:52,789
It's only got the one punch.

788
00:40:54,229 --> 00:40:56,630
And we had to work back and forth with them on that.

789
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:59,330
And that's sort of where combos

790
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,991
with the web attack button and the punch button

791
00:41:04,664 --> 00:41:09,914
came from was like how can we get a breadth of different attacks and moves and animations

792
00:41:11,737 --> 00:41:14,082
without wasting one of our precious buttons.

793
00:41:20,807 --> 00:41:24,708
You had mentioned adding extrinsic motivations

794
00:41:24,808 --> 00:41:29,989
behind the intrinsic flow of web swinging.

795
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:34,130
In that process, were there any unlocks

796
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,691
that you realized before or after the fact

797
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:38,932
would be good or bad?

798
00:41:39,132 --> 00:41:43,813
Like, for instance, some unlocks of certain speed values

799
00:41:43,853 --> 00:41:46,353
or something like that that you realized

800
00:41:46,534 --> 00:41:47,214
should have been?

801
00:41:49,853 --> 00:41:52,935
part, like included in the base, and then through testing.

802
00:41:52,995 --> 00:41:54,456
Could you stand a little closer to the mic?

803
00:41:54,516 --> 00:41:56,297
I'm missing some of what you're saying.

804
00:41:56,538 --> 00:41:57,638
Sorry.

805
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:03,882
Did you realize that there were some extrinsic motivations

806
00:42:04,803 --> 00:42:08,465
and unlocks added for the web swinging

807
00:42:09,305 --> 00:42:12,687
through testing that you re-added back

808
00:42:13,148 --> 00:42:16,069
as part of the base of the web swinging?

809
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:19,171
Because you mentioned speed and jumping and boosts and stuff

810
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:19,471
like that.

811
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:22,356
Right, so are you asking sort of like,

812
00:42:22,797 --> 00:42:24,718
is stuff, oh, we should make that power

813
00:42:24,758 --> 00:42:28,181
part of the core gameplay, that shouldn't be left out?

814
00:42:28,842 --> 00:42:29,162
No.

815
00:42:33,466 --> 00:42:36,889
Closest, closest thing to that,

816
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,773
actually yes, closest thing to that was not so much powers,

817
00:42:42,233 --> 00:42:45,236
but originally the city unlocked gradually.

818
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,660
like parts, zones weren't available,

819
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,001
a little like GTA 3 back then,

820
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:52,042
you couldn't get from the one island to the other island.

821
00:42:55,023 --> 00:42:58,765
And beyond just having a,

822
00:42:59,005 --> 00:43:00,265
and instead of having that staged,

823
00:43:00,565 --> 00:43:01,486
we went back to just like,

824
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:03,026
okay, here's the area for the tutorial,

825
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,787
and then once that's open, boom, you can go anywhere.

826
00:43:06,588 --> 00:43:10,129
That was one thing like that.

827
00:43:10,149 --> 00:43:13,971
But as far as like, oh, we really should have this,

828
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:16,552
I don't even remember.

829
00:43:17,233 --> 00:43:19,915
There were some tricks and stuff in the things that

830
00:43:20,176 --> 00:43:21,957
weren't really necessary for the core gameplay.

831
00:43:22,298 --> 00:43:25,260
And we left them to be things you unlock later and learned

832
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:25,681
about later.

833
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:26,201
Awesome.

834
00:43:26,221 --> 00:43:26,481
Thank you.

835
00:43:28,423 --> 00:43:31,806
Did you play the Mega Drive or Genesis Spider-Man?

836
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:32,467
It was a good game.

837
00:43:32,947 --> 00:43:35,910
I have not played any Mega Drive or Genesis Spider-Man.

838
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,031
It also had a good swing.

839
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:37,771
Did they?

840
00:43:42,017 --> 00:43:45,700
So I'm also a professor in game development,

841
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,482
and in my Intro to Game Development class,

842
00:43:48,522 --> 00:43:50,563
I actually use the Spider-Man 2 swinging mechanic

843
00:43:50,983 --> 00:43:52,965
as an example of all these different disciplines

844
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,526
coming together to make something

845
00:43:54,546 --> 00:43:56,607
that has a right, specific kind of feel.

846
00:43:57,207 --> 00:44:00,009
So my question is, because you talk about...

847
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:04,582
having animation, having sound design, having game design,

848
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:07,124
having all these mechanics and tech all coming together,

849
00:44:07,605 --> 00:44:10,007
how big was the team that actually worked specifically

850
00:44:10,207 --> 00:44:14,311
on the swinging mechanic, and how did you communicate

851
00:44:14,431 --> 00:44:17,755
the philosophy and approaches and the balancing

852
00:44:18,195 --> 00:44:18,755
to that team?

853
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:26,284
The question is, how big was the team that worked specifically

854
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:29,888
on swinging, and how did we handle communication

855
00:44:29,908 --> 00:44:30,628
within that team?

856
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:34,412
And I don't have an exact number.

857
00:44:35,493 --> 00:44:38,275
Dozens of people touched the swinging at one point

858
00:44:38,315 --> 00:44:40,037
or another during its evolution.

859
00:44:45,214 --> 00:44:48,178
One, where places where we thought communication

860
00:44:48,198 --> 00:44:51,681
were close, tight communication was essential,

861
00:44:52,282 --> 00:44:53,803
there were parts where we, yeah,

862
00:44:53,864 --> 00:44:56,867
we will put Jason Bear, who is implementing

863
00:44:56,907 --> 00:44:58,448
the coding side of the animation,

864
00:44:59,009 --> 00:45:02,252
right next to James Ackery, who is making the animations,

865
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:03,554
and they will...

866
00:45:04,614 --> 00:45:11,001
He will provide a pose and Jason Baird will integrate that pose and vice versa and making

867
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,743
that piece as a unit.

868
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:19,351
But then maybe you have something like audio which is a little more separate, a little

869
00:45:19,371 --> 00:45:22,454
more like here's Tom Hayes in his sound room.

870
00:45:24,649 --> 00:45:28,332
making the audio and then handing us the sound files later,

871
00:45:28,713 --> 00:45:31,715
which Jason or somebody implements.

872
00:45:32,676 --> 00:45:34,857
Yeah, all over the place.

873
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:36,699
Hard to have a good, tight answer.

874
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:37,780
We're flexible.

875
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:38,861
