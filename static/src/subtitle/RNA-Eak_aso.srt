1
00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:07,053
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:09,074
Welcome.

3
00:00:09,855 --> 00:00:12,296
So I came here two years ago, and I

4
00:00:12,357 --> 00:00:14,138
spoke about my edible tabletop games.

5
00:00:14,158 --> 00:00:15,759
That's games you have to eat to play.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,301
And two years ago, I had six games.

7
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:21,923
I now have 13 games.

8
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:24,425
So the key thing about all of them

9
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:25,746
is you have to eat to play.

10
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:27,567
And it's not meant to be a gimmick.

11
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,669
It's meant to be a core part of the gameplay.

12
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,233
So I've put these 13 games into a cookbook that I successfully kick started last year.

13
00:00:35,373 --> 00:00:38,134
Yay. Still time to back.

14
00:00:41,136 --> 00:00:43,718
But we're here to talk about experimental gameplay, right?

15
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,340
In fact, for me, that is experimental food gameplay.

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,122
So since food and eating is such a key part of my games,

17
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:56,546
I've had to play with the food itself and playing with the food changes the gameplay of the game.

18
00:00:56,586 --> 00:00:59,347
It makes it more difficult sometimes, it can be different.

19
00:00:59,447 --> 00:00:59,928
So these are...

20
00:01:00,348 --> 00:01:01,689
some of my experiments,

21
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:03,631
and I'm going to try to talk about

22
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:06,233
what has gone right and what has gone wrong.

23
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:08,294
So first up, I want to talk

24
00:01:08,374 --> 00:01:10,456
about this game called Highty Assassin.

25
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:12,197
In Highty Assassin, it's

26
00:01:12,237 --> 00:01:14,039
a social deduction game for three players.

27
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,261
You get assigned your role by eating an item,

28
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:19,623
and then you have to work out who you can trust.

29
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:21,925
Now, the thing is that people didn't

30
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:23,146
actually trust their taste buds

31
00:01:23,186 --> 00:01:24,347
enough and couldn't trust their flavor.

32
00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:26,729
So we had to add color in as well.

33
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:29,131
So there's color and flavor to work out what your role is.

34
00:01:30,538 --> 00:01:32,439
All right, next up I'm going to talk about a game,

35
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,339
Gingerbread Friends.

36
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:36,140
In Gingerbread Friends, you ask a group

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,201
a set of tough questions, and then you have to guess

38
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:40,641
how they'll respond, what the majority will say.

39
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:43,482
If you're right, you get to pull over a lid,

40
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,923
and underneath there might be a prize.

41
00:01:45,203 --> 00:01:46,563
So, let's go to a demo.

42
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:52,845
All right, so underneath might be a prize.

43
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:54,726
Here we go, so I don't know if you can show

44
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:56,166
that there's a little prize in here,

45
00:01:56,186 --> 00:01:57,906
so I'm like, yay, I got a prize, woo-hoo.

46
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:00,227
But, whatever.

47
00:02:01,063 --> 00:02:04,784
Or I might get information about where there is a prize.

48
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:07,524
For example, here, there's a little piece of paper

49
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:08,265
that says one.

50
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:11,225
Now, you'll notice I've just pulled off two lids,

51
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:12,526
and I haven't eaten these.

52
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:15,286
I don't actually need to eat these to play this game.

53
00:02:15,306 --> 00:02:16,547
So I'm like, well, that's no good.

54
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:18,027
I'm going to have to change that.

55
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:21,748
So I added frosting to the bottom.

56
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:24,549
So I'm going to now, uh-uh.

57
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:27,429
Ah.

58
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,470
I'm going to lick it.

59
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:30,743
This actually has turned out all right.

60
00:02:30,763 --> 00:02:32,923
You can kind of read it well, not on that thing.

61
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:34,244
But you can kind of see what it says.

62
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:36,445
To me, it kind of kept getting very smudged

63
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:37,465
when I was practicing a lot.

64
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:38,305
So I'm like, that's no good.

65
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:42,787
So I tried another option, this one, again, frosting.

66
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:49,349
Underneath here, it's a bit difficult to see,

67
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,509
but is royal icing.

68
00:02:50,529 --> 00:02:53,390
Because royal icing sets harder than frosting.

69
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,451
So I'm playing with those properties.

70
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:57,492
All right, back over here then.

71
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:09,382
This is how it looks in the game. There's like a set of symbols and stuff that you use and it's the key.

72
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:15,191
All right, next game. Next game is called Treasure Cake. Treasure Cake is meant as a kid's birthday party game

73
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:20,719
where you use a bubble tea straw to put it into the cake and try to find secret stashes of things.

74
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:24,558
The constraints of what this secret stash might be

75
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:27,519
is that it probably had to sit in a cake for maybe overnight.

76
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,320
And I wanted it to be obvious to all of the players

77
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,741
that they had discovered something.

78
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:34,022
I didn't want kids to lie, and I wanted it to be a fun,

79
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:35,443
oh my, I found a thing.

80
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:37,124
All right, so demo.

81
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:44,307
AUDIENCE LAUGHS

82
00:03:44,647 --> 00:03:44,888
Uh oh.

83
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:45,848
Mm. Uh oh.

84
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:48,009
NOAH LAUGHS

85
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:50,210
First offer said, mm-hm, this is gonna come out.

86
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:54,802
I would like pop rocks.

87
00:03:55,163 --> 00:03:56,824
So I've got a bunch of pop rocks in my mouth.

88
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:58,705
Seems like a good idea.

89
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:01,227
But the problem is you have to store it

90
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:03,929
in cream probably, in the cake.

91
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,511
You can't just store a bunch of pop rocks by itself.

92
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:09,033
I'm still popping, so I won't be able to show you

93
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:12,096
that if I eat this, you end up,

94
00:04:13,257 --> 00:04:14,117
it won't pop anymore.

95
00:04:14,197 --> 00:04:16,299
So that's no good.

96
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:20,162
So I came up with another solution, which is this one.

97
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,608
So it turned my tongue bright blue and potentially the rest of my face.

98
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:40,383
And that's what I ended up using in the game. It's recommending that you use blue food dye.

99
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:41,634
All right.

100
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:44,136
Next game is a game called Flip and Stick.

101
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:47,398
It's about there's a bunch of cookies

102
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:48,999
with peanut butter on them.

103
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,021
And you've got to throw items at them and see what sticks.

104
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:55,283
So part of it is you then flip it upside down

105
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:57,325
and see if all of the items stay on board.

106
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:00,287
So the key thing in this game is the glue,

107
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:02,288
what you're putting on top, to see how that works.

108
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:04,690
So back again to the demo station.

109
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:09,866
Here we go. So I've got a few options here. I've got some frosting over here.

110
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:13,709
I'm not very good at throwing, so we'll see. And that kind of worked.

111
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,711
And I've got some dip over here and some hummus over here

112
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:19,533
and some peanut butter over here.

113
00:05:20,313 --> 00:05:22,855
So you can kind of see they all sort of stick a bit.

114
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:25,577
I mean, if I was further away, stuff might bounce a bit more.

115
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:27,038
It's going over to other spots.

116
00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:30,660
But the key thing now is like what happens when I flip them upside down?

117
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:33,502
So the hummus works well. That's great.

118
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,874
Frosting here doesn't work.

119
00:05:38,954 --> 00:05:39,695
That's a fail.

120
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:41,597
Peanut butter.

121
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:42,738
I mean, I had that in the picture,

122
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:44,440
so you've got to assume this is going to work.

123
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:46,001
Did.

124
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:48,044
And then like dip over here.

125
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:49,365
That's super goopy.

126
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:51,267
Oh, but it actually works.

127
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:52,048
There we go.

128
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:54,951
It's always a mystery sometimes with the experiments.

129
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:06,154
Okay next up is a game called Cookie Cruncher. In Cookie Cruncher there are a bunch of different

130
00:06:06,194 --> 00:06:11,297
cookies, obviously because it's called Cookie Cruncher, and you've got to put them strategically

131
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:16,199
on a board to get points. Now the catch is that you can bite these cookies to try to make them fit better.

132
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,339
So what sort of cookies am I going to use?

133
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,322
Let's go over here to the demo station.

134
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:28,586
So I'm going to start with an un-iced cookie,

135
00:06:28,686 --> 00:06:29,867
and you may not be able to see it,

136
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,749
but I've put a little line here on this cookie to

137
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:35,772
show where I'm attempting to bite it.

138
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:42,517
So let's try this. That worked pretty well.

139
00:06:42,817 --> 00:06:44,539
I was able to get it to the point that I

140
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:46,060
wanted it to for what I aimed to.

141
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:46,760
All right.

142
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:51,355
Now I'm going to try one with icing on it.

143
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:53,176
Let's see what happens with the icing on it.

144
00:06:57,438 --> 00:06:58,118
Uh-oh.

145
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:01,300
I've lost a part that has a point on it.

146
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,422
So now I'm losing points because the icing cracks and that goes all the way through it.

147
00:07:07,763 --> 00:07:08,903
Now I have some other ones here.

148
00:07:08,923 --> 00:07:12,805
I don't know if you can hear this on the mic, but they're shaking.

149
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:13,926
That's kind of weird.

150
00:07:14,186 --> 00:07:14,406
All right.

151
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:15,847
Let's try this one.

152
00:07:20,597 --> 00:07:24,820
What's happened now is I've got a whole lot of sprinkles

153
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,360
inside it.

154
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:27,282
And so if you play with this game,

155
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:28,563
you've got to be careful not to get

156
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:29,944
to the center with the sprinkles in it,

157
00:07:29,964 --> 00:07:31,025
because they'll all fall out.

158
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:42,774
So this is kind of how it looks in the book,

159
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:44,095
How to Make the Three-Dimensional Cookies.

160
00:07:44,135 --> 00:07:46,456
And I also have a version called Toast Cruncher, which

161
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:48,918
is with ham and eggs instead.

162
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,583
Oh, our final game, yay, I'm making good progress,

163
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:55,806
is a game called Flavor Roulette.

164
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,909
In Flavor Roulette, there's a bunch of items

165
00:07:57,929 --> 00:07:58,951
that all taste the same,

166
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:01,374
but one of them doesn't taste like the other.

167
00:08:01,754 --> 00:08:04,077
And you need to keep a poker face while eating these.

168
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:09,874
Now, coming up with the recipes for this is very difficult.

169
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:12,935
You want something that's slightly gross,

170
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:15,036
so that it's hard to keep a straight face,

171
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:17,237
but not so gross that you have to spit it out,

172
00:08:17,257 --> 00:08:18,397
because that's not really fair.

173
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:22,579
Spice is very difficult to deal with,

174
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,860
because people have very radically different reactions

175
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,640
to spice.

176
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,801
I can't really deal with much more than a mild spice,

177
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:31,002
whereas other people are like, oh yeah.

178
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:36,290
So I am now going to torture myself up on stage.

179
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:43,273
The ratio here is more than one of these being bad.

180
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:45,314
And I am going to try to eat it.

181
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:47,896
And then you're going to hopefully try to guess whether

182
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,316
I got a good one or a bad one.

183
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:56,140
Mmm-hmm.

184
00:09:01,563 --> 00:09:01,663
OK.

185
00:09:02,505 --> 00:09:05,046
Do we, I think we've probably got time for a show of hands.

186
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,426
Do we have, who thinks that that was a good one?

187
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,347
Okay.

188
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:11,968
And who thinks that was a bad one?

189
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:14,829
Okay, yeah, it was bad.

190
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:15,149
I've got...

191
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:20,070
That was like a bunch of like powdered cinnamon

192
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,991
and like my throat is like, my mouth is so dry

193
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:23,491
and I'm like, I gotta get some water.

194
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:27,633
So like, if you know, like if I was standing up here

195
00:09:27,673 --> 00:09:29,713
for longer, you would notice I would be grabbing water

196
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:31,614
very suspiciously and going,

197
00:09:34,256 --> 00:09:38,380
Okay. So that's all the demos I'm talking to you about today.

198
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,283
I've got 13 different games and they're all really different.

199
00:09:41,303 --> 00:09:43,205
There's still so much more that can be done with food.

200
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:45,587
So I hope other people experiment with food as well.

201
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:48,350
Hopefully, you'll get my book.

202
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,434
I'm about to hit order on those books soon. So thank you.

203
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:02,707
So I'm going to take a minute here and just make a comment

204
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:05,568
that when I first met Jen, she was working on,

205
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:07,989
I think it was a mobile title that you're working on?

206
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:08,589
Probably.

207
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:09,870
Yeah, she was working on a mobile title.

208
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,230
And I remember having a conversation with Jen

209
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,411
where she was like, well, I'm working on this game.

210
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:15,692
I'm working on it for a long time.

211
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:19,393
It's not really going where I want.

212
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:19,833
I don't know.

213
00:10:19,873 --> 00:10:20,874
I'm kind of running out of money,

214
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:22,274
and I don't know what I should do.

215
00:10:22,294 --> 00:10:23,815
I said, just don't finish it.

216
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:26,056
She's like, well, but I'm working on it for a long time.

217
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:27,156
Should we finish it?

218
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:28,277
I was like, you should do what you love.

219
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:31,358
You don't have to put all of your time and energy into something.

220
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:38,204
And she's up here eating cookies and licking icing off of game pieces.

221
00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:39,845
You fucking did it.

222
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:40,745
Congratulations.

223
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,246
It's amazing.

224
00:10:41,286 --> 00:10:41,646
Thank you.

225
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,106
Thank you.

226
00:10:42,126 --> 00:10:42,807
Thank you.

227
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:47,751
And there was literally no such thing as Edible Games

228
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:48,512
when I first met you.

229
00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:50,314
And now you've started a whole category.

230
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:51,875
So congratulations, John.

231
00:10:51,895 --> 00:10:52,816
You're an influencer now.

232
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:55,599
OK.

233
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,901
So next up, we actually have a video.

234
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,743
So this is Mohamed's game.

235
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:01,104
It is amazing.

236
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:02,225
I'm not going to say much more about it.

237
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,406
I'm going to let him talk about it.

238
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:05,328
He really apologized that he could not be here,

239
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:06,910
but he sends wishes from Montreal.

240
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,763
Hi everyone, my name is Mo, this is Jack.

241
00:11:12,244 --> 00:11:14,366
I'm a creative director at Artifact 5,

242
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:16,709
a small indie studio in Montreal, Canada.

243
00:11:16,729 --> 00:11:19,131
A few months ago, I saw this music video

244
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:21,814
called Lucky You by Eminem and Joyner Lucas,

245
00:11:22,635 --> 00:11:24,877
where they're followed by these characters

246
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:26,019
that copy their every move.

247
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,600
So I thought it'd be a cool idea

248
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:31,104
to start a project inspired by that called Lucky Me.

249
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,833
So Lucky Me is a puzzle shooter where townships hacks copy your every move,

250
00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:43,116
but sometimes you have to use their stupidity against them to survive.

251
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:48,020
The rules are pretty simple. You play as the character in yellow on the left here,

252
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,083
and the characters on the right with the red eyes just copy you,

253
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:53,045
and you gotta be the last one standing.

254
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,109
You can do the basics. You can aim and move.

255
00:11:59,571 --> 00:12:00,031
And shoot!

256
00:12:05,353 --> 00:12:12,496
course all the transitions are dabs. Of course it's not always that easy, sometimes shooting

257
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:16,038
one guy will get you shot by the other, so you gotta use their lack of original thought

258
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:25,302
to get them to shoot each other. Part of the challenge is to figure out the order of operations.

259
00:12:26,822 --> 00:12:29,083
Sometimes shooting the wrong guy first might get you killed.

260
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:46,838
So sometimes it's worth taking the time to line up the perfect shot so you can win in very spectacular ways.

261
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:23,257
So these little blobs at your feet are the ammo you have in your gun.

262
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,442
And sometimes you need to pick up additional ammo to finish the job.

263
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:52,607
The main challenge is not just watching where you go and what you do, you also have to keep

264
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:53,508
track of their movements.

265
00:13:54,548 --> 00:13:59,070
For example, here we're both out of ammo, but he has a bunch on his side, so you have

266
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,130
to make sure he avoids.

267
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:07,153
Oh crap, luckily he can't think for himself so I can waste his bullet and pick up mine

268
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:07,653
from over there.

269
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:23,680
Another strategy is to use the environment to place yourself in a better position where you can pick up the ammo.

270
00:14:30,606 --> 00:14:39,055
And there are a whole bunch of environmental hazards that can be very dangerous, or super fun.

271
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,210
And of course it wouldn't be a puzzle game without some spikes.

272
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:56,392
And we can just walk straight into it.

273
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:04,455
So this puzzle uses all the mechanics we just saw.

274
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:05,936
We're both out of ammo.

275
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:09,537
He has bullets on his side, but he has to get there without me running

276
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:10,458
into the spikes in the back.

277
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:13,619
So I have to use the environment to block myself while picking up the bullets.

278
00:15:25,787 --> 00:15:27,547
So Eminem has a warm spot in my heart.

279
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:32,870
I've been a huge fan of him since I was a kid growing up in Saudi Arabia where his music is banned.

280
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,371
I would have to go into underground markets to pick up his cassettes,

281
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:39,333
often while running away from the religious police.

282
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:43,775
Actually one time I got caught and arrested, but that's a story for another time.

283
00:16:20,185 --> 00:16:23,309
And of course, it wouldn't be a real M&M game without a real Slim Shady mode.

284
00:16:29,576 --> 00:16:32,199
In this mode, you play as a real Slim Shady who's standing up,

285
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,844
but with every shot, a new Slim Shady would stand up and you gotta figure out

286
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:39,947
who you are every round and be the last one standing.

287
00:16:48,532 --> 00:16:50,193
There you go, the last Slim Shady standing.

288
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:55,356
It would be so cool if Eminem got to see this game.

289
00:16:55,537 --> 00:16:56,777
It's my fan gift to him.

290
00:16:57,238 --> 00:17:00,380
So if you can tweet at him, hold a sign at his concert,

291
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,961
yell at him on the street, it would be a dream come true.

292
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:06,163
Also, if you're a publisher who's interested, drop me a line at the website.

293
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:07,404
Thank you so much.

294
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:17,061
So one of the things I wanted to point out

295
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,862
about this video in particular is that,

296
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:20,302
and I can sense it, right?

297
00:17:20,342 --> 00:17:22,442
There's this question of cultural appropriation

298
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:23,823
that we always have in the games industry.

299
00:17:24,063 --> 00:17:25,903
This is a different approach.

300
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:28,223
Thinking about what you make and how you make it

301
00:17:28,284 --> 00:17:30,084
and how it inspires you, and that not all the things

302
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:31,704
you see are gonna be exactly what you expect.

303
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:35,885
So next up we have Jiang Wu and Steph.

304
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:37,305
They're gonna be talking about.

305
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:38,826
What?

306
00:17:39,486 --> 00:17:40,306
Oh, sorry, and Alex.

307
00:17:41,586 --> 00:17:42,406
Introduced the wrong person.

308
00:17:42,506 --> 00:17:43,827
Talking about Lucifer within us.

309
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:47,226
Sorry. It's okay.

310
00:17:48,452 --> 00:17:49,115
In the meantime...

311
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,101
Hi, my name is Jongwoo, this is Alex.

312
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:59,083
We are from Kitfox Games based out of Montreal,

313
00:17:59,263 --> 00:18:01,906
and we are here to show you Lucifer Within Us,

314
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:04,167
which is an experimental mystery-solving game.

315
00:18:04,768 --> 00:18:06,810
This is a project that is currently unannounced

316
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,911
and still very much in the middle of development,

317
00:18:09,352 --> 00:18:11,674
so please try to keep it confidential.

318
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:15,277
I don't know how we're gonna keep a secret

319
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:16,998
between a thousand people in a room, but we're gonna try.

320
00:18:17,018 --> 00:18:21,062
Yeah, sure, well, technical difficulties.

321
00:18:21,082 --> 00:18:22,002
Always happens.

322
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:23,123
Always happens.

323
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:30,597
Lucifer Within Us is a unique kind of mystery solving game because it's not about just solving mysteries in the traditional sense.

324
00:18:30,617 --> 00:18:34,380
The protagonist is a digital exorcist in a futuristic theocracy.

325
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,303
So that gives us a couple of tools that normal characters would not have access to.

326
00:18:38,363 --> 00:18:43,588
So first we're going to begin by investigating the body of the victim in this case that happens in a graveyard.

327
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:50,443
We can see from the profile of the character that the victim was an art student, basically,

328
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:56,806
and that the body has a throat slit, which is the most likely cause of death.

329
00:18:57,127 --> 00:18:58,527
So this is where it gets interesting.

330
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:02,810
We are going to listen to the testimonies of three different characters that were present

331
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,311
during the events of the crime.

332
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:10,514
I would ask you to try and see if you can see any discrepancies between what the three

333
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:11,655
characters are saying.

334
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,902
So this first character was the victim's master, Lucius,

335
00:19:15,182 --> 00:19:19,346
and he claims that he arrived at the graveyard for a stroll,

336
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:24,049
and he basically was scrolling for most of the afternoon.

337
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:26,692
He sent his apprentice off, the victim, off on an errand,

338
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:28,813
but he doesn't really specify what that is.

339
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:31,475
And what's really interesting about the game right now

340
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:33,217
is that you're able to fully control

341
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,678
which section of the testimony you see,

342
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:36,479
and it plays out in real time in front of you.

343
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:42,762
Now, this is not reality. This is a subjective reconstruction of what the character is saying.

344
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:49,825
So the cone of vision illustrates what section of the screen that the character actually saw,

345
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:53,627
but even that might not be accurate. It's going to be full of inaccuracies,

346
00:19:54,347 --> 00:19:56,628
omissions, and outright lies even.

347
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,970
Anyway, so we're going to skip ahead to the late afternoon.

348
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,212
And he claims that someone was passing by,

349
00:20:03,572 --> 00:20:07,514
and then he strolled into the back fields, at which point

350
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:11,717
he found the body of his apprentice

351
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:13,218
in a freshly dug grave.

352
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:17,540
Then he called for help, at which point

353
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,002
he met the other two suspects of the case, which

354
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:24,544
is Abraham, the gravetender, and Nerissa, the embalmer.

355
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:27,668
So next we're gonna talk to Abraham

356
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,790
to see what he has to say about the situation.

357
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:37,695
So Abraham claims that he was standing and,

358
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:41,037
sorry, tending to the bushes outside the mortuary

359
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:42,438
for much of the early afternoon,

360
00:20:42,478 --> 00:20:44,279
from two o'clock to about three o'clock or so.

361
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,001
And then he headed inside the mortuary

362
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:50,063
to tell Nerissa, the embalmer,

363
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,544
that he was done with the tending

364
00:20:51,904 --> 00:20:53,545
and Nerissa dismissed him.

365
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:58,841
Afterwards, he headed through the mortuary to the front yard of the graveyard

366
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:03,903
and tended to polish the headstone that is very prominent there.

367
00:21:05,004 --> 00:21:10,046
And finally, in the late afternoon, he heard a cry from the backfield

368
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:15,569
and rushed over there to meet Lucius and the other suspect, Nerazzetti and Balmer.

369
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:19,406
So there's a couple of things suspicious here.

370
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:21,308
Like he's the grave digger, but he

371
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:23,130
claims to have never seen the victim

372
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,913
or never have dug that particular grave.

373
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:30,598
But we're going to move on to the final testimony, Nerissa

374
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:31,298
the embalmer.

375
00:21:33,186 --> 00:21:39,692
Nerissa claims that she and Abraham spoke in the early afternoon about the funeral and

376
00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:40,853
asked him to dig a grave.

377
00:21:41,273 --> 00:21:46,317
And then for most of the early afternoon, she was preparing the body for the funeral

378
00:21:46,678 --> 00:21:51,261
until Abraham came back to say that he had finished digging the grave.

379
00:21:55,662 --> 00:22:05,092
And then finally she went back to preparing the body until the end of the day when she heard a cry from the graveyard

380
00:22:05,112 --> 00:22:08,495
and then she rushed over there to find the other two suspects.

381
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,824
So it's really strange in that none of the three suspects

382
00:22:15,885 --> 00:22:18,048
have really seen where the victim was

383
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,271
after basically two o'clock or so.

384
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:22,574
But if you've been watching this carefully,

385
00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:24,577
you'll probably notice that there are

386
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:26,080
pretty clear discrepancies.

387
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,301
So we're gonna go back to Abraham.

388
00:22:28,183 --> 00:22:29,925
and point out something that we just learned.

389
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:35,473
Nerissa claims that they spoke at two o'clock about digging a grave,

390
00:22:35,513 --> 00:22:39,359
but Abraham insists that he was tending to the bushes.

391
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,323
So we're going to contradict him and unmask his lies.

392
00:22:42,984 --> 00:22:50,591
At which point, the testimony is modified to address the contradiction we pointed out.

393
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:56,477
So now he admits that, in fact, he did speak to Nerusa in the mortuary,

394
00:22:56,637 --> 00:23:01,081
and then he took the shovel and went to the backfield to dig a grave.

395
00:23:02,622 --> 00:23:06,106
All the same, he still insists that nobody came through the backyard.

396
00:23:06,506 --> 00:23:08,328
He was alone the entire time.

397
00:23:09,691 --> 00:23:14,215
And beyond that, his testimony remains exactly the same as it originally was.

398
00:23:14,555 --> 00:23:19,179
He claims that he talked to Nerissa, went through the front, and left.

399
00:23:21,181 --> 00:23:23,043
So we are going to have to find more information.

400
00:23:23,163 --> 00:23:26,326
So at this point, we're going to go back and do things the traditional way.

401
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:29,429
So we are going to investigate the crime scene.

402
00:23:29,969 --> 00:23:33,432
So we are going to head into the mortuary and see if there's anything we can find.

403
00:23:35,408 --> 00:23:40,091
And on Nerissa's table, you can find that there is a bouquet of flowers.

404
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:44,052
And the stems of the bouquet have fingerprints on them of the victim,

405
00:23:44,513 --> 00:23:47,734
which contradicts what Nerissa said about being alone in the mortuary

406
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:48,635
the entire time.

407
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,735
The victim must have passed through at some point.

408
00:23:51,736 --> 00:23:55,678
So we're going to go back to Nerissa and point this out to her.

409
00:24:10,168 --> 00:24:13,410
And now she admits that, fine, in fact, the victim

410
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:13,991
did come through.

411
00:24:14,171 --> 00:24:16,493
And you can see that indicated by the new marker

412
00:24:16,773 --> 00:24:17,694
on the timeline.

413
00:24:18,394 --> 00:24:22,157
So in the next section, she will show that, in fact, she

414
00:24:22,197 --> 00:24:24,739
did greet Isaac, the art apprentice,

415
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,800
and then showed him the bouquet of flowers

416
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,322
that he wanted to bring to his instructor, Lucius.

417
00:24:29,863 --> 00:24:34,646
But she claims that, in fact, Isaac did not take the bouquet

418
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:36,107
and left by the back exit.

419
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:40,390
Now if Nerissa is telling the truth, and if we take her words at face value,

420
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:46,334
there's a clear contradiction between what Nerissa claims that the victim left through the back exit

421
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:51,417
and what Abraham says, which is that nobody came through the back exit.

422
00:24:52,878 --> 00:24:59,983
So normally we'd be stuck in this situation, but we have one more power available to us as a digital exorcist.

423
00:25:00,623 --> 00:25:02,345
We are going to enter Nerissa's mind.

424
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,392
This is Nerissa's sanctum, which is a virtual representation

425
00:25:07,852 --> 00:25:08,813
of her psyche.

426
00:25:09,193 --> 00:25:11,335
The main area is always available to the player,

427
00:25:11,395 --> 00:25:13,997
but as you contradict a given suspect,

428
00:25:14,017 --> 00:25:16,780
their resolve weakens, and we can discover more secrets

429
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,722
about their past, their memories, and their possible motives.

430
00:25:20,723 --> 00:25:23,165
In this case, we find this worn bed,

431
00:25:23,985 --> 00:25:27,528
which reveals to us that Nerissa had an impoverished

432
00:25:27,668 --> 00:25:31,952
upbringing, and perhaps greed was a motivation

433
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,873
for the killing, or perhaps not.

434
00:25:34,954 --> 00:25:37,476
On the table in the main area, we can also discover

435
00:25:38,657 --> 00:25:40,478
the funeral schedule that Nerissa remembers

436
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:43,780
from earlier in the day, which reveals that Lucius,

437
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,962
the victim's master, was the one who organized

438
00:25:47,002 --> 00:25:48,483
the funeral in the first place.

439
00:25:48,843 --> 00:25:50,444
So maybe the whole thing was something

440
00:25:50,484 --> 00:25:53,366
that was orchestrated by Lucius.

441
00:25:55,248 --> 00:25:57,429
But that's a quick look at Lucifer within us,

442
00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:00,511
his subjective testimonies and investigation system.

443
00:26:00,972 --> 00:26:01,892
Thank you very much for your time.

444
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:15,719
Thank you.

445
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:16,479
Thank you.

446
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:22,260
So yeah, I'm a big fan of story games, and I love it when people do investigative work

447
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,321
on narrative systems, and I thought that that demo was really badass.

448
00:26:27,642 --> 00:26:30,502
So next up, we have a video, and this video is Miss Shapen.

449
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,763
And we're going to show it to you now.

450
00:26:49,637 --> 00:26:50,237
What was that?

451
00:26:51,738 --> 00:26:52,458
Oh, okay

452
00:26:53,938 --> 00:27:00,040
So what is Mishaven? Well, have you played Portal?

453
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:07,481
This is kind of similar but instead of having the power to make portals with your portal gun

454
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:12,982
Players will be able to provoke unrelented uncontrolled cellular growth

455
00:27:23,252 --> 00:27:27,472
Misshapen is an obscure physics-based horror first-person shooter

456
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:30,413
where you can't kill your enemies.

457
00:27:30,673 --> 00:27:35,874
Of course not, because we are against all that kind of violence.

458
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:40,955
Instead, you can reduce their mobility, distorting their bodies

459
00:27:41,015 --> 00:27:43,416
and creating creepy living structures with them.

460
00:27:50,357 --> 00:27:50,797
Players...

461
00:27:51,577 --> 00:27:57,688
may use these distortions to make traps, for example, or build complicated living contraptions,

462
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:04,600
and use these structures to reach places that they are not accessible in any other way.

463
00:28:28,362 --> 00:28:34,365
All of this will result in surprising scenarios and interesting emerging gameplay to tinker with.

464
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:41,088
The game is like, let's say, a macabre metroidvania.

465
00:29:03,044 --> 00:29:07,087
Is this a creepy shooter or is it a nightmarish builder?

466
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:08,608
Ok, whatever.

467
00:29:09,268 --> 00:29:17,593
This game is currently under development by Nico Saraytaris, Nicolas Arkabarren and Fernando Martínez Rube.

468
00:29:18,414 --> 00:29:20,675
An independent team from Argentina.

469
00:29:42,096 --> 00:29:43,057
Yay.

470
00:29:43,538 --> 00:29:44,518
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

471
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:45,119
Fantastic.

472
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:48,962
So I don't think we've ever seen an uncontrolled cellular

473
00:29:49,002 --> 00:29:51,844
building game in the Experimental Gameplay

474
00:29:51,864 --> 00:29:52,124
Workshop.

475
00:29:52,144 --> 00:29:54,626
I think that's a first.

476
00:29:56,057 --> 00:30:01,521
I think that's maybe another new genre discovered by this workshop.

477
00:30:02,562 --> 00:30:08,166
And so Likuo is here to present Karto, which I actually, I think I saw the first time at

478
00:30:08,726 --> 00:30:10,407
Tokyo Game Show this past year.

479
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:16,229
I was walking around looking at the games and sort of student and independent games showcase.

480
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:20,791
And I saw this game and I was so charmed by it that I asked if he would be interested in submitting

481
00:30:20,871 --> 00:30:25,572
and he did. So one of the other things that I can tell you about Experimental Gameplay Workshop is

482
00:30:25,592 --> 00:30:30,233
that it is a family affair and that when you're somewhere traveling, it doesn't really matter

483
00:30:30,253 --> 00:30:34,694
where you are, if there's games around, if there's a school that you visit, and there are some things

484
00:30:34,735 --> 00:30:38,876
that you think are interesting, you can always just say, hey, you should submit your game to EGW.

485
00:30:38,896 --> 00:30:39,596
And with that...

486
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:42,507
I will probably keep talking because we are growing.

487
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:42,948
OK, great.

488
00:30:43,728 --> 00:30:44,729
Here's Likuo with Karto.

489
00:30:48,331 --> 00:30:48,671
Hello.

490
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:51,613
Hello.

491
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:52,894
It's such an honor to be here.

492
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:56,016
My name's Likuo Chen, co-founder and game designer

493
00:30:56,536 --> 00:30:59,598
at Sunhead Games, a small indie game studio in Taiwan.

494
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:02,340
And here's our game, Karto.

495
00:31:03,787 --> 00:31:06,747
At first, it looked like a normal adventure game

496
00:31:06,807 --> 00:31:09,508
that you control a character and explore a land,

497
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:14,410
and you found a thing, a map,

498
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,750
and you can switch to a map view,

499
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:21,152
and you can move or rotate any tile on the map.

500
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:25,473
And when the two tile have the same type of border,

501
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:27,574
you can connect them together,

502
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,074
and when the map changes, the world changes as well.

503
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:32,815
And here's a new map piece.

504
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:38,334
and you can connect into the, sorry,

505
00:31:38,714 --> 00:31:41,197
to the existing map to expand map.

506
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,484
And you'll meet some people and you can hear their stories,

507
00:31:49,545 --> 00:31:50,787
but it's gonna take a while,

508
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:56,433
so let me skip some conversations at speedrun a little bit.

509
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:20,940
Is the music out?

510
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:28,042
Yes, can you hear me now?

511
00:32:28,082 --> 00:32:28,142
Yes.

512
00:32:28,162 --> 00:32:28,282
Okay.

513
00:32:28,302 --> 00:32:29,003
Anyway, I'll keep playing.

514
00:32:30,543 --> 00:32:35,525
And so sometimes you will meet people who need help, like this one.

515
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:55,827
So his house is east of the one on the grassland along the sea.

516
00:32:57,047 --> 00:33:05,389
And in order to find his house, you need to move this tile to here and you'll find his house.

517
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:36,336
And here's another puzzle.

518
00:33:37,157 --> 00:33:39,319
If I didn't skip the conversation before,

519
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,342
someone will say that there's a family living in the forest,

520
00:33:43,763 --> 00:33:48,086
however, you don't see anything beside this little boy.

521
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:59,336
So the reason that there's no house in this forest

522
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:02,119
is because there's actually two forest.

523
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:08,938
And the little boy said, there's only one forest,

524
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,220
so you have to combine the forests together,

525
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:18,463
and you will see a house.

526
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:41,034
so I can be linked.

527
00:34:41,054 --> 00:34:43,435
And this is how the game works basically.

528
00:34:43,975 --> 00:34:48,037
And based on this idea we take some experiments

529
00:34:48,177 --> 00:34:50,458
and there's other things we like to show you.

530
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,841
So for example, sometimes the tile could be hidden.

531
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:05,095
So you have to make the hole in a certain shape to find out the tile.

532
00:35:06,596 --> 00:35:07,216
Like this one.

533
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:19,983
Or sometimes you only have two tiles.

534
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:27,467
And in order to find a way out, you have to look carefully and...

535
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:32,124
try to find the correct way to follow the path.

536
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:34,285
For example, you see a symbol here,

537
00:35:35,146 --> 00:35:37,927
and you walk to here,

538
00:35:39,028 --> 00:35:41,749
and you continue doing so, you can solve the puzzle.

539
00:35:47,192 --> 00:35:49,413
Or sometimes you are in a maze,

540
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:55,416
and you can, the maze is not constructed by yourself.

541
00:36:11,686 --> 00:36:14,628
Or the tile is more than one layer.

542
00:36:14,988 --> 00:36:17,130
So for example, this is the ground level,

543
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:19,672
this is underground level.

544
00:36:20,253 --> 00:36:23,755
But you cannot change the map on the ground level,

545
00:36:23,775 --> 00:36:26,157
you can change only on the ground level.

546
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,819
So we'll change to the ground level,

547
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,401
and the underground level changes as well.

548
00:36:39,484 --> 00:36:42,305
Or for example, tiles are kinetic,

549
00:36:42,805 --> 00:36:45,306
that they move and rotate together,

550
00:36:45,866 --> 00:36:47,647
like Tetris bricks.

551
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:52,969
Or,

552
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,091
or it's in-house,

553
00:36:59,832 --> 00:37:01,352
and there's nothing outside.

554
00:37:01,372 --> 00:37:05,153
And then there's in-house map.

555
00:37:05,173 --> 00:37:05,213
So,

556
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:08,515
and.

557
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:09,744
That's our game, Carto.

558
00:37:09,845 --> 00:37:10,128
Thank you.

559
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:23,980
Thank you so much for taking the time to bring your game here.

560
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,101
It's so charming, isn't it?

561
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:26,442
It's just so beautiful.

562
00:37:26,762 --> 00:37:27,943
I'm sorry that we had the audio.

563
00:37:27,983 --> 00:37:29,624
We had a little bit of audio problem with that one earlier

564
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,325
today, but we wanted to hot mic it.

565
00:37:31,385 --> 00:37:34,007
So we've been trying to work out all the kinks

566
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:35,688
of experimental gameplay workshop for a while,

567
00:37:35,748 --> 00:37:37,710
but it's not really an experimental gameplay

568
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,791
workshop unless someone's demo totally crashes,

569
00:37:40,411 --> 00:37:43,293
or one of us trips down the stairs and breaks a leg.

570
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:47,176
So losing a little bit of sound's not so bad.

571
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,098
And so next we're going to have.

572
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,641
My favorite current game, Sloppy Forgeries.

573
00:37:55,602 --> 00:37:59,224
Hello, I'm Jonah Warren, creator of the Sloppy Forgeries video game.

574
00:37:59,824 --> 00:38:05,527
Sloppy Forgeries is a fast-paced, two-player competitive local multiplayer painting game.

575
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,692
At the start of each round, players select an abstracted painting from

576
00:38:13,732 --> 00:38:16,873
art history whose color palette has been reduced to four to five colors.

577
00:38:18,554 --> 00:38:22,357
Each player, armed with a mouse, a blank canvas, and a few simple paint tools,

578
00:38:22,497 --> 00:38:26,380
has a minute and a half to copy the painting as quickly and as accurately as possible.

579
00:38:27,381 --> 00:38:30,023
Players can strategically use three seconds of a hint,

580
00:38:30,383 --> 00:38:33,345
briefly superimposing the goal painting over their canvas.

581
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:41,291
As the forgeries are created, players are given immediate feedback on the accuracy of their reproductions.

582
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:46,027
Accuracy is calculated by comparing each pixel of the original with the forgery

583
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:50,269
and counting the number of matching colors, generating a percentage complete score.

584
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,432
After a minute and a half of artful painstaking decision making,

585
00:38:55,612 --> 00:38:58,333
the painting with the highest percentage complete score wins.

586
00:39:05,357 --> 00:39:09,079
The game collects all the paintings generated, which you can do some fun things with,

587
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,981
like finding the average or finding the mean.

588
00:39:13,323 --> 00:39:18,066
I also created an editor to help me reduce the color palette of a painting while keeping its

589
00:39:18,126 --> 00:39:23,630
distinguishing characteristics. An online multiplayer version of Sloppy Forgeries is

590
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:28,092
currently being developed for iOS. It is planned to be released in the summer of 2019.

593
00:39:49,315 --> 00:39:52,679
I'm Gerben, or if you want to throw it to hate you, Gerba.

594
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:53,740
There you go.

595
00:39:54,281 --> 00:39:56,263
So let me put up eloquence real quick.

596
00:39:56,864 --> 00:39:58,045
This is the first time I get to show it

597
00:39:58,085 --> 00:39:59,307
to the world basically,

598
00:39:59,327 --> 00:40:00,948
so I'm very excited about your responses.

599
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:02,390
Now let's get immersed.

600
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:20,891
Save it.

601
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:29,474
So this is Eloquence, which is basically a point-and-click adventure game,

602
00:40:30,474 --> 00:40:32,875
only it uses a simple language that I designed.

603
00:40:32,895 --> 00:40:36,816
What you just heard is an alien crashing off the shore of a volcanic island,

604
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:40,537
where three people are living on it with three different languages and three different cultures.

605
00:40:41,678 --> 00:40:45,619
You're the alien down here, in human form, because it doesn't want to scare them,

606
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:48,060
and it wants to prevent the volcano from erupting.

607
00:40:48,668 --> 00:40:51,508
The way the game works is you walk up to a person.

608
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:53,649
They will speak in a symbolic language.

609
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:57,810
What this alien can do is drag that language down to its inventory.

610
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:06,052
Now it has it memorized, and then you can return it to an NPC to create a new input.

611
00:41:06,112 --> 00:41:11,773
That allows you to walk on and talk to the other NPCs in this scene.

612
00:41:12,153 --> 00:41:15,594
You want to make it to the top as quickly as you can, so you try to identify an exit.

613
00:41:15,854 --> 00:41:17,154
Which is probably here, right?

614
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,183
So you can't quite make out what this guy wants.

615
00:41:21,704 --> 00:41:24,006
But it probably has something to do with an apple.

616
00:41:25,748 --> 00:41:27,049
So who has apples?

617
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:28,170
This one over here.

618
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,512
Can anyone tell me what she's saying?

619
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,314
This is like a regular sentence in English.

620
00:41:35,816 --> 00:41:36,216
Go again, you.

621
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:38,458
Who trades fish for apples?

622
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,021
So what would she say?

623
00:41:45,364 --> 00:41:45,705
Anyone else?

624
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:50,357
I, yeah, you, right. You win a stroopwafel. There you go.

625
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:54,858
All right, so who has fish? This guy down here, right?

626
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:01,221
So you can take this line, and I'm going to show you, I'm not going to spoil it to you,

627
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:06,784
but I just want to show you the mechanics and see you can create some different stuff.

628
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:10,585
So if we look at this line right here, we have no idea what this means,

629
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:12,586
because we don't have any reference point for that.

630
00:42:13,106 --> 00:42:14,987
But maybe we can figure out what this means.

631
00:42:17,255 --> 00:42:17,916
What does this part mean?

632
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:18,456
What do you think?

633
00:42:18,476 --> 00:42:19,737
Hold on.

634
00:42:21,098 --> 00:42:23,420
Go again.

635
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:25,662
You give me what?

636
00:42:27,263 --> 00:42:28,004
You got a stroopwafel.

637
00:42:30,706 --> 00:42:32,267
Right, so we move back down here.

638
00:42:35,029 --> 00:42:35,710
Give me a fish.

639
00:42:37,031 --> 00:42:39,133
He says, I will give you a fish.

640
00:42:41,194 --> 00:42:41,995
Walk back up there.

641
00:42:44,497 --> 00:42:45,198
I give you a fish.

642
00:42:45,698 --> 00:42:46,338
I give you an apple.

643
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:49,180
What do we do with the apple?

644
00:42:51,221 --> 00:42:52,042
To the guard, well done.

645
00:42:52,822 --> 00:42:53,503
You all get a stroke apple.

646
00:42:56,465 --> 00:42:57,986
And then he tells me to walk on.

647
00:42:58,647 --> 00:43:00,528
So that allows me to move to the next scene.

648
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:02,570
This is a bit further in the game.

649
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:05,052
This is way up at the volcano.

650
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:07,253
And when we get here,

651
00:43:07,273 --> 00:43:08,414
you get some more complicated

652
00:43:09,935 --> 00:43:10,776
problems, basically.

653
00:43:11,376 --> 00:43:12,717
So, we're not sure

654
00:43:12,738 --> 00:43:13,358
what this guy wants.

655
00:43:14,739 --> 00:43:15,580
This guy says hello again.

656
00:43:16,557 --> 00:43:19,198
And you may have noticed I've got some extra tools on this side.

657
00:43:19,939 --> 00:43:23,020
So I am actually able to cut up the line right now

658
00:43:25,722 --> 00:43:27,402
and paste it back together.

659
00:43:29,503 --> 00:43:34,066
So I can make custom answers to solve the problems I need like that.

660
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:40,309
So I'm going to jump out of the game and show you a bit more about the thought behind it.

661
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,050
So there we go.

662
00:43:46,595 --> 00:43:50,757
Language is hot, right? It's sexy, it's happening, everyone likes language.

663
00:43:51,237 --> 00:43:56,620
We all use Duolingo. Some of us learn Japanese just to follow the anime in their original languages.

664
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,461
We have blockbuster games coming out on language.

665
00:44:00,021 --> 00:44:04,643
We have games that give us simple languages already, and more recently, Heaven's Fault,

666
00:44:05,163 --> 00:44:10,086
who actually won the UK's Game of the Show award two days ago, so well done for them.

667
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,958
So I thought, this game has been in development,

668
00:44:15,058 --> 00:44:17,060
the language has been in development for three years,

669
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,641
I've been testing it a lot for three years,

670
00:44:19,261 --> 00:44:21,944
and I thought this is time to show it to the world, basically.

671
00:44:22,444 --> 00:44:26,948
But where I think my game differs from most of the other games

672
00:44:27,449 --> 00:44:30,431
is it's less about finding out what the symbol actually means,

673
00:44:30,631 --> 00:44:35,135
and it's more about finding out how people use it in their conversations.

674
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:38,018
So it's less about puzzling and smart world exploration,

675
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:40,080
experimenting, seeing what happens.

676
00:44:41,672 --> 00:44:46,654
And it makes sense because language in itself is meaningless. It's all about the context

677
00:44:47,114 --> 00:44:53,436
So if you have a look at this sentence, for example, this is Mandarin Chinese. This is ni hao ma meaning. Are you okay?

678
00:44:53,456 --> 00:44:54,336
Are you well, how are you?

679
00:44:56,537 --> 00:45:00,638
But people rarely use this and for this meaning in China they instead say

680
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:04,279
Ni zi le ma? Have you eaten?

681
00:45:04,729 --> 00:45:06,170
Did he eat yet?

682
00:45:06,931 --> 00:45:14,217
Food is very important in a culture, and that's where the meaning is derived from, not from the words themselves.

683
00:45:14,317 --> 00:45:17,160
What I want you to do in this game is think like a linguist.

684
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,061
To give you a little example of that...

685
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,331
This is a phrase from Irish.

686
00:45:22,912 --> 00:45:24,873
Now, to most of us this is incomprehensible.

687
00:45:26,174 --> 00:45:31,077
But what a linguist does is see if he can assign some kind of meaning to every piece of that.

688
00:45:31,517 --> 00:45:37,221
So some of it is just translation, some of it is how it's the meaning in context.

689
00:45:38,241 --> 00:45:44,145
And then you can translate that to something you do recognize, in this case English.

690
00:45:45,634 --> 00:45:49,535
My game gives you a language that basically gives you

691
00:45:49,675 --> 00:45:51,956
the code for all other languages.

692
00:45:52,576 --> 00:45:56,597
I'm not interested in the bottom part.

693
00:45:56,937 --> 00:45:57,477
That's up to you.

694
00:45:57,697 --> 00:45:59,838
So you can approach it from Italian or English

695
00:46:00,018 --> 00:46:01,379
or Mandarin Chinese or Portuguese.

696
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,179
So that works both ways.

697
00:46:04,419 --> 00:46:06,540
Then you can use this language to communicate with anyone

698
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:07,740
from all over the world.

699
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,461
And I think that makes it very exciting.

700
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:11,882
So I'm not sure how much time I have.

701
00:46:13,401 --> 00:46:16,744
I just want to show you how the world looks.

702
00:46:16,764 --> 00:46:18,865
So this is basically the game right here.

703
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:20,066
Those are the levels.

704
00:46:20,427 --> 00:46:23,910
Each of them gives you a little bit of a lesson

705
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,051
in the language itself.

706
00:46:25,531 --> 00:46:27,113
And it wraps around very nicely

707
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:29,515
so you can make your way to the top like that.

708
00:46:30,008 --> 00:46:31,509
or go straight up like there.

709
00:46:31,529 --> 00:46:33,911
Now, each of the colors is actually

710
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:36,713
a different symbol language, which uses the same symbols,

711
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:39,996
but changes the syntax, which makes it easier

712
00:46:40,016 --> 00:46:41,437
for some of us to connect with it.

713
00:46:41,617 --> 00:46:43,298
So this should ensure that all of us

714
00:46:43,398 --> 00:46:44,559
have a language that clicks with them

715
00:46:44,979 --> 00:46:46,801
and allows you to get to the top of the volcano

716
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:49,263
in time to save the island.

717
00:46:49,925 --> 00:46:53,707
A little bit more theoretical stuff about how we deal with language.

718
00:46:53,747 --> 00:46:56,049
So you have to know stuff first before you can create.

719
00:46:56,649 --> 00:47:00,212
And you can see that this overlaps perfectly with my design.

720
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,534
So I'm easing you into the language, easing you into the game,

721
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:07,036
and at the end, you get to climb to the top.

722
00:47:08,177 --> 00:47:11,279
Big shout out to my team who helped me make this prototype.

723
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,741
We're all part of a Dutch collective in a game bakery in the north.

724
00:47:15,562 --> 00:47:18,344
And the guy on the left who's made the artwork on Insomniac Spider-Man as well.

725
00:47:18,444 --> 00:47:19,525
So kudos to him.

726
00:47:20,872 --> 00:47:25,254
And I need your help, because I want funding, but most of all, I want a community.

727
00:47:25,354 --> 00:47:27,154
So I want to give you the demo.

728
00:47:27,694 --> 00:47:32,276
Be in touch with me through either of these channels, and I will send it to you in due time.

729
00:47:32,676 --> 00:47:34,496
Thank you so much for giving me time to present for you.

730
00:47:35,256 --> 00:47:38,157
Thank you.

731
00:47:53,169 --> 00:47:55,971
That's such an interesting, oh, so who won a Stroopwafel?

732
00:47:57,313 --> 00:47:59,274
If you won a Stroopwafel, please come and get one.

733
00:47:59,815 --> 00:48:00,355
They're amazing.

734
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:02,036
If you don't come and get them, I'm going to eat them.

735
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:06,100
So next up, we have another video.

736
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,122
And this game is called Nerve Damage.

737
00:48:08,322 --> 00:48:09,843
And the person speaking to you is Dennis Carr.

738
00:48:09,863 --> 00:48:10,243
Hi, everyone.

739
00:48:10,263 --> 00:48:11,384
My name's Dennis Carr.

740
00:48:11,444 --> 00:48:13,246
And this is my game, Nerve Damage.

741
00:48:13,586 --> 00:48:14,927
So before I get started, I just want

742
00:48:14,947 --> 00:48:16,549
to emphasize what it says on the screen here.

743
00:48:16,989 --> 00:48:19,251
This game has bright, rapidly flashing colors.

744
00:48:19,933 --> 00:48:26,359
There's a very, very strong seizure warning, and I just want to make sure everyone is aware of that before I start the game, which I'm going to do right now.

745
00:48:30,404 --> 00:48:32,085
Okay, so yeah, this is Nerve Damage.

746
00:48:32,766 --> 00:48:41,295
As you can hopefully see, it's a fast-paced, score-attack, arcade-style first-person shooter with a loud, noisy, experimental visual style.

747
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:52,123
Yeah, and so when I started working on this game, I was coming off another project, Circle Zero, which is actually here, nominated for a Nuova Award in the IGF, come see it.

748
00:48:52,203 --> 00:48:54,163
Just wanted to get that self plug in there, of course.

749
00:48:54,243 --> 00:49:05,507
But, you know, at least at the time that I had finished that game, I felt like, you know, I was very proud of it and I put a lot into it, but it felt like maybe we'd created something that was a little bit too unfriendly to the player.

750
00:49:06,129 --> 00:49:09,671
it seemed like people were just bouncing off it and not a lot of people were really engaging

751
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:09,951
with it.

752
00:49:09,991 --> 00:49:14,353
So I was a little bit disillusioned and I wanted to create a game that still felt meaningfully

753
00:49:14,373 --> 00:49:20,376
experimental but which, you know, I wanted something that the players would be, you know,

754
00:49:20,777 --> 00:49:25,719
more likely to want to play and that was maybe like fun, you know.

755
00:49:27,395 --> 00:49:32,139
And so, you know, I was also interested in this visual style that I'd been experimenting with,

756
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:38,424
and how would a visual style that is maybe kind of antagonistic and difficult for the player to

757
00:49:38,524 --> 00:49:42,467
read would affect the way that the players engage with the game, you know, because it's a 3D game.

758
00:49:42,567 --> 00:49:48,252
And, you know, sort of in most 3D games, the idea is to make it as easy as possible for the

759
00:49:48,272 --> 00:49:51,214
player to immerse themselves in the environment. But...

760
00:49:51,935 --> 00:49:54,898
You know, I wanted to bring some friction to that process and

761
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,380
complicate it, make players aware of the effort they're

762
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,962
expending to do that.

763
00:49:59,662 --> 00:50:02,665
And so I tried to sort of build up the screen so that it

764
00:50:02,705 --> 00:50:07,349
functions as much as a barrier into this world as, as it is a

765
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:07,870
window.

766
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,213
And you know, I want players to have to sort of push their way

767
00:50:11,273 --> 00:50:12,754
through it and learn to read it.

768
00:50:13,675 --> 00:50:13,795
And

769
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:22,227
Um, yeah, well, you know, one thing I realized while I was making the game is that it is a little bit hard to immerse yourself in this world.

770
00:50:22,287 --> 00:50:30,794
But once you get over that hump, once you cross the barrier, the barrier sort of functions as much to hold you into the game as it does, as it did to keep you out of it.

771
00:50:30,914 --> 00:50:31,054
So.

772
00:50:31,499 --> 00:50:36,121
there's a little bit of a trance-like aspect to playing this game. It's hard to stop sometimes,

773
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:41,604
and I like that. I think of it as being similar to the idea of the flow state,

774
00:50:41,624 --> 00:50:46,767
but where the flow state is based in this idea of serenity, I think the flow state that this

775
00:50:46,807 --> 00:50:51,509
game creates is more based in anxiety and adrenaline, and I find it kind of cathartic

776
00:50:51,689 --> 00:50:52,570
to play a game like that.

777
00:50:54,345 --> 00:51:02,391
you know, I like it. I like media that's that challenges you as much as it as it caters to you.

778
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:09,757
And, you know, I like the idea that video games are a space where themes like anxiety, compulsion,

779
00:51:09,937 --> 00:51:17,083
pain, discomfort can coexist with an experience that's kind of fun to play also and genuinely

780
00:51:17,123 --> 00:51:22,407
entertaining. And so that's kind of the experience that I'm creating with nerve damage. And yeah.

781
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,760
Thank you for watching the video and enjoy the rest of the UGW.

782
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:37,383
So this game is actually a really great opportunity to sort of have a teachable moment.

783
00:51:37,423 --> 00:51:41,084
So we've had a couple games in the showcase over the years that were like this.

784
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:46,766
How many of you were here to see Jonathan Blow demoing some of the hardest levels of

785
00:51:46,866 --> 00:51:47,606
Space Giraffe?

786
00:51:48,328 --> 00:51:49,349
Years ago, yeah, right?

787
00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:51,310
So that was a really intense game

788
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,251
that used what we call obfuscation

789
00:51:54,431 --> 00:51:57,532
to create a sense of panic and also a flow state.

790
00:51:58,052 --> 00:51:59,533
And then there was another game that was done here.

791
00:51:59,893 --> 00:52:00,873
How many of you remember there was

792
00:52:00,893 --> 00:52:02,534
this guy that made a list of the games

793
00:52:02,554 --> 00:52:04,815
that he would make if he had time on the internet?

794
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,116
And then people started making the games,

795
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:06,856
and he got really mad?

796
00:52:08,517 --> 00:52:09,758
that they stole his ideas.

797
00:52:10,399 --> 00:52:13,261
So like one year, Sean Barrett, for one of the game jams,

798
00:52:13,321 --> 00:52:14,862
made a game called Lost in the Static.

799
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,003
How many of you saw that game?

800
00:52:16,544 --> 00:52:19,006
Yeah, so it was basically a screen that was all static,

801
00:52:19,086 --> 00:52:20,647
and the only time you could navigate,

802
00:52:21,228 --> 00:52:23,330
the way that you navigated was by basically rotating

803
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,251
in the static to see where the static didn't change.

804
00:52:26,292 --> 00:52:28,772
And then when you think about it, unfinished swan

805
00:52:28,972 --> 00:52:31,073
might be something that comes in that same pattern.

806
00:52:31,713 --> 00:52:33,253
And now there's a bunch of glitch games as well.

807
00:52:33,293 --> 00:52:34,474
My students have made several,

808
00:52:35,414 --> 00:52:36,934
most of them incredibly unplayable,

809
00:52:37,014 --> 00:52:40,335
but nevertheless, interesting is a flow state case

810
00:52:40,775 --> 00:52:42,675
in this sort of scribble night kind of way.

811
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,616
And if you're scribble, scribble, scribbling,

812
00:52:44,796 --> 00:52:47,076
and everything's spastic, and you get into a flow state,

813
00:52:47,616 --> 00:52:49,477
that's a really interesting place to explore in games.

814
00:52:49,517 --> 00:52:50,937
And I really like this particular video

815
00:52:50,977 --> 00:52:53,298
because it sort of gives us, it holds space for a game.

816
00:52:53,598 --> 00:52:56,079
That's about the infinite rage that we all feel right now,

817
00:52:56,379 --> 00:52:56,779
all the time.

818
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,381
So having said that, Plus Minus is here.

819
00:53:00,401 --> 00:53:01,361
I'll let them introduce themselves.

820
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:04,663
Thank you.

821
00:53:04,703 --> 00:53:05,003
Thank you.

822
00:53:05,023 --> 00:53:05,343
Thank you.

823
00:53:05,363 --> 00:53:05,623
Thank you.

824
00:53:05,643 --> 00:53:05,923
Thank you.

825
00:53:05,943 --> 00:53:06,143
Thank you.

826
00:53:06,163 --> 00:53:06,444
Thank you.

827
00:53:06,464 --> 00:53:06,684
Thank you.

828
00:53:06,704 --> 00:53:06,904
Thank you.

829
00:53:06,924 --> 00:53:07,184
Thank you.

830
00:53:07,204 --> 00:53:07,504
Thank you.

831
00:53:07,524 --> 00:53:07,784
Thank you.

832
00:53:07,804 --> 00:53:08,104
Thank you.

833
00:53:08,124 --> 00:53:08,885
Thank you.

834
00:53:09,885 --> 00:53:10,545
So hi, everyone.

835
00:53:10,786 --> 00:53:11,306
I'm Juuso.

836
00:53:11,466 --> 00:53:12,226
This is Antti.

837
00:53:12,406 --> 00:53:13,967
We're from Aalto University, Finland.

838
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:15,007
So that's quite far away.

839
00:53:15,968 --> 00:53:17,969
But we're here to show you Plus Minus.

840
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:19,129
So we're two of the developers.

841
00:53:19,169 --> 00:53:19,890
It was a team of six.

842
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:27,444
Now this game is pretty conventional, so you can run around, you can jump, you can move

843
00:53:27,484 --> 00:53:29,465
third person camera, it's an action game.

844
00:53:30,527 --> 00:53:33,730
But there's this addition we've put in here and that's magnetism.

845
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:38,334
So you can actually magnetize any metal object in the surroundings, either positively or

846
00:53:38,374 --> 00:53:38,774
negatively.

847
00:53:40,196 --> 00:53:44,040
And now opposite polarities, they attract each other, and negative polarities repel.

848
00:53:46,072 --> 00:53:48,133
You might notice these bubbles around the magnetized objects.

849
00:53:48,593 --> 00:53:52,315
Those are there to demonstrate what the effective range is of the magnets.

850
00:53:52,676 --> 00:53:56,258
As soon as two bubbles start overlapping, there starts to be an interaction.

851
00:53:56,518 --> 00:53:58,479
The closer they get, the stronger that interaction.

852
00:54:00,981 --> 00:54:05,864
You can only magnetize metal objects, but there is a lot of surface here that is not metallic.

853
00:54:06,144 --> 00:54:08,685
You can still use that. You can actually shoot the walls or the floor.

854
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:10,947
It will create this temporary field.

855
00:54:11,907 --> 00:54:15,590
This is useful for a variety of things, like moving objects around.

856
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:23,551
So those are the basics.

857
00:54:24,072 --> 00:54:25,313
Let's get on to the gameplay.

858
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:27,455
So what can we actually do with this magnetic system?

859
00:54:28,756 --> 00:54:30,778
A lot of the game is about moving through levels.

860
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:34,401
So there's rarely a direct path you can take.

861
00:54:34,882 --> 00:54:36,644
Instead, you need to look at what's in the environment

862
00:54:36,824 --> 00:54:39,586
and how can you move that into a position that's

863
00:54:39,606 --> 00:54:40,447
going to let you get through.

864
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:43,870
And we're really playing around with a lot

865
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,232
of these tropes that are in action games.

866
00:54:45,572 --> 00:54:46,493
So we have combat as well.

867
00:54:46,693 --> 00:54:48,094
But we're doing something a bit different with that.

868
00:54:48,905 --> 00:54:50,747
So usually you would shoot enemies to kill them.

869
00:54:51,207 --> 00:54:53,129
Here, if you shoot an enemy, it's only going to polarize it.

870
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:54,911
It's not actually going to cause any direct damage.

871
00:54:55,812 --> 00:54:57,594
However, collisions cause damage.

872
00:54:58,515 --> 00:55:01,679
So magnetism is actually perfect for that kind of combat.

873
00:55:08,526 --> 00:55:09,848
You're kind of bullying the enemies here.

874
00:55:10,565 --> 00:55:12,545
So here we drop down and there's these three robots.

875
00:55:12,645 --> 00:55:13,606
Again, you can do the same thing.

876
00:55:13,746 --> 00:55:15,166
You can make the robots collide into each other

877
00:55:15,406 --> 00:55:16,927
and they're going to start taking damage.

878
00:55:17,307 --> 00:55:19,008
You can make them smash into walls.

879
00:55:19,028 --> 00:55:19,988
That's going to do the same thing.

880
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:22,349
Or you can look around what's in the environment.

881
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:23,729
So we have these endless pits.

882
00:55:24,509 --> 00:55:25,770
Mario usually falls into them,

883
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:28,511
but you can drop the robots down into there.

884
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,152
So really encouraging players to come up

885
00:55:32,192 --> 00:55:33,212
with these creative solutions

886
00:55:33,272 --> 00:55:34,873
for approaching problems such as combat.

887
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:41,108
And just like the enemies, the player actually takes collision damage as well.

888
00:55:41,269 --> 00:55:44,010
So usually what ends up happening is you're playing around with magnets

889
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,372
and then you get like this really large magnet in your face.

890
00:55:47,373 --> 00:55:51,496
Yeah, that let's hope that doesn't happen, but kind of hope that it does.

891
00:55:52,817 --> 00:55:54,598
OK, so that was combat.

892
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:58,601
Now we're going to move on to some sections that are more focused on platforming.

893
00:55:59,141 --> 00:56:00,922
So that's, again, another trope from action games.

894
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:03,384
You've got this platforming, but we want to do it a bit differently.

895
00:56:05,686 --> 00:56:13,130
So right now here you have this large metal block and it's in the way and it might look like it's really heavy, but the magnetic system doesn't really care about that.

896
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:14,871
So you can just move it out the way.

897
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:22,254
Then we get to this pit you need to get across, but there aren't really any platforms right there.

898
00:56:23,055 --> 00:56:28,838
However, there are these discs at the bottom and you can just magnetize those, lift them up and you've created a path for yourself.

899
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:32,351
At this section, it's pretty standard.

900
00:56:32,391 --> 00:56:35,333
We're still tutorializing the system.

901
00:56:35,953 --> 00:56:37,634
But later on, it starts to really open up

902
00:56:37,874 --> 00:56:40,756
and you don't have these obvious solutions.

903
00:56:41,956 --> 00:56:43,437
Those enemies, they have the weirdest AI.

904
00:56:43,557 --> 00:56:46,019
They just sometimes jump down on top of you.

905
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:48,740
And okay, so we're taking a pretty,

906
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:52,042
we're taking a pretty standard approach to this level.

907
00:56:55,717 --> 00:56:57,479
Well, there's a lot of potential for taking

908
00:56:57,519 --> 00:56:59,020
these creative shortcuts.

909
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,421
And we'll get back to that later.

910
00:57:03,604 --> 00:57:05,325
And you may have noticed we have these mechanisms

911
00:57:05,345 --> 00:57:07,627
like elevators and doors in our game.

912
00:57:07,767 --> 00:57:08,808
You'll find them in every game.

913
00:57:08,868 --> 00:57:10,529
But we're also using magnetism for those.

914
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,311
And that's kind of important for the player

915
00:57:12,511 --> 00:57:16,634
so that we can really teach them to get used to this magnetism.

916
00:57:17,415 --> 00:57:19,036
And it also kind of creates this cohesion

917
00:57:19,056 --> 00:57:22,099
where everything in the world works with this same core

918
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:23,600
magnetic system.

919
00:57:25,063 --> 00:57:26,144
Now this room is pretty fun.

920
00:57:26,344 --> 00:57:28,166
So we have this floor that can be magnetized,

921
00:57:29,287 --> 00:57:31,308
but we also have a ceiling that can be magnetized.

922
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:35,112
And the effect is pretty surprising.

923
00:57:38,695 --> 00:57:40,176
So what's happening here is we've got the floor

924
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:41,077
pushing the enemies up,

925
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:42,638
the ceiling pushing the enemies down,

926
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:44,080
and they end up in this kind of limbo

927
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,121
where they're just bouncing around.

928
00:57:45,141 --> 00:57:47,863
It's kind of silly, but it's a lot of fun.

929
00:57:48,884 --> 00:57:50,766
You can probably imagine how this might be used in puzzles

930
00:57:50,886 --> 00:57:52,467
or other level elements.

931
00:57:57,672 --> 00:57:58,552
Okay, now we defeated those.

932
00:57:58,933 --> 00:57:59,853
We're gonna skip forward a bit.

933
00:58:00,014 --> 00:58:00,754
We don't have a lot of time,

934
00:58:00,794 --> 00:58:02,696
and this is a pretty cool level we're gonna show you.

935
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:08,761
Now, the thing in this level

936
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:11,823
is we have this giant metal pillar in the center,

937
00:58:12,183 --> 00:58:13,024
and as you magnetize it,

938
00:58:13,565 --> 00:58:16,327
it creates a magnetic field that covers the entire area.

939
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:19,049
So this creates this sort of dynamic

940
00:58:19,089 --> 00:58:21,171
where now if you magnetize anything in the room,

941
00:58:21,551 --> 00:58:23,393
it's gonna get either pushed or pulled towards the center.

942
00:58:26,258 --> 00:58:30,699
Now it's another platforming stage, so you need to get kind of creative how you move forward.

943
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,601
So here we have this large gap. There's no platforms there.

944
00:58:33,621 --> 00:58:35,741
So you need to look, what have we got here?

945
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:40,323
And we got this boxes. So you can attach a box to the pillar, and all of a sudden you have a platform.

946
00:58:43,484 --> 00:58:45,725
Now you could take the same approach for the rest of the level.

947
00:58:46,225 --> 00:58:47,706
So creating these platforms for yourself.

948
00:58:48,766 --> 00:58:51,187
But we promised a shortcut, so we're going to try to do that.

949
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:56,271
That's a bit tricky to set up.

950
00:58:56,391 --> 00:58:57,692
And we didn't actually design this shortcut.

951
00:58:57,892 --> 00:59:00,034
So a play tester was actually able to find it.

952
00:59:01,715 --> 00:59:02,416
But it was really cool.

953
00:59:02,996 --> 00:59:05,899
And we really want to keep these sort of cool elements

954
00:59:05,939 --> 00:59:06,319
in our game.

955
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,001
So if the player finds a way to break our game,

956
00:59:09,061 --> 00:59:09,482
we let them.

957
00:59:09,502 --> 00:59:15,346
Okay, so what we're doing here is we're building

958
00:59:15,367 --> 00:59:16,107
a sort of launcher.

959
00:59:17,048 --> 00:59:18,409
We've got two magnets on top of each other.

960
00:59:20,911 --> 00:59:21,391
And there we go.

961
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,893
We just skipped like half the level.

962
00:59:32,307 --> 00:59:33,688
So yeah, this is plus minus.

963
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:38,793
We're going to upload a small demo of this soon after GDC so

964
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:41,035
that anybody else can go try it out and have

965
00:59:41,075 --> 00:59:41,616
some fun with it.

966
00:59:42,076 --> 00:59:43,237
So make sure to check that out.

967
00:59:43,778 --> 00:59:43,998
Thanks.

968
00:59:51,052 --> 00:59:53,633
So plus minus another opportunity for us

969
00:59:53,753 --> 00:59:57,975
to do a little way back machine with the experimental gameplay

970
00:59:57,995 --> 00:59:58,655
workshop audience.

971
00:59:59,115 --> 01:00:01,716
How many of you were here when the original Portal

972
01:00:01,776 --> 01:00:04,058
first demoed for the first time ever here in the session?

973
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:05,258
That's right.

974
01:00:05,278 --> 01:00:09,100
So games like Portal, at the time that they were being made,

975
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,741
were considered so experimental that they

976
01:00:11,781 --> 01:00:12,581
submitted to the workshop.

977
01:00:13,262 --> 01:00:16,463
So that's how much has changed over the course of the history of the workshop.

978
01:00:16,903 --> 01:00:20,904
And I also just wanted to take the moment here to say a little bit about dynamic games.

979
01:00:21,344 --> 01:00:26,065
So what I love about Plus Minus and games like Portal and the kinds of games that

980
01:00:26,906 --> 01:00:32,287
that I've always loved to play is that they have systems in them and they spend a lot less time on fidelity and a lot

981
01:00:32,327 --> 01:00:40,250
more time on simulating specific systems with the kind of fidelity that is just enough to create those kinds of opportunistic learnings for

982
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:44,175
players and that's actually how people learn and it's why play is learning and

983
01:00:44,195 --> 01:00:47,920
so it's really really awesome to get games like this submitted. It used to be

984
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:51,644
that Experimental Gameplay Workshop was almost only physics games and we've

985
01:00:51,664 --> 01:00:55,710
really been able to branch out and show games that are sometimes a little bit

986
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:58,814
more like a paper game, sometimes they're literally edible.

987
01:00:59,774 --> 01:01:02,976
Sometimes they're physical, they're based on computing systems that are emerging,

988
01:01:03,316 --> 01:01:06,897
and sometimes they're systems-based in ways that we have never perceived,

989
01:01:07,738 --> 01:01:10,419
or play with your vision and your ears.

990
01:01:10,939 --> 01:01:13,620
We've had all audio games here that you play in a gas mask.

991
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,641
How many of you saw that?

992
01:01:15,321 --> 01:01:15,641
All right.

993
01:01:15,841 --> 01:01:16,041
See?

994
01:01:16,081 --> 01:01:17,302
So we're starting to get to the place

995
01:01:17,342 --> 01:01:20,084
now where experimental gameplay workshop kind of defies

996
01:01:20,184 --> 01:01:22,065
description because it's whatever you submit.

997
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:23,886
And I really want to keep encouraging you

998
01:01:25,347 --> 01:01:28,208
into designing and presenting, even if it's a bizarre thing

999
01:01:28,228 --> 01:01:30,730
that you think may not be fun, to bring it to us.

1000
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:32,431
If you're watching on the internet

1001
01:01:32,691 --> 01:01:33,911
and you have a bizarre experiment,

1002
01:01:33,931 --> 01:01:35,712
you've never been to GDC, you don't even

1003
01:01:35,752 --> 01:01:36,653
have to come here anymore.

1004
01:01:36,773 --> 01:01:38,154
You can just send us the game.

1005
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:38,934
We'll put a video up.

1006
01:01:39,234 --> 01:01:40,695
And maybe somebody will mail you a check,

1007
01:01:40,715 --> 01:01:42,976
and you'll be able to make it in your own home and never leave.

1008
01:01:43,357 --> 01:01:47,099
You'll be able to live your life in your pajamas, smoking weed,

1009
01:01:47,139 --> 01:01:48,040
and making your favorite game.

1010
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:53,323
So that sounds like the life of a true artist to me.

1011
01:01:54,684 --> 01:01:56,225
And so with that, I'm going to let

1012
01:01:56,285 --> 01:01:58,506
Sean Liu talk about Hostile User Interface.

1013
01:02:00,908 --> 01:02:01,348
Sean Liu.

1014
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:03,709
This is Hostile User Interface, a game I worked on

1015
01:02:03,729 --> 01:02:05,070
at the school of IGM at RIT.

1016
01:02:05,987 --> 01:02:11,852
The object of the game is to navigate the maze, but the controls have been intentionally designed to trick the player into accidentally triggering Windows hockey combinations.

1017
01:02:12,792 --> 01:02:18,777
The inspiration came from my professor, Ian Shriver's daughter, who crawled over his keyboard when she was one year old, causing the screen to flip upside down.

1018
01:02:19,478 --> 01:02:22,920
And he had to use Google with an upside down screen to figure out what she did and how to undo it.

1019
01:02:24,021 --> 01:02:27,964
Thus, the idea to create a game where the challenge doesn't come from the game, but from the actual operating system.

1020
01:02:29,319 --> 01:02:32,740
The pitches is one of the many ideas to work on in the class on experimental gameplay,

1021
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:34,540
and I decided I wanted to explore this concept.

1022
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:39,201
So, this first thing you have to do to start is hold down the keys CTRL, ALT, and DELETE.

1023
01:02:39,781 --> 01:02:43,222
Obviously, if you hit these keys the way normal people do, it brings up the security menu.

1024
01:02:43,822 --> 01:02:45,643
If you wait long enough, the game gives you a hint.

1025
01:02:46,023 --> 01:02:50,844
Pressing DELETE first, because pressing CTRL or ALT afterwards won't trigger the normal Windows response.

1026
01:02:51,584 --> 01:02:55,785
From the high concept, the immediate problem is that it sounds more like a practical joke than a fun game.

1027
01:02:56,580 --> 01:03:01,304
So where do you start? I could have made QWOP using the Ctrl, Alt, F4, and Escape keys,

1028
01:03:01,484 --> 01:03:05,247
but I doubt players would find it very fun. Instead, I started with a simple game and

1029
01:03:05,287 --> 01:03:09,130
thought about what would best enable hotkeys. Some keys need to be held down while other

1030
01:03:09,211 --> 01:03:13,194
keys are pressed to trigger hotkeys, like holding down F4 and pressing Alt does nothing.

1031
01:03:13,834 --> 01:03:16,616
So I had the idea of having death fields and doors, one of which requires players

1032
01:03:16,636 --> 01:03:19,018
to hold buttons down and the other that requires single key presses.

1033
01:03:19,734 --> 01:03:26,425
The other theme throughout development is that when the player does something wrong, they have to blame themselves and not the UI, even though it's totally the UI's fault.

1034
01:03:27,447 --> 01:03:31,934
That's how to make the player feel like they're overcoming a challenge and not that they're just getting laughed at by the game.

1035
01:03:32,815 --> 01:03:34,076
I found there are a few ways to do this.

1036
01:03:34,636 --> 01:03:37,778
One was to make an experience enough of a clear game that the player can become immersed

1037
01:03:37,798 --> 01:03:38,218
in the play.

1038
01:03:38,738 --> 01:03:41,499
As soon as the player enters a flow state, they'll start playing on automatic.

1039
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:45,501
They're hitting keys without thinking, accidentally closing the app, and then realize what they

1040
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:49,083
did and that it happened because they weren't paying attention, which gives us the self-blame

1041
01:03:49,103 --> 01:03:49,783
that we're looking for.

1042
01:03:50,384 --> 01:03:53,145
Once I had the basics of the game working, the rest came down to designing levels and

1043
01:03:53,185 --> 01:03:55,566
traps in different and unique ways to keep the game interesting.

1044
01:03:56,006 --> 01:03:59,128
Skipping ahead, this is the first place in-game where we give players the option to close

1045
01:03:59,148 --> 01:03:59,368
the game.

1046
01:03:59,888 --> 01:04:02,369
Previously, combinations of hockeys have had minimal effect.

1047
01:04:02,829 --> 01:04:05,550
Despite giving them all the warnings, most players will still manage to close out the

1048
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:06,271
game on this screen.

1049
01:04:06,951 --> 01:04:08,092
This isn't an obvious trap.

1050
01:04:08,532 --> 01:04:10,333
Players have to go out of their way just to do this.

1051
01:04:11,033 --> 01:04:12,573
If they proceed normally then nothing happens.

1052
01:04:13,394 --> 01:04:16,495
This happens both if I'm standing there giving them warnings and in blind tests where I'm

1053
01:04:16,515 --> 01:04:17,176
not even in the room.

1054
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,017
It's also around here where three different types of players emerge.

1055
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:23,798
Some players love the game and want to keep playing, some players hate the game but want

1056
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:26,980
to watch other people suffer through it, and the last group hates the game but has to keep

1057
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,361
playing until they beat it because it's a matter of pride at that point.

1058
01:04:30,141 --> 01:04:33,144
Some struggles with making this game were that not all hardware is the same.

1059
01:04:33,584 --> 01:04:37,788
Laptop keyboards aren't standardized at all with the layout of their home, end, delete, and page down buttons,

1060
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:41,531
but this is an extremely niche problem as controls for most games don't use these keys.

1061
01:04:42,272 --> 01:04:45,475
On the software side, certain programs have their own hotkeys that can interfere with gameplay,

1062
01:04:45,515 --> 01:04:49,238
such as the newest hockey combination NVIDIA's GeForce Experience added to take screenshots.

1063
01:04:50,139 --> 01:04:53,361
At the moment, there isn't really any way to fix it besides just disabling these hotkeys.

1064
01:04:54,268 --> 01:04:59,542
For those interested in either playing Hostage Interface or sending it to their friends and or enemies, it's currently available on Steam.

1065
01:05:07,296 --> 01:05:11,639
Hostile user interface proves the fact that the platform holder always has the power.

1066
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:18,963
Yeah, so making an experimental game can happen when you're a student, it can happen with just the hotkeys on your computer.

1067
01:05:19,003 --> 01:05:22,064
So you have no excuse if you have the desire to make experimental games.

1068
01:05:22,965 --> 01:05:28,168
And next up we have Tim here to talk about what the golf?

1069
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:31,250
Yeah, I need, I need power.

1070
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:36,250
Okay, it works. It works.

1071
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:41,793
Okay, it's the experimental gameplay workshop, so I hope it works.

1072
01:05:44,955 --> 01:05:46,176
Please, please.

1073
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:52,839
Oh, shit.

1074
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:54,781
Yes!

1075
01:05:59,643 --> 01:06:00,944
Okay, can I get audio?

1076
01:06:03,345 --> 01:06:04,406
Oh, no, it's the wrong audio.

1077
01:06:08,748 --> 01:06:08,908
What?

1078
01:06:08,928 --> 01:06:11,409
I kinda need audio for some of it.

1079
01:06:11,429 --> 01:06:11,509
Hmm?

1080
01:06:11,529 --> 01:06:17,390
While we're doing this, I'd just like to take a moment

1081
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:23,712
to say thank you to all the audio engineers

1082
01:06:23,772 --> 01:06:25,353
that work the room at EGW every year

1083
01:06:25,413 --> 01:06:26,833
because this happens every year.

1084
01:06:27,193 --> 01:06:29,934
The AV staff for EGW is always amazing.

1085
01:06:30,734 --> 01:06:32,435
Let's have a huge round of applause

1086
01:06:32,535 --> 01:06:34,435
for the people that made us see and hear this stuff today.

1087
01:06:40,983 --> 01:06:48,189
I'm working on this game called What The Golf and it's not just me, the rest of the team is just actually working on the game and not hanging out here.

1088
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:51,072
So, a lot more thanks to them.

1089
01:06:54,094 --> 01:06:58,297
Two years ago, I presented a game here called Keyboard Sports, saving Qwerty.

1090
01:06:59,378 --> 01:07:03,662
And that also used all the keys on the keyboard and we also had the Alt F4 problem.

1091
01:07:04,242 --> 01:07:08,245
And we haven't released it yet, still in some trouble, but working hard on it.

1092
01:07:09,667 --> 01:07:10,147
Let's do this.

1093
01:07:13,887 --> 01:07:16,108
We started out making an actual golf game.

1094
01:07:17,328 --> 01:07:20,368
Kind of Dark Souls inspired golf.

1095
01:07:21,029 --> 01:07:21,929
Called Dark Holes.

1096
01:07:23,329 --> 01:07:23,449
It...

1097
01:07:25,049 --> 01:07:25,989
It did not work.

1098
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:28,170
It wasn't that funny.

1099
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:31,150
It turns out golf just isn't that funny.

1100
01:07:32,531 --> 01:07:33,511
It's kind of boring.

1101
01:07:34,831 --> 01:07:36,711
So we kind of moved on from that.

1102
01:07:38,438 --> 01:07:39,399
Go a little bit up on the volume.

1103
01:07:39,699 --> 01:07:40,259
Can I do that?

1104
01:07:41,379 --> 01:07:41,999
Yeah, OK.

1105
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:45,080
We moved on from that and tried a few other things.

1106
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:48,860
And we have actually just kept making golf games ever since.

1107
01:07:49,441 --> 01:07:51,561
So we've made like 500 golf games.

1108
01:07:52,061 --> 01:07:54,321
And most of them are really bad.

1109
01:07:55,222 --> 01:07:56,482
These are some of the better ones.

1110
01:07:57,842 --> 01:07:58,242
Let's play.

1111
01:07:58,642 --> 01:07:59,722
Back to normal, ordinary golf.

1112
01:08:15,165 --> 01:08:20,807
So the first thing we kind of started exploring after it failed with the first project and second project.

1113
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:27,511
We were like, we can play with scale and we can like, it obviously doesn't need to be a golf ball.

1114
01:08:34,034 --> 01:08:36,375
And you can add a few puns and then it kind of works.

1115
01:08:36,955 --> 01:08:41,257
And then you're kind of out of inspiration again and you just look around the office. What can we make?

1116
01:08:56,890 --> 01:09:00,612
And then you kind of use a bunch of different objects, and it's like, that's obvious.

1117
01:09:00,652 --> 01:09:02,874
We can do boxes and triangles and things.

1118
01:09:03,334 --> 01:09:04,635
But we can also do things to the flag.

1119
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:15,381
And once you kind of know golf is about getting a thing from A to B,

1120
01:09:15,782 --> 01:09:17,182
you can kind of swap those things.

1121
01:09:17,783 --> 01:09:18,563
So now I'm the hole.

1122
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:22,045
And I'm kind of going into this one here.

1123
01:09:22,406 --> 01:09:23,646
You can kind of see what's coming.

1124
01:09:24,227 --> 01:09:24,687
It's a hole.

1125
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:33,134
And then once we have like the golf everything nailed you can like think

1126
01:09:33,354 --> 01:09:41,300
there are other games about getting a ball from A to B like this one like and

1127
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:49,167
then you can always go for like a quick quick fun thing where just but now we

1128
01:09:49,207 --> 01:09:54,010
nailed nailed A to B and but why not change the perspective there's no

1129
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:54,871
reason it's not

1130
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:56,831
First person golf, right?

1131
01:10:00,933 --> 01:10:04,855
And once we're in first person we can also just go back to normal 2D golf.

1132
01:10:05,135 --> 01:10:07,817
This is kind of like desert golf, but way...

1133
01:10:08,958 --> 01:10:10,879
Oh, it's actually really boring.

1134
01:10:11,179 --> 01:10:12,640
It's one of the ones that didn't really make it.

1135
01:10:15,201 --> 01:10:17,563
But then we were like, fuck that, let's do something else.

1136
01:10:27,687 --> 01:10:31,830
Then once we're in 2D, why not look at some other 2D games?

1137
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:35,472
They're all kind of golf games.

1138
01:10:52,604 --> 01:10:56,046
And at this point we're like, maybe all games are kind of golf games?

1139
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:10,218
And then we can zoom out and relax a little bit.

1140
01:11:17,401 --> 01:11:20,643
And then, like again, golf, getting things from A to B.

1141
01:11:22,524 --> 01:11:25,306
You can probably find few other games out there.

1142
01:11:27,907 --> 01:11:28,247
And then...

1143
01:11:31,369 --> 01:11:32,330
That never really gets old.

1144
01:11:36,157 --> 01:11:38,579
And then we can kind of just go back to like the old thing here,

1145
01:11:38,899 --> 01:11:41,561
because now everyone knows exactly what's going to happen when I do this.

1146
01:11:57,334 --> 01:12:01,637
And another rule in golf is you usually don't hit the ball while it's still moving.

1147
01:12:02,057 --> 01:12:03,338
But what if we just remove that?

1148
01:12:24,802 --> 01:12:28,743
and then we just started looking at everything

1149
01:12:35,604 --> 01:12:35,764
oh

1150
01:13:23,182 --> 01:13:25,424
Yeah, thank you.

1151
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:34,527
that we wanna...

1152
01:13:36,908 --> 01:13:37,689
Super six thing.

1153
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:38,830
No.

1154
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:40,932
Do it.

1155
01:13:41,412 --> 01:13:41,692
Do it.

1156
01:13:42,873 --> 01:13:44,114
No.

1157
01:13:44,395 --> 01:13:45,035
No.

1158
01:13:45,115 --> 01:13:45,315
No.

1159
01:13:45,355 --> 01:13:45,596
No.

1160
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:47,437
No.

1161
01:14:01,633 --> 01:14:02,893
This is a bit awkward.

1162
01:14:03,394 --> 01:14:04,494
It doesn't do anything.

1163
01:14:04,514 --> 01:14:11,437
Yeah, thank you.

1164
01:14:11,497 --> 01:14:18,540
Yes, go ahead.

1165
01:14:19,481 --> 01:14:21,442
OK, cool.

1166
01:14:22,202 --> 01:14:24,303
And I believe for this next video, Trinny, you're here, right?

1167
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:25,403
You're here?

1168
01:14:25,823 --> 01:14:26,524
Yes, OK, yes.

1169
01:14:26,564 --> 01:14:27,104
So Trin is here.

1170
01:14:27,524 --> 01:14:31,106
This is Trin's video, and it is called You Busy?

1171
01:14:33,023 --> 01:14:36,586
Hey everyone, I'm Trin and I'm the game designer behind Ubusy.

1172
01:14:37,767 --> 01:14:44,311
Ubusy is a game about the various channels that people and information need to flow through in order to complete work.

1173
01:14:45,111 --> 01:14:52,116
Essentially, it's a game about productivity when there are a million things that can flitch for attention any given day at the office.

1174
01:14:52,796 --> 01:15:02,543
Whether it be getting an approval on a task, attending a meeting, having to put out a fire, there are so many things that get in the way of us being able to check that box off of the list.

1175
01:15:03,543 --> 01:15:08,749
So as a mix of a game designer, business analyst, project manager, I was like, what a fascinating

1176
01:15:08,809 --> 01:15:13,974
system to work with. You know, so much communication is required for us to actually feel productive at

1177
01:15:14,014 --> 01:15:18,719
work. What if I put this into a hectic local multiplayer environment just to see how that

1178
01:15:18,779 --> 01:15:26,127
sheds light on the system? So I very literally ripped approval processes from previous jobs I had.

1179
01:15:26,674 --> 01:15:33,160
and I put them into the game and added meetings, added fires, added all the fun stuff at the office

1180
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:38,925
to try to make it actually fun but also to shed light on the system and to really show

1181
01:15:38,945 --> 01:15:44,250
like how much it takes for us to feel productive under the current circumstances.

1182
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:49,774
There you go. I have a task just like chilling over here in the abyss.

1183
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,459
Hey, Green, I'm still up. Thank you.

1184
01:15:54,699 --> 01:15:56,601
Oh wait, I need you. Oh wait, thank you.

1185
01:15:56,641 --> 01:15:59,863
Oh, this is a meeting.

1186
01:15:59,924 --> 01:16:00,944
Hey, Green, it's you.

1187
01:16:01,004 --> 01:16:01,165
Yeah.

1188
01:16:01,205 --> 01:16:04,667
You still got it. I still got it. I still can't approve.

1189
01:16:05,628 --> 01:16:06,489
I was pressing it.

1190
01:16:06,669 --> 01:16:08,190
Green, we're right here.

1191
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:10,633
I can approve you. Yeah.

1192
01:16:10,953 --> 01:16:12,654
Here you go. Got you.

1193
01:16:12,694 --> 01:16:13,075
Thank you.

1194
01:16:16,513 --> 01:16:20,415
All right, I need to go to, oh I think pink, I need to.

1195
01:16:20,515 --> 01:16:20,975
Thank you.

1196
01:16:21,015 --> 01:16:25,517
Thank you.

1197
01:16:25,997 --> 01:16:27,498
So I made this game with one other person,

1198
01:16:27,598 --> 01:16:30,459
my partner in crime and fabulous programmer, Chris Sosa.

1199
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,161
However, we currently are not working on the game.

1200
01:16:33,181 --> 01:16:35,461
This was just like a super short project for us,

1201
01:16:35,502 --> 01:16:36,762
really quick dev cycle,

1202
01:16:36,802 --> 01:16:39,563
something we just wanted to get out of our systems.

1203
01:16:39,743 --> 01:16:41,204
But there are like a million things

1204
01:16:41,244 --> 01:16:42,264
that we want to do with it.

1205
01:16:42,304 --> 01:16:44,105
Like right now, since it's a vertical slice,

1206
01:16:44,125 --> 01:16:45,126
you start right in the middle.

1207
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:45,846
It's like starting.

1208
01:16:46,362 --> 01:16:51,292
closer to the fish and chips level of overcooked, which is just a lot. But we have a list of

1209
01:16:51,693 --> 01:16:54,178
changes and improvements, changing the sounds.

1210
01:16:54,588 --> 01:16:57,310
changing the levels, ramping up gameplay, that sort of thing.

1211
01:16:57,330 --> 01:17:00,692
We just currently don't have the time or the funds to work on it.

1212
01:17:01,012 --> 01:17:03,454
So we're really just enjoying showing it at festivals

1213
01:17:03,594 --> 01:17:06,957
and hearing what people have to say about it, hearing about their work experiences.

1214
01:17:07,397 --> 01:17:08,778
So we'd love to hear your thoughts.

1215
01:17:09,498 --> 01:17:12,060
You can contact us at my Twitter handle.

1216
01:17:12,381 --> 01:17:15,723
I am Trin, and I'd love to hear about your work experience.

1217
01:17:15,883 --> 01:17:19,125
If you're what really resonated to you in the game, if you're interested

1218
01:17:19,145 --> 01:17:22,848
in working on it eventually, if we ever started up like in general,

1219
01:17:22,868 --> 01:17:24,089
we would just love to hear from you.

1220
01:17:33,468 --> 01:17:35,529
So yeah, Trin is here, so if you wanted to, you know,

1221
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:37,230
make her dream come true of making a game

1222
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:38,570
about the stress of being in an office,

1223
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:40,031
you could just come up here at the end of the session

1224
01:17:40,071 --> 01:17:41,231
and give her a fat check.

1225
01:17:43,753 --> 01:17:45,113
Maybe you could give us both fat checks

1226
01:17:45,153 --> 01:17:47,815
and then we would win.

1227
01:17:48,115 --> 01:17:50,696
So I think that one of the things about EGW

1228
01:17:50,756 --> 01:17:53,037
is that it does allow us to talk about things that can be,

1229
01:17:53,277 --> 01:17:54,998
but also, I mean, I think as Trin pointed out,

1230
01:17:55,258 --> 01:17:56,459
things that are and like,

1231
01:17:56,539 --> 01:17:58,740
it's not easy being us all the time.

1232
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:00,401
making the stuff that we make.

1233
01:18:01,001 --> 01:18:05,185
And this place hopefully is giving you some inspiration.

1234
01:18:05,225 --> 01:18:06,746
We're getting a little close to the end of the session

1235
01:18:06,786 --> 01:18:08,888
this year because we decided to keep it a little shorter

1236
01:18:09,468 --> 01:18:12,531
because the EGW used to be a marathon of endless games

1237
01:18:12,591 --> 01:18:14,032
and everyone had to take a pee break in the middle

1238
01:18:14,052 --> 01:18:14,833
and it was kind of intense.

1239
01:18:15,193 --> 01:18:16,634
And this year we're just kind of trying to keep it

1240
01:18:16,674 --> 01:18:17,595
a little bit more focused.

1241
01:18:17,655 --> 01:18:20,438
So we really appreciate your focus this year

1242
01:18:20,598 --> 01:18:21,979
and this format.

1243
01:18:22,059 --> 01:18:23,280
I would personally like your feedback.

1244
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,421
If you want to see more games,

1245
01:18:24,441 --> 01:18:25,662
if you want the session to get bigger again,

1246
01:18:25,682 --> 01:18:27,944
if you want more stuff up front at the end, let me know.

1247
01:18:28,624 --> 01:18:29,865
I know there are no donuts this year.

1248
01:18:29,925 --> 01:18:30,985
Maybe there'll be donuts next year.

1249
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:33,427
And with that, we're going to have Frank here

1250
01:18:33,487 --> 01:18:34,667
talk about picture processing.

1251
01:18:34,687 --> 01:18:34,767
Hi.

1252
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:46,493
I'm Frank DeMarco from New York, and I'm making a game

1253
01:18:46,533 --> 01:18:47,613
called picture processing.

1254
01:18:48,674 --> 01:18:50,195
It's a picture puzzle where the object

1255
01:18:50,275 --> 01:18:51,896
is to fix a glitch on your screen

1256
01:18:52,296 --> 01:18:53,836
by swapping the graphics with each other.

1257
01:18:58,751 --> 01:19:01,193
The original demo was created for a game jam called

1258
01:19:01,213 --> 01:19:04,675
A Game by Its Cover, an online jam where games are created

1259
01:19:04,855 --> 01:19:07,177
based on imagined NES games submitted

1260
01:19:07,217 --> 01:19:10,019
to another separate annual event, a gallery exhibit

1261
01:19:10,039 --> 01:19:11,580
called My Famicase.

1262
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:15,323
My Famicase is an awesome art show

1263
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:17,384
that has been held yearly in Japan since 2005.

1264
01:19:18,185 --> 01:19:22,828
In that slide, you can see there are a bunch of fake NES

1265
01:19:22,868 --> 01:19:23,329
cartridges.

1266
01:19:25,282 --> 01:19:30,003
The game that I chose to make my game based on is called Sado by Ishii Hiroaki.

1267
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:34,684
The Glitchtout cover was very inspiring and looked cool to me.

1268
01:19:35,644 --> 01:19:38,204
And I checked the description by doing a Google Translate.

1269
01:19:39,045 --> 01:19:43,486
And it seems like the game concept is it's a conceptual game where you put a cartridge

1270
01:19:43,506 --> 01:19:47,886
in, it's not working, and you meditate on the beauty of imperfection in the Glitchtout

1271
01:19:47,906 --> 01:19:48,127
screen.

1272
01:19:51,852 --> 01:19:56,576
I added one thing to that concept, which is you meditate so hard, you can telepathically

1273
01:19:56,676 --> 01:20:01,319
access the graphics memory of the system and fix the glitch by swapping graphics with each

1274
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:01,519
other.

1275
01:20:03,781 --> 01:20:05,822
Let's start a new game and take a look at the introduction.

1276
01:20:09,025 --> 01:20:15,289
So you're in your living room, you try to play a game, you put the cartridge in the

1277
01:20:15,389 --> 01:20:19,933
system, it's glitched out, and so you start meditating.

1278
01:20:21,468 --> 01:20:22,468
and you get superpowers.

1279
01:20:23,009 --> 01:20:24,710
You're intimately engaging with the hardware

1280
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:25,830
of your video game console.

1281
01:20:26,751 --> 01:20:28,492
As the great Bob of Bob's Game put it,

1282
01:20:29,112 --> 01:20:30,533
it's a game inside of a game.

1283
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:36,196
This is what the final illustration

1284
01:20:36,356 --> 01:20:37,517
in the introduction looks like.

1285
01:20:38,958 --> 01:20:41,679
It's a head attached to a Nintendo by an energy beam.

1286
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,341
And it's pretty weird,

1287
01:20:44,421 --> 01:20:46,062
but it's one of my ultimate fantasies,

1288
01:20:46,782 --> 01:20:48,603
using a mind control beam with a Nintendo.

1289
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:52,240
So let's play Scene 1.

1290
01:20:54,943 --> 01:20:58,527
The only hint the player gets is this title, so for Scene 1 your hint is Power Up.

1291
01:20:59,608 --> 01:21:02,971
When the scene begins, you're presented with a pretty severe mess of graphics.

1292
01:21:03,812 --> 01:21:08,658
Also, sometimes it's a little subtle, but the sound is glitched out too, so if you listen

1293
01:21:08,678 --> 01:21:11,641
you can hear the music is booping every second or so.

1294
01:21:14,762 --> 01:21:18,705
So if the player knows it's a puzzle and they caught the basic idea of the game,

1295
01:21:19,246 --> 01:21:23,149
they might be able to put together that this level is a side-scroller based on the hint

1296
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:27,492
and seeing there's a mushroom and there's a Mario-looking character,

1297
01:21:28,713 --> 01:21:33,277
maybe the clouds and the ground might tell you something. But maybe they can't tell anything.

1298
01:21:33,377 --> 01:21:38,661
Somebody yesterday told me that the Mario tile looks like a hamburger and maybe they

1299
01:21:38,701 --> 01:21:41,623
didn't catch the premise of the game, but I'll talk about that in a second.

1300
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,462
There is only one interaction at this point. Let us try pressing Enter.

1301
01:21:48,604 --> 01:21:50,565
This menu comes up where all the tiles are displayed,

1302
01:21:51,126 --> 01:21:52,447
and you are able to choose between them.

1303
01:21:53,888 --> 01:21:56,509
The numbers on the left correspond to memory addresses.

1304
01:21:56,970 --> 01:21:59,051
Every one of these tiles is in the wrong memory address,

1305
01:21:59,211 --> 01:22:02,674
because the game makes sure all the tiles are shuffled out of their correct locations.

1306
01:22:03,474 --> 01:22:05,415
If you select one of the tiles and then select another,

1307
01:22:05,956 --> 01:22:08,838
you will notice the screen changes somewhere from slightly to a lot.

1308
01:22:10,062 --> 01:22:13,283
So if we, you can see the top is mostly filled with clouds,

1309
01:22:13,483 --> 01:22:15,184
which is pretty good because that's supposed to be the sky.

1310
01:22:16,104 --> 01:22:18,325
And the bottom is dirt, which is also pretty good,

1311
01:22:18,365 --> 01:22:19,466
but they're both in the wrong place.

1312
01:22:20,246 --> 01:22:24,348
So let's try swapping cloud and ground.

1313
01:22:28,289 --> 01:22:32,291
So you can see that every place where the ground was,

1314
01:22:33,051 --> 01:22:33,892
now there's clouds,

1315
01:22:33,932 --> 01:22:36,073
and every place where the clouds were, now there's ground.

1316
01:22:36,633 --> 01:22:38,013
But if you do a small swap,

1317
01:22:38,919 --> 01:22:41,781
like the blank space and the mushroom,

1318
01:22:43,102 --> 01:22:44,924
you might not notice much changes on the screen.

1319
01:22:46,485 --> 01:22:50,829
I've noticed that the real aha moment for this level is when you put the sky in the right place.

1320
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:53,491
So let's switch

1321
01:22:55,693 --> 01:22:56,053
memory 6

1322
01:22:57,214 --> 01:22:57,794
with memory 0.

1323
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:03,051
Now it looks more like a side-scroller.

1324
01:23:03,931 --> 01:23:07,472
Then it becomes a classic puzzle game situation where you are putting things in the right place.

1325
01:23:08,212 --> 01:23:10,792
Satisfying that compulsion that basically governs everything.

1326
01:23:11,333 --> 01:23:13,073
What we are all out here exploiting for profit.

1327
01:23:16,874 --> 01:23:17,834
Mario goes here.

1328
01:23:21,154 --> 01:23:22,955
Tree goes here.

1329
01:23:27,556 --> 01:23:28,416
Rock goes there.

1330
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,962
And ground goes there.

1331
01:23:35,904 --> 01:23:36,565
Oh, but what's this?

1332
01:23:36,965 --> 01:23:39,167
It looks correct, but we're still one swap away.

1333
01:23:39,187 --> 01:23:40,568
If you look at the bottom of the screen,

1334
01:23:40,609 --> 01:23:42,150
it tells you how many swaps you have left.

1335
01:23:43,691 --> 01:23:45,553
I think one of the things that makes this game unique

1336
01:23:45,713 --> 01:23:48,475
is you're solving a puzzle that only has an objective answer

1337
01:23:48,636 --> 01:23:50,497
based on how the designer arranges the scene.

1338
01:23:51,538 --> 01:23:54,240
In most puzzle games, there are no arbitrary situations.

1339
01:23:55,021 --> 01:23:56,703
There are rules in the game that prevent them.

1340
01:23:57,752 --> 01:24:01,832
In Picross, the numbers that guide the player are generated directly by the pixels on the grid.

1341
01:24:02,713 --> 01:24:06,633
In Tetris, if you don't put the lines into the right order, you lose.

1342
01:24:07,454 --> 01:24:11,554
In this game, if the level designer decided the sky was made of rock, they could do that.

1343
01:24:13,495 --> 01:24:17,015
Sometimes people play this game by arranging the tiles to look like something they want to see,

1344
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,696
and they have fun with it that way.

1345
01:24:19,696 --> 01:24:25,297
In this scene, it turns out that I think it looks slightly better if Mario is to the left of the mushroom.

1346
01:24:31,457 --> 01:24:34,200
And so yeah, and so the sound non-glitches, and you've beaten level 1.

1347
01:24:41,246 --> 01:24:47,552
So yeah, this is level 2. It's supposed to be a driving level. It's like a race car level.

1348
01:24:48,673 --> 01:24:52,937
But because I've noticed a lot of people want to be creative while playing, I've started working on a level editor.

1349
01:24:53,158 --> 01:24:54,058
So let's take a look at that.

1350
01:25:04,968 --> 01:25:08,589
There are three different things you can do from the main menu of the level editor.

1351
01:25:08,629 --> 01:25:12,330
You can edit the tiles, you can test the level that you are building, or you can place the

1352
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:13,210
tiles on the level.

1353
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:15,351
Let's start by making a tile.

1354
01:25:15,371 --> 01:25:19,632
I will start by clearing the default title.

1355
01:25:23,313 --> 01:25:26,914
There is a paint tool, and I am just going to clear the whole tile to white.

1356
01:25:31,476 --> 01:25:32,556
Now I will select green.

1357
01:25:33,324 --> 01:25:34,904
I am going to try to draw a plant.

1358
01:25:49,388 --> 01:25:52,549
You can see in the background that the whole level is changing.

1359
01:25:53,029 --> 01:25:56,390
That is because the whole level is set to be the first tile.

1360
01:25:59,931 --> 01:26:00,851
That kind of looks like a plant.

1361
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:05,662
And you can also load tiles.

1362
01:26:07,544 --> 01:26:09,726
So I'm going to put these numbers in.

1363
01:26:09,746 --> 01:26:24,261
OK, now I'm going to place those.

1364
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:37,541
Okay, let us test the level.

1365
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:41,722
All right, it is all scrambled up.

1366
01:26:42,302 --> 01:26:44,282
Usually the free swap is the background.

1367
01:26:44,322 --> 01:26:45,662
You can see it is all filled with twos.

1368
01:26:45,682 --> 01:26:47,803
We will just put the plant there.

1369
01:26:52,564 --> 01:26:54,324
Now let us see if we can correct this code.

1370
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:01,886
Yeah, that is it. In the Level Editor,

1371
01:27:02,126 --> 01:27:04,467
it just says solved in the bottom when you solve the level.

1372
01:27:06,633 --> 01:27:09,175
So, a quick note about some attention this game received.

1373
01:27:09,635 --> 01:27:12,617
A blog by someone who has a PhD wrote about picture processing.

1374
01:27:16,679 --> 01:27:17,840
That's supposed to laugh you out.

1375
01:27:19,301 --> 01:27:22,003
Probably a lot of people here have a PhD and that's no big deal.

1376
01:27:23,544 --> 01:27:24,324
But I don't have one.

1377
01:27:24,584 --> 01:27:27,506
I have a computer science degree that's not even a science degree.

1378
01:27:27,666 --> 01:27:28,647
It's a Bachelor of Arts.

1379
01:27:30,147 --> 01:27:31,528
But I guess that's appropriate though.

1380
01:27:31,768 --> 01:27:32,729
This is art, right?

1381
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:35,871
VideoBall, which is available now.

1382
01:27:36,297 --> 01:27:40,980
for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Steam for PC.

1383
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:42,601
Video Ball.

1384
01:27:42,741 --> 01:27:44,542
It's still available, Video Ball.

1385
01:27:44,622 --> 01:27:49,085
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Steam for PC.

1386
01:27:49,905 --> 01:27:53,308
So anyway, a blog that is a PhD blog wrote about my game,

1387
01:27:53,508 --> 01:27:54,829
so I guess my game is pretty cool.

1388
01:27:55,169 --> 01:27:56,210
Please check out my PayPal.

1389
01:28:03,178 --> 01:28:04,839
All right, so this is going to be the last presentation

1390
01:28:04,879 --> 01:28:07,641
for the day, and Eddie and I are just going to stay up here,

1391
01:28:08,041 --> 01:28:09,642
and we'll watch with you.

1392
01:28:11,283 --> 01:28:15,486
We wanted to make a note here because this video was

1393
01:28:15,506 --> 01:28:20,189
submitted by someone who just shipped their game, which

1394
01:28:20,269 --> 01:28:21,569
is a huge accomplishment.

1395
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:23,951
So for the tape, let's give them a huge round of applause.

1396
01:28:32,877 --> 01:28:34,959
Jay's been pretty stressed out because he just shipped his game.

1397
01:28:35,319 --> 01:28:39,061
So the first part of the video is just going to be Jay for three minutes talking about his game.

1398
01:28:39,262 --> 01:28:40,042
So here's Jay.

1399
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:45,686
Hi, I'm Jay Tholen, the lead developer of Hypnospace Outlaw.

1400
01:28:46,806 --> 01:28:53,391
Hypnospace Outlaw started in 2014 as a small micro game called Hypnospace Enforcer.

1401
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:58,054
And that's where the whole concept of using the internet while you sleep started,

1402
01:28:58,174 --> 01:28:59,475
using headbands at night.

1403
01:29:00,255 --> 01:29:01,816
It was a little bit more futuristic than...

1404
01:29:02,617 --> 01:29:05,838
And while there was an operating system part, it wasn't as robust.

1405
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:11,020
The main part of the game was this sort of a play on the information superhighway,

1406
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:17,142
and it was an inlet side-scrolling endless runner, and you played as a cop, and you had to

1407
01:29:17,962 --> 01:29:25,105
apprehend people for doing these various pretty banal internet violation things.

1408
01:29:26,885 --> 01:29:31,347
So it came from that, and then it evolved into more of an operating system game.

1409
01:29:32,035 --> 01:29:37,737
over time because people just responded better to the operating system parts.

1410
01:29:38,337 --> 01:29:46,099
So yeah, I started making a sequel shortly after releasing that in late or late 2014 or early 2015

1411
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:55,643
around when my work on Dropsy was ending. Anyway, and then from that point on until

1412
01:29:55,663 --> 01:29:59,804
the Kickstarter in 2016 and even a year after that it became more of a

1413
01:30:02,322 --> 01:30:11,505
just a big fake internet. We made, me and my programmer Mike, made a few tools, a page builder,

1414
01:30:11,945 --> 01:30:23,989
so, and a custom HSP hypnospace page format for pages, and a tune sequencer, and the game runs the

1415
01:30:24,129 --> 01:30:28,770
songs from the tune sequencer at runtime. It triggers all the samples and the effects and

1416
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:30,191
everything. So...

1417
01:30:31,358 --> 01:30:36,823
We did have a little bit of a framework for a game in there, like where you make progress,

1418
01:30:37,323 --> 01:30:44,329
but it was mostly just a big, big internet that we were making.

1419
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:51,515
And I was, you know, intent on making it a game eventually, but I wasn't just very interested

1420
01:30:51,555 --> 01:30:51,875
in that.

1421
01:30:52,776 --> 01:30:54,458
So then, about a year...

1422
01:30:56,457 --> 01:31:01,320
a year and two or three months ago, then we kind of were like, okay, we have to make it into a game.

1423
01:31:01,961 --> 01:31:09,165
Like if you want to, you know, if it was up, if it was just, you know, up to me and I

1424
01:31:11,046 --> 01:31:16,710
wasn't, you know, if I didn't need money, I would have just, um,

1425
01:31:17,851 --> 01:31:22,433
maybe kept going and making a big internet, but I felt like we needed like progression systems.

1426
01:31:22,918 --> 01:31:23,899
Well, that wasn't too bad.

1427
01:31:23,919 --> 01:31:29,743
They didn't really change a whole lot about the big, deep web

1428
01:31:29,783 --> 01:31:30,823
that you get to explore.

1429
01:31:31,924 --> 01:31:34,706
Anyway, so yeah, that's the basics.

1430
01:31:34,766 --> 01:31:37,188
And what I'll be doing is not bad.

1431
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:38,128
You want to watch it again?

1432
01:31:39,049 --> 01:31:40,069
Yeah, here's the trailer again.

1433
01:31:40,109 --> 01:31:40,470
Watch it again.

1434
01:32:06,228 --> 01:32:07,289
Oh!

1435
01:32:07,409 --> 01:32:07,749
Oh!

1436
01:32:07,969 --> 01:32:08,189
Oh!

1437
01:32:08,389 --> 01:32:08,549
Oh!

1438
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:08,730
Oh!

1439
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:08,910
Oh!

1440
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:09,070
Oh!

1441
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:09,250
Oh!

1442
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:09,670
Oh!

1443
01:32:09,950 --> 01:32:10,171
Oh!

1444
01:32:10,311 --> 01:32:10,531
Oh!

1445
01:32:10,631 --> 01:32:10,751
Oh!

1446
01:32:10,871 --> 01:32:11,071
Oh!

1447
01:32:11,271 --> 01:32:11,411
Oh!

1448
01:32:11,532 --> 01:32:11,632
Oh!

1449
01:32:11,732 --> 01:32:11,812
Oh!

1450
01:32:11,872 --> 01:32:11,992
Oh!

1451
01:32:12,092 --> 01:32:12,172
Oh!

1452
01:32:12,272 --> 01:32:13,833
Important message received.

1453
01:32:50,938 --> 01:32:54,380
So this room has the capacity to hold maybe a thousand people.

1454
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:00,822
It's pretty close to capacity, so if you each gave him a thousand dollars, that'd be rad.

1455
01:33:02,863 --> 01:33:04,605
If everyone that watched this trailer on the internet

1456
01:33:04,625 --> 01:33:06,828
gave him $1,000 for his game, that'd be even more rad.

1457
01:33:06,908 --> 01:33:08,690
And he could probably live for a long time

1458
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:10,091
just making games, doing his thing.

1459
01:33:11,092 --> 01:33:12,434
You know, everyone's had that moment

1460
01:33:12,454 --> 01:33:13,876
where they're working on something and they go,

1461
01:33:14,016 --> 01:33:16,138
oh, I should probably put a progression system in here.

1462
01:33:16,498 --> 01:33:18,040
I think that moment in the video

1463
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:19,041
is the one that really struck me.

1464
01:33:19,061 --> 01:33:20,703
It was like, oh yeah, no, you probably have to.

1465
01:33:21,384 --> 01:33:23,004
But you don't always have to.

1466
01:33:23,324 --> 01:33:25,785
And as we continue to create spaces like this

1467
01:33:25,945 --> 01:33:27,765
in our communities where people can show their art,

1468
01:33:28,765 --> 01:33:29,465
you don't have to.

1469
01:33:30,186 --> 01:33:33,746
You can support each other, not just with money,

1470
01:33:33,866 --> 01:33:37,927
but also with congratulations, love, hugs, donuts.

1471
01:33:39,068 --> 01:33:41,288
So if you have a moment at some point

1472
01:33:41,328 --> 01:33:43,229
to just send this guy an email,

1473
01:33:43,309 --> 01:33:45,049
look his game up, drop him a line,

1474
01:33:45,189 --> 01:33:47,049
and say, hey, I love that demo.

1475
01:33:47,369 --> 01:33:49,650
Thanks for making your weird internet somewhat playable.

1476
01:33:49,710 --> 01:33:50,450
That would be really nice.

1477
01:33:51,651 --> 01:33:52,653
That'd be a nice thing for you to do.

1478
01:33:52,673 --> 01:33:53,494
I'm not saying you have to do it,

1479
01:33:53,554 --> 01:33:55,437
but one of the ways that we thrive

1480
01:33:55,477 --> 01:33:56,880
is by getting positive feedback,

1481
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,022
and that would be really nice.

1482
01:33:58,242 --> 01:34:00,586
And so everybody that participated,

1483
01:34:00,646 --> 01:34:01,407
if you showed a video,

1484
01:34:01,527 --> 01:34:03,030
if you're a game developer that's here

1485
01:34:03,290 --> 01:34:04,592
that was in the showcase, please come up,

1486
01:34:04,652 --> 01:34:06,135
as well as all the organizers, please come up on stage.

1487
01:34:41,603 --> 01:34:42,884
This is experimental gameplay.

1488
01:34:44,085 --> 01:34:45,506
And you are all experimental gameplay.

1489
01:34:45,686 --> 01:34:48,268
And GDC is now actually almost officially over.

1490
01:34:48,648 --> 01:34:49,809
We have 15 minutes.

1491
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:53,812
Instead of having question session, just come up and meet these people and give them a hug.

1492
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:54,233
Thank you.
