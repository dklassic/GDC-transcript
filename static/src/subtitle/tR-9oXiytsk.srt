1
00:00:06,295 --> 00:00:11,399
Alright, so I would like to start off with a question. How many of you, your school has at

2
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:16,702
least one course offering in game design? Okay, pretty much everyone, or at least a lot of you.

3
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:20,224
Now let's talk about specialized topics within game design. How many of you have an offering

4
00:00:20,284 --> 00:00:24,267
in serious games or persuasive games or games with a purpose or something? Fair number of you.

5
00:00:24,627 --> 00:00:28,509
How many of you have something related to game writing, like narrative, world building?

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,611
Fair number of you. How many of you have an offering in game balance?

7
00:00:32,918 --> 00:00:38,982
So, lots smaller. And some of you are like, uh, sort of, like an actual class dedicated to

8
00:00:39,022 --> 00:00:42,805
that. Now I'll just point out, I mean, every game project, not every game project is a

9
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:47,609
serious game, but we have a lot of those. Not every game needs a serious amount of game

10
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:52,152
writing, but we have a lot of those. Pretty much every game needs to be balanced in some

11
00:00:52,192 --> 00:00:57,436
form or other at some point. And we don't have a lot of those. So maybe, at least for those

12
00:00:57,456 --> 00:01:01,539
of us with game design programs that go beyond 101, maybe we should all think about doing

13
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:01,679
this.

14
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:03,894
That's what this is about.

15
00:01:04,174 --> 00:01:06,376
It's a case study in how I teach it.

16
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:09,418
So this was my first iteration

17
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:11,900
on a full 10 week game balance course back in 2010.

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,601
It's still up there online.

19
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:15,303
It's released under a Creative Commons license.

20
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,284
Anyone who wants to mine it for anything useful

21
00:01:17,324 --> 00:01:19,566
can feel free to do that without having to ask permission.

22
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,761
This is from the first page of the syllabus of my most recent iteration on the course.

23
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:28,602
I think all courses where the topics build on each other should probably have a tech

24
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:31,684
tree in it so students can see all the things that they learn and how they level.

25
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:37,206
And I also think every game degree curriculum with prerequisites or tracks or course sequences

26
00:01:37,226 --> 00:01:38,587
should probably be laid out like this.

27
00:01:38,607 --> 00:01:41,488
I don't know if anyone is doing it like that, but you might want to think about it.

28
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:46,210
So I'll just put that over there on the left side in one piece.

29
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,851
And let's unpack this a bit and walk through kind of what I put in this course.

30
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:54,894
So, we start off with some critical vocabulary, just laying out basic definitions, like what

31
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:59,297
do I mean when I say game balance? How is that different from pacing or tuning? Reminding

32
00:01:59,317 --> 00:02:03,779
everyone what a system is and what positive and negative feedback loops are. What we mean

33
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,681
when we say that a game is deterministic or solvable, especially since that starts getting

34
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:10,042
weird when we get into solving games of chance.

35
00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:12,484
and rule symmetry and asymmetry.

36
00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:14,206
This is where we set the boundaries of the course

37
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:17,168
for what exactly the scope is when we talk about balance.

38
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:20,151
And by the way, I just love that the word cloud

39
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:21,132
is the first thing that comes up

40
00:02:21,172 --> 00:02:22,473
when I Google the word vocabulary.

41
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:23,254
It's just so meta.

42
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:27,137
So how I define game balance for this class

43
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:29,839
is creating, game balance is creating

44
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,521
the appearance of fairness in a game.

45
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:33,343
And appearance is really important here.

46
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,627
It's about player perception as much as reality,

47
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:38,691
because as game designers, we are crafting an experience.

48
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:40,334
And it's that experience that matters.

49
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:44,299
So balance is part math, part systems, and part psychology.

50
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,022
We do this through several methods.

51
00:02:46,703 --> 00:02:51,066
One is designer intuition or experience. The game designer chooses to make certain things

52
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:55,208
a certain way because it feels right to them. Another is play testing. You create a rapid

53
00:02:55,228 --> 00:02:59,631
prototype, play on your own or with friends, observe and make changes based on any rules,

54
00:02:59,691 --> 00:03:03,253
exploits or weaknesses that you find. Play testing is another thing that everyone has

55
00:03:03,273 --> 00:03:06,896
to do and there's very few courses offered in. That's a different presentation in this

56
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:07,136
summit.

57
00:03:08,477 --> 00:03:13,243
A third method is analytics, taking actual data from games and using statistical analysis

58
00:03:13,283 --> 00:03:15,666
to draw conclusions about how it's actually played.

59
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:20,012
And a fourth method is mathematical modeling, using math to understand the relationships

60
00:03:20,072 --> 00:03:23,337
between all the numbers in the game in order to choose the most appropriate ones.

61
00:03:23,857 --> 00:03:28,081
And most of the focus in this course is on learning mathematical tools to do this modeling.

62
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:34,266
And also building spreadsheet proficiency so students can use these to solve problems and present solutions.

63
00:03:34,906 --> 00:03:40,231
We also spend a lot of time, well we spend some time on analytics because that's widely used, it's very useful.

64
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:42,432
I want them to encounter that.

65
00:03:42,713 --> 00:03:46,115
As for building their own intuition and building their own playtesting skills,

66
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:50,319
we do that through practical exercises where they analyze the balance of an existing game

67
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:52,060
or do balance on a game of their own.

68
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,602
I also point out to my students that on the very first day that math is a skill, it can

69
00:03:56,642 --> 00:04:00,884
be learned like any other, and the whole concept of a person being good at math or bad at math

70
00:04:01,244 --> 00:04:02,825
is just an American cultural myth.

71
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:04,546
There's been a ton of research showing that.

72
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,928
So therefore this will not be a valid excuse in this class to say, oh, I'm bad at math,

73
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:09,848
therefore I suck at this.

74
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:12,909
Every student can get this if they apply themselves.

75
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,590
And so far that has turned out to be the case.

76
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:19,410
So once everyone is clear on the scope of the class and everyone has been given the chance to

77
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,012
drop if this isn't what they thought it was, then we start off looking at numeric

78
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:27,756
relationships. Because just saying I have five hit points left is meaningless unless you

79
00:04:27,796 --> 00:04:32,219
know whether other things do zero damage or occasionally one or if things are doing one to

80
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,902
five damage or if things are doing a thousand damage. It's all about how numbers in the game

81
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,083
relate to each other.

82
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,005
So we examine linear and identity relationships,

83
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,227
triangular and polynomial relationships,

84
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:44,449
and exponential and logarithmic relationships,

85
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:46,191
and also chains of relationships.

86
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:49,094
Like how if a player is getting stronger in an RPG

87
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:50,315
through polynomial growth,

88
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:52,697
and monsters are also scaling polynomially,

89
00:04:53,057 --> 00:04:56,640
then the relationship between the player power

90
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:59,163
and the monster power will be linear, not polynomial.

91
00:04:59,243 --> 00:04:59,683
Things like that.

92
00:05:00,244 --> 00:05:03,125
We also examine resource flow diagrams like Joris Dorman's

93
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:05,906
wonderful machinations tool, just because it's a great way

94
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:09,267
to visually show relationships between numbers.

95
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:11,888
And I also have the Class Play cookie clicker.

96
00:05:12,308 --> 00:05:14,949
And mechanically, it's just a very pure implementation of

97
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:16,129
the relationship between numbers.

98
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:18,290
You have cookies that are increasing at a rate of

99
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,511
cookies per second, and then you use your cookies to

100
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:22,691
increase your cookies per second, but at less efficient

101
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:23,732
rates of exchange over time.

102
00:05:24,052 --> 00:05:26,433
That's pretty much all the engine of the game is.

103
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:30,954
It's also important historically as the game that really popularized the idle game genre.

104
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:33,255
And this is controversial among my students.

105
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,316
They generally hate me for introducing them to this game if they haven't played it before,

106
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:40,217
because it's totally addicting and yet it's really stupid.

107
00:05:40,477 --> 00:05:43,658
And you're fully aware of how stupid it is that you're clicking on cookies and that's

108
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,899
all you're doing just to increment a counter.

109
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,820
And it's stupid, but you get addicted to it and continue to do it anyway.

110
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,881
So really it's a game about self-loathing, which is one of the prerequisites to being

111
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,942
a game designer, which is why I keep it in here.

112
00:05:58,213 --> 00:06:00,876
From there we look at a special case of numeric relationships,

113
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:03,499
which is resource systems and economic systems,

114
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,880
because those come up a lot in games.

115
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,503
We cover the bits of an economics 101 course

116
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:08,925
that are directly relevant to games,

117
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:11,588
things like how supply and demand would affect prices

118
00:06:11,648 --> 00:06:12,789
in an MMO auction house.

119
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:18,314
how inflation affects those prices and different strategies for handling inflation in a game

120
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:22,898
economy. And inter-player trading and the differences in how that works between closed and

121
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:28,023
open game economies. And also various auction and inter-player trading systems, which are a lot

122
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:32,207
more common in Euro games than in video games. And I encourage them to play Euro games that

123
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:35,850
have strong trading or auction mechanics here, like Settlers of Catan or Modern Art.

124
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:41,063
After that we have enough tools to get into our first real in the trenches game balance

125
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:44,384
project where we talk about games where better stuff costs more.

126
00:06:44,664 --> 00:06:48,285
I refer to this as transitive relationships between the various game elements.

127
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:52,466
And one of the purest examples and the one that I examine a lot just because of my personal

128
00:06:52,506 --> 00:06:56,427
experience in the industry is TCGs like Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone.

129
00:06:56,907 --> 00:07:00,970
You have a cost to put a card into play and then the card has an effect and more expensive

130
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,673
cards are more powerful and what you're doing is putting all of the cost, limitations and

131
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:09,037
drawbacks and also the powers, abilities and benefits in terms of numbers, scaled so that

132
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:12,439
a card is balanced if the value of its costs equals the value of its benefits.

133
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,803
And you can put this into a spreadsheet where each mechanic has its own column, each row

134
00:07:16,843 --> 00:07:17,443
has a number.

135
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:20,831
Each row is its own card and there's one column that just

136
00:07:20,851 --> 00:07:23,332
contains some math function that incorporates all the other

137
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:25,714
columns and spits out a number that tells you if the card is

138
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:28,035
balanced or not and if not how far off it is and which

139
00:07:28,075 --> 00:07:30,637
direction. Very powerful technique. I actually just

140
00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:32,798
talked about this in the math for programmers tutorial an hour

141
00:07:32,838 --> 00:07:35,160
and a half ago if you want to look that up on the vault later.

142
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,862
So one of the projects here is for students to take an existing

143
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:42,204
game with transitive mechanics and analyze it to find the game

144
00:07:42,444 --> 00:07:44,646
objects like the cards or whatever that are the most

145
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:46,827
powerful, the weakest and the most balanced.

146
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:51,050
and then compare that in their math with the generally accepted wisdom of the games community.

147
00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:58,156
So at this point now we've taken things as far as we can, balancing games based on skill, but

148
00:07:58,176 --> 00:08:02,199
we haven't done anything involving mechanics of chance yet. So now we dive into basic

149
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:06,643
probability, specifically how to calculate independent probabilities like die rolls, where

150
00:08:06,683 --> 00:08:10,686
each roll doesn't affect the odds of future rolls, and dependent probabilities like drawing a

151
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:14,889
card from a deck where each card draw does affect the probability of future card draws if you

152
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:15,610
know what was removed.

153
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,360
So this is basically taking a probability 101 class, extracting the parts that we use in

154
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,941
games and ignoring the rest. Although I do make sure they encounter things like the

155
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:29,202
Monty Hall problem just so they understand that probability isn't always intuitive. I also

156
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,803
go over ways to do sanity checks, like probabilities are always between zero and one,

157
00:08:33,203 --> 00:08:38,964
adding up all the non-overlapping outcomes should always get you one exactly. Because

158
00:08:39,004 --> 00:08:42,045
probability is very easy to screw up if you don't know what you're doing and you're not

159
00:08:42,085 --> 00:08:45,746
careful. But most of the time if something goes wrong, it goes wrong enough to fail a

160
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:46,286
sanity check.

161
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:51,749
So it kind of has its built in debugger, which is nice. This stuff actually doesn't take that

162
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,152
long to cover, just a week or so, but I throw in another week of playing some dice and card

163
00:08:56,172 --> 00:09:00,695
games in class and analyzing them, like the strategy between, behind bluff and liar's dice,

164
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:04,518
or which side has the natural advantage in One Night Ultimate Werewolf, or any other

165
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,119
relevant games that I've acquired recently.

166
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:11,028
Now at this point my students know how to calculate exactly how fast they'll go broke

167
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:11,488
in Vegas.

168
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:15,951
And then I deliver some bad news, which is probability doesn't actually solve everything,

169
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:16,731
for two reasons.

170
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:19,393
The first is that humans suck at probability.

171
00:09:19,753 --> 00:09:21,314
We generally find it unintuitive.

172
00:09:21,814 --> 00:09:25,937
Even if you do your odds calculations correctly as the game designer, a lot of times they

173
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:27,158
will feel wrong to players.

174
00:09:27,638 --> 00:09:32,182
The great Sid Meier even talked about some of his experiences with this at a keynote here in GDC

175
00:09:32,222 --> 00:09:37,907
back in 2010. So you also have to learn about not just how to calculate odds and probabilities,

176
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:44,252
but also cognitive biases to explain why people get intuitive probability wrong and when they do.

177
00:09:44,632 --> 00:09:48,155
And we talk about game design strategies to compensate for your players being buggy.

178
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:52,977
And this is also a great time to revisit games like Liar's Dice and poker to learn the

179
00:09:52,997 --> 00:09:56,679
difference between just doing the math and actually using psychological mechanics like

180
00:09:56,719 --> 00:10:00,320
bluffing. And interestingly, another thing that we mention here for the first time is

181
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,901
ethics. Because whether we should be honest with our, you know, should we be honest with

182
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:11,163
our players and do the probabilities the way we say we're going to, or should we, um,

183
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:16,326
to and reinforce our players flawed understandings of

184
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:19,147
probability. Basically is it okay to lie to our players or

185
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,868
not. That's something worth thinking about. And I mentioned

186
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:23,969
this here because we normally don't see matters of

187
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:26,531
professional ethics emerging as a key topic in a math class.

188
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:32,532
Second thing that goes wrong with probability is that even if we're honest and our random

189
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:36,834
number generators are not. Physical dice and cards are generally imperfect and not fully

190
00:10:36,894 --> 00:10:40,955
random. Any pseudo random numbers generated on a computer of course can't be random at

191
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:44,536
all. And it's worth understanding a little bit about how these things work so you can

192
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:48,977
predict how players could exploit these random systems to gain an unfair advantage. Whether

193
00:10:49,017 --> 00:10:53,298
it be through cheating at Vegas or at a high stakes e-sport or just scumming the save files

194
00:10:53,338 --> 00:10:55,439
of a single player RPG to gain an unfair advantage.

195
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,542
Now, I could switch this next topic with the previous, but I like making sure that students

196
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:04,065
don't come to rely too much on probability before realizing its limitations.

197
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:09,089
But after I do that, I cycle back to a couple of other useful probability tools, specifically

198
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:10,971
Monte Carlo simulations and Markov chains.

199
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:14,974
Now Monte Carlo is just repeating a random trial a few thousand or a million times and

200
00:11:14,994 --> 00:11:18,297
seeing what happens and then through the law of averages your results should be pretty

201
00:11:18,337 --> 00:11:20,579
close to an exact mathematical solution if there is one.

202
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,301
And Monte Carlo solutions are useful because they're easy.

203
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:24,542
There's no math required.

204
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:27,445
You just make a spreadsheet or sometimes do some light scripting.

205
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:33,170
They can be used in situations where calculating an exact solution is impossible or too unwieldy

206
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,113
and slow or if the student just doesn't know how to do it.

207
00:11:37,194 --> 00:11:41,075
Monte Carlo solutions also work as a useful sanity check if you do have an exact solution.

208
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:45,597
If you solve a probability question both ways, and with Monte Carlo and with math,

209
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:50,038
and get the same answer, then it gives you a lot of extra certainty that you didn't make a mistake.

210
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:54,760
Markov chains, on the other hand, are useful for solving some very specific types of game

211
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,704
design problems that involve repeating something, where the results of one thing affect the

212
00:11:58,744 --> 00:12:00,165
results of the next recursively.

213
00:12:00,825 --> 00:12:02,787
As an example, consider a board game Monopoly.

214
00:12:03,268 --> 00:12:06,770
And if you're trying to figure out which properties are the most or least likely to be landed

215
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:10,754
on in order to compute the ROI for the purchase price of the properties, you could do that

216
00:12:10,794 --> 00:12:11,935
with a Monte Carlo simulation.

217
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:15,938
Just start it, go and roll 2D6 a bunch of times, go to jail when you roll three doubles

218
00:12:15,978 --> 00:12:16,939
in a row, stuff like that.

219
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,960
But you can also treat this as a set of states,

220
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,140
where each state is a combination of what space you're on

221
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,021
and how many times you've rolled doubles in a row.

222
00:12:23,521 --> 00:12:25,082
And you could build this transition matrix

223
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:26,722
of probabilities between states,

224
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,743
take a column vector of probabilities

225
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:30,404
of being in any given state at a time,

226
00:12:30,764 --> 00:12:32,605
and multiply that by the matrix a bunch of times,

227
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:35,346
and you'll know after every single turn in the game

228
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:36,986
what the possibility space is

229
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:39,187
in terms of which spaces you might be on

230
00:12:39,227 --> 00:12:40,067
with what probabilities.

231
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,468
It's a bit complicated

232
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,268
compared to most of the other topics in the course.

233
00:12:43,749 --> 00:12:45,631
And it's limited to some very specific situations,

234
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:47,254
but it's very powerful for getting

235
00:12:47,314 --> 00:12:49,036
exact mathematical solutions for things

236
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:50,258
that you couldn't do any other way.

237
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,140
If you haven't encountered this before,

238
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:53,903
there's a blog on a website called

239
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:56,487
datagenetics.com that has an analysis of games

240
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:58,249
like Candyland and Chutes and Ladders and things.

241
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,452
Very helpful primers on that kind of thing.

242
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:05,599
So now we've covered non-random transitive mechanics and also probability, and the next

243
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:09,101
thing we do is smash those two things together to learn how to balance transitive mechanics

244
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,262
that have a random or situational element to them.

245
00:13:11,902 --> 00:13:15,144
This is something that most students will have run into already in their earlier design

246
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:16,945
analysis of a TCG or similar game.

247
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:21,927
What do you do when a card, with a card, when it says you only get some benefit in a particular

248
00:13:21,987 --> 00:13:22,568
situation?

249
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:26,714
Like only if you're fully healed or only if the opponent has more than four cards in play or something.

250
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:31,200
And the short answer is that you come up with some kind of reasonable estimate for how often that benefit would trigger.

251
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:36,167
And you treat it as a probability. No different from saying 50% of the time you get this benefit or whatever.

252
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,833
the purest instance of situational balance I've seen is in tower defense games. And I like to

253
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:46,377
have the students play and analyze desktop tower defense 1.5 specifically. It's old enough that

254
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:49,540
many of them haven't played it before. It's historically important as one of the games that

255
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,124
popularized the genre. And almost everything in that game is situational. You have some towers

256
00:13:54,144 --> 00:13:57,927
that do area effect damage, which were great when enemies are clustered together but not when

257
00:13:57,947 --> 00:14:02,071
they're spread out. Towers that only hit flying or non-flying enemies or other towers that can

258
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:02,892
hit both but are less powerful.

259
00:14:02,932 --> 00:14:06,795
powerful. Towers that do no damage at all and just boost the power of the towers next to

260
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:11,258
them. So it all depends on where you put it and so on. The value of everything depends on

261
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,401
the board state and what kinds of enemies are in the next wave and what kinds of towers you

262
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:18,144
make. And if you really want students to go all in for this, you could even have a

263
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:22,147
tournament. See who can use their analysis to build the best tower loadout and give your

264
00:14:22,187 --> 00:14:23,749
excess GDC swag to the winners.

265
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:29,257
Then we take the stuff that we learned about numeric relationships and transitive systems

266
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:33,802
and put that together with probability again to examine reward systems and advancement

267
00:14:33,843 --> 00:14:34,804
and progression and pacing.

268
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,888
This includes things like random loot drop tables in RPGs so that you can make sure the

269
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:42,632
player doesn't get the ultimate sort of awesomeness plus five as a random drop in the first dungeon.

270
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:45,774
We also look at progression systems like leveling curves.

271
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:47,115
How many enemies do you have to kill

272
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:48,115
to gain a level on average?

273
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,516
How long is that expected to take in play time?

274
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,257
So you're trading off danger for time for advancement.

275
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:55,778
And also looking at advancement in the story,

276
00:14:55,838 --> 00:14:57,139
which is a reward in and of itself.

277
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,140
And then bringing in human psychology

278
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,041
and how a lot of little rewards spread out

279
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,082
provide more impact than a single big reward.

280
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:06,623
And how rewards on a random reinforcement schedule

281
00:15:06,663 --> 00:15:08,564
are more powerful than a fixed schedule, stuff like that.

282
00:15:09,064 --> 00:15:10,404
If you wanna place more emphasis on this,

283
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:12,425
you could easily make this a semester long project.

284
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:16,708
where you take a game like an old school JRPG and go through all the encounter and loot

285
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:20,650
and level charts and tables and use math to predict how long it will take a player to

286
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,432
grind through each area, when they'll level up and how often, and generally when is the

287
00:15:24,472 --> 00:15:27,954
player receiving some kind of reward, and then cross-referencing that reward schedule

288
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:31,817
with the most and least memorable events in areas in the game in order to understand from

289
00:15:31,857 --> 00:15:34,498
a mathematical perspective where the enjoyment of the game is coming from.

290
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:37,820
This is also another place where professional ethics comes up,

291
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,422
because reward schedules come up a lot in social and mobile games,

292
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:42,703
and also in the gambling industry,

293
00:15:43,023 --> 00:15:46,446
as ways to psychologically manipulate players to pay money or continue playing.

294
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:48,767
And there's the question of whether that is okay,

295
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:51,709
and if so, where do we cross the line into unethical behavior,

296
00:15:51,969 --> 00:15:53,890
and what do we as game designers do about it?

297
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:59,574
Next up we take a look at the reverse of probability which is statistics. In probability you know

298
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:03,276
the nature of the randomness and you use it to predict what the actual data will look

299
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:07,660
like, like the results of a die roll. In statistics you see the results and you use those to try

300
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,203
and derive the nature of the randomness that they arose from. Statistics is a bit harder

301
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:16,446
than probability because it's just as unintuitive, just as easy to get wrong and there's fewer

302
00:16:16,486 --> 00:16:20,229
sanity checks to alert you to being wrong. There are some people that have this saying

303
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:23,992
that numbers don't lie but in reality the data are always trying to trick you. They're

304
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:24,332
very mean.

305
00:16:25,613 --> 00:16:28,136
So once we learn some basic statistical tools like mean,

306
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:31,000
median, standard deviation, standard error, the Z test,

307
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,023
statistical significance, then we dive into analytics

308
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:36,206
to learn about what kinds of numbers we should record

309
00:16:36,226 --> 00:16:38,108
for a game and how we would use the results

310
00:16:38,148 --> 00:16:40,031
to determine whether the game was balanced or not.

311
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:46,238
Fighting and brawling games and MOBAs are great with this because you have a ton of characters that all have to be balanced against each other

312
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:52,244
in ways that don't easily lend themselves to being analyzed purely through math formulas and spreadsheeting that relate them to one another.

313
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:59,693
One exercise I like to do is give them, is to come up with metric, have them come up with a metrics plan for a game that they're working on themselves.

314
00:17:00,874 --> 00:17:06,218
You might be working on some small passion project like a simple board game or something,

315
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:11,301
but if you had a few thousand playtests and could record any data you wanted, give me a

316
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:14,864
question that you'd want to know the answer to, and then list what data you would collect to

317
00:17:14,884 --> 00:17:18,506
get an answer to that question, and then how would you interpret that data to get an answer?

318
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,108
Like, what would a positive or negative result look like?

319
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:24,112
And this is yet another place where professional ethics is

320
00:17:24,132 --> 00:17:27,257
discussed in regards to metrics driven design. If you find out

321
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:29,520
for example that changing a certain number or mechanic or

322
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,344
whatever leads to greater revenue but also reduces player

323
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,308
enjoyment, such as might be the case with mechanics that hold

324
00:17:35,328 --> 00:17:36,530
your player's accounts for ransom.

325
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,332
or that intentionally create pain points that can only be removed by paying money?

326
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:44,233
Is that something that's good? Is that something that's unfortunate but necessary?

327
00:17:44,634 --> 00:17:47,895
Or is it something that's a breach of professional ethics as a game designer?

328
00:17:48,495 --> 00:17:52,077
And as with other ethical questions raised in this class, I don't give any answers or opinions.

329
00:17:52,377 --> 00:17:55,298
I just point out that these are things that a game designer should be thinking about

330
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:57,839
and forming an opinion about, because if you don't,

331
00:17:57,879 --> 00:17:59,600
then someone else will make that decision for you.

332
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:04,646
The last thing we cover in the class is intransitive mechanics, that is, things like rock,

333
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:08,549
paper, scissors, where there's no concept of better or more powerful because it all depends

334
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:13,351
on what your opponent is doing. Something is strong against one thing and weak against another.

335
00:18:14,032 --> 00:18:16,934
And this is where we get into the fields of linear algebra and game theory,

336
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:21,536
dealing with payoff matrices and Nash equilibriums to solve these kinds of problems mathematically.

337
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:24,338
I think it's pretty fascinating that you can ask a question like,

338
00:18:24,658 --> 00:18:28,541
suppose we're playing rock, paper, scissors, but if I win with a rock, it counts double.

339
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:32,262
And if you win with a rock, it's just normal. And we're playing to best of 10.

340
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:36,283
You can actually use matrices and systems of equations to come up with a solution

341
00:18:36,603 --> 00:18:39,604
of exactly how often both of us should choose each throw

342
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:42,145
and how big of an advantage this is for me.

343
00:18:43,825 --> 00:18:47,006
So this is some of the mathiest, geekiest math that I cover in the class.

344
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:51,827
And frankly, it's not all that useful in a lot of games because it's very pure and it's very

345
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:52,988
work-intensive.

346
00:18:53,628 --> 00:18:55,708
But there are a lot of games where,

347
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,729
that have some kind of intransitive relationships.

348
00:18:58,209 --> 00:18:59,769
Any situation where you might use terms

349
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:01,269
like hard counter or soft counter,

350
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:03,310
which would include units in RTSs,

351
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,690
characters in fighting or brawling games or MOBAs,

352
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,651
character classes in MMOs, decks and strategies in TCGs,

353
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:10,751
all kinds of things like that.

354
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,952
So like Markov chains, I don't think that game theory

355
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:15,272
is used a lot in the field,

356
00:19:15,552 --> 00:19:17,432
but I do find it to be a really fascinating tool

357
00:19:17,472 --> 00:19:19,373
that's very powerful in the right situation.

358
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:21,073
So I want my students to encounter it.

359
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,602
So one thing I want to point out here is that actually playing games, either in class or as

360
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:32,864
homework, or maybe home play, is really important in this class. Math is not always

361
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:36,905
intuitive if you just write a bunch of equations on the board, but if you can see it in action,

362
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:41,667
it's a lot easier to grok what's going on. It's also useful to provide context, that the

363
00:19:41,707 --> 00:19:45,989
concepts we're learning here are useful and can be applied directly to analyze games or solve

364
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:50,090
real-world balance problems. In all the years I've been teaching this, I have not once been

365
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,111
asked the question, when will we ever use this?

366
00:19:54,615 --> 00:19:58,819
So students are seeing the theory and the application at the same time. That helps keep the

367
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:03,684
students engaged. Plus they love playing games as part of a course requirement and it lets me

368
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:07,347
introduce them to a number of games that I wouldn't normally be able to get them to play

369
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:10,651
otherwise. So that lets me add to their personal game canon as well.

370
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:14,873
Another thing this class lends itself to really well is PVP

371
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,755
mechanics, having students compete in some kind of game

372
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:20,376
balance or mathematical analysis task where the final

373
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:23,078
answer isn't clear, isn't obvious, and there are multiple

374
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:24,318
layers of potential analysis.

375
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:27,280
I have players either play on their own for a high score or

376
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,381
play against each other in class in a tournament.

377
00:20:29,902 --> 00:20:32,843
And I usually modify these games slightly, both to

378
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:35,365
simplify the constraints so the analysis space isn't as

379
00:20:35,405 --> 00:20:37,686
huge, and also to prevent the students from just using

380
00:20:37,726 --> 00:20:39,147
Google to find optimal strategies.

381
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:44,268
I also try to favor games that can be solved in a spreadsheet because spreadsheeting skills

382
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:48,169
are really important for game designers and for game balance in particular. So this serves

383
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:52,450
as a good practice for them. Cookie Clicker and Desktop Tower Defense I've mentioned already.

384
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,951
Battle of Battle was actually presented here by Eric Zimmerman last year and it's been

385
00:20:55,971 --> 00:21:00,652
a wonderful in class exercise for me. Cordial Minuet is a game designed by Jason Rohrer

386
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:06,773
that is a pure game theory problem. And I had to do some very heavy, uh, game design

387
00:21:07,374 --> 00:21:13,139
changes to that because two elements of the original game are real money gambling, which is

388
00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:19,124
required, and also satanic themes. So I had to remove those things, obviously. Pig is a

389
00:21:19,164 --> 00:21:23,528
traditional dice game that's a great example of calculating probabilities. And Gopu is an

390
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:28,512
intransitive game from the Suquoden series of JRPGs. You can just look all those up and

391
00:21:29,132 --> 00:21:30,534
probably figure out what's going on with that.

392
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:35,477
Another important topic that's distributed throughout the class is how to use spreadsheets

393
00:21:35,497 --> 00:21:39,179
because the vast majority of game balance problems can be solved in Excel and I want

394
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:46,263
students to be strongly proficient in spreadsheeting. I divide these things up and introduce them a few

395
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:50,025
at a time each week using the ones that are relevant to the problems that need to be solved

396
00:21:50,065 --> 00:21:50,466
that week.

397
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:54,987
I go into a lot of detail with this, mostly just pointing out features in Excel that are

398
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:58,268
useful and then asking them to use those features in their design work for the week.

399
00:21:58,688 --> 00:22:02,269
We cover formatting to make the spreadsheets look more readable and usable, various types

400
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:06,530
of graphs and charts that can be used to visualize data, how to comment your worksheet properly,

401
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:11,631
the same way that you would have to comment your code, how to use formulas at a very basic

402
00:22:11,671 --> 00:22:16,032
level, doing sorting and data validation, dealing with multiple worksheets and how to

403
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:17,793
format them for readability and usability.

404
00:22:18,273 --> 00:22:22,034
dealing with all the different ways to fill or copy and paste to save time, and showing

405
00:22:22,054 --> 00:22:25,656
them a wide variety of useful functions, of which there are too many to list in this slide.

406
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:29,998
One notable exception here is I do not get into writing scripts, such as VBScript in

407
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:33,979
Excel or the scripting language that they have with Google Sheets, because 99 times

408
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:38,361
out of 100, it isn't necessary, and it just makes things way more complicated, and I get

409
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:42,303
a lot of programming students that tend to default to writing script rather than learning

410
00:22:42,343 --> 00:22:43,203
the think in spreadsheets.

411
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:46,887
I want students to be able to think in terms of formulas here, not code.

412
00:22:47,307 --> 00:22:50,530
A typical case is a student who will write a thousand line script to implement an AI

413
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:54,274
to play a game and then I'll have to walk through it with them line by line to show

414
00:22:54,314 --> 00:22:57,557
them how to do exactly the same thing in about 50 cells instead.

415
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,579
Greatly condensed and way more readable.

416
00:23:01,238 --> 00:23:05,240
The class also lends itself to multi-part projects that are longer term.

417
00:23:05,641 --> 00:23:09,963
One is doing a design analysis of an existing game or part of an existing game.

418
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:14,166
I've had students do the math to derive the design thinking behind Hearthstone, Dominion,

419
00:23:14,446 --> 00:23:18,108
Netrunner and a number of other card games, figuring out the relationship between cost

420
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:22,591
and benefits and then creating a new 5 to 10 card mini expansion for the game with cards

421
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:26,473
all focused on a single mechanical theme that requires the student to invent a new mechanic

422
00:23:26,553 --> 00:23:27,974
and then figure out how much it costs.

423
00:23:28,955 --> 00:23:34,201
This kind of thing becomes particularly awesome in cases where I happen to know the designer of the game that a student is analyzing.

424
00:23:35,462 --> 00:23:40,203
In a lot of cases, designers are particularly amused that their own creative work, their

425
00:23:40,223 --> 00:23:42,404
own commercial work, is being used as a class assignment.

426
00:23:42,904 --> 00:23:45,725
And they're usually very happy to be available for questions from students.

427
00:23:46,045 --> 00:23:49,446
Though in my experience, the students are usually too intimidated to take advantage

428
00:23:49,486 --> 00:23:49,706
of this.

429
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:53,387
In the future, I'll probably organize a required Q&A or something like that.

430
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:57,448
The other benefit is that in some cases, I've been able to actually send the student work

431
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:01,569
to the designer for consideration in using their expansion as part of a future release.

432
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:06,793
Having a professional design credit for a class project is a kind of holy grail for the student in my class.

433
00:24:07,073 --> 00:24:10,956
It has not happened yet, but these things are slow, and the possibility is there.

434
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,779
For students working on other games, or for a different class, or just on their own passion projects,

435
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,361
analyzing their own games from a balance perspective,

436
00:24:18,622 --> 00:24:23,045
and creating mathematical models to improve the balance of their game, is also a useful way to go about this.

437
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:28,147
or just give them a game to balance. I created a game called Harmony that I presented before.

438
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:32,308
It's a very simple TCG with just four mechanics and the goal is to balance those mechanics with

439
00:24:32,328 --> 00:24:36,049
each other. Starts off completely broken intentionally and students have to figure

440
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:40,591
out how to relate these things to each other. Projects in this class are super important

441
00:24:40,951 --> 00:24:45,552
to practice these skills on real games because it's one thing to say make a game as a project,

442
00:24:45,812 --> 00:24:47,613
it's another to say now balance that game.

443
00:24:49,236 --> 00:24:52,659
I've also been working over the past couple of years to document everything in this class

444
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,521
and I now have the first draft manuscript for a complete book.

445
00:24:55,841 --> 00:25:00,525
The first draft is done and I will be talking to publishers here at GDC and shortly after.

446
00:25:00,845 --> 00:25:04,548
So if you want to run a class like this and you can wait a year or so to get it into your

447
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:07,089
curriculum, I should have a textbook ready for you before too long.

448
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,593
In the meantime, feel free to use what's available on Game Balance Concepts, even if it's an

449
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:15,316
earlier iteration, and feel free to write me after the show if you have any questions

450
00:25:15,356 --> 00:25:16,076
about it or anything.

451
00:25:17,137 --> 00:25:19,840
Thanks for listening and now I will be happy to take a couple of questions.

452
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:45,817
As a game designer, I actually run into this issue a lot in that I too am usually running,

453
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:49,759
or sorry, as a programmer, I'm usually writing a lot of code and I'm trying to code my way

454
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:51,700
around the things you're talking about with the spreadsheet.

455
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,502
It occurs to me that actually probably one other advantage in doing so much design through

456
00:25:56,522 --> 00:26:01,404
the spreadsheet is it probably creates a natural limitation as well to the scope.

457
00:26:01,604 --> 00:26:05,926
So does it, am I correct in that it actually probably helps to prevent scope creep, at

458
00:26:05,946 --> 00:26:07,347
least within ourselves?

459
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:11,851
I would say that probably is true. So the question is, would learning to do things,

460
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:18,037
balance in spreadsheets as opposed to code, you know, limit our, help to limit scope of

461
00:26:18,097 --> 00:26:24,943
complexity? I think that definitely would be true. You know, usually I have to, usually I

462
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:30,028
have to go the other direction in that trying to get them to stop using code in the first

463
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:33,230
place and just getting them to think in spreadsheets.

464
00:26:34,231 --> 00:26:35,672
Being able to think in terms of formulas,

465
00:26:35,932 --> 00:26:38,713
in terms of relationships between mathematical things.

466
00:26:38,853 --> 00:26:39,754
If you've got something,

467
00:26:39,774 --> 00:26:44,556
an algorithm that's super, super complicated,

468
00:26:45,116 --> 00:26:46,997
then analyzing it is very difficult.

469
00:26:47,457 --> 00:26:49,458
And if something is too difficult for you to analyze,

470
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:52,439
then it's too complex to be put in the game.

471
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:53,239
So yes.

472
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:55,920
Hello.

473
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:58,842
Do you ever talk about logic

474
00:26:59,282 --> 00:27:01,883
and how logic can connect to balance

475
00:27:01,963 --> 00:27:02,743
when it comes to design?

476
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:06,726
OK, can you clarify what you mean by logic?

477
00:27:06,746 --> 00:27:08,246
Because that's a very large term.

478
00:27:09,186 --> 00:27:14,487
So I often, with my students, realize that they don't

479
00:27:14,587 --> 00:27:17,848
understand the logic, generally, of maybe the

480
00:27:17,908 --> 00:27:19,688
puzzle or challenge that they're putting together.

481
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:23,549
And then when it comes to balancing that experience in

482
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:26,670
the game, like what's the difference between level one

483
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,210
and level two and the difficulty?

484
00:27:29,377 --> 00:27:32,081
Because they're not following, they're not thinking

485
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:33,543
through the logical problem.

486
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,526
They're having trouble just putting their head around,

487
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:37,850
what is the balance then of that player experience?

488
00:27:38,228 --> 00:27:42,010
Okay, so we're talking, do students have difficult time,

489
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,371
do I go into game logic and understanding these mechanics

490
00:27:45,411 --> 00:27:46,732
and how they relate to each other?

491
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:50,993
Because if students don't understand how the mechanics

492
00:27:51,013 --> 00:27:52,354
of the game work at a core level,

493
00:27:52,414 --> 00:27:54,155
then it's kind of hard to figure out how the numbers work.

494
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:54,755
Is that correct?

495
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:55,835
Is that what you're asking?

496
00:27:55,855 --> 00:27:58,737
But also the more sort of formal concepts of logic,

497
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:00,838
like spatial reasoning versus.

498
00:28:02,507 --> 00:28:08,530
different types of logic. In the current iteration I don't do that. As you've noticed there's a lot

499
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:14,152
that I am covering. That hasn't been a problem for me in my experience. I think a lot of it

500
00:28:14,213 --> 00:28:20,675
helps that I'm at RIT which has a very technical focus. So students understanding some kind of

501
00:28:20,755 --> 00:28:25,738
propositional logic and lambda calculus and things like that, they get exposed to that through

502
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:27,418
their computer science classes anyway.

503
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:32,641
For a less technical group, usually my biggest challenge is

504
00:28:32,661 --> 00:28:35,983
getting them to be able to have the mathematical thinking to

505
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:39,906
understand at a, you know, just an intuitive level how

506
00:28:39,946 --> 00:28:43,068
different numbers affect each other. And so logic would

507
00:28:43,108 --> 00:28:46,250
certainly be a part of that, but I'll take one challenge at a

508
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:46,450
time.

509
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:53,581
Hi, I work with a lot of teenage students, 13 to 17 mostly,

510
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:56,585
and I was wondering, for a mini course for that age range,

511
00:28:56,925 --> 00:28:59,188
what concept do you think you would start them on?

512
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:04,035
So this is, as you've noticed, I call this a math class

513
00:29:04,096 --> 00:29:05,897
that's cleverly disguised as game design.

514
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:08,558
That's kind of how I pitch it to other people here.

515
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:10,940
So one thing that I found is interesting

516
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,282
is that even though we get into some pretty heavy math,

517
00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:15,983
because it's contextualized in games

518
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:18,385
that students already understand and can already play,

519
00:29:19,065 --> 00:29:21,407
the math is, it has meaning.

520
00:29:22,587 --> 00:29:24,588
And all of a sudden you don't really,

521
00:29:24,868 --> 00:29:26,588
like the prerequisite for this class

522
00:29:26,688 --> 00:29:28,689
in terms of what math you've encountered in the past

523
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:34,550
is basically can you solve an equation from algebra one?

524
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:35,970
If you know how to do that,

525
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,511
I can scaffold everything else on top of that.

526
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:41,952
I would certainly take some of the more challenging parts

527
00:29:42,052 --> 00:29:46,053
like linear algebra and game theory out,

528
00:29:46,413 --> 00:29:47,833
or at least greatly simplify it.

529
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:50,814
Or just say this is something that exists,

530
00:29:51,194 --> 00:29:51,834
it's a lot harder.

531
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:54,376
It's a bit harder, it's beyond the scope of this course.

532
00:29:55,076 --> 00:30:00,701
This is for an audience of younger children and teenagers.

533
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:02,662
But most of this, it's,

534
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:08,126
usually it's not the actual mathematical skills

535
00:30:08,246 --> 00:30:09,687
and that's the challenge.

536
00:30:10,068 --> 00:30:13,530
Usually it's just building up the mathematical reasoning

537
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,371
and intuitive.

538
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,013
Which do you think is actually the most important concept

539
00:30:17,493 --> 00:30:18,434
that you should start in?

540
00:30:18,574 --> 00:30:20,656
Like, if you're like, okay, I got 10 hours to teach.

541
00:30:20,976 --> 00:30:21,636
What are you teaching them?

542
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:27,229
So I would say if you only have ten hours, how would I pick the

543
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,236
most important concepts in this class?

544
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:37,528
That's a good question. I would say I would go through, you know, the, I would go through

545
00:30:37,548 --> 00:30:43,272
numeric relationships and I would go through the balance of TCGs just because it's, you

546
00:30:43,312 --> 00:30:49,997
know, it's very pure, it's very related to like algebra. So it kind of builds on those

547
00:30:50,037 --> 00:30:55,341
skills that are probably going to be age appropriate at that range. And, you know, and it

548
00:30:55,401 --> 00:30:58,984
lets you, you know, and it relates it to games that a lot of them are playing right now

549
00:30:59,044 --> 00:31:00,004
already. So.

550
00:31:00,345 --> 00:31:01,345
Thanks. That was helpful.

551
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,282
I'm not sure if people are going to boot us out,

552
00:31:05,342 --> 00:31:06,603
but I'll keep answering questions

553
00:31:06,643 --> 00:31:07,784
until someone tells me to stop.

554
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:10,988
I have two questions.

555
00:31:11,188 --> 00:31:16,754
First, very simple, how many hours of course

556
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:20,538
and how many hours for the students represent the course

557
00:31:21,078 --> 00:31:21,999
and at which level?

558
00:31:23,017 --> 00:31:24,237
is given this course.

559
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:29,000
And the second question is, we have a quite similar course,

560
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,841
but we have taken the point of view

561
00:31:31,282 --> 00:31:35,744
that you can explain everything taking the point of view

562
00:31:35,784 --> 00:31:36,565
of game theory.

563
00:31:36,765 --> 00:31:39,347
If you want to go, you make games against nature

564
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:42,208
to introduce probability, and you

565
00:31:42,248 --> 00:31:46,231
can choose a game negotiation to explain other topics.

566
00:31:46,391 --> 00:31:48,512
What do you think about this point of view?

567
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:50,193
Because I understood that you are.

568
00:31:51,294 --> 00:31:57,776
game theory only at the end for non-transitive choice system.

569
00:31:57,996 --> 00:32:00,517
So let me repeat that back because I'm not sure I quite got

570
00:32:00,537 --> 00:32:03,659
that. So the first question is just how long does this take?

571
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,440
How many hours? In its current incarnation it's a three credit

572
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,782
hour class over 15 weeks. There are certainly things in there

573
00:32:12,802 --> 00:32:14,243
that I could cut if I had to take it down to 10.

574
00:32:15,783 --> 00:32:18,984
And for the second question you were asking about.

575
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:23,766
The second question is, in the course we are given,

576
00:32:23,886 --> 00:32:27,408
the whole contents that you have given

577
00:32:28,128 --> 00:32:32,010
is taken as different point of view from game theory.

578
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:36,031
For example, when we introduce probability,

579
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:38,932
we introduce probability as games against nature,

580
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:40,433
and things like that.

581
00:32:40,593 --> 00:32:41,833
So my question would.

582
00:32:42,413 --> 00:32:44,854
You introduce game theory only at the end?

583
00:32:45,794 --> 00:32:47,775
So yeah, the reason I do game theory at the end

584
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,955
is partly because it ties together

585
00:32:49,995 --> 00:32:52,696
a lot of other things we've been doing in there.

586
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,397
So it kind of requires you to understand

587
00:32:54,437 --> 00:32:56,377
a little bit about probability, a little bit

588
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:59,898
about transitive mechanics and how they relate to things.

589
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:02,739
There's all these, a little bit about human psychology

590
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,960
and just the idea that we can try to modern,

591
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,540
like that human brains aren't always mathematical.

592
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:14,423
you know, and bringing all, and also just encountering things like matrices and matrix

593
00:33:14,443 --> 00:33:19,285
multiplication in, when we talked about Markov chains. So all those things kind of are

594
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:23,448
prerequisites that lead up to this. That's part of the reason why it's at the end of the

595
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:28,770
course that I talk about game theory. The other side of this is, yeah, I mean, like I said,

596
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,070
it's not...

597
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:35,954
something that's widely used in the field as a tool, and it certainly has a lot of limitations to it.

598
00:33:36,694 --> 00:33:43,237
I just think it's kind of neat. And certainly, you're absolutely right, though, that even game theory doesn't always predict human behavior.

599
00:33:43,557 --> 00:33:53,962
And that is worth mentioning in that section. And I do mention that once your games get sufficiently complicated, where you need game theory in order to

600
00:33:54,822 --> 00:33:56,903
figure out things and you're working on things on multiple

601
00:33:56,943 --> 00:33:59,764
levels, it's probably too complicated for someone to

602
00:33:59,844 --> 00:34:02,825
actually solve it intuitively anyway and player behavior is

603
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:06,106
going to diverge from optimal math. But you could at least use

604
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:12,509
that to write a good AI. So. Okay. And I'm being told to

605
00:34:12,549 --> 00:34:13,769
stop. So thank you all.
