1
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:11,165
I'm Matt Thorson, I'm an indie game developer.

2
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:16,688
If you have heard of me, it's probably because of this game, Towerfall.

3
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:22,611
Towerfall is a local multiplayer game, but we're working on a single player game now,

4
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:23,772
and that's what I'm here to talk about.

5
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:25,773
It's called Celeste.

6
00:00:26,753 --> 00:00:29,955
I'm just going to show the trailer for it, just because the game's not out yet, we're

7
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:30,635
still working on it.

8
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:33,656
So I just wanted to sort of introduce it.

9
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:43,810
Woo!

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,050
Whoa!

11
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:44,230
Ah!

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:44,730
Ah!

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,370
Wah!

14
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,071
Ah!

15
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:46,251
Wha!

16
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:46,371
Ah!

17
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:46,451
Wah!

18
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:46,511
Ah!

19
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:46,571
Ah!

20
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:46,631
Ah!

21
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:46,731
Wah!

22
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:46,811
Wah!

23
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:46,871
Ah!

24
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:46,971
Ah!

25
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:47,031
Ah!

26
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:47,171
Wha!

27
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:47,391
Wah!

28
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:47,531
Ah!

29
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:47,691
Wah!

30
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:47,851
Ah!

31
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:47,932
Wah!

32
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:48,112
Wah!

33
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:32,150
Yeah, that's the last.

34
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,032
Thank you.

35
00:01:37,072 --> 00:01:39,794
So it's like a hard platform about climbing a mountain.

36
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:43,276
It has like, I've made about 300 levels for it so far.

37
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:45,977
We're probably going to be around 400 before it's out.

38
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:50,800
So I just want to talk about some, like our process and some ideas that are like swirling

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,360
around in my head.

40
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:53,287
as I make all those levels.

41
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,652
So this is how I like to visualize the game.

42
00:01:58,112 --> 00:02:00,074
I basically think of it as a fractal story,

43
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:02,357
or a story made up of smaller stories.

44
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,501
So at the game level, Celeste is about a girl climbing

45
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:09,104
a mountain, and she has these personal problems,

46
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:10,725
and she's kind of running away from them.

47
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:12,287
But by climbing the mountain, she

48
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:13,729
ends up having to confront those problems.

49
00:02:16,118 --> 00:02:19,761
And then, like most platformers, Celeste is split up into worlds.

50
00:02:20,242 --> 00:02:21,103
We call those areas.

51
00:02:21,443 --> 00:02:25,407
So each area is a smaller story within that story.

52
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:30,012
It has its own arc and pacing, and we want each one to feel distinct and unique.

53
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:33,975
And they all have aesthetic and mechanical themes running through them.

54
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:36,538
And then...

55
00:02:36,738 --> 00:02:36,938
Yeah.

56
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:37,679
Yeah.

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:38,920
Yeah.

58
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,105
And then each area in turn is made up of levels.

59
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:45,105
And each level is like a really small, quick story.

60
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,886
And these are just like really simple things

61
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:50,987
like I jump over a pit of spikes and dash upward

62
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:53,847
onto like an overhang and climb up to safety,

63
00:02:53,947 --> 00:02:54,607
that kind of story.

64
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:58,888
And visualizing each piece as a story

65
00:02:58,908 --> 00:03:01,289
is basically acts as our anchor

66
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:04,069
to like center all of our design decisions.

67
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:07,915
Yeah, it's really useful for that.

68
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:10,475
And in practice, it means we're constantly zooming

69
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:12,216
in and out to these three perspectives

70
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:13,837
to reevaluate our work.

71
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:19,478
So I'm just gonna start, jump right into levels

72
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:21,559
and our approach to making the individual levels.

73
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:25,760
So Celeste is about traversing space.

74
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,802
So I just wanna introduce the basic mechanics

75
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:30,522
of the game first.

76
00:03:30,662 --> 00:03:33,823
So the most basic move you have besides jumping is climbing.

77
00:03:33,983 --> 00:03:36,084
So you can climb the side of any solid block in the game.

78
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:39,505
and at least until your grip strength runs out.

79
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:42,407
Yeah, and your grip strength refills instantly

80
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:43,427
as soon as you touch the ground.

81
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,508
You also have this air dash ability,

82
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:48,029
which you can dash in eight directions,

83
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,370
so cardinals or diagonals.

84
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,131
You can only use it once in the air,

85
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:52,311
and just like your grip strength,

86
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:54,272
it refills instantly when you touch the ground.

87
00:03:57,093 --> 00:03:58,454
And then you have a wall jump.

88
00:03:58,474 --> 00:03:59,574
The wall jump is powerful

89
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:01,255
because it doesn't have a limited resource

90
00:04:01,295 --> 00:04:02,876
like those other moves.

91
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:05,717
You can do it as many times in the air as you want

92
00:04:05,757 --> 00:04:06,678
as long as you're next to a wall.

93
00:04:07,763 --> 00:04:09,144
However, it's not like...

94
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:12,066
Like, it pushes you away from the wall quite a bit,

95
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:13,948
so it's not like the Super Meat Boy wall jump,

96
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:16,290
where you can just sort of climb up a single wall

97
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,531
by wall jumping repeatedly.

98
00:04:18,111 --> 00:04:19,593
If you want to climb up a single wall like that,

99
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:21,775
you have to use your climb and use your grip strength.

100
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:25,926
So the moment-to-moment gameplay in Celeste

101
00:04:25,986 --> 00:04:28,048
is really inspired by real-life rock climbing.

102
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:30,990
And one dimension of rock climbing that I love

103
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,992
is the idea of multiple approaches.

104
00:04:33,952 --> 00:04:36,154
Because rock climbing uses your body

105
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:37,395
and everyone's body is different,

106
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:40,638
routes in rock climbing are usually designed loosely enough

107
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:43,600
that they can be solved in a lot of different ways.

108
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:47,591
And sometimes those differences are really big and obvious.

109
00:04:47,631 --> 00:04:48,952
Like if you have a really tall friend,

110
00:04:48,992 --> 00:04:50,594
who can just skip half a route.

111
00:04:51,575 --> 00:04:53,176
But usually they're really small differences,

112
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:56,679
like the way you decide to move your foot on a foothold

113
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,001
to shift your center of gravity,

114
00:04:58,221 --> 00:05:01,584
or where you brace yourself against the wall with your hand.

115
00:05:04,445 --> 00:05:06,645
And Celeste, like I said, is about traversing space,

116
00:05:06,845 --> 00:05:08,525
and vertical space is very important

117
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:09,726
because you're climbing a mountain.

118
00:05:09,746 --> 00:05:12,466
And our moveset overlaps in lots of different ways.

119
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:14,727
Like all those three moves I talked about

120
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:17,747
give you vertical progress,

121
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:19,187
but they use different resources

122
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:20,908
and have different nuances and trade-offs.

123
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,548
So you can approach stuff in a lot of different ways.

124
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:25,928
And when I started designing levels,

125
00:05:25,968 --> 00:05:27,669
I didn't really realize how important this was.

126
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:30,449
So I would design something like this challenge

127
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:32,930
with a very specific solution in mind,

128
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:36,758
I think for this one, my solution was the center one.

129
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,722
But playtesters never did things

130
00:05:39,762 --> 00:05:41,124
the way I wanted them to, obviously.

131
00:05:41,865 --> 00:05:45,651
And I just really started to learn the importance of this.

132
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:47,834
And a big part of playtesting now

133
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:49,917
is finding these different solutions and enabling them.

134
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:55,148
But so in general, we want our levels to be permissive

135
00:05:55,228 --> 00:05:57,069
because this makes them feel like really dynamic

136
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:58,170
and expressive for players.

137
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,592
But you have to draw the line somewhere, right?

138
00:06:00,712 --> 00:06:02,933
Because if you can approach everything from any angle,

139
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:04,654
you're not gonna challenge the player.

140
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,497
And it's really easy to keep, like after every play test,

141
00:06:08,517 --> 00:06:10,298
keep sanding off the corners of your levels.

142
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:12,819
until they're not so much levels as they are just

143
00:06:12,859 --> 00:06:14,439
like amorphous blobs of content.

144
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,820
And Celeste from a wider perspective

145
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,260
is supposed to be a hard game, right?

146
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,481
It's about climbing a mountain.

147
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:21,841
It's supposed to be challenging.

148
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:25,882
So one thing that's been hard for me is making a hard game

149
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:29,422
without it just turning into this rigid series

150
00:06:29,482 --> 00:06:31,823
of precise inputs the player has to do exactly

151
00:06:31,843 --> 00:06:34,624
as I tell them to, to still let the player be creative

152
00:06:35,384 --> 00:06:36,664
but not make the game easy.

153
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:42,052
So the way I found that balance was to go back

154
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:43,593
to focusing on the story of the level,

155
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:45,054
using the story as an anchor.

156
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:48,417
So for example, the story of this level

157
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:51,960
is that the player has to climb up the side of this block,

158
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,822
but as soon as they grab it, it starts shaking and falls.

159
00:06:55,923 --> 00:06:56,804
So they have to do it quickly.

160
00:06:57,124 --> 00:06:58,485
And then there's these spikes on the left

161
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:02,368
that sort of, the two spikes poking out on the top left.

162
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:04,690
So if you jump too soon, those spikes kill you.

163
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,151
So there's the tension of you wanna jump,

164
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:07,452
but you have to wait long enough to jump.

165
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:09,217
And then once you get on that ledge,

166
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:10,778
you kind of have to pump yourself up

167
00:07:10,818 --> 00:07:13,480
for this difficult series of jumps to get to the end.

168
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:19,064
And so to show how that story kind of steered us,

169
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:20,565
I just went back in version control.

170
00:07:20,585 --> 00:07:22,046
This is the very first draft of that level.

171
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,768
And the pieces of that story are all there,

172
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:27,990
except notably those spikes on the top left aren't there,

173
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,112
because it took me some playtesting to realize

174
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:31,773
that that story of climbing up that block

175
00:07:32,213 --> 00:07:33,574
wasn't interesting without that tension.

176
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,051
So here's the next revision where I added those spikes.

177
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:39,993
I also made these falling blocks more forgiving.

178
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:43,635
So making that left falling block taller

179
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:46,216
means that you can get onto it with more dash angles.

180
00:07:47,877 --> 00:07:49,838
And this makes it more permissive, multiple approaches.

181
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:50,799
Right?

182
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:51,619
So.

183
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,652
Clinging to the block, it was all right to make that block

184
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:59,914
getting onto it easier, because how you get onto that block

185
00:07:59,954 --> 00:08:01,735
is not important to the story of the level.

186
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,816
Like, clinging onto the block and climbing it

187
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:07,097
has to feel precarious, and that's why it's hovering

188
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:10,018
over these spikes, but the story of the level

189
00:08:10,058 --> 00:08:11,338
is about climbing up the side of it

190
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:12,879
and jumping off at the right time, right?

191
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,960
So making getting onto it more permissive

192
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,121
lets us put the spotlight on the part of the level

193
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:20,482
that actually, the story we're actually trying to tell.

194
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:22,887
And when the player thinks back to this level,

195
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:24,549
we want them to remember that story,

196
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,652
not some annoying jump at the start of the level.

197
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:31,654
And then playtesting this, another huge problem comes up

198
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:34,797
where players just try to skip directly to the second block.

199
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,519
And it's actually possible to get to it

200
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,020
and grab the side of it, but once you

201
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,621
grab the side of a falling block, it falls,

202
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:42,303
and you just have nowhere to go, and you die.

203
00:08:43,604 --> 00:08:45,265
So of course, this shouldn't be possible

204
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,927
because it skips that whole story we

205
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:48,168
had set up for the level.

206
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,870
And it replaces it with just a really lame one,

207
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,471
just like an annoyingly precise jump.

208
00:08:54,945 --> 00:08:56,748
But it wasn't enough that it was already impossible.

209
00:08:56,788 --> 00:08:58,370
It has to be obviously impossible.

210
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,233
Otherwise players just tunnel vision on it

211
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:03,257
and keep going for a surprisingly long time

212
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:04,279
and get really frustrated.

213
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:08,974
So the next revision, just pull these spikes up,

214
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:11,955
this makes it so the player has to dash sooner,

215
00:09:11,975 --> 00:09:14,677
and they can't even get close to that block.

216
00:09:14,837 --> 00:09:18,499
So they stop trying this after like one or two tries.

217
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,681
And playtesting has also been really important for this,

218
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,142
for finding these routes that are impossible,

219
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:25,743
but not obviously impossible,

220
00:09:26,884 --> 00:09:28,364
because those really negatively affect

221
00:09:28,404 --> 00:09:29,885
the player's experience in this kind of game.

222
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:33,927
And just for fun, here's all the revisions

223
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:35,348
of the level from the very start.

224
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:39,084
Yeah, I do a lot of stuff.

225
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:41,486
I try putting spikes on that second falling block

226
00:09:41,526 --> 00:09:43,627
for a little bit, but it just ends up being annoying

227
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:44,468
and restrictive.

228
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:47,690
I shave off ceiling tiles and add platforms and stuff.

229
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,592
But the important thing is that the story

230
00:09:50,612 --> 00:09:51,652
of the level never changed.

231
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,854
If I found that the story of this level

232
00:09:54,914 --> 00:09:57,036
just didn't fit in the area it was in

233
00:09:57,116 --> 00:09:58,417
or it was just a bad story,

234
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:00,378
then I would just scrap the level

235
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:02,039
or try to adapt the story into something else.

236
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:04,601
But the story is always the cornerstone of the design.

237
00:10:08,432 --> 00:10:12,554
This is a screenshot from SGDQ, the last SGDQ marathon.

238
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:15,835
We did this four day prototype of Celeste in PICO-8

239
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,055
and they did a run of it at the last SGDQ.

240
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:21,777
It was like a two and a half minute run.

241
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:23,837
And the way speed runners play this game

242
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:25,018
is really inspiring to us.

243
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:31,248
So it actually is possible to skip the intended path in that level.

244
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:33,430
It's just like really difficult.

245
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:37,713
And this is intentional, this is a pass we do on levels where we try to add these.

246
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:41,996
It's just really important that no one ever mistakes this for the intended path.

247
00:10:42,577 --> 00:10:47,781
And like no person on their first time through the game is going to have the skills or understanding of the systems to do this.

248
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,972
So I just have like this mental list of different techniques

249
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:52,553
that we never teach the player,

250
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:56,155
and we never require them to use to beat the game normally,

251
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:59,417
but we just like, they're fair game for skips like these.

252
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:03,459
Here's another one where the player has to do this

253
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,441
like long dash jump that we never teach them how to do.

254
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:09,523
And they also have to know that when you go through

255
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,724
this level transition, it refills your dash

256
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,125
as though you had touched the ground.

257
00:11:14,286 --> 00:11:15,287
And we never teach that either.

258
00:11:15,387 --> 00:11:17,208
So only the best players are gonna figure this out.

259
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:21,060
And as far as multiple approaches in rock climbing goes,

260
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,160
this is like when you go to the rock gym

261
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,581
and there's that one person that's just super ripped

262
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:27,061
and doing all the routes with just their arms.

263
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,462
And if someone wants to put the effort

264
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:31,762
to get that good at our game,

265
00:11:31,782 --> 00:11:33,723
we want to reward them for it.

266
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:36,983
So using these techniques and a few others,

267
00:11:37,023 --> 00:11:38,944
you can break pretty much all of our levels.

268
00:11:40,504 --> 00:11:42,685
And I kind of see this as a second story to the level.

269
00:11:43,145 --> 00:11:45,665
As long as no one on their first playthrough of the game

270
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:47,126
thinks this is the way to do it.

271
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:50,747
then coming back to a level later and just breaking it

272
00:11:50,787 --> 00:11:53,967
with sheer skill and determination is a really cool

273
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:55,308
second layer to the level.

274
00:11:59,169 --> 00:11:59,549
Excuse me.

275
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:03,970
Another thing I love about climbing is the idea,

276
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,470
oh, that didn't work.

277
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,170
Okay, another thing I like, oh.

278
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:12,132
Sorry.

279
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:16,414
I'm missing a slide.

280
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,476
Okay, well another thing I love about the climbing

281
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:19,516
is the idea of safety.

282
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:24,079
So, in a climbing route, you have to do a series of moves

283
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:25,159
obviously to get to the top.

284
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,141
But between each move, you're hanging onto the wall

285
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,061
in a different position.

286
00:12:30,158 --> 00:12:32,079
And some of those positions are more safe than others.

287
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:34,841
And they're also more or less safe in different ways.

288
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:38,262
Like, for example, you could be using a lot of core strength

289
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:41,264
to balance on a hold, or you could be using a lot of finger

290
00:12:41,284 --> 00:12:43,205
strength to grip a really shallow hold.

291
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:46,267
And this is something I think about a lot in Celeste.

292
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:50,129
So different positions in Celeste

293
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:51,490
are safe in different ways.

294
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,973
So standing on solid ground is typically completely safe

295
00:12:55,013 --> 00:12:56,294
as long as you're not in imminent danger

296
00:12:56,314 --> 00:12:58,156
and it refills your dash and your grip.

297
00:12:59,097 --> 00:13:00,658
Clinging to a wall is usually pretty safe,

298
00:13:00,878 --> 00:13:03,481
but you'll run out of grip strength eventually and fall off.

299
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:06,584
And then there's these crumbling and falling blocks

300
00:13:06,764 --> 00:13:10,968
where if you stand on them, you'll get your dash back

301
00:13:11,008 --> 00:13:13,270
and refill your grip, but obviously you have to move quickly

302
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,291
before they disappear.

303
00:13:16,724 --> 00:13:20,207
So using the idea of safety is probably the biggest way

304
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:22,188
I control the pacing of levels in Celeste.

305
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:26,252
So a level with hard moves but safe holds between them

306
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,895
feels very different from a level with a lot of easy moves

307
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:31,156
but no safety between them.

308
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:34,920
And we can have different kinds of safety

309
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,062
and we can give optional safety out of the way.

310
00:13:37,422 --> 00:13:38,923
Like there's a lot of ways to use this idea

311
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:41,305
to make levels more dynamic and varied and interesting.

312
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:46,390
And this level is an example of one where there's safe resting spots between every move,

313
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,172
but the moves themselves are very difficult and the level's long, so it makes it a really

314
00:13:50,252 --> 00:13:51,753
slow, tense experience.

315
00:13:53,943 --> 00:13:56,627
Whereas this level on the flip side is very short,

316
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:58,529
but has like no safety in the middle.

317
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,453
Like these spikes, they're just poking out a little bit

318
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,297
after you touch them, a short while after they poke out

319
00:14:04,337 --> 00:14:05,098
and then they stay out.

320
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:08,342
So area you've covered before becomes unsafe

321
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:09,544
and you have to keep moving

322
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:11,786
and the level ends up feeling like one fluid motion

323
00:14:11,826 --> 00:14:12,788
even though it's lots of moves.

324
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:17,790
And in this level, the player has to touch

325
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,911
all these flashing switches to open the gate.

326
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,213
And these moving platforms, they have springs on them

327
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:25,334
that bounce you up and refill your dash and your grip.

328
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:27,915
So there's like a lot of different kinds of safety

329
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:29,816
in this level, and the player can use them in any order

330
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:30,656
and mix and match them.

331
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:34,818
And also go for the switches in any order they want.

332
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:38,980
And here's one way to do it.

333
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:41,725
When I'm prototyping new game objects,

334
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,852
I am really thinking about how they interact

335
00:14:45,872 --> 00:14:49,579
with these ideas of multiple approaches and safety.

336
00:14:53,313 --> 00:14:55,254
So most of the levels in Celeste are very short.

337
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:57,376
We just want to avoid repetition.

338
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,157
There's a lot of single screen stages.

339
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:00,778
The game doesn't have any checkpoints really.

340
00:15:00,918 --> 00:15:02,359
If you die, you just go back to the start

341
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:03,720
of the level you just were in.

342
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:06,962
And players die a lot, obviously, it's a hard game.

343
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:09,524
And there'll be repeating stages a lot.

344
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:11,266
So we just don't want to take away

345
00:15:11,306 --> 00:15:12,546
player progress very often.

346
00:15:14,657 --> 00:15:17,697
But thinking about length ties into the idea of safety

347
00:15:17,757 --> 00:15:20,598
because any time the player reaches a spot

348
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:22,498
of complete safety, where they're just standing

349
00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:25,219
on solid ground with no danger, we have to question

350
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,159
why we aren't just ending the level at that point.

351
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,160
And if we ever decide not to end the level,

352
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,800
the reason is to raise the stakes.

353
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,560
The longer a level is, the higher the stakes are

354
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,641
because you lose more progress when you die.

355
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:39,761
And high stakes really change the feel of a level

356
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:42,462
and really amplify the difficulty of everything

357
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:43,062
because of stress.

358
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:46,814
we just have to really make sure that long levels

359
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:49,055
can support repetition, especially the start of them.

360
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:52,816
In general, levels get longer as the game goes on,

361
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:54,097
but throughout the whole game,

362
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:55,697
we have a few very long levels

363
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,958
that we use carefully and sparingly,

364
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:01,440
mostly for pacing at really intense story moments

365
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,280
to make it more memorable.

366
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:07,865
Okay, I'm gonna talk a bit about our area design now.

367
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:10,208
It feels, arranging the areas in Celeste

368
00:16:10,248 --> 00:16:12,430
feels a lot like arranging a song,

369
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:14,152
but I'm getting ahead of myself.

370
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:15,033
I'll talk about that in a bit.

371
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,791
Areas in Celeste are a lot like Metroid maps,

372
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:22,693
so the rooms are all connected and seamless,

373
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:24,394
so you can move from level to level.

374
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,176
There can be branching paths,

375
00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:29,077
there can be secret branches,

376
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:31,098
you can go back to previous levels, that kind of thing.

377
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:34,480
The system is versatile enough that different areas

378
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:35,861
can experiment with different structures.

379
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:39,984
This is our editor we use to click the levels together

380
00:16:40,144 --> 00:16:40,705
into our maps.

381
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:46,060
Just like with the levels, stories are anchored for these.

382
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:48,942
So we want every area to have a unique

383
00:16:48,962 --> 00:16:49,943
and interesting story arc.

384
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:52,705
And we want the experience of the player

385
00:16:52,765 --> 00:16:55,046
to match the emotional experience of the protagonist.

386
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:57,628
So that hopefully the whole game is always working together

387
00:16:57,668 --> 00:16:58,709
toward a singular purpose.

388
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:01,691
We're always looking for ways to offload our narrative

389
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:02,651
onto our level design.

390
00:17:04,693 --> 00:17:05,953
So for example, in this area,

391
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:10,376
the player is helping an NPC clean out an abandoned resort.

392
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,625
But the guy you're helping is kinda messed up

393
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:15,975
and he's not really appreciative or like.

394
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:18,830
and he's kind of trying to trap you in the resort

395
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:19,531
as you're doing this.

396
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:22,392
And this highlighted part is like,

397
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:23,372
you're on the home stretch

398
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:25,093
and the levels are picking up in difficulty

399
00:17:25,113 --> 00:17:27,354
and your character's starting to get frustrated

400
00:17:27,374 --> 00:17:29,856
with this guy and getting frustrated

401
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:31,617
that she's being roped into helping him.

402
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,097
And at the end of this part,

403
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:35,378
there's a narrative beat where she snaps at him.

404
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:38,420
And our goal is to make that emotional transition happen

405
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,961
on the player's side as much as possible

406
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:41,501
to make them feel like,

407
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,562
why am I going to all this trouble for this guy?

408
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:45,203
Like, he better give me something good for this.

409
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:48,364
And by the end of it, hopefully you're done with that guy's shit.

410
00:17:51,124 --> 00:17:54,245
So I start an area with a vague structure in mind

411
00:17:54,465 --> 00:17:56,926
and a general sense of what has to happen

412
00:17:56,946 --> 00:17:59,926
based on zooming out and looking at its place in the bigger game story.

413
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:04,807
And I prototype unique game elements and interactions for that area

414
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:06,867
and search for a concrete story arc for it.

415
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,608
But at this point, there's kind of a chicken and egg problem

416
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:13,029
because we don't know the story of the area yet

417
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:15,329
and we also don't know the story of the levels in the area.

418
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:17,819
that really make up what the area is,

419
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:19,222
and we want the two to be in sync.

420
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:22,911
So I don't really have a solution for this,

421
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:26,098
so I just kinda used it as an opportunity to experiment.

422
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,721
So I approached some areas by mapping out

423
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:32,063
like the whole thing on paper first

424
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:34,184
and then just trying to fill it in with actual levels.

425
00:18:35,825 --> 00:18:38,307
And other areas I just like doodled in our level editor

426
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:40,328
for like three days and then without really thinking

427
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:41,169
about how they would connect

428
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:42,250
and then tried to put them together.

429
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,252
And I also tried to draw on different inspirations

430
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:45,932
for each area.

431
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:48,474
So like one area is kind of inspired by Undead Burg

432
00:18:48,514 --> 00:18:50,716
from Dark Souls or Brinstar from Super Metroid

433
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,017
or the Bathhouse from Spirited Away.

434
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:58,096
But of course, whatever approach I took,

435
00:18:58,676 --> 00:18:59,497
it never matches up.

436
00:18:59,697 --> 00:19:01,678
I always discover that the level drafts

437
00:19:01,718 --> 00:19:04,419
and the area drafts just are incompatible in some way.

438
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,161
And we just kind of have to match them together

439
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:10,202
slowly and painstakingly.

440
00:19:12,464 --> 00:19:14,525
For example, when I'm mapping on an area,

441
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:15,865
I'll say, and here's 10 levels

442
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:17,546
where I just have bouncy cloud levels

443
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:19,707
that use this bouncy cloud mechanic.

444
00:19:19,847 --> 00:19:21,268
But then when I go to make those levels,

445
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:22,909
if I can't get 10 good levels

446
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:24,370
that fit there out of bouncy clouds,

447
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:24,570
then...

448
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:26,443
we have to rethink things.

449
00:19:26,503 --> 00:19:28,345
Or maybe I'll get 20 levels out of Bouncy Clouds

450
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:29,686
and I'm like, what do I do with these levels?

451
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,511
And we never really got anything right on the first try.

452
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:38,253
Everything changed, but the areas

453
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:40,275
and the individual levels had to adapt.

454
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,957
Nothing came into this game fully formed.

455
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:45,960
And we throw out a lot of work.

456
00:19:46,941 --> 00:19:48,762
Like just last month I threw out 20 levels

457
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:51,164
from our latest area because they just didn't fit the mood.

458
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:54,609
So our approach kind of feels like

459
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:56,150
brute force stubbornness here, I guess.

460
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,291
It doesn't sound clever, but we just keep like

461
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:00,753
zooming in and out to these three different perspectives

462
00:20:01,194 --> 00:20:04,476
and just to see if what we're doing is connecting

463
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:08,419
and just kind of doing our best to redo things

464
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:09,900
until it connects at all three levels.

465
00:20:12,783 --> 00:20:14,904
And we always end up with extra levels,

466
00:20:15,425 --> 00:20:17,446
so we added this hard mode where we can just put.

467
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,782
The difficulty's higher, so we typically make levels

468
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,404
harder for this, but it's just a place to put

469
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:26,227
cool mechanical ideas that don't fit into the story

470
00:20:26,347 --> 00:20:28,949
of the main game, so we can just fully explore

471
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:29,810
the design space.

472
00:20:33,093 --> 00:20:35,575
So when I'm arranging the areas,

473
00:20:35,595 --> 00:20:39,178
I'm really thinking about the story of each level

474
00:20:39,218 --> 00:20:40,559
and where it fits into the area's story.

475
00:20:41,864 --> 00:20:43,585
And because our areas can be non-linear,

476
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,947
we have to think about bottlenecks for narratives,

477
00:20:47,007 --> 00:20:48,528
like cut scenes, and also for teaching.

478
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:51,629
And it often feels like arranging a song

479
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,771
because so much is about pacing and framing.

480
00:20:55,071 --> 00:20:56,472
And you want to do something cool

481
00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:58,093
with the overall structure of the song,

482
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,934
but you always have to be aware of whether your melody

483
00:20:59,974 --> 00:21:00,994
can support that structure.

484
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:05,036
So, an example.

485
00:21:05,997 --> 00:21:07,638
The initial concept for this area.

486
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:11,504
was just a simple boss sequence where you're being chased

487
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,964
by a dark version of yourself.

488
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:14,185
You go up the left side of this tower

489
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:15,165
and back down the right side.

490
00:21:16,106 --> 00:21:17,686
And I designed this really cool chase sequence,

491
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:19,307
and these are actually some of my favorite levels

492
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:21,588
in the game, but what surprised me here

493
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:24,049
is how, as a story, when it was done,

494
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:25,129
it just felt very flat.

495
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,891
So to make a satisfying story out of this chase,

496
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:32,092
we had to add all of this framing around it.

497
00:21:32,512 --> 00:21:35,153
And in the end, most of this area is just there for framing.

498
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,972
just to like foreshadow and ramp up to the chase

499
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:41,514
and give it context and then properly cool down from it

500
00:21:41,554 --> 00:21:44,577
and move the narrative forward in a satisfying way.

501
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:49,501
So at the start, we have the slow exploration section.

502
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:51,463
It's very like easy and free form.

503
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:53,705
We want it to feel like dreamlike and mysterious.

504
00:21:54,265 --> 00:21:55,927
And the challenge here to progress

505
00:21:56,007 --> 00:21:57,628
doesn't really involve mechanical skill.

506
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:59,410
It's about like perception and exploration.

507
00:22:01,884 --> 00:22:03,887
Then there's this narrative beat,

508
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:05,990
and these mysterious blocks change

509
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,653
so that you can surf through them with your dash.

510
00:22:08,854 --> 00:22:10,336
Now all the side paths open up,

511
00:22:10,437 --> 00:22:11,999
and you can do all these optional challenges.

512
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:14,783
We just wanted this to be really exhilarating,

513
00:22:14,823 --> 00:22:16,746
like you just realized you could fly in a dream.

514
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,661
And then the dream kind of morphs into a nightmare

515
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:23,462
and we have that chase sequence

516
00:22:23,502 --> 00:22:24,822
that the whole area is based around.

517
00:22:25,703 --> 00:22:27,884
And it climaxes with this long, brutal level

518
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:28,964
on the right side.

519
00:22:28,984 --> 00:22:31,125
And this is the first time in the game

520
00:22:31,145 --> 00:22:33,006
we have continuous time pressure like this,

521
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:34,507
so it's very stressful and it's meant to be

522
00:22:35,027 --> 00:22:36,508
a panicked feeling.

523
00:22:36,528 --> 00:22:39,329
And we're setting up the main conflict of the story here.

524
00:22:42,398 --> 00:22:44,659
And then we have this cool down section with easier levels

525
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:47,540
ending with a cut scene where the main character realizes

526
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,801
she's dreaming and kind of resolves the chase for now.

527
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:53,142
It took me a long time to realize that this area

528
00:22:53,162 --> 00:22:54,643
shouldn't have any risk of death.

529
00:22:54,963 --> 00:22:57,204
Like at one point, a couple weeks ago,

530
00:22:57,224 --> 00:22:58,725
I just went through and deleted all the spikes

531
00:22:58,765 --> 00:23:00,105
from these levels and they got way better.

532
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:03,046
Just to keep the player engaged

533
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:04,807
after such a crazy challenge,

534
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:08,208
we just had to dial down the difficulty way down to zero.

535
00:23:10,262 --> 00:23:11,662
And then finally, your character wakes up,

536
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:13,722
and this is just this really simple section

537
00:23:13,762 --> 00:23:16,123
where you run through a bunch of the same levels,

538
00:23:16,243 --> 00:23:17,743
but they're all subtly different,

539
00:23:17,843 --> 00:23:19,483
like none of the dream elements are there.

540
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:23,444
And this gives us space for some optional NPC dialogue,

541
00:23:23,564 --> 00:23:26,345
and also gives us a nice calm ending

542
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,065
to this rollercoaster of an area.

543
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:34,646
So teaching is also really relevant

544
00:23:34,686 --> 00:23:37,026
to how we arrange the areas in Celeste.

545
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:40,332
This is a level late in the first area.

546
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:43,255
There's these blocks that move when you touch them,

547
00:23:43,675 --> 00:23:44,616
and the player has to figure out

548
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:45,918
that they can grab the side of it,

549
00:23:46,478 --> 00:23:48,480
and ride it, and jump off at the last moment

550
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,541
to boost across this gap.

551
00:23:50,983 --> 00:23:52,685
This level illustrates our approach to teaching.

552
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,127
Obviously, if you just drop the player

553
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:55,908
straight into this level,

554
00:23:55,948 --> 00:23:58,030
they would have no idea how to do this,

555
00:23:58,151 --> 00:23:59,052
and would never get past it.

556
00:24:00,173 --> 00:24:02,697
But with Celeste, our goal is to teach implicitly

557
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:04,719
with the level design as much as possible.

558
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,463
And the only text we use to teach is the text

559
00:24:07,483 --> 00:24:09,265
to tell you the controls at the very start of the game.

560
00:24:12,303 --> 00:24:14,825
So the first way we do this is by priming the player.

561
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:17,266
This is the very first time you see one of those blocks,

562
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:19,868
and if you just do the obvious thing and jump off of it,

563
00:24:20,248 --> 00:24:21,949
it flings you into these spikes and kills you.

564
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,691
So killing the player is the most obvious way

565
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:26,612
to teach people in Celeste,

566
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:28,613
because you lose so little when you die.

567
00:24:29,794 --> 00:24:31,635
And death is also so jarring

568
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:33,957
that it forces the player to confront what happened.

569
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:39,680
But we also just have a lot of levels before that point.

570
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:42,400
or before we require them to use it,

571
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,862
where the momentum isn't an obstacle,

572
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:46,844
but it's just relevant to navigating the space.

573
00:24:47,645 --> 00:24:51,007
And they might not consciously be aware that it's happening,

574
00:24:51,088 --> 00:24:53,089
but it will be logged somewhere in their subconscious.

575
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:57,713
And then after all that stuff,

576
00:24:58,294 --> 00:24:59,335
the player reaches this level.

577
00:24:59,835 --> 00:25:02,177
And here we're asking them to have a realization

578
00:25:02,357 --> 00:25:03,578
about the game system, right?

579
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,620
Like they have to become consciously aware

580
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,661
of these momentum mechanics,

581
00:25:06,701 --> 00:25:08,202
and then they have to use it in a new way.

582
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:11,189
So when playtesters get here and figure this out

583
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:14,512
without any additional help, they really love this level.

584
00:25:15,272 --> 00:25:16,874
Because they had to think creatively

585
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:18,535
and the game trusted them to solve it.

586
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,157
But most of our playtesters get stuck here.

587
00:25:22,698 --> 00:25:25,741
And Celeste, like our goal with Celeste

588
00:25:25,801 --> 00:25:27,282
isn't like no player left behind,

589
00:25:27,362 --> 00:25:29,764
like it's a hard game and it's okay for people to get stuck.

590
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,575
Like, where you draw that line of how much you're expecting out of the player is, in the end, arbitrary.

591
00:25:36,096 --> 00:25:41,102
But, I just, like, for the first area, I just didn't want everyone to get stuck here, pretty much.

592
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:46,089
Uh, and like, Celeste is a hard game, but I also want it to be easier than it looks.

593
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,765
So the solution I arrived at here

594
00:25:50,246 --> 00:25:51,506
was to add this left branch.

595
00:25:52,026 --> 00:25:53,927
And if you go up the left branch,

596
00:25:54,187 --> 00:25:55,308
there's just these two levels.

597
00:25:55,408 --> 00:25:57,449
The whole point of them is just to teach you very clearly

598
00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:00,190
the steps you need to beat that level.

599
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,910
And most players go through this,

600
00:26:02,431 --> 00:26:04,732
and then it pops them out right back where they started,

601
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:06,072
and then they have that light bulb moment.

602
00:26:08,093 --> 00:26:09,213
The second level here,

603
00:26:09,574 --> 00:26:11,034
where you have to do the sideways boost,

604
00:26:11,514 --> 00:26:12,455
that one literally locks,

605
00:26:12,535 --> 00:26:13,915
like that platform locks you in.

606
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:15,396
So there's no other move you can do

607
00:26:15,456 --> 00:26:16,557
than do the boost you have to do.

608
00:26:17,942 --> 00:26:19,963
And one really important part of this solution is that

609
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:22,864
it never gets in the way of the good players.

610
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,965
Like, the players who could solve it on their own

611
00:26:25,265 --> 00:26:26,005
can still do that.

612
00:26:26,345 --> 00:26:27,625
It's completely invisible to them.

613
00:26:28,226 --> 00:26:30,966
And ideally, players from a wide range of skills

614
00:26:30,986 --> 00:26:34,167
can play this game, and it'll teach them all

615
00:26:34,207 --> 00:26:36,388
how to play it silently, like without them noticing.

616
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,089
And through the course of the game,

617
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:40,649
you learn a lot of things this way, right?

618
00:26:42,275 --> 00:26:44,015
And at the end of the game, we have callbacks

619
00:26:44,055 --> 00:26:44,776
to all those things.

620
00:26:45,316 --> 00:26:47,577
And hopefully, the player will look back

621
00:26:47,637 --> 00:26:49,437
and see how far they've come at that moment,

622
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:50,618
because that's a powerful feeling.

623
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:53,679
Like, it's not unlike looking back

624
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,159
from the top of a mountain you just climbed.

625
00:26:58,181 --> 00:26:59,981
And yeah, that is my talk.

626
00:27:07,444 --> 00:27:08,904
I think we probably have time for questions,

627
00:27:09,185 --> 00:27:11,265
so if you guys want to do that.

628
00:27:12,418 --> 00:27:13,038
There's two mics.

629
00:27:19,443 --> 00:27:21,245
Did you see I take her end talk?

630
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:23,426
I'm probably pronouncing his name wrong.

631
00:27:24,007 --> 00:27:24,447
No, I didn't.

632
00:27:25,128 --> 00:27:26,249
It was really good.

633
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:27,850
It went through some of the techniques.

634
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,070
Cool.

635
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:29,331
Hey.

636
00:27:37,497 --> 00:27:37,657
Hey.

637
00:27:38,822 --> 00:27:45,010
great talk. Uh, I was wondering how much of the QA you kind of like rely on yourself and going

638
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:48,674
back to levels again after you've had time to think about it and how much you give to like

639
00:27:48,714 --> 00:27:54,522
other people for testing. Yeah, like playtesting is really the center of like, it's so

640
00:27:54,562 --> 00:27:55,663
important to me. Like

641
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:00,539
I can go back to levels and see them

642
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:02,220
sort of with fresh eyes sometimes,

643
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,540
but for the most part,

644
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,821
like when just the act of sitting down

645
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:07,201
and watching someone else play the game

646
00:28:07,661 --> 00:28:08,781
shifts something in my brain,

647
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:10,662
I just see it in a new light, like instantly.

648
00:28:11,242 --> 00:28:13,422
And then also obviously you just see them

649
00:28:14,003 --> 00:28:15,543
keep messing up on the same thing over and over.

650
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,605
On play testing, is all of your play testing in person

651
00:28:21,705 --> 00:28:24,685
or do you catch replays or analytics or death counts

652
00:28:25,025 --> 00:28:27,206
like with people that aren't actually in front of you?

653
00:28:27,552 --> 00:28:28,993
Yeah, it's all in person so far.

654
00:28:29,654 --> 00:28:32,356
It just seems so much, there's so much you miss

655
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:35,179
from just analytics, I think.

656
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,441
When you're in person, you can see,

657
00:28:38,262 --> 00:28:39,463
my favorite way to play Tessalest

658
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:41,725
is with a couch full of friends all,

659
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:43,406
it has their undivided attention,

660
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:45,088
and maybe they're trading off the controller,

661
00:28:45,108 --> 00:28:47,070
or maybe one of them's playing and they're talking,

662
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,412
but you can just overhear them talking about it

663
00:28:49,592 --> 00:28:51,374
and going through the mental process

664
00:28:51,574 --> 00:28:52,955
of see the gears turning in their head.

665
00:28:55,055 --> 00:29:02,200
Hey, it makes me think of your first game, Jumper Radix.

666
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,021
Like, it's been a long time you did it.

667
00:29:04,581 --> 00:29:06,582
And it's still the same themes, the same level.

668
00:29:06,722 --> 00:29:08,764
I mean, it seems very evolved.

669
00:29:08,904 --> 00:29:12,546
But is it a theme you plan on?

670
00:29:14,565 --> 00:29:20,691
changing? I mean, is it really something that counts for you? I have very poor vocabulary.

671
00:29:20,851 --> 00:29:23,193
So sorry, but like...

672
00:29:23,813 --> 00:29:25,795
What was the start of your question, sorry?

673
00:29:26,696 --> 00:29:31,920
Is it a theme that really is important for you? Like, the same as Jumper, Helix.

674
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,981
Oh, it's Jumper.

675
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:34,022
Yeah, Jumper.

676
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:38,806
Oh, yeah. Jumper was like the first game I made when I was a kid, and it was pretty similar

677
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:39,907
to this. So the question was...

678
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,941
is the theme important to me.

679
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:44,863
Yeah, that's it for you.

680
00:29:45,404 --> 00:29:48,626
Yeah, I mean, I grew up playing hard platformers

681
00:29:48,646 --> 00:29:50,387
like Donkey Kong Country, Mario 3.

682
00:29:50,808 --> 00:29:52,429
Those kind of games are really near and dear to me.

683
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:55,851
And yeah, I identify a lot with the genre.

684
00:29:57,532 --> 00:29:58,773
I do see this game as kind of like

685
00:29:59,073 --> 00:30:00,334
going back to my roots, I guess,

686
00:30:00,595 --> 00:30:02,936
before I go off and try something new after Towerfall.

687
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:15,869
Hello, at some point you talked about making the long levels replayable at the beginning

688
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:22,075
because if the player is going to die a lot of times, they will have to play a lot the

689
00:30:22,095 --> 00:30:22,535
first part.

690
00:30:23,076 --> 00:30:24,137
How do you do that?

691
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,018
Do you have like a...

692
00:30:26,855 --> 00:30:27,835
formula for that?

693
00:30:28,935 --> 00:30:30,355
I'm always looking for more ways to do that.

694
00:30:30,515 --> 00:30:32,576
One way is be aware of cycles.

695
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:34,376
Don't make the player wait at the start of the level,

696
00:30:34,436 --> 00:30:34,856
obviously.

697
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:37,917
Another thing is Celeste has collectibles.

698
00:30:37,977 --> 00:30:38,897
There's these strawberries.

699
00:30:39,457 --> 00:30:42,038
But in a lot of platformers, when you get a collectible,

700
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:43,638
you have to beat the level as well to keep it.

701
00:30:43,978 --> 00:30:45,179
That's not the case in Celeste.

702
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,219
So you can get permanent progress.

703
00:30:47,439 --> 00:30:49,520
So a lot of the longer levels have a lot of collectibles,

704
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,180
or more than normal, so that even though the level can

705
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,661
be a bit of a grind, you're still

706
00:30:54,701 --> 00:30:55,741
making this permanent progress.

707
00:30:56,636 --> 00:30:58,556
you know, so it's like a consolation prize.

708
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,217
And then also multiple approaches

709
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:02,357
is very important for that too.

710
00:31:03,317 --> 00:31:05,478
To have like the early parts of the level

711
00:31:05,538 --> 00:31:07,558
so that there's like an obvious way to do it,

712
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:09,319
but then there's like a faster way

713
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:10,999
that you can kind of discover

714
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,499
after you've done the level 50 times.

715
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:13,660
Yeah.

716
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,200
Thank you.

717
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:15,820
Yeah.

718
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:21,821
Okay.

719
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,242
Thanks everyone.
