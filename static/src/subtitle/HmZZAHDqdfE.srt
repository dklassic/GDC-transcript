00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:07,659
Hello and welcome to this session, Crush the Norm Diversity Rules.

2
00:00:08,499 --> 00:00:11,260
It's a session about diversity and inclusion in games.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,041
First of all, I hope you can turn off your mobile phones so we don't get disturbed.

4
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:20,822
We are from King in Stockholm, Sweden.

5
00:00:21,262 --> 00:00:25,423
My name is Kiki Olofsson and I am Senior Studio Art Director for Candy Crush.

6
00:00:26,043 --> 00:00:29,964
And I'm Kris Adolfsson and I'm a Brand Creative Studio Art Director.

7
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,829
Let's start with a quick check in.

8
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:38,950
What's your relation to this topic, diversity and inclusion?

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,571
I want you to show with your fingers one to five,

10
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:44,632
and the scale is one, I haven't really thought about it,

11
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:46,913
to five, I'm already very interested

12
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,033
and have some knowledge.

13
00:00:48,553 --> 00:00:49,694
So put your hands up now.

14
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:53,255
Ah, good.

15
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:55,776
We have a mixed audience and it will be easy

16
00:00:55,816 --> 00:00:58,096
for all of you to follow because the presentation

17
00:00:58,176 --> 00:00:59,157
is on a basic level.

18
00:00:59,177 --> 00:01:02,398
Okay, why do we have this session?

19
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:07,623
King is a company known for casual games with candies and cute characters.

20
00:01:08,063 --> 00:01:11,945
Even so, we've had our challenges when it comes to diversity and inclusion.

21
00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:17,027
We decided to do something about it, to educate and enlighten people

22
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:20,969
so they can reflect and make informed decisions

23
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:26,291
when creating or using game characters. We've been running this workshop at King

24
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:29,433
for a while, leading to games teams opening up their

25
00:01:29,573 --> 00:01:32,394
eyes for the subject. More concretely...

26
00:01:32,867 --> 00:01:36,169
creating less stereotypical characters,

27
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:38,010
like stronger female characters,

28
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,931
and broadening ethnic diversity.

29
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:43,613
In this presentation, we'll look at examples

30
00:01:43,693 --> 00:01:47,235
from popular culture, both positive ones and pitfalls.

31
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:50,257
We'll also get personal and look at mistakes

32
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:51,718
that King has made in the past.

33
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:56,640
We'll develop a test, which is used to test

34
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,662
how diverse a game is, and you will get to try it out later.

35
00:02:00,682 --> 00:02:01,223
That's the.

36
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:03,526
the screens on the walls.

37
00:02:04,947 --> 00:02:06,949
So what do we want to achieve with this session?

38
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,192
The goal is to empower you to make important decisions.

39
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:12,534
And it's not about setting limitations.

40
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,696
It's about creating new possibilities.

41
00:02:15,316 --> 00:02:18,119
And most important of all, this gives you the opportunity

42
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,060
to be leaders and not followers.

43
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:23,624
And if everyone in this room starts thinking about this

44
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:25,926
today, imagine what we can achieve together

45
00:02:25,986 --> 00:02:26,846
in less than a year.

46
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,869
Let's design games for everyone.

47
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:32,297
no matter where they are or who they are.

48
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:35,378
If you want a diverse player base from all over the world,

49
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:38,660
you will need to think big and crush the norm,

50
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,961
because everything we do adds to the world we live in

51
00:02:42,302 --> 00:02:43,402
and the world we play in.

52
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:47,104
So why replicate when we can work against stereotypes?

53
00:02:48,524 --> 00:02:51,606
A great saga needs all kinds of heroes, and that's it.

54
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:54,567
So what is diversity?

55
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:56,908
It can apply to many different areas,

56
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:59,930
like age, body type.

57
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:07,715
culture, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation,

58
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:13,678
socio-economic background or class if you will, mental health and religion.

59
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:22,304
And diversity is closely connected to equality, feminism, anti-racism, accessibility,

60
00:03:22,564 --> 00:03:26,727
intersectional analysis and human rights. All good things, aren't they?

61
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,817
And if we want a greater diversity, inclusion is the way to go.

62
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,560
An exclusion is the opposite to inclusion.

63
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,302
And if you take it to the extreme, exclusion is discrimination,

64
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:44,144
as some groups that don't fall within the norm are repeatedly rejected.

65
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:48,547
And that's how the norm is maintained and reinforced time and time again.

66
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:54,190
And the yellow and the green dots on the outside of the big circle represents those who are excluded.

67
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:57,637
And let's take a look at inclusion instead.

68
00:03:57,897 --> 00:04:00,979
Hold on, because this is an advanced PowerPoint animation.

69
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:01,940
I made it myself.

70
00:04:05,062 --> 00:04:06,603
So, see what happened there.

71
00:04:06,683 --> 00:04:09,025
The circle was expanded to get a better mix,

72
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:12,147
room for more variation and to be more inclusive.

73
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:14,568
And of course, inclusion doesn't mean

74
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:17,870
that just everyone needs to be represented at all time.

75
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:21,549
especially not in a game with just a few characters.

76
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,112
It's more about having a greater variety and a more true representation.

77
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:30,674
We get more types of characters that our players can identify with and get to know.

78
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:32,795
And in the end, that's just more fun.

79
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,637
Where do we begin?

80
00:04:35,657 --> 00:04:40,640
Our output reaches millions of players of all sorts, and we have a unique chance

81
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,301
to make a difference by showing a diverse world in our games.

82
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:45,562
So...

83
00:04:46,221 --> 00:04:48,963
To do so, we need to make conscious decisions.

84
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:51,685
So let's explore a character universe

85
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:53,306
with a wide range of options.

86
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,188
And before continuing, I want to make clear

87
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:57,749
that the pictures we will show,

88
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:00,851
it's chosen because they are understandable examples.

89
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:04,233
It doesn't mean that all characters in that game or film

90
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:06,635
are good or bad from a diverse perspective.

91
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:12,419
You need to investigate your own assumptions and presets,

92
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,101
who you are and how that affects the work you do.

93
00:05:15,907 --> 00:05:20,088
It doesn't necessarily need to be your own culture that affects what you do.

94
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:24,109
It's also about the mainstream culture that we're constantly fed with.

95
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,591
For instance, do you use a white man as a foundation when you create a new character?

96
00:05:32,372 --> 00:05:35,812
And do all women have the same body type, slim and curvy?

97
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,293
And yes, let's investigate.

98
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:44,315
Have you by any chance only created characters of the same cultural background as you?

99
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,991
So remember to always question all stereotypes.

100
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:54,014
Ethnicity, this is an interesting and embarrassing example

101
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:56,055
because this is actually from a King game

102
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:59,717
called African Rainmaker, released six years ago.

103
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:03,359
And it's a typical example of an African stereotype.

104
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:05,280
And does the personality and looks

105
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,221
go beyond ethnicity cliches?

106
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:08,382
No, they don't.

107
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:10,263
And that's what we call typecast.

108
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:12,784
And don't worry because we've taken this game down.

109
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,585
Age.

110
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:19,172
Some people might think that you can solve the age spread by adding an old evil witch.

111
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,553
Well, it doesn't really work like that.

112
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:28,778
And when it comes to gender, a female character needs more personality than just being a woman.

113
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:34,621
If you strip back the gender traits and looks, is there anything left more than a blank canvas?

114
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:39,725
If not, you need to go back to the drawing board, and the Smurfs really should.

115
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:44,458
disability, an evil pirate with a wooden leg.

116
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:46,318
We've seen that before, haven't we?

117
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,360
Think bigger, because people with disabilities

118
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,520
can be heroes too.

119
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:55,202
And when it comes to sexuality and romantic motivation,

120
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:58,323
Mario saves the princess over and over again,

121
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,484
but maybe we don't have to limit us to that.

122
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:03,705
What if a girl can save a girl or a boy can save a boy?

123
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:09,347
There are so many things to build an original character with,

124
00:07:09,547 --> 00:07:10,908
so let's explore the toolbox.

125
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,326
No one ever successfully fought a war in a bikini,

126
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:17,867
and really, clothing that calls attention

127
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:19,648
and sexualize the female body

128
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,569
is not necessary for most narratives.

129
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:25,150
On the other hand, have you dressed all male characters

130
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,371
in all covering cool and tacky wear,

131
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:30,052
functional clothes, and heavy armor?

132
00:07:30,912 --> 00:07:33,133
Don't get stuck in old rats, you have to mix it up.

133
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:36,794
A good rule of thumb is to compare

134
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:38,975
the clothing between genders

135
00:07:39,135 --> 00:07:41,636
to unlock stereotypical representations.

136
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,360
This is a positive example from Assassin's Creed Syndicate.

137
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,481
The male and female twin assassins

138
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,041
have same kind of clothes, armor, and weapons.

139
00:07:53,422 --> 00:07:55,163
Are all males dark and brooding

140
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:57,683
and all females happy and colorful?

141
00:07:59,364 --> 00:08:02,025
Sure, you can use blue for boys and pink for girls,

142
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:04,145
but there are endless possibilities

143
00:08:04,205 --> 00:08:06,146
for color schemes that can be used.

144
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,706
And if you go for a cliche,

145
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:09,187
you could at least play around with it.

146
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:13,210
This is a great example from the film Inside Out.

147
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:17,573
And look beyond the usual suspects.

148
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:19,173
Fat doesn't mean lazy,

149
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:21,895
and smart doesn't need to wear glasses,

150
00:08:22,155 --> 00:08:23,996
and someone that looks like Prince Charming

151
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:25,557
isn't always the good guy.

152
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:30,679
This is Faith, a plus-size superhero we all can admire

153
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,301
because she has tremendous psychic powers.

154
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:39,370
A diverse game world includes short, tall, chubby, skinny,

155
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,655
curvy, athletic, disabled or non-disabled,

156
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,618
and characters of different ethnicity.

157
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,243
Professor Xavier from X-Men is using a wheelchair,

158
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,085
but this has never held him back.

159
00:08:53,786 --> 00:08:56,790
He's one of the most powerful mutants in the world.

160
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,169
And watch out for those archetypes.

161
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:02,769
They're great at telling stories,

162
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,211
but they might take you down a beaten path,

163
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:08,772
something that the player has already seen before.

164
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:11,974
The healer doesn't always have to be an older woman.

165
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:14,715
The hero can be someone else than a white male,

166
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,696
and the savage can be European.

167
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:19,957
And remember the supportive characters in the background.

168
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,751
I don't know if you have seen Game of Thrones.

169
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:29,233
I don't want to spoil anything, but they really have an interesting and often very surprising

170
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:30,294
mix of characters.

171
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:34,195
There are some principles to guide you.

172
00:09:35,596 --> 00:09:39,577
Decide the character personality traits and narrative first.

173
00:09:40,297 --> 00:09:42,798
Which story do you want to tell and with which characters?

174
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:48,321
After this, you can decide the gender, ethnicity, body type, and culture.

175
00:09:49,494 --> 00:09:55,797
And always aim to let the body, look and poses of the character reflect the personality and narrative.

176
00:09:57,078 --> 00:09:59,279
Aim for a well-balanced group of characters.

177
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:06,203
And last but not least, always ask yourself, did I recreate the stereotype and if so, why?

178
00:10:07,404 --> 00:10:12,906
And remember, with an original character, it's easier to create a strong and recognizable brand.

179
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:19,933
So we've developed a test to see how inclusive and diverse a game is, and it's called Diversity Space.

180
00:10:20,694 --> 00:10:23,215
And this is how the test looks like. Exciting, hey?

181
00:10:24,076 --> 00:10:29,860
So you start by identifying the norm, and here we use the norm for action games developed in the Western world.

182
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,943
The same norms are almost always applicable for productions aimed for the Western market.

183
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:42,228
So the culture is Western, ethnicity is Caucasian, age is like neither young or old,

184
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,429
women are usually younger than men.

185
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:50,606
Ability is non-disabled, sexual orientation is heterosexual,

186
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:53,127
and body type is stereotypical,

187
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:55,268
and that is slim and curvy for women,

188
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,030
and athletic or body-builder types for men.

189
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,272
And gender identity, male is the norm,

190
00:11:01,472 --> 00:11:04,553
women come second, and all others are very, very uncommon.

191
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:07,295
So the norm is the green area here,

192
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:09,936
so that's a really, really tiny diversity space.

193
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:13,078
And now we're going to test some characters

194
00:11:13,138 --> 00:11:15,019
from the game Overwatch from Blizzard.

195
00:11:15,895 --> 00:11:18,377
And this is Sarja, she is an unusual character.

196
00:11:18,897 --> 00:11:21,178
Her design actually emerged from a demand

197
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:23,620
from players to Blizzard for a greater diversity

198
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,021
of gender, body type, and ethnicity.

199
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:28,482
And let's take a look at her diversity space.

200
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:31,624
Culture, she is Russian, so that's not very common.

201
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:35,606
Ethnicity, she's Caucasian, so she's on the norm.

202
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,988
Age, she's 28, so neither young or old.

203
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:42,950
Nobility, she is non-disabled, so she's on the norm there.

204
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:46,446
Sexuality, you can't see this on the outside,

205
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:48,427
and there is no information on this,

206
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,368
but she does have some queer vibes,

207
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:53,030
and there's been some rumors in the community,

208
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,791
but we need to put her on the norm.

209
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:58,493
And body type, she is a bodybuilder,

210
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,675
and all those muscles are unusual for female characters,

211
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:03,837
so let's put that quite a bit from the norm.

212
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:05,918
And gender, she is a woman,

213
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:08,119
so she is in the middle of the gender scale.

214
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,342
All in all, she's got quite big diversity break.

215
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:16,788
diversity space, breaking the norm with gender, culture, and body type.

216
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,490
And this is Lucio.

217
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:24,753
Starting up with culture, he is a DJ living in Brazil, so he is a little bit out from

218
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:25,174
the norm.

219
00:12:25,794 --> 00:12:28,576
Ethnicity, he is black, so I'll put this quite far out.

220
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:30,057
It's not that common.

221
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:32,799
And it's not the scale from white to black.

222
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:37,822
But Caucasian people are most common, and Asians are more common than, let's say, Indians.

223
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:41,605
Age, he's 26, so that doesn't stand out from the norm.

224
00:12:42,926 --> 00:12:45,808
Ability, he is non-disabled, so he's on the norm.

225
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:49,350
Sexual orientation, don't know anything about that,

226
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,591
so I'll keep him on the norm.

227
00:12:51,232 --> 00:12:54,194
And body type, he is athletic, and that's expected of men.

228
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:58,537
And gender identity, he is a man, which is the most common.

229
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:01,198
So looking at the diversity space,

230
00:13:01,318 --> 00:13:03,440
he has got a sharp point towards ethnicity,

231
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,301
and a little stretch in culture,

232
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:07,302
but he doesn't stand out from the norm much

233
00:13:07,342 --> 00:13:08,203
in any other ways.

234
00:13:09,644 --> 00:13:10,785
And then we've got Torbjörn.

235
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:12,486
He is a Swedish weapon designer.

236
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:18,460
That's not super common, but it doesn't stand out from a culture point of view, so I'll put him close to the norm.

237
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,161
And he's white, so nothing on ethnicity.

238
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:24,442
He is 57, so he is older than the most.

239
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:30,584
He is disabled and has got a prosthetic arm, so we'll put this quite far out on the ability scale.

240
00:13:31,164 --> 00:13:34,765
We don't know anything about his sexuality, so I keep it close to the norm.

241
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:38,147
And body type, he is a person with short stature.

242
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:40,201
So that's a bit out from the norm.

243
00:13:40,401 --> 00:13:43,742
However, it's not that uncommon with a body type like that

244
00:13:43,802 --> 00:13:45,622
together with a lot of muscles in games.

245
00:13:46,683 --> 00:13:48,703
And he is a man, which is most common.

246
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:51,684
Looking at the diversity space,

247
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:53,444
he does stand out a bit from the norm.

248
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:56,005
This is when it gets interesting,

249
00:13:56,405 --> 00:13:59,345
because by combining the characters in the diversity space,

250
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:02,166
you get an overall picture of your game's inclusion level.

251
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,231
So for this being only three characters,

252
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,853
we got quite a good spread in the diversity space.

253
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:11,414
So good job, Blizzard.

254
00:14:12,014 --> 00:14:14,476
And remember that the whole diversity space

255
00:14:14,516 --> 00:14:15,776
doesn't need to be covered.

256
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:19,899
Just avoid having all characters huddle up in the middle.

257
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,501
And do you think this could be a useful tool?

258
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:23,461
Hands up if you do.

259
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:27,304
That's super, because you're going to test this out soon.

260
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:28,465
But first, over to Kiki.

261
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,182
And remember, even if you have developed characters

262
00:14:34,222 --> 00:14:38,505
with a big diversity space, you can still have stereotypes.

263
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:40,586
Would you say that these characters

264
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:42,207
are stereotypes in any ways?

265
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,628
Hands up if yes.

266
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:51,013
So, let's take a look at some pitfalls

267
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:52,213
to keep you on the right track.

268
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:58,685
The angry and brutish black man is one of the most common stereotypes in games.

269
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,586
Let's do something more original.

270
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:06,407
And the representation of women in games are often embarrassingly uniform.

271
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:08,748
These are the female characters from Tekken 6.

272
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:13,769
All of them have very stereotypical body types and clothing that emphasize that.

273
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:18,085
And we are doing something similar in our King games.

274
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:19,566
This is from Shuffle Cats.

275
00:15:20,347 --> 00:15:22,028
All those Jazza cats looks awesome.

276
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:24,510
But don't they look a little similar?

277
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,572
So let's compare them with the Tomcats.

278
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,854
And the Tomcats are allowed to have

279
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:32,756
a lot of different body types, expressions, et cetera,

280
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:36,059
which is usually the case with male characters.

281
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,201
So let's compare again.

282
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,865
It's quite obvious, isn't it?

283
00:15:45,557 --> 00:15:47,738
And we have whiteness, that's clearly a default

284
00:15:47,798 --> 00:15:49,839
in a lot of games, the Witcher is one of them.

285
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,301
And sexualizing poses is another pitfall.

286
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:57,943
Make sure that the character's body, look, poses, et cetera

287
00:15:58,143 --> 00:16:01,425
reflect the character personality traits and narrative.

288
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:03,886
This is an example from Overwatch

289
00:16:04,307 --> 00:16:05,487
that you might have seen before.

290
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:08,169
It's made quite a buzz as the pose

291
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:10,630
doesn't go along with her personality.

292
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,051
So be mindful of what you're doing

293
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:14,812
and watch out for those stereotypes.

294
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:18,910
And let's end on a more positive note.

295
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,512
There are games which stay clear from pitfalls

296
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:24,532
and challenge norms.

297
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:28,334
This is an example from Journey, who

298
00:16:28,414 --> 00:16:30,596
have created a game with a character

299
00:16:30,776 --> 00:16:32,637
without a clearly stated gender.

300
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:36,018
They have been thinking big, and they have crushed the norm.

301
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:39,580
Some other positive example, this

302
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,501
is Faith Connors in Mirror's Edge.

303
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:45,543
She is a powerful Asian woman and has the leading role.

304
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,292
Watch Dogs 2, which takes place here in San Francisco.

305
00:16:51,072 --> 00:16:53,913
They have been working actively with the representation

306
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:57,615
of diverse ethnicity and touch upon subjects like autism.

307
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,097
And we have the upcoming game, Last of Us Part 2,

308
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:06,259
with the story that includes LGBT characters.

309
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,581
So now we're going to do the workshop.

310
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,375
you are going to take a closer look

311
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:15,957
by trying out the diversity space method,

312
00:17:16,658 --> 00:17:17,859
and we will look at four games.

313
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:21,062
Clash of Clans from Supercell,

314
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,366
Call of Duty Infinite Warfare

315
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,388
from Infinity Warden Activision,

316
00:17:27,889 --> 00:17:29,551
Super Mario Run from Nintendo,

317
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:33,875
and The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess from Nintendo.

318
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:35,537
So.

319
00:17:36,215 --> 00:17:42,340
To make it easy for you, we have decided that the norm is the same norm we were talking about earlier, the Western market.

320
00:17:43,141 --> 00:17:49,465
So we want you to look at the characters and discuss and draw the diversity space sections for each character,

321
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:51,747
and you use one color per character.

322
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:55,890
And you have the workshop material towards the walls,

323
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:04,996
so if you just go to the flip charts and team up with like four people or so in each team and you start the exercise.

324
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:09,268
and then one group from each game will present the results.

325
00:18:20,278 --> 00:18:25,743
I think it went quite well, we thought it could be super unorganized, but I think you

326
00:18:26,784 --> 00:18:27,765
got something out of it.

327
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:30,087
It was a bit chaotic.

328
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:33,650
First we're going to look at Clash of Clans.

329
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,334
So we have a team that has accepted to present their results.

330
00:18:47,654 --> 00:18:50,316
We have asked the team, yeah.

331
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:56,402
You can come up here if you like.

332
00:18:57,864 --> 00:19:00,586
Maybe you should, where is your chart?

333
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:01,967
Oh, do you want me to bring it up?

334
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:02,508
Yeah, maybe.

335
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:02,948
That's good.

336
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:06,872
It will be a bit difficult to see, but you get at least...

337
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:08,734
Sorry.

338
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,203
You find it easy to do the exercise?

339
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,805
Was it a lot of discussions in the groups?

340
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:21,066
It was good.

341
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:21,867
It was good.

342
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:26,250
And there are no correct answers.

343
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:29,053
We are all different, and we assess differently.

344
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:46,512
So, we did Clash of Clans, and what we talked about is that the game is kind of pretty normative.

345
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:55,275
The only characters that really seem to diverge are the first character, just in terms of...

346
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:00,549
gender identity, well not gender identity, sorry,

347
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:02,550
incorrect one, culture and ethnicity,

348
00:20:03,171 --> 00:20:04,552
and then everything else is pretty normative,

349
00:20:05,012 --> 00:20:06,753
even coming down to the body type,

350
00:20:06,813 --> 00:20:09,135
kind of like we all discussed with male characters

351
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:11,316
in that they tend to have a variety of physiques,

352
00:20:12,157 --> 00:20:14,739
and kind of general buff physique here.

353
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:18,541
And then with the two female characters, two and four,

354
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:21,023
kind of almost the same exact body type,

355
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,185
generally a more narrow waist.

356
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:27,716
but same sort of chest, shoulders, figure,

357
00:20:28,116 --> 00:20:29,157
normally what you would expect

358
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:31,058
in a lot of female character designs.

359
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,680
All of them were able-bodied,

360
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:41,183
and then the only other thing that stood out

361
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:44,345
in terms of variety was that there were two

362
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:46,466
female characters, and that was pretty much

363
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:47,466
the only point that we gave it

364
00:20:47,526 --> 00:20:49,567
for the variety of five characters.

365
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,040
And the other teams who were looking at Clash of Clans,

366
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,441
did you have similar results or you thought differently?

367
00:20:57,461 --> 00:20:58,821
About the same?

368
00:20:58,881 --> 00:20:58,961
OK.

369
00:20:58,981 --> 00:20:59,181
Thank you.

370
00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:00,262
Thank you.

371
00:21:00,282 --> 00:21:02,442
I think this serves for a round of applause.

372
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:02,603
Yes.

373
00:21:02,643 --> 00:21:03,083
Thank you.

374
00:21:03,123 --> 00:21:03,303
Thank you.

375
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:03,523
Thank you.

376
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:03,963
Thank you.

377
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,064
Thank you.

378
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:06,664
Thank you.

379
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:07,384
Thank you.

380
00:21:08,004 --> 00:21:09,785
Thank you.

381
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:14,686
Thank you.

382
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,086
Thank you.

383
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:19,588
And then we had, sorry, I'm just messing up the.

384
00:21:22,305 --> 00:21:24,227
Yeah, Super Mario, would you like to come up?

385
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:58,573
Hi, so we discussed Super Mario Run and we found that the game had some points in some

386
00:21:58,673 --> 00:22:00,393
areas but completely lacked in others.

387
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:07,816
So where the game lacked is in ability since they're all non-disabled and in sexual orientation

388
00:22:07,856 --> 00:22:10,756
as well since they are all presumably straight.

389
00:22:12,688 --> 00:22:15,970
Where the game was a bit more diverse is in gender identity.

390
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:19,253
Two of the characters are female, which is, well, you know,

391
00:22:20,454 --> 00:22:23,115
a little bit outside of the norm.

392
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:27,038
When it comes to culture, Mario and Luigi are both Italian,

393
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,660
which is still like Western,

394
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,463
but it's not the most represented type, we presume.

395
00:22:34,564 --> 00:22:38,546
So we put them just a little bit on the, like out there.

396
00:22:39,846 --> 00:22:49,413
And age as well, we, like Mario, Peach and Luigi are all sort of not neither young or old,

397
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:56,718
but both Toad and Toadette are children, so that is, you know, just a bit outside of the norm, I believe, we put them.

398
00:22:57,798 --> 00:22:59,039
And then we have...

399
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,446
body types as well.

400
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:05,507
So what we noted here is that Mario is short,

401
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:07,687
like he's actually shorter than Peach.

402
00:23:08,128 --> 00:23:09,708
So we gave him quite a high score for that.

403
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,769
And also that the characters are,

404
00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:15,590
they're not necessarily very muscular,

405
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:20,231
they're more like, you know, rounded.

406
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:24,452
So yeah, we gave it quite high points for that.

407
00:23:24,972 --> 00:23:26,293
Even though we didn't give it like,

408
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:31,223
Very high marks because we said that this still like,

409
00:23:31,263 --> 00:23:34,905
the art style of the game still is rounded as well.

410
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:38,707
So even though it's not like super muscular,

411
00:23:38,747 --> 00:23:41,248
it's still not far out from the norm of the game.

412
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:44,170
Like it's still pretty normative in that context.

413
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,251
So we give it like, yeah,

414
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:49,513
pretty high marks for body type.

415
00:23:50,253 --> 00:23:52,614
But yeah, and also in ethnicity,

416
00:23:52,674 --> 00:23:54,115
none of them differ from the norm

417
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:56,777
since they're all white and Caucasian, so yeah.

418
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,291
So that was our results.

419
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:00,792
Great, thank you.

420
00:24:00,812 --> 00:24:01,232
Awesome.

421
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:10,115
And then we have a team looking at Legend of Zelda.

422
00:24:20,638 --> 00:24:25,760
Cool, so our team looked at Twilight Princess

423
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,880
and the Legend of Zelda.

424
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:31,647
And there was a bit more variety here maybe than the previous teams.

425
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:33,708
We kind of...

426
00:24:35,428 --> 00:24:39,650
So, Zelda and Link are very kind of traditional,

427
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,792
fit into the norm even like despite the maybe kind of mythological influences of the game,

428
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:51,334
but especially Link is very, you know, western, kind of feudal-ware.

429
00:24:52,475 --> 00:24:57,157
And they're both very traditional body types and seemingly sexual orientation.

430
00:24:57,687 --> 00:24:59,508
as well, and ability of course.

431
00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:07,073
Ganondorf, we kind of gave a midway in culture,

432
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:10,395
and kind of high in ethnicity, because I mean,

433
00:25:11,155 --> 00:25:13,537
he's definitely not traditionally Western.

434
00:25:14,438 --> 00:25:17,500
I guess the game, he's almost like a feudal Japanese.

435
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:22,463
Interesting, you know, I don't really know what.

436
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:33,522
What? So that's great. Adds diversity. Age, he's in the don't really know stage. He's still in the

437
00:25:33,562 --> 00:25:38,665
prime of his life, at least for a male character, so we kind of rated it a bit off the norm,

438
00:25:38,685 --> 00:25:47,230
but mostly very, very tightly there. I guess it's midna. It's midna, right? Yeah, okay.

439
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:55,341
Yeah, great. She's kind of like an interesting one and kind of, you know, enlarged the sphere

440
00:25:55,361 --> 00:26:01,145
a lot, I guess, because as somebody pointed out, she's, you know, she only has sight in one eye,

441
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:09,492
which is interesting. Her body type is quite different, even though somebody pointed out

442
00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:14,175
that within the context of her, kind of, she still has some feminine traits, even though it's,

443
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:18,822
But yeah, no, no, she was definitely the most

444
00:26:18,862 --> 00:26:21,003
kind of diverse character and added a lot to the sphere

445
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:24,546
which was very narrow just after Link and Zelda.

446
00:26:25,146 --> 00:26:26,647
So yeah, that was our findings.

447
00:26:27,187 --> 00:26:27,727
Thank you.

448
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:28,588
Thank you.

449
00:26:28,648 --> 00:26:33,391
Thank you so much for your motion.

450
00:26:33,871 --> 00:26:36,353
And then we have the Call of Duty team.

451
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:45,186
We had the same session for Activision Blizzard yesterday.

452
00:26:45,206 --> 00:26:48,348
We had a studio summit, so that was very interesting.

453
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,192
Yeah.

454
00:26:56,113 --> 00:26:58,574
So we were looking at a Call of Duty game

455
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:02,556
and we found that two out of the five of the characters

456
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:04,938
are really normative, they were exactly on the bubble.

457
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:06,879
So four and one were on there.

458
00:27:07,899 --> 00:27:12,966
We also had one female character, which was, it took the gender identity out a little bit.

459
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:17,512
And then a black character, which took out the ethnicity.

460
00:27:18,113 --> 00:27:21,157
And then we said that having the robot on the team actually expanded the sphere a lot

461
00:27:21,198 --> 00:27:23,941
because the culture was unknown and ethnicity was unknown.

462
00:27:24,217 --> 00:27:25,818
Yeah, actually having the robot on the team

463
00:27:26,418 --> 00:27:28,399
posed probably our most difficult decisions

464
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:29,640
for determining what to put on this

465
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,261
because there was debate,

466
00:27:31,281 --> 00:27:33,142
because not all of us are actually that familiar

467
00:27:33,162 --> 00:27:34,603
with this particular Call of Duty game.

468
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:37,484
So there was uncertainty as to whether or not

469
00:27:37,544 --> 00:27:39,425
it was an emphasis on robotic prosthetics

470
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,907
or just the use of a robot character on the team.

471
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,468
But it does stand out in terms of.

472
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:49,583
ethnicity and I guess gender identity because it's sort of abstract and out

473
00:27:49,623 --> 00:27:54,127
there. Does it have a gender? We looked at it and more or less if you take that

474
00:27:54,187 --> 00:27:59,691
head off the body there it still fit into a very muscular male archetype in

475
00:27:59,731 --> 00:28:06,336
terms of its body design. Sexual orientation could be asexual, not too

476
00:28:06,396 --> 00:28:12,361
sure exactly with that, but otherwise for the most part very boring group of

477
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:13,842
people aside from Mr. Robot there.

478
00:28:15,844 --> 00:28:19,906
I was actually a little disappointed because when I was standing further away from our smaller picture,

479
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:24,889
I thought number one was a Latino female and I was like, that's not as bad of a spectrum.

480
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:27,810
And then I got closer and it's exactly the same as number four and

481
00:28:28,231 --> 00:28:34,554
completely diminished the diversity of gender pools and cultural identifications.

482
00:28:35,466 --> 00:28:37,588
I mean, the one thing I'll say in defense for this game is

483
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:40,390
just considering the context of the play, at least for body

484
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:45,414
types, is simply the fact that it is a military-oriented

485
00:28:45,454 --> 00:28:47,956
game, so you do need to have athletic people and people

486
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,698
that are fit for service out in the field.

487
00:28:49,738 --> 00:28:53,160
So I mean, they don't really have much leeway there for

488
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,361
that.

489
00:28:53,381 --> 00:28:54,942
So I'd actually challenge that.

490
00:28:54,962 --> 00:28:55,142
OK, cool.

491
00:28:55,382 --> 00:28:58,905
They participate in sporting and military within operations

492
00:28:59,426 --> 00:29:01,047
that have all body types.

493
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:05,761
Sounds cool.

494
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:09,084
Good input though.

495
00:29:09,104 --> 00:29:12,227
I guess my only, I guess I was kind of sad,

496
00:29:12,487 --> 00:29:14,348
well the fact that we haven't played the game

497
00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:17,051
actually made it give us some hope

498
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:20,133
that there was something different about those characters

499
00:29:20,213 --> 00:29:21,454
like the sexual orientation.

500
00:29:21,474 --> 00:29:24,457
So we were kind of putting dotted lines there

501
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:27,899
and hoping that the game designers

502
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,060
actually made the right choices

503
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,702
to make that game do it diverse.

504
00:29:30,762 --> 00:29:32,703
But if they didn't, then it would be very sad.

505
00:29:34,837 --> 00:29:35,237
Thank you.

506
00:29:35,297 --> 00:29:35,517
Thank you.

507
00:29:35,577 --> 00:29:42,506
Thank you.

508
00:29:42,526 --> 00:29:45,990
I also want to mention another initiative from King.

509
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:49,094
We are partnering for the second time with Diversity.

510
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:56,037
to sponsor a scholarship program for 10 European female talented students to come over here to GDC.

511
00:29:56,678 --> 00:30:02,184
And this initiative gives them an awesome opportunity to network and attend exciting sessions

512
00:30:02,485 --> 00:30:04,988
and further on hopefully a career in the gaming industry.

513
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:07,571
They are sitting here in front.

514
00:30:16,395 --> 00:30:19,378
I hope you reach out to them afterwards and maybe give them

515
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,580
your best tips and tricks or other opportunities.

516
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:23,241
Thank you.

517
00:30:25,302 --> 00:30:28,185
So did you find the content in this session meaningful?

518
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:30,146
You liked it?

519
00:30:31,828 --> 00:30:33,289
And did you get any new insights?

520
00:30:36,531 --> 00:30:38,093
And do you think it will be useful for you

521
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:44,558
to look more into how diverse and inclusive your games are?

522
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,243
good, that was what we wanted it to become.

523
00:30:54,245 --> 00:30:58,967
So we have some time left, and if you have some questions,

524
00:30:59,147 --> 00:31:00,288
we will try to answer them.

525
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:03,249
I think we have a microphone in the...

526
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,932
Test, test, okay.

527
00:31:08,953 --> 00:31:10,433
Hi, I just wanted to know how long

528
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:11,794
you've been focusing on this in King?

529
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:15,733
Like, is this a new initiative you've been doing?

530
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:18,194
Or how long have you actually had a focus on this

531
00:31:18,254 --> 00:31:19,794
and your games, have you been looking into this

532
00:31:19,894 --> 00:31:21,755
from the design states and all that until you,

533
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:24,175
you said you mentioned you had some games

534
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,036
that weren't very diverse and you kind of killed those off,

535
00:31:26,116 --> 00:31:27,856
but I mean, when did you start this process?

536
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:31,197
In fact, we started, it was one and a half year ago.

537
00:31:31,217 --> 00:31:35,298
When we invited Anita Sarkisian to a King for Market,

538
00:31:35,338 --> 00:31:37,238
that's like a conference we have for whole King.

539
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:44,249
I really liked her talk and started to think that is there something we can do in our games?

540
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:51,892
Usually the King games are not very character driven. It's more about candies or vegetables or something else

541
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:59,875
But we are going more towards games with characters. So we felt that why not like start before it's too late

542
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,242
And we have been out in all studios so far,

543
00:32:06,362 --> 00:32:08,163
and we have had a session for them.

544
00:32:08,783 --> 00:32:13,826
So we're really trying to go towards the right direction.

545
00:32:13,846 --> 00:32:16,547
But as you could see, sometimes we fail anyway.

546
00:32:17,307 --> 00:32:19,608
But that's at least our plan.

547
00:32:19,668 --> 00:32:21,549
And we haven't, this is not our,

548
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:23,290
this is something we have done ourselves,

549
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,291
like on the side, because we just felt

550
00:32:25,351 --> 00:32:27,111
it was a very important topic.

551
00:32:27,271 --> 00:32:28,952
Yeah.

552
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,304
Any more questions?

553
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:39,344
Hello.

554
00:32:40,646 --> 00:32:41,126
Hello again.

555
00:32:41,907 --> 00:32:43,288
I don't really like taking up a space

556
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,791
in these kinds of things, but I just wanted to say,

557
00:32:45,811 --> 00:32:47,552
I think the tool is really cool.

558
00:32:48,513 --> 00:32:50,255
One of the things I noticed though is that

559
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:53,238
there's so much difference in how people interpret it,

560
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,640
and there's so much complication in terms of

561
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,263
whether you take in the context of the game or not.

562
00:32:59,284 --> 00:33:00,745
And I think that that makes a really big difference

563
00:33:00,785 --> 00:33:01,746
in how we look at.

564
00:33:02,795 --> 00:33:05,018
doing this in different communities and what tools they have.

565
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:10,443
I don't have a question, sorry, just kind of like feedback a little bit for folks in

566
00:33:10,463 --> 00:33:14,546
the room who might want to use it, I guess, in terms of, like I'm really happy that you

567
00:33:14,586 --> 00:33:16,708
mentioned the context is also important.

568
00:33:16,768 --> 00:33:19,911
So we were doing Peach and we're like, well, she's a damsel.

569
00:33:20,552 --> 00:33:24,593
And so do we want to give gender points for the fact that she's a damsel and she's stereotypical?

570
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:32,277
And so I kind of think of this a little bit like the Bechdel test, which is the test to assess whether a film has...

571
00:33:32,297 --> 00:33:35,298
Oh my god, this is a thing I know really well.

572
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:39,260
If two female characters can talk about anything else than a man.

573
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:47,708
Which is a super great starting point for folks to understand that and I think that this tool plays that same kind of role which is a great starting point to get teams talking about it.

574
00:33:48,689 --> 00:33:55,915
But then layering on the pieces of like who is the character like you were saying and I'm wondering if there's a way to integrate that.

575
00:33:56,636 --> 00:33:58,898
which is not an answer now thing.

576
00:33:59,478 --> 00:34:03,641
It's a really good input, and I think that the diversity space is a tool

577
00:34:03,661 --> 00:34:08,025
that is mostly to be used by game developers and narrative and game artists,

578
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:10,546
so they are aware of what they are doing.

579
00:34:11,607 --> 00:34:16,631
But as we mentioned, you can still have a really big diversity space,

580
00:34:16,991 --> 00:34:18,993
but all the characters are stereotypes,

581
00:34:19,473 --> 00:34:21,855
so you would need to check that as well.

582
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:23,756
Yeah, absolutely. But I think this is awesome. Thank you.

583
00:34:24,277 --> 00:34:24,597
Thank you.

584
00:34:33,061 --> 00:34:33,841
Any more questions?

585
00:34:40,506 --> 00:34:43,388
So I would like to know your opinion on

586
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:47,570
what someone might think about

587
00:34:48,431 --> 00:34:52,894
in regards to people's reactions to your diverse cast

588
00:34:52,914 --> 00:34:54,575
that you create in video games or in whatever,

589
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:59,658
so that you're not just filling in a checkbox kind of thing.

590
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:00,199
Because...

591
00:35:02,028 --> 00:35:04,289
while that's not necessarily what you're doing,

592
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:05,890
it might be what it appears to be.

593
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,371
And so I'm wondering with,

594
00:35:08,011 --> 00:35:09,272
as long as it makes sense in the story,

595
00:35:09,312 --> 00:35:13,133
should you just go for as much diversity as you feel like?

596
00:35:14,274 --> 00:35:16,295
Or do you want to kind of watch

597
00:35:17,135 --> 00:35:18,336
to make sure that it's not just like,

598
00:35:18,356 --> 00:35:19,557
here's one of this type,

599
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,997
and here's one of this type kind of thing.

600
00:35:21,017 --> 00:35:22,918
Like, what would you say to that kind of an idea?

601
00:35:23,814 --> 00:35:26,916
It depends on how many characters you've got in a game, of course.

602
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:33,340
And it would be really strange if you ticked all the boxes in only one character to have it done with.

603
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,862
So it's more about getting a greater variety.

604
00:35:37,563 --> 00:35:41,645
And you don't need to do it in all characters all the time.

605
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:46,628
But just if you recreate the stereotype, you should be aware of why you're doing it.

606
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,690
Does that answer your question?

607
00:35:51,843 --> 00:35:52,603
Yeah, that is.

608
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:54,745
OK, hi.

609
00:35:55,566 --> 00:35:57,527
So you mentioned that at King, you've

610
00:35:57,567 --> 00:35:58,828
all been thinking about this more

611
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,789
and trying to focus on this more.

612
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:03,472
I'm curious if you've generally gotten a lot of buy-in

613
00:36:03,492 --> 00:36:05,653
from everyone on the team about trying to pay more

614
00:36:05,673 --> 00:36:07,735
attention to this, trying to improve inclusion and diversity,

615
00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:09,757
or if you've gotten some pushback, some resistance,

616
00:36:09,797 --> 00:36:11,718
and if so, how you've dealt with that,

617
00:36:11,758 --> 00:36:13,980
how you've tried to bring those team members on board

618
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,600
with supporting this.

619
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:21,530
Mostly we've got a lot of buy-in, both from the games team and from our brand team, but

620
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:24,151
I think we're taking it baby steps.

621
00:36:24,711 --> 00:36:29,814
We haven't like overhauled the whole company yet, but yeah, it's a good start at least.

622
00:36:30,514 --> 00:36:34,055
And we're just looking at a mid-core game

623
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:35,596
that we're developing right now.

624
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:37,756
And they're like, oh, check this out.

625
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:40,677
We have so many strong female characters.

626
00:36:40,977 --> 00:36:42,858
And just at the first look, I'm like,

627
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:45,899
but they all have the same body type still.

628
00:36:46,979 --> 00:36:51,320
Maybe this big gorilla could be a female instead, et cetera.

629
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,121
So even if they really try,

630
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:56,262
it's easy to fall back into some kind of.

631
00:36:57,292 --> 00:37:00,834
safe area that you have to challenge yourself.

632
00:37:01,674 --> 00:37:06,536
It's really an ongoing discussion and learning process for everyone.

633
00:37:06,636 --> 00:37:07,856
We are not perfect at all.

634
00:37:10,741 --> 00:37:14,523
My question is kind of, you might have exactly the same answer because it's very similar,

635
00:37:15,324 --> 00:37:20,006
but I've heard of some companies where there is pushback regarding like,

636
00:37:20,246 --> 00:37:22,968
hey we designed all these cool, you know, diverse characters,

637
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,189
and then someone will come in and say, yes, but we have, you know,

638
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:32,372
A-B testing and data that says like, these generic characters perform way better with our audience

639
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:34,093
because, whatever, you know.

640
00:37:34,394 --> 00:37:35,994
Like, sort of when people are...

641
00:37:37,812 --> 00:37:40,793
planting a stake in the ground and saying we have this

642
00:37:40,853 --> 00:37:43,134
particular reason that we want to keep things within the

643
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,256
norm, how would you push back against that?

644
00:37:46,776 --> 00:37:47,256
Absolutely.

645
00:37:47,296 --> 00:37:50,018
We have that challenge as well, especially if you do

646
00:37:50,638 --> 00:37:52,799
character testing one by one.

647
00:37:52,899 --> 00:37:55,421
You don't see the whole character set up.

648
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:56,961
You only see one character.

649
00:37:57,021 --> 00:38:00,043
And then people tend to go for something they know.

650
00:38:00,143 --> 00:38:02,504
They go for a stereotype because they like it.

651
00:38:02,944 --> 00:38:06,466
But if you have a whole character set up, and that's

652
00:38:06,486 --> 00:38:06,987
what you test.

653
00:38:07,962 --> 00:38:13,486
there's usually much less reactions on things that falls outside of the norm.

654
00:38:14,346 --> 00:38:15,507
So I think that's the way to go.

655
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:20,710
And it needs to be a will in the company or in the team that does it as well.

656
00:38:21,491 --> 00:38:22,271
A drive for it.

657
00:38:22,872 --> 00:38:25,293
That you are willing to take some risks maybe,

658
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:27,915
because if you just go by all the tests,

659
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:31,717
you will never challenge what we have.

660
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:36,300
And I think sometimes the players, they don't know what they want to have.

661
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,260
They are.

662
00:38:37,772 --> 00:38:41,914
so used to those stereotypes, so they want it.

663
00:38:42,894 --> 00:38:45,155
But if we present them other options,

664
00:38:45,415 --> 00:38:47,716
maybe they start to reflect more of themselves

665
00:38:47,856 --> 00:38:52,298
and find it more fun to have a wider character base.

666
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,380
And there is an urge for more diverse characters.

667
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,901
Players are actually asking for it actively

668
00:38:58,941 --> 00:39:00,722
and now is the right time to start

669
00:39:00,782 --> 00:39:02,083
thinking about it actively.

670
00:39:03,664 --> 00:39:03,964
Thank you.

671
00:39:04,264 --> 00:39:04,544
Thank you.

672
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,692
Hi there, I thought this was a really interesting tool

673
00:39:09,832 --> 00:39:12,393
and could possibly be used in educational spaces.

674
00:39:12,814 --> 00:39:15,055
I work at a university that focuses on game design.

675
00:39:15,776 --> 00:39:17,397
And I was wondering if there's a resource

676
00:39:17,497 --> 00:39:20,859
where educators could access both your set

677
00:39:20,899 --> 00:39:24,341
of cultural norms and the graph for the diversity space?

678
00:39:25,022 --> 00:39:28,104
You can email any of us and we can send it to you.

679
00:39:28,544 --> 00:39:31,386
And we're, hopefully we can do it as a digital tool.

680
00:39:31,971 --> 00:39:37,339
as well so you can add in like 50 characters and you can get a heat map where you actually

681
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,064
see where you got most diversity.

682
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:43,429
Yeah I think it would be a really great way to start conversations about diversity in

683
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:43,970
our program.

684
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:44,711
So thanks for that.

685
00:39:44,971 --> 00:39:45,412
Sounds great.

686
00:39:49,192 --> 00:39:52,115
Hi, so this exercise that we used,

687
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:54,777
there were a lot of different metrics for diversity.

688
00:39:55,238 --> 00:39:57,420
There was gender, ability, body type.

689
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,163
Have you, do you focus on all of them systemically at King

690
00:40:01,223 --> 00:40:03,385
or are you finding some more difficult

691
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:04,666
to expand than others?

692
00:40:05,868 --> 00:40:08,990
I think we're not that story driven yet at King.

693
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:12,234
So sexuality has never come up as a point.

694
00:40:14,474 --> 00:40:16,996
Mental health hasn't or religion.

695
00:40:17,116 --> 00:40:18,717
So there's a few points lacking,

696
00:40:18,737 --> 00:40:22,981
but we wanted to do this as covering as possible.

697
00:40:24,142 --> 00:40:26,864
So if you've got a really strong storyline

698
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,765
and it's clear for players,

699
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:31,027
I think you can actually check in

700
00:40:31,107 --> 00:40:32,809
on all the points in diversity space.

701
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:34,190
All right, thank you.

702
00:40:35,331 --> 00:40:35,671
Thank you.

703
00:40:36,031 --> 00:40:36,772
Any more questions?

704
00:40:38,954 --> 00:40:39,875
Okay, great.

705
00:40:40,155 --> 00:40:41,056
Thank you for your time.

706
00:40:41,176 --> 00:40:41,976
It's been awesome to have you here.
