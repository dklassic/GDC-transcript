1
00:00:05,117 --> 00:00:08,801
Ladies, gentlemen and those who are neither, welcome to the very last day of GDC.

2
00:00:09,702 --> 00:00:13,787
Thank you for coming. Swery is on next, around the corner, if you're not sure why you're here.

3
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,433
Carol, the stagehand, demonstrated her death stare earlier to me,

4
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:26,521
and I don't recommend being on the receiving end of it, so please turn off your mobile devices now to be safe from that fate.

5
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:33,034
And I've been asked to remind you that at the end of this session, you should turn off your...

6
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:37,439
Sorry, you should turn off... you should fill in the evaluations that you should receive by email,

7
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,562
which is the most interactive part of the talk.

8
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:45,027
I'm Alexis Kennedy. I am the CEO of Weather Factory,

9
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:48,111
which is super fancy considering there are exactly three of us at the moment.

10
00:00:49,242 --> 00:00:51,803
and two-thirds of Weather Factory is in this room.

11
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,784
My co-founder Lottie is over there in the front row,

12
00:00:53,864 --> 00:00:56,884
or head of PR and marketing is back in London

13
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:58,925
doing PR and marketing.

14
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:03,766
And I'm here to talk about making art while making bank.

15
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:07,267
Carta Simulator is the game

16
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:08,547
I'm mostly going to be talking about,

17
00:01:08,587 --> 00:01:10,368
but I'll touch on some other stuff too.

18
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:14,409
And the key point here is the rejected alternative title

19
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,910
for this talk, which was this.

20
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,790
Hands up if you think art is important.

21
00:01:22,152 --> 00:01:24,353
Hands up if you think food is important.

22
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:27,535
If you put your hand up both times,

23
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:29,397
you're probably in the right room.

24
00:01:30,117 --> 00:01:32,399
If you're making free alt games,

25
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:34,520
purely experimental art for art's sake.

26
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:38,389
then good on you, you're doing the Lord's work,

27
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:39,510
and I wish you well.

28
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,492
If you are making games purely as product,

29
00:01:43,732 --> 00:01:45,673
and you're not interested in doing anything

30
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:49,054
creatively unusual, this talk is likely to be less useful.

31
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:52,176
What we try to do at Weather Factory

32
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:53,756
is experimental narrative work,

33
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,558
and experimental means a rocky road,

34
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:58,459
but it also means some opportunities,

35
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:00,540
commercially as well as creatively,

36
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,600
that you don't get elsewhere.

37
00:02:04,268 --> 00:02:05,770
This is my Here I Am slide.

38
00:02:07,271 --> 00:02:10,133
10 years ago, I founded Failbetter Games in London,

39
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,976
where I made Forn in London,

40
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:15,337
I was creative director on Sunless Sea,

41
00:02:15,357 --> 00:02:16,397
we did a bunch of other stuff.

42
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,960
And after seven years, I had built Failbetter

43
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,602
into a machine that made Forn in London games

44
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:24,163
and continued to make Forn in London.

45
00:02:24,183 --> 00:02:25,584
They're still doing that to this day.

46
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:29,327
And for that reason, among others,

47
00:02:29,807 --> 00:02:32,730
I talked a lot about this at my GDC talk last year.

48
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,969
I decided to leave and stepped away

49
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,310
and did a sort of rolling year,

50
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:41,552
learning as much as I could

51
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:43,533
from working for a variety of other studios.

52
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:46,736
And one of the things I learned,

53
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:49,257
although I worked with some really great people

54
00:02:49,538 --> 00:02:52,300
and I'd do it again, is that I'm not suited for AAA.

55
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,342
So I founded Weather Factory with Lottie,

56
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:56,923
with a brief, as I said,

57
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,784
of making experimental narrative games.

58
00:02:59,905 --> 00:03:02,427
And Cultist Simulator, our debut game,

59
00:03:04,322 --> 00:03:09,244
We made it in 11 months, the budget was less than 200k USD.

60
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:14,105
It's done very good business and it's been nominated for two BAFTAs.

61
00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:19,507
So I'm speaking to you in the brief bright moment after we were nominated for the BAFTAs

62
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:25,228
before we inevitably lose them to Florence and Obra Dinn but you know.

63
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:25,288
So

64
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,679
Let me talk about what it means to make experimental games

65
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,380
that are also commercial games.

66
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:39,683
Fallen London was my first project.

67
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:45,266
And the idea behind Fallen London is unbelievably stupid.

68
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:47,828
It is a content-heavy free-to-play browser game.

69
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:49,609
The whole point about free-to-play games is

70
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,811
you want people to shell out repeatedly

71
00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:54,232
for reproducible things,

72
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,794
so you skin the same hat in 90 different ways

73
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:58,275
and sell all the different gifts.

74
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,250
Fallen in London, there was a talk on this,

75
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,191
I think it's over this week,

76
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:05,492
has a tremendous appetite for content

77
00:04:06,232 --> 00:04:07,752
because content is what fuels

78
00:04:07,772 --> 00:04:08,973
a lot of the free-to-play purchases.

79
00:04:08,993 --> 00:04:12,354
That was a stupid idea, as was designing it for web

80
00:04:12,554 --> 00:04:15,374
rather than mobile devices because in 2009,

81
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:17,655
I didn't know anything about anything

82
00:04:17,695 --> 00:04:19,916
and I didn't realize that mobile was going to be a thing.

83
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:22,236
It doesn't have a genre.

84
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:25,397
It's very hard to elevate a pitch for in London

85
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,558
or describe it in a sentence.

86
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:30,467
Super grindy, sorry about that.

87
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:32,409
And very divisive.

88
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,090
People do tend to love it or hate it.

89
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:38,974
This wasn't a design intention,

90
00:04:38,994 --> 00:04:42,477
but for a long time it looked like something

91
00:04:42,497 --> 00:04:45,120
that had been built by one and a half people

92
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,242
in a back bedroom on zero budget.

93
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,304
Nevertheless, when I left Valvetta,

94
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:54,308
it was making enough money to pay a team consistently.

95
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:56,863
Those aren't the kind of numbers that get Zynga excited,

96
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,524
but for a zero budget passion project,

97
00:04:59,544 --> 00:05:01,125
it's seven years after launch, that's pretty good.

98
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:06,527
So the C, as any of you who've played it,

99
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:08,308
or watched a Let's Play will know,

100
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,690
is the world's slowest RPG.

101
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,511
Which isn't really a traditional box point.

102
00:05:17,112 --> 00:05:18,073
It's also got permadeath.

103
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:21,114
It's not sensible to put permadeath in an RPG,

104
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:22,635
but we did.

105
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:29,157
It's once again got no discernible genre.

106
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:30,478
It's sort of an RPG,

107
00:05:31,238 --> 00:05:33,219
but I'm stretching the definition to say that honestly.

108
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,881
And once again, it's very divisive

109
00:05:38,402 --> 00:05:39,922
and it did good numbers.

110
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:42,183
Again, not good numbers if you're notch,

111
00:05:42,423 --> 00:05:44,744
but very good numbers if you're six people

112
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:46,425
in a small room in South London.

113
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:49,687
Cultist Simulator.

114
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:50,907
So the first two, just for clarity,

115
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:52,628
were Fail Better Games, my last studio.

116
00:05:53,388 --> 00:05:55,770
Cultist Simulator is Weather Factory's debut title.

117
00:05:56,905 --> 00:06:00,167
And once again, it's very hard to describe in a sentence,

118
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,728
but it's deliberately obscure.

119
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:04,970
It's more like sort of occult solitaire than anything else.

120
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,491
And not only is it deliberately obscure,

121
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:08,932
it has no tutorial,

122
00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:15,596
which is a choice we made with some nervousness.

123
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:18,278
Make a deliberately obscure game with no tutorial.

124
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:20,839
Doesn't have any kind of genre,

125
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:22,721
C for divisive.

126
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,541
And these are the numbers we're talking about.

127
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,662
Very small budget, very good sales,

128
00:06:27,702 --> 00:06:29,964
considering especially what a tough market is out there.

129
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,105
And we have denominations.

130
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:34,947
So, what it means to be experimental.

131
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,849
I'm gonna read this comment because I enjoy it.

132
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,051
The approach is great, the ideas are great,

133
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,432
and the setting and world building

134
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:43,653
are interesting and refreshing.

135
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:45,454
Why thank you, Reddit commenter.

136
00:06:45,874 --> 00:06:47,055
Reddit has a bad rep.

137
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,136
But as a game design student,

138
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:52,183
If I would have handed this in at any point during the year,

139
00:06:52,763 --> 00:06:54,084
they would have failed me instantly.

140
00:06:58,447 --> 00:07:00,629
This is key when you're talking about experimental stuff.

141
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,631
Doing things that no one else is doing,

142
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:05,633
things that people wouldn't normally do,

143
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:09,055
is an advantage, all else being equal.

144
00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:11,037
It means creative innovation,

145
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:12,778
it means commercial innovation,

146
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:17,001
which in a market as tough as the one out there right now,

147
00:07:17,842 --> 00:07:18,362
is a big deal.

148
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:21,226
But, there's a catch.

149
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:25,668
Very often those things look stupid.

150
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:28,729
Worse, often there are good reasons

151
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:30,010
you put a tutorial in the game.

152
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,030
Often there are good reasons

153
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,271
why you were taught in your first year

154
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:33,611
of game design the things you should do.

155
00:07:35,752 --> 00:07:36,592
And this is the catch.

156
00:07:37,193 --> 00:07:38,513
Until you actually do the thing,

157
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:40,794
it's very hard to work out what's stupid

158
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:42,135
and what just looks stupid.

159
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:47,226
So to try to narrow down the things that have worked

160
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:50,249
in the more experimental stuff that I've done over the years

161
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:51,850
and the stuff that doesn't,

162
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,052
I want to introduce you to my failures.

163
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:56,053
These are not all my failures.

164
00:07:56,073 --> 00:07:58,015
These are only some of my failures.

165
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:00,697
You won't even have heard of most of these,

166
00:08:00,877 --> 00:08:01,697
very good reasons.

167
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:03,859
I wasn't creative lead on all of these,

168
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:08,082
but I signed off on every one of them

169
00:08:08,443 --> 00:08:11,065
and I bear responsibility for their failure.

170
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:19,533
Black Crown Project was back when I thought that free-to-play narrative was going to be the wave of the future and replace novels because I was insane.

171
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:28,736
Story Nexus is the shared narrative platform which is going to make us a lot of money and instead nearly tanked Failbetter at the time.

172
00:08:30,497 --> 00:08:34,718
So I think probably I've had twice as many failures in my career as successors.

173
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:42,035
Here are the things that I think the successors had

174
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:43,136
that made them successors.

175
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:46,198
One is that they were both distinctive and divisive.

176
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,100
I'm gonna talk about the difference between that and a bit,

177
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,341
but both those things are important.

178
00:08:51,642 --> 00:08:52,763
They were all reasonably good.

179
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:55,785
Sounds a bit like I'm being flipped when I say that.

180
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:59,928
And people differ on the quality of some of them,

181
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:02,390
but none of them were actively dreadful.

182
00:09:04,637 --> 00:09:08,199
All of them very important, super small budgets

183
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:12,640
by the standards of game dev and very short timelines.

184
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,582
Cultist Simulator, 11 months, Sunless Sea, 16 months.

185
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:19,723
Fallen London, from the time we wrote the first line of code

186
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:22,705
to the time we launched in public beta,

187
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:24,305
was I think four months,

188
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,066
although it's been worked on ever since.

189
00:09:27,223 --> 00:09:29,224
And a suite of design techniques

190
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:31,565
to which I'm going to give the super fancy name

191
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:33,106
of Apothenian design.

192
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:34,726
And I'll come back and talk about that in a minute.

193
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:38,447
So why all these things?

194
00:09:38,768 --> 00:09:39,508
Why are they useful?

195
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:40,368
Why are they important?

196
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:43,229
Particularly if you're an indie dev,

197
00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:47,131
it's vital to lean into your limitations.

198
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,711
All studios have limitations.

199
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:53,393
Indie studios are basically made of limitations.

200
00:09:55,489 --> 00:09:57,711
I used this slide in my talk last year, but I love it,

201
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:58,552
so you're getting it again.

202
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:03,095
This is one of the characters, one of the primary characters

203
00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:06,378
from the popular science documentary, Aliens.

204
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,403
It's the M577 armored personnel carrier,

205
00:10:13,744 --> 00:10:16,506
and it's made of all kinds of fantastic science ship,

206
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:19,909
and it's basically indestructible, and it's very expensive.

207
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,351
You probably remember that it doesn't make it

208
00:10:22,391 --> 00:10:23,312
all the way through the film.

209
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:27,414
This is Rebecca Jordan.

210
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:29,737
She's nine years old,

211
00:10:30,158 --> 00:10:31,940
she has a second grade citizenship award,

212
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:35,365
and she has one very important limitation.

213
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:37,288
She's really small.

214
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,452
So her lifespan is much greater than that of the M577.

215
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:46,400
And as an indie studio, you're not the APC, you're new.

216
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:50,223
So find what your limitations are and lean into them.

217
00:10:50,623 --> 00:10:52,704
Some of those limitations are common to everybody

218
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:54,165
who's reasonably described as indie.

219
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:56,366
Small budgets, limited resources.

220
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:59,668
There were two talks on the wind physics

221
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:02,710
of God of War, this GDC,

222
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,411
and I'm sure both of them were excellent

223
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:06,452
for specialized audiences,

224
00:11:06,492 --> 00:11:08,013
but I've never made a game with wind physics.

225
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:10,674
So all our limitations are different,

226
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:12,295
but they tend to overlap in similar places.

227
00:11:13,428 --> 00:11:14,489
and that's what this talk is about.

228
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:19,670
So being distinctive, and the problem with this slide

229
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,230
is that giving you advice on how to be distinctive

230
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:27,131
is of limited use because if I tell you all

231
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:28,371
what to do to be distinctive,

232
00:11:29,391 --> 00:11:30,972
assuming it's good advice to do it,

233
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:33,452
assuming you go out and do that,

234
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:35,853
congratulations, none of you are distinctive.

235
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:38,333
So find what makes you distinctive,

236
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:40,453
find your specific limitations and lean into them.

237
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:45,129
But because they've given me a free pass for GDC and everything,

238
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:48,531
I have to give some specific advice rather than talking happy generalities.

239
00:11:48,832 --> 00:11:51,093
So let me give you a couple of pieces of advice.

240
00:11:52,454 --> 00:11:52,794
One is this.

241
00:11:54,441 --> 00:11:56,382
So this is the key art for Cultist

242
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,784
that the insanely talented Catherine Unger did for us.

243
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:04,026
It doesn't tell you anything about the experience

244
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:05,587
of playing the game.

245
00:12:05,627 --> 00:12:06,347
Sorry, let me rephrase that.

246
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:07,288
It doesn't tell you anything about

247
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:08,709
what you actually do in the game.

248
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,190
It does tell you something about the experience

249
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:11,950
of playing the game.

250
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,332
It evokes some of the emotions

251
00:12:16,053 --> 00:12:17,774
and some of the setting details you're gonna deal with.

252
00:12:17,814 --> 00:12:19,575
And once you've seen it, you tend to remember it.

253
00:12:23,182 --> 00:12:25,244
Very, very annoying thing.

254
00:12:25,284 --> 00:12:27,185
If you're a writer, as I primarily am,

255
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:30,848
art is much more distinctive than text.

256
00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:33,489
A wall of text looks like a wall of text from a distance,

257
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,212
but art immediately looks distinctive.

258
00:12:37,953 --> 00:12:40,995
And lots of indie games, for this reason,

259
00:12:41,755 --> 00:12:44,657
use a distinctive art style or distinctive key art

260
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:48,100
to stand out from everything else out there.

261
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:51,252
And here's a really important point.

262
00:12:51,952 --> 00:12:54,654
You don't have to spend a lot of money

263
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:56,254
to find something distinctive.

264
00:12:56,294 --> 00:12:57,855
Again, leading to your limitations.

265
00:12:58,496 --> 00:13:00,056
Sometimes you do, sometimes you can.

266
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:01,657
Some games need to be beautiful

267
00:13:01,717 --> 00:13:03,598
and need to look like all the money that was spent on them.

268
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:09,442
But here is, this is Rineira, one of our cultist acolytes.

269
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,983
And Catherine Unger, in the little time she had

270
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:13,964
at the beginning of the project,

271
00:13:13,984 --> 00:13:15,145
because we didn't have her for very long,

272
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:18,579
quite reasonably very sought after,

273
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,461
established this art style for our cards.

274
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:24,603
This, my co-founder tells me this is,

275
00:13:24,663 --> 00:13:26,645
this is something sort of like vector art,

276
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:29,287
I don't really know what that is, but it sounds important.

277
00:13:30,047 --> 00:13:33,570
And the key things about this is, about this art,

278
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,471
first of all, it's very distinctive,

279
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:39,214
people use this art style now for Twitter avatars

280
00:13:39,254 --> 00:13:41,035
or Steam avatars to identify themselves

281
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:42,256
as cultist-simulated players.

282
00:13:42,716 --> 00:13:43,917
And everybody who's seen it knows it.

283
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,002
It's also really cheap to produce in mass quantities.

284
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:50,764
You can whack out several of these in a day quite easily,

285
00:13:50,884 --> 00:13:52,645
which when you have our budgets is vitally important.

286
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:56,748
So that's one good way into being distinctive.

287
00:13:56,808 --> 00:13:58,389
Here's another one, a much more general one.

288
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,030
Genre.

289
00:14:01,651 --> 00:14:04,553
Genre is a tool for communication and a tool for marketing.

290
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:07,875
If I say that I'm making a side scrolling to be at the RPG,

291
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:10,517
you immediately know a lot of what I'm trying to do.

292
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:12,739
And you immediately have some idea

293
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,080
if you're likely to like it or not.

294
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:21,474
But, so people will tell you that you should find a genre,

295
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,858
that you should fit your game into the places

296
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:25,220
where other people like those genres,

297
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:27,724
you should try to establish commonalities based on that.

298
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:29,266
And that all can be good advice.

299
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:32,433
But there is another route, and the other route is

300
00:14:32,853 --> 00:14:34,735
explicitly to eschew genre.

301
00:14:35,395 --> 00:14:36,757
And even if you explicitly eschew genre,

302
00:14:36,797 --> 00:14:38,458
we're still talking about cultist simulator

303
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,780
being sort of a simulation, or sort of a card game,

304
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,762
or sort of a rogue-like, or sort of a horror game,

305
00:14:44,262 --> 00:14:45,623
or try to get to those audiences.

306
00:14:46,764 --> 00:14:49,126
But if you identify yourself firmly with a genre,

307
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:52,689
it's very hard to stand out from all the other things

308
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,170
that are in that genre.

309
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:56,652
So eschewing genre is one way to be distinctive.

310
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:01,508
Divisiveness, right, those of a nervous disposition

311
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:02,828
may wish to look away now,

312
00:15:02,928 --> 00:15:04,908
because I'm gonna show you some orange text.

313
00:15:08,969 --> 00:15:11,210
It's not something that a dev ever wants to see.

314
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,770
God of Simulator is actually wedged at 77%

315
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,811
most positive on Steam,

316
00:15:15,851 --> 00:15:17,331
and is unlikely ever to budge from there.

317
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:18,811
It'll never make it into very positive,

318
00:15:18,871 --> 00:15:19,832
it won't sink into mixed.

319
00:15:19,872 --> 00:15:21,592
But every time we run a sale,

320
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:24,092
we get a rush of people who,

321
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:29,690
haven't heard about the game through word of mouth,

322
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,271
haven't been recommended by a friend,

323
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:33,834
and many of them don't know what they're getting into

324
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,576
and react with confusion, dismay, or anger.

325
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:39,259
And that anger is reflected in a syncytomix.

326
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,302
This is what divisive means.

327
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:44,424
So look at the number at the top there.

328
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,346
This is someone who spent almost 60 hours.

329
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:51,469
I know, right?

330
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,170
But they have actually a very long list of reasons

331
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:55,991
they don't like the game.

332
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:58,532
I only showed you the top part of the review,

333
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:00,593
but it's like 1500 words.

334
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:02,654
They feel very, very strongly about it.

335
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:07,056
Reviews for Cultist Simulator tend to come

336
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:10,638
in three varieties.

337
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:13,039
People really like the game.

338
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,101
People just bounce off the game.

339
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:20,174
or people nearly like the game

340
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:22,594
but too many of the unusual design choices you made

341
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,575
or the rough edges annoy them.

342
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,775
You know, this is the third.

343
00:16:27,016 --> 00:16:27,936
Very divisive game.

344
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:32,297
In a picture, why is divisive good?

345
00:16:34,878 --> 00:16:37,498
How many of you see a blue dress?

346
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:43,460
How many of you see a white and gold dress?

347
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:48,905
The weird thing for me, I don't know if the background has changed it,

348
00:16:48,945 --> 00:16:51,146
but I used to see this as blue and black.

349
00:16:51,687 --> 00:16:54,549
When I was putting the talk together, I saw it as blue and black.

350
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:57,271
And when I started practicing the talk, I saw it as white and gold,

351
00:16:57,311 --> 00:16:58,232
and I can't flip that.

352
00:16:58,732 --> 00:17:00,473
So for poorly understood reasons,

353
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:02,855
this presents to about half the world as white and gold,

354
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:04,356
and about half the world as blue and black.

355
00:17:05,077 --> 00:17:07,378
And the reason that many of you recognize this image

356
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:08,799
is that it went viral.

357
00:17:10,085 --> 00:17:13,626
because everybody who saw the dress as blue and black

358
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,427
could not believe what the white and gold folks

359
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:17,888
were on about and they wanted to explain

360
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:18,968
to each other why they're wrong.

361
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:24,391
And if you are an indie dev trying to build a community,

362
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:28,472
yes, the thing about communities,

363
00:17:29,753 --> 00:17:32,354
and this leads into the dark arts, honestly,

364
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:35,555
is that a community is defined by other people

365
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:36,876
not being part of that community.

366
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:40,406
Any community that doesn't have an edge is the human race.

367
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:45,949
And the thing about a community

368
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:47,750
that has strongly defined boundaries

369
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,291
is it feels very strongly about its identity.

370
00:17:51,752 --> 00:17:54,514
Now, in the age of Brexit and Trump

371
00:17:54,614 --> 00:17:56,535
and the polarization of politics in the UK

372
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,675
and the US and elsewhere,

373
00:17:57,695 --> 00:18:01,517
this is gonna evoke some alarming thoughts.

374
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:03,859
So you must only use this power for good.

375
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:05,079
But the thing is,

376
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:12,216
In the case of Cultist Simulator, in the case of games with thoughtful, non-toxic communities,

377
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:16,462
often this power is usable for good. I said earlier that there are three kinds of response

378
00:18:16,502 --> 00:18:21,789
to Cultist usually. Love it, don't get it, nearly love it but hate it.

379
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:27,038
And very, very often, I'll jump into the Steam forums.

380
00:18:27,078 --> 00:18:29,020
There's Steam forums in all places.

381
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:31,763
And I'll see a thread that begins by somebody saying,

382
00:18:31,823 --> 00:18:33,624
I don't get this game at all.

383
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:36,527
I put cards in slots and words happen.

384
00:18:37,588 --> 00:18:40,310
And occasionally, it's a reasonable summation

385
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,011
of the game, honestly.

386
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:44,514
But occasionally, people will come in and go,

387
00:18:44,594 --> 00:18:45,515
lol, sucks to be you.

388
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:46,716
This game is for smart people.

389
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:48,297
But that doesn't often happen.

390
00:18:49,313 --> 00:18:52,336
fortunately, what very often happens,

391
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:54,918
heartwarmingly so, is the thread will fill up

392
00:18:55,058 --> 00:18:57,501
with people saying, yeah, it's a tough one, this.

393
00:18:59,082 --> 00:19:00,724
Where particularly are you running into problems?

394
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:02,205
Have you tried this?

395
00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:04,387
This is how we fix the problem you're talking about.

396
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:06,409
Read everything really carefully.

397
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:08,951
No, seriously, read everything really carefully.

398
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:09,752
It all means something.

399
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:12,595
So if you have a divisive game,

400
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,400
then your community has very strong boundaries,

401
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,901
your community will feel very strongly

402
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:18,302
about being part of the community,

403
00:19:18,663 --> 00:19:22,545
and your community will often want to recruit other people.

404
00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:27,309
Right, make it a reasonably good game.

405
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,751
This is the most important advice I can give you.

406
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:30,811
No.

407
00:19:39,997 --> 00:19:40,117
No.

408
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:40,177
No.

409
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:40,237
No.

410
00:19:40,257 --> 00:19:40,297
No.

411
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:40,357
No.

412
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:40,478
No.

413
00:19:41,818 --> 00:19:41,879
No.

414
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:41,979
No.

415
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:42,559
No.

416
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:42,619
No.

417
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:53,017
So we're talking about making games which are creatively and commercially successful.

418
00:19:54,577 --> 00:20:02,199
If you go far into the art end of things, a lot of conventional metrics for what is good. Is it fun?

419
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:07,681
Does it sell? Does it attract review scores of limited use? But where we are on the boundary

420
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:08,181
between the two...

421
00:20:10,715 --> 00:20:13,578
You can't say that too loudly.

422
00:20:13,598 --> 00:20:15,560
It has some effectiveness.

423
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,802
If you are doing something creatively interesting

424
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:22,246
and unusual, then people will give you a lot of leeway.

425
00:20:23,547 --> 00:20:29,013
But only so much leeway.

426
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:31,675
Your game still has to be good.

427
00:20:34,582 --> 00:20:36,364
Again, this is a pretty general piece of advice.

428
00:20:36,404 --> 00:20:39,106
So let me talk specifically about a way

429
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,387
to make your game better if you are

430
00:20:41,427 --> 00:20:43,869
making a experimental game.

431
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,772
Feedback is vital.

432
00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:52,315
Feedback from the community is the lifeblood of games,

433
00:20:53,016 --> 00:20:53,756
of indie games dev.

434
00:20:53,776 --> 00:20:56,398
I've gone to like five talks this week

435
00:20:56,598 --> 00:20:58,660
where people have said absolutely correctly

436
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,963
that feedback from the community is what can make a good game

437
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:03,603
into a great one.

438
00:21:04,535 --> 00:21:06,396
or an incomprehensible one into a decent one.

439
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:09,698
But you can design your game in a way

440
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:11,579
that makes it easier for people to give you feedback.

441
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,762
For example, cultists, the core loop is

442
00:21:16,782 --> 00:21:22,945
you put cards into slots and then words happen.

443
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,366
And then you combine with other cards,

444
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:27,747
you have outcomes, those produce more cards.

445
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:30,129
It's a virtuous cycle of more cards

446
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:32,170
giving you more combinations and experimenting with those

447
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,010
and finding more things.

448
00:21:35,455 --> 00:21:41,260
And that core loop was available for the moment I had working code, even when it looked really shonky.

449
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,723
In fact, the core loop was available before I had a beta or an alpha.

450
00:21:48,303 --> 00:21:56,148
I put a prototype doing with a crappy JavaScript gray box interface on the web for free.

451
00:21:56,168 --> 00:22:01,851
I just said to my existing community folks, here's something that I think might have something going on.

452
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:03,752
I think it might be interesting. Do you want to have a look at it?

453
00:22:03,992 --> 00:22:05,373
People looked at it, people gave feedback.

454
00:22:05,393 --> 00:22:08,655
So before even the game had an alpha,

455
00:22:08,955 --> 00:22:12,697
I was testing the core feedback loop and seeing whether there was something there.

456
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,009
You've been to a bunch of talks this week already,

457
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:20,950
I should think, that emphasize the importance of this.

458
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,191
I won't get into it, but talk to your community,

459
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:25,492
get all the help you can from your community,

460
00:22:26,092 --> 00:22:30,694
learn from them, particularly educate them.

461
00:22:31,234 --> 00:22:32,875
So there's two reasons that's important.

462
00:22:33,475 --> 00:22:36,456
If you educate your community about your design decisions,

463
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,458
then they will give you better feedback

464
00:22:39,978 --> 00:22:42,099
and they will educate other people to give better feedback.

465
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,200
So for example, in Culture Simulator,

466
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:47,636
One of the things you start doing very early on

467
00:22:47,676 --> 00:22:50,880
is to drag your job card into your work slot.

468
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:52,983
And it produces some money.

469
00:22:53,003 --> 00:22:55,306
You do that over and over again.

470
00:22:56,887 --> 00:22:57,668
Over and over again.

471
00:22:57,688 --> 00:22:59,110
So you see what I did there, right?

472
00:22:59,130 --> 00:22:59,791
I did an art.

473
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:01,733
You have to drag the work card

474
00:23:01,774 --> 00:23:03,075
into the work slot over and over again.

475
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:07,375
So my community started pointing out

476
00:23:07,395 --> 00:23:09,637
that there was no automation for this.

477
00:23:09,717 --> 00:23:11,299
They have to do the same thing over and over again.

478
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,940
And I said, yeah, well, I'm doing an art.

479
00:23:13,281 --> 00:23:15,103
I want you to feel that it's tedious

480
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:17,926
so that when the opportunity comes

481
00:23:18,286 --> 00:23:19,948
to start studying forbidden magics,

482
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:21,990
you're like, oh, yeah, this is the cool stuff.

483
00:23:22,731 --> 00:23:24,833
And they said, that's true, but also RSI.

484
00:23:26,815 --> 00:23:30,557
So rather belatedly put in a double click option

485
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:31,938
so you can send the card directly in the slot.

486
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,879
I didn't want to pull back all the way

487
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:37,161
on making it a deliberately repetitive unpleasant thing.

488
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:39,523
But if you educate your community

489
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,924
about why you're doing things

490
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,465
rather than just saying it's my vision,

491
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:44,706
then they can respond meaningfully

492
00:23:44,786 --> 00:23:46,067
about which bits are a problem

493
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:46,987
and where you need to fix them.

494
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:50,189
And here this is key.

495
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,371
Cultist Simulator, when we were first discussing it,

496
00:23:55,094 --> 00:23:58,375
could have been more like an RPG than like a roguelike.

497
00:23:59,235 --> 00:24:00,375
The loop of cultist simulations,

498
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:02,896
you play it for basically an evening, maybe two,

499
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:06,096
maybe an hour if things go badly, and you complete it.

500
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,077
And you try it again for a different goal,

501
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:09,297
different set of start conditions,

502
00:24:09,537 --> 00:24:11,437
see how things shake out differently.

503
00:24:13,138 --> 00:24:14,818
And there are several reasons we chose to do this,

504
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,359
one of which is my continuing besotment with FTL.

505
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:21,659
But one of them was that so that

506
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:24,040
we didn't burn out our testers.

507
00:24:25,113 --> 00:24:28,674
If you make a 60-hour game like Sunless Sea

508
00:24:29,314 --> 00:24:30,475
that you play through once,

509
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:36,097
you need a steady stream of alpha and beta testers

510
00:24:36,157 --> 00:24:37,658
if you want to keep getting feedback from it.

511
00:24:38,438 --> 00:24:40,479
Nobody's gonna keep playing the first 15 minutes

512
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:42,299
of your game, and the first 15 minutes

513
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:43,640
are the most important.

514
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,641
But if you make a game where you have to do constant runs,

515
00:24:48,242 --> 00:24:51,163
then you can keep on using the same community,

516
00:24:51,263 --> 00:24:53,183
the same community you spent all this time educating.

517
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,730
You can keep on getting meaningful feedback from them

518
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,510
as you add features to the game.

519
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:01,551
So that's a couple of design choices there

520
00:25:01,651 --> 00:25:04,452
specifically intended to make the game

521
00:25:04,752 --> 00:25:06,512
more likely to attract feedback

522
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:08,152
and make it easier to manage feedback around it.

523
00:25:08,212 --> 00:25:09,773
They're all to do with the game design,

524
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:11,993
not to do with the cool ops stuff

525
00:25:12,253 --> 00:25:15,114
like automated feedback and heat tracking

526
00:25:15,134 --> 00:25:16,334
that I've seen in other talks this week.

527
00:25:17,354 --> 00:25:18,974
That stuff sounds great as well, don't get me wrong,

528
00:25:19,014 --> 00:25:20,015
but this is a design talk.

529
00:25:22,108 --> 00:25:26,411
Right, so I showed you a bunch of projects

530
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:27,672
at the beginning that I worked on.

531
00:25:28,332 --> 00:25:31,014
Three succeeded, more than six failed,

532
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:32,235
seven, eight, I can't remember what it was.

533
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:36,317
The thing about experiments is they often fail.

534
00:25:37,018 --> 00:25:39,299
If they didn't, they wouldn't be experiments,

535
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:40,440
we wouldn't need to keep doing them.

536
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:41,981
So.

537
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,901
Oof, every time I look at this, I get chills.

538
00:25:46,242 --> 00:25:48,704
Jake Burkitt did a Twitter poll last year,

539
00:25:49,224 --> 00:25:52,487
and he asked people how long they'd been working on their game.

540
00:25:52,527 --> 00:25:55,629
Now, that's how long people have been working on their game,

541
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,052
not how long did they take to finish their game.

542
00:25:59,072 --> 00:26:01,274
So more than half the people who responded,

543
00:26:02,215 --> 00:26:03,456
Twitter poll, it's not scientific,

544
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:04,977
but you probably recognize these numbers,

545
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:09,581
said they'd spent more than a year on their games so far.

546
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,781
These are also Jake Burkett's numbers.

547
00:26:14,761 --> 00:26:16,122
If a game makes $100,000 on Steam,

548
00:26:16,903 --> 00:26:19,385
which isn't a hit, but most games aren't hit,

549
00:26:19,965 --> 00:26:22,767
and if one person has been making it for one year,

550
00:26:24,888 --> 00:26:26,269
then that's the hourly wage at the end of it.

551
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,931
If you have a team of more than one person,

552
00:26:30,212 --> 00:26:32,954
or if you are working at it for more than one year,

553
00:26:33,354 --> 00:26:35,156
those numbers get much worse very quickly.

554
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:39,058
So the thing about experiments is,

555
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,660
keep them cheap, keep them small.

556
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,911
Sure, there are lots of ways to manage your risk.

557
00:26:45,131 --> 00:26:47,693
You can get a publisher who's prepared to take a chance,

558
00:26:47,913 --> 00:26:50,254
harder and harder, and they want a lot,

559
00:26:50,454 --> 00:26:51,394
but it's the thing you can do.

560
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:54,856
You can throw something out there in early access

561
00:26:54,876 --> 00:26:55,677
and then lean into it.

562
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,858
A lot of the successful games I've heard about this week

563
00:26:57,898 --> 00:26:59,779
have been people who have an initial winning formula

564
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:02,060
and then iterate and keep on providing free updates.

565
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,000
All these things work.

566
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,221
But if you're doing experimental stuff,

567
00:27:05,261 --> 00:27:06,522
if you're trying things that you think

568
00:27:06,642 --> 00:27:08,343
genuinely may be stupid ideas,

569
00:27:09,263 --> 00:27:10,584
keep them cheap, keep them small,

570
00:27:10,944 --> 00:27:11,945
don't get lost in the vision.

571
00:27:13,461 --> 00:27:14,682
And there's another advantage of that.

572
00:27:16,182 --> 00:27:17,983
That advantage has to do with improving

573
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:22,966
homespun wholesome anecdote that might even be true,

574
00:27:23,006 --> 00:27:23,427
I don't know.

575
00:27:26,628 --> 00:27:30,150
It is said there was a pottery teacher

576
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,272
who one term told half her class

577
00:27:33,632 --> 00:27:35,773
to make the best pot they could over the course of a term

578
00:27:36,894 --> 00:27:39,515
and the other half of the class to make as many pots

579
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,357
as they could over the course of a term.

580
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:49,915
And after a term, half the class had all made each one really badass pot.

581
00:27:51,016 --> 00:27:55,420
The other half of the class had made each of them a lot of badass pots.

582
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,042
As you keep on making pots, you get better at making pots.

583
00:27:58,442 --> 00:28:03,126
If you're polishing a pot endlessly, it's probably not going to be that much better.

584
00:28:03,146 --> 00:28:07,630
And particularly with games, when the whole life cycle is different,

585
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,791
you go through pre-production...

586
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,768
You go through production, you launch it,

587
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,930
you get feedback of a different kind of nature from press

588
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,511
than you get when it's in early access or beta.

589
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:20,072
You start it over again, you change your tools,

590
00:28:20,092 --> 00:28:20,952
you change your approaches.

591
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:23,334
You learn things in a different way

592
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:25,234
when you finish and launch a game.

593
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:27,235
So finish and launch as many games as you can

594
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:29,456
on short budgets, and that reduces your risk,

595
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,457
and that means you learn more stuff.

596
00:28:32,898 --> 00:28:35,839
Derek Yu has pointed out that finishing a game

597
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:37,400
is a whole different skill set.

598
00:28:38,288 --> 00:28:39,169
It's probably exaggeration.

599
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,151
It's not the same skillset as making a game.

600
00:28:42,191 --> 00:28:43,332
Actually finishing it is hard.

601
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:45,814
It's very worthwhile to practice that.

602
00:28:47,174 --> 00:28:48,976
Right, last section, but the longer section.

603
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:52,558
What is apophenia?

604
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:55,780
Many of you know, all of you may know.

605
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,983
Those of you who don't, this is apophenia.

606
00:29:01,884 --> 00:29:02,925
Those don't look like faces.

607
00:29:04,123 --> 00:29:06,424
until they look like faces and then they don't look

608
00:29:06,504 --> 00:29:08,545
anything like anything except faces.

609
00:29:10,766 --> 00:29:14,228
So apophenia is the human tendency to make patterns

610
00:29:14,728 --> 00:29:16,029
and to find meaning in gaps.

611
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:20,972
And if you're a game designer with a limited budget,

612
00:29:21,572 --> 00:29:23,293
apophenia is great.

613
00:29:25,754 --> 00:29:27,515
So the three rules

614
00:29:29,096 --> 00:29:31,077
for apophenian design are

615
00:29:32,132 --> 00:29:33,933
One, don't simulate what you can imply.

616
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:38,296
Two, show your mechanics to your players,

617
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:39,236
make your design visible.

618
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:43,479
And three, lean into your limitations again,

619
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:46,400
cut, limit what you do.

620
00:29:48,342 --> 00:29:49,222
We talk about each of those.

621
00:29:53,285 --> 00:29:56,667
All digital games, with some trivial exceptions,

622
00:29:57,307 --> 00:29:59,588
run on computers, they're all software.

623
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:03,953
Computers are all good at simulating.

624
00:30:04,113 --> 00:30:06,914
Software is designed in large part for simulation.

625
00:30:08,215 --> 00:30:09,796
So simulation is always a temptation

626
00:30:09,816 --> 00:30:10,676
when you're making a game.

627
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:12,537
You try to make the thing that you're modeling

628
00:30:12,637 --> 00:30:14,218
as much like the real world thing as possible.

629
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,400
You think, I'll just add more behavior to it,

630
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,421
it'll be more sophisticated,

631
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,782
it'll look more like the actual thing.

632
00:30:19,222 --> 00:30:22,484
We try to do photorealistic graphics,

633
00:30:22,585 --> 00:30:27,728
or you have two separate talks on wind physics

634
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:30,170
for your extremely gorgeous,

635
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,331
I love God of War, don't get me wrong,

636
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:32,212
I'm not dissing God of War,

637
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:34,634
but the point is that isn't available to most of us.

638
00:30:35,514 --> 00:30:37,636
Simulation is very often a temptation.

639
00:30:38,317 --> 00:30:41,179
So for hundreds, and in some cases thousands of years,

640
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:42,880
other creative forms.

641
00:30:44,098 --> 00:30:47,639
who can't simulate anywhere except between the player's ears,

642
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:51,980
those artforms have been finding ways to use apophenia

643
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,381
to leave gaps in the work

644
00:30:54,701 --> 00:30:56,782
that the player can insert their imagination into.

645
00:30:56,802 --> 00:31:00,583
And if the player inserts, or the viewer, or the reader,

646
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:01,744
or the listener, or whatever,

647
00:31:02,184 --> 00:31:04,825
if a player of your game inserts their imagination

648
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:07,126
into a gap, two things happen.

649
00:31:07,886 --> 00:31:07,966
One,

650
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:10,853
They feel that they own the experience,

651
00:31:10,873 --> 00:31:12,495
it's a more creative experience,

652
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:14,257
and they're gonna be more engaged with the game.

653
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:17,840
Two, the CPU cost is a lot lower.

654
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:20,023
You get a lot more bang for your buck.

655
00:31:20,904 --> 00:31:22,706
So let me give you some specific examples.

656
00:31:30,675 --> 00:31:31,255
What happened here?

657
00:31:33,048 --> 00:31:34,909
If you've played Cultist Simulator,

658
00:31:35,469 --> 00:31:36,729
you'll recognize this experience.

659
00:31:36,749 --> 00:31:39,491
If you haven't, what this player has done

660
00:31:39,951 --> 00:31:42,672
is they've completed a dream action in the game

661
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:45,613
that has unexpectedly torn away the veil of the world

662
00:31:45,713 --> 00:31:48,794
and shown the mansus, the place behind the skin of the world

663
00:31:48,835 --> 00:31:51,135
where the secret gods, the hours rule.

664
00:31:51,836 --> 00:31:52,056
Whoa.

665
00:31:53,272 --> 00:31:54,992
Of course, in the game, we haven't simulated that at all.

666
00:31:55,012 --> 00:31:58,794
What we've done is we've shown the animated graphic

667
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,294
that indicates completion of a task,

668
00:32:00,474 --> 00:32:02,095
and then we've done a rather nice transition,

669
00:32:02,515 --> 00:32:05,697
and then we've shown this big,

670
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:07,377
fancy, evocative graphic at the end.

671
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:11,719
We haven't shown an avatar lying down to sleep,

672
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:14,020
putting the covers over, closing their eyes,

673
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,260
and then a bubble comes out of their head,

674
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,301
and then you see the Mansus in there,

675
00:32:16,321 --> 00:32:17,281
and the Mansus expands to the world.

676
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:18,061
There's a lot of gaps.

677
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:23,512
And filmmaking, the Kuleshov effect is this idea

678
00:32:23,612 --> 00:32:25,492
of long and venerable standing,

679
00:32:25,752 --> 00:32:28,773
that if you show two visual elements in sequence,

680
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,014
people tend to draw a line from one to the other

681
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:32,354
or make an assumption.

682
00:32:32,374 --> 00:32:34,795
If you show somebody and you show a coffin,

683
00:32:35,755 --> 00:32:37,835
then the reasonable assumption is that somebody

684
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:38,536
is in the coffin.

685
00:32:39,116 --> 00:32:42,056
If you show a tabletop and then you show a dream world,

686
00:32:42,937 --> 00:32:44,537
then sometimes you can suggest that the character's

687
00:32:44,577 --> 00:32:45,297
gone in the dream world,

688
00:32:45,457 --> 00:32:47,038
even though there's no character visible in the game.

689
00:32:49,145 --> 00:32:51,046
That was just in here in case the animation didn't work.

690
00:32:51,326 --> 00:32:51,707
Top tip.

691
00:32:53,468 --> 00:32:57,211
Textually, so writing is great for this.

692
00:32:57,611 --> 00:32:59,533
Text also is cheap because writers,

693
00:32:59,573 --> 00:33:00,954
God help us, are cheap as chips.

694
00:33:04,577 --> 00:33:07,840
Glover and Glover is the firm that you end up working at

695
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,382
in Cultist for a chunk of the early game,

696
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:12,383
potentially the whole game.

697
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:17,229
And we never specify what kind of firm Glover & Glover is.

698
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,570
It's got clerks, it's got desks, it's got windows,

699
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:25,192
it's got management system, it pays people, it's run by a family.

700
00:33:25,232 --> 00:33:28,233
But it might be an accountancy firm, it might be lawyers,

701
00:33:28,313 --> 00:33:30,713
it might be a shipping firm, it might be something else.

702
00:33:30,814 --> 00:33:31,794
We never talk about it.

703
00:33:32,914 --> 00:33:34,915
But everybody... That's not true.

704
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:36,535
Many of the people who play the game

705
00:33:36,735 --> 00:33:40,396
will have had a soul-destroying office job at some point.

706
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:46,039
and they'll bring their own experience to Glover and Glover and they'll make

707
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,359
assumptions based on that. So use your player's experiences.

708
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,020
And just the pros there as well, the second

709
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,761
line there gets quoted a lot, people like it.

710
00:33:57,881 --> 00:34:01,642
And curl my hands into the correct shapes,

711
00:34:01,882 --> 00:34:04,702
a lot with a little there, the hands aren't

712
00:34:05,102 --> 00:34:07,243
bent, they're curled, there's muscular tension there.

713
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:11,722
into the correct shapes, we got a sense

714
00:34:11,822 --> 00:34:13,643
that you're conforming to something,

715
00:34:14,104 --> 00:34:18,127
and we also hint at the occult sense of correct shapes

716
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:21,070
elsewhere in the game, comma and begin full stop.

717
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,072
Not, and begin the day.

718
00:34:23,512 --> 00:34:24,813
The day proceeds, it's very boring,

719
00:34:24,853 --> 00:34:26,315
and this happens, and I looked out of the window

720
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,997
and I saw a ship, and blah blah blah.

721
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:30,638
As the edit has it,

722
00:34:33,115 --> 00:34:34,276
get in late and leave early.

723
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:37,817
Leave the gap for the player to assume experience.

724
00:34:38,758 --> 00:34:43,299
Well here, I could have been unhappy, I'm not unhappy.

725
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,881
That gets quoted a lot too.

726
00:34:48,241 --> 00:34:51,943
We don't tell the player, so this is a retirement ending,

727
00:34:51,963 --> 00:34:53,404
this is one of the alternate endings in the game.

728
00:34:54,444 --> 00:34:56,825
If you end up getting to sort of mid-level in the game,

729
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:59,906
getting a promotion or two, and then you decide to retire,

730
00:34:59,946 --> 00:35:02,507
you get this rather melancholy ending.

731
00:35:04,698 --> 00:35:08,160
But it's not a bad ending, it's kind of a victory.

732
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,861
And the key thing is we don't tell the player that,

733
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:13,822
we let them bring their own experience to it.

734
00:35:13,842 --> 00:35:16,063
So text is really good at leaving these spaces.

735
00:35:17,023 --> 00:35:17,824
You know what else is?

736
00:35:18,904 --> 00:35:19,625
Game design.

737
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:24,547
So here is the core mechanic of Cultist Simulator.

738
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:26,707
You put cards in slots,

739
00:35:27,568 --> 00:35:28,948
you hit start and something happens.

740
00:35:30,686 --> 00:35:32,527
There are a limited number of slots on the board.

741
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:35,468
Fun fact, there are usually about five, six,

742
00:35:36,028 --> 00:35:38,649
sorry, there are a standard five, six verbs on the table.

743
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:44,292
And a verb cycle normally takes about 60 seconds,

744
00:35:44,712 --> 00:35:46,493
which means that if you have all the verbs going

745
00:35:46,513 --> 00:35:49,794
at the same time, something happens about every 10 seconds

746
00:35:49,854 --> 00:35:50,775
and you can see it coming,

747
00:35:51,055 --> 00:35:52,375
which is what makes the game addictive,

748
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:53,996
which I stole from Civilization.

749
00:35:54,356 --> 00:35:55,417
Thank you very much, Sid Meier.

750
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:56,877
And,

751
00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:02,360
But you've only got one work verb, or one explore verb and one dream verb.

752
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,642
And the work verb is work in two senses.

753
00:36:06,183 --> 00:36:10,466
It's work in the sense of go to Glover and Glover and earn money.

754
00:36:10,486 --> 00:36:15,389
It's also work in the sense of the great work, the magical work.

755
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,252
And so you can use two kinds of things in work.

756
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,346
your job cards and your abilities to generate money.

757
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:27,748
And you can also use rights to perform occult operations

758
00:36:27,808 --> 00:36:30,510
and summon things or murder people

759
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,951
or whatever you feel like doing.

760
00:36:34,852 --> 00:36:36,653
The point is you can only do one of those at a time.

761
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:39,715
If you're doing occult operations,

762
00:36:40,836 --> 00:36:43,697
you are not going to work and earn any money and vice versa.

763
00:36:45,482 --> 00:36:50,725
And this is the core of the, one of the creative intentions of the game.

764
00:36:50,785 --> 00:36:54,467
It's the division between your day job and the secret wonders of the night,

765
00:36:55,687 --> 00:37:00,210
which a lot of indie devs who've worked part-time on their own projects will recognize.

766
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:03,431
And I'm not even being cheap there.

767
00:37:03,631 --> 00:37:07,293
When I first did the Cult Assimilator prototype, I was about to do a bunch of contract work,

768
00:37:09,058 --> 00:37:14,479
creatively engaged by the difference between the things you love doing and the things you have to do.

769
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:18,400
But the point is, Cultist doesn't give you a speech about that.

770
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,301
There's no opening text crawl that says,

771
00:37:20,841 --> 00:37:24,622
the choice that the humanist must make is between dreams and life.

772
00:37:25,922 --> 00:37:32,904
It presents that mechanically for you to absorb and enthuse about on a Steam review, hopefully.

773
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:37,005
Here's another game that does something beautiful with mechanics, very minimally.

774
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,240
Heretic Operative came out last month,

775
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,041
strongly recommend it,

776
00:37:43,121 --> 00:37:47,783
sort of Elder Signs Omens board gamey sort of thing.

777
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:50,484
The only two numbers you need to worry about here

778
00:37:51,224 --> 00:37:55,126
that our NPC has are the one by the black cross,

779
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:56,146
which is corruption,

780
00:37:56,886 --> 00:38:00,408
and the one by the orb in two hands, which is tranquility.

781
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:03,729
And magic in Heretic Operative works like this.

782
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:08,974
Every time you cast a spell, you gain corruption.

783
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:11,814
Corruption reaches 100, you switch sides.

784
00:38:12,975 --> 00:38:14,935
Every turn, whether you cast a spell or not,

785
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:17,796
your corruption goes down by your tranquility.

786
00:38:18,336 --> 00:38:20,577
So if you manage to spend some time not doing magic,

787
00:38:21,297 --> 00:38:23,077
then you'll return to normal.

788
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:27,798
You don't spend magic points, you don't take health damage,

789
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:28,859
it's just the corruption stat.

790
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:34,360
If your corruption crest's 50, I think, you become curious.

791
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:36,831
And that means your tranquility drops.

792
00:38:39,352 --> 00:38:41,453
If your corruption quest's 75,

793
00:38:42,213 --> 00:38:45,014
your tranquility drops again because you become open-minded.

794
00:38:46,774 --> 00:38:48,315
And your tranquility can go negative.

795
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:53,196
What that means is your corruption start rising every turn

796
00:38:53,836 --> 00:38:54,917
because you're just too open

797
00:38:54,937 --> 00:38:56,637
to the things you shouldn't be open to.

798
00:38:56,657 --> 00:38:57,857
That's lovely.

799
00:38:58,318 --> 00:38:58,998
That tells you.

800
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:02,755
A lot of the things you need to know about the way magic operates in the game.

801
00:39:02,915 --> 00:39:04,817
And it's also a really interesting mechanic.

802
00:39:04,977 --> 00:39:05,557
Lovely design.

803
00:39:06,158 --> 00:39:08,840
But that is Apophelian mechanical design.

804
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,061
That is using design to tell a story.

805
00:39:12,903 --> 00:39:15,265
The problem with leaving gaps, of course, is that the player...

806
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:18,700
Don't always go where you want them to go.

807
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,942
If you leave a gap, sometimes they'll wander off into the distance

808
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:23,024
and not fill the gap, or they'll fill it with some other nonsense.

809
00:39:23,524 --> 00:39:29,829
Or sometimes they will engage in a creative dialogue with the designer

810
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,693
because the author is dead and all that stuff, and that can be great.

811
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:37,196
But sometimes they just don't feel what you want them to feel.

812
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,417
So the key here is theme.

813
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:41,999
I'm a theme-first designer. Not everyone is.

814
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:45,861
But if you are doing an experimental game,

815
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:48,483
a theme to hang all the mechanics on is great.

816
00:39:48,543 --> 00:39:50,565
And everything in Cultist, everything in Sunless

817
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:51,426
serves the theme.

818
00:39:52,687 --> 00:39:55,730
The art and music all are done in the service of

819
00:39:56,751 --> 00:39:58,273
the intention of the game is going to be about

820
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,114
yearning and apocalypse and experimentation.

821
00:40:00,235 --> 00:40:02,216
Now your creative direction, decide your theme.

822
00:40:03,018 --> 00:40:05,679
find two, three words to express it.

823
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,701
Make sure you keep tugging the theme back to that.

824
00:40:08,821 --> 00:40:10,762
And it's the equivalent of pointing the player's head

825
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:12,303
in the right direction the whole time.

826
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:14,204
They're going to end up looking in the direction you want,

827
00:40:14,244 --> 00:40:16,585
and they're going to end up tending to think

828
00:40:16,645 --> 00:40:18,186
in the ways that you want.

829
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:21,448
Second point, apophelium design.

830
00:40:21,468 --> 00:40:23,249
Do this.

831
00:40:24,169 --> 00:40:25,590
Design can be beautiful.

832
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,771
Mechanics can be beautiful.

833
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,561
Cultist, it's very clear what's going on.

834
00:40:31,861 --> 00:40:33,741
You might not understand all the ramifications

835
00:40:33,761 --> 00:40:35,001
of what you're doing, and you might not know

836
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:36,942
all the combinations that will fire things off,

837
00:40:37,022 --> 00:40:39,382
but you very quickly learn the basic metaphors.

838
00:40:40,303 --> 00:40:42,303
And here's something new.

839
00:40:43,723 --> 00:40:45,984
In the last five years, 10 years,

840
00:40:46,484 --> 00:40:48,544
players are constantly more sophisticated

841
00:40:48,584 --> 00:40:51,945
in their appreciation of design and mechanics,

842
00:40:52,485 --> 00:40:55,266
especially the kind of people who play weird indie games

843
00:40:55,306 --> 00:40:56,546
you find at the shank end of Steam.

844
00:40:58,231 --> 00:41:04,876
And you will see people having much more nuanced discussions increasingly that this design sucks, this game is stupid.

845
00:41:05,737 --> 00:41:10,401
You will find people pointing out the things that work and the things that don't. If you make the design

846
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:13,684
visible, if you make your game like a skeleton watch,

847
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,440
then that conversation becomes more thoughtful,

848
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,121
the players can see what's going on.

849
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:22,341
It makes it easier to educate your players on the design,

850
00:41:22,421 --> 00:41:24,122
which is something we said we wanted to do earlier.

851
00:41:24,602 --> 00:41:25,922
Gets you both the quality of feedback,

852
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:27,302
allows them to educate other people.

853
00:41:27,322 --> 00:41:30,663
It allows them to give you better quality feedback

854
00:41:30,723 --> 00:41:32,324
so they can see what you're trying to do.

855
00:41:32,984 --> 00:41:34,924
You don't have to tell them your design intentions

856
00:41:34,984 --> 00:41:35,644
if you can actually,

857
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,265
they can see what your design intentions are.

858
00:41:37,825 --> 00:41:39,225
They're hidden under layers of simulation,

859
00:41:39,245 --> 00:41:40,045
that's not the case.

860
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:45,371
And the final point, cutting.

861
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:50,154
You have a time and a budget.

862
00:41:51,135 --> 00:41:52,716
Even if you're making your game as a hobby,

863
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,417
it still has a time and a budget.

864
00:41:54,437 --> 00:41:58,140
The time is your life, and the budget is all the money

865
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,841
you will ever be able to dispose of in your life.

866
00:42:00,641 --> 00:42:02,042
Everything's a timeline and a budget,

867
00:42:02,122 --> 00:42:05,304
and quick-paced experiments, much, much more so.

868
00:42:06,966 --> 00:42:08,887
At the beginning of a project, you'll have a list of features.

869
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:12,185
and you'll know that you won't be able to put all of them in the project

870
00:42:12,265 --> 00:42:15,888
and as the project goes on, you'll find more features

871
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:21,494
and it's very rare for the feature list to shrink as you go.

872
00:42:22,175 --> 00:42:25,639
So particularly if you're making a strongly themed experimental game,

873
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,341
you want to cut down.

874
00:42:28,554 --> 00:42:30,816
to the things that are necessary to have an effect.

875
00:42:31,476 --> 00:42:34,078
Richard Garfield's talked about a complexity budget

876
00:42:34,158 --> 00:42:36,339
and thinking in terms of adding features,

877
00:42:36,479 --> 00:42:37,540
even if you can afford them,

878
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,881
there's a limited amount of complexity

879
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:39,641
you want in your game.

880
00:42:40,282 --> 00:42:42,643
I think it's a similar thing with a sort of thematic budget.

881
00:42:42,703 --> 00:42:45,105
If you put too many features in your game,

882
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,646
isn't so much about something.

883
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,729
But it's really, really hard to cut.

884
00:42:51,209 --> 00:42:54,011
And there's a fundamental tension between

885
00:42:55,362 --> 00:42:57,364
creator and producer.

886
00:42:57,524 --> 00:42:59,545
And I'm not being snarky about producers here.

887
00:43:00,066 --> 00:43:03,148
My fiancee, a business partner, is sitting over there

888
00:43:03,168 --> 00:43:05,130
in the front row right now, and she's a producer,

889
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,731
a very good one.

890
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:11,054
But designers tend to want to put more things in

891
00:43:11,074 --> 00:43:12,035
and make more things

892
00:43:12,956 --> 00:43:15,478
because we're really enthused about them.

893
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:18,180
And producers are the guardians of the budget

894
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,881
and the timeline and tend to remind us

895
00:43:20,281 --> 00:43:22,803
that we only have finite hours, days, weeks.

896
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:27,115
And very often when Lottie and I work on cultist,

897
00:43:27,255 --> 00:43:30,357
I would say this has to go in the advanced research stuff.

898
00:43:30,597 --> 00:43:32,118
It's absolutely part of my vision.

899
00:43:32,218 --> 00:43:33,099
Do you understand?

900
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:34,300
It's so important.

901
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,321
It leads into the primary pillar of experimentation.

902
00:43:36,341 --> 00:43:37,822
And Lottie would say, okay,

903
00:43:38,063 --> 00:43:40,144
but you did say that last week about that other thing.

904
00:43:40,164 --> 00:43:41,805
You said it was also absolutely vital

905
00:43:41,825 --> 00:43:42,986
that nobody's noticed it's missing.

906
00:43:44,527 --> 00:43:45,968
And the trick we found useful

907
00:43:46,149 --> 00:43:47,610
for cutting effectively was this.

908
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:49,791
Allow the grieving period

909
00:43:49,831 --> 00:43:51,092
and see how you feel at the end of it.

910
00:43:52,222 --> 00:43:55,424
If you acknowledge the possibility of cutting something,

911
00:43:55,484 --> 00:43:56,725
even if you don't take it out of the list,

912
00:43:57,205 --> 00:43:59,306
if you say, you know, this is now going to a maybe

913
00:43:59,326 --> 00:44:00,387
or it's now going to a no,

914
00:44:01,007 --> 00:44:02,569
flirt with that possibility for a week.

915
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:05,691
The end of a week, being a designer,

916
00:44:05,731 --> 00:44:07,832
you may well have thought of five other things

917
00:44:07,872 --> 00:44:09,773
that would achieve the same effect for less cost,

918
00:44:10,794 --> 00:44:11,735
or you may well have decided

919
00:44:11,755 --> 00:44:13,516
that it's not necessary to the vision after all.

920
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:17,382
Or you may think, no, good Christ,

921
00:44:17,802 --> 00:44:19,904
all the ripple effects of taking this thing out of the game

922
00:44:19,944 --> 00:44:21,166
would destroy the whole experience.

923
00:44:21,186 --> 00:44:22,147
We should definitely leave it in.

924
00:44:23,008 --> 00:44:24,489
So give yourself a grieving period

925
00:44:24,649 --> 00:44:26,171
to think about whether you should take it out

926
00:44:26,271 --> 00:44:28,393
and allow yourself a grieving period once you do.

927
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:31,296
Producers allow your designs a grieving period too.

928
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:34,499
So to review.

929
00:44:38,084 --> 00:44:39,545
The things I think have been successful,

930
00:44:39,745 --> 00:44:40,686
they've all been distinctive,

931
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:42,908
they've all stood out in some way.

932
00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:44,750
They've all been divisive,

933
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,672
they've all had strongly bordered communities

934
00:44:46,692 --> 00:44:47,813
that have been advocates for them.

935
00:44:48,914 --> 00:44:50,575
They've all been not dreadful,

936
00:44:51,376 --> 00:44:54,839
because however much you argue that something's art,

937
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,922
it's difficult to make it commercially successful

938
00:44:57,942 --> 00:44:58,583
if it's dreadful.

939
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,424
And the best way to get to that

940
00:45:00,905 --> 00:45:02,706
is to design the game to help you gather feedback.

941
00:45:04,337 --> 00:45:06,278
All of them have had small budgets

942
00:45:06,338 --> 00:45:07,279
and constrained timelines.

943
00:45:07,419 --> 00:45:08,860
One day I'll make a gain for $5 million

944
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:11,002
and it will be dreadful, but I haven't yet.

945
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:16,507
And all of them rely on the suite of fancy named terms

946
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:17,348
I've just talked about.

947
00:45:18,909 --> 00:45:19,149
But,

948
00:45:22,212 --> 00:45:24,313
this is why I named my first company Vellbetter.

949
00:45:27,956 --> 00:45:30,378
And I still love this quote, but I like this quote more.

950
00:45:35,968 --> 00:45:38,029
So I want to help you learn from my mistakes.

951
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,691
Here are a couple of things that we'd have done

952
00:45:40,731 --> 00:45:41,852
differently on Culture Simulator.

953
00:45:45,695 --> 00:45:46,496
I said at the beginning

954
00:45:48,897 --> 00:45:52,260
that it can be an advantage not to have a genre.

955
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,322
Now that was true, but like many true things,

956
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:56,963
it's a little bit more complicated than that.

957
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:02,728
Way too much text on this slide, actually.

958
00:46:02,808 --> 00:46:03,909
You've all stopped to read it now.

959
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:05,410
So I'll stop and let you do that.

960
00:46:07,315 --> 00:46:09,417
So the point is, if something isn't really a genre,

961
00:46:09,457 --> 00:46:11,278
it's actually probably several genres welded together.

962
00:46:11,878 --> 00:46:13,399
So Cultist Simulator, for example,

963
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,301
was kind of an RPG and kind of a roguelike,

964
00:46:17,462 --> 00:46:19,042
and kind of like Sid Meier's Pirates

965
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:20,483
and kind of a bunch of other stuff.

966
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:23,445
But it had a lot of RPG elements,

967
00:46:23,465 --> 00:46:24,466
a lot of roguelike elements.

968
00:46:25,927 --> 00:46:26,907
And that was intentional,

969
00:46:27,428 --> 00:46:28,788
and to a large extent that was good,

970
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:30,129
because it meant that

971
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:36,062
you had the story part of a RPG,

972
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,504
the peril part of a roguelike.

973
00:46:38,524 --> 00:46:40,005
So you really, every time you venture out

974
00:46:40,105 --> 00:46:42,587
on the black ocean in Summer Sea,

975
00:46:43,427 --> 00:46:44,628
you feel the fear to begin with.

976
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:47,250
But the problem with that, of course,

977
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:49,752
as all the reviews very reasonably said,

978
00:46:49,812 --> 00:46:52,374
is that that's great the first three times.

979
00:46:53,294 --> 00:46:55,436
Then after that, because it's not really a roguelike,

980
00:46:55,476 --> 00:46:57,778
it doesn't have enough variation in the beginning.

981
00:46:57,798 --> 00:46:58,958
That was my big design mistake.

982
00:47:00,553 --> 00:47:01,593
you repeat the same story,

983
00:47:02,014 --> 00:47:03,434
and however beautifully written the story,

984
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:05,556
it's not interesting the fifth time you read it,

985
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:06,836
it starts to feel like homework.

986
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:12,620
So if I had identified earlier where that fault line ran

987
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,100
and the problems of having something

988
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,201
that was both kind of an RPG and kind of a roguelike.

989
00:47:16,871 --> 00:47:20,755
I could have started building in mitigating factors earlier.

990
00:47:20,775 --> 00:47:24,399
This is something I said in my Yama Sutra retrospective,

991
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:24,940
in fact.

992
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,402
If you're doing something that draws from different dramas,

993
00:47:27,442 --> 00:47:29,364
there will be a fault line because some of the assumptions

994
00:47:29,404 --> 00:47:30,726
and expectations won't match.

995
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,588
Find that fault line early.

996
00:47:32,628 --> 00:47:34,630
Find it earlier than I did, and you'll do better.

997
00:47:36,112 --> 00:47:37,073
Same thing with cultists.

998
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:49,037
The reason that Cultist has no tutorial is that I wanted the experience of playing Cultist to be the experience of the character.

999
00:47:49,057 --> 00:47:55,883
I wanted the player to be slowly trying to understand what lies underneath the surface of the game,

1000
00:47:55,903 --> 00:48:05,391
and to have moments of discovery and of terror in the same way that the character who's starting to uncover the occult and the hidden worlds has moments of discovery and terror.

1001
00:48:05,952 --> 00:48:08,494
When that works, it really works. That's what people like about the game.

1002
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,817
But it doesn't always work.

1003
00:48:10,897 --> 00:48:13,320
Sometimes it's just not accessible enough to people.

1004
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:19,507
And sometimes two of the genres rub up against each other

1005
00:48:19,527 --> 00:48:19,887
badly.

1006
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:22,090
So it's an exploration game.

1007
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,292
There's new tutorials so you can find things out as you go.

1008
00:48:25,063 --> 00:48:29,146
But also, one of the big influences on it

1009
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:32,808
was RNG clicker games, having that sense of slow,

1010
00:48:33,629 --> 00:48:35,390
perhaps, sorry, clicker games with a bit more RNG,

1011
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:38,132
having a sense of slow accumulation of resources

1012
00:48:38,852 --> 00:48:40,653
and being able to spend resources on things.

1013
00:48:40,753 --> 00:48:42,294
I wanted the resource management in there

1014
00:48:42,314 --> 00:48:44,176
because I like resource management in narratives

1015
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:47,498
and because I wanted that sense of peril

1016
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,939
for the exploration that would come

1017
00:48:49,979 --> 00:48:51,200
with knowing the game could be ended.

1018
00:48:52,707 --> 00:48:55,349
Very often, halfway through Cultist Simulator,

1019
00:48:55,409 --> 00:48:57,251
either in a game of Cultist Simulator

1020
00:48:57,331 --> 00:48:59,652
or in a player's experience of Cultist Simulator,

1021
00:48:59,712 --> 00:49:01,434
you get to the point where you sort of understand

1022
00:49:01,474 --> 00:49:02,174
what's going on.

1023
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:03,715
You've done all the exploration stuff,

1024
00:49:04,856 --> 00:49:06,797
and you're still trying to get the loot you need

1025
00:49:06,837 --> 00:49:07,558
for an expedition.

1026
00:49:07,598 --> 00:49:09,099
Now I fixed some of that later on.

1027
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:10,660
I took a lot of the RNG out of the game

1028
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,221
and I made the game shorter,

1029
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:13,823
but there's this fundamental tension there

1030
00:49:13,863 --> 00:49:15,764
between the exploration stuff

1031
00:49:16,525 --> 00:49:20,007
and the resource management, the RNG clicker stuff.

1032
00:49:21,195 --> 00:49:23,737
I think that could have been fixed.

1033
00:49:24,398 --> 00:49:25,899
I think if I'd been a better designer,

1034
00:49:25,919 --> 00:49:26,900
it would have been fixed.

1035
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,202
I think if we'd spent twice as long on the game,

1036
00:49:30,003 --> 00:49:30,763
it would have been fixed.

1037
00:49:31,744 --> 00:49:34,146
And I think if I'd been more aware of it earlier

1038
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:36,468
and had directed my efforts toward mitigating it,

1039
00:49:36,928 --> 00:49:37,629
it would have been fixed.

1040
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:41,852
So look for the fault line if you're doing stuff

1041
00:49:42,192 --> 00:49:44,154
that's cross-genre because I don't always think of that.

1042
00:49:45,805 --> 00:49:47,847
This is something the GDC board actually asked me.

1043
00:49:47,867 --> 00:49:49,308
It seems a bunch of the criticism of the game

1044
00:49:49,348 --> 00:49:51,349
there in the UX, is this something you felt

1045
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:53,571
was as designed, or was this a fallout from the process

1046
00:49:53,611 --> 00:49:54,611
and decisions you made?

1047
00:49:56,072 --> 00:49:57,613
So the answer is a little bit of column A,

1048
00:49:57,633 --> 00:49:59,895
and a little bit of column B. And in fact, a little bit

1049
00:49:59,915 --> 00:50:00,555
of column C.

1050
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:07,720
The game's intentionally obscure.

1051
00:50:08,901 --> 00:50:09,421
Some of the.

1052
00:50:11,089 --> 00:50:12,529
limitations of the UI are there,

1053
00:50:12,569 --> 00:50:14,369
because I didn't want everything to be visible.

1054
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:15,850
So it for other reasons.

1055
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:18,251
So there are no tool tips in Cultist Simulator.

1056
00:50:19,271 --> 00:50:21,651
It's partly because I didn't want people to get that sense

1057
00:50:22,172 --> 00:50:23,512
that you could mouse over something and get it.

1058
00:50:23,532 --> 00:50:24,312
You have to click on it.

1059
00:50:24,352 --> 00:50:26,273
You have to dig a little bit deeper into it.

1060
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,853
The other very pragmatic reason

1061
00:50:27,873 --> 00:50:29,314
was we wanted to do a mobile version.

1062
00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:31,354
So I didn't want to bake tool tips

1063
00:50:31,414 --> 00:50:33,635
into what people expected from the game

1064
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,115
was tool tips on mobile are hard.

1065
00:50:35,555 --> 00:50:36,536
And because I learned that lesson,

1066
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,056
we did a mobile version of Fallen London.

1067
00:50:39,479 --> 00:50:40,580
But part of it is intentional.

1068
00:50:41,722 --> 00:50:43,585
Part of it is mechanical limitations

1069
00:50:43,645 --> 00:50:46,469
because the whole flow of the game

1070
00:50:46,529 --> 00:50:48,633
is about putting cards experimentally in slots

1071
00:50:48,673 --> 00:50:49,935
and kicking start to see what happens.

1072
00:50:49,975 --> 00:50:52,899
That works wonderfully when you're translating a text

1073
00:50:52,939 --> 00:50:54,462
into another text using a language.

1074
00:50:55,243 --> 00:50:58,946
or when you're putting different ingredients in rites to see what creatures they'll summon.

1075
00:50:58,986 --> 00:50:59,826
That works great.

1076
00:51:00,567 --> 00:51:03,149
But because I've tried to do everything in the same mechanical metaphor,

1077
00:51:03,229 --> 00:51:07,372
it's less ideal when you're sending people off on an expedition

1078
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:12,977
and you're mixing expedition locations with people and funds.

1079
00:51:13,677 --> 00:51:15,779
It's harder for the player to understand what's going on.

1080
00:51:15,799 --> 00:51:17,460
It's stuck in that one particular metaphor.

1081
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:22,382
But that did also make it much easier for me to make the game

1082
00:51:22,442 --> 00:51:23,883
because once you have the framework in place,

1083
00:51:23,923 --> 00:51:25,625
I could just keep on cranking out content

1084
00:51:25,685 --> 00:51:27,486
and it's a very content-driven game.

1085
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,949
Most of the behavior is specified in the JSON text files.

1086
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:34,673
Final thing, of course, is lack of polish.

1087
00:51:34,693 --> 00:51:36,614
This is a peril you run up against

1088
00:51:36,634 --> 00:51:39,577
when you're making a game that's experimental on a short.

1089
00:51:40,198 --> 00:51:48,063
timescale with a limited budget, especially if you are primarily a writer and UX is your

1090
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:51,925
weakness as it was mine. I got a very talented UI designer, Martin Narokar,

1091
00:51:52,085 --> 00:51:57,428
in to help with that, and Catherine Unger made the game look great, but it's not my strength.

1092
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:05,213
And this was my big lesson, is that I said earlier you can only go so far with

1093
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:08,535
its art so it doesn't need to be good, and that goes double for UI.

1094
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,340
You want to give players an idea

1095
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,720
of where the edge of the piece is,

1096
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,181
so they know when they're going off piece.

1097
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:18,901
They're dealing with an unfamiliar experience

1098
00:52:18,921 --> 00:52:22,662
with lots of peculiar design choices.

1099
00:52:23,062 --> 00:52:24,802
You don't want to disorient them.

1100
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:30,023
Also, I've said a couple of times in this talk already,

1101
00:52:30,283 --> 00:52:33,444
educating your players about your design intentions

1102
00:52:35,684 --> 00:52:36,844
is vitally important,

1103
00:52:36,864 --> 00:52:38,625
because it allows them to give you better feedback,

1104
00:52:39,325 --> 00:52:40,945
and it allows them to educate other people.

1105
00:52:42,138 --> 00:52:45,280
And if the UI is murky, it's like looking through

1106
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,600
a smeared glass window.

1107
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:51,062
So, ideally don't obscure your design intentions

1108
00:52:51,082 --> 00:52:52,722
between the UI like I sometimes did.

1109
00:52:54,703 --> 00:52:58,004
Finally, I'm not alone in this.

1110
00:52:59,325 --> 00:53:02,406
If you are doing an experimental game

1111
00:53:02,426 --> 00:53:06,228
and a small team and somebody on the internet says,

1112
00:53:06,248 --> 00:53:07,508
oh, it's just rubbish, isn't it?

1113
00:53:08,488 --> 00:53:09,509
It's very tempting to say,

1114
00:53:10,972 --> 00:53:12,193
You don't understand my vision.

1115
00:53:13,934 --> 00:53:17,097
And if the UX is clear, if people can see what's going on,

1116
00:53:18,017 --> 00:53:20,219
it's much harder for you to hide behind that

1117
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,342
in a moment of despair or arrogance.

1118
00:53:23,922 --> 00:53:24,923
So it keeps you honest,

1119
00:53:24,943 --> 00:53:26,744
keeps the players hand-roused to hang on to,

1120
00:53:27,465 --> 00:53:29,987
and both requires and allows you to be clear

1121
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:31,068
about your design intentions.

1122
00:53:32,829 --> 00:53:35,111
In sum, be newt.

1123
00:53:36,652 --> 00:53:37,052
That's my talk.

1124
00:53:37,072 --> 00:53:38,133
Thank you very much.

1125
00:53:45,047 --> 00:53:48,168
And we have 6 minutes and 27 seconds for Q&A.

1126
00:53:48,188 --> 00:53:51,529
Hi.

1127
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:52,249
Hello.

1128
00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:52,650
Hi.

1129
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:53,350
Thanks so much.

1130
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:56,751
I'm curious, you touched a lot on the why

1131
00:53:56,931 --> 00:53:58,232
of not including a tutorial.

1132
00:53:58,332 --> 00:53:59,672
And I think it was a great decision.

1133
00:53:59,692 --> 00:54:02,433
But I'm curious about when in the development process

1134
00:54:02,473 --> 00:54:05,375
that decision was made and how it might have required you

1135
00:54:05,415 --> 00:54:08,556
to revisit some of the mechanics or changes or if at all.

1136
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:13,344
Excellent question, and it was, when in the design process

1137
00:54:13,364 --> 00:54:14,926
did we decide not to put a tutorial in?

1138
00:54:15,106 --> 00:54:16,467
So I decided this very early.

1139
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:18,509
And one thing I didn't touch on in the talk,

1140
00:54:18,629 --> 00:54:20,471
because it's more a design talk than a production talk,

1141
00:54:21,032 --> 00:54:24,034
is that if you leave something like a tutorial out, well done,

1142
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:28,158
you've saved 10K off your budget, which is a bonus.

1143
00:54:28,479 --> 00:54:29,780
So that was the intention from the start.

1144
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:33,003
But about two months before launch, my co-founder,

1145
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,663
and our publisher both started to get very nervous about it

1146
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:40,346
because a lot of people would start playing the game casually and they'd just bounce off it.

1147
00:54:41,287 --> 00:54:46,312
And when we took it to an event a lot of people said I keep putting the cards in the slots and

1148
00:54:46,352 --> 00:54:51,397
nothing happens. And Lottie and Humble both said

1149
00:54:52,397 --> 00:54:54,218
Maybe we should consider putting a tutorial in.

1150
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:55,779
And I said, no, vision.

1151
00:54:56,199 --> 00:54:59,681
And more seriously, if we start telling people

1152
00:54:59,722 --> 00:55:02,163
what they can do early on, they won't experiment.

1153
00:55:02,183 --> 00:55:03,524
They'll expect to have their hand held later

1154
00:55:03,564 --> 00:55:04,425
and it won't be as interesting.

1155
00:55:06,868 --> 00:55:10,412
And so often when you've got a design tension like that,

1156
00:55:10,993 --> 00:55:13,095
it was resolved by finding a third way, which

1157
00:55:13,115 --> 00:55:15,798
was to radically limit the number of cards

1158
00:55:15,818 --> 00:55:17,140
you could put in particular slots.

1159
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,842
It used to be you could put any kind of card

1160
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:19,623
in any kind of slot.

1161
00:55:19,643 --> 00:55:22,186
And we said, no, the only things that can go in the work slot

1162
00:55:22,366 --> 00:55:23,267
are abilities.

1163
00:55:24,148 --> 00:55:29,591
dobs right and that meant that nearly every combination the game that's possible has some

1164
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:33,814
sort of effect so the player doesn't feel they're banging on the wall and listening for an answer

1165
00:55:33,854 --> 00:55:38,357
they feel they're there they always get a response the game is having a conversation with them so

1166
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:38,917
that's the answer to that.

1167
00:55:44,572 --> 00:55:44,792
Hello?

1168
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:45,453
Hello!

1169
00:55:45,473 --> 00:55:46,353
Hi.

1170
00:55:47,614 --> 00:55:48,715
I thought it was really fascinating

1171
00:55:48,855 --> 00:55:51,177
how fast the turnaround on a lot of your projects have been.

1172
00:55:51,197 --> 00:55:52,718
You said 11 months, 16 months,

1173
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:54,519
as little as four months

1174
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:56,420
for the general release of Fallen London.

1175
00:55:57,261 --> 00:55:59,082
But you also mentioned that you feel like

1176
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:00,263
something you would do differently

1177
00:56:00,343 --> 00:56:02,964
is try to include more polish

1178
00:56:03,245 --> 00:56:04,906
or things like a tutorial maybe.

1179
00:56:05,766 --> 00:56:07,567
What is the process for determining

1180
00:56:07,808 --> 00:56:08,888
when you're done with the game?

1181
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:10,629
Like when it's going to be released?

1182
00:56:10,689 --> 00:56:12,571
Is it purely budgetary concerns?

1183
00:56:12,591 --> 00:56:13,571
Like it has to come out now?

1184
00:56:13,992 --> 00:56:17,173
continue as a company or what is it?

1185
00:56:17,753 --> 00:56:21,434
So another excellent question is how do we decide

1186
00:56:21,474 --> 00:56:23,194
when we're gonna finish production

1187
00:56:23,234 --> 00:56:24,795
on these very short timescale games?

1188
00:56:26,535 --> 00:56:31,717
And the answer is to play chicken with deadlines, I think.

1189
00:56:32,457 --> 00:56:35,538
I'm a big believer in deadlines promoting ingenuity.

1190
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:36,958
I take them seriously.

1191
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:41,280
And when we took the game to events early on,

1192
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,280
we actually had our deadline printed on the banner.

1193
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:48,884
I said that it would be... we did the Kickstarter in September, I'd done three months production

1194
00:56:48,924 --> 00:56:54,608
privacy, released in May and we said 31st May was the deadline and people came up to us and said

1195
00:56:54,628 --> 00:56:59,292
that's a bold choice, printing your deadline on there, but it holds us to account. We didn't

1196
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:03,034
crunch, we worked a bit of overtime towards the end and we got ratty with each other,

1197
00:57:03,455 --> 00:57:06,797
but we just cut like crazy. In terms of polish...

1198
00:57:09,279 --> 00:57:12,560
Next time I think we would do, this is what we discussed,

1199
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:15,081
fewer features and a bit more UI work.

1200
00:57:15,121 --> 00:57:16,762
I think that's what would have made the difference,

1201
00:57:16,862 --> 00:57:17,862
is prioritization.

1202
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:22,224
Working to tough deadlines also really sharpens

1203
00:57:22,244 --> 00:57:23,284
your estimation skills.

1204
00:57:23,324 --> 00:57:24,785
It's much easier to work to deadlines

1205
00:57:24,865 --> 00:57:25,925
once you've worked to deadlines.

1206
00:57:26,865 --> 00:57:29,126
But all that said, next time we're thinking about

1207
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:31,567
is keeping a sort of a bucket of undefined time

1208
00:57:32,247 --> 00:57:34,388
that Lottie will be the guardian of rather than me,

1209
00:57:34,408 --> 00:57:36,609
but I have to make the case for spending time on,

1210
00:57:36,629 --> 00:57:37,489
but we'll see how that goes.

1211
00:57:37,989 --> 00:57:38,650
That's great, thank you.

1212
00:57:42,515 --> 00:57:44,296
I have a question about failures.

1213
00:57:45,917 --> 00:57:49,180
Specifically, do you have any advice

1214
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,744
for drawing the line between calling something dead

1215
00:57:53,764 --> 00:57:57,767
or starting over and trying something new

1216
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:00,770
to work with the same idea?

1217
00:58:02,968 --> 00:58:06,411
So the question is where do you draw the line around failures when you call something dead?

1218
00:58:06,511 --> 00:58:10,195
My answer, this may not be the question you're asking, but it's always ship it.

1219
00:58:10,576 --> 00:58:14,600
If you think it's going to fail, finish it up and ship it anyway, because even if it

1220
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,043
sells exactly zero copies, you will learn something from the process of finishing it

1221
00:58:18,544 --> 00:58:20,766
and you will eschew regret.

1222
00:58:21,941 --> 00:58:24,263
I think, I mean I said all those things are failures,

1223
00:58:24,303 --> 00:58:25,403
some are more failures than others,

1224
00:58:25,464 --> 00:58:27,345
I think a little bit melodramatic.

1225
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:30,787
Below, for example, never made its Kickstarter target.

1226
00:58:31,368 --> 00:58:34,230
Silvertree did make its Kickstarter target.

1227
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:35,471
It raised money for the company,

1228
00:58:35,491 --> 00:58:36,732
it kept people employed a bit longer,

1229
00:58:36,772 --> 00:58:38,493
but it was not well received

1230
00:58:38,573 --> 00:58:40,294
because we didn't do a great job of it.

1231
00:58:41,255 --> 00:58:45,938
I think, yeah, let your audience decide if it's a failure

1232
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:47,940
I think is the best answer I can give.

1233
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:48,920
Thank you.

1234
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:49,160
Thank you.

1235
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,582
Thank you.

1236
00:58:51,602 --> 00:58:51,642
Hi.

1237
00:58:52,232 --> 00:58:53,633
Great talk, I love the game.

1238
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:59,394
One question, what does the bird-worm slider do in the options?

1239
00:59:00,535 --> 00:59:03,475
Just trying to get a canonical answer.

1240
00:59:03,956 --> 00:59:05,696
It allows you to choose between bird and worm.

1241
00:59:06,736 --> 00:59:09,017
No, there is a...

1242
00:59:09,357 --> 00:59:11,718
We're all friends here, right?

1243
00:59:13,038 --> 00:59:13,878
Hidden in the game...

1244
00:59:16,455 --> 00:59:18,616
I think it's pretty fancy to call it an ARG.

1245
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:20,717
It's not really an ARG, it's a series of puddles

1246
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:22,238
that lead to a series of rabbit holes.

1247
00:59:22,839 --> 00:59:24,800
And if you fiddle around with the bird worm slider

1248
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,520
and poke around, you might find the beginning of that.

1249
00:59:27,941 --> 00:59:28,521
Okay, thank you.

1250
00:59:31,503 --> 00:59:33,884
Hello, so I played both Sunlight Sea

1251
00:59:34,084 --> 00:59:36,045
and the Cautious Simulation.

1252
00:59:36,065 --> 00:59:38,387
I think both of them are very great.

1253
00:59:38,407 --> 00:59:39,247
Thank you very much.

1254
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:45,754
And I just think also the mechanic is something that I am really impressed.

1255
00:59:47,275 --> 00:59:50,977
Like the cards, combine the card and the TRPGs gameplay

1256
00:59:51,137 --> 00:59:55,879
and like put the cards into some actions to do something.

1257
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,020
I just wonder how you get that idea.

1258
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:02,883
I've always loved cards, even before London was card based.

1259
01:00:03,403 --> 01:00:07,305
I think for two, for three reasons, really.

1260
01:00:08,672 --> 01:00:09,894
No, it sticked with two, it was a short of time.

1261
01:00:10,134 --> 01:00:10,875
For two reasons.

1262
01:00:11,155 --> 01:00:13,737
One is that if you are a writer

1263
01:00:14,298 --> 01:00:17,862
who likes short, concise, pithy text,

1264
01:00:18,442 --> 01:00:21,085
then cards are great because they give you a natural limit

1265
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:22,526
to write to.

1266
01:00:24,429 --> 01:00:31,037
And also, if you are working on very low budgets, cards are great, because to add content to the game,

1267
01:00:31,257 --> 01:00:35,522
you add some text, you add some behavior, and you add a little image.

1268
01:00:36,703 --> 01:00:41,689
I guess the third thing is that they come with a bunch of expectations that fit into the metaphors that you can then play with.

1269
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:46,313
Like, you know, cards, you often have a limited number of them.

1270
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,175
You often get rid of them by playing them.

1271
01:00:49,495 --> 01:00:52,797
And it also allows you to subvert those expectations.

1272
01:00:52,817 --> 01:00:55,899
Like in Cultist Simulator, some cards have a timer on them.

1273
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,342
Contentment, for example, only lasts 30 seconds.

1274
01:00:59,482 --> 01:01:03,325
And after 30 seconds, when you first see your card on the desktop suddenly burn up in a

1275
01:01:03,345 --> 01:01:05,646
wisp of flame, you remember that moment.

1276
01:01:06,707 --> 01:01:09,549
So did you get it from the very early stage of your design?

1277
01:01:10,896 --> 01:01:16,041
The very, very earlier stage was the Graybox JavaScript prototype.

1278
01:01:16,061 --> 01:01:23,148
And I don't think I thought in terms of cards then, but because I wanted to do something where the mechanics were exposed,

1279
01:01:23,228 --> 01:01:28,794
we very quickly got to the idea of a desktop with some sort of tokens or board game-like pieces on.

1280
01:01:29,234 --> 01:01:30,914
And at that point, cards, for all the reasons

1281
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:33,615
I mentioned below, were immediately the option.

1282
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:36,695
We had a lot more time, a lot more trouble narrowing down

1283
01:01:36,755 --> 01:01:38,296
on the tiles, the verbs.

1284
01:01:38,616 --> 01:01:39,536
There were going to be gems.

1285
01:01:39,556 --> 01:01:40,556
There were going to be drawers.

1286
01:01:40,576 --> 01:01:42,296
There were going to be stones.

1287
01:01:42,376 --> 01:01:45,237
But cards were there as soon as you said it was board game-like.

1288
01:01:45,257 --> 01:01:46,957
Thank you.

1289
01:01:47,577 --> 01:01:48,418
I'm sorry, Alex.

1290
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:50,138
We have run out of time.

1291
01:01:50,378 --> 01:01:53,058
And we do need to move the questions across the hall

1292
01:01:53,198 --> 01:01:54,439
to the wrap-up session.

1293
01:01:55,399 --> 01:01:55,779
Thank you.

1294
01:01:55,979 --> 01:01:56,519
Thank you very much.
