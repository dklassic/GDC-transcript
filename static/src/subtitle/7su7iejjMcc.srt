1
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,014
Alright I think we're gonna get started.

2
00:00:07,514 --> 00:00:10,395
A couple of housekeeping notes first.

3
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:12,676
Make sure to fill out all your evaluations,

4
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:13,856
not just for my talk, but of course,

5
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:15,017
all the talks at the conference.

6
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:19,138
Silence your phones so you're not blowing up

7
00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:20,538
at any point throughout the conference,

8
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:21,659
cause I will throw things,

9
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,960
there are a lot of water bottles up here.

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,260
Wrap up room afterwards if anyone wants to keep talking.

11
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:29,941
on the second and third floor, I think on the other side.

12
00:00:30,502 --> 00:00:32,362
And then everything will be up on the vault

13
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:34,363
at some point as well.

14
00:00:34,423 --> 00:00:36,283
All right, let's do it.

15
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:37,984
Hi, I'm Mike Jungbluth.

16
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:40,905
I'm lead animator at Volition,

17
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:44,406
and specifically on Agents of Mayhem,

18
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:46,326
which I'm here to show you today.

19
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,167
Some of you guys might be asking,

20
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:50,947
what is Agents of Mayhem?

21
00:00:51,387 --> 00:00:52,388
Well, let me show you.

22
00:00:53,622 --> 00:00:58,764
The way I personally like to think about it is G.I. Joe meets Saints Row.

23
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:05,326
It's an open-world game with vibrant, diverse characters and 80s cartoon aesthetic with

24
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:09,167
the over-the-top, irreverent tone of past Volition games.

25
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:14,309
Working on this game specifically has been a dream project for me because it requires

26
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,290
the animation department to focus on the character development that integrates both narrative

27
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,471
and game design in what we're communicating.

28
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:24,992
And we have the ability to implement and drive game feel

29
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,313
and fluidity of the characters.

30
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:29,294
And it's all wrapped up in this really great stylized,

31
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:31,455
aesthetic and tone, which is for me,

32
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:34,076
like everything an animator could ask for

33
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,737
and want in a project.

34
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,098
So we're gonna let this finish,

35
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:41,259
just so you can kind of see the rest of it.

36
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,220
It's almost done, Hollywood doing his pew pew.

37
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:47,042
And then I'm gonna break down the entire process.

38
00:01:47,062 --> 00:01:48,542
We go from the name of the character,

39
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:51,203
how do we see that finalized in the game?

40
00:01:53,691 --> 00:01:55,091
So like I said, this was a dream for me,

41
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:57,972
but as with every dream, there are going to be challenges

42
00:01:58,032 --> 00:02:00,432
that threaten to turn it into a terrible nightmare.

43
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:03,433
And for us, the scary part of our dream

44
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:07,274
was the large cast of unique, diverse, playable characters

45
00:02:07,654 --> 00:02:09,434
to be set in an open-world game.

46
00:02:10,154 --> 00:02:12,795
And this specifically was because each character

47
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:14,615
was going to need, out of combat movement,

48
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:17,656
combat movement, combat abilities, interactions,

49
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:19,516
vehicles, essentially all the things

50
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:21,157
that you would do in an open-world game.

51
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:24,660
Which means the million dollar question was,

52
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,381
how many characters do we want to play as

53
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:29,443
and how many can we actually let you play as?

54
00:02:30,363 --> 00:02:31,724
Answering that question for animation

55
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:34,405
meant defining and understanding a number of variables.

56
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:37,867
A good place for us to start answering those questions

57
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:40,009
and understanding what the expectations

58
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:42,730
were going to be for us were by looking at some other games

59
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,811
that were out there at a time to see what they were doing.

60
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:47,393
But we really had no direct competitor

61
00:02:47,473 --> 00:02:49,554
to give us all of the answers.

62
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:51,135
Wouldn't that have been nice?

63
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:55,376
Games with multiple hero characters are largely arena-based,

64
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:58,440
focused on one primary mechanic, which is often combat.

65
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:01,004
The fluidity and feel of multiple mechanics

66
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:03,387
and all this crazy traversal was fairly limited,

67
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:05,149
so there wasn't a whole lot to pull from there.

68
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:08,792
And open world games are largely focused

69
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:12,353
on one playable character with a really deep suite of moves

70
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:14,473
that fluidly support all of the mechanics.

71
00:03:15,174 --> 00:03:17,134
Our directive was that we wanted to focus

72
00:03:17,194 --> 00:03:19,795
on the unique individual personalities

73
00:03:19,855 --> 00:03:20,915
of characters in a MOBA,

74
00:03:21,276 --> 00:03:22,816
but with higher fidelity of movement

75
00:03:22,856 --> 00:03:24,697
to be competitive with other open world games.

76
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:28,098
So again, we wanted all of the things.

77
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:32,738
But the one thing we did know was the team

78
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:34,218
and the tools that we had at hand.

79
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:37,259
This is the largest animation team Volition's had

80
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,459
on a single project, with twice the number of animators

81
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:41,999
and dedicated technical animators,

82
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,420
focused entirely on the editor side

83
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,480
for the majority of the project,

84
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,281
specifically two technical animators in that case.

85
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,182
This was also the first project to use MotionBuilder,

86
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:55,982
as all past games had used 3ds Max and BiPed.

87
00:03:56,722 --> 00:03:59,003
So we certainly had the support of the studio,

88
00:03:59,063 --> 00:04:01,824
but again, a number of new variables to take into account.

89
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:05,865
But before you can even sit down

90
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,286
and start animating a character,

91
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:08,806
you need to know who they are.

92
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:11,547
And what we needed to know was how to understand

93
00:04:11,607 --> 00:04:13,988
both the design and narrative of each character

94
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,769
so that we can communicate a fully realized

95
00:04:16,929 --> 00:04:18,270
and cohesive performance.

96
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,270
And the way we like to make sure

97
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,671
we're consistent and clear with these

98
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:23,851
is that we establish the character one sheets.

99
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:27,223
With these sheets, we can quickly define

100
00:04:27,503 --> 00:04:28,984
all of the core aspects of a character

101
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,066
that we need to communicate with our animation.

102
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:33,608
We see the art, the gameplay design,

103
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,729
the high-level narrative goals,

104
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:36,330
their personality, and their motivation.

105
00:04:36,951 --> 00:04:40,294
Instead of having to refer to a big wall of text

106
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:42,696
anytime we wanted to get to know a character

107
00:04:42,876 --> 00:04:44,257
or reacquaint ourselves with them,

108
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:46,979
this provided a consistent and clear reference point

109
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:47,720
for everyone on the team.

110
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,542
So let's break down each portion of the one sheet

111
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,024
to see what we consider necessary and important

112
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:54,725
when animating an agent of mayhem.

113
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:56,853
So here we have Fortune.

114
00:04:59,355 --> 00:05:00,396
First up, what you see on the sheet,

115
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:01,497
and it's pretty straightforward,

116
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:03,378
the character's name, where they're from,

117
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:05,560
their concept art, and their signature weapons

118
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,060
and equipment.

119
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:08,342
So Fortune is from Rio de Janeiro.

120
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:10,984
She has her drone Glory, and she has two pistols.

121
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:14,306
Next, we use Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.

122
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:17,349
This is used to quickly define the driving objective

123
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,730
of the character, and define the core motivation

124
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:21,151
as to why they're fighting Legion.

125
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:24,848
The color of the level is then going to be used throughout the rest of the sheet to make

126
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,311
sure that the core objective is carried throughout everything.

127
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:29,753
So Fortune is all about esteem.

128
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:32,156
She's driven by her confidence and her achievement.

129
00:05:32,657 --> 00:05:38,764
She doesn't really feel or need to worry about having to fight for things like family, security,

130
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:40,686
or basic physiological needs.

131
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:44,456
Below Maslow's Hierarchy Triangle

132
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:46,057
is the agent's favorite music.

133
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,199
Fortune's favorite music is reggaeton.

134
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,742
And figuring this out, what their favorite music is,

135
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:53,944
really became one of my favorite elements of the character.

136
00:05:55,212 --> 00:06:00,778
See, a big part of a performance is being able to maintain the emotional state of the character.

137
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,524
For actors, maintaining that emotional state throughout a shot or action can be measured in minutes.

138
00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:09,707
For animators, it's hours or days.

139
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:13,350
This is where knowing their favorite music becomes really important.

140
00:06:14,051 --> 00:06:18,894
Listening to their favorite genre or artist allows you to stay in their headspace for longer amounts of time.

141
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:22,417
It can speak to and influence timing and personality choices.

142
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:26,980
And it helps to unlock additional depth to their character as you search out new artists

143
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,901
and become more immersed in the culture of their music.

144
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:33,122
Even if it's a genre of music you really dislike as I initially did with reggaeton,

145
00:06:34,244 --> 00:06:37,529
sticking with it actually can become a really important part of the animation ritual

146
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:38,671
when you're working on the character.

147
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,817
With Fortune now, if I'm not listening to reggaeton as soon as I need to do something with her,

148
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:44,220
it just doesn't feel right anymore.

149
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:50,072
All right, so next on the design on the character one sheet

150
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:51,012
is this middle part,

151
00:06:51,073 --> 00:06:52,834
which is the character's gameplay pillars.

152
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:55,576
This is kind of a chart Voltron

153
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:58,178
that is meant to show how the core agent gameplay

154
00:06:58,219 --> 00:06:59,840
relates to the agent's personality.

155
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,002
So let's start with the ring on the outside of it.

156
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,564
This is specifically their ability ring,

157
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:06,105
which is broken into five sections.

158
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,787
In the top left is the agent's special ability.

159
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:11,830
This is meant to be used multiple times throughout a battle.

160
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,152
Here, Fortune fires off an AOE blast.

161
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:18,448
And in the top right ring is their Mayhem ability.

162
00:07:19,429 --> 00:07:21,333
This is meant to be used once every few battles.

163
00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:22,935
For this, Fortune has her drone

164
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:24,558
create a Death Blossom stun blast.

165
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:26,879
The bottom three sections of the ring

166
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:28,200
are the agent's passive abilities.

167
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,301
Now, while these often don't require

168
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:31,762
any specific animations,

169
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:34,223
it does speak to their play style and personality,

170
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:35,804
which is really, really important

171
00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:37,085
for animators to keep in mind,

172
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:39,567
as those help to define the characters

173
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:41,108
and the player's in-game performance

174
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:42,168
and play style throughout.

175
00:07:42,448 --> 00:07:44,890
So knowing where we should lean into certain parts

176
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,511
of the character's combat or movement suite is important.

177
00:07:49,946 --> 00:07:52,590
Okay, so now looking at the big triangle in the middle,

178
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,275
at the very top of it is what we call the trait force.

179
00:07:55,877 --> 00:07:57,960
And this itself is broken into four sections.

180
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,164
So we're gonna enhance it CSI style here.

181
00:08:01,343 --> 00:08:01,684
Amazing.

182
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:04,105
So this is broken into four sections.

183
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,367
The triangle at the top is the character's

184
00:08:06,507 --> 00:08:08,308
must-have defining characteristic.

185
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,009
This is their high-level pitch.

186
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:12,370
Fortune is a high-tech pirate.

187
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:13,511
That's who she is.

188
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:15,312
The triangle at the bottom left

189
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:16,853
is the strength of the character,

190
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:19,555
either in personality or in gameplay

191
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:22,016
that we wanna make sure is often highlighted

192
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:23,417
and that we lean into.

193
00:08:23,957 --> 00:08:25,779
Fortune has a really carefree attitude.

194
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:26,359
That's important.

195
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:29,326
The triangle at the bottom right is potential pitfalls.

196
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:30,767
We can see the character falling into.

197
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:32,707
These are areas we really want to make sure

198
00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:34,568
that we're always kind of weary of,

199
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,609
as it could make the characters unenjoyable

200
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:37,969
or too stereotypical.

201
00:08:38,489 --> 00:08:40,790
We didn't want Fortune to be too much of a pirate,

202
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,151
so no Rs and ahoy mates or peg leg or anything like that.

203
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,389
The triangle in the middle is the character secret.

204
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,171
This is something we don't always overtly state

205
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:51,892
to the player or in the game at all,

206
00:08:52,392 --> 00:08:53,833
or even that this character would tell

207
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,233
another character in the game.

208
00:08:55,294 --> 00:08:57,855
But it's something we use to help round out character

209
00:08:57,915 --> 00:08:59,836
and kind of give them depth when we're thinking about them

210
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:00,596
and working on them.

211
00:09:01,097 --> 00:09:03,158
So with Fortune, she's really just doing all this

212
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:04,038
for the money and tech.

213
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:05,959
We found that if it's a really serious character,

214
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:08,060
giving them kind of a silly secret

215
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,261
helped to keep them a little balanced in her head

216
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:11,862
and then vice versa if they were really silly,

217
00:09:11,882 --> 00:09:13,203
giving them something a little bit more serious.

218
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,635
All right, so the next triangle is the agent's

219
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:18,978
unique traversal type, fortune canaridash.

220
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:20,740
That's important to know since we gotta animate it.

221
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:24,424
The triangle in the middle are the range triangle,

222
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:27,508
which signifies what range the agent and the character

223
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:29,290
is best suited for their weapons and abilities.

224
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,452
Fortune is a short-range character.

225
00:09:32,997 --> 00:09:34,819
And at the bottom right is the combat triangle,

226
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:36,621
and that defines the play style and role

227
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:38,603
of the agent's abilities and weapons fall.

228
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:41,746
So this is within regards to mayhem,

229
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:43,368
lethality, and durability.

230
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:45,350
Fortune lies between mayhem,

231
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,932
which is how much they should use

232
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:48,013
and rely on their abilities,

233
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:50,776
and lethality, which is how much damage they can output.

234
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:54,439
And then finally on the sheet we have our coordinate graphs

235
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,820
and these represent the inherent personality

236
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,101
and ability of the characters.

237
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,702
The way these work is that on each line of the graph

238
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:02,063
are two opposing sets of traits

239
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:04,384
and then you plot the character on the graph where they fit.

240
00:10:04,444 --> 00:10:07,907
So specifically on the left is the personality graph

241
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:11,168
which from top to bottom has reserved to showy.

242
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,170
This describes how flamboyant or over the top an Asian is.

243
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:18,738
Are they more willing to be the strong silent type

244
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:20,540
or are they super boisterous in everything they do?

245
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,321
Fortune's pretty damn showy.

246
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:25,684
From left to right, we have lawful versus chaotic.

247
00:10:26,044 --> 00:10:28,947
This describes how much an agent follows a sense of order.

248
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:31,649
Are they more honorable or are they more reckless?

249
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,371
Fortune's rather chaotic.

250
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:37,614
On the right is we have the ability graph.

251
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:40,296
And this is where at the top, natural versus tech.

252
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:43,940
And this describes the agent and their inherent ability set.

253
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:46,464
Are they naturally capable of doing everything

254
00:10:46,484 --> 00:10:48,505
that's going on, or do they really need to primarily

255
00:10:48,906 --> 00:10:50,766
rely on their tech to be successful?

256
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:53,108
Fortune's right in the middle of this,

257
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:55,089
meaning that she's as naturally capable and gifted

258
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:56,589
as she is at using tech.

259
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,931
From left to right, we have team player versus loner,

260
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:02,592
and this describes how well an agent gets along with others.

261
00:11:02,832 --> 00:11:04,813
Are they the type that rallies around teammates,

262
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:06,894
or do they prefer to hang out on their own?

263
00:11:07,194 --> 00:11:09,255
Fortune's much more of a loner, reflecting both

264
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:11,936
her placement on Maslow's hierarchy and her secret as well.

265
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:16,097
So, once you know all that, stepping back,

266
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:19,160
it means that you can get a really quick read

267
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,202
on who Fortune is very, very quickly.

268
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,763
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna look

269
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,385
at the other four agents that we've announced

270
00:11:24,405 --> 00:11:27,168
so far in the game, as well as are gonna be showing up

271
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:27,768
throughout this talk.

272
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:30,095
First up is Hardtack.

273
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:33,337
We can see he's a social, crass sailor from America

274
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:34,277
that doesn't fuck around.

275
00:11:34,898 --> 00:11:37,259
He loves classic R&B and doesn't keep any secrets

276
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:37,719
from anyone.

277
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,681
He can wall climb, he has a short range shotgun

278
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:42,682
and is armed with a teleharpoon

279
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,844
and explosive depth charges for his abilities.

280
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:47,385
He's pretty lawful, only a little showy

281
00:11:47,505 --> 00:11:49,647
and a born natural along with being a team player.

282
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:53,869
Next is Hollywood, he's from Van Nuys, California

283
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:55,031
and he's the face of mayhem.

284
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:57,954
He has an automatic rifle that fires off grenades

285
00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:00,396
and lives for the glory and attention of others

286
00:12:00,496 --> 00:12:01,517
even if it's negative.

287
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:03,920
He loves trashy radio pop music,

288
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,181
the animator working on him loved that.

289
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:07,664
Is on the lawful side of showy

290
00:12:07,924 --> 00:12:10,407
and is more of a born natural than tech person

291
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:12,449
in his abilities and skills, which includes air dashing.

292
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,041
And finally, we have Rama, who uses her bow

293
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:18,723
to fight and secure her homeland from India,

294
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:20,303
from the scourge of Legion.

295
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:22,245
She uses different types of arrows,

296
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:23,505
she enjoys crunk music,

297
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:26,627
she's one of the most lawful and reserved members of Mayhem,

298
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,028
and by that nature, makes her more of a team player,

299
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:32,250
having her use her tech and everything she can

300
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,051
to sort of help out those that need it.

301
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:37,353
Okay, so once we had those,

302
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:39,134
and we were able to have our characters

303
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:40,135
more defined pretty easily.

304
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:42,868
The other core part of the tone we really needed

305
00:12:42,908 --> 00:12:44,509
to understand to be able to communicate

306
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:45,750
was the game's art style,

307
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,392
which is defined on a high level for the game

308
00:12:48,892 --> 00:12:51,214
as theatrical, simplified, and vibrant.

309
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:54,156
So our animation style needed to match that.

310
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:57,239
And what that specifically boiled down to for animation

311
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:00,181
was the idea of the ordinary versus the extraordinary.

312
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:03,824
The ordinary would be things like walking,

313
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,225
running, standing, turning.

314
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:07,667
That could just be sort of standard mocap polish.

315
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:08,548
We could get away with that.

316
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,192
The extraordinary were gonna be things like jumping

317
00:13:12,232 --> 00:13:13,733
and dashing and special abilities.

318
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,214
These were things that we knew we wanted

319
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:17,175
to get a little bit more exaggerated with the style.

320
00:13:19,193 --> 00:13:21,314
And what's key about this is that this approach

321
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:24,236
allows style to be used in a non-arbitrary way,

322
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:26,136
attaching more pushed animations

323
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:27,937
to clearly defined gameplay systems,

324
00:13:28,457 --> 00:13:31,178
which is necessary because stylized animations,

325
00:13:31,238 --> 00:13:32,699
just by their nature, take more time

326
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:33,980
than standard mocap polish.

327
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,621
So we needed to be smart in how and when we could embellish.

328
00:13:38,161 --> 00:13:39,542
And that intentionality, I believe,

329
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:42,023
is what helps to create a unified experience

330
00:13:42,063 --> 00:13:43,483
and quality bar across the project.

331
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,280
So with that in mind, our first style pillar is simplified,

332
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,661
which we interpret on animation as a limited 2D style

333
00:13:52,741 --> 00:13:53,982
matching our overall aesthetic.

334
00:13:55,062 --> 00:13:56,883
That means the timing of extraordinary movements

335
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,884
will be snappy, faster through the motion

336
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:01,825
with longer held poses conveying the key moments

337
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:02,765
of the movement or ability.

338
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:06,227
This means really super simple lines of action

339
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,627
during quick movements, sort of think of them

340
00:14:07,987 --> 00:14:10,609
like smear poses and less as individual storytelling poses

341
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:11,569
throughout the actions.

342
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:14,385
Now, when I say smear frames as reference,

343
00:14:14,526 --> 00:14:16,629
we aren't using any literal smear frames

344
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,551
or shader tricks like a lot of places.

345
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:20,854
What we're doing is we're thinking about the poses

346
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:24,359
like smear frames, where we want to reduce the noise

347
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,821
and complexity of the pose

348
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:27,183
through those snappy transitions.

349
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:29,905
For example, this is a front flip that was done early on

350
00:14:29,945 --> 00:14:32,146
that would show what it's like to be animated

351
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:33,607
in more of a traditional style, right?

352
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:36,288
On the way up, you have the arms and legs offset

353
00:14:36,348 --> 00:14:38,429
as they rise, leading into the spin,

354
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:40,390
and then unrolling naturally as she descends.

355
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:42,712
You know, nothing wrong with it, pretty straightforward.

356
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:45,833
But when thinking of the poses

357
00:14:45,873 --> 00:14:48,074
in a simpler, more smear mindset,

358
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:51,216
on the way up, we want the body to have the limbs brought in,

359
00:14:51,296 --> 00:14:53,197
creating a cleaner, singular line of action,

360
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:55,958
removing any of that complexity and noise that's going on.

361
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:00,191
Same getting them into the ball at the apex, it should happen a little bit quicker.

362
00:15:00,911 --> 00:15:04,031
Coming out of the ball, the character should, instead of unrolling naturally,

363
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,832
they should snap into more of an iconic in-air pose.

364
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:09,033
And then when they begin to stretch into the fall,

365
00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:11,893
again the character becomes more of that singular clean line of action.

366
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:17,215
This is really the essence and intent of smears without having any tech that gives you smears.

367
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:23,539
In regards to theatrical, by attaching our extraordinary actions to gameplay systems,

368
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:28,641
the exaggeration of abilities and personality moments will help to draw focus towards the

369
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:31,042
theatricality of the character just naturally.

370
00:15:32,643 --> 00:15:38,345
With Fortune's special ability, how her guns create a large ball of energy really isn't

371
00:15:38,385 --> 00:15:41,706
as important to us as making sure the action just fits her personality.

372
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:47,039
wildly launching it forward while jumping with a double bounce land makes it feel like it makes

373
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:50,727
sense even if it makes absolutely no sense how that ball of energy is coming out of those pistols.

374
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:55,807
And then this leads just naturally into our vibrant pillar.

375
00:15:55,907 --> 00:15:58,008
And this means that the personality of the pose

376
00:15:58,068 --> 00:16:00,750
is just as important or even sometimes more important

377
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,030
than the functionality of the pose.

378
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:05,072
Instead of animating a traditional jump, for instance,

379
00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:07,633
which hits the proper mechanical poses along the way,

380
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,935
we like to think of the characters more like Spider-Man.

381
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:12,676
His poses when jumping through the air

382
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:15,758
say far less about the mechanics of a traditional jump

383
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:18,999
and more about that character specifically being in the air.

384
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:22,429
By clearly defining ordinary versus extraordinary,

385
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,751
we hope that we'll be able to strike both the bold

386
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:27,872
and balance that we're trying to get with the style

387
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:30,994
without feeling at odds with the mocap

388
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:32,495
and hit that vibrant pillar.

389
00:16:34,236 --> 00:16:34,996
So with all that in mind,

390
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:36,997
jumping was pretty important to nail down early on.

391
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,959
And to me, I really feel like it's the definition

392
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,320
of our extraordinary style

393
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,621
and what we use to establish it, first thing.

394
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,686
So this is a jump test I did really early on

395
00:16:47,726 --> 00:16:49,787
and pretty quickly to show how jumping in our game

396
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:52,350
could look and feel a bit different than a traditional jump.

397
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,172
Fortune was the first character I was gonna be working on

398
00:16:55,392 --> 00:16:57,394
and this model was one of our early test meshes.

399
00:16:58,075 --> 00:17:00,737
We knew we wanted multiple jumps with air dashing.

400
00:17:01,357 --> 00:17:03,119
Come on now, keep playing, you wanna play.

401
00:17:06,553 --> 00:17:07,814
with jumping, with air dashing,

402
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:09,554
and when everyone on the team responded to it,

403
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:10,815
it was like, all right, let's figure out

404
00:17:10,835 --> 00:17:12,815
how to break this down so the animators can match this

405
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:15,416
and designers know what this would take to tweak in game.

406
00:17:19,437 --> 00:17:21,078
So, let's break down the very first jump.

407
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:23,178
And this actually ended up being really close

408
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:24,839
to Fortune's base jump in the final game.

409
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,360
Again, notice the simple line of action

410
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,580
on that first stretched pose.

411
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,600
It's also worthwhile to note that she has

412
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:34,121
zero anticipation on her jump on button and press.

413
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:37,378
As she begins to blend to the top of the arc,

414
00:17:37,698 --> 00:17:39,279
she begins to hit her personality pose.

415
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:42,120
Her crossed legs at the apex, of course,

416
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,881
are not mechanically true pose for a jump,

417
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:45,782
but they do help to start to speak

418
00:17:45,802 --> 00:17:47,503
to her more fun, freewheeling nature.

419
00:17:48,124 --> 00:17:49,685
Remember, we always want to be asking

420
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:51,686
how does this character specifically look

421
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:52,366
when they're in the air?

422
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:55,328
As she squashes at the top of her jump,

423
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:57,029
the core of the air pose is held,

424
00:17:57,689 --> 00:17:59,490
and it's really the follow-through of her limbs

425
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,631
that keep the momentum alive.

426
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:04,681
As Fortune begins to release into her descent,

427
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:05,902
the legs drop first.

428
00:18:06,263 --> 00:18:07,864
This helps to give a sensation of gravity,

429
00:18:07,924 --> 00:18:10,106
pulling them down, but still allows for the feel

430
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:11,528
of the hang time to be believable

431
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:13,409
because the upper body and the core strength

432
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:14,831
of the character stays the same in the air.

433
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:17,053
Notice also that the arms sort of maintain

434
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:19,295
a similar world space, even as they begin to rotate up

435
00:18:19,335 --> 00:18:22,498
to help further sell that held pose and sense of hang time.

436
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:25,395
And then going into the fall proper,

437
00:18:25,915 --> 00:18:28,237
we have the reduced body to the clear line of action.

438
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:30,798
We do have the arms bent to keep some semblance

439
00:18:30,918 --> 00:18:32,939
of control and strength within the character,

440
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:36,201
but to help with the blend,

441
00:18:36,261 --> 00:18:37,642
we found that if we left them straight up,

442
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:40,664
it would give some pretty ugly flashing and tripolation

443
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:41,744
as they tried to settle,

444
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:43,305
so it helped to bring them down a little.

445
00:18:45,247 --> 00:18:46,347
Which all this really just comes down

446
00:18:46,387 --> 00:18:48,128
to examining the spacing and timing

447
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:51,110
is as the second important part beyond posing.

448
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,660
So for reference, here's a pretty standard Muybridge jump,

449
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,361
12 frames, shows you how many frames make up

450
00:18:57,441 --> 00:19:00,062
each part of the action from rising, hanging in the air,

451
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:01,383
and then starting your descent.

452
00:19:02,603 --> 00:19:05,384
And here are the 27 frames for a fortunes jump in comparison.

453
00:19:05,885 --> 00:19:07,465
And you can start to see some numbers there,

454
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:10,346
but better than numbers, right, is always just an image.

455
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:12,268
So what we're really getting at is that

456
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:14,251
instead of a standard parabolic curve,

457
00:19:14,331 --> 00:19:15,553
we want more of a plateau.

458
00:19:15,713 --> 00:19:18,496
A faster up, a longer hang time, and a heavier drop.

459
00:19:19,217 --> 00:19:21,440
And this timing helps to sell the style

460
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,424
of having just an in-air pose instead of the standard jump,

461
00:19:24,484 --> 00:19:27,167
because posing means nothing if the

462
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,130
physics of the world seems the same.

463
00:19:30,512 --> 00:19:32,374
And because of this, we also get the benefit

464
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:33,716
of bringing the jumps into style,

465
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:36,519
meaning that we can use the same for standing jump

466
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:40,023
versus move jumps, because mechanical function

467
00:19:40,183 --> 00:19:42,045
isn't important, isn't what we're trying to convey here.

468
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:43,307
It's the personality of the character.

469
00:19:43,687 --> 00:19:45,209
And because we're doing that, it can function

470
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:47,312
for both standing and jump and running.

471
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,955
So after implementing and tweaking this in game,

472
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:53,556
this is what a jump curve looks like for us.

473
00:19:54,097 --> 00:19:56,598
The top one is the base curve that I just went through,

474
00:19:56,638 --> 00:19:58,439
and the second is her double and triple jump.

475
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,660
As you can see, the rise and hang

476
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,922
remained pretty consistent with that first test.

477
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,103
The only thing we really changed was the drop off,

478
00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:06,103
we eased that a good bit,

479
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:09,405
as having such a harsh drop made gauging jump distances

480
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:10,246
a little more punishing

481
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:11,526
than we really wanted to have in the game.

482
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:14,092
And this is what it looks like in game.

483
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:16,093
Here's her triple jump chain.

484
00:20:16,974 --> 00:20:19,535
And because triple jumps are considered extraordinary,

485
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:21,116
it means that with each jump,

486
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:24,298
we can push the pose and personality further with each

487
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:27,280
in the chain like you might do with an attack combo

488
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:27,880
in a fighting game.

489
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:31,383
So it allows us to really kind of get more and more wild with it.

490
00:20:31,823 --> 00:20:34,806
But how wild we can get goes back to the one sheet

491
00:20:35,186 --> 00:20:37,408
and how showy they are in their personality.

492
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:39,590
Since Fortune is more showy,

493
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,692
she's totally within her character to do flips and spins

494
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:44,834
and all manners of flourishes in her movement and poses.

495
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:46,115
So if somebody comes up and says,

496
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:47,016
I think that's too crazy.

497
00:20:47,236 --> 00:20:49,037
No, no, no, no, we established she is already crazy.

498
00:20:49,138 --> 00:20:49,398
It's fine.

499
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:54,672
All right, so next, key framing and style,

500
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:55,452
pretty straightforward,

501
00:20:55,532 --> 00:20:57,293
but we knew we'd be using mocap as a base

502
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,714
for a lot of the combat animation suite.

503
00:21:00,174 --> 00:21:02,434
So we wanted to know what it would take

504
00:21:02,514 --> 00:21:04,955
to take some mocap and bring it into style.

505
00:21:05,435 --> 00:21:07,176
And we started with her melee ability

506
00:21:07,796 --> 00:21:08,757
as the first place to do that.

507
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,883
So here's the raw mocap that we got

508
00:21:11,923 --> 00:21:13,224
from our actress Maggie McDonald.

509
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:17,589
It's a solid spin kick, but of course we need to edit it

510
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,510
to get it working in game.

511
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,953
So if we were gonna bring it into more of an ordinary style

512
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,435
we're gonna of course speed it up

513
00:21:23,595 --> 00:21:26,197
about twice the speed of the raw mocap

514
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:30,081
with attention being paid to some spacing and timing.

515
00:21:32,143 --> 00:21:33,204
And here it is with a style pass.

516
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:37,057
We adjust the timing to shave off another seven frames,

517
00:21:37,438 --> 00:21:39,879
but a lot of what this style is comes from the posing

518
00:21:39,939 --> 00:21:41,481
and timing before the point of contact.

519
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:42,962
So let's break that down specifically.

520
00:21:44,563 --> 00:21:45,844
Again, like the jump, we're gonna start

521
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:47,925
with that stretch pose, try and keep it super clean.

522
00:21:49,446 --> 00:21:52,048
The height of the in-air motion has been lifted overall

523
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:53,529
to give it more of that hang time

524
00:21:53,569 --> 00:21:55,390
and anticipation to feel similar to the jump.

525
00:21:55,871 --> 00:21:56,731
And that leg, of course,

526
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:58,613
will just be starting to drag immediately.

527
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:03,552
The body has largely hit that held in air pose

528
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,533
that's important to the character,

529
00:22:04,894 --> 00:22:06,976
even as that leg breaks that hip,

530
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:09,079
entirely not worrying about it.

531
00:22:11,182 --> 00:22:13,164
And again, the body is really maintaining

532
00:22:13,284 --> 00:22:14,866
that overall sense of pose

533
00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:17,570
while we're still letting that leg drag around

534
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,031
so that it helps to read more clearly.

535
00:22:20,315 --> 00:22:22,796
So when you watch it again, what you can hopefully feel

536
00:22:22,856 --> 00:22:24,556
more than see is that attention spent

537
00:22:24,616 --> 00:22:26,537
in that initial lead up to it,

538
00:22:27,037 --> 00:22:29,018
to make it feel more snappy and exciting overall.

539
00:22:29,978 --> 00:22:32,039
So it was pretty much then at this point

540
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,459
in the style of conversation that,

541
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,101
well how far can we actually push these things

542
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:39,622
beyond timing and spacing and poses?

543
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:42,142
Those conversations started to happen.

544
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:43,283
And of course for animators that.

545
00:22:43,743 --> 00:22:45,524
usually comes to squash and stretch, right?

546
00:22:46,884 --> 00:22:49,265
And so we needed to make sure we defined that

547
00:22:49,305 --> 00:22:51,546
before people started going too crazy with it.

548
00:22:52,446 --> 00:22:54,087
Using MotionBuilder and not custom rigs,

549
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:57,008
that inherently limited us to how much we could do.

550
00:22:57,428 --> 00:22:59,288
But again, with MoCap being a large part

551
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:00,069
of our movement suite,

552
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:02,069
it couldn't really be too over the top.

553
00:23:02,609 --> 00:23:04,090
So like our overall style,

554
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,770
we needed to be rather purposeful

555
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,311
and non-arbitrary in its use.

556
00:23:08,912 --> 00:23:10,193
So here's Fortune's dash left.

557
00:23:10,694 --> 00:23:12,976
There's some squash and stretch built into her spine,

558
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:15,720
but it's more to carry the energy of the motion

559
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,743
through the spine than to make it feel super snappy

560
00:23:18,843 --> 00:23:19,564
or over the top.

561
00:23:20,626 --> 00:23:22,567
You know, we really want you to sort of feel it

562
00:23:22,627 --> 00:23:25,888
more than see it and not have it instantly jump out at you.

563
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:29,330
It isn't even also meant to be used on everything

564
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,950
that needs to be brought into style,

565
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,232
only when you need to sort of keep that pose or energy alive.

566
00:23:34,492 --> 00:23:36,773
It needs to serve the core functionality of the style.

567
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:39,874
Posing and timing are really what are at the core.

568
00:23:39,894 --> 00:23:41,275
This just supports it.

569
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:46,357
Okay, so we know more about the characters.

570
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:48,178
We know more about the style of the game.

571
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:50,950
we can now finally start to digging into

572
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,532
what the overall quality of the animation is

573
00:23:53,612 --> 00:23:56,314
and start to find some more of those answers

574
00:23:56,374 --> 00:23:58,856
as to just how many characters we can support.

575
00:24:01,078 --> 00:24:03,080
So one last thing we really wanted to do

576
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,721
before we got this was establish two rules.

577
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,023
First, we agreed that out of combat

578
00:24:07,163 --> 00:24:09,965
needed to have higher quality visuals versus in combat.

579
00:24:10,586 --> 00:24:12,467
This was because the player character

580
00:24:12,647 --> 00:24:14,969
is really the focus of them out of combat.

581
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:16,711
You're watching the character as you're playing with them.

582
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:16,891
But.

583
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:19,492
During combat, right, you're watching the reticle,

584
00:24:19,512 --> 00:24:21,133
the character is in focus to that.

585
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:24,215
So we decided that was a pretty good balance to strike

586
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:25,595
as to where to really spend our time.

587
00:24:26,276 --> 00:24:28,877
And then second was that that would,

588
00:24:29,777 --> 00:24:31,098
we wanted to start with on-ground movement

589
00:24:31,298 --> 00:24:33,199
because that's really something that's pretty common

590
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:36,181
in every game and has a lot of expectations

591
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:38,502
in regards to fluidity and responsiveness

592
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:41,163
that we knew we needed to be able to deliver.

593
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:44,570
So what we did was we started with the bare minimum

594
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,932
of just a idle jog and blends

595
00:24:46,992 --> 00:24:48,393
to see how terrible it would look,

596
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,795
and of course it looks pretty terrible.

597
00:24:51,275 --> 00:24:54,178
But it allowed us to identify the exact areas

598
00:24:54,218 --> 00:24:57,080
that annoyed us the most that we really wanted to target.

599
00:24:58,981 --> 00:25:00,122
And what that ended up leading to

600
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:02,124
was four directional jog starts,

601
00:25:02,744 --> 00:25:06,507
two 180 jog turns, walk, jog, and sprint stops.

602
00:25:07,228 --> 00:25:09,390
We also have additive leans, additive head looks,

603
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,470
additive torso looks.

604
00:25:11,342 --> 00:25:13,503
Establishing a standard like this

605
00:25:13,643 --> 00:25:15,705
allowed us to define gameplay metrics

606
00:25:16,105 --> 00:25:19,048
and markup on the assets for universal responsiveness

607
00:25:19,488 --> 00:25:22,310
to ensure turn rates at different parts of the animation

608
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,651
could be leveraged by all characters.

609
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:27,554
So for jog starts, every character needs to have turned

610
00:25:27,614 --> 00:25:28,835
by frame 10 to 12.

611
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:33,279
And they need to be at full jog speed by frame 11 to 13.

612
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:35,440
No matter the character's size,

613
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,703
they needed to match this metric to match this system.

614
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:42,051
which means selling weight and speed

615
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:44,233
is entirely aesthetic like Hardtack here.

616
00:25:45,214 --> 00:25:46,295
After animating Fortune,

617
00:25:46,355 --> 00:25:48,437
one of the smallest and most agile characters in the game,

618
00:25:48,518 --> 00:25:50,359
Hardtack was my second character,

619
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,541
which worked out really well

620
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:53,423
because it allowed us to prove out

621
00:25:53,463 --> 00:25:55,245
that the metrics we defined with Fortune

622
00:25:55,285 --> 00:25:58,808
could still work for characters of any size.

623
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,739
And what's really become one of my favorite things

624
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,860
on the project is that during internal

625
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,840
and external play tests, we usually always get

626
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,201
some feedback from somebody that says,

627
00:26:07,581 --> 00:26:08,682
yeah, when I was running around the city,

628
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:09,702
I always just switched to Fortune

629
00:26:09,722 --> 00:26:11,603
because she was faster and more agile than Hardtack.

630
00:26:12,063 --> 00:26:13,144
Even though under the hood, they are 100%

631
00:26:14,584 --> 00:26:17,225
at the exact same metric, no difference at all.

632
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:20,925
Another example of meeting metrics,

633
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:23,226
but selling the weight through animation is jumping.

634
00:26:24,047 --> 00:26:25,267
Unlike Fortune's base jump,

635
00:26:25,307 --> 00:26:26,968
which has no squash at the beginning,

636
00:26:27,008 --> 00:26:28,489
just that straight clear line of action,

637
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:29,770
for larger characters,

638
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,792
we do have about three frames of squash compression

639
00:26:32,812 --> 00:26:33,652
that happens at the beginning.

640
00:26:34,032 --> 00:26:36,354
And what that does is that covers the duration

641
00:26:36,374 --> 00:26:37,234
of the blend at the jump.

642
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,275
And it helps them to feel just a little bit heavier

643
00:26:39,335 --> 00:26:40,356
on that first button press.

644
00:26:40,856 --> 00:26:43,278
They still hit the same height metric overall,

645
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:45,020
they have the same overall time in air,

646
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:47,723
but those three frames at the front, again,

647
00:26:47,803 --> 00:26:50,425
help to elicit that same feedback from playtesters

648
00:26:50,766 --> 00:26:53,428
that they do on ground movement that,

649
00:26:53,728 --> 00:26:55,150
well, if I'm jumping, I'm also gonna switch

650
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,952
to one of the more agile characters.

651
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:58,213
And again, it doesn't matter.

652
00:26:58,673 --> 00:27:00,795
They can get around the world with equal skill and ability.

653
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:05,884
which really sort of led me to one of my favorite mindsets

654
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:07,104
on the team, which was,

655
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:09,325
let's solve it with universal systems,

656
00:27:09,745 --> 00:27:12,867
not tons of crazy unique assets if we can,

657
00:27:12,907 --> 00:27:14,687
because with multiple player characters,

658
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:17,228
the number of unique assets we could support per suite

659
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,529
was going to be limited.

660
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:20,890
So the more common AAA approach

661
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,431
of just throwing lots of animations into a unique suite

662
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:26,032
for each system, it just wasn't gonna be possible for us.

663
00:27:26,672 --> 00:27:28,493
So the first big test of this

664
00:27:28,753 --> 00:27:31,454
was going to be out-of-combat stand turns.

665
00:27:32,154 --> 00:27:34,956
These are, of course, one of the deepest, darkest holes

666
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:36,657
you can try and fill with animations

667
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:37,998
for the rest of your life.

668
00:27:38,138 --> 00:27:40,859
Slow turns, fast turns, upper body versus lower body,

669
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,140
keeping the feet locked down

670
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,901
versus allowing slight translation.

671
00:27:44,301 --> 00:27:46,162
We just knew there was no way we could support

672
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:48,904
a complex turning system for our characters.

673
00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:49,925
So we didn't.

674
00:27:50,845 --> 00:27:53,887
We, in fact, didn't make any animations for it at all.

675
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:56,128
What we did is we used walk stops

676
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:58,210
and we just let the system handle the rest.

677
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,079
When you deflect the stick,

678
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:01,039
you're getting a couple of frames

679
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,419
of the additive head and torso look

680
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:04,720
as well as that blend into the jog start.

681
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,040
So the character has at least some facing

682
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,481
of their body on stick deflection.

683
00:28:09,101 --> 00:28:10,521
And if we author the walk stop

684
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:12,822
to have some additional foot shuffles back into place,

685
00:28:13,242 --> 00:28:15,362
what it does is it helps to sell the momentum of the turn.

686
00:28:16,122 --> 00:28:17,943
Sure, it's not gonna be as pretty as a turn system,

687
00:28:17,983 --> 00:28:21,023
of course, but it is free and it is responsive.

688
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:22,604
And as a general rule,

689
00:28:23,024 --> 00:28:25,164
if there are a couple of ugly frames on input,

690
00:28:25,324 --> 00:28:27,665
as long as the follow through looks and feels good,

691
00:28:28,185 --> 00:28:29,085
people are gonna be okay with it.

692
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:34,992
So vehicle entries are of course another huge investment

693
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:35,833
with animations.

694
00:28:36,694 --> 00:28:39,437
Once you take into account multiple vehicle types

695
00:28:39,457 --> 00:28:40,579
that you need entries from,

696
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:42,621
from different angles and different versions,

697
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:45,064
and if they already have drivers or maybe passengers inside.

698
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:48,917
What can be a giant suite and investment

699
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:51,738
for even just one character across multiple characters

700
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:52,939
would just be scope crushing.

701
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:56,880
So when realistic functionality for us becomes too much,

702
00:28:57,561 --> 00:29:00,322
it's really time to lean into style and tone.

703
00:29:02,563 --> 00:29:04,884
And for this task specifically, we had two animators,

704
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,545
Josh Behrens and Nick Kneebling light the way for us.

705
00:29:09,905 --> 00:29:12,209
Teleporting and swapping characters is a core part

706
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:14,113
of the gameplay and tech that Mayhem uses.

707
00:29:14,714 --> 00:29:17,439
So using that as a cheat for vehicle entries made sense.

708
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,763
Josh and Prototype had implemented it, but.

709
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,462
It was really with the addition of Hollywood giving those finger guns as he cheeses to the camera

710
00:29:24,502 --> 00:29:30,045
that Nick added that extra bit of personality that really made the feature fully embrace the style and tone of the game.

711
00:29:30,606 --> 00:29:35,088
At which point, these have now sort of become more and more of signature animations for the characters

712
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:40,231
as we kind of continue to one-up and show how they would cheese it up to the camera.

713
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:44,982
The other place that we couldn't afford

714
00:29:45,002 --> 00:29:47,984
to add additional assets was turn fidelity while running.

715
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:50,005
Designers and world builders, of course,

716
00:29:50,045 --> 00:29:52,627
wanted more narrow areas to move

717
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,308
and controls needed to feel tight

718
00:29:54,368 --> 00:29:55,889
and responsive in those situations.

719
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:58,130
And, of course, they still needed to look good

720
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,131
when you're running down a wide open street.

721
00:30:00,652 --> 00:30:02,933
So instead of giving two entirely different suites

722
00:30:02,993 --> 00:30:05,535
for different situations or additional transitions

723
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:07,656
based on different stick deflections or speeds,

724
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:10,058
one of our senior animation programmers

725
00:30:10,118 --> 00:30:11,479
and a professional chicken wrangler,

726
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:14,301
Isaac Veneer took a approach similar

727
00:30:14,341 --> 00:30:16,382
to out of combat versus in combat.

728
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:19,385
See, when you want responsive controls,

729
00:30:19,405 --> 00:30:21,086
you're usually near ledges or doors,

730
00:30:21,146 --> 00:30:22,767
and you're more likely to be looking at.

731
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,562
where the position of the character is and not at the character itself.

732
00:30:27,123 --> 00:30:32,107
But when you're in a wide open space and you want the character to look more fluid and weighty.

733
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:37,231
So Isaac's solution was to toggle a near versus wide mode dynamically and in real time

734
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:41,175
that adjusted the turn speeds based on very specific factors.

735
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:44,103
If there was going to be a wall nearby,

736
00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:45,445
the character goes into near mode.

737
00:30:45,785 --> 00:30:49,330
If you want to turn the corner to go into the door,

738
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,251
you would want it on.

739
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:52,614
If you have a large thumbstick deflection while moving,

740
00:30:52,654 --> 00:30:53,375
it's gonna turn on,

741
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:55,698
and when you start moving it again turns on.

742
00:30:56,298 --> 00:30:57,840
And it stays on for about one or two seconds

743
00:30:58,041 --> 00:30:58,822
in each instance,

744
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:02,106
at which point it can switch back into wide mode.

745
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:04,380
What this did was by adding it,

746
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,041
it meant moving down narrow corridors,

747
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:07,883
making tight turns and small adjustments

748
00:31:07,943 --> 00:31:10,305
to interact with an object were no longer an issue.

749
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:12,667
And since the turn speeds governing this

750
00:31:12,927 --> 00:31:14,448
were being controlled by switching between

751
00:31:14,528 --> 00:31:16,229
different blend trees in the animation graph,

752
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,112
it meant we could also then adjust our additive head

753
00:31:19,172 --> 00:31:20,973
and torso looks between each mode.

754
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:23,899
So what this means is in wide mode,

755
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:26,160
we have the body turn at a slower rate

756
00:31:27,141 --> 00:31:29,082
to look more weighty and fluid in game.

757
00:31:29,862 --> 00:31:32,243
So what we do then is we lead with the head

758
00:31:32,844 --> 00:31:33,644
and then the torso.

759
00:31:33,984 --> 00:31:35,605
And this gives the visual responsiveness

760
00:31:35,705 --> 00:31:39,747
to the player of their input of them looking

761
00:31:39,787 --> 00:31:42,809
as well as breaking up the overall order of operations

762
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:44,249
on what's happening in the character

763
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:45,870
so it doesn't just feel like you're turning a character

764
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,330
on the stick.

765
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,612
Essentially it's what we established

766
00:31:48,652 --> 00:31:50,713
in that original quality video.

767
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:53,852
Notice the order of operations is the head

768
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,934
and then the torso and then the full body turn

769
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:56,554
while she runs.

770
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,319
But in near mode, the body turns at a faster pace

771
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:03,641
to allow for that positional responsiveness.

772
00:32:04,242 --> 00:32:06,704
We also wanted the head to turn fast

773
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,346
to make sure that the character looks like

774
00:32:08,366 --> 00:32:10,048
they're aware of their quick directional heading.

775
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:15,336
But then what we do is we have the torso counter rotate to simulate some drag and again break up

776
00:32:15,356 --> 00:32:20,403
that order of operations that's necessary to do. And at a certain point if running in a circle

777
00:32:20,704 --> 00:32:24,630
then we allow that torso to catch back up so that the head and torso are again leading the body.

778
00:32:25,914 --> 00:32:27,717
So this is what it looks like if I just turned it on

779
00:32:27,757 --> 00:32:28,658
even though I'm in a wide space.

780
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:31,081
It of course looks twitchier than before

781
00:32:31,142 --> 00:32:32,864
and it's not as fluid or as appealing,

782
00:32:32,904 --> 00:32:34,867
but again, this is only triggered

783
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:37,751
when the player cares about that need for twitch movement

784
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,653
and fluidity and weight of the motion

785
00:32:39,693 --> 00:32:40,655
could actually get in the way.

786
00:32:41,556 --> 00:32:44,599
And you notice here as she runs in the circle

787
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:46,561
that the torso drags behind the head and the body.

788
00:32:47,302 --> 00:32:49,285
Being to break up those order of operations

789
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:51,347
is really key in making any of this stuff

790
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:53,589
look in any way convincing or compelling

791
00:32:53,649 --> 00:32:56,012
without spending a crap ton of time on new assets.

792
00:32:58,618 --> 00:33:01,600
Another big animation asset sync is combat aim movements.

793
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:04,302
Even though we decided not to focus as much

794
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:07,104
on combat movement as we were going to out of combat,

795
00:33:07,745 --> 00:33:09,646
one area that we really wanted to address

796
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:11,928
was those legs crashing through each other

797
00:33:11,988 --> 00:33:14,070
as they cross from front to back moving angles.

798
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,012
But the traditional eight animations used

799
00:33:17,032 --> 00:33:19,554
before the studio per speed for this would

800
00:33:19,694 --> 00:33:21,775
really even add up across multiple characters.

801
00:33:23,256 --> 00:33:24,637
Enter at this point the mad genius

802
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:27,179
of senior animator and cat lover, Clay Mathews.

803
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,300
I don't know if he loves cats.

804
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,383
The previous approaches used at the studio

805
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:34,125
was to capture the four cardinal directions

806
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,288
and then some diagonals as shown here

807
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:38,150
to cover the transition of the character

808
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,153
changing from that forward running gate

809
00:33:40,193 --> 00:33:41,074
to the backwards pedaling.

810
00:33:41,795 --> 00:33:43,878
And you would put them all into a single blend tree

811
00:33:43,978 --> 00:33:46,621
and blend them all smoothly as the thumbstick rolls around.

812
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:49,979
Then in game, there was IK aim orientation

813
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:52,502
with the upper body used to keep the character aiming

814
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:53,763
at the straight ahead at the reticle.

815
00:33:54,383 --> 00:33:55,905
And while this certainly works,

816
00:33:56,165 --> 00:33:59,388
it still wasn't an ideal method for quality or even scope.

817
00:33:59,948 --> 00:34:02,690
And of course, not certainly at the release,

818
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:05,133
in any way competitive with other approaches

819
00:34:05,213 --> 00:34:07,054
at other studios that use even more assets.

820
00:34:07,635 --> 00:34:08,816
So with the Matthew method,

821
00:34:09,336 --> 00:34:11,378
we can get away with only six animations

822
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:14,521
which are all diagonals and requires no IK aiming

823
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:15,281
to stay on target.

824
00:34:16,183 --> 00:34:17,885
The way this works is, instead of capturing

825
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:20,789
the four cardinal directions, we capture back left

826
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:23,413
and front right as single assets,

827
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,957
and then the crossover angles of front and left,

828
00:34:27,018 --> 00:34:27,719
front left and back right.

829
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,044
The three front moving animations are put in one blend tree

830
00:34:31,104 --> 00:34:32,225
and the three back in another,

831
00:34:32,325 --> 00:34:34,047
and then a state machine sits above those,

832
00:34:34,528 --> 00:34:36,250
switching between the two as they're driven

833
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,672
by stick deflection of angle.

834
00:34:38,233 --> 00:34:40,315
There's a 10 degree overlap on those angles

835
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:43,539
that switch between the forward and the back

836
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:45,682
so that if someone's hanging out on that angle,

837
00:34:45,702 --> 00:34:47,103
you're not getting some ugly bounce, right?

838
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,622
So we're gonna look at those animations

839
00:34:49,663 --> 00:34:51,405
before we actually see what this looks like in game

840
00:34:51,445 --> 00:34:53,347
so that people have a better idea of what we're doing.

841
00:34:54,088 --> 00:34:56,090
So this is what we consider a forward animation,

842
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,974
which is, as you can see, 45 degrees forward right.

843
00:34:59,354 --> 00:35:00,636
The gate's pretty straightforward.

844
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:04,400
The character is aiming at the camera relative,

845
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,083
which is where the yellow arrow on the bottom represents.

846
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:10,740
Here's what we would consider forward right,

847
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,881
which is 135 degrees to the right.

848
00:35:13,382 --> 00:35:15,003
More than being a forward animation,

849
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:16,264
this is really just a sidestep

850
00:35:16,544 --> 00:35:19,046
where the left leg crosses in front of the right leg.

851
00:35:21,407 --> 00:35:22,528
Here is the back right,

852
00:35:22,628 --> 00:35:24,550
which is again that 135 degree angle,

853
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,012
but while also being a sidestep,

854
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:28,673
it's the right leg crossing in front

855
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:29,493
of the left leg this time.

856
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:32,847
Here's a pretty standard back run,

857
00:35:32,987 --> 00:35:35,292
but this time it's at 135 degrees to the left

858
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:37,457
and fairly straightforward back pedaling motion.

859
00:35:37,998 --> 00:35:38,980
I promise, even though it's not moving.

860
00:35:41,118 --> 00:35:43,819
Here's the back left, which is another sidestep,

861
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,499
moving at 45 degrees left.

862
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:47,680
And here it's the left leg crossing the right,

863
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,300
and then the inverse for the forward left,

864
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,521
which is right foot crosses in front of left.

865
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:53,981
So here's what it looks like in game.

866
00:35:55,502 --> 00:35:56,602
Six animations for the jog,

867
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:57,862
and then we'd have six more for the walk.

868
00:35:58,483 --> 00:36:01,023
And that gives us all of our combat movement for a character.

869
00:36:02,363 --> 00:36:04,184
Doing this takes a little bit of time getting used to

870
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,625
when directing the mocap and authoring the animations,

871
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,425
but once you wrap your head around it,

872
00:36:08,565 --> 00:36:11,726
you get everything you need for even less assets

873
00:36:11,746 --> 00:36:12,547
than what we had before.

874
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:14,727
And it's entirely animation driven

875
00:36:14,907 --> 00:36:16,128
by the animation and the poses,

876
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:18,888
so no IK tech is needed to keep them locked

877
00:36:18,948 --> 00:36:19,989
on that front reticle.

878
00:36:20,229 --> 00:36:21,309
We do have it for up and down,

879
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:24,550
but again, most of the time it's right in that sweet spot

880
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,070
and you're good to go.

881
00:36:27,514 --> 00:36:29,622
Okay, so since we're already talking about graphs,

882
00:36:29,642 --> 00:36:32,835
let's really just indulge our techie side completely.

883
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,943
Beyond the evolving animation graph improvements

884
00:36:35,983 --> 00:36:38,625
and additions, the big gamble for us on this project

885
00:36:39,086 --> 00:36:41,348
was going to be procedural, as inspired by

886
00:36:41,428 --> 00:36:44,390
David Rosen's animation boot camp talk a few years ago.

887
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:45,872
Check it out in the vault if you haven't seen it before.

888
00:36:46,352 --> 00:36:48,154
And what this meant specifically for us was

889
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:51,597
IK modifiers, as created by another ace animation programmer

890
00:36:51,757 --> 00:36:54,519
and dude lookalike, Rob Ripka.

891
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,622
And it really all started with Jumplands.

892
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:00,927
Jumping is of course a big part of our game.

893
00:37:01,348 --> 00:37:03,892
And jump lands can account for nearly 40 animations

894
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:04,513
per character.

895
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,297
Jump land stand, jump land walk, jog, sprint.

896
00:37:07,697 --> 00:37:09,981
Aiming jump lands in all directions, across all speeds.

897
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,745
For what is largely a functional animation,

898
00:37:12,865 --> 00:37:13,987
it can be a giant time sink.

899
00:37:15,088 --> 00:37:19,030
Looking around, some games might just play the jump land stand while moving to get the

900
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,272
compression of the land and just blend out of it sooner, but that still wasn't going

901
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:25,974
to meet with our overall visual quality needs by saying out of combat was what needed to

902
00:37:26,014 --> 00:37:26,475
look the best.

903
00:37:26,935 --> 00:37:29,316
So we decided to try our hand at procedural jump lands.

904
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:32,292
So here's a jump land in our game

905
00:37:32,373 --> 00:37:33,874
when you're standing still with a procedural.

906
00:37:34,355 --> 00:37:36,097
Everything that the body and head are doing

907
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:38,960
on the land is in fact procedural.

908
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:40,442
We do animate the arms

909
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:42,684
and they're exported as override animations.

910
00:37:43,405 --> 00:37:44,166
But under the hood,

911
00:37:44,546 --> 00:37:46,409
this is just the default idle animation

912
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:48,991
that you're seeing with arms only playing.

913
00:37:51,095 --> 00:37:53,016
And here's that same jump land while you're moving.

914
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:55,657
It uses the same arms override animation,

915
00:37:55,717 --> 00:37:56,797
but with an earlier blend out.

916
00:37:57,398 --> 00:37:59,238
But other than that, this is just the run animation

917
00:37:59,258 --> 00:38:00,159
that you're seeing when they land.

918
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:03,820
And this overall saved us about 30 animations per character.

919
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,001
Not to mention, it maintains full player control

920
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:09,222
and velocity of the character while you're landing,

921
00:38:09,522 --> 00:38:12,123
which of course design and us game feel nuts

922
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,263
just absolutely love.

923
00:38:15,324 --> 00:38:16,705
So how does this work?

924
00:38:17,721 --> 00:38:20,167
Well, I'm not Rob, I can't speak to the code underneath,

925
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:22,893
but I can show what he exposed to us

926
00:38:22,953 --> 00:38:24,517
and how to adjust the knobs and dials

927
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:26,421
so that we can manipulate what it does.

928
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:30,125
It starts with defining a set of curves,

929
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:31,565
or one curve specifically,

930
00:38:31,966 --> 00:38:33,146
and these are created in MotionBuilder.

931
00:38:33,727 --> 00:38:34,827
For the purpose of jump lands,

932
00:38:34,947 --> 00:38:37,769
we have ones defining how heavy we want that land to feel.

933
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:40,631
The curve will drive what the bones will ultimately do.

934
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:42,612
So in the light land at the top,

935
00:38:43,012 --> 00:38:44,953
the large value followed by a smaller value

936
00:38:44,993 --> 00:38:46,594
sort of represents a bit of a double bounce.

937
00:38:46,995 --> 00:38:48,636
For the heavy land, there's a large value

938
00:38:48,656 --> 00:38:50,357
that holds for a bit and then settles back

939
00:38:50,377 --> 00:38:51,918
without much of that double bounce,

940
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:54,359
and this gives a land that holds a bit before rising up.

941
00:38:57,495 --> 00:38:59,396
Then what we do is we set a control parameter

942
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:00,396
that we want to fire off.

943
00:39:00,536 --> 00:39:02,357
In this case, it's gonna be a bool,

944
00:39:02,377 --> 00:39:03,477
like round bool equals true.

945
00:39:04,538 --> 00:39:06,378
The function that I'm setting there

946
00:39:06,798 --> 00:39:07,879
is the motion builder file

947
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:09,299
containing those previous curves,

948
00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:11,840
and then the function float track is the curve itself.

949
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,401
And then you can see here,

950
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:15,541
we can adjust some global values for it

951
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:18,122
that are gonna be the length and output scale of the curve.

952
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:23,469
Next is where we start adding in the specific operations on each bone.

953
00:39:24,389 --> 00:39:27,771
First we'll set the axis that we want to modify the bone on,

954
00:39:27,931 --> 00:39:30,232
then the bone name, as you can see there, the hips.

955
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:34,135
Next up we can set a delay so that they don't all happen at the same time.

956
00:39:34,855 --> 00:39:38,077
Again, we can now set on a specific bone operation,

957
00:39:38,137 --> 00:39:40,719
the length and output scale, and then the offset.

958
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:45,682
And the offset can be in translation, scale, or rotation.

959
00:39:46,002 --> 00:39:47,644
We can also set the space as you see here,

960
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:51,166
which is model, which is T-pose,

961
00:39:51,686 --> 00:39:54,508
or bone, which is whatever pose they're in at the time.

962
00:39:55,231 --> 00:39:57,413
So instead of just walking through all this stuff,

963
00:39:57,433 --> 00:39:58,294
let's actually just make one.

964
00:39:59,215 --> 00:40:00,396
So this is what a jump looks like

965
00:40:00,436 --> 00:40:01,457
without any modifier on it.

966
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:03,299
Like you see, it's just a stand

967
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,861
with those wiggly arms going on,

968
00:40:05,241 --> 00:40:07,043
nothing too great feeling.

969
00:40:08,144 --> 00:40:10,707
Let's add that wide translation down on the hips,

970
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:11,728
right on impact.

971
00:40:11,768 --> 00:40:12,669
And you can see already,

972
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:14,931
all right, we're getting that curve

973
00:40:15,051 --> 00:40:16,212
as defined by the land heavy.

974
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:21,221
Then we can add some rotation forward in X on the spine

975
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:23,282
with a delay set in there to happen

976
00:40:23,662 --> 00:40:24,783
later than the transition.

977
00:40:24,843 --> 00:40:26,624
So we can break up that order of operations again

978
00:40:26,644 --> 00:40:27,285
that's really important.

979
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:29,927
Having these live update is really a must

980
00:40:30,007 --> 00:40:31,508
as there's going to be a lot of iteration

981
00:40:31,548 --> 00:40:34,170
that needs to happen and being able to quickly compare

982
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,071
and edit is really what's gonna be key

983
00:40:36,111 --> 00:40:36,891
in making this worthwhile.

984
00:40:38,374 --> 00:40:41,236
And about 15 operations later, we arrive at our jump lands.

985
00:40:42,097 --> 00:40:44,078
Obviously, creating these still takes some time

986
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:45,499
and iteration to get it right.

987
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:47,581
So the really big way that we win with these

988
00:40:47,661 --> 00:40:50,523
is that once we have a heavy and medium and light done,

989
00:40:50,943 --> 00:40:52,284
we can just add that to any character

990
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,485
and their jump lands are complete.

991
00:40:53,865 --> 00:40:55,386
We just author some of that wiggly arms,

992
00:40:55,406 --> 00:40:56,927
which of course takes hardly any time at all,

993
00:40:57,468 --> 00:40:59,649
and character is jumping and landing

994
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:01,791
and good to go right out of the box.

995
00:41:05,661 --> 00:41:07,241
The only time that we don't use that

996
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:08,582
is during long fall lands.

997
00:41:09,102 --> 00:41:10,582
There's no fall damage for agents,

998
00:41:11,122 --> 00:41:12,243
and they're gonna be locked in place

999
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:12,983
for a bit when they land,

1000
00:41:13,023 --> 00:41:14,183
so that means it's a perfect time

1001
00:41:14,203 --> 00:41:15,804
to add personality to the character.

1002
00:41:15,864 --> 00:41:18,564
So for Hollywood, who by his very namesake,

1003
00:41:19,004 --> 00:41:20,265
strikes a three-point landing,

1004
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:22,185
because how do you land in a Hollywood movie?

1005
00:41:22,845 --> 00:41:23,465
Three-point landing.

1006
00:41:24,906 --> 00:41:26,126
I swear he's the only one that we do that with.

1007
00:41:27,466 --> 00:41:28,727
It was at this point, oh, sorry,

1008
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,187
missed an important part.

1009
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,511
All right, it was at this point then that Rob said,

1010
00:41:37,691 --> 00:41:39,231
wait, I'm not done, I can do more.

1011
00:41:40,032 --> 00:41:43,173
He made it that when you toggle sprint when jogging,

1012
00:41:43,773 --> 00:41:46,055
a modifier plays that compresses that character a bit

1013
00:41:46,355 --> 00:41:48,936
on button press to give that feeling of pushing off

1014
00:41:48,976 --> 00:41:50,957
and exerting some force into speeding up.

1015
00:41:51,557 --> 00:41:53,298
Since this is layered as procedural

1016
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:54,798
on top of the sprint that's blended in,

1017
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,819
again, it's not gonna change the velocity

1018
00:41:56,859 --> 00:41:58,180
or give you a hitch or anything like that.

1019
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,701
It just makes it feel fluid

1020
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:01,101
while still having that weight of like,

1021
00:42:01,141 --> 00:42:02,202
yeah, I kicked into sprint.

1022
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,511
At which point then I fell madly in love with modifiers

1023
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:08,512
and they quickly became the Frank's Red Hot Sauce

1024
00:42:08,552 --> 00:42:09,432
of animation tech.

1025
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:13,854
First we added it to the out of combat

1026
00:42:13,894 --> 00:42:14,934
to combat transitions.

1027
00:42:15,215 --> 00:42:17,656
That blend to aim is only a couple of frames.

1028
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:20,457
So the modifier gives us a nice bit of follow through

1029
00:42:20,477 --> 00:42:22,458
and overlap on the character

1030
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,138
without delaying the combat responsiveness

1031
00:42:24,178 --> 00:42:26,459
of going directly into their aim suite.

1032
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,401
We contrast this with those bespoke animations we make

1033
00:42:29,441 --> 00:42:30,742
when transitioning out of combat.

1034
00:42:31,242 --> 00:42:34,183
And again, what this does is it matches our overall decision

1035
00:42:34,203 --> 00:42:36,504
to focus on out of combat animation.

1036
00:42:36,605 --> 00:42:39,886
Showing how they transition from combat to out of combat

1037
00:42:39,926 --> 00:42:41,327
has sort of become a fun little way of adding

1038
00:42:41,627 --> 00:42:44,248
just that little bit of personality to draw the attention

1039
00:42:44,288 --> 00:42:46,630
and focus back onto the character after combat.

1040
00:42:49,678 --> 00:42:52,600
Then we use them as combat move starts and stops.

1041
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,641
We have four cardinal starts and a single stop.

1042
00:42:56,061 --> 00:42:58,602
Since again, combat movement quickly just ramps up

1043
00:42:58,902 --> 00:43:00,382
to desired speed of the character.

1044
00:43:01,643 --> 00:43:03,704
What this does is this gives us a bit of a push off

1045
00:43:03,804 --> 00:43:06,244
like that jog to sprint transition does

1046
00:43:06,605 --> 00:43:09,186
and to settle like the out of combat to combat transition.

1047
00:43:09,926 --> 00:43:11,466
And then what's great about this is this is just

1048
00:43:11,626 --> 00:43:13,747
these five modifiers are shared across every character.

1049
00:43:14,507 --> 00:43:15,208
Everyone has it.

1050
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:16,948
We don't have to make unique ones for them.

1051
00:43:17,068 --> 00:43:18,569
We could if we wanted to, but again.

1052
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:20,991
combat isn't the focus where we spend a lot of time.

1053
00:43:22,973 --> 00:43:25,775
Weapon fires have also become a great place to use these.

1054
00:43:26,816 --> 00:43:28,197
And because as the library grows,

1055
00:43:28,257 --> 00:43:30,459
we can just add these to characters

1056
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:32,321
or quickly dupe one and edit it

1057
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:34,663
to get the unique fire per character.

1058
00:43:35,164 --> 00:43:37,526
What's also great about these is that they're easy to adjust

1059
00:43:37,726 --> 00:43:40,729
as the shot fire speeds are iterated on by design.

1060
00:43:40,789 --> 00:43:42,350
So instead of having to go back in

1061
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,371
and adjust an animation,

1062
00:43:43,411 --> 00:43:45,493
we can just play with that global output scale or.

1063
00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:48,891
or anything like that, and now weapon fires are good to go.

1064
00:43:52,513 --> 00:43:54,214
This also gives us additive hit reactions,

1065
00:43:54,334 --> 00:43:56,676
which you can see here compared to the larger hit reactions

1066
00:43:56,696 --> 00:43:58,597
that actually do interrupt them, like there.

1067
00:44:00,198 --> 00:44:02,199
And by the nature of the modifiers being procedural,

1068
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,061
it means they can work while the character is standing still,

1069
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:07,382
moving, crouching, mandaling, jumping, whatever.

1070
00:44:07,502 --> 00:44:08,743
It doesn't matter what state they're in,

1071
00:44:08,763 --> 00:44:10,885
they're still gonna play the hit reaction.

1072
00:44:11,205 --> 00:44:13,466
And of course, then we can also use these on the player

1073
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:14,987
without interrupting the player control.

1074
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,293
Then we got the ability to scale bones with the modifiers.

1075
00:44:21,453 --> 00:44:23,835
So I added some squash and stretch to the agents

1076
00:44:23,855 --> 00:44:24,536
when they swap out.

1077
00:44:24,556 --> 00:44:26,478
You can see it easiest on hard tack where he kind of,

1078
00:44:26,758 --> 00:44:29,180
bloop, which was pretty fun.

1079
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:30,502
And again, that way,

1080
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:32,764
swapping no longer required an animation.

1081
00:44:32,804 --> 00:44:34,806
So as you're running through, swap to the character,

1082
00:44:34,866 --> 00:44:37,668
the next one comes in, fluid, responsive,

1083
00:44:37,949 --> 00:44:38,950
we're not interrupting anything.

1084
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,554
At which point then we can get really silly

1085
00:44:42,635 --> 00:44:44,541
and just add procedural squash and stretch

1086
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:46,547
to anything in the game that has a rig,

1087
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,433
because why the hell not?

1088
00:44:52,194 --> 00:44:54,736
Okay, so finally, the last big hurdle

1089
00:44:54,796 --> 00:44:58,920
that we needed to solve was facial animation.

1090
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,722
The tech solutions and expectations

1091
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:04,284
that are out there with facial are, of course, incredible.

1092
00:45:04,704 --> 00:45:06,946
And while we definitely wanted higher quality animation

1093
00:45:06,986 --> 00:45:08,387
than previous games at the studio,

1094
00:45:08,828 --> 00:45:11,049
investing in facial capture or lots of custom

1095
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:13,151
hand-keying animations just wasn't gonna work

1096
00:45:13,191 --> 00:45:13,992
on so many characters.

1097
00:45:14,052 --> 00:45:17,054
So again, it seemed here like leaning into style

1098
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:18,776
was going to be what made the most sense.

1099
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,801
What this meant specifically was focusing on strong,

1100
00:45:22,901 --> 00:45:25,562
emotive personality expressions like this iconic

1101
00:45:25,582 --> 00:45:27,502
Glen Keane expression she created for Tangled.

1102
00:45:28,343 --> 00:45:30,844
We would try to hit poses like those as much as we could

1103
00:45:30,864 --> 00:45:32,965
and then just sort of animate within those.

1104
00:45:34,554 --> 00:45:36,656
Specifically, what we would then do is,

1105
00:45:37,297 --> 00:45:39,379
this meant expression changes are what really

1106
00:45:39,399 --> 00:45:41,001
just take the most amount of time to sell, right?

1107
00:45:41,902 --> 00:45:43,844
On a physicality and emotional level,

1108
00:45:43,864 --> 00:45:45,946
those are hard and iterative.

1109
00:45:46,006 --> 00:45:47,688
So we just didn't have the bandwidth

1110
00:45:47,908 --> 00:45:49,850
or as much as we might have the desire for it,

1111
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,232
not necessarily the need.

1112
00:45:52,033 --> 00:45:56,517
So it was best to just sort of make a scrunchie face like in the top

1113
00:45:56,597 --> 00:46:02,082
second left picture there to sell that contrast of changing from one emotion to another and

1114
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:09,228
this was great because it also keeps it consistent with our extraordinary style of the strong personality poses carried by some of a

1115
00:46:09,568 --> 00:46:12,511
more clean smear mentality between them.

1116
00:46:15,094 --> 00:46:20,176
We were also cool with the fact that procedural mouths would be okay because people can deal

1117
00:46:20,196 --> 00:46:20,796
with that really.

1118
00:46:20,856 --> 00:46:26,359
It's the dead eyes and expressions that are going to make people go, that character doesn't

1119
00:46:26,399 --> 00:46:26,779
feel right.

1120
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:32,201
If we can make sure that the eyes feel alive, the expression feels alive, then we'll be

1121
00:46:32,241 --> 00:46:34,402
okay with procedural mouth and most people probably will be too.

1122
00:46:35,922 --> 00:46:40,564
So what this did was it meant we were going to lean into the seven universal emotions.

1123
00:46:41,636 --> 00:46:46,639
This is anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and contempt.

1124
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,941
Every human in the world has these things.

1125
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:53,363
And while each expression has very specific traits

1126
00:46:53,403 --> 00:46:55,404
that you need for those to be able to read by everyone,

1127
00:46:56,585 --> 00:46:58,746
everyone sort of has their own unique version and take on it.

1128
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,872
So this is what we did for each character as well.

1129
00:47:02,673 --> 00:47:04,275
And much like defining their music,

1130
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:06,298
figuring out, taking the time to really figure out

1131
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:07,459
which actors are characters,

1132
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,523
parallel our characters' own personalities

1133
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:13,527
meant we had another really great, quick touchstone

1134
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:15,990
for finding and communicating performances

1135
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,352
when working together on the team.

1136
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,102
These expressions, along with the Anisoft Visemes,

1137
00:47:22,142 --> 00:47:23,643
were all outsourced to animators

1138
00:47:23,683 --> 00:47:24,723
with a past working in film.

1139
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:27,765
The reference expression picture is what we gave them

1140
00:47:27,905 --> 00:47:28,846
as their initial direction,

1141
00:47:29,426 --> 00:47:31,688
and what they gave us back were these solid building blocks

1142
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:34,729
that we were able to use by the rest of the team

1143
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,290
that were handcrafted,

1144
00:47:36,711 --> 00:47:38,832
essentially animation-driven blend shapes,

1145
00:47:39,252 --> 00:47:40,473
as demoed here by a tool

1146
00:47:40,853 --> 00:47:42,954
written by our animation tech lead, Evan Cox.

1147
00:47:43,795 --> 00:47:46,177
And with these, what we can do is we can bring also

1148
00:47:46,257 --> 00:47:48,598
the Anisoft generated lip sync animation

1149
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:51,240
into getFirstPass lip sync for anything that requires.

1150
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,943
So very quickly, we can start to add facial animation.

1151
00:47:55,483 --> 00:47:58,325
So outside of a few specific animations shown here,

1152
00:47:58,345 --> 00:47:59,846
which are idle, fidgets, emotes,

1153
00:48:00,226 --> 00:48:01,828
mayhem ability, and front vehicle entry.

1154
00:48:02,868 --> 00:48:05,849
where the player can easily move around and look

1155
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:08,290
and want to see that the face is matching the motion.

1156
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:10,771
Everything else is authored with just no face.

1157
00:48:11,631 --> 00:48:14,912
And we let a default expression play underneath

1158
00:48:15,032 --> 00:48:16,653
so that when you're running and jumping

1159
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:17,613
and all of that good stuff,

1160
00:48:17,893 --> 00:48:20,434
what you're seeing is that default expression under there.

1161
00:48:21,054 --> 00:48:22,695
Which meant it became really important

1162
00:48:22,835 --> 00:48:24,375
and we created an eighth pose,

1163
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:27,837
which you can see here as demoed by our lead bad guy,

1164
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,378
Dr. Babylon at the end, the personality pose.

1165
00:48:31,278 --> 00:48:33,360
And this would be the one that lives underneath.

1166
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,222
It could be separate from the normal expressions

1167
00:48:35,502 --> 00:48:37,464
or even a variation of the expressions.

1168
00:48:38,244 --> 00:48:40,026
It was also then at this point that we decided,

1169
00:48:40,046 --> 00:48:41,768
well, if we're already making some changes to it,

1170
00:48:42,368 --> 00:48:44,390
it would be great if we could break up the sliders

1171
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:47,533
to have the full expression, eyes only and mouth only.

1172
00:48:48,494 --> 00:48:52,637
And this was using Scott McCloud's approach to facial expressions as sort of inspiration,

1173
00:48:52,657 --> 00:48:57,320
in that being able to mix and match the eyes and mouths of different expressions and even

1174
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:04,526
visemes would mean that we could quickly create new combined expressions to give extra depth

1175
00:49:04,706 --> 00:49:06,868
and variety to the characters pretty quickly.

1176
00:49:09,345 --> 00:49:12,626
So, with Fortune, getting her to reach

1177
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:15,847
her full Rihanna potential took nearly no time at all.

1178
00:49:16,427 --> 00:49:18,487
With those static expressions now crafted

1179
00:49:18,567 --> 00:49:19,707
and implemented in the tool,

1180
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,528
it seemed like being able to leverage them software side

1181
00:49:23,548 --> 00:49:25,189
was only really gonna be half a measure.

1182
00:49:25,569 --> 00:49:27,509
We would want to maybe see some of these expressions

1183
00:49:27,629 --> 00:49:28,570
in life, in game.

1184
00:49:29,811 --> 00:49:36,834
So we had our facial outsourcing gurus give us a single living expression to keep the face alive for each character.

1185
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:44,077
Again, having them focus on it meant that it would meet a consistent higher quality than if we tried to rush it internally,

1186
00:49:44,457 --> 00:49:47,918
because balanced against gameplay needs, this just wasn't as important.

1187
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:53,811
Then what we can do is we can copy multiple takes

1188
00:49:54,031 --> 00:49:56,113
of that animation in MotionBuilder

1189
00:49:56,514 --> 00:49:58,336
and drop each one of their unique expressions

1190
00:49:58,396 --> 00:50:00,678
on a layer over it, and now we have

1191
00:50:00,818 --> 00:50:02,640
all of those eight expressions alive

1192
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,522
and at a fairly consistent quality level.

1193
00:50:06,785 --> 00:50:09,328
It's at that point that we have a system

1194
00:50:09,748 --> 00:50:12,111
to call all of those expressions in the game.

1195
00:50:12,882 --> 00:50:15,023
Is the agent gonna be happy to pick up an object?

1196
00:50:15,063 --> 00:50:16,084
Play their happy expression.

1197
00:50:16,544 --> 00:50:18,305
Are they angry that Legion is around?

1198
00:50:18,425 --> 00:50:19,665
Play that angry expression.

1199
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,186
Or did they just witness something weird?

1200
00:50:21,846 --> 00:50:23,807
Drop that disgusted expression on them.

1201
00:50:24,908 --> 00:50:26,349
Fear even when they're at low health, right?

1202
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:29,570
Facial animation really I feel like is something

1203
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,011
where it's the definition of solving something

1204
00:50:32,091 --> 00:50:34,913
with a system and style, and then leveraging that

1205
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:38,074
in as many places as possible across the game.

1206
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:44,261
All right, so after defining the characters,

1207
00:50:44,621 --> 00:50:46,302
the style, the quality, and tech,

1208
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:49,025
we're finally able at that point to extrapolate

1209
00:50:49,105 --> 00:50:50,967
just how many of these damn characters can we make.

1210
00:50:52,728 --> 00:50:54,130
What we did is we ended up with just shy

1211
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,532
of 100 animations per player character.

1212
00:50:57,953 --> 00:51:00,676
And this is all of them, copied from character Excel doc,

1213
00:51:00,736 --> 00:51:03,438
because I know everyone in here loves to animate

1214
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:04,820
in Excel sometimes, don't lie.

1215
00:51:07,126 --> 00:51:09,907
Specifically, something that we tracked and defined here

1216
00:51:09,927 --> 00:51:12,407
is which assets can be shared from one character to another.

1217
00:51:13,388 --> 00:51:15,208
And this is managed by having all of our character

1218
00:51:15,248 --> 00:51:16,908
animation sets live within a hierarchy.

1219
00:51:16,969 --> 00:51:19,169
So as long as one character is complete,

1220
00:51:19,529 --> 00:51:20,870
if everyone else is underneath them,

1221
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:23,310
every character will inherit those animations,

1222
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:26,071
allowing design to start testing that character right away,

1223
00:51:26,171 --> 00:51:28,431
and then we can just plug and play in animations as needed.

1224
00:51:28,812 --> 00:51:31,052
So with weapon holds, characters that are

1225
00:51:31,853 --> 00:51:33,255
Large male, underslung, cool.

1226
00:51:33,275 --> 00:51:34,517
If you want another large male underslung,

1227
00:51:34,697 --> 00:51:36,139
you've got complete access to one.

1228
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,404
We'll just start plugging in stuff as it's necessary.

1229
00:51:40,586 --> 00:51:43,027
We also call out here which things will be animated

1230
00:51:43,087 --> 00:51:44,528
internally versus externally.

1231
00:51:45,048 --> 00:51:47,289
A lot of those ordinary classified movements are

1232
00:51:47,749 --> 00:51:50,371
and can be outsourced, including jog starts and turns.

1233
00:51:50,871 --> 00:51:53,832
Since the mocap really gives us a solid base and direction

1234
00:51:53,892 --> 00:51:56,073
and our metrics are so well defined and precise,

1235
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,474
communicating our needs to external studios

1236
00:51:58,554 --> 00:51:59,615
is relatively straightforward,

1237
00:51:59,915 --> 00:52:01,396
as well as using the one sheets to say,

1238
00:52:01,456 --> 00:52:03,076
and this is their personality on top of it.

1239
00:52:03,934 --> 00:52:05,614
Sure, we still have to do a final polish pass

1240
00:52:05,714 --> 00:52:07,095
on all of those being implemented,

1241
00:52:07,435 --> 00:52:09,336
but what it does is it helps to make time

1242
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,237
for us to focus early on on nailing

1243
00:52:11,257 --> 00:52:13,638
those extraordinary personality-driven animations

1244
00:52:13,898 --> 00:52:16,799
while still getting some runway laid

1245
00:52:16,879 --> 00:52:18,260
for the rest of their suite.

1246
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,842
So after leveraging style, sharing, outsourcing, and tech,

1247
00:52:23,922 --> 00:52:25,163
100% unique characters are estimated

1248
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:26,843
to take about 10 weeks internally

1249
00:52:26,923 --> 00:52:29,304
to create and implement all animations.

1250
00:52:30,005 --> 00:52:32,266
Shared weapons holds can save us five weeks.

1251
00:52:33,169 --> 00:52:34,790
Three weeks of polish and iteration

1252
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,131
are then added to each character

1253
00:52:36,151 --> 00:52:39,093
so that we can react to any needed design changes

1254
00:52:39,153 --> 00:52:40,534
or iterations or playtest feedback.

1255
00:52:42,055 --> 00:52:43,756
And this is how many characters we have in total.

1256
00:52:44,397 --> 00:52:45,998
Beyond the 12 playable characters,

1257
00:52:46,078 --> 00:52:47,019
the four that we've shown today

1258
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:48,560
and the remaining silhouettes that you can see,

1259
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,002
we have 10 enemy troopers, seven unique NPC,

1260
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:53,283
and multiple bosses.

1261
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:56,246
And I cannot stress important enough

1262
00:52:57,226 --> 00:52:59,068
how great it's been to have this diversity

1263
00:52:59,188 --> 00:53:00,529
of all these characters on the team

1264
00:53:00,569 --> 00:53:02,550
by us being able to leverage a lot of these things.

1265
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,202
Bringing the characters and the animation process

1266
00:53:07,262 --> 00:53:09,924
to life on this game has required for me

1267
00:53:09,984 --> 00:53:12,867
the perfect mix of art, design, and tech,

1268
00:53:13,347 --> 00:53:17,070
which really speaks to the heart of game animation

1269
00:53:17,131 --> 00:53:17,571
as I see it.

1270
00:53:18,312 --> 00:53:21,074
Taking the time to fully define the character's style,

1271
00:53:21,234 --> 00:53:23,416
quality, and tech up front has allowed us

1272
00:53:23,476 --> 00:53:25,598
to fully realize what I saw in my head

1273
00:53:25,658 --> 00:53:26,679
when I started on the game.

1274
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,301
And moving forward, it's given us

1275
00:53:29,361 --> 00:53:30,802
an amazing foundation to build upon.

1276
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,949
I hope you've all been inspired by our techniques,

1277
00:53:34,049 --> 00:53:36,610
and I can't wait for everyone to not only see more

1278
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,690
of the characters that we've created,

1279
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:38,750
but actually get to play it

1280
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:40,831
when we release the game later this year.

1281
00:53:41,532 --> 00:53:43,032
I personally could not be prouder

1282
00:53:43,172 --> 00:53:46,113
of what our animation team and our team has accomplished

1283
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,234
with everything that we've created here.

1284
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,815
Speaking of which, if you'd like to hear more

1285
00:53:52,835 --> 00:53:54,777
about the art style on Agents of Mayhem,

1286
00:53:55,077 --> 00:53:58,439
there are two more talks today in West Room Hall 2002.

1287
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,401
At two o'clock, we have senior VFX artist, Brianna Lindsey.

1288
00:54:01,681 --> 00:54:03,183
She'll be speaking about how VFX

1289
00:54:03,643 --> 00:54:04,884
approaches the art style of the game.

1290
00:54:05,384 --> 00:54:07,826
And at 3.30, we have principal artist, James Taylor,

1291
00:54:07,886 --> 00:54:09,927
who will be speaking about physically-based

1292
00:54:10,207 --> 00:54:12,209
material rendering in a stylized game.

1293
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:14,611
Thank you all for listening.

1294
00:54:15,371 --> 00:54:17,152
We've got about six minutes for questions,

1295
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:17,753
if anyone has any.

1296
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,363
Going once, going twice.

1297
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:35,207
Yeah, go ahead, there's mics in the middle

1298
00:54:35,227 --> 00:54:36,308
if anyone wants to jump up.

1299
00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:38,750
I saw a hand.

1300
00:54:40,131 --> 00:54:42,834
All right, well if you, oh, go ahead.

1301
00:54:43,174 --> 00:54:44,876
How many unique blend trees do you have

1302
00:54:45,056 --> 00:54:46,477
or just for locomotion?

1303
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:53,022
Oh man, so what we do is we've got essentially one monster graph that we're using for all

1304
00:54:53,042 --> 00:54:53,542
the characters.

1305
00:54:54,742 --> 00:54:59,244
And we then layer in between all of them.

1306
00:55:00,084 --> 00:55:01,024
It's gotten pretty beefy.

1307
00:55:01,204 --> 00:55:06,106
What started on early with every animator being able to just jump in and like, hey,

1308
00:55:06,146 --> 00:55:10,647
I need this specific thing for this character, so let me add a new node and a unique transition,

1309
00:55:11,707 --> 00:55:13,808
started to break things as stuff got really interconnected.

1310
00:55:13,908 --> 00:55:16,428
So at this point, we've got like two people that own it.

1311
00:55:17,089 --> 00:55:21,230
um, and uh, I'll go in and I'll test a thing and I'll be like, hey, I want to do this like

1312
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:26,011
additive arm only pull out a thing and they, I was like, I think it goes here. I'll shelve

1313
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,972
it in Perforce, they'll take it out and go no, no, no, no, no, you don't want it there, you

1314
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:32,634
actually want it over here. Um, but at least I can get the, the functionality of it going. So

1315
00:55:33,034 --> 00:55:35,535
as to how deep it goes, it's, it's pretty gross. We needed to uh,

1316
00:55:36,535 --> 00:55:39,556
actually create a second one just for pedestrians in the game that's just one flat

1317
00:55:40,517 --> 00:55:43,458
uh... graph so that uh... each pedestrian wasn't calling

1318
00:55:43,918 --> 00:55:44,699
each one of these

1319
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:48,421
monster graphs that then had to go like multiple layer deeps every time they like got

1320
00:55:48,441 --> 00:55:49,281
stumbled or something right

1321
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:52,162
so uh... I can't give you the specifics of that but it's a lot

1322
00:55:56,529 --> 00:56:01,230
Who came up with those like character sheets was that done in like concept early on or as you guys were animating and working?

1323
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:04,811
Were those being developed along the way those were developed pretty early on?

1324
00:56:05,231 --> 00:56:08,471
So I'd done a talk here at GDC a couple years ago at the animation boot camp

1325
00:56:09,212 --> 00:56:12,713
Where I developed some of the ideas behind that on shadow of Mordor

1326
00:56:13,793 --> 00:56:15,533
And so when I started on this project

1327
00:56:16,233 --> 00:56:20,695
They had the traditional thing of here's some concept art and here is a giant wall of text that writers

1328
00:56:20,715 --> 00:56:22,915
just went just went ham on and

1329
00:56:24,196 --> 00:56:26,018
Very quickly, I go, that's a lot to read.

1330
00:56:26,158 --> 00:56:27,580
And when you've got a lot of characters

1331
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,682
that you're trying to understand,

1332
00:56:29,102 --> 00:56:30,284
it's what are the core things?

1333
00:56:30,344 --> 00:56:31,185
What's important?

1334
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:32,267
What do we need to communicate?

1335
00:56:32,627 --> 00:56:35,090
And so I spent a lot of time early on going,

1336
00:56:35,131 --> 00:56:36,252
okay, what are we doing?

1337
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:37,934
And working with writers and designers

1338
00:56:37,974 --> 00:56:40,458
and trying to say, what are you trying to communicate?

1339
00:56:40,518 --> 00:56:41,279
What is the system?

1340
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,201
do you feel like this visual approach that I'm creating is correct?

1341
00:56:44,221 --> 00:56:48,584
So they're certainly one of my babies and it's something that I still maintain

1342
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:51,286
and sometimes other people go, oh, I'm going to update it over here.

1343
00:56:51,306 --> 00:56:51,567
No, no, no.

1344
00:56:51,587 --> 00:56:54,529
So it needs to, let's, let's keep this consistent because especially with

1345
00:56:54,629 --> 00:56:59,572
outsourcing, when we bring in somebody quickly to do a character piece, I can

1346
00:56:59,612 --> 00:57:03,375
send them that along with some of their music and the expression sheet, have a

1347
00:57:03,455 --> 00:57:07,138
quick Skype call with them to be like, this is who the character is and they,

1348
00:57:07,278 --> 00:57:09,499
and they can grok it pretty quickly, which is really important.

1349
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:12,648
Hey.

1350
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:13,710
Can you hear me?

1351
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:14,491
Yeah.

1352
00:57:14,672 --> 00:57:17,176
Did you guys end up splitting the animations, the upper,

1353
00:57:17,256 --> 00:57:21,604
lower sort of locomotion, and then any kind of upper body

1354
00:57:21,664 --> 00:57:23,026
actions like shooting, et cetera?

1355
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,543
We do have a couple upper body versus lower body reload.

1356
00:57:28,123 --> 00:57:30,925
We do a stand reload version, so we can get the hips and stuff.

1357
00:57:30,945 --> 00:57:33,127
And then we also just do an upper body as well,

1358
00:57:33,687 --> 00:57:35,288
so that you can reload while you're running.

1359
00:57:35,949 --> 00:57:39,512
Some of the special abilities, if it doesn't feel right

1360
00:57:39,592 --> 00:57:41,853
to cancel the movement to do an attack,

1361
00:57:41,873 --> 00:57:43,074
and it's something you want to be able to do

1362
00:57:44,075 --> 00:57:46,317
while you're moving, we also create an upper body for that.

1363
00:57:46,977 --> 00:57:48,418
But those are about the only times, right?

1364
00:57:48,438 --> 00:57:50,420
And were you like splitting them straight out,

1365
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,621
or was it like an additive on top?

1366
00:57:52,481 --> 00:58:07,147
It's just a straight up override. We do have additive, so there are a couple characters where we will do additive, but we'll do that and then we do have some eye case, like spine bending stuff that we can do to say, okay, if this is what the hip's doing, then we want you to orient and be aware of that.

1367
00:58:07,207 --> 00:58:09,048
Thanks.

1368
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:12,209
Similar question about the procedural jump landing.

1369
00:58:12,429 --> 00:58:13,310
Yeah.

1370
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:20,653
I assume you did some tests with additive animation versus the procedural landing. Can you talk about like pros and cons using one or the other?

1371
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:25,400
Yeah, so with the additive going on, it was something that they'd kind of been doing on the side.

1372
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:31,962
And with the procedural, it was something that having seen it a couple years before and having talked to David,

1373
00:58:31,982 --> 00:58:36,664
it was kind of always my head, oh, this would feel so good and I really want to learn about this more.

1374
00:58:36,724 --> 00:58:42,646
So we kind of were developing them in tandem and the procedural came on a lot earlier.

1375
00:58:44,849 --> 00:58:49,991
Once we then started to wrap our minds around all the different places that we could leverage this in different avenues,

1376
00:58:50,391 --> 00:58:54,293
we just really leaned into that heavy and went from there.

1377
00:58:54,313 --> 00:58:55,373
Yeah, it looks cool.

1378
00:58:55,773 --> 00:58:57,234
Awesome, thank you. I'll let Rob know.

1379
00:58:59,330 --> 00:58:59,450
Hi.

1380
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:02,011
Hi, I was just wondering if the movement in the world

1381
00:59:02,031 --> 00:59:04,112
of the character is driven by the animation itself

1382
00:59:04,232 --> 00:59:06,973
or if it's a physics based movement in the world.

1383
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:10,394
Yeah, so out of combat is entirely animation driven,

1384
00:59:11,095 --> 00:59:12,595
which is why it was really important early on

1385
00:59:12,635 --> 00:59:15,937
for us to nail down, okay, at what frame do you turn by?

1386
00:59:16,077 --> 00:59:17,297
At what frame are you up to speed?

1387
00:59:17,357 --> 00:59:18,738
Because we want that consistency

1388
00:59:18,758 --> 00:59:20,999
and it's really easy with animation driven movement

1389
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:23,100
to get a little sloppy with that

1390
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,420
and not have it feel consistent.

1391
00:59:25,121 --> 00:59:27,221
So we locked that out early for in combat.

1392
00:59:28,002 --> 00:59:29,284
it is 100% physics driven.

1393
00:59:29,464 --> 00:59:31,186
You know, they want that ability

1394
00:59:31,206 --> 00:59:32,227
that if somebody's shooting at me,

1395
00:59:32,247 --> 00:59:33,028
I want to move out of the way

1396
00:59:33,068 --> 00:59:35,350
and not have to worry about a nice, pretty animation.

1397
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,193
So we let that get right up to speed

1398
00:59:38,233 --> 00:59:40,156
and just blend between whatever the walk speed is

1399
00:59:40,236 --> 00:59:41,617
up through the run speed.

1400
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:43,940
And then, yeah, we use that procedural.

1401
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,642
So we at least get that little bit of depth

1402
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:47,964
that every animator wants to show that kind of push off

1403
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:48,845
and transition between them.

1404
00:59:50,521 --> 00:59:52,603
Cool, I think, oh, one last question, time for one.

1405
00:59:53,344 --> 00:59:53,625
Thank you.

1406
00:59:54,426 --> 00:59:57,009
I saw you had this root node under each character,

1407
00:59:57,029 --> 00:59:59,391
so I wanted to ask how did you keep it consistent

1408
00:59:59,411 --> 01:00:02,735
between characters, and how were you animating

1409
01:00:03,176 --> 01:00:04,998
orientation of that node?

1410
01:00:05,298 --> 01:00:05,658
Basically.

1411
01:00:06,419 --> 01:00:08,621
How did you make animators' life easier?

1412
01:00:08,662 --> 01:00:10,223
Did you automate this stuff somehow,

1413
01:00:10,383 --> 01:00:11,584
or did you just hand-key it?

1414
01:00:12,005 --> 01:00:13,767
Yeah, so in MotionBuilder, we just

1415
01:00:13,807 --> 01:00:17,991
have a tool that will align it right underneath the hips

1416
01:00:18,351 --> 01:00:18,952
throughout all of it.

1417
01:00:19,092 --> 01:00:20,153
And then we'll check that.

1418
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:21,554
And then usually it's like, OK, that

1419
01:00:21,594 --> 01:00:22,896
doesn't look great with the camera.

1420
01:00:22,936 --> 01:00:24,177
And we'll make some adjustments there.

1421
01:00:24,577 --> 01:00:25,538
But at least we can do that.

1422
01:00:26,078 --> 01:00:27,119
to get a really quick base.

1423
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,539
And then we also have a tool in Motion Blur

1424
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:30,879
that allows you to save the offset

1425
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,360
from any bone to another bone.

1426
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:34,740
So once you create a character pose and you feel,

1427
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,941
ah, actually I like it when the run's a little bit forward

1428
01:00:36,981 --> 01:00:38,261
or back from it or whatever,

1429
01:00:38,961 --> 01:00:40,982
we'll save that offset as a pose list

1430
01:00:41,042 --> 01:00:43,242
and then you can share that to the network

1431
01:00:43,282 --> 01:00:44,522
and every animator can pull that down

1432
01:00:44,562 --> 01:00:45,983
to make sure that that stuff's consistent in game.

1433
01:00:46,003 --> 01:00:47,643
All right, everyone, thank you.

1434
01:00:47,723 --> 01:00:48,643
If you have any other questions,

1435
01:00:48,963 --> 01:00:50,004
you can meet me up here afterwards

1436
01:00:50,044 --> 01:00:53,044
or we can go to the wrap-up room.

1437
01:00:53,084 --> 01:00:54,064
Thanks for attending.

1438
01:00:54,104 --> 01:00:54,885
Have a good GDC.

1439
01:00:54,925 --> 01:00:55,185
Thank you.
