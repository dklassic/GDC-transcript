1
00:00:04,453 --> 00:00:05,753
Please welcome to the stage,

2
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:08,695
Director of the Game Developers Conference,

3
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:10,936
Jamil Molodina.

4
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:21,981
Good morning.

5
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:25,903
Many of you will have a lot in common with our next speaker

6
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:28,604
as he started out as a game developer himself.

7
00:00:29,643 --> 00:00:32,825
If you've played any of the Kirby, Earthbound or Smash

8
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:36,867
Brothers games, you've already met his inner self. Yet his

9
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:40,008
vision of the future propelled him up the chain of command,

10
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:44,511
landing him at the highest level of the video game industry. We

11
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:48,013
are also particularly appreciative that he will be

12
00:00:48,073 --> 00:00:51,595
delivering his keynote in English and with a sore throat.

13
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:57,216
Please join me in welcoming the top man at Nintendo Worldwide,

14
00:00:57,997 --> 00:01:00,057
President Satoru Iwata.

15
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:17,805
Thank you very much, Jameel.

16
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:26,464
On my business card, I am a corporate president.

17
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,226
In my mind, I am a game developer.

18
00:01:31,246 --> 00:01:33,787
But in my heart, I am a gamer.

19
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:47,113
Today, I'd like to speak to you from my heart about our jobs

20
00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:48,714
and about our industry.

21
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:53,893
I remember the first video game I ever played.

22
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:56,535
It was Pong, and I loved it.

23
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:02,038
By the time I was in high school,

24
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:05,620
I was the first person in my class

25
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,182
to buy an early Hewlett-Packard pocket calculator.

26
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:19,848
I think I was one of the original early adopters.

27
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:25,404
But where most people use their calculators

28
00:02:25,464 --> 00:02:30,726
for higher mathematics, I use mine to program video games.

29
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:35,748
My first creation was a baseball game.

30
00:02:37,808 --> 00:02:41,190
I don't think anyone can say it has bad graphics,

31
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,250
because it has no graphics.

32
00:02:45,971 --> 00:02:49,413
Gameplay was represented only by numbers.

33
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:58,987
But when I saw my friends playing that game and having fun, it made me feel proud.

34
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:05,651
To me, this was a source of energy and passion.

35
00:03:07,913 --> 00:03:15,037
As that passion for games began to blossom, I think my life course was set.

36
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:18,800
In 1978.

37
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:24,007
I entered the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

38
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:28,951
I would have loved to study video game programming,

39
00:03:29,552 --> 00:03:32,114
but no one was teaching it then.

40
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:39,200
So I went to classes on engineering and early computer

41
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,700
science.

42
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:46,606
But after class, when my friends went back to their rooms

43
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:47,166
to study.

44
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:52,925
I took off on my motorcycle for one retail store in Tokyo.

45
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:59,787
This was the first store to have the department entirely

46
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:02,108
dedicated to personal computers.

47
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:08,090
That was my hangout, and I was not alone.

48
00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:13,952
There were others there who also looked at those early computers

49
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:16,633
and thought the same thing I did.

50
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:20,487
How could we play games on them?

51
00:04:23,588 --> 00:04:26,409
We became friends, formed a club,

52
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,831
and soon rented an apartment in the Akihabara district

53
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:36,993
of Tokyo, where we began designing our own games.

54
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:42,775
We walked until midnight or later every night,

55
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:44,215
and that

56
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:50,431
Group of Friends is what became the company known today as HAL.

57
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:59,735
The name came from the computer in the movie, 2001 Space Odyssey, HAL.

58
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:06,278
We thought that name was very cool.

59
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:11,040
Also, this is what I looked like back then.

60
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:17,157
Thank you.

61
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:22,379
Like all game creators, I was extremely cool too,

62
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:23,139
don't you think?

63
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:34,022
So I don't really remember how, but I

64
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:36,743
managed to keep up with my classwork

65
00:05:37,343 --> 00:05:39,404
and graduated from the Institute.

66
00:05:40,602 --> 00:05:43,442
But when it came time to take a job,

67
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:47,183
I had the distinction of joining the smallest

68
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:51,444
company of any graduate in my class.

69
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:57,845
I left to become only the fifth full-time employee of HAL.

70
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:03,367
And when I told my father this, you can imagine,

71
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:08,348
it was not the happiest moment in the history of my family.

72
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:17,435
People sometimes ask me what I did when I was hired at HAL.

73
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:25,599
Well, the answer is that I was a programmer, and an engineer,

74
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,221
and a designer, and I marketed our games.

75
00:06:31,702 --> 00:06:36,304
I also ordered a lot of takeout food, and I helped clean up.

76
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:39,726
And it was all great fun.

77
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:48,203
Perhaps the biggest moment in the history of HAL came when we

78
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:53,265
heard the rumor that Nintendo has developed a machine capable

79
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:58,827
of incredible new graphics, the Famicom, or NES, as it was

80
00:06:58,907 --> 00:07:00,768
called here in the States.

81
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:07,270
We knew that this machine was for us.

82
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:13,732
So we used every contact we could to get a meeting with Nintendo,

83
00:07:14,913 --> 00:07:19,456
sure that one of our idea would became an instant hit.

84
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:26,420
Yes, Nintendo did hire us, but not to amaze the world

85
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,242
with one of our projects.

86
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:33,405
Instead, they told us to fix one of their projects,

87
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,568
a game that had seriously fallen behind schedule.

88
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,593
Instead of creating a game, we repaired a game.

89
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:49,678
And it eventually was released as NES pinball.

90
00:07:57,263 --> 00:08:01,767
That experience taught us that even artists must know the

91
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:03,708
business side of game development.

92
00:08:05,342 --> 00:08:08,143
After all, if a game never comes to market,

93
00:08:08,743 --> 00:08:12,685
there is very little chance of it making any money.

94
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:20,789
Working in those days was also instructive in another way.

95
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,692
Because the graphics were so primitive by today's standards,

96
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:31,394
we asked ourselves how we could spur the player's imagination.

97
00:08:32,406 --> 00:08:35,907
as a substitute for what we couldn't display on the screen.

98
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:38,809
Think about this.

99
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,810
Someday, our games won't look any better.

100
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,711
What will we do then?

101
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:49,333
Well, our work was satisfactory enough

102
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:54,175
that we formed a close association with Nintendo.

103
00:08:56,037 --> 00:09:00,520
And as HAL invented a couple of early franchises,

104
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,122
we also learned other lessons.

105
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:09,566
Our first Kirby game taught us the value of teamwork.

106
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,788
Since not everyone can be a Miyamoto.

107
00:09:15,192 --> 00:09:20,053
We discovered that idea can come from several team members

108
00:09:20,673 --> 00:09:25,415
building on each other to make something superior to what

109
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:27,155
one person could invent.

110
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:33,998
Then we worked with the famous Japanese creator, Shigesato

111
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:37,639
Itoi, who was already an avid gamer himself,

112
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,660
to develop his first idea for a game.

113
00:09:41,604 --> 00:09:44,045
That series, called Mother in Japan,

114
00:09:44,726 --> 00:09:48,167
and released here in America as Earthbound,

115
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:53,850
proved to us that ideas take on a special appeal

116
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,632
when they become interactive.

117
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:02,775
Many years and many projects later,

118
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:07,257
I went to work for Nintendo full time,

119
00:10:08,097 --> 00:10:10,298
and then one day, about...

120
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:17,839
Three years ago, Mr. Yamauchi appointed me to succeed him as company president.

121
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:25,900
Of course, this was a great honor, but it was also a great challenge.

122
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:36,323
I knew this would require committing much more time and assuming much more responsibility.

123
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:42,715
But fortunately, game developers are familiar with such things.

124
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,897
So I'd like to move on this morning

125
00:10:49,457 --> 00:10:53,138
and answer two questions that I'm often asked.

126
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:59,401
Now that I've had two decades of experience in the video game

127
00:10:59,441 --> 00:10:59,681
world.

128
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,065
Excuse me.

129
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:10,546
First, over the last 20 years as a developer,

130
00:11:12,147 --> 00:11:13,467
what things have changed?

131
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:18,869
And second, what things have stayed the same?

132
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:24,330
One thing that has not changed and will not change

133
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,312
is our nature as a form of entertainment.

134
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:33,213
Like any other entertainment medium.

135
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,613
we must create an emotional response in order to succeed.

136
00:11:39,154 --> 00:11:45,338
Laughter, fear, joy, anger, affection, surprise,

137
00:11:46,118 --> 00:11:49,220
and most of all, pride of accomplishment.

138
00:11:50,441 --> 00:11:54,464
In the end, triggering these feelings from our players

139
00:11:54,784 --> 00:11:57,126
is a true judgment of our work.

140
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:02,129
This is the bottom line measurement of success.

141
00:12:04,622 --> 00:12:08,902
Secondly, we must always weigh challenge and reward.

142
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:15,004
How much work and frustration a player is willing to withstand

143
00:12:16,284 --> 00:12:20,385
depends on the personality and skill of the player.

144
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:25,986
Core gamers have a huge appetite for challenge.

145
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:29,607
Casual gamers want less difficulty.

146
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:34,669
At Nintendo, we believe it is our responsibility

147
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,313
to make games for all skill levels.

148
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:44,398
And most definitely, that includes people who are not

149
00:12:44,758 --> 00:12:46,160
playing our games now.

150
00:12:48,862 --> 00:12:51,685
The third thing that has not changed

151
00:12:52,826 --> 00:12:54,928
is the importance of the idea.

152
00:12:56,223 --> 00:13:01,665
Of course, it is valuable to device an extension or offshoot

153
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:06,926
of a current idea, but it is invaluable to come up

154
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:10,287
with a brand new idea of what a game can be.

155
00:13:12,647 --> 00:13:16,988
I'm sure there are a few of you out there in the audience

156
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:22,350
today with such creativity, and our industry needs you.

157
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,573
This truth never changes.

158
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,534
Software sells hardware.

159
00:13:32,075 --> 00:13:35,997
People buy game systems to play the game they love.

160
00:13:37,557 --> 00:13:41,799
I agree with Steve Jobs, the head of Apple, when he said,

161
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,221
software is a user experience.

162
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:48,722
Software is a driving technology,

163
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:52,964
not just of computers, but of all consumer electronics.

164
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:01,512
Finally, what has not changed is the value of intellectual property.

165
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:12,540
If it is true that software sells hardware, it is more true than ever that franchises sell software.

166
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:21,966
While our industry has made hit games with names like Spider-Man and James Bond and NFL football,

167
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:28,961
I think we should be proud that our best games are those whose

168
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:32,683
hero and world we invented ourselves.

169
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:42,891
Thank you.

170
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,313
So then, on the other side of the coin,

171
00:14:47,214 --> 00:14:51,317
what do I think of when I consider what has changed?

172
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:57,748
One word immediately comes to mind, bigger.

173
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,232
Especially here in the Western hemisphere,

174
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:04,613
the business is bigger.

175
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:08,616
The North American and European retail markets alone

176
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:13,720
are now worth approximately $17 billion.

177
00:15:15,842 --> 00:15:18,804
In the US, game sales were up another 8% last year.

178
00:15:22,263 --> 00:15:32,105
There are games in your living room, your office, on your PDA, your cell phone, and of course, best of all, on your Nintendo DS.

179
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:43,327
Many in the media are shocked to learn that young men now spend more time playing games than watching TV.

180
00:15:44,707 --> 00:15:50,508
I think those of us in this room could have told them that a long time ago.

181
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,331
Of course, the games themselves have become much bigger

182
00:15:57,611 --> 00:15:58,491
in several ways.

183
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:02,432
They are bigger in a technical sense,

184
00:16:03,192 --> 00:16:05,132
occupying more digital space.

185
00:16:06,853 --> 00:16:10,514
That, in turn, requires bigger teams, bigger budgets,

186
00:16:11,414 --> 00:16:14,815
and bigger challenges in meeting deadlines.

187
00:16:16,795 --> 00:16:19,736
This also means that big game companies

188
00:16:20,076 --> 00:16:22,957
are getting bigger by consuming smaller ones.

189
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:26,729
We know that in the next generation,

190
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:31,796
budgets for AAA console games will regularly

191
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,398
move into eight digits.

192
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:37,683
And that's before any marketing money is spent.

193
00:16:40,006 --> 00:16:43,030
Only the biggest companies can afford such cost.

194
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:49,840
Not surprisingly, the success of our industry and the profit

195
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,483
margin for hit games has again drawn big interest

196
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:56,825
from larger entertainment companies.

197
00:16:59,447 --> 00:17:01,809
But we may not be compatible.

198
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,472
Their books, movies, and TV shows

199
00:17:06,932 --> 00:17:10,135
are exactly the same for every user.

200
00:17:12,392 --> 00:17:17,436
But our games let players help write their own screenplays

201
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,718
and their own endings.

202
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:25,102
Now, I don't think any of this is news.

203
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:28,524
Bigger budget, bigger staff, bigger companies.

204
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:33,108
It's there for all of us to see.

205
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:35,149
Big is obvious.

206
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:41,074
On the other hand, what's more prominent in my thinking?

207
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:46,456
These days is how our industry is getting smaller.

208
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:51,639
We are smaller in the amount of risk we are willing to accept.

209
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:57,241
We are also smaller in how we define video games.

210
00:17:59,022 --> 00:18:01,203
The list of genres seems fixed.

211
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:06,546
Shooters, sports, platform, puzzles, and so on.

212
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:12,501
When is the last time we invented a new genre?

213
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:18,285
But as importantly, even within these genres,

214
00:18:19,026 --> 00:18:22,248
we have reduced the environment we use.

215
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:27,512
The racing tracks, the soundtracks, the bosses,

216
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:32,515
the heroes are starting to looking more and more alike.

217
00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:38,563
Consider Tiger Woods Golf and Mario Golf,

218
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:42,904
each a successful franchise, but using two different looks

219
00:18:43,504 --> 00:18:44,825
for the same genre.

220
00:18:45,945 --> 00:18:49,747
Such variety is becoming harder and harder to find.

221
00:18:52,268 --> 00:18:56,489
We are even getting smaller in how we define progress.

222
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,271
Making games look more photorealistic

223
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:05,273
is not the only means of improving the game experience.

224
00:19:13,713 --> 00:19:17,415
I know on this point, I risk being misunderstood.

225
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:23,059
So remember, I am a man who once programmed a baseball game

226
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,181
with no baseball players.

227
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:29,003
If anyone appreciates graphics, it's me.

228
00:19:32,165 --> 00:19:37,249
But my point is that this is just one path to improve games.

229
00:19:38,517 --> 00:19:41,639
we need to find other improvement has

230
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,579
more than one definition.

231
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,543
And finally, I am most concerned with what we think as a gamer.

232
00:19:53,383 --> 00:19:58,125
As we spend more time and money chasing exactly the same

233
00:19:58,185 --> 00:20:01,227
players, who are leaving behind?

234
00:20:03,248 --> 00:20:06,429
Are we creating games just for each other?

235
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:12,770
Do you have friends and family members who do not play video games?

236
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:15,352
Well, why don't they?

237
00:20:17,073 --> 00:20:18,874
And I would ask this.

238
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:27,099
How often have you challenged yourself to create a game that you might not play?

239
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,443
I think these questions form an important challenge for all of us.

240
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:38,885
Excuse me.

241
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:44,786
So I have preached more than enough

242
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:47,627
about the state of our industry.

243
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:52,869
You may be wondering, how does Nintendo plan to respond?

244
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:57,810
Let me answer a couple of things in a straightforward way.

245
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,372
First, has Nintendo turned its back on the hardcore gamer?

246
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:05,872
I don't believe so.

247
00:21:07,457 --> 00:21:10,079
If we were not interested in core gamers,

248
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:13,582
we would not have packed in Metroid Prime Hunters

249
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:18,727
for each of you when you went out and bought your Nintendo DS.

250
00:21:20,388 --> 00:21:24,472
This is not just excellent game entertainment,

251
00:21:25,212 --> 00:21:31,197
but also a signal that we want the DS to be for core gamers,

252
00:21:31,277 --> 00:21:31,438
too.

253
00:21:33,706 --> 00:21:37,507
We would not have partnered with N-Space in order

254
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:42,729
to take a new look at shooters in the game Geist, which

255
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:45,370
is coming exclusively to Nintendo GameCube.

256
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:51,973
It will move your emotions and move your definition

257
00:21:52,793 --> 00:21:54,154
of this genre.

258
00:21:55,254 --> 00:21:58,215
And if we are not interested in core gamers,

259
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:05,618
GameCube would not be the home to the first big hit of 2005 here in America,

260
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:07,778
Capcom's Resident Evil 4.

261
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:13,981
It's a sign that not only do we care about core gamers,

262
00:22:14,581 --> 00:22:17,182
but core gamers care about Nintendo.

263
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:25,586
And most of all, we would not be finishing the most anticipated game

264
00:22:26,226 --> 00:22:27,786
in your industry this year.

265
00:22:28,568 --> 00:22:30,729
a brand new Legend of Zelda.

266
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:49,995
I wonder, I would love to tell you all about it, but actions speak louder than words.

267
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:57,775
We have chosen you to see the first new footage of Zelda since E3 10 months ago.

268
00:22:57,795 --> 00:22:58,697
So take a look.

269
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:38,061
A new look is only one part of the Zelda story.

270
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:43,464
Much more of the mystery will be revealed at E3.

271
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:48,287
This latest Zelda adventure will appeal to core gamers

272
00:24:49,267 --> 00:24:53,210
and all gamers, just like every previous version.

273
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,813
The reason, I believe, is that it meets the standards we set

274
00:24:58,913 --> 00:25:00,674
for all software we develop.

275
00:25:02,456 --> 00:25:05,477
We call these standards the four I's.

276
00:25:06,997 --> 00:25:09,778
First, is it truly innovative?

277
00:25:10,638 --> 00:25:13,999
Something different from what has come before?

278
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,040
Second, is it intuitive?

279
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:23,682
Does control of the game and the direction of gameplay

280
00:25:23,762 --> 00:25:24,702
seem natural?

281
00:25:26,323 --> 00:25:28,343
Third, is it inviting?

282
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:31,724
Do you want to spend time in this world?

283
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:38,907
And finally, how does it measure up in terms of interface?

284
00:25:39,968 --> 00:25:42,269
Can the player connect in new ways?

285
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,452
Certainly, few games can score perfectly

286
00:25:47,772 --> 00:25:49,453
in each of these areas.

287
00:25:50,414 --> 00:25:55,437
But at Nintendo, this is how we measure ourselves

288
00:25:56,698 --> 00:26:01,160
and why we apply these standards to our software projects.

289
00:26:02,348 --> 00:26:07,911
There is also an obvious hardware example, Nintendo DS.

290
00:26:09,671 --> 00:26:13,272
It was designed to demonstrate both innovation

291
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:20,655
and new forms of interface to be both intuitive and inviting.

292
00:26:22,256 --> 00:26:27,118
So far, people seem to have decided

293
00:26:27,498 --> 00:26:29,338
that it does all of that.

294
00:26:31,377 --> 00:26:35,660
As of today, we have shipped 4 million DS systems

295
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:39,964
to Japan and North America in just 16 weeks since launch.

296
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:44,568
And those numbers do not include Europe,

297
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:48,171
where Nintendo DS begins selling tomorrow.

298
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:53,776
I know that you are all familiar with the novel aspect

299
00:26:53,896 --> 00:26:57,059
of DS gameplay incorporating to.

300
00:26:58,232 --> 00:27:02,095
the two screens, the touch screen, and the microphone.

301
00:27:04,316 --> 00:27:07,619
What you may not have much knowledge of yet

302
00:27:08,139 --> 00:27:09,220
is wireless gameplay.

303
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:14,464
We are now finishing up a game, Mario Kart,

304
00:27:15,004 --> 00:27:18,687
that will allow eight players to compete simultaneously.

305
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:24,370
Yes, gamers already know that Mario Kart is fun.

306
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:25,671
But.

307
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:29,200
Does the DS version make it even more fun?

308
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:32,201
Well, let's find out.

309
00:27:34,663 --> 00:27:35,803
Let me ask you this.

310
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:41,966
Is there anyone out there who is celebrating a birthday today?

311
00:27:42,987 --> 00:27:44,007
If so, please stand up.

312
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:47,169
OK.

313
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,751
Please come up here to the stage.

314
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:53,592
Do we have anybody celebrating a birthday today?

315
00:27:58,984 --> 00:28:01,486
And in fact, if your birthday...

316
00:28:01,506 --> 00:28:03,107
Please come see this gentleman in the blue shirt here.

317
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:08,370
In fact, if your birthday is any day this week, please stand up.

318
00:28:09,531 --> 00:28:11,432
We've got room for just a few more, any day this week.

319
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:14,214
I will need six of you to come up here and join me.

320
00:28:14,594 --> 00:28:15,795
Come on, don't be shy.

321
00:28:28,863 --> 00:28:33,084
Bill, Bill Trinian from Nintendo of America is also going to join us.

322
00:28:34,205 --> 00:28:38,626
And we will form a test group for a wireless Mario Kart on Nintendo DS.

323
00:28:39,466 --> 00:28:45,307
Let's go ahead and spread out a little bit on stage so that if you guys aren't too happy with the results of the race, you don't get in too big of a fight here.

324
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:55,629
On the screen above us, you see Bill's kart. I hope trading mine, right Bill?

325
00:28:57,491 --> 00:29:00,452
Now if you've ever played a Mario Kart game, then you've got a pretty good idea of what

326
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:01,232
you're going to be doing here.

327
00:29:01,352 --> 00:29:06,293
If you haven't for some strange and unexplicable reason, I'll give you the control schemes.

328
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,334
You'll use the A button for your accelerator.

329
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,214
You'll steer with the plus control pad.

330
00:29:11,775 --> 00:29:15,856
If for whatever reason you decide you need to step on the brakes, which I don't know

331
00:29:16,116 --> 00:29:18,716
of anyone who ever does that in Mario Kart, but that's the B button.

332
00:29:20,037 --> 00:29:23,438
When you go into a curve, you can use the R button to hop into your power slide.

333
00:29:23,938 --> 00:29:26,978
And once you pick up an item, you can use the L button to use the item.

334
00:29:27,964 --> 00:29:29,064
Okay, let's start.

335
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:35,206
And remember, Mr. Iwata is not your standard corporate suit here.

336
00:29:35,246 --> 00:29:38,667
The guy, he used to program games, he certainly knows how to play them.

337
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:40,608
So don't pull any punches.

338
00:29:41,908 --> 00:29:43,069
He's not fun to lose to.

339
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:49,111
Now see, I'm off to a good start here already, except for the fact that I just missed my item.

340
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:51,692
And that I can't seem to get off the grass.

341
00:29:54,232 --> 00:29:55,593
Mr. Iwata, which character are you?

342
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,293
I'm Mario.

343
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,561
You're Mario.

344
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:02,082
I'm not good player.

345
00:30:02,102 --> 00:30:03,703
Everybody, get Mario.

346
00:30:05,644 --> 00:30:06,104
No!

347
00:30:08,926 --> 00:30:11,787
I've been trying to beat him all week and I've had no success.

348
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:18,290
I don't know how to play.

349
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:18,990
Use the A button.

350
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:21,071
This button, it's to go fast.

351
00:30:22,092 --> 00:30:23,873
Steer with the plus control pad.

352
00:30:24,233 --> 00:30:24,433
Ah, okay.

353
00:30:25,453 --> 00:30:25,914
Ah, yeah, thanks.

354
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:26,534
Sure.

355
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,261
Now you can see on my screen, I've got a close-up map of my character,

356
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:34,462
so I can see what's going on in my immediate vicinity.

357
00:30:34,982 --> 00:30:37,723
When I'm paying attention to that, I can see if there's a red shell coming my way.

358
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,043
Or I can press the X button to get a full-screen view

359
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,364
to see just how far behind I am from Mr. Iwata.

360
00:30:49,946 --> 00:30:50,486
Take that, Peach.

361
00:30:57,874 --> 00:31:01,497
Now if you're really good at the power slide, you can power your way through the turns here, kind of like I'm doing.

362
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:11,245
And now we've got just over one lap to go. I think I'm ready to make my move.

363
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,008
Oh yeah, there we go.

364
00:31:15,028 --> 00:31:18,671
Yeah, unfortunately I'm very bad.

365
00:31:20,953 --> 00:31:22,835
I'm finally going to beat Mr. La. This is great.

366
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:31,817
Ouch! Oh, who was that?

367
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:32,397
Ha!

368
00:31:34,938 --> 00:31:35,038
Oh!

369
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:36,658
And all I get is a banana.

370
00:31:36,998 --> 00:31:37,338
Jeez.

371
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:45,721
Okay.

372
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:46,981
Whoa.

373
00:31:52,102 --> 00:31:53,583
Uh, somehow I don't think I'm going to pull this out.

374
00:31:57,389 --> 00:31:58,630
Well second place isn't too bad.

375
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,170
Congratulations!

376
00:31:59,210 --> 00:31:59,590
Thank you.

377
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,351
Nice job.

378
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:00,711
Nice boy.

379
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:10,656
Thank you very much everybody.

380
00:32:11,136 --> 00:32:12,317
Thank you very much for joining us.

381
00:32:13,257 --> 00:32:21,641
Now, unfortunately, we're not going to be giving these to you today, so if you can go ahead and leave your DS's and your Gameboy Advance, or your Mario Kart games with our friend in the blue shirt here,

382
00:32:21,661 --> 00:32:22,202
that would be great.

383
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:34,220
These days, I spend so much of my time on meetings,

384
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,981
and interviews, and traveling.

385
00:32:37,642 --> 00:32:42,346
I sometimes forget how much fun I have playing games.

386
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:43,266
I like that.

387
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:49,551
Well, this demonstration of wireless Mario Kart

388
00:32:50,071 --> 00:32:53,134
brings us up to the present moment.

389
00:32:54,054 --> 00:32:58,198
This is a product that we will bring to the market

390
00:32:58,218 --> 00:32:59,218
later this year.

391
00:33:01,493 --> 00:33:08,255
But I'd like to spend the rest of my time today on what is perhaps the next logical question.

392
00:33:09,476 --> 00:33:11,556
Where does Nintendo go from here?

393
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:17,999
Let me try to explain it first with an image.

394
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:25,821
In the universe of interactive entertainment, there is a planet we call video games.

395
00:33:27,482 --> 00:33:29,683
It is the one we know best.

396
00:33:30,528 --> 00:33:31,689
But it is only one.

397
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:37,573
Also, in our universe are other planets which entertain,

398
00:33:38,113 --> 00:33:41,835
but in different ways from current games.

399
00:33:44,036 --> 00:33:49,179
It is this part of the universe we are anxious to explore.

400
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:56,043
So this idea creates the dual passion of Nintendo.

401
00:33:57,364 --> 00:33:58,205
On one hand, we.

402
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:06,606
work every day to make what we describe as video game better.

403
00:34:08,606 --> 00:34:11,247
We want to give players what they want.

404
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:18,068
But at the same time, we are intent on finding out

405
00:34:18,648 --> 00:34:21,589
what else we can use to entertain.

406
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:27,070
Our second goal is to show players something new,

407
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:31,930
They may not even know they want.

408
00:34:33,931 --> 00:34:37,412
You already are familiar with a good example

409
00:34:37,572 --> 00:34:38,493
of this philosophy.

410
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:39,633
It's Pokemon.

411
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:45,555
At its core, Pokemon is a wonderful role-playing game.

412
00:34:46,276 --> 00:34:47,776
But it is also much more.

413
00:34:49,497 --> 00:34:51,678
Players collect and trade Pokemon

414
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:56,620
maybe the same way you once collected and traded

415
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,400
bottle caps or baseball cards.

416
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:06,932
Pokemon expanded RPGs to places they hadn't gone before.

417
00:35:08,772 --> 00:35:14,593
Another example was our decision to put PictoChat into the DS.

418
00:35:16,534 --> 00:35:19,454
It's not a game, not a competition,

419
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:24,956
but a way for us to better understand

420
00:35:25,196 --> 00:35:29,557
how communicating wirelessly might also entertain.

421
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,152
And PictoChat as a wireless function

422
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:40,815
also represents just the latest step in something

423
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:42,516
much larger for Nintendo.

424
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:46,438
Excuse me.

425
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:51,301
I want to announce today that following

426
00:35:51,521 --> 00:35:54,763
the groundbreaking work we have always

427
00:35:54,823 --> 00:35:56,964
done in connecting players.

428
00:35:57,793 --> 00:36:01,195
we will aggressively pursue Wi-Fi connections,

429
00:36:01,716 --> 00:36:03,137
beginning with Nintendo DS.

430
00:36:05,098 --> 00:36:08,920
The original Game Boy connected two players with a cable,

431
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,442
then four players on Game Boy Advance.

432
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:17,245
We put four control ports on your consoles,

433
00:36:18,145 --> 00:36:20,987
and then made our controllers wireless.

434
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:25,049
With Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen.

435
00:36:25,992 --> 00:36:28,554
We packaged wireless adapters with the games.

436
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:33,718
That introduced unfamiliar players

437
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:36,700
over fairly large distances.

438
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:43,406
This is all part of a unifying philosophy that

439
00:36:43,806 --> 00:36:45,507
continues with Nintendo DS.

440
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:50,371
Every aspect of Nintendo DS is designed

441
00:36:50,471 --> 00:36:53,214
to be friendly to all audiences.

442
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:55,135
Therefore...

443
00:36:55,988 --> 00:36:59,251
Wi-Fi should be easy for everyone, too.

444
00:37:01,213 --> 00:37:06,018
Our goal is to make this process simple and seamless.

445
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,962
Users shouldn't give a thought.

446
00:37:11,323 --> 00:37:14,907
Wi-Fi connections will feel like a local area network

447
00:37:14,947 --> 00:37:18,310
connections, because they will use a common API.

448
00:37:20,393 --> 00:37:25,918
We will let DS owners enjoy Wi-Fi without the difficulty

449
00:37:25,998 --> 00:37:29,221
of entering an SSID or a web key.

450
00:37:30,743 --> 00:37:34,026
And maybe, most importantly, we will

451
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:36,628
remove the most important consumer barrier,

452
00:37:37,909 --> 00:37:41,612
because Nintendo's Wi-Fi connection will be free.

453
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:44,055
As I said.

454
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:51,511
Thank you.

455
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:54,832
As I said, simple and seamless.

456
00:37:55,513 --> 00:38:00,155
So you may want to know, is this infrastructure ready to go?

457
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:01,356
Almost.

458
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:03,757
What about development?

459
00:38:04,558 --> 00:38:05,558
Where are the dev kits?

460
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,660
By three, you won't be asking that question.

461
00:38:10,961 --> 00:38:13,162
Well then, what about the entertainment?

462
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:18,465
I can say today that you will be playing Wi-Fi games on DS

463
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:18,805
this year.

464
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:25,453
What we are developing internally and externally

465
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:28,674
with a number of people is very exciting to me.

466
00:38:30,035 --> 00:38:33,075
At least one of these projects, I believe,

467
00:38:33,316 --> 00:38:34,516
will be groundbreaking.

468
00:38:36,596 --> 00:38:39,737
And we look forward to your Wi-Fi games, too.

469
00:38:42,198 --> 00:38:45,459
Let me give you one example of what we are working on.

470
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:50,600
Internally, we are developing Animal Crossing Wi-Fi.

471
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:55,986
We chose this property for a couple of reasons.

472
00:38:57,507 --> 00:39:01,249
First, it is one of those non-game games I mentioned,

473
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:05,151
a form of entertainment that really doesn't have a winner

474
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:07,432
or even a real conclusion.

475
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:12,875
And because of its unrestrained pace of action,

476
00:39:13,536 --> 00:39:15,457
it avoids wireless latency issues.

477
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:21,900
Before, you could take animal crossing to a different village.

478
00:39:22,851 --> 00:39:27,313
Now, with Wi-Fi, you can take it around the world.

479
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:33,475
So we feel that our form of free and easy wireless play

480
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:37,056
helps move our industry in a new direction.

481
00:39:40,137 --> 00:39:43,718
But we are making similar moves in software as well.

482
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:46,119
I want, again, to.

483
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:50,205
bring Bill to in and out to demonstrate two other things

484
00:39:50,526 --> 00:39:54,187
that come from a different part of the interactive entertainment

485
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:54,647
universe.

486
00:39:55,868 --> 00:39:59,409
But even before we show them, I can tell you,

487
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:05,511
they may seem unusual because they are something different.

488
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:11,174
This first one is the current passion of Mr. Miyamoto

489
00:40:12,514 --> 00:40:13,655
and Bill himself.

490
00:40:19,868 --> 00:40:23,870
I'm sure by this point many of you have probably heard the name Nintendogs before.

491
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:28,852
Some of you have probably seen screenshots of it and maybe even a few of you have seen the video we showed at E3 last year

492
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:32,374
or possibly even played it here on the show floor at the GDC.

493
00:40:34,215 --> 00:40:37,116
What you haven't seen is the full version and what I'm going to try to show to you today

494
00:40:37,716 --> 00:40:41,338
is some of the unique microphone capabilities that we've implemented in this game

495
00:40:41,778 --> 00:40:47,280
that I think is going to get you very excited if my dog here, Chopper, is a good boy.

496
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:55,033
Now obviously I've got one dog here in my house, and I can pet him with the touchscreen,

497
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:58,434
and I can play with him, and he is a very cute puppy.

498
00:41:02,055 --> 00:41:08,777
He is unfortunately very excited right now, but what we can do is I can go and I can grab

499
00:41:08,797 --> 00:41:10,378
some items and I can play with him in the house.

500
00:41:10,398 --> 00:41:13,499
I've got a little tennis ball here that I can throw around for him.

501
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,020
He'll chase it, he'll play with it.

502
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:23,609
and maybe I can even get him to bring it back to me. Which is

503
00:41:23,649 --> 00:41:26,494
all well and good, but so far this doesn't really show off

504
00:41:26,554 --> 00:41:30,040
anything. So let's see if I can get him to really respond to me.

505
00:41:32,885 --> 00:41:33,105
Chopper.

506
00:41:41,824 --> 00:41:46,688
Now the best thing about the use of the microphone in Nintendogs is that this is not a standard

507
00:41:46,749 --> 00:41:50,972
set of terminology that you have to respond to, that you have to memorize and work with

508
00:41:51,012 --> 00:41:51,553
the dog on.

509
00:41:52,053 --> 00:41:53,495
You create your own terms.

510
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:55,837
You train this dog with the words you want to train it with.

511
00:41:56,317 --> 00:41:59,760
So if you want to tell the dog to sit to make the dog sit, it can be that.

512
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,723
If you want to tell the dog to get down to make him sit, it can be that.

513
00:42:03,463 --> 00:42:06,987
Or if you just want to say, boogie man, it can be that.

514
00:42:07,887 --> 00:42:09,529
You teach the dog the terms you want.

515
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:13,103
So let's see if I can get Chopper to respond to some of the terms that I've taught him.

516
00:42:14,644 --> 00:42:14,925
Chopper.

517
00:42:19,488 --> 00:42:20,429
Okay, okay.

518
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,631
Chopper. Sit, boy.

519
00:42:27,615 --> 00:42:27,975
Sit, boy.

520
00:42:30,697 --> 00:42:34,780
Now, unfortunately, I have two dogs in real life, and they don't listen to a thing I say either.

521
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,623
So, I'm really not just a very good dog trainer, I think.

522
00:42:41,355 --> 00:42:43,157
And Chopper, I think, may be a little bit hungry.

523
00:42:43,197 --> 00:42:45,440
So let me see what is, I can come in here and check.

524
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:46,941
He is a little bit hungry.

525
00:42:46,961 --> 00:42:48,183
So let me see if I can feed him some food

526
00:42:48,203 --> 00:42:49,164
and then get him to listen to me.

527
00:42:57,934 --> 00:42:58,355
There we go.

528
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:04,925
Now the game is going to feature over a dozen of the most popular breeds of dogs in the

529
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:09,468
United States, and each breed is going to have traits characteristic to that breed.

530
00:43:10,229 --> 00:43:13,071
So you'll have dogs that are very good at being trained with voice commands, you'll

531
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:16,293
have dogs that will be very good at agility competitions, and you'll have dogs that will

532
00:43:16,313 --> 00:43:18,535
be very good at things like frisbee competitions.

533
00:43:19,155 --> 00:43:20,436
Or flying discs, I should say.

534
00:43:22,277 --> 00:43:22,558
Chopper!

535
00:43:26,501 --> 00:43:27,261
Yeah.

536
00:43:29,122 --> 00:43:29,463
Sit, boy.

537
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:32,559
Sit, boy.

538
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:35,260
Uh-oh.

539
00:43:40,002 --> 00:43:45,324
Now, in this case, some of the other features

540
00:43:45,344 --> 00:43:48,305
that the game does have is that you can wash your dog.

541
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:51,926
You can give him a little bath.

542
00:43:51,966 --> 00:43:53,766
You can also take them for walks around town.

543
00:43:53,786 --> 00:43:56,727
We'll give him a little quick bath right here,

544
00:43:58,628 --> 00:43:59,388
which is a lot of fun.

545
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,991
He doesn't like me yanking his tail.

546
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:10,074
And then you just grab the shower handle and you wash him off.

547
00:44:18,858 --> 00:44:20,599
Okay, come on, let's get you clean here, buddy.

548
00:44:21,819 --> 00:44:22,500
There we go.

549
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:29,563
And there we go.

550
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,564
There we go, now he's nice and sparkly clean.

551
00:44:33,308 --> 00:44:38,170
You can also enjoy taking your dog for a walk around town where, like all dogs, he will

552
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:42,511
mark his territory and leave little packages behind for people, which would be best if

553
00:44:42,551 --> 00:44:43,691
you could pick those up along the way.

554
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:44,112
Chopper!

555
00:44:44,672 --> 00:44:44,832
Good dog.

556
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:45,172
Chopper, lie down.

557
00:44:45,212 --> 00:44:45,552
Lie down.

558
00:44:45,592 --> 00:44:45,852
Lie down.

559
00:44:45,872 --> 00:44:50,234
Lie down.

560
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:50,594
Lie down.

561
00:44:50,614 --> 00:44:50,814
Lie down.

562
00:44:50,834 --> 00:44:51,214
Lie down.

563
00:44:51,234 --> 00:44:56,036
Lie down.

564
00:44:56,056 --> 00:44:56,216
Lie down.

565
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:56,476
Lie down.

566
00:44:56,496 --> 00:44:57,236
Lie down.

567
00:44:57,256 --> 00:44:58,016
Lie down.

568
00:44:58,036 --> 00:44:59,017
Lie down.

569
00:44:59,037 --> 00:44:59,277
Lie down.

570
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:00,057
Lie down.

571
00:45:02,873 --> 00:45:04,154
Good dog.

572
00:45:10,737 --> 00:45:12,018
Now what I'm going to do here is click there.

573
00:45:12,558 --> 00:45:15,700
Unfortunately I've been teaching Chopper a little too many commands this morning and

574
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,581
he doesn't want to learn any more.

575
00:45:16,621 --> 00:45:20,743
But what you would do is you would click right there, tell your command into the microphone

576
00:45:21,143 --> 00:45:24,585
and then the game would repeat your command and the dog would understand it.

577
00:45:25,106 --> 00:45:29,488
So again you could teach him to play dead, jump, or in the case of Chopper you might

578
00:45:29,508 --> 00:45:30,889
want to teach him to stick balls.

579
00:45:33,707 --> 00:45:36,168
And with that, we're going to move on to the next game.

580
00:45:45,071 --> 00:45:48,293
And now, Mr. Miyamoto is very busy to finishing up

581
00:45:48,353 --> 00:45:49,473
this game in Japan.

582
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:56,136
As you see, this product will expand our audience

583
00:45:56,296 --> 00:46:01,238
to players who currently are not satisfied with what

584
00:46:01,378 --> 00:46:02,539
we've been offering them.

585
00:46:04,739 --> 00:46:07,620
I'm also going to ask Bill to show you

586
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,701
one other software project.

587
00:46:10,742 --> 00:46:12,503
We are calling Electroplankton.

588
00:46:13,523 --> 00:46:14,724
That sounds different.

589
00:46:15,404 --> 00:46:17,445
Electroplankton.

590
00:46:18,806 --> 00:46:20,107
And it looks different, too.

591
00:46:21,968 --> 00:46:25,770
The idea here is that creativity should not just

592
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:29,491
belong to the developer, but to the player as well.

593
00:46:32,367 --> 00:46:38,132
Electroplankton is a game that really can only be described as an interactive musical composition experience,

594
00:46:38,292 --> 00:46:40,634
which sounds kind of long, but I don't really know what else to call it.

595
00:46:41,455 --> 00:46:44,077
What it is, is a software program.

596
00:46:44,357 --> 00:46:46,999
Like Mr. Iwata says, it's not really a game, it's an experience.

597
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:53,705
And it's one that allows someone like me, who has absolutely no musical capabilities whatsoever,

598
00:46:54,485 --> 00:46:57,168
to do something that a lot of you probably do, and that's create music.

599
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:00,472
And what you see me doing here is I'm just touching the screen,

600
00:47:00,792 --> 00:47:04,394
and by doing so, I'm placing electroplanktons on the screen.

601
00:47:04,694 --> 00:47:05,895
And depending on where they're located,

602
00:47:06,315 --> 00:47:07,436
they're making different noises.

603
00:47:08,537 --> 00:47:11,819
And so based on this, I can compose a music, compose a song.

604
00:47:23,946 --> 00:47:25,627
If I happen to place one in a spot I don't like,

605
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:26,487
I can simply grab it.

606
00:47:27,504 --> 00:47:30,487
slide it somewhere else, and change the note that it makes.

607
00:47:32,709 --> 00:47:35,732
Gradually, in this mode, as the electroplanktons get larger,

608
00:47:36,473 --> 00:47:37,974
you'll notice that the sounds they're making

609
00:47:38,095 --> 00:47:39,376
become slightly more symphonic.

610
00:47:40,177 --> 00:47:42,999
And so as you're creating music, the music that you're creating

611
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,321
is interactive and changing.

612
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:48,545
It's really a fascinating experience,

613
00:47:48,845 --> 00:47:50,867
but there's actually a lot more modes than just this one.

614
00:47:54,157 --> 00:48:01,320
So I'm going to show you one more, and I'm actually going to show you two more, but this next one also takes advantage of the microphone, although it looks kind of strange.

615
00:48:05,102 --> 00:48:11,325
So we have a nice drum beat going on here, and you've got four fish swimming across the screen, which probably looks kind of strange and doesn't make a lot of sense,

616
00:48:11,905 --> 00:48:15,427
which is what we first thought when we got the game in the office, until we started experimenting with it.

617
00:48:16,567 --> 00:48:17,408
Let me show you what it does.

618
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:19,969
I'm just going to tap one of these fish.

619
00:48:36,756 --> 00:48:38,457
Electro Plankton!

620
00:48:39,098 --> 00:48:40,939
Electro Plankton!

621
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,480
Electro Plankton!

622
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,282
Electro Plankton!

623
00:48:44,502 --> 00:48:46,483
Electro Plankton!

624
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:50,727
Nintendo!

625
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:26,414
Who's your daddy?

626
00:49:27,155 --> 00:49:30,177
I know I'm not a great rapper, but I'm no worse than vanilla ice.

627
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:35,986
And then the next mode that I'm going to show you, I think a lot of you are going to have a lot of fun out of.

628
00:49:36,947 --> 00:49:40,589
And this is a little remix of the Super Mario theme song

629
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:44,431
that I can fiddle around with and do whatever I want.

630
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:47,333
And we've got not just the Mario theme song, but many others in here

631
00:49:47,673 --> 00:49:49,374
that you can change just by pressing the select button.

632
00:49:49,674 --> 00:49:51,635
But I'm going to have to give it a go and see how I do.

633
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:16,464
This game is different.

634
00:50:21,089 --> 00:50:22,791
This game is different.

635
00:50:27,656 --> 00:50:31,741
It's designed to produce harmony, not adrenaline.

636
00:50:32,722 --> 00:50:37,267
So far, we are seeing different kinds of reactions to electroplankton.

637
00:50:38,888 --> 00:50:41,328
Some test players are confused.

638
00:50:41,929 --> 00:50:45,429
They keep looking for their score or their next enemy.

639
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,390
But others are hypnotized.

640
00:50:50,991 --> 00:50:54,772
There are people who simply refuse to turn the game off.

641
00:50:56,592 --> 00:50:59,033
No matter what your own reaction,

642
00:50:59,373 --> 00:51:03,774
I think you can agree that this is definitely not

643
00:51:03,934 --> 00:51:06,535
from the world we currently call video games.

644
00:51:07,835 --> 00:51:08,375
Thank you, Bill.

645
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,291
Thank you, Bill.

646
00:51:22,193 --> 00:51:24,754
So, this is Nintendo's plan.

647
00:51:25,814 --> 00:51:28,375
Make our existing game world much better.

648
00:51:29,275 --> 00:51:37,378
Better Zeldas, better Marios, better partnerships creating games like Resident Evil 4, but also

649
00:51:38,038 --> 00:51:39,758
exploring other worlds.

650
00:51:40,356 --> 00:51:41,637
in interactive entertainment.

651
00:51:42,597 --> 00:51:45,459
For us, this is a passion.

652
00:51:46,399 --> 00:51:48,841
This is a mission of adventure.

653
00:51:51,462 --> 00:51:53,963
And most importantly, we want you,

654
00:51:54,924 --> 00:51:58,106
the creative heart for our entire industry,

655
00:51:58,846 --> 00:52:00,807
to take that journey with us.

656
00:52:02,824 --> 00:52:05,385
You may remember from E3 last year

657
00:52:05,645 --> 00:52:11,867
that we explained that DS had two meanings, dual screen

658
00:52:12,767 --> 00:52:14,348
and developer's system.

659
00:52:15,968 --> 00:52:19,029
And Nintendo Revolution is a developer's system, too.

660
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:24,411
With IBM, we are creating a revolution's core processor,

661
00:52:25,311 --> 00:52:27,812
which we have code named Broadway.

662
00:52:29,183 --> 00:52:32,964
because Broadway is the capital of live entertainment.

663
00:52:34,324 --> 00:52:38,165
With ATI, we are developing the graphic chipset

664
00:52:38,285 --> 00:52:43,106
called named Hollywood because Hollywood is the capital

665
00:52:43,246 --> 00:52:44,526
of movie entertainment.

666
00:52:46,106 --> 00:52:48,847
With Revolution, we are determined

667
00:52:49,007 --> 00:52:53,488
to create the new capital of interactive entertainment.

668
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:57,688
Now, a couple of specifics.

669
00:52:59,865 --> 00:53:03,547
First, contrary to much speculation,

670
00:53:04,468 --> 00:53:06,649
I can announce today that Revolution

671
00:53:07,069 --> 00:53:09,271
will be backward compatible.

672
00:53:18,537 --> 00:53:20,758
The best of the Nintendo GameCube library

673
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:25,501
will still be enjoyed by players years from now.

674
00:53:27,647 --> 00:53:35,774
Second, as I said earlier, we intended to incorporate wireless technology in all we do.

675
00:53:37,195 --> 00:53:44,041
Therefore, Nintendo Revolution will be Wi-Fi enabled built into every system.

676
00:53:51,427 --> 00:53:51,807
Thank you.

677
00:53:52,428 --> 00:53:52,928
And third,

678
00:53:53,776 --> 00:53:57,279
Even though the game experience enjoyed by players

679
00:53:57,319 --> 00:53:59,500
will be far different on Revolution,

680
00:54:00,501 --> 00:54:03,223
developing for it will be familiar.

681
00:54:04,264 --> 00:54:07,226
It will not require a steep new learning curve.

682
00:54:08,527 --> 00:54:11,009
In this way, just like Nintendo DS,

683
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:15,852
it's a place where the best idea, not the biggest budget,

684
00:54:16,433 --> 00:54:16,993
will win.

685
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:32,592
And make no mistake, we expect third-party publishers will be fully supportive of what we are doing.

686
00:54:34,653 --> 00:54:42,899
From this point forward, in support of all of our product lines, Nintendo will be expanding our development reach.

687
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,223
Some of these new games will come from larger internal teams.

688
00:54:49,606 --> 00:54:52,147
Some from the kinds of game partnerships

689
00:54:52,307 --> 00:54:55,588
we've formed with third parties over recent years.

690
00:54:57,269 --> 00:55:00,790
Maybe someday we'll work on a game together.

691
00:55:00,891 --> 00:55:01,531
I'd like that.

692
00:55:07,313 --> 00:55:10,334
If you don't mind, I will finish today

693
00:55:10,614 --> 00:55:15,176
with memories from one more franchise in my development

694
00:55:15,236 --> 00:55:17,217
career, Super Smash Brothers.

695
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,983
At the time it was being developed for Nintendo GameCube,

696
00:55:28,884 --> 00:55:31,987
I was already working full time for Nintendo.

697
00:55:33,308 --> 00:55:37,511
But my heart told me I was still a developer.

698
00:55:38,051 --> 00:55:42,054
So I assigned myself to how to rejoin the team,

699
00:55:42,495 --> 00:55:43,415
finishing the game.

700
00:55:44,376 --> 00:55:48,719
Once again, I was living on the Japanese developer's diet

701
00:55:48,759 --> 00:55:50,821
of chips, pizza, and the rice balls,

702
00:55:51,522 --> 00:55:52,943
and walking through the night.

703
00:55:54,822 --> 00:55:59,745
From their offices, it was possible to see Mount Fuji,

704
00:56:00,246 --> 00:56:03,848
which many say is most impressive if you are willing

705
00:56:03,948 --> 00:56:06,290
to wake up and see it at dawn.

706
00:56:08,232 --> 00:56:13,155
But during this period, just as years before with our Kirby

707
00:56:13,195 --> 00:56:19,440
games, we at HAL would see the sun shining on the mountain

708
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,462
before we ever went to bed.

709
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:28,011
Many say the sight of the first light on Mount Fuji

710
00:56:28,691 --> 00:56:29,591
inspires them.

711
00:56:30,611 --> 00:56:34,152
But for me, I hope I never see it again.

712
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:46,575
I also remember the first version of Smash Brothers

713
00:56:46,735 --> 00:56:47,915
developed for Nintendo 64.

714
00:56:50,295 --> 00:56:52,576
The concept for the game, as you know,

715
00:56:53,472 --> 00:56:57,713
was to take the classic, friendly Nintendo franchise characters

716
00:56:58,513 --> 00:57:01,454
and have them, as you say here in America,

717
00:57:02,994 --> 00:57:05,035
beat the heck out of each other.

718
00:57:07,836 --> 00:57:09,916
The idea was not brand new.

719
00:57:11,157 --> 00:57:14,958
There certainly have been a lot of fighting games.

720
00:57:16,738 --> 00:57:19,939
And the characters looked pretty much the same way

721
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:21,180
they always have.

722
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:28,253
So when we brought the idea to Nintendo,

723
00:57:29,153 --> 00:57:33,455
the concept did not sound hip or cool or revolutionary.

724
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:38,897
And because of all this, there were people

725
00:57:39,017 --> 00:57:43,719
both inside and outside Nintendo who did not strongly

726
00:57:43,959 --> 00:57:45,200
favor our idea.

727
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:51,602
And this was the environment that our team worked under.

728
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:58,444
That attitude remained until the moment of truth,

729
00:57:59,064 --> 00:58:03,564
the moment when testers began picking up the controllers

730
00:58:04,205 --> 00:58:05,705
and actually playing the game.

731
00:58:07,205 --> 00:58:08,265
This is what happened.

732
00:58:10,146 --> 00:58:15,446
People smiled, then laughed, then

733
00:58:15,507 --> 00:58:17,167
began shouting to each other.

734
00:58:18,507 --> 00:58:22,608
That was the moment when everything for Smash Bros.

735
00:58:22,668 --> 00:58:23,068
changed.

736
00:58:25,362 --> 00:58:33,012
And I must tell you, this was also one of the proudest moments in my development career.

737
00:58:34,834 --> 00:58:39,981
Yes, the Smash Bros. series has become a great worldwide success

738
00:58:40,401 --> 00:58:44,646
because it sold over 10 million copies worldwide.

739
00:58:51,415 --> 00:58:52,016
Thank you very much.

740
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:55,899
But the memory of that first moment

741
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:00,323
when the testers began to play stays with me always.

742
00:59:01,664 --> 00:59:05,808
That is that moment that I call success.

743
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:10,912
We at HAL found a way to bring our idea to life.

744
00:59:11,873 --> 00:59:14,755
Our team believed deeply in the concept,

745
00:59:15,716 --> 00:59:18,959
and we did not waver in our approach.

746
00:59:20,385 --> 00:59:23,948
So, in this important sense, we are Tao.

747
00:59:24,548 --> 00:59:27,330
We are just like every one of you.

748
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:32,714
Even if we come from different sides of the world,

749
00:59:33,755 --> 00:59:39,499
speak different languages, even if we eat too many chips

750
00:59:39,859 --> 00:59:45,243
or rice balls, even if we have different tastes in games.

751
00:59:47,203 --> 00:59:50,865
Every one of us here today is identical.

752
00:59:51,966 --> 00:59:55,748
In the most important way, each one of us

753
00:59:56,089 --> 00:59:58,670
has the heart of the gamer.

754
01:00:00,091 --> 01:00:01,532
Thank you very much for your attention.

755
01:00:13,699 --> 01:00:15,525
I love you...

756
01:00:16,247 --> 01:00:17,470
I love you...
