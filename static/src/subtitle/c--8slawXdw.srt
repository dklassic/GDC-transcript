00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:08,858
Hi everybody, I'm Dan John Cox.

2
00:00:09,418 --> 00:00:11,260
This is Bringing a New Dimension to Below,

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,101
Personal Discovery and Adaptation.

4
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:15,462
I'm a 3D artist at Capybara Games,

5
00:00:15,922 --> 00:00:18,384
and specifically today we're talking about Below.

6
00:00:19,284 --> 00:00:21,286
Below's a game I've been working on for about two years,

7
00:00:21,346 --> 00:00:23,007
not the entirety of the production,

8
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:25,969
but specifically what we're talking about is...

9
00:00:26,957 --> 00:00:30,038
First off, how Below kind of got its visual style,

10
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:32,980
what is involved in that in a somewhat technical manner.

11
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:35,862
As well, sort of my personal journey,

12
00:00:36,062 --> 00:00:39,164
starting with the team and integrating more 3D into Below.

13
00:00:40,284 --> 00:00:42,846
The difficulties and tricky elements that come

14
00:00:42,906 --> 00:00:45,147
from switching from Ubisoft style production

15
00:00:45,227 --> 00:00:47,288
into something much smaller, much leaner,

16
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:48,529
and a little bit crazier.

17
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:54,630
But first off, what is Below? Below is a procedurally generated roguelike game

18
00:00:55,231 --> 00:01:00,172
with an extreme difficulty level where if you are hit by a single enemy, you can start bleeding.

19
00:01:00,692 --> 00:01:06,513
If you can't stop that bleeding, then you die and you'll have to start the whole area over again.

20
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:11,514
The world, however, stays persistent and will continue through every different life that you

21
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:16,835
have. When you die and you start over, you start over as a new wanderer, a brand new person in this

22
00:01:17,336 --> 00:01:18,696
dark and foreboding world.

23
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:20,723
The trailer is always nice.

24
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,180
You

25
00:02:28,058 --> 00:02:30,200
So that's below, there we go.

26
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:32,862
First off, if you are looking forward to Below in some way,

27
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:34,564
don't worry, this talk has no spoilers in it.

28
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:36,485
There's a lot of secret stuff that we're hiding

29
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:39,227
and you won't get spoiled on any of that.

30
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:42,450
So first off, let's cover Below's visuals

31
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:44,892
or what happened before I arrived.

32
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:47,594
So none of what you're about to see is pretty much anything

33
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,116
that I was particularly involved with,

34
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:53,059
but it does set the stage for how things work in the first place.

35
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,062
So, first off, to understand Below's style and visual aesthetic, you've got to understand

36
00:02:58,102 --> 00:02:58,802
Cappy's history.

37
00:02:59,183 --> 00:03:05,166
So, they worked on Sword & Sorcery, Critter Crunch, Clash of Heroes, and Super Time Force.

38
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:11,690
All of these are very 2D and animation-based games with beautiful animation and 2D art.

39
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:12,791
Uh, no, 3D.

40
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:16,333
So when you look at Below's style in the first place,

41
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:18,695
in some cases you'll see lighting and things like that

42
00:03:18,755 --> 00:03:22,017
in some 3D objects, but it's not quite so simple.

43
00:03:22,237 --> 00:03:25,059
In fact, pretty much all of Below is two-dimensional

44
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:26,220
when you see it in reality.

45
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,121
Some objects are 3D.

46
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:30,523
The character itself is 3D as well

47
00:03:31,143 --> 00:03:33,965
for a variety of resource-intensive reasons.

48
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:36,286
But that's basically the setup

49
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:38,048
that you begin to work with in Below,

50
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:40,189
is that you've got a three-dimensional character

51
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:41,710
on totally flat backgrounds.

52
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:42,731
Bye.

53
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,873
It ends up looking clean and interesting and has a beautiful style in and of itself.

54
00:03:48,614 --> 00:03:51,956
But every background that you're seeing basically is 2D.

55
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:57,819
And that works really well except when you want lighting, which began to become a more

56
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,581
interesting element to put into the game.

57
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:02,202
So how do you get lighting onto a hand-painted background?

58
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:08,666
Well, you hand-paint normals, which is a super time-consuming and intensive process, something

59
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:12,409
that you'd often think you should not do because it just is laborious.

60
00:04:13,332 --> 00:04:15,133
But that's what Cappy went for.

61
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:17,235
They wanted lighting so they'd paint into the backgrounds.

62
00:04:17,835 --> 00:04:19,517
Basically, each artist would just lasso

63
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:21,599
over certain sections of the element

64
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:22,339
that they were dealing with,

65
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:24,001
and just from this sphere here,

66
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:25,542
pick a value that's appropriate

67
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,203
and fake all of that lighting.

68
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:29,888
We also use flat cards.

69
00:04:30,508 --> 00:04:31,950
So when you have to walk behind objects,

70
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,572
some would be 3D in this case,

71
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:35,734
and some would be flat little shapes.

72
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:39,518
3D there, and these other pieces being totally flat.

73
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:41,700
Now, for shadow casting reasons,

74
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,502
that becomes really, really hard to work with.

75
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:47,666
Some objects would be floating above, like this,

76
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,810
and particles as well would often be flat as well.

77
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:53,851
The effect in the end looks very convincing,

78
00:04:54,372 --> 00:04:57,232
but ends up being something that's still pretty difficult

79
00:04:57,252 --> 00:04:58,793
to deal with from a production standpoint.

80
00:04:59,853 --> 00:05:02,533
On top of that, we've got this Zelda-style skew.

81
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:05,794
Zelda is a huge inspiration for Cappy

82
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:07,114
and for specifically Below.

83
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:09,095
But when you look at the structure of a level

84
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:12,196
and the world, you can see that the world itself

85
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,836
is kind of top-down, almost like a fisheye lens.

86
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:19,017
But the characters are almost perpendicular to the camera.

87
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:20,538
They are actually just pointing

88
00:05:20,558 --> 00:05:21,618
in almost the same direction.

89
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:25,999
You're not really seeing just their head as you'd be seeing in that actual reality.

90
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:30,381
For example, even in the new games where they are still skewing the character a bit towards

91
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:35,882
the camera, you still see a lot more of Link's head than you do his sides, which is very

92
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:39,144
different from what the original games looked like, which was the aesthetic that we were

93
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:40,164
going for early on.

94
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:43,725
So you can see here, you see most of Link himself.

95
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:52,449
And same for our wanderers, you see them basically pointing towards the camera, which means, in reality, our character is kind of tilted weirdly.

96
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,031
towards the camera.

97
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,633
Now, there's a lot more math going on.

98
00:05:57,074 --> 00:05:58,696
Colin Wike, who's here as well, did a talk

99
00:05:58,856 --> 00:06:01,259
on the actual rendering of how this process works.

100
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:04,042
And it's incredibly complicated, also difficult to deal with.

101
00:06:04,883 --> 00:06:06,645
But it basically means that the character

102
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:07,726
is pointing towards the camera.

103
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:09,869
Objects can also be pointing towards the camera

104
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:10,770
at different angles.

105
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,213
Avoiding your head clipping into certain objects

106
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:14,434
is incredibly difficult.

107
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:20,409
Zelda does the same thing, but their characters and objects are all at a basically similar

108
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:23,251
kind of skew so that nothing starts clipping with other elements.

109
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:24,691
Makes it more manageable.

110
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:29,294
But basically, in the end, the Zelda skew means that we've got a level that has a different

111
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:34,157
kind of perspective to it than the characters, which is highly interesting to look at.

112
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:36,779
Very unique, very different from what you normally see.

113
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,840
But in the end, where do I come in?

114
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,740
Why would I need to be there?

115
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,473
First off, Below started off mostly as a non-lit game,

116
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:46,515
with maybe a little bit of a fake light source

117
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:48,196
around the character and still really dark,

118
00:06:48,256 --> 00:06:50,639
but lighting didn't play a significant component

119
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:53,601
until they started to add in more light

120
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:55,283
and see what that does for gameplay.

121
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:57,084
For example, in this case,

122
00:06:57,105 --> 00:06:59,307
if we look at this scene without any lighting,

123
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:03,069
The gameplay is very, very different than what you'd have,

124
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:05,390
and the tone of the game is very different from what you'd have

125
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:06,811
once we add lighting back in.

126
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:10,593
This seems obvious, but it's more than just a shift of aesthetics,

127
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:12,595
it's a shift of gameplay and tone.

128
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:14,636
And that started to become more important,

129
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:16,417
but becomes really tricky to do

130
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,718
when you've got just two-dimensional assets.

131
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:21,280
when you've got cards that are supposed to fake

132
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,741
cast shadows in situations like this

133
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:26,823
real cast shadows really changes the feel

134
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:30,645
of what you're walking up to and sort of the believability and reality of that

135
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:31,105
situation

136
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:33,711
So that's where I come in.

137
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:35,632
They needed 3D to work with, so they needed

138
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:37,173
to bring on somebody with experience doing that.

139
00:07:37,393 --> 00:07:39,814
I worked in a variety of different studios,

140
00:07:39,874 --> 00:07:42,875
medium size to super small to medium again.

141
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:45,516
I've taught for about eight years in college,

142
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:47,916
teaching kids 3D art.

143
00:07:48,517 --> 00:07:50,117
And I worked at Ubisoft for about three years.

144
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:53,298
So I feel like I had a pretty good sense

145
00:07:53,378 --> 00:07:54,719
of what a proper workflow was.

146
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,159
I've had to train people in doing that

147
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,920
and had to make sure that I had a good understanding

148
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,661
of what good proper workflow was.

149
00:08:01,663 --> 00:08:04,285
And we've already got 3D in the game, basically,

150
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:06,307
is what I was told, so more should be easy,

151
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,488
which seems reasonable.

152
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:11,571
So, chapter two, what's hard is easy,

153
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,733
and what's easy is hard, or...

154
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:17,956
Basically, our workflow was a bit crazy.

155
00:08:18,276 --> 00:08:20,258
When I got there, there is no editor

156
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:21,579
in the game whatsoever.

157
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:24,101
The game itself is all you have to work with.

158
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:27,644
So, when you wanna move an asset, you can't.

159
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:32,321
You need to do it through scripting and editing and nothing that's dynamic and

160
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:32,721
immediate.

161
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:34,622
It's also a procedurally generated game.

162
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,142
No editor.

163
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:38,004
It's pretty hard to deal with when I've gotten really used to one.

164
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:41,133
So our basic process, at least for me,

165
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:43,595
was I would have to model something in Maya, fine.

166
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:45,937
Then I would have to compile it with a batch file.

167
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:48,379
That would take about 30 to several minutes.

168
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,901
Then I would have to code or script it

169
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:53,663
through text, which is, my brain doesn't do that.

170
00:08:54,504 --> 00:08:56,766
And then I would finally be able to test it in-game.

171
00:08:57,206 --> 00:08:58,647
But of course, I would have to assume

172
00:08:58,728 --> 00:09:00,429
that the object spawned in the game,

173
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:02,290
because I have to load it literally into the game,

174
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:04,112
hope that doesn't crash the game,

175
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:06,093
and that's kind of tricky to deal with.

176
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:08,055
So it starts getting a little bit harder to work with.

177
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:11,590
Now, this was the first asset that I got into the game.

178
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,754
My computer's kind of slow, so the GIFs are running not as fast as I would like,

179
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:17,136
but it gives you an idea of what I was working with.

180
00:09:17,277 --> 00:09:21,702
Now, for this object, for example, this is the Lua code that went into it,

181
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:26,447
which is lots and lots of lines of code, which, again, my artist brain,

182
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:28,009
not super used to dealing with.

183
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:29,691
And I still really like technical stuff.

184
00:09:30,913 --> 00:09:33,995
The other problem was Maya is king when it comes to our workflow.

185
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:38,559
So everything that goes into Maya is going to go directly out into the game engine and

186
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,340
I don't get to do anything in between.

187
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,824
The problem was also Maya doesn't match what I was seeing in game when I started.

188
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:50,929
Which meant, for example, in this case, on one side, on the left, I can see what I would

189
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:53,111
be seeing in game at our little skew.

190
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:57,435
And to the other side, I'm seeing what I would actually be editing inside Maya.

191
00:09:57,535 --> 00:10:00,277
Now, I could see them simultaneously, but if I tried to edit anything,

192
00:10:00,637 --> 00:10:03,260
I would immediately get an overlay of whatever I was trying to work with.

193
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,043
So I can't see the silhouettes so easily because objects are covering each other.

194
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:11,367
That would mean I would have to start shading something inside of Maya

195
00:10:11,427 --> 00:10:13,689
so that I could understand what the shapes and planes were,

196
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:17,092
so that I could hope that it would look the same in-game

197
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:19,013
because I'm just faking some lighting as well.

198
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:23,167
But if I was trying to edit it in Maya as well,

199
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:24,447
I'd be getting stuff like this, which

200
00:10:24,587 --> 00:10:26,348
becomes really confusing to deal with.

201
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,849
And on top of that, there was about 20 steps

202
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:31,489
that needed to be done inside Maya,

203
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,590
or stuff would really break down and not work.

204
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:36,691
And you'd see nothing.

205
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:39,192
So you'd export, you'd do a whole bunch of work,

206
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:42,013
you'd compile, you'd script, you'd look at it in game,

207
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:42,793
nothing would show up.

208
00:10:43,913 --> 00:10:45,834
And I would get pretty frustrated and confused and sad.

209
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:49,366
But there were valid reasons for this process.

210
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:51,487
First off, Cappy had been working with the engine

211
00:10:51,507 --> 00:10:53,127
that we were working with for a pretty long time,

212
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,128
was pretty comfortable with it.

213
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:56,829
The artists themselves are very flexible

214
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:59,050
and willing to deal with a lot of difficult stuff

215
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,791
to get an interesting result.

216
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:02,952
This was not something that I was used to.

217
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:04,193
On top of that,

218
00:11:05,128 --> 00:11:08,171
As you try to build up an interesting idea of what you're working with, you'll change

219
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:11,735
that workflow and sometimes you don't want to necessarily retool everything that you're

220
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,459
doing before you get to the actual result that you wanted.

221
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:20,105
So there were lots of good reasons to have what I felt like was a crazy workflow, but

222
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,456
it was still hard for me to deal with.

223
00:11:23,177 --> 00:11:26,038
On top of that, certain things look simple to model.

224
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:29,801
You see a mountain here, and when I would try to jump into modeling something like this,

225
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:34,684
I'd start to zoom in and see, is the shape I'm dealing with a curve or is it a bend?

226
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:38,807
Some of the shading that's implied suggests like a single plane to a surface.

227
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,408
And I'd think, well, OK, this seems a bit more complicated.

228
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:44,989
I'd have to flatten things out and do a lot more work than I was expecting.

229
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:46,149
It's fine.

230
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:48,970
But let's look at the normals of this, see

231
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,230
if we get a better idea of what the actual structure of this

232
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,651
should be with shading.

233
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:53,931
That's the normals.

234
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:59,153
I can't make one big flat plane for a huge section of a wall.

235
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:01,433
That becomes really, really difficult to deal with.

236
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:03,987
and seemingly impossible.

237
00:12:04,908 --> 00:12:07,409
So I would start to try to translate these things like this.

238
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:10,330
And this was the first version that I was dealing with.

239
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,651
Now, some surfaces get a little bit more jagged

240
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:14,752
and don't work so well.

241
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:17,233
I'd always have to flatten these big flat surfaces

242
00:12:17,273 --> 00:12:18,533
so that they look like the original.

243
00:12:19,274 --> 00:12:23,537
I don't want to be the guy that comes onto a beautiful project, integrating 3D into it,

244
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:28,860
and start making the game look significantly worse by just having a lot of angular faces

245
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,443
and things like that that don't feel as fresh and vibrant as the 2D illustrations that existed

246
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:34,044
in the first place.

247
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:39,046
And the geometry itself is fine, but nothing terribly complex.

248
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,589
And flattening out all of those surfaces

249
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:45,151
starts to become a big pain, because it's

250
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:46,312
hard to get those angles right.

251
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,053
And a lot of lattices or FFDs were

252
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,655
used to try to get that stuff to stay flat.

253
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:53,217
But minor edits become difficult to deal with.

254
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:55,879
On top of that, Below's a small game.

255
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,362
And I'm used to working with broad, stylized work,

256
00:12:59,422 --> 00:12:59,542
but...

257
00:13:00,223 --> 00:13:03,806
Below is really small, and a lot of the things that go into it

258
00:13:03,926 --> 00:13:05,948
take up only a few pixels on screen,

259
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:08,591
such as this was the first character that I was dealing with.

260
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:11,613
This was just sort of a work in progress piece

261
00:13:11,653 --> 00:13:13,875
to try to get a sense of what the design of this character would be.

262
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,957
And I thought, OK, well, it's got some detail.

263
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:16,558
It's got some shape.

264
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:17,539
It's simple, good.

265
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:20,682
Fits the style, but on screen, it's pretty small.

266
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:24,103
And if you're dealing with that, if you shrink this TV down,

267
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:26,184
that is the in-game resolution of it.

268
00:13:26,824 --> 00:13:27,784
It gets real small.

269
00:13:27,964 --> 00:13:30,405
And what happens is small little details on the character,

270
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:32,205
like the strings and straps and stuff like that,

271
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:32,885
start to flicker.

272
00:13:33,185 --> 00:13:35,126
Because if you've got anti-aliasing turned off,

273
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:38,687
which I'm switching here, things start to flicker too much,

274
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:40,448
and they don't look like consistent shapes.

275
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:41,828
They just look like little details

276
00:13:41,848 --> 00:13:43,248
that are flashing on screen.

277
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:44,689
So that doesn't work so well.

278
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,389
Up close, it starts to look good,

279
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:49,030
but then my art's not really working in-game

280
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:49,950
the way that I would hope.

281
00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:53,852
So we redesigned the character to these big, broad shapes,

282
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:56,673
something that seems a lot more manageable.

283
00:13:57,393 --> 00:14:00,494
Now, even when anti-aliased, or rather just aliased,

284
00:14:01,394 --> 00:14:02,995
it starts to look the same, looks fine.

285
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:05,035
Up close, it's a relatively simple design,

286
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:06,455
but it's got some nice impact.

287
00:14:06,836 --> 00:14:08,796
Not designed by me, but it looks good.

288
00:14:09,276 --> 00:14:10,016
So that's satisfying.

289
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:13,318
The actual modeling itself, less so.

290
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:16,499
It's a really simple model, which is fine.

291
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,560
That's what the game needs.

292
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,801
But I came into the production with a certain set of strengths

293
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:24,123
and a certain hope that I could give the project something

294
00:14:24,203 --> 00:14:24,503
useful.

295
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:26,824
And when I was working on a model like this,

296
00:14:26,864 --> 00:14:29,546
it kind of felt like, well, with the design already supplied,

297
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:30,966
almost anybody here could do this,

298
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:33,347
even with a little bit of skill in modeling

299
00:14:33,387 --> 00:14:34,588
or very little experience.

300
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:36,989
So it started to feel kind of frustrating,

301
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,230
like I wasn't actually helping out the team all that much.

302
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:45,818
On top of that, a lot of my job became just trying to translate the concept art into 3D,

303
00:14:46,478 --> 00:14:47,258
very literally.

304
00:14:47,738 --> 00:14:52,300
Because the concepts were beautiful and they worked and if I'm re-changing them too much,

305
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,140
that seems unnecessary.

306
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:56,381
All that work's already been done, I might as well just use it.

307
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,523
So for example here, that's the actual texture sheet for this piece.

308
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:05,324
It's literally just taking the concept and sticking it in and I'm just kind of putting

309
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,264
geometry on top of it.

310
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:10,769
But again, that kind of feels like almost anybody could do that, and I'm not sure that

311
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:15,374
I'm giving this project much worth, which starts to become kind of frustrating and a

312
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:15,915
little bit sad.

313
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:20,700
For me, it was all really, really different from what I've been used to, and really hard

314
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,241
to adjust to.

315
00:15:22,382 --> 00:15:26,066
Honestly, occasionally I felt like a failure, like I wasn't really supplying anything of

316
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,248
great benefit to the project.

317
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:32,176
But Cappy is incredibly optimistic, almost deliriously so.

318
00:15:32,836 --> 00:15:34,477
Certain things like painting in normals

319
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:36,797
and these crazy skews that we were working with

320
00:15:37,658 --> 00:15:40,098
would be things that I would just simply say not to do.

321
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:43,519
But they are what make the project interesting

322
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:46,640
and they are what make the visual style really incredible.

323
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,021
Their optimism is really infectious

324
00:15:50,521 --> 00:15:53,581
and something that when I kind of let it come in,

325
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:56,462
it became a lot more manageable to work with.

326
00:15:57,481 --> 00:16:00,286
because really games are not really only made in one way.

327
00:16:00,366 --> 00:16:02,910
Everybody here has dealt with different ways of making games

328
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,234
and dealt with what seem like stupid decisions,

329
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:07,978
but sometimes those are not that bad.

330
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,541
And sometimes they add charm.

331
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:13,264
So overcoming, we're getting into it.

332
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:16,766
Basically I started to try to embrace the strange,

333
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:19,467
embrace some of these seemingly stupid decisions

334
00:16:19,908 --> 00:16:22,209
because they're not stupid with context,

335
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:25,030
but they can make things difficult.

336
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,031
Now sometimes smoothing that process out helps,

337
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:30,193
but embracing it first also really alleviated

338
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:33,295
some of my frustration and sadness in a way.

339
00:16:34,643 --> 00:16:35,883
So, first off, the workflow.

340
00:16:36,184 --> 00:16:37,664
Some of it just didn't work and just got in the way

341
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:39,325
and just made things unnecessarily hard.

342
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:41,206
So things like, we got an in-game editor,

343
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,567
we got some Maya working faster,

344
00:16:43,927 --> 00:16:45,168
we got a prop scripting tool,

345
00:16:45,328 --> 00:16:47,349
useful environment shaders to speed up the process,

346
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:48,829
and I got practice.

347
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,291
By just being able to do this process more and more,

348
00:16:51,331 --> 00:16:53,011
I started to understand where we could cut corners

349
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:54,032
and start to break things up,

350
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:55,773
which you get in any situation,

351
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,934
but it's hard to guess at before you get there.

352
00:16:58,754 --> 00:17:01,235
So first off, we got our Imigui editor,

353
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,716
which was basically just some minor tools we could use

354
00:17:04,077 --> 00:17:04,937
while the game is running,

355
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:06,878
so that we could move things around,

356
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:08,659
which we couldn't do without scripting

357
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:09,739
and then reloading the level.

358
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,281
So that, hugely useful, big time saver

359
00:17:13,321 --> 00:17:14,742
and helps us understand what we're dealing with.

360
00:17:15,142 --> 00:17:16,222
On top of that, we could see

361
00:17:16,262 --> 00:17:17,623
what animation states were running,

362
00:17:17,943 --> 00:17:19,504
we could open up the script itself

363
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:20,825
by just clicking it in the game,

364
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,686
and that just kind of smoothed out some of the process

365
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:26,207
and made things a little bit more pleasing to work with.

366
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:28,715
On top of that, we got a light editor.

367
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:31,557
Normally, lights would have to be scripted outside of it

368
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:34,039
through a text editor, so you'd have to type in the location

369
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:35,240
of where a light is gonna point

370
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,541
or where it's gonna appear in the scene.

371
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:38,403
That's really hard to do.

372
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:41,225
But because lighting became more important with more 3D,

373
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:43,767
we got it in-game, and that just helps a ton.

374
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:46,028
Super simple, like in hindsight,

375
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,450
but super effective and helpful for us.

376
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,271
as well as post-process editing in-game.

377
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:54,173
All those kind of things just smooth out the process.

378
00:17:54,193 --> 00:17:55,413
They don't change things fundamentally.

379
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:57,094
We still have other hard problems,

380
00:17:57,134 --> 00:18:00,235
but makes a few things a little bit more enjoyable.

381
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,776
On top of that, changes to Maya,

382
00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:04,477
where we started to get a lot of scripting.

383
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,878
A lot of these tools, actually all of these tools

384
00:18:06,898 --> 00:18:09,279
were done by Nicholas Steven, our animator,

385
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:12,240
who learned Python and 3D while working on Below.

386
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,421
He's a crazy guy.

387
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:17,582
But basically, some of his workflow stuff

388
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:20,823
that I was able to request and get help with was basically

389
00:18:20,863 --> 00:18:24,285
being able to edit in the game view very quickly.

390
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:26,726
So he made a little window that I could see where I'm actually

391
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:28,947
seeing at the game scale how many pixels something

392
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:29,627
is going to take up.

393
00:18:30,428 --> 00:18:33,189
And being able to edit that without having

394
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:36,130
stuff blocking my vision so that I could move things around,

395
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,591
change them, and work with them.

396
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:39,292
Stuff that seems relatively simple,

397
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:41,252
but just makes for that little bit of improvement

398
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:41,933
in quality of life.

399
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:47,069
On top of that, we got things that helped some of the other artists who were being integrated

400
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:52,351
into 3D, such as a UV projector, where it would take our game view and basically project

401
00:18:52,371 --> 00:18:56,433
the UVs so that an artist would be able to send that out to Photoshop and just paint

402
00:18:56,674 --> 00:18:57,234
a background.

403
00:18:57,914 --> 00:19:02,136
Now changes to those backgrounds would then become a problem later on, but that's where

404
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:04,177
useful shader changes can happen.

405
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:05,418
So for a scene like this.

406
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:08,619
These scenes are usually loaded into streaming memory.

407
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,919
So they're a lot more manageable and faster to load in

408
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:12,100
than we would normally be working with.

409
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,040
So 3D assets, for what I was trying to work with,

410
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,861
load in slower and load in a little bit heavier

411
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:18,701
because they can't stream.

412
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:20,661
Which meant a room like this,

413
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:23,942
I would want to go as low as possible on my texture memory.

414
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:27,923
But I would also want to have all of the color changes.

415
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:30,003
There's light shading that's been put into this

416
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:30,983
in the concept itself.

417
00:19:31,163 --> 00:19:32,644
And I would want to maintain some of that.

418
00:19:32,764 --> 00:19:35,184
Again, I don't want to reduce the quality of these scenes.

419
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:37,906
But that's a lot of texture work to do.

420
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:39,767
And any kind of changes, if I just hand paint this,

421
00:19:39,827 --> 00:19:41,007
become awkward.

422
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:43,708
So if I wanted to make a room like this

423
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:46,789
with new texture settings, one of the things that we got

424
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:49,970
was I can model out a scene now where normally,

425
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,031
to get texture on it, I would have to create

426
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:53,151
a big, complicated atlas.

427
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:58,714
of just various color values with texture incorporated into them so that I could block

428
00:19:58,794 --> 00:20:01,596
out big broad colors and so that they would have texture in them.

429
00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:06,438
But planning these is a lot of work and you can see here in this one for example, there's

430
00:20:06,478 --> 00:20:10,140
a big empty space that's really not being used and there's even a bit of concept art

431
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,320
in it because it just wasn't being used.

432
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,121
That's a huge waste.

433
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:16,802
So, the thing that we ended up doing was getting a much smaller kind of texture that we can

434
00:20:16,822 --> 00:20:18,883
put in of just color values and gradients.

435
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:24,625
I can apply that to the background, just UVing it in, and then we'd get some basic shape

436
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:25,726
form, which works.

437
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:27,466
Then when lighting's put in...

438
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:32,162
It starts to look a little bit more like what the original concept would be and the kind

439
00:20:32,182 --> 00:20:33,322
of style that was being used.

440
00:20:34,142 --> 00:20:39,264
Then I can use vertex colors multiplied on top to basically add in just a little bit

441
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:42,984
of the painterly effects that would be used by the artists where they could darken out

442
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:46,165
certain edges or brighten up certain ones, have soft transitions.

443
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:51,667
And then finally UV project on some actual texture into it if you can see it there.

444
00:20:53,304 --> 00:20:54,805
Basically, just a little bit of texture work

445
00:20:54,846 --> 00:20:57,308
that can be applied in, in the exact same kind of style

446
00:20:57,348 --> 00:20:59,169
that was originally being used for the concepts.

447
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,211
And then we end up with something that's much closer,

448
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:03,353
but also, any edits that I make to this

449
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:04,675
are super easy to do.

450
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:07,623
We also got things like a prop scripter,

451
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:09,544
which meant complicated assets,

452
00:21:09,664 --> 00:21:10,785
I could press a bunch of buttons

453
00:21:11,065 --> 00:21:12,507
and a script would come out the other end.

454
00:21:12,527 --> 00:21:14,689
That doesn't mean that I don't have to script anymore

455
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:16,390
because it doesn't hit all our edge cases

456
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,891
and we have a lot of edge cases,

457
00:21:18,592 --> 00:21:20,233
but it means that the workflow

458
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:21,574
becomes a little bit more manageable

459
00:21:21,735 --> 00:21:23,836
and I feel like I can do a bit more with the art

460
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:26,699
and we can integrate more artists into the process

461
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:27,579
a little bit easier.

462
00:21:28,941 --> 00:21:30,262
As well, NGONs.

463
00:21:31,002 --> 00:21:31,143
Now.

464
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,765
Because I've been teaching people art for about eight years, I have a specific mentality

465
00:21:38,785 --> 00:21:40,146
about how things should be done.

466
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,088
And things like n-gons you generally want to avoid.

467
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:45,610
You don't want to have too many because that can change what your shading is going to be

468
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,532
in game when you send it out.

469
00:21:48,152 --> 00:21:50,935
The triangulation can get all screwed up and not quite be the way you want.

470
00:21:51,415 --> 00:21:51,595
So...

471
00:21:53,008 --> 00:21:55,329
When I wanted shading like this, it'd be really, really hard to get,

472
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:57,430
because I'd have to flatten out all my surfaces.

473
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,373
But what I realized at one point was I could remove edges and just

474
00:22:01,413 --> 00:22:05,675
have big, horrible, hideous n-gons of varying shapes and dimensions.

475
00:22:06,295 --> 00:22:08,857
And it would render like a flat surface, because.

476
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:15,121
For whatever reason, in Maya and in game, that would just render like a flat surface,

477
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:19,323
and none of the in-between triangles would get rendered or calculated in the normals.

478
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:25,827
So big, flat surfaces could be rendered with crazy actual geometry if you look at it from

479
00:22:25,848 --> 00:22:30,250
the side, but for me, in the end result, it would look the same as if I'd done a lot more

480
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,251
work than I actually had to.

481
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:34,933
Plus, any edits to this become a lot more manageable, and things don't have to stay

482
00:22:35,013 --> 00:22:35,814
flat and be difficult.

483
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:40,536
On top of that, I started to discover something that was really fun and interesting that I

484
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:42,999
didn't expect, which was basically 3D pixel art.

485
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,582
The art that I'm making doesn't get actually converted into pixels, and I don't get to

486
00:22:47,622 --> 00:22:51,325
paint over any pixels, but the 3D art basically will only take up about...

487
00:22:52,547 --> 00:22:53,928
36 pixels on screen in some cases.

488
00:22:53,968 --> 00:22:56,791
These are small little cabbages and turnips and flowers

489
00:22:57,212 --> 00:22:58,093
that'll exist in the game.

490
00:22:58,153 --> 00:23:00,816
And I had to make them to fit really small on screen.

491
00:23:01,457 --> 00:23:04,180
So they had to be really broad and big and bold.

492
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:06,763
And being able to have some of the tools

493
00:23:06,783 --> 00:23:09,045
to be able to see that makes my job a lot easier.

494
00:23:09,946 --> 00:23:11,327
In reality, the models are awful.

495
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:13,068
They do not look good up close.

496
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:15,690
They're janky and they've got like holes between them.

497
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,473
But because they don't rotate, I can get away with a lot.

498
00:23:19,073 --> 00:23:21,655
And I don't need to necessarily get super precious about the

499
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:22,636
kind of art that I'm making.

500
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:25,298
But I can start to find the fact that they only take up a

501
00:23:25,358 --> 00:23:28,740
small number of pixels on screen really interesting in a

502
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,042
strange way that I would not have expected or thought that

503
00:23:31,062 --> 00:23:31,543
I would enjoy.

504
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:34,390
in game you can barely see them.

505
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,831
They're tiny little objects right here in the center

506
00:23:37,371 --> 00:23:39,333
where they don't take up a lot of space,

507
00:23:39,373 --> 00:23:41,114
but their shapes have to be big and bold,

508
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:43,015
bolder than I'd ever dealt with before

509
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,536
and way simpler than I'd ever have to dealt with,

510
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:47,177
ever have to have dealt with.

511
00:23:48,338 --> 00:23:51,000
On top of that, finding new challenges

512
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,962
and stepping out of what I thought was my intended role.

513
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:56,483
For me coming onto the project, it felt like,

514
00:23:56,523 --> 00:23:58,564
okay, Dan, you're the guy that's supposed to add 3D

515
00:23:58,604 --> 00:23:59,925
to the game and you're an experienced 3D guy,

516
00:23:59,945 --> 00:24:00,846
so you better be good at it.

517
00:24:02,422 --> 00:24:06,624
But at certain points, we'd start to hit some roadblocks, things that needed some extra

518
00:24:06,844 --> 00:24:11,225
thought or care or just specific extra help, such as this area.

519
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:15,206
I'm not showing anything else around it, but you saw it in the trailer.

520
00:24:15,607 --> 00:24:19,288
This was an area that I worked on that I had a lot of design input on, where we were trying

521
00:24:19,308 --> 00:24:22,489
to figure out what the setup and mechanics would be for this area.

522
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:24,730
And we weren't quite sure where to go with it.

523
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:29,274
So I basically just requested to take it on and handle it.

524
00:24:29,954 --> 00:24:31,275
So the enemies, their design,

525
00:24:31,335 --> 00:24:32,416
and most of the things that involved

526
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:33,897
in whatever's around here,

527
00:24:35,218 --> 00:24:36,739
is a lot of my work in a way

528
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:37,840
that I would not have expected.

529
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,682
And was extremely satisfying to do,

530
00:24:41,122 --> 00:24:43,344
to just kind of step out of what I thought was my role.

531
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:46,486
Even to the point of, in many cases,

532
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:50,269
creating Excel sheets, which I don't like.

533
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:55,106
But I start to learn some really interesting things from doing them, in a totally different

534
00:24:55,126 --> 00:25:00,449
way that may be completely inappropriate for my career, maybe, but is fun and interesting

535
00:25:00,469 --> 00:25:03,450
and satisfying to learn when you kind of embrace jumping into something else.

536
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:09,053
On top of that, our procedural generation works for certain areas but doesn't in others.

537
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:14,996
So for caves and areas like that where it's organic, some of the way our objects get placed

538
00:25:15,156 --> 00:25:15,376
works.

539
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:18,331
But for places like this where we need structure,

540
00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:20,914
totally random generation doesn't necessarily

541
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:21,915
give us the results we want.

542
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:23,818
This area looks a little bit too barren.

543
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:26,701
So my first thought was, OK, well, make more stuff,

544
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:27,883
walls and things like that.

545
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,406
When it generates in-game, though, it

546
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,989
ends up being kind of like a cluttered room,

547
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,731
as opposed to something that looked

548
00:25:34,751 --> 00:25:35,692
like it once had structure.

549
00:25:36,594 --> 00:25:39,236
And so in that case, I end up trying to go, OK, well,

550
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:42,019
without just coming up with new generation rules,

551
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,840
because that's really going to set us back in other areas,

552
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:45,221
what can I do?

553
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:47,603
And in this case, just taking large sections

554
00:25:47,643 --> 00:25:50,306
of generated areas and just hand modeling out

555
00:25:50,346 --> 00:25:53,028
large chunks of them so that we get that structure,

556
00:25:53,488 --> 00:25:55,730
so that things look like something makes sense.

557
00:25:56,696 --> 00:25:59,982
takes quite a bit more work, something that I would normally say, no, like, we should

558
00:26:00,002 --> 00:26:00,563
do it smarter.

559
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,667
But sometimes smart's not interesting.

560
00:26:03,147 --> 00:26:05,492
And sometimes smart isn't always smart.

561
00:26:05,512 --> 00:26:06,834
It's just fast.

562
00:26:07,962 --> 00:26:11,705
On top of that, training the team, an extremely satisfying thing that I was able to do.

563
00:26:11,965 --> 00:26:16,428
This is a checklist of the things that we have to do when putting something into the

564
00:26:16,468 --> 00:26:17,309
game through Maya.

565
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,411
It's about 10 steps, it used to be 20.

566
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:23,934
But each one of them, at least we can check off to help make sure that the team, when

567
00:26:23,954 --> 00:26:26,796
they're trying to learn a new piece of software and learn how to get stuff in, they don't

568
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:30,059
forget one of the integral steps, because if you miss one, it won't show up.

569
00:26:31,212 --> 00:26:32,313
And those kind of things were helpful.

570
00:26:32,573 --> 00:26:33,893
They helped me better understand

571
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:34,873
what our problem points were,

572
00:26:34,953 --> 00:26:36,414
and they helped the team better be able

573
00:26:36,434 --> 00:26:38,094
to integrate into a new process.

574
00:26:39,035 --> 00:26:41,235
As well, something I started getting really used to

575
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:42,116
was creating videos.

576
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:45,357
Where basically I could just record an entire video

577
00:26:45,497 --> 00:26:46,577
of what the process was,

578
00:26:46,597 --> 00:26:48,077
narrate and just talk through it,

579
00:26:48,658 --> 00:26:50,458
so that when our guys were jumping into 3D

580
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:51,158
for the first time,

581
00:26:51,198 --> 00:26:52,899
that they could understand what the steps were,

582
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:56,080
and how to best understand how to get stuff into the game

583
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,961
and have it look appropriate for style.

584
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:05,229
The thing I started to really discover was to embrace some of that unpleasant discomfort,

585
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:09,410
those moments of failure and those things where you feel like you're not doing what

586
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,670
you should be doing or even doing anything worthwhile.

587
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,232
One thing that I found actually while I was doing this talk was this TED Talk on how frustration

588
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:18,212
can make us more creative.

589
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:23,633
And Ted Harford covers some really interesting scientific studies on people dealing with

590
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:25,614
frustration and how that can lead to better results.

591
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:31,136
For example, a study was done where a group of friends would have to solve some puzzles,

592
00:27:31,636 --> 00:27:35,598
multiple choice in this case, and they could work on it together. And they did pretty good.

593
00:27:36,158 --> 00:27:39,859
And then another group would have to deal with a few friends, but also some strangers in that group.

594
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:45,261
And what ended up happening was they did much better, much better, than the group of just

595
00:27:45,321 --> 00:27:50,223
friends. The problem was the group of friends felt like they did a really good job. They were

596
00:27:50,303 --> 00:27:52,684
amped up about it. They thought they did great. They didn't.

597
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:56,609
The other group thought that they did poorly, but actually did great.

598
00:27:57,729 --> 00:28:01,811
Which was something that I was feeling through the entire process on below, which was not

599
00:28:01,851 --> 00:28:06,854
feeling like I'm actually doing something beneficial or useful, but that might not always

600
00:28:06,874 --> 00:28:07,314
be the case.

601
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:12,330
The thing I started to find was to avoid my own box.

602
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:14,771
The box I create around my processes,

603
00:28:14,831 --> 00:28:16,492
the things that I think are the right way to do stuff.

604
00:28:17,592 --> 00:28:19,053
And sometimes just stepping out of that

605
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:21,874
into something bigger allows you to make something interesting.

606
00:28:22,514 --> 00:28:23,815
Even if it feels like you're doing something

607
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,116
that you thought was stupid or thought makes no sense

608
00:28:27,336 --> 00:28:29,177
because it's just going to lead to problems later.

609
00:28:29,937 --> 00:28:31,698
means that you're making something maybe interesting.

610
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:34,038
Sometimes you've got to find that optimism,

611
00:28:34,878 --> 00:28:36,998
that little bit that's going to give you a reason

612
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:40,379
to keep doing it and just rush into a naive idea.

613
00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:43,800
Because Below and many of the games that Cabbie makes

614
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:48,361
are beautiful, and they have a beautiful innocence to them

615
00:28:48,821 --> 00:28:52,121
where they don't care that maybe something might be crazy,

616
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:53,742
because sometimes that craziness

617
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,162
makes things much more interesting.

618
00:28:56,842 --> 00:28:57,062
Thank you.

619
00:29:07,023 --> 00:29:10,104
I'm at 29 minutes, so I don't think

620
00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:15,046
there's time for questions.

621
00:29:15,146 --> 00:29:15,887
If there's a question.

622
00:29:17,587 --> 00:29:19,968
Up there, okay, yeah, so we're done.

623
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:23,630
But if you want, I can go to the wrap up room,

624
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,651
or we can chat here before the next talk starts.

625
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:27,231
Yeah, thank you guys very much.
