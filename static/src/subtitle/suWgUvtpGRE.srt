1
00:00:05,202 --> 00:00:05,882
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:09,065
So today, I'm going to be talking to you

3
00:00:09,205 --> 00:00:10,245
about freelancing.

4
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:13,728
The way I do my talks is I prepare my slides.

5
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:15,369
I sort of practice them a bit, but I don't actually

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:15,990
create a script.

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,011
So I may go off script, or who knows,

8
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:19,212
or I may forget what I'm talking about,

9
00:00:19,312 --> 00:00:20,173
and it'll be a disaster.

10
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:21,594
So we'll see how it goes.

11
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:24,216
So the title of my talk is Freelancing,

12
00:00:24,716 --> 00:00:26,658
How to Live the Dream and Avoid the Nightmare,

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:29,760
which is some terms I'm going to be interrogating and looking

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,661
into a bit throughout.

15
00:00:31,684 --> 00:00:33,645
My name is Greg Buchanan, and I'm a writer.

16
00:00:33,885 --> 00:00:37,126
So some of my slides and some of what I'm going to say

17
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:40,126
will be slightly from the perspective of game writing.

18
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:42,167
So your mileage may vary in other disciplines.

19
00:00:42,547 --> 00:00:43,847
But as far as possible, I've tried

20
00:00:43,907 --> 00:00:46,528
to make it agnostic to those concerns

21
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:50,089
and make it broader, drawing on several friends of mine

22
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:52,730
who are in other disciplines as well to see about applicability.

23
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,990
So first, who am I?

24
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,711
Some of you may know who I am, some of you may not.

25
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,451
It just says independent next to my name.

26
00:00:58,631 --> 00:00:59,332
So what have I done?

27
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:02,344
So this is why I'm talking about freelancing.

28
00:01:02,944 --> 00:01:06,006
So I've written over 20 games between 2015 to 2019,

29
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:09,848
the majority of which were work-for-hire freelance contracts

30
00:01:10,068 --> 00:01:13,851
across indie, AAA, VR, mobile,

31
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:16,572
like all the different types of writing and projects you could do.

32
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:21,455
So one of my earliest ones was a political game called Paper Brexit,

33
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:22,836
which was just by myself.

34
00:01:23,577 --> 00:01:26,078
One of the more high-profile things I've worked on was the...

35
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:27,039
Sorry.

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,740
Oh, oh, oh, oh, great.

37
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:34,891
And a 30-hour story campaign for No Man's Sky, Atlas Rises.

38
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:38,033
So this was like a big story that was added to the game after release

39
00:01:38,753 --> 00:01:42,795
and added like a huge narrative to it and several other updates.

40
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:46,016
And I've also, for example, worked on additional writing support for games

41
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:48,257
such as Metro Exodus quite recently.

42
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:51,878
So lots of different games, and you can find out more online about my work.

43
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,260
Before that, I've also had some background in academia.

44
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,962
I did a PhD in identification and ethics in novels and video games.

45
00:02:00,397 --> 00:02:04,941
I've been in various list-type things, like Forbes 30 Under 30 this year.

46
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:06,342
Just, just.

47
00:02:06,362 --> 00:02:09,624
I was about two weeks off turning 30, which I now am, so snuck in.

48
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:11,846
And another list.

49
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:14,929
And I'm also now an author, as of quite recently as well.

50
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:21,494
So my debut novel, 16 Horses, was recently bought in a deal by Macmillan, and will be

51
00:02:21,534 --> 00:02:22,835
published across the world in 2021.

52
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,756
So that's very exciting as well.

53
00:02:25,777 --> 00:02:27,819
I'm also known, and some of you may know me for this reason.

54
00:02:28,696 --> 00:02:31,077
for tweeting advice about the games industry

55
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:32,237
and game writing in particular.

56
00:02:33,137 --> 00:02:34,718
So you can see my Twitter at the bottom.

57
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,559
I tend to tweet about games things a lot.

58
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:40,140
And I also have a guide that I update game writing

59
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,060
and maybe expand to other things as well.

60
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:45,642
So that's the backdrop on which I'm giving you advice.

61
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:48,162
So what I will be talking about today.

62
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:50,343
One thing I'll be talking about,

63
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:51,724
which is probably why some of you are here,

64
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,444
is about strategies for getting work

65
00:02:53,524 --> 00:02:55,345
and how to think of yourself as getting work.

66
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:56,905
What's the overriding principles you follow?

67
00:02:57,484 --> 00:02:59,545
So I've successfully freelanced on a lot of games

68
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,466
and made a living with that,

69
00:03:00,506 --> 00:03:02,287
so that's why I'm able to give that advice.

70
00:03:03,588 --> 00:03:04,869
Why did I choose to freelance?

71
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,892
So I was awkward and liked to be free,

72
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:09,773
hence the term freelance.

73
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:12,836
Now this has a kind of positive and negative aspect to it

74
00:03:12,956 --> 00:03:15,498
as the talk will discuss and as I'll go on to in a moment.

75
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,901
I'll be talking about the dream of a freelance lifestyle.

76
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:19,561
So it sounds great.

77
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:21,963
You can work from home, you can travel the world and work,

78
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:23,804
you can work on loads of projects,

79
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:25,366
you can build a portfolio very fast.

80
00:03:25,386 --> 00:03:26,266
So it sounds really good.

81
00:03:27,386 --> 00:03:30,528
There's also some weird inverted nightmare realities of being a freelancer.

82
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:31,529
So it's not great.

83
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:34,051
It's actually all those things are actually kind of terrible at the same time.

84
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:37,793
And there's a kind of bad side to a lot of stuff that sounds initially good.

85
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:41,276
And also talking about emotional well-being strategies.

86
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:44,318
So every bad dream is manageable and is just a bad dream.

87
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:50,442
And I'll also be talking about survival mode and my definition of survival mode as BITS

88
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:50,983
freelancers.

89
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:53,445
So how you can get through kind of.

90
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,824
bad times as a freelancer and how you can keep going.

91
00:03:58,145 --> 00:04:00,827
So I'm going to start with this, and this is going to be linked

92
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:01,667
into throughout the talk.

93
00:04:01,727 --> 00:04:04,930
This is my rough pitch for how I think of myself

94
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,651
and how I try to get jobs in the industry.

95
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:09,053
And I'm very happy to expand about this after.

96
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,334
And I did a little mini Twitter thread already,

97
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:13,776
which I'll retweet about where I go into more detail

98
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,477
than I will now about this particular point.

99
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:20,813
Beyond what I've just put up on the thing,

100
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:21,893
I'm just gonna say something first.

101
00:04:22,694 --> 00:04:24,335
None of this will work unless you're actually able

102
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,936
to do what you want to do.

103
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:28,618
So you have to actually be able to write to become a writer.

104
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:31,079
You have to be a proficient artist to get an art gig.

105
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,900
You have to know how to code to be a programmer.

106
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,342
So if you don't have the sufficient skills there,

107
00:04:35,502 --> 00:04:36,643
it may be difficult to get jobs.

108
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,264
However, as we all know, some people are able to get jobs

109
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:41,866
who may not be the absolute top of their field,

110
00:04:41,926 --> 00:04:43,707
but they have other assets that are able to help them,

111
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:45,548
which is a useful thing to think about

112
00:04:45,608 --> 00:04:46,589
when you're trying to get gigs,

113
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:48,710
as presumably very talented people in your own right.

114
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:55,334
So, I did a tweet on Twitter a while back where I said something to the effect of,

115
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:58,276
if you don't talk about what you do, no one will know you're doing it.

116
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:02,600
This, at its root, is not always true.

117
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,903
We know of situations where people can be lucky enough or have networks enough

118
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:09,826
that they are broadcast or they produced something so good that it's...

119
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:14,792
Captured the hearts of many but we also know of projects that are really good that didn't get the attention

120
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:18,214
They deserved games that were really well written or well developed

121
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:21,916
That just didn't get out there as much as what you might see as more mediocre titles

122
00:05:22,296 --> 00:05:25,859
There is not a direct correlation between talent and people knowing about talent

123
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:31,082
Which is a key thing you have to solve as a freelancer because you aren't selling yourself on the basis to a small number of

124
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:35,745
People in a room in an interview once you are ongoing selling yourself to loads of different projects

125
00:05:36,605 --> 00:05:37,686
throughout the year

126
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:41,457
So people have to know who you are in some respect.

127
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:43,898
Now I say here somehow promote yourself

128
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:46,139
because there are many ways of doing this

129
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:48,760
which you might be comfortable with one more than the other.

130
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,181
And people often claim that they don't self-promote

131
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:53,662
themselves and that's either because they've defined it

132
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:55,682
very specifically or they're being disingenuous.

133
00:05:57,643 --> 00:05:59,664
So here are some ways in which some people

134
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:00,304
might self-promote.

135
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:03,945
They might have a website where they have their projects

136
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:05,286
listed and some of their skills.

137
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:07,136
They'll have a business card.

138
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:09,937
They might attend events like this one right now, GDC.

139
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:11,998
This is a networking event where you can meet people

140
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,858
and find out new opportunities.

141
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,759
People might have an active social media presence

142
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:18,240
where you discuss things online,

143
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,521
you join in communities, you do that.

144
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:22,781
Now, some people...

145
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,682
will tweet all the time about projects they've worked on

146
00:06:26,722 --> 00:06:27,763
and try and spread the news.

147
00:06:28,283 --> 00:06:31,185
Some people will hardly ever have expressed themselves

148
00:06:31,245 --> 00:06:32,986
in that kind of presence or that kind of venue,

149
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:35,268
but they will in person be going to networking events

150
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,350
or be in circles or know people that will get them work.

151
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,232
They are doing something to be known by the people who hire.

152
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:44,074
Because otherwise, if you analyze it,

153
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:45,975
whatever the discourse is about self-promotion,

154
00:06:45,995 --> 00:06:47,676
it doesn't make sense that someone would hire you

155
00:06:47,716 --> 00:06:48,857
if they have no idea who you are.

156
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:51,919
That's a causal, no relationship there.

157
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:57,696
So thinking about the way in which you're comfortable doing this and the way in which you can best do this is a really important thing.

158
00:06:58,457 --> 00:06:59,817
And privilege will also affect this.

159
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:05,922
So geographically where you're located, certain other things about yourself may make some of these strategies more or less easy.

160
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:09,845
So I would always advise never looking down on other people who do different methods to you,

161
00:07:09,865 --> 00:07:12,887
because they may have to, as opposed to the things you do.

162
00:07:14,974 --> 00:07:19,156
Beyond this, an idea which I would class on to self-promotion is knowing how to hunt gigs

163
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:20,857
and when to chase emails and opportunities.

164
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:25,460
So knowing the venues where things are advertised or discussed within your discipline.

165
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,623
For example, for game writing, there's a Facebook group about game writing, jobs are routinely

166
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:32,584
posted on Twitter.

167
00:07:33,164 --> 00:07:36,326
Loads of other disciplines as well will have different areas or different places where

168
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:40,248
people discuss things, meet-up groups for disciplines, and so on.

169
00:07:41,304 --> 00:07:43,324
Also knowing when to chase emails and opportunities.

170
00:07:43,605 --> 00:07:45,825
Loads of people I know who are talented and miss out on gigs

171
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:46,926
because they don't follow up.

172
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:49,567
So they'll apply for something and they'll never hear back.

173
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:51,268
And then that's the end of it for them.

174
00:07:51,908 --> 00:07:53,228
Whereas you shouldn't be afraid of,

175
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,009
if you wait a polite two or three weeks

176
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,330
after you've sent in an application,

177
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,211
if you don't hear anything back, send a chase up email.

178
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,311
Being polite, not harassing them or anything.

179
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:02,892
And you tend to get a sense of how to do this,

180
00:08:02,952 --> 00:08:04,173
of being like, hi, I noticed,

181
00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:06,554
I was just wondering what the status of this application is.

182
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,014
Could you tell me more?

183
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:09,895
If there's anything else I can provide, let me know.

184
00:08:11,348 --> 00:08:13,872
This will often get you an opportunity that you might have missed otherwise,

185
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:17,337
just because for game jobs, you might get 200, 300 applications,

186
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:19,139
and things can get lost in the cracks.

187
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:23,806
Likewise, as a way of thinking about obtaining gigs,

188
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:27,191
you want to build portfolios that can be appreciated by non-specialists.

189
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,002
Those hiring for roles, particularly in freelance,

190
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,745
often have very little expertise

191
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:33,946
in the discipline they're hiring for.

192
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:35,407
This is especially true of writing,

193
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,289
but is often the case for other things as well.

194
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,671
They'll have some knowledge enough to discuss with you,

195
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:41,293
but they won't know as much as you do.

196
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:42,134
That's why they're hiring you.

197
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:44,196
You're the expert who has the skill that they don't have.

198
00:08:45,397 --> 00:08:47,699
So by building portfolios that can be appreciated

199
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:49,681
by non-specialists, you have to try and think

200
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:52,023
of the mentality of those people hiring you,

201
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,665
and you can learn this through trial and error.

202
00:08:54,276 --> 00:08:58,018
If you're ever in the position to help hire for a job, try and get involved or at least sit in,

203
00:08:58,058 --> 00:09:03,141
because it gives you such a mindset, an insight into that mindset that will alter how you then pitch yourself.

204
00:09:04,662 --> 00:09:08,844
So a key principle is reducing ambiguity that you will be able to do what you were being hired to do.

205
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:16,408
So people often ask, like, I'm an amazing writer, I'm an amazing singer, I'm an amazing voiceover artist,

206
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:18,309
I'm an amazing animator, all these things.

207
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:24,046
produce many projects, there's an understandable ambiguity that you'll be able to deliver,

208
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,407
even if you can show the skills.

209
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:28,629
They don't know if you've worked in the kind of environment that they work in, they don't

210
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:32,751
know if you're reliable with deadlines, they don't know if you know the compromises required

211
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:34,992
in game development to work through multiple types of project.

212
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:40,915
So if you reduce that ambiguity and you're somehow able to convince people, limit risk

213
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:44,417
in hiring you, that's a great thing to do and there's quite a few different ways of

214
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:44,817
doing this.

215
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,321
For example, I advise people having a range of samples

216
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,642
for a variety of gig types and studio sizes.

217
00:09:51,282 --> 00:09:53,623
So for example, in game writing,

218
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:56,924
people might have, an early mistake is people have

219
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:59,745
portfolios of very highly branching, dense,

220
00:09:59,985 --> 00:10:01,666
complex, interactive fiction.

221
00:10:02,346 --> 00:10:04,387
People designing games that have kind of a very

222
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:08,688
strange mechanic, or kind of very specific feature set.

223
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:11,309
And then trying to go to like massive AAA companies

224
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:14,790
with a portfolio type that is nothing like they produce.

225
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:20,568
And so thinking about the kind of stuff you're applying for and having things that is very useful those of you in the audience

226
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:25,972
Who already are freelancing or already have worked in games because this is range. This is aimed at all levels

227
00:10:27,113 --> 00:10:29,735
Trying to think about how you can diversify that portfolio

228
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:35,959
I'd work on projects different to those that might be like your dream project are really useful and when your early career trying to perhaps

229
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:40,903
We do different types in that regard is really good. So for example if you want to make really kind of

230
00:10:41,563 --> 00:10:42,784
tragic dramatic

231
00:10:43,785 --> 00:10:44,766
Emotional games

232
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:49,209
That's great, but apply for other types of games as well,

233
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,571
especially early career.

234
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:51,853
Get that diverse portfolio.

235
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:54,316
Get a portfolio that makes it look like you will be trusted

236
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:57,000
to do lots of different types of tasks, rather than just one.

237
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:04,157
And finally, and this is a very important thing, possibly more important even than pure talent,

238
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:07,620
is suggesting you'll be good to work with and you'll be able to work in a team.

239
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,523
In games specifically, this is hugely important because it's often producers who hire you,

240
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:16,246
who are about working and establishing good team cohesion.

241
00:11:19,102 --> 00:11:21,283
the greatest writer in the world wouldn't necessarily get a job,

242
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:23,964
but a very good writer who is good to work with will get the job

243
00:11:24,044 --> 00:11:25,705
when that greatest writer wouldn't get that job.

244
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:30,506
And being able to demonstrate that and prove that is a very useful thing to do.

245
00:11:30,926 --> 00:11:34,188
So obviously interviews and your communications,

246
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:35,808
you'll come across a certain way with them,

247
00:11:35,888 --> 00:11:37,829
so not being too insistent in chasing up stuff,

248
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:39,229
but chasing up stuff in a friendly manner.

249
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,330
If you're ever asked in an interview,

250
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,551
do you have any questions, always have a question.

251
00:11:44,831 --> 00:11:46,252
It just makes it seem like you're listening more.

252
00:11:47,262 --> 00:11:49,404
and engaging with the material that they're discussing with you.

253
00:11:50,604 --> 00:11:53,846
If you have worked in any kind of team, which you should be if you're applying for jobs,

254
00:11:54,046 --> 00:12:01,311
so even game jams or any kind of free group task like that where anyone can join, do it.

255
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:03,632
Try and get some sense that you've worked in teams.

256
00:12:03,712 --> 00:12:06,514
Communicate the kinds of teams you've worked with and the kind of roles you've worked with.

257
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,715
As soon as you have paid work or kind of...

258
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:12,105
projects that have come out or student projects or whatever, try and get some

259
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:15,867
testimonials from people you've worked with and put them on your website. That

260
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:19,568
will be a sort of, that would be incredibly useful for communicating

261
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:22,209
these factors about you and often it's also quite nice for your kind of self

262
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:26,010
care to see what people, nice things people have said about you as well. So

263
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,591
those are two ways of bolstering these principles and we can return to this

264
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:32,713
later and I'm very happy afterwards to discuss with people about their own

265
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:35,253
stuff how to further address these things.

266
00:12:37,064 --> 00:12:42,005
Now, I want to discuss motivations many freelancers may have for freelancing in the first place.

267
00:12:42,986 --> 00:12:45,547
So, some people may freelance out of necessity.

268
00:12:46,107 --> 00:12:48,808
There may be no available in-house roles that they would rather do.

269
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:52,569
They'd rather be a full-time staff member somewhere, but it's not, so they need to apply for other jobs.

270
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:54,110
It may be due to layoffs.

271
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:58,211
So the games industry, particularly over the last year, has experienced a lot of layoffs from a lot of big companies.

272
00:12:58,351 --> 00:13:03,053
People may have to freelance for short periods of time when it may not be their desired thing in order to pay rent.

273
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:05,284
And others may just have gaps in the career

274
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:07,306
between larger gigs that they'd rather do

275
00:13:07,846 --> 00:13:08,947
and want to find work in between.

276
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:13,231
Some may, for example, freelance because their early career.

277
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:15,854
So a lot of game applications will say,

278
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:17,295
you must have five years experience.

279
00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:19,017
So for this, it's like, how do you

280
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:22,320
build that five years experience if you don't have any work?

281
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,562
So you freelance is often a solution.

282
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,584
Why I chose to freelance.

283
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:31,300
Part of it is my disposition, and this may apply to some other people as well.

284
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,261
I valued the ability to control my time and workflow as much as I could.

285
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:37,322
Others are not so.

286
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:45,585
Others really like kind of ongoing rigidity and kind of safety net and security of certain

287
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:48,906
in-house structures, which can often really enable people's creativity and free them from

288
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:50,547
a lot of worries that you might have here.

289
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:53,848
Whereas I wanted other things in this regard.

290
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:57,723
There were certain issues about security for me.

291
00:13:58,623 --> 00:14:04,046
So it's often presented that in-house jobs are more secure and safer than freelance work

292
00:14:04,186 --> 00:14:06,547
in terms of your earning flow.

293
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:10,449
But as we've seen in the last year, and especially in different parts of the world with different

294
00:14:10,489 --> 00:14:13,030
laws about employment, you can often be let go at the drop of a hat.

295
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,691
It's not as secure as it looks.

296
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:20,553
Likewise, there's a sense of security that's emotional as well, for me at least, in terms

297
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,974
of the idea that instead of one boss could...

298
00:14:24,954 --> 00:14:30,040
have vast power over my emotional life day to day, as happens in any workplace, I'd rather

299
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,846
distribute that and have multiple bosses, which makes me more of a force in what I can do in my own space.

300
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:44,522
Likewise, there's an ambitious aspect, so I wanted to learn fast and efficiently and make my own projects as much as possible.

301
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:49,744
So if I was to be in-house at some of these studios, I would have worked for three or four years on one project,

302
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:55,047
which is amazing as an experience, but I wanted more breadth.

303
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,567
I wanted to try lots of different things.

304
00:14:56,668 --> 00:15:00,589
That's how my mind works, and that's something I value and want to do creatively,

305
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,730
and it's helped me and benefited me going forward.

306
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,071
So talking about the alleged dreams of freelancing,

307
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:08,493
so pros of freelancing that people discuss.

308
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:10,534
Organizational.

309
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:12,175
So you might get to be your own boss,

310
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:14,557
get to organize your own time.

311
00:15:16,018 --> 00:15:18,299
Insurance against mass layoffs of particular companies.

312
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:20,480
So if you've got loads and loads of jobs lined up,

313
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:23,322
then it doesn't matter if one contract cancels with you

314
00:15:23,362 --> 00:15:24,483
because you've got others.

315
00:15:25,804 --> 00:15:27,885
It may be very bad in the short term,

316
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:29,987
but you've distributed your work time.

317
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:33,214
greater freedom from internal politics and crunch.

318
00:15:33,354 --> 00:15:35,075
So because you're a contractor,

319
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:36,337
you have a business relationship

320
00:15:36,377 --> 00:15:37,738
rather than an employment relationship,

321
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,860
you may have some kind of separation

322
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,182
from some internal problems that a company may have.

323
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,925
Regarding crunch, you may, for example,

324
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,087
have a different contract kind of terms

325
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:51,711
which allow you to charge for such extra time

326
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,773
or to contractually guard against that time.

327
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,715
You don't have to sign those terms all the time.

328
00:15:56,911 --> 00:15:59,813
Finally, you might get a greater ability to promote yourself and your own work.

329
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:05,137
So you might be able to talk about what you do more or do your own projects at the same

330
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:07,959
time as other ones you're working on and actually get your name out there and what you want

331
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:08,480
to do out there.

332
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,722
No one can stop you speaking at a conference, whereas they could if you work in a company.

333
00:16:13,924 --> 00:16:15,104
You can remote work as well.

334
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:18,647
There are also creative benefits to being a freelancer.

335
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,170
So you work on projects you choose to work on rather than those your company assigns

336
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:22,330
to you.

337
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:27,141
You might have freedom to create your own solo work and IP in multiple mediums.

338
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:31,063
So a lot of games companies, as some of you may know, for full-time roles

339
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:36,106
do not allow you to work on any projects outside of the one they ask you to, even in different media.

340
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:40,468
So, for example, as a writer, if I wanted to write a novel working for some of these companies,

341
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:43,550
I wouldn't be allowed to, unless they gave me permission. Otherwise, they'd own it.

342
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:46,792
Which didn't sit right with me as an industry norm.

343
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:52,030
Likewise, as I mentioned before, learning and developing skills much faster due to working

344
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,192
on a range of projects in different types of studios and genres.

345
00:16:56,372 --> 00:16:59,834
Now, as I said at the beginning, there's a bad side to a lot of these things as well,

346
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:03,136
which must be considered carefully if you were to make the proactive choice to become

347
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,517
a freelancer or stay a freelancer.

348
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:09,239
A lot of people will present it as very positive in a career, and it does have its positive

349
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,981
aspects, but you have to accept, due to the nature of the world we live in, that there

350
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:15,122
are various consequences of some of these things.

351
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:16,683
So for be your own boss.

352
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:21,277
That sounds great in your own respect, but you also have all the anxieties, worries,

353
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:22,758
and lack of security that come to that.

354
00:17:22,878 --> 00:17:23,918
You're your own boss, yay.

355
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:26,019
You're also your own boss with all the...

356
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:28,620
You may treat yourself like a boss would treat you,

357
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,800
which is a strange relationship to have with your own work,

358
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,841
and you can be very hard on yourself as a freelancer

359
00:17:32,861 --> 00:17:34,282
in a way you wouldn't be if you were an employee.

360
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:36,996
Likewise, organizing your own time.

361
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:37,676
That sounds great.

362
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:40,017
And have any of you ever tried to do massive projects

363
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:40,777
in your spare time?

364
00:17:40,877 --> 00:17:42,917
It's very difficult to organize your own time

365
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:45,878
with no one making you do things at particular changes.

366
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,298
You have to have a lot of self-discipline.

367
00:17:47,758 --> 00:17:49,939
You have to be able to get up off the,

368
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:52,399
back on the horse at certain times.

369
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,440
Insurance gets mass layoffs.

370
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,560
So yeah, fine.

371
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,681
But it's often way easier to determine a contract

372
00:17:58,741 --> 00:17:59,941
than employment in many cases.

373
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:01,781
So you can like,

374
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:06,146
There is some level of security, but you have to be very careful who you work with.

375
00:18:06,466 --> 00:18:09,788
You may sometimes get paid late, sometimes you may not get paid at all, and might have

376
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:12,089
battles with companies going on behind the scenes.

377
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:16,151
Due to NDAs, you may not even be able to say that you haven't been paid, which is a really

378
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:17,771
weird scenario to be in.

379
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:23,334
Likewise, you may have greater freedom from internal politics, but you may actually be

380
00:18:23,374 --> 00:18:25,515
more vulnerable than this person.

381
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,389
to this than others, and you may be seen as an outsider.

382
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:31,151
So yeah, fine, you're free from that day-to-day situation

383
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:34,575
in the studio, but there are certain familial benefits

384
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,136
you often get in teams where people hang out

385
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:36,957
with each other all the time.

386
00:18:36,997 --> 00:18:38,859
If you're not there, you might, for example,

387
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:40,040
be excluded from meetings.

388
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:42,642
People in the studio might resent the fact

389
00:18:42,682 --> 00:18:44,124
that you're being given all this stuff to do

390
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:45,585
when they want to do it, and so on.

391
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:47,407
And you might have various conflicts

392
00:18:47,587 --> 00:18:50,010
that are just totally not in any way your responsibility,

393
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,411
but it kind of rides.

394
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:56,618
Likewise, yeah, fine, you can often promote yourself, but non-disclosure agreements are

395
00:18:56,678 --> 00:19:03,223
very constant throughout the industry, and you may never be able to talk about certain

396
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:08,488
projects to the extent that you'd like to, and even when a project comes out, often NDAs

397
00:19:08,508 --> 00:19:12,832
will last in an indefinite amount of time, so you have to ask permission to talk about it.

398
00:19:13,748 --> 00:19:15,869
Finally, you may have an ability to remote work,

399
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:18,291
but sometimes, no you don't, you have to go in-house.

400
00:19:18,351 --> 00:19:20,052
So there are loads of jobs which would require you

401
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,634
to move across the country or the world for five months,

402
00:19:23,514 --> 00:19:24,935
with no promise of employment beyond that.

403
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:27,537
When you do do remote work, there'll have to be

404
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:29,118
a whole host of other potential issues

405
00:19:29,158 --> 00:19:31,399
about movement of time, about wanting you

406
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:34,201
to check in nonstop on an online messaging service,

407
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:36,002
for example, when you're actually working on other stuff.

408
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,444
Time can be a strange thing, and companies

409
00:19:38,484 --> 00:19:40,005
don't always know how to deal with that process.

410
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:47,496
On the creative side, working on projects you choose to work on, yes, but often the

411
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:49,498
process to get on a project can be very strange.

412
00:19:49,518 --> 00:19:53,842
So in writing, there's a common thing where you might have like a six-month long selection

413
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:58,266
procedure that's kind of calf-grass, and you might be kind of selected or not selected

414
00:19:58,286 --> 00:20:01,368
for various kind of indeterminate reasons that you're never really given feedback on.

415
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:07,622
If you have the financial luxury to wait for perfect projects, yeah fine, you can work on projects you choose to.

416
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:13,967
But if you'll need those contracts every month for different jobs, you'll often just have to take things as they come

417
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:17,409
and convince yourself and others that you're the best person for that project.

418
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:21,892
And yeah, sure, you'll do a great job, but is it the one you really set out to do when you wanted this freelance life?

419
00:20:21,992 --> 00:20:22,613
Not necessarily.

420
00:20:24,554 --> 00:20:28,956
Likewise, yeah fine, you've got freedom to create your own work, but time and energy

421
00:20:29,316 --> 00:20:32,457
can be a huge issue of actually being able to do that when you're working on contracts

422
00:20:32,517 --> 00:20:32,937
all the time.

423
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,580
However, I would argue that this isn't really as much of a nightmare as it sounds because

424
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,681
you are still free to do so ultimately, which for many people there were value that you

425
00:20:41,722 --> 00:20:45,323
can make something because you want to make it and you're not told by a corporate entity

426
00:20:45,363 --> 00:20:45,843
that you cannot.

427
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:50,309
On the final point, I actually don't think there is a weird nightmare side to that.

428
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,231
I think you do learn and develop skills faster in some ways.

429
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:56,393
They're not necessarily the same skills you'd learn if you were on a project for multiple

430
00:20:56,413 --> 00:21:01,397
years, but you can learn a lot if you leverage the opportunities correctly and rapidly diversify,

431
00:21:01,437 --> 00:21:06,120
see multiple studio types, styles of working, genres of game very quickly.

432
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:08,362
Cool.

433
00:21:08,782 --> 00:21:13,165
So overall, there is no dream, as the title of the talk suggested.

434
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:14,046
You always wake up.

435
00:21:15,517 --> 00:21:17,198
move past those positive aspects.

436
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:18,979
But likewise, there doesn't have to be a nightmare.

437
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:21,660
It doesn't have to be as bad as those bad things sound.

438
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,941
You can find something in between,

439
00:21:23,121 --> 00:21:24,582
which is what partly I'm advising today.

440
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:27,384
So be mindful of your emotions and energy levels.

441
00:21:27,924 --> 00:21:29,985
Mitigate inevitable psychological threats

442
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:31,106
and prepare for challenges.

443
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:32,927
So it's a hard life being a freelancer.

444
00:21:32,947 --> 00:21:34,508
It's very rewarding, but it's hard,

445
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:37,930
and not everyone wants to or is suited to doing it.

446
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,933
But may have to, so hence the advice today.

447
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,866
So two such major psychological threats, which actually link into the advice about careers

448
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,688
in general that I was discussing at the beginning.

449
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,232
You may suffer from imposter syndrome.

450
00:21:51,252 --> 00:21:54,175
So many of you in this room may suffer from imposter syndrome and wonder about your own

451
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:54,536
skills.

452
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:56,118
It's a common thing.

453
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,922
You have to constantly pitch your own work and abilities to gain new gigs and maintain current relationships.

454
00:22:03,182 --> 00:22:04,942
You're often isolated from teams and colleagues.

455
00:22:05,343 --> 00:22:08,204
That kind of friendship throughout the day or that kind of camaraderie you may lack.

456
00:22:08,264 --> 00:22:12,986
You may not have anyone telling you you're good because you've been hired to do a task.

457
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,267
And if you do it, then that's often paid.

458
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:17,447
That's often seen as you being told that you're good.

459
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:22,950
No one may ever tell you that your work was good until you find out in a review that it was good, which can be a very strange life.

460
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,450
You don't have performance reviews or anything.

461
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:28,942
Likewise, you may not be able to discuss your own work, so certain sources of pleasure that

462
00:22:28,962 --> 00:22:32,104
you'd normally have about talking about what you do, you don't always have, you're not

463
00:22:32,124 --> 00:22:33,965
in control of, even after release.

464
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:40,889
You may often also face the threat of burnout, so the unpaid labor of self-promotion, tests,

465
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:44,531
applying for work, economic fear can take a toll on a lot of people.

466
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,089
You have the excitement of all these different things,

467
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:50,929
but the associated cost and risk of,

468
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:53,290
what if I don't get a gig in the next few months?

469
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,990
What if I have a period of unemployment?

470
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,130
What if I have to borrow money?

471
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,131
What if I get into debt?

472
00:22:57,231 --> 00:23:00,331
These can all be huge issues that are emotionally exhausting

473
00:23:00,431 --> 00:23:01,612
in addition to the work you're doing.

474
00:23:02,572 --> 00:23:04,872
Likewise, being pushed to meet aggressive schedules

475
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:07,973
and manage multiple projects can also be a bit of a toll.

476
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:09,553
So it's great you get to work on loads of stuff,

477
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:11,374
but you're working on loads of stuff,

478
00:23:11,634 --> 00:23:13,474
which can be quite a big problem in itself

479
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:15,275
and create an emotional toll.

480
00:23:16,346 --> 00:23:19,348
So some strategies for dealing with these things if you embark on this career.

481
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:23,250
So client dealings will often add to your sense of imposter syndrome.

482
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:27,353
So having to convince people, not getting the kind of feedback you might want, weird

483
00:23:27,393 --> 00:23:30,475
internal politics and all the other issues I've discussed can add to it.

484
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:33,437
So you want to make sure the situations you get involved in are as good as possible and

485
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:34,317
setting expectations.

486
00:23:34,758 --> 00:23:38,160
Often companies aren't intentionally acting in a way that's detrimental to you.

487
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,602
So consider interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you.

488
00:23:41,902 --> 00:23:42,403
Like assess.

489
00:23:43,224 --> 00:23:45,345
Try and get, even if you're gonna take the job whatever

490
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:46,805
because you want the job and you need the money,

491
00:23:46,946 --> 00:23:48,226
you can still stand up for yourself

492
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:50,948
in the interview process and try and make sure

493
00:23:50,988 --> 00:23:52,288
that the working environment's the right fit.

494
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:54,930
So set expectations about your schedule,

495
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,931
your hours, your involvement in the team,

496
00:23:57,331 --> 00:23:59,332
your role, your working habits, how you work.

497
00:23:59,392 --> 00:24:00,713
Tell them how you've worked on the projects.

498
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:01,933
That's a great thing to do in an interview

499
00:24:01,953 --> 00:24:04,275
because once again, that whole idea of ambiguity

500
00:24:04,315 --> 00:24:06,276
about whether you can do it, that answers that topic,

501
00:24:06,356 --> 00:24:08,477
but it also helps you in terms of your working time.

502
00:24:08,497 --> 00:24:09,898
It sets up, that's how I'm gonna do it.

503
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:11,178
You know this is hiring me.

504
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,391
And you can refer back to that if there are problems later,

505
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:14,752
like you knew that I worked like this,

506
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:16,753
and how you get feedback.

507
00:24:16,813 --> 00:24:19,015
It's often good to have an arranged feedback cycle

508
00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:21,356
so that you actually get some affirmation on your work.

509
00:24:22,697 --> 00:24:24,938
Gain contractual protections regarding crediting

510
00:24:24,978 --> 00:24:26,079
and post-release discussion.

511
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,841
So always ask for in your contract

512
00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:31,061
that you are definitely credited.

513
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,092
and make that a compulsory thing about working with them.

514
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:37,415
Likewise, have some kind of protection

515
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,836
that may allow you to in some way

516
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:40,237
discuss your work post-release.

517
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:43,180
And I can post some extra stuff about this online afterwards

518
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,240
about how I formulated this.

519
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,661
So I'll post that on Twitter later.

520
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:50,522
This is a more of a strange thing, but kind of schedule your worrying about things

521
00:24:51,342 --> 00:24:52,803
to particular times of the week.

522
00:24:52,843 --> 00:24:55,626
And I'm going to discuss in a second like career time, planning time.

523
00:24:56,026 --> 00:24:58,288
Don't just be in a constant fear mode about arranging stuff.

524
00:24:58,468 --> 00:24:59,529
Make that part of your job.

525
00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:02,030
Book that in like you would something in a job for a particular time.

526
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:05,573
Curate your site for self-care.

527
00:25:05,613 --> 00:25:07,355
So websites are great for advertising yourself.

528
00:25:07,395 --> 00:25:09,576
They're also great for advertising yourself to yourself.

529
00:25:10,237 --> 00:25:12,078
Reading about your achievements, seeing what you've done,

530
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:13,419
editing that and keeping that going.

531
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:13,880
It's really...

532
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:16,975
I find that fun, so I can just edit it for the sake of it.

533
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:17,595
I'm not doing anything.

534
00:25:17,615 --> 00:25:19,756
I'm just making it nicely arranged and looking good.

535
00:25:20,516 --> 00:25:23,637
Find communities, join in with other people, talk with other people, make sure you're not

536
00:25:23,677 --> 00:25:23,917
alone.

537
00:25:24,998 --> 00:25:27,559
Likewise, with burnout, manage your time.

538
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:29,059
Easier said than done.

539
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,821
Schedule and quarantine a block of career time daily and weekly, even if contracts.

540
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:37,342
Even if you're in jobs, spend maybe like half an hour a morning or an hour a week or whatever

541
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:37,842
trying to...

542
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:40,000
Build those self-promotional strategies.

543
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,221
Look for talks to apply to.

544
00:25:41,261 --> 00:25:42,582
Look for game jams to go to.

545
00:25:42,622 --> 00:25:43,963
Look for communities to join.

546
00:25:44,324 --> 00:25:46,385
Look for new projects, even if you've got stuff arranged.

547
00:25:46,485 --> 00:25:47,366
Never stop.

548
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:49,748
If you stop, that's where more risk can be created for yourself.

549
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:53,691
Try and reduce the cognitive load of too many tasks

550
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:55,092
by finishing short ones first, which

551
00:25:55,152 --> 00:25:58,094
is generally a good idea to try not to be doing too many things.

552
00:25:59,996 --> 00:26:02,538
And there's a principle I call soft and absolute rest time,

553
00:26:02,578 --> 00:26:04,479
because I'm very unhealthy in my own working habits.

554
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,560
This is just what I try and do.

555
00:26:06,547 --> 00:26:09,809
But soft rest time is where I'll say in ideal conditions. I will relax here

556
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:15,733
Absolute rest time is in non ideal conditions. I was written. I was still rest

557
00:26:15,793 --> 00:26:21,296
I was still have this rest break no matter what unless it's really bad, and I have to sure

558
00:26:21,436 --> 00:26:24,418
So for example soft rest time I might take the evenings off during the week in a Saturday

559
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:30,282
And a Sunday if things are going good in absolute crisis conditions where I have to burn out

560
00:26:30,462 --> 00:26:34,785
I even then will not take Sundays. I'll take Sundays off. I'll make sure I take that rest

561
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,271
It's extremely important.

562
00:26:37,411 --> 00:26:39,752
Try and have someone you trust hold you accountable

563
00:26:39,812 --> 00:26:41,053
and encourage you with this.

564
00:26:41,193 --> 00:26:42,353
Make sure they know your schedule

565
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:43,494
and make sure they keep you to it.

566
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,035
I'm just quite going quickly again,

567
00:26:46,055 --> 00:26:47,096
because I've got a little bit of time.

568
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:48,957
So dealing with career gaps.

569
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:51,278
Follow previous advice and self-promotion.

570
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:55,060
If you've got a gap between gigs and you're really

571
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,121
hunting for stuff, extend those blocks

572
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,062
to longer periods of time, the career blocks.

573
00:26:59,903 --> 00:27:01,063
devote more time to things.

574
00:27:01,123 --> 00:27:02,724
So one thing, for example, I'll do on Twitter

575
00:27:02,984 --> 00:27:05,625
when I'm in these gaps is I will search for certain keywords

576
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,146
like game writing, game writers,

577
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:08,346
narrative designers, so on.

578
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:10,687
That will take ages to trawl through.

579
00:27:10,747 --> 00:27:12,048
Most of the tweets are totally irrelevant,

580
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:14,209
but I will find a gig maybe once a week

581
00:27:14,249 --> 00:27:14,849
or something like that.

582
00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:16,610
Loads of people aren't willing to do that,

583
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,831
but that will actually deliver me from crisis.

584
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:20,051
That will actually give me jobs

585
00:27:20,111 --> 00:27:21,592
no one else has found when I have to.

586
00:27:22,012 --> 00:27:23,272
And being willing to do that is something

587
00:27:23,312 --> 00:27:24,293
you have to as a freelancer.

588
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,227
Reach out to your professional network directly for support, always a good idea.

589
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:32,309
Other people will then actually possibly give you projects or make you aware of things if you have to.

590
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,392
Also, work on a project of your own, even if you don't have work.

591
00:27:36,752 --> 00:27:40,234
Your work is your business, which can include your own solo projects here in Creative Medevas.

592
00:27:40,274 --> 00:27:42,395
So keep going, even if you don't have paid employment.

593
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,380
Consider a side hustle if necessary.

594
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:50,766
Various times throughout my game career, I, for example, tutored or did teaching briefly

595
00:27:50,866 --> 00:27:52,307
to be able to make rent and so on.

596
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:53,509
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

597
00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:55,671
Not everyone can be constant and things will happen.

598
00:27:57,172 --> 00:28:00,295
Exiting survival mode, so being able to move out of that, that can be really difficult.

599
00:28:00,355 --> 00:28:03,218
Once you've had a few periods of time with big cancellations or things you've had to

600
00:28:03,238 --> 00:28:05,761
move past, it can be quite hard to get back to normality.

601
00:28:06,323 --> 00:28:09,865
So one thing I'll do, for example, and you can define this on your own basis, is if I

602
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:13,127
have less than two months of work arranged, I will then hit the mode I just described

603
00:28:13,187 --> 00:28:16,909
where I try and find work and I do all those things, and that gives me a bit of a safety

604
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,089
net from absolute crisis.

605
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:23,812
Exiting survivor mode can be really difficult, so writing a commitment and putting that somewhere

606
00:28:23,972 --> 00:28:25,653
of when you'll feel safe is a really good idea.

607
00:28:26,854 --> 00:28:30,776
And get an accountability partner to help pull you out of this when you've reached this

608
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:31,116
point.

609
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:33,898
So try and get someone who will be able to recognize and be around you enough.

610
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:36,234
to recognize when you need to move on and let go,

611
00:28:36,694 --> 00:28:37,835
because it can be very dangerous otherwise.

612
00:28:38,576 --> 00:28:41,178
And finally, make sure you try and finish the solo project,

613
00:28:41,198 --> 00:28:42,219
but don't be unkind to yourself,

614
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:43,960
because keep going, do your own stuff.

615
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,441
That's why you're a freelancer, you can do this.

616
00:28:46,763 --> 00:28:49,285
So in sum up, be kind to others in your position.

617
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,046
We're all in this together,

618
00:28:51,086 --> 00:28:52,988
and a lot of freelancers may try and build each other up

619
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:53,848
or cut each other down.

620
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:56,871
Those who build others up will often be helped far more

621
00:28:56,911 --> 00:28:58,012
than those who cut others down.

622
00:28:58,352 --> 00:29:00,354
Others will help you, others will recognize your goodness

623
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:01,375
and your willingness to support.

624
00:29:02,236 --> 00:29:03,297
Be just as kind to yourself.

625
00:29:04,097 --> 00:29:05,498
We often are very hard on ourselves

626
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:07,018
in a way others are not, and as freelancers,

627
00:29:07,058 --> 00:29:08,059
we're very much at risk of this.

628
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,880
You will create your best work when you're inspired,

629
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,862
not when tired, miserable, resenting creative activity.

630
00:29:14,582 --> 00:29:17,063
You may draw on those emotions to produce work later

631
00:29:17,264 --> 00:29:18,124
that you've had in other times,

632
00:29:18,164 --> 00:29:20,025
but when actually creating, that deserves no one,

633
00:29:20,085 --> 00:29:21,866
so don't drive yourself into the ground.

634
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:24,147
So that's the end, exactly at time,

635
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:25,628
but I'll be available for questions afterwards

636
00:29:25,668 --> 00:29:26,848
and around the area and stuff, so yeah.
