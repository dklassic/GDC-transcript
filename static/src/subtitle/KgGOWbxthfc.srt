1
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,222
Welcome everyone to the Gaming for Good Philanthropy as a Business Strategy session.

2
00:00:14,802 --> 00:00:17,343
We appreciate you taking the time to join us today.

3
00:00:17,823 --> 00:00:22,625
Before we jump into the topic, we thought it would be helpful for Derek and I to introduce

4
00:00:22,685 --> 00:00:23,106
ourselves.

5
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:32,069
My name is Dan Widner and I'm the Vice President for the West Region of the American Cancer

6
00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:35,811
Society and co-creator of our Gamers vs. Cancer program.

7
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:42,349
I lead the execution of our enterprise-wide vision, direction, and strategy through major

8
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:48,292
gifts, corporate accounts, distinguished events, and innovative solutions, where each of our

9
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:53,356
departments have revenue-targeted goals that we set and work to achieve to actually help

10
00:00:53,396 --> 00:00:55,817
support our mission efforts.

11
00:00:56,798 --> 00:01:01,821
I'm very excited to be here to talk to you today about the work that a team and I are

12
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,943
doing in helping to lead.

13
00:01:04,652 --> 00:01:07,315
the fight against cancer within the gaming industry,

14
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:10,097
because I myself have been an avid gamer

15
00:01:10,598 --> 00:01:11,719
from a very young age.

16
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,224
I've known, I've now been able to blend a lifelong passion

17
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:20,867
with the ability to support a mission and a cause

18
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,629
that is very personal to me,

19
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:26,152
given that my family has been significantly impacted

20
00:01:26,512 --> 00:01:27,073
by cancer.

21
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:28,734
And now I'll turn it over to Derek.

22
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,873
Thanks, Daniel. Hi, I'm Derek Morton. I'm CEO of Flowplay.

23
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:39,598
Flowplay is a group of 60 people in Seattle. We make casual MMO games.

24
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:44,683
Our most successful games are Vegas World, Casino World, and Our World.

25
00:01:44,763 --> 00:01:47,706
These are virtual worlds where people from all over the world get together.

26
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:52,190
They have an avatar, they run around, they have parties, they go to restaurants,

27
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,694
they play games together. We have about half a million monthly active users.

28
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:03,694
So during today's presentation, we're going to cover the following.

29
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:09,800
You're going to hear from Derek on how Flowplay has approached working with charity partners in the past,

30
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,065
and the process that he took as a company in finding the right nonprofit to work with.

31
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:24,533
I'm going to talk a little bit about the mission of ACS and give you some insight on why and how we ended up creating the Gamers vs. Cancer program.

32
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:30,679
Derek is going to cover the creation of the partnership between Flowplay and the American

33
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:36,384
Cancer Society, talking about how it is that our teams collaborated on the project itself.

34
00:02:37,064 --> 00:02:43,349
I'm going to then go into the impact that the gaming industry has had on social good and give

35
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:49,614
some insight on why others might want to support nonprofits across the world if you haven't already

36
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:52,917
done so. Derek is then going to go into detail.

37
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:57,088
on the specifics of what the activation actually is

38
00:02:57,588 --> 00:02:59,890
and what the teams ended up creating together.

39
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:03,212
We will also cover how you can get involved,

40
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:06,295
talking about some action items and some next steps

41
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:09,877
that you can take to immediately drive social good

42
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:10,978
through your line of work.

43
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:13,400
As this presentation is going on,

44
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,042
Derek and I are going to be monitoring the chat,

45
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,243
answering any questions that you have.

46
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:20,845
We also dedicated some time at the end.

47
00:03:21,222 --> 00:03:31,329
To allow us the ability to go through and answer any questions that we might have missed. And with that, we're going to go ahead and jump right in.

48
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:43,459
Hi. Well, I'll tell you about how Flowplay started getting me into charitable giving. It started with a couple world events where there was an earthquake and tsunami in Japan. It was an earthquake and

49
00:03:45,754 --> 00:03:51,759
And so, there was an interest in the company to sort of like do what we could to sort of send money to support those causes.

50
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:59,366
And to do that, we reached out to our players, we created elements in the game that would help them contribute to that fundraiser.

51
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:04,530
And then we wrote a check and sent it off to the different relief organizations in Japan and Nepal.

52
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:11,195
We got so much interest in that from our players and from our employees as well.

53
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:15,296
We decided we would make this more structured.

54
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:17,877
We started budgeting for it in our yearly planning,

55
00:04:18,537 --> 00:04:22,639
setting aside what portion of our revenue and profits

56
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,340
we would apply towards charitable giving throughout the year.

57
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,961
So we started setting aside this money

58
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:32,643
and started looking for nonprofits to fundraise for.

59
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:39,306
found a great organization called Girl Start, a group called Home for our Troops, which

60
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:44,787
builds houses for wounded vets, people that were working with human trafficking rescue.

61
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:51,349
We built makers labs for underprivileged schools, all kinds of stuff, but we were kind of, it

62
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:52,049
was kind of random.

63
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:54,989
We would hear about a charity and say, Oh, yeah, let's pick those guys.

64
00:04:55,369 --> 00:05:00,010
And we would go write them a check and, you know, maybe go volunteer some hours as well.

65
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:02,411
So things were still a bit ad hoc.

66
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:09,199
But in 2018, we decided to take a much more structured approach.

67
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:16,125
Not only did we set aside money in our budget, but we thought that we would really hone in

68
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:20,389
on what do our customers and what do our employees support?

69
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:21,970
What would they like to see as support?

70
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,594
How could we really get everyone involved and excited about being part of doing fundraisings

71
00:05:27,635 --> 00:05:28,215
for charities?

72
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:30,857
So we started with some community surveys.

73
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,258
We started surveying our players.

74
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:35,550
Asking them, you know, what's touched your life?

75
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,951
Who do you contribute money to?

76
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:40,893
What's of interest to you when it comes to philanthropy?

77
00:05:41,853 --> 00:05:43,814
And we did the same thing with our employees as a group.

78
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:46,956
We met together and just talked about, you know,

79
00:05:47,696 --> 00:05:51,498
what would you love to get behind as a fundraising event

80
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:54,079
and for Flowplay to be part of?

81
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:57,761
And we really run into research,

82
00:05:57,781 --> 00:06:00,162
like what would really have the greatest impact on our community?

83
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:06,951
So after talking to our community members,

84
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:08,052
talking to our employees,

85
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:11,875
cancer kept coming up again and again and again.

86
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:14,577
Our players are primarily women,

87
00:06:15,037 --> 00:06:16,558
and primarily women over 50.

88
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:21,082
And for them, either through friends, family,

89
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:24,304
or them personally, cancer had touched many of their lives,

90
00:06:24,765 --> 00:06:27,147
and it was a recurring theme throughout some of the surveys

91
00:06:27,207 --> 00:06:30,009
and some of the conversations I had with the players.

92
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:47,158
So, knowing that cancer was an important issue for our players, we started doing research on, you know, who is making the biggest impact, who is a really great organization to work with, and has, you know, the majority of their fundraising going towards actually helping people.

93
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:58,301
Through all this research, going to Charity Navigator, looking through what cancer charities were doing their mess work, we came across American Cancer Society, and it's been great for us.

94
00:06:58,381 --> 00:06:58,821
Thank you.

95
00:06:59,778 --> 00:07:09,262
Very well recognized, both in the research area and the amount of money that goes to the actual work of curing cancer and helping people that have cancer.

96
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:14,524
So we were very excited to find them and begin to form a partnership with them.

97
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:21,427
So, to expand on what Derek was just talking about,

98
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:27,650
so the American Cancer Society is a national nonprofit with the sole mission of saving lives, celebrating lives.

99
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:30,667
and leading the fight into a world without cancer.

100
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,828
I've provided a few key statistics on the slide

101
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:36,569
that you can see to showcase the impact

102
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,550
that cancer has had on so many individuals.

103
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:43,552
As you can see, one in three people within the United States

104
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:47,653
will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime.

105
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:52,695
Globally, in 2018, there are more than 17 million

106
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:57,517
cancer cases and 9.5 million cancer deaths worldwide.

107
00:07:57,965 --> 00:08:09,314
By 2040, the global burden is expected to grow to 27.5 million new cases and 16.3 million cancer deaths,

108
00:08:09,995 --> 00:08:14,118
simply due to growth and aging of the general population.

109
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:19,182
In the past few months, with the COVID-19 crisis, our mission

110
00:08:19,222 --> 00:08:22,725
and services have become even more vital for cancer patients,

111
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:27,548
many of whom already have a compromised immune system.

112
00:08:28,147 --> 00:08:30,449
and are more vulnerable more than ever.

113
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,992
To combat this, we have had to shift our needs

114
00:08:34,652 --> 00:08:37,995
for cancer patients and communities facing the pandemic.

115
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:42,939
We've added video conferencing to our 24-7 cancer helpline

116
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,662
and provided valuable information and guidance on cancer.org

117
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:51,545
in order to help keep patients safe and well-informed.

118
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,589
We've also continued our efforts to fund critical research,

119
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:56,629
as Derek had mentioned.

120
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,670
Unfortunately...

121
00:08:58,077 --> 00:09:01,759
COVID-19 has had a tremendous impact on the ability for labs

122
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:05,640
not only to remain open so that they can continue the research,

123
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,681
but also in the ability for organizations

124
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,902
to actually be able to fund them.

125
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:16,024
Like many nonprofits, we are doing everything that we can

126
00:09:16,144 --> 00:09:19,505
to continue our efforts to fund researchers

127
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:21,606
during this challenging time.

128
00:09:21,986 --> 00:09:25,747
And if we don't, the long-term effects could be significant.

129
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:31,882
Lastly, we are working to promote health equity and ensure equal access to cancer research,

130
00:09:32,402 --> 00:09:38,507
education, screenings, and treatment for all individuals. The American Cancer Society and

131
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:44,452
American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, or as we call them ACS-CAN, are committed to

132
00:09:44,512 --> 00:09:50,937
addressing the unequal burden of cancer by reaching individuals in underserved communities

133
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:55,220
in collaboration with community partners through our advocacy work.

134
00:09:56,146 --> 00:10:01,969
This, the reason I'm bringing this up is because anytime that you work with a nonprofit,

135
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:10,134
their central core mission is going to be what it is that they are driving from a social good perspective.

136
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:14,456
Whenever you communicate with them, their mission is always going to be top priority.

137
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:17,718
It's the main reason that they create partnerships.

138
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:25,282
We're looking to expand not only from a fundraising perspective, but also drive awareness in anything that we do.

139
00:10:25,968 --> 00:10:33,511
And so I wanted to give you some context in terms of why we are here, why we are helping drive social good.

140
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:35,532
That is our mission is our core value.

141
00:10:35,972 --> 00:10:46,616
And so all of these are reasons why opportunities like the engagement through our Gamers vs. Cancer program are so vital in us allowing to support that critical mission.

142
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:54,479
Last year, myself and Maya Al-Sazh were able to create the Gamers vs. Cancer program.

143
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:01,942
We have been having success through partnerships within the gaming industry, which is how the program actually got started.

144
00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:16,225
Organizationally, we strategize on how it is that we can maximize our partnerships through a more unified approach versus kind of a segmented one based off of just individual partnerships.

145
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:22,686
The ultimate goal of our program was to be able to help partners achieve their own goals and to

146
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:26,386
It supports our mission, not only as I mentioned before,

147
00:11:26,406 --> 00:11:29,609
through fundraising, but also in driving awareness

148
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:31,150
within the gaming industry.

149
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:35,235
The program itself focuses in on engaging the industry

150
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:37,997
within the five areas that you see on the slide.

151
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:40,140
The first is partnerships.

152
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,184
So looking at how it is that we can engage software,

153
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,906
hardware, and e-sports corporations.

154
00:11:48,097 --> 00:11:51,899
Our partnership with Flowplay is actually a great example

155
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:54,840
of how it is that we've partnered with a game developer

156
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,342
to work on an activation to address both what I mentioned,

157
00:11:58,382 --> 00:12:00,062
helping to raise funds and drive awareness.

158
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:01,683
Second is streaming.

159
00:12:02,403 --> 00:12:06,145
We've had great success in live stream fundraising

160
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:08,906
with content creators to support our mission

161
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:11,207
through charity streams that they host.

162
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:14,808
Creators like Little Simsie and Greg Miller,

163
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:16,709
aka Game Over Greggie.

164
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:18,243
We've been able to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars.

165
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:22,865
From kind of funny games have collectively helped us raise hundreds of thousands of dollars.

166
00:12:23,806 --> 00:12:30,888
Which leads to events. We've hosted our own and partnered with other nonprofits to host in person and digital.

167
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:42,133
Nowadays, much more digital gaming events and have also been chosen as the charity of choice through e sports tournaments like the recent PUBG charity showdown event.

168
00:12:47,617 --> 00:12:58,269
We have been featured as a beneficiary on multiple bundles through Humble Bundles platform in partnership with developers like EA and Bandai Namco.

169
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:05,777
These platforms alone have helped raise millions of dollars over the last five years to support our mission.

170
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:10,678
We've expanded opportunities through merchandise collaboration.

171
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:15,443
You know, we looked at how it is that we could create specific merchandise with a partner,

172
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:22,210
maybe aligning it with a awareness Cancer Month or even in alignment through an event

173
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,633
or a digital activation that we create.

174
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:28,156
We are by no means the only nonprofit partner.

175
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:29,167
And we have a number of

176
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:33,668
people who have been working within the gaming community to support their mission.

177
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:36,568
Some of which have been doing it much longer than us.

178
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:48,831
While others, I can tell you, are just now starting to create strategies and are looking to see how it is that they can not only engage their existing constituents, but even the community as a whole.

179
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:58,093
And so we're going to have to expand on what the community is currently engaging with through game developers.

180
00:13:58,475 --> 00:14:10,759
In addition to content streamers, establishing a presence at gaming events, creating an ambassador program, and securing hardware and software donations to expand our reach and give potential.

181
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:17,762
This multi-pronged approach allows the gaming community to truly take ownership in the fight against cancer.

182
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:25,141
We are tapping into opportunities to incorporate cost marketing as a major strategy for free-to-play games.

183
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:33,628
And as I mentioned before, our partnership with Flowplay is a great example of this, which Derek is going to cover in greater detail now.

184
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:41,413
So once you've found a charity that you really are passionate for, your community is passionate for,

185
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:46,757
it'd be easy to start getting a fundraiser going in your game and just write a check to them.

186
00:14:47,224 --> 00:14:52,386
What I really recommend is that you partner closely with the charity that you've chosen.

187
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:58,329
You'd be surprised how eager charities are to work with you and to work closely with you

188
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:05,652
to create a really great event. They know where their money is going and what the issues are

189
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:12,215
and can help you identify very targeted fundraisers. It's my belief that, you know,

190
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,557
just raising money for cancer or some other great charity

191
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:31,922
If you can narrow it down to help people understand exactly an issue that you're going to be dealing with and exactly where the money is going, it's a much more successful campaign because people really get a better sense of the help that they're going to be creating through this program.

192
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:38,887
Our two PR teams work really closely together, so we're creating social media events, we're creating

193
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:42,789
PR releases both before and after the fundraiser.

194
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:45,391
So it's great for you to get visibility,

195
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:48,433
both from the efforts of the charity you're working with

196
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:52,016
and both from the PR that your own team is doing

197
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,818
to announce what the event was

198
00:15:54,838 --> 00:15:56,279
and what the result of the event was.

199
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,062
So four things to be sure to do.

200
00:16:00,122 --> 00:16:02,704
Make sure you're highlighting a very specific cause.

201
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:12,506
And also get your creative team involved so that they can bring some of what you as the game company can do to really make this successful.

202
00:16:12,946 --> 00:16:18,629
You know, we're the creative people. Most of the time the charity people are not super creative.

203
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:26,972
They have a mission, they have things that they're working on, but it's really up to you to come up with something super fun and super creative to engage the community.

204
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:32,275
We also encourage you to integrate a lot of this stuff into your live ops.

205
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:34,605
and your game promotion calendar,

206
00:16:35,086 --> 00:16:37,448
so that you're announcing what's going on

207
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:39,670
and keeping people informed all along the way

208
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,812
and allowing people in your game

209
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:43,733
to actually spread the word themselves.

210
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:47,877
We keep these charity promotions live for about four weeks

211
00:16:48,658 --> 00:16:49,979
because we're on a two-week sprint

212
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:52,001
and that seems to be about enough time

213
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,822
to have a really successful promotion.

214
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:56,505
Excuse me.

215
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,982
The keys to a successful fundraiser, I believe, as I said, make it specific.

216
00:17:02,082 --> 00:17:05,504
People want to know where's the money going to and how is it going to help people.

217
00:17:05,644 --> 00:17:10,047
Our most recent campaign was to provide hotel rooms for frontline workers

218
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:15,149
so that these frontline workers that are working in COVID wards don't have to go home

219
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:19,291
to infect their family or have a place to rest in between their shifts.

220
00:17:19,712 --> 00:17:25,135
So this really was much better than just saying, hey, we're raising money for frontline workers.

221
00:17:25,195 --> 00:17:25,415
It's like.

222
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:30,043
We are raising money for frontline workers because they need a place to stay in between their shifts.

223
00:17:30,343 --> 00:17:32,084
So that really brings it home.

224
00:17:33,045 --> 00:17:34,045
Make it easy in the game.

225
00:17:34,365 --> 00:17:38,847
You know, buy this thing and all the money you spend will go towards this charity.

226
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:41,528
Also, make it a benefit for the player.

227
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:45,350
If you buy this thing, make something in the game happen.

228
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,541
that benefits them so that they get a little something back out of it as well.

229
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:55,645
It's also really good if it's socially engaging, if there's a way for them to actually buy one for someone else,

230
00:17:56,025 --> 00:18:00,908
to share that, so that if you're spreading the word and allowing them to, you know,

231
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:06,072
share their philanthropy with other players in the game.

232
00:18:06,572 --> 00:18:10,274
And also make it, it's really optimal if you're, make it easy,

233
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:13,476
either through chat or other mechanisms you have in terms of

234
00:18:14,825 --> 00:18:16,246
And so, we're going to talk about the game development transcript.

235
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:18,368
And we're going to talk about chat boards and things where people can

236
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,348
announce, hey, I'm part of this fundraiser,

237
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:21,750
and I want to get everybody else involved in it as well.

238
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,013
Next slide.

239
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:31,258
So Derek shared how to create a successful fundraiser.

240
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:33,780
So I want to dive deeper into the why.

241
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:38,704
We have an unparalleled opportunity to cultivate gaming as a platform

242
00:18:43,158 --> 00:18:43,858
The goal of the game development

243
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:44,859
transcript is to help players

244
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:46,799
frequently connect and help with one another. By combining

245
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,341
gameplay, emerging technologies,

246
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:54,003
inspired talent, the commercial gaming industry can extend

247
00:18:54,103 --> 00:18:56,084
these communities to invoke monumental social change.

248
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:57,364
Although not all nonprofits are the same, we create

249
00:18:57,384 --> 00:18:58,545
partnerships by looking at how we can help solve problems

250
00:18:58,565 --> 00:18:59,345
and to help strengthen the brand.

251
00:18:59,365 --> 00:19:00,206
As the middle of the slide deck shows,

252
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:00,686
we are looking at the

253
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,366
game development transcript.

254
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:02,787
The goal of the game development transcript is to help players

255
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,148
frequently connect and help with one another. By combining

256
00:19:04,168 --> 00:19:07,549
gameplay, emerging technologies, inspired talent, the commercial gaming industry can extend these communities to invoke monumental social change.

257
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:10,570
Although not all nonprofits are the same, we create partnerships by looking at how we can help solve problems and to help solve problems.

258
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,892
Although not all nonprofits are the same, we create partnerships by looking at the game development transcript.

259
00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:19,789
By partnering with nonprofits, you can create value that actually aligns with your own priorities.

260
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:29,373
Research suggests that 85% of Americans will switch to a product if the company supports a cause they believe in.

261
00:19:29,853 --> 00:19:33,315
And that figure jumps to 90% for millennials.

262
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:39,337
The gaming industry's reach has the potential to address the world's most pressing issues.

263
00:19:39,818 --> 00:19:40,178
For us.

264
00:19:40,795 --> 00:19:46,140
Partners allow us to help save more lives from cancer than ever before.

265
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:52,165
With a 26% drop in cancer death rates in the United States since 1991,

266
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:58,189
this steady decline makes us even more determined to accelerate this progress.

267
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:05,055
And it's important to note that while all of the overall cancer mortality rates are dropping,

268
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:10,139
populations who are marginalized are bearing a disproportionate burden.

269
00:20:10,603 --> 00:20:12,783
A preventable death and disease.

270
00:20:13,784 --> 00:20:16,605
Meaning there is still more work to be done.

271
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:19,685
Meaning there is huge opportunity, right,

272
00:20:19,725 --> 00:20:23,467
for us to be driving social good within the gaming industry.

273
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:27,008
Partnerships within our organization

274
00:20:27,188 --> 00:20:30,489
through the industry itself demonstrate just one way

275
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:33,710
at which the gaming industry has had a tremendous impact

276
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,710
on driving social good globally.

277
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,251
And now Derek is going to dig into

278
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,972
exactly how our partnership has been implemented.

279
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:45,993
Thanks, Daniel.

280
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:48,114
I wanted to give you an example of what we did

281
00:20:48,174 --> 00:20:50,935
so I could sort of help you come up with some ideas

282
00:20:50,975 --> 00:20:53,476
for your own games and how you might integrate

283
00:20:53,536 --> 00:20:56,857
this kind of charity fundraising inside your products.

284
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,758
In our game, this is our game called Vegas World.

285
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,860
One of the major ways we make money

286
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,080
is we sell people good luck charms.

287
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:07,821
These charms, if you purchase them...

288
00:21:08,215 --> 00:21:08,456
Next slide.

289
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:09,757
So, we're going to go through a couple of different ways

290
00:21:09,777 --> 00:21:10,858
that we can increase the odds of winning in the game.

291
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:12,900
So, if you're playing slots, if you're playing blackjack,

292
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:17,265
any of our social casino games, you will win more coins back

293
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:19,307
if you're using these lucky charms.

294
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:20,448
So, they're very popular.

295
00:21:20,808 --> 00:21:22,791
They drive about 85% of our revenue.

296
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:25,794
So, it's a major, major thing in our products.

297
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:28,557
Next slide.

298
00:21:31,113 --> 00:21:38,778
We also, through our party system, allow people to group together and have parties in their hotel room in the game.

299
00:21:39,678 --> 00:21:44,841
And through this party board, they're able to create these events around the charity

300
00:21:45,121 --> 00:21:47,982
so that everyone in the community knows these events are going on

301
00:21:48,403 --> 00:21:53,345
and can easily click a link and go to the party and be part of this charity fundraiser.

302
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,788
This is what it looks like to be in a party in Vegas World.

303
00:21:58,828 --> 00:22:00,489
You see the avatars of all the players.

304
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:03,626
There's chat, there's people buying these charms.

305
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:07,327
And you see that people are actually in this room buying charms as we go.

306
00:22:07,347 --> 00:22:14,729
At a charity fundraiser party, people would be buying, in the case of ACS,

307
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:19,470
American Cancer Society charms that are distributed to everybody in the room.

308
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,491
They buy one for themselves, but everybody else in the room gets one as well.

309
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:27,293
And later when they go play our games, our slots games and blackjack games,

310
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:30,193
that gives them a benefit in the game, so it's super social.

311
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:39,448
And this is just an example of where the American Cancer Society charm was placed in our purchase

312
00:22:39,548 --> 00:22:40,148
merchandising.

313
00:22:41,228 --> 00:22:42,269
It was 25 gems.

314
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:46,870
You want to keep the price point fairly low so it's really easy for people to buy a lot

315
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,251
of them and share them.

316
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:52,592
If you set the price point too high, you won't have a lot of activity.

317
00:22:52,652 --> 00:22:58,074
But what you want to create is like this sense of a lot of activity, a lot of charms being

318
00:22:58,094 --> 00:23:00,495
purchased or a lot of whatever you're building in your own game.

319
00:23:00,886 --> 00:23:06,084
I feel like it's really exciting and really interesting for everybody.

320
00:23:08,507 --> 00:23:11,089
So we just finished our most recent successful campaign.

321
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,391
As I mentioned, we were working with,

322
00:23:13,911 --> 00:23:16,673
the American Cancer Society has what's called the Hope Lodge.

323
00:23:17,434 --> 00:23:19,456
And while the Hope Lodge is a place

324
00:23:19,496 --> 00:23:22,598
for cancer patients to stay while they're traveling

325
00:23:22,939 --> 00:23:24,880
to go for therapy and treatments,

326
00:23:25,801 --> 00:23:27,863
during COVID-19 situations,

327
00:23:28,163 --> 00:23:30,465
it was temporarily switched to be used

328
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:33,768
to allow frontline hospital workers to rest.

329
00:23:35,229 --> 00:23:38,670
remain separated from their families so they didn't spread the disease to their family.

330
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,611
So we did a specific fundraiser around this.

331
00:23:42,372 --> 00:23:46,233
So the reason I believe this is successful is it's super timely.

332
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:52,416
COVID-19, this was run during May, so it was obviously very timely during May.

333
00:23:53,536 --> 00:23:57,298
The players got bonuses for being part of this, for buying the charm for the Hope Lodge.

334
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:02,337
They got benefits for their friends when they buy one for themselves, they get benefits for everybody else.

335
00:24:02,797 --> 00:24:09,899
And it was easy to share because everybody could create these parties where everybody could come and have a good time and support a great cause.

336
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,061
The result of this was that we raised $55,000 just for this one campaign.

337
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:27,967
32% of our MAU went to one of these parties, so about a third of all players were engaged

338
00:24:28,027 --> 00:24:29,729
somehow in this fundraising effort.

339
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:36,415
And literally 28% of our monthly active users actually made a monetary contribution toward

340
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:37,556
buying these charms.

341
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:42,661
So this is one of many that we've done for the American Cancer Society.

342
00:24:42,721 --> 00:24:43,602
We've raised, I believe,

343
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:46,887
I think it's over $300,000 for ACS so far.

344
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:49,908
So we are super excited about continuing to do this.

345
00:24:49,928 --> 00:24:53,510
We're going to do another one with a different fundraising

346
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,910
angle this October.

347
00:24:57,752 --> 00:24:58,532
Great, thanks, Eric.

348
00:24:59,112 --> 00:25:00,613
Again, I think that it shows just

349
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:04,955
how you're able to connect an engagement activation

350
00:25:05,015 --> 00:25:07,176
for your own constituents and tying it directly

351
00:25:07,236 --> 00:25:09,257
to a mission effort.

352
00:25:09,357 --> 00:25:13,219
That's where I think there is huge synergy in terms

353
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:13,639
of being able.

354
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:15,527
with the nonprofit.

355
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:20,789
And so now we want to showcase how you can get more involved and what are some next steps.

356
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:25,089
So first off, you can reach out to nonprofit partners.

357
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,451
You can connect with, if you already know that there is a cause that organizationally

358
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:37,932
you hold dear, near and dear, reach out to a nonprofit to see if there is the ability

359
00:25:38,052 --> 00:25:40,113
to create an activation.

360
00:25:40,553 --> 00:25:42,935
If you don't have a nonprofit, you can reach out to us.

361
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,136
You can do a number of things, right?

362
00:25:45,296 --> 00:25:47,277
And then secondly, what you could do

363
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:49,818
is you can also connect with your community,

364
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:52,339
like what Derek was saying and how they approached it.

365
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:56,381
Finding out what is near and dear to your community

366
00:25:56,481 --> 00:26:00,943
and aligning that cause through an activation for them.

367
00:26:01,684 --> 00:26:03,805
Secondly, and Derek mentioned this previously,

368
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:07,687
you know, incorporate the creative and innovative

369
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:15,873
way that you have built out your own business and company and bring that to the nonprofit.

370
00:26:16,513 --> 00:26:23,015
If, as Derek has mentioned, the nonprofit isn't necessarily going to have answers and how it is

371
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:28,357
that they can engage the community, especially nowadays with a lot of nonprofits in the early

372
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:32,659
stage of just looking to see how they can incorporate the community into their mission.

373
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:37,181
And so a lot of times you're going to need to be that subject matter expert.

374
00:26:37,904 --> 00:26:40,846
Secondly, you're going to want to discuss goals early on.

375
00:26:41,547 --> 00:26:42,908
What are your priorities?

376
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:47,391
How does it align with the priorities of the nonprofit

377
00:26:47,471 --> 00:26:48,892
that you're going to be connecting with?

378
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:50,793
I think it's important to also note

379
00:26:51,213 --> 00:26:54,856
that nonprofits are also held by specific laws

380
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:58,078
in terms of what they can and can't do within partnerships.

381
00:26:58,418 --> 00:27:00,440
And understand that, you know,

382
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,122
if you can't equate it to how you might have worked

383
00:27:03,142 --> 00:27:04,383
with a vendor in the past,

384
00:27:04,743 --> 00:27:07,245
or how you might have worked with another business partner.

385
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:11,450
It's slightly different, though not as much as you might think.

386
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,291
But just wanted to preface that there might be differences

387
00:27:14,331 --> 00:27:15,752
in the two approaches

388
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:17,732
when you initially start to have communication.

389
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:21,114
And then last but not least, share the impact.

390
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:23,795
You have created an activation.

391
00:27:23,815 --> 00:27:25,475
You've engaged your constituents.

392
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:28,937
You've really been able to build out something

393
00:27:29,697 --> 00:27:32,078
and build it behind a cause, right,

394
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:33,619
that's either important to you or important

395
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:34,539
to your own constituents.

396
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:39,341
And share what that impact is after the activation has taken place.

397
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:42,422
Derek, is there anything that you might want to add to this?

398
00:27:43,563 --> 00:27:46,084
I think the main thing I would add is that, you know,

399
00:27:46,104 --> 00:27:48,125
there's probably many people out there.

400
00:27:48,185 --> 00:27:49,826
They're saying, you know, this sounds like a great idea.

401
00:27:50,286 --> 00:27:53,428
We'd love to give to charity and, you know, get something going

402
00:27:53,448 --> 00:27:54,708
with our community around it.

403
00:27:55,188 --> 00:27:58,270
But you'll be you'll be shocked and you'll be surprised that

404
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,031
what the real impact later is for you.

405
00:28:02,385 --> 00:28:05,787
It's one thing to just carry out a fundraiser and donate money.

406
00:28:05,828 --> 00:28:08,629
It's another when you start to see the feedback from your players,

407
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:14,032
the appreciation that they have for the fact that you're doing good

408
00:28:14,052 --> 00:28:16,934
and that you're helping the community and the same thing with your employees.

409
00:28:17,314 --> 00:28:19,956
The feedback that you'll get from your employees is amazing as well.

410
00:28:24,592 --> 00:28:32,677
So we've provided additional time for us to go through and look to see if there are any questions in the chat that we haven't been able to address just yet.

411
00:28:32,697 --> 00:28:40,821
I did have two questions for Derek to kind of build upon what it is that he's discussed earlier. So, Derek, you talked about

412
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:47,765
how it is that you went out and you connected with your community to find out what cause was near and dear to their hearts.

413
00:28:47,785 --> 00:28:53,508
You know, what are some best practices that you've seen over the course of the last couple of years in doing an activation like this?

414
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:55,162
that others could possibly take.

415
00:28:57,305 --> 00:29:01,890
Well, the surveys and emails and having people respond

416
00:29:02,691 --> 00:29:04,474
by electronic communication are great.

417
00:29:05,074 --> 00:29:09,059
But I was uniquely lucky in that we have a virtual world.

418
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,021
So I walk around in it.

419
00:29:11,602 --> 00:29:12,863
Most people know who I am.

420
00:29:12,883 --> 00:29:15,066
I have a, my name in the game is Dignania.

421
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,026
So people say hi to me.

422
00:29:16,067 --> 00:29:17,488
They know I'm the CEO of the company.

423
00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:20,211
And so I'm kind of a popular guy.

424
00:29:20,952 --> 00:29:23,494
But my advantage there is that I get to actually talk

425
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:25,216
to people in the game one-on-one

426
00:29:25,236 --> 00:29:27,999
and talk to them about their stories.

427
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:30,321
You know, if somebody sends me a message saying,

428
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:32,283
hey, you know, cancer is very important to me.

429
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:35,757
It's a charity that I support and would like to see you guys support.

430
00:29:35,777 --> 00:29:40,799
I can actually go in the game and talk to them about that and find out, you know, how

431
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:46,980
has cancer touched your life and how can we, you know, create a campaign that's meaningful

432
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,400
for you.

433
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:49,761
Great.

434
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:56,323
So my last question would be, how has the impact of driving a social good campaign through

435
00:29:56,363 --> 00:29:59,823
your business impacted you as an individual?

436
00:30:02,028 --> 00:30:11,094
Well, probably the biggest thing that's happened is I was asked a couple of years ago to join a group called the CEOs against cancer, part of the Washington group.

437
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:19,258
And later this year in February, I actually became the chairman. So today I'm the chairman of the Washington CEOs against cancer.

438
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:31,545
It was an organization that takes, you know, leaders around the state to come together and do big events and fundraisers to try and make a contribution for this important research.

439
00:30:32,195 --> 00:30:37,778
And supporting the community of people that are the patients and the people that are dealing with the cancer issue.

440
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:45,041
Great. All right, so with that, we have concluded our session.

441
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:53,184
We want to thank you so much for joining in the dialogue through the chat and just being a part of the session as a whole.

442
00:30:53,845 --> 00:31:00,007
We would love to hear, you know, in future state, if you ever do connect with a nonprofit.

443
00:31:00,774 --> 00:31:04,240
and end up creating an activation. We'd love to hear from you. You can reach out to

444
00:31:04,621 --> 00:31:09,450
myself and Derek individually, or you could reach out to us at gamersversuscancer at cancer.org.

445
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,734
Again, thank you so much for being a part.
