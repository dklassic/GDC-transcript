1
00:00:03,849 --> 00:00:04,133
Thank you.

2
00:00:06,411 --> 00:00:11,173
So, the title was inspired remembering back to the Wizard of Oz books.

3
00:00:11,473 --> 00:00:15,094
Not the first one, but I think the first one after that was The Marvelous Land of Oz.

4
00:00:15,574 --> 00:00:17,915
I mean, I had these characters that have stuck with me ever since.

5
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:20,456
This is Jack Pumpkinhead and the Sawhorse.

6
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:24,837
And the premise is that you build something out of everyday objects, right?

7
00:00:25,557 --> 00:00:29,158
Jack is just a scarecrow and Sawhorse is really just a sawhorse.

8
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:34,280
And then you sprinkle the magic dust of life over them and they come to life.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,181
And it's interesting to note that this book was written in 1904,

10
00:00:37,842 --> 00:00:40,063
which is four years before the Model T Ford.

11
00:00:40,743 --> 00:00:44,885
So, you know, there were automobiles and electric lights and things like that,

12
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:46,465
but they were brand new, all right?

13
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:48,586
It was a time sort of like now when everything was changing.

14
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:52,148
But these characters, although they would come to life,

15
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:53,608
they were always a little bit awkward, right?

16
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:56,450
There were things about them that were not quite right,

17
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,050
not quite lifelike.

18
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,212
So Jack, for instance, can't change his expression because it's carved into his pumpkin.

19
00:01:02,672 --> 00:01:06,394
So if he, you know, something sad happens and he doesn't want to be smiling,

20
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:10,855
he actually has to take his hand and put it over his mouth to block his expression.

21
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:12,796
A sawhorse moves in sort of awkward ways.

22
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,177
Eventually they make this character who's named Gump.

23
00:01:15,738 --> 00:01:17,899
who's made out of two sofas and some palm fronds.

24
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,922
And they use Gump to fly away and get away from the bad guy.

25
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:25,486
But they forget to make any way for Gump to be able to turn, so he can only go in straight

26
00:01:25,526 --> 00:01:25,746
lines.

27
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:28,308
They have to kind of aim them the way they want to go, and then they can fly off in that

28
00:01:28,348 --> 00:01:28,669
direction.

29
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:32,592
And that seems like a really good analogy to me for the struggles that we have when

30
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:34,013
we bring our characters to life.

31
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:39,498
And we really are trying not to have those awkward moments when they don't move quite

32
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,960
right or they don't quite have the capability they need.

33
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:43,841
And so they don't feel alive.

34
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:47,549
So I'm going to talk about character AI today.

35
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:50,330
This is not really going to be a technical talk.

36
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,411
There might be a few tidbits.

37
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:54,993
But just thinking about the types of characters I've done, right?

38
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:59,895
Animals for water shows in Zoo Tycoon 2 Marine Mania.

39
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:03,357
This boxy dog character was made out of nine boxes.

40
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:06,979
We used them for a tech demo for what eventually turned into World of Zoo.

41
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:09,500
We were making our next generation animal AI at Blue Fang.

42
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:13,542
Characters in Red Dead going about their everyday lives.

43
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,059
Uh, Angry Granny is a mixed reality character.

44
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,841
She's actually projected on the wall.

45
00:02:19,937 --> 00:02:21,658
These characters are the latest game I've been working on.

46
00:02:21,678 --> 00:02:22,539
It's an educational game.

47
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,800
These are Mars rovers that have crash landed on Mars,

48
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,801
and they have to build a base for humans who are on the way.

49
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:30,103
So there's big differences between all these characters

50
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:31,764
in terms of the types of technology.

51
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:34,865
In Zoo Tycoon 2, we didn't even have blending.

52
00:02:35,025 --> 00:02:36,666
All of our animations had to link together

53
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:38,827
with transition animation, because we had no way

54
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,448
to automate transitions.

55
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:43,029
And then you look at Red Dead, huge budget,

56
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:44,170
lots and lots of assets.

57
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,711
You can throw in everything in the kitchen sink.

58
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:48,272
And then, you know, Boxy Dog, the other extreme.

59
00:02:48,532 --> 00:02:50,493
But the great thing about Boxy Dog, it was a tech demo.

60
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:54,015
Our animators could turn out 15, 20 animations a day for Boxy Dog.

61
00:02:54,396 --> 00:02:56,257
So we could iterate really, really quickly.

62
00:02:58,064 --> 00:03:02,387
So, depending on what you've got, your technology is going to be different, but the mindset,

63
00:03:02,447 --> 00:03:06,530
the philosophy, the craft that you bring to making your characters is the same.

64
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,411
So that's the stuff I really want to talk about today.

65
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:11,093
And I'm really interested in non-combat behavior.

66
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:16,457
So some of this stuff will apply to combat behavior too, but combat behavior is comparatively

67
00:03:16,577 --> 00:03:16,817
easy.

68
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,479
I hate to even use the word easy in reference to game AI.

69
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,382
The non-combat behavior is much harder to get right,

70
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:26,044
but that's really where I feel like the industry's pushing forward,

71
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:29,326
getting more story, deeper experiences, more emotional experiences,

72
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,088
by having characters that do more than just chew to chew.

73
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:38,253
So I want to start out just with a little bit of video

74
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:40,054
that we used at Blue Fang.

75
00:03:41,035 --> 00:03:41,515
Oh, where am I?

76
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:41,936
Here we go.

77
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:47,320
So this is just some reference video of a tiger.

78
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,841
Can I make it big?

79
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:52,959
And we just wanted to get a tiger laying still, not doing much.

80
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,559
So you notice the tiger's constantly looking around.

81
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,120
You're not quite sure what he's looking at.

82
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,200
It almost doesn't matter, right?

83
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,161
But it's clear that it's paying attention to the environment.

84
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:01,961
Tongue motion in the breathing.

85
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:03,742
You get some twitches in the flanks here.

86
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:06,403
This big, characteristic, oval-shaped yawn.

87
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:07,843
There are some twitches.

88
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:10,784
Not any tail movement at the moment, but the tail can also move.

89
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:11,644
Here's the yawn again.

90
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:14,825
I recommend not getting this close to the tiger's yawn, by the way.

91
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:15,785
That's a bad idea.

92
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:19,546
So what did we just see there?

93
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,902
The character is constantly moving, constantly attending, right?

94
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:28,003
The characters are never completely still, they never freeze.

95
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:29,663
Yeah, I think we know that by now.

96
00:04:29,984 --> 00:04:31,484
But the attending is really interesting.

97
00:04:31,664 --> 00:04:33,025
Looking around at the world around them,

98
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:35,126
Dave drilled on this a little bit this morning,

99
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:36,807
is really, really important.

100
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:40,989
No looping or repetitive animations anywhere in that tiger.

101
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:42,682
because it's not animated.

102
00:04:43,664 --> 00:04:46,067
We're not going to get away from looping and repetitive animations,

103
00:04:46,588 --> 00:04:48,131
but again, as Jillian pointed out,

104
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:50,214
humans are really good pattern matchers.

105
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:53,740
So those looping and repetitive animations start to be spotted,

106
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,282
so we need to find ways to disguise them.

107
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,181
No straight lines, no crisp turns, right?

108
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,002
When we're building AI, we use math,

109
00:05:00,202 --> 00:05:02,924
and math does really nice things with straight lines

110
00:05:03,164 --> 00:05:05,865
and moving along the circumference of a circle and splines,

111
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:07,926
and none of those things look really natural.

112
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:10,207
So anything you can do to fuzzify them

113
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:13,349
helps make the character feel more realistic,

114
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:16,050
except when the fuzzification makes them look less realistic,

115
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,871
which I guess is part of the craft, right?

116
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,213
And at the end of the day, the character is believable, organic,

117
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:23,494
grounded in and reactive to the world around him.

118
00:05:23,514 --> 00:05:24,875
And this is the stuff we want to achieve.

119
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,076
And if we're going to be photorealistic,

120
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,217
you can push on graphics all day long,

121
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:31,679
but if your behavior isn't realistic,

122
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:34,040
then it's never going to feel real,

123
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,821
no matter how photorealistic you get it.

124
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,795
So the first point I want to bring out is the idea of an AI artist.

125
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:42,918
You hear a lot of talk about AI designers.

126
00:05:42,938 --> 00:05:46,244
It's been sort of hip for the last 5-10 years to talk about AI designers

127
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:48,227
and how close AI sits with design.

128
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:49,809
And that's absolutely true.

129
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,273
But I haven't heard a lot of talk about AI in art.

130
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:56,475
And my argument here isn't that we all need to go start making our own assets.

131
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:58,256
That's exactly wrong.

132
00:05:58,656 --> 00:06:00,497
But we need to learn to think like artists.

133
00:06:00,637 --> 00:06:04,019
Most of us were trained in technical fields with a technical skill set.

134
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:06,320
Artists are trained with a whole different skill set.

135
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,881
We need to be able to bring that skill set to our games

136
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:11,242
if we want to make believable and compelling characters.

137
00:06:12,202 --> 00:06:14,223
So become an observer of life, right?

138
00:06:14,263 --> 00:06:15,244
Become a people watcher.

139
00:06:15,284 --> 00:06:16,324
Look at the world around you.

140
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:21,805
watch different people in different situations and how they stand, interact, gesture.

141
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:26,328
When we were working on Boxy Dog, our animator, we all had dogs at home and we'd bring in video

142
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:32,012
of our dogs playing. And the animator would take the video and he'd cut it apart into like

143
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:36,715
almost second by second. And he'd say, see this motion? This is a playbill. See how his head's

144
00:06:36,755 --> 00:06:41,057
down and his tail's up and his butt's wagging and he's super excited? That means he wants to

145
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:44,620
play with you. And see this where he comes over and he sits down and he looks up at you like this?

146
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,221
This is a solicit close. This means he wants something.

147
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:48,663
and you need to figure out what he wants.

148
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:50,185
And see how he goes over to the door,

149
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:51,126
and he scratches at the door,

150
00:06:51,186 --> 00:06:52,467
or he looks at you and he kind of whines?

151
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:53,929
That's a solicit far.

152
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:57,192
And that, you know, every motion that the animal did,

153
00:06:57,492 --> 00:07:00,496
the animator would pick apart and say what that motion means.

154
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:02,398
Right? We need to get good at that,

155
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,819
because that's what we then turn around

156
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:05,301
and build our behavior out of.

157
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:07,703
So you can watch people in different situations.

158
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:10,006
I don't have to pick, you know, dig into every one of these.

159
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:12,707
How people move down the hallway, even, you know,

160
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:13,868
simple stuff like that is a good thing.

161
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:15,669
I've been noticing I moved up to the mountains,

162
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,310
as I've told a lot of people the last couple days.

163
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,611
And I go skiing a lot,

164
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:21,252
which is part of the reason I moved to the mountains.

165
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:23,993
The way people hold doors for each other at ski mountains

166
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:26,595
is very different than the way they hold doors

167
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:27,615
in the office place.

168
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:30,657
Because you've got a lot of little four-year-olds

169
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:32,758
and six-year-olds trying to walk around in ski boots

170
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,179
just about falling over.

171
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:36,760
And people have a lot more patience for holding the door

172
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,521
for that harried mother trying to get her kids

173
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:39,561
dressed and out the door.

174
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:42,923
you know, in the office you hand the door to the person behind you and you blow through.

175
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:47,705
So, you know, the way you hold the door says something about your mind state,

176
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:51,247
the fact that you're on vacation, the fact you're more relaxed, where you are,

177
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:56,170
the little smile on your faces, you see the cute little six-year-olds and they remind you of when your kid was six,

178
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,630
right, all of that kind of stuff.

179
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:02,706
Another thing artists are very, very good at is constructive criticism.

180
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:05,207
You really need to really crave criticism, right?

181
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:07,948
Get your ego out of the way, which is hard to do, right?

182
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:09,849
It's easy to say it's really hard to do.

183
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:12,830
And get people to tell you what's wrong with your work.

184
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,331
What's the worst thing about it?

185
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:18,835
A lot of times I'll get somebody to look at it and they'll want to be polite and they'll say,

186
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:22,239
Oh wow, that was awesome. I really love this and that. This was really cool.

187
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:23,780
And you know, that's great. Thank you.

188
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:26,463
But what was wrong, right? What could have done better?

189
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:29,706
What did you see that wasn't quite right? Or what didn't you like?

190
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:31,948
People don't want to tell you the negative stuff,

191
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:33,228
but that's the stuff you really need.

192
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:35,409
Lots of eyes on it, of course.

193
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,931
Spouse and friends are great people to go to.

194
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:39,592
Players, of course.

195
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:41,913
Although players are biased, any of these you have to be able to

196
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:44,534
filter what they say and get the real meaning out of it.

197
00:08:44,594 --> 00:08:45,655
Players especially.

198
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:47,336
Players just want to be super powerful.

199
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:49,478
So you have to filter that a little harder.

200
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:51,661
Getting the artists and animators to look at it

201
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,142
is a really good place to start.

202
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:55,945
Although the artists and animators have some of the same problem as you do,

203
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:58,248
which is that they're too close to it.

204
00:08:58,308 --> 00:08:59,089
They built it.

205
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:03,034
And so, like you, they're going to see what they think they put there.

206
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,537
And that may not be what other people will see.

207
00:09:06,857 --> 00:09:09,159
And if you show it to a lot of people, they may see different things,

208
00:09:09,219 --> 00:09:10,900
which is why you need to get a lot of eyes on it.

209
00:09:11,381 --> 00:09:13,843
QA, of course, but again, QA is too close to it,

210
00:09:13,863 --> 00:09:15,224
and they're going to look at it way too much.

211
00:09:15,845 --> 00:09:17,966
So the more different eyes you can get,

212
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,590
the more fresh sets of eyes you can get as it changes over time, the better.

213
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:28,458
When I'm building AI, I really like to try and build it bottom up.

214
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,540
So everybody's probably familiar with the idea, top down,

215
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,642
a sort of game requirements come down, the game is going to be this,

216
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:34,882
the story is going to be that, right?

217
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:39,685
And bottom up is I'm building pieces of behavior up into larger systems,

218
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:40,546
into story.

219
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:43,728
As I was looking for, to steal graphics on the web,

220
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:46,569
I found this blog that had this graphic which I stole,

221
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:48,811
but the blog is actually a pretty good description of these ideas.

222
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,460
So thinking about the tiger, right?

223
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,361
Start building the little stuff, the breathing,

224
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:56,301
the fidgets, yawning, stretching, tail motions,

225
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:58,362
those twitches in the flanks, right?

226
00:09:58,662 --> 00:10:01,342
Get the attention right, get the character looking around.

227
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:04,823
And then from that, build performances,

228
00:10:04,923 --> 00:10:07,064
sitting performances, standing, laying down,

229
00:10:07,124 --> 00:10:09,004
walking, running, and these performances

230
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:11,485
should have as many knobs on them as possible, right?

231
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:13,565
I don't just want to get the character walking,

232
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,806
I want to get the character walking when he's tired,

233
00:10:16,126 --> 00:10:18,126
when he's sad, when he's excited, right?

234
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,487
These walks are gonna be different.

235
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:23,013
So if I can put knobs on them to change the performances,

236
00:10:23,453 --> 00:10:25,797
then I can build those up into my larger behaviors,

237
00:10:25,878 --> 00:10:28,001
playing, eating, sleeping, fighting, working,

238
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:29,183
whatever your game has in it,

239
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:31,347
with those knobs tweaking the behavior

240
00:10:31,387 --> 00:10:33,170
to make it appropriate to the context.

241
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:38,400
I mentioned the animation loop, breaking the animation loop.

242
00:10:38,441 --> 00:10:39,421
So this is Angry Granny.

243
00:10:39,461 --> 00:10:44,065
This is a character that I worked on at Lockheed Martin.

244
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:46,207
Not the level of graphics that we're used to.

245
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:47,688
This was another very fast demo.

246
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:49,870
I had about three months to build this character from scratch.

247
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:55,054
But one of the things that we wanted to do was work on breaking the animation loop, so

248
00:10:55,094 --> 00:10:59,998
the character would sort of stay alive for 10, 15 minutes, even though we had a relatively

249
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:00,959
small amount of assets.

250
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:04,826
One of the great tricks for that is to take your looping animations,

251
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,307
make sure they're different lengths,

252
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,068
and then use different animations on different parts of the body.

253
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:11,589
So the lower body has one set of sort of pacing animations.

254
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:14,710
She's got to stay, she's projected on the wall, so she can't move very far.

255
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,732
Um, the upper body has gestures, you know, and other animations,

256
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,412
but because they're asynchronous,

257
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:22,453
when I see the same upper body animation happening,

258
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,854
the lower body's doing something different.

259
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:26,355
So it looks different. It looks like I'm doing it again,

260
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,016
not like I'm playing the same animation a second time.

261
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:33,137
And you can split out breathing, attention, expression.

262
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:34,478
On the tiger, you can do the tail.

263
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:38,020
Also, anything you can split out and do asynchronously

264
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,062
is gonna help to break out, break up your looping animations.

265
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:44,765
The other things to think about, where's the next part?

266
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:46,145
There we go.

267
00:11:46,526 --> 00:11:47,566
Is avoiding repetition.

268
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,328
So aside from looping animations, gestures, for instance, right.

269
00:11:50,348 --> 00:11:51,729
She has a lot of these big, you know,

270
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:55,151
this gesture, right, and this gesture, and this gesture, right.

271
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,393
And when you see those gestures again,

272
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,537
you want it to look like she's doing the same.

273
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:03,079
Ideally, you don't see them more than once.

274
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,280
If you do see them more than once,

275
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:06,522
you want it to look like she's doing

276
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,705
the same gesture a second time,

277
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:12,008
not like she's playing the same animation more than once.

278
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:14,471
So if you're Red Dead Redemption, right,

279
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:15,351
and you can afford.

280
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,292
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assets, or some,

281
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,254
I don't know what the number is, some insane number of animations, right?

282
00:12:21,514 --> 00:12:24,216
It's not so bad, because you can just avoid playing the same animation again.

283
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:29,480
But if you haven't got Red Dead's budget, then the more you can do to vary those animations,

284
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:31,922
maybe change the speed you play it at.

285
00:12:32,022 --> 00:12:35,684
So a great animation to think about is that sort of oval-shaped yawning animation

286
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:36,505
that the tiger had.

287
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:38,667
Change the speed.

288
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:41,869
So, you know, he yawns faster, he yawns slower,

289
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:43,150
I don't know if it's a he or a she.

290
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:47,435
Or even vary the speed over the course of the animation,

291
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,996
right, so it sort of starts fast and then it stretches out

292
00:12:50,056 --> 00:12:50,757
to the side.

293
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:52,638
Or maybe it starts slow, but then it

294
00:12:52,678 --> 00:12:54,258
accelerates as it goes.

295
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,300
Have parameters that tell you how much you can tweak those

296
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,422
values, and then tweak them at random at run time to get

297
00:13:00,502 --> 00:13:02,303
different animations out of that one asset.

298
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:04,904
Especially good if you're working on a Wii game, which

299
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:07,226
is where the tiger was headed, World of Zoo, where you have

300
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,507
very limited numbers of animations that you can afford

301
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:09,927
in memory.

302
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:12,749
But changing the speed of playback isn't actually that

303
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:13,129
big a deal.

304
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:17,109
Changing blend weights, getting into more experimental,

305
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:20,312
like I haven't actually tried it, but it would be interesting stuff, right?

306
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:24,516
You could try actually tweaking bone positions to make the yawn taller,

307
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:25,718
or make the yawn wider.

308
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:30,002
Add in some purlin noise to get a little bit of wiggle on top of your animations.

309
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:33,125
If you don't know what purlin noise is, go look it up.

310
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:35,708
And beyond just animation,

311
00:13:38,543 --> 00:13:40,604
Voice-over is another great place for this, right?

312
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:42,384
All of your speech, all of your dialogue.

313
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:47,086
So with Granny, we had a professional actress who recorded all of our dialogue,

314
00:13:47,686 --> 00:13:50,547
which was in Pashto, which is the language that they speak in Afghanistan.

315
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:52,227
More about that tomorrow.

316
00:13:55,171 --> 00:13:57,393
The actress recorded three or four takes of every line,

317
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:59,935
so rather than just keeping my favorite take of each line,

318
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:01,696
I kept all four, right?

319
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:04,099
And then when she says the same line again,

320
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:06,901
I would just play a different take,

321
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:08,522
so it sounds like she says the line again.

322
00:14:09,923 --> 00:14:12,385
Some things, like when they question her, she might

323
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:15,568
say yes or no repeatedly. So I had twenty

324
00:14:15,628 --> 00:14:18,210
takes of yes and twenty takes of no,

325
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,612
and that way, every time she says yes, it's

326
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:22,493
a little bit different. And I even sort of

327
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:24,455
build it so the intensity builds up over time

328
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:25,936
a little bit, so she'd start to sound more

329
00:14:25,956 --> 00:14:26,576
exasperated.

330
00:14:27,297 --> 00:14:30,239
It would have been nicer to have a model

331
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,600
for that, but there, there wasn't time.

332
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:35,959
Attention, as I said, is really, really important.

333
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,941
The simplest way is to build some head motion into your animation, right, which is what

334
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:44,782
I think of as neutral attention, because it's just the head motion that's built into the

335
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,583
animation itself.

336
00:14:46,563 --> 00:14:50,785
That's expensive to do, and it also means that it's, unless you know exactly where the

337
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:54,526
character's gonna be, you can't have the attention be directed, right.

338
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:58,388
It's gonna be wandering, which is great when you're looking at a room full of people, for

339
00:14:58,428 --> 00:15:00,549
instance, giving a talk, because nobody knows what I'm looking at.

340
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:05,292
But if the player starts, now I'm looking at Dave.

341
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:10,675
If the player starts trying to figure out what they're looking at, right, it's going

342
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:11,175
to fall flat.

343
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:16,178
Again, you could just pick random head look targets and get that same sort of wandering

344
00:15:16,218 --> 00:15:19,839
gaze like the tiger is doing if you're not too worried about what to look at.

345
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,021
What we did in Red Dead was we had characters pick random entities to look at.

346
00:15:24,622 --> 00:15:26,704
And there was a little bit of utility going on

347
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:29,146
to wait the entity, so if I look at somebody over here

348
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:31,629
for a couple of seconds, then when I pick somebody else,

349
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:33,110
I don't want to pick the person next to them, right,

350
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,372
because that's not enough head motion to read to the player.

351
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:36,433
I want to overact.

352
00:15:36,753 --> 00:15:38,395
So humans might really do that,

353
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:40,257
but I'm going to look at somebody over here next,

354
00:15:40,537 --> 00:15:41,878
and then I'm going to look at somebody back there.

355
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:43,880
So how far away my targets are

356
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,261
is one of the weights that goes into it.

357
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:47,864
As the player becomes more infamous,

358
00:15:49,726 --> 00:15:52,627
They get a little bit more weight, but you want to be careful of that.

359
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:56,150
In Bully, for instance, which was one of Rockstar's earlier games,

360
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,491
before Red Dead, towards the end of the game,

361
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:01,573
as the player became really infamous, everybody started staring at them.

362
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:04,635
And so, you know, I'd be riding my bike around town, right,

363
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,876
on my way to paint some graffiti on a wall or something,

364
00:16:07,097 --> 00:16:09,058
and everybody's staring at me as I go by, like,

365
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:11,059
what? What did I do? I didn't do anything.

366
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:12,620
I'm just a good kid going to school here.

367
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,961
Why are you staring at me?

368
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:15,342
Look over there.

369
00:16:16,562 --> 00:16:17,483
So that gets a little creepy.

370
00:16:19,115 --> 00:16:23,198
Another great example was EverQuest 2 was one of the first games that got attention in.

371
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:26,701
And all of my friends who'd played the original EverQuest and then played EQ2

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,984
commented on how much it sold the characters that they looked at you.

373
00:16:31,305 --> 00:16:33,426
But at the same time, if you're playing a great big troll,

374
00:16:33,947 --> 00:16:37,270
and you go up to a little gnome vendor and you open up the vendor screen,

375
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,772
then they're going to look up at you like this, right?

376
00:16:40,052 --> 00:16:43,435
And then if you go and get lunch and come back half an hour later,

377
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:44,676
and the vendor screen is still open,

378
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:48,699
they will still be standing here like this, staring at you with a crick in their neck.

379
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:52,751
So, one of the important things about attention is thinking about duration.

380
00:16:53,132 --> 00:16:54,573
How long should you look at something?

381
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:59,536
If you're just like the tiger, looking around, you notice the tiger's gaze shifts pretty

382
00:16:59,576 --> 00:17:00,776
quickly, every couple of seconds.

383
00:17:01,657 --> 00:17:03,698
So you can play with tweaking those parameters.

384
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:08,381
I think we ended up in Red Dead, I don't remember, but I want to say it was like 15 to 25 seconds,

385
00:17:08,882 --> 00:17:12,384
pick a random number somewhere in there, and that was your duration, to keep the attention

386
00:17:12,424 --> 00:17:12,684
moving.

387
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:16,766
You probably want to move the attention a little bit more than a real human would.

388
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:20,445
because you want to show the attention moving.

389
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:23,606
The attention being fixed doesn't sell the fact

390
00:17:23,706 --> 00:17:24,867
that they're paying attention,

391
00:17:24,887 --> 00:17:26,408
that they're grounded in the world around them,

392
00:17:26,468 --> 00:17:27,868
that they're aware of the world around them

393
00:17:27,908 --> 00:17:28,949
and paying attention to it.

394
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:31,250
All it does is, you know,

395
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,491
it looks like part of the animation.

396
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:36,133
The next step.

397
00:17:37,337 --> 00:17:38,697
now that you've got an attention model,

398
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:40,918
is to build reactions off of that.

399
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,458
So players should not react

400
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:44,819
in .2 seconds or .4 seconds

401
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:47,039
until after they see something.

402
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,900
So if there's an event

403
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,021
that goes on over there, right, I might be oblivious.

404
00:17:51,081 --> 00:17:52,161
I might be looking over here.

405
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:54,862
And I might be completely unaware of that event.

406
00:17:54,882 --> 00:17:56,922
And that's fine, right? Everybody shouldn't whip their head

407
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,683
around and stare when an event happens.

408
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:00,663
That's a little bit creepy and unrealistic, too.

409
00:18:00,943 --> 00:18:02,684
But I might notice these guys all looking over there

410
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:04,604
and then I might go, oh, wow, look at that, right?

411
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,843
One of Disney's 12 principles of animation,

412
00:18:08,863 --> 00:18:09,624
and I don't know the other 11,

413
00:18:11,866 --> 00:18:13,128
is anticipation,

414
00:18:13,528 --> 00:18:17,093
which is really powerful and something that we as AI programmers can take advantage of.

415
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:20,477
So it started with the notion that, you know, before you jump, you have to bend your knees, right?

416
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,559
Before you swing a golf club, you have to have a backswing.

417
00:18:25,262 --> 00:18:25,803
But in...

418
00:18:27,744 --> 00:18:30,446
Cartoons in general, because this idea has exploded,

419
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:33,750
before any big reaction, any big moment,

420
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,912
there's a little bit of anticipation

421
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:38,015
that tells you something's about to happen.

422
00:18:38,715 --> 00:18:39,957
Animators could probably describe this

423
00:18:39,997 --> 00:18:40,878
way better than I can.

424
00:18:41,718 --> 00:18:43,479
But get that notion into your AI.

425
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,060
If everybody...

426
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,002
People remember Damian Isla's talk from

427
00:18:46,022 --> 00:18:47,383
a bunch of years ago now,

428
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,664
when he had the little triangle

429
00:18:48,984 --> 00:18:49,925
trying to find the player,

430
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:50,746
and it was searching around,

431
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:51,627
and it would look here,

432
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:52,588
and when it didn't see the player,

433
00:18:52,668 --> 00:18:53,909
it would freeze for a moment,

434
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:54,910
like it was surprised.

435
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,832
That moment of anticipation, like,

436
00:18:57,312 --> 00:18:59,234
oh, it can't find the player,

437
00:18:59,274 --> 00:19:00,555
and then it would go look somewhere else.

438
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:01,736
And that moment

439
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:03,458
completely sold the character,

440
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:05,079
even though the character was a triangle.

441
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:09,912
So get that moment of anticipation, eyes widening, whatever,

442
00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:13,415
and then the response to the event that the character just saw.

443
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:18,161
I'm actually doing really well on time this time.

444
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:20,303
Last slide.

445
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:25,168
So, and this, I don't have a lot here other than just the thought.

446
00:19:26,218 --> 00:19:27,839
Puppies don't use path planners.

447
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:29,940
They weave all over the place, right?

448
00:19:30,381 --> 00:19:33,522
And really, humans don't use perfect straight lines

449
00:19:33,602 --> 00:19:36,143
and crisp turns either, unless they're in the military

450
00:19:36,223 --> 00:19:37,444
and they're marching and working at it.

451
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,966
So whatever you can do to fuzzy that path.

452
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:44,748
We've used flow fields to try and get fuzzy paths

453
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:46,008
with the puppies.

454
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:47,649
Flow fields have all sorts of other problems.

455
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:49,090
I don't know that I recommend that solution.

456
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,951
But it did get us a lot of wander.

457
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:56,626
I really like the way parkour is looking.

458
00:19:57,126 --> 00:20:01,269
One of the great things about parkour is the way that it blends different types of motion

459
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:06,613
together, so they can go from running to jumping to rolling to crawling to swimming to climbing,

460
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:10,356
you know, sort of whatever, smooth motion blending.

461
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:15,620
But parkour is typically very linear, very sort of aggressive, right?

462
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,963
I want to get all of those blended animation types as you move naturally through the world,

463
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:23,585
but with much more free motion.

464
00:20:25,514 --> 00:20:28,416
So that's all I've got. I've got way more time for questions than I expected.

465
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:39,222
Dave says four minutes.

466
00:20:41,163 --> 00:20:45,506
Remember, please use the microphones up here if you have a question, so it ends up on the

467
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:50,168
tape. Notice that we still say tape. How awkward is that? It's probably not being picked up

468
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:51,009
by the tape, I'm sure.

469
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,534
Instead of having a bunch of animations for the tiger,

470
00:20:56,554 --> 00:20:59,997
could we use AI to build inside of the tiger,

471
00:21:00,037 --> 00:21:01,898
and then those animations might come out of that?

472
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,781
So...

473
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:09,565
Procedural animation is really hard.

474
00:21:10,843 --> 00:21:12,965
If you've got a system that'll do it, that's awesome, right?

475
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:13,886
And it'll buy you a lot.

476
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:18,450
But I haven't seen a lot of procedural animation systems

477
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,231
that are completely there.

478
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:21,173
There's stuff like natural motion, right?

479
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:23,755
Which Red Dead used, which buys you a lot,

480
00:21:23,895 --> 00:21:24,976
but is really expensive.

481
00:21:25,377 --> 00:21:26,377
So it depends on what you're building.

482
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:28,900
It's part of the reason I wanted to stay away from technical, right?

483
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,461
If you've got those sorts of capabilities,

484
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:32,743
absolutely use them to make your characters.

485
00:21:34,065 --> 00:21:34,805
If you haven't got them,

486
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:36,947
then there are traditional techniques that work well too.

487
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:45,597
So this may be a little out of scope for this, but one of the things that you didn't talk

488
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,259
about was conversations and dialogue.

489
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,904
Is there anything that you can say about extending some of these principles to how AI handles

490
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:55,604
conversations?

491
00:21:56,144 --> 00:21:59,907
So I'll rant a little bit about what went wrong with conversations in Red Dead.

492
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:07,212
I've had thoughts about conversation, and really what I think I'd like to try, which

493
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:08,453
I didn't get to do on Red Dead.

494
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:14,144
is to tag up the, so you're gonna have a whole library of lines, of course.

495
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:17,165
And you're gonna have, you know, I play a statement,

496
00:22:17,305 --> 00:22:19,865
you respond to my statement, I play another statement,

497
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,626
you respond to, some sort of flow like that.

498
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:25,407
But to be able to tag those up so that you can get those flows to feel more natural,

499
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:30,669
I think would do a good job of taking us sort of to the next step of the random conversations

500
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:34,330
we see in games like Red Dead or Skyrim or, you know, any of lots of games.

501
00:22:37,335 --> 00:22:43,960
Kevin, based on your other experience, could you offer some advice on how to integrate

502
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,443
AI into game education?

503
00:22:47,683 --> 00:22:54,168
For instance, in a program that would involve a minor in game development?

504
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:00,493
That's a longer conversation, I think.

505
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:05,636
I mean, there are good books on game AI.

506
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,899
Certainly a game AI class is a great thing to have.

507
00:23:09,261 --> 00:23:15,309
I made the argument earlier today that game AI is something that we should be teaching

508
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:16,270
because it teaches...

509
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,552
So this is aside from this talk.

510
00:23:18,153 --> 00:23:19,515
But game AI teaches...

511
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:24,885
decision making, right? How to get computers to do things that look right, right?

512
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,106
Not necessarily that are intelligent, but that look right, that look intelligent.

513
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:31,287
And that's a set of techniques that are more widely applicable.

514
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:36,249
So maybe we should be pushing harder to get the rest of the world

515
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,449
to be attending this summit and listening to us talk.

516
00:23:38,469 --> 00:23:39,429
I don't know.

517
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,191
Anybody else?

518
00:23:44,271 --> 00:23:45,191
If I could, real quick.

519
00:23:47,447 --> 00:23:50,831
One of the things that you had mentioned is talking about attention shifting.

520
00:23:51,735 --> 00:23:54,335
of don't just continuously stare at one target.

521
00:23:54,455 --> 00:23:56,716
And that was, for those of you who were with us this morning,

522
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:59,056
for me and Mike, one of the things we did

523
00:23:59,256 --> 00:24:02,117
is we had a maximum run time on a behavior,

524
00:24:02,137 --> 00:24:03,637
and we actually used it with the look-ats.

525
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:05,857
Where within about five seconds,

526
00:24:05,918 --> 00:24:07,478
no, dude, move on, do something else.

527
00:24:07,878 --> 00:24:08,678
We would also say,

528
00:24:09,178 --> 00:24:11,159
don't come back to looking at the same person

529
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:12,959
for, you know, five, ten seconds.

530
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:14,559
And so it forced the character,

531
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:16,039
I'll look at you for a little bit,

532
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,220
I'll shift around, I'll look at different things.

533
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,060
But in forcing that, so rather than...

534
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,404
you're very important so I'm going to stare at you as you ride your bike down the street.

535
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:26,145
Mix it up a little bit.

536
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:30,888
And it's amazing how just doing that gives you that thing.

537
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:32,770
He's aware of his world.

538
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,690
Right.

539
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:37,833
Yeah, if you want the character to feel like it's in the...

540
00:24:38,474 --> 00:24:39,714
You think about animation, right?

541
00:24:39,754 --> 00:24:40,895
And it needs to have weight to it.

542
00:24:40,915 --> 00:24:42,176
It feels physically motivated.

543
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:47,380
If you want your character to feel like it's really in the world, it needs to have...

544
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,392
it needs to be aware of the world around it.

545
00:24:50,492 --> 00:24:52,333
And the way you show that is you show the character

546
00:24:52,453 --> 00:24:53,534
looking at the world around it.

547
00:24:54,115 --> 00:24:55,376
You show the attention shifting

548
00:24:55,516 --> 00:24:57,317
and show them responding to things they see.

549
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,521
Once you get the animation problem

550
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:02,662
and getting the head to look right,

551
00:25:02,782 --> 00:25:06,445
which is a little tricky, but is an animation problem,

552
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,608
then getting the character looking around

553
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:11,749
isn't actually that hard.

554
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,791
It's a week or two of work, I think,

555
00:25:13,831 --> 00:25:15,673
to get at least a decent baseline.

556
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:18,215
Everybody, let's thank Kevin.

557
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:18,957
Good stuff.
