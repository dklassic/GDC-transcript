1
00:00:07,194 --> 00:00:13,720
So yeah, my name is Kyle Bunk, and I am an animator at Fractice Games at the moment,

2
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:20,546
which we generally use 3D animation, but yeah, my presentation has nothing to do with 3D

3
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:21,106
animation.

4
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:22,627
It's actually involved in pixel art.

5
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:28,352
So I want to give people kind of a little bit of a background on myself.

6
00:00:29,353 --> 00:00:29,513
So

7
00:00:30,734 --> 00:00:34,176
This is before I even entered college or anything like that.

8
00:00:34,457 --> 00:00:36,038
During my early days in high school,

9
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:38,380
I would hang out in a lot of these spaces,

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,242
like DeviantArt, especially Newgrounds.

11
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:46,647
And from there, I kind of taught myself a lot of things,

12
00:00:46,727 --> 00:00:50,270
like Flash and sort of traditional animation stuff.

13
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:56,555
And this is actually the oldest thing on the internet

14
00:00:56,575 --> 00:00:57,436
that I've ever made.

15
00:00:57,456 --> 00:00:58,897
It's like...

16
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,647
It's not even really animation.

17
00:01:01,707 --> 00:01:03,908
It's more just clip art, just moving.

18
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:06,388
And it was from an English project.

19
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:08,609
I had to recreate something from Macbeth.

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,091
And I did it pretty accurately, but I had Macbeth say the F

21
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:15,351
word at the end for some reason.

22
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,792
I don't know, I thought that was really funny at the time

23
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:18,612
when I was a kid.

24
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,053
And it worked on Newgrounds.

25
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:25,534
But from there, I kind of wanted to do something more,

26
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:27,775
that's what I wanted to do professionally.

27
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:27,835
So.

28
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:33,070
I ended up going to a two-year school in Delaware

29
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,491
with the intent of transferring those two years

30
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:38,272
into a bigger college, like Pratt Institute,

31
00:01:38,492 --> 00:01:42,014
or Academy of Arts, or SVA, or something like that.

32
00:01:42,174 --> 00:01:46,536
But unfortunately, because of just personal financial

33
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:48,817
constraints, I couldn't do that.

34
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:53,339
So I had to find other venues to kind of express animation.

35
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,460
So I ended up going to Animation Mentor,

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,261
where I transferred most of my 2D skills

37
00:01:58,301 --> 00:01:59,201
into 3D animation.

38
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:05,020
And that ended up landing me in a job at Gameloft,

39
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,343
which was their studio in New York City,

40
00:02:09,084 --> 00:02:10,445
until they closed down.

41
00:02:10,585 --> 00:02:13,107
And then I've been looking for work for quite a bit,

42
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,809
until I was picked up by Firaxis,

43
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:18,091
where I worked on the expansion for XCOM 2.

44
00:02:20,077 --> 00:02:25,842
But in between that time, I actually was looking for work.

45
00:02:25,902 --> 00:02:31,206
But I was also doing these pixel art things over the time.

46
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:33,287
I would do these over the internet.

47
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:37,590
And I'm actually wondering, how many people

48
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:39,652
have actually seen my stuff?

49
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:42,654
Oh my god.

50
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:44,115
That's a lot more than I thought.

51
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:47,782
See, I get the numbers on my phone,

52
00:02:47,822 --> 00:02:49,963
but I don't actually see people.

53
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:53,325
So it's kind of nice seeing an actual number.

54
00:02:55,386 --> 00:02:55,986
And here's more.

55
00:02:56,827 --> 00:02:59,448
So I'll let this play for a little bit.

56
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:03,990
So the reason why I wanted to go over my background

57
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,112
was just to tell you guys more what I went into.

58
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,980
like pixel art knowing, because I wanted to do pixel art.

59
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,622
I had a lot of friends of mine who were really into it,

60
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:18,003
and I kind of wanted to jump in.

61
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:21,905
But I had to kind of know my limitations.

62
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:24,647
Like I knew animation just through 3D,

63
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:28,609
and like my days doing pencil and paper animations.

64
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:33,935
But the main challenge for me is that I wasn't really a designer.

65
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:37,938
Like, I couldn't really come up with a character, like an original thing.

66
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:41,802
So that's kind of why most of my animations are, like,

67
00:03:41,862 --> 00:03:43,904
based on existing properties, like Overwatch.

68
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:45,886
And, um...

69
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,496
Past that, like modeling, texturing, and rigging

70
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:53,318
was a kind of game development pipeline

71
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,379
that I'm not really familiar with.

72
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,960
Like I know enough to do some basic effects,

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,483
but to do anything like sort of pixel art sprites with 3D

74
00:04:04,004 --> 00:04:05,305
was kind of outside of my realm.

75
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:09,067
And another thing that was very different

76
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:11,108
was when I first started doing animation

77
00:04:11,248 --> 00:04:12,869
during like my high school days,

78
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,030
the internet was really different.

79
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,271
Like you would have...

80
00:04:17,452 --> 00:04:21,775
like animations would actually last quite a bit like flash videos would be

81
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:26,579
two to three minutes or like even longer and nowadays everything is in a gif

82
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:31,602
format so everything went from like two to three minutes to like three seconds

83
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:35,725
so i had to really fit my skills into a different

84
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:38,927
sort of medium that the internet sort of became

85
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,655
So what I want to say is that whatever you know,

86
00:04:44,775 --> 00:04:47,115
whether it be traditional animation or 3D

87
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:51,276
or whatever it is, you should really base your pixel art

88
00:04:51,996 --> 00:04:53,237
on that skill set that you have.

89
00:04:54,057 --> 00:04:56,677
So I have three different examples.

90
00:04:56,737 --> 00:04:58,698
I have this sprite from King of Fighters.

91
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:03,159
And that's basically using modeling, texturing,

92
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:06,079
and that standard pipeline that you

93
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:08,060
can make really amazing stuff out of it,

94
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,840
but that just wasn't my skill set.

95
00:05:11,238 --> 00:05:12,760
And I wasn't really an illustrator,

96
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,203
so I couldn't do the amazing backgrounds that you

97
00:05:15,223 --> 00:05:16,465
would see in Hyper Light Drifter.

98
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:19,108
But for something like Marvel versus Capcom,

99
00:05:19,148 --> 00:05:21,752
where the characters are relatively simple,

100
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:23,554
but also have really robust movement,

101
00:05:24,054 --> 00:05:25,817
I could kind of pull off something like that.

102
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:27,499
So.

103
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:32,897
I think what I want to say is that you can be creative with pixel art no matter what

104
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:33,777
your skill set is.

105
00:05:34,358 --> 00:05:40,300
And I actually included Mortal Kombat sprites because those are basically just mocap people

106
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,381
with cool costumes, I guess.

107
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:45,202
So if you're a good costume designer, you can do that.

108
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:48,023
And even mixed mediums, like you have...

109
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:50,885
Oh my god, I can't believe I don't know his name.

110
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:52,645
Is it Sub-Zero?

111
00:05:53,546 --> 00:05:53,946
It is.

112
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,947
I feel like the ice would be obvious.

113
00:05:57,703 --> 00:06:01,405
But yeah, you have something that is basically a motion

114
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:04,446
captured guy, or not really motion captured,

115
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:07,307
like an actual person doing an ice blast.

116
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:09,908
And then somebody had to do the animation for the ice

117
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:10,868
on top of it.

118
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:12,729
And you can get really cool results with that.

119
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:20,920
And for those of you who have seen my Mercy pixel art,

120
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:23,162
I don't know if many people know this,

121
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:25,985
but a lot of the effects that come off of her

122
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:29,748
were actually done in the Unreal Particle System.

123
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:31,730
And it was like the first time that I actually

124
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,792
used something outside of just straight up drawing it.

125
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:46,274
Usually the way I start is I, this is for like my McCree animation, I wanted him to do like a roll and like a gun shoot backwards.

126
00:06:46,995 --> 00:06:53,020
So there's actual footage of me kind of rolling forward and going backwards and it's like not really that great to be honest.

127
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:55,679
but it was better than nothing.

128
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,021
So to kind of go on top of that,

129
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:00,263
I looked at other things that really inspired me.

130
00:07:00,323 --> 00:07:03,285
Like one of my favorite animated sequences of all time

131
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:06,468
is the Asuka final fight from End of Evangelion.

132
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:08,930
And there's like this really cool role

133
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,631
that was done by Mitsuo Iso.

134
00:07:11,232 --> 00:07:13,474
And I wanted to incorporate a lot of that as well

135
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:14,715
into my role for McCree.

136
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:19,899
So, but before I even go into the animation process,

137
00:07:20,638 --> 00:07:23,640
I wanted to figure out kind of the design.

138
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,462
I know I said I wasn't really a designer,

139
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:29,366
but something that already exists

140
00:07:29,486 --> 00:07:30,767
is a lot easier to do that.

141
00:07:31,608 --> 00:07:35,131
So I kind of just came up with this still image

142
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:38,174
that I was gonna worry about animation later.

143
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:41,236
So with a still image,

144
00:07:41,256 --> 00:07:44,259
I also kind of figured out the colors

145
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:45,360
that I was going to use.

146
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:45,420
So.

147
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:52,698
I would use something called index colors, where basically I would just restrict myself

148
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:58,241
to the set number of colors, and I think the number here is like 32 colors, so it would

149
00:07:58,381 --> 00:07:59,461
be 32 bit, I guess.

150
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:01,682
I don't know if transparency counts, but...

151
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:06,879
So indexing your colors is actually really important

152
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,841
for pixel art, because if you get really far

153
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:12,123
into your animation and you realize, wow,

154
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:15,966
that red kind of sucks, you can actually go into your palette

155
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:17,927
and just do a color change, and it'll

156
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:21,009
change every frame simultaneously.

157
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:23,411
So you don't have to go back and recolor everything.

158
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:28,235
So if you do want to do pixel art like this,

159
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:29,936
definitely do that first.

160
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:32,318
So.

161
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:37,596
When I do animation, oh, wait a minute.

162
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:40,579
Oh, there's a slide transition.

163
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:48,306
So something that I think a lot of people are fascinated with

164
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:52,869
is that I actually use Flash to do most of my animations,

165
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,853
not just because I originally started out on Newgrounds,

166
00:08:56,873 --> 00:08:58,614
so I kind of have a bias towards it.

167
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:03,508
But also, vectors don't do this.

168
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:09,512
When you do pixel art, you can't really rotate or scale anything.

169
00:09:09,572 --> 00:09:13,455
If you rotate it, the pixels, they just kind of get messed up.

170
00:09:13,495 --> 00:09:18,378
There's just not enough data for it to cleanly translate.

171
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,641
And if you do this enough, you'll just kind of end up

172
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:23,022
with a mess of pixels.

173
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:25,163
Don't even think about scaling it,

174
00:09:25,183 --> 00:09:27,585
because scaling it just absolutely destroys it.

175
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,398
So that's important to me as a 3D animator as well.

176
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:33,540
I want to be able to not only draw my stuff,

177
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,582
but to also be able to rotate, translate, and scale

178
00:09:36,622 --> 00:09:39,985
these things just in each frame to be

179
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:43,748
able to get the best possible movement.

180
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:45,709
So for a while, I do stick to vectors.

181
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:48,972
The thing that stinks about.

182
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:54,964
Being in vectors for a while, though, is that whenever you export your thing into a more

183
00:09:55,004 --> 00:10:04,331
pixel program, you end up with this anti-alias hell image, where everything is just really

184
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:11,416
blurry on the edges and even on the inside, which looks fine in most art, but in pixel

185
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:13,158
art it's kind of hideous.

186
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:18,297
But we'll worry about that later.

187
00:10:18,497 --> 00:10:20,458
That's kind of another step.

188
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,222
So in actually doing these animations,

189
00:10:24,642 --> 00:10:26,524
I keep in mind a lot of these principles

190
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:30,568
of making sure that your pose and your animation

191
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:34,271
just stays very clear, just based on a silhouette.

192
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:38,054
And even the effects I make sure read really well since.

193
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:43,698
You know, it's only going to be seen on one end.

194
00:10:43,718 --> 00:10:46,499
I don't know if 3D games worry about this too much,

195
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,721
since you can see kind of the character in every single angle.

196
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:51,962
But for something like this, it's

197
00:10:52,002 --> 00:10:53,683
really important to nail down your silhouette.

198
00:10:53,723 --> 00:10:56,925
And I even have a bad example of a silhouette.

199
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:01,667
This is like midway of McCree's roll.

200
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:03,508
There's like a frame where you just can't,

201
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:06,870
he just turns into like a giant black ball, which

202
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,151
I wish I could figure out.

203
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:09,771
But.

204
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:14,555
So another thing is making sure that you're

205
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:15,416
spacing your frames.

206
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,497
I haven't done the effects yet, so you

207
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:19,418
see the crappy placeholders there.

208
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:24,462
But spacing is really important, because without it,

209
00:11:24,562 --> 00:11:27,164
you get a really awkward movement.

210
00:11:27,544 --> 00:11:32,427
The image to the right is just all the spacing just

211
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:33,068
put the same.

212
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:36,170
And you can see that it looks really robotic looking.

213
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,972
She goes into this anticipation, and then lifts off,

214
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:39,732
and then she just.

215
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:42,146
rises kind of slowly.

216
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:43,547
It looks really robotic.

217
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:48,189
So definitely when doing things like this,

218
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:49,329
keep in mind your spacing.

219
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:58,713
So smearing, this is something I don't know if 3D games worry

220
00:11:58,733 --> 00:11:59,353
about too much.

221
00:11:59,473 --> 00:12:02,434
But in 2D games, when your frame rate is really limited,

222
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:05,896
it's pretty important when you do a big transition.

223
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,823
between frames like the top frame you can see when the character is lifting his sword and swinging

224
00:12:12,883 --> 00:12:20,566
down it just kind of blinks to it and it's kind of jarring just because like there's not enough

225
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:27,189
frames to be able to show that actual sword swing so for something like that I would actually put

226
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:34,473
in a sphere it sphere smear just to kind of communicate that motion blur

227
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:43,493
And it also is really good for sort of hitboxes if your sprite is intended for a game.

228
00:12:46,338 --> 00:12:49,181
Smears also don't really have to look particularly good.

229
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:52,764
Here are some of my worst smears in all of my animations.

230
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:55,907
And actually, fun fact on Facebook,

231
00:12:55,967 --> 00:13:00,151
somebody paused on that Genji pose and then posted it,

232
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,193
and he's just like, look how big his butt is.

233
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:06,938
I felt really embarrassed, and I stopped doing that.

234
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,400
Yeah.

235
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:10,901
So.

236
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:11,522
Yeah.

237
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:15,064
But with that said, when you're doing an animation,

238
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:16,844
you should smear as much as you can.

239
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:19,885
I don't think people pausing on your animations

240
00:13:19,945 --> 00:13:23,246
and saying, look how bad it is, a smear shouldn't really

241
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,607
stop you from doing that.

242
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:30,369
Another thing is overlapping action.

243
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,750
I'll show you a GIF that I did that is pretty much nothing

244
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,390
but this.

245
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:38,852
But I wanted to show an example of when you don't

246
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:39,972
have overlapping action.

247
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:41,633
When you have all of your.

248
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:50,281
parts kind of just swinging and just translating at the same time, you kind of get something

249
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:52,683
really weird looking, like it doesn't look natural.

250
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:58,748
So when you do something overlapping, you really do want to break up the timing as much

251
00:13:58,788 --> 00:13:59,328
as you can.

252
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,173
So this is the animation that is basically nothing but overlap.

253
00:14:07,654 --> 00:14:09,415
The way she grapples with her hook.

254
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,471
pretty much beyond that.

255
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:15,114
There's not really any movement besides the actual hook itself.

256
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:17,216
So everything is overlapping with it.

257
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:21,860
And you can kind of see a very close relationship

258
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,122
between this and the previous example that I showed.

259
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:26,364
And I did want to go back and try

260
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:28,786
to remove all the overlap in this animation,

261
00:14:29,386 --> 00:14:31,328
but it would have been just way too much work,

262
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:33,530
and it just wouldn't have looked good at all.

263
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,391
So.

264
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:40,673
Doing the animate, so once you do the animation stuff,

265
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:45,335
that's when the cleanup begins,

266
00:14:45,575 --> 00:14:47,496
and it sounds as tedious as it is.

267
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:50,638
Basically, you have to go to every single frame and do this.

268
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,759
So, usually starting out with,

269
00:14:58,861 --> 00:15:00,002
sorry, losing my train of thought.

270
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:03,304
So, when I showed you guys the,

271
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:07,773
like badly anti-aliased image.

272
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:11,855
The way that I usually kind of fix it up

273
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:14,536
is just to do like a general marquise,

274
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:17,257
like a magic wand effect around everything,

275
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:19,958
and then just expand it one pixel,

276
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:21,078
and then delete everything.

277
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,600
It usually gets rid of most of the anti-aliasing, but.

278
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:29,345
Like, it might take away more than you want,

279
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:31,706
but when you're cleaning up the edges like that,

280
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,627
I think it's better to take away more and then add later

281
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:36,388
rather than take away too little

282
00:15:36,628 --> 00:15:39,810
and you just seeing like blurs still on the edge.

283
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,791
So, I don't know if I actually mentioned this,

284
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:45,752
but the program that I primarily use

285
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:47,693
for all this cleanup is Aseprite.

286
00:15:49,294 --> 00:15:52,875
It's a program that is on Steam and I really recommend it.

287
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:53,515
It's like $15.

288
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:53,695
And.

289
00:15:56,634 --> 00:16:00,617
It has a really robust timeline if you want to do pixel art

290
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:01,157
on your own.

291
00:16:03,258 --> 00:16:07,661
So from there, once I remove the anti-aliasing from the borders,

292
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:11,344
I try to go into the colors and try to really define them

293
00:16:11,384 --> 00:16:12,204
in the very beginning.

294
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,647
In this picture right here, there's

295
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,629
a very clear distinction between the green hues

296
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:22,291
and the bright pinks.

297
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:22,911
I burped there.

298
00:16:24,696 --> 00:16:29,278
and the black silhouette in the back.

299
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,279
So from here, I'm just basically trying

300
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:34,960
to break up all the colors from one another

301
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:40,763
and getting rid of all the aliasing from the drawing.

302
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:45,245
And also another note, remember alpha channels.

303
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:48,946
A lot of my original GIFs were pixel art,

304
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:50,887
but they're all rendered on a white background.

305
00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:54,459
Because I didn't think that people would...

306
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,081
I figured they'd just be used on the internet.

307
00:16:58,141 --> 00:16:59,842
You know, people would just share them on the internet.

308
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:03,524
But it turns out people like taking these sort of animations

309
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,865
and putting them on their Twitch streams.

310
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,907
And because of that, you really do need that transparency

311
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:11,108
for something like that.

312
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:14,510
So if you do pixel art, like just do a transparency.

313
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,711
Don't put it on a white layer.

314
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:17,932
So...

315
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:21,398
From there, after I divide up all my colors,

316
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:25,120
I really have to think about how to do my shading

317
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:29,844
for my sort of style.

318
00:17:30,464 --> 00:17:31,825
There's different things that you can do.

319
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:34,387
You can do hard gradient, which is basically

320
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:39,530
you just go ahead and you try to find the color

321
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,611
that's in between the two,

322
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:42,772
and you just kind of make this banding look.

323
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:46,093
Or you can do something called dithering,

324
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:50,436
where dithering was something that was done a lot back then

325
00:17:50,556 --> 00:17:52,577
because of color restrictions.

326
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:57,180
Like a lot of game artists, they wanted to have this sort

327
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,042
of gradient, but were really restricted by color,

328
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:02,704
so they had to do this.

329
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:05,786
And in some cases, it looks good,

330
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:08,728
but I find that a combination between the two looks best.

331
00:18:09,608 --> 00:18:12,830
So here's an example that I kind of pulled off the internet

332
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,551
like an hour ago.

333
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:20,623
of a sphere that uses both dithering and also banding.

334
00:18:21,003 --> 00:18:26,167
I think it's an interesting look, and you can kind of play around with the different

335
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:29,970
amounts of whether you want dither or band.

336
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:37,255
So what I ended up settling in on was actually more banding, just because...

337
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:42,742
The hard thing about dithering is that it looks kind of strange when you animate it.

338
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:48,864
I think there's a way to do it, but for me it was just such a pain, like, making sure every dot

339
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:54,505
lined up, like, each frame. So I ended up just going with a sort of banding,

340
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:58,126
sort of hard gradient with my final output. So...

341
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,535
And yeah, I did say that going frame by frame

342
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:06,056
and doing these cleanups is just as tedious as it sounds.

343
00:19:06,736 --> 00:19:10,637
But there are ways to kind of save time if you can.

344
00:19:11,437 --> 00:19:14,258
Like something that I did with my Diva animation

345
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:19,038
is I actually made a 360 degree turnaround, which

346
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,959
every frame of this is drawn.

347
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:26,280
But I can just take pieces of it and reapply it

348
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,240
into my animation.

349
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:27,300
So.

350
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:34,756
Here's an example of that, where she lands and turns around

351
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:35,937
and flies off.

352
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:37,938
I'm able to just use all those pieces

353
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:39,339
into the actual animation.

354
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,543
And it saved me more time in the end

355
00:19:43,563 --> 00:19:46,065
to just do that 360 degree.

356
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,446
And then also, if I want to do another one,

357
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:50,128
I have that library.

358
00:19:50,168 --> 00:19:54,211
And I can just kind of paste it on my frames wherever.

359
00:19:54,231 --> 00:19:54,271
So.

360
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,980
Another thing you can save time on is just straight-up cheating.

361
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:04,082
This actually happens really fast in my Mercy animation.

362
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:08,984
She actually spins her staff, and these frames are right next to each other.

363
00:20:09,985 --> 00:20:14,406
Like, the tip of the staff, it just magically teleports to the other side.

364
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:19,568
But it doesn't really matter, because it goes so fast, nobody's, like, ever caught it.

365
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:21,749
Until now.

366
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:22,810
So...

367
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:23,810
Oops.

368
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:28,492
But yes, as is 2D animation, you should definitely

369
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:31,593
take advantage of the liberties that you get with this.

370
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:34,394
Because this is something that I think

371
00:20:34,454 --> 00:20:35,954
is very hard to do with 3D.

372
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:39,435
Like with the amount of technical restraints

373
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:41,816
and rigging and stuff, there's a lot

374
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:43,857
that you can do with 2D animation.

375
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:45,117
So definitely don't forget that.

376
00:20:46,718 --> 00:20:49,759
And so we're back to this gun.

377
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:49,839
And.

378
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:58,248
Here's the one thing that I find that is really nice about the data loss that you experience

379
00:20:58,268 --> 00:21:05,153
with reusing assets and translating and rotating things.

380
00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:09,096
Like, you kind of have to go back and clean it up

381
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:09,676
a little bit.

382
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:12,758
But the resulting image, you kind of

383
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:15,179
have a new picture in and of itself.

384
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:19,622
So if you do want to have an arm that rotates or something,

385
00:21:20,182 --> 00:21:24,024
you don't have a bad bone animation

386
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:27,166
where it's just a vector sort of translating.

387
00:21:27,226 --> 00:21:29,367
Like, it actually feels like every frame

388
00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:31,649
is new because you did end up doing that cleanup.

389
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,590
So I guess that didn't really save you time.

390
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,721
So the next thing I want to show you

391
00:21:39,821 --> 00:21:44,703
is a more sort of advanced thing that I've done very

392
00:21:44,743 --> 00:21:46,784
occasionally, but I didn't have the patience

393
00:21:46,864 --> 00:21:50,745
to do this all the time, was sub-pixel movement.

394
00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:55,227
So this is basically when you're moving pixels,

395
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:59,348
you're super restricted with the amount of space

396
00:21:59,388 --> 00:22:00,509
that you can move an object.

397
00:22:01,373 --> 00:22:08,017
So something that, so say like you want to actually make your image move half a pixel.

398
00:22:08,297 --> 00:22:17,622
Well you technically can't move half a pixel. So what you can do is actually break up the pixels

399
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:24,545
that go up or translate within your animation and even have colors in between. Like you can see

400
00:22:25,286 --> 00:22:26,566
in the highlight there's

401
00:22:28,587 --> 00:22:31,027
like kind of a mid-tone between the highlight

402
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:32,548
and the actual color itself.

403
00:22:33,408 --> 00:22:38,049
So it does give the illusion of half pixel,

404
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,691
when in actuality it is not that.

405
00:22:42,771 --> 00:22:42,931
So.

406
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:49,881
So one thing I want to say is some good resources that really

407
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:52,342
helped me out with this process was,

408
00:22:52,362 --> 00:22:57,206
I don't know if many people are familiar with Miniboss'

409
00:22:57,706 --> 00:22:59,007
sort of pixel art tutorials.

410
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:02,730
But this guy that goes by the handle of Saint11,

411
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,773
he's been posting these really cool pixel art

412
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:08,174
tutorials every week.

413
00:23:09,015 --> 00:23:10,856
And they've been really, really, really

414
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:14,219
helpful for the things that I've been doing.

415
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:20,434
And also, if you just want more reference for sprites or sprite

416
00:23:20,474 --> 00:23:22,997
animation, you can also go on Fighters Generation.

417
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:28,761
That just has a huge collection of fighting game sprites

418
00:23:28,781 --> 00:23:30,123
from all different sorts of games.

419
00:23:31,404 --> 00:23:34,366
So those two websites have proven invaluable to me.

420
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:37,829
And other thoughts?

421
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:40,191
These animations do take a long time to make.

422
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:47,268
I've been getting better and better at it, so they've been taking me a month rather than

423
00:23:47,348 --> 00:23:48,409
like two to three of them.

424
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:56,399
But I think the main takeaway from this is that I want you to be able to do pixel art

425
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:59,503
based on whatever knowledge base you have.

426
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:02,706
I'm a traditional animator.

427
00:24:03,706 --> 00:24:04,987
That started off on Newgrounds.

428
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:08,769
So when I do my pixel art, it's always

429
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:09,790
in the realm of animation.

430
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,411
But if you're an illustrator and you

431
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,452
want to get into pixel art, you should try out

432
00:24:13,813 --> 00:24:17,035
pixel backgrounds or illustrations or whatnot.

433
00:24:18,475 --> 00:24:22,358
And another thing that was very valuable for me

434
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:24,379
was just to show people my animations.

435
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,401
Even if they weren't animators, they always

436
00:24:27,421 --> 00:24:28,682
had a really interesting opinion.

437
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:34,088
of how to improve my animation or what was not working with it.

438
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:40,512
And that has really helped me out in this whole endeavor.

439
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:44,274
So thank you very much.

440
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:46,075
That's the end of my talk.

441
00:24:46,095 --> 00:24:50,598
So...

442
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:51,619
Wow.

443
00:24:54,121 --> 00:24:55,401
I have six whole minutes left.

444
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:02,069
So I guess I can take questions, I guess, like if anybody has any questions to ask me

445
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:05,110
about my process or just anything related to this.

446
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:16,074
What frame rate do you prefer to work in?

447
00:25:18,395 --> 00:25:21,015
I prefer 30 frames a second.

448
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:25,830
That's just what I use in games.

449
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,831
I'm just really used to that frame rate

450
00:25:28,871 --> 00:25:31,431
that I've just stuck to, 30 frames a second.

451
00:25:32,172 --> 00:25:35,353
There have been cases where 30 frames just wasn't working.

452
00:25:36,093 --> 00:25:39,834
So I would just make the frames even faster.

453
00:25:39,894 --> 00:25:43,495
So I'd get a really weird number, like 38 frames a second.

454
00:25:44,035 --> 00:25:45,856
But the thing is, it's going on video,

455
00:25:45,896 --> 00:25:47,357
so it doesn't really matter as much.

456
00:25:48,317 --> 00:25:51,718
So yeah, I'm pretty fluid when it comes to frame rate.

457
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,801
Hello.

458
00:25:56,861 --> 00:25:57,101
Hello.

459
00:25:57,802 --> 00:26:00,163
You say you use banding to do shading.

460
00:26:00,324 --> 00:26:03,486
Do you typically standardize how many bands in your gradients

461
00:26:03,566 --> 00:26:04,026
to use?

462
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:06,028
On a larger model, would you use more bands?

463
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,072
My main thing is just not to go crazy on it to the point

464
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,453
where it's literally a gradient.

465
00:26:14,594 --> 00:26:16,135
At that point, it's like you're defeating

466
00:26:16,155 --> 00:26:17,396
the purpose of using pixel art.

467
00:26:18,457 --> 00:26:20,258
But usually, I have like.

468
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:25,457
one or two bands in the middle, that just kind of works for me.

469
00:26:25,477 --> 00:26:29,920
I think the Diva one, I only really used a highlight,

470
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,342
a mid-tone, and then a shadow.

471
00:26:32,563 --> 00:26:34,444
And for the most part, that works

472
00:26:34,684 --> 00:26:35,905
with most of my animations.

473
00:26:36,946 --> 00:26:37,226
Thank you.

474
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:37,947
Thank you.

475
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,470
How would you say your exploration in this way

476
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,313
informs your day-to-day, like, day job?

477
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:53,913
I actually started incorporating 2D into my pipeline for 3D.

478
00:26:54,933 --> 00:27:02,116
I will shoot reference, but then my reference isn't good, as you've seen.

479
00:27:02,856 --> 00:27:10,318
So I'll actually go into Flash and actually make a crappy stick figure animation to kind

480
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:15,180
of just give me an idea of the timing that I want.

481
00:27:16,395 --> 00:27:18,535
And from there, I'll look at both the reference

482
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:21,956
and that animation and try to bring that into 3D.

483
00:27:22,216 --> 00:27:26,197
So I guess that's how it's affected my day-to-day job,

484
00:27:26,257 --> 00:27:28,698
is that I actually do use traditional animation

485
00:27:28,738 --> 00:27:29,338
for my planning.

486
00:27:32,258 --> 00:27:35,319
The program that you use, it's called a Sprite,

487
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:35,979
or what is it again?

488
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:37,460
Hey, I don't know either.

489
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,621
It is pronounced, it's like a Sprite, I think.

490
00:27:43,974 --> 00:27:45,455
Let me go back to the slide.

491
00:27:45,475 --> 00:27:46,756
I can show you how it's...

492
00:27:46,776 --> 00:27:49,018
The question I have is, what did you use before that?

493
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:50,859
Because I'm just now hearing about that,

494
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:53,561
and I feel like Photoshop is pretty difficult,

495
00:27:54,021 --> 00:27:55,342
and that's all I've been using so far.

496
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:58,765
Yeah, the difficulty with Photoshop is that

497
00:27:59,425 --> 00:28:02,327
the layers and the timeline are very separate.

498
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,649
They're very separate entities.

499
00:28:07,274 --> 00:28:11,297
Aseprite is the way that its layers are,

500
00:28:12,018 --> 00:28:14,159
like, its timeline and its layers

501
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:15,660
are kind of on top of one another.

502
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,264
So it's a lot easier to kind of maintain and edit

503
00:28:20,304 --> 00:28:21,745
your timeline in Aseprite.

504
00:28:23,186 --> 00:28:23,466
So.

505
00:28:24,347 --> 00:28:26,909
And it limits your amounts of colors you can use too,

506
00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:27,309
it seems.

507
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:28,110
Yeah.

508
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,631
Yeah, you can actually go in and.

509
00:28:31,975 --> 00:28:34,797
restrict your palette count if you want to.

510
00:28:35,197 --> 00:28:36,858
And it even comes with pre-built ones.

511
00:28:36,938 --> 00:28:38,679
Like, you can actually go in and it has, like,

512
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:40,620
the original Game Boy.

513
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,361
Like, you can actually set your palette,

514
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:43,582
and then, oh, I'll just do that.

515
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:46,544
Yeah, it's a really handy program.

516
00:28:47,004 --> 00:28:47,824
Nice, I'll check it out.

517
00:28:48,365 --> 00:28:48,585
Thanks.

518
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:49,305
Mm-hmm.

519
00:28:53,548 --> 00:28:54,188
I think that's it.

520
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:54,248
So.

521
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:55,449
Thanks, everybody.

522
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,011
Thanks, everybody.

523
00:28:58,031 --> 00:28:58,371
Thanks, everybody.
