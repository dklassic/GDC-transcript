1
00:00:06,085 --> 00:00:12,408
Let's start. Wow, it's like an echo in here. I don't really have the voice for a big echo,

2
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:15,110
but you know, I'll try and be like Thor-like or something.

3
00:00:16,443 --> 00:00:20,747
Thanks for coming, everyone. I really appreciate you taking half an hour out of your super

4
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:28,774
busy GDC to come and hang out here. You probably know all the sort of housekeeping stuff already,

5
00:00:28,854 --> 00:00:35,780
but I think you need to, like, turn off your phones and get something scanned and write

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,985
some answers to emails later. So do those things, and everyone will love you, including

7
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:41,065
me.

8
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:52,110
So, hello, I'm Rex. I am a game maker. I've done a bunch of stuff in TV and animation as well,

9
00:00:52,891 --> 00:01:00,454
but it's mostly been in games. A little bit of background. I started out,

10
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:09,898
I started out as a sheep farmer, and I gradually raised a large flock of sheep. And then one day,

11
00:01:11,453 --> 00:01:11,993
I sold them.

12
00:01:13,554 --> 00:01:16,735
And I took the money and I bought my first computer.

13
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:18,456
And there it is.

14
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:20,777
Well, despite what you might actually think,

15
00:01:20,817 --> 00:01:22,137
that's not actually me.

16
00:01:23,838 --> 00:01:25,819
But you know, I'm flattered.

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,201
And it was an Amiga 500.

18
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:34,340
The best computer ever designed, unfortunately for my sheep.

19
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:38,762
And here's Andy Warhol using one to paint Debbie Harry.

20
00:01:39,482 --> 00:01:40,943
I kind of wanted to get in on this.

21
00:01:41,383 --> 00:01:43,804
I was so inspired by what was...

22
00:01:43,824 --> 00:01:46,725
the use of digital...

23
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:49,746
the digital device to create art.

24
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:52,047
It just seemed so much quicker and easier.

25
00:01:53,567 --> 00:02:01,750
So, I got myself an Amiga and I used this incredible technology to make some very bad games.

26
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:08,812
That's one there. I'm not showing you the main screen, you can only see the UI because it doesn't get better as you go up.

27
00:02:11,073 --> 00:02:15,575
And, you know, despite this image, I think I probably had some skills as an artist,

28
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:20,676
but ultimately I was just kind of a fanboy for the technology.

29
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:25,175
I didn't really have anything to say with it at the time.

30
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:30,321
So, like many people, I went off to art college, discovered life,

31
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:33,346
luckily forgot all about games for several years,

32
00:02:33,726 --> 00:02:35,288
and started to find a bit of a voice.

33
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:38,056
I studied graphic design,

34
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:40,838
although I was much more of an illustrator,

35
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:43,899
because I wanted to learn about the wider context

36
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:46,940
of how my artwork would and could be used.

37
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,121
And that's something that stayed with me

38
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:51,802
when I'm trying to choose an art style

39
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:53,523
with meaning behind it.

40
00:02:54,683 --> 00:02:56,264
And the other thing I learned was,

41
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:02,006
oh, twin screens.

42
00:03:02,446 --> 00:03:03,426
I'll go this way.

43
00:03:05,638 --> 00:03:09,901
Shit, right, sorry, you can go home now.

44
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:11,442
I'm not gonna tell you anything good.

45
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:15,425
It's kind of a harsh lesson,

46
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:18,968
but it was a really important one for me to learn,

47
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,591
that there will always be artists better than me

48
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:27,415
at drawing hands, better at drawing feet,

49
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,458
and particularly better artists at drawing horses.

50
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:39,969
But learning this really freed me up to make work that was less about the rendering skill

51
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:45,714
and more about finding the best way to convey a particular message or to create a certain emotion.

52
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:49,867
And the other thing I was learning at the same time

53
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:51,929
was like teaching myself the software Flash.

54
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,191
And I really love this software

55
00:03:55,212 --> 00:03:57,433
as you could quickly pull in all kinds of media,

56
00:03:58,074 --> 00:03:59,755
add audio, draw all over it,

57
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:01,777
and then start making it interactive.

58
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,119
And it was a very different process

59
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,240
from those early attempts of like making games

60
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,983
where I had to pre-plan everything.

61
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:13,166
Using Flash was far closer to my own creative process

62
00:04:13,226 --> 00:04:14,287
and much more like playing.

63
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:19,982
So I made little interactive experiments which became quite game-like

64
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:24,668
and that was kind of enough for me to accidentally be hired into the games industry.

65
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:28,449
initially at Lionhead Studios,

66
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,991
and then with a close bunch of friends

67
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:32,993
at their new company called Media Molecule,

68
00:04:33,713 --> 00:04:37,617
where I worked on defining the company's house style,

69
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:42,061
which I guess you could sum up as make it pink,

70
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:47,325
but also working on the look and atmosphere of the games,

71
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:50,628
as well as posing for really awkward photos.

72
00:04:52,828 --> 00:05:00,531
And together we made LittleBigPlanet, and my niche on that was mainly bringing in elements of pop culture and street art.

73
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:07,715
And much of this was to try and show that the game is constantly evolving and being added to.

74
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:14,538
And if we think of the game as a graffiti wall or a mix tape, that's saying that there's never a perfect conclusion.

75
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:21,281
It's just an ongoing process of creators inspiring each other to create the next stage.

76
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,781
which makes it more approachable.

77
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:26,002
Everyone is able to play their part

78
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:28,324
in a sort of never-ending process of creation.

79
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:33,307
And then after five years of making LittleBigPlanet,

80
00:05:33,988 --> 00:05:35,309
we wanted to do something different,

81
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:36,970
and I was given the opportunity

82
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,112
to creatively lead a team for the first time.

83
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:44,014
And that's when we made Tearaway and Tearaway Unfolded.

84
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:48,936
And this kind of built on what I'd learnt on Little Big Planet

85
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:52,841
of trying to take an abstract idea and make it tangible

86
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:55,264
through its art and its sound and its gameplay.

87
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:58,848
So this was going to be a handheld game

88
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:01,290
with lots of touch screen interactions.

89
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,212
And we wanted a world that would be very reactive

90
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:05,053
and tactile.

91
00:06:06,914 --> 00:06:09,476
So, you know, we took the approach

92
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,478
to build the entire world out of paper

93
00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:13,660
because that felt the most successful way

94
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,480
that we could do that.

95
00:06:15,882 --> 00:06:17,563
You know, and what was interesting about that

96
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:20,746
is that it especially allowed both our team

97
00:06:21,326 --> 00:06:25,229
and players themselves to successfully contribute artwork

98
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:25,810
to the game.

99
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:32,313
you know, the paper style, like, it unified whatever people made in it.

100
00:06:32,473 --> 00:06:35,175
So it always looked part of this papery world.

101
00:06:37,736 --> 00:06:42,999
And making Tearaway has been the biggest influence on what I'm actually here to talk about,

102
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:50,142
which is the game Nights and Bikes, which is what I'm working on at the moment.

103
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:51,763
So...

104
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:53,774
Let's move on.

105
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:57,415
Now, this particular project was dreamt up

106
00:06:57,735 --> 00:07:00,696
as a smaller scale collaboration

107
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:04,057
between me and my friend Mu, who's down there.

108
00:07:04,077 --> 00:07:05,137
Hi Mu.

109
00:07:06,998 --> 00:07:10,058
As a way of taking a little bit of time out,

110
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:11,739
really get hands on again.

111
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,740
I was worried that I hadn't really been drawing

112
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,220
and painting that much recently.

113
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:22,164
And I just wanted to get a little bit more input into my life, take a few more walks

114
00:07:22,604 --> 00:07:26,746
and get some more influences from outside of my bubble.

115
00:07:28,187 --> 00:07:30,749
Also meant that I could spend a bit more quality time with these two.

116
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:34,171
Oh, I miss them so much.

117
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:39,394
So we set up a little company called Foamsword.

118
00:07:39,414 --> 00:07:41,696
Contrast.

119
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,270
So that we could make this game called Nights on Bikes.

120
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:53,511
There it is.

121
00:07:54,671 --> 00:07:57,612
Now, on the surface, this game is inspired

122
00:07:57,752 --> 00:08:02,453
by coming of age movies, 1980s nostalgia.

123
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:05,054
Speed up, there we go.

124
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:06,775
And some classic video games.

125
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:11,213
I just have to call out this bike here,

126
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:13,335
that's called a Raleigh Vector.

127
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:15,156
And that came out like in the 80s

128
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:17,618
and I was probably, you know, pretty young.

129
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,181
And that bike has a built-in computer

130
00:08:20,221 --> 00:08:22,102
that talks to you while you cycle.

131
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,044
I mean, incredible.

132
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,130
Let's make a video game about that.

133
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:31,712
So all of these things, they're all cultural shortcuts,

134
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:32,032
really.

135
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:34,593
They're there to bring players on board,

136
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:36,794
which is very important because we

137
00:08:36,814 --> 00:08:38,275
were going to be crowdfunding the game.

138
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:40,516
So we needed people to have things

139
00:08:40,556 --> 00:08:44,037
that they could understand and welcome them into this game.

140
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:49,499
But really, a lot of that is just the fanboy bit.

141
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,619
What's going on under the surface of the game

142
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:54,680
to make it its own thing?

143
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,640
How can it really stand apart from its influences?

144
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,901
Well, firstly, it's influenced by our own childhoods

145
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:07,522
and experiences, and its setting is directly,

146
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,542
you probably shouldn't look too closely at that map,

147
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,923
there's really bad stuff on there.

148
00:09:13,782 --> 00:09:20,306
It's based on an exaggerated version of where I grew up in rural Cornwall, which is the

149
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:27,410
– oh, let's help you out, there we go – the pointy tip of the UK, which is where

150
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,412
I raised and sold my sheep to get that sweet computer.

151
00:09:32,714 --> 00:09:39,278
So it's actually a very rural area with little fishing villages all hanging on to

152
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:42,180
the rocks as the next storm blows through.

153
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:48,881
It's a very beautiful place, but it's also a place that a lot of people want to come and visit.

154
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:52,543
But it's economically one of the poorest areas in Europe,

155
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:58,026
which has a big impact on the look and the atmosphere and themes of the game.

156
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:04,749
And that sketch on the right is the very first page of my first sketchbook in the game.

157
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,372
And that's how it looks in game.

158
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:14,414
It's a 3D world made up of thousands of little paintings.

159
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:20,317
And they're all hand painted and then layered up to create a believable 1980s rural setting.

160
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:25,987
lots of caravan parks and fishing villages

161
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:29,552
and plenty of countryside to explore in between.

162
00:10:31,975 --> 00:10:34,638
The game itself has you playing as a couple of...

163
00:10:36,355 --> 00:10:38,357
a couple of tough little girls on their bikes,

164
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,480
and they're seeking adventures,

165
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:42,122
they wanna find treasure,

166
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,164
and they're just generally learning

167
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:45,606
about the adult world around them,

168
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:50,012
but all done with that just almost explosion

169
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:54,477
of creativity and infectious energy that kids have.

170
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:59,727
One thing to say is that although it's set in the 1980s,

171
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:03,510
it's a deliberate choice not to go like super 80s.

172
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:07,854
Because I think there's a lot of nostalgia culture

173
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:10,457
out there that kind of makes out that, you know,

174
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:13,920
when the clock struck 12 on the first day of 1980,

175
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,402
everyone got a DeLorean and like.

176
00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:20,624
changed into a neon t-shirt and went and looked at unicorns.

177
00:11:21,324 --> 00:11:23,145
It's a lot more nuanced than that.

178
00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:27,066
You have to have money to keep up with trends.

179
00:11:27,827 --> 00:11:32,049
And because it's set in an economically challenged area,

180
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:39,612
we wanted to make sure that the 80s influence was a lot more nuanced.

181
00:11:39,672 --> 00:11:43,833
And there was a reason that some characters will be more pop culture than others.

182
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,783
So how do we get started?

183
00:11:48,323 --> 00:11:51,468
Well, as I was saying, it's quite a personal project

184
00:11:52,229 --> 00:11:55,754
and the aim was to make a game that could be tinkered on

185
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:59,159
and iterated on as a very small collaboration

186
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:00,040
between me and Mu.

187
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:11,490
So it needed to be like generally easy to make the assets, you know, because there was a lot of them, you know, that I was going to have to paint and animate and assemble.

188
00:12:12,271 --> 00:12:24,501
And previously I'd had the luxury as well of working in custom engines that were created to like fully simulate a certain look, you know, to make a world out of paper or make all the craft materials of LittleBigPlanet.

189
00:12:25,302 --> 00:12:27,422
So, it didn't really have, you know,

190
00:12:27,602 --> 00:12:29,603
that would be a little bit crazy

191
00:12:29,663 --> 00:12:32,323
to try and do a new engine for a team of two.

192
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:34,224
Wasn't gonna move through that.

193
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:38,585
So, you know, we needed to use off-the-shelf tools,

194
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:42,785
so we used Unity, and needed to come up with an art style

195
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:46,786
that kind of I could just paint, paint final artwork,

196
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:50,867
and then just bring it into Unity as PNGs and start building.

197
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:59,255
Thematically, like I was saying, it was going to be built on pop culture touchstones such as the Goonies,

198
00:12:59,915 --> 00:13:04,801
but also, you know, wanting to make it its own thing with some autobiographical twists.

199
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:07,764
And this is the important one.

200
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:13,370
This kind of suggested that it would be a game about a fairly everyday world.

201
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:17,594
but one explored by kids with lots of energy, wild imaginations.

202
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,857
So it's a question of like, what's that world going to look like through their eyes?

203
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:26,440
And this really was the key to represent,

204
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:32,905
the visual style is there to represent how the kids in the game would try and depict it themselves.

205
00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:37,397
So as you play, you feel like you're seeing the world through their eyes,

206
00:13:37,657 --> 00:13:41,080
or at least with their imagination and energy having some effect on it.

207
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:44,965
So in other words, it's all a little bit fuzzy, a little bit scribbly.

208
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:48,160
It's all painted with two brushes.

209
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:51,482
We've got this softer one for natural elements,

210
00:13:52,362 --> 00:13:54,864
and then a harder edged one for highlights.

211
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,466
And sticking to these two brushes

212
00:13:57,526 --> 00:13:59,587
has been really important to the visual style of the game

213
00:14:00,027 --> 00:14:02,349
because it unifies everything.

214
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:04,170
It's kind of like the decision

215
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,932
to make the whole world of Tearaway out of paper.

216
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:10,614
It's a self-imposed limitation to tie everything together.

217
00:14:13,342 --> 00:14:17,103
Here's an exciting bit of live eyeball painting.

218
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:21,324
I mean, I could just leave that running if you like,

219
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,505
but you know, maybe I'll move on to some more slides.

220
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:27,826
There's a, here's use of the softer brush

221
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:29,447
for a little bit of shading.

222
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:35,048
And then the harder one for the double-edged chin,

223
00:14:35,348 --> 00:14:36,329
double-edged, double chin.

224
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:43,855
So in the early stages, many elements,

225
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:45,196
you know, the characters and whatnot,

226
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:46,836
were designed in vectors,

227
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:48,837
because it's much quicker and easier

228
00:14:48,897 --> 00:14:50,737
to get the bold shapes and silhouettes.

229
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,839
But then I'd repaint them in the two brushes

230
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:57,420
to unify the style and just make it less clean,

231
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,080
like, you know, make it more human.

232
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:02,442
And then there's a final version on the right.

233
00:15:03,022 --> 00:15:04,262
Just put the word final under,

234
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:06,063
final.final.final.final.psd.

235
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:12,128
And, you know, that's just been a little bit more refined

236
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:14,730
and had a little bit more detail added

237
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,352
and a little bit of animation.

238
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:25,369
So moving on to animation, you know, the key here was that everything needs to really convey this energy of childhood

239
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:28,430
and the way that kids are constantly shifting attention.

240
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:36,372
So wherever possible, I redraw everything three times to give it a stop-motion, line-boil look.

241
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:42,194
It really helps, you know, keeps everything moving on screen and hopefully excites your eyes

242
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:46,995
and really tries to suggest that there's no one particular way to look at any one thing.

243
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:50,470
So on the characters themselves,

244
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,071
I can't go quite as wild as I might like

245
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:55,152
due to the range of animations to create,

246
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:58,034
but I still try and use the stop motion technique

247
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:01,016
wherever possible, such as on Demelza's hair here.

248
00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:02,437
You know, you can see how it's sort of,

249
00:16:03,017 --> 00:16:05,358
it's trying to convey her inner wildness,

250
00:16:05,418 --> 00:16:06,919
you know, like all that sort of ideas

251
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,041
that are fizzing out of her head and, you know,

252
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:12,002
and it sort of beds her into this stormy,

253
00:16:12,062 --> 00:16:13,243
Cornish setting that they're in.

254
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:23,893
And the art style also means that we can add on elements where the kids, like their imagination is getting carried away and adding elements to the game.

255
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:29,579
So they're sort of seeing this wall and imagining it as a castle wall with arrows coming down.

256
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,701
This greasy old car crusher kind of takes on a new role as a dragon.

257
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:38,962
You know, still all painted with with one of those two brushes.

258
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,684
So it looks part of the overall style, but it's very clear that it's

259
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:46,565
it's something that they're projecting onto the the environment.

260
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:52,146
And a big influence on this stop motion look.

261
00:16:52,865 --> 00:16:56,647
was the work of Bob Godfrey, that's quite hard to say,

262
00:16:57,568 --> 00:16:58,989
the animator of Rhubarb and Custard.

263
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:02,991
And I think having lots of on-screen movement

264
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:04,832
is very important to the atmosphere of a game.

265
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:07,314
That movement really creates an energy

266
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:10,556
that translates to players.

267
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,758
It really sort of spurs them through the game,

268
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:14,659
becomes like a contagious energy

269
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:17,080
so that they'll run around and explore.

270
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:20,903
So that was the kind of a weird phrase to leave on screen.

271
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:29,498
But that was the animation without audio, but I think we should just hear it again with

272
00:17:29,538 --> 00:17:31,522
the audio, because that's kind of a big deal as well.

273
00:17:42,401 --> 00:17:43,942
Right, I'll just have to cut it off there.

274
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,144
But audio is a really big deal to me.

275
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:49,247
While I'm working, a lot of influences for me

276
00:17:49,307 --> 00:17:50,147
come from audio.

277
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:53,029
And it's great to investigate other visual styles

278
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:55,732
and techniques, but it can be overwhelming sometimes.

279
00:17:56,112 --> 00:17:58,173
So when I'm really knuckling down on a project,

280
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:01,296
you know, I'll often, I'll have the radio on

281
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:02,797
in the background, listening to that.

282
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:03,638
So I'll have, you know.

283
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:07,743
want to listen to people talking like being out in a you know working in a

284
00:18:07,783 --> 00:18:11,285
cafe or something so that you you hear that or create like custom

285
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:15,907
play music playlists so that they're influencing you while you're working on

286
00:18:15,947 --> 00:18:17,988
particular areas as one area.

287
00:18:20,117 --> 00:18:25,559
the harbour area of the game, this particular audio, Dylan Thomas's,

288
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:29,061
Under Milt Wood, is really, really important for me.

289
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:34,103
It is spring, moonless night in the small town, starless and bible black.

290
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:38,865
The cobbled streets silent and the hunched quarters and rabbits wood limping

291
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:40,666
invisible down to the slow black,

292
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:43,988
slow black, crow black,

293
00:18:44,988 --> 00:18:46,549
fishing boat bobbing sea.

294
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:54,523
The houses are blind as moles, though moles see fine tonight in the snouting velvet dingles,

295
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:59,905
or blind as Captain Cat, there in the muffled middle by the pump and the town clock,

296
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:03,807
the shops in mourning, the welfare hall in widow's weeds,

297
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:10,991
and all the people of the lulled and dumbfound town are sleeping now.

298
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:14,012
Right, let's stop there. So good though!

299
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:16,954
Like there's just so much stuff in there, I could just draw that forever.

300
00:19:18,136 --> 00:19:21,198
And so audio is a really big deal.

301
00:19:21,278 --> 00:19:23,420
And obviously, like, you know,

302
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,422
these other audio influences are all part of

303
00:19:27,882 --> 00:19:28,903
what influences the look,

304
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:30,584
along with the audio design

305
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,225
that's actually happening in the game.

306
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,567
And that's such an important relationship to have,

307
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,349
you know, a really good relationship

308
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:38,509
with your audio designer.

309
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,571
And, you know, having an old friend, Kenny Young,

310
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:46,034
on the project has just gives me so much to respond to

311
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:46,755
all of the time.

312
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:52,409
So, moving on, yes, so if you're making a game

313
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:55,090
that's like 2D, 3D, you have to have one of these GIFs.

314
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,551
It's the law, and this is our one.

315
00:19:59,112 --> 00:20:02,074
So, you know, that was just a little diversion

316
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:06,176
into how audio has inspired the overall atmosphere and tone.

317
00:20:06,896 --> 00:20:09,377
But how are the individual elements all created?

318
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:13,619
Well, a big influence on those was the art

319
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,201
of Alfred Wallace, who was a Cornish painter.

320
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:21,761
who had no formal training and often painted with boat paint on scraps of cardboard.

321
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:30,008
And because he was from the same geographical location as where the game is set,

322
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:31,790
there's a strong thematic link.

323
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:40,658
But looking at these compositions really made me more confident to play with the fakery of making 3D environment with 2D assets.

324
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:48,047
So, started off very conservative, you know, everything was very flat, as if I was like just going to texture it onto boxes,

325
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:52,012
rather than really going as wild as you can with like 2D artwork.

326
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:54,535
I started to subvert it more.

327
00:20:56,757 --> 00:21:00,662
And, you know, this started to get closer to the way that kids will draw.

328
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,032
trying to show all the interesting details

329
00:21:04,092 --> 00:21:05,133
which matter to them,

330
00:21:05,893 --> 00:21:07,995
even if like technically half of those details

331
00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:09,216
are actually on the other side,

332
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:10,898
you know, it's kind of, you're just trying,

333
00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:13,280
you're just too excited to like draw a thing,

334
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,561
so you just try and fit everything on.

335
00:21:15,702 --> 00:21:17,523
And this felt like a much more accurate way

336
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,605
of representing the little fishing villages

337
00:21:19,665 --> 00:21:21,006
and what have you in Knights and Bikes,

338
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,768
where the architecture is so individual.

339
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:27,672
There's a few more examples of assets.

340
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:33,776
And it really helps like, you know, painting all of these in the same two brushes all the way through the game.

341
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:43,249
You know, and it means that, you know, they've all got their own sort of angles and perspectives, but, you know,

342
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,553
painting them all in the same way has like really unified them.

343
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:56,085
But nobody's going to see assets like that in isolation, apart from all of you, just then.

344
00:21:56,125 --> 00:22:03,289
You might want to just add loads of cool details, but I find it so important to make all of these assets in situ.

345
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,533
Like this, there's a treasure chest in the level on the screen above, and then I'm painting it on the one below.

346
00:22:10,493 --> 00:22:12,354
And I just have to make sure that all the time

347
00:22:12,394 --> 00:22:14,234
I'm not trying to add too much detail

348
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:17,475
and look at the game as a screen, as a scene

349
00:22:17,555 --> 00:22:19,776
rather than as, you know, individual assets.

350
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:25,517
So I think if I was going to summarize this style,

351
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:29,438
I'd put it like this, that it's like an eight year old

352
00:22:29,678 --> 00:22:30,999
is telling me what to paint

353
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,659
and I'm struggling to keep up

354
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,080
with all their ideas and stories.

355
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,232
It's definitely something that I learned on Tearaway.

356
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:41,535
And although you might have chosen to use

357
00:22:41,575 --> 00:22:43,737
quite a naive, simple style,

358
00:22:44,137 --> 00:22:46,319
you still want it to look beautiful and aspirational.

359
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:47,921
You know, I still want to show off a little bit.

360
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:50,122
So it's more fun to try and achieve that

361
00:22:50,182 --> 00:22:52,004
by kind of trying to create this like,

362
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:55,607
this collaboration between the gaming characters

363
00:22:56,248 --> 00:22:59,490
and you trying to like, you know, depict their stories.

364
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:08,306
So once I've done my wide research, conducted some thoughtful investigations into the style,

365
00:23:08,946 --> 00:23:12,870
and strived to integrate it with the game's themes and overall ethos,

366
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:16,614
I like to cut every corner possible.

367
00:23:17,906 --> 00:23:20,147
Because all of that stuff takes a long time.

368
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:23,390
And it's terrible really, but you know,

369
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,752
I just need to stay true to the project's goals.

370
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,453
So I try not to worry too much

371
00:23:28,513 --> 00:23:30,614
about the details that don't matter.

372
00:23:31,455 --> 00:23:35,638
This tweet perfectly sums up my style of art production.

373
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:45,960
So sometimes just by deleting or hiding the worst thing,

374
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,581
you make everything else better.

375
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:50,143
You know, I'd like to do it all properly,

376
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:52,204
but you know, sometimes it's just not possible.

377
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:54,325
And it's great, you know, if you do this,

378
00:23:54,385 --> 00:23:55,946
that you can win back some time

379
00:23:56,106 --> 00:23:57,768
to really work on the characters

380
00:23:57,928 --> 00:24:00,129
or work on the atmosphere of the game.

381
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,832
And I try and do a bunch of things

382
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:06,193
to like keep myself inspired while I'm working.

383
00:24:06,954 --> 00:24:10,316
One of my main things is to go on plenty of walks.

384
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,730
Yes, there we go.

385
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:19,532
This, I mean, some walks are like very project focused.

386
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:23,854
This is going on hikes around the actual real life

387
00:24:23,914 --> 00:24:26,335
environments that Knights and Bikes is based on.

388
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,457
But the most useful walks, to be honest,

389
00:24:30,477 --> 00:24:32,859
are the ones where you're just taking a break

390
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:36,460
from your everyday, you know, when you're making a game,

391
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,982
you're just creating this carefully constructed,

392
00:24:40,142 --> 00:24:41,523
sealed world around you.

393
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:46,266
and I think it's really good to just get out and like hear the weird stuff people say and

394
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:53,032
you know just experience you know things that you haven't like carefully designed yourself

395
00:24:54,273 --> 00:24:59,517
and then you can jot all of those experiences down in sketchbooks and use them on future projects.

396
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:06,222
Also like to try and use all my sketchbooks to plan everything out,

397
00:25:07,443 --> 00:25:09,605
you know a lot of stuff that will never be in the game but it's

398
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:14,511
You know, it's just working out how it all fits together.

399
00:25:14,531 --> 00:25:17,776
And I find being slightly removed from the game

400
00:25:18,177 --> 00:25:21,102
like a really good way of just, you know,

401
00:25:21,142 --> 00:25:22,284
figuring it all out on paper.

402
00:25:23,097 --> 00:25:27,121
And a lot of this actually kind of puts you back in that mindset of when you're eight years old,

403
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:31,104
and you're just, you know, you used to like make up little maps on pieces of paper for

404
00:25:31,384 --> 00:25:35,447
places that don't exist, but now I have the power to make them exist. It's great.

405
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:45,876
And also a way that you can, I like to try and spend some of this time that I'm sort of

406
00:25:45,976 --> 00:25:49,859
claiming back by like painting, oh more eyeballs.

407
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,562
Like, trying not to use the flood fill tool.

408
00:25:56,003 --> 00:25:57,744
You know, that was the tool that like,

409
00:25:57,784 --> 00:26:00,026
you know, that was the thing that drew me to computers

410
00:26:00,046 --> 00:26:01,126
in the first place, because I was like,

411
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,027
oh my God, it's amazing.

412
00:26:02,047 --> 00:26:03,708
You just click a button and everything's colored in.

413
00:26:04,128 --> 00:26:05,569
But you've actually lost that time

414
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:06,509
where you're just sitting there

415
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:08,491
and like thinking about the next job you're gonna do.

416
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:11,793
So I try, there'll probably be a cut in a minute,

417
00:26:11,813 --> 00:26:14,614
you'll see me use the flood fill and I'll be like ashamed.

418
00:26:14,714 --> 00:26:15,775
But, you know, it's kind of,

419
00:26:15,835 --> 00:26:17,616
I think it's really good to just spend some time

420
00:26:17,656 --> 00:26:19,377
with the canvas, you know, just painting.

421
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:21,339
thinking about what you're working on.

422
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,184
So, that's kind of nearly done, which is just as well.

423
00:26:27,204 --> 00:26:29,186
Had to like speed up a bit, but we're getting there.

424
00:26:30,447 --> 00:26:32,429
This is kind of a, hopefully a bit of an insight

425
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:38,015
into how I'm trying to take nights and bikes

426
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,938
beyond the pop culture rapper in the artwork.

427
00:26:42,939 --> 00:26:44,779
So, we'll have a little summary.

428
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:46,679
It's quite a big summary, actually.

429
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,760
So, I should just read these, really.

430
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,001
So, visual influences can come from the right soundtrack,

431
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:54,481
voice, piece of literature,

432
00:26:55,301 --> 00:26:57,462
and it's good to reach outside your bubble

433
00:26:57,502 --> 00:26:58,502
for new influences.

434
00:26:59,162 --> 00:27:01,102
Going for walks is a good way to do that,

435
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:03,583
and you can control what you're,

436
00:27:03,643 --> 00:27:05,383
because you can't control what you're going to see.

437
00:27:08,482 --> 00:27:10,844
Type restrictions, like painting a game in two brushes,

438
00:27:11,164 --> 00:27:12,245
or making it all from paper,

439
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:14,367
can really unify everything

440
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:15,968
and give you more scope for wildness.

441
00:27:16,948 --> 00:27:19,630
Try and have a think about how your characters would depict

442
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:23,173
that what happens to you in the game to you, the creator,

443
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:24,694
so it's more of a collaboration.

444
00:27:26,635 --> 00:27:29,157
Be autobiographical where you can

445
00:27:29,217 --> 00:27:30,838
to add some extra flavor.

446
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:33,680
Create assets in situ,

447
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:36,462
so they match the style and level of detail.

448
00:27:37,483 --> 00:27:38,964
cut corners on the world building,

449
00:27:39,905 --> 00:27:42,307
so that you can spend it on atmosphere and characters,

450
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:44,068
emotions, uniqueness, et cetera.

451
00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:48,050
It will only look as good as the worst thing on screen,

452
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,952
so maybe you just delete that worst thing.

453
00:27:51,373 --> 00:27:53,814
And spend some time on those quiet, simple jobs,

454
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,056
because you'll be spending more time in the world,

455
00:27:56,096 --> 00:27:57,076
directly touching it,

456
00:27:57,377 --> 00:27:59,158
and considering what you'll be working on next.

457
00:28:01,595 --> 00:28:08,940
And I'm just going to finish up by showing you an actual poster for a Death Metal Festival

458
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,261
and all the bands and their logos.

459
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:16,624
And I've got to say, I love you Party Cannon!

460
00:28:19,586 --> 00:28:25,349
So I'm going to say to you all, be yourself, make interesting choices, enjoy what you do,

461
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:29,011
soak up the world and subvert what's being overused.

462
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,040
and be the party canon of this industry.

463
00:28:34,743 --> 00:28:35,524
Thank you very much.

464
00:28:46,377 --> 00:28:48,299
I don't know if there's any time for questions or not.

465
00:28:49,281 --> 00:28:49,441
Yes?

466
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:57,572
Wonderful. One of the things that I struggle with is getting your level of, like, cohesion,

467
00:28:58,132 --> 00:29:04,334
which I may never achieve before I die, but that's another thing. And I always encounter a point

468
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:08,835
where I'm drawing inspiration from a whole bunch of different sources, but the style that I've

469
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:13,216
built is sort of, like, filled with internal contradictions, and I don't know how to quite

470
00:29:13,356 --> 00:29:19,298
squeeze hard enough to get all the impurities out. I'm wondering if you can provide any insight about

471
00:29:19,478 --> 00:29:20,118
how to do that.

472
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:24,220
Sure, how to, I mean, because I come,

473
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,542
a lot of my background is making videos.

474
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:32,258
I used to make all the trailers for little big planet games and what have you.

475
00:29:32,298 --> 00:29:40,325
And I've always found like making videos or ways of re-presenting my work or the work of my team

476
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:45,309
back to myself like really useful because you just, you see it slightly differently.

477
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:52,515
So it's like, you know, you make a little shizzle reel for your project, you know,

478
00:29:52,556 --> 00:29:55,878
so that you're just like, you know, you really distill it down into its most...

479
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,423
well, into its best points, really.

480
00:30:01,004 --> 00:30:02,926
And I find that a really good way to,

481
00:30:03,286 --> 00:30:05,408
it might just show you where the holes are,

482
00:30:05,468 --> 00:30:08,291
but also it's a good way of pushing it

483
00:30:09,112 --> 00:30:10,133
in a new direction.

484
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:11,595
That's wonderful, thank you.

485
00:30:11,715 --> 00:30:12,055
Thank you.

486
00:30:14,198 --> 00:30:14,258
Hi.

487
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,721
Hi there, thank you for the talk.

488
00:30:16,822 --> 00:30:18,683
I am an instructor over at Purdue University

489
00:30:18,723 --> 00:30:19,863
with our game dev program.

490
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:22,585
And every semester when projects come around,

491
00:30:22,665 --> 00:30:25,907
I'm kind of surprised by how many students won't take up

492
00:30:25,947 --> 00:30:28,348
a 2D project unless it's like pixel art.

493
00:30:29,749 --> 00:30:33,431
And I'm assuming it's because they think that hand-drawn

494
00:30:33,471 --> 00:30:36,613
animation or that kind of digital painting

495
00:30:36,853 --> 00:30:40,115
is really time consuming and potentially a tripping

496
00:30:40,155 --> 00:30:41,055
point for the project.

497
00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:48,019
they have 10 weeks, do you think it would be viable for them to get their foot in the door

498
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:54,603
with the art style and create at least a decent vertical slice of a 2D project like this or would

499
00:30:54,623 --> 00:30:58,025
it be too cramped for them or would they get overloaded with it?

500
00:30:58,765 --> 00:31:06,387
Yeah, so I think it's totally possible to do a 2D project in a short amount of time.

501
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:13,369
I think what can help is to maybe take some influences from short films.

502
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,830
There's some really interesting stuff where I'm always inspired when I see how...

503
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:21,232
how simple and focused some short films are,

504
00:31:21,272 --> 00:31:24,895
where it might be just a character and an object on screen.

505
00:31:25,555 --> 00:31:29,137
And they haven't, I think sometimes when we take things

506
00:31:29,878 --> 00:31:32,340
into the interactive world, we feel that we have to put,

507
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,421
like, you know, everything has to be an object.

508
00:31:35,402 --> 00:31:37,203
But as soon as you start adding a few objects,

509
00:31:37,223 --> 00:31:38,884
then you have to add more and more and more.

510
00:31:39,204 --> 00:31:41,005
And it's kind of interesting to just, you know.

511
00:31:41,886 --> 00:31:46,129
make a game about a chicken and a worm and the worm just keeps popping up and going down and

512
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:53,014
you know that's all you need. So I think just being very focused on the actual

513
00:31:54,475 --> 00:31:59,138
setup of the game so that all of the assets can be like really

514
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:05,422
worked up and be the best that they can be. Thank you so much. I'll pass it on.

515
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:08,204
Cool. All done?

516
00:32:11,213 --> 00:32:13,703
OK, well, thanks everyone for coming.

517
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,487
Have a great GDC.

518
00:32:14,507 --> 00:32:14,788
Cheers.
