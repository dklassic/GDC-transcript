Hi, my name is Marnas and I'm the AI programmer of Stellaris.

2
00:00:07,824 --> 00:00:12,472
Some of the biggest challenges with the AI in Stellaris is that we have to be able to

3
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:15,317
handle a lot of input data with a lot of dependencies.

4
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:23,428
We also have to create NPCs with a lot of diversity so that it feels like you're playing against different humans.

5
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:32,993
So in this talk I will tell you all about how to make your AI moddable, scriptable, how you can expose it to your designers,

6
00:00:33,553 --> 00:00:41,376
how you can easily change the content and rebalance the game without using a lot of support from programmers.

7
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:49,093
and how you can also keep your programmers sane by not having so much stuff being loaded.

8
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:51,800
Be there or suffer the consequences.
