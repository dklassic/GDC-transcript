1
00:00:03,474 --> 00:00:03,794
Thank you.

2
00:00:05,776 --> 00:00:06,757
Yeah, so I'm Francois.

3
00:00:06,838 --> 00:00:09,620
So welcome, thank you for attending this.

4
00:00:10,421 --> 00:00:13,524
Just a disclaimer, so I'm heavily jet lagged

5
00:00:13,865 --> 00:00:15,807
and heavily caffeinated.

6
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:19,230
So if I say something weird or very French,

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,092
just tell me and I will try to correct that.

8
00:00:21,652 --> 00:00:28,959
Okay, so Rings was made by myself and a team,

9
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,003
very talented team, so Mieko Murakami did the art,

10
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:35,125
the very specific art of Rings,

11
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:39,549
and we had an exceptional music team

12
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:42,291
with Disasterpeace, Matteo Dugo,

13
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:44,874
and Eric von Amorongen,

14
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:47,836
who did a great work on the SFX notably.

15
00:00:48,017 --> 00:00:51,441
and I did the writing and the game dev, if you want.

16
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:54,244
So I'm gonna talk about ranks.

17
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:56,907
Ranks is a swipe your own adventure.

18
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:01,701
It can be described as a mix of Tinder and Game of Thrones,

19
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,583
and it's a relatively accurate way to describe the game.

20
00:01:05,964 --> 00:01:08,645
You play a dynasty of king taking binary decisions,

21
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:10,186
so yes or no by swiping.

22
00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:12,187
And you have a double objective,

23
00:01:12,227 --> 00:01:13,928
which is to rule as long as possible,

24
00:01:14,548 --> 00:01:19,451
and to discover the secrets of your dynasty.

25
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:22,933
And that's the long game that you play

26
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:24,134
over centuries generally.

27
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:26,215
It's been quite successful.

28
00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:29,857
So what am I gonna talk about today?

29
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:36,622
I don't know that yet, so it will be a bit dynamic, hope.

30
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:39,563
What I know for sure, it's what this talk will not be about.

31
00:01:39,663 --> 00:01:42,285
So this talk is not about a list of success,

32
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:46,128
of things you have to do to make a successful indie games,

33
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:48,769
as it's not a pipe either.

34
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:57,192
I think a success is the result of a very dynamic path.

35
00:01:58,152 --> 00:02:02,533
And we made good choices, but we had also a lot of luck

36
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:04,494
and probably some bias.

37
00:02:04,594 --> 00:02:07,074
So I really want you to be careful

38
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,714
about what I'm gonna say today.

39
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,415
And I will need you, the audience,

40
00:02:11,755 --> 00:02:14,156
to take some distance with what I'm gonna say.

41
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:16,016
So use your critical thinking,

42
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:18,717
try to extract the interesting matter

43
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:20,317
in what I'm gonna say today.

44
00:02:22,198 --> 00:02:28,661
The useful information is something that's specific

45
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:32,623
to your own use and practice, but I don't know.

46
00:02:32,763 --> 00:02:35,924
So that's an important point I wanted to make,

47
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:39,266
and I will start by an example.

48
00:02:39,346 --> 00:02:41,446
So be careful, this is very treacherous.

49
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:44,888
For me, laziness is my goal in life.

50
00:02:45,488 --> 00:02:48,009
So just like in this drawing from Valotto,

51
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,113
I dream of myself naked on a bed

52
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:54,415
with scratching a cat, if you want.

53
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,539
Because game development is a very painful enterprise.

54
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,942
You know that, all of you.

55
00:03:01,262 --> 00:03:04,906
Where you work like hell with a very, very uncertain success.

56
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:08,629
It's not really sane nor sustainable to make games,

57
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,811
let's be honest about that.

58
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:15,094
What I mean by that is not that I am lazy, of course,

59
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:19,495
but my goal is to sort of search that

60
00:03:21,396 --> 00:03:25,658
optimization of all my means and my design

61
00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:31,500
to sort of go towards this goal of being lazy.

62
00:03:33,642 --> 00:03:36,362
I'm not saying I'm lazy, we're all professionals

63
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:39,483
who spent a lot of hours on our bloody bugs

64
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:45,784
and the two pixel animation that needs to be perfect.

65
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:48,205
And I'm just like you, I do that.

66
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:53,266
But I try as much as possible to make the most

67
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:56,047
of the time I spent on game making.

68
00:03:56,447 --> 00:04:03,388
And instead of, I always try to use that in a useful way.

69
00:04:03,548 --> 00:04:03,616
you

70
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:08,544
I think being the most efficient sloth possible

71
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:12,365
is a very interesting drive in game making

72
00:04:12,405 --> 00:04:16,467
because it's where you will find new mechanics.

73
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:19,928
You will optimize your design choices.

74
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:22,789
And optimization is not just something

75
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,030
that's related to game engine and code.

76
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,470
Optimization is also about practice

77
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:33,032
and about the way you make the game yourself as a designer.

78
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:38,170
So I will start this talk about Reigns,

79
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:40,912
around Reigns Inception, the scribbling of Reigns,

80
00:04:41,352 --> 00:04:44,473
from the first sketch we made with Mieko, the artist.

81
00:04:45,614 --> 00:04:48,735
So we talked about this idea of making a game

82
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:51,016
around the same mechanic as Tinder,

83
00:04:51,136 --> 00:04:53,357
and the main elements of the game

84
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,178
were already present from the start,

85
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:57,059
so that's the first visual of Reigns.

86
00:04:57,859 --> 00:05:00,760
You play a king managing a kingdom, so you have advisor.

87
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,881
They are coming and talking to you about the kingdom

88
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:04,702
that you never see.

89
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:06,162
You never see the cathedral.

90
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:08,143
You always see just the advisor,

91
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,844
and this creates a gap that we will see is interesting.

92
00:05:10,864 --> 00:05:13,405
There are only two answers, yes or no,

93
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:16,406
but each one has a profound impact on the kingdom

94
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:19,508
that you see on the data at the bottom of the screen.

95
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:22,950
And that's it. And we had this from the start really.

96
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,892
It's like two weeks after starting the game.

97
00:05:26,213 --> 00:05:29,876
This was heavily inspired by L'Edoleon from Divine

98
00:05:31,117 --> 00:05:31,797
for the visuals.

99
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:33,579
And from...

100
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,622
by Asher also, Royals,

101
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:40,044
which was a very important inspiration.

102
00:05:40,144 --> 00:05:43,887
You will see a lot of small mechanics that we used in Reigns

103
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:47,210
like a one-year turn and stuff like that.

104
00:05:49,778 --> 00:05:53,179
So to give a bit of perspective to this first sketch,

105
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:56,220
I just compare it to the final game,

106
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,601
like one week after the release.

107
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:03,123
It's mostly the same, basically the same layout,

108
00:06:03,223 --> 00:06:06,064
and as I told you, I always aim to be lazy,

109
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:08,225
so I can't just scratch everything.

110
00:06:09,686 --> 00:06:12,508
But there are two interesting changes

111
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:13,809
that I want to talk about.

112
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:16,631
First, you see the data on the top of the screen

113
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:19,073
and not the bottom, like at the start.

114
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:20,934
So that's the sort of dumb test

115
00:06:20,954 --> 00:06:22,775
you have to do very early in development.

116
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:29,060
So as the game was supposed to be played mostly on mobile,

117
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,161
when your player play on mobile,

118
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:33,443
generally he has the thumb.

119
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:37,266
if you want to swipe, the thumb is on the bottom of the screen.

120
00:06:37,346 --> 00:06:40,749
So you never see the impact of the swipe

121
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:43,691
if you put your data at the bottom of the screen.

122
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:45,052
So that's a dumb test.

123
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,733
You have to do that very early,

124
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:51,237
just not to push that sort of bad idea too far.

125
00:06:53,058 --> 00:06:56,742
The other point on this is that we scratched the numbers,

126
00:06:57,222 --> 00:06:58,323
as you probably noticed.

127
00:06:58,343 --> 00:07:02,006
So that was a difficult design decision

128
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:04,668
that occurred very late in the development.

129
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,891
For a very simple reason,

130
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:09,653
when you playtest that sort of thing.

131
00:07:10,173 --> 00:07:12,534
the player will always prefer the first version

132
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:17,135
because it's easier for them to optimize their decision

133
00:07:17,215 --> 00:07:18,576
if they see the impact.

134
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:23,397
But we decided against this because we noticed that

135
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:26,658
very quickly the players

136
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:29,141
stopped reading the text.

137
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:33,326
And they were just optimizing their system, if you want.

138
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:35,228
And that's not what we wanted.

139
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:39,874
We wanted to have a focus on the text,

140
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:41,356
as we will see just later.

141
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:43,418
Just after that, on writing rings.

142
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,862
When we first playtested the game,

143
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:51,065
I quickly noticed that players wanted to go beyond

144
00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:53,066
the management side of the game,

145
00:07:53,146 --> 00:07:56,549
which was the very basic version we had.

146
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,591
They naturally started to create links between cards

147
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:02,834
that I didn't in any way link together,

148
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:08,118
like building a cathedral and fight a plague outbreak.

149
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,799
So they were creating their own stories within the game.

150
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:18,000
So we decided to support that and encourage

151
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:20,261
and build basically the game on that.

152
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:22,441
So that's the writing, it has three points.

153
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:24,542
I will start by evocative writing,

154
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:26,582
which is very useful tool,

155
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:29,443
where we don't use that much in games,

156
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:30,863
and that's a shame I think.

157
00:08:32,944 --> 00:08:36,327
If you see this picture, it's a still life, it's a bit boring.

158
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:39,310
It's called Breakfast Table with Blackberry Pie.

159
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:46,277
But if you look a bit more closely and you think of this painting as a scene in a game,

160
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:49,940
it's actually very entertaining and very thrilling.

161
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,347
glass broken on the left, is it the result of a fight

162
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:57,909
or does it contain poison?

163
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,712
Why are things left out like that?

164
00:09:00,752 --> 00:09:02,734
There's a cane in the middle, you see,

165
00:09:03,054 --> 00:09:04,836
and it hides something, maybe it's a weapon.

166
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:07,279
And the thing on the right, is it a clock?

167
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:10,242
Maybe it is a time travel device.

168
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:12,464
And the key, what does the key open?

169
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:16,586
interesting things that happen by evocation.

170
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:19,647
And I use that a lot in Reigns.

171
00:09:19,747 --> 00:09:21,828
If you take this card, for example,

172
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:25,829
you got the unknown body, you got the hands missing,

173
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:28,350
you got the garrison and the dungeon.

174
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,911
So all this creates some sort of structure to the whole game

175
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:36,852
that we really heavily worked,

176
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:42,234
that we used a lot because this evocates

177
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,121
the kingdom that's behind the game.

178
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:50,133
And that was very important to really build on this.

179
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,491
about comedy and rhythm.

180
00:09:54,932 --> 00:09:58,054
We quickly discovered that there was a very strong

181
00:09:58,134 --> 00:10:02,256
comical gap between the decision you take

182
00:10:02,457 --> 00:10:05,538
that impact your kingdom, you send people to the death,

183
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:08,200
you deal with earthquakes, you deal with a lot

184
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,462
of easy stuff actually, and the way you have to deal

185
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:14,804
with this by swiping, which is like the most casual way

186
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:16,584
of dealing with a situation if you want.

187
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:19,486
And that creates a gap that's very comical.

188
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:22,787
And only that, only creating very serious cards,

189
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:24,968
was actually very funny for the player.

190
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:28,490
And player were like, well, how do I do that?

191
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,452
And the fact that the only options were swiping

192
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:35,313
makes it very funny.

193
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:37,995
And we basically just built on this.

194
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,056
hiding more and more weird card,

195
00:10:40,116 --> 00:10:43,720
more and more with unfathomable consequences

196
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,643
that generally bring you to your death very quickly.

197
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:52,988
As some sort of illustration of a very casual power

198
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:55,311
that just deal with binary decisions,

199
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:58,734
is bad and can quickly become sore.

200
00:10:59,314 --> 00:11:03,058
So, also an important thing for the writing of this

201
00:11:03,518 --> 00:11:04,539
was the rhythm.

202
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,481
The rhythm in the game is very important

203
00:11:06,902 --> 00:11:11,266
and it took me some time to learn to do that rhythm.

204
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:14,389
The pace of the game is very quick

205
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:18,153
and you have to go from tac-tac-tac and boom you die.

206
00:11:20,635 --> 00:11:23,717
I had to keep in everything I wrote for the games

207
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:25,999
this sort of very strong rhythm

208
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,841
that Jenny finished with these dafts

209
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:31,262
that are like a clash that just

210
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:34,805
breaks you in your pace.

211
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:41,890
So making that sort of thing was difficult for me.

212
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,582
to find the right tone for the game.

213
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:48,287
I had to train myself to write games cards.

214
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:50,470
There's no easy way to do that.

215
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,192
So I wrote 770 cards in the game.

216
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,754
And it's really only after the first.

217
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,501
200 cards but I had the tone, I had the way to play

218
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:07,662
with my mechanics if you want, and how to define

219
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:09,443
the sentences so they make sense.

220
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:13,644
I studied French literature and we like to make

221
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:17,045
long sentences, so it was very painful for me to do that.

222
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:20,566
So probabilistic driven narratives,

223
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,206
so that's also very painful, I'm sorry about that.

224
00:12:24,707 --> 00:12:28,148
So, as I told you, players started to create

225
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:30,328
their own narratives within the game.

226
00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:32,329
So we decided to encourage that,

227
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:38,010
and that was difficult because we also needed

228
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,150
to keep the flow of the game.

229
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:43,871
The flow of the game is very important in ranks.

230
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:47,372
You really have to be able to play hundreds of cards

231
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:49,472
in the sessions of 20 minutes, for example,

232
00:12:49,753 --> 00:12:51,973
which is generally the time you spend on the game.

233
00:12:52,553 --> 00:12:52,633
And...

234
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:56,555
That was basically creating a narrative

235
00:12:56,615 --> 00:12:59,736
that's basically infinite because you can loop

236
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:01,397
and loop and loop, like on Tinder,

237
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:03,618
you can loop and loop as long as you want.

238
00:13:03,978 --> 00:13:07,660
So to do that, I created a system

239
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,241
that I call Probabilistic Driven Narrative

240
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:12,262
because it's a bit pedantic and I like it.

241
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:16,304
So I couldn't do branching path narrative,

242
00:13:16,384 --> 00:13:18,005
especially as I am to be lazy.

243
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:22,267
It's just crazy, you have four draws here,

244
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:23,007
imagine.

245
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,543
or I would deal with hundreds of cards, it's not possible.

246
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:29,345
And it creates a lot of garbage.

247
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:33,028
So instead I created this probabilistic driven narrative.

248
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,835
It's a relatively simple idea based on basic probability.

249
00:13:41,896 --> 00:13:45,060
and that are actually very useful tools

250
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,283
that I will try to explain here.

251
00:13:48,343 --> 00:13:52,287
So basically, I check the state of the kingdom,

252
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:56,372
which is made of different variables that I collect, okay?

253
00:13:57,273 --> 00:14:00,656
And against that state, I select all the cards

254
00:14:00,776 --> 00:14:01,818
that fit in that state.

255
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:06,321
And I put them in this bag, like a bag of cards if you want,

256
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:09,343
that adapts to the number of cards that are in the bag.

257
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:12,184
And I select one by randomly.

258
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:17,167
The fact that the cards have different volume in the bag

259
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:23,091
makes that just enables to generate

260
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,493
different sort of narratives that will adapt

261
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:28,334
to the state of the kingdom.

262
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:34,797
It's a very simple system that creates narratives

263
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:36,498
that could be purely random,

264
00:14:36,818 --> 00:14:40,379
like in draw four at the bottom here.

265
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:43,780
I selected in that state,

266
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:48,042
cards that are relatively the same weight.

267
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:52,163
So the card that's selected is random.

268
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:53,945
purely or randomly selected.

269
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:59,089
I can also color that random selection

270
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:03,673
by adding cards that have a bigger volume.

271
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:09,918
Generally I do that when it's around different thematic,

272
00:15:10,038 --> 00:15:11,920
like for example the war of

273
00:15:16,384 --> 00:15:17,184
the spice trade.

274
00:15:17,604 --> 00:15:20,345
So the cards that are related to the spice trade

275
00:15:20,825 --> 00:15:23,426
will be fewer but bigger,

276
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:28,147
so they have a better chance to be selected by the system.

277
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:31,368
Within a system that stays random,

278
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:34,049
so I still have variety in what's happening.

279
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:39,551
And also I can use the kingdom state in a restrictive way.

280
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:45,817
So around very small or narrow narratives, even linear narratives, like one card after the other.

281
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:50,022
And that's what you have in DrawFree and I will show example of that.

282
00:15:50,522 --> 00:15:54,486
And basically that's the system that structures everything that's happening in Reigns.

283
00:15:55,895 --> 00:16:01,758
And as players never know if a card is the direct consequence of a previous choice

284
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:07,382
or a more random selection by the engine, everything becomes meaningful.

285
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:11,324
So every link between the cards actually makes sense for the player

286
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:17,948
because they don't really know if what they're deciding has an impact on the next card selected.

287
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,873
Okay, so this is the, I told you it was painful,

288
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:27,296
so this is the, I am writing a range.

289
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:31,480
Basically, I'm writing the card in a spreadsheet.

290
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,742
Sorry about that, it's a bit of a.

291
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:36,224
And I pass that in Unity.

292
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:39,089
Each line in this spreadsheet is a card,

293
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:40,631
and it works like that.

294
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:43,635
So you got the question and the advisor,

295
00:16:43,735 --> 00:16:49,123
which is the guy who bears the news, if you want.

296
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:54,720
After that, I got the lock turn,

297
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,364
which is the number of turns a card will be locked

298
00:16:57,804 --> 00:17:00,588
until it's able to be played again

299
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:02,230
in the probabilistic system.

300
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:05,375
And the weight of the card,

301
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:07,398
which is the volume of the card in the bag, if you want.

302
00:17:09,222 --> 00:17:18,171
After that, I got the conditions, which are basically I check if the card fits in different

303
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:21,094
kingdom states by this system of conditions.

304
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:24,277
And after that, I got the answers, yes.

305
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:26,558
So that's the answer, yes.

306
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:29,359
So both on the values of the kingdom,

307
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,120
the different four values that you see at the top,

308
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,681
and on the, more generally, on the kingdom state.

309
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:40,502
And everything, all this affects the kingdom state

310
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,863
that evolves basically at every card that you select.

311
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,665
And I have the same for the no answer.

312
00:17:46,805 --> 00:17:50,708
Okay, so that was writing range.

313
00:17:50,748 --> 00:17:53,629
That was very, the structure and the tools I developed

314
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,431
at the start, and don't make any difference

315
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:59,754
between the code, which is basically

316
00:17:59,794 --> 00:18:00,894
what you have behind the engine,

317
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:03,156
and the writing, because all that process

318
00:18:03,236 --> 00:18:06,578
was made basically together, and I really switched

319
00:18:06,698 --> 00:18:08,760
from the code to the writing quickly.

320
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:15,144
So these three things I just saw in writing,

321
00:18:16,806 --> 00:18:20,468
enabled us to make the prototype with round-root cards,

322
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:23,951
which is the thing we showed to Devolver.

323
00:18:24,431 --> 00:18:28,154
So now the main part was to actually write the whole game.

324
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:32,919
I call that breaking rings because I really think

325
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,323
it was more about creatively breaking things

326
00:18:36,363 --> 00:18:38,986
than it was about seriously writing cards.

327
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:44,011
And I have this sort of perverse urge

328
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:47,936
to break and hack my own systems, if you want.

329
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:52,320
Because I think it's important to surprise the player

330
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:59,827
and the fact that in Reigns you can die but you carry on with the next king in the dynasty and so on and so forth

331
00:19:00,227 --> 00:19:05,352
sort of limited the frustration that it can create, although it's quite frustrating sometimes.

332
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:11,499
The party, so the party, it's one of the thing

333
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,062
I'm the most proud of in Reigns.

334
00:19:13,582 --> 00:19:16,066
It's that we did the impossible, the unthinkable.

335
00:19:16,106 --> 00:19:18,369
You can die of having too much stuff in Reigns.

336
00:19:19,272 --> 00:19:20,013
including money.

337
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,634
It generally happens like this,

338
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:26,537
so you maximize your money,

339
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:27,998
and you throw a party,

340
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:30,419
and then you die choking.

341
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,200
And it happens every single time.

342
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:37,083
So, I'm serious, I received eight mail about that,

343
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:40,786
because you suppose, you expect as a player,

344
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,167
as a normal person actually,

345
00:19:42,187 --> 00:19:44,868
to be able to just scoffer stuff without boundaries,

346
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:45,649
and I think,

347
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,051
On the contrary, the notion of power

348
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:51,452
is something that needs to be balanced,

349
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:53,714
and that doesn't make sense if it's not balanced.

350
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,017
So yeah, I'm very proud of this.

351
00:19:59,077 --> 00:20:01,638
Even if it was a bit cheesy to die every time

352
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:05,360
because of the party, but this is the sort of thing

353
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,703
that make the message of the game went through.

354
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:10,763
Okay, so the dungeons.

355
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:18,018
managed to squeeze a rudimentary procedural dungeon crawler

356
00:20:18,098 --> 00:20:21,740
in Rains, which is very inspired by Land of Lords.

357
00:20:22,241 --> 00:20:25,083
So, there's the same system as everything,

358
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:30,667
except you don't have a visor, but you have a dungeon,

359
00:20:31,027 --> 00:20:33,289
and you go left or right, and things happen,

360
00:20:33,329 --> 00:20:34,250
so I won't spoil you.

361
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:37,592
And that's interesting because we use

362
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,294
the same probabilistic system as everything else.

363
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:45,299
But instead of having the system on the whole set of cards,

364
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:49,523
I just narrow it to a subsystem, a subset of cards,

365
00:20:49,943 --> 00:20:53,847
which are the cards of the dungeon.

366
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,190
So basically I do like this.

367
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,293
So I open on the consequences of the card

368
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,255
that starts the dungeon.

369
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:04,117
I open dungeon one, okay.

370
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,343
And after that, it will collect, the system will collect

371
00:21:08,423 --> 00:21:12,026
all the cards that share that name and play the probabilistic

372
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:14,789
system only among them, okay?

373
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:18,092
And that's how I randomize my dungeon.

374
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:21,975
And after that, I can loop in the dungeon by just

375
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:24,618
recording the same subset of cards.

376
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,599
I use this system.

377
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:36,188
a lot, notably in the Red Dwarf,

378
00:21:36,448 --> 00:21:37,829
which is like a game in the game,

379
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:42,615
and the Duel on the right.

380
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:56,969
So, both have a very light layer of code on top of the general system, but I tend to keep

381
00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:58,410
everything in the spreadsheet.

382
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:03,912
So all the things that you read here are in the spreadsheet and not in something else.

383
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:06,134
So, Vdevil.

384
00:22:08,937 --> 00:22:10,957
We noticed something very troubling about Tinder.

385
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:15,079
It's like, it's a hell of a design, but quite literally so.

386
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:18,240
I mean that, like Tantalus, you're a bit stuck

387
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,781
in some sort of loop that's both numbing,

388
00:22:22,581 --> 00:22:23,601
compelling, and less.

389
00:22:25,122 --> 00:22:27,503
So you see the apple, you want to reach for it,

390
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:29,604
and you can't, so you come back,

391
00:22:29,664 --> 00:22:32,666
but you try again and you can't, and so on and so forth.

392
00:22:32,826 --> 00:22:35,568
If you replace that with profile on Tinder,

393
00:22:35,608 --> 00:22:36,649
it's a bit the same mechanic.

394
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:43,433
So this is how the idea very concretely entered,

395
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:45,474
the idea of the deviant entered the game.

396
00:22:46,295 --> 00:22:49,878
Basically, the devil traps you in this endless loop of kings

397
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:54,543
and you have to trick him to escape and solve the game.

398
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:02,587
structure, the Devil backstory was very important

399
00:23:02,607 --> 00:23:05,649
to structure the whole game, give an end goal to the player

400
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:08,131
and also gaffer all the stories around

401
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:10,332
the main plot like this.

402
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:16,856
It was also something we used to trick our YouTubers

403
00:23:16,936 --> 00:23:17,917
and freak them out a bit.

404
00:23:19,378 --> 00:23:25,481
So because when you reach 666, you played 63 years,

405
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:30,725
so you know how the game works, you're sort of familiar

406
00:23:30,745 --> 00:23:34,067
with it, you play 10 to 15 minutes, so you play through

407
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:39,750
100 cards about, so that's the perfect moment to just

408
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:43,952
break everything and that works very well with YouTubers.

409
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:47,974
So I want to conclude now.

410
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:51,535
I'll try to sum up the main idea that's behind

411
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:53,336
most of the things I described today.

412
00:23:55,396 --> 00:23:57,257
Which is basically that for me,

413
00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:00,838
game dev, and I try to do it in rangs,

414
00:24:01,498 --> 00:24:04,039
game dev is more an exploration

415
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:07,420
than the completion of a system.

416
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:10,842
I think it's more interesting to try to explore a concept

417
00:24:10,902 --> 00:24:14,143
than just try to make the perfect game, if you want.

418
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,327
What I mean by perfect system,

419
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:24,933
I think we sort of all game designer

420
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:26,554
wants to create the perfect game

421
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:29,157
that's perfectly balanced, like a perfect machine

422
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:33,641
where every cog just is connected to every other cog.

423
00:24:35,503 --> 00:24:39,485
But it's perfect because it's complete and clean

424
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:43,347
and defined in a specific space.

425
00:24:44,528 --> 00:24:47,290
Like the big machine in Modern Times from Charlie Chaplin.

426
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:53,316
I think this is a bit past this vision of things.

427
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:57,257
I think it's more interesting to start to think

428
00:24:57,297 --> 00:24:58,818
about exploration of concepts

429
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:01,639
and exploration of game mechanics.

430
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,001
It's a different attitude.

431
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:09,664
Exploration, what do I mean by that?

432
00:25:09,684 --> 00:25:12,166
I really mean the two phases of exploration,

433
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:16,189
which is the preparation and the expedition itself.

434
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:22,154
During preparation, you will try to be as precise

435
00:25:22,535 --> 00:25:25,297
and as perfect as possible, actually.

436
00:25:25,677 --> 00:25:27,679
You have to gather all the skills you will need

437
00:25:27,699 --> 00:25:29,140
to make the game...

438
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:34,765
As you want it, you will have to define a budget and a planning

439
00:25:35,346 --> 00:25:40,050
and gather the tools that you will need to do the expedition itself.

440
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,853
You have to stabilize the core game mechanics and the main code

441
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:46,876
while keeping them scalable and expandable.

442
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:52,421
So it goes really beyond the idea of a basic prototype.

443
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:54,503
You have to think in your prototype,

444
00:25:55,283 --> 00:25:56,745
it's not just the prototypes,

445
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,927
the prototype and every tool that you will need

446
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:02,010
to actually bring your game to its final state.

447
00:26:03,972 --> 00:26:06,474
After that, you've got the exploration phase on the right.

448
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,502
So it's when you go exploring,

449
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:14,204
so you manage your resources dynamically,

450
00:26:14,404 --> 00:26:16,545
you don't stay on your toes, okay,

451
00:26:16,565 --> 00:26:19,187
you have to move, you have to be dynamic,

452
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:22,710
and adapt everything along the way.

453
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:26,472
Like we did, for example, with the Devil,

454
00:26:26,772 --> 00:26:28,133
that was not initially in the game,

455
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:30,735
and we sort of adapted also the game

456
00:26:30,775 --> 00:26:33,417
to fit that sort of backstory.

457
00:26:34,998 --> 00:26:37,840
You may have an end goal, like reaching the softball here,

458
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:43,205
but maybe you don't, because it's not very important.

459
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:46,908
I think the most important thing happens during the journey

460
00:26:47,128 --> 00:26:48,569
because it's where the science happens,

461
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:51,871
it's where you will actually discover new stuff,

462
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:56,135
and it's where I think it becomes interesting

463
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,817
to create variations around game mechanics.

464
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:03,471
And what we tried to do in RANX, until very late in the dev,

465
00:27:03,591 --> 00:27:07,313
I had no idea when the game would be finished.

466
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:13,677
770 cards is actually very, I mean, very arbitral.

467
00:27:13,997 --> 00:27:18,320
So it's not really something I defined at the start.

468
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,983
It's when, through playtest and through my own

469
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:26,845
understanding, I thought that the game was complete,

470
00:27:26,905 --> 00:27:27,246
if you want.

471
00:27:29,657 --> 00:27:31,618
So as a result of this exploration,

472
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:35,060
RANX is not a perfect system and it's not a perfect game.

473
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,281
I mean, it's pretty imbalanced

474
00:27:36,341 --> 00:27:38,342
and some things don't actually make a lot of sense.

475
00:27:39,663 --> 00:27:44,046
But it's an ample trial at exploring a concept

476
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,988
and just make the most of it.

477
00:27:47,508 --> 00:27:51,371
And I hope to think that's what also a reason

478
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:52,752
for the success of RANX.

479
00:27:54,793 --> 00:27:56,375
Why am I spending so much time on this?

480
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:59,038
Because I think this idea of exploration

481
00:27:59,058 --> 00:28:01,641
is actually, it's not just an interesting way

482
00:28:01,661 --> 00:28:04,043
to make games as a designer, that's a bit selfish.

483
00:28:04,304 --> 00:28:05,966
I think it's always about the player,

484
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:07,908
and in the end it's always about the players.

485
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,253
When you consider a game design as an exploration,

486
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,876
you embark your players with you.

487
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:18,038
and you make them part of your exploration.

488
00:28:18,618 --> 00:28:21,180
Like in Spelunky, some things happen in the game

489
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,084
that are not anticipated by the designers themselves.

490
00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:30,227
You let them find different routes in your games,

491
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:31,788
you let them break your game,

492
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:37,132
and they will make a connection that you didn't anticipate.

493
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:40,114
They will use their imagination and their critical thinking,

494
00:28:40,194 --> 00:28:41,215
and I think we need that.

495
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:43,196
On the contrary,

496
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:43,736
when you...

497
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:48,638
attempt to make a game that's supposed to be a perfect system,

498
00:28:48,658 --> 00:28:52,620
the player is just generally only considered as an operator

499
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:57,021
of the overall game itself.

500
00:28:57,181 --> 00:29:00,822
An operator defined by a demographic and a set

501
00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:04,923
of behaviors. Like Charlie Chaplin in Modern Times,

502
00:29:04,983 --> 00:29:06,544
the only way you have to interact

503
00:29:07,104 --> 00:29:11,527
or to go be, to become creative with that sort of system

504
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:15,369
is actually to break it and walk away.

505
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:19,511
So I personally think that this way of designing stuff

506
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,674
is a very strong poison of our modern societies

507
00:29:23,714 --> 00:29:25,615
and it's not just games, it's a lot of stuff

508
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:30,338
that goes far, far beyond what games.

509
00:29:32,098 --> 00:29:38,181
My mentor and a guy who was a philosopher and sematician,

510
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:43,603
Jean Shagibov, said it's an object on mechanist

511
00:29:44,004 --> 00:29:45,324
sort of way of thinking.

512
00:29:45,724 --> 00:29:47,865
By that he means some sort of pragmatism

513
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,567
which is actually trapped in a set of values

514
00:29:51,987 --> 00:29:56,609
that make it toxic, okay?

515
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,872
I don't want to finish this talk on this.

516
00:30:00,853 --> 00:30:03,155
I want to finish this talk on the metamorphobate,

517
00:30:03,395 --> 00:30:06,417
which is for me a perfect example of this sort of stuff,

518
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,139
far better than the rings.

519
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,941
Because with very simple mechanics,

520
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,584
like a couple of ideas,

521
00:30:14,585 --> 00:30:18,708
like discovering the letters and the words.

522
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:25,332
and very simple interactions which are basically touch and drag

523
00:30:25,812 --> 00:30:29,794
and a lot of very interesting tools to play with that.

524
00:30:29,814 --> 00:30:37,398
It created a word that's both evocative, crazy, mad, meaningful.

525
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:40,919
So that's very interesting. If you don't know that, just check it out.

526
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:41,620
Thank you.

527
00:30:54,254 --> 00:30:56,716
I hope we have a couple of minutes for questions.

528
00:30:56,756 --> 00:30:59,338
There are a microphone somewhere.

529
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,804
Yeah, here and here, if you want to ask questions.

530
00:31:11,889 --> 00:31:13,170
Hi, I'm Chris.

531
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,271
I just want to ask, do you use Tinder?

532
00:31:19,401 --> 00:31:24,144
What I answer to that is I signed a non-disclosure agreement with my wife.

533
00:31:28,026 --> 00:31:28,886
Any other questions?

534
00:31:43,214 --> 00:31:45,015
Yeah, ask the question, I will repeat it.

535
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:49,898
you think breaks itself well?

536
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,703
So, the question is, what other games

537
00:31:54,123 --> 00:31:56,466
breaks, you think breaks itself well?

538
00:31:58,709 --> 00:31:59,349
I think,

539
00:31:59,369 --> 00:31:59,990
so,

540
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,682
Yeah, I would say in a control way,

541
00:32:07,702 --> 00:32:09,824
definitely Spelunky.

542
00:32:10,324 --> 00:32:12,045
I think it's very important work

543
00:32:13,146 --> 00:32:16,328
because it's not broken,

544
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:20,772
but it sort of allowed some sort of broken behaviors

545
00:32:20,832 --> 00:32:21,552
from the players,

546
00:32:21,592 --> 00:32:23,894
and that's very interesting stuff, I think.

547
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:24,374
Yeah.

548
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:30,419
All right.

549
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,680
Thank you.
