00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:11,407
Scott Rigby. We're going to be talking about autonomy today and something that for a title

2
00:00:11,407 --> 00:00:17,350
I started to call the freedom fallacy. And I'll give you a little background on how we're

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,651
going to set up the talk. Really, it's, you know, over the last decade, two types of games

4
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:27,654
have made the most money, driven the most gamer hours. And one is competitive multiplayer

5
00:00:27,654 --> 00:00:29,335
and the other is open world genres.

6
00:00:30,643 --> 00:00:35,807
And what we're going to do today, because we had to sort of pick a lane and then drive down it,

7
00:00:35,807 --> 00:00:39,450
is that we're going to look at open world, because when we're...

8
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,373
It's not that autonomy is only important in open world games.

9
00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:51,000
In fact, autonomy is probably the single most important player experience variable across all genres.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,882
Is the building okay?

11
00:00:53,882 --> 00:00:57,125
When I stopped, it stopped. I didn't realize I had that kind of power.

12
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:03,581
But anyway, we're going to talk about open world games as a way of talking about autonomy,

13
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:07,324
but the principles we're going to talk about today are highly applicable, really, regardless

14
00:01:07,324 --> 00:01:08,765
of what you're working on.

15
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:12,568
Just some quick background on me and my group and my company.

16
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:15,530
I'm a behavioral scientist by training.

17
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,133
I focused a lot on motivation and emotion and understanding what were the different

18
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:21,354
contexts and forces that would...

19
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:26,757
motivate people both in high quality ways and bad ways.

20
00:01:26,757 --> 00:01:30,358
And I did that work way back, I don't know, too long ago,

21
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:32,479
about 25 years ago is when I finished that,

22
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,360
and I immediately pivoted out of that

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,222
and tried to start applying it to various work contexts

24
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,423
and commercial contexts, one of them being video games.

25
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:43,885
And so we started doing that work about 15 years ago.

26
00:01:43,885 --> 00:01:46,326
We then added to the team, and Immersive Games,

27
00:01:46,326 --> 00:01:48,227
all the senior leadership are either

28
00:01:48,988 --> 00:01:53,772
researchers and people looking at motivation and good methodology, or there are people

29
00:01:53,772 --> 00:01:59,017
that are coming out of the industry who've had roles from studio head to producer to

30
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:00,579
essentially everything in the food chain.

31
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:05,904
And we really wanted to have both of those things in the organization to drive our culture

32
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:10,228
and make sure that whatever we were doing, we wanted it to be valid.

33
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:13,711
And we also want it to be practical.

34
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:15,333
And so that's really what we are at our heart.

35
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,656
So we do a tremendous amount of work on video games.

36
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:23,120
We do probably 40 or 50 different research projects a year on video games.

37
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,603
And we've been at this for about 15 years now.

38
00:02:26,603 --> 00:02:30,326
We have a model called the Player Experience of Need Satisfaction Model

39
00:02:30,326 --> 00:02:32,068
that I'm going to touch on today.

40
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,390
And that's really at the heart of the stuff we're going to talk about.

41
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,451
Autonomy is one of the things in that model.

42
00:02:36,777 --> 00:02:42,400
I did want to say that that model has a tremendous amount of validation, and I really just wanted

43
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,324
to touch on that point because you hear a lot of models when you're coming to GDC and

44
00:02:48,324 --> 00:02:48,644
out there.

45
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:51,466
People are always being really creative about thinking about what is it.

46
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:53,147
We're all trying to understand our players.

47
00:02:53,927 --> 00:02:59,551
One of the things about our model is, because of our pedigree in science and our disposition,

48
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:04,894
we've taken it out and we've made it available for people at other academic institutions

49
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:08,996
and basic scientists to independently test it, because we really wanted to know, is it

50
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:10,417
valid, does it work?

51
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:15,780
And there's a lot of literature validating it, and so if people afterwards want a reading

52
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,962
list or want some of that material, I'm happy to provide it.

53
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:23,783
As I said, this model is called the Player Experience of Need Satisfaction Model.

54
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:29,165
I'm not going to be going into the components of it in a tremendous amount of detail because

55
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:33,886
I've done that like 12 times over the last 10 GDCs.

56
00:03:33,886 --> 00:03:38,047
So there's a lot of stuff in the vault on the model.

57
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:40,087
So if people want to get a lot of the background material.

58
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,728
But this is really kind of a, I don't know.

59
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:49,193
level 200 or 300 course looking specifically at autonomy.

60
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:52,376
I do want to touch on the model briefly though

61
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:55,438
as just a little bit of a cliff notes or a primer.

62
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,241
And the model really has at its core,

63
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:01,183
there are lots of different dimensions to it,

64
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:02,905
but at its core it talks about the fact

65
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:07,649
that all of us have basic psychological needs

66
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:10,351
that we have are intrinsically motivated to have satisfied.

67
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:12,793
and that move us forward.

68
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:15,294
In other words, we don't need anything external to us

69
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:17,055
in order to motivate ourselves.

70
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:19,277
We have things happening inside,

71
00:04:19,277 --> 00:04:21,698
and it's our philosophy,

72
00:04:21,698 --> 00:04:23,519
and the science bears this out,

73
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,540
that if you can create the circumstances

74
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,582
that let me have those needs satisfied,

75
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:30,283
you have reached to the deepest,

76
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:32,204
most powerful form of motivation.

77
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:34,206
And of course, this is very important

78
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:35,787
in the video game space

79
00:04:35,787 --> 00:04:38,008
because games are a discretionary activity.

80
00:04:38,008 --> 00:04:39,889
People do them because they want to do them,

81
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:40,750
and there's lots of...

82
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:41,810
competition.

83
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,212
And so being able to develop that deep, high-quality motivation is really essential.

84
00:04:46,212 --> 00:04:49,513
So just quickly, those three needs are the need for autonomy, which we're going to

85
00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:51,554
talk about a lot today.

86
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:55,916
That's in short our desire to feel like we're writing our own story in life, that

87
00:04:55,916 --> 00:05:00,738
we're agentic about what we're doing and that we're endorsing the path that we're

88
00:05:00,738 --> 00:05:01,038
on.

89
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:03,759
And as we'll see, I'm going to use a word a lot today called volition.

90
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,499
We're going to get to that in just a few minutes.

91
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,142
The second need is the need for relatedness.

92
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,904
This is our desire to feel like we belong,

93
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:13,386
that we're connected to others, that I matter to you,

94
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:14,487
and you matter to me.

95
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:16,849
And the third is the need for competence,

96
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,590
or sometimes we call it mastery.

97
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,473
And this is our desire to feel successful and effective

98
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:22,574
in what we're doing,

99
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:25,316
and also to feel like we're growing and elaborating ourselves,

100
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:29,640
and we're reaching more and more abilities and experiences.

101
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:32,804
And so these are the three core needs, and I'll be referencing back to them.

102
00:05:32,804 --> 00:05:38,148
Today we're really going to focus on the primary need for autonomy.

103
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:40,649
And it's because this is really the foundation,

104
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:45,112
core foundation of what makes modern games work.

105
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,574
Now I bet if I said to everybody here,

106
00:05:47,574 --> 00:05:49,515
do you know what autonomy is?

107
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:51,849
Everybody would say that they did know what autonomy was,

108
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:54,370
because it's a pretty common word.

109
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,292
It's not like a 50-cent word.

110
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,033
We hear it all the time.

111
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:01,756
And developers design using a general sense for autonomy

112
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:02,436
all the time.

113
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:03,977
It's like, OK, I need to give my player

114
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:06,059
this thing called autonomy.

115
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:09,141
So I'm going to insert your custom recipe right here.

116
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:12,003
The problem is that, or the challenge is,

117
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:14,425
that autonomy is a very complex.

118
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:18,407
construct and misunderstanding it can backfire.

119
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:22,230
And I'm gonna tell actual case examples

120
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,252
as we go along here of how that's happened.

121
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,914
So what we wanna do today,

122
00:06:27,914 --> 00:06:29,495
now since the doors are closed,

123
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:32,477
what we wanna do is we wanna science this up

124
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:34,478
so that we can help everybody understand autonomy.

125
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,880
Not just make autonomy, but the blue autonomy

126
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,562
so that you can dominate the market.

127
00:06:41,086 --> 00:06:44,167
So it's really understandable, by the way, that autonomy is misunderstood

128
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:49,569
because the dictionary doesn't even get it right from the standpoint of psychology.

129
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:55,351
If you look at definitions of autonomy, you see that lots of words like freedom

130
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:58,333
and independence and freedom and independence.

131
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,053
It's just sort of everywhere.

132
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,974
And there's a reason that it's like that and why it makes sense

133
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:07,096
because that definition works for, let's say, if you're talking about countries.

134
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:09,477
If you're talking about Australia or you're talking about Bolivia.

135
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:15,339
except this isn't really Bolivia, this is Paraguay.

136
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:20,260
I'm sorry, we just have John Oliver fans on our staff that help me put this deck together.

137
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,922
And maybe most apropos for this, the best example for this audience would be, you know,

138
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:25,922
Naboo.

139
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:29,443
But, you know, it's okay if we talk about countries in this way, or if we're, more and

140
00:07:29,443 --> 00:07:34,184
more you're hearing about autonomous cars and different technologies, and it makes sense

141
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:38,446
that when we're talking about those things, you know, that, you know, independence maybe

142
00:07:38,446 --> 00:07:39,086
is the right thing.

143
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:46,102
term. But when we're talking about people, it doesn't apply. We're complex. We have consciousness,

144
00:07:46,102 --> 00:07:51,727
right? I mean, I don't mean to get too Cartesian about the whole thing, but you know, we have a

145
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:57,272
will and a self, and that creates a lot of complexity when we're trying to understand

146
00:07:57,272 --> 00:07:59,174
the notion of autonomy.

147
00:07:59,954 --> 00:08:07,636
And so what I want to do right up front is pivot us from the idea that autonomy is about freedom or independence

148
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:12,798
to this definition which is autonomy means that when we act, we do so volitionally.

149
00:08:12,798 --> 00:08:17,919
This is the new synonym I want to give for autonomy here.

150
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,741
And volition isn't independence or freedom to do whatever you want.

151
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:27,642
Volition is wanting to do the things that you are doing, right?

152
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:33,257
God bless the internet.

153
00:08:33,257 --> 00:08:39,799
So the freedom fallacy, as I said in the title,

154
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,560
is that autonomy equals freedom, that freedom

155
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,460
is a synonym for autonomy.

156
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,221
In reality, autonomy equals volition.

157
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:53,263
And I'm going to give some proof here from everyday life.

158
00:08:55,692 --> 00:09:00,753
There are many ways that we freely relinquish freedom in our lives.

159
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:04,495
So if we think about autonomy as freedom, that thesis gets disproven

160
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:07,516
in the way that we actually act and go about our lives.

161
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:14,038
So probably the biggest one is we meet people, we fall in love,

162
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:15,178
and we get married.

163
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:17,739
And so then freedom actually goes down.

164
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:21,710
We can no longer stay up to the mill the night of release.

165
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,311
I can't, I don't know.

166
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,811
But things change.

167
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:27,613
But interestingly, our volition goes up.

168
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:29,854
And our sense of agency and that we're

169
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:33,596
writing our personal narrative and that sense of autonomy,

170
00:09:33,596 --> 00:09:37,298
things go up, even though we've given up freedom.

171
00:09:37,298 --> 00:09:40,439
And then, of course, that story only gets more complex.

172
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:41,380
And then, but again, it's.

173
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:48,566
This is what somebody with a small child puts us into every deck, maybe in a few years I won't but...

174
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:53,411
But you know, it's the most wonderful thing but it's also a tremendous, we're tremendously giving up freedom.

175
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:57,736
So if we think about it as if from a freedom standpoint, we have a problem.

176
00:09:58,503 --> 00:10:00,745
But when we think about it from a volitional standpoint,

177
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:03,787
remember, we have multiple basic needs.

178
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:05,909
It's not just that we want to be the authors of our lives.

179
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:08,951
We want to actually do something in those lives.

180
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:12,313
We want to have needs satisfied for belongingness,

181
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:15,756
and connection, and growth, and all of these different things.

182
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:19,358
And so all of those needs drive volitional behavior.

183
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:21,140
And when that happens, we feel agentic.

184
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:25,199
And we feel like we are authoring our lives in a much fuller way

185
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:29,660
than if we were simply behaving independently or behaving with freedom.

186
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,161
So we create in our own lives structures and all these other things

187
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:36,261
that are rich with need satisfaction.

188
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:39,402
And it's that idea that's the overarching thing I want to talk about today.

189
00:10:39,402 --> 00:10:41,542
Is that really when we're talking about,

190
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:44,583
we're going to look at it in open world games, but we're looking in games,

191
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,143
it's not creating freedom, let players do whatever they want,

192
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:48,143
give them independence.

193
00:10:48,783 --> 00:10:57,366
It's about creating that need satisfying structure, content, and systems so that they are volitionally

194
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,667
engaged and deeply satisfied.

195
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:06,189
And these needs are really the three channels for building that volitional engagement and

196
00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:06,549
satisfaction.

197
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:10,850
So that's just a little bit of a kind of run up to how we're going to think about autonomy,

198
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:16,772
but let's start talking a little bit about what does this mean for games.

199
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:24,689
Well, the first thing is that there are some sacred cows out there, debates that, you know,

200
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:30,273
I think have started to change, but certainly were red hot, you know, years ago before,

201
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,875
you know, single player games started to become less and less popular.

202
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:38,078
This whole thing about, well, players really want good story, and it's my job, I need to

203
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:39,819
give them an experience.

204
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:42,921
You know, I'm going to give them some choices, but it's really about giving them experience.

205
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:45,203
And then there are other people like, no,

206
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:48,265
like here are all these examples where you need

207
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:49,126
to give them freedom, right?

208
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,086
Because that's what players want,

209
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:52,388
where they want to create their own stories.

210
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,330
And the reality is that that's a false dichotomy.

211
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,552
Players, everybody is right in that scenario.

212
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:59,054
The thing that unifies it is if you think about it

213
00:11:59,054 --> 00:12:02,356
as volition, if you think about it as how do we satisfy

214
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:05,258
players' needs, the reality is, and we're gonna see this

215
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:09,702
in games, that there are components of narrative and,

216
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:14,224
you know, rich narrative that's written by you guys,

217
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:21,786
that we're drawing players into through a focus on need satisfaction, and then there's also satisfaction through

218
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:27,768
more open, choiceful mechanics that we think about more traditionally as the purview of open-world games.

219
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,586
And another thing is that I always hear terms that trouble me a little bit.

220
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,069
So the whole idea of sandbox games.

221
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:36,611
I know sandbox games are a thing.

222
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:41,479
And I don't have time today to go into when sandbox works.

223
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,843
But a lot of times, the idea of sandbox.

224
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,423
They can really turn into motivational sand traps

225
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:48,244
because you sit there and you're like,

226
00:12:48,244 --> 00:12:49,824
I'm going to build this experience.

227
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:52,205
I'm going to put all these activities in there.

228
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,105
But I don't think about the question of

229
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:56,746
what am I going to do in order to build volition

230
00:12:56,746 --> 00:12:59,387
and not just provide all of these things

231
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:01,908
for people to do in the sandbox

232
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:03,748
and then expect them to go out and do that.

233
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:05,488
And so even successful games

234
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:09,269
make this mistake quite frequently.

235
00:13:11,462 --> 00:13:14,144
You can see examples in almost every successful game out there.

236
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:22,532
So you take Red Dead Redemption, and this is, of course, a story where you're John Marston.

237
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:25,875
You're bringing your own brand of justice to the West.

238
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,316
You know, this is powerful.

239
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:33,802
And the way you're going to do that is sitting at a wood table and making sure you don't cut off your own finger.

240
00:13:33,802 --> 00:13:36,224
Or your Altair.

241
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,043
People whisper throughout Italy in hushed tones of your incredible ability to clean

242
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:44,443
up after the pigeons.

243
00:13:44,443 --> 00:13:51,746
Or you're these guys, you know, cyber super hackers.

244
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:56,488
I don't know what the tagline is for these guys, but they look pretty badass, right?

245
00:13:56,488 --> 00:14:00,190
It doesn't seem like they're going to take down the system by playing chess in the park.

246
00:14:01,868 --> 00:14:04,869
particularly if they're doing it with an analog speed clock,

247
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:07,530
which seems a little unusual for a hacker thing.

248
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,331
Anyway, I don't mean to pick on these things.

249
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:13,532
What I'm trying to bring up is all games do this

250
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:16,613
because when you build a big world,

251
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:19,173
on the checklist is I have to put things into that world

252
00:14:19,173 --> 00:14:19,874
for people to do.

253
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:22,294
What are people gonna do in this world?

254
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,015
And that's the right idea.

255
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:26,675
But the issue is you need to ask the question,

256
00:14:26,675 --> 00:14:28,056
do these things build volition?

257
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,108
Are they helping the player to create their own agentic player narrative where they feel

258
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,889
need satisfaction in those things?

259
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:41,675
And if those activities are not, are just things out there for someone to do but are

260
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:45,559
decoupled from any need satisfaction point.

261
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,863
then they're not going to be activities that the player engages in.

262
00:14:48,863 --> 00:14:53,027
And so one thing that I always recommend when we're talking to developers

263
00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:54,689
is when you're thinking about these systems,

264
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:55,870
when you're thinking about content,

265
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,812
when you're thinking about all these necessary ways

266
00:14:57,812 --> 00:15:00,676
to layer in this activity into a game,

267
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:02,518
to include this on your checklist.

268
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:06,542
You know, how are you building volition in engaging in the activity?

269
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:10,366
One thing that's really promising, though, about this idea

270
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:14,389
and the pivoting from freedom to volition

271
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:17,672
is we no longer have to be afraid of structure

272
00:15:17,672 --> 00:15:21,875
and kind of directing players to do things.

273
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,637
It's okay to direct players to do things.

274
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:26,279
As a matter of fact, in all the research that we've done,

275
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,180
both in games and out of games,

276
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,384
structure is better than providing open and free environments

277
00:15:32,384 --> 00:15:34,466
in satisfying people's needs for autonomy.

278
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,868
And this relates right back to the point I made.

279
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:41,152
with the example of people getting married and doing all these things is that when you

280
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:47,219
provide structure, you're essentially communicating to them, here are pathways, here are ways

281
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:49,482
in which you can have your needs satisfied.

282
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,705
You can engage in these activities.

283
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:52,686
You can engage in them.

284
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:54,988
By the way, the structure of this activity is

285
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:59,532
you can do a bigger sandcastle if you are doing it with another player.

286
00:15:59,532 --> 00:16:04,035
So there's opportunities to satisfy relatedness, there's opportunities.

287
00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:07,558
It's creating those structures that telegraph or communicate

288
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:11,140
need satisfaction that actually build that volitional engagement

289
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,004
and not just giving them a lot of freedom to do whatever they want to do.

290
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:17,585
Even if the game is enormous.

291
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:21,087
and it's filled with tons of activities,

292
00:16:21,087 --> 00:16:24,970
it doesn't matter if the player doesn't see meaning

293
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,572
in the options that are in front of them.

294
00:16:27,572 --> 00:16:30,894
So in Far Cry 3, I'm just picking one at random.

295
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:34,376
I'm trying to pick from a variety of different games.

296
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:37,859
There's the opportunity to go kill water buffalos

297
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:40,521
so that you can get crafting materials.

298
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:44,844
And of course, when you first go to do this,

299
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:46,105
this has a meaning.

300
00:16:46,817 --> 00:16:51,161
It has meaning in building volition because there are needs being satisfied.

301
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:54,684
You know, you have the ability to craft materials and make different things, which gives you

302
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:58,347
meaningful choice, which makes you more agentic, which satisfies autonomy.

303
00:16:58,347 --> 00:17:01,910
You also are crafting things that help to increase your ability and power, which is

304
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,211
helping growth and efficacy.

305
00:17:04,211 --> 00:17:05,512
So you have autonomy and competence.

306
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:08,075
I don't think there's any relatedness needs in shooting the water buffalo.

307
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:08,795
I don't really know.

308
00:17:10,158 --> 00:17:15,220
So that's the thing is in this formula, it doesn't mean you've got to hit every need every single time

309
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,582
But you can see that you can the way I just did you can look at any activity and try to tear it down about

310
00:17:19,582 --> 00:17:24,244
What is going to be the experience in terms of need satisfaction that builds volition?

311
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:30,206
And the problem here is that once you get the thing that'll that that and so it's no longer relevant

312
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:37,869
You still have all these water buffaloes on the map, but essentially you've you've lost any support for volitional engagement in that activity

313
00:17:38,522 --> 00:17:42,086
And what happens then is you've still got a map with a lot of water buffaloes on it,

314
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:45,128
but now all these things that are so-called opportunities for action

315
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:48,912
or things that you want to do, these are really just points of noise.

316
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:51,054
They aren't really opportunities.

317
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:56,319
So the key is not just to offer more things

318
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,800
and fill up the world with things to do.

319
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:02,547
It's certainly more is better, but it's most important that,

320
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:05,188
however much you have, you need to have a dense network

321
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:07,510
of things that matter to people,

322
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,551
because that's what drives volitional engagement.

323
00:18:09,551 --> 00:18:12,333
Now, just as a little sidebar,

324
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,814
you hear this all the time, you want meaningful activities,

325
00:18:14,814 --> 00:18:16,055
you need things that matter,

326
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:17,356
you need things that people value.

327
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:20,838
We're always, I mean, nobody describes their game

328
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:22,539
as it's a game full of experiences.

329
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:25,101
They say it's a game full of great experiences,

330
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:27,342
it's a game full of meaningful experiences.

331
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:30,625
But when you look at those words, again,

332
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,087
as a behavioral psychologist, I'm like, OK, well,

333
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,789
how are we going to define what those words mean?

334
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:38,852
There are many different ways you could do that.

335
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:43,215
But really, when I'm talking about meaningful experiences,

336
00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:47,138
valued experiences, it really does all come back to,

337
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:48,620
are these needs being satisfied?

338
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,081
And I say that because we've just

339
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:53,143
collected a lot of data to see that that works really strongly.

340
00:18:53,143 --> 00:18:55,585
Other things may work, but we know this works really well.

341
00:18:56,954 --> 00:19:01,557
So I want to next take a little bit of time and go through

342
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,759
some of the ways that modern games and leading games,

343
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:08,102
open world games right now, are building volition

344
00:19:08,102 --> 00:19:10,403
and deeply satisfying autonomy.

345
00:19:10,403 --> 00:19:14,046
Because even though the ingredients may be the same,

346
00:19:14,046 --> 00:19:15,807
autonomy, competence, relatedness,

347
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:17,568
the formulas can change.

348
00:19:17,568 --> 00:19:21,230
There's a lot of opportunity to be very creative

349
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,411
in how these things get satisfied.

350
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:22,691
So the first is,

351
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:28,261
you know, what we call the amusement park structure.

352
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:33,929
And this is really invented and forever dominated by

353
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:36,553
the game that essentially created the open world genre,

354
00:19:36,553 --> 00:19:38,196
you could argue, which is Grand Theft Auto.

355
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:44,140
And the amusement park structure operates on a pretty simple premise,

356
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,201
which is build a dense world of satisfying rides, right?

357
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:50,882
So when you are engaged in the narratives in Grand Theft Auto,

358
00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:53,523
it's not really your narrative.

359
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:56,184
You're switching characters, you're engaging different stories,

360
00:19:56,184 --> 00:20:01,045
but you're getting exposed to this world and these opportunities of things

361
00:20:01,045 --> 00:20:04,786
that have meaningful value in that when you engage in them.

362
00:20:05,677 --> 00:20:09,621
there you know you're conquering challenges you're

363
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:12,865
these are not these are good rides right and because there's

364
00:20:12,865 --> 00:20:15,408
enough of a spectrum of these good rides it's actually very

365
00:20:15,408 --> 00:20:18,912
need satisfying and you feel a sense of meaningful choice.

366
00:20:19,712 --> 00:20:21,373
So this is all building volition.

367
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:25,275
So GTA doesn't win because it's really big

368
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:26,656
and there's lots of things to do.

369
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:30,297
And I mean, whenever any open world game starts to come out,

370
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:32,798
people start, one of the metrics that people start

371
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,759
talking about is how big it is.

372
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:37,201
Well, we discovered you can take the last version

373
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:41,082
of our game and fit it into a map that's 10 times as big.

374
00:20:41,082 --> 00:20:43,083
And everybody gets very excited about that.

375
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:45,880
And the reason people get excited about that is

376
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,301
one of the ways that players assume that they're gonna have

377
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:51,722
all kinds of autonomy is it's big,

378
00:20:51,722 --> 00:20:55,204
because they give you the benefit of the doubt

379
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:59,066
that no matter how big it is, it's gonna be awesome.

380
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:02,447
So that's kind of, I guess, a good thing,

381
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:05,748
but it also creates a very high bar to clear.

382
00:21:05,748 --> 00:21:07,749
So you get a lot of freedom, but you also have

383
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:10,270
all of these really enjoyable

384
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,972
and meaningful activities in GTA.

385
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:13,932
But what GTA lacks.

386
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,480
are rich opportunities for growth,

387
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,900
you know, it doesn't have RPG mechanics,

388
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,481
or, you know, again I'm talking about early,

389
00:21:20,481 --> 00:21:21,881
you know, early GTA,

390
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,923
I know there's multiplayer and all these other things,

391
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:28,384
now I'm just trying to lay out

392
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:30,084
a little bit of the

393
00:21:30,084 --> 00:21:30,765
fundamental DNA

394
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:33,245
of the game. And what it lacks

395
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:35,026
really are rich opportunities for growth and also

396
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:36,287
for creating a player's story.

397
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:39,548
Because the whole idea of a player narrative

398
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:45,981
The player narrative is really critical because that's how players integrate and amplify volition.

399
00:21:45,981 --> 00:21:48,866
We're engaged in a personal narrative all the time.

400
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:53,334
And when we go into games, that narrative just continues.

401
00:21:55,246 --> 00:21:58,088
These narratives will ideally reflect the player's self,

402
00:21:58,088 --> 00:22:01,871
interests, and values, and games can build volition

403
00:22:01,871 --> 00:22:05,153
by giving players the appropriate tools

404
00:22:05,153 --> 00:22:08,316
in order to build those narratives.

405
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:10,618
And so what we see in GTA is we don't see

406
00:22:10,618 --> 00:22:12,899
a lot of rich building blocks for that,

407
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:16,242
but amusement park structures are relatively thin,

408
00:22:16,242 --> 00:22:19,384
but they do give kind of words and verbs.

409
00:22:19,384 --> 00:22:21,766
I'm gonna bowl, I'm a triathlete,

410
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:23,327
I'm gonna be in a drag race.

411
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:27,609
And so the player then has to assemble, you know, essentially a narrative about,

412
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:31,311
well, I'm a really, I'm like the most awesome drag racer, you know, in GTA,

413
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:33,892
or, you know, they're assembling a narrative.

414
00:22:33,892 --> 00:22:36,514
But, you know, it's really, it's relatively thin.

415
00:22:36,514 --> 00:22:41,076
And so, when we then start to look at some other examples of how

416
00:22:41,076 --> 00:22:45,458
needs get satisfied in open worlds, we start to see how people turn the knobs

417
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,140
on some of these things in order to increase volitional engagement.

418
00:22:50,297 --> 00:22:54,221
So the next thing I want to turn to is an approach called the dense RPG approach.

419
00:22:54,221 --> 00:22:57,083
And a good representative for this is Skyrim.

420
00:22:57,083 --> 00:23:03,008
People have played the hell out of Skyrim for a lot of hours over a very long period of time.

421
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:06,672
It has a very high level of sustained engagement and volitional engagement.

422
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:20,430
And Skyrim really wins because they have incredibly rich RPG systems that deepen volition by empowering growth and providing richer narrative threads.

423
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,872
They're giving much longer narrative threads than you would in an amusement park structure, right?

424
00:23:23,872 --> 00:23:28,134
So there's just a staggering amount of things that you can do.

425
00:23:29,155 --> 00:23:29,755
when you're in the game.

426
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:35,196
And this results in more elements of need satisfaction

427
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:36,537
in order to build volition.

428
00:23:36,537 --> 00:23:38,777
You've got more meaningful choice,

429
00:23:38,777 --> 00:23:41,698
but you also now have the ability to build

430
00:23:41,698 --> 00:23:43,479
agentic narratives, because you've got

431
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:45,139
all these narrative threads that you can begin

432
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:47,460
to stitch together to build your narrative.

433
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,780
These are not things that are really present

434
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,180
in the amusement park structure.

435
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,561
That builds volition.

436
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:56,265
The other thing is that you're not just looking at issues of overcoming challenges

437
00:23:56,265 --> 00:24:00,508
and feeling that moment-to-moment satisfaction of competence,

438
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:03,571
you're also engaging in growth through the RPG mechanics.

439
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:07,535
And that is one of the most powerful ways to build volition

440
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:09,516
if you create that meaningful sense of growth in games.

441
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:13,480
So Skyrim, again, using the same ingredients,

442
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,522
but they're essentially...

443
00:24:15,562 --> 00:24:18,706
putting them in in different degrees and creating different

444
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:22,471
systems in order to build volitional engagement.

445
00:24:22,471 --> 00:24:25,496
The main volitional hook of course is this growth.

446
00:24:25,969 --> 00:24:27,830
And it's integrated with a massive quest system.

447
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,332
But I would say that one of the things that's great about it is

448
00:24:30,332 --> 00:24:32,654
that when you engage in quests and you do things,

449
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:34,375
it has an impact on you.

450
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:38,458
So your personal narrative, to be a vampire,

451
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:41,380
you can actually change who you are and become a vampire.

452
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,762
So there's this impact of systems

453
00:24:44,762 --> 00:24:48,705
as you make your choices that truly make the character

454
00:24:48,705 --> 00:24:49,705
that you're building your own.

455
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:54,714
which is really powerful volitionally.

456
00:24:54,714 --> 00:24:58,816
You've got in Skyrim something you don't have in GTA,

457
00:24:58,816 --> 00:25:00,536
which is you get full sentences.

458
00:25:00,536 --> 00:25:02,637
I'm the head of the witcher's college,

459
00:25:02,637 --> 00:25:04,358
and I'm the leader of the thieves' guild.

460
00:25:04,358 --> 00:25:06,378
I suck blood of sleeping villagers.

461
00:25:06,378 --> 00:25:07,899
I now have these larger chunks

462
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:10,620
with which to build my player narrative.

463
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,880
And so all of these things have meaningful impact

464
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,301
on the actual character themselves.

465
00:25:15,301 --> 00:25:19,003
But there's one thing that is missing from this,

466
00:25:19,003 --> 00:25:19,683
which is that

467
00:25:20,962 --> 00:25:23,243
In the end, nothing really matters,

468
00:25:23,243 --> 00:25:24,103
no matter what you decide to do.

469
00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:27,685
You could be a werewolf, vampire, cat, person,

470
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:30,467
who, I don't know, fill in sentences here.

471
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:32,748
Whatever you decide to do,

472
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:35,509
you don't have this major,

473
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:39,211
this main storyline that you're shifting or adapting.

474
00:25:39,211 --> 00:25:41,673
There's no epic impact on the world.

475
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,994
Really, the impact is just building a narrative yourself.

476
00:25:44,992 --> 00:25:48,656
So that's very, it's a very powerful game,

477
00:25:48,656 --> 00:25:51,019
but I want to turn now to another formula

478
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:53,361
that's out there in order to build autonomy

479
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:55,544
and build volitional engagement,

480
00:25:55,544 --> 00:25:57,106
and that's the idea of narrative impact.

481
00:25:57,106 --> 00:26:01,491
So the representative game we're gonna pull here

482
00:26:01,491 --> 00:26:02,592
is Mass Effect.

483
00:26:02,592 --> 00:26:04,514
So Mass Effect.

484
00:26:05,435 --> 00:26:10,384
The main volitional hook, the main thing that makes me feel agentic and engaged in what

485
00:26:10,384 --> 00:26:15,574
I'm doing and need satisfied in what I'm doing is not just I can change the world, I can

486
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,797
change the universe.

487
00:26:19,214 --> 00:26:23,399
And so they're spreading out across multiple needs, various satisfactions.

488
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:25,100
So you're getting meaningful choice.

489
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,303
You probably can't notice it.

490
00:26:27,303 --> 00:26:31,567
It's slightly less meaningful choice, but you're instead of making meaningful choices

491
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:36,933
amongst little tributaries and rivers of things that are going on, as you would in Skyrim,

492
00:26:36,933 --> 00:26:39,156
you're making choices between these sort of deep...

493
00:26:39,696 --> 00:26:41,757
you know, these deep rivers that go very...

494
00:26:41,757 --> 00:26:44,519
and they're all, like, coming towards the ocean

495
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,281
and you have a sense of epic scale.

496
00:26:46,281 --> 00:26:49,062
And this is rendered in the content

497
00:26:49,062 --> 00:26:51,464
and in the cinematics and in all of these things, right?

498
00:26:51,464 --> 00:26:54,346
So you feel this deep sense of narrative purpose.

499
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:58,369
And because you're directing these great narratives,

500
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:01,711
you also have relatedness, right?

501
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:05,033
Everybody that I know has a Mass Effect story

502
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:06,414
about, like, oh, they felt, you know,

503
00:27:06,414 --> 00:27:08,396
they felt this moment of connection.

504
00:27:09,925 --> 00:27:15,631
Mine really was involving Tali and I accidentally killed her and then I had to go back and reload my saved game

505
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:22,839
and it was very traumatic because I didn't know if I saved in time but it's okay, she's okay, she's okay.

506
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:27,384
And then there's also some growth and some overcoming of challenge in the game,

507
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:31,708
but that's not really the tentpole of the Mass Effect experience.

508
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:36,281
So Mass Effect, if Grand Theft Auto gives words,

509
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,723
and if Skyrim gives sentences,

510
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:40,287
Mass Effect is giving whole paragraphs of players

511
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:42,270
to kind of assemble and put together, right?

512
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:46,035
And so you're able to put together a richer story.

513
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:53,184
more quickly that can build a stronger volitional engagement with the game.

514
00:27:53,184 --> 00:27:56,987
And so it's all powerful stuff when it works, right?

515
00:27:56,987 --> 00:28:00,311
When it works and you're telling the story you want to be telling and then you get to

516
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,993
see it jump to life on the screen, it's very powerful.

517
00:28:02,993 --> 00:28:08,539
The problem for you guys as developers is if you take this kind of approach, you have

518
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:10,501
what we call kind of a mind-reading dilemma.

519
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:14,241
which is that you've got to figure out,

520
00:28:14,241 --> 00:28:15,762
not just like this paragraph,

521
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:17,303
and paragraph two, and paragraph seven,

522
00:28:17,303 --> 00:28:17,904
but paragraph 48,

523
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:22,067
and you've got to figure all that stuff out,

524
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,949
and that's really hard to do,

525
00:28:23,949 --> 00:28:27,311
because players are going to have different opinions,

526
00:28:27,311 --> 00:28:30,194
and you can't fully realize every possible outcome.

527
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:34,757
And so your risk of breaking volition is really high, right?

528
00:28:34,757 --> 00:28:36,579
A player could be putting together

529
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:38,521
this really great narrative,

530
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:40,522
and then,

531
00:28:40,522 --> 00:28:40,842
and then,

532
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:44,562
and then try to get to a point that they want to get to.

533
00:28:44,562 --> 00:28:48,082
And if you don't offer it, it's not just that they have a bad moment,

534
00:28:48,082 --> 00:28:51,523
it's that it really blows apart the whole narrative for them.

535
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:58,445
Now, it's the same thing that's going on when we look at what happened

536
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,745
when Mass Effect had the big ending debacle, right?

537
00:29:01,745 --> 00:29:06,886
Because if Mass Effect is sort of standing on...

538
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:13,396
giving people meaningful choice to create their epic story

539
00:29:13,396 --> 00:29:15,117
about how they save the universe,

540
00:29:15,117 --> 00:29:19,139
having everything end the same way is not just like,

541
00:29:19,139 --> 00:29:21,120
oh, I'm really mad at you for doing that.

542
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:28,924
It's you, betrayer, hundreds of, I mean, this is deep,

543
00:29:28,924 --> 00:29:31,586
because we're talking about basic psychological needs.

544
00:29:31,586 --> 00:29:34,868
So what you have happening is by the end of the game,

545
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:42,654
The betrayal happens because they essentially kick out meaningful choice

546
00:29:42,654 --> 00:29:43,755
because the ending is the same.

547
00:29:43,755 --> 00:29:46,156
And then with meaningful choice without that foundation,

548
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:48,617
then there is no narrative purpose.

549
00:29:48,617 --> 00:29:49,578
That falls away.

550
00:29:49,578 --> 00:29:51,939
And then if nothing I did really matters,

551
00:29:51,939 --> 00:29:55,542
then I didn't really save Tally.

552
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:57,763
You know, she doesn't love me.

553
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:58,443
Come to accept it.

554
00:29:58,443 --> 00:29:59,584
You know, that falls away.

555
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:05,454
And then with all that gone, you no longer have any structure supporting volition.

556
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:10,738
And worse yet, you've essentially violated this contract with the player

557
00:30:10,738 --> 00:30:17,344
because you've messed with their basic psychological need for autonomy.

558
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:21,227
And this is the thing about autonomy. Autonomy is powerful stuff.

559
00:30:21,227 --> 00:30:24,610
It's like the fentanyl of... I don't know if that's the best example, but...

560
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,563
You know, it's stuff that, it's super powerful,

561
00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:31,046
but it can, you know, you've got to handle it

562
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:31,966
really carefully.

563
00:30:31,966 --> 00:30:35,650
So, bottom line is, you don't want to mess with autonomy.

564
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:40,053
All right, let's talk about one more,

565
00:30:40,053 --> 00:30:44,677
and then I want to turn a little bit and talk about,

566
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:45,958
based on everything that we've said,

567
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:47,480
about some of these dynamics and systems,

568
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,781
what could come next.

569
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,864
So, the last one I want to talk about is Witcher, which we kind of see as a hybrid.

570
00:30:53,864 --> 00:30:58,209
It's sort of cool when Witcher came out and we had the chance to play that game and look

571
00:30:58,209 --> 00:31:04,255
at that game, because Witcher really takes inspiration from Mass Effect and Skyrim structures.

572
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:10,235
So you see a rich main narrative that's like Mass Effect,

573
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,979
it's fully realized,

574
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:15,402
and there's a beautiful deep story there.

575
00:31:15,402 --> 00:31:19,147
But you also see an incredibly deep system

576
00:31:19,147 --> 00:31:23,613
of quests and stories and activities that can be undertaken.

577
00:31:25,701 --> 00:31:27,282
in the way that Skyrim provides them.

578
00:31:27,282 --> 00:31:31,664
And in some ways, that provides nice coverage,

579
00:31:31,664 --> 00:31:34,006
and that provides nice, dense coverage

580
00:31:34,006 --> 00:31:36,007
for need satisfaction, whether you're engaged

581
00:31:36,007 --> 00:31:39,189
in the big epic story, or you just wanna have

582
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,570
a meaningful couple hours of play

583
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,510
to help yourself progress.

584
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:48,149
Lots of deep volition building, again, meaningful choice over narrative.

585
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:51,031
You've got a lot of the same kind of relational dynamics.

586
00:31:51,031 --> 00:31:54,494
And you've got a little bit of growth.

587
00:31:54,494 --> 00:31:57,376
Growth is not kind of the, you know, there are RPG systems in there,

588
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,018
not as dense or as rich as Skyrim's.

589
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:03,902
But you are conquering challenges and you're really kind of hitting on all these cylinders.

590
00:32:03,902 --> 00:32:05,583
So there's very strong volitional engagement.

591
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:07,065
One thing that Wisher did very...

592
00:32:09,378 --> 00:32:13,281
It was very interesting to me was they traded in fidelity

593
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:16,424
in order to better deliver on the promise of impactful choices.

594
00:32:16,424 --> 00:32:22,630
So, they couldn't fully render all the endings they want to render.

595
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,253
So, they're like, well, let's not render them, let's just tell them comic book style.

596
00:32:26,253 --> 00:32:29,496
And let's make the bet that the player just wants to see the story,

597
00:32:29,496 --> 00:32:31,938
they want to finish the story, and they want to see the story

598
00:32:31,938 --> 00:32:35,821
that they were writing. And I think that was the right choice.

599
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:40,124
Would it be great if they could have fully rendered everything?

600
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,044
Sure, that would have been great.

601
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:46,246
But the choice here to focus on a dynamic that

602
00:32:46,246 --> 00:32:49,567
is going towards need satisfaction

603
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:53,048
versus just going towards fidelity, I think,

604
00:32:53,048 --> 00:32:54,288
is always the right decision.

605
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:57,409
Also, even in their side quests.

606
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:02,604
Their side quests were not just take these 10 flowers to Bob in the town over.

607
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:08,088
Their side quests were pretty fully realized three-act structures.

608
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:09,910
You know, Geralt gets...

609
00:33:11,147 --> 00:33:13,028
a mystery handed to him that he must solve.

610
00:33:13,028 --> 00:33:16,352
And he goes and figures it, you know, it's put in front of him

611
00:33:16,352 --> 00:33:17,473
and he has to make a decision.

612
00:33:17,473 --> 00:33:19,495
And then he sees an impact.

613
00:33:19,495 --> 00:33:21,297
And so there's this sort of full narrative

614
00:33:21,297 --> 00:33:22,918
that lets people, you know, again,

615
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:25,801
have their paragraphs handed to them

616
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:27,042
about what they're doing.

617
00:33:27,042 --> 00:33:29,745
But if they misstep, it doesn't,

618
00:33:29,745 --> 00:33:31,987
these things are decoupled from the main narrative.

619
00:33:31,987 --> 00:33:34,190
So it doesn't break their volitional engagement

620
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,010
in the game itself.

621
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:42,609
So having kind of these nested deep stories,

622
00:33:42,609 --> 00:33:44,972
deep side stories within the larger main narrative

623
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:45,412
worked well.

624
00:33:45,412 --> 00:33:48,776
So one of the reasons that I talk about

625
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:56,314
multiple games and multiple strategies is to point out that there is no one right way

626
00:33:56,314 --> 00:33:56,775
to do this.

627
00:33:56,775 --> 00:34:00,736
We can certainly look at it, and as researchers we do, we look at, well, this seems to have

628
00:34:00,736 --> 00:34:04,757
a lot of value, and this has some value, and this has more value.

629
00:34:04,757 --> 00:34:09,179
But there's lots of different ways that you can tackle these issues, all of which are

630
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:14,181
focused on need satisfaction in the service of building volition and people leaning forward

631
00:34:14,181 --> 00:34:17,802
into the experience, but there are lots of ways to satisfy those needs, right?

632
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:23,800
I did want to point out, though, that in all the things I just talked about, all the reasons

633
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,202
that these games are winning really aren't about freedom.

634
00:34:28,202 --> 00:34:34,345
They're about that meaningful choice, growth, mastery, and that basic needs satisfaction.

635
00:34:34,345 --> 00:34:37,887
So let's now turn to the challenge here, which is...

636
00:34:39,224 --> 00:34:44,829
Only a handful of companies on the planet can really make these games, right?

637
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:46,811
That can make Volition at scale.

638
00:34:46,811 --> 00:34:48,132
And even for them, it's hard.

639
00:34:48,132 --> 00:34:50,334
What's the timeline between these games being released?

640
00:34:50,334 --> 00:34:51,656
I mean, this is epic.

641
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:55,419
So, that creates an opportunity.

642
00:34:55,419 --> 00:35:00,304
Like, if we could find ways to deliver dense Volition at scale...

643
00:35:01,537 --> 00:35:05,262
then open world is going to become a much richer space

644
00:35:05,262 --> 00:35:07,065
for both developers and players.

645
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:09,949
So our little scientist guy, which is really you guys,

646
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:11,652
like, OK, how could we do that?

647
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,861
And there are lots of different directions I could go in now about things out there

648
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:19,602
and the ways people are trying to think about that,

649
00:35:19,602 --> 00:35:22,663
but I just want to do this one because it's so...

650
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:25,424
It's the main one, I think, and it's really salient,

651
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:30,066
which is procedural systems, the magic of procedural generation.

652
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:33,627
Ah, we can press a button and our game springs to life.

653
00:35:33,627 --> 00:35:37,508
So I say the agony and the ecstasy

654
00:35:37,508 --> 00:35:41,290
because there's no doubt that people want that to be true.

655
00:35:42,468 --> 00:35:45,849
Right? We want that to be true. We just want that game.

656
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:49,090
And that's because of our need for autonomy.

657
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:54,491
And, you know, there's a couple narratives here. I'll just pick the most

658
00:35:54,491 --> 00:35:58,312
recent one, which is No Man's Sky. And I don't want to pile on and

659
00:35:58,312 --> 00:36:02,394
complain about No Man's Sky. I actually, I played the hell out of

660
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:07,015
No Man's Sky. I think No Man's Sky is a really important game. There's tons I love about No Man's Sky.

661
00:36:07,015 --> 00:36:10,356
But, you know, No Man's Sky had some issues.

662
00:36:11,142 --> 00:36:13,302
and it had a lot of issues with players.

663
00:36:13,302 --> 00:36:16,504
And it has to do with all the experiential things we're talking about.

664
00:36:16,504 --> 00:36:19,225
And it has to do with the fact that they fell into the freedom fallacy trap.

665
00:36:19,225 --> 00:36:23,367
If you want to see more evidence that autonomy is the single biggest thing

666
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:27,368
that your players are thinking about, think about the fact that

667
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:31,970
when the game got delayed, Sean Murray got death threats just because it got delayed.

668
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:35,352
This also happened, I think, I don't remember, but I think

669
00:36:35,352 --> 00:36:39,413
during some of the Mass Effect stuff, there was also a story about some death threats.

670
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:43,636
like death threats about a game.

671
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:46,538
And I was thinking, wow, the only two games I know that are big space games.

672
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:49,400
I wonder if there's something about the promise of autonomy there

673
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,041
that's really pissing people off, right?

674
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:54,524
Then when the game launched, of course, we have all the stuff

675
00:36:54,524 --> 00:36:58,427
that people have heard about, which is the nasty backlash against it.

676
00:36:58,427 --> 00:36:58,988
Because why?

677
00:36:58,988 --> 00:37:00,889
Why was there a nasty backlash?

678
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:03,091
Because there's nothing to do.

679
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:03,992
What am I doing?

680
00:37:03,992 --> 00:37:05,533
There wasn't any.

681
00:37:06,414 --> 00:37:10,439
dense volitional content in there for people to consume and be satisfied by.

682
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:13,563
People burned through the very thin layer that was there

683
00:37:13,563 --> 00:37:18,168
on the first two planets and they were out, if that.

684
00:37:18,168 --> 00:37:22,594
And then there came the existential navel-gazing about

685
00:37:23,718 --> 00:37:25,139
Maybe it was all of our mistake.

686
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:27,741
Like I saw multiple articles, I thought it was really funny.

687
00:37:27,741 --> 00:37:31,524
And really, they were fundamentally making a point about autonomy.

688
00:37:31,524 --> 00:37:34,206
It's like, why is it that we expect so much?

689
00:37:34,206 --> 00:37:37,428
Is it that we, you know, fill in the story here?

690
00:37:37,428 --> 00:37:44,253
And I find all this fascinating because it really makes perfect sense to me.

691
00:37:44,253 --> 00:37:48,957
Because of how we're all fanboys of autonomy, that's what we want.

692
00:37:48,957 --> 00:37:49,297
And

693
00:37:50,252 --> 00:37:52,373
So we need this space game.

694
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:54,454
Space is a perfect example for it.

695
00:37:54,454 --> 00:37:56,816
It doesn't mean that it has to be a space game.

696
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,338
We need a game that fulfills the promise

697
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:02,320
that we think about when we think about No Man's Sky.

698
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,882
But of course, we've all been through this before.

699
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,623
We went through this 10 years ago with Spore.

700
00:38:08,555 --> 00:38:12,378
And again, sport did some amazing things, but sport was a disappointment.

701
00:38:12,378 --> 00:38:14,799
And it was a disappointment because of autonomy.

702
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:18,602
Everybody wanted to get to the space stage and spend the rest of their lives

703
00:38:18,602 --> 00:38:20,744
exploring all this awesome content.

704
00:38:20,744 --> 00:38:27,088
And that didn't happen because there wasn't a focus on volitional engagement.

705
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:31,672
And of course, there are people in the wings waiting to come in.

706
00:38:31,672 --> 00:38:33,733
So there are some other people on deck.

707
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:40,385
to either make us all super, super happy or need to go into hiding.

708
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:40,685
I don't know.

709
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,786
But I'm rooting for it.

710
00:38:42,786 --> 00:38:45,087
I'm rooting for this genre.

711
00:38:45,087 --> 00:38:47,548
I think I understand why players want it.

712
00:38:47,548 --> 00:38:53,050
Players project this, to come back to the point I was making earlier, they project this

713
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:56,992
deep autonomy satisfaction within this universe.

714
00:38:56,992 --> 00:38:58,272
But it's because...

715
00:38:59,473 --> 00:39:01,634
They don't know what the game is yet.

716
00:39:01,634 --> 00:39:05,255
So all they have to go on, the only information they have to go on,

717
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:06,595
is when you tell them about size.

718
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:10,877
And they project autonomy into size. And don't fall into that trap.

719
00:39:10,877 --> 00:39:14,938
Because they don't really want size, they want size,

720
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:17,599
but they want volitional engagement.

721
00:39:19,058 --> 00:39:23,862
And so, we figured out how to make all these planets with procedural content.

722
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:30,688
I just want to say that if we're going to solve this issue, whether it's in space or some other type of game,

723
00:39:30,688 --> 00:39:37,554
we're not going to solve it by procedurally generating content and then backfilling it with handcrafted material and activities.

724
00:39:37,554 --> 00:39:42,277
It would be like trying to fill up the ocean with a shovel. It's not going to happen.

725
00:39:42,277 --> 00:39:44,439
So I want to propose that...

726
00:39:45,306 --> 00:39:48,412
You guys all go out and maybe tackle, if you're not already,

727
00:39:48,412 --> 00:39:53,583
you tackle a challenge, which is the idea of building procedural volition.

728
00:39:57,085 --> 00:40:01,448
What I mean specifically here is that you create systems to automatically generate content

729
00:40:01,448 --> 00:40:05,971
whose focus is the player experience of those basic need satisfactions.

730
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:10,474
And that may sound like a moonshot of an idea, but if you think about it,

731
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:14,976
look, we already know, we've distilled down what the essence is of that

732
00:40:14,976 --> 00:40:18,078
all-important autonomy satisfaction, which is volition.

733
00:40:18,078 --> 00:40:22,681
We know what the granular experiences of need satisfaction are that accrue to that,

734
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:24,282
and we can look at current games.

735
00:40:25,495 --> 00:40:28,938
and we can see the types of things that they're doing

736
00:40:28,938 --> 00:40:30,378
in order to satisfy volition.

737
00:40:30,378 --> 00:40:34,501
So we have a lot of interesting pieces on the board, right?

738
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:37,023
So now what we have to do is we just have to figure out

739
00:40:37,023 --> 00:40:38,343
how do we get that to scale, right?

740
00:40:38,343 --> 00:40:41,585
So, you know, shouldn't be that hard.

741
00:40:41,585 --> 00:40:44,007
Obviously super complicated,

742
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:46,669
because now we have to deal with psychology in the mix,

743
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:50,991
and we have a whole other set of variables,

744
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:52,292
but you know, I think that...

745
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:53,822
I think I would love that game.

746
00:40:53,822 --> 00:40:55,324
I bet most people in here would love those games.

747
00:40:55,324 --> 00:40:59,328
I think it would be transformative to the creation of games, and I know that players

748
00:40:59,328 --> 00:41:03,732
want it, because players already feel like they've been promised it like 40 times.

749
00:41:03,732 --> 00:41:08,036
So they're a little bit on edge and suspicious at the same time.

750
00:41:09,682 --> 00:41:14,625
There are some glimpses I see out there, I'm just going to touch on one of them of some

751
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:20,189
cool ideas that don't really qualify as procedural generation, but do some interesting magic

752
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:26,374
tricks that show you can generate a lot of the experience of depth and volition even

753
00:41:26,374 --> 00:41:31,057
with very limited resources by being smart about what you're doing.

754
00:41:31,057 --> 00:41:32,178
So Shadow of Mordor.

755
00:41:33,499 --> 00:41:40,783
has the nemesis system and it has sparks of this kind of idea of being really efficient to generate an expectation and

756
00:41:40,783 --> 00:41:45,206
deep experiences where you know the it procedurally generated

757
00:41:45,206 --> 00:41:52,210
You know a nemesis for the player and it did that by you know when you have interactions with this orc this

758
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,432
You know they have massive impact not just on

759
00:41:56,418 --> 00:42:01,642
you know, the orc itself, if you shoot an arrow through its eye or whatever you do to it,

760
00:42:01,642 --> 00:42:06,927
its eye is blocked off. But also, that orc is pissed. Or if that orc kills you, by the way,

761
00:42:06,927 --> 00:42:12,311
whether you win or lose, things happen, right? The orc kills you, suddenly the orc becomes

762
00:42:12,311 --> 00:42:17,455
more powerful. Now you're knitted together in this relationship. And also, you've learned a

763
00:42:17,455 --> 00:42:21,759
schema for the game that isn't exactly accurate. And the schema is, wow.

764
00:42:22,254 --> 00:42:24,937
No, these orcs, they really take everything personally.

765
00:42:24,937 --> 00:42:28,721
It's like they're all out there, like who knows what could happen.

766
00:42:28,721 --> 00:42:32,846
Now, you know, players can pattern fit very quickly that there wasn't that much depth.

767
00:42:33,857 --> 00:42:39,123
But just the amount of depth that was there allowed for a really compelling

768
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:42,527
personal narrative where people felt like, this is my story.

769
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:47,292
That was my one-eyed orc that I shot the arrow through, right?

770
00:42:47,292 --> 00:42:53,038
And so you see all of these stories on the internet of

771
00:42:54,015 --> 00:42:58,162
uh... players who have these interactions and then you know they get

772
00:42:58,162 --> 00:43:01,767
online and they start talking about oh yeah I gotta kill this guy you know this is just

773
00:43:01,767 --> 00:43:03,710
I'm not going to read all this but

774
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:07,636
uh... there's many many examples of it just to call one thing out

775
00:43:08,066 --> 00:43:11,608
The nemesis system let me craft my own story and relationships.

776
00:43:11,608 --> 00:43:14,270
In the end, the fighting was the end of the game for me.

777
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,592
Me and my bitter rival and nemesis were friends.

778
00:43:16,592 --> 00:43:18,733
So if I were to put up, I don't have it here,

779
00:43:18,733 --> 00:43:22,956
but the need satisfaction chart for Mordor,

780
00:43:22,956 --> 00:43:24,897
you know, there's this amazing thing,

781
00:43:24,897 --> 00:43:27,579
which is that this procedural system,

782
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:29,440
but this system that laid on top,

783
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,523
this nemesis system created this deep relationship

784
00:43:34,523 --> 00:43:37,285
satisfaction, relatedness satisfaction with an enemy.

785
00:43:38,232 --> 00:43:39,934
which is really fascinating.

786
00:43:39,934 --> 00:43:42,617
So there's really innovative things we can do

787
00:43:42,617 --> 00:43:45,280
to take a little and turn it into a lot experientially.

788
00:43:47,035 --> 00:43:52,882
I just want to close by talking about a couple of things that I think might be worth considering,

789
00:43:52,882 --> 00:43:59,129
and I'm saying this fully aware that I'm neither a video game designer nor am I an engineer,

790
00:43:59,129 --> 00:44:02,833
so feel free to chuckle or whatever you want to do.

791
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:06,257
But I am somebody that works with data and numbers a lot, and I am somebody that works

792
00:44:06,257 --> 00:44:08,239
with formula and also trying to...

793
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:14,842
take people and this is going to sound awful but take people and turn what they're experiencing

794
00:44:14,842 --> 00:44:17,185
into things that can be measured.

795
00:44:17,804 --> 00:44:19,645
and that we can put a number to,

796
00:44:19,645 --> 00:44:22,207
and that that number is meaningful for something.

797
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:25,050
And I just want to say that that's the piece

798
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:28,372
that behavioral psychologists carry around a lot,

799
00:44:28,372 --> 00:44:31,154
which is you can measure things like love

800
00:44:31,154 --> 00:44:33,816
and all these big ideas.

801
00:44:33,816 --> 00:44:36,058
You can actually find ways to operationalize

802
00:44:36,058 --> 00:44:38,100
and measure them, and since that's true,

803
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,761
I think what we need to do is we need to put

804
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:42,903
more player verbs, player variables,

805
00:44:42,903 --> 00:44:47,026
into our equations for procedural generation.

806
00:44:47,502 --> 00:44:49,702
So instead of just procedurally generating content

807
00:44:49,702 --> 00:44:53,044
and then trying to manually wrap systems over the content,

808
00:44:53,044 --> 00:44:56,285
why can't we be creating systems where,

809
00:44:56,285 --> 00:44:59,586
as players make choices and they act,

810
00:44:59,586 --> 00:45:02,347
that the game world is procedurally altered and it scales?

811
00:45:02,347 --> 00:45:06,029
Not just a decision point that puts you down a bunch of

812
00:45:06,029 --> 00:45:08,490
pre-rendered content A, pre-rendered content B,

813
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,571
but it's procedurally generated.

814
00:45:11,571 --> 00:45:13,872
The second thing is to focus on meaningful impact.

815
00:45:13,872 --> 00:45:14,932
Impact is key.

816
00:45:15,787 --> 00:45:18,569
And we've seen that in all the things that we've talked about.

817
00:45:18,569 --> 00:45:24,754
So we could focus on dynamically changing content,

818
00:45:24,754 --> 00:45:26,956
goal structures, activity structures,

819
00:45:26,956 --> 00:45:29,998
in response to what the players are doing,

820
00:45:29,998 --> 00:45:31,800
and do that procedurally.

821
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,901
You're like, what the hell does that mean?

822
00:45:35,168 --> 00:45:36,269
What does that look like? I don't know.

823
00:45:36,269 --> 00:45:39,590
Right? That's, you know, we're here to innovate and design.

824
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:42,471
So these are just some thoughts I had about this.

825
00:45:42,471 --> 00:45:44,752
And the last thing I want to mention is this idea

826
00:45:44,752 --> 00:45:46,812
of latent variables, and for the non-math people,

827
00:45:46,812 --> 00:45:50,514
latent variables are just variables that get computed

828
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:51,654
from other variables.

829
00:45:51,654 --> 00:45:53,715
So you're tracking all this telemetry and the things

830
00:45:53,715 --> 00:45:54,995
that people are doing in the game.

831
00:45:54,995 --> 00:45:56,696
One of the great things that is now happening

832
00:45:56,696 --> 00:46:00,277
in behavioral science is that you can compute

833
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:05,901
weighting variables and latent variable profiles for people that essentially

834
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:11,526
let people be their own baseline for various things. And you essentially are

835
00:46:11,526 --> 00:46:15,169
getting pictures of who that person is. I think these variables could be used as

836
00:46:15,169 --> 00:46:20,033
weighting variables in the procedural generation equation so that you could

837
00:46:20,033 --> 00:46:23,996
surface four players in a much more powerful way.

838
00:46:24,637 --> 00:46:31,146
the types of experiences and content that are actually aligned with what it is that

839
00:46:31,146 --> 00:46:32,167
they have an affinity for.

840
00:46:33,154 --> 00:46:38,817
And we could do that much more than we are simply by tracking behavioral telemetry the way that we are now.

841
00:46:38,817 --> 00:46:45,580
So anyway, we could talk about ideas for this all day, but I really think that

842
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:52,504
I think that if we're going to actually create the game that we all hoped No Man's Sky would be, or Spore was, or maybe what all the next things are,

843
00:46:52,504 --> 00:47:00,608
I think that we're not going to crack that unless we can begin to think about engineering deep.

844
00:47:00,998 --> 00:47:06,162
volitional player experiences through need satisfaction.

845
00:47:06,162 --> 00:47:06,702
I think that, why not?

846
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:07,963
I think it could be done.

847
00:47:07,963 --> 00:47:11,506
I think it's going to be hard, but everything worthwhile

848
00:47:11,506 --> 00:47:12,587
is hard, right?

849
00:47:12,587 --> 00:47:13,608
So I think that's it.

850
00:47:13,608 --> 00:47:16,009
Just remember whatever comes next.

851
00:47:16,009 --> 00:47:19,272
Autonomy equals volition, not freedom.

852
00:47:19,272 --> 00:47:19,552
Thanks.

853
00:47:28,987 --> 00:47:31,588
All right, so people have questions,

854
00:47:31,588 --> 00:47:33,008
they can come down to the mics.

855
00:47:33,008 --> 00:47:33,508
All right, yeah.

856
00:47:33,508 --> 00:47:34,248
Hey, how's it going?

857
00:47:34,248 --> 00:47:34,748
Thank you.

858
00:47:34,748 --> 00:47:37,429
I was wondering if you had spent much time

859
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:40,850
thinking about, with regards to belongingness

860
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:45,450
and relatedness, the role that other players can play,

861
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:50,191
and of course, how one would measure that effect

862
00:47:50,191 --> 00:47:52,092
once you realize that there are other players

863
00:47:52,092 --> 00:47:53,852
that are creating this sense of belongingness.

864
00:47:55,302 --> 00:47:58,183
So, one thing I didn't talk about at all today,

865
00:47:58,183 --> 00:48:01,645
which was just very deliberate, is other players.

866
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:06,387
Other players is a massive interpersonal variable

867
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:09,368
and mechanism for need satisfaction.

868
00:48:09,368 --> 00:48:10,949
It's, you know, when you look at

869
00:48:10,949 --> 00:48:12,190
competitive multiplayer games,

870
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,891
the reason that competitive multiplayer games are so big,

871
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:15,831
and I didn't talk about them,

872
00:48:15,831 --> 00:48:17,392
but I referenced them in the beginning,

873
00:48:17,392 --> 00:48:19,033
you know, a lot of this has to do with

874
00:48:19,033 --> 00:48:21,614
that kind of relatedness of satisfaction that's going on.

875
00:48:21,614 --> 00:48:24,175
So, I think that.

876
00:48:25,175 --> 00:48:28,876
When I think about relatedness in this context,

877
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:31,017
I just go back and just like any other system,

878
00:48:31,017 --> 00:48:36,499
I would say, what are the experiences or social systems

879
00:48:36,499 --> 00:48:38,579
that you wanna set up in the game

880
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:40,400
for multiplayer interactions?

881
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,582
And how do those systems facilitate belongingness,

882
00:48:45,582 --> 00:48:49,843
facilitate I matter to you and you matter to me?

883
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,124
The classic example from

884
00:48:52,824 --> 00:48:57,346
World of Warcraft or the tank healer structure is that it was a mechanic that fostered

885
00:48:57,346 --> 00:49:00,587
people feeling like they mattered to one another, because they did.

886
00:49:00,587 --> 00:49:03,768
So, you know, that's why that takes hold on a relatedness level.

887
00:49:03,768 --> 00:49:08,609
So the question is how can those systems be built? But I think it's massively important.

888
00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:10,610
And if we were doing a talk on relatedness...

889
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:16,672
I would have gone into all those things, but what I will say, and I'm glad you asked the question, is that

890
00:49:16,672 --> 00:49:25,115
relatedness, and you saw it in the marriage and having a baby example, is a massive driver of volitional engagement.

891
00:49:25,115 --> 00:49:26,575
So, does that get at your question?

892
00:49:26,575 --> 00:49:28,176
Yeah, I think so. We can talk more about that.

893
00:49:28,176 --> 00:49:29,296
Okay, that's great.

894
00:49:29,296 --> 00:49:31,877
Alright, who was next? Walker, can you wait? Okay.

895
00:49:31,877 --> 00:49:32,137
Sorry, Walker.

896
00:49:35,277 --> 00:49:41,338
Hello. I'd like to talk a little bit about procedural evolution.

897
00:49:41,338 --> 00:49:46,740
There is a genre that actually does something that you mentioned,

898
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:51,201
that forex strategies like civilization or Stellaris.

899
00:49:51,201 --> 00:49:53,582
We're talking about space, by the way.

900
00:49:53,582 --> 00:49:55,402
Yes, yeah, yeah.

901
00:49:55,402 --> 00:49:57,262
How do you think, can we...

902
00:49:59,957 --> 00:50:04,599
distill somehow the principles like for

903
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:09,561
That are work in these 4x games and apply it to open world

904
00:50:09,561 --> 00:50:14,864
Yeah, I so I think sure I think that's as good idea as any I mean

905
00:50:14,864 --> 00:50:23,908
I I think that those games have a lot of very deeply nested systems that all operate and they create a they create a dynamic

906
00:50:23,908 --> 00:50:28,229
Arc to a game that can last you know, I don't know 20 or 30 hours

907
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:33,293
I think what we're talking about here, though, is taking things to a much greater scale.

908
00:50:33,293 --> 00:50:37,716
In other words, when you play those games, you do get a narrative arc,

909
00:50:37,716 --> 00:50:40,958
but you tend to play the same story over and over again.

910
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:48,743
This is the story of you conquering the world, or the story of you conquering the universe, and then you just kind of go back again.

911
00:50:48,743 --> 00:50:51,205
It doesn't create this kind of persistent

912
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:58,709
persistent universe that I think is a different thing than things like those strategy games are.

913
00:50:58,709 --> 00:51:04,292
But to your point, I think that some of the ideas in there about how they're combining dynamic systems

914
00:51:04,292 --> 00:51:12,215
in order to create an ever-changing landscape moment to moment that lets the player in one game say,

915
00:51:12,215 --> 00:51:18,718
I'm pissed off at Gandhi for nuking me, and in another game being mad at Montezuma.

916
00:51:18,718 --> 00:51:21,560
I think there's something worth mining there, sure.

917
00:51:23,472 --> 00:51:33,200
So it might just be a terminology, but in your graphic about autonomy, competence, and

918
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:42,247
relatedness holding up volition, like volition you have also pointed out is the same as autonomy,

919
00:51:42,247 --> 00:51:43,088
so what the hell?

920
00:51:43,088 --> 00:51:44,449
Right the hell, right.

921
00:51:44,449 --> 00:51:46,710
So you're asking a really nuanced semantic question.

922
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:49,112
So autonomy is…

923
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:53,682
Autonomy is the feeling of agency.

924
00:51:53,682 --> 00:51:57,126
It's the feeling of that I am creating my story, right?

925
00:51:57,126 --> 00:51:59,690
That's really what autonomy is.

926
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:02,413
Volition is if you want to be doing something,

927
00:52:02,413 --> 00:52:06,338
then that aligns with that sense of agency, right?

928
00:52:06,338 --> 00:52:10,603
And so when I put the autonomy as a support,

929
00:52:12,015 --> 00:52:15,917
There are other things that also create that sense of wanting and other things.

930
00:52:15,917 --> 00:52:19,420
There's the creation of meaningful choices and those sorts of things.

931
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:24,564
The other thing I would say is that if you want to get really deep into self-determination theory,

932
00:52:24,564 --> 00:52:31,388
it's often the case that you talk about autonomous functioning as a roll-up of all the need-satisfiers.

933
00:52:33,029 --> 00:52:38,531
Because that's, if you had to pick one overarching principle of self-determination theory,

934
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:43,073
it's that you're behaving in a way that feels like you fully endorse the path that you're on,

935
00:52:43,073 --> 00:52:45,094
and these things all become inputs to that.

936
00:52:45,094 --> 00:52:45,654
Okay.

937
00:52:45,654 --> 00:52:52,236
Hi, I was one of the designers on Spore, and we had, like after the game shipped,

938
00:52:52,236 --> 00:52:55,337
a lot of hardcore game players really hated it, and they were down on it, like you mentioned.

939
00:52:56,288 --> 00:52:59,290
But we also found that a lot of younger players just loved it,

940
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:01,211
like to the point of people like, where's Spore 2?

941
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:03,273
Like, I love that game, I played it all the time.

942
00:53:03,273 --> 00:53:07,696
And I was wondering if you did much research about age and how it relates to autonomy,

943
00:53:07,696 --> 00:53:13,740
like why would kids be more autonomous or willing to play in these systems than adults might be?

944
00:53:15,528 --> 00:53:17,609
So, there's a lot of possible answers to that.

945
00:53:17,609 --> 00:53:20,271
One thing is there's context in Spore.

946
00:53:20,271 --> 00:53:24,294
And so, the Creature Editor was one of the most

947
00:53:24,294 --> 00:53:27,677
amazing things that Games has produced.

948
00:53:27,677 --> 00:53:31,479
And it had a context that kids could really relate to.

949
00:53:31,479 --> 00:53:33,361
I mean, it looked like taking a giant,

950
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:36,783
the Play-Doh machine, and putting something together

951
00:53:36,783 --> 00:53:39,085
in infinite ways and bringing something to life.

952
00:53:39,085 --> 00:53:41,647
And they can map that schema really easily.

953
00:53:41,647 --> 00:53:43,628
So, there's some of that sort of schema mapping

954
00:53:43,628 --> 00:53:44,589
and affinity for.

955
00:53:45,709 --> 00:53:52,612
that that's going on. I think that also it's a it was a context that smaller game of doing that creating creatures

956
00:53:52,612 --> 00:53:56,634
like what I'd be interested. I guess my question is did kids want to go to space?

957
00:53:57,135 --> 00:53:58,416
Or do kids want to play around?

958
00:53:58,416 --> 00:54:01,019
Like, did you ever look at the telemetry and the behavioral data?

959
00:54:01,019 --> 00:54:02,860
Because that would give you some clues.

960
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:03,541
Yeah, not directly.

961
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:07,183
Although we did have a lot of like parents telling us that their kids couldn't play

962
00:54:07,183 --> 00:54:08,044
Spore anymore.

963
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:10,826
Like they had to take it away from them because they played it too much.

964
00:54:10,826 --> 00:54:14,710
Yeah, and we've seen like drawings from kids that show the whole arc from cell all

965
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,530
the way up to space.

966
00:54:16,511 --> 00:54:17,452
They would draw by hand.

967
00:54:17,452 --> 00:54:18,152
Yeah.

968
00:54:18,152 --> 00:54:19,653
They weren't playing the game.

969
00:54:19,653 --> 00:54:24,197
I mean my bet is, we don't know because we don't have data, that they're kind of playing

970
00:54:24,197 --> 00:54:25,678
at that level.

971
00:54:25,678 --> 00:54:30,121
I mean I bet if you just looked at how many kids play the Creature Creator, mothers might

972
00:54:30,121 --> 00:54:33,403
complain about that same thing because it was such a compelling piece.

973
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:33,623
Yeah.

974
00:54:33,623 --> 00:54:38,187
I think the more general question I have is just the age and autonomy, like independent

975
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:38,567
of a spore.

976
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:38,667
Right.

977
00:54:39,007 --> 00:54:44,290
So, the thing about the needs are that they are, you know, one of the quick examples I

978
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:48,292
use is that it's the same as you've got, I'm talking about psychological needs, you also

979
00:54:48,292 --> 00:54:49,012
have physical needs.

980
00:54:49,012 --> 00:54:56,096
And so you have a physical need for hunger and thirst and think about them in the same

981
00:54:56,096 --> 00:54:58,317
way as that.

982
00:54:58,317 --> 00:55:02,579
So, you know, kids have them, adults have them, old people have them, young people have

983
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:02,699
them.

984
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:06,841
It's like, you know, kids don't have less hunger than adults do or less of a need for

985
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:07,842
food than adults do.

986
00:55:08,774 --> 00:55:13,215
these are universal things at every age and across, you know, really globally.

987
00:55:13,215 --> 00:55:16,756
And when I say that, we've measured kids, we've measured across the world.

988
00:55:16,756 --> 00:55:19,616
There have been thousands of studies in a lot of domains outside of games that

989
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:24,377
validate the needs. The question is just how, what are the channels by which

990
00:55:24,377 --> 00:55:29,398
those needs get satisfied? And so the one thing I will say is that for adults,

991
00:55:29,398 --> 00:55:34,799
there are certain things where we have autonomy that, um, uh, they don't feel

992
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,601
We don't feel like we're flexing a lot of muscles for growth and experimentation, like

993
00:55:39,601 --> 00:55:42,442
picking out our own clothes, for example.

994
00:55:42,442 --> 00:55:44,622
That's not something that's very need satisfying.

995
00:55:44,622 --> 00:55:45,783
We've kind of got that down.

996
00:55:45,783 --> 00:55:48,964
We've pattern fit the whole picking out our clothes thing.

997
00:55:48,964 --> 00:55:52,304
But for kids, you'll see in games that they'll have affinity to, I want to wear the goofy

998
00:55:52,304 --> 00:55:55,445
hat and I want to do this thing and I want to experiment, because they don't have disposable

999
00:55:55,445 --> 00:55:56,766
income to go buy clothes.

1000
00:55:57,526 --> 00:56:06,517
The needs are the same, but the channels by which they get satisfied can differ as a function

1001
00:56:06,517 --> 00:56:09,160
of age, preference, taste, those sorts of things.

1002
00:56:09,815 --> 00:56:12,397
So a lot of what you talked about,

1003
00:56:12,397 --> 00:56:13,618
I think you touched on this a bit,

1004
00:56:13,618 --> 00:56:17,161
but it sounds like a lot of creating volition

1005
00:56:17,161 --> 00:56:20,144
comes from aligning narrative and player choice.

1006
00:56:20,144 --> 00:56:22,986
So theoretically, perfectly aligned narrative

1007
00:56:22,986 --> 00:56:25,388
with absolutely no dissonance between player choice

1008
00:56:25,388 --> 00:56:28,370
and narrative would have very strong volition.

1009
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:28,831
Is that right?

1010
00:56:28,831 --> 00:56:35,016
It would have, well I think you're describing like a movie.

1011
00:56:36,385 --> 00:56:40,649
So what I would say is that movies are awesome.

1012
00:56:40,649 --> 00:56:45,715
In other words, people get very involved in these experiences and yes, they can be very

1013
00:56:45,715 --> 00:56:49,639
volitionally engaging, but are they...

1014
00:56:50,952 --> 00:56:54,795
But they aren't really the, they aren't as engaging as games

1015
00:56:54,795 --> 00:56:58,557
that give them more opportunity for all the other things

1016
00:56:58,557 --> 00:57:00,639
that you saw reflected in the model.

1017
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:03,841
So things like the ability to grow and conquer challenges

1018
00:57:03,841 --> 00:57:08,844
and you know, have relationships and those things.

1019
00:57:08,844 --> 00:57:13,387
Those things are not as deeply satisfied

1020
00:57:13,387 --> 00:57:16,890
in just a simple, perfectly aligned linear thing.

1021
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:19,551
And they certainly don't provide as much value.

1022
00:57:20,209 --> 00:57:25,532
as something that can provide 200, 300, 400 hours, I guess if you could tell a 400-hour

1023
00:57:25,532 --> 00:57:29,914
story, but I've never seen that done, right?

1024
00:57:29,914 --> 00:57:30,814
Yeah.

1025
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:36,217
So, anyway, it's, people are volitionally engaged, but they know when they're not writing

1026
00:57:36,217 --> 00:57:41,619
the story, and systems to let them write the story in our research are more powerful than

1027
00:57:41,619 --> 00:57:41,779
that.

1028
00:57:41,779 --> 00:57:47,262
Okay, yeah, I guess I'm kind of asking more around the hypothetical, which is probably

1029
00:57:47,262 --> 00:57:48,983
not possible, but the idea of...

1030
00:57:49,656 --> 00:57:55,703
If the narrative drives for the player were perfectly aligned with what the player wanted

1031
00:57:55,703 --> 00:58:01,409
to do, the lack of breadth of choice could almost be hidden.

1032
00:58:01,409 --> 00:58:06,835
So in a situation like that, like a narrative...

1033
00:58:06,835 --> 00:58:08,757
I'm sorry, it involves you what?

1034
00:58:08,757 --> 00:58:10,098
The breadth of choice involves you?

1035
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:13,991
Oh, sorry, the breadth of choice would just become hidden, somewhat.

1036
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:18,253
So if my... what I want to do as a player is always what the game allows me to do.

1037
00:58:18,253 --> 00:58:24,035
Theoretically, there should be no difference between a fully, like, procedurally generated game

1038
00:58:24,035 --> 00:58:27,416
where I actually have every choice, because I'm always doing the thing I want to do.

1039
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:30,577
But I'm wondering if you've thought about that at all, like, in terms of...

1040
00:58:30,577 --> 00:58:33,838
Well, that's... you're gonna run into the mind-reading problem there, big time.

1041
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:35,399
I mean, that's the issue.

1042
00:58:35,399 --> 00:58:36,559
It's like, so, in a universe, why not?

1043
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:39,660
I mean, I was doing it, let's do it with you.

1044
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:43,102
in a universe where you could create a game where

1045
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,063
every turn that the player made was,

1046
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,564
they thought they were ultimate turns,

1047
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:48,024
but it was only that turn,

1048
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,745
and it just kind of followed them perfectly,

1049
00:58:49,745 --> 00:58:52,827
and so you could deeply realize it and crush it,

1050
00:58:52,827 --> 00:58:53,687
that would be awesome.

1051
00:58:53,687 --> 00:58:55,808
I don't think it's, I don't think it's.

1052
00:58:55,808 --> 00:58:59,630
I think I'll just try to rephrase the question.

1053
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:00,270
Yeah.

1054
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,251
Is it a game like, say, an Uncharted game,

1055
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:03,512
or a Last of Us?

1056
00:59:03,512 --> 00:59:05,953
Do you think those actually have potential

1057
00:59:05,953 --> 00:59:09,095
for the same levels of volition as a more open world game?

1058
00:59:09,515 --> 00:59:14,566
Or are they just inherently better at dealing with other needs or satisfying other needs?

1059
00:59:15,648 --> 00:59:21,133
I think that when people find the, in those games, when people find the narrative engaging

1060
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:26,778
and they feel like they, the needs are being satisfied for their sense of, you know, competence

1061
00:59:26,778 --> 00:59:31,381
or connection to NPCs or whatever those things are, that they are volitionally engaged in

1062
00:59:31,381 --> 00:59:36,466
those experiences, I think they're simply at a competitive disadvantage to other games

1063
00:59:36,466 --> 00:59:40,589
that are giving them all these tools to more fully realize a personal narrative.

1064
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:46,875
So, I mean, you know, so that's a little bit different than saying this one's worse at volition than this one is.

1065
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:50,919
Because I think if you took in the moment, is the person volitionally into this?

1066
00:59:50,919 --> 00:59:55,863
I think that there are certainly going to be moments when the games align, as you point out,

1067
00:59:55,863 --> 00:59:58,085
where people are going to have volitional engagement.

1068
00:59:58,085 --> 01:00:03,230
I think it's looking at it this other way that I would say that, you know,

1069
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:05,952
this is a main reason why that genre has largely died out.

1070
01:00:05,952 --> 01:00:06,493
Yeah, thanks.

1071
01:00:09,479 --> 01:00:11,920
Real quickly you talked about

1072
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,983
Your examples you talked about Skyrim and games like the Witcher

1073
01:00:15,983 --> 01:00:21,246
One of the things that's so different about those games is Skyrim kind of gives you the avatar suit

1074
01:00:21,246 --> 01:00:25,969
Unless you sort of make that character anyone you wanted to be and customizes race gender all that stuff

1075
01:00:25,969 --> 01:00:30,111
Yeah, did you guys ever collect any data or have any findings or try to isolate?

1076
01:00:30,111 --> 01:00:30,372
What?

1077
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:38,289
engagement rate versus, you know, players that get to choose exactly who they want to be versus somebody who steps into a Shepard or

1078
01:00:38,289 --> 01:00:45,872
Geralt. Yeah, so I have, we haven't looked at that recently, but I've looked at that, you know, in the past and

1079
01:00:45,872 --> 01:00:51,935
from a, from a volitional standpoint, it, there's not a major, there's not a massive impact of those things, right?

1080
01:00:51,935 --> 01:00:55,917
Because the reality is that regardless of who I skin myself as in that game,

1081
01:00:56,618 --> 01:01:00,322
whether I get to pick the skin, or whether you make me shepherd or somebody,

1082
01:01:00,322 --> 01:01:05,207
that what the research does show, and that we know we've answered pretty definitively,

1083
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:11,153
is that there used to be a debate of, do people get into games so that they can, you know,

1084
01:01:11,153 --> 01:01:15,617
do crazy things and pretend they're a plate of, you know, sentient spaghetti and whatever.

1085
01:01:16,378 --> 01:01:19,820
and games allow you to be anybody, that's not what players do.

1086
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:23,943
Because they want to feel volitional engagement and need satisfied,

1087
01:01:23,943 --> 01:01:28,726
they've optimized how to do that by actually being who they are

1088
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:31,908
and wanting the game to let them be who they are, right?

1089
01:01:31,908 --> 01:01:34,269
And so they're going to tell a player narrative whether they're...

1090
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:40,112
you know, whether they have to play Shepard and they don't like the color of his shoes

1091
01:01:40,112 --> 01:01:42,033
isn't really going to matter.

1092
01:01:42,033 --> 01:01:47,436
They're going to essentially be looking at the core mechanics of the game and narrative

1093
01:01:47,436 --> 01:01:51,658
and everything in order to tell their story.

1094
01:01:51,658 --> 01:01:51,978
So thank you.

1095
01:01:51,978 --> 01:01:53,439
Yeah.

1096
01:01:53,439 --> 01:01:54,399
How much?

1097
01:01:54,399 --> 01:01:54,860
Oh, we're done?

1098
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:55,960
All right.

1099
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:56,220
I'm sorry.

1100
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:58,501
I mean, I'm giving this sign that sounds serious.

1101
01:01:58,501 --> 01:02:00,062
So thank you very much, everybody.
